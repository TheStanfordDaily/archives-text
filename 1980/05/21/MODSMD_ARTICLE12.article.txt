# 40 countries to boycott Olympics
## IOC president resigns 
### Geoffrey Miller The Associated Press 
LONDON â€” As more than 40 countries pre
pare to boycott the Moscow Olympics, Lord Killa
nin prepares to step down as president of the Inter
national Olympic Committee.
Killanin says he has rejected suggestions that he
stay on after his eight-year term ends this summer.
"1 considered it," the 65-year-old Irishman said,
"but after the events of the last few months I have
decided it is the right time to hand over to a new
president."
The Olympic year of 1980 opened quietly, with
preparations for the Winter Games at Lake Placid,
N.Y. But before January was half over, Killanin
found himself facing the collapse of the Moscow
Games following the Soviet military action in Af
ghanistan and President Carter's subsequent call
for a boycott.
Burma said it would not field a team because of
the lack of top-level competitors, and New Zea
land Prime Minister Robert Muldoon asked his
country's National Olympic Committee to recon
sider its decision to compete.
The OlympicCouncil of Ireland voted 19-1 togo
against the advice of its government and send a
team to Moscow. The lone dissenter was the Irish
Boxing Federation, which said it would not go.
The Dutch National Olympic Committee also
voted, by a 49-19 margin, to go against the wishes
of its government and participate in the Moscow
Games, rejecting pleas from the Dutch parliament
and cabinet to support the boycott.
Belgium's Olympic Committee reaffirmed its
earlier decision to send a team to Moscow, and the
Swedish and Austrian Olympic committees de
cided officially, as expected, to compete.
Meanwhile, in an interview, Killanin said that as
far as he is concerned, the 1984 Olympics will go on
in Los Angeles as planned.
"I told President (Jimmy) Carter this when I met
him at the White House last week," Killanin said.
"I explained to him that the Olympic Games in
Moscow cannot be postponed, because we have an

agreement in Moscow. II we keep to our agreement
with Moscow, then we also keep to our agreement
with Los Angeles."
At his own request. Killanin met with President
Leonid Brezhnev at the Kremlin and President
Carter at the White House. But he tailed to break
the deadlock over the American-led boycott of the
Moscow Games.
Killanin said he warned Brezhnev that possibly
only 40 countries would send athletes to the Mos
cow Games, and said the Soviet leader remained
"poker-faced." But Ignaty Novikov, president of
the Moscow Olympic organizing committee,
looked up in surprise. Killanin added. Novikov is a
deputy prime minister but is not a member of the
Soviet Presidium.
"1 did not mention Afghanistan, but President
Brezhnev did," Killanin said. "He told me Russian
troops had been sent to Afghanistan because the
Afghan government requested it."
The lOC leader's conversation with Carter was
mainly about the 1984 Games in Los Angeles, he
explained.
"1 never mentioned the Moscow Games until
President Carter asked if there was anything he
could do to help me," said Killanin. "So I asked
whether there was any chance he might lift the
embargo on United States athletes going to Mos
cow, and he made it clear there was no chance at
all."
Killanin has written to all 86 members of the
lOC, telling them he will not stand for a further
term. That is likely to ensure a lull turnout at the
lOC session in Moscow, set for shortly before the
opening of the Games in July.
The executive board has been worried that be
cause of the controversy over Afghanistan, many
lOC members might stay away. Important deci
sions have to be made, including finalizing the
program for the 1984 Games and election of a
president and vice president.
The choice of a new president is likely to fall
among Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, Willi
Daume of West Germany, James Worrall of
Canada and Lance Cross of New Zealand.
