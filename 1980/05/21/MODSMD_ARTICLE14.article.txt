# Yoga Center takes out kinks
## 
### Pamela Johnson Staff Writer 
"Yoga began with people watching ani
mals to see how they relaxed," said I.olly
Font, teacher at the Yoga Center in Palo
Alto.
Dating yoga back to before Christ, Font,
50, described yoga as a form of meditation
which removes stress through stretching.
K1 ise Miller, also an instructor at the
center, taught yoga at the YWC'A here be
fore the opening of the center January
15. Miller said that the center uses the more
meditation-oriented forms of yoga.
Yoga Center teachers studied under
B.K.S. Iyengar of India.
Through hatha, one kind of yoga, one
achieves, by thought processes, a sense of
timelessness and spacelessness, said the 31-
year-old Miller.
"The breath is the key," she explained. "One
must be aware of tfvery part (of the body and)
give total attention to the breath because it is
the link between the body and the mind."*,
Discipline
Yoga is a discipline. But discipline is an
Eastern word at which Westerners cringe, so
the instructors don't present it like that, said
Miller.
Often people think of yoga as just an exer
cise, said Miller, noting common misconcep
tions. Some think they have to have a guru,
while others think yoga is just weird, she said.

But Standlcy Scott, a football trainer here,
isn't of that opinion. Although he's never
taken a class, Scott thinks the principle is
good.
'it's a good stretching regime," he said.
"The slow stretching and relaxing can be
very beneficial, especially tor lower back or
spinal problems. But some people shouldn't
do some exercises."
Fat trimmer
Senior Elizabeth Foley began yoga in
junior high school as a gentler method ot
slimming down.
"Just like stretching a certain way de
velops muscles, yoga can stimulate the
thyroid to increase metabolism. It puts you in
touch with whether you feel overweight, un
derweight or just comfortable," the English
major added.
Steve Rockwell, folk dance instructor at
Roble gym. praises yoga as one of the most
rewarding things he's ever done.
"The type 1 took was unusually intensive.
The first three months I was in pain. But it
changed me in a physically and emotionally
satisfying way."
Football yoga
The football tedVn here will probably try to
extract more of the physical changes when it
begins its t intennive off-season weight train
ing and flexibility program this summer.
The exercises team members will be doing
are "a replica of yoga exercises," according

to Mora Whitmer, secretary at the Athletic
Department.
The coaches are very much concerned with
people using muscles to their best advantage,,
said Whitmer. . - *
The Yoga Center offers a program to get
the kinks out of those muscles so they work
more efficiently. For $50, one receives an
individual one-and-a-half to two-hour ses
sion of deep massage — or rolling.
Rolling, developed by Ida Rolf, is deep
tissue massage designed to totally align the
body.
" Rolfing is fast yoga," said Lolly Font. "It
achieves what yoga does, exccpt a roller does
jt to you helping you to work out bad
memories caught deep within the muscles."
Although yoga enthusiasts continuously
attempt to explain and analyze yoga and its
benefits, it seems to evade categorical label
ing.
Is yoga more difficult than calisthenics?
"It depends on the individual." said Foley.
"Is a sprint harder than a long distance run?"
Classes are held Monday through Satur
day at the center. Prices range from $3 to $ 1 0
depending on the length of the session.
Font and three others share expenses at
the California Street center to make yoga
available to everyone. "We even have classes
at 6:30 in the morning," said Font.
The center's summer classes begin June
15.
