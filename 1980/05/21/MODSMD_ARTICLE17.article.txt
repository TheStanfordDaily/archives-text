# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Allow full participation 
### 
Last Wednesday, feminist Mary Daly spoke
here and told a capacity crowd in Terman Au
ditorium that patriarchy is "the pre\ ailing relig
ion of the planet and women are the dreaded
enemy." Daly went on to explain her theory to
the audience.
Then Daly told the audience that she would
answer questions only from the women in the
audience because her experience at this sort of
thing in the past had taught her that women ask
more pertinent and incisive questions which cut
to the heart of her theory. Men. she told the
audience, even when well-intentioned, tend to
ask superficial questions which would only slow
her sophisticated presentation. In short, she im
plied that men don't understand her brand of
feminism well enough to ask intelligent ques
tions.
Now. there is certainly nothing wrong with
Mary Daly believing this. And she is certainly
free to conduct her question and answer ses
sions as she wishes. But. we think it is highly
improper for organizations here, supported by

student funds, to exclude students categorically
from participation in events they help fund.
The Women's Center, ASSU Speakers
Bureau, Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues, the Center for Research on
Women and the Political Science Department
all lent their good names to Daly's appearance
here. All of these organizations are supported
by funds drawn from the student body at large.
Thus, the event was funded by both men and
women, in order to pro\ ide them with a feminist
voice to listen to and learn from. Part of that
learning experience was denied to the majority
of Stanford students strictly on the basis of their
sex.
To us, this smacks of sexism and separatism,
the \ ery things we are led to understand speak
ers such as Mary Daly oppose.
Daly is free to say and think what she pleases,
but we urge all campus organizations to screen
more closely those speakers they sponsor, to
make sure thev see fit to allow the entire com
munity to participate in their activities.
