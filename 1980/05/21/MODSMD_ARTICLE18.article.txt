## Credit protection suffers 
### 
The presssure is easing in the
money market. The Federal Re
serve Board indicated last week
that it is going to lift some of the
regulations it recently imposed
to create the credit crunch.
Spokesmen for some major
banks voiced their approval of
the move, saying that the
measure had been uncalled for
and doomed from the start.
Banks and savings institutions
around the country are using the
rapid drop in interest rates to at
tract new business. Tie up your
money in a certificate of deposit,
they advise, before the rates go
down further. High interest rates
for savings will soon be history,
but it seems that we will be stuck
with higher costs for quite some
time to come.
We, the consumers, have been
made the victims of circumstance
once again. The credit com
panies were quick to pass along
the costs of the government's re
strictions, but now, when the
government is easing the pres
sure, the credit companies are
still imposing new fees and rates.
Many credit card issuers used
the credit pinch as an excuse for
raising their interest rates as high
as the law allowed. Others raised
their minimum payment level
and restricted approval of new
credit applications. The impres
sion was made that the lenders
took all available steps to tighten
credit. The fact is. they did not.
The actions taken by the credit
card companies only went as far
as necessary to maximize their
profit — no farther. Then, hav
ing raised the rates and the
minimum payment schedules,
lenders took aim against the
biggest obstacle that stood bet
ween them and higher profits —
consumer protection — even
while alternative belt-tightening
measures remained.
At the height of the nation's
credit problems, lenders were
simulataneously promoting the
use of credit and advocating the
suspension or elimination of
consumer protection laws.
Citibank, the nation's second
largest bank, publicly took the
position that the laws themselves

were causing inflation, yet it con
tinued its independent promo
tional campaign to encourage
the use of its Master Charge.
Sears Roebuck and Co.. while'
it raised its minimum payment
schedule, also encouraged in
creased use of credit by sending
unsolicited credit card applica
tions through the mail. It evep
offered a $5 gift certificate to
anyone who submitted a com
pleted application within 30
days. This hardly shows a com
mitment to restricting credit.
Responding to the presiden
tial mandate and to the pressure
of the credit companies, the Fed
eral Reserve Board announced
that it was looking for ways to
suspend part of the Truth-in-
Lending Law. It wanted to allow
lenders to raise rates and alter
payment schedules retroactively
and without notice to their cus
tomers. As it turned out. the len
ders were allowed to change
their terms of credit after the
money had been borrowed,
something that should not have
been tolerated.
Although some cost increases
may have been warranted at the
time, the situation was only tem
porary. Nevertheless, any
changes made — from raising the
rates to altering the entire
debtor-creditor relationship —
are likely to remain a part of the
system long after the initial jus
tification for the change has dis
appeared. During the drought,
for example, water rates in the
Bay area rose through a series of
increases and surcharges; even
when the rain started to fall, the
prices didn't.
Higher costs were not the only
goal of the card issuers, for their
ultimate target for destruction
seemed to be the collection of
consumer protection laws that
constrain them.
It is not unreasonable to re
quire lenders to disclose their
terms prior to lending, and then
to expect them to stick to those
terms. Nor is it out of line to ex
pect lenders to adhere to fair bil
ling practices, or to retrain from
exceding limits on the interest
they charge. But credit card is

suers demanded that these re
quirements be lifted as part of
the increased cost of lending,
and. to an unsettling degree, the
government acceded to these
demands.
A survey of the damage done
by the credit crunch will show
some recalled credit cards, some
increased interest rates and some
advanced repayment schedules.
The most serious casualty of all,
though, is the stability of con
sumer protection. That substan
tial body of laws, introduced to
our society in order to balance
the power of corporate lenders
and individual borrowers, faced
its first real challenge under
pressure, and it yielded too eas
ily. The experience of the past
two months has shown that,
when the chips are down, the
first things to go will be the rights
of the consumers.

The presssure is easing in the
money market. The Federal Re
serve Board indicated last week
that it is going to lift some of the
regulations it recently imposed
to create the credit crunch.
Spokesmen for some major
banks voiced their approval of
the move, saying that the
measure had been uncalled for
and doomed from the start.
Banks and savings institutions
around the country are using the
rapid drop in interest rates to at
tract new business. Tie up your
money in a certificate of deposit,
they advise, before the rates go
down further. High interest rates
for savings will soon be history,
but it seems that we will be stuck
with higher costs for quite some
time to come.
We, the consumers, have been
made the victims of circumstance
once again. The credit com
panies were quick to pass along
the costs of the government's re
strictions, but now, when the
government is easing the pres
sure, the credit companies are
still imposing new fees and rates.
Many credit card issuers used
the credit pinch as an excuse for
raising their interest rates as high
as the law allowed. Others raised
their minimum payment level
and restricted approval of new
credit applications. The impres
sion was made that the lenders
took all available steps to tighten
credit. The fact is. they did not.
The actions taken by the credit
card companies only went as far
as necessary to maximize their
profit — no farther. Then, hav
ing raised the rates and the
minimum payment schedules,
lenders took aim against the
biggest obstacle that stood bet
ween them and higher profits —
consumer protection — even
while alternative belt-tightening
measures remained.
At the height of the nation's
credit problems, lenders were
simulataneously promoting the
use of credit and advocating the
suspension or elimination of
consumer protection laws.
Citibank, the nation's second
largest bank, publicly took the
position that the laws themselves

were causing inflation, yet it con
tinued its independent promo
tional campaign to encourage
the use of its Master Charge.
Sears Roebuck and Co.. while'
it raised its minimum payment
schedule, also encouraged in
creased use of credit by sending
unsolicited credit card applica
tions through the mail. It evep
offered a $5 gift certificate to
anyone who submitted a com
pleted application within 30
days. This hardly shows a com
mitment to restricting credit.
Responding to the presiden
tial mandate and to the pressure
of the credit companies, the Fed
eral Reserve Board announced
that it was looking for ways to
suspend part of the Truth-in-
Lending Law. It wanted to allow
lenders to raise rates and alter
payment schedules retroactively
and without notice to their cus
tomers. As it turned out. the len
ders were allowed to change
their terms of credit after the
money had been borrowed,
something that should not have
been tolerated.
Although some cost increases
may have been warranted at the
time, the situation was only tem
porary. Nevertheless, any
changes made — from raising the
rates to altering the entire
debtor-creditor relationship —
are likely to remain a part of the
system long after the initial jus
tification for the change has dis
appeared. During the drought,
for example, water rates in the
Bay area rose through a series of
increases and surcharges; even
when the rain started to fall, the
prices didn't.
