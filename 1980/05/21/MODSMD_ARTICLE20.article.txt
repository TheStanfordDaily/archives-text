# Remember war's blood and bullets

In her column of May 12, Pam Howes
wrote in the Daily, "the United States in
is still a world power, caught in global
entanglements and commitments that re
quire it on occasion to put its muscle where
its mouth is. Diplomacy on this scale makes
arguments like 'We should not shed blood
for oil' naive." In an Escondido Village park
ing lot, 1 often see a car with a bumper sticker
that says "Nuke Khomeini."
Although these statements vary somewhat
in the responsibility of their phrasing, they
share the outlook that it may be necessary to
murder certain people for the United States
to reach its political goals. My concern in
today'scolumn is not the validity of this opin
ion. but the language in which it is expressed.
In short, 1 think that in America the lan
guage we have developed for discussing war
has become unnecessarily impoverished and
colorless. Perhaps the reason for this is that
most of us have never seen a war, much less a
war on our own soil. But, in any case, it's not
too late to rework our vocabulary of aggres
sion.
For example, a common feature of modern
warfare is burning children and other civi
lians alive. Why not, then, speak of "global
entanglements that require us, on occasion,
to burn children alive"?
Or take the concept of terrorism. Most
readers, I assume, share with me complete
opposition to terrorism; the image of ter
rorists machine-kjunnintz a bus full of inno

cent people to gain some political goal fills us
with horror and anger. Yet, when one thinks
about it. war is also the use of violence (often
against the innocent) to gain political ends.
Why not, then, speak of "large scale interna
tional terrorism to defend our vital in
terests?"
It's not only our language, but our whole
approach to military violence that has been
overly rationalized. This is evident in the
"Nuke Khomeini" suggestion. As an alterna
tive, I suggest we occupy Iran, and then start
loading Iranians into boxcars and gassing
them. This plan would have at least two ad
vantages over the nuclear alternative. First, it
would be more drawn out, so those who died
would have more time to regret their citizen
ship in a country that tried topush the United
States around. Second, it would be more
moral because we probably couldn't kill as
many people this way.
Surely the greatest offender in the news
peak of global brutality is the word "de
fense,"' a central concept in the thinking of
Howes. 1 am not a pacifist; I believe the
United States needs a defense and war must
sometimes be waged. But the word "de
fense" becomes meaningless if it is expanded
to mean preservation of everything anyone
labels a national interest; by the latter defini
tion, every one of Adolph Hitler's moves was
defensive. Foreign intervention is offense,
whether it is carried out by the Soviet Union
or the United States.

In sum, I regret the option of making war
like pronouncements and thinking warlike
thoughts without thinking about war. I think
that if university presidents and Stanford
students are going to use phrases like "vital
interests" and "putting our muscle where our
mouth is," they ought to own up to the full
consequences of those weasly little cliches.
Next time you're thinking about the draft
or about "military solutions" to foreign pol-

icy problems, think on the one hand about
traveling to some impoverished country and
murdering its occupants. And think on the
other hand about yourself and those you love
being blown apart by bullets or dying of radi
ation poisoning. These things are a big part of
the draft and military solutions, and 1 think
it's time to give them the credit they deserve.

too late to rework our vocabulary of aggres
sion.
For example, a common feature of modern
warfare is burning children and other civi
lians alive. Why not, then, speak of "global
entanglements that require us, on occasion,
to burn children alive"?
Or take the concept of terrorism. Most
readers, I assume, share with me complete
opposition to terrorism; the image of ter
rorists machine-kjunnintz a bus full of inno

cent people to gain some political goal fills us
with horror and anger. Yet, when one thinks
about it. war is also the use of violence (often
against the innocent) to gain political ends.
Why not, then, speak of "large scale interna
tional terrorism to defend our vital in
terests?"
It's not only our language, but our whole
approach to military violence that has been
overly rationalized. This is evident in the
"Nuke Khomeini" suggestion. As an alterna
tive, I suggest we occupy Iran, and then start
loading Iranians into boxcars and gassing
them. This plan would have at least two ad
vantages over the nuclear alternative. First, it
would be more drawn out, so those who died
would have more time to regret their citizen
ship in a country that tried topush the United
States around. Second, it would be more
moral because we probably couldn't kill as
many people this way.
Surely the greatest offender in the news
peak of global brutality is the word "de
fense,"' a central concept in the thinking of
Howes. 1 am not a pacifist; I believe the
United States needs a defense and war must
sometimes be waged. But the word "de
fense" becomes meaningless if it is expanded
to mean preservation of everything anyone
labels a national interest; by the latter defini
tion, every one of Adolph Hitler's moves was
defensive. Foreign intervention is offense,
whether it is carried out by the Soviet Union
or the United States.

In sum, I regret the option of making war
like pronouncements and thinking warlike
thoughts without thinking about war. I think
that if university presidents and Stanford
students are going to use phrases like "vital
interests" and "putting our muscle where our
mouth is," they ought to own up to the full
consequences of those weasly little cliches.
Next time you're thinking about the draft
or about "military solutions" to foreign pol-

icy problems, think on the one hand about
traveling to some impoverished country and
murdering its occupants. And think on the
other hand about yourself and those you love
being blown apart by bullets or dying of radi
ation poisoning. These things are a big part of
the draft and military solutions, and 1 think
it's time to give them the credit they deserve.
