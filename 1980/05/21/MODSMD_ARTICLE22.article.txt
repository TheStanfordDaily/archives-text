## Daily's attitude intolerant, blatantly sexist 
### 
Last Wednesday, this campus had the rare privilege of
a visit by Prof. Mary Daly, a radical feminist rhetorician,
theologian and author. As one of the few men who
attended her eloquent and at times moving talk against
the evils of the cult of patriarchy, I was deeply affected
by much of what she said. Nevertheless, I feel compelled
to express some of my less favorable reactions in as clear
and fair-minded a way as I can.
Since I am only a man, to be sure, I cannot expect my
position to meet with a receptive hearing from my
feminist sisters, who will probably dismiss my account as
biased or even as downright deceitful. In anticipation of
this attitude, I invite readers to correct me where I am
mistaken and have misinterpreted the lecture.
There can be no doubt that Daly is right in many of her
observations about the existence of a pervasive world
conspiracy, dating from ancient times, to subordinate,
denigrate and enslave women. They have been systemat
ically abused by social institutions that have imprisoned
them in so-called "arranged marriages." Their bodies
have sometimes been deformed in the name of "erotic
beauty." such as foot-binding, and sometimes have even
been mutilated in a depraved quest for "feminine ser
viceability," for example. African genital mutilation.
Worst of all. their lives have often been forfeited when
they have dared to oppose these insidious traditions:
European witch-burning.
None of these acts perpetrated by male-dominated
societies is morally justifiable, nor would any compas
sionate man regard them as acceptable today. On the
contrary, we must join shoulder to shoulder with women
everywhere to eradicate these evils in all parts of the
world.
Unfortunately, Daly and her cohorts of wild-eyed
Hags (Daly's term for radical feminists) are far from
wanting the help and cooperation of any man, however

well-intentioned he may be. Indeed, as she emphasized
in her book, Gyn /Ecology: the Metaethics of Radical
Feminism, and reaffirmed in her speech, every male is
tainted — via guilt by association — with the sins of his
forefathers. Regardless of his beliefs, his values, his feel
ings, a man cannot help being criminally oppressive of
women, even when he pretends, hypocritically, that he
wishes to be otherwise. From the very moment of his
conception, it seems, a male baby is destined to be the
enemy of all that is female.
As proof of this startlingly intolerant, blatantly sexist
attitude on Daly's part, consider the following passage
from her book:
Women continue to be intimidated by the label anti
male. Some feel a false need to draw distinctions, for
example: "I am anti-patriarchal but not anti-male." The
courage to be logical - the courage to name - would
require that we admit to ourselves that males and males
only are the originators, planners, controllers, and
legitimators of patriarchy. . . . "Thinking that our man is
the exception" . . . hides this fact.
According to Daly, once an enlightened Hag has seen
through the sham that corrupts all purported
"egalitarianism," she is then in a position to repudiate
any possibility of genuine friendship or love between the
sexes:
(The Hag's) style reflects her new-found capacity to
recognize (men's) intent in its seemingly innocent and
chillingly familiar manifestations (their chivalry, their
help, their care, their art, their romance, their respect, their
rewards, their blessings, their love.)
In this manner (for the book goes on and on in the
same vein), Daly completely cuts off all hope of
acccommodation, of harmonious interaction between
women and men. Could it be that she will settle for
nothing less than the total conquest of the male sex. its

domination by females and eventually even its elimina
tion from the planet?
By far the most shocking revelation, for me, of Daly's
"man-iacal" hatred of all that is male occurred at the end
of her lecture last Wednesday. After having delivered an
almost two-hour-long harangue about the evils of mas
culinity, she finally opened herself to questions from the
audience, but with the specific stipulation that no man's
question would he recognized!
Claiming that listening to males' opinions would only
confuse the issues, Daly set up an iron wall of intransi
gent silence between herself and the handful of men
scattered through the large, overwhelmingly female au
dience. I have rarely felt so insulted, so stereotyped, so
utterly dehumanized. My money (contributed through
fee assessments for the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
Women's Center) had helped to bring this speaker to our
campus, and yet here 1 was being denied a chance to
speak, simply on account of my biological gender.
Not only was this intransigence on Daly's part unfair
and arrogant in the extreme, but it also smacked of moral
cowardice such as, I dare say, no truly "wild," self
respecting Hag would ever have been guilty of.
In my opinion, intelligent women should not follow
this line of so-called "radical feminism," which rules out
a priori any possibility of friendships with such good and
trustworthy men as may happen to exist. Once this point
has been granted, it becomes obvious that the kind of
axe-wielding fanaticism that Daly represents is actually
anti-woman in a profound sense.
Women and men need each other, I submit, and this
need is part of our existential being-in-the-world, no
matter what the dogmatic Dalyites may pretend to be the
case. But with "friends" like Mary Daly, who needs
enemies?

Women and men need each other, I submit, and this
need is part of our existential being-in-the-world, no
matter what the dogmatic Dalyites may pretend to be the
case. But with "friends" like Mary Daly, who needs
enemies?
(Ned Beach is a graduate student in religious studies.)
Last Wednesday, this campus had the rare privilege of
a visit by Prof. Mary Daly, a radical feminist rhetorician,
theologian and author. As one of the few men who
attended her eloquent and at times moving talk against
the evils of the cult of patriarchy, I was deeply affected
by much of what she said. Nevertheless, I feel compelled
to express some of my less favorable reactions in as clear
and fair-minded a way as I can.
Since I am only a man, to be sure, I cannot expect my
position to meet with a receptive hearing from my
feminist sisters, who will probably dismiss my account as
biased or even as downright deceitful. In anticipation of
this attitude, I invite readers to correct me where I am
mistaken and have misinterpreted the lecture.
There can be no doubt that Daly is right in many of her
observations about the existence of a pervasive world
conspiracy, dating from ancient times, to subordinate,
denigrate and enslave women. They have been systemat
ically abused by social institutions that have imprisoned
them in so-called "arranged marriages." Their bodies
have sometimes been deformed in the name of "erotic
beauty." such as foot-binding, and sometimes have even
been mutilated in a depraved quest for "feminine ser
viceability," for example. African genital mutilation.
Worst of all. their lives have often been forfeited when
they have dared to oppose these insidious traditions:
European witch-burning.
None of these acts perpetrated by male-dominated
societies is morally justifiable, nor would any compas
sionate man regard them as acceptable today. On the
contrary, we must join shoulder to shoulder with women
everywhere to eradicate these evils in all parts of the
world.
Unfortunately, Daly and her cohorts of wild-eyed
Hags (Daly's term for radical feminists) are far from
wanting the help and cooperation of any man, however

well-intentioned he may be. Indeed, as she emphasized
in her book, Gyn /Ecology: the Metaethics of Radical
Feminism, and reaffirmed in her speech, every male is
tainted — via guilt by association — with the sins of his
forefathers. Regardless of his beliefs, his values, his feel
ings, a man cannot help being criminally oppressive of
women, even when he pretends, hypocritically, that he
wishes to be otherwise. From the very moment of his
conception, it seems, a male baby is destined to be the
enemy of all that is female.
As proof of this startlingly intolerant, blatantly sexist
attitude on Daly's part, consider the following passage
from her book:
Women continue to be intimidated by the label anti
male. Some feel a false need to draw distinctions, for
example: "I am anti-patriarchal but not anti-male." The
courage to be logical - the courage to name - would
require that we admit to ourselves that males and males
only are the originators, planners, controllers, and
legitimators of patriarchy. . . . "Thinking that our man is
the exception" . . . hides this fact.
According to Daly, once an enlightened Hag has seen
through the sham that corrupts all purported
"egalitarianism," she is then in a position to repudiate
any possibility of genuine friendship or love between the
sexes:
(The Hag's) style reflects her new-found capacity to
recognize (men's) intent in its seemingly innocent and
chillingly familiar manifestations (their chivalry, their
help, their care, their art, their romance, their respect, their
rewards, their blessings, their love.)
In this manner (for the book goes on and on in the
same vein), Daly completely cuts off all hope of
acccommodation, of harmonious interaction between
women and men. Could it be that she will settle for
nothing less than the total conquest of the male sex. its

domination by females and eventually even its elimina
tion from the planet?
By far the most shocking revelation, for me, of Daly's
"man-iacal" hatred of all that is male occurred at the end
of her lecture last Wednesday. After having delivered an
almost two-hour-long harangue about the evils of mas
culinity, she finally opened herself to questions from the
audience, but with the specific stipulation that no man's
question would he recognized!
Claiming that listening to males' opinions would only
confuse the issues, Daly set up an iron wall of intransi
gent silence between herself and the handful of men
scattered through the large, overwhelmingly female au
dience. I have rarely felt so insulted, so stereotyped, so
utterly dehumanized. My money (contributed through
fee assessments for the ASSU Speakers Bureau and the
Women's Center) had helped to bring this speaker to our
campus, and yet here 1 was being denied a chance to
speak, simply on account of my biological gender.
Not only was this intransigence on Daly's part unfair
and arrogant in the extreme, but it also smacked of moral
cowardice such as, I dare say, no truly "wild," self
respecting Hag would ever have been guilty of.
In my opinion, intelligent women should not follow
this line of so-called "radical feminism," which rules out
a priori any possibility of friendships with such good and
trustworthy men as may happen to exist. Once this point
has been granted, it becomes obvious that the kind of
axe-wielding fanaticism that Daly represents is actually
anti-woman in a profound sense.
