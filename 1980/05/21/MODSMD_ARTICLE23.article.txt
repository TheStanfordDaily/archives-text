Policy mistake
The running of Wade French's
letter to the editor on May 1 5
was a terrible mistake in Daily
editorial policy. French, a
member of the gay community,
was upset at John Mason's article
expressing some concern about
the recently held Gay Awareness
Week (Daily, May 7). But in
stead of addressing the points
brought out in Mason's article.
Wade focused on one statement
and then described an argument
he and Mason had last year when
Wade spoke before the French '
House.
The most important issue pre
sented here is not gay rights but
the willingness of the Daily to
print an opinion that primarily
focuses on a personal attack of
an individual instead of a well
reasoned response to that indi
vidual's arguments.
The Daily commands a special
respect in the Stanford commun
ity. And Bill Burger is absolutely
right in taking steps, as he re
cently did against members of
the Chaparral, to ensure that this
respect is maintained. But along
with the benefits of being able to

influence the members of this
community comes a serious re
sponsibility to guard against its
misuse.
Publishing Wade's letter was a
lapse in maintaining this guard
because it served no purpose but
to embarrass Mason. I hope it
was a momentary lapse. In an
intellectual community, we
should be willing to have our
public statements analyzed and
criticized or supported. But we
should also be free from the fear
that our personal integrity, and
not our intellectual beliefs, will
be a fair target of public attack.
To undo some of the damage
done to Mason's reputation, I
would like to mention a few of
the services he has provided to
the Stanford community this
year. As one of the most active
members of the Commitee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US),
lie helped draw up the recom
mendations approved by the
Board of Trustees to strengthen
the academic requirements for
graduating from Stanford. Also
on C-US. he has worked hard to
improve the African and Afro-
American Studies program and

to keep it from being discon
tinued. Finally, he has \Vorked
hard for the Stanford Daily, and
the time he ppts into his columns
make them stand out for their wit
and their well-reasoned com
ments.
I have a great respect for the
Stanford Daily, for indeed it is
one of the best college newspap
ers in America. However, I hope
that we shall not see another per
sonal attack of the kind in
Thursday's paper again. I trust
the Daily will keep its careful
policy of maintaining profes
sional reporting in its news,
sports and entertainment sec
tions; and that it will resume its
careful policy of publishing re
sponsible letters to the editor.

Financing of frats
In his column of May 16, "Ro
tate Fraternity Houses," Alan
Siff asks, "By what fiat do the
frats have the privilege to occupy
these beautiful University
owned houses year after year?
. . . Why not allow everyone the

chance?" Using a little history,
I'll answer that question for
Kappa Sigma.
Around 1960, Trustee Tex
Middleton negotiated with the
University to have the Campus
Drive cluster of fraternities built
(Kappa Sigma. SAE, Phi Delts
and Theta DelLs).
In the case of Kappa Sigma,
the cost of building was esti
mated at about $250,000. The
agreement made was that Kappa
Sigma alumni would raise
$ 125,000 to be given to the Uni
versity for building our house
with the understanding that pre
ference for residence be given to
members of Kappa Sigma. The
balance of the building cost was
financed through government
loans that the rent at Kappa
Sigma helps to pay off, just as
dorm rents help pay off the loans
used for dorm construction.
In addition, Kappa Sigma
alumni raised $25,000 to pay for
the fraternity's original furnish
ings, and in the time since the
house was built, alumni money
and fraternity manpower have
created many of the facilities that
make the house so desircable.

Similar deals were made with the
alumni of the other Campus
Drive cluster fraternities and, I
imagine, those on Lake
Lagunita.
The fact, therefore, that
fraternities are housed where
they are is not unjust, but is
rather the result of houses
being built largely fraternity
money expressly for the use of
fraternity members.

and fraternity manpower have
created many of the facilities that
make the house so desircable.

Similar deals were made with the
alumni of the other Campus
Drive cluster fraternities and, I
imagine, those on Lake
Lagunita.
The fact, therefore, that
fraternities are housed where
they are is not unjust, but is
rather the result of houses
being built largely fraternity
money expressly for the use of
fraternity members.

Policy mistake
The running of Wade French's
letter to the editor on May 1 5
was a terrible mistake in Daily
editorial policy. French, a
member of the gay community,
was upset at John Mason's article
expressing some concern about
the recently held Gay Awareness
Week (Daily, May 7). But in
stead of addressing the points
brought out in Mason's article.
Wade focused on one statement
and then described an argument
he and Mason had last year when
Wade spoke before the French '
House.
The most important issue pre
sented here is not gay rights but
the willingness of the Daily to
print an opinion that primarily
focuses on a personal attack of
an individual instead of a well
reasoned response to that indi
vidual's arguments.
The Daily commands a special
respect in the Stanford commun
ity. And Bill Burger is absolutely
right in taking steps, as he re
cently did against members of
the Chaparral, to ensure that this
respect is maintained. But along
with the benefits of being able to

influence the members of this
community comes a serious re
sponsibility to guard against its
misuse.
Publishing Wade's letter was a
lapse in maintaining this guard
because it served no purpose but
to embarrass Mason. I hope it
was a momentary lapse. In an
intellectual community, we
should be willing to have our
public statements analyzed and
criticized or supported. But we
should also be free from the fear
that our personal integrity, and
not our intellectual beliefs, will
be a fair target of public attack.
To undo some of the damage
done to Mason's reputation, I
would like to mention a few of
the services he has provided to
the Stanford community this
year. As one of the most active
members of the Commitee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US),
lie helped draw up the recom
mendations approved by the
Board of Trustees to strengthen
the academic requirements for
graduating from Stanford. Also
on C-US. he has worked hard to
improve the African and Afro-
American Studies program and

to keep it from being discon
tinued. Finally, he has \Vorked
hard for the Stanford Daily, and
the time he ppts into his columns
make them stand out for their wit
and their well-reasoned com
ments.
I have a great respect for the
Stanford Daily, for indeed it is
one of the best college newspap
ers in America. However, I hope
that we shall not see another per
sonal attack of the kind in
Thursday's paper again. I trust
the Daily will keep its careful
policy of maintaining profes
sional reporting in its news,
sports and entertainment sec
tions; and that it will resume its
careful policy of publishing re
sponsible letters to the editor.

Financing of frats
In his column of May 16, "Ro
tate Fraternity Houses," Alan
Siff asks, "By what fiat do the
frats have the privilege to occupy
these beautiful University
owned houses year after year?
. . . Why not allow everyone the

chance?" Using a little history,
I'll answer that question for
Kappa Sigma.
Around 1960, Trustee Tex
Middleton negotiated with the
University to have the Campus
Drive cluster of fraternities built
(Kappa Sigma. SAE, Phi Delts
and Theta DelLs).
In the case of Kappa Sigma,
the cost of building was esti
mated at about $250,000. The
agreement made was that Kappa
Sigma alumni would raise
$ 125,000 to be given to the Uni
versity for building our house
with the understanding that pre
ference for residence be given to
members of Kappa Sigma. The
balance of the building cost was
financed through government
loans that the rent at Kappa
Sigma helps to pay off, just as
dorm rents help pay off the loans
used for dorm construction.
In addition, Kappa Sigma
alumni raised $25,000 to pay for
the fraternity's original furnish
ings, and in the time since the
house was built, alumni money
and fraternity manpower have
created many of the facilities that
make the house so desircable.

Similar deals were made with the
alumni of the other Campus
Drive cluster fraternities and, I
imagine, those on Lake
