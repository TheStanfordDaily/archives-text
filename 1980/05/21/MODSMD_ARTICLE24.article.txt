# Netters demolish Clemson in Ga.
## 
### Ivan Maisel Staff Writer 
The rain finally let up in
Athens, Ga. yesterday but top
seeded Stanford didn't, steam
rolling Sth-seeded Clemson 7-2
in the quarterfinals of the NCAA
Tennis Championships.
Under leaden skies that broke
late in the afternoon, the Cards
extended their undefeated string
of singles matches to 1 2, advanc
ing to today's semifinal match
against sth-seeded Pepperdine.
The Waves were, besides the
sunshine, the other big surprise
of the day, upsetting 4th-seeded
UCLA 5-2 with strong singles
play.
In the other semifinal match,
2nd-seeded USC will try to
break the spell 3rd-seeded
UC-Berkeley has cast upon
them all season long. Cal beat
the Trojans 5-4 both at home
and in Los Angeles and a third
win today at the University of
Georgia tennis complex would
assure the Bears a chance at their
first NCAA tennis title.
Pepperdine is the only team of
the top eight seeds that the Cards
have not met this year. An April
22nd match scheduled here was
rained out. Stanford coach Dick
Gould does not feel that will
have an effect on his team.
"It's irrelevant. It's a whole
new thing here," Gould said.
"Eiven if we had played them at
home, their No. 1 player. Rocky
Vasquez, had already gone home
for the year, so we wouldn't have
seen them at full strength."
Yesterday's victory coupled
with Monday's 6-0 shutout of
16th-seeded Utah would nor
mally make Stanford look invin
cible. Such is the division of ta
lent in the tournament, however,
that the first six seeds are a cut
above the following 10.
"The teams we have played
are not bad," Gould said, "but
we should have won. On any
given day one of their guys
maybe could beat one of ours,
but we haven't played badly."
Tournament rules dictate that
the lineup a team begins with is
the one they must play in every
match, except in the case of an
injury. Gould made two changes
from the regular-season lineup,
inserting freshman Jim Gurfein
in the No. 6 slot in place of Jeff
Arons and switching the order of
the Nos. 2 and 3 doubles teams.

The coach discounted the sig
nificance of the lineup changes.
"The lineup is the least impor
tant thing. What's important is
how we play as a team. 11 we go
do the job we can. we'll win.
"The kids will have to rise to
the occasion," tiould added.
"Pepperdine is a scary team.
They beat USC twice and Cal
beat them twice, and now they
beat UCLA for the first time.
They're sky-high. We have great
respect for them, but we are cap
able of beating them."
Sophomore Jeff Arons, play
ing No. 3 doubles with Tim
Mayotte, fell and bruised his hip
severely enough to warrant retir
ing from the match. However,
Gould expects him back for to
day's play.
"There are no broken bones,"
he said, "lie's sore, but he hit
tonight and should be okay."
