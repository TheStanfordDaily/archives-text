Islanders get ready
UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -
It started at his locker, in the
middle of the two rows that line
the front room in the New York
Islanders' clubhouse. Left wing
Clark Gillies faced the first
bunch of questioners there,
made it another five feet before
being cornered by somebody
else, then travelled another 10
feet before he was asked tor
"just one more" answer.
He was asked, for roughly the
dozenth time of a steamy even
ing, the reasons for the Islanders'
3-1 lead over the Philadelphia
Flyers in the National Hockey
League's championship series.
"You've got to look at the
power play," he said, speaking of
a specialty team that has pro
duced 11 goals in 24 chances.
"You've got to look at situations
where we've really needed goal
and had everybody diggingft>r it.
"You've got to remember
we've played really well in the

defensive end; the defense has
been super," continued Gillies,
"and (goalie) Billy Smith's been
superb, as he has the whole
playoffs."
If the Islanders can manage
that one more game in Philadel
phia tomorrow night, if the Is
landers take Game Five — or
Six, or Seven, for that matter —
they will have won the first Stan
ley Cup of their eight-year NHL
history. The team that has borne
the hated "choke" label for the
last three seasons can tinally
hang it around the necks ot
another team.
The Flyers, understandably,
are downcast. Their regular
season championship, and their
record 35-game unbeaten
streak, are in danger of being
mere highlights of a season that
fell short of its overall objective.
That's why, says center and as
sistant Philadelphia coach

Bobby Clarke, "We can't look at
it (Game Five) like we're playing
for the Stanley Cup. We've just
got to look at it like the next
game. Play one game, one night,
and if you win that, you worry
about the next game."
Recruits
Eight top women track and
field athletes havc.decided to at
tend Stanford this coming fall,
including the best distance run
ner and best hurdler among the
high school ranks.
Ellen Lyons, considered the
No. 1 high school distance pros
pect in the nation, from Boise,
Idaho, and Susan Burrus, a na
tional prep co-record holder in
the 300-meter hurdles, from
Bellvue, Washington, have both
decided to further their illustri
ous careers on the Farm.
The other athletes are: long
jump/high jump specialist Mar

cia Martin from Villanova,
Pennsylvania, distance runner
Dana Price from Denver, discus
thrower Carol Cady from Los
Alamos, New Mexico, cross
country runner Diane Gong
from San Francisco, high jumper
Lisa Gertch of Aurora. Neb
raska, and long jumper Lynnae
Warren from Albuquerque.
