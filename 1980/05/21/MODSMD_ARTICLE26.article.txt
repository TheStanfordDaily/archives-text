# Baseball strike nears deadline
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)
Baseball faces a potentially dis
astrous player strike at midnight
tomorrow over stalled contract
negotiations, but the issues
aren't the traditional ones usu
ally found in a labor
management showdown.
Salaries and money are not at
the heart of the current disag
reement. The basic collective
bargaining agreement over
which the two sides are squabbl
ing sets down the conditions of
employment hut does not deal
with player salaries, except tor
the minimum each major leaguer
must be paid. In the agreement
signed fn July 1976, the
minimum salary was set at
$19,000 for that season and
1977, and moved to $21,000 for
1978 and 1979. That item is the
only one in the basic agreement
dealing directly with money.
Individual player salaries are
negotiated between players and
their clubs and are not a strike
issue. There are almost as many
contract variations as there are
major league performers. Some
players are paid over the 178-
day season. Others prefer a 12-
month salary arrangement, and
some even take their entire sal
ary in a single payment at the
start of the year.
Some players have built-in
strike protection in their con
tracts with clauses that call for
them to continue to be paid in
the event of a player walkout.
Pete Rose of the Philadelphia
Phillies and Rod Carew of the
California Angels reportedly
have such agreements.
Also protected during the
strike are the major league um
pires, who will continue to be

paid even though they are not
working. That provision was in
cluded in the settlement of their
seven-week strike last season.
Managers and coaches share
in the pension benefits of the
players association but are not
members of the union. Ostensi
bly, they will continue drawing
their salaries, as will other front
office personnel.
Negotiators are near agree
ment on most but not all of the
matters dealt with in the basic
agreement. Those issues, besides
minimum salary, include player
pensions, health and safety ques
tions, salary arbitration lan
guage. the disciplinary system
and other similar items.
The issue over which the two
sides are deadlocked is compen
sation for tree agents. That sim
ply is a demand by the owners
that they receive replacement
players for free agents who sign
with other teams. The players
fear that agreeing to such a pro
vision would put a significant
dent in the free agent system and
reduce player movement to
trade arrangements. Specifically,
they fear any limits on their free
agency.
Federal mediator Kenneth
Moffett will make one more ef
fort to break the deadlock today
as he summons the two sides
back to the bargaining table, 34
hours before the strike deadline
of midnight tomorrow.
Only once before in the his
tory of baseball has the game had
a general strike. That was in
1972, when the start of the sea
son was delayed 1 3 days and 36
games were canceled because of
a walkout over pension and
health plan improvements.
