# Italy votes for Olympics
## 
### 
The Italian National Olympic Committee rebuf
fed the pro-boycott stance of its government and
voted to attend this summer's Moscow Games,
leaving three major U.S. allies still to make their
decisions.
The Olympic committees of Japan, Australia
and Israel. like Italy, all have their governments
leaning hard on them to announce non
participation in the Games because of the Soviet
Union's intervention in Afghanistan. The deadline
for filing entries is this Saturday.
Italy's National Olympic Committee (CONI) re

sisted the pressure, voting 29-3 with two absten
tions to send a team to Moscow.
"The Olympic Games are competitions among
individuals and not among nations, and participa
tion in them cannot in any way be considered as
acceptance of any ideology or political behavior," a
statement released by CONI said.
"The athletes have a right to full recognition of
the sacrifices they have long made to prepare for
the Olympics, and it would therefore be unjust to
take away from them an opportunity for which they
have made important life choices," the statement
said.
