## 
### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
The first three women ever to
officially represent Stanford at a
national collegiate track meet
w ill participate in the A 1 AW Na
tionals in Eugene, Oregon for
the next four days.
For freshmen Pam Donald,
Mary Osborne and Kim
Schnurpfeil, the championship
meet will provide them with the
unique opportunitv to compete
on a more stringent level than
before, according to coach
Laurel Treon.
"From the point of view of the
coaching staff, we would like to
see them perform to a level of
which they can be proud," Treon
said. "And if they do that, they
could perform well nationally,
too."

Schnurpfeil will run the 5000
meters but will he unsure of her
competition until she actually ar
rives at the meet. "At this point,
we don't know who has declared
to run the 5000," Treon
explained. It more than 24 per
sons decide to enter that event,
Schnurpfeil will run in the trial
heats tomorrow night. The final
5000 round will be held Satur
day.
"My goal depends on the
competition, and I'm not sure
how I'll fare. 1 feel like I have
good potential to improve my
time quite a bit," Schnurpfeil
said. "If they have Olympic
trials, it would be nice to make
that." Asserting that she had
been ranked "I'll just go and do
the best I can. 1 can't say (which)
place."
Osborne "should be in a fairly
competitive spot" in the javelin,
according to Treon. Ranked
sixth in the nation among all
women, Osborne said that she is
going into the meet with the
fourth best qualifying throw. The
javelin qualifying rounds will
take place tomorrow, with the fi
nals following on Saturday.
Considering her progression
throughout the season and par
ticularly within the past month,
Osborne assessed her chances
for a high finish as good. She is
also looking ahead to a regional
meet at Hayward on Monday
and the AAU senior nationals in
Los Angeles June 14 and 15. Fi
nally, since the top 12 conten
ders in each event qualify for the

June 23 and 24 Olympic Trials in
Eugene, Osborne's current na
tional ranking makes her a prime
candidate for that contest.
Donald will compete in the
long jump trials tomorrow morn
ing. Those finals will also be held
Saturday.
"She's in an extremely com
petitive event," said Treon of
Donald's situation. But, "com

ing off some less than satisfac
tory personal performances, she
is keyed for this competition and
has the potential to do quite
well," Treon added. "She has a
shot at the top 10, but it all de
pends on the exact cir
cumstances. If she can he com
petitive within the given
parameters, a high finish is pos
sible."
