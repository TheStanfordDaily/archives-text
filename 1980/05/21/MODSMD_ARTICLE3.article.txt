# Lyman offers assurances to the 'Greeks'
## 
### Kimberly Brown Staff Writer 
In his final appearance on KZSU's
Campus Conference yesterday. Presi
dent Richard Lyman assured that no
body "is trying to do away with" the
Greek system on campus.
Lyman discussed fraternities,
sororities and numerous other
campus-related issues on the program,
which originated in the early days of
the'Lyman Decade'.
"There's a great deal of concern
about some episodes this spring, as
some elements in the Greek system
have become prominently identified
with misdemeanors of one kind or
another," he said.
Turning to sororities, Lyman said
that they , like fraternities, "ought to
run as Stanford-centered enterprises."
He said the problem so far has been the
sororities' inability to establish firmly
and beyond a doubt that they are "au
tonomous and not controlled or unduly
influenced by the national organiza
tion."
Lyman also discussed the case of
former Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin, who was dismissed eight

years ago for "urging and inciting stu
dents and others to disrupt University
functions" on three occasions.
The case has drawn recent attention
because the Faculty Advisory Board is
now reconsidering Franklin's penalty,
after a Superior Court judge dismissed
one of the three charges against him.
The American Civil Liberties Union
has charged that the Advisory Board is
violating University rules for the con
duct of hearings because it has refused
to allow new testimony or oral argu
ment.
Lyman claimed yesterday that the
ACLU is "conducting a campaign on
the press to confuse the issue." He em
phasized that the Advisory Board has
been instructed by the court only to
review the penalty.
"The Advisory Board is being asked
its advice on one very specific point —
it is not being asked to reopen the
case," he said.
Lyman has applied some personal
pressure to the situation by asking the
Advisory Board to complete its pro
ceedings by the end of the month if
possible. Depending on whether the
Advisory Board completes its business.

Lyman may or may not be coming to a
decision before he leaves.
Also emerging as one of the even
ing's key topics were the recently ap
proved distribution requirements.
Lyman said he favors most of the
changes, calling the new requirements
"an improvement over the 'generalized
cafeteria : that we had."
"It would have been very difficult for
Stanford students to avoid fulfilling the
requirements without a considerable
and sustained exercise of ingenuity,"
he said.
In reference to the alleged lewd ac
tivity which took place in the men's
room of the Cummings Art Building
and led to the arrests of 10 men over
spring break, Lyman said he was only
recently aware of the situation but that
a great many warning measures had
been taken within the Art Department
prior to the arrests.
"It was an unpleasant episode, one
that could easily cause homosexuals on
campus to worry whether it was just
step one in a series of steps that could
affect them adversely," he said. How
ever, he stressed that the arrests did not
constitute discrimination against

people on grounds of their sexual pre
ference.
Discussing the University's Iranian
students who face deportation, Lyman
said the University is "doing its best to
put them in touch with the best legal
advice and specialized knowledge con
cerning immigration matters availa
ble." But, Lyman continued, "the gov
ernment has the legal right to do what
it's doing."
The University is protesting the gov
ernment's proposal to return to its ear
lier system of "strict annual visas,"
where government officials can send
students out of the country even if they
are short of their degree. With the cur
rent regulations, a visa can be con
tinued as long as the student is enrol
led.
"Aside from trying to achieve a more
sensible policy and providing some
legal help, there's not much more we
can do," he said. "Personally, I think
these moves (the government's) arc
unfortunate because they're indis
criminate," he continued.
Lyman commented upon The Stan
ford Daily hoax in which students were
accused of inserting an unauthorized
photograph into the May 2 issue of the
Daily. The students have been charged
with violating the Fundamental Stan
dard.
He called the Fundamental Standard
a very general mandate that says
"You've got to behave as a Stanford
student should behave." Lyman said he
is not sure how the charges against the
students would be handled. In theory,
either the Judicial Council or the Dean
of Student Affairs would deal with the
matter.
When asked to comment upon his
final days as Stanford's president,
Lyman noted problems within the
Medical Center — governance prob
lems and the search for a vice-president
— as issues he would like to resolve
before leaving.
As to what kind of advice he would
give to his successor, Lyman said.
"First, don't expect everybody to love
you — not all the time anyway. Second,
do all the consulting you can — and
then recognize it still won't be quite
enough. Third, don't let that ever keep
you from making a decision.
"In the last analysis, there's not
much you can do without money," he
concluded.
Lyman sees the most exciting single

thing about being president of Stanford
as the opportunity to work with an ex
traordinarily talented array of people.
"That includes students, staff mem
bers, faculty. It obviously doesn't in
clude all students, all staff members, all
faculty — but it includes a heck of a lot
of them," he said.
