Miami race riot 'under control 1
MIAMI — Miami's riot-scarred neighborhoods
were declared "under control" and downtown mer
chants reopened shuttered shops yesterday after
three-nights of racial violence that claimed 15 lives
and damaged $100 million in property.
But 250 miles away in Tampa, police said black
teenagers prowling city streets Monday night stoned
cars and looted stores. Angry slogans were spray
painted on university buildings.
Miami police, reinforced by 3600 National
Guardsmen and 200 highway patrolmen, arrested
200 more people during the night, mostly on minor
charges such as violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew.
That brought the total arrested since Saturday night
to 936.
"It's all quiet," said Miami Police spokeswoman
Cynthia Barry as the city's northwest skyline was free
of smoke plumes for the first time since the weekend.
"No major incidents occurred last night." she said.
"It'squiet. . .it's under control. Everything is back to
normal as of now."
The mob violence was triggered Saturday when an
all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four white former
Dade County policemen who had been accused in the
beating death of Arthur McDuffie. a 33-year-old
black Miami insurance man.
French summit rouses criticism
PARIS — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
briefed U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman on his
brief summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev,
which roused controversy in France and criticism in
Washington.
Hartman spent 45 minutes with Giscard d'Estaing
at his Elysses Palace headquarters yesterday and
made no statement to reporters upon leasing.
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet said he
would report to Parliament today on the meeting in
Warsaw, Poland. The Socialists. Giscard d'Estaing*s
main opposition, demanded a full debate but the
government said it would refuse.
In Washington, Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
criticized Giscard d'Estaing for failing to consult
NATO allies before the meeting on Monday.
"This is not conducive ... to the kind of mutual
confidence and consultation which we all seemed to
agree last week were essential to alliance solidarity
and unity," Muskie said.
There was no immediate reaction in Paris to Mus
kie's criticism, but a vigorous debate raged over
whether Giscard d'Estaing should have broken ranks
with his Western allies and met with Brezhne\ in the
heat of the Afghanistan crisis.
Michel Poniatowski. Giscard d'Estaing's roving
ambassador, called the attacks on the president "ab
surd." " He said "nobody was shocked when Edmund
Muskie met (Soviet Foreign Minister) Andrei
Gromyko, so why is a Giscard-Brezhnev meeting
abnormal?"
Quebec to remain with Canada
MONTREAL — Ouebec's voters yesterday
soundly rejected their separatist government's ap
peal for a mandate to lead them out of the Canadian
confederation.
In a strong vote of confidence in a future in
Canada, the predominantly French-speaking pro
vince voted 58 percent to 42 percent against embark
ing on the road to secession.
With less than 2 percent of the total outstanding,
unofficial returns showed 2,258,002 voting no and
1,619,666 yes.
The "yes" vote won in only one of 11 regions in the
province — a heavily French rural area.
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau
issued a written statement sayine: "To mv fellow

Ouebecers who have been wounded by defeat, I wish
to say simply that we have all lost a little in this
referendum. If you take account of the broken friend
ships. the strained family relationships, the hurt
pride, there is no one among us who has not suffered
some wound which we must try to heal in the days and
weeks to come."
Quebec Premier Rene Levesque quieted a tearful
but tumultuous crowd of PQ supporters last night in a
Montreal sports arena and said, "If I've understood
you correctly, you are now say ing.' Until next time.' "
He said sovereignty would come to Quebec someday:
"I have confidence that one day we will have a re
ndezvous with history and Quebec will accept it."
Provincial Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan, who
led the "no" campaign, told his supporters in another
Montreal arena the result showed "we are proud to
be Ouebecers . . . and at the same time proud to be
Canadians."
Commerce reports look gloomy
WASHINGTON — The l .S. economy proved
even weaker during the first three months of 1980
than first estimated, as corporate profits grew far less
than they did a year earlier, the government said
yesterday.
Double-digit inflation took a heavy toll on corpo
rate profits during the first quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
The department's reports prov ide additional evi
dence of the nation's slide into a recession, and
economists predict worse performances during the
second three months of this year.
The government said the nation's economic
growth, as measured by the inflation-adjusted Gross
National Product, grew at an annual rate of only 0.6
percent from January through March.
Fhe GNP. the total output of all goods and ser
v ices, is the broadest measure of the economy's direc
tion.
Last month, the department reported preliminary
figures showing a somewhat healthier annual GNP
rise of 1.1 percent during the first quarter.
Even that higher figure, however, was far weaker
than the 3.1 percent and 2 percent annual rates regis
tered in the last two quarters of 1979.
173 elderly women die in blaze
KINGSTON, Jamaica — Quick-spreading flames
engulfed a century-old poorhouse for women vester
day and authorities feared 173 of the 203 residents —
many old. crippled or blind — perished. Five of the 30
known survivors were hospitalized for treatment of
burns and shock.
"First reports from the security forces indicate
strongly that this may have been the work of ar
sonists." said Prime Minister Michael Manley. He did
not explain why arson was suspected.
He said if arson is confirmed, "it will represent a
crime against humanity with no equal in our history."
Fire Chief Roy Ridgeway said the cause of the fire,
Jamaica's worst, was not determined.
Britain limits sanctions for Iran
LONDON — The European allies' commitment to
impose limited economic sanctions against Iran this
week has been thrown into confusion and doubt bv
the British government, which decided Monday night
to ban only future contracts for trade with Iran."
An angry rev olt by members of Parliament from all
parties forced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
break the agreement made Sunday by Britain and the
other eight European Economic Community coun
tries to cut off trade contracts with Iran dating back to
last November's seizure of hostages at the American
Embassy in Tehran.

Britain's sudden retreat, which means that sanc
tions will have virtually no immediate effect on its
rapidly growing trade with Iran, has surprised and
annoyed its European community partners, as well as
American diplomats in Europe.
Hie West German government said yesterday it
intends to honor its pledge to cut off all trade under
contracts dating back to last November. But govern
ment sources in other European countries questioned
how they could force their businessmen to stop trade
with Iran under existing contracts in the face of con
tinuing British competition.
Islamic heads ease Afghan policy
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Delegates to the Is
lamic foreign ministers' conference appeared ready
yesterday to soften their previous hardline positions
on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by calling for
a negotiated settlement to the crisis.
The full conference will most likely adopt at its
concluding session today a softly worded resolution
reaffirming its earlier call for a withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan. It appears unlikely that any
new measures against either the Soviets or their pup
pet regime in Kabul will come out of the conference.
Hie resolution calls for the formation of a special
committee to "seek ways and means including ap
propriate consultations" to solve the Afghan crisis.
The mild tone of the draft document, which uses
words like "deep concern" and "reaffirms its de
mand," is viewed as a major retrenchement from the
harsh language of the stand taken last January by an
extraordinary meeting of Islamic foreign ministers.
Court tells feds to pay $16 million
WASHINGTON — A U.S. District Court Judge
yesterday ordered the federal government to pay an
estimated $16 million to 324 women who successfully
charged the Government Printing Office with sex
discrimination — one ot the largest awards ever made
in a bias case brought against an employer, public or
private.
Judge Charles Richey, who set the amount yester
day, had ruled last October that the GPO paid men
higher wages than women for the same jobs in its
bindery and that the agency deliberately maintained
a job classification system that perpetuated sex dis
crimination.
Nuke waste may be sent to space
WASHING TON — The government is consider
ing packing nuclear wastes in rockets and launching
them to safe dumping grounds in galaxies far, far
away.
Fh«j National Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion awarded a $296,000 contract to the Boeing Co.
Monday to help learn whether potentially dangerous
wastes can be tired into eternal orbit about the sun,
into another solar system or elsewhere in the uni
verse.
Under the contract, Boeing is to study how best to
launch nuclear garbage — by an unmanned rocket or
by a manned vehicle whose crew would eject it into
space; where in space to put it; how to protect the
payload both during launch and in space, and how to
retrieve a payload from the ocean bottom or
elsewhere if there is an abort on liftoff.
Dow lones shows little change
NEW YORK — Stock prices were mixed in a
listless session yesterday as the market's spring rally
showed signs of fading.
rhe Dow Jones average of 30 industrials scored its
sixth consecutive gain with a 1.62 advance to 832.5 1.
But most other indicators finished on the minus side.

Quebec to remain with Canada
MONTREAL — Ouebec's voters yesterday
soundly rejected their separatist government's ap
peal for a mandate to lead them out of the Canadian
confederation.
In a strong vote of confidence in a future in
Canada, the predominantly French-speaking pro
vince voted 58 percent to 42 percent against embark
ing on the road to secession.
With less than 2 percent of the total outstanding,
unofficial returns showed 2,258,002 voting no and
1,619,666 yes.
The "yes" vote won in only one of 11 regions in the
province — a heavily French rural area.
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau
issued a written statement sayine: "To mv fellow

Ouebecers who have been wounded by defeat, I wish
to say simply that we have all lost a little in this
referendum. If you take account of the broken friend
ships. the strained family relationships, the hurt
pride, there is no one among us who has not suffered
some wound which we must try to heal in the days and
weeks to come."
Quebec Premier Rene Levesque quieted a tearful
but tumultuous crowd of PQ supporters last night in a
Montreal sports arena and said, "If I've understood
you correctly, you are now say ing.' Until next time.' "
He said sovereignty would come to Quebec someday:
"I have confidence that one day we will have a re
ndezvous with history and Quebec will accept it."
Provincial Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan, who
led the "no" campaign, told his supporters in another
Montreal arena the result showed "we are proud to
be Ouebecers . . . and at the same time proud to be
Canadians."
Commerce reports look gloomy
WASHINGTON — The l .S. economy proved
even weaker during the first three months of 1980
than first estimated, as corporate profits grew far less
than they did a year earlier, the government said
yesterday.
Double-digit inflation took a heavy toll on corpo
rate profits during the first quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
The department's reports prov ide additional evi
dence of the nation's slide into a recession, and
economists predict worse performances during the
second three months of this year.
The government said the nation's economic
growth, as measured by the inflation-adjusted Gross
National Product, grew at an annual rate of only 0.6
percent from January through March.
Fhe GNP. the total output of all goods and ser
v ices, is the broadest measure of the economy's direc
tion.
Last month, the department reported preliminary
figures showing a somewhat healthier annual GNP
rise of 1.1 percent during the first quarter.
Even that higher figure, however, was far weaker
than the 3.1 percent and 2 percent annual rates regis
tered in the last two quarters of 1979.
173 elderly women die in blaze
KINGSTON, Jamaica — Quick-spreading flames
engulfed a century-old poorhouse for women vester
day and authorities feared 173 of the 203 residents —
many old. crippled or blind — perished. Five of the 30
known survivors were hospitalized for treatment of
burns and shock.
"First reports from the security forces indicate
strongly that this may have been the work of ar
sonists." said Prime Minister Michael Manley. He did
not explain why arson was suspected.
He said if arson is confirmed, "it will represent a
crime against humanity with no equal in our history."
Fire Chief Roy Ridgeway said the cause of the fire,
Jamaica's worst, was not determined.
Britain limits sanctions for Iran
LONDON — The European allies' commitment to
impose limited economic sanctions against Iran this
week has been thrown into confusion and doubt bv
the British government, which decided Monday night
to ban only future contracts for trade with Iran."
An angry rev olt by members of Parliament from all
parties forced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
break the agreement made Sunday by Britain and the
other eight European Economic Community coun
tries to cut off trade contracts with Iran dating back to
last November's seizure of hostages at the American
Embassy in Tehran.

Britain's sudden retreat, which means that sanc
tions will have virtually no immediate effect on its
rapidly growing trade with Iran, has surprised and
annoyed its European community partners, as well as
American diplomats in Europe.
Hie West German government said yesterday it
intends to honor its pledge to cut off all trade under
contracts dating back to last November. But govern
ment sources in other European countries questioned
how they could force their businessmen to stop trade
with Iran under existing contracts in the face of con
tinuing British competition.
Islamic heads ease Afghan policy
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Delegates to the Is
lamic foreign ministers' conference appeared ready
yesterday to soften their previous hardline positions
on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by calling for
a negotiated settlement to the crisis.
The full conference will most likely adopt at its
concluding session today a softly worded resolution
reaffirming its earlier call for a withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan. It appears unlikely that any
new measures against either the Soviets or their pup
pet regime in Kabul will come out of the conference.
Hie resolution calls for the formation of a special
committee to "seek ways and means including ap
propriate consultations" to solve the Afghan crisis.
The mild tone of the draft document, which uses
words like "deep concern" and "reaffirms its de
mand," is viewed as a major retrenchement from the
harsh language of the stand taken last January by an
extraordinary meeting of Islamic foreign ministers.
Court tells feds to pay $16 million
WASHINGTON — A U.S. District Court Judge
yesterday ordered the federal government to pay an
estimated $16 million to 324 women who successfully
charged the Government Printing Office with sex
discrimination — one ot the largest awards ever made
in a bias case brought against an employer, public or
private.
Judge Charles Richey, who set the amount yester
day, had ruled last October that the GPO paid men
higher wages than women for the same jobs in its
bindery and that the agency deliberately maintained
a job classification system that perpetuated sex dis
crimination.
Nuke waste may be sent to space
WASHING TON — The government is consider

them to safe dumping grounds in galaxies far, far

Fh«j National Aeronautics and Space Administra

Monday to help learn whether potentially dangerous
wastes can be tired into eternal orbit about the sun,
into another solar system or elsewhere in the uni
verse.
Under the contract, Boeing is to study how best to
launch nuclear garbage — by an unmanned rocket or
by a manned vehicle whose crew would eject it into
space; where in space to put it; how to protect the
payload both during launch and in space, and how to
retrieve a payload from the ocean bottom or
elsewhere if there is an abort on liftoff.

Miami race riot 'under control 1
MIAMI — Miami's riot-scarred neighborhoods
were declared "under control" and downtown mer
chants reopened shuttered shops yesterday after
three-nights of racial violence that claimed 15 lives
and damaged $100 million in property.
But 250 miles away in Tampa, police said black
teenagers prowling city streets Monday night stoned
cars and looted stores. Angry slogans were spray
painted on university buildings.
Miami police, reinforced by 3600 National
Guardsmen and 200 highway patrolmen, arrested
200 more people during the night, mostly on minor
charges such as violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew.
That brought the total arrested since Saturday night
to 936.
"It's all quiet," said Miami Police spokeswoman
Cynthia Barry as the city's northwest skyline was free
of smoke plumes for the first time since the weekend.
"No major incidents occurred last night." she said.
"It'squiet. . .it's under control. Everything is back to
normal as of now."
The mob violence was triggered Saturday when an
all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four white former
Dade County policemen who had been accused in the
beating death of Arthur McDuffie. a 33-year-old
black Miami insurance man.
French summit rouses criticism
PARIS — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
briefed U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman on his
brief summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev,
which roused controversy in France and criticism in
Washington.
Hartman spent 45 minutes with Giscard d'Estaing
at his Elysses Palace headquarters yesterday and
made no statement to reporters upon leasing.
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet said he
would report to Parliament today on the meeting in
Warsaw, Poland. The Socialists. Giscard d'Estaing*s
main opposition, demanded a full debate but the
government said it would refuse.
In Washington, Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
criticized Giscard d'Estaing for failing to consult
NATO allies before the meeting on Monday.
"This is not conducive ... to the kind of mutual
confidence and consultation which we all seemed to
agree last week were essential to alliance solidarity
and unity," Muskie said.
There was no immediate reaction in Paris to Mus
kie's criticism, but a vigorous debate raged over

Department said.
The department's reports prov ide additional evi
dence of the nation's slide into a recession, and
economists predict worse performances during the
second three months of this year.
The government said the nation's economic
growth, as measured by the inflation-adjusted Gross
National Product, grew at an annual rate of only 0.6
percent from January through March.
Fhe GNP. the total output of all goods and ser
v ices, is the broadest measure of the economy's direc
tion.
Last month, the department reported preliminary
figures showing a somewhat healthier annual GNP
rise of 1.1 percent during the first quarter.
Even that higher figure, however, was far weaker
than the 3.1 percent and 2 percent annual rates regis
tered in the last two quarters of 1979.
173 elderly women die in blaze
KINGSTON, Jamaica — Quick-spreading flames
engulfed a century-old poorhouse for women vester
day and authorities feared 173 of the 203 residents —
many old. crippled or blind — perished. Five of the 30
known survivors were hospitalized for treatment of
burns and shock.
"First reports from the security forces indicate
strongly that this may have been the work of ar
sonists." said Prime Minister Michael Manley. He did
not explain why arson was suspected.
He said if arson is confirmed, "it will represent a
crime against humanity with no equal in our history."
Fire Chief Roy Ridgeway said the cause of the fire,
Jamaica's worst, was not determined.
Britain limits sanctions for Iran
LONDON — The European allies' commitment to
impose limited economic sanctions against Iran this
week has been thrown into confusion and doubt bv
the British government, which decided Monday night
to ban only future contracts for trade with Iran."
An angry rev olt by members of Parliament from all
parties forced Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to
break the agreement made Sunday by Britain and the
other eight European Economic Community coun
tries to cut off trade contracts with Iran dating back to
last November's seizure of hostages at the American
Embassy in Tehran.

Britain's sudden retreat, which means that sanc
tions will have virtually no immediate effect on its
rapidly growing trade with Iran, has surprised and
annoyed its European community partners, as well as
American diplomats in Europe.
Hie West German government said yesterday it
intends to honor its pledge to cut off all trade under
contracts dating back to last November. But govern
ment sources in other European countries questioned
how they could force their businessmen to stop trade
with Iran under existing contracts in the face of con
tinuing British competition.
Islamic heads ease Afghan policy
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Delegates to the Is
lamic foreign ministers' conference appeared ready
yesterday to soften their previous hardline positions
on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by calling for
a negotiated settlement to the crisis.
The full conference will most likely adopt at its
concluding session today a softly worded resolution
reaffirming its earlier call for a withdrawal of Soviet
troops from Afghanistan. It appears unlikely that any
new measures against either the Soviets or their pup
pet regime in Kabul will come out of the conference.
Hie resolution calls for the formation of a special
committee to "seek ways and means including ap
propriate consultations" to solve the Afghan crisis.
The mild tone of the draft document, which uses
words like "deep concern" and "reaffirms its de
mand," is viewed as a major retrenchement from the
harsh language of the stand taken last January by an
extraordinary meeting of Islamic foreign ministers.
Court tells feds to pay $16 million
WASHINGTON — A U.S. District Court Judge
yesterday ordered the federal government to pay an
estimated $16 million to 324 women who successfully
charged the Government Printing Office with sex
discrimination — one ot the largest awards ever made
in a bias case brought against an employer, public or
private.
Judge Charles Richey, who set the amount yester
day, had ruled last October that the GPO paid men
higher wages than women for the same jobs in its
bindery and that the agency deliberately maintained
a job classification system that perpetuated sex dis
crimination.
Nuke waste may be sent to space
WASHING TON — The government is consider
ing packing nuclear wastes in rockets and launching
them to safe dumping grounds in galaxies far, far
away.
Fh«j National Aeronautics and Space Administra
tion awarded a $296,000 contract to the Boeing Co.
Monday to help learn whether potentially dangerous
wastes can be tired into eternal orbit about the sun,
into another solar system or elsewhere in the uni
verse.
Under the contract, Boeing is to study how best to
launch nuclear garbage — by an unmanned rocket or
by a manned vehicle whose crew would eject it into
space; where in space to put it; how to protect the
payload both during launch and in space, and how to
retrieve a payload from the ocean bottom or
elsewhere if there is an abort on liftoff.

Miami race riot 'under control 1
MIAMI — Miami's riot-scarred neighborhoods
were declared "under control" and downtown mer
chants reopened shuttered shops yesterday after
three-nights of racial violence that claimed 15 lives
and damaged $100 million in property.
But 250 miles away in Tampa, police said black
teenagers prowling city streets Monday night stoned
cars and looted stores. Angry slogans were spray
painted on university buildings.
Miami police, reinforced by 3600 National
Guardsmen and 200 highway patrolmen, arrested
200 more people during the night, mostly on minor
charges such as violating the dusk-to-dawn curfew.
That brought the total arrested since Saturday night
to 936.
"It's all quiet," said Miami Police spokeswoman
Cynthia Barry as the city's northwest skyline was free
of smoke plumes for the first time since the weekend.
"No major incidents occurred last night." she said.
"It'squiet. . .it's under control. Everything is back to
normal as of now."
The mob violence was triggered Saturday when an
all-white jury in Tampa acquitted four white former
Dade County policemen who had been accused in the
beating death of Arthur McDuffie. a 33-year-old
black Miami insurance man.
French summit rouses criticism
PARIS — President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
briefed U.S. Ambassador Arthur Hartman on his
brief summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev,
which roused controversy in France and criticism in
Washington.
Hartman spent 45 minutes with Giscard d'Estaing
at his Elysses Palace headquarters yesterday and
made no statement to reporters upon leasing.
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet said he
would report to Parliament today on the meeting in
Warsaw, Poland. The Socialists. Giscard d'Estaing*s
main opposition, demanded a full debate but the
government said it would refuse.
In Washington, Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
criticized Giscard d'Estaing for failing to consult
NATO allies before the meeting on Monday.
"This is not conducive ... to the kind of mutual
confidence and consultation which we all seemed to
agree last week were essential to alliance solidarity
and unity," Muskie said.
There was no immediate reaction in Paris to Mus
kie's criticism, but a vigorous debate raged over
whether Giscard d'Estaing should have broken ranks
with his Western allies and met with Brezhne\ in the
heat of the Afghanistan crisis.
Michel Poniatowski. Giscard d'Estaing's roving
ambassador, called the attacks on the president "ab
surd." " He said "nobody was shocked when Edmund
Muskie met (Soviet Foreign Minister) Andrei
Gromyko, so why is a Giscard-Brezhnev meeting
abnormal?"
Quebec to remain with Canada
MONTREAL — Ouebec's voters yesterday
soundly rejected their separatist government's ap
peal for a mandate to lead them out of the Canadian
confederation.
In a strong vote of confidence in a future in
Canada, the predominantly French-speaking pro
vince voted 58 percent to 42 percent against embark
ing on the road to secession.
With less than 2 percent of the total outstanding,
unofficial returns showed 2,258,002 voting no and
1,619,666 yes.
The "yes" vote won in only one of 11 regions in the
province — a heavily French rural area.
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau
issued a written statement sayine: "To mv fellow

Ouebecers who have been wounded by defeat, I wish
to say simply that we have all lost a little in this
referendum. If you take account of the broken friend
ships. the strained family relationships, the hurt
pride, there is no one among us who has not suffered
some wound which we must try to heal in the days and
weeks to come."
Quebec Premier Rene Levesque quieted a tearful
but tumultuous crowd of PQ supporters last night in a
Montreal sports arena and said, "If I've understood
you correctly, you are now say ing.' Until next time.' "
He said sovereignty would come to Quebec someday:
"I have confidence that one day we will have a re
ndezvous with history and Quebec will accept it."
Provincial Liberal Party leader Claude Ryan, who
led the "no" campaign, told his supporters in another
Montreal arena the result showed "we are proud to
be Ouebecers . . . and at the same time proud to be
Canadians."
Commerce reports look gloomy
WASHINGTON — The l .S. economy proved
even weaker during the first three months of 1980
