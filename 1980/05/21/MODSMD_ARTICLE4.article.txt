# Volcano's death toll climbs
## Wall of mud threatens thousands

From the Daily wire services
VANCOUVER, Wash. —
Geologists warned 50,000 residents of
two small cities yesterday that a lake of
water trapped by mud and debris from
erupting Mount St. Helens could come
cascading down the mountain at any
time.
"It's going to happen," said Dwight
Crandell, a geologist for the U.S.
Geological Survey.
Seven people were known dead and
officials increased estimates of the
number of people missing to 98. Forest
fires that have consumed 50,000 acres
burned unchecked through the wilder
ness around the volcano.
An awesome cloud of powdery ash
released by Sunday's explosive erup
tion had drifted across the Mississippi
River into the eastern United States by
yesterday, disrupting travel in several
states along the way.
Mud and debris from the convulsion
that blew 1300 feet off the top of
Mount St. Helens formed a dam at the
outlet of Spirit Lake, trapping two
square miles of water 200 feet deep.
Crandell said a spill over the fragile
pumice-and-roek dam on the volcano's

north side was "imminent" and a wall
of water could be released down the
Toutle River, threatening Interstate 5
and Kelso and Longview, 40 miles
away.
The water will move at 30 mph, giv
ing people time to flee, he said.
No evacuations of the two cities were
ordered and a spokeswoman for the
Cowlitz County Emergency Services
said,"There's maybe some leaving, but
no big movement of people."
As for more eruptions from the vol
cano, Crandell said. "There is no indi
cation that another eruption is immi
nent."
Crandell said the volcano vented
more steam and ash yesterday, but in

much smaller volumes than the two
days before.
Hospitals reported numerous com
plaints from people with respiratory
problems.
Constant inhalation of the silicates in
the volcanic ash poses the danger of
silicosis, an asthma-like disease.
The danger, if any, would be from
particles in the "respirable" size range
— meaning from five to 10 microns in
diameter — which get through the de
fenses of the nose and throat and reach
the lung. A micron is about four one
hundred thousandths of an inch.
Officials throughout the Northwest
and upper Great Plains closed schools
and highways as they puzzled over how
to shift or shovel away up to 7 inches of
the fine, thick fallout.
Thousands of travelers were
stranded because of poor visibility and
hazardous driving conditions.
Dozens of commericial flights were
cancelled as the Federal Aviation Ad
ministration warned the ash could pock
airplane windows, clog carburetors and
strip paint.
The ash, which is expected to reach
New England by sunrise Wednesday, is
expected to touch every state east of
the Rockies except Texas, Louisiana
and Florida.
At Toutle River, north of the vol
cano, game officials report that the
eruption turned it into a raging hot tor
rent and wiped out its spring salmon
run.
