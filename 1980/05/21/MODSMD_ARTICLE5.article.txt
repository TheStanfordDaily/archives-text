# U.S. tells Iranians here to leave in two weeks
## 
### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
At least three Iranian students at
the University have been told to
leave the United States within the
next two weeks by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS). If
the students do not leave voluntarily
or appeal their case within the time
specified by the INS, they will be
deported involuntarily.
Seven Iranian students have re
ported to the Bechtel International
Center here that they have been cal
led to hearings by immigration
judges at the INS for investigation
of their visa status, according to
Mitchell Hall, the foreign student
adviser on campus. Additional stu
dents may have been called to hear
ings without reporting to Bechtel.
The investigation and deporta
tion proceedings are a result of Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's cutoff of dip
lomatic relations with Iran on April
7. At the president's request, the
INS advised regional offices on
April 14 that extensions of stay and
permanent resident status for Ira
nians will not be granted.
The new regulations will affect X6
of the 93 Iranian students currently
enrolled at the University. The
Bechtel center estimates that within
six months almost all Iranian stu
dents at the University will be re
quired to leave the U.S. Each stu
dent will be asked to leave within 15

days of the date of expiration of his
1-94 form, the official document on
which the INS registers the term of
each student's stay.
The new INS deadlines for depar
ture will interrupt most of the Ira
nian students' programs of study.
While some students are hurrying to
finish their programs early, others
are trying to arrange to work/« ab
sentia.
Most of the students do not yet
wish to leave. One student, who
asked not to be identified, will not
finish his studies until next year, but
he does not want to continue his
work elsewhere, because he consid
ers Stanford a superior university.
Another Iranian, who also withheld
his name, a graduate student in elec
trical engineering, plans to try to ob
tain his university degree in Europe.
The refusal to issue or reissue
visas to Iranians is one of the four
sanctions against Iran announced by
President Carter in April. The pres
ident called on "the secretary of the
treasury and the secretary gener
al .. . to invalidate all visas issued to
Iranian citizens for future entry into
the U.S. (effective April 7, 3 p.m.).
"We will not reissue visas, nor
will we issue new visas, except for
compelling and proven humanita
rian reasons, or where the national
interest of our country requires,"
the president said.
