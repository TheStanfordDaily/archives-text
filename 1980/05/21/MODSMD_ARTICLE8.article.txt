# Finance manager's appointment not official
## 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
A four-member committee, comprised of current
ASSU Student Financial Manager Bruce Bendix,
Council of Presidents member Marc Ventresca and
ASSU Senators Chris Greene and Yvonne Hiltz, is
currently reviewing Assoc. Financial Manager Steve
Davis to determine whether to appoint him financial
manager for the ensuing year.
The committee, which has been meeting both for
mally and informally since the spring ASSU election
two weeks ago, will probably come to a decision
today, according to Greene and Ventresca.
Davis said he and Bendix both view the ongoing
review process as the formal touch to a foregone
conclusion. However, Greene asserted that "this year
the process of evaluating the associate financial man
ager has been a rigorous one." In fact, "we view this
as the first of our attempts to do something that
maybe hasn't been done as it should have been in the
past," Ventresca said.
"This year has been a year when the senate and the
new COP have been especially concerned about fol
lowing through on the processes mandated by the
constitution and the by-laws," Greene explained.
When the present ASSU Constitution was being
officially drafted in 1969, the original format
specified that the following year's student financial
manager be selected by a four-person committee
after the spring COP election.
In a March 3, 1970 letter accepting the constitu

tion, then-University President Kenneth Pitzer
suggested that the constitution be modified, accord
ing to the findings of an ad-hoc committee on ASSU
finances, to provide adequate training time for the
new financial manager.
The letter recommended that an associate financial
manager be carefully chosen from an applicant pool
by the committee of four in February. Then, in spring,
the associate manager would be regarded as the
"prime candidate" to succeed the financial manager
in mid-June.
Thus, for the past 10 years, the process of choosing
an associate financial manager has been extensive,
according to Bendix. But the formal spring approval
has been almost automatic.
"The way I interpreted the constitution and the
way it's been interpreted the last 10 years, is that if
the associate financial manager is not acceptable, (the
spring review) is a provision to get rid of him," Ben
dix said. "My understanding was that there was no
problem this year. Everyone agrees that Steve is an
excellent candidate for financial manager," he said.
When the first committee of Bendix, Hiltz, then-
ASSU Sen. Dick Butterfield and then-COP member
Tom Gart named Davis associate financial manager
in February, Davis began training for the financial
manager job.
With the election of the new COP, Greene re
placed Butterfield, who resigned from the senate to
join the COP, and Ventresca replaced Gart.
At that time, Bendix circulated a memorandum

through University channels announcing Davis' ap
pointment and indicating that Davis would assume
the full role June 15.
"That was inaccurate," Ventresca said, "but we
decided to let it go." An article in Monday's Daily
implying that Davis had already been invested as the
next financial manager however, raised senate and
COP eyebrows.
According to Ventresca, one of the COP's goals
this year "is to restore some of the clarity of the
ASSU. We're trying to regularize the ASSU process
and to create a strong sense of community within the
office. When something's supposed to be done, we
want it done," he said.
Greene, senate finance committee chair, pointed
out that the senate has been "reasserting" itself in
ASSU financial affairs. For example, a recent by-laws
change allows the senate input in the selection of
ASSU project managers.
"It's important to recognize that the committee of
four, reviewing the associate financial manager as the
prime candidate, is not a rubber stamp," Greene
c'aimed. "Obviously the associate financial manager
has an advantage, but the constitution delineated that
he's supposed to have that advantage."
Bendix said he feels such insistence on enacting the
constitutional process is pointless. "They're imposing
a new interpretation on the constitution . . . and they
have no right to do it," Bendix said of the other
committee members.
