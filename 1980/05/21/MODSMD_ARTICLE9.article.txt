## South Korean cabinet resigns 
### William Chapman The Washington Post 
SEOUL, South Korea â€” The South Ko
rean Cabinet resigned yesterday, stripping
away most of the remnants of civilian gov
ernment and clearing the way for a new gov
ernment chosen by military leaders.
A government spokesman said the
Cabinet members handed in their resigna
tions yesterday afternoon as a gesture to take
responsibility for the troubles that led to the
military takeover last weekend.
President Choi Kyu Hah is expected to
announce some form of new government
Thursday. a spokesman said. There was no
indication what it would be, but there was
speculation it would be a military council
dominated by army leaders and others ac
ceptable to the group of generals running the
country under martial law.
Likely candidate
The name of a retired general. Choi
Kvung-nok. emerged as a likely candidate to
be placed in nominal charge of whatever
gov ernment is imposed. He is a former army
chiet of staff and served as ambassador to
Mexico and the United Kingdom.
The news of the Cabinet's resignation was
announced over radio stations at 4 p.m. by
the government's information minister, and
there were indications its departure was not
voluntary. At the same time, it was an
nounced that Education Minister Kim Ok
gill was giving an interv iew in which she said
she had not made up her mind whether to
resign.
It hardly mattered, because the Cabinet
had been powerless since Saturday night,
when, in a building jammed with troops, it
had signed an order granting extensiv e mar
tial law powers to the military . Since then,
there have been many arrests of opposition
politicians and dissidents, and hundreds have
fled their homes to avoid arrest.
Defiance still flickered yesterdav in the

southwestern city of Kwangju, where an es
timated 2000 demonstrators clashed again
with police and troops. Two prior demonst
rations there had been violently suppressed,
and new agencies reported at least two
deaths had been verified.
In yesterday's protest, students and citi
zens commandeered taxicabs and buses to
crash through one police blockade but were
subsequently dispersed by tear gas.
The rest of the country has been calm ex
cept for scattered hit-and-run demonstra
tions as large numbers of troops were
mobilized and raids on private homes con
tinued.
Under the new martial-law edicts issued
early Sunday, all gatherings are banned, in
cluding sessions of the National Assembly.
Two major political leaders are under arrest,
along with more than a hundred students and
dissidents.
Violation
The only major politician now out of jail.
New Democratic Party president Kim Young
Sam, was under house arrest after having
tried to hold a news conference at his home in
Seoul.
Kim had been warned thwt has news con
ference would be a violation of martial law.
Troops arriv ed and pushed foreign reporters
away from his front gate and later ordered a
number of Kim's political supporters to leave
his home.
Later in the day. 49 of his party 's 66 mem
bers of the National Assembly submitted
their resignations in protest of the closing of
the legislative body, which was scheduled to
convene a special session called to consider
lifting martial law.
At least two party members are known to
have been arrested, and several others are in
hiding, fearing arrest.
Kim smuggled out a statement calling the
new martial law edicts a "betrayal to the
restoration of democracy."

There were other signs of protest. Repor
ters for a major Seoul newspaper, the Joong
A'rtg I J bo, refused to work as a protest against
the strict censorship imposed last Sunday
after several weeks of relative press freedom.
Editors put out the paper last night. Al
though rumors spread through Seoul
last night about a new government, there was
no solid indication what shape it would take.
It appeared that some totally new form
would be imposed, because a reshaping of
the current parliamentary form would re
quire approval of the National Assembly,
which is forbidden to hold meetings.
Sources who had been given some inkling
of what is in store said it appeared that Presi
dent Choi would promulgate a new council
that would be substituted tor the assembly.
Whereabouts a mystery
Even Choi's whereabouts are a mystery.
The Blue House, the presidential mansion, is
cordoned off by troops and Korean reporters
are not allowed inside. Rumors persist that
he is under a form of house arrest. But a
government source denied that yesterday.
His last public message, issued Sunday, was
read on television by a spokesman.
Whatever form the new government takes,
it will be packed with leaders loyal to the
half-dozen generals who pulled off a coup in
the military last December and who steadily
increased their power until taking total con
trol last Saturday night.
Several names of potential figurehead
leaders have surfaced, but those claiming to
have some knowledge of the generals' think
ing believe that Choi Kyung-nok is the cur
rent front-runner.
A veteran army officer, he resigned the
military in 1967 to become ambassador to
Mexico and from 1971 to 1974 he was am
bassador to the Court of St. James' in Lon
don. Last year he had been appointed to the
National Assembly by the late president
Park Chung Hee.
