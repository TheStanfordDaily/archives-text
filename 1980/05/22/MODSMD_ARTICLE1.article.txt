ATHENS. Gu. — After four months,
thousands of miles, hours of practice and dozens
ol matches, it comes down to two teams — and it
could have stayed in the Bay area.
It is the NCAA tennis championships. 1980-
style, with top-seeded Stanford meeting third
seeded UC-Berkeley for the title, a matchup
which has all the flavor ol the Dodger-Yankee
World Series of yesteryear. II those were known
as the Subway Series, let this be known as the
BART championships.
Stanford advanced with a determined 6-3 win
over fifth-seeded Pepperdine. while Cal whipped
second-seeded USC 5-2. Today's match will he
the fourth battle between the two Pacific-10 con
ference teams, with Cal holding a 2-1 edge.
However, no one would dare draw any conclu
sions from past results. As it should be, the match
is rated a tossup. Many agree that these two
linalists are the teams with the most depth, the
last determination of strength.
Depth
Stanford showed this strength from top to bot
tom in its lineup yesterday. No. 1 singles player
Peter Rennert dispatched Pepperdine's Rocky

Vasque/ 6-1.6-2 in 45 minutes. There was barely
enough time for the ice to melt in the drinks ot
some 1800 spectators who sat in the swelter of a
spring Georgia afternoon.
Rennert is pleased and confident in his play, a
remarkable turnaround from the Rennert who
lost four matches here a year ago. "I'm getting
better every day. a little crisper." the senior said.
"I'm working into my serve-and-volley game, but
the courts here are slow."
The world's top-ranked amateur still had no
trouble, drawing Vasque/ into the net and then
lobbing consistently over Ins head.
Tough mentally
Other bright spots for the Cards were No. 3
Lloyd Bourne's 3-6. 6-2. 6-3 win over Garth
Maynes — "that was the mentally toughest I've
ever been." Bourne said — and the play ot
freshmen David Siegler and Jim Gurfein, each of
whom won in three sets.
" I'm especially proud of the young kids." said a
beaming Stanford coach Dick Gould. " 'Gurf'
was struggling and came through with a big win
and Siegler played exceptionally well in dou
bles."
USCs strength is in its doubles lineup, which
had won 16 of IS matches during the season

against the other three scmifinalists. The Golden
Bears, however, made sure it never came down to
that, taking four of si\ singles matches.
Fighting off the momentary setback tit No. I
Scott McCain losing two team match points in a
6-3. 2-6, 7-6 (5-4) U*<s to Robert Van't Hot. the
Bears' No. 3 double 1 team of Mike Bauer and
Yair Wertheimer clinched the finals berth with
6-4.6-2 win over Sean Brawley and Jack kruger.
End t'f the road
And so now there "are but nine matches bet
ween the finalists and the championship. The
coaches of the losing scmifinalists. USC's Dick
Leach and Pepperdinc's Allen Fox. could only
agree on one thing: they wouldn't put their
money where their iwuiths were.
Leach went over the lineups man-for-man and
gave Cal a 5-2 (2 tossups) decision, giving Stan
lord the nod only to Rennert and No. 3 doubles
team of Tim Mayotte and Jeff Arons. "It could
still go either way." headded.' I wouldn't want to
bet on it."
"I'd hate to make a pick." Fox said. "Stanford
might have a slight edge in past record, but I
wouldn't want to bet a lot on anybody."
The added pressure of wagering isn't needed.

The finals themselves define pressure. And in
playing in their third linal in four years at Stan
ford. seniors Rennert and Bourne are responding
well to it.
"I feel more experienced. I'm not as nervous.
I'm enjoying this," Rennert said. "I'm much
more confident. I go out and play my match and
then 1 go root for the others. When we lost four
first sets today, 1 could have lost concentration."
Bourne agreed. "1 played exceptionally good.
I've never concentrated this hard for an entire
match."
It was the pressure. The pressure of winning it
all orcoming up short. And it could he seen on the
face of e\ery player, in every missed volley, in
every ace. in every sip of Gatorade and in every
gritting of the teeth.
"It happens when you get to Athens," Rennert
said. "Every team is more determined. The only
thing that counts is what happens here."
