# Soviet press ignores Afghanistan
## 
### Thomas Kent The Associated Press 
MOSCOW — It exists in occa
sional. muted references in the
official Soviet press. It exists in
Western radio broadcasts, which
beam some details to Soviet lis
teners.
But to ordinary Soviet citi
zens. Afghanistan is the unseen
war, a small war and very. \ery
far away.
Western analysts say it is a
measure of how tightly the
Soviet press is controlled and
how easily So\ ief citizens submit
that the Soviet Union can throw
N5.000 soldiers plus aircraft and
tanks into another country with

scarcely a detail revealed in pub
lic.
Soviet citizens have not been
told how many Red Army troops
are in Afghanistan, where they
are or anything about casualties.
According to the U.S. State
Department, the Soviets have
suffered more than 8000 casual
ties since its troops began pour
ing over the border into Af
ghanistan last December.
Walking wounded
Concrete signs of the Afghan
conflict are difficult to find, but
Western travelers have spotted
walking wounded, presumably
from Afghanistan, outside milit
ary hospitals in the central Asian
city of Tashkent. Tourists have
also seen wearv soldiers in com
bat dress in the municipal rail
way station, presumably tin their
way home from Afghanistan.
But while Soviet authorities
continue handing out hundreds
ot medals for everything from
child-raising to fire-fighting, not
a single medal has been publicly
awarded for valor in Afghanis
tan.
The soldiers' exploits go un
catalogued and unappreciated in
the official news media. News
papers are filled with reams of
old World War 11 memoirs mark
ing the 35th anniversary of Hi
tler's defeat.
Political situation
While the actual activities of
Soviet troops are given scant at
tention. long newspaper articles
purport to explain the political

situation in Afghanistan. They
insist that Moscow's forces — of
ficially called "limited military
contingents" — were invited in
by Afghan authorities.
Articles occasionally tell of
Soviet soldiers sprucing up Af
ghan villages, helicoptering
schoolbooks to remote villages,
treating ill Afghan children and
giving amateur concert perfor
mances. Almost nothing is said
about Soviet troops in military
action.
When curious Muscovites ask
about troop activities at public
political lectures, they are told
the Red Army is "helping" Af
ghan troops while the Afghans
do the jobs of fighting Moslem
rebels — usually referred to as
"bandits."
Lecturers offer no more de
tails; audiences do not press
them.
Protection
According to Soviet versions,
the Red Army is helping protect
the country from "gross interfer
ence by external forces" from
the West.
Many citizens, buffeted by
strident Soviet accusations of
American interference in Af
ghanistan and Western claims of
a Soviet invasion, seem to be re
serving judgment.
"It's so far away, no one
knows what's happening," a stu
dent told a Western reporter.
Diplomats vague
Soviet diplomats, who know
something more about what is
going on. also are non-committal
in private conversations about
Afghanistan.

Said one: "Some of the reports
would indicate that things are
difficult (for the Soviets) there.
But let's just wait a while and
see. We'll see in the end which
side comes out the better."
Moscow dissidents have de
scribed protests by the parents of
soldiers killed in battle in Af
ghanistan. but such reports have
not been confirmed.
Boycott
While ignoring many aspects
of the Afghan conflict, the Soviet
news media dwell heavily on al
leged efforts by the United
States to torpedo detente — in
cluding President Carter's
boycott of the 19N0 Moscow
Olympics.
Soviet commentators make
only the slightest connection be
tween the boycott and Afghanis
tan — Afghanistan, they say, is
just the latest "pretext" for a
premeditated U.S. campaign
against Moscow planned long
ago.
Possibly as a result of down
played Soviet coverage of Af
ghanistan. many ordinary
Soviets seem to accept the ver
sion that such a distant, unseen
war is no justification for anti
detente moves by the United
States. And viewed through the
prism of Moscow newspapers,
the Afghan conflict is very small
indeed.
"Afghanistan just can't be that
important." said a young Mos
cow hotel worker. "It's just a
small matter. The U.S. and the
Soviet Union must have more
important "things to worry ab
out."
