# Chinese advertising booms

### Elisabeth Chang Agence France-Presse 
PEKING — After a somewhat hesitant first ap
pearance in the streets of Peking at the end of last
year, advertising is booming in China — on the
television, the radio, in newspapers and in an in
creasing number of public places.
Posters advertising a range of wares are devoted
as much to items practically unobtainable in China
as to everyday consumer goods.
The advertising has proved a boon to those who
run China's three main advertising companies
which compete for the market, according to Cheng
Chung, deputy director of the Peking advertising
agency.
The agency, set up in August last year, handles
the advertising of both Chinese and foreign com
panies. Its X 0 employees personally see to the de
sign and production of advertisements and act as
intermediaries with the "relevant bodies."
Such bodies include the Peking Fine Arts Com
pany. which has been responsible for the large

billboards lining Changan Avenue in the eity
center. Advertising anything from Japanese cal
culators. Coca Cola. Sanyo and Toshiba products,
to Chinese cashmere jerseys, cleaning agents and
grand pianos.
The Peking Fine Arts Company also has put up
such billboards in other busy parts of the city, near
the airport and on the famous "Democracy Wall"
where big-character political posters have been
outlawed since December last year.
The advertising has resulted in lucrative profits.
Each billboard, about 30 square meters in size, is
produced in a matter of days by three or four
skilled artists. A six-month exposure, it has been
calculated, brings in some 13,000 yuan ($8600).
That is the figure usually billed to a foreign com
pany. It is cut by half for Chinese concerns.
Whether the advertising is graphic or broadcast
by radio or television, it usually backs items unob
tainable in China. When they are to be found here,
the goods advertised are usually reserved exclu
sively for foreigners or senior Chinese cadres.
