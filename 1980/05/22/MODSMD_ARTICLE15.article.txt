William I Buckley \v;is stung
to learn Vassar College
seniors weren't eager for his
company, so lie flung a few
choleric darts and proclaimed
that he would do without
theirs.
Vassar College said "l ues
day that the seniors will hear
no main speaker during
commencement Sunday its
the scheduled speaker —
Buckley — had withdrawn
after learning of student pro
tests.
"Everyone's really sur
prised. They're amazed." said
Alan Phillips, senior class
president. "Nobody thought
the protests would make any
difference. This took
everyone completely by sur
prise."
Buckley, editor ol the con
servative National Review.
withdrew Monday in a letter
to Vassar President Virginia
Smith. In the letter, he dub
bed Vassar students "a fear
fully ill-instructed body" and
commented that "nowhere
have I encountered that blend
of ferocious illiteracy
achieved by the young men
and women of Vassar."
Buckley announced: "The
majority of the senior class of
Vassar does not desire my
company, and, I must confess,
having read specimens of
their thought and sentiments,
that I do not desire the com
pany of the majority ol the
senior class of Vassar."

lie referred to a petition
protesting his selection as
speaker which was signed by
301 ot 555 seniors.
But Phillips thinks most
who signed were not opposed
to Buckley. I le said: "1 think
a lot ot them thought there
would he a demonstration or
protest at commencement,
and they signed the petition
because they didn't want their
graduation ruined."
In March. Miss Smith
asked Buckley to speak. His
name was among 32
suggested by seniors. He was
chosen, according to Dixie
Sheridan, an aide to Miss

Smith, after consultation with
a student committee.
However, the news that
Buckley would speak sparked
protest meetings and a vigor
ous debate in the student
newspaper, The Miscellunv
News. Student editors pub
lished an editorial in which
they opposed Buckley as
speaker, writing:
"His beliefs are offensive
to women, to minorities, to
pacifists and, in short, to a
presumable majority of \ as
sar students who are rep
resentative ol \ ;issar's long
liberal tradition."
