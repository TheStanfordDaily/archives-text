# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS

JeffHcyman (Daily, May 16) tails to understand
the difference between morality and moralism
when he states. "The morality of an act . . . de
pends on the agent's rational decision to commit
that act." It is interesting that the letter from Stan
ford faculty members "disturbed by the recent ar
rests." places greatest emphasis on the "arbitrary"
(irrational) way in which the law was enforced.
The political context may explain why they
have no problem with the law or its enforcement
as such. . I think they probably do ha\ e a prob
lem with both, and should.
Heyman should consider why anyone would be
so irrational that he would risk public humiliation,
family scandal, damage to career and personal
trauma for relatively anonymous sex in a public
toilet. I wouldn't want to have sex with anyone in
any public restroom I have ever been in.
1 suspect that, since it is one of the few places
where I can have my pants un/ipped, it I were
interested in and desperate enough to be looking
r a place to have illicit sex. this fact would offer
S' me camouflage against being discovered. But
even the relatively rational decision about where to
commit an irrational act partakes more of despera
tion than of reason. And while taste is relative and
there may be some who find sex in the toilet truly
exquisite, the risks run by those who were arrested
cannot be explained by reason.
Nor can the law which prohibits sex in public
restrooms. be understood rationally. More than
deter these acts, this law seeks to judge and stig
matize homosexuality, and conversely to praise
heterosexuality. I suppose it we had bigender
toilets it might apply to all. but the disgust which
motivates this law is not just about decorum in
public johns. It is about homosexual acts, particu
larly male, but wherever they might occur.
What is the meaning of one's sexuality to one's
personality and being? Can it be kept a secret,
indulged on the sly or repressed successfully? Is
personal happiness a matter of long-range or im
mediate gratification, or a matter of mixing and
blending? How do we understand heterosexual af
fairs which endanger home and reputation? How
do we understand what it means to have one's
sexuality condemned in the special way known by
homosexual people and still know that you are a
homosexual human being?

Of people involved in homosexual activity in
public rest rooms, v cry few if any have ev en opened
the door to the closet â€” except to the anonymous
co-offenders who help them know that they are not
isolated "freaks."
The obvious way to end indecorous activities in
inappropriate places is to allow these activities
where it would be appropriate. When you declare
that the activity per se is inappropriate, to the ex
tent that you tail to recognize the human issues
which produce the behavior, you will simply pro
duce counter-authoritarian forms of behavior.
Moralism does not increase public morality; it in
creases the perversity with which authority sup
ports prejudice and community is shattered.
I contend that neither the men who committed
these acts nor we are "aware of the nature ol their
acts." Even had the enforcement been constant
and had there been no political overtones, the law
would have missed the moral question entirely. As
the capstone to the systematic harrassment of
homosexual people, it is a law which is incapable of
morality.
Like Heyman's argument, it ignores the people
and contributes to the problem it seeks to solve.
The rational gloss under which the human mean
ings of sexuality and the emotional and psychic
depths at which we encounter our sexuality are
subsumed, operates as a screen tit keep us from
becoming aware of the nature of these acts.
It can be argued that the law can only provide
rules for conduct and cannot address the systematic
harrassment by society and culture other than to
provide objective rather than selective enforce
ment. I believe that this concept of the law itself
demonstrates why this law is bad since the law
attempts to do what is beyond its power in its
condemnation of homosexuality.
It creates a Catch-22 situation in which those
whose conflict between their sexuality and their
socially-approved selves makes sex in public re
strooms worth having are punished for being hu
man. And. as with all moralism. it draws attention
away from the real issues of morality and immoral
ity. I value the lives of these ten people far more
than the "right" to decorous bathrooms.
