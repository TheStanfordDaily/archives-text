# The 						Great God Time doesn't exist
## 
### 
Think hack to the first grade.
Your memories are colored with
hopscotch and baseball and
peanut butter sandwiches and
that feeling of always being the
youngest. I doubt your memory
includes that it was then that you
learned to tell time — you
grasped the difference between
the big hand and the little hand
and how many minutes past the
hour. How accomplished you
felt!
But the little hand has just
kept mov ing around the big hand
and now that Timex on your
wrist rules your life. It tells you
when you are late, when you are
hungry. when class is almost over
and when you can stop out for ;i
Michelob. Time has become
your ringmaster, with bull whip
in hand behind you. making you
squirm.
Somewhere in between six and
20 you lost perspective on what
is time, actually. It is not a ruler
that runs your life, nor is it a pre
cious commodity that you will
someday earn more of. You will
not magically have more time
when you celebrate your 60th
birthday. You will only have less
things you think you must do.
For time is only a means of
organizing — a container used to
package things, like paper clips
or filing cabinets or refrigerators.

lime holds minutes or experi
ences together. Webster's defini
tion boils down to this, "the
period when something occurs or
continues."
We complain, at least I do. "1
don't have enough time!" But
for what? We seem to have
"do-as-many-things-at-once"
on our list of things to do. It is
ludicrous that we take pride in
doing seven million things at
once, simultaneously doing all
seven million better than
everyone else.
In fact, you do have time if you
don't try to commit yourself to
being dorm president, captain of
the varsity volleyball team.
ASSU senator, and take fifteen
units atul have a heavy-duty
honey. It doesn't work. Take my
word for it.
There will always be more
things we want to do. but I think
it is better to do a lew things well
than do lots of half-baked things
and get mononucleosis before
graduation. Choices must be
made and stuck with. It is not a
sign of weakness or inefficiency
to have some free time.
As for ridding yourself of the
ringmaster, start with remember
ing what is time, really. You
aren't dependent on it. Go
backpacking and leave your
watch at home to discover that

you eat and sleep normally. You
may meet another backpacker
who has a watch and you'll see
that you've been getting up at
7. eating at X. noon and 6,
and putting your head to your
pillow at 10. You only need a
watch in order to coordinate with
other people.
But we all do a lot of coor
dinating, don't we? It is easy to
think that there can he more or
less time than we want or need
and that time can go fast and
slow. It can't. Only we can over
schedule ourselves and allow too
little time.
Your ringmaster only needs
one more good kick. That will
come from finding a worthwhile
balance between living for the
future and living tor the present.

Most of us seem to live for the
former.
We study hard in high school
instead of writing on the school
paper and playing after-school
sports. We get into that good col
lege but there we work even har
der to get into medical school in
stead of getting to know our
favorite professors or rocking
out to LSJUMB playing "All
Right Now." And then we work
harder than ever in medical
school so our starting salaries
will be over $25,000.
Why? The Great God Time
does not exist. Enjoy the rest of
spring.

Think hack to the first grade.
Your memories are colored with
hopscotch and baseball and
peanut butter sandwiches and
that feeling of always being the
youngest. I doubt your memory
includes that it was then that you
learned to tell time — you
grasped the difference between
the big hand and the little hand
and how many minutes past the
hour. How accomplished you
felt!
But the little hand has just
kept mov ing around the big hand
and now that Timex on your
wrist rules your life. It tells you
when you are late, when you are
hungry. when class is almost over
and when you can stop out for ;i
Michelob. Time has become
your ringmaster, with bull whip
in hand behind you. making you
squirm.
Somewhere in between six and
20 you lost perspective on what
is time, actually. It is not a ruler
that runs your life, nor is it a pre
cious commodity that you will
someday earn more of. You will
not magically have more time
when you celebrate your 60th
birthday. You will only have less
things you think you must do.
For time is only a means of
organizing — a container used to
package things, like paper clips
or filing cabinets or refrigerators.

lime holds minutes or experi
ences together. Webster's defini
tion boils down to this, "the
period when something occurs or
continues."
We complain, at least I do. "1
don't have enough time!" But
for what? We seem to have
"do-as-many-things-at-once"
on our list of things to do. It is
ludicrous that we take pride in
doing seven million things at
once, simultaneously doing all
seven million better than
everyone else.
In fact, you do have time if you
don't try to commit yourself to
being dorm president, captain of
the varsity volleyball team.
ASSU senator, and take fifteen
units atul have a heavy-duty
honey. It doesn't work. Take my
word for it.
There will always be more
things we want to do. but I think
it is better to do a lew things well
than do lots of half-baked things
and get mononucleosis before
graduation. Choices must be
made and stuck with. It is not a
sign of weakness or inefficiency
to have some free time.
As for ridding yourself of the
ringmaster, start with remember
ing what is time, really. You
aren't dependent on it. Go
backpacking and leave your
watch at home to discover that

you eat and sleep normally. You
may meet another backpacker
who has a watch and you'll see
that you've been getting up at
7. eating at X. noon and 6,
and putting your head to your
pillow at 10. You only need a
watch in order to coordinate with
other people.
But we all do a lot of coor
dinating, don't we? It is easy to
think that there can he more or
less time than we want or need
and that time can go fast and
slow. It can't. Only we can over
schedule ourselves and allow too
little time.
Your ringmaster only needs
one more good kick. That will
come from finding a worthwhile
balance between living for the
future and living tor the present.

Most of us seem to live for the
former.
We study hard in high school
instead of writing on the school
paper and playing after-school
sports. We get into that good col
lege but there we work even har
der to get into medical school in
stead of getting to know our
favorite professors or rocking
out to LSJUMB playing "All
Right Now." And then we work
harder than ever in medical
school so our starting salaries
will be over $25,000.
Why? The Great God Time
does not exist. Enjoy the rest of
spring.
