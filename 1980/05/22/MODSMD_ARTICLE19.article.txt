not reduce government waste

don't need more cuts made in

We cannot cut an average of
$140 from state income tax

User fees hit hardest those

The wealthiest three percent

Rosenzweig right
As a member of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
and the Association of American
University Professors (AAUP) I
wish to publicly disassociate my
self from recent statements is
sued by the Executive Director
of ACLU of Northern California
and by the Executive Committee
of the Stanford Chapter of
AAUP in connection with the
ongoing review by the Advisory
Board in the matter of former
Stanford Prof. Bruce Franklin.
I find the ACLU statement
shockingly lacking in fact, em
phasis and interpretation and I
agree with the analysis of this
statement made by Robert
Rosenzweig in the May 14. 1980
issue of the Campus Report. I
find the endorsement of the
ACLU statement by the AAUP
Executive Committee unwar
ranted.
Neither the ACLU nor the
AAUP polled their member
ships in connection with the
statements issued. Therefore, at
present these statements cannot
be interpreted as reflecting the
opinions of these organizations,
but only of the individuals who
signed them. I was a witness of
the 1971 incidents and agree that
academic freedom was en

Grannies pack TNT?
I agree wholeheartedly with
the authors of the letter (Daily,
May 15) expressing disgust at the
way Jack-in-the-Box is wantonly

blasting its clowns in television
commercials. While I think this is
of great importance, something
that is far more serious is the way
apparently innocent little old
grannies are portrayed as
dynamite-packing delinquents.
One should not underestimate
the power of the role model in
modern-day California, and
don't think that our aged folk
have not been affected. It you
need proof of this, let me tell you
what I saw from my bedroom
window last Sunday afternoon.
A dear old lady hobbled up to
the rosebush in the middle of our
front lawn and began to stack
TNT around it in a wide circle. I
went out to intercede before the
situation got out of hand, but as
soon as the granny saw me she
knocked me cold with a length of
salami and limped off down the
road screaming "Waste it. waste
it."
It is difficult to see what
grudge this dear old woman
could have born against my
rosebush, which had just
bloomed with splendid red flow
ers. I imagine that through fail

ing eyes it must have borne a
strong resemblance to a clown.
Worse than this are the packs
of grannies that now cruise Palo
Alto late at night, gunning the
engines ol their Plymouth Val
iants to scare unwary cyclists.
The streets just aren't sate lor
young people anymore.
I suppose we should be grate
ful to Jack-in-the-Box lor
reawakening a portion ot the
population that we thought was
last asleep in front ot the televi
sion. However. I would like to
know whether they are prepared
to compensate us for the loss of
our rosebushes.

ing support and help offered to
us after the Storey fire. Never
can we repay the kindness show n
to us — the housing offers, the
clothing and money donations

were more than we could ever
have asked for.
We would especially like to
thank Roth and Lathrop houses
and the Sigma Chi and Deke
fraternities for the time they
spent organizing and supporting
community projects which
helped us greatly.
Also, our thanks to the faculty
members who were understand
ing about the difficulties of our
academic situation so near the
end of winter quarter. Diana
Conklin, Mike Becker, and the
rest of the Row staff deserve our
special thanks for their super
human efforts to give individual
attention to the needs of each
member of Storey.
Way to go, everybody. You

Plan conferences
I am one of the students who
took an active part in the recent
conference on East European
workers, both in the organiza
tion of the event and in com
menting on papers presented

here.
This con fere nee was the first
of its type at Stanford, for stu
dents were allowed to both run
and organize it. We are all very
grateful to Prof. Jan Triska for
having given us this opportunity.
I strongly urge that there he
more student involvement in the
many conferences held here.
Stanford is for undergraduate
education. This education would
he greatly enhanced if the stu

Harris superb
I worked backstage both days
at the blucgrass festival, and I

felt that it was a great concert,
just like the author of that article
covering the festival maintained.
I violently disagree, however,
with his description of Emmylou
Harrisas"plastic" and "unreal."
I have been a fan of hers for a
long time, and I felt that she was
superb. The writer thought she
was "plastic" probably because
she stood out so much from the
other musicians with her fine
voice, and because he had never
heard of her before.
And by the way, the name of
the song is "To Daddy," not
" Mama Never Did Tell Daddy."
C'mon. At least get a critic who
knows the names of the songs,
and can do legitimate justice to a
great country singer.

Grannies pack TNT?
I agree wholeheartedly with
the authors of the letter (Daily,
May 15) expressing disgust at the
way Jack-in-the-Box is wantonly

blasting its clowns in television
commercials. While I think this is
of great importance, something
that is far more serious is the way
apparently innocent little old
grannies are portrayed as
dynamite-packing delinquents.
One should not underestimate
the power of the role model in
modern-day California, and
don't think that our aged folk
have not been affected. It you
need proof of this, let me tell you
what I saw from my bedroom
window last Sunday afternoon.
A dear old lady hobbled up to
the rosebush in the middle of our
front lawn and began to stack
TNT around it in a wide circle. I
went out to intercede before the
situation got out of hand, but as
soon as the granny saw me she
knocked me cold with a length of
salami and limped off down the
road screaming "Waste it. waste
it."
It is difficult to see what
grudge this dear old woman
could have born against my
rosebush, which had just
bloomed with splendid red flow
ers. I imagine that through fail

ing eyes it must have borne a
strong resemblance to a clown.
Worse than this are the packs
of grannies that now cruise Palo
Alto late at night, gunning the
engines ol their Plymouth Val
iants to scare unwary cyclists.
The streets just aren't sate lor

I suppose we should be grate

Grannies pack TNT?
I agree wholeheartedly with
the authors of the letter (Daily,
May 15) expressing disgust at the
way Jack-in-the-Box is wantonly

blasting its clowns in television
commercials. While I think this is
of great importance, something
that is far more serious is the way
apparently innocent little old
grannies are portrayed as
dynamite-packing delinquents.
One should not underestimate
the power of the role model in
modern-day California, and
don't think that our aged folk
have not been affected. It you
need proof of this, let me tell you
what I saw from my bedroom
window last Sunday afternoon.
A dear old lady hobbled up to
the rosebush in the middle of our
front lawn and began to stack
TNT around it in a wide circle. I
went out to intercede before the
situation got out of hand, but as
soon as the granny saw me she
knocked me cold with a length of
salami and limped off down the
road screaming "Waste it. waste
it."
It is difficult to see what
grudge this dear old woman
could have born against my
rosebush, which had just
bloomed with splendid red flow
ers. I imagine that through fail

ing eyes it must have borne a
strong resemblance to a clown.
Worse than this are the packs
of grannies that now cruise Palo
Alto late at night, gunning the
engines ol their Plymouth Val
iants to scare unwary cyclists.
The streets just aren't sate lor
young people anymore.
I suppose we should be grate
ful to Jack-in-the-Box lor
reawakening a portion ot the
population that we thought was
last asleep in front ot the televi
sion. However. I would like to
know whether they are prepared
to compensate us for the loss of
our rosebushes.

Storey thanks
The former residents of Storey
House would like to express
their appreciation for the amaz
ing support and help offered to
us after the Storey fire. Never
can we repay the kindness show n
to us — the housing offers, the
clothing and money donations

were more than we could ever
have asked for.
We would especially like to
thank Roth and Lathrop houses
and the Sigma Chi and Deke
fraternities for the time they
spent organizing and supporting
community projects which
helped us greatly.
Also, our thanks to the faculty
members who were understand
ing about the difficulties of our
academic situation so near the
end of winter quarter. Diana
Conklin, Mike Becker, and the
rest of the Row staff deserve our
special thanks for their super
human efforts to give individual
attention to the needs of each
member of Storey.
Way to go, everybody. You
were great!

Plan conferences
I am one of the students who
took an active part in the recent
conference on East European
workers, both in the organiza
tion of the event and in com
menting on papers presented

here.
This con fere nee was the first
of its type at Stanford, for stu
dents were allowed to both run
and organize it. We are all very
grateful to Prof. Jan Triska for
having given us this opportunity.
I strongly urge that there he
more student involvement in the
many conferences held here.
Stanford is for undergraduate
education. This education would
he greatly enhanced if the stu
dents were gi\ en the opportunity
to he involved in more of the
conferences held here.

Harris superb
I worked backstage both days
at the blucgrass festival, and I

felt that it was a great concert,
just like the author of that article
covering the festival maintained.
I violently disagree, however,
with his description of Emmylou
Harrisas"plastic" and "unreal."
I have been a fan of hers for a
long time, and I felt that she was
superb. The writer thought she
was "plastic" probably because
she stood out so much from the
other musicians with her fine
voice, and because he had never
heard of her before.
And by the way, the name of
the song is "To Daddy," not
" Mama Never Did Tell Daddy."
C'mon. At least get a critic who
knows the names of the songs,
and can do legitimate justice to a
great country singer.

1 am one of the craftspeople
who participated in the annual
Stanford Spring I aire. Some

Saturday. May 10. or the early
hours of Sunday. May 11. my
booth was vandalized. A large
sign (approx. 4IS" by <S" ) with the
word "buttons" in bright green
letters was stolen. The sign is
worth about $50 in materials

took to make it.
I want my sign back. If,
through this letter. I am reaching
the individual who stole it. or
friends of his. please telephone
me at (40N) 354-1444 or the

Vote no on Prop. 9
Those of us w ho are registered
to vote in California will have
several measures to consider on
June 3. The most famous is
Proposition 9. or "Jaws 11.
Manv people voted lor its pre
decessor. Proposition 13. be
cause they WwiL led up with
waste in government. However.
I have seen no cuts in govern
ment waste since its passage,
only cuts in vital services.
I work at a local high school
and 1 can assure that there, at
least, it's not administrative costs
that have been cut. There are
just as many administrators and
lust as much red tape as ever.
()l course classrooms are not
cleaned or repaired as well as
they used to be . and should be.
because the janitorial staff has
been cut. This is the story in
Atherton: you can imagine what
happens in East Los Angeles.
It passed. Proposition 9 will
not reduce government waste
any more than 13 did, and we
don't need more cuts made in
local ser\ ices like lire protection,
police, and schools.
We cannot cut an average of
$140 from state income tax
without gi\ ing up anything in re
turn. II there is less money, there
will be fewer services, or we will
pay user fees.
User fees hit hardest those
who are least able to pay. but
many people could accept paying
more through such lees il the tax

relief was spread equitably by
Proposition 9. It isn't.
The wealthiest three percent
of the population would get 30
percent ot the relief, 112 urther
more. the federal government
would get another SI billion in
income taxes because we'd have
less state taxes to deduct.
Proposition 9 is destructive
and unfair. I urge everyone to
\ote against it.

Rosenzweig right
As a member of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)
and the Association of American
University Professors (AAUP) I
wish to publicly disassociate my
self from recent statements is
sued by the Executive Director
of ACLU of Northern California
and by the Executive Committee
of the Stanford Chapter of
AAUP in connection with the
ongoing review by the Advisory
Board in the matter of former
Stanford Prof. Bruce Franklin.
I find the ACLU statement
shockingly lacking in fact, em
phasis and interpretation and I
agree with the analysis of this
statement made by Robert
Rosenzweig in the May 14. 1980
issue of the Campus Report. I
find the endorsement of the
ACLU statement by the AAUP
Executive Committee unwar
ranted.
Neither the ACLU nor the
AAUP polled their member
ships in connection with the
statements issued. Therefore, at
present these statements cannot
be interpreted as reflecting the
opinions of these organizations,
but only of the individuals who
signed them. I was a witness of
the 1971 incidents and agree that
academic freedom was en
dangered. not by the University,
though, but by those who wanted
to foist their views on the Uni\er
sity community by force and vio
