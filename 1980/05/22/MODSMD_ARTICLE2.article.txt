# Financial manager reports to ASSU Senate
## Special Events loses $20,000 
### Seth Zuckerman News Editor 
ASSU Special Events is about
$20,000 in the red so tar this year.
ASSU I inancial Manager Bruce Ben
dix announced at last night's ASSU Se
nate meeting.
In other business, the senate for
mally set up and funded the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Bureau, asked that
the University improve the social cohe
sion of one graduate student high-rise
in Escondido Village, and approved
without examination the recommenda
tions of the Nominations Committee
for next year's student members of
University committees.
The senate also decided to close to
the public the selection next Wednes
day ol next year's senate chair and ap
proved the May 7 election results,
ushering in the new senate.
Bendix blamed the Special Events
deficit on bad luck with the weather
and other unpredictable factors; "Uni
versity type problems" — the fact that

the University gives priority to
academic concerns in all instances
where a conflict arises between them
and Special Events programming; and
on the project's mistakes and lack of
time to promote all of its events effec
tively.
Also in his report, Bendix reported
that the ASSU Typing Service suffered
a loss of $KN6 winter quarter, almost
one-fourth of its operating budget, and
that he considered that loss "substan
tial." He said changes would be made
in the service or the service would be
closed before the beginning ol next
year.
According to Bendix's report, the
ASSU projects, excluding Special Ev
ents. brought in a net income of more
than $3000 last quarter.
The senate also set up the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Bureau and au
thorized a $2950 budget for its first
year of operation. The bureau will re
search and publish consumer informa
tion ot interest to students and respond

to students' inquiries or complaints, ac
cording to the legislation the senate
passed.
The bureau's first-year budget will
consist of a loan from the ASSU that
the bureau will attempt to repay by
securing a lee assessment next spring
quarter for the following fall.
ASSU Associate Financial Manager
Steve Davis, whom Bendix officially
announced will be next year's ASSU
financial manager, expressed displea
sure with the arrangement, calling it
"unacceptable" and asking that the se
nate not make a loan that is likely to
become a bad debt.
He pointed to the idea's proponents'
failure to seek a fee assessment this
spring — even though they had two
opportunities to do so — as evidence
that student interest might be low.
Davis suggested that the ASSU fi
nance the bureau from its discretionary
fund fall quarter, and expect the group
to obtain a fee assessment in a special
fall election.
Senate Deputy Chair Yvonne Miltz,
on the other hand, was a supporter of
the bureau. "It may be bad business,
but it's not a bad way to run a student
association," she said.
I lilt/ added that applying senate dis
cretionary funds to the bureau's fall
budget would leave too little money in
the fund for the other uses the new
senate may have in mind.
The resolution to establish the
bureau passed by a vote of 10 to 4.
The senate also voted K to 3 to close
to the public the portion of next Wed
nesday's meeting in which senators will
discuss and vote on next year's chair.
Only four of the original eight candi
dates for the post remain in the running
— incoming Sen. Steve Miller. ASSU
Elections Commissioner Doug Mitch
ell, outgoing Alternate Sen. Albie Ro
gers and junior Mark Swanson.
Miltz said confidentiality in the selec
tion process can help the process by
making people's comments more open.
Greene concurred, adding that nothing
was said at this year's closed session
that was improper.
Sen, Jonathon McGee, however,
stressed the public's right to see the
process the senate uses to select its
chair.
Several senators expressed a concern
that the new senate he allowed to
choose for itself whether to close the
meeting or not.
Incoming senators at last night's
meeting voted 12 to 9 in a straw vote
not to close the meeting, though some
of them said they merely wanted more
time to think it over and decide tor
themselves next week.
The senate also passed a resolution
asking the University to designate one
Escondido Village high-rise for people
who are more interested in social and
cultural activities within their resi
dence. Sen. Val Runge said people
treat the high rises "like an apartment
complex" in that they do not make an
effort to make friends within the build
ing.
To remedy this, the resolution he
sponsored suggests that neighborhood
coordinators be appointed for one of
the high rises and that social intra
residence activities be beeted up there.
The resolution passed unanimously.

but it's not a bad way to run a student
association," she said.
I lilt/ added that applying senate dis
cretionary funds to the bureau's fall
budget would leave too little money in
the fund for the other uses the new
senate may have in mind.
The resolution to establish the
bureau passed by a vote of 10 to 4.
The senate also voted K to 3 to close
to the public the portion of next Wed
nesday's meeting in which senators will
discuss and vote on next year's chair.
Only four of the original eight candi
dates for the post remain in the running
— incoming Sen. Steve Miller. ASSU
Elections Commissioner Doug Mitch
ell, outgoing Alternate Sen. Albie Ro
gers and junior Mark Swanson.
Miltz said confidentiality in the selec
tion process can help the process by
making people's comments more open.
Greene concurred, adding that nothing
was said at this year's closed session
that was improper.
Sen, Jonathon McGee, however,
stressed the public's right to see the
process the senate uses to select its
chair.
Several senators expressed a concern
that the new senate he allowed to
choose for itself whether to close the
meeting or not.
Incoming senators at last night's
meeting voted 12 to 9 in a straw vote
not to close the meeting, though some
of them said they merely wanted more
time to think it over and decide tor
themselves next week.
The senate also passed a resolution
asking the University to designate one
Escondido Village high-rise for people
who are more interested in social and
cultural activities within their resi
dence. Sen. Val Runge said people
treat the high rises "like an apartment
complex" in that they do not make an
effort to make friends within the build
ing.
To remedy this, the resolution he
sponsored suggests that neighborhood
coordinators be appointed for one of
the high rises and that social intra
residence activities be beeted up there.
The resolution passed unanimously.
ASSU Special Events is about
$20,000 in the red so tar this year.
ASSU I inancial Manager Bruce Ben
dix announced at last night's ASSU Se
nate meeting.
In other business, the senate for
mally set up and funded the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Bureau, asked that
the University improve the social cohe
sion of one graduate student high-rise
in Escondido Village, and approved
without examination the recommenda
tions of the Nominations Committee
for next year's student members of
University committees.
The senate also decided to close to
the public the selection next Wednes
day ol next year's senate chair and ap
proved the May 7 election results,
ushering in the new senate.
Bendix blamed the Special Events
deficit on bad luck with the weather
and other unpredictable factors; "Uni
versity type problems" — the fact that

the University gives priority to
academic concerns in all instances
where a conflict arises between them
and Special Events programming; and
on the project's mistakes and lack of
time to promote all of its events effec
tively.
Also in his report, Bendix reported
that the ASSU Typing Service suffered
a loss of $KN6 winter quarter, almost
one-fourth of its operating budget, and
that he considered that loss "substan
tial." He said changes would be made
in the service or the service would be
closed before the beginning ol next
year.
According to Bendix's report, the
ASSU projects, excluding Special Ev
ents. brought in a net income of more
than $3000 last quarter.
The senate also set up the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Bureau and au
thorized a $2950 budget for its first
year of operation. The bureau will re
search and publish consumer informa
tion ot interest to students and respond

to students' inquiries or complaints, ac
cording to the legislation the senate
passed.
The bureau's first-year budget will
consist of a loan from the ASSU that
the bureau will attempt to repay by
securing a lee assessment next spring
quarter for the following fall.
ASSU Associate Financial Manager
Steve Davis, whom Bendix officially
announced will be next year's ASSU
financial manager, expressed displea
sure with the arrangement, calling it
"unacceptable" and asking that the se
nate not make a loan that is likely to
become a bad debt.
He pointed to the idea's proponents'
failure to seek a fee assessment this
spring — even though they had two
opportunities to do so — as evidence
that student interest might be low.
Davis suggested that the ASSU fi
nance the bureau from its discretionary
fund fall quarter, and expect the group
to obtain a fee assessment in a special
fall election.
Senate Deputy Chair Yvonne Miltz,
on the other hand, was a supporter of
the bureau. "It may be bad business,
