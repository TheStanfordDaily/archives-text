## Wrong to tamper with Daily 
### 
In the last few days many people have con
demned the Daily for its reaction to the May 2nd
Hammer and Coffin "prank." Some feel that the
Daily is being too vindictive, or that its reputation
is being overblown by its haughty staff. Those
people are certainly entitled to their opinions, so I
won't engage in endless debate on these subjective
statements.
However, I would like to address the claims of
those who say the "prank" wouldn't have been so
bad if only the subject matter of the hoax was
different, and more specifically I'd like tocomment
on the feeling running through some letters that it's
quite all right to tamper with or defraud the Daily,
any time and any place.
It seems that during the last few years, this cam
pus has been blessed with a number of people who
really don't understand how publishing or"the real
world" operate.
You see. Virginia, there are these state and fed
eral laws prohibiting such things as libel, malicious
mischief, and copyright infringement, and. believe
it or not. these laws don't contain any exceptions
for college newspapers or college students! But, of
course, how silly of me to forget the well-known
senses of humor that college students possess.
Those who approve of a "little fun" at the Daily's
expense (through inserting unauthorized materials
into copies of an issue, throwing copies into gar
bage cans, or changing the front page) might find it

amusing if others removed their term paper from
the professor's department mailbox and substi
tuted one which they had specially prepared.
Come on now, after you've received a "D" for
the course, the pranksters will no doubt gladly
return your paper and let you handle the incident
with a gracious and understanding professor. Or
perhaps these benevolent types might find life even
more knee-slapping if some people put up flyers
(and even put an ad in the Daily!) announcing a
new pizza company offering free pi/zas to the first
100 callers, and these people just happened to put
your room phone number on the flyer.
The strangest part of all these letters approving
"game-playing" with the Daily is that by the time
most people arrive in college, they have usually
been taught to respect other people's property. At
the very least, college students are recognized for
their ability to point out continually their maturity
and demand their rights and property.
Perhaps I've been too harsh. Maybe it's just too
difficult forcommunity members to remember that
behind all those pages of gray newsprint, there arc
people. Or maybe it's just that behind all the daily
cries we hear on campus for egalitarianism, non
violence. and social justice, there are those who do
indeed believe that others aren't entitled to the
same rights and respect to which they are.
