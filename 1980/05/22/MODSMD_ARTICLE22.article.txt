## Curran playing neurotic, magnetic 'Song' 
### 
Neil Simon has the bad habit
of borrowing a lot ol his material
from Neil Simon. Hut. happily
(and somewhat curiously), to
good effect. They're I'laying Our
Song, now on a nine-week run at
the Curran. is a winner.
Comparison with two other
lairlv recent Simon hits. The
Goodbye Girl and Chapter Two.
is practically unavoidable. We
have the same neurotic, high
strung. but strangely magnetic
single man and single woman.
They meet, fall in love, become
more neurotic, break up and
then presto, they're back to
gether one minute before the
final curtain.
Simon's typewriter ribbon has
become a little threadbare. But
with some 200 new one-liners, a
delightful and complementary
musical score — music by Mar
sin llamlisch (A Chorus Line).
lyrics by Carole Bayer Sager —
and some impeccable acting and
expert production, we can ex
cuse the over-used plot. The
evening is simply a lot ol fun.
The flavor of this play is dis
tinctly New York. A stuffed shirt
pop composer and winner of an
Oscar and two Tonics is all cased
up in his plush Central Park West
apartment about to "create"
with a gangly, painfully self
conscious neophyte. Soni> is sup

posedly based on the real-lite
goings-on of Hamlisch and
Sager. but, with a few minor ad
justments. it could very easily be
Woody Allen and Diane Kcaton.
Naturally, to begin a dramatic
confrontation, she arrives late,
this circumstance setting much ol
the tone for the rest ol the play.
Vernon Gersch (Victor Garber),
meet Sonia Walsk (Marsha
Skaggs)! After some wry humor
and witty back talk, the Inst
"creation" — a beautiful ballad
called "I all in' " — and their ir
resistible tendency to miss and
miss-time each other, what else
but to tail in love?
We have to wonder about this
illogical match of two people
barely able to contain their own
sanity, much less someone else's.
Do they really tall in lo\ e? Or do
we instead see Simon himscll
looming up before us. the union
of Vernon and Sonia turning into
a new breeding ground for Ins
marvelous "talent" with words?
Cuteness reaches its all-time
peak by the end of the first act.
But — a credit to Simon
somehow the romance works:
we are rolling with every joke.
The constant gibing, the idiosyn
crasies of Sonia always wearing a
costume from a Broadway play
and Vernon expressing himself
to his tape recorder, the "voices"

each hears — three Somas and
three Vernons that represent
other sides ol the two pro
tagonists — and the haunting
presence of I eon the "second
man" whom we newer see and
the catalyst in the inevitable
break-up of the couple — are
Simon specialties.
The jokes are all well-timed
and enhanced by the clever lyrics
and happy, tuneful music of the
nine songs. The orchestra under
the musical direction of Jack F"v
erly is comfortably loud and
tight. The singing is very good;
though Garber lacks somewhat
on range, he makes up lor it at his
piano. Ihe dancing, choreog
raphed by I'atricia Birch, is
equally tight and stunning, par
ticularly in the title song, and is
one more element that keeps the
pace sharp and alive.
No better word can describe
the production than fabulous.
Doimlas Schmidt's seenerv and

projections ;irc handsome, arty
displays that shitt with their own
musical rhythm. Tharon Mus
sel's lighting is tops and espe
cially skilllul with its hea\y use ol
follow-spots that gi\e the show
an added dimension ol theatri
cality. Ann Roth shares in the
I un with her lull range ol Broad
way costumes. Unusual, though,
is the numerous sccnc-shiltmg
and 011-stage sound amplifica
tion that bears a conspicuous re
semblance to 1 A.
Both Ciarhei and Skagg-> are
first-rate entertainers, wcll
\ ersed in all crafts of the musical.
Also important, they are good
looking and know how to he
Simon cute. Director Robert
More does a good job simpl\ by
not interfering with them and
brings script and production
nicely together. Bravo. Neil Si
