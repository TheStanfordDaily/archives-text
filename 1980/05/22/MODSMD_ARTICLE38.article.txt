Hie vouchers maj be applied toward

Annual decision

Directors.
The hoard is comprised of three fa
culty members, two stall members and
two students. It meets ;is nccessarv to

Rebates at the bookstore are not
new. Speed said.
"Many years ago. the bookstore ot
tered rebates; but when the bookstore
tell on hard times (about I I years ago)
we had to discontinue the rebates.
"When we got back on our feet, we
decided we needed to expand our op
eration before readopting the old s\s
tem."
Growth
Expansion of the bookstore took
three years. In the bookstore held
its grand opening. Speed said that since
the expansion, sales have increased
about 15 percent per year.
Before the expansion, the textbook
area and main sales floor were a park
ing lot. The employee area was the re
ceiving dock, and Speed's office was a
road. Speed s;iid.
Jack Friedenthal, professor ot law
md president ol the bookstore's Board
ot Directors, said "when I was a stu
dent here (1949-53) there was no
browsing room. Students waited in a
line outside and gave their book order
( tit the employees) and they'd get your
books."

Friedenthal explained that the first
rebate sy stem was implemented by not
charging state sales tax on purchases.
Thus, customers received a 5 percent
savings.
The first system offered rebates on
all items: the one next year will not.
I riedenthal explained that the re
bates are an attempt to bring a price
decrease in books and to maintain the
idea that "primarily we're a
bookstore."
Both Friedenthal. and student board
member Eric Miethke view the
reinstitution of the rebate system as the
realization ot a long-awaited dream.
"It's a tremendous step forward."
said Miethke. a senior in economics,
"it's the bookstore's way of reflecting
the support of the community."
Miethke said that a better run
bookstore with a pleasant, efficient
stall was the reason for increased sales,
which allowed for reinstitution of the
rebate.
"There's a team effort between the
management and staff at the
bookstore. Thcrebate is just a carry
over of this spirit within the commun
ity."
