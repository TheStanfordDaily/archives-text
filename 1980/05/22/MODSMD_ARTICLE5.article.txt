# St. Helens death toll at 14; search for 90 continues
## 
### Laurie Becklund Gaylord Shaw The Los Angeles Times 
VANCOUVER, Wash. — Au
thorities yesterday sought to expand
and improve coordination of the search
for 90 persons still reported missing
four days after Mount St. Helens' col
ossal explosive eruption, but the search
was stymied by poor weather and
bureaucratic confusion.
As state officials increased the death
toll to 14, President Jimmy Carter
signed an executive order designating
Washington state as a major disaster
area, then flew to the Pacific Northwest
for a personal inspection of the devas
tated region.
Carter's emergency proclamation
will free federal funds to assist state and
local governments and individuals to
recover from the disaster. No damage
estimates have been made, but au
thorities said the total surely would be
in the hundreds ol millions of dollars.
Some easing
Meanwhile, geologists said there ap
peared to have been an easing of the
peril posed by a huge dam formed by
the 300 billion cubic meters — three
fourths of a cubic mile — of debris that

was deposited in the Toutle River val
ley when the volcano's shattering blast
destroyed much of its summit.
Water backed up to the top ol the
200-foot-high blockage on Tuesday,
but Dwight Crandell of the U.S.
Geological Survey said yesterday that
the water levels seem to be dropping
because of seepage.
Because of this. Crandell said. "The
immediate risk ot large mud flows"
threatening 60.000 residents
downstream "is not as great as we pie
viously thought." At nightfall, how
ever. flash flood warnings still were
broadcast in the area.
Grounded
Thirty military helicopters had been
scheduled to resume the search lor the
missing at daybreak yesterday, but all
were grounded throughout the day by
fog, rain and low hanging clouds that
obscured \ isibility.
Relatives ol some of the missing
were so frustrated and angered by what
they called the confusion in govern
ment search efforts that they formed
private search parties and entered re
stricted zones by way of logging roads.
Estimates of the number of missing
persons continued to \ary widely.

The U.S. Forest Service said it had
been informed by the Washington
State Department of Emergency Ser
vices that persons were missing.
The Cowlitz County sheriffs de
partment issued an "up-to-the
minute" list ol missing that contained
69 names.
However, the clerk compiling the list
said no effort had been made to check
back to see il the people on it had re
turned home.
And. in an attempt to come up with
an accurate list encompassing all offi
cial lists, the Long View. Wash., Daily
News doublechecked the missing per
sons' lists and came up with 126 people
whose whereabouts were unknown.
Confusion
Perhaps in response to increasing
complaints that the information com
ing out of the search and rescue effort
was skimpv and contradictory, several
different agencies began to mount what
they called "coordinating efforts."
"All operations arc now under one
coordinator." declared Gene Smith of
the U.S. Forest Service at the Toledo.
Wash, airport, the base of the air search
effort that was called oft because of
rain in the volcano area. The coordinat
ing agency, he said, was the U .S. Forest
Service.
Smith was coordinating a briefing
session in which several agency heads
were attempting to prepare for body
retrieval when air searches were re
newed.
"Just bodies'
"We will be going in just for bodies,"
he said. "There will be no search for
survivors at all until the weather
clears."
"That's wrong, dead wrong." said
Col. Bruce Jorgenson, press spokes
man for the Arnu National Guard, a
few minutes later. "Our first priority is
the people who might be alive."
However, Sgt. Charles Foster til the
National Guard, who works directly
under Jorgenson. said that the priority
was indeed to bring out bodies unless
more precise locations for any missing
persons could be determined.
But. he stressed. "Our operations
are controlled by the Department ol
Emergency Services."
Nonetheless, a spokesman lor the
State Department of Emergency Ser
vices said that coordinating authority
for search and rescue operations is ac
tually vested by state law and county
sheriffs.
