# Albert Wall nearing final stages
## 
### Aparna Mehrotra Staff Writer 
Construction of the controversial Albers Wall may be
nearing completion after a delay ol nearly one year.
The project to build the N-foot-8-inch tall, 55-toot
long free-standing wall has been plagued with problems
ever since its construction plans began. A model wall was
erected in front of the Law School earlier but after strong
protest from the Law School faculty and students, the
site was changed to the present location.
The wall now stands half-built in front ol the Physics
tank. It runs cast to west and is precisely constructed so
as to receive light on both sides all day.
The completed side is white brick with horizontal
black chrome bars and the other side, currently under
construction, is supposed to be black granite with steel
polygonal designs.
Thus far, seven of the 16 granite slabs have been
inlaid.
According to Don Price, construction administrator
for facilities and properties, the wall is expected to be
completed by commencement this year. Originally it was
scheduled to have been completed at commencement
last year. However, due to scheduling problems at a San
Francisco marble shop where the granite slabs were cut
precisely to size and holes were drilled in to accurately

allow for the mounting of the steel design, the construc
tion was stopped and delayed further.
Earlier problems with the wall have invoK ed the color
of the bricks, the assembly and the finish of the stainless
steel rods of the sculpture.
Price emphasized the fact that construction planning
does not always have to occur on-site. The granite slabs,
for example, were in the marble shop since March of this
year. Due to the precise nature of the workmanship
involved, the project had to be completed very slowly.
The wall, as an art object, requires far more precision
and patience than an ordinary construction job. Price
said.
Price said a little mistake will lead to a tremendous
amount of extra expenditure and effort. Therefore, the
managers of the project prefer to proceed slowly but
surely.
Because of the fixed nature of the initial contract
terms, the cost of-construction of the wall has increased
only marginally, according to Roger Cairns, project
manager for facilities and properties. The original cost
was $ 1 ()(),()()() for the entire project.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen has been the chief supporter
and fund raiser of the project since 1971 when Jose I
Albers, a Yale art professor, donated the design to the
University.


Progressing a bit since its early stages at the begin
ning of the year (shown above), Albers Wall is
now half-built. The controversial piece ot art, lo-

cated in front of the Physics Tank, is supposed to
be completed by graduation next month.
