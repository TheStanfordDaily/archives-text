PHNOM PENH — -The \ letnamese are
m\ host friends because they saved me trom
Pol Pot and my worst enemy because I don't
know il they'll ever lea\e." This is how an
educated Cambodian recently expressed his
people's dilemma in dealing with the soldiers
in baggy fatigues and pith helmets who are
stationed in every corner of Cambodia.
Sixteen months after the invasion that
drove Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge from Phnom
Penh. \ ietnam shows no signs of reducingits
forces m Cambodia, estimated by Western
intelligence analysts to number 200.000.
Mea 11 while. a corps of advisers from Hanoi
is at work in the country's new civil administ
ration to assure that domestic and foreign
policy follow the Vietnamese model where
\ er possible. Through their efforts. Vietnam
is reali/ing its long standing ambition for an
Indochina federation dominated by Hanoi.
Ministries in Hanoi often assign a vice
minister to oversee policy at the counterpart
office in Phnom Penh. In the provinces. Vie
tnamese technicians and political off icers are
attached to local revolutionary committees.
In government, the supposedly sovereign
Cambodians often find themselves over
ruled One Westerner recently received
permission from Cambodian provincial au
thorities to \isit a certain district. But the
local Vietnamese adviser later vetoed the
trip on security grounds.
Childlike
Although well-disciplined, many Viet
namese comport themselves in line of a
longstanding Vietnamese belief that the
Cambodians are a childlike people unable to
woi k hard and who have made a mess of their
country lor centuries. Today, things arc only
a bit worse than usual, the Vietnamese think
ing goes.
The \ ietnamese make no secret of their
military presence in Cambodia, maintaining
their troops are here at the invitation of the
Cambodian government and will return
home when the threat from the Khmer
Rouge and China is over.

The Vietnamese guard most of the coun
try's bridges. In base camps off major high
wavs. they grow vegetables and tinker with
field guns. They stand sentry at Phnom
Penh's independence monument.
They live in the little apartments behind
shops, tents, spare buildings in temple com
pounds and whitewashed villas. They have
closed off entire blocks of Phnom Penh, ap
parently for use as quarters for their troops.
Gratitude
Officials in Phnom Penh maintain Cam
odians will show undying gratitude to Viet
nam for being the only country to help them
cast off the Khmer Rouge yoke. "Refugees
went west to Thailand. Retugees went east to
Vietnam." said one Cambodian official,
speaking of the Khmer Rouge years. "But
who sav ed us from genocide? Just Vietnam."
Among ordinary Cambodians, however,
sentiments seem not as simple as that. Al
though there was almost universal jubilation
after the demise of Khmer Rouge rule,
people question Vietnam's motives for flood
ing their country with soldiers.
A few refugees have suggested Vietnam
intended to kill oft the Cambodian people
through starvation and then settle the land
with its own people. Although no evidence
exists to support this theory, it demonstrates
the extreme of people's distrust.
Wealth
Others suggest Vietnam wants to strip
Cambodia of what little wealth it has. A
young trader from Kompong Cham Pro
vince. for example, claimed to have seen
troops sending cars, tractors and engines
back to Vietnam w hen they first captured the
province last year.
Many Cambodians believe the Viet
namese have made off with art from the tem
ple complex at Angkor and the former royal
palace in the capital. Thirty Vietnamese are
currently stationed at the palace.
Cambodians don't have time to worry
about these issues. Meanwhile, they are still
exposed to the petty irritations of life with a
foreign armv in their midst: sentries rudely

turn people away from government offices,
rural outposts are supplied with rice while
surrounding villages get nothing.
Resentment
The Cambodians' resentment is clear.
People tell visiting foreigners this directly
when guides provided by the Foreign Minis
try are not in earshot and often give their
feelings away unconsciously.
For instance. Cambodians habitually use
the pejorative term Youan in referring to the
Vietnamese. When dealing with the soldiers
themselves, one is better advised to say "Vie
tnamese."
l or the present, most Cambodians appear
to have accepted the Vietnamese as a neces
sary evil — a group to tolerate, if not to love.
It the troops went home, it is felt, the Khmer
Rouge would make quick work of the teena
gers Phnom Penh has armed and put in the
uniform of a new Cambodian National
Army.
Dream
Although many Cambodians still dream of
the third alternative — an anticommunist.
anti-Vietnamese government, perhaps led
by former head of state Prince Norodom
Sihanouk — few seem prepared to embark
on the new round of war such a solution
would require.
Still, as memories of Pol Pot's horrors re
cede. the Vietnamese could find it increas
ingly difficult to maintain their welcome.
Many analysts believe they are taking a cal
culated risk in helping to arm and train Cam
bodians who could later turn against them.
By some reports there have been minor
clashes already.
In Phnom Penh last week automatic
weapons fire erupted around the railway sta
tion, lasting over an hour. Government
sources later said some Cambodian soldiers
had gotten drunk and began discharging
their weapons. But by other accounts, a Vie
tnamese security patrol had told the soldiers
to break up the party and was fired on. One
Vietnamese and three Cambodian civilians
were reported wounded.
