## Ayatollah overrules Bani-Sadr Iran executes 20 on drug charges 
### Jonathan Randal The Washington Post 
TEHRAN. Iran — The controversial re
ligious iiidge, Avatollah Sadegh Khaikhali.
vesterdav sent 20 alleged drug traffickers to
the tiring squad in yet another display of his
high-handed disregard for secular authority.
Brushing aside beleaguered President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's precise orders limit
ing his role as head ot the anti-narcotics cam
paign to investigation alone, the selt-styled
avatollah claimed to have broken the biggest
drug ring in the Middle East.
Spokesmen at Oasr Prison, where the
executions were carried out at dawn, said at
least two of those shot had been arrested only
two days ago and were included in the trial
already in progress.
It was believed the largest execution ot
common criminals here since the revolution
in February 1 979.
Avatollah Khaikhali recently defied
Bani-Sadr by destroying the shrine ot the
deposed shah's father, and he has made a
name tor himself for his summary notion of
justice. Among the more than 300 Iranians
who have been executed on his instructions

were 70 Kurds shot last summer tor a variety
of reasons having little to do with their al
leged participation in the autonomous
movement there.
Displayed remains
Khaikhali. who became well known to
Americans when he displayed the charred
remains of servicemen involved in the
aborted U.S. attempt to rescue the embassy
hostages, said he had turned down a $28.3
million bribe to spare the lite ot one defen
dant.
One woman was given a lite sentence at
the trial, and Khaikhali promised to ••com
pletely crush" the drug traffic.
As many as two million of Iran's 35 million
citizens are believed to be heroin or opium
addicts, and opium cultivation is said to have
increased markedly since the revolution.
'Imported drugs'
Khaikhali said the drugs involved had
been •'imported" from Afghanistan, Pakis
tan. Iraq, Persian Gulf sheikdoms. Britain,
France. Germany, Greece, Lebanon, Syria
and Turkey.
However. both narcotics used here are be
lieved to originate either locally or in Af
ghanistan and Pakistan, where they are ship

ped west toward more lucrative Western
European and North American markets.
Khalkhali said the tour-day trial had also
revealed that the traffickers had set up
"laboratories using new techniques to con
vert opium into heroin" in 13 provincial
cities "from where they are distributing the
drugs to various other points in the country ."
Under the deposed shaw Mohammad
Re/a Pahlavi. Western narcotics agents had
hinted at — but never confirmed — the exis
tence of such laboratories.
In a recent television interview. Khalkhali
said 900 kilograms or 19N0 pounds of opium
had been seized over a period of a week.
He also took a gratuitous swipe at former
prime minister Mehdi Ba/argan by lashing
out at his alleged "negligence and incompe
tence," especially his policy toward Kurdis
tan.
Khalkhali's backing tor a hard-line milit
ary solution in Kurdistan echoed earlier cler
ical demands made by Ayatrtllah Ruhollah
Khomeini. But the armed forces and Re
volutionary Guards appear as unable now as
they were a year ago to control Kurdistan
militarilv.
