ATHENS, Ga. — Arising
trom the depths of a seemingly
insurmountable deficit, top
seeded Stanford overtook
third-seeded UC-Berkeley 5-3
yesterday to win the NCAA
Tennis Championships for the
third time in four years.
When Cal senior Chris Dunk's
forehand volley Hew long past
the hoping eyes of Peter Rennert
and Lloyd Bourne in the No. 1
doubles match, won by Stanford
6-2, I -6, 6-1, it signified the end
of a grueling comeback by the
Cards and the beginning ol a
celebration of Stanford's return
to the throne as king of collegiate
tennis.
The path to that throne was
not easy. The Bears came out
hungry and looked as it they
might end the match before the
doubles ever got started, winning
five first sets in the six singles
matches.
After Rennert thrashed Cal's
Scott McCain 6-2. 6-4 in less
than an hour, it looked as if the
rain beating on the root of the
University ol Georgia Indoor
Tennis Complex might tall in on
the Cards.
Not five minutes after Rennert
won. Dunk walked off his court
with a 6-1, 6-3 victory over

Bourne. The ease with which
Dunk won was surprising, as
many thought this would be the
tightest match of the day.
Bourne had never lost a singles
match in four years of NCAA
championship tournament play,
bringing a 15-0 record into the
match. Simply put. Dunk was on
and Bourne was off.
"I wanted to get my returns
low and in," Dunk said, "and
take the pace off his serve. I
wanted to make Lloyd hit a lot ol
balls. When he didn't serve well.
I was able to exploit Ins second
serve more."
All eyes then turned to the
third court, where the No. 5 sing
les match was a seesaw battle, be
tween Stanford freshman David
Sieglerand Cal sophomore Mike
Bauer. They were well into the
third set. matching point for
point, and went into a tiebreaker
to decide the set and match.
Siegler took a 4-1 lead in the
best-of-nine tiebreaker, but
Bauer blitzed him, winning four
in a row, the last three on
Siegler's serve.
"1 played the first set well and
then I got overconfident." Bauer
said. "When 1 was down 4-1.1
didn't think of anything. Not
winning or losing: 1 was oblivious
to what was going on. I couldn't
do anything better."

On top of that, Marty Davis
got off to a fast start, then held
off a late challenge by Tim
Mayotte of Stanford to win the
No. 2 singles. 6-2. 4-6. 7-5. It
was a reversal ol the Davis-
Mayotte match at Maples Pavil
ion last month, won by Mayotte
7-6, 6-3.
"The courts are slower. Tim
hit all aces at Stanford. This time
I was able to hit a couple of
serves back," Davis said.
Cal was up 3-1, the Bears were
up in the clouds and Stanford
coach Dick Gould was up in
arms. " When we were down 3-1,
1 was thinking about my dinner
reservations tonight," he said.
"We were pretty far out of it."
Indeed they were. In the other
two singles matches, the Ber
keleyites had won the first set by
6-2 scores. But slowly, the for
tunes of the Cards began to look
a little brighter. Everything re
sted on the shoulders of No. 4
Scott Bondurant and No. 6 Jim
Glutei n.
If both players lost. Stanford
was out. It one lost, the Cards
were still in deep trouble, for
they had not swept Cal in dou
bles all year.
But both men won. Bondur
ant, surely the fiercest com
petitor east of Billy Martin.
