# Israel rejects Egypfs demands
## Begin refuses to reconsider Israeli position 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
JERUSALEM — Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin yesterday rejected with
unequivocal finality Egypt's de
mand that Israel reconsider its
position on East Jerusalem in
order to revive the suspended
negotiations on Palestinian au
tonomy in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Begin, in an interview with
The Washington Post, said he

would "regret it very much" if
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
attempted to use the Jerusalem
issue as a device with which to
withdraw from the negotiations
with Israel, after having won the
return of most of the Sinai Penin
sula.
But. Begin asserted firmly, the
responsibility lies with Egypt to
suggest a date for reopening the
autonomy talks, without the
condition that Israel reexamine
the Jerusalem question.

"It's up to Egypt," Begin said.
"If they want to continue, we
want to bring them (the talks) to
a successful conclusion."
Begin seemed unperturbed at
the prospect of missing the May
26 deadline for the conclusions
of negotiations about an au
tonomous Palestinian council.
He appeared almost serene in his
willingness to accept a hiatus of
the talks and the continuation of
the status quo in the occupied
territories and. at one point, said
international negotiations some
times last for many years.
"I suppose we should continue
our talks as agreed," Begin said,
almost indifferently. "But we
cannot give up our capital city,
for anything in the world. And I
don't think there would be any
argument in the world which
would convince anyone in this
country ... to redivide
Jerusalem for the sake of any
thing. We cannot do that, and we
won't."
Unhurried calm
The prime minister repeatedly
sought to convey a sense of un
hurried calm in the face of what
has been described by several
ranking Egyptian officials as the
worst crisis in the last two years
of Middle East peace negotia
tions.
"All of us need some pati
ence," he said. "It is a historic
conflict, lasting already for gen
erations, with so many wars, so
many attempts to destroy our
people. Some nations have con
ducted negotiations for many

years, (and) nobody saw any
thing exceptional in that."
By attempting to force a de
bate on an issue as sensitive as
Jerusalem, Begin suggested,
Egypt could only succeed in dis
rupting the orderly, methodical
pace that has characterized the
negotiations thus far.
Conflict
Egypt has insisted that the
100,000 Palestinians who live in
East Jerusalem, which was an
nexed by Israel after being cap
tured in 1 %7. be considered re
sidents of the West Bank of the
Jordan River and be made eligi
ble to vote in the proposed au
tonomous council elections. Is
rael has consistently rejected the
proposal, saying that East
Jerusalem is not occupied territ
ory but an integral part of the
Jewish state.
When asked whether he be
lieved Sadat seized upon
Jerusalem as a way to end the
autonomy talks. Begin replied.
"What conclusion should we
draw? To change our attitude
toward Jerusalem? How can we?
Yes. we repeat on any occasion
that Jerusalem is the capital of
Israel, an indivisible city, and so
it will be in the future."
The prime minister stressed
that Israel "never misled any
body as far as Jerusalem is con
cerned" and suggested that
Egypt's motive in forcing the
issue should be examined.
Up to Egypt
The prime minister stressed
that since Sadat suspended the

autonomy talks May 15 — for
the second time in a week — it
will he Egypt's responsibility to
propose a date for the resump
tion of the negotiations. This
cannot be done unilaterally,
however, but only in consulta
tion with Israel and the United
States, Begin said.
Begin sharply criticized as "a
negative interference" the initia
tive by several Western Euro
pean amend U.N.
Resolution A "
Israeli " p ' ed
territories but doesS^.
for a Palestinian stat^^li^^^^
"The so-called European
itiative can have very little re-1
suits," Begin said. "First of all, it
brings about the radicalization of
the Arab position, because there
are Arabs who say, 'Look, the
Europeans suggest to us a policy
of a state and the participation of
the PLO. How can we accepi
less?"
Accord undermined
Moreover, he said the Euro
pean move would undermine the
Camp David accords, upon
which the autonomy talks are
based.
Begin rejected the notion that
the growing violence in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza has
placed the principle of coexis
tence in question.
Referring to an upsurge of at
tacks on Israeli occupation
troops, Begin said,"lt happened
several years ago, too. Some
times, from time to time, it oc
curs. But I think it will pass."

erations, with so many wars, so
many attempts to destroy our
people. Some nations have con
ducted negotiations for many

years, (and) nobody saw any
thing exceptional in that."
By attempting to force a de
bate on an issue as sensitive as
Jerusalem, Begin suggested,
Egypt could only succeed in dis
rupting the orderly, methodical
pace that has characterized the
negotiations thus far.
Conflict
Egypt has insisted that the
100,000 Palestinians who live in
East Jerusalem, which was an
nexed by Israel after being cap
tured in 1 %7. be considered re
sidents of the West Bank of the
Jordan River and be made eligi
ble to vote in the proposed au
tonomous council elections. Is
rael has consistently rejected the
proposal, saying that East
Jerusalem is not occupied territ
ory but an integral part of the
Jewish state.
When asked whether he be
lieved Sadat seized upon
Jerusalem as a way to end the
autonomy talks. Begin replied.
"What conclusion should we
draw? To change our attitude
toward Jerusalem? How can we?
Yes. we repeat on any occasion
that Jerusalem is the capital of
Israel, an indivisible city, and so
it will be in the future."
The prime minister stressed
that Israel "never misled any
body as far as Jerusalem is con
cerned" and suggested that
Egypt's motive in forcing the
issue should be examined.
Up to Egypt
The prime minister stressed
that since Sadat suspended the

autonomy talks May 15 — for
the second time in a week — it
will he Egypt's responsibility to
propose a date for the resump
tion of the negotiations. This
cannot be done unilaterally,
however, but only in consulta
tion with Israel and the United
States, Begin said.
Begin sharply criticized as "a
negative interference" the initia
tive by several Western Euro
pean amend U.N.
Resolution A "
Israeli " p ' ed
territories but doesS^.
for a Palestinian stat^^li^^^^
"The so-called European
itiative can have very little re-1
suits," Begin said. "First of all, it
brings about the radicalization of
the Arab position, because there
are Arabs who say, 'Look, the
Europeans suggest to us a policy
of a state and the participation of
the PLO. How can we accepi
less?"
Accord undermined
Moreover, he said the Euro
pean move would undermine the
Camp David accords, upon
which the autonomy talks are
based.
Begin rejected the notion that
the growing violence in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza has
placed the principle of coexis
tence in question.
Referring to an upsurge of at
tacks on Israeli occupation
troops, Begin said,"lt happened
several years ago, too. Some
times, from time to time, it oc
curs. But I think it will pass."
JERUSALEM — Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin yesterday rejected with
unequivocal finality Egypt's de
mand that Israel reconsider its
position on East Jerusalem in
order to revive the suspended
negotiations on Palestinian au
tonomy in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Begin, in an interview with
The Washington Post, said he

would "regret it very much" if
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
attempted to use the Jerusalem
issue as a device with which to
withdraw from the negotiations
with Israel, after having won the
return of most of the Sinai Penin
sula.
But. Begin asserted firmly, the
responsibility lies with Egypt to
suggest a date for reopening the
autonomy talks, without the
condition that Israel reexamine
the Jerusalem question.

"It's up to Egypt," Begin said.
"If they want to continue, we
want to bring them (the talks) to
a successful conclusion."
Begin seemed unperturbed at
the prospect of missing the May
26 deadline for the conclusions
of negotiations about an au
tonomous Palestinian council.
He appeared almost serene in his
willingness to accept a hiatus of
the talks and the continuation of
the status quo in the occupied
territories and. at one point, said
international negotiations some
times last for many years.
"I suppose we should continue
our talks as agreed," Begin said,
almost indifferently. "But we
cannot give up our capital city,
for anything in the world. And I
don't think there would be any
argument in the world which
would convince anyone in this
country ... to redivide
Jerusalem for the sake of any
thing. We cannot do that, and we
won't."
Unhurried calm
The prime minister repeatedly
sought to convey a sense of un
hurried calm in the face of what
has been described by several
ranking Egyptian officials as the
worst crisis in the last two years
of Middle East peace negotia
tions.
"All of us need some pati
ence," he said. "It is a historic
conflict, lasting already for gen
erations, with so many wars, so
many attempts to destroy our
people. Some nations have con
ducted negotiations for many

years, (and) nobody saw any
thing exceptional in that."
