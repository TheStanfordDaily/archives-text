# Cubans take stand against U.S.
## 
### Robert Ohman The Associated Press 
HAVANA, Cuba — Or
ganized groups of Cubans gather
each day to chant abusive slo
gans in front of homes left by the
refugees who fled their country
for the United States.
Such "manifestaciones," regu
lar occurrences in neighbor
hoods throughout the capital and
other Cuban cities, are planned
by the Communist Party block
organizations, and the targets
are Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro's
communist government.
Some of the homes are vacant.
The owners had already left for
Mariel, the port city west of
Havana where some 68,000 Cu
bans have boarded small boats
for the risky 90-mile voyage to
Key West, Fla., and a new life in

America.
In other buildings, relatives
and friends who stayed behind
suffer the abuse.
Posters taped to the buildings
show worms and rodents climb
ing into a garbage can marked
with the U.S. flag, or a long
nosed Uncle Sam acting the pied
piper and followed by a string of
rats. Other signs label the owners
scum and riff-raff.
At a small park off Avenida,
23 crowds gather at ice cream
stands. Nearby is the former Hil
ton Hotel, now the Havana Libre
Hotel, where huge portraits of
Lenin decorate a hall that adver
tises seminars on Marxism three
days a week.
One taxi driver spoke proudly
of his small, Soviet-made Lada

auto. "It's strong and doesn't use
much gas," he said. Among
other recently imported cars are
112 iats from Italy and Chevrolets
built in Argentina, but the most
common private cars are still
pre-1959 U.S. autos, held to
gether with locally-made parts
and determination.
All stores and shops are state
owned. Selections are limited.
The busy stores are butcher
shops and others selling rationed
items, and lines of customers ex
tend into the streets.
Radio Reloj, an all-news sta
tion. broadcast frequent reports
of the weekend racial riots in
Miami, pointing out that the
thousands of Cubans who fled
their homeland in the past month
went to Florida.
