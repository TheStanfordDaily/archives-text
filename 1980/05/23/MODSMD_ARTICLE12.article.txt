### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Native American dance contests, arts and crafts
booths, and food stands will till the intramural
fields by the stadium this weekend.
The ninth annual Pow-wow festival attracts
about 7000 people each year. It will be held from 1
p.m. to midnight Saturday and from 1 to 11 p.m.
Sunday.
Pow-wow committee member Cindy Alex said
the pow-wow is "a place where Indian people can
get together and renew their acquaintances."
Dancers can enter any of eight contest
categories. The men's fancy dance and women's
buckskin contests offer a $150 first-place cash
prize.
Cultural activities include a native American
food sale in White Plaza and a dance held tonight in
Zapata with the band Slade Brown.
Admission to all activities is free.
I lerman Agoyo, director of the All-Indian Pue
blo Council Tricentennial Commission, discussed

the 16K0 Pueblo Indian Revolt and past and pre
sent New Mexican Pueblo Indian lifestyles in
Roble last night.
Pow-wow committee member John Gonzales
said the 1680 revolt was the first successful revolt
in America.
"Spaniards came in and brought their mis
sionaries along and tried to Christianize many of
the Indians and convert them to a non-Indian way
of life," he said.
He added that Pueblo Indians have generally
had a peaceful relationship with non-Indian
people, but that they suffered "general persecution
by the Spaniards."
The New Mexican Pueblos are now primarily
agricultural.
The Tricentennial Commission is designed to
"educate many of the people in New Mexico, said
Gonzales.
Agoyo has brought his exhibit to several univer
sities outside of New Mexico to explain the 19 New
Mexican pueblos.
