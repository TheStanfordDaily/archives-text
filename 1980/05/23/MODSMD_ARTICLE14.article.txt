# Third person accountability questioned
## Adminstration investigates current Honor Code system 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
She didn't need to cheat.
Sally S. was obsessed with her
grade-point average. She was a
senior with a nearly perfect
academic record and big ambi
tions for getting into one, or
perhaps several, top law schools.
112. And, for a while at least, it
looked as though her chances
were pretty good.
Then things began to fall
. apart: her grades slumped and
she had to take some incom
pletes.
One day a history term paper
became due that the beleaguered
student could not produce in
time, at least with the qualities
I; necessary to get her the A she
wanted.
i So, she decided to cheat. She
plagiarized someone else's paper
and turned it in for a grade. She
was soon caught, suspended for a
i quarter and received no credit
b for the course.
Wayward ways
Last year 19 violations of the
. Honor Code were handled by
the University judiciary system
, — close to the average of IS a
|r year handled by the system over
the past 10 years. Of these, two
were for plagiarism, others for
forgery, receiving unpermitted
aid. or collaboration during an
examination, and others for
"misrepresentations of self,"

such as turning in someone else's
paper for a grade.
Over half of these cases origi
nated when students — a third
party — witnessed an Honor
Code violation and reported the
incident to a professor, as is re
quired by the code.
In spite of this small hut steady
flow of disciplinary cases, in
creased competition among
pre-professional students for
admission to law and medical
schools has caused some faculty
members, such as Assoc. Prof, of
Chemistry Hans Andersen, to
question whether the Honor
Code is always capable of keep
ing students from cheating or
catching those who do.
Exam proctoring
Disgruntled by reports of
rampant cheating in his Chemis
try 3 1 class — a course required
for pre-meds — Prof. Andersen
knowingly violated the Honor
Code himself several years ago
by proctoring his exams. Since
then, he has said several times
that although he does not cur
rently proctor his exams, he
would proctor again if he
thought it would be necessary to
prevent cheating among his stu
dents.
Students, he pointed out. do
not live up to the I lonor Code by
regularly turning in other stu
dents who cheat, so, he asked,
whv should he allow the cheaters

to get away with it?
"I feel some obligation to pre
serve the integrity of the exam
process and the grading pro
cess," said Andersen in a recent
interview. "1 don't think the stu
dents have the right to dismantle
that process by default.
Joke
"There seems to be a feeling
among the faculty, at least the
ones I've talked to, that third
person responsibility is regarded
as.somewhat of a joke, in that
I've heard of very few cases
where that (one student turning
in another) happened.
"Either you have a third-party
system that works," said Ander
sen. "or you have teachers proc
toring their exams. I don't see
any other way."
Such an attitude, however,
calls the basic premises of the
Honor Code into question, ac
cording to University Om
budsman John Goheen.
"When he (Prof. Andersen)
proctors an examination, he vio
lates the Honor Code. How on
earth can you ask the students to
follow the Honor Code if mem
bers of the faculty don't?" Go
heen queried.
Faculty team
President Richard Lyman,
when asked about Andersen's
comments, said that: "The
Honor Code is University policy,
and the faculty have to proceed

as a team rather than acting on
their own."
Expressing some sympatln lor
Andersen's situation, however,
Lyman said. "The chief point of
contention is the third-party re
porting clause (which states that
a student must report infractions
of the Honor Code). I think the
past several years have shown a
substantial movement away
from the original spirit in which
that clause was initiated." Stu
dents are now less willing to
police fellow students for cheat
ing during an exam, according to
Lyman.
In a recent survey of freshmen
conducted by Sally Cole of the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
it was found that, in fact, only a
minority, 14 percent, would
comply with the Stanford Honor
Code by reporting someone who
cheated on an exam to the in
structor. A slightly larger
number, 25 percent, said they
would "forget it." But the major
ity. the remaining 60 percent,
said they would find some other
way of informally confronting
thecheater without reporting the
person, such as recommending
the cheater turn himself in. or
telling the miscreant that he'd
been seen, but would not
threaten to report the incident.
Informality okay
Informal sanctions made by
students against Honor Code

violators are not discouraged by
the administration, especially
when they might prevent some
one from cheating, particularly
in an exam situtation.
"The Honor Code isn't a rule
so much as it is a state of mind,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. "That's why, with
third responsibility, the notion of
taking actions short of official
ones makes sense.
"Let's say we're in an exami
nation, and I see you copying like
mad out of somebody else's blue
book, and I say, 'Come on,
knock it off!' I start tapping my
pencil, clear my throat 42 times,
stand two feet away and breathe
over your shoulder, but 1 don't
report you. What am I doing?
I'm still protecting the system."
Nationwide difficulties
Such a relaxed attitude toward
the Honor Code is a luxury few
other universities have been able
to afford. Harvard, for example,
has always hired proctors to
monitor exams. Other univer
sities, such as Johns Hopkins,
Notre Dame and UC-Davis (the
only California state university
that has ever had an honor code)
either drastically modified or en
tirely scrapped their honor codes
i 11 the mid- i 970s to combat what
they viewed then as a widespread
cheating problem.
Stanford kept its Honor Code
through that period, in part be

cause a study, also conducted bv
Cole, completed during that time
showed that students at Stanford
cheated no more in 1976 than
they did in 1961.
Disapproval
"We are not at a place, nor
anywhere even near a place,
where people can feel comforta
ble cheating in public," said
Lyons. "That 1 don't think is due
to the third-party responsibility
— though I think it's a factor —
but 1 think it's because the
Honor Code does accurately re
flect the ethics of the place.
There are not many students
here who find cheating accepta
ble."
More widespread, but less sig
nificant problems with the
Honor Code stem from the fact
that only a small number of stu
dents know what the Code savs
or how seriously the University
views such "minor" infractions
as not using proper footnotes or
"borrowing just a paragraph"
from a text or other source. •
The problem of lgmSrahce of
the Honor Code extends to the
faculty as well. Cole pointed out.
Last year, for example, the re
sults of two take-home tests were
invalidated by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, because fhe
teachers did not allow enough
time for the students to dofriplfctb 1
the tests at home without being
tempted to cheat bv taking more

time than was allowed by the
teacher.
Other more cloudy Honor
Code issues that are frequently
misunderstood by students in
clude: when two students work
on an assignment, can each turn
the assignment in as his own?
Can someone look at someone
else's computer program to
debug his own? Is it legal to turn
the same paper in for more than
one course?
Working to combat ignorance
of the Honor Code, the Honor
Code Commission, chaired by
former Council of Presidents
member Mary Le Blanc, has
been advocating extensive public
outreach programs to educate
the Stanford community about
the code, what it says and what
demands it makes of both stu
dents and teachers.
'This year, the commission
held open meetings for discus
sion of Honor Code issues, as
well as sherry hours, and wrote
general letters M the faculty ad
\ising them what to do in-the
event that they witness an Honor
Code violation.
Because of the large turnover
and transience of the University
community, however, the com
mission has recommended that
publication of the Honor Code

said they would find some other
way of informally confronting
thecheater without reporting the

the cheater turn himself in. or
telling the miscreant that he'd
been seen, but would not
threaten to report the incident.
Informality okay
Informal sanctions made by
students against Honor Code

violators are not discouraged by
the administration, especially
when they might prevent some
one from cheating, particularly
in an exam situtation.
"The Honor Code isn't a rule
so much as it is a state of mind,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. "That's why, with
third responsibility, the notion of
taking actions short of official
ones makes sense.
"Let's say we're in an exami
nation, and I see you copying like
mad out of somebody else's blue
book, and I say, 'Come on,
knock it off!' I start tapping my
pencil, clear my throat 42 times,
stand two feet away and breathe
over your shoulder, but 1 don't
report you. What am I doing?
I'm still protecting the system."
Nationwide difficulties
Such a relaxed attitude toward
the Honor Code is a luxury few
other universities have been able
to afford. Harvard, for example,
has always hired proctors to
monitor exams. Other univer
sities, such as Johns Hopkins,
Notre Dame and UC-Davis (the
only California state university
that has ever had an honor code)
either drastically modified or en
tirely scrapped their honor codes
i 11 the mid- i 970s to combat what
they viewed then as a widespread
cheating problem.
Stanford kept its Honor Code
through that period, in part be

cause a study, also conducted bv
Cole, completed during that time
showed that students at Stanford
cheated no more in 1976 than
they did in 1961.
Disapproval
"We are not at a place, nor
anywhere even near a place,
where people can feel comforta
ble cheating in public," said
Lyons. "That 1 don't think is due
to the third-party responsibility
— though I think it's a factor —
but 1 think it's because the
Honor Code does accurately re
flect the ethics of the place.
There are not many students
here who find cheating accepta
ble."
More widespread, but less sig
nificant problems with the
Honor Code stem from the fact
that only a small number of stu
dents know what the Code savs
or how seriously the University
views such "minor" infractions
as not using proper footnotes or
"borrowing just a paragraph"
from a text or other source. •
The problem of lgmSrahce of
the Honor Code extends to the
faculty as well. Cole pointed out.
Last year, for example, the re
sults of two take-home tests were
invalidated by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, because fhe
teachers did not allow enough
time for the students to dofriplfctb 1
the tests at home without being
tempted to cheat bv taking more

time than was allowed by the
teacher.
Other more cloudy Honor
Code issues that are frequently
misunderstood by students in

on an assignment, can each turn
the assignment in as his own?
Can someone look at someone
else's computer program to

the same paper in for more than
one course?
Working to combat ignorance
of the Honor Code, the Honor
Code Commission, chaired by
former Council of Presidents
member Mary Le Blanc, has

Wayward ways
Last year 19 violations of the
. Honor Code were handled by
the University judiciary system
, — close to the average of IS a
|r year handled by the system over
the past 10 years. Of these, two
were for plagiarism, others for
forgery, receiving unpermitted
aid. or collaboration during an
examination, and others for
"misrepresentations of self,"

such as turning in someone else's
paper for a grade.
Over half of these cases origi
nated when students — a third
party — witnessed an Honor
Code violation and reported the
incident to a professor, as is re
quired by the code.
In spite of this small hut steady
flow of disciplinary cases, in
creased competition among
pre-professional students for
admission to law and medical
schools has caused some faculty
members, such as Assoc. Prof, of
Chemistry Hans Andersen, to
question whether the Honor
Code is always capable of keep
ing students from cheating or
catching those who do.
Exam proctoring
Disgruntled by reports of
rampant cheating in his Chemis
try 3 1 class — a course required
for pre-meds — Prof. Andersen
knowingly violated the Honor
Code himself several years ago
by proctoring his exams. Since
then, he has said several times
that although he does not cur
rently proctor his exams, he
would proctor again if he
thought it would be necessary to
prevent cheating among his stu
dents.
Students, he pointed out. do
not live up to the I lonor Code by
regularly turning in other stu
dents who cheat, so, he asked,
whv should he allow the cheaters

to get away with it?
"I feel some obligation to pre
serve the integrity of the exam
process and the grading pro
cess," said Andersen in a recent
interview. "1 don't think the stu
dents have the right to dismantle
that process by default.
Joke
"There seems to be a feeling
among the faculty, at least the
ones I've talked to, that third
person responsibility is regarded
as.somewhat of a joke, in that
I've heard of very few cases
where that (one student turning
in another) happened.
"Either you have a third-party
system that works," said Ander
sen. "or you have teachers proc
toring their exams. I don't see
any other way."
Such an attitude, however,
calls the basic premises of the
Honor Code into question, ac
cording to University Om
budsman John Goheen.
"When he (Prof. Andersen)
proctors an examination, he vio
lates the Honor Code. How on
earth can you ask the students to
follow the Honor Code if mem
bers of the faculty don't?" Go
heen queried.
Faculty team
President Richard Lyman,
when asked about Andersen's
comments, said that: "The
Honor Code is University policy,
and the faculty have to proceed

as a team rather than acting on
their own."
Expressing some sympatln lor
Andersen's situation, however,
Lyman said. "The chief point of
contention is the third-party re
porting clause (which states that
a student must report infractions
of the Honor Code). I think the
past several years have shown a
substantial movement away
from the original spirit in which
that clause was initiated." Stu
dents are now less willing to
police fellow students for cheat
ing during an exam, according to
Lyman.
In a recent survey of freshmen
conducted by Sally Cole of the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
it was found that, in fact, only a
minority, 14 percent, would
comply with the Stanford Honor
Code by reporting someone who
cheated on an exam to the in
structor. A slightly larger
number, 25 percent, said they
would "forget it." But the major
ity. the remaining 60 percent,
said they would find some other
way of informally confronting
thecheater without reporting the

Wayward ways
Last year 19 violations of the
. Honor Code were handled by
the University judiciary system
, — close to the average of IS a
|r year handled by the system over
the past 10 years. Of these, two
were for plagiarism, others for
forgery, receiving unpermitted
aid. or collaboration during an
examination, and others for
"misrepresentations of self,"

such as turning in someone else's
paper for a grade.
Over half of these cases origi
nated when students — a third
party — witnessed an Honor
Code violation and reported the
incident to a professor, as is re
quired by the code.
In spite of this small hut steady
flow of disciplinary cases, in
creased competition among
pre-professional students for
admission to law and medical
schools has caused some faculty
members, such as Assoc. Prof, of
Chemistry Hans Andersen, to
question whether the Honor
Code is always capable of keep
ing students from cheating or
catching those who do.
Exam proctoring
Disgruntled by reports of
rampant cheating in his Chemis
try 3 1 class — a course required
for pre-meds — Prof. Andersen
knowingly violated the Honor
Code himself several years ago
by proctoring his exams. Since
then, he has said several times
that although he does not cur
rently proctor his exams, he
would proctor again if he
thought it would be necessary to
prevent cheating among his stu
dents.
Students, he pointed out. do
not live up to the I lonor Code by
regularly turning in other stu
dents who cheat, so, he asked,
whv should he allow the cheaters

to get away with it?
"I feel some obligation to pre
serve the integrity of the exam
process and the grading pro
cess," said Andersen in a recent
interview. "1 don't think the stu
dents have the right to dismantle
that process by default.
Joke
"There seems to be a feeling
among the faculty, at least the
ones I've talked to, that third
person responsibility is regarded
as.somewhat of a joke, in that
I've heard of very few cases
where that (one student turning
in another) happened.
"Either you have a third-party
system that works," said Ander
sen. "or you have teachers proc
toring their exams. I don't see
any other way."
Such an attitude, however,
calls the basic premises of the
Honor Code into question, ac
cording to University Om
budsman John Goheen.
"When he (Prof. Andersen)
proctors an examination, he vio
lates the Honor Code. How on
earth can you ask the students to
follow the Honor Code if mem
bers of the faculty don't?" Go
heen queried.
Faculty team
President Richard Lyman,
when asked about Andersen's
comments, said that: "The
Honor Code is University policy,
and the faculty have to proceed

as a team rather than acting on
their own."
Expressing some sympatln lor
Andersen's situation, however,
Lyman said. "The chief point of
contention is the third-party re
porting clause (which states that
a student must report infractions
of the Honor Code). I think the
past several years have shown a
substantial movement away
from the original spirit in which
that clause was initiated." Stu
dents are now less willing to
police fellow students for cheat
ing during an exam, according to
Lyman.
In a recent survey of freshmen
conducted by Sally Cole of the
Dean of Student Affairs Office,
it was found that, in fact, only a
minority, 14 percent, would
comply with the Stanford Honor
Code by reporting someone who
cheated on an exam to the in
structor. A slightly larger
number, 25 percent, said they
would "forget it." But the major
ity. the remaining 60 percent,
said they would find some other
way of informally confronting
thecheater without reporting the
person, such as recommending
the cheater turn himself in. or
telling the miscreant that he'd
been seen, but would not
threaten to report the incident.
Informality okay
Informal sanctions made by
students against Honor Code

violators are not discouraged by
the administration, especially
when they might prevent some
one from cheating, particularly
in an exam situtation.
"The Honor Code isn't a rule
so much as it is a state of mind,"
said Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons. "That's why, with
third responsibility, the notion of
taking actions short of official
ones makes sense.
"Let's say we're in an exami
nation, and I see you copying like
mad out of somebody else's blue
book, and I say, 'Come on,
knock it off!' I start tapping my
pencil, clear my throat 42 times,
stand two feet away and breathe
over your shoulder, but 1 don't
report you. What am I doing?
I'm still protecting the system."
Nationwide difficulties
Such a relaxed attitude toward
the Honor Code is a luxury few
other universities have been able
to afford. Harvard, for example,
has always hired proctors to
monitor exams. Other univer
sities, such as Johns Hopkins,
Notre Dame and UC-Davis (the
only California state university
that has ever had an honor code)
either drastically modified or en
tirely scrapped their honor codes
i 11 the mid- i 970s to combat what
they viewed then as a widespread
cheating problem.
Stanford kept its Honor Code
through that period, in part be

cause a study, also conducted bv
Cole, completed during that time
showed that students at Stanford
cheated no more in 1976 than
they did in 1961.
Disapproval
"We are not at a place, nor
anywhere even near a place,
where people can feel comforta
ble cheating in public," said
Lyons. "That 1 don't think is due
to the third-party responsibility
— though I think it's a factor —
but 1 think it's because the
Honor Code does accurately re
flect the ethics of the place.
There are not many students
here who find cheating accepta
ble."
More widespread, but less sig
nificant problems with the
Honor Code stem from the fact
that only a small number of stu
dents know what the Code savs
or how seriously the University
views such "minor" infractions
as not using proper footnotes or
"borrowing just a paragraph"
from a text or other source. •
The problem of lgmSrahce of
the Honor Code extends to the
faculty as well. Cole pointed out.
Last year, for example, the re
sults of two take-home tests were
invalidated by the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs, because fhe
teachers did not allow enough
time for the students to dofriplfctb 1
the tests at home without being
tempted to cheat bv taking more

time than was allowed by the
teacher.
Other more cloudy Honor
Code issues that are frequently
misunderstood by students in
clude: when two students work
on an assignment, can each turn
the assignment in as his own?
Can someone look at someone
else's computer program to
debug his own? Is it legal to turn
the same paper in for more than
one course?
Working to combat ignorance
of the Honor Code, the Honor
Code Commission, chaired by
former Council of Presidents
member Mary Le Blanc, has
been advocating extensive public
outreach programs to educate
the Stanford community about
the code, what it says and what
demands it makes of both stu
dents and teachers.
'This year, the commission
held open meetings for discus
sion of Honor Code issues, as
well as sherry hours, and wrote
general letters M the faculty ad
\ising them what to do in-the
event that they witness an Honor
Code violation.
Because of the large turnover
and transience of the University
community, however, the com
mission has recommended that
publication of the Honor Code

inform the community about the
code.
