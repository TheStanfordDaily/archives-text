# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Support McCloskey 
### 
Republican — McCloskey
In the Republican race ior this district's rep
resentative, incumbent Paul "Pete" McCloskey
is clearly the superior candidate. McCloskey lias
represented the 12th district for the past 12
years, so he has gained experience and know
ledge of the Congress. E\ en more important, he
has built up \ aluable seniority. which gi\ es him
more influence in legislative decision making.
In comparison, contender Royce Cole has no
experience in the House ot Representatives and
no comparable track record.
We do not support McCloskey's National
Youth Service Plan, which would require all
18-year-old citizens to sen e in either a military
or civ ilian capacity, with benetits gi\ en accord
ing to the type of service chosen.
However, we find McCloskey a responsible
candidate overall and generally receptive to the
\ iews of his constituents. In his past terms, he
has made a concerted ettort to \ isit areas ol the
district and meet with constituents.

Democratic — No endorsement
On the Democratic side ot the 12th district
Congressional race, the Daily does not endorse
either of the two candidates, Kirsten Olsen or
Marc Strassman.
Olsen, a 37-year-old Palo Alto stockbroker,
is running for this district's representative for
the second time. In 197N, she received only 21.5
percent of the vote. Olsen has no legislative
experience, and the I'.S. Congress is hardly a
good place for on-the-job training.
Strassman, a 32-year-old Harvard graduate,
is currently a typist for a solar energy tirm and
has been active in recent anti-draft activities on
campus. Although he also is inexperienced, his
more serious fault is that many of his outlandish
ideas are simply out of touch with reality.
The Daily feels that neither candidate would
be an effective legislator and neither could do
an adequate job of representing the interests of
this constituency.
