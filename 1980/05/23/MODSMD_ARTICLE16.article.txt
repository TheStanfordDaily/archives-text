Republican — No endorsement
The Republican contest tor U.S. Senator is
jammed with seven candidates, none ot whom
the Daily endorses.
Leading the pack is tax slasher Paul Gann.
co-author with Howard Jarvis ot 197!S's win
ning Proposition 13 and of this election's Jarv is
11. Proposition K ). Gann is running on one issue:
the drastic reduction of income taxes in an effort
to halt inflation and to diminish the influence ot
government and its burgeoning bureaucracy.
Gann's position on this sole issue fails to ac
count for the many vital services provided by
the government through its tax revenues. The
adv erse impact of Prop. 13 on some state ser
vices has proven that private spending will not
simply replace public expenditures for certain
worthwhile and necessary projects.
Moreover. Gann seems to have forgotten that
U.S. senators must handle problems in many
areas, not just domestic economics.

The other major contender in this race is Sam
Yorty. former mayor of Los Angeles. We do not
believe that Yorty is qualified to assume higher
office.
The remaining candidates — state senator
John Schmitz, businessman Brian Hvndman,
executive James Ware, businessman Philip
Schwartz and Rav Hanzlik — have not distin
guished themselves in anv manner.
Democratic — Cranston
In the Democratic primary for U.S. Senator,
the Daily endorses incumbent Alan Cranston.
Seeking his third term. Cranston stands behind
a solid platform of hard work and experience.
As majority whip, the liberal senator has earned
the respect of his party compatriots and of his
colleagues in the Senate.
Cranston's three challengers — electrician
Frank Thomas, Mexico oil consultant David
Rees and self-described anti-busing clergyman
Richard Morgan — have little practical, politi
cal background to recommend them.
