# The 						'King of the Dings'... all rushed-out
## 
### 
This year's spring fraternity
rush went really bad for me — 1
got dinged by the Betas. KA's,
Zetes. Sigma Chi's. Delts,
SAE's, Phi Delts (and 1 didn't
even rush the Phi Delts!). the
Dekes, artd the DU's.
I was kind of bummed because
I've got some pretty close friends
in the fraternities — the Zete's
cook Edna and the Beta's cook
Pat. just to name a few. And also,
although I am the first to admit
that I'm not a total stud (Editor's
Note: Bill Kenimeries is not even
a partial stud.). I can't begin to
believe that 1 could be all that
bad (Editor's Note: He iswof'all
that bad." Try repulsive.)
Since there has been a lot of
controversy about fraternities
lately, 1 might as well tell you
about my coronation in "Ding
Kingdom."
It all started when I rushed as a
clueless freshman. At the Theta
Delt house this beautiful girl in a
sexy lowcut dress answered the
door and said. "Hi. my name is
Shelly. Let me take you to the
bedrooms."
1 just about flipped out! 1 was
so excited that I rushed every
night until my roommate told me
that those rush-hostess girls
didn't even live there. Oooh, was
I bummed.
To make things worse, the
president of each fraternity vis
ited me, and told me about the
"great advantages of living at the
other fraternities." Some even
paid me not to rush their house.
It was pretty much the same
my sophomore year, except that
more people knew me so I made
a lot more money. I was richer,
yes, but I still wanted to live in a
fratenity.
This year was even worse.
They were ready for me. Every
time I tried to rush somewhere,
the rush-hostess would erase my
name from the book right after I
signed it, and then give me a
name tag that said, "Easy Ding"
or just simply "Ding-Dong."
One girl even wrote "King
Ding" on my forehead with a
magic marker, and that's what
gave me my infamous name at
the frats.
And at some fraternities this
year I really blew it. I asked one
KA if he and the other brothers
were catching colds because they
were always sniffing that white
allergy medicine in their noses.
The KA house was just one of
the fraternities to ding me the
first night of rush.
It seemed like I was striking
out everywhere, and so I went
over to the Zete house. At first I
thought I might have a chance
because everyone was smiling at
me and said that they "couldn't
wait to see my picture Hashed on
the wall," but then I realized 1

was in big trouble when some
people threatened to "nude
walk" me, so 1 just sat dejectedly
on one of their broken chairs in
the corner.
Then some big guv walked up
and said to me. "Hey "lowlife."
my name is'O-ball.' 1 know that
all the brothers in this house hate
your guts and think that you are a
woosie. but you know, you're not
that bad for a woosie." I told him
"Thanks a lot. dude" and went
back to my dorm to think.

That night 1 looked back to see
how much 1 had gained during
the first part of rush. Besides 12
"Ding-Dong" name tags, a dirty
forehead, and one friend (and
you really couldn't call that "O
-ball" dude much of a buddy), it
wasn't very much. But I was al
most certain that the second part
of rush was going to be a lot bet
ter than the first part.
I was wrong. I knew things
were starting to go bad again
when I went on the Sigma Chi

canoe trip, and the brothers tied
a bunch of rocks to my feet "to
keep the boat in balance." On
top of that, they didn't even give
me a paddle so 1 could do my job!
Then I was eating dinner at the
SAE house when one guy stood
up and asked, "Any jokes?"
Then another brother im
mediately stood up and said,
"Yes, I would like to introduce
Bill Kenimeries, he's rushing our
house," and people starting
laughing and laughing.

There was only one place that
hadn't rejected me, the Delt
house, and so I decided to make
an all-out rush there. At first I
went up for dinner (going up to
the Delts for dinner has always
amazed me — it's like climbing
Mt. Olympus to watch 30 Zeuses
wage war), but I was five minutes
late that night, and all the food
had already been eaten. All I saw
were piles of bones. There must
be more politeness at piranha
feediniis.

I was early the next time I
came up for dinner, and every
thing was going fine until one
huge dude asked me why 1 was
rushing the Delts and 1 said, "be
cause that's the only place that
hasn't dinged me yet." He then
boomed. "We'll see about that,"
grabbed me and tied my body
into a rolling knot, and then got
some other giants and started
playing "fumble-recovery" with
me.
They then said that they had to
"clean da ball." and started dip
ping my head in their toilet. I still
thought 1 had a chance to get in
(they did look like they were hav
ing a lot of fun), so every time I
came up for air I would say,
"Thank you, why thank you
very, very much!" 1 think this
confused a lot of them, and one
then untied my body and threw
me down the hill.
I was walking slowly back up
the stairs to my dorm room,
every bone in my body crushed,
when 1 met three of my
neighbors — Laura. Kathy and
Allyn. They said, "Oh, poor
baby," took me up to my room
(Kathy had the legs, Laura and
Allyn trudged along with the rest
of my body), and then began giv
ing mc a soothing back-rub.
Then, as Leslie and Louise camc
in to help. I thought about what
had happened to me.
I had no chance to live in a
fraternity — besides being
dinged at 12 frats, the Theta Xi's
and Phi Psi said that they "just
had too many pledges this year,"

and the Roble 2-B Lions said
that 1 would automatically be
dinged if 1 even tried to rush
them.
Then, just as I was thinking
about some other place to rush, 1
saw two other girls, Dodie and
Anna Maria, come in to help
comfort me. And then, as 1 felt
these beautiful girls give me the
best back-rub of my life, their
fingers running through my hair
and soothing every inch of my
aching body, 1 quietly asked my
self. "Early-Date," why in the
iiudda' are you rushing?"

by ATO and Alpha Sig. This is
his last column for this volume.)
