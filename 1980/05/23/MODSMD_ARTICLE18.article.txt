## Delt action just a diversion 
### 
In regard to the letter titled "Delts take action"
< Daily, May 20) we are offended by the implication
that the two "activities" mentioned are isolated
incidents. In fact, they are merely symptomatic of a
pattern of violence and antisocial behavior which
has existed since the Delts were allowed back on
campus four years ago.
In just this year, and just at Theta Xi, the Delts
and their compatriots have destroyed a freezer and
stolen its contents, broken six windows and kicked
open the door to a locked and occupied ladies'
room. There have been other incidents, but to cite
them all will serve no purpose.
Usually it is not fair to condemn a house for the
actions of only a few of its members, but it is
obvious that, until now, the house has made no
effort whatsoever to curb its members' acts of van
dalism.
The attitude of the Delt house toward the prob
lem is best exemplified by a statement made by the
House Associate (R.A.), Bill Lawlor, before the
"University investigation" occurred. In the pre
sence of the house president, Al Duenas, Lawlor
told Theta Xi, "There would be more windows
broken, so we would just have toget used to it. . ."
This indicates a complete lack of "self
governance. . . and responsibility for the actions of

its members" on the part of Delta Tau Delta
Fraternity.
The action taken by Delta Tau Delta Fraternity
is a specious attempt to divert the University's
attention from the overall pattern of vandalism and
physical violence. In sum. the only thing the Delts
have done is try to substitute a cosmetic action of
no significance for real, lasting improvement.
