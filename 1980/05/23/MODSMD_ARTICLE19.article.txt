## Daly strengthens women, ignores men 
### 
Mary Daly's visit to Stanford
on May 14 has generated a good
deal of controversy on campus.
Her exclusion of all questions
from males has — rightly. 1 am
sure — been condemned as "in
tolerant and sexist." However,
organizations that were kind
enough to help pay for her visit
have been unfairly excoriated for
their part in it.
Those persons and groups on
campus who were asked to con
tribute to the expenses of Daly's
visit were not*"sponsoring" her
in the sense of formally affirming
support for her ideas. Most of
them were unaware that she re
fuses to take questions from
men. They depended on the

good faith of those of us who in
vited her to speak, and wel
comed her to campus; we are the
ones who should be asked to
provide a defense, or an apology.
Not all of us knew in advance
that she would exclude male
questioners, but we were famil
iar with her ideas and can hardly
have been surprised by her an
nouncement.
On the grounds of our most
fundamental principles as mem
bers of a university, we cannot
justify Daly's exclusionary pol
icy. We would have been out
raged if a speaker had refused all
questions from women and had
vented such spleen against them
during the course of a university

lecture. The only ground on
which 1 think 1 can explain,
though not defend. Daly's choice
is that it put the ancient shoe on a
new foot.
For the first time in their lives,
perhaps, the men in the audience
knew what it was like to be
treated as women throughout
history have been treated: to be
taken as parts of the inanimate
furnishing of the room, ignored,
ridiculed, made to feel, as Ned
Beach put it in his eloquent letter
{Daily, May 21) "insulted,
stereotyped, utterly de
humanized." That those were
feminist men, for the most part,
makes the situation especially
unfair; and, yet perhaps they are
the ones who are most likely to
be able to understand the paral
lel.
Daly said a good many things
in the course of her lecture that I
found uncomfortable, unpersua
sive. even downright silly — her
vitriolic attack on traditional re
ligion, for example, or her
cavalier dismissal of modern
medicine. 1 am unhappy that I
did not stand up to question
these statements at the time, and
to challenge her exclusion of
male questioners. Like most of
her audience, 1 was exhilarated
and exhausted, uplifted and be
wildered, at the end of an ex
traordinary two-hour mono
logue.
1 was too busy sorting out my
own reactions to formulate an
immediate coherent response.
Daly's arrogance and intoler
ance are not good models for

feminists, despite the strong
sense of celebration that she en
genders with some of her more
lyrical passages. If she means
what she says, however, she en
couraged enough independence
in her listeners so that we can
react selectively to her message
instead of swallowing it whole.
She strengthens women. It is too
bad that she has decided that she
can only do this by ignoring men.
1 am sorry that the men in the
audience were made into object
lessons rather than treated as
persons. I (and here I know I
speak for most Stanford
feminists) do not think that such
a stance accords well with our
goals for liberation for women or
men. Unlike Daly. I believe that
the university, dominated in the
past by patriarchal modes of
thought, is now making room for
the development of true feminist
scholarship and for the flourish
ing of women.
Women need some time to
ourselves to work through the
special features of our situation,
past and present. But if we are to
be true to our own principles, we
cannot countenance excluding
participation in dialogue by
males who are present at a well
publicized University function.
We. or our mothers and sisters,
know all too well what it feels
like to be treated as second-class
citizens; to try to improve our
own situation by putting men
down is hardly the most promis
ing route that we can take.
