# SAC, SASA representatives speak
## Campus groups debate draft 
### John Mason Staff Writer 
The theme was deterrence abroad
versus personal liberty at home as two
members of Students Against Soviet
Aggression debated two members of
Stanford Against Conscription (SAC)
last night. Appearing before an audi
ence of less than 20 people in Skilling
• Auditorium, the two student groups
discussed American foreign policy,
draft registration and the current
capabilities of the American armed
forces.
Representing SAC were David
Set/er, one of the debate's organizers
and a graduate student in biology, and
Bill fivers, the Libertarian Party candi
date for the 12th Congressional dis
trict. Students Against Soviet Aggres
sion were represented by Peter Pierce,
a sophomore majoring in international
relations, and by Tom Watts, a senior
economics major.

Watts set the tenor tor his side ot the
debate in his initial remarks, in which
he quoted a Soviet KCiB agent who
recently said, "We could harm the I n
ited States 20 times more than it could
harm us." This comment. Watts
explained, represented a significant
trend of growing adventurism in the
Soviet attitude toward America. Said
Watts, "Our reenrd to date promises a
continuing positive environment for
Soviet aggression." To stem this tide.
Watts advocated a reworking of
American foreign policy in which the
United States would "honor its com
mitments to its allies . . . maintain
peace . . . and create a balance of
power."
Evers. on the other hand, described
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan as a
defensive maneuver. "Russians," lie
explained, "tear Moslem. anti-Soviet
aggression in a country which is in their
own backyard."
Evers went on to characterize the
recent "Carter Doctrine" policy of
confronting the Soviets as an attempt
by government hawks to create a rally
ing point for Americans, and to cure
the U.S. of its "Vietnam Syndrome" —
the fear of intervening militarily ab
road.
Simultaneous goals
In response. Pierce argued that Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's plan foi draft re
gistration. and even more importantly,
the draft itself would help the United
States simultaneously meet a number
of its foreign and domestic policy goals.
I le explained that a conscription milit
ary force would give the United States
more manpower to defend its allies in
Western Europe and the Persian Ciull
without increasing the military payroll

and so creating an economic impetus
lor the government to abandon domes
tic social programs.
Pierce also reasoned that a failure to
maintain its military ranks would force
the United States into a nuclear con
frontation with the Soviets, "If we are
to have a safe, credible deterrent, it
must be a non-nucleai strike force."
Setzer took up the topic of the draft
for the SAC side, arguing that the cur
rent volunteer army — contrary to
some popular beliefs — is neither "too
small, too dumb, too poor, or too
black." He cited statistics which indi
cated that the active volunteer armed
forces have never been more than 1.6
percent shy of their quotas, and that the
current force has 25 percent fewer per
sons in the "below average intelli
gence" category than the old con
scripted military.
Image motivation
Rather, the real reason for Carter's
registration call was. Setzer claimed,
"to enhance Ins (Carter's) position as a
tough dealer."
During the ensuing period of cross
examination. Setzer went further,
characterizing the potential draftees as
"a bunch ol raw recruits who would
need I 10 days to be battle-ready."
Commenting on SAC's foreign pol
icy stand. Pierce described their views
as "neo-isolationist." and he inquired
about what the SAC representatives
would hav c done in the face ol the Nazi
aggression of the 14305.
In response, Evers said he opposes
the U.S. role as a global policeman,
remarking that."ln terms of am actual
threat to the United States (in the
'30s), I don't think there was one."
