## No draft, yes on Jarvis II 
### 
During the past year-and-a-half on this campus,
many students of widely varying political view
points — liberals, libertarians, socialists, moder
ates. etc. — have argued and struggled against the
draft and registration for the draft.
We who have opposed the draft, whatever our
ideology, have employed several arguments in
common. We have denounced conscription as in
voluntary servitude, as slavery. We have often de
nied that our bodies and our lives belong to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, to the Pentagon, or to any
other political functionaries. We have claimed that
every human being has a right and a duty to make
his own moral choices and to determine his own
personal values.
Supporters of the draft have dismissed these
constantly-repeated arguments as so much empty
rhetoric and have denounced anti-draft activists as
self-serving hypocrites concerned only with saving
their own skins.
Whether such criticisms are valid, whether the
Stanford students who have opposed the draft are
standing on moral principle or on simple hypocrisy,
will soon be put to the test.
On June 3, Californians will vott on Proposition
9, commonly known as Jarvis 11, an initiative mea
sure which will slash California state income taxes
in half.
Few, if any, Stanford students will gain notice
able benefits from Jarvis II; no one can seriously
claim that a student who supports Jarvis II is being
motivated by personal self-interest.
The only plausible reason for a Stanford student
to support Jarvis II is on the basis of moral princi
ple.
What principles might impel a person to support
Jarvis II? The same principles which Stanford stu
dents have enunciated as justifying opposition to
the draft.
A tax takes from a person part of the product of
that person's labor without his consent: the person
is forcibly compelled to devote some fraction of his
labor to purposes dictated by someone else.
Taxation is involuntary servitude writ large and
imposed on the entire working populace through
out their working lives. (The draft at least has the
virtue that it is imposed on people only during a
brief period of their lives.)
Or consider the claim of draft opponents that
people must choose their own values and make
their own moral choices. The purpose of taxation is

to ensure that people cannot individually direct
their energies and incomes to the causes and pur
poses which they personally deem most important.
Taxation takes responsibility and control from the
individual and transfers them to somone else — in
theory to the majority, in practice to the ruling
elite.
Taxation rests on the premise that people's lives
do partly belong to Carter and to other political
authorities and functionaries.
In short, the principles to which Stanford stu
dents of all political stripes have appealed in oppos
ing conscription apply with equal force and clarity
to taxation.
If you honestly and sincerely oppose the draft yr
compulsory national service as a matter of princi
ple, you must necessarily oppose taxation and sup
port Jarvis 11.
If you support the anti-draft movement but op
pose Jarvis 11, an honest observer can only con
clude that your position on the draft is dictated not
by principle but by expediency or by self-interst.
And let us not be misled by claims that tax-cuts
help the rich at the expense of the poor. In 1978,
according to the California Fair Political Practices
Commission (FPPC), in the battle over Proposition
13 (Jarvis 1) only two corporations contributed
more than $2000 to support Proposition 13: Host
International, $5000; and Lassen Land Co.,
$2500.
But, according to the FPPC, more than sixty
companies contributed over $2000 to oppose
Proposition 13; Atlantic-Richfield. $25,000; Oc
cidental Petroleum. $12,500; Standard Oil of
California, $15,000; Rockwell International,
$10,000; Bank of America and Southern Califor
nia Edison, $25,000 each; Southern Pacific,
$20,000; Pacific Telephone and Ford Motor Co.,
$15,000 each; U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Gen
eral Telephone, and Kaiser Aluminum, $5000
each; PG&E, $12,500; etc.
Obviously, the economically powerful are no
friends of tax reduction.
The issue raised by Jarvis 11 is and must be one of
principles, the same principles raised by the anti
draft movement. The supporters of that movement
can demonstrate that they believe their own
rhetoric by actively supporting Jarvis 11.

other political functionaries. We have claimed that
every human being has a right and a duty to make
his own moral choices and to determine his own
personal values.
Supporters of the draft have dismissed these
constantly-repeated arguments as so much empty
rhetoric and have denounced anti-draft activists as
self-serving hypocrites concerned only with saving
their own skins.
Whether such criticisms are valid, whether the
Stanford students who have opposed the draft are
standing on moral principle or on simple hypocrisy,
will soon be put to the test.
On June 3, Californians will vott on Proposition
9, commonly known as Jarvis 11, an initiative mea
sure which will slash California state income taxes
in half.
Few, if any, Stanford students will gain notice
able benefits from Jarvis II; no one can seriously
claim that a student who supports Jarvis II is being
motivated by personal self-interest.
The only plausible reason for a Stanford student
to support Jarvis II is on the basis of moral princi
ple.
What principles might impel a person to support
Jarvis II? The same principles which Stanford stu
dents have enunciated as justifying opposition to
the draft.
A tax takes from a person part of the product of
that person's labor without his consent: the person
is forcibly compelled to devote some fraction of his
labor to purposes dictated by someone else.
Taxation is involuntary servitude writ large and
imposed on the entire working populace through
out their working lives. (The draft at least has the
virtue that it is imposed on people only during a
brief period of their lives.)
Or consider the claim of draft opponents that
people must choose their own values and make
their own moral choices. The purpose of taxation is

to ensure that people cannot individually direct
their energies and incomes to the causes and pur
poses which they personally deem most important.
Taxation takes responsibility and control from the
individual and transfers them to somone else — in
theory to the majority, in practice to the ruling
elite.
Taxation rests on the premise that people's lives
do partly belong to Carter and to other political
authorities and functionaries.
In short, the principles to which Stanford stu
dents of all political stripes have appealed in oppos
ing conscription apply with equal force and clarity
to taxation.
If you honestly and sincerely oppose the draft yr
compulsory national service as a matter of princi
ple, you must necessarily oppose taxation and sup
port Jarvis 11.
If you support the anti-draft movement but op
pose Jarvis 11, an honest observer can only con
clude that your position on the draft is dictated not
by principle but by expediency or by self-interst.
And let us not be misled by claims that tax-cuts
help the rich at the expense of the poor. In 1978,
according to the California Fair Political Practices
Commission (FPPC), in the battle over Proposition
13 (Jarvis 1) only two corporations contributed
more than $2000 to support Proposition 13: Host
International, $5000; and Lassen Land Co.,
$2500.
But, according to the FPPC, more than sixty
companies contributed over $2000 to oppose
Proposition 13; Atlantic-Richfield. $25,000; Oc
cidental Petroleum. $12,500; Standard Oil of
California, $15,000; Rockwell International,
$10,000; Bank of America and Southern Califor
nia Edison, $25,000 each; Southern Pacific,
$20,000; Pacific Telephone and Ford Motor Co.,
$15,000 each; U.S. Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Gen
eral Telephone, and Kaiser Aluminum, $5000
each; PG&E, $12,500; etc.
Obviously, the economically powerful are no
friends of tax reduction.
The issue raised by Jarvis 11 is and must be one of
principles, the same principles raised by the anti
draft movement. The supporters of that movement
can demonstrate that they believe their own
rhetoric by actively supporting Jarvis 11.

During the past year-and-a-half on this campus,
many students of widely varying political view
points — liberals, libertarians, socialists, moder
ates. etc. — have argued and struggled against the
draft and registration for the draft.
We who have opposed the draft, whatever our
ideology, have employed several arguments in
common. We have denounced conscription as in
voluntary servitude, as slavery. We have often de
nied that our bodies and our lives belong to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, to the Pentagon, or to any
other political functionaries. We have claimed that
every human being has a right and a duty to make
his own moral choices and to determine his own
personal values.
