# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Richard Whitmore Hear both sides of fraternity issue 
### 
For lour years I have listened
to the pros and cons of Stanford's
fraternity system bantered about
by various antagonists, not the
least of which is the Daily. Now
two houses are on the verge of
being evicted; the coverage of
this problem and the attitude of
the administration have finally
forced me to end my silence.
Every spring quarter the Daily
becomes a continual forum on
the evils of fraternities. Occa
sionally a well-meaning reply
along the lines ol "How Much
My fraternity Means To Me"
survives the editor's pen. 1 can
not recall an article considering
both sides of the issue. Obviously
not all is right with the system,
but could all possibly be wrong?
Unfortunately, the members
of the community who learn
about campus affairs through the
Daily or through idle conversa
tion are led to believe that every
thing s wrong with the Greek
system. The Daily's editorial pol
icy manages to consistently de
ride the system.
For instance, during rush an
article appeared concerning the
/.ete's debt to the University.
Oddly enough, most people in
volved in the Row and the frater
nities knew about that problem
early in winter quarter. I can't
imagine that article contributing
much to the rush efforts.
In the recent article concern
ing Zetes and Delts, no opinions
from those involved on the
fraternity side appeared except a
non-supportive statement ot
questionable veracity from the
system president
Not only does the Daily
exaggerate the negative, it
also ignores the positive aspects
of the organizations, l.yst quar
ter, our group held a fundraising
breakfast which is enabling us to
take a group of children from the
waiting list of a "Big Brother"
program to Marriott's Great
America later this quarter. I per
sonally asked to have the event
promoted in a small article, or at
least in the "Briefly" section,
and was also told that a picture
would appear afterward. The
only thing 1 ever saw was the ad
vertisement for which we paid.

and which proved to be our only
expense for the event.
Given the negative image
propagated by the newspaper,
it's no wonder people around
campus expect very little of the
system or its individual mem
bers. But the people who are
most qualified to speak about the
problems, the "Irat men." are
not those who parade their views
in public. And it's difficult to be
honest about those problems
with administrators waiting for
"incidents" to jump upon. The
Pelt incident lias apparently in
stituted an inane policy of chas
tising fraternities for the actions
of friends. Who knows what will
happen it we begin to criticize
ourselves?
"Rowdy bunch of drunks" is
an often heard complaint. The
tales that come from dormitories
are as bad as anything I've ever
heard about fraternities. As far
as the abuses of rush are con
cerned, some big steps have been
taken this year to correct existing
problems. Within our own
fraternity, the question of peer
pressure and forced drinking just
are not big topics anymore. If
someone has an objection to any
activity, they have the option not
to participate.
"Elitist" is the next complaint.
No more elitist than any other
theme houses, 1 would argue.
Many of the nicest houses on
campus have become homes for
special interst groups.
The Italian House, American
Studies. Synergy and so on all
have a common bond among
their members. And the same
goes for fraternities; our bond
lies in an active social life. There
are those who would suggest that
a social life is not a goal of resi
dential education, but there is
much to be learned from meeting
with and talking to a lot of diffe
rent people. The fraternities af
ford us that opportunity.
Rush is a subjectively selective
process, the discontents claim.
Rush is where the problems lie in
the system. Hurt feelings and
crushed egos are no one's inten
tion. though. The problems are
in the inter-fraternity communi
cations. It's too bad that people

get rejected when there is room
in the system as a whole. If some
means of exposing people to
houses other than those on which
they immediately set their hearts
can he developed, maybe some
of these problems can be eradi
cated. The problem will only be
exacerbated by making the sys
tem smaller; less space means
more competition. Adminis
trators and the Inter-Fraternity
Council (IFC) should perhaps
look at this problem instead ot
random trashings. And speaking
of subjectively selective proces
ses, how many people get
"dinged" by Residential Educa
tion in House Associate (RA)
selections?
I suppose that all I am really
asking is that people who are not
completely informed give us a
chance. I am tired of meeting
people and having them turn off

when they hear I'm a Phi Delt,
because the stereotypes just
don't hold much water for those
who know the system well. 1
don't feel that many of the
stereotypes which have ap
peared in print apply to myself,
yet 1 survived rush and two years
in the house. The good points of
Phi Delts have tar outweighed
the bad, but you never see in the
paper that 1000 people had fun
at a fraternity party, or that ser
vice projects and community
service are done by trat men both
individually and in groups, or
that good and long-lasting
friendships have been made.
So next time you sec or hear
the word "fraternity," please
think twice.
