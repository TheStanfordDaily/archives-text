## Cubans support revolution 
### 
-About 50 hotel workers
gathered around in the lobby,
read the newspaper editorial,
burst into applause and cheered
"Fidel, Fidel!"
-30-40 women gathered on their
house steps, composing a tele
gram to Castro to state their sup
port.
-Hundreds oj spontaneous little
demonstrations, every dux,
everywhere.
That's what a group of Bay
area teachers and childcare
workers saw in Cuba last week.
They were impressed by the
energy and spirit with which so
many expressed their support for
the Cuban revolution.
According to Bill livers' col
umn in the Daily (May 16), the
Cuban revolution does not have
mass support. The people are
voting with their feet, he says.
That's true. Let's exaggerate a
little and say that 300.000 have
left Cuba. That means that 97
percent have voted with their
feet to stay and help build
socialism.
The Bay area visitors heard
constant cheers of "Que se
vayan!" (Let them go!) in Cuba.
The people there feci that

socialism is a voluntary process
and a lot of hard work. Those not
wanting to participate should
leave.
It is clear that the press here
has been a willing agent for the
U.S. government in its Cuban
coverage. It rarely mentions that
more than 200,000 Haitians
have fled their "free-enterprise"
country and have settled in
Cuba. When 12,000 1 laitians re
cently braved 800 miles of sea in
unchartered boats to reach the
United States and to escape the
deep poverty, the 90 percent il
literacy and 20 percent infant
mortality rates of Haiti, the
cameras did not roll and the
headlines did not herald this as a
failure of capitalism. The Hai
tians did not get job and housing
help as political refugees from
socialist countries do. They were
defined as merely economic re
fugees and were detained or sent
back.
The Cubans like the Haitians,
in fact, are leaving their country
for economic reasons. Author
Karen Wald, who visited the oc
cupied Peruvian embassy, de
scribed what she saw there: "The
people 1 spoke to . . . were well

led, well-dressed, well-educated
(by Latin American standards â€”
some by any standards). When
some complained of insufficient
food, clothing, etc. to meet their
desires, I asked them it they ex
pected to find those in Peru
. . . They looked at me scorn
fully. 'We don't want to go to
Peru,' they explained. 'We want
to go to the United States.' "
Hie U.S. media gloat over the
tact that Cuba is a poor country,
that its crops were devastated by
rot this year and that for the first
time there is unemployment.
They constantly remind us that
the United States is the richest
country in the !d. I hey don t
remind us. how r. that it is also
the largest in,, rialist power in
the world. Prom 1950-1963 for
an investment of SI 7.4 billion it
extracted an income of $29.4
billion from foreign investments.
By 1974 investments reached
SI 2(1 billion.
lor people from Third World
countries to come to the I Jilted
States and share in its imperialist
wealth is understandable but
ironic. I lie underdev elopment
ol the countries they are leaving
is largely a result of "invest
ment" by the dev eloped nations
to which they are escaping. The
documented impact of U.S. and
European investment on Third
World countries is two-fold: I)
Ihe poor in the under
developed nations become ab
solutely poorer, and relatively
poorer in oil-producing nations
and 2) the gap between the
under-developed and developed
nations becomes wider. That
makes sense. "Investment"
means extraction ol wealth, not
giv ing it.
To any thinking person,
though, comparing a Third-
World. under-developed, non
imperialist country with the Un
ited States makes no sense. The
meaningful comparison is with
Cuba before the rev olution, and
between Cuba and other Third
World countries which are not
organized along socialist lines.
In this comparison, revolutio
nary Cuba does very well. That is
why it has the respect of so many
Third World peoples, and that is
why it is such a threat to the U.S.
government.
