## Don't pass by pinpoints 
### 
The other evening I found myself staring at the
television set taking in one of those late-night
movie thrillers. In this third-rate classic, defense
counselor "Bogey" was pleading with a jury to
have compassion for a young man who had gone
astray. After a reflective pause, this philosopher
advocate addressed the jury: "In every man's life
there are pinpoints in time that determine his de
stiny."
Perhaps it was the aura of the late evening that got
me to thinking about the relevance of those words
to generations of young people plagued with the
decision of what to do with their lives. I thought
further, it's true there are such pinpoints in time
when a person must make a choice that will deter
mine the course of that individual's destiny. And at
that moment in time the die will be cast; the inane
or profound quality of one's lite hangs in the ba
lance of that decision.
As I pondered over this matter still further, it
became increasingly evident to me that the real
tragedy in most people's lives occurs at those pin
points in time when they neglect to choose the
manner of life that will command their respect and
thereby subject themselves to the mercy of an
otherwise absurd fate.
Somewhere in a big Eastern city. Carl, a friend of
mine, busily prepares a book of poems which he
one day hopes to have published and distributed
nationwide. Mis present job at a small bookstore
doesn't provide him with much extra spending
money, but for him it i,s more personally rewarding
than the management position he could have had in
his father's company.
Judy, a local lawyer with the public defender's
office, hardly laments the lifework of a housewife
that she turned down 10 years ago along with a
well-to-do husband who could have provided her
with a comfortable income^
Then there are Jean and Ray who conduct a
dance studio someplace in the Bay area. In 1971,
business prospects weren't all that promising and
after seven months, the two were tempted to reap
ply for their former jobs as a waitress and insurance
salesman respectively — but they stuck it out and
have lived to be happy!
Of course, there are many other names and
stories. But in the case of Carl. Judy, Jean and Ray,
each was confronted with a difficult decision and
each chose to be an active agent in determining the
destiny of his life. They did this despite persistent
families and peers who vehemently criticized their
choices and labeled them serious blunders.
At other times, the specter of financial insecurity
haunted every one of them almost to the point of
making each forfeit his life's aspiration. These were
real conflicts which no doubt must have caused
much mental confusion and personal anguish,
ic vc it he U. v . viiun tii, I : : ii.iii.t iniioiL came, a

reasoned choice rather than an indifferent conces
sion set the wheels of each of these lives in motion.
The significance of these examples to other
young adults inheres in the simple fact that happi
ness — whatever it may be taken to mean — is not
likely to be the end product of a life haphazardly
given over to the winds of chance.
fake a look at all the troubled faces which line
the corridors of any post-graduate professional
school and witness the plight of those who neither
cherish their new found escape from reality nor the
future that awaits them. Apparently, the continued
existence of such people is made possible by the
comforting but intoxicating fiction that all will
work out for the best; that in time the play of
natural forces will eventually render life rewarding.
Or witness further the quagmire of grave misgiv
ings that bewilder the nurse, the bricklayer, the
bank teller, the computer analyst, or the secretary
who one day just gave up and thereafter accepted
the first consoling prospect of security offered.
The problem encountered in all of these in
stances resides not in the particular occupation
accepted, but rather, in the forfeiture of the choice
neglected. To have blind faith in the future or to
wallow in the stream of life is tantamount to not
choosing. This malady is compounded by the fact
that it occurs at one of those pinpoints in time.
Perhaps the idealistic spirit of the '60s developed
too rapidly to leave a permanent imprint on those
who grew up in that era. Or then again, maybe the
goals aspired toward were far beyond the reach of
far too many. But as I observe the frantic pace at
which young people's futures are being determined
in the \XOs. I can't help hut think that whatever the
shortcomings of the spirit of the '60s, at least it was
a time when aspirations mattered and the character
of a person was inferred by the quality of the com
mitment made. And such commitments, made at
certain points in time, are the clay out of which the
manner of a man or woman is to be formed.
For those approaching that juncture in time
when destinies arc determined, it should be kept in
mind that their future is what they alone — and not
others — make it. No job they take will be likely to
be just a job and nothing more. Neither will the
habits that they form be easily altered. Nor will the
environment in which they take root be receptive
to immediate change.
A casual surrender at this point in time, however
inconsequential it may seem, may well set forces in
motion which could prove to be beyond the control
of the person affected. Life, unlike mere existence,
begins at those pinpoints in time when sober but
definite choices are made. Why should it begin
then? Well, as Rick affirms in the movie Casab
lanca, it's just "a good time to start."
