A long-term willingness by a
Stanford fraternity to participate
as volunteers in a needed com
munity project is noteworthy of
recognition.
For 10 years and again this
May the Zeta Psi fraternity
members have aided the Ar
thritis Foundation by supplying
manpower to load and unload
trucks of books for the yearly Ar
thritis Book Fair. Twenty
thousand dollars has been con
tributed to arthritis research pro
jects in the local area as a result
of the proceeds from the Book
Fair.
What is most creditable is that
these fraternity men have proven
that despite busy schedules, they
are never so busy that they can
not respond to this yearly call for
help and have given generously
of their time and aid to the com
munity.
As Stanford alumni, we com
mend them for their responsi
bleness.

Change draw
Now that the housing draw is
over, and each of us has taken
advantage of our golden oppor
tunity to be elated or disgusted, I
think it high time we re
evaluated our housing place
ment system. I realize that a ran
dom draw is the fairest way to
assign people to campus housing,
and if numbers were all that en
tered into the decision, I would
have no objections.
However, the issue here is not
so much the number we pick, but
all the other factors that affect
what power that number will
have. I refer to returning resi
dents' priority.
I can sympathize with the per
son who lives in 558 Mayfield
and dreads the idea of not being
able to return next year. How
ever, I have a little more sym
pathy for the person in Burbank
who wishes to sec what the other
side of campus looks like. Often,
their brightest prospect is mov
ing off campus.
Returning residents' priority
perpetuates a housing caste sys
tem. Right here in our little ha
ven, sheltered from the rest of
the world, we are perpetuating a
class of housing elite. Some
people, because of luck at the
draw before their sophomore

year, are fortunate enough to
live in their first choice assign
ment for two or sometimes three
years.
They get returning residents'
priority there, if guaranteed, and
even a high draw number
wouldn't prevent them from get
ting back in. On the other hand,
someone who draws 4<SOO will
get placed in Stern or Manzanita
Park and get priority there.
Wonderful! That is like having
connections at a community col
lege.
Unless that person draws ex
tremely well in subsequent years,
his chance of getting into Ins
third or fourth choice, let alone
first, are painfully slim. I think
everyone should get a chance to
live somewhere they want at
least once. Some people really
want to live in Mirrielees or
Manzanita, and for them, it is
fine, but the majority of people
do not. For that majority, this
system is unfair.
Those people, who have
drawn poorly and are unhappy
with their assignment, should be
admitted to top priority houses
before people who have already
had a chance to live there.
Our housing office advocates a
policy of "Residential Educa
tion." It would be far more edu
cational to live somewhere diffe
rent every year (I'd like to live
somewhere different every quar
ter) than to be in the same place
with many of the same people for
three years. How about a little
Liberal Arts in Stanford Hous
ing? How about a little "Affir
mative Action" in the draw? If
the Medical School can give ad
vantages to the under
privileged. why can't the Hous
ing Office?

Care about senate

the ASSU senate — well, you
don't care. After all, it hasn't
done anything for you recently.
Life at Stanford is great. You
don't even have to wash your li

ally start that many years ago?
You don't care. What has he
done recently?
You're not a politico. You
don't go to speeches. 11 time? or
uani/ations can't raise enough

money to bring speakers you
don't care about that's their
problem. Is there really a war in
Cambodia? You just couldn't
care less.
ou missed N o'clock class to
day. No problem. You've got
ASSU lecture notes. The senate
doesn't write those, and you
don't care who does.
You never weat T-shirts, you
don't go to rock concerts and you
don't drink at football games.
You buy your own beer, get your

do not. For that majority, this

Those people, who have
drawn poorly and are unhappy
with their assignment, should be
admitted to top priority houses
before people who have already
had a chance to live there.
Our housing office advocates a
policy of "Residential Educa
tion." It would be far more edu
cational to live somewhere diffe
rent every year (I'd like to live
somewhere different every quar
ter) than to be in the same place
with many of the same people for
three years. How about a little
Liberal Arts in Stanford Hous

Care about senate
Life at Stanford is great. And
the ASSU senate — well, you
don't care. After all, it hasn't
done anything for you recently.
Life at Stanford is great. You
don't even have to wash your li
nens. Did some poor senator re
ally start that many years ago?
You don't care. What has he
done recently?
You're not a politico. You
don't go to speeches. 11 time? or
uani/ations can't raise enough

money to bring speakers you
don't care about that's their
problem. Is there really a war in
Cambodia? You just couldn't
care less.
ou missed N o'clock class to
day. No problem. You've got
ASSU lecture notes. The senate
doesn't write those, and you
don't care who does.
You never weat T-shirts, you
don't go to rock concerts and you
don't drink at football games.
You buy your own beer, get your

Student show
After reading the Daily ar

(May 20) I was left with the im
pression that the reviewer and I
had attended two different con
certs. The concert I attended
displayed a wide array of student
musical talent.
Splendor on the Grass is a

recognition to the abundance of
student talent, focusing on Joe

the show. This in fact was not the

A long-term willingness by a
Stanford fraternity to participate
as volunteers in a needed com
munity project is noteworthy of
recognition.
For 10 years and again this
May the Zeta Psi fraternity
members have aided the Ar
thritis Foundation by supplying
manpower to load and unload
trucks of books for the yearly Ar
thritis Book Fair. Twenty
thousand dollars has been con
tributed to arthritis research pro
jects in the local area as a result
of the proceeds from the Book
Fair.
What is most creditable is that
these fraternity men have proven
that despite busy schedules, they
are never so busy that they can
not respond to this yearly call for
help and have given generously
of their time and aid to the com
munity.
As Stanford alumni, we com
mend them for their responsi

Change draw
Now that the housing draw is
over, and each of us has taken
advantage of our golden oppor
tunity to be elated or disgusted, I
think it high time we re
evaluated our housing place
ment system. I realize that a ran
dom draw is the fairest way to
assign people to campus housing,
and if numbers were all that en
tered into the decision, I would
have no objections.
However, the issue here is not
so much the number we pick, but
all the other factors that affect
what power that number will
have. I refer to returning resi
dents' priority.
I can sympathize with the per
son who lives in 558 Mayfield
and dreads the idea of not being
able to return next year. How
ever, I have a little more sym
pathy for the person in Burbank
who wishes to sec what the other
side of campus looks like. Often,
their brightest prospect is mov
ing off campus.
Returning residents' priority
perpetuates a housing caste sys
tem. Right here in our little ha
ven, sheltered from the rest of
the world, we are perpetuating a
class of housing elite. Some
people, because of luck at the
draw before their sophomore

year, are fortunate enough to
live in their first choice assign
ment for two or sometimes three
years.
They get returning residents'
priority there, if guaranteed, and
even a high draw number
wouldn't prevent them from get
ting back in. On the other hand,
someone who draws 4<SOO will
get placed in Stern or Manzanita
Park and get priority there.
Wonderful! That is like having
connections at a community col
lege.
Unless that person draws ex
tremely well in subsequent years,
his chance of getting into Ins
third or fourth choice, let alone
first, are painfully slim. I think
everyone should get a chance to
live somewhere they want at
least once. Some people really
want to live in Mirrielees or
Manzanita, and for them, it is
fine, but the majority of people
do not. For that majority, this
system is unfair.
