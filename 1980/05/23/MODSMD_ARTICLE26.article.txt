# Joggers finance Oval renovation
## 
### Jill Liscom Staff Writer 
Although there are plenty of
jogging enthusiasts, few are wil
ling to donate $ 150,000 to reno
vate an area where they like to
But fortunately tor Stanford, a
middle-aged couple "who enjoys
touring the campus early in the
morning" has decided to finance
repaving and replanting of the
Oval because they would like to
jog through there again, accord
ing to campus planner Max
Mazenko.
The Oval is the 196.000-
square foot area located at the

head of the Palm Drive entrance
to the University.
During the drought three
years ago, the University shut off
irrigation to the Oval to conserve
water. Consequently, all vegeta
tion there died, and"the area fell
into disrepair," said Mazenko.
When the couple approached
Stanford with the offer last tall,
they said they used to enjoy jog
ging through that area and
thought they would benefit both
themselves and the University by
funding renovation of the Oval,
Mazenko said.
The donors have specifically

requested to remain anonymous,
but Mazenko said they have "a
personal interest in the Univer
sity."
Because the couple's primary
request was for "a large green
area," the project has approp
riately been named "The Green
ing of the Oval," Mazenko said.
The area will be renovated ac
cording to the previous design,
with the addition of a central
flower bed, also at the couple's
request.
Mazenko explained that the
flowers will be maintained year
round in a permanent pattern.

although the color scheme will
change periodically. The first
pattern will be in red and white
petunias, which Mazenko said
"should be a spectacular display
of Stanford's colors."
In addition to the lawn
groundco\ er and the flower bed.
the Oval will be bordered on all
sides by low-growing shrubbery
and will have cement pathways
colored to match the nearby
sandstone buildings.
Construction began last
month and is expected to be
completed by June 13, in time
for commencement.

Once a thicket of brambles,the Oval in front of the Ouad is being spruced up. Shrubbery and
flowers will be planted and cement pathways laid. The cost — $150,000 — will be covered by
an anonymous couple who likes to jog through the area.
