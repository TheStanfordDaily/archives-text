# To pay corporate kidnap costs
## Lloyd's offers takeover insurance 
### Martin Baron The Los Angeles Times 
If a corporate executive is
seized by terrorists in San Sal
vador or Rome, there's a good
chance his company is insured
against the event through
Lloyd's of London. Tony Cas
sidy, a member underwriter in
the giant insurance syndicate,
developed Lloyd s policy against
kidnap and ransom.
So perhaps it is not surprising
to find Cassidy peddling a new
insurance line that protects com
panies against the expense of
hostile takeover attempts — a
sort of high-finance version of
kidnap and ransom.
The so-called "tender offer
defense expense insurance"
went on sale last week. It will pay
a companyls outside attorney's
fees, outside accounting fees, in
vestment bankers fees, payments
to public relations advisers and
the typical expenses of proxy sol
icitation. Currently, the
maximum payout is $1 million,
but the underwriter expects to
raise that soon to $4 million or
$5 million.
The policy w ill pay >S0 percent
of eligible costs up to the
maximum level, after $50,000
deductible. The premium would
be a minimum of $35,000 and
could run higher than $100,000,
depending on a company's risk
of being the target of a hostile
takeover attempt. Hut the insur
ance policy will pay nothing if
management is unsuccessful in
fending off the tender offer.

Although corporate mergers
and acquisitions recently have
dipped under the burden of high

interest rates, tender offers have
become increasingly popular
since the 19605. And with the
low value of the dollar and the
stock market, some observers
expect foreign corporations to
become increasingly interested
in purchasing U.S. firms.
"All of that — plus a convic
tion that the stock market is
headed lower and that execu
tives' anxiety over takeovers is
headed higher — tells Cassidv
that there's profit to be made
from this novel insurance policy.
"This is without a doubt a pro
duct with tremendous appeal
throughout a very wide section
of the business community."
Cassidy said.
Cons
But others doubt it. A promi
nent New York attorney, who
specialized in takeovers, said he
would advise clients against
using the policy because it would
appear that managers were
merely trying to protect their
jobs. "There could be serious
problems explaining this to
shareholders," he said.
"My initial reaction (to the
policy) is that it's bizarre," the
attorney said. "Insurance should
be against something fortuitous
normally a fortuitous calam
ity. rather than a fortuitous be
nefit."
Other independent observers,
however, are more charitable
toward the policy. "A more
thoughtful stockholder might
feel good about it." said Richard
Cheney, executive vice president
of Hill and Knowlton, a public
relations firm hired for many
takeover battles. "I don't like to
just automatically condemn all

managements and all boards just
because they don't take the first
offer that comes along and just
because it's at a premium."
100 clients foreseen
Cassidy estimates l.loyds will
enlist 100 firms by the end of the
year- And Lloyd's U.S. agent,
the NAS Insurance Services of
Santa Monica, is more optimis
tic. NAS Chairman Sydney
Aronson figures the number will
be more like 500.
Here's the reason they say the
policy will be so popular: When
MCA Inc. tried to take over
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los
Angeles, total expenses to fight
the takeover effort exceeded
$2.5 million. Gerber Corp., they
say, spent $500,000 to resist a
takeover attempt by Anderson
Clayton and Co. "You can spend
so much money in the defense
that you can impair earnings of a
company," Aronson said. As a
result, he contends, directors feel
pressured to accept an offer they
consider unsatisfactory.
The New York attorney, how
ever. said: "I haven't encoun
tered a situation where man

agement is rolling over because
of the expense."
There are significant expenses
not covered by the policy. F : or
example, a firm would not be
reimbursed for investment
banker fees involved in seeking
an alternative tender offer from
a "white knight." Lloyd's also
would not pay for opposition to a
tender offer that would not give
control to the suitor.
Premiums will be based on a
firm's likelihood of receiving a
tender offer and its ability to
fight it off. Premiums would be
higher for firms where only a
small proportion of the outstand
ing stock is owned by directors
and officers, where the treasury
is brimming with cash and where
dehts are low.
But some observers suggest
tbi.Lt Lloyd's new insurance pol
icy may fall victim to what ex
perts call "adverse selection."
As Alfred Hofflander, a UCLA
professor of finance and insur
ance, puts it:"The companies
that don't need it aren't going to
buy it. The companies that do
need it are going to buy it."

but the underwriter expects to
raise that soon to $4 million or
$5 million.
The policy w ill pay >S0 percent
of eligible costs up to the
maximum level, after $50,000
deductible. The premium would
be a minimum of $35,000 and
could run higher than $100,000,
depending on a company's risk
of being the target of a hostile
takeover attempt. Hut the insur
ance policy will pay nothing if
management is unsuccessful in
fending off the tender offer.

Although corporate mergers
and acquisitions recently have
dipped under the burden of high

interest rates, tender offers have
become increasingly popular
since the 19605. And with the
low value of the dollar and the
stock market, some observers
expect foreign corporations to
become increasingly interested
in purchasing U.S. firms.
"All of that — plus a convic
tion that the stock market is
headed lower and that execu
tives' anxiety over takeovers is
headed higher — tells Cassidv
that there's profit to be made
from this novel insurance policy.
"This is without a doubt a pro
duct with tremendous appeal
throughout a very wide section
of the business community."
Cassidy said.
Cons
But others doubt it. A promi
nent New York attorney, who
specialized in takeovers, said he
would advise clients against
using the policy because it would
appear that managers were
merely trying to protect their
jobs. "There could be serious
problems explaining this to
shareholders," he said.
"My initial reaction (to the
policy) is that it's bizarre," the
attorney said. "Insurance should
be against something fortuitous
normally a fortuitous calam
ity. rather than a fortuitous be
nefit."
Other independent observers,
however, are more charitable
toward the policy. "A more
thoughtful stockholder might
feel good about it." said Richard
Cheney, executive vice president
of Hill and Knowlton, a public
relations firm hired for many
takeover battles. "I don't like to
just automatically condemn all

managements and all boards just
because they don't take the first
offer that comes along and just
because it's at a premium."
100 clients foreseen
Cassidy estimates l.loyds will
enlist 100 firms by the end of the
year- And Lloyd's U.S. agent,
the NAS Insurance Services of
Santa Monica, is more optimis
tic. NAS Chairman Sydney
Aronson figures the number will
be more like 500.
Here's the reason they say the
policy will be so popular: When
MCA Inc. tried to take over
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Los
Angeles, total expenses to fight
the takeover effort exceeded
$2.5 million. Gerber Corp., they
say, spent $500,000 to resist a
takeover attempt by Anderson
Clayton and Co. "You can spend
so much money in the defense
that you can impair earnings of a
company," Aronson said. As a
result, he contends, directors feel
pressured to accept an offer they
consider unsatisfactory.
The New York attorney, how
ever. said: "I haven't encoun
tered a situation where man

agement is rolling over because
of the expense."
There are significant expenses
not covered by the policy. F : or
example, a firm would not be
reimbursed for investment
banker fees involved in seeking
an alternative tender offer from
a "white knight." Lloyd's also
would not pay for opposition to a
tender offer that would not give
control to the suitor.
Premiums will be based on a
firm's likelihood of receiving a
tender offer and its ability to
fight it off. Premiums would be
higher for firms where only a
small proportion of the outstand
ing stock is owned by directors
and officers, where the treasury
is brimming with cash and where
dehts are low.
But some observers suggest
tbi.Lt Lloyd's new insurance pol
icy may fall victim to what ex
perts call "adverse selection."
As Alfred Hofflander, a UCLA
professor of finance and insur
ance, puts it:"The companies
that don't need it aren't going to
buy it. The companies that do
need it are going to buy it."
If a corporate executive is
seized by terrorists in San Sal
vador or Rome, there's a good
chance his company is insured
against the event through
Lloyd's of London. Tony Cas
sidy, a member underwriter in
the giant insurance syndicate,
developed Lloyd s policy against
kidnap and ransom.
So perhaps it is not surprising
to find Cassidy peddling a new
insurance line that protects com
panies against the expense of
hostile takeover attempts — a
sort of high-finance version of
kidnap and ransom.
The so-called "tender offer
defense expense insurance"
went on sale last week. It will pay
a companyls outside attorney's
fees, outside accounting fees, in
vestment bankers fees, payments
to public relations advisers and
the typical expenses of proxy sol
icitation. Currently, the
maximum payout is $1 million,
but the underwriter expects to
raise that soon to $4 million or
$5 million.
