# BUG ME
## 
### 
What time did you wake up this morning? If you
live within amplifier distance of Alpha Sigma Phi, it
was probably earlier than you expected. I'll explain
now what all that commotion was about, for those
of you who were planning to write to Bug Me this
afternoon to complain.
This morning was the bane ot the greater C owell
cluster. Alpha Sig's annual Tequila Sunrise Party.
11 eld every spring quarter, this early morningevent
features breakfast and drinks for all who care to
trudge by. According to alumnus Frank Cowgill,
the morning music is usually halted by police re
sponding to complaints from local residents.
Cowgill said that this tradition was started a few
years ago by a few members of the trat who sur
prised the rest of the house, but that now the morn
ing wake-up is quietly publicized in advance.
Now on to more serious matters:
Dear Bug Me,
Two weeks ago someone wrote in and asked how
many trees it takes to produce one box of computer
paper. Well, recycling one ton of paper saves I 7
trees, so it seems that i) a box of computer paper
weighs 40 pounds, that's 0.02 tons or the equivalent
of 0.3 4 trees. Using the figures you gave of the paper
usage at the Computer Science Department and
LOTS, which is nearly SO,OOO pounds per year, that
comes to about 6SO trees.
And these two departments represent only a frac
tion of the computer paper used on campus; think of
CIT and SLAC!
But everyone can help to save trees by recycling.
The recycling center has green drums in both the
Computer Science Department and LOTS as well as
in every residence on campus. Recycling is working
-since the center opened in January 197S we have
recycled 647 tons of mixed paper and 35 tons of
computer paper. That's 11,592 trees!
Thanks,
L. Joyce, Stanford Recycling Center
Thank you for that information!
Dear Bug Me,
I've noticed a few weddings going on at Memorial
Church. Who gets married there? How much does it
cost to rent the church? Who gets the payment, the
church or the University? Are there lower rates for
alumni?
Genie
First of all, the church is only available for wed
dings to faculty, stalt, students or alumni ol Stan
ford, and to the direct children of any of the atore
mentioned people, according to Carol Burke,
wedding hostess for Memorial Church, and Wendy

Smith, associate Dean of the C hapel.
Burke and Smith said that there are about 150
weddings a year performed in the church, the
summer months being the busiest. I hey also said
that the majority of people being married there are
alumni, the average age ot the newlyweds-to-be
being in the late twenties.
The charge for weddings in Mem ( hu is $350
which goes to the church to cover the costs of the
chapel, the organist and the minister. There is no
discount for alums, but the charge is less for stu
dents. In all cases a letter of application is necessary
at least six weeks in advance of the desired date lor
the ceremony. It you want to be married during the
summer, you should probably make your plans
even farther in advance: as many as six weddings
are performed each Saturday, and the dates still I ill
up months in advance.
With very few exceptions, all weddings take
place on Saturdays and are performed either by
ministers of the Chapel or Priests trom the New
man Center.
This next question is probably from a person
who is thinking along the same lines as the above
question, but not quite so far along in the process:
Bug Me,
Just how many sorority girls are there at Stan
ford?
Curious in Manzanita
Nancy Hoffman, Inter-Sorority Council presi
dent, tells me that there are about 425 sorority
members on campus right now, and about 25 more
overseas. These numbers are not exact, Hoffman
said, because not all of the rosters of new pledges
have been turned in yet.
Joy Maclver, Inter-Sorority Council rush
chairperson, broke down that grand total into indi
vidual sororities for me. The Pi Phis, Thetas and
Kappas each have about 100 members, Maclvers
said. The Alpha Phi sorority has about 75 mem
bers. the Delta Gammas have between 50 and 60,
Alpha Chi Omega has about 30, and Alpha Omic
ron Pi about a dozen.
Maclver said that 1 26 women were offered bids
this year, and that although the final acceptances
aren't all in, she estimates that between 100 and
120 women joined a sorority here this year.
No more room here, and not many columns leit
in my columnar career; so get your questions in
NOW! Bug M e is still located in the Storke Publica
tions Building on the beautiful springtime Stanford
campus, area code 94305. And it's still written
by.. .

dings to faculty, stalt, students or alumni ol Stan
ford, and to the direct children of any of the atore
mentioned people, according to Carol Burke,
wedding hostess for Memorial Church, and Wendy

Smith, associate Dean of the C hapel.
Burke and Smith said that there are about 150
weddings a year performed in the church, the
summer months being the busiest. I hey also said
that the majority of people being married there are
alumni, the average age ot the newlyweds-to-be
being in the late twenties.
The charge for weddings in Mem ( hu is $350
which goes to the church to cover the costs of the
chapel, the organist and the minister. There is no
discount for alums, but the charge is less for stu
dents. In all cases a letter of application is necessary
at least six weeks in advance of the desired date lor
the ceremony. It you want to be married during the
summer, you should probably make your plans
even farther in advance: as many as six weddings
are performed each Saturday, and the dates still I ill
up months in advance.
With very few exceptions, all weddings take
place on Saturdays and are performed either by
ministers of the Chapel or Priests trom the New
man Center.
This next question is probably from a person
who is thinking along the same lines as the above
question, but not quite so far along in the process:
Bug Me,
Just how many sorority girls are there at Stan
ford?
Curious in Manzanita
Nancy Hoffman, Inter-Sorority Council presi
dent, tells me that there are about 425 sorority
members on campus right now, and about 25 more
overseas. These numbers are not exact, Hoffman
said, because not all of the rosters of new pledges
have been turned in yet.
Joy Maclver, Inter-Sorority Council rush
chairperson, broke down that grand total into indi
vidual sororities for me. The Pi Phis, Thetas and
Kappas each have about 100 members, Maclvers
said. The Alpha Phi sorority has about 75 mem
bers. the Delta Gammas have between 50 and 60,
Alpha Chi Omega has about 30, and Alpha Omic
ron Pi about a dozen.
Maclver said that 1 26 women were offered bids
this year, and that although the final acceptances
aren't all in, she estimates that between 100 and
120 women joined a sorority here this year.
No more room here, and not many columns leit
in my columnar career; so get your questions in
NOW! Bug M e is still located in the Storke Publica
tions Building on the beautiful springtime Stanford
campus, area code 94305. And it's still written

What time did you wake up this morning? If you
live within amplifier distance of Alpha Sigma Phi, it
was probably earlier than you expected. I'll explain
now what all that commotion was about, for those
of you who were planning to write to Bug Me this
afternoon to complain.
This morning was the bane ot the greater C owell
cluster. Alpha Sig's annual Tequila Sunrise Party.
11 eld every spring quarter, this early morningevent
features breakfast and drinks for all who care to
trudge by. According to alumnus Frank Cowgill,
the morning music is usually halted by police re
sponding to complaints from local residents.
Cowgill said that this tradition was started a few
years ago by a few members of the trat who sur
prised the rest of the house, but that now the morn
ing wake-up is quietly publicized in advance.
Now on to more serious matters:
Dear Bug Me,
Two weeks ago someone wrote in and asked how
many trees it takes to produce one box of computer
paper. Well, recycling one ton of paper saves I 7
trees, so it seems that i) a box of computer paper
weighs 40 pounds, that's 0.02 tons or the equivalent
of 0.3 4 trees. Using the figures you gave of the paper
usage at the Computer Science Department and
LOTS, which is nearly SO,OOO pounds per year, that
comes to about 6SO trees.
And these two departments represent only a frac
tion of the computer paper used on campus; think of
CIT and SLAC!
But everyone can help to save trees by recycling.
The recycling center has green drums in both the
Computer Science Department and LOTS as well as
in every residence on campus. Recycling is working
-since the center opened in January 197S we have
recycled 647 tons of mixed paper and 35 tons of
computer paper. That's 11,592 trees!
Thanks,
L. Joyce, Stanford Recycling Center
Thank you for that information!
Dear Bug Me,
I've noticed a few weddings going on at Memorial
Church. Who gets married there? How much does it
cost to rent the church? Who gets the payment, the
church or the University? Are there lower rates for
alumni?
