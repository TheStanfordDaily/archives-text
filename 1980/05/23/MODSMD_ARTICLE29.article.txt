In honor of Memorial Day,
this will not he a column to re
member. And if that makes
sense to you, you might deiive
some benefit from the following
discussion ot healthful minutiae.
* * *
Please explain about age spots.
At what age do they usually oc
cur? What causes tliein? Should I
hew orried? I am 21 and have age
spots on my hands.
- Prematurely Mature
The pigmentation aberrations
you think are blemishing your
hands are medically known as
senile lentigines and more com
monly and incorrectly called
liver spots. According to Dr.
John Dorman at Cowell. they
appear on fair-skinned people
who have been exposed to the
sun for long periods of time.
| Since you didn't send me your
picture or resume, I don't know
if that description applies to you
or not. At any rate, the discolora
tion is just a fact of aging. Dor
man said. He suggested that you
see a dermatologist if the condi
tion is really bothering you.
Now I have a follow-up ques
tion from last week's column.
* * *
Does heavy drug use contri
bute to the loss of hair and early
baldness?
-Smooth Pate
"Not to my knowledge," said
Dorman. The best way to deter
mine male baldness is to look at
the mother's father, he said. Pat
terned baldness is a sexually re
lated hereditary characteristic,
transmitted by the X chromo

some (from the mother), he
explained.
If the relationship doesn't tit
say. for example, you're halt! -
nig. but your maternal grand
father has a full head o! thick,
whitcliair — it's worth checking
with a doctor or dermatologist
about your shedding. Or perhaps
your grandfather underwent an
extensive hair transplant.
This next item is plunging to
mundane depths, but, as all
journalists know, the more
common a story, the more wide
spread its appeal. After all.
everyone ki.ovss that national
news reporters aie instructed to
write at the fifth-grade lex el.
* * *
Please settle once and for all:
Do you starve a cold and feed a
fever, or feed a cold and starve a
fever?
- Hot and Hungry
Dorman pleaded ignorance to
the origin of this adage, but said
that either way, it's not necessar
ily true. Basically, if you feel
hungry, you should eat. and if
you're not hungry, don't eat. he
said. In either case, you should
take in plenty of liquids.
Whether you suffer from a cold,
a fe\ er or both, dehydration is a
complicating factor and should
be avoided.
1 must admit, however, that
I've always adhered to the "feed
a fever" line, probably because
I'm attached to alliteration.
The final question for today is
a rather curious one. and I'm sol
iciting your aid in answering it.
* * *
This might sound odd, hut is

there a common element yi un
sweetened wheat germ, alfalfa
sprouts and human sperm? All
three make the back of my throat
hurt. ,
-Uorged
You're right. Not only does
your question sound odd. it is
odd . . . and it's also a little ris
que. in case you hadn't noticed. 1
spent a few minutes trying to
analyze the handwriting on this
question, but 1 failed miserably
in my attempts to discern its au
thor's sex. Not that that should
matter, of course.
You. Gorged, should give
yourself a pat on the back for
stumping some of the brilliant
minds at Stanford. No one could
give me a definitive answer to the
question.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea of
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) notices that all
three of your substances are high
in protein. He recommended
that you drink a lot of water.
That's a possible connection, but
it proves nothing.
Dorman said that the only cor
relation he could think of might
be the irritation associated with
the mechanical activity in each
case.
No one to whom 1 spoke in the
Chemistry Dept. or in various
departments at the Medical
Center could ev en hazard a guess
as to the link between your three
throat abrasives. So. I'm opening
the question up to general com
ment or speculation. Don't be
timid out there.

matter, of course.
You. Gorged, should give
yourself a pat on the back for
stumping some of the brilliant
minds at Stanford. No one could
give me a definitive answer to the
question.
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea of
Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS) notices that all
three of your substances are high
in protein. He recommended
that you drink a lot of water.
That's a possible connection, but
it proves nothing.
Dorman said that the only cor
relation he could think of might
be the irritation associated with
the mechanical activity in each
case.
No one to whom 1 spoke in the
Chemistry Dept. or in various
departments at the Medical
Center could ev en hazard a guess
as to the link between your three
throat abrasives. So. I'm opening
the question up to general com
ment or speculation. Don't be
timid out there.

In honor of Memorial Day,
this will not he a column to re
member. And if that makes
sense to you, you might deiive
some benefit from the following
discussion ot healthful minutiae.
* * *
Please explain about age spots.
At what age do they usually oc
cur? What causes tliein? Should I
hew orried? I am 21 and have age
spots on my hands.
- Prematurely Mature
The pigmentation aberrations
you think are blemishing your
hands are medically known as
senile lentigines and more com
monly and incorrectly called
liver spots. According to Dr.
John Dorman at Cowell. they
appear on fair-skinned people
who have been exposed to the
sun for long periods of time.
| Since you didn't send me your
picture or resume, I don't know
if that description applies to you
or not. At any rate, the discolora
tion is just a fact of aging. Dor
man said. He suggested that you
see a dermatologist if the condi
tion is really bothering you.
Now I have a follow-up ques
tion from last week's column.
* * *
Does heavy drug use contri
bute to the loss of hair and early
baldness?
-Smooth Pate
"Not to my knowledge," said
Dorman. The best way to deter
mine male baldness is to look at
the mother's father, he said. Pat
terned baldness is a sexually re
lated hereditary characteristic,
transmitted by the X chromo

some (from the mother), he
explained.
If the relationship doesn't tit
say. for example, you're halt! -
nig. but your maternal grand
father has a full head o! thick,
whitcliair — it's worth checking
with a doctor or dermatologist
about your shedding. Or perhaps
your grandfather underwent an
extensive hair transplant.
This next item is plunging to
mundane depths, but, as all
journalists know, the more
common a story, the more wide
spread its appeal. After all.
everyone ki.ovss that national
news reporters aie instructed to
write at the fifth-grade lex el.
* * *
Please settle once and for all:
Do you starve a cold and feed a
fever, or feed a cold and starve a
fever?
- Hot and Hungry
Dorman pleaded ignorance to
the origin of this adage, but said
that either way, it's not necessar
ily true. Basically, if you feel
hungry, you should eat. and if
you're not hungry, don't eat. he
said. In either case, you should
take in plenty of liquids.
Whether you suffer from a cold,
a fe\ er or both, dehydration is a
complicating factor and should
be avoided.
1 must admit, however, that
I've always adhered to the "feed
a fever" line, probably because
I'm attached to alliteration.
The final question for today is
a rather curious one. and I'm sol
iciting your aid in answering it.
* * *
This might sound odd, hut is

there a common element yi un
sweetened wheat germ, alfalfa
sprouts and human sperm? All
three make the back of my throat
hurt. ,
-Uorged
You're right. Not only does
your question sound odd. it is
odd . . . and it's also a little ris
que. in case you hadn't noticed. 1
spent a few minutes trying to
analyze the handwriting on this
question, but 1 failed miserably
in my attempts to discern its au
thor's sex. Not that that should
matter, of course.
