The Associated Press
The federal government declared
riot-wracked Miami a disaster area yes
terday. making it eligible for special
recovery assistance. Two thousand
weary National Guardsmen were sent
home, and schools reopened peacefully
with some classrooms half empty.
The disaster designated by the Small
Business Administration means that
owners of damaged businesses, homes
and personal property throughout
Dade County can get low-interest
loans to help rebuild from the fires and
lootings that erupted Saturday in a
black neighborhood of northwest
Miami.
Some 104 businesses sustained a
total of $100.5 million damage during
the two days and two nights when vio
lence was at its height, the SBA esti
mated in Washington. In addition. 54
homes sustained a total of $290,000
damage, while 75 organizations such as
churches and charitable groups were
hit with $150,000 damage, the SBA
said.
County officials estimated the finan
cial toll overall at $200 million, includ
ing factors such as lost salaries and tax
revenue and a potential drop in
â– 

tourism.
Meanwhile, one of the white ex-
Dade County policemen acquitted of
charges in connection with the death ol
black motorcyclist Arthur McDuffie
was rushed to a hospital last night after
an apparent suicide attempt, police
said.
Michael Watts, 30, was listed in criti
cal condition in the intensive care unit
of Baptist Hospital suffering from car
bon monoxide poisoning, hospital
spokesman Robert Groover said.
Dade County police spokesman Jim
Baab said Watts' motorcycle, which he
kept in his apartment, was running and
carbon monoxide was entering his bed
room.
Baab said Watts apparently had
talked to an unidentified friend earlier
by telephone and said he was con
templating suicide not because of the
McDuffie case but because of a split
with his girlfrie.od.
Schools open
Schools reopened with beefed up
security in racially troubled areas. Joe
Fernandez, Dade County assistant
school superintendent, said there was
"not one incident." Attendance ranged
from 49 percent to 98 percent, he said.

As calm was reported for the third
day. Gov. Bob Graham arrived in the
city to tour black neighborhoods torn
by burning, looting and mayhem that
claimed 15 lives. He also planned to
meet with community leaders to dis
cuss rebuilding efforts. Graham said he
opposed amnesty for the 1267 persons
arrested.
In the first night after a curfew was
lifted over a 52-square mile area, only
one incident was reported.
Chase
Two Dade County officers were
fired upon in their patrol car about
3:25 a.m. yesterday in the northwest
section, triggering a 10-block high
speed chase for the gunman. Au
thorities arrested a 2 1 -year-old man on
charges of attempted murder and ag
gravated assault, said police spokes
man Tom Banks.
No one was injured, even though the
gunman had fired at a black bystander
during the chase. Banks said.
In another incident, four officers
were suspended with pay during an in
vestigation of charges that police had
smashed windows and spray-painted
the words "looter" and "thief' on cars
at a shopping center.

Another policeman was suspended,
also with pay, during a probe of an
alleged bludgeoning of a suspected
woman looter during the riot. Both the
policeman and the woman arc black.
Shooting
On Wednesday night a white police
officer was shot by a sniper as he set up
a barricade in a black neighborhood,
authorities said.
Officer R.U. Cooke. 28, was hit in
the face by a single shot as he stepped
out of his cruiser to set up the
roadblock near a housing development
on Tampa's east side, police said.
The National Guard cutback left
1000 troops still on standby duty in
warehouses and armories only minutes
away from the Liberty City neighbor
hood where the violence erupted
Saturday. The rioting was ignited when
an all-white Tampa jury acquitted four
white former policemen in the death in
Miami of a black man, Arthur McDuf
fie.
At the height of the crisis, 3800
guardsmen had manned blockades and
patrolled streets.
Many of the troops sent here had
worked in Key West on the Cuban re
fugee boatlift in recent weeks. Then
they were called to annual training.
Then they were sent to Miami. "I'm
sure they are happy to go home," said
Maj. lien Adams.
Officials identified 27 schools that
were the most likely targets of trouble
and authorized their principals to hire
additional hallway and bus monitors.
