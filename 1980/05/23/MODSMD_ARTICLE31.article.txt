NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y.—
Tim and Donna Earp have had a
lot of sickness in their family
since they moved into the Love
Canal neighborhood six years
ago.
Now, all they want to do is get
out of their home and leave the
neighborhood, contaminated
with chemicals from the old Love
Canal chemical dump. But they
say they have to remain until the
government provides the prom
ised funds for their temporary re
location.
The federal government de
clared a state of emergency in the
neighborhood Wednesday, pav
ing the way for it to provide funds
for the Earps and their neighbors
to i.ove into motels. Later, the
residents will be able to move

into temporary quarters ar
ranged by the government.
"We want to go," said Mrs.
Earp, 35, "and the government
says we can move into a motel
and they'll reimburse us lor it la
ter. But we can't afford to pay it
and then wait to be reimbursed."
About 21,000 tons of various
hazardous chemicals were
buried in the Love Canal area b\
Hooker Chemical Co. 30 years
ago. The ground, outside the city
limits at that point, was privately
owned, and Hooker purchased it
with a view toward using it for
the disposal of chemical wastes,
according to company officials in
Houston.
New Vork state apparently did
not have in force any stringent
regulations on the licensing of
privately owned chemical dumps
when Hooker's operation began.
