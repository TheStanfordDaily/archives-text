# The 						Friday Interview
## Andy Geiger discusses the NCAA dilemma 
### 
(Editor's note: Last November
15, eight Arizona State football
players were declared ineligible
because they received false credit
from a dubious community col
lege extention program in South
ern California. That was the first
in a long string of declared viola
tions o) NCAA rules which have
emanated from college and uni
versity athletic departments
throughout the winter. The viola
tions are a disgrace, there's no
doubt there, but more impor
tantly they finally have brought
into focus the whole question oj
what must be done lo save the
student-athlete from the
malstrom of NC AA division I
athletics. In this Friday Interview
with Sally Jenkins, Stanford ath
letic director Andy Geiger, ad
dresses the problem and how it
affects athletics on the l arm.)
Jenkins: Have the recent scandels
and investigations into recruiting
and NCAA violations causal you

to look into Stan ford's
scholastic-athletic relations '
Geiger: Yes. We went through
all the records tit our people 111 all
varsity sports to see if any similar
problems existed.
Jenkins: A couple of weeks
aqo Andre limes suitl that Stan
ford and Rrigham Young are the
only places where athletes really
go to school. Ciranted that that's
an exaggeration, what is your
reaction to a statement like that'.'
Geiger: That's awfully hard to
answer because I'm not every
place else. I'm here. I think our
people are v cry much involved in
student life: at other places. I
don't know. Some tilings I have
seen and heard about indicate
the same situation. You have to
he awfully careful not to paint
everybody with the same brush.
USC may have some unqualified
student-athletes, but tliev have
also had sonic line athletes who
were Rhodes Scholars. You can't

indict one school or system univ -
ersally.
Jenkins: What kind oj measures
do you or have you taken to in
sure that nothing of the kind ever
happens here at Stanford?
Geiger: We have regular rules*
review sessions and we are con
tinually double checking our
own knowledge of the rules as
they exist. Part of the employ
ment contingency is that the
people we hire have to adhere to
the rules. There is also a clear
distinction between the athletic
stall and the dean of admis
sions. That's not to say that we
don't work with him and make
recommendations, but academic
rev iew is outside of the Athletic
Department.
We also do our best to use the
u niv ersity counseling system, not
our own. We strive to make sure
that the athletes are students
first; there is no subculture
where the athletes are separated

from the rest of the community,
with separate places to eat and
live. We are'nt going to get away
from recognition of the athletic
community, but we can strive to
give them a full student perspec
tive.
Jenkins: How about the idea that
athletes deserve a little more be
cause they work harder than the
average student in college'.'
Geiger: I don't think I
wholeheartedly concurwith that.
Sometimes we have live year
people because til the eligibility
and red-shirt possibility. But I
don't think that we can exempt
athletes from the rigors tit
academic life, because they are
not always going to be athletes
and they should be prepared for
that.
We should not get into a situa
tion where a Stanford degree has
an asterisk on it because the stu
dent was an athlete. That doesn't
mean there is a lack of recogni

tion of the strain and stress
placed on an athlete, it takes
careful planning, but students
are,-gotid at it. 'The community
recognizes it.and there is infor
mal consideration given. How
many times have you gotten be
hind in a class and somebody
gave you a break?
Jenkins: Have you ever had to
deal with NCAA violations be
fore in any of the athletic depart
ments you have worked in?
Geiger: Yes. little ones. And
there have been little ones here.
Tliev are not always made pub
lic. '
If the infraction is minor or
technical you get a private letter.
No director could ever sav that
their program is in total accord
with the rules, because it's a v cry
complex system. Anybody acting
for the department becomes a
surrogate and might inadver
tantly do something that is
against the rules. You then be
come "part of the athletic in
terests of the University" —
that's what the book calls it. You
may not have bad intentions, and
Stanford is not exempt from this,
but you try as hard as you can to
act in the correct way.
Jenkins: Do yon think the NCAA
regulations are fair?
Geiger: Basically they are fair.

The transcript scandal is aimed
at the "normal progress" rule.
The rule requires that the stu
dent be in a certain range of his
or her class and in a normal
course towards graduation.
That's the rule that everyone is
getting caught on. The rules are
perhaps too numerous in that the
basic rule ought to be one of local
responsibility. It's up to each of
us to administer and determine
right and wrong.
The NCAA has developed a

large enforcement department
and they keep adding more and
more people to it. Pretty soon,
instead of an issue of right and
wrong it becomes a cops and
robbers kind of thing where
people just want to avoid getting
caught. There is going to have to
be more self discipline in an
across-the-country phenome
non. My interest is in correction
of the problem rather than in
punishment and enforcement.
Jenkins: Do you think this kind

of thing (transcript violations) re
ally does that much harm to the
student? An argument can he
made that even if an athlete is not
a qualified student, at least he is
getting a degree.
Geiger: A lot of people don't got
the degree. Again, there are dif
ferent kinds of colleges. At Stan
ford if there is a sub-society there
are going to he peer pressures
and other unpleasant things.
Your people ought to belong to
the community in every sense of
the word. Otherwise it's just

exploitation — using the body
for gain. The kids have to be rep
resentative of the student body.
You can't set up a whole reme
dial department to bring them up
to the level of the other students.
It's been tried at other places and
it just flat out doesn't work.
Jenkins: What causes a university
to ignore those kind of practices
(transcript violations)?
Geiger: I think there is definitely
the ostrich point of view — the
head in the sand kind of thing,
that kind of ignorance. Or just

acceptance of what's going on
it might be the university's ap
proach or policy, pay for pay. I
don't know what to do about it.
Jenkins: At Arizona State, the
alumni association had a lot to do
with the controversy surrounding
the behavior of former head loot
hall coach Frank Kush. Have you
ever encountered that kind of at
titude in any of the Stanford
Alumni?
Geiger: No. not at all. Stanford
alumni would be tar more out
raged at the kind of practices

ASL was involved in than it we
had a winless season or failed to
measure up to their idea of a suc
cessful season. I think they are
very proud of what we ac
complish in the way that we ac
complish it. Also, fund raising
for athletic scholarships is all
done with full control and is part
of the University: it's not inde
pendent \li dI the money is in
University accounts and handled
hv the I mversitv according to the
investiiu >11 guidelines of the
hoard of trustees.

student-athlete from the
malstrom of NC AA division I
athletics. In this Friday Interview
with Sally Jenkins, Stanford ath
letic director Andy Geiger, ad
dresses the problem and how it
affects athletics on the l arm.)
Jenkins: Have the recent scandels
and investigations into recruiting
and NCAA violations causal you

to look into Stan ford's
scholastic-athletic relations '
Geiger: Yes. We went through
all the records tit our people 111 all
varsity sports to see if any similar
problems existed.
Jenkins: A couple of weeks
aqo Andre limes suitl that Stan
ford and Rrigham Young are the
only places where athletes really
go to school. Ciranted that that's
an exaggeration, what is your
reaction to a statement like that'.'
Geiger: That's awfully hard to
answer because I'm not every
place else. I'm here. I think our
people are v cry much involved in
student life: at other places. I
don't know. Some tilings I have
seen and heard about indicate
the same situation. You have to
he awfully careful not to paint
everybody with the same brush.
USC may have some unqualified
student-athletes, but tliev have
also had sonic line athletes who
were Rhodes Scholars. You can't

indict one school or system univ -
ersally.
Jenkins: What kind oj measures
do you or have you taken to in
sure that nothing of the kind ever
happens here at Stanford?
Geiger: We have regular rules*
review sessions and we are con
tinually double checking our
own knowledge of the rules as
they exist. Part of the employ
ment contingency is that the
people we hire have to adhere to
the rules. There is also a clear
distinction between the athletic
stall and the dean of admis
sions. That's not to say that we
don't work with him and make
recommendations, but academic
rev iew is outside of the Athletic
Department.
We also do our best to use the
u niv ersity counseling system, not
our own. We strive to make sure
that the athletes are students
first; there is no subculture
where the athletes are separated

from the rest of the community,
with separate places to eat and
live. We are'nt going to get away
from recognition of the athletic
community, but we can strive to
give them a full student perspec
tive.
Jenkins: How about the idea that
athletes deserve a little more be
cause they work harder than the
average student in college'.'
Geiger: I don't think I
wholeheartedly concurwith that.
Sometimes we have live year
people because til the eligibility
and red-shirt possibility. But I
don't think that we can exempt
athletes from the rigors tit
academic life, because they are
not always going to be athletes
and they should be prepared for
that.
We should not get into a situa
tion where a Stanford degree has
an asterisk on it because the stu
dent was an athlete. That doesn't
mean there is a lack of recogni

tion of the strain and stress
placed on an athlete, it takes
careful planning, but students
are,-gotid at it. 'The community
recognizes it.and there is infor
mal consideration given. How
many times have you gotten be
hind in a class and somebody
gave you a break?
Jenkins: Have you ever had to
deal with NCAA violations be
fore in any of the athletic depart
ments you have worked in?
Geiger: Yes. little ones. And
there have been little ones here.
Tliev are not always made pub
lic. '
If the infraction is minor or
technical you get a private letter.
No director could ever sav that
their program is in total accord
with the rules, because it's a v cry
complex system. Anybody acting
for the department becomes a
surrogate and might inadver
tantly do something that is
against the rules. You then be
come "part of the athletic in
terests of the University" —
that's what the book calls it. You
may not have bad intentions, and
Stanford is not exempt from this,
but you try as hard as you can to
act in the correct way.
Jenkins: Do yon think the NCAA
regulations are fair?
Geiger: Basically they are fair.

The transcript scandal is aimed
at the "normal progress" rule.
The rule requires that the stu
dent be in a certain range of his
or her class and in a normal
course towards graduation.
That's the rule that everyone is
getting caught on. The rules are
perhaps too numerous in that the
basic rule ought to be one of local
responsibility. It's up to each of
us to administer and determine
right and wrong.
The NCAA has developed a

large enforcement department
and they keep adding more and
more people to it. Pretty soon,
instead of an issue of right and
wrong it becomes a cops and
robbers kind of thing where
people just want to avoid getting
caught. There is going to have to
be more self discipline in an
across-the-country phenome
non. My interest is in correction
of the problem rather than in
punishment and enforcement.
Jenkins: Do you think this kind

of thing (transcript violations) re
ally does that much harm to the
student? An argument can he
made that even if an athlete is not
a qualified student, at least he is
getting a degree.
Geiger: A lot of people don't got
the degree. Again, there are dif
ferent kinds of colleges. At Stan
ford if there is a sub-society there
are going to he peer pressures
and other unpleasant things.
Your people ought to belong to
the community in every sense of
the word. Otherwise it's just

exploitation — using the body
for gain. The kids have to be rep
resentative of the student body.
You can't set up a whole reme
dial department to bring them up
to the level of the other students.
It's been tried at other places and
it just flat out doesn't work.
Jenkins: What causes a university
to ignore those kind of practices
(transcript violations)?
Geiger: I think there is definitely
the ostrich point of view — the
head in the sand kind of thing,
that kind of ignorance. Or just

acceptance of what's going on
it might be the university's ap
proach or policy, pay for pay. I
don't know what to do about it.
Jenkins: At Arizona State, the
alumni association had a lot to do
with the controversy surrounding
the behavior of former head loot
hall coach Frank Kush. Have you
ever encountered that kind of at
titude in any of the Stanford
Alumni?
Geiger: No. not at all. Stanford
alumni would be tar more out
raged at the kind of practices

ASL was involved in than it we
had a winless season or failed to
measure up to their idea of a suc
cessful season. I think they are
very proud of what we ac
complish in the way that we ac
complish it. Also, fund raising
for athletic scholarships is all
done with full control and is part
of the University: it's not inde
pendent \li dI the money is in
University accounts and handled
hv the I mversitv according to the
investiiu >11 guidelines of the
hoard of trustees.
(Editor's note: Last November
15, eight Arizona State football
players were declared ineligible
because they received false credit
from a dubious community col
lege extention program in South
ern California. That was the first
in a long string of declared viola
tions o) NCAA rules which have
emanated from college and uni

aqo Andre limes suitl that Stan
ford and Rrigham Young are the
only places where athletes really
go to school. Ciranted that that's
an exaggeration, what is your
reaction to a statement like that'.'
Geiger: That's awfully hard to
answer because I'm not every
place else. I'm here. I think our
people are v cry much involved in
student life: at other places. I
don't know. Some tilings I have
seen and heard about indicate
the same situation. You have to
he awfully careful not to paint
everybody with the same brush.
USC may have some unqualified
student-athletes, but tliev have
also had sonic line athletes who
were Rhodes Scholars. You can't

indict one school or system univ -
ersally.
Jenkins: What kind oj measures
do you or have you taken to in
sure that nothing of the kind ever
happens here at Stanford?
Geiger: We have regular rules*
review sessions and we are con
tinually double checking our
own knowledge of the rules as
they exist. Part of the employ
ment contingency is that the
people we hire have to adhere to
the rules. There is also a clear
distinction between the athletic
stall and the dean of admis
sions. That's not to say that we
don't work with him and make
recommendations, but academic
rev iew is outside of the Athletic
Department.
We also do our best to use the
u niv ersity counseling system, not
our own. We strive to make sure
that the athletes are students
first; there is no subculture
where the athletes are separated

from the rest of the community,
with separate places to eat and
live. We are'nt going to get away
from recognition of the athletic
community, but we can strive to
give them a full student perspec
tive.
Jenkins: How about the idea that
athletes deserve a little more be
cause they work harder than the
average student in college'.'
Geiger: I don't think I
wholeheartedly concurwith that.
Sometimes we have live year
people because til the eligibility
and red-shirt possibility. But I
don't think that we can exempt
athletes from the rigors tit
academic life, because they are
not always going to be athletes
and they should be prepared for
that.
We should not get into a situa
tion where a Stanford degree has
an asterisk on it because the stu
dent was an athlete. That doesn't
mean there is a lack of recogni

tion of the strain and stress
placed on an athlete, it takes
careful planning, but students
are,-gotid at it. 'The community
recognizes it.and there is infor
mal consideration given. How
many times have you gotten be
hind in a class and somebody
gave you a break?
Jenkins: Have you ever had to
deal with NCAA violations be
fore in any of the athletic depart
ments you have worked in?
Geiger: Yes. little ones. And
there have been little ones here.
Tliev are not always made pub
lic. '
If the infraction is minor or
technical you get a private letter.
No director could ever sav that
their program is in total accord
with the rules, because it's a v cry
complex system. Anybody acting
for the department becomes a
surrogate and might inadver
tantly do something that is
against the rules. You then be
come "part of the athletic in
terests of the University" —
that's what the book calls it. You
may not have bad intentions, and
Stanford is not exempt from this,
but you try as hard as you can to
act in the correct way.
Jenkins: Do yon think the NCAA
regulations are fair?
Geiger: Basically they are fair.

The transcript scandal is aimed
at the "normal progress" rule.
The rule requires that the stu
dent be in a certain range of his
or her class and in a normal
course towards graduation.
That's the rule that everyone is
getting caught on. The rules are
perhaps too numerous in that the
basic rule ought to be one of local
responsibility. It's up to each of
us to administer and determine
right and wrong.
The NCAA has developed a

large enforcement department
and they keep adding more and
more people to it. Pretty soon,
instead of an issue of right and
wrong it becomes a cops and
robbers kind of thing where
people just want to avoid getting
caught. There is going to have to
be more self discipline in an
across-the-country phenome
non. My interest is in correction
of the problem rather than in
punishment and enforcement.
Jenkins: Do you think this kind

of thing (transcript violations) re
ally does that much harm to the
student? An argument can he
made that even if an athlete is not
a qualified student, at least he is
getting a degree.
Geiger: A lot of people don't got
the degree. Again, there are dif
ferent kinds of colleges. At Stan
ford if there is a sub-society there
are going to he peer pressures
and other unpleasant things.
Your people ought to belong to
the community in every sense of
the word. Otherwise it's just

exploitation — using the body
for gain. The kids have to be rep
resentative of the student body.
You can't set up a whole reme
dial department to bring them up
to the level of the other students.
It's been tried at other places and
it just flat out doesn't work.
Jenkins: What causes a university
to ignore those kind of practices
(transcript violations)?
Geiger: I think there is definitely
the ostrich point of view — the
head in the sand kind of thing,
that kind of ignorance. Or just

acceptance of what's going on
it might be the university's ap
proach or policy, pay for pay. I
don't know what to do about it.
Jenkins: At Arizona State, the
alumni association had a lot to do
with the controversy surrounding
the behavior of former head loot
hall coach Frank Kush. Have you
ever encountered that kind of at
titude in any of the Stanford
Alumni?
Geiger: No. not at all. Stanford
alumni would be tar more out
raged at the kind of practices

ASL was involved in than it we
had a winless season or failed to
measure up to their idea of a suc
cessful season. I think they are
very proud of what we ac
complish in the way that we ac
complish it. Also, fund raising
for athletic scholarships is all
done with full control and is part
of the University: it's not inde
pendent \li dI the money is in
University accounts and handled
hv the I mversitv according to the
investiiu >11 guidelines of the
hoard of trustees.
