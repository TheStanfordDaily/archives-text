# The
						Friday Interview
## Andy Geiger discusses the NCAA dilemma 
### 
(Editor's note: Last November
15, eight Arizona State football
players were declared ineligible
because they received false credit
from a dubious community col
lege extention program in South
ern California. That was the first
in a long string of declared viola
tions o) NCAA rules which have
emanated from college and uni
versity athletic departments
throughout the winter. The viola
tions are a disgrace, there's no
doubt there, but more impor
tantly they finally have brought
into focus the whole question oj
what must be done lo save the
student-athlete from the
malstrom of NC AA division I
athletics. In this Friday Interview
with Sally Jenkins, Stanford ath
letic director Andy Geiger, ad
dresses the problem and how it
affects athletics on the l arm.)
Jenkins: Have the recent scandels
and investigations into recruiting
and NCAA violations causal you

to look into Stan ford's
scholastic-athletic relations '
Geiger: Yes. We went through
all the records tit our people 111 all
varsity sports to see if any similar
problems existed.
Jenkins: A couple of weeks
aqo Andre limes suitl that Stan
ford and Rrigham Young are the
only places where athletes really
go to school. Ciranted that that's
an exaggeration, what is your
reaction to a statement like that'.'
Geiger: That's awfully hard to
answer because I'm not every
place else. I'm here. I think our
people are v cry much involved in
student life: at other places. I
don't know. Some tilings I have
seen and heard about indicate
the same situation. You have to
he awfully careful not to paint
everybody with the same brush.
USC may have some unqualified
student-athletes, but tliev have
also had sonic line athletes who
were Rhodes Scholars. You can't

indict one school or system univ -
ersally.
Jenkins: What kind oj measures
do you or have you taken to in
sure that nothing of the kind ever
happens here at Stanford?
Geiger: We have regular rules*
review sessions and we are con
tinually double checking our
own knowledge of the rules as
they exist. Part of the employ
ment contingency is that the
people we hire have to adhere to
the rules. There is also a clear
distinction between the athletic
stall and the dean of admis
sions. That's not to say that we
don't work with him and make
recommendations, but academic
rev iew is outside of the Athletic
Department.
We also do our best to use the
u niv ersity counseling system, not
our own. We strive to make sure
that the athletes are students
first; there is no subculture
where the athletes are separated

from the rest of the community,
with separate places to eat and
live. We are'nt going to get away
from recognition of the athletic
community, but we can strive to
give them a full student perspec
tive.
Jenkins: How about the idea that
athletes deserve a little more be
cause they work harder than the
average student in college'.'
Geiger: I don't think I
wholeheartedly concurwith that.
Sometimes we have live year
people because til the eligibility
and red-shirt possibility. But I
don't think that we can exempt
athletes from the rigors tit
academic life, because they are
not always going to be athletes
and they should be prepared for
that.
We should not get into a situa
tion where a Stanford degree has
an asterisk on it because the stu
dent was an athlete. That doesn't
mean there is a lack of recogni

tion of the strain and stress
placed on an athlete, it takes
careful planning, but students
are,-gotid at it. 'The community
recognizes it.and there is infor
mal consideration given. How
many times have you gotten be
hind in a class and somebody
gave you a break?
Jenkins: Have you ever had to
deal with NCAA violations be
fore in any of the athletic depart
ments you have worked in?
Geiger: Yes. little ones. And
there have been little ones here.
Tliev are not always made pub
lic. '
If the infraction is minor or
technical you get a private letter.
No director could ever sav that
their program is in total accord
with the rules, because it's a v cry
complex system. Anybody acting
for the department becomes a
