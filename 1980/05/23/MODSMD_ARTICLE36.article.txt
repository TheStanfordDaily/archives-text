# Cindermen go to Washington for Pac-10's
## 
### Templin Dowling Staff Writer 
The Stanford men's track
team is in Seattle today and to
morrow for the IWl) Pac-10
I'rack and Field Championships
at the Chavelle Complex at the
Unixersit) ol Washington.
The Cards are sending 1"
athletes north this year headed
by John Schaer in the 1500 and
Rick Buss in the hammer throw.
Both Schaer and Buss scored
points for the Cards in last year's
meet.
Stanford luis certain!) been a
rebuilding team this season
under the auspices ot their new
head coach Brooks Johnson. Die
team is now 4-4 on the season,
but are 0-3 against Pac-10 com
petition. Thex'xe lost to I CLA
in a crusher 120-33, to Cal —
I 13-4 1 and to Oregon State —
76-70.
But Johnson has been insisting
all season that the scores don't
matter as much as the personal

and team improvement on a
squad this young and in those
terms, the team lias come a long
wa\. At least thex've come far
enough to pull themselx es off the
Pac-10 tloor where the\ finished
last year.
"II we perform out of our
heads, and some other schools
come up flat. I can cm ision us
finishing as high as fifth."
Johnson said rather optimisti
cal!). "And it uc just compete
reasonably well. 1 can sec lis plac
ing sex cnth or eighth. We'll need
14 out of our 17 athletes to score
if we intend to get out of the sec
ond di\ ision."
That's more like it.
For a team on the rise as Stan
lord is this year, the best thing
about a meet like this is to show
oft the stars the) ha\ c and to gix e
the rest ol the squad a taste of
some of the best athletic talent in
the country. With teams like
I SC. Cal and Oregon among its
ranks, the Pac-10 is the toughest
conference around and that can
onlx help a voung team improve.

"This is our second season
the championship season,"
Johnson said. "We're most con
cerned with our individuals
competing well enough to qual
ify lor the AAUs and the Olym
pic Trials now. ITie Pacific-10
conference has got to he the most
competitive conference in the
nation. No one can seriously
argue with that. There are no
weak events at this week's
meet."
Buss and Scluier are definitely
Stanford'* blue chippers. Buss
owns the second best hammer
throw in the country this year at
219-3 and Schaer has been run
ning competitively all year —
ev en in the Pac-11). Johnson feels
he could take the 1500-meters.
Other probable point-winners
tor Stanford are Darrin Nelson,
who set a school record in the
100 last weekend at the Cal Re
lays with an electronic time of
10.35. Gordy Banks (200-
nieters), Gary Bruner (javelin),
Garry Shumway (400 inter
mediate hurdles), Dave Thom
son (Hammer) and Buss in the
discus.

Buss and Scluier are definitely
Stanford'* blue chippers. Buss
owns the second best hammer
throw in the country this year at
219-3 and Schaer has been run
ning competitively all year —
ev en in the Pac-11). Johnson feels
he could take the 1500-meters.
Other probable point-winners
tor Stanford are Darrin Nelson,
who set a school record in the
100 last weekend at the Cal Re
lays with an electronic time of
10.35. Gordy Banks (200-
nieters), Gary Bruner (javelin),
Garry Shumway (400 inter
mediate hurdles), Dave Thom
son (Hammer) and Buss in the
discus.

John Schaer, show n here against I 'CI A earlier this season, is
one of Stanford's biggest threats as a point-getter at today's
Pac-10 Championships.
The Stanford men's track
team is in Seattle today and to
morrow for the IWl) Pac-10
I'rack and Field Championships
at the Chavelle Complex at the
Unixersit) ol Washington.
The Cards are sending 1"
athletes north this year headed
by John Schaer in the 1500 and
Rick Buss in the hammer throw.
Both Schaer and Buss scored
points for the Cards in last year's
meet.
Stanford luis certain!) been a
rebuilding team this season
under the auspices ot their new
head coach Brooks Johnson. Die
team is now 4-4 on the season,
but are 0-3 against Pac-10 com
petition. Thex'xe lost to I CLA
in a crusher 120-33, to Cal —
I 13-4 1 and to Oregon State —
76-70.
But Johnson has been insisting
all season that the scores don't
matter as much as the personal

and team improvement on a
squad this young and in those
terms, the team lias come a long
wa\. At least thex've come far
enough to pull themselx es off the
Pac-10 tloor where the\ finished
last year.
"II we perform out of our
heads, and some other schools
come up flat. I can cm ision us
finishing as high as fifth."
Johnson said rather optimisti
cal!). "And it uc just compete
reasonably well. 1 can sec lis plac
ing sex cnth or eighth. We'll need
14 out of our 17 athletes to score
if we intend to get out of the sec
ond di\ ision."
That's more like it.
For a team on the rise as Stan
lord is this year, the best thing
about a meet like this is to show
oft the stars the) ha\ c and to gix e
the rest ol the squad a taste of
some of the best athletic talent in
the country. With teams like
I SC. Cal and Oregon among its
ranks, the Pac-10 is the toughest
conference around and that can
onlx help a voung team improve.

"This is our second season
the championship season,"
Johnson said. "We're most con
cerned with our individuals
competing well enough to qual
ify lor the AAUs and the Olym
pic Trials now. ITie Pacific-10
conference has got to he the most
competitive conference in the
nation. No one can seriously
argue with that. There are no
weak events at this week's
meet."
