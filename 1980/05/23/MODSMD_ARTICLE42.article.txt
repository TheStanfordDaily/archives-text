Windsurfing
The Stanford windsurfers
traveled to San Luis Obispo
this weekend to compete in
the West Coast Intercol
legiate Windsurfing Champ
ionships, the first intercol
legiate Windsurfing regatta of
its kind, rhey returned with a
third-place trophy.
Twelve Stanford students
entered the races, braving
Lake Lopez's heavy winds
and rougher waters, which
seemed even more formida
ble when compared to Stan
ford's Lake Lag practicing
range.
Said captain Trevor l etter,
"They were racing under
heavy winds â€” lots of people
didn't even start, it was so
windy."
The Stanford Windsurfers,
having never competed in an
organized intercollegiate re

gatta before, also had to con
tend with local talents and
more practiced racers from
UCLA and UCSB.
Among the 60 or, so
surters that did compete,
Stanford's high scorer was
Mike Lung who competed in
five races.
Water polo
I he Stanford women's
water polo club is currently at
the University of Indiana,
competing in the National
Women's Water Polo
C hampionships. Results from
the meet will return with the
team on Monday, May 26.
Women's soccer
Although no Stanford
women were able to compete
in last weekend's California
Regionals held here at Stan
ford, post-season statistics

did place three of Stanford's
players on the NorCal Soccer
All-League Team. These
players were Cindy Shorney,
who led the Cards with nine
goals and IS points overall;
Sue Handel, who, playing as
halfback this year, put in four
goals; and center fullback
Pauline McNamara.
Cricket
A dogged defensive rear
guard action during the last
six overs by Errol Friedberg
and John Barnes enabled the
Stanford cricket club to sal
vage one point from a 57 run
loss Sunday to the Cavaliers
Club of Palo Alto.
The Cavaliers, receiving
useful batting performances
from each of the three Scr
panchy brothers, scored 150
for seven wickets in 40 overs.
Stanford replied with 93 for
nine in 40 overs.
