Itormance in other areas deserves

t Tfie book's outline-type struc-
JtUiC' prevents the reader from

• bureaucratic mess ot the criminal
["system."
V'jr
Kaplan's greatest feat is the
{rehydration of some of the driest
•residing around. U.S. Supreme
Court opinions are notorious for
their literary crimes. One deci
sion (Standard Oil vs. L nited
States) has a 197-word sentence
■sandwiched between enough
whereas, heretofores. and
hences to send an English

teacher looking for a job. Kaplan
has deleted all the extraneous
judicial jargon. Gone are the in
determinate sentences. Gone are
the irrelevant legal nitpickmgs
that drive defendents to plea
k guilty out ot sheer boredom.
>- What remains is an in-depth
it guide to the criminal world, a v ir
it tual handbook for criminals. All
'r the nuances of wheeling and de
n aling with the police, escaping
y prosecution, getting acquitted on
d technicalities, and getting off
>. lightly are explained in lull detail.
c ' After reading this book, it is no
wonder that students here have
• the lowest conviction rate in the
> Pac-10.
11 I he big. red book has some
thing for everyone: There are
several juicy murder cases for
£ pre-meds. and even an especiallv
• tasty one on cannibalism for
11 pre-business majors. The whole
text is must reading for soon-to
s bc-unemployed English majors
who will be compelled to make
crime a way of life. The sections
• on prostitution, gambling,
marijuana and other drugs will
1 be of general interest to all.
j Perhaps the best thing that can
be said about Kaplan's book is
that it makes for gixni solid bath
room reading on a subject with
1 which we all need to become
■ more intimate.
Despite its literary faults.
Criminal Justice should be
1 spared the torch. (It does cost
SI 7.) Still, if you haven't vet
1 bought the book. 1 suggest that
' you wait tor the paperback.
