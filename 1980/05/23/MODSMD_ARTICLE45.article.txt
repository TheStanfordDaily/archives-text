Fo some people, the word
punk means nothing more than
safety pins, blaek leather, and
dark glasses.
lo Howie Klein, one ot San
Francisco's first punk d.j.'s and a
founder of the city's largest punk
label, 41 5 Records, you'd think
punk would mean quite a hit
more.
Yet, his text for the recently
published photo documentary.
X-CAPEES, somehow falls
short of his promise to " . . .
communicate the joy, the angst.
the spirit of the new wave."
Some may argue that the
hook, being a photo documen
tary. need not have ;i profound
or even a well-written text to
portray the essence ot new wav e.
It's true that the photographs, hy
Rave Santos, Richard McCaf
free. and t-Stop Fitzgerald, gi\e
a layman a complete tour
through the Bay area punk
scene. They are appropriately
"punk." asymmetrical and
dynamic. Besides capturing,
from unique angles, candid and
maniacal expressions of the punk
hands and their fans, the photo
graphers manage to round out
their display with shots of punk
fashions and even punk graffiti.
These pictures do a good joh
of telling us the who, the what,
and the where of the punk scene.
It is up to the text to gi\ e us some
clue as to the wh\.
Maybe what Klein ix tr\mg to
tell us is that there is no why. He
insists on reminding the reader in
his last line that "it's all silly, it's
all fun. and pardon my French,
it's onlv rock 'n' roll."

Yet, it there is one thing out
siders resent about the punk
movement, it is just this. It is the
idea of new wax e fans being de
eadent and sell-indulgent posers,
being rich kids wearing designer
hair, which makes people stop
listening to the lyrics and turn
their backs on the movement.
1 hose "punks" who shop for
leather and chains at Saks Fifth
Avenue, who use emotionally
charged words and imagery to
s;t\ essentially nothing, must be
endlessly annoying to those
tounders of new wave who over
turned a British nightclub, sing
ing "Clod save the queen/She
ain't no human being:" They
meant it. man!
\nd so. it seems, did their
( alifornia counterparts. Klein
describes the values ol the new
generation as being "wealth,
lame, drugs, sex. fun, etc." Yet.
these \ague words miss the point
of songs like the Nuns' "Suicide
(. liild and the Dead Kennedys'

"California Über Alles." Sure, it
must be remembered that new
wave may neither be as serious,
organized, or significant as. for
example, the anti-war move
ment ol the sixties. But. while
punk may be less than a move
ment. it is also more than a fash
ion show.
X-CA PEES must be praised for
its accurate account of what hap
pened. But it does an outsider
little good, and may actually do
disservice to those who take
punk seriously. to show Iggy Pop
in a G-string with an electrical
cord in his teeth and a dagger in
his hand without any sort of exp
lanation.
Maybe, as in the case of many
books about art, X-CAPEES is
a case of "You had to be there."
II you were, you may know why
Iggy's holding that dagger and
why Hugh Brown wants to
"Knuke the Knack." If you we
ren't. don't buy this book.
