2 Old Mill
" ; Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
■ I nation of his own life and death is
2 the kind of self-indulgent mistake
S that seemingly is doomed to fail.
■ But Fosse's too damn talented for
J that result; trustratingly, the movie
>■ fluctuates wildly — it's often self
" conscious, but it's often dazzling
J and brilliant.
j Fosse's portrayal of himself is
j ! hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
- Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
2 hard to get involved with Joe Gi-
Ji deon. the Fosse character played
■ by Roy Schieder. You often feel
2 like you're intruding on this some
» times strongly personal film.
|j Schieder successfully captures a
m man who's always on, a man of ta
"i lent who finds his greatest struggles
" ; and his greatest enjoyment in that
»! talent. But he's more a type than a
2 multi-faceted character.
! The often extraordinary musical
■! sequence typify All That Jazz- It's
J hard to think of something more

T number to your own open heart
m ; surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
■i | ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece

Kramer vs. k ramer it ir ★ '/a
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dust in
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (antf vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Apocalypse Now
Century 25, San Jose
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness; he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is, I think, the best American movie
of the just-ended decade. It has al
most untenable ambitions, but the
profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind. Star
ring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen, Robert Duvall, and Fre
deric Forrest.
— R.L.
Clockwork Orange ★★★★
Old Mill, midnight weekend spe
cial
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual film.
Clockwork Orange is a morality
play set in the near future; the issue
at stake is whether individuality is
more important than the society
that must deal with the individual.

Malcolm McDowell stars as a man
whose joy comes mainly from
committing acts of violence; he is
arrested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this sin
gularly disturbing film.
— Jim Mattson
Hair ****
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision of America, but even in
those terms, Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Comes a Horseman •¥"¥••¥■•¥■
New Varsity, tomorrow and Sun
day
It's not clcar here whether this
movie is so enjoyable because it
revives the pleasure of the western,
or merely because it skillfully
exploits the viewer's nostalgia for
the genre. Whatever the reasons,
this is a very seductive piece of
filmmaking, helped immeasurably
by its performers: Jane Fonda,
James Caan and Jason Robards,
who plays the heavy with malicious
joy.
—J.M.
Electric Horseman
New Varsity, tomorrow and Sun
day
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
nrwwiwwmimimyriwvywYwwwYw

co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol —a$ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong withthat.

Chapter Two
Mountain View Theatre
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But, as the previews indicate, there
are plenty of fairly good one-liners
and even a moment here or there
that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-goody self.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles, but the movie's worth
a free night (if any of us ever had
one). A good one for Mom and
Dad.

Fiddler on the RooJ ¥■¥•¥■
Sunday, Mem Aud 8 p.m.
Norman Jewison, who in 1471
;vv*i<nn«vv»wvvwY*wnniw>vyi<nrvT»ir»Tvvvnri

was in much better form than he is
now, directed this vibrant movie
musical. Jewison doesn't attempt
to temper the theatricality inherent
in the material, yet the movie
doesn't get stagy — Jewison keeps
things flowing smoothly. As Tevye,
the main character, Topol may not
be as brilliant as Zero Mostel was in
the stage version, but he still fills
the mighty role with a supreme zest
and vitality.
— R.L.
Norma Rae
Tivoli, San Carlos
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in at the
textile factory where she works.
Sally Field, in the title role, gives an
assured and very likeable perfor
mance; her days as The Flying Nur,
seem far behind as she breathes life
into her rolling-gaited, Southern-

accented character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on explor
ing character than exploiting ac
tion. Ron Leibman and Beau
Bridges co-star.
— J.M.
Ihe Rose if
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Really just another version of A
Star Is Born, except that this one is
clothed with a 1969 setting and
centered on a character vaguely
based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances

at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
hut the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the. concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.
— R.L.
1941
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Aykroyd. Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— R.L.
The China Syndrome ★ ★★
Mountain View Theatre
This superb thriller, which uses a
near-disaster at a nuclear power
plant as its plot premise, was per
versely vindicated by what hap
pened at Three Mile Island. Those
who called the movie "unrealistic"
are hard to find now (maybe
they're out buying Columbia Pic
tures stock). Jane Fonda and Jack
Lemmon are excellent in this flashy
mix of political commentary and
straight genre thriller. Hie perfor
mances keep the movie in high gear
even when the director, James
Bridges, loses his nerve and refuses
to take charge. In the end. an emo
tionally moving film, no matter
how you take its politics.
— R.L.
The Tin Drum Vi
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small boy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror, the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent), a haunting,
young boy who refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
VWWW» » <*YVWIWY»WY<I»TWITWV|V'

adulthood, it is funny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorff s
direction. In German, with subti
tles.
— Michael London
Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In- j
ternational, Caligula is the movie I
that combines big-time stars (Mai- j
colm McDowell, Peter O'Toole) i
with hard-core sex (you name it).
Unfortunately, these two groups |
are mutually exclusive, and audi- i
ence never learns if O'Toole is truly j
deserving of his surname. This |
overly violent movie purports to |
tell a story of ancient Rome, but it J
is really about the calculations of !
buck-hungry magazine publishers
attempting one of history's greatest i
tie-ins; a moving, grunting Penth
ouse. If you want ancient Rome,
watch Ben Hur onT.V. IFyou want
porn, take Caligula's $6 admission
tag and see 24 quarter peep shows.
As entertainment, Caligula doesn't
deliver, and as art, it is vile.

Being There ★★★
Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing. in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife, who is desperately seeking af
fection), but the film drags on as we
see more and more people be taken
in by Chance's one qualm : his abil
ity to make people sec in what
ever they vant — as Chmi ■ ••es
by accident and in *;pite r.' '
comes to the brink oi> :' _ me
president of the U.S.
The film is a cut aganij'
tion in politics, the generation
mesmerized by television, and
empty metaphors about the sea
sons. . ...

The Andromeda Strain ★ ★
Saturday, Cubberley 7:30 &
p.m.
Robert Wise does a literal
tation of Michael Crichton's sc fi
thriller; that might be a we!come
sign in other contexts, but it's the
worst possible mistake here. The
opening sequence — a satellite
contaminated by an unknown life
form lands in a small town and kills
virtually all the inhabitants —
promises at least a mildly good '
time, but then Wise spends so much |
time showing you the elaborate de- j
sert lab facility used by the team of
investigating scientists charged to
discover the nature of the alien '
form that you feel like a judge at a !
set design contest. After this ex- !
crutiating sequence you just feci <
like marking time. Starring Arthur i
Hill, David Wavne and Kate Reid. '
