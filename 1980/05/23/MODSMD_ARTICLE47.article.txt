Carter inspects volcanic site
PORTLAND, Ore. — President Jimmy Car
ter made an aerial inspection yesterday of the
region devastated by Mount St. Helens' vol
canic explosion — a blast so awesome that one
federal official said some victims probably
were "completely disintegrated or vaporized"
and thus will never be found.
As the toll of known dead climbed to 15 and
the list of missing was revised downward to 73,
Carter made a low-level helicopter flight to
within three, miles of the still-smoldering,
cloud-shrouded volcano. He called Sunday's
eruption "one of the most remarkable and
formidable natural phenomena . . . of all re
corded time," and pledged that massive federal
aid would be forthcoming to states, com
munities and individuals.
"There is no way to prepare one's self for the
sights that we beheld this morning," Carter
told a news conference after his 75-minute
tlight. "It's much worse than anything I've ever
seen."
He referred to the seared and scarred 150-
square-mile area hit by a blast wave equi\ alent
"maybe to 10 megatons of nuclear bombs or 10
million tons of TNT" when the mountain,
which had been sputtering volcanic acti\ ity for
nearly two months, exploded Sunday.
Carter Wednesday declared all of
Washington state a major disaster area and
indicated yesterday that he would make similar
designations for Idaho and Montana.
"There will be an enormous expense in
volved and the correction or the repair ol dam
age done by Mount St. Helens' eruption will
undoubtedly take years or perhaps e\en de
cades before it can be completely corrected or
repaired." Carter said. The president said no
cost estimates had been made, but "it will be of
such a magnitude that a special request will
have to be made. 1 don't think we will be able to
accommodate it out of normal budgeted
funds."
Bush pulls out of Calif, race
LYNDHURST. N.J. — Short of money.
George Bush withdrew yesterday from the
California primary and abandoned his last real
hope of winning the Republican presidential
nomination.
The formei CiA director canceled plans to
camp,!" :w Jersey tomorrow and will fly
heme tr. h.'uston, where he and aides will de
cide how nest to wrap up Ins two-year. Sl5
million quest for the presidency. Bush is ex
pected to announce Monday whether he will
keep running in the Ohio and New Jersey
primaries which like California's, will be held
on June 3.
Bush's best hope for the nomination, his
strategists felt, was to score a big upset over
Ronald Reagan in the Iront runner's home
state of California, where 1 AS delegates will be
at stake on a winner-take-all basis. Beating
Reagan in California would raise doubts about
the former governor's electability in
November. But Bush was trailing badly in the
state — by an K-to-I margin, according to a
recent survey by the Los Angeles Times poll.
Two hours before the California pullout was
announced. Bush told reporters it was "un
likely" he would continue on in Ohio and New
Jersey if he dropped out of California.
U.S. reacts to Korean Crisis
WASHINGTON — The United States sent
two airborne command post planes and an air
craft carrier task force toward the strife-torn
Korean peninsula yesterday as high govern
ment officials pondered next steps in dealing
with a potentially explosive South Korean
political crisis.
The two Airborne Warning and Control Sys
tem (AWACS) aircraft, dispatched to Kadena
Air Base on Okinawa, and the aircraft carrier
Coral Sea. moving toward Korean waters from
the Philippines, were intended to underscore a
State Department warning to North Korea that
the United States will "react strongly in accor

dance with its treaty obligations to any external
attempt to exploit the situation" in South
Korea.
Officials said there is no indication of an
impending threat of action by North Korea in
the current crisis. The U.S. deeds and warnings
were described as precautionary measures so
there can be no misunderstanding in Pyon
gyang and no apprehension in Seoul or
elsewhere in Asia about U.S. resolve in case of
North Korean challenge.
The main problem at the moment — and the
principal focus of a high-level White House
meeting yesterday — was the danger of con
tinuing political unrest within South Korea as a
group of dominant generals exercise increas
ingly strong control over domestic decision
there.
The State Department statement, issued in
advance of the White House meeting, called on
"all parties involved" in the civil strife "to
exercise maximum restraint and undertake a
dialogue in search of peaceful settlement." The
statement also said the United States will urge
all parties, "when calm has been restored," to
seek means of resuming the program of politi
cal liberalization that was cast in doubt by the
military takeover of the country under martial
law.
Committee defeats import fee
WASHINGTON — The House Ways and
Means Committee voted 27-7 yesterday to kill
the administration's 10-cents-a-gallon
gasoline conservation tee. setting the stage for
a major confrontation between President
Jimmy Carter and Congress over energy pol
icy.
The measure would raise retail prices of
gasoline under a complex plan aimed at reduc
ing imports of foreign oil.
Opponents of the fee sought an early show
down on the House floor, where they seem
assured of victory , but House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill (D-Mass.) supporting the president,
will try to postpone a vote.
The overwhelming defeat of the proposal in
the intluential Ways and Means Committee
illustrated the depth of congressional opposi
tion to a measure that would increase gasoline
prices 10 cents a gallon in an election year.
Opponents had attacked the fee as inflatio
nary because it would raise prices, and as a
gimmick to balance the budget because it
would bring the Treasury $10 billion a year in
additional revenue.
Administration strategists hope a delay in
the vote on the House floor will shift congres
sional sentiment because of budget problems.
A Senate-House conference committee has
agreed on a federal budget for fiscal 19N 1 that
does not require money from the conservation
fee to maintain a delicate balance.
However, the deepening recession could
throw the budget into disarray. Government
spending probably will increase because of ex
panded food stamp distribution and higher
welfare outlays. Revenues probably will de
cline because fewer people will be working and
paying taxes. So. money from the conservation
fee may become essential to balance the
budget.
Islamic states condemn U.S.
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — "Good resolu
tions, good resolutions. Fifteen condemnations
of the United States." Abdul Mushin Abu
Meizer. the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion's chief delegate, said here yesterday as the
Islamic world's foreign ministers ended their
conference.
Great-power rivalries stood at the center of
this conference of Islamic nations, many of
which form what President Jimmy Carter's na
tional security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski has
called the "arc of crisis" that stretches from
North Africa, through Turkey and the turbu
lent Middle East to troubled South Asia.
The region has become the focus of an
American-Soviet power struggle, and the Is
lamic world made it clear yesterday it does not

like to be in (he center of a big power battle.
Nonetheless, the major controversy at this
meeting revolved around the big-power issues.
The United States was condemned for its sup
port of Israel, Egypt and the Camp David
Mideast peace talks and for its attempt to pres
sure Iran and rescue the American hostages
held there for the past six months, while the
Soviet Union was condemned for its invasion
and occupation of Afghanistan.
The conference's Secretary General, Hebib
Chatti, said he also sees the possibility of an
international conference among the Soviets,
Pakistan, Iran, China and the United States to
guarantee Afghanistan's sovereignty and
nonaligned status.
NOW accused of ERA bribe
SPRINGFIELD. 111. — E:v idence that a rep
resentative of the National Organization lor
Women may have tried to bribe a state law
maker to vote for the Equal Rights Amend
ment will be presented to a Sangamon County
grand jury June 5. the state's attorney said
yesterday.
William Roberts said that of the many alle
gations of FRA vote-buying swirling through
the Capitol in the past week, "that's the only
case that I see that has developed."
Highly placed sources say Rep. Nord
Swanstrom has told investigators he was
handed a card with the name of a NOW rep
resentative printed on it and a handwritten
message offering him $1000 il he would vote
for the ERA.
The incident allegedly occurred last week as
ERA supporters lobbied l ev erishly for support
in preparation tor a planned vote on ERA in
the House. The vote was called off when they
fell two votes shy of the 107 needed for pas
sage.
The proposed ERA. which would outlaw
discrimination based on sex. has been ap
prov ed by 35 ot the 38 states needed to become
part ot the U.S. Constitution. Five have since
rescinded their approval, but validity of that
action is in doubt.
Diplomat preps for mission
Syrian diplomat Abid Daoudy went to
Geneva yesterday for talks with U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim in prepara
tion for his mission to negotiate a settlement of
the hostage crisis in Iran.
Waldheim chose Daoudy. a member ot the
five-man U.N. commission that visited Iran last
March, to make the new trip to Iran — the
latest U.N. effort to win freedom for the 53
Americans held captive for 201 days.
The commission looked into Iranian grie
vances against deposed Shah Mohammad Re/a
Pahlavi and the United States, but that effort to
work out a solution failed when Iran refused to
let the commission talk with the hostages.
Waldheim said Daoudy was being sent this
time to "prepare for" the commission's return
to Iran. Iranian officials said they will not dis
cuss the hostages with Daoudy.
Meanwhile. Iran's U.N. ambassador, Man
sour Farhang. said in an interview with a
Tehran newspaper that Iran had reaped all the
"political propaganda" to be had from the sei
zure of the hostages and the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran Nov. 4.
Continued captivity ot the 53 Americans is
putting Iran in a position of "international iso
lation," Farhang said.
French reject U.S. criticism
PARIS — In a deepening split with the Un
ited States. France angrily rejected criticism by
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie and vowed
Wednesday to maintain contact with the Soviet
Union without "prior approval" from
Washington.
However, there was mounting displeasure
expressed in the Western European press and
within France itself over President Valery Gis
card d'Estaing's summit meeting Monday in
Warsaw, Poland with Soviet leader Leonid

Brezhnev.
The French message is that they w ill stand by
the United States in a crunch as they did during
the Cuban missile crisis, but otherwise they will
go their own way rather than become an
American "province," as Giscard d'Estaing
put it.
The French president says he believes in
keeping a dialogue going with the Soviets even
though he disapproves of the Kremlin's inter
vention in Afghanistan. His aides ask why, it
Muskie meets with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, Giscard d'Estaing shouldn't
meet with Brezhnev.
French Foreign Minister Jean Francois-
Poncet, defending the summit in a speech to
the National Assembly, acknowledged it had
left Paris and Moscow "tar apart" over the
Soviet Union's military intervention in Af
ghanistan.
Francois-Poncet said that France's allies had
not been informed earlier of the meeting be
cause of "unfortunate precedents" in which
leaks from Washington had "altered the
character" of other meetings — notablv
foreign ministers' meeting in Bonn. West
Germany, to coordinate Western strategy on
Afghanistan that France wound up boycotting.
Jobless rate hits 13-year high
WASHINGTON — The number of Ameri
cans filing new claims for unemployment in
surance reached the highest levels in at least 13
years during early May, a new sign that the
economy is falling into a deeper recession than
the Carter administration predicts.
The Labor Department reported yesterday
that a seasonally adjusted 616,000 jobless
people tiled for unemployment insurance dur
ing the week ending May 10, up from 595,000
for the week ending May 3. The latest figures
represented the highest number of initial
claims tor one week since the government
began collecting seasonally adjusted data in
1967.
The weekly unemployment claims informa
tion is a good indicator of changes in the na
tion's unemployment rate, which shot up from
6.2 percent in March to 7 percent in April.
Economists said yesterday that the new figures
suggest another sizable jump in unemployment
will be revealed when the May rate is issued
early next month.
President Jimmy Carter's economic advisers
officially are predicting a short and mild reces
sion this year, with unemployment peaking at
7.3 percent by next year. Privately, however,
some government economists say the jobless
rate could top 7.3 percent this month.
"We're going to see another big jump in
May, perhaps to 7.3 or 7.4 percent." said an
administration economist, who asked anonym
ity.
"Clearly, we are heading beyond 7.5 percent
unemployment. There's a good chance we'll be
up to S percent by the fall." said the economist.
The rise in the jobless rate at this time also
means high school and college graduates will
encounter serious problems finding their first
full-time jobs, chief economist for the AFL-
ClO Rudy Oswald said.
"Every indication is that unemployment will
reach the depths of the last recession or be
worse," he said.
During the 1974-75 recession, unemploy
ment peaked at 9 percent, the highest level
since the Great Depression of the 19305.
Dow Jones up 11.86
NEW YORK — Stock prices rallied across a
broad front yesterday as blue chip issues scored
their biggest gain in a month.
Analysts said the market's underlying
strength was tied to the recent declines in in
terest rates which have encouraged investors to
move funds out of interest bearing investments
and into stocks.
Ihe Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks rose 1 1.86 to 842.92. That was its
largest gain in a session since April 22 when it
surged ahead more than 30 points
