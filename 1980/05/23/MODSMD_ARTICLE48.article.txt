# Newsweek distorts stats on cheating
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
One of the authors of a recent
Newsweek article that claimed two
thirds of the undergraduates here con
fessed to plagiarizing papers or pad
ding bibliographies has admitted that
the statistic is a distortion, and the fi
gure should have been much lower.
"We probably should have checked
those figures before (before the May
20 issue was published)," said Elliott
Lee, one of the article's authors. "Ap
propriate apologies and corrections
will be made."
The statement was made in a story
about cheating at a university in Mary
land where students reportedly have
been taking exams for other students.
The statistics used by Newsweek
were drawn from a report of the Prince
ton Honor Committee published this
year. Lee said. That committee
results from a 197 ft study conducted by
Sally Cole, director of research here,
for its statistics on Stanford.
In fact. Cole's research indicates
only 15 percent of students here admit
to plagiarism.
1 ler results also indicated 23 percent
of undergraduates here conceded that
they had "padded" items in a bibliog
raphy at least once. But, unlike many
campuses, the extent of student
admitted academic dishonesty had not
changed significantly between 1961
and 197 ft, according to Cole.
Cole said she has sent a telegram to
Newsweek to set the record straight.
Apparently, in the process of reading
the Princeton committee's report and
preparing the article for publication,
the figure on Stanford's plagiarizing
rate was distorted, Lee said.
