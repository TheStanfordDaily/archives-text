# IFC rejects rush policy changes proposed for alcohol over-use
## 
### Mac Funk Staff Writer 
The Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC) yesterday detailed a
proposal designed to alleviate problems associated with the
over-use of alcohol during spring fraternity rush.
The council also elected Delta Kappa Rpsilon fraternity
member Richard David IFC president for the coming year.
The defeated proposal was intended to discourage stu
dents from attending rush functions merely to obtain tree
alcohol, according to outgoing II C president John Kinney.
The proposal called for the first week ot rush to be devoted
solely to afternoon open houses at the fraternities, followed
by two weeks of evening rush activities. This would have
de-emphasi/cd the use of alcohol at rush functions from the
start, according to Kinney. He said it was hoped this change
of emphasis would continue for the remainder of rush func
tions.
Arguments
Jim Isaacs, this spring's rush chairman, argued against the
proposal on the grounds that it would reduce the numbers
of rushees visiting the houses during the first week of rush.
Another IFC representative mentioned that many athletes
who have afternoon practice would not be able to attend
rush functions scheduled in the afternoon.
However, Sean Laugh I in, IFC representative from Beta
Theta I'i. said, "Without- naming names, some frats do put
pressure to drink on the pledges that come through during
rush."
But he said he was uncertain whether the proposed
changes would have alleviated the problem. "Some frats are
going to encourage too much drinking whether the rush

function is in the afternoon or the evening. Hur. here
should be more p ssure to v ;i it."

significant negative sentiment both from the administration
and from the community in general. Kinney emphasized
that the IFC "would need to be sure that the University
commission was not inherently biased."
Asked about recent tensions between the administration
and the fraternities. David replied that a lack of communi
cation is the biggest problem. "Too much communication
takes places only through official lines, and not enough
actual understanding about how we all feel is built up."
David said.
David said he felt that the University overreacted slightly
to the recent rush incidents. He added that he thinks the
fraternities are working to reduce the problems associated
with alcohol use during rush. Hut he emphasized that
though the incidents occurred at rush functions, they are the
result of alcohol abuse and should not be blamed solely on
fraternities.
