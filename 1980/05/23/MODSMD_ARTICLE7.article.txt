## Cubans continue flood into Florida Haitians trickle into U.S. 
### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
While the flood of Cuban re
fugees into the U.S. during the
past month has created a tre
mendous stir, the daily trickle of
Haitians continues almost un
noticed.
Yet as many as 30,000 Hai
tians are believed to have en
tered the U.S. illegally during the
past decade.rand 9000 are ex
pected to arrive this year. Every
week hundreds embark on the
long and grueling journey across
the Caribbean to escape the de
stitution of their lives in Haiti,
where annual personal incomes
average $225.
Although the U.S. Refugee
Act of 1980 drops old geog
raphic and ideological restric
tions and adopts the U.N.'s
broader definition of a refugee as
anyone fleeing racial, religious,
political or social persecution,
the U.S. does not have an open
door policy. While foreigners
fleeing dictators are entitled to
political asylum, those escaping
poverty under regimes friendly
to the U.S. are not.
Rationale
One rationale government of
ficials use to explain not accept
ing economic refugees such as
the Haitians is that to do so
would force the U.S. to ( admit
unlimited numbers from other
impoverished nations as well.
However. Haitians claim that
they are political refugees flee
ing from political repression
under President Jean-Claude
Duvalier. The U.S. State De
partment contests that it has
found no evidence of political
persecution by the Haitian re

gime. The question of whether
the Haitians are political or
economic refugees is now being
decided in the Miami Federal
Court. America's authority to
stem illegal entrance of Haitians
is also being challenged by a coal
ition of ci\il rights groups, in
cluding the National Council of
Churches and the National As
sociation for the Advancement
of Colored People. Until the case
has been decided, efforts to de
port refugees from Haiti who
have already entered the U.S.
has been barred by the Miami
court.
Cubans by the thousands
Meanwhile. Cubans are being
admitted to the U.S. by the
thousands. By last Sunday, the
total in the 28-day refugee sealitt
had risen to 57.467. and Cuban
officials have predicted that un
less Castro clamps down, the
flow could easily top the 265.000
who fled Cuba be en 1967
and 1973.
At first, these refugees were
welcomed to the U.S. with "open
hearts and open arms," in Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's words, but
in the past week, he re\ ersed this
line and ordered stiff measures
to control the Cuban refugee
flow.
The Cuban exodus began on
Good Friday, when Castro an
nounced that his revolution was
voluntary and that those who did
not support it could leave. To his
international embarrassment,
this announcement was met b\ a
massive movement of people out
of his country .
In a sense, the Cubans are also
economic refugees. Many who
left were escaping the austerity

of Cuban life as well as the lack
of liberty. Over the years, Cas
tro's dictatorship has success
fully elicited immense economic
sacrifice from the population.
This year, a bad tobacco crop,
which resulted from a plant dis
ease, and a 25 percent drop in
sugar production exacerbated
the situation. Prices rose, while
wages remained constant and
unemployment increased. Indi
cations to Cubans were that 20
years of austerity would be fol
lowed by 20 more.
Castro angry
Castro expressed anger at the
"worms" leaving the country
and organized a demonstration
in which Cubans carried signs
claiming that the refugees were
"selling themselves for jeans."
Because of Castro's decision
to ban the airlift to Costa Rica,
the Cuban refugees have been
entering the U.S. technicalh as

illegal aliens in a disorganized
sealitt. Carter condemns the sea
lilt on the grounds that it is unre
stricted and hazardous for the re
fugees. He has proposed a fed
eral program to bring in Cubans
who meet immigration stan
dards. He has also insisted that
Cuba allow screening of the re
fugees on its own soil.
Civil rights activists for the
Haitians charge that the Cubans,
who are mostly white, are getting
unwarranted preference over the
Haitians, who are mostly black.
Government officials deny any
social connection, stating that to
open the door for Haitians would
force the U.S. to admit
thousands more seeking escape
from poverty in the Caribbean.
Advocates for the refugees also
contend that Carter is reluctant
to openly accept Haitians for
fear of causing trouble with Pres
ident Duvalier.

In a sense, the Cubans are also
economic refugees. Many who
left were escaping the austerity

of Cuban life as well as the lack
of liberty. Over the years, Cas
tro's dictatorship has success
fully elicited immense economic
sacrifice from the population.
This year, a bad tobacco crop,
which resulted from a plant dis
ease, and a 25 percent drop in
sugar production exacerbated
the situation. Prices rose, while
wages remained constant and
unemployment increased. Indi
cations to Cubans were that 20
years of austerity would be fol
lowed by 20 more.
Castro angry
Castro expressed anger at the
"worms" leaving the country
and organized a demonstration
in which Cubans carried signs
claiming that the refugees were
"selling themselves for jeans."
Because of Castro's decision
to ban the airlift to Costa Rica,
the Cuban refugees have been
entering the U.S. technicalh as

illegal aliens in a disorganized
sealitt. Carter condemns the sea
lilt on the grounds that it is unre
stricted and hazardous for the re
fugees. He has proposed a fed
eral program to bring in Cubans
who meet immigration stan
dards. He has also insisted that
Cuba allow screening of the re
fugees on its own soil.
Civil rights activists for the
Haitians charge that the Cubans,
who are mostly white, are getting
unwarranted preference over the
Haitians, who are mostly black.
Government officials deny any
social connection, stating that to
open the door for Haitians would
force the U.S. to admit
thousands more seeking escape
from poverty in the Caribbean.
Advocates for the refugees also
contend that Carter is reluctant
to openly accept Haitians for
fear of causing trouble with Pres
ident Duvalier.
While the flood of Cuban re
fugees into the U.S. during the
past month has created a tre
mendous stir, the daily trickle of
Haitians continues almost un
noticed.
Yet as many as 30,000 Hai
tians are believed to have en
tered the U.S. illegally during the
past decade.rand 9000 are ex
pected to arrive this year. Every
week hundreds embark on the
long and grueling journey across
the Caribbean to escape the de
stitution of their lives in Haiti,
where annual personal incomes
average $225.
Although the U.S. Refugee
Act of 1980 drops old geog
raphic and ideological restric
tions and adopts the U.N.'s
broader definition of a refugee as
anyone fleeing racial, religious,
political or social persecution,
the U.S. does not have an open
door policy. While foreigners
fleeing dictators are entitled to
political asylum, those escaping
poverty under regimes friendly
to the U.S. are not.
Rationale
One rationale government of
ficials use to explain not accept
ing economic refugees such as
the Haitians is that to do so
would force the U.S. to ( admit
unlimited numbers from other
impoverished nations as well.
However. Haitians claim that
they are political refugees flee
ing from political repression
under President Jean-Claude
Duvalier. The U.S. State De
partment contests that it has
found no evidence of political
persecution by the Haitian re

gime. The question of whether
the Haitians are political or
economic refugees is now being
decided in the Miami Federal
Court. America's authority to
stem illegal entrance of Haitians
is also being challenged by a coal
ition of ci\il rights groups, in
cluding the National Council of
Churches and the National As
sociation for the Advancement
of Colored People. Until the case
has been decided, efforts to de
port refugees from Haiti who
have already entered the U.S.
has been barred by the Miami
court.
Cubans by the thousands
Meanwhile. Cubans are being
admitted to the U.S. by the
thousands. By last Sunday, the
total in the 28-day refugee sealitt
had risen to 57.467. and Cuban
officials have predicted that un
less Castro clamps down, the
flow could easily top the 265.000
who fled Cuba be en 1967
and 1973.
At first, these refugees were
welcomed to the U.S. with "open
hearts and open arms," in Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's words, but
in the past week, he re\ ersed this
line and ordered stiff measures
to control the Cuban refugee
flow.
The Cuban exodus began on
Good Friday, when Castro an
nounced that his revolution was
voluntary and that those who did
not support it could leave. To his
international embarrassment,
this announcement was met b\ a
massive movement of people out
of his country .
