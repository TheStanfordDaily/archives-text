# Iranian women defend their rights
## 
### Jonathan Randal The Washington Post 
TEHRAN, Iran — In the forefront of the
struggle against the shah, and the first group
to challenge the new revolutionary order,
Iranian women seem determined to de
monstrate anew if necessary to defend rights
threatened by the Moslem clergy.
Today Iranian women are watching with
undisguised suspicion the Moslem clergy's
efforts to regulate their professional and per
sonal lives. Their feelings are shared by many
generally more cautious Iranian men fearful
of other aspects of real or threatened clerical
dictatorship.
But unlike the men, Iranian women — if a
series of interviews accurately reflects the
national mood — appear willing to take to
the streets again rather than knuckle under
to the increasingly despised and mocked
clergy.
Threat remains
Many of the worst fears that prompted the
women's marches in the winter of 1979 soon
after the revolution have not been realized.
But the threat remains that the new parlia
ment, dominated by the right-wing clerical
Islamic Republican Party, will try to vote
laws barring women from various occupa
tions, restricting their rights and reducing
them to second-class citizens.
"The clergy wants to put the country back
1400 years by applying Islamic law," one
prominent woman lawyer said in an inter
view. "But Iranian women are stubborn. We
will not sit with folded arms. We will de
monstrate if necessary."
Raising such suspicions have been various
decisions by the government. As was the case
in motivating the 1979 marches, restrictions
on dress have been the most obvious cause of
dismay. Yet women employees of the state
railway reportedly are resisting orders that
they wear head scarves and a uniform of
tunic and pants.
Segregation
Segregation of the sexes now begins in
school and applies to public bathing and even
wedding receptions.
A woman lawyer said she was convinced
that the clergy is "trying to get rid of women
in government jobs." She noted that all five

senior women judges in Tehran have been
removed from their jobs and quietly given
less visible work in the Justice Ministry.
A colleague criticized the women judges
for accepting their fate without a fight and
said they apparently feared heing transferred
to provinces, had they protested.
Women lawyers have been in the forefront
of the successful fight to prevent the clergy
from simply abrogating the Family Protec
tion Act passed in 1967 to safeguard wo
men's rights.
Divorce proceedings are still handled by
civil courts rather than Islamic ones. Islamic
law, in theory at least, allows a man to di
vorce his wife by repeating three times. "I
divorce thee."
Child custody
Child custody proceedings now openly
favor the father and. if he is not around or is
considered incompetent, his family rather
than the mother will receive custody of minor
children, according to women lawyers.
"It's out-and-out male supremacy." a
lawyer said.
If many Iranians of both sexes are increas
ingly outspoken about clerical interference
in politics and everyday life, it is often the
women who are more militant, possibly be
cause they have borne the brunt of decisions
offered by Iran's new, self-appointed keep
ers of morality.
Without exception, however, the women
interviewed drew a clear distinction between
the meddlesome clergy and Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the revolution's leader.
He was not held responsible for the excesses.
The only woman who felt fearless enough
to be quoted by name was A/am Taleghani.
daughter of a late non-conformist ayatollah
widely respected for his tolerance of other
religions and the political left. She is one of
three women elected to the 270-seat parlia
ment.
Unsubstantiated rumors
Other women interviewed were all more
cautious. A beautiful, young upper-class
woman, dressed in matching pink blouse,
pants and shoes, was clearly upset by unsub
stantiated rumors that fanatics had thrown
acid on women who refused to wear the full
length chador or cover their heads.

"If I go downtown, 1 think twice about
what I wear." she said. "Maybe I've gotten
more scared and paranoid, but if I have to go
to government offices ... I wear a dark shirt
and no makeup. Why take chances?"
An older, well-established woman lawyer
said she goes to court in short sleeves, consi
dered dangerously erotic by the clerical
purists, and without covering her head.
"No one can force me to put a scarf on my
head or change my thinking," she said, "but
other women can wear the chador. That
doesn't bother me as long as they are not
dominated by their fathers, husbands and
brothers."
Parliamentary defense
Like many of those interviewed, she said
she was counting on the three women mem
bers of parliament to defend women's rights.
"We are going to watch them like hawks
and keep track of every little thing," she said.
"And if the clergy go too far, they'd better
watch out."
Azam Taleghani. dressed in strict head
scarf and a black, formless dress, said she had
hoped that "50 women would be elected."
She made clear she would defend not only
women's rights, but also the open brand of
Islam associated with her family.
Imprisoned along with her father under
the monarchy, and reportedly tortured and
raped before his eyes by secret policemen,
she is enormously respected, even by those
who disagree with her politics.
Refused endorsement
She pointedly refused endorsement during
the parliamentary campaign by the Islamic
Republican Party, which many Iranians hold
responsible for the puritanical, narrow
minded and quasi-totalitarian tendencies in
the revolution.
Although she decried the party's hard-line
tactics, she said the left, too had been at fault
in trying to take over the universities, bring
ing on clashes with Moslem fundamentalists.
Choosing her words with the care of a prac
ticed politician, she answered a question
about the Islamic Republicans without nam
ing the party.
"As long as there is blood in my veins," she
said, "we must tight against groups who do
not let real Islam be established."
