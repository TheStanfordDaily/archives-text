1 SOPHOMORE SEMINARS I
■ The Sophomore Seminar Bulletin incorrectly described two seminars, No. ■
I 84 and No. 85. Correct abbreviated descriptions follow: m
v 84. The Supreme Court and First Amendement Freedom of the «
m Lois P. Sheinfeld. Attorney and Lecturer. M
m This seminar will closely examine Supreme Court opinions and selected lower m
m court decisions dealing with the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of the m
■ press. We will take a critical look at the balances which theCourt has struck in this «
m area, including (1) prior censorship versus national security; (2) protection of confi- ■
m dential informants versus the government's need to know; and (3) the press' right of M
m access versus needs for secrecy. Included in the readings will be a case involving W
■ The Stanford Daily. We will also consider the principal features of the American legal M
■ system, and the role of the Supreme Court of the United States within that system. m
M A major component of the seminar will be a moot court exercise in which each 112
m student will research and write a brief and then make an oral presentation as an a
M appellate lawyer. 5 units, Autumn-Winter, M 2:15-5:00. ■
■ 85. The First Amendment: Freedom of Speech. (DR:S). m
M Louis P. Sheinfeld, Attorney and Lecturer. »
m In this seminar, particular emphasis will be placed on those First Amendment ■
M issues which are of special concern to college students, including the right to K
m demonstrate, the right of symbolic expression and protest, and the right of students M
m and faculty to freedom of speech and expression within the university setting. In the m
■ latter connection, we will take a critical look at the Bruce Franklin case involving v
■ Stanford University. We will read Supreme Court decisions and focus on the princi- ■
M pie features of the American legal system. ■
m A significant component of the seminar will be a moot court exercise in which each M
m student will research and write a brief and then make an oral presentation as an m
\ appellate lawyer. 5 units, Autumn-Winter, F 1:30-3:30. W
