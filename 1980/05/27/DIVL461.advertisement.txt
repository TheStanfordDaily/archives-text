Class List Sign-Up
Autumn Quarter 1980-81
There will not be Advance Registration in Spring Quarter for
Autumn Quarter 1980-81. Instead there will be a Class List
Sign-Up for current students to sign class lists for those
courses requiring it. Courses will be listed on Autumn Prog
ram Cards that will be available at the "Autumn Program
Cards" windowin the lobby of the Old Union beginning May
27. Signing of the Class Lists will begin May 27 according to
the schedule in the Time Schedule (available at the Informa
tion window in the lobby of the Old Union.)
Each student should bring his or her ID to get a Program
Card. No advisors signatures will be required on the Autumn
Program Cards and only courses that require signing class
lists should be shown. Students who do not need to sign class
lists should not fill out and turn in Autumn Program Cards.
The last day to pick up Program Cards is June 3, but Class
Lists can be signed through June 4. The cards should be
turned in at the Class List windows by June 4 and will be
available for students to pick up at Maples Pavilion on regist
ration days or the Registrar's Credentials Window after that.
