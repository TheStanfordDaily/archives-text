## South Africa rebels blame 'system' 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Almost all South African re
sources are in the hands ot the
white ruling class, and the U.S.
has not helped end that injustice,
according to Mike Morgan, a de
serter from the South African
Defense Force, who spoke here
Thursday.
Morgan spoke before 60
people with Shall Amuele. a
member of the South West Afri
can People's Organization
(SWAPO) on black resistance to
the apartheid government in
South Africa.
SWAPO. formed in 1959. or
ganized the liberation nun ement
of Namibia with the United Na
tions' support. Namibia is cur
rently occupied by 65.000
troops.
"Our enemies were not really

only white," Amuele said. "Our
war was against the system in
Namibia.
•"As long as the South African
system exists, Namibia is still not
independent." he said. South
Africa also needs political and
material support from other
countries, he said.
Whites control the entire gov
ernment and N7 percent of the
land in South Africa, while only
representing 20 percent of the
population.
. Mbrgan is working to build
war resistance inside the South
African military. He became a
war-resister when he realized the
troops fighting SWAPO re
ceived praise for the highest
body counts, he said.
•'lt was then I decided I could
no longer participate in such out
rageous acts of inhumanity," he

said.
"We were told that black
people in Namibia were ter
rorists." he said. But he disco
vered the South African military
was the true brutal force, he said.
Amuele cited several tortures
used by the South African
whites. These included electric
shock treatments, live burial,
drowning and the cutting off of
fingers.
He added that South Africans
attack the young, the old and the
sick.
Morgan said "it is thanks to
the U.S. that South Africa has
nuclear capabilities."
John Pomfrat of the Memorial
Church task force on South Af
rica said, however, that the U.S.
did not intend to gi> e South Af
rica nuclear capabilities. The
U.S. has merely traded nuclear

production materials tor
uranium. South Africa has the
most uranium in the world.
Morgai)» also cited the large
numherol mercenaries in South
Africa. I le said their salaries are
often determined by the number
of blacks they kill.
"The U.S. is turning a blind
eye to the recruitment of mer
cenaries in this country." he ad
ded.
Pomfrat said, however, that
the mercenaries are often not
made aware that they're fighting
for an incredibly repressed coun
try.
Morgan concluded that war
resistance plays a small part in
the overall struggle.
"But one less gun means one
less soldier SWAPO has to deal
with," he said.
