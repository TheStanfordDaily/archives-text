# Some Soviet Jews bypass Israel
## Dropouts threaten Jewish emigration 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW — The sharp
slowdown in Jewish emigration
'ffom the Soviet Union, which
has eut the exodus so tar this year
tii two-thirds that of the compar
able period ol I 979. has also ag
gravated divisions among ac
tivists here over the "dropouts'
problem.
"Dropouts" are Jewish emig
rants who do not go to Israel but
settle in the United States or
other Western countries. The
vast majority were allowed to
emigrate only alter having said,
as required bv So\ iet authorities,
that they were going to rejoin
relatives in Israel.
In tact, however, about two
out of three ol the record 51.000
who left last year did not go to
Israel. They "dropped out" in
Vienna — their first Western
way station after lea\ ing the
Soviet Union — and went
elsewhere.
Some Jewish "refuseniks" —
activists who ha\e been refused
permission to leave — have long
reproached the "dropouts" in
private. But now they are doing
it openly, and the number who
share their views appears to be
growing. Some have spoken bit
terly in recent weeks to Ameri
can friends about former col
leagues who have gone to the
United States.
And this more rigidly /ionist
faction among Soviet Jews has
made at least one important con
vert among well-known re
fuseniks — Alexander Lerner.
who first applied to emigrate in
1971. His field is the compara
tive study of electronic comput
ers and the human nervous svs
tem.

Uerner. who is personally ded
icated to Israel and who hopes
eventually to be allowed to go
there, for years spoke out in
favor ot tree emigration as an
end in itself. Now. he said in an
interv iew."l've changed my pos
ition." He said he now believes
that "opportunists" are taking
advantage of the sacrifices made
by the early activists — \ irtually
all ot whom were Zionists — for
their own selfish benefit.
He complained ot the "cyni
cism" of many Soviet Jews who
wanted to leave hut who openly
proclaim that "only fools go to
Israel." He said: "This offends
me. It's the main reason why I
changed my position."
Lerner said the dropout issue
"stems trom growing concern
here that the great number ot
people diverting to America are
cutting down the possibilities ot
emigration for Soviet Jews who
want to go to Israel."
Divisions
The issue has become more
divisive among Soviet Jews as
the number being allowed to leave
has been cut back in recent
months. The reduction began in
some parts of the Soviet Union
as early as a year ago and has
increased greatly since late last
year.
About 11,300 Soviet Jews
emigrated in the first four
months ot 19SS0 — a drop ot
about one-third from the same
period in 1979.
As the number allowed to
leave has dropped, so has the
"dropout rate." according to
Western diplomatic sources.
Nevertheless, fewer than half ot
those who have left so far this
year have gone to Israel.
Lerner and about 20 other ac

ti\ists wrote to the New York
based Conference on So\ iet
Jewry about the problem earlier
this year, he said. Earlier, he had
written to Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin on the same
subject.
•Deserters'
"They are not traitors, hut
they are deserters." l.erner said
ot the dropouts.
Among other measures, the
cybernetieist has proposed that
financial support tor Jews going
to the United States should be
only in the form ot loans rather
than gifts and grants.
He has also suggested that
"Voice of Israel" radio broad
casts beamed into the So\ iet
Union in Russian devote more
time to the emigration issue, and
answer some of the So\ iet prop
aganda alleging that a poor life
awaits Soviet Jews in Israel.
Finally, he proposed that the
processing center for So\ iet Jews
trying to emigrate to America be
moved from Rome to an "ex
traterritorial camp" that would
be established in Haifa. Israel.
Negative attitudes
The emigrants must stay in the
Rome center for several weeks
before their papers can be pro
cessed anyway, he said.and if the
camp was in Haifa they could get
"a taste of Israel" that might per
suade some to change their nega
tive attitudes about living there.
Many Soviet Jews oppose anv
attempts to discourage them
from emigrating to the United
States, of course. But others
want to go much further than
Lerner in discouraging the emig
rants from going anywhere but
Israel. They would cut oft out

side support completely lor
Sov ict Jews going to anv country
other than Israel.
It was widely believed here
that the authorities planned to
force prominent activists out ol
the capital this summer, but as it
has turned out. there apparently
will be no need lor coercion.

Uerner. who is personally ded
icated to Israel and who hopes
eventually to be allowed to go
there, for years spoke out in
favor ot tree emigration as an
end in itself. Now. he said in an
interv iew."l've changed my pos
ition." He said he now believes
that "opportunists" are taking
advantage of the sacrifices made
by the early activists — \ irtually
all ot whom were Zionists — for
their own selfish benefit.
He complained ot the "cyni
cism" of many Soviet Jews who
wanted to leave hut who openly
proclaim that "only fools go to
Israel." He said: "This offends
me. It's the main reason why I
changed my position."
Lerner said the dropout issue
"stems trom growing concern
here that the great number ot
people diverting to America are
cutting down the possibilities ot
emigration for Soviet Jews who
want to go to Israel."
Divisions
The issue has become more
divisive among Soviet Jews as
the number being allowed to leave
has been cut back in recent
months. The reduction began in
some parts of the Soviet Union
as early as a year ago and has
increased greatly since late last
year.
About 11,300 Soviet Jews
emigrated in the first four
months ot 19SS0 — a drop ot
about one-third from the same
period in 1979.
As the number allowed to
leave has dropped, so has the
"dropout rate." according to
Western diplomatic sources.
Nevertheless, fewer than half ot
those who have left so far this
year have gone to Israel.
Lerner and about 20 other ac

ti\ists wrote to the New York
based Conference on So\ iet
Jewry about the problem earlier
this year, he said. Earlier, he had
written to Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin on the same
subject.
•Deserters'
"They are not traitors, hut
they are deserters." l.erner said
ot the dropouts.
Among other measures, the
cybernetieist has proposed that
financial support tor Jews going
to the United States should be
only in the form ot loans rather
than gifts and grants.
He has also suggested that
"Voice of Israel" radio broad
casts beamed into the So\ iet
Union in Russian devote more
time to the emigration issue, and
answer some of the So\ iet prop
aganda alleging that a poor life
awaits Soviet Jews in Israel.
Finally, he proposed that the
processing center for So\ iet Jews
trying to emigrate to America be
moved from Rome to an "ex
traterritorial camp" that would
be established in Haifa. Israel.
Negative attitudes
The emigrants must stay in the
Rome center for several weeks
before their papers can be pro
cessed anyway, he said.and if the
camp was in Haifa they could get
"a taste of Israel" that might per
suade some to change their nega
tive attitudes about living there.
Many Soviet Jews oppose anv
attempts to discourage them
from emigrating to the United
States, of course. But others
want to go much further than
Lerner in discouraging the emig
rants from going anywhere but
Israel. They would cut oft out

side support completely lor
Sov ict Jews going to anv country
other than Israel.
It was widely believed here
that the authorities planned to
force prominent activists out ol
the capital this summer, but as it
has turned out. there apparently
will be no need lor coercion.
MOSCOW — The sharp
slowdown in Jewish emigration
'ffom the Soviet Union, which
has eut the exodus so tar this year
tii two-thirds that of the compar
able period ol I 979. has also ag
gravated divisions among ac
tivists here over the "dropouts'
problem.
"Dropouts" are Jewish emig
rants who do not go to Israel but
settle in the United States or
other Western countries. The
vast majority were allowed to
emigrate only alter having said,
as required bv So\ iet authorities,
that they were going to rejoin
relatives in Israel.
In tact, however, about two
out of three ol the record 51.000
who left last year did not go to
Israel. They "dropped out" in
Vienna — their first Western
way station after lea\ ing the
Soviet Union — and went
elsewhere.
Some Jewish "refuseniks" —
activists who ha\e been refused
permission to leave — have long
reproached the "dropouts" in
private. But now they are doing
it openly, and the number who
share their views appears to be
growing. Some have spoken bit
terly in recent weeks to Ameri
