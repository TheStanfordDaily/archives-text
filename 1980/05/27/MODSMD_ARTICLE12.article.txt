# Drought causes Ugandan famine

KAMPAFA — People are
dying of hunger at the rate ot at
least 100 a day in the Karamoja
region of northeast Uganda
where some 140.000 people face
a similar fate, and relief organi
zations are struggling to provide
sufficient emergency food.
Fast weekend at Moroto. the
principal Karamoja town, both
the Catholic mission and the
local Red Cross headquarters had
no food with which to feed more
than 2000 hunger-driven people
waiting in huddled groups. The
last food arrived almost three
weeks ago.
Young children were rooting
around the ground searching lor
grass seeds to eat.
In southern Uganda attention

has been diverted away from the
tragedy in Karamoja bv the im
minent return announced for
today of former President Milton
Obote after a nine-year exile in
Tanzania.
The six-man military commis
sion which two weeks ago seized
power has not yet begun to deal
with the region's problems of
drought and widespread cattle
stealing, which have brought
starvation, fear and dire po\ erty.
Drought
lour million people across
northern Uganda — almost a
third of the country's population
— are suffering the effects of the
drought. Ol these. 250.000 are
"seriously affected." according
'to the United Nations' world
food program representative in
Uganda Francesco Strippoli.
lUirdcst hit have been
300.000 cattle-raising
Karamajong tribesmen who
have always relied on their herds
to supply them with a diet of milk
and blood, and have never been
traditional cultivators of grain
crops.
In any case, nearly three years
ot drought and hist year's libera
tion war which disrupted the
planting season have emptied
granaries.
Food stolen
To ensure peoples' survival in
the region, an estimated monthly
minimum ol 1500 tons of t>rain is

needed. Uganda sources say only
800 tons of food have been sent
to karamoja by relief organiza
tions since the beginning of the
year.
Coupled with a general shor
tage of food in East Africa lias
been Uganda's chronic political
insecurity and a shortage of vehi
cles to supply the region, which is
more than 300 miles from Kam
pala. The United Nations de
velopment program in Uganda
has lust more than.so trucks and
ears hijacked or stolen at gun
point.
The situation of karamajong
refugees who have struggled to
make their way to Moroto in
search of food is desperate. The
lirst to die have been children
under 5. some of whom have
eaten hard, dry cow peas.
Brought three weeks ago.
supplies of these have since been
exhausted.
Although the drought ended
when rains began five weeks ago.
it will be at least three months
before newly planted corn and
sorghum can be harvested.
Relief' critical
"The next4s to 60 days will be
critical in the relief operation it
thousands more people are not
to die," said one Red Cross ob
server who went to Moroto.
•"But it looks especially bad lor
the children. Cow peas are indi

gestible eaten dry and uncooked
by children in this malnourished
condition." she added.
A Church of Uganda official
said that since January, an aver
age of less than five pounds of
food per person had reached the
area.
Trucks carrying food had been
hijacked, sacks of food stolen
while en route and statistics of
food deliveries were "inaccurate
and confusing," he said. Some
supply trucks have armed sol
diers aboard in ease of raids on
convoys by bandits.
Cattle stolen
More than three-quarters ot
karamoja's estimated cattle
population of about 400.000 is
believed to have been stolen by
raiders armed with automatic
rifles and grenades taken from
the Morotor armory after it was
abandoned by Idi Amin's fleeing
soldiers last year.
Thousands of cattle are be- j
hexed to ha\ e been taken across
Uganda's borders into kenya
and Sudan for sale.
At night the \ illage of katakwi
in the neighboring Teso region,
cattle herders bring their animals
close to the 16-man police pox
for protection. ()ne police officer"""
there said on the previous night,
raiders shot dead three women at
a village three miles away and
stole 600 cattle.
