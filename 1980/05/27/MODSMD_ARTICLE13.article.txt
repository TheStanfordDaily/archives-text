# May move tests to another island
## French nukes damage South Pacific 
### Thomas O'Toole Kevin Klose The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — France has so badly
damaged parts of the South Pacific atoll of
Mururoa where it conducts its underground
nuclear weapons tests that it may be forced to
move the tests to another island in French
Polynesia as early as next year.
No decision has been made by France to
abandon Mururoa but nuclear weapons
sources in the United States and in France
have said that test holes are already being
drilled in the nearby atoll of Fanga Taufa to
see if it can accommodate weapons testing.
France conducted its first two underground
tests at Fanga Taufa in 1975 before moving
the tests to Mururoa.
Sources said the 29 nuclear weapons that
France has exploded in the last four years
under Mururoa have left the island "looking
like a Swiss cheese."
Test holes have been drilled under the 60-
feet-deep lagoon as far down as one mile into
the volcanic rock that underlies the coral
and-limestone atoll. The French have not
said when the first test will take place under
the lagoon but it could come in 1 98 1.
France never announces a nuclear
weapons test and never confirms one after it

takes place. France simply acknowledges
that it conducts occasional tests.
Secrets
Even the number of explosions France has
conducted in Polynesia are supposed to be
secret, but U.S. sources place them at 31, two
at Fanga Taufa and 29 at Mururoa.
France also keeps secret the size of its
tests, most of which it insists are under 20
kilotons. Sources say that most French tests
are engineered to miniaturize their weapons
so they can be more easily carried by missiles
and aircraft.
The last large French test was understood
to be the 200 kiloton test of July 24, 1979,
which triggered a small tidal wave the French
newspaper Le Matin said happened when the
weapon stuck half-way down the 800-meter
deep shaft leading to the test pit and was fired
in that position.
While admitting the explosion set off a
mini-tidal wave. French sources denied that
the weapon was stuck and denied the explo
sion took place half-way down the shaft.
Accident
One source said the explosion set off an
underground landslide of limestone, which
lay above the volcanic rock where the
weapon was exploded. The source freely
admitted that the limestone may have been

loosened by previous blasting.
In any case, the earthslide occurred three
or four hours after the explosion when
French test personnel had emerged from
bunkers where they stay during a test.
Less than three weeks before the tidal
wave incident, there was an accident on
Mururoa involving the handling of
plutonium used to make the French explo
sives. French sources said an electric drill
used to machine the plutonium set off a spark
that triggered an explosive chemical fire that
killed two workmen.
"It was a stupid accident," one French
source said, "but had nothing to do with nuc
lear testing."
Radioactive release
New Zealand newspapers have said that
the explosion that triggered the tidal wave
also vented dangerous amounts of radioac
tivity into the atmosphere, which French
souces also denied.
One source said that most testing on
Mururoa takes place in pits about two-thirds
of a mile down, which he said is deeper than
the U.S. tests in Nevada and is more than
deep enough to prevent venting. The source
said that bubbles of radioactive gas often
escape but insisted they are so small and
dissipate so rapidly in the atmosphere that
they present no threat to the environment.
