## Poor kids learn to play a rich man's game 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
They come to the courts in
street clothes, some even lacking
tennis shoes. They tote radios
and dance to the music as they
walk, talk and play.
The battered rackets and dead
balls they have to use don't dam
pen their appetite to learn to play
the country club game of tennis.
They are middle school stu
dents, grades 5-8, in the
Ravenswood City School Dis
trict of East Palo Alto, and
thanks to a 26-year-old Stanford
graduate and other students
here, they can now participate in
a year-round tennis program at
no personal expense.
"Among low socioeconomic
areas, tennis is the main sport
they want to learn," said Jake
Warde, a "76 Stanford graduate
and present tennis coach of De
Anza College. "There's a need
for a tennis program in the com
munity and it has not been im
plemented in the regular athletic
curriculum."
So in 1978 Warde started a
small tennis league with the fi
nancial aid of the Mid-Peninsula
Tennis Patrons. Now. tennis
classes are taught one day a week
and two city-wide junior tour
naments are held in the winter.
Four college students help im
plement the spring tennis league,
and summer afternoons the

Ravenswood students can play
tennis at Belle Haven Commun
ity Center and Ravenswood
High School.
On a windy day in May, seven
black students, most of them
female, saunter over to the
courts at the now-deserted
Ravenswood High School. They
choose from gripless, splintered
rackets, some with broken
strings that were donated by
tennis patrons it» the area. Al
though the rackets were dis
carded as unusuable by their
original owners, the students
clamor to find their "favorite."
Their coach is Karen Bloom, a
Stanford junior. She has Billie
Jean's determination, Chrissy's
peaches 'n' cream and Tracy's
warmth and friendly approach.
Hut there was a time when she
did not feci so comfortable with
the team.
She recalled the first time she
ventured into East Palo Alto to
find Brentwood Oaks, where her
team goes to school.
"I went in my little white ten
nis skirt." said Bloom, who now
wears gytr shorts and a sweat
shirt to the twice a week practice
sessions.", i lot of the older boys
at the school hassled me, hut
some asked if I was the new ten
nis teacher and when 1 said yes,
they started following me.
"By the time 1 got to the prin
cipal's office, I had a whole
parade with me," she said.

"That's what 1 love most about
coaching these kids. They're
eager, they want to learn and
they're extremely honest —
sometimes too honest. They
never call balls out in matches,
and when opponents don't know
how to serve, the kids let them
stand up close and hit it over."
Obviously, though, it hasn't
been a major problem for
Bloom, whose team won the
league competition between
Belle Haven School, Kavanaugh
Oaks School, Willow Oaks
School and Brentwood Oaks
School.
Bloom said she was concerned
that her team was getting a false
sense of pride when they won all
their weekly league matches. To
counter that problem she en
listed a more advanced team that
was composed of all white stu
dents, to play against them.
Her team lost badly.
"It kind of reinforced that
whites are good and blacks are
bad." she said. "But the good
thing is that I'm the only woman
coach and in a sense, I'm a role
model. My girls are the best in
the league. What would be ideal
is if I were a black woman."
Warde said during the black
white match, one of the black
boys on the Ravenswood team
went out on the court to play a
girl and said. "I'm gonna whip
her ass."
"After the warm up, he turned

to me and said 'Maybe 1 won't.'"
Warde laughed.
He said the match was not a
very competitive situation and
the loss gave the students some
insight as to how much they
could improve.
Attention span is a problem,
according to Bloom. At a regular
hour and a halt practice it is not
uncommon for some older boys
to come by the courts. Often the
eighth grade girls walk off to talk
to them or make arrangements
to get together later.
"It poses a conflict," Bloom
said. "You want everyone to
come but you have to be firm,
too. Do you stick to the rules and
be really strict or be loose and
risk poor organization?"
Warde said the reason there
aren't more boys on the team is
"there's still a stereotype about
tennis in terms of its masculinity.
"The traditional sports of
baseball, basketball and football
are offered to boys so they al
ready have their sports." he said.
But the girls have no problem
identifying with male role mod
els. When Bloom brings them to
Stanford to see the tennis
matches, her entire team cheers
for the Cardinals' No. 3 netman.
Lloyd Bourne.
"They're a bit lacking in court
etiquette," Bloom said. "Some
times I have to remind them to
keep quiet."
In addition to practicing phys

ical drills, league participants re
ceive a manual Warde wrote ti
tled You are the Pro. The hook
contains 20 games to play with a
racket and hall. I ach is designed
to introduce a new tennis skill.
The program operates on a
budget ol $6400 a year, contri
buted by Raychcm Corp., the
Packard Foundation. Kiwanis
Club of Menlo Park and
Ravenswood City School Dis
trict.
Sometimes the students don't
show up for practice. Warde
explained. "One thing I've
noticed in the kids is that il
there's no continuity, they lose
interest."
He said Ins main criteria for
coach selection is dependability.
He said he found his coaches.

"The kids don't like to be let
down," Warde said. "It's some
thing they've been subjected to
and they'll retaliate by not show
ing up."
Sometimes, though, they show
up with extras — snacks are
common and many bring baby
brothers and sisters to watch or
plav along.
That's fine, according to
Bloom.
"I have a policy," she said.
"I'm here for them. I never turn
anyone away."

Warde said the reason there

"there's still a stereotype about

"The kids don't like to be let

Sometimes, though, they show

Bloom.

thanks to a 26-year-old Stanford

here, they can now participate in
a year-round tennis program at
no personal expense.
"Among low socioeconomic
areas, tennis is the main sport
they want to learn," said Jake
Warde, a "76 Stanford graduate
and present tennis coach of De
Anza College. "There's a need
for a tennis program in the com
munity and it has not been im
plemented in the regular athletic
curriculum."
So in 1978 Warde started a
small tennis league with the fi
nancial aid of the Mid-Peninsula
Tennis Patrons. Now. tennis
classes are taught one day a week
and two city-wide junior tour
naments are held in the winter.
Four college students help im

and summer afternoons the

Ravenswood students can play
tennis at Belle Haven Commun
ity Center and Ravenswood
High School.
On a windy day in May, seven
black students, most of them
female, saunter over to the
courts at the now-deserted
Ravenswood High School. They
choose from gripless, splintered
rackets, some with broken
strings that were donated by
tennis patrons it» the area. Al
though the rackets were dis
carded as unusuable by their
original owners, the students
clamor to find their "favorite."
Their coach is Karen Bloom, a
Stanford junior. She has Billie
Jean's determination, Chrissy's
peaches 'n' cream and Tracy's
warmth and friendly approach.
Hut there was a time when she
did not feci so comfortable with
the team.
She recalled the first time she
ventured into East Palo Alto to
find Brentwood Oaks, where her
team goes to school.
"I went in my little white ten
nis skirt." said Bloom, who now
wears gytr shorts and a sweat
shirt to the twice a week practice
sessions.", i lot of the older boys
at the school hassled me, hut
some asked if I was the new ten
nis teacher and when 1 said yes,
they started following me.
"By the time 1 got to the prin
cipal's office, I had a whole
parade with me," she said.

"That's what 1 love most about
coaching these kids. They're
eager, they want to learn and
they're extremely honest —
sometimes too honest. They
never call balls out in matches,
and when opponents don't know
how to serve, the kids let them
stand up close and hit it over."
Obviously, though, it hasn't
been a major problem for
Bloom, whose team won the
league competition between
Belle Haven School, Kavanaugh
Oaks School, Willow Oaks
School and Brentwood Oaks
School.
Bloom said she was concerned
that her team was getting a false
sense of pride when they won all
their weekly league matches. To
counter that problem she en
listed a more advanced team that
was composed of all white stu
dents, to play against them.
Her team lost badly.
"It kind of reinforced that
whites are good and blacks are
bad." she said. "But the good
thing is that I'm the only woman
coach and in a sense, I'm a role
model. My girls are the best in
the league. What would be ideal
is if I were a black woman."
Warde said during the black
white match, one of the black
boys on the Ravenswood team
went out on the court to play a
girl and said. "I'm gonna whip
her ass."
"After the warm up, he turned

to me and said 'Maybe 1 won't.'"
Warde laughed.
He said the match was not a
very competitive situation and
the loss gave the students some
insight as to how much they
could improve.
Attention span is a problem,
according to Bloom. At a regular
hour and a halt practice it is not
uncommon for some older boys
to come by the courts. Often the
eighth grade girls walk off to talk
to them or make arrangements
to get together later.
"It poses a conflict," Bloom
