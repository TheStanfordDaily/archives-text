# State schools may charge tuition
## 
### Don F. Speich The Los Angeles Times 
SACRAMENTO — For the
first time in California history,
educational policymakers in Sac
ramento are talking seriously
about across-the-board tuition
at the board tuition at the Uni
versity of California, the state
University and Colleges and the
two-year community colleges.
The talk, much of it private
and most of it reluctant, repre
sents a dramatic shift in senti
ment, particularly in the Legisla
ture, which in the past has re
fused even to discuss tuition.
The problem is money. Many
fiscal and education policy
analysts think the state is on the
brink of an unprecedented fi
nancial crunch. The once bounti
ful state surplus — which has al
lowed both the Legislature and
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to
avoid making serious cuts in
higher education budgets since
the passage of Proposition 13
which slashed property taxes —
is dwindling.
Now there is Proposition <•),
the June 3 initiative that would
cut income taxes b\ as much as
50 percent.
If the surplus continues to
shrink^ deep cuts will have to be
made in higher education
budgets. And, according to legis
lators and fiscal experts inter

viewed by the Los Angeles
Times, tuition will be one way to
help pay for educational prog
rams now financed by the state.
Adding substance to the talk
about tuition is a tuition
"model." developed in the last
few months by the California
Postsecondary Education Com
mission, which advises both the
Legislature and the executive
branch.
The model shows that tuition
would result in a loss in enroll
ment in all three segments, with
the si/e of the loss growing as the
amount of tuition increases.
However, at no point do the state
allocations that a system loses
because of shrinking enrollment
equal the amount raised through
tuition. It is a finding that seems
certain to aid arguments in favor
of tuition.
Tuition-free higher education
has been a fiercely protected
concept in California lor de
cades. Indeed, it is a cornerstone
of California's Master Plan for
Higher Education, the 196(1 pol
icy blueprint that sets forth the
missions of each of the state's
three segments and guarantees
a seat in one of the state's univer
sities or colleges for every resi
dent ol the. state.
Accompanying the guarantee
is an underlying philosophy that
the state, not the students.

should provide for the cost of in
struction. Thus, tuition, which by
definition is a fee levied to pay
for instruction, was to be av
oided.
Now, however, virtually all of
the educational policy advisers
to the Legislature and the Brown
administration feel that tuition
across the board in higher educa
tion is entirely possible, perhaps
as soon as 1 9X I.
Sharing this view, in varying
degrees, are state Sen. Albert S.
Rodda and Assemblymen John
Vasconcellos and Gary Hart,
generally considered the three
most influential legislators in the
area of educational policy. All
have steadfastly opposed tuition
up to now.
Both UC and state university
officials believe that tuition is a
distinct possibility even if Prop
osition 9 fails.
Community College Chancel
lor Gerald C". Hayward remains a
staunch opponent of the idea,
but he said in a reaept interview,
"There is noquestion in my mind
that the tuition issue will be more
carefully looked at and hotly de
bated than at any time in the his
tory of the state."
In 1 970. the UC Board of Re
gents — dominated by appoin
tees of Gov. Ronald Reagan,
who favored increased student
fees — considered tuition. How
ever. in the face of substantial
opposition from within the uni
\ersity as well as from key legis
lators. such as Rodda. the re
gents chose instead to institute
an "education fee." The fee, ini
tialls $50 a year, is now $300.
Over the years the education
fee has been used to pay for such
things as construction and stu
dent financial aid — but never to
pay tor the cost of instruction.
During the early 1970'5, the
state University and Colleges
Board of Trustees, also then
dominated by Reagan appoin
tees. sought authorization from

the Legislature to impose tui
tion. The Legislature refused to
even discuss the idea. Both the
university trustees and tht;«com
munity college hoard of gover
nors must have the approval of
the Legislature and the governor
to impose tuition.
But that would be difficult
without the blessing of both the
Legislature and the executive
branch of government because
they control the amount of
money the university receives
each year for programs and
salaries. The lawmakers have
used that control to discourage
talk within UC about the need
for tuition.
But the climate has changed. If
Proposition 9 is approved by
voters June 3, fiscal experts in
Sacramento say the only ques
tion is whether tuition in at least
some of the segments would be
implemented this year or next.
And officials at both UC and
the state university system say
that it their proposed budgets are
cut by 5 percent or more they
probably will be forced to im
plement tuition if they can get
the authorization.
Whether either the regents or
trustees would approve tuition in
these circumstances is another
matter. However, influential re
gents and trustees interviewed
by 7'he Times said they would
resist the fee even if Proposition
9 passes.
There are options open to
higher education officials that
could make tuition unnecessary
or at least reduce the amount
that might be otherwise re
quired.
Some education policymakers
in Sacramento suggest increasing
the classroom workload of fa
culty members or eliminating
such things as sabbatical leaves
— a combination of which could
produce millions of dollars in
savings, according to some.

for instruction, was to be av
oided.
Now, however, virtually all of
the educational policy advisers
to the Legislature and the Brown
administration feel that tuition
across the board in higher educa
tion is entirely possible, perhaps
as soon as 1 9X I.
Sharing this view, in varying
degrees, are state Sen. Albert S.
Rodda and Assemblymen John
Vasconcellos and Gary Hart,
generally considered the three
most influential legislators in the
area of educational policy. All
have steadfastly opposed tuition
up to now.
Both UC and state university
officials believe that tuition is a
distinct possibility even if Prop
osition 9 fails.
Community College Chancel
lor Gerald C". Hayward remains a
staunch opponent of the idea,
but he said in a reaept interview,
"There is noquestion in my mind
that the tuition issue will be more
carefully looked at and hotly de
bated than at any time in the his
tory of the state."
In 1 970. the UC Board of Re
gents — dominated by appoin
tees of Gov. Ronald Reagan,
who favored increased student
fees — considered tuition. How
ever. in the face of substantial
opposition from within the uni
\ersity as well as from key legis
lators. such as Rodda. the re
gents chose instead to institute
an "education fee." The fee, ini
tialls $50 a year, is now $300.
Over the years the education
fee has been used to pay for such
things as construction and stu
dent financial aid — but never to
pay tor the cost of instruction.
During the early 1970'5, the
state University and Colleges
Board of Trustees, also then
dominated by Reagan appoin
tees. sought authorization from

the Legislature to impose tui
tion. The Legislature refused to
even discuss the idea. Both the
university trustees and tht;«com
munity college hoard of gover
nors must have the approval of
the Legislature and the governor
to impose tuition.
But that would be difficult
without the blessing of both the
Legislature and the executive
branch of government because
they control the amount of
money the university receives
each year for programs and
salaries. The lawmakers have
used that control to discourage
talk within UC about the need
for tuition.
But the climate has changed. If
Proposition 9 is approved by
voters June 3, fiscal experts in
Sacramento say the only ques
tion is whether tuition in at least
some of the segments would be
implemented this year or next.
And officials at both UC and
the state university system say
that it their proposed budgets are
cut by 5 percent or more they
probably will be forced to im
plement tuition if they can get
the authorization.
Whether either the regents or
trustees would approve tuition in
these circumstances is another
matter. However, influential re
gents and trustees interviewed
by 7'he Times said they would
resist the fee even if Proposition
9 passes.
There are options open to
higher education officials that
could make tuition unnecessary
or at least reduce the amount
that might be otherwise re
quired.
Some education policymakers
in Sacramento suggest increasing
the classroom workload of fa
culty members or eliminating
such things as sabbatical leaves
— a combination of which could

SACRAMENTO — For the
first time in California history,
educational policymakers in Sac
ramento are talking seriously
about across-the-board tuition
at the board tuition at the Uni
versity of California, the state
University and Colleges and the
two-year community colleges.
The talk, much of it private
and most of it reluctant, repre
sents a dramatic shift in senti
ment, particularly in the Legisla
ture, which in the past has re
fused even to discuss tuition.
The problem is money. Many
fiscal and education policy
analysts think the state is on the
brink of an unprecedented fi
nancial crunch. The once bounti
ful state surplus — which has al
lowed both the Legislature and
Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to
avoid making serious cuts in
higher education budgets since
the passage of Proposition 13
which slashed property taxes —
is dwindling.
Now there is Proposition <•),
the June 3 initiative that would
cut income taxes b\ as much as
50 percent.
If the surplus continues to
shrink^ deep cuts will have to be
made in higher education
budgets. And, according to legis
lators and fiscal experts inter

viewed by the Los Angeles
Times, tuition will be one way to
help pay for educational prog
rams now financed by the state.
Adding substance to the talk
about tuition is a tuition
"model." developed in the last
few months by the California
Postsecondary Education Com
mission, which advises both the
Legislature and the executive
branch.
The model shows that tuition
would result in a loss in enroll
ment in all three segments, with
the si/e of the loss growing as the
amount of tuition increases.
However, at no point do the state
allocations that a system loses
because of shrinking enrollment
equal the amount raised through
tuition. It is a finding that seems
certain to aid arguments in favor
of tuition.
Tuition-free higher education
has been a fiercely protected
concept in California lor de
cades. Indeed, it is a cornerstone
of California's Master Plan for
Higher Education, the 196(1 pol
icy blueprint that sets forth the
missions of each of the state's
three segments and guarantees
a seat in one of the state's univer
sities or colleges for every resi
dent ol the. state.
Accompanying the guarantee
is an underlying philosophy that
the state, not the students.

should provide for the cost of in
struction. Thus, tuition, which by
