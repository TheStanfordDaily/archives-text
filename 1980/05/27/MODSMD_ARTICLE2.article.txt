# Faculty petitioned for support
## Amnesty Int'l works to free death row 
### Susan Hajda Staff Writer 
Memorial Day officially is a time to
honor those whovaliantly died in battle
for their country. Yesterday, however,
members of Amnesty International, a
worldwide human rights organization,
were not quietly reflecting on distant
wars. Instead, they were lighting to
help those still alive — but on death
row.
Amnesty International asked Presi
dent Jimmy Carter to establish a presi
dential commission to study the death
penalty in the United States. The or
ganization asked for a moratorium on
executions, which it feels violates the

nation's commitment to human rights,
until the proposed commission reports
its findings.
In a petition st;nt to 250 University
faculty members, the Stanford chapter
of Amnesty International urged the re
cipients to support the creation of a
presidential commission on capital
punishment. The organization believes
the commission would remove the cap
ital punishment issue from the political
and emotional climate which now sur
rounds it.
The local chapter, which has about
50 members, said it had received a re
sponse from 1 0 percent of the Stanford
faculty.

Kathy coordinator ol
the Stanford group's appeal for estab
lishment ol the commission, said. "We
have our hopes in Carter because he set
up all those human rights commis
sions."
According to Amnesty Interna
tional. nearly 40 states have death pen
alty statutes for murder and for rape.
More than 640 people are currently on
death row in'the United States and
each month 10 more are sentenced to
death. Three people have been put to
death since executions were resumed in
10 years after the last execution
had taken place.
The organization, a recipient of the

1977 Nobel Peacc Pri/e, calls for the
"unconditional and immediate aboli
tion of the dealth penalty by all coun
tries and states throughout the world."
It maintains that the death penalty \ io
lates the human right to life and protec
tion from cruel and inhuman punish
ment.
Amnesty International questions the
deterrent value of the death penalty,
the adequacy of legal defense in mur
der trials and discrimination in its im
position. The group says nearly half of
the persons on death row today are
black, hispanic, native American, or
oriental.
Horisberger said the petition is one
of the Stanford group's activities.
"Our main activity is Urgent Ac
tion." she said. Urgent Action cases are
channeled from Amnesty Internation
al's Secretariat in London throughout
the Amnesty movement. The members
send letters and telegrams to govern
ment officials around the world on be
half of prisoners. In many cases, there
is fear that the prisoner is being tor
tured or in critical need of medical at
tention.
"We have a good percentage of suc
cess in the Urgent Action cases,"
Horisberger said. Amnesty Interna
tional says that in nearly half of the
Urgent Action cases in 1977. the indi
\ idual's situation improved. According
to the organization, "this means that
torture stopped, death sentences were
commuted, disappeared prisoners
were located, medical treatment was
administered . . . and prisoners were
released."
Memorial services were also held
Sunday in Florida on the anniversary of
convicted murderer John Spenkelink's
execution. Amnesty International
claims that Spenkelink, who violently
protested his sentence, did not receive
adequate defense for his trial. Accord
ing to the National Coalition Against
the Death Penalty, his court-appointed
attorneys were insufficiently prepared.
"One publicly stated that the case was
beyond his competence. One was ab
sent during part of the jury selection to
be with his wife in childbirth."
Amnesty International believes the
establishment of a presidential com
mission on the death penalty would re
veal these cases to the public, and pro
vide information for the United Na
tions. The death penalty is one of the
main items on the agenda of the U.N.
Congress on the Prevention of Crime
and the Treatment of Offenders which
meets in August in Venezuela. It will
also be on the agenda of the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly this fall.

attorneys were insufficiently prepared.
"One publicly stated that the case was
beyond his competence. One was ab
sent during part of the jury selection to
be with his wife in childbirth."
Amnesty International believes the
establishment of a presidential com
mission on the death penalty would re
veal these cases to the public, and pro
vide information for the United Na
tions. The death penalty is one of the
main items on the agenda of the U.N.
Congress on the Prevention of Crime
and the Treatment of Offenders which
meets in August in Venezuela. It will
also be on the agenda of the U.N. Gen
eral Assembly this fall.
Memorial Day officially is a time to
honor those whovaliantly died in battle
for their country. Yesterday, however,
members of Amnesty International, a
worldwide human rights organization,
were not quietly reflecting on distant
wars. Instead, they were lighting to
help those still alive — but on death
row.
Amnesty International asked Presi
dent Jimmy Carter to establish a presi
dential commission to study the death
penalty in the United States. The or
ganization asked for a moratorium on
executions, which it feels violates the

nation's commitment to human rights,
until the proposed commission reports
its findings.
In a petition st;nt to 250 University
faculty members, the Stanford chapter
of Amnesty International urged the re
cipients to support the creation of a
presidential commission on capital
punishment. The organization believes
the commission would remove the cap
ital punishment issue from the political
and emotional climate which now sur
rounds it.
The local chapter, which has about
50 members, said it had received a re
sponse from 1 0 percent of the Stanford
faculty.

Kathy coordinator ol
the Stanford group's appeal for estab
lishment ol the commission, said. "We
have our hopes in Carter because he set
up all those human rights commis
sions."
According to Amnesty Interna
tional. nearly 40 states have death pen
alty statutes for murder and for rape.
More than 640 people are currently on
death row in'the United States and
each month 10 more are sentenced to
death. Three people have been put to
death since executions were resumed in
10 years after the last execution
had taken place.
The organization, a recipient of the

1977 Nobel Peacc Pri/e, calls for the
"unconditional and immediate aboli
tion of the dealth penalty by all coun
tries and states throughout the world."
It maintains that the death penalty \ io
lates the human right to life and protec
tion from cruel and inhuman punish
ment.
Amnesty International questions the
deterrent value of the death penalty,
the adequacy of legal defense in mur
der trials and discrimination in its im
position. The group says nearly half of
the persons on death row today are
black, hispanic, native American, or
oriental.
Horisberger said the petition is one
of the Stanford group's activities.
"Our main activity is Urgent Ac
tion." she said. Urgent Action cases are
channeled from Amnesty Internation
al's Secretariat in London throughout
the Amnesty movement. The members
send letters and telegrams to govern
ment officials around the world on be
half of prisoners. In many cases, there
is fear that the prisoner is being tor
tured or in critical need of medical at
tention.
"We have a good percentage of suc
cess in the Urgent Action cases,"
Horisberger said. Amnesty Interna
tional says that in nearly half of the
Urgent Action cases in 1977. the indi
\ idual's situation improved. According
to the organization, "this means that
torture stopped, death sentences were
commuted, disappeared prisoners
were located, medical treatment was
administered . . . and prisoners were
released."
Memorial services were also held
Sunday in Florida on the anniversary of
convicted murderer John Spenkelink's
execution. Amnesty International
claims that Spenkelink, who violently
protested his sentence, did not receive
adequate defense for his trial. Accord
ing to the National Coalition Against
the Death Penalty, his court-appointed
attorneys were insufficiently prepared.
"One publicly stated that the case was
beyond his competence. One was ab
sent during part of the jury selection to
be with his wife in childbirth."
Amnesty International believes the
establishment of a presidential com
mission on the death penalty would re
veal these cases to the public, and pro
vide information for the United Na
tions. The death penalty is one of the
main items on the agenda of the U.N.
Congress on the Prevention of Crime
and the Treatment of Offenders which
