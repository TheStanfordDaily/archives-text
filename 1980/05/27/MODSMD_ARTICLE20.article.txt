### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Students concerned with the
fate of the happy clown logo Jack
in the Box restaurants are blow
ing up across the country via na
tional television advertising,
have formed a coalition to stop
the violent advertising ploy.
'We're doing this because we
think it's horrible that the corpo
ration. Ralston-Purina. is vio
lently destroying Jacks and we
want to rally support to preserve
this cherished bit of
Americana." said junior Brenda
Watson, co-founder and eo
chair ol the organization. Jesters
Against Clown Killing (JACK).
The group met Thursday night
at Roble Hall to establish com
mittees and their functions and
to seek input from other con
cerned students here. About 50
students signed the registration
list.
Four committees emerged
from the meeting. The
Stormtroopers will frequent
local Box restaurants with the in
tent to revive the clown. The
Capitalist Expansion Committee
will be in charge of monitoring
and encouraging the growth of
materials and activities to other
committees. Special Programs
plans to leaflet White Plaza this
week and the Ministry of Prop
aganda is currently writing let

ters to Ralston-Purina, printing
leaflets and designing bumper
stickers.
"We think people are going to
feel a sense of loss when they
drise up to the box and there's no
smiling Jack there to greet
them," Watson said. "The cor
porate establishment is using
adolescent puppets to satisfy its
whims â€” the whims of exploding
Jacks on national television."
Watson, who has never been
an employee of Jack in the Box
restaurants, sported a Jack in the
Box shirt at the meeting. She de
clined to say how she obtained
the souvenir.
Watson's co-founders and
co-chairs are junior Brad Heinz
and senior John Syka.
Heinz said the sexual connota
tions of calling the restaurant
chain The Box is "sort of re
miniscent of'the can.'"
Among those present were
ASSU Sen. Mike O'Reilly and
Roble Hall President Eric
Hamilton.
In the middle of the JACK
meeting, an unnamed counter
movement bombarded the pre
mises with water balloons. A
spokesman for the anonymous
group would not disclose its
next plan of action.
