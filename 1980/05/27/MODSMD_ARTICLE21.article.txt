# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editors perspective New Daily news policy 
### 
The Daily last published a news policy in
the early 19705. Since then, times have
changed, and so has the law. We are pub
lishing the new policy stated below, after
consultation with attorneys and experts in
media law. and after approval by The Stan
ford Daily Publishing Corporation Board
of Directors. The policy brings together all
past relevent policies and current procee
dures into a single, coherent statement of
policy regarding our most important func
tion. the gathering and publishing of new s.
For the most part, the policy is so 11
explanatory. But. in order to call your at
tention to the most important sections of
the policy, I would like to direct you to
paragraph 2. in which we state that all
meetings or other assemblies ad\ ertised as
being open to the public will be treated as
such. We will not allow participants at such
meetings to "close" the meetings after they
have begun. Nor will we accept any
speaker's request to speak "off the record"

at such an open uieeting.
Our reporters will abide only by orders
from law enforcement officials when asked
to leave any meetings. Persons who \ iolate
this policy are subject to University sanc
tions (see page 8 of the Public Events Pol
icy and Practice Manual). The University
has requested that \ iolations of this policy
be reported, and we will do so. Any at
tempts to interfere with or intimidate a
Daily staff member at an open meeting or
during the course of his or her duties will be
treated as stated in paragraph 3.
As we will abide by the law in allfacitsof
production and publication of this news
paper. so too do we expect others to follow
the law when dealing with this newspaper
and its staff members. I hope that you will
read this policy statement and call me it
you ha\e any questions.
