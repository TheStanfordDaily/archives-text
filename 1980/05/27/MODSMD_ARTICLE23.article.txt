Free speech here?
The Stun ford Daily is quick to
object to Mary Daly's pri\ ileging
the right of women over men to
speak at a meeting about wo
men's oppression, since general
student tees supported the meet
ing. (May 2 1)
Let those who object that this
is "taxation without representa
tion" reflect that women are re
quired to pay taxes to the U.S.
government, but that the U.S.
Constitution, in which the First
Amendment presumably
guarantees freedom ol speech to
all citizens, omits feminine pro
nouns. along with any reference
at all to women. Male legisla
tures still refuse to pass the
Equal Rights Amendment. Do
women have freedom of speech
in this country?
Women students pay the same
tuition as men at Stanford, but
because of blatant discrimina
tion in faculty hiring hear largely
male viewpoints in the clas
srooms. Do women ha\ e free
dom of speech in this university?
On one of the rare occasions
where women are assembled to
speak of our oppression, are we
to be lectured to that men are not
receiving fair treatment?

Women beware
There has been a lot ol talk
lately about the problems ol
frats. frat men. their sexism, and
the like. What about the guys
who live in the dorms? What
makes them so holy or so non
sexist?
Why are they so interested in
living in dorms? To learn about
life and about themselves? Come
on, "Get a clue!"
When you come right down to
it. these guys are no different
from frat men except 111 one area.
Men who choose to live in dorms
don't have the social resource
fulness to meet women in any
other way than to sit across from
them at a Food Service table.
First, make the dorms co-ed,
but no. that still doesn't make it
easy enough for some of the "en
lightened" and "open-minded"
avant-garde who want to get rid
of that last symbol ol our sexist

culture — that's right — the
single-sex bathroom.
Now that there has been a re
cent surge in sororities (Can you
blame the women?), the men in
the dorms are going through the
re\ erse-snobbery routine about
the inherent dangers ol elitism in
the Greek system. These guys'
biggest worry is the statement
"Today a sorority, tomorrow a
separate sorority house.'
But that won't happen for a
while. There will still be those
guys who want to live in a nice,
quiet, co-ed by corridor house,
say, like Cardenal. They will
have the keen foresight of put
ting it as their tirst choice on their
draw cards and most probably
waste perfectly good draw
numbers like 209 or 696. To
those who ha\ e entered the draw
I have but one message: "Let the
women beware!"

Try these myths
In his May 2(1 column. Scott
Olmsted dispels four myths
about libertarianism. These
myths are. to say the least, of
dubious origin. Here are four
myths which should prove only
slightly harder for libertarians to
dispel:
I ) Libertarians have green
skin and come from Mars.
2) Libertarians make great
basketball players (except tor
Canadian libertarians, who
make great hockey players).
3) All libertarians drive Fd
sels.
4) No libertarian ever passed
Economics 1.
Let's face it: there are at least
two differences which really dis
tinguish libertarians from the
rest of us mortals. The first is a
difference in values. In evaluat
ing social welfare, libertarians
apparently do not believe that
the needs ol the poor should he
weighed more heavily than the
needs of the rich. Thus, they re
ject the premise that redistribu
tion of income is a legitimate
function of government.
rhe second difference derives
from a superficial understanding
of how our economy functions.
Libertarians seem oblivious to

the pervasi\eness of market fai
lure. For example, their belief in
the market's ability to internalize
the costs of externalities like pol
lution fails to account for mea
surement difficulties, the "free
rider" problem and other
technicalities. To put it simply,
the market does not always func
tion perfectly: government in
ter\ention can and does help.
Columns such as Olmsted's,
which set up straw men with the
sole intent of knocking them
down, serve no purpose. Olm
sted and other libertarians would
be well advised to publish
thoroughly thought-out ideas.
This course of action would
promote meaningful intellectual
exchange instead of wasting col
umn space.

Response amuses
I am amused by the response
of Ned Beach and the Daily
Editorial Board to Mary Daly
(May 2 I). Though I did not hear
her this time, she refused ques
tions from men six years ago
when I first heard her.
Nowyo// feel like women ha' e
tor decades, even centuries. I
have sat at meetings, discussions
and speeches where the chair re
fused to recognize the women.
No one said that we couldn't ask
questions; we just couldn't get
recognized.
Our raised hands were ig
nored, we were shut off if it was a
discussidh by interruptions, if we
did get a chance to ask a question
or make a point, it was sloughed
off as unimportant or "interest
ing." but not worthy of a reac
tion.
I am happy that the men at
Stanford at last had the experi
ence that women through the
ages have had and still continue
to have. Perhaps you understand
on a feeling level as well as intel
lectual what women are request
ing when they ask for equal op
portunity.
