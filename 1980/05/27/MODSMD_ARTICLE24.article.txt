# Here ideas matter more than matter

My uncle, who is a devout
Roman Catholic and a gentle
Irish soul, recently asked me why
Marxism is so popular in
academia (compared to every
place else, he meant). He knows
I am not a Marxist, and he ex
pected a sympathetic and may he

even a reassuring answer. In
stead. he got a typically academic
shrug of the shoulders.
It's not as though the question
has never occurred to me. That a
doctrine with a balance sheet as
red as that of Marxism should
continue to be defended by some
ol the best and brightest people
in our society is a fact worth
thinking about.
One reason it is so defended is
that it pushed hard on the aim
less and generic sense of pity and
guilt that many people feel about
poor people. One is more vul
nerable to this appeal when sit
ting and reading in a comfortable
office or library than when tiring
oneself out working in a tannery.
Similarly. Marxism appeals to
the mean-spirited animus that
many have against the rich or
powerful. Sometimes this
animus is simply envy or resent

ment. Sometimes, especially in
academia. it is a sort of bitter
mischievousness, a kind of
slightly rarefied version of the
impulse to vandalism that de
rives adolescent delight in the
upsetting of delicate bourgeois
decorum. Sometimes, when the

Marxist himself descends from
the rich or powerful, the animus
becomes a disingenuous and so
cially irresponsible projection of
a guilt that he could not other
wise handle.
Sometimes the animus is
abetted by a lack of sympathy —
not just for the rich and power
ful. but for ordinary people with
different tastes from those com
mon in academia. Thus, the
campus is a frequent setting for
wistful dreams of u world in
which private property became
unimportant il not nonexistent,
in which people loved each other
and helped each other willingly.
Solidarity, community,
brotherhood and sisterhood —
these are terms that Marxists use
much more than most people I
know. And they are also notions
that appeal more to people in
academia than elsewhere. It is no

accident that an environment
that produces fraternities and
sororities should also produce
more than its share of Marxists.
Marxism appeals to those with
the courage to turn wistful
dreams into an active vision. For
the tedious compromises and
messy uncertainties of par
liamentary democracy, it substi
tutes a Romanic quest after its
holy grail. Equality. With its
promise of high adventure (the
Historical Process) and its de
mand of self-sacrifice. The Re
volution has replaced The
Crusade in the Western imagina
tion.
To be sure, Marx himself sup
ported this vision with a careful
science. And even today, by de
fining man by objective and ex
ternal criteria (namely, his class).
Marxists enable themselves to
engage in a sort of vectoral
analysis of the human condition.
Furthermore, Marxism is
based on the assumption —
which it shares with many
schools of thought — that most
of the time people act out of a
calculation of their best interests.
This "science" of human motiva
tion passes easily into a
thoroughgoing cynicism, in

which the idea is to show that, no
matter what motive the indi
vidual offers for his action, there
is an unconscious realm that pro
vides the true ke> to this motives.
The impulse toward this kind
of cynicism seems to me stronger
or at least more stylized in
academia than outside it. It is a
way of thinking characteristic ol
Freudianism, existentialism,
sociobiology and alas, much of
Christianity. And this is the final
reason for the popularity of
Marxism in academia: it gives
\ ital expression to a tradition of
psychological imperialism to
which Western intellectuals have
long been enamored.
Thus, dear Uncle, whereas
fascism was discredited by the
Hitler experience, Marxism
could withstand a hundred Sta
lins without being discredited.
For every generation of Malcolm
Muggeridges. there will be a
generation of Eldridge Cleavers
to replace them. It seems to be
one of the contradictions of
Marxism, so to speak, that it
flourishes more where ideas mat
ter than where matter does.
