## Palestinians want hatred, not peace 
### 
The Palestinian rally held here
May 15 was not a peaceful call
tor the creation of a Palestinian
state. It was a severe attack on
the existence and the right to
exist of the state ol Israel. The
opening phrase: "We are here to
mourn the creation ol Israel,
thirty-two years ago", as well as
the frequent use of the expres
sion "Palestinian holocaust"
were intended deliberately to
compare the so called Palesti
nian tragedy to the Jewish
Holocaust.
At the same time, the various
speakers used misleading infor
mation. thus forming a distorted
picture of the conflict and of Is
rael in general. It is important to
straighten out these "facts" and
to demonstrate that Israel is not
a "source of misery, human
rights violations, and a threat to
world peace!"
The first speaker claimed that
the Jewish state proposed by the
United Nations in its partition
plan was established on land
taken from the Palestinian
Arabs. This is flatly untrue! Only
19.8 percent of Palestine land
was owned by Arabs and H. 3
percent by Jews. The rest, more
than 70 percent, was owned by
the Mandate Authorities.
In fact, within the proposed
Jewish state. Jews were the vast
majority, and the Arab-owned
land was much less than the
Jewish-owned. Furthermore,
two-thirds of the proposed
Jewish state was in the southern
desert â€” the Negev. The Pales
tinian Arajts had never settled in
this area, yet claim this to be "an
Arab-stolen land."
Prior to the Jewish immigra
tion, Palestine was almost an
empty country. In 1922 only
185,000 Arabs and 80,000 Jews
populated the area which later
became the state of Israel. To

day. 3.85 million Jews and Arabs
live within the same previously
unsettled area. Tims, one really
has to distort reality in a very
original way in order to come up
with the myth about the "Zionist
imperialism."
Following this. Lee O'Brian
gave her speech, most of which
does not deserve any comment.
However. 1 will refer to the most
"humanitarian" sentence in her
talk claiming that the Palestinian
raid in Hebron on May 6 was
"targeted against right-wing
settlers of the Gush-Emunim
movement, who had conducted
numerous acts of anti-
Palestinian violence in recent
months." Excellent explanation!
Whether or not one is a sup
porter of Gush-Emunim and the
West Bank settlements in gen
eral (which I am not) it is hard to
conceive that any rational person
can understand or justify this
massacre, committed against
people walking unarmed to their
Sabbath prayers!
The following speaker, Al
Baadi, used the familiar
stereotypic distinction between
gocxl and bad. While all other so
called "liberation movements"
fall into the good group, Zionism,
the national liberation move
ment of the Jewish people, is
categorically bad. The tact that
some "humanitarian" organiza
tions which became experts in
worldwide terror are included in
the good group does not bother
Al Baadi very much.
Perhaps Israel should learn
how to commit "humanitarian
mass execution" from some
progressive liberation move
ments in the Arab world. Sur
prisingly enough, although not a
single terrorist captured by Israel
has been executed, Israel au
tomatically belongs to the bad
group.

Let me finish with a comment
about the proposed solution of a
bi-national state, favored by the
"moderate Palestinians." After
six million Jews, including most
of my family, were murdered in
the Holocaust, I am quite sus
picious about this "bi-national
experiment." The recent events
in Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran verify

my fears.
Therefore, when a rally is
opened with: "mourning the
creation of Israel," it is not a
peaceful one! This is just another
call for hatred. Is this considered
being supportive of peace?
