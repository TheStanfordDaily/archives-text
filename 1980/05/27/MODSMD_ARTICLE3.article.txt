## 
### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
A $3.75 million libel suit tiled against Art History Prof.
Albert Elsen in August. 1978. has been dropped, according
to Elsen and the plaintiffs attorney Charles Hawkins.
Hlsen said the suit, was settled "with prejudice." This
means the plaintiff will never instigate legal action on the
same grounds.
The suit, filed by George Schattle of Menlo Park, centers
on a letter sent by F.lsen to KGO-TV newsman Jerry Jen
sen. In the letter. Elsen stated that Schattle and a San Jose
man. Peter Stahl. were "trying to con unsuspecting
businessmen into buying four reputedly unique Rodin
sculptures" which were actually "outright fakes."
Elsen said he mailed the letter to alert Jensen of the
activities of Schattle and Stahl.
Suit dropped
According to Hawkins, the suit was dropped earlier this
year because he was unable to find an expert to dispute
F.lsen's determination of the statutes as fake.
"Dr. Elsen is the noted authority on Rodin." said Haw
kins. "I believe much of what he said is true. 1 don't think
that George Schattle is a con man." he said, "but if the
pieces are fake, what would Schattle's damages be?"
In an earlier statement to the Daily, Hawkins said he and
Schattle had had the sculptures examined by "authorities
with credentials equal to Elsen's," who confirmed the
pieces' authenticity. Last week, however, Hawkins said
there had been only the one authority, who concurred with
Elsen under questioning during the proceedings.
Hawkins had also been quoted as saying that he had
"seen all four pieces . . . and they look good to me." But he
recently said." I am not an art expert. Or. Elsen is, without a
doubt, the foremost authority, certainly on the West Coast

and probably in the country. 1 think Dr. Elsen is correct. . .
there is no point in causing more of a problem."
Basing judgment
In the suit. Elsen was charged with basing his judgment
(Mi only two ol the four statues, which were brought to him
for authentication by Schattle in 1973. He said lie was
"tipped off" that the statues were probably fake by careful
examination of the pieces, coupled with the fact that Schat
tle withheld the other two statues.
Elsen said that "everything was all wrong" with the
statues, that "the eyes lacked expression and the patina
rubbed off on a towel like shoe polish." He said he later
examined the other two sculptures, and determined them
fake as well.
A major unanswered question in the case is how the
letter, the cause of action, got from Jensen to Schattle.
Neither newsman Jensen or Schattle's attorney Hawkins
kyew how the letter reached Schattle. Schattle could not be
reached for comment.
No communication
"I've never had any communication with a person named
Schattle," Jensen said. "I have no information about the
lawsuit except hearsay, and I have no idea where the letter
is."
Jensen said that Elsen's letter was "unsolicited and dealt
with a matter which was under my jurisdiction." The station
had earlier dropped an investigation into allegations that
Elsen and the University had been involved in fraudulent
action.
Jensen repeatedly denied releasing the letter. Nonethe
less. Elsen said the press has a "moral obligation to main
tain the confidentiality of its sources," and that it Jensen
really didn't know how the letter was released, "what does
that say about Jensen as a reporter if he could not keep track
of materials sent to him?"
