# First Abscam charges
## Philly officials indicted 
### Charles Babcock The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — The first major Abscam
case indictments were returned last Thursday
against three members of the Philadelphia city
council and a lawyer who was a key middleman in
the undercover I B I operation.
A federal grand jury in Philadelphia charged
that the three officials, council president George
Schwartz and members Harry Janotti and Louis
Johanson, \ iolated racketeering and extortion laws
in taking $65,000 in January from FBI agents pos
ing as representatives of a wealthy Arab
businessman.
I loward Criden, a law partnerof Johanson's and
a potential witness to similar videotaped transac
tions with several members of Congress, solicited
SIS,OOO Irom the agents tor his role in arranging
the payoffs to the councilmen, the indictment said.
Federal grand juries in New York and
Washington have been hearing evidence on the
videotaped transactions with the congressmen, and
indictments in some of those cases are expected in
the next several weeks.
Leak outcries
The Abscam undercover operation was dis
closed in press reports in early February, as FBI
agents began questioning subjects of the IK
month-long investigation. The massive publicity —
before grand juries were empaneled — triggered
cries of alarm from defense lawyers, civil liberta
rians and top Justice Department officials, who
started an investigation of leaks.
Criden was considered a key witness against at
least two of the House members under investiga
tion. Reps. John Murphy (D-N.Y.). chairman of
the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee,
and Frank Thompson (D-N.J.). chairman of the
House Administration Committee. Criden is al
leged to have accepted $50,000 at separate meet
ings where the undercover agents discussed private
immigration bills with the two congressmen.
But Criden's attorney, Richard Ben-Veniste, re
lused government demands that Criden plead

guilty and then become a prosecution witness in
hopes of gaining a lenient sentence. Ben-Veniste
said Thursday that he expects his client to he in
dicted as the prosecutors "continue to put enorm
ous pressure on him to capitulate."
'Fantasy'
The lawyer called the indictment "fantasy
grafted upon fiction" because the undercover
operatives "who were pressing money on individu
als now somehow become victims of extortion."
Schwartz and Janotti said they had no intention
of giving up their council seats because of the in
dictment.
The new indictments are just the latest in a long
string of federal prosecutions of prominent
Philadelphia politicians.
Just the day before, four other top state Democ
ratic officials were in'dicted on charges of putting
"ghost" workers on state legislative payrolls. And
two Democratic Philadelphia congressmen. Reps.
Michael Myers and Raymond Lederer, also have
been identified as targets by the Abscam investiga
tion.
Late development
The case against the Philadelphia councilmen
was developed late in the wide-ranging undercover
operation.
FBI agents rented a posh suite in the Barclay
Hotel in mid-January and. according to the indict
ment. Criden then began arranging meetings with
the council members.
On Jan. IK Johanson took $25,000 in cash as
consideration lor his help on a planned hotel ven
ture by the Arab businessman, the grand jury
charged. Schwartz took $30,000 and Janotti
$1 ().()()() about a week later, the indictment said.
1 Bl agents Michael Wald. Anthony Amoroso
and Ernest Haridopolos acted as the representa
tives ot the phony Arab sheik.
Criden was named in all six counts of the indict
ment. two racketeering and four extortion charges.
The racketeering statute was passed in I 970 to aid
prosecution of organized crime but has been used
increasingly in recent years.
