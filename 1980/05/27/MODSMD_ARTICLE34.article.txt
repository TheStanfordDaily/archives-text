# A 						battle of best friends'
## USC's Van't Hof ends Rennert's NCAA dream in the finals 
### Ivan Maisel Staff Writer 
ATHENS, Ga. — On a day when top
seeded Peter Rennert played his close off
court friend, USC's Robert Van't Hof, his
closest friend on the court, his first serve,
deserted him. So too, did the title he so desp
erately wanted as the fifth-seeded Van't Hof
heat him 6-3. 7-5 yesterday to become the
19N0 NCAA singles champion.
Statistics are normally the stepchild of
such sports as baseball, where 10 more points
in a batting average can mean $ 10,000 come
contract time. lennis has little use for them,
for a sharp backhand cannot be described
with decimals.
But no statistic ever told a truer tale than
Rennert's first-serve percentage: 39.2 per
cent. Though it may be a great batting aver
age in baseball. .392 on first serves will not
get you past the club championship in tennis.
It was on first ser\es that Rennert, who had
played flawlessly for seven days, faltered. It
was also there that Van't Hof continued his
(lawless play for an eighth decisive day.
The USC junior, who will turn pro on the
heels of "my biggest win." pointed to his
opponent's serve as the main factor in the
match.
"Peter missing his first serve was the key,"
the 21-year-old champion said. "That put a
lot of»pressure on him. When he missed his
first serve, it ga\ e me confidence that I could
break him."
Van't Hof broke Rennert three times in
the final set of the 90-minute match, played
before a near-capacity crowd of 2500 at
Feild Stadium. Rennert gamely broke back
twice, but could not put away the tall blond
when he had the chance.
Stanford's senior All-America opened the
match with three straight points off of Van't
I lofs ser\ e. but the Trojan tought back with
four straight of his own to hold service.

"I could have had the momentum if I had
won the opening game of the match," Re
nnert lamented. "The following game I had
three aces and won easily."
But Rennert only had four aces in him for
the rest of the day, and Van't Hof s aggres
sive play was just too much for him to handle.
Van't Hof broke Rennert with a topspin
forehand in game six of the first set and
served out the set.
The second set, played during the heat of a
balmy spring day. tooj* its toll on both
players, as they swapped breaks twice in the
first eight games. Then Van't I lot jumped on
Rennert's poor serving to go ahead 3-0 in
game nine.
It was here that Rennert looked as if he
would take control. Pleading aloud for his
first serve to "come back soon." the Long
Island native served out the game, winning it
with a first serve down the middle Van't Hot
could not handle.
Rennert continued the pressure, pulling ttf
3-3 in game 10. set point for the top seed.
Van't Hof, however, denied him with a cross
court forehand that landed on the tape. The
match was over two games later. Rennert
hitting the last point into the net.
A distraught Rennert was puzzled b\ his
final-day lapse. "Robert played well. 1 don't
know what happened. He was hitting them
harder and deeper than 1 anticipated." Re
nnert said. "1 wanted to force the play, but I
couldn't because of Robert's serve.
"I couldn't take advantage of the oppor
tunities! had." he added. "Every time I had a
chance to turn it around. Robert hung in
there and turned it around."
Van't Hofsgame plan was. as always, ag
gressive. "I want to serve well, go in on my
first serve and try to make him pass me." the
champion said before the match.
He held true to his word, staying on top of
the game that had brought him to the finals.

"I didn't lei i.p. I was aggressive the whole
time. Rennert's second serve put him on the
defensive. It makes you think," he said.
Neither finalist had to think much on the
road to their confrontation yesterday after
noon. Both lost but j>ne set in the three days
of preliminary competition and those were in
the quarterfinals.
Van't Hof lost momentum midway
through his quarterfinal match against Clem
son's Mark Dickson before pulling out a 6-4,
6-7 (1-5), 6-3 win Saturday.
Rennert outlasted seeded Eddie Edwards
of Pepperdine in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-2,
6-4 in what was his toughest match prior to
yesterday, i was not confident going in to it.
I've watched Eddie play his best matches,"
he said after the Saturday match, speaking of
Edwards' defeat of John McEnroe t*'o years
ago.
Van't-Hof'S and Rennert's opponents in
the semifinals were unheard of and unex
pected. Both had tough opening matches
against Stanford players before making it
that far.
The biggest surprise was Ohio State's
Ernie Fernandez. Who, you ask? That is
exacth what Stanford senior Llovd Bourne
said alter his 6-7 (4-5), 4-6, 7-5 loss to the
Puerto Rican. the 1979 Big 10 Champion.
Following Bourne in asking the same ques
tion were Houston's Dave Dowlen, third
seeded Jay Lapidus of Princeton and 1980
NCAA doubles champion Rodney Harmon
of Tennessee, who lost seven match points in
a 1-6. 7-6 (5-4). 6-4 loss to the gutty Buc
keye.
Harmon felt as poorly as did Stanford's
Scott Bondurant. who had eight match points
on Princeton's Leif Shiras before succumb
ing 2-6. 7-5. 6-1. Admitting the win made
him "mentally tough." Shiras won six
straight sets before bowing to Van't Hof

Rennert. through his "syber \ision" be
ha\ ior reintorcement training had tor si\
months pictured playing 111 the NCAA finals.
His opponent, whom he heat h-4 in the third
set in Ins mind, was Van't Hoi.
I lo\ve\er. the Van't Hot heenv isioned was
not the same \ an't Hot he met yesterday, the
one who admitted to"pla\ingawtully well all
week I felt 'on' all week." This Van't Hot
was too much tor a player whom e\eryone
expected to win to handle.
"With all the upsets this week." the new
champion said, "it was nice to he able to gun
tor a higher seed tor a change."
ATHENS, Ga. — On a day when top
seeded Peter Rennert played his close off
court friend, USC's Robert Van't Hof, his
closest friend on the court, his first serve,
deserted him. So too, did the title he so desp
erately wanted as the fifth-seeded Van't Hof
heat him 6-3. 7-5 yesterday to become the
19N0 NCAA singles champion.
Statistics are normally the stepchild of
such sports as baseball, where 10 more points
in a batting average can mean $ 10,000 come
contract time. lennis has little use for them,
for a sharp backhand cannot be described
with decimals.
But no statistic ever told a truer tale than
Rennert's first-serve percentage: 39.2 per
cent. Though it may be a great batting aver
age in baseball. .392 on first serves will not
get you past the club championship in tennis.
It was on first ser\es that Rennert, who had
played flawlessly for seven days, faltered. It
was also there that Van't Hof continued his
(lawless play for an eighth decisive day.
The USC junior, who will turn pro on the
heels of "my biggest win." pointed to his
opponent's serve as the main factor in the
match.
"Peter missing his first serve was the key,"
the 21-year-old champion said. "That put a
lot of»pressure on him. When he missed his
first serve, it ga\ e me confidence that I could
break him."
Van't Hof broke Rennert three times in
the final set of the 90-minute match, played
before a near-capacity crowd of 2500 at
Feild Stadium. Rennert gamely broke back
twice, but could not put away the tall blond
when he had the chance.
Stanford's senior All-America opened the
match with three straight points off of Van't
I lofs ser\ e. but the Trojan tought back with
four straight of his own to hold service.

"I could have had the momentum if I had
won the opening game of the match," Re
nnert lamented. "The following game I had
three aces and won easily."
But Rennert only had four aces in him for
the rest of the day, and Van't Hof s aggres
sive play was just too much for him to handle.
Van't Hof broke Rennert with a topspin
forehand in game six of the first set and
served out the set.
The second set, played during the heat of a
balmy spring day. tooj* its toll on both
players, as they swapped breaks twice in the
first eight games. Then Van't I lot jumped on
Rennert's poor serving to go ahead 3-0 in
game nine.
It was here that Rennert looked as if he
would take control. Pleading aloud for his
first serve to "come back soon." the Long
Island native served out the game, winning it
with a first serve down the middle Van't Hot
could not handle.
Rennert continued the pressure, pulling ttf
3-3 in game 10. set point for the top seed.
Van't Hof, however, denied him with a cross
court forehand that landed on the tape. The
match was over two games later. Rennert
hitting the last point into the net.
A distraught Rennert was puzzled b\ his
final-day lapse. "Robert played well. 1 don't
know what happened. He was hitting them
harder and deeper than 1 anticipated." Re
nnert said. "1 wanted to force the play, but I
couldn't because of Robert's serve.
"I couldn't take advantage of the oppor
tunities! had." he added. "Every time I had a
chance to turn it around. Robert hung in
there and turned it around."
Van't Hofsgame plan was. as always, ag
gressive. "I want to serve well, go in on my
first serve and try to make him pass me." the
champion said before the match.
He held true to his word, staying on top of
the game that had brought him to the finals.

"I didn't lei i.p. I was aggressive the whole
time. Rennert's second serve put him on the
defensive. It makes you think," he said.
Neither finalist had to think much on the
road to their confrontation yesterday after
noon. Both lost but j>ne set in the three days
of preliminary competition and those were in
the quarterfinals.
Van't Hof lost momentum midway
through his quarterfinal match against Clem
son's Mark Dickson before pulling out a 6-4,
6-7 (1-5), 6-3 win Saturday.
Rennert outlasted seeded Eddie Edwards
of Pepperdine in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-2,
6-4 in what was his toughest match prior to
yesterday, i was not confident going in to it.
I've watched Eddie play his best matches,"
he said after the Saturday match, speaking of
Edwards' defeat of John McEnroe t*'o years
ago.
Van't-Hof'S and Rennert's opponents in
the semifinals were unheard of and unex
pected. Both had tough opening matches
against Stanford players before making it
that far.
The biggest surprise was Ohio State's
Ernie Fernandez. Who, you ask? That is
exacth what Stanford senior Llovd Bourne
said alter his 6-7 (4-5), 4-6, 7-5 loss to the
Puerto Rican. the 1979 Big 10 Champion.
Following Bourne in asking the same ques

of Tennessee, who lost seven match points in

But Rennert only had four aces in him for
the rest of the day, and Van't Hof s aggres
sive play was just too much for him to handle.
Van't Hof broke Rennert with a topspin
forehand in game six of the first set and
served out the set.
The second set, played during the heat of a
balmy spring day. tooj* its toll on both
players, as they swapped breaks twice in the
first eight games. Then Van't I lot jumped on
Rennert's poor serving to go ahead 3-0 in
game nine.
It was here that Rennert looked as if he
would take control. Pleading aloud for his
first serve to "come back soon." the Long
Island native served out the game, winning it
with a first serve down the middle Van't Hot
could not handle.
Rennert continued the pressure, pulling ttf
3-3 in game 10. set point for the top seed.
Van't Hof, however, denied him with a cross
court forehand that landed on the tape. The
match was over two games later. Rennert
hitting the last point into the net.
A distraught Rennert was puzzled b\ his
final-day lapse. "Robert played well. 1 don't
know what happened. He was hitting them
harder and deeper than 1 anticipated." Re
nnert said. "1 wanted to force the play, but I
couldn't because of Robert's serve.
"I couldn't take advantage of the oppor
tunities! had." he added. "Every time I had a
chance to turn it around. Robert hung in
there and turned it around."
Van't Hofsgame plan was. as always, ag
gressive. "I want to serve well, go in on my
first serve and try to make him pass me." the
champion said before the match.
He held true to his word, staying on top of
the game that had brought him to the finals.

"I didn't lei i.p. I was aggressive the whole
time. Rennert's second serve put him on the
defensive. It makes you think," he said.
Neither finalist had to think much on the
road to their confrontation yesterday after
noon. Both lost but j>ne set in the three days
of preliminary competition and those were in
the quarterfinals.
Van't Hof lost momentum midway
through his quarterfinal match against Clem
son's Mark Dickson before pulling out a 6-4,
6-7 (1-5), 6-3 win Saturday.
Rennert outlasted seeded Eddie Edwards
of Pepperdine in the quarterfinals 3-6, 6-2,
6-4 in what was his toughest match prior to
yesterday, i was not confident going in to it.
I've watched Eddie play his best matches,"
he said after the Saturday match, speaking of
Edwards' defeat of John McEnroe t*'o years
ago.
Van't-Hof'S and Rennert's opponents in
the semifinals were unheard of and unex
pected. Both had tough opening matches
against Stanford players before making it
that far.
The biggest surprise was Ohio State's
Ernie Fernandez. Who, you ask? That is
exacth what Stanford senior Llovd Bourne
said alter his 6-7 (4-5), 4-6, 7-5 loss to the
Puerto Rican. the 1979 Big 10 Champion.
Following Bourne in asking the same ques
tion were Houston's Dave Dowlen, third
seeded Jay Lapidus of Princeton and 1980
NCAA doubles champion Rodney Harmon
of Tennessee, who lost seven match points in
a 1-6. 7-6 (5-4). 6-4 loss to the gutty Buc
keye.
Harmon felt as poorly as did Stanford's
Scott Bondurant. who had eight match points
on Princeton's Leif Shiras before succumb
ing 2-6. 7-5. 6-1. Admitting the win made
him "mentally tough." Shiras won six
straight sets before bowing to Van't Hof

ha\ ior reintorcement training had tor si\

I lo\ve\er. the Van't Hot heenv isioned was

one who admitted to"pla\ingawtully well all

"With all the upsets this week." the new

ATHENS, Ga. — On a day when top
seeded Peter Rennert played his close off
court friend, USC's Robert Van't Hof, his
closest friend on the court, his first serve,
deserted him. So too, did the title he so desp
erately wanted as the fifth-seeded Van't Hof
heat him 6-3. 7-5 yesterday to become the
19N0 NCAA singles champion.
Statistics are normally the stepchild of
such sports as baseball, where 10 more points
in a batting average can mean $ 10,000 come
contract time. lennis has little use for them,
for a sharp backhand cannot be described
with decimals.
But no statistic ever told a truer tale than
Rennert's first-serve percentage: 39.2 per
cent. Though it may be a great batting aver
age in baseball. .392 on first serves will not
get you past the club championship in tennis.
It was on first ser\es that Rennert, who had
played flawlessly for seven days, faltered. It
was also there that Van't Hof continued his
(lawless play for an eighth decisive day.
The USC junior, who will turn pro on the
heels of "my biggest win." pointed to his
opponent's serve as the main factor in the
match.
"Peter missing his first serve was the key,"
the 21-year-old champion said. "That put a
lot of»pressure on him. When he missed his
first serve, it ga\ e me confidence that I could
break him."
Van't Hof broke Rennert three times in
the final set of the 90-minute match, played
before a near-capacity crowd of 2500 at
Feild Stadium. Rennert gamely broke back
twice, but could not put away the tall blond
when he had the chance.
Stanford's senior All-America opened the
match with three straight points off of Van't
I lofs ser\ e. but the Trojan tought back with
four straight of his own to hold service.

"I could have had the momentum if I had
won the opening game of the match," Re
nnert lamented. "The following game I had
three aces and won easily."
But Rennert only had four aces in him for
the rest of the day, and Van't Hof s aggres
sive play was just too much for him to handle.
Van't Hof broke Rennert with a topspin
forehand in game six of the first set and
