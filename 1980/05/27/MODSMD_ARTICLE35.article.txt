### Steve Odell Staff Writer 
The Pacific-10 Track and 112 ield Championships,
held this weekend on the campus of the University
of Washington, featured its share of highlights, but
unfortunately for Stanford, most of them did not
include Cardinals.
Stanford finished ninth in the annual competi
tion which was won by UCLA. The Cards tallied 2N
points and edged out the host I luskies. who ended
up in the cellar with 20.
Stanford did have two events in which they fared
well, however. In the discus. Rick Buss, the man
who. according to head coach Brooks Johnson,
"has been our most consistent performer day in
and day out." earned fourth place with a toss of
179-K.
The Cardinals also had a fifth place finish turned
in by their mile relay team. The Stanford quartet ol
Garry Shumway. Robert Maioceo, Darrin Nelson
and Gordon Banks crossed the finish line in a time
ol 3:15.56 in the event, which was won by the
Bruins in a clocking of 3:05.26.
UCLA chalked up five victories in all. on their
way to a team score ol 163 points. The Bruins, who
brought a perfect 7-0 dual meet record into the
conference championships, (railed the defending
champion University of Oregon Ducks by 30

points heading into the second day of events. But
the Bruins blew Oregon away in the final I 3 e\ cuts
to claim their tirst Pac-10 championship since
1973.
Greg Foster paced UCLA, running on a meet
record 13.43 seconds in the I 10-meter high hur
dles, his third straight Pac-10 high hurdles title.
Foster broke his own conference record of I 3.47 in
the event, which he set last year. Foster also
finished second in the 200-meter dash and helped
the Bruins to a third-place finish in the 400 meter
relay.
Two other big names at the meet were USC
sprinter James San ford and Oregon's Ken Martin.
Sanlord led the way for a third place team finish
for the Trojans. San ford ran to a new Pac-10 re
cord in the 100-meter dash, taking the tape at
10.10. 11c then came back to win the 200 meters in
20.61 and to run a leg on the USC 400-meter relay
team that finished second to Arizona State.
Martin, the Oregon distance man. won the 3000
meter Steeplechase Friday, and then came through
with another \ ictory in the 5000 meters in I 3:4 1.6.
Martin, who along with Sanlord were the two dou
ble winners in the four-day meet, led the Ducks to
si\ individual \ ictories, the most for any team in the
22-evcnt competition.
