### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
"It was a very positive experi
ence to have three freshmen gc
up there and become a close-knil
team." said women's track coach
Laurel Treon of her team's per
formance in hist week's AIAW
national championships ir
Eugene. Oregon.
Montanan Mary Osbornt
placed second in Saturday's jave
lin finals. Treon described Os
borne's 166-foot-4 toss as "ex
cellent, under the circumstances.
Others grumbled about the rain
and the cold, but she'd warmed
up an hour in ad\ ance. She made
(the weather) part of her psych
up instead of a psych-out."
Kim Schnurpfeil, who had
finished sixth overall in Thurs
day's 3000 meter semifinals,
came in 16th in 17.58 in the final
competition Saturday. She pas
sed the mile-mark in 5:03, a full
10 seconds ahead of her
16:23.06 pace on Thursday, but
found hersell in only tenth posi
tion. "That was really a shock,
and she totally froze up for the
rest of the race," Treon
explained.
"She really went out for it and
thought she had a chance to
win." Treon added of
Schnurpfeil. "That was a harder
race than anv she's run in her life.

I'm still very pleased with her
winning attitude."
The Cards' other competitor,
I'am Donald, finished 17th in the
preliminary long jump rounds.
Only the top 12 qualified for
final competition, so Donald
could not participate in the fi
nals. "Pam's had her ups and
downs this season, hut her ex
periences this year have set her
up well for the future," Treon
said.
The Cardinals also competed
in the AAU Pacific Association
Championships at Cal State
-1 yesterday.
There, Osborne released a
178-3 javelin throw, her per
sonal best and a winning effort. It
was the third farthest hurl in the
nation this year, according to
Treon. and "confirms that this
girl can throw. It was the first
time she's passed her high school
175 foot mark," Treon added.
"If Mary continues to throw
like this, her chances are good to
make some international teams
this summer," Treon said.
Also in the Hayward meet,
Schnurpfeil won the 3000 meter
run. Donald lept to first place in
the long jump and freshman
Shelley Poerio was fourth in the
400 meter dash.
