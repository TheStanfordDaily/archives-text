## 
### 
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A
protest by Pancho Carter was re
jected hv race officials and 19X0
Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny
Rutherford talked yesterday
about joining veteran A.J. I oyt
as a four-time champion ol the
world's richest auto race.
Carter protested being
penalized one lap for passing the
pace car during a yellow caution
light on the 58th lap ol Sunday's
64th running of the race. The
penalty moved Carter from sec
ond to sixth place in the final
standings.
"It was a difference in in

terpretation." Carter said about
the signal he received from race
official Bob C'assaday in the pace
car. "It looked to me like he was
signaling lor me to go ahead, as
they sometimes do. He said lie
was signaling me to stop."
"We denied the protest be
cause no reajly new facts were
presented beyond those consi
dered at the time the penalty was
assessed.'" said Tom Binford,
chiel stesard of the race. "To us,
it was a clear-cut case of a rules
violation."
Rutherford is the sixth driver
to win the race three times. He

drove Ins "ground effects"
Chaparral arming the 2'/j-mile
oval track at an average speed ot
142.K62 mph in a race slowed by
13 yellow flags.
I Ic led 1 I S ol the 200 laps and
his victory margin over runncrup
Tom Sneva was more than 33
seconds.
The 42-year-old Rutherford
said he would like to make a run
at Foyt's distinction ot being the
only driver to win the race lour
times. He also called comments
tha Foyt reportedly made about
his car "sour grapes".
" Rutherford's car . . . thevcan

say it's ground effects, but all it is
is they've got the valve figures
out. It isn't ground effects. It's
whoever cheats best," said Foyt,
according to a Chicago Sun-
Times story.
"I really don't want to com
ment," Rutherford said at a
press conference after yester
day's traditional victory photo
session. " But, I guess you always
get some sour grapes after a
race."
Rutherford was asked it he
thought he still would be racing
when he was 52, like Jim McEl
reath, who finished 24th this
year.
i have no idea about retir
ing." he said. "It's just whatever
feels right that will determine
when I stop."
Foyt's comments came after
his car stalled and he dropped
out ol the race on his I 74th lap to
finish 14th — the worst finish by
the 45-year-old Texan since
1974.
"You can't outrun a turtle the
way they're running this race,"
I oyt said about the U.S. Auto
Club rule limiting the boost the
turbocharged engine receives to
4X inches.
Rutherford, who previously
won in 1974 and 1976. also has
been critical of the rule.
"It the cars stay the same, thev

can he safely run with more
boost," he said. "The margin of
error would be less because of
reaction time, but at 200 miles
per hour the cars would probably
be safer."
Jim Hall, who built and de
signed the winning car lor the
second time in three >i us. said
that under current conditions the
cars are moving at top speed
nearly all the time.
"We need a difference in
corner and straightaway speed,
so that drivers like Johnny can
have the chance to show what
they can do." Hall said.
And while Rutherford was
thinking about the check he
would receive at the victory ban
quet. Carter was talking about
the difference between second
and sixth-place money.
"The difference was about
$70,000 last year," he said. "The
pace car wasn't up to speed to
pick me up. At some races, they
wave the lead car by and pick us
up the next time around.
"I've been around racing long
enough." said the championship
car veteran, "to know the devia
tion from a solid hand which
means stop and a motion to go
by.
"But, I'm moving at ISO mph
and I'm trying toavoid a wreck in
Iron of me. If I was trying to
cheat by passing the pace car. I'd
have gained a lap. Mario (An
dretti) was leading just as the
pace care came out. He went to
the pits. I guess I should have
too.
"But that's Monday morning
uuarterbackina."

when I stop."
Foyt's comments came after
his car stalled and he dropped
out ol the race on his I 74th lap to
finish 14th — the worst finish by
the 45-year-old Texan since
1974.
"You can't outrun a turtle the
way they're running this race,"
I oyt said about the U.S. Auto
Club rule limiting the boost the
turbocharged engine receives to
4X inches.
Rutherford, who previously
won in 1974 and 1976. also has
been critical of the rule.
"It the cars stay the same, thev

can he safely run with more
boost," he said. "The margin of
error would be less because of
reaction time, but at 200 miles
per hour the cars would probably
be safer."
Jim Hall, who built and de
signed the winning car lor the
second time in three >i us. said
that under current conditions the
cars are moving at top speed
nearly all the time.
"We need a difference in
corner and straightaway speed,
so that drivers like Johnny can
have the chance to show what
they can do." Hall said.
And while Rutherford was
thinking about the check he
would receive at the victory ban
quet. Carter was talking about
the difference between second
and sixth-place money.
"The difference was about
$70,000 last year," he said. "The
pace car wasn't up to speed to
pick me up. At some races, they
wave the lead car by and pick us
up the next time around.
"I've been around racing long
enough." said the championship
car veteran, "to know the devia
tion from a solid hand which
means stop and a motion to go
by.
"But, I'm moving at ISO mph
and I'm trying toavoid a wreck in
Iron of me. If I was trying to
cheat by passing the pace car. I'd
have gained a lap. Mario (An
dretti) was leading just as the
pace care came out. He went to
the pits. I guess I should have

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — A
protest by Pancho Carter was re
jected hv race officials and 19X0
Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny
Rutherford talked yesterday
about joining veteran A.J. I oyt
as a four-time champion ol the
world's richest auto race.
Carter protested being
penalized one lap for passing the
pace car during a yellow caution
light on the 58th lap ol Sunday's
64th running of the race. The
penalty moved Carter from sec
ond to sixth place in the final
standings.
"It was a difference in in

terpretation." Carter said about
the signal he received from race
official Bob C'assaday in the pace
car. "It looked to me like he was
signaling lor me to go ahead, as
they sometimes do. He said lie
was signaling me to stop."
"We denied the protest be
cause no reajly new facts were
presented beyond those consi
dered at the time the penalty was
assessed.'" said Tom Binford,
chiel stesard of the race. "To us,
it was a clear-cut case of a rules
violation."
Rutherford is the sixth driver
to win the race three times. He

drove Ins "ground effects"
Chaparral arming the 2'/j-mile
oval track at an average speed ot
142.K62 mph in a race slowed by
13 yellow flags.
I Ic led 1 I S ol the 200 laps and
his victory margin over runncrup
Tom Sneva was more than 33
seconds.
The 42-year-old Rutherford
said he would like to make a run
at Foyt's distinction ot being the
only driver to win the race lour
times. He also called comments
tha Foyt reportedly made about
his car "sour grapes".
" Rutherford's car . . . thevcan

say it's ground effects, but all it is
is they've got the valve figures
out. It isn't ground effects. It's
whoever cheats best," said Foyt,
according to a Chicago Sun-
Times story.
"I really don't want to com
ment," Rutherford said at a
press conference after yester
day's traditional victory photo
session. " But, I guess you always
get some sour grapes after a
race."
Rutherford was asked it he
thought he still would be racing
when he was 52, like Jim McEl
reath, who finished 24th this
year.
