When it was over, when the New
York Islanders had won the lust
National Hotkey League title ot
their eight-year history, it
seemed ev cry thing had conic full
circle.
They had completed their
climb from league laughingstock
to league champion. They had
beaten the Philadelphia Flyers,
against whom they had opened
the regular season with a 5-2
loss. And they had done it with
what has become their
trademark — the overtime goal.
Before that overtime Satur
day, before Bob Nystrom scored
at 7:1 I for the fourth overtime
goal ol his career. New 112 ork
backup goalie Cilenn Resell said.
"I think God wanted it to go into
overtime."
Six times before in the I%()
playoffs, the Islanders had gone
into overtime. Five times they
had won — once against Los
Angeles, twice against Boston
(the only team to manage an
overtime victory against them),
once against Buffalo and once in
the lust game ol the Stanley C'up
final against the Myers.
So this time in the New ork
dressing room, after Philadel
phia had tied the game 4-4 on
third-period goals by Bob Dailey
and John Paddock, the Islanders'

i outine had been refined to a sci
ence.
Nystrom went to his locker
near the corner of the clubhouse
and carved a notch in his stick,
for the goal he always plans on
scoring.
Then the chatter began.
"You start hearing it from one
end of the room: "Who's gonna
be the hero? Who's gonna be the
hero,"' said Nystrom. "And then
someone will say, 'I'm gonna be
the hero. I'm gonna be the
hero."'
Saturday, Nystrom was the
hero. And now lie lias been the
overtime hero more times than
anyone but Montreal's legen
dary Maurice Richard, who
scored six overtime goals.
In time, perhaps Nystrom will
equal or surpass that mark. But
the instant he converted John
Tonelli's pass on a two-on-one
break, the instant the islanders
had the 5-4 triumph and the
Cup. there was nothing surpas
sing the feeling.
"I hardly had time to think,
because before I could. I had all
the players swarming all over
me." said the 27-year-old right
wing.
"When we scored the winning
goal, two things popped into my
mind: That we won the Stanley
Clin and that the season was

over," said center Bryan Trotier.
the playoffs' Most Valuable
Player with a record 29 points.
"I'm happy that the season is
over, because it's been a long
season. But I'm happiest we won
the C'up. I put that over every
thing."
Philadelphia lined up, shook
the winners' hands, and left
taking with it the record 35-
game unbeaten streak and the
regular season title. But not the
Cup. That belonged to the Islan
ders.
