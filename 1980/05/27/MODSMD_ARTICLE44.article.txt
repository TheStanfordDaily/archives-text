session of the U.N. Security Council it Iran ignores a
World Court order to release the 53 American hos
tages.

ution to impose sanctions against Iran in January.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland, that the
World Court's unanimous ruling Saturday Ifad
"dramatically changed" the hostage situation even
though a top Iranian official called the decision -
"meaningless."
Christopher noted that the Sovi'6t«and Polish
judges voted with the other 13 members of the inter
national panel to order Iran to free the captives, and
he suggested that might indicate a shift in Kremlin
thinking. Such a shift. Christopher said, would enable
the United States to try '.'previously unavailable re
medies" to force the hostages' release.

the Security Council that the hostages be freed or the
implementation ot sanctions against Iran under the
United Nations Charter.

convenes tomorrow. It is not. however, expected to
take up the hostage question immediately. The hos
