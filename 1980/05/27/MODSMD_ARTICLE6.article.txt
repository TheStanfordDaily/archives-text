# Bush drops GOP candidacy
## 
### 
112 rom the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON — He was the
comeback candidate. No one took
more beatings. No one went to the mat
more often. No one bounced back with
more tenacity and grace.
Kven in the end, he didn't want to
quit. He agoni/ed over it tor days. H
nally. he accepted what the numbers
told him — that he was finished.
So yesterday, George Bush, strap
ped for delegate votes and campaign
funds, bowed out of the Republican
presidential race, throwing his support
and the GOP nomination — to
Ronald Reagan.
I'lie eonserv ative former governor of
California thus will coast unchallenged
into the Republican National Conven
tion in Detroit this July to claim the
nomination that narrowly eluded his
grasp four years ago.
Bush said the decision went against
"my every gut instinct, my every bit of
training.
" I have never quit a fight in my life,"
he said. "But throughout my political
career. I have always worked to unite

and strengthen the Republican party."
Bush said he would urge delegates
already pledged to him and any
selected in the final round of primaries
to support Reagan at the convention.
"The No. I priority for Republicans
in the fall of 1980 is to unite to save our
country from four more years of Jimmy
Carter's weak, directionless, incompe
tent leadership," Bush said.
In California. Reagan called Bush "a
superior campaigner." and said he was
"most grateful for his expression of
support for my candidacy and for his
pledge to work for unity in the party."
Bush was the sixth and final major
GOP challenger to withdraw from the
race. The others quit after defeats.
Bush, in the great irony of his candi
dacy. saw his campaign collapse after
his biggest victory of the year, a 2-1
thumping of Reagan in last Tuesday's
Michigan primary.
The media, especially two television
networks, overlooked that victory to
concentrate instead on Reagan's
mounting delegate count. ABC and
CBS said that night that Reagan had
climbed over the magic 99S figure
needed for nomination; other news or
ganizations said Reagan was on the
brink.
Bush and his advisers claimed the
two networks had done him in. but re
gardless of what they did. the numbers
were all against the former U.N. am
bassador and director of the Central
Intelligence Agency. They made the
continuation of his candidacy all but
impossible.
He had long hinged his candidacy on
a strong finish in the California. New
Jersey and Ohio, the three big contests
on June 3. the final day of the primary
season. But his campaign was in debt —
$250,000 to $300,000 — and "a wide
spread perception that the campaign is

over, M as Bush put it yesterday, dried
up the flow of new money.
His advisers had budgeted 51.25
million for the last three states, of
which $250,000 has been spent. Bush
didn't have money to pay his staff, or
for the last week even to charter a cam
paign plane.
Even after last Thursday, when Bush
abandoned his efforts in California,
projections showed that he lacked the
money to wage anything more than a
skeleton effort in New Jersey and Ohio
without going another $200,000 to
$300,000 in debt.
It was for financial reasons that Bush
yesterday did not technically and leg
ally end Ins candidacy, a move that his
advisers feared might make him inelig
ible tor federal matching funds that
they hope will help erase the debt.
James Baker, his campaign manager,
said Bush did not want to do anything
to cause the EEC to cut off those funds,
even though Bush "clearly . . .is saying
that Reagan is going to win the Repub
lican presidential nomination."
Baker said Bush originally had
budgeted $9 million for his campaign,
but spending hit $16.2 million. A
shortfall in expected contributions will
leave Bush with a $300,000 debt, he
said. Campaign aides said a debt of that
si/e would be "easil\ manageable."
That Bush was the last surviving
GOP challenger is one of the great
political success stories of the 1980
campaign.
Despite his experience. Bush was
largely unknown to the public. He was
always a longshot, far behind better
known candidates such as John Con
nally. Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
and Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in the
polls.

always a longshot, far behind better
known candidates such as John Con
nally. Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
and Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in the
polls.
112 rom the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON — He was the
comeback candidate. No one took
more beatings. No one went to the mat
more often. No one bounced back with
more tenacity and grace.
Kven in the end, he didn't want to
quit. He agoni/ed over it tor days. H
nally. he accepted what the numbers
told him — that he was finished.
So yesterday, George Bush, strap
ped for delegate votes and campaign
funds, bowed out of the Republican
presidential race, throwing his support
and the GOP nomination — to
Ronald Reagan.
I'lie eonserv ative former governor of
California thus will coast unchallenged
into the Republican National Conven
tion in Detroit this July to claim the
nomination that narrowly eluded his
grasp four years ago.
Bush said the decision went against
"my every gut instinct, my every bit of
training.
" I have never quit a fight in my life,"
he said. "But throughout my political
career. I have always worked to unite

and strengthen the Republican party."
Bush said he would urge delegates
already pledged to him and any
selected in the final round of primaries
to support Reagan at the convention.
"The No. I priority for Republicans
in the fall of 1980 is to unite to save our
country from four more years of Jimmy
Carter's weak, directionless, incompe
tent leadership," Bush said.
In California. Reagan called Bush "a
superior campaigner." and said he was
"most grateful for his expression of
support for my candidacy and for his
pledge to work for unity in the party."
Bush was the sixth and final major
GOP challenger to withdraw from the
race. The others quit after defeats.
Bush, in the great irony of his candi
dacy. saw his campaign collapse after
his biggest victory of the year, a 2-1
thumping of Reagan in last Tuesday's
Michigan primary.
The media, especially two television
networks, overlooked that victory to
concentrate instead on Reagan's
mounting delegate count. ABC and
CBS said that night that Reagan had
climbed over the magic 99S figure
needed for nomination; other news or
ganizations said Reagan was on the
brink.
Bush and his advisers claimed the
two networks had done him in. but re
gardless of what they did. the numbers
were all against the former U.N. am
bassador and director of the Central
Intelligence Agency. They made the
continuation of his candidacy all but
impossible.
He had long hinged his candidacy on
a strong finish in the California. New
Jersey and Ohio, the three big contests
on June 3. the final day of the primary
season. But his campaign was in debt —
$250,000 to $300,000 — and "a wide
spread perception that the campaign is

over, M as Bush put it yesterday, dried
up the flow of new money.
His advisers had budgeted 51.25
million for the last three states, of
which $250,000 has been spent. Bush
didn't have money to pay his staff, or
for the last week even to charter a cam
paign plane.
Even after last Thursday, when Bush
abandoned his efforts in California,
projections showed that he lacked the
money to wage anything more than a
skeleton effort in New Jersey and Ohio
without going another $200,000 to
$300,000 in debt.
It was for financial reasons that Bush
yesterday did not technically and leg
ally end Ins candidacy, a move that his
advisers feared might make him inelig
ible tor federal matching funds that
they hope will help erase the debt.
James Baker, his campaign manager,
said Bush did not want to do anything
to cause the EEC to cut off those funds,
even though Bush "clearly . . .is saying
that Reagan is going to win the Repub
lican presidential nomination."
Baker said Bush originally had
budgeted $9 million for his campaign,
but spending hit $16.2 million. A
shortfall in expected contributions will
leave Bush with a $300,000 debt, he
said. Campaign aides said a debt of that
si/e would be "easil\ manageable."
That Bush was the last surviving
GOP challenger is one of the great
political success stories of the 1980
campaign.
Despite his experience. Bush was
largely unknown to the public. He was
always a longshot, far behind better
known candidates such as John Con
nally. Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.)
and Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in the
polls.
