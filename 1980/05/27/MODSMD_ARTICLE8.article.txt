# Volcano activity threat continues

PORTLAND, Ore. — Thoroughly
dusted and disgusted, virtually the en
tire Pacific Northwest awoke yesterday
to a dawning awareness that life under
the volcano — for months, years, even
decades — may be less predictable, less
comfortable, less safe.
Major population centers west of er
ratic Mount St. Helens were thrown
into disorder Sunday by an unexpected
but mild taste of its violence. And yes
terday, several small earthquakes dis
turbed the otherwise quiet volcano,
suggesting that molten rock may be
moving up through the mountain
again, scientists said.
Molten rock reaching the top of the
mountain produced the huge explosion
May IN which killed at least 21 people
and left 76 missing.
Second eruption
Since its deadly explosion, a week
and a half ago. residents of unscathed
Western cities had watched the moun
tain's behavior with fascination. But
after a wind-shift and a second major

eruption early Sunday, it took only
one-eighth of an inch of volcanic dust
and ash, and Mount St. Helens had de
lighted them long enough.
"I'll tell you one thing." said Otis
Bouchard, a service station operator in
ash-blown Castle Rock. "I'm getting
damn tired of this mountain."
No deaths or injuries were reported
after Sunday's blast.
Yesterday's quakes, measuring less
than 3.0 on the Richter scale, appeared
to be closer to the surface than quakes
which preceded the eruption Sunday.
Magma moving
"Before the (Sunday) eruption, the
earthquakes were registering as deep
as 20 kilometers (within the volcano)."
said Don F-i nicy of the U.S. Geological
Survey. "Now they register seven
kilometers. That possibly could be an
indication that magma could be mov ing
up."
But volcanologists could olter no as*-
surance that the mountain activity
might not become a continuing if
sporadic fixture in the region.

Similarly, beleaguered state and fed
eral agencies, still gearing into massive
disaster assistance operations, are fret
ting over whether their emergency ef
forts might have to continue for de
cades.
"Are we worried? Of course we
are." said Rhonda Brooks of
Washington State's Department of
Emergency Services. "We're wonder
ing — when is all this going to end?"
No one is willing to hazard a guess,
but the closest thing to it arises from
Mount St. Helens' own most recent his
tory.
Volcanologists Dwight Crandell and
Donal Mullineaux, in a 1 97K pamphlet
batted 1000 in predicting the possibil
ity of an eruption before the end of this
century.
Danfage costs
Quite aside from any future erup
tions. the effects of what has already
happened are staggeringly high —
damage assessments soared to $1.6
billion yetsterday — and are still rising.
One inevitable but as-yet
unanswerable question concerns the
fate of the many crossroad villages,
logging towns and out-of-the-way
stores, perhaps undamaged them
selves, that nonetheless existed chiefly
to provide services lor the 150-
square-mile sportsman's paradise,
timberland and tourist resort that was
blasted off the map.
Economically orphaned by sudden
loss of the (immense natural resources

that gave tViem life, is there a chance
they will become ghost towns?
"Sure. Some of them already are get
ting that way, said Jim Unterwegner.
public information officer lor the Ciil
ford Pinchot National Forest, in which
the blast area is located.
Unterwegner said towns nearest the
mercurial mountain, like Cougar, 10
miles southwest, eventually may lind
they are unable to live with the ongoing
danger of earthquake or eruption or
with the nuisance of frequent ash-lalls.
Autopsies
In related news, autopsies on six per
sons found at least 10 miles trom
Mount St. Helens after its initial erup
tion show they did not die of burns hut
suffocated on ash and gas that poured
out of the volcano.
King County Medical Examiner Dr.
John Eisele said in Seattle that autop
sies performed Sunday indicated the
victims might have either breathed the
choking dust or been smothered under
it.
"A few breaths would be sufficient
to explain the findings," Eisele said.
"We can't tell if the victims were con
scious or how long they survived.,
Smoke inhalation
"There are burns, hut no blast or
explosion-type injuries. It appears to
have been . . . more like smoke inhala
tion from a house fire.
"One problem is that we still don't
know what kind of gas we're looking
for."
After looking through a pathology
reference book about the causes of
death, he said there was "not a word"
about victims of volcanic eruptions.
"So we write the book," Eisele said.
Volcanic gases
' Scientists say that the main gases
emitted by volcanoes are water vapor,
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
But volcanoes also can emit various
compounds of sulfur, chlorine, nitro
gen and sometimes fluorine which can
form acid or alkaline compounds that
are very toxic to lung tissue.
These acid or alkaline compounds
usually are neutralized by natural
chemical processes outside the im
mediate area of the volcano and so do
not threaten wide areas.
The spreading blast wave from the
May IS explosion is believed to have
had a temperature of 400 to 500 de
crees Farhenheit.

Volcanic gases
' Scientists say that the main gases
emitted by volcanoes are water vapor,
carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.
But volcanoes also can emit various
compounds of sulfur, chlorine, nitro
gen and sometimes fluorine which can
form acid or alkaline compounds that
are very toxic to lung tissue.
These acid or alkaline compounds
usually are neutralized by natural
chemical processes outside the im
mediate area of the volcano and so do
not threaten wide areas.

May IS explosion is believed to have
had a temperature of 400 to 500 de

PORTLAND, Ore. — Thoroughly
dusted and disgusted, virtually the en
tire Pacific Northwest awoke yesterday
to a dawning awareness that life under
the volcano — for months, years, even
decades — may be less predictable, less
comfortable, less safe.
Major population centers west of er
ratic Mount St. Helens were thrown
into disorder Sunday by an unexpected
but mild taste of its violence. And yes
terday, several small earthquakes dis
turbed the otherwise quiet volcano,
suggesting that molten rock may be
moving up through the mountain
again, scientists said.
Molten rock reaching the top of the
mountain produced the huge explosion
May IN which killed at least 21 people
and left 76 missing.
Second eruption
Since its deadly explosion, a week
and a half ago. residents of unscathed
Western cities had watched the moun
tain's behavior with fascination. But
after a wind-shift and a second major

eruption early Sunday, it took only
one-eighth of an inch of volcanic dust
and ash, and Mount St. Helens had de
lighted them long enough.
"I'll tell you one thing." said Otis
Bouchard, a service station operator in
ash-blown Castle Rock. "I'm getting
damn tired of this mountain."
No deaths or injuries were reported
after Sunday's blast.
Yesterday's quakes, measuring less
than 3.0 on the Richter scale, appeared
to be closer to the surface than quakes
which preceded the eruption Sunday.
Magma moving
"Before the (Sunday) eruption, the
earthquakes were registering as deep
as 20 kilometers (within the volcano)."
said Don F-i nicy of the U.S. Geological
Survey. "Now they register seven
kilometers. That possibly could be an
indication that magma could be mov ing
up."
But volcanologists could olter no as*-
surance that the mountain activity
might not become a continuing if
sporadic fixture in the region.

Similarly, beleaguered state and fed
eral agencies, still gearing into massive
disaster assistance operations, are fret
ting over whether their emergency ef
forts might have to continue for de
cades.
"Are we worried? Of course we
are." said Rhonda Brooks of
Washington State's Department of
Emergency Services. "We're wonder
ing — when is all this going to end?"
No one is willing to hazard a guess,
but the closest thing to it arises from
Mount St. Helens' own most recent his
tory.
Volcanologists Dwight Crandell and
Donal Mullineaux, in a 1 97K pamphlet
batted 1000 in predicting the possibil
ity of an eruption before the end of this
century.

Autopsies
In related news, autopsies on six per
sons found at least 10 miles trom
Mount St. Helens after its initial erup
tion show they did not die of burns hut
suffocated on ash and gas that poured
out of the volcano.
King County Medical Examiner Dr.
John Eisele said in Seattle that autop
sies performed Sunday indicated the
victims might have either breathed the
choking dust or been smothered under
it.
"A few breaths would be sufficient
to explain the findings," Eisele said.
"We can't tell if the victims were con
scious or how long they survived.,
Smoke inhalation
"There are burns, hut no blast or
explosion-type injuries. It appears to
have been . . . more like smoke inhala
tion from a house fire.
