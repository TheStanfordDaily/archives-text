# Volcano activity threat continues

PORTLAND, Ore. — Thoroughly
dusted and disgusted, virtually the en
tire Pacific Northwest awoke yesterday
to a dawning awareness that life under
the volcano — for months, years, even
decades — may be less predictable, less
comfortable, less safe.
Major population centers west of er
ratic Mount St. Helens were thrown
into disorder Sunday by an unexpected
but mild taste of its violence. And yes
terday, several small earthquakes dis
turbed the otherwise quiet volcano,
suggesting that molten rock may be
moving up through the mountain
again, scientists said.
Molten rock reaching the top of the
mountain produced the huge explosion
May IN which killed at least 21 people
and left 76 missing.
Second eruption
Since its deadly explosion, a week
and a half ago. residents of unscathed
Western cities had watched the moun
tain's behavior with fascination. But
after a wind-shift and a second major

eruption early Sunday, it took only
one-eighth of an inch of volcanic dust
and ash, and Mount St. Helens had de
lighted them long enough.
"I'll tell you one thing." said Otis
Bouchard, a service station operator in
ash-blown Castle Rock. "I'm getting
damn tired of this mountain."
No deaths or injuries were reported
after Sunday's blast.
Yesterday's quakes, measuring less
than 3.0 on the Richter scale, appeared
to be closer to the surface than quakes
which preceded the eruption Sunday.
Magma moving
"Before the (Sunday) eruption, the
earthquakes were registering as deep
as 20 kilometers (within the volcano)."
said Don F-i nicy of the U.S. Geological
Survey. "Now they register seven
kilometers. That possibly could be an
indication that magma could be mov ing
up."
But volcanologists could olter no as*-
surance that the mountain activity
might not become a continuing if
sporadic fixture in the region.

Similarly, beleaguered state and fed
eral agencies, still gearing into massive
disaster assistance operations, are fret
ting over whether their emergency ef
forts might have to continue for de
cades.
"Are we worried? Of course we
are." said Rhonda Brooks of
Washington State's Department of
Emergency Services. "We're wonder
ing — when is all this going to end?"
No one is willing to hazard a guess,
but the closest thing to it arises from
Mount St. Helens' own most recent his
tory.
Volcanologists Dwight Crandell and
Donal Mullineaux, in a 1 97K pamphlet
batted 1000 in predicting the possibil
ity of an eruption before the end of this
century.
Danfage costs
Quite aside from any future erup
tions. the effects of what has already
happened are staggeringly high —
damage assessments soared to $1.6
billion yetsterday — and are still rising.
