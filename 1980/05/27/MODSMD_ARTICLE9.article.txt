### Rose Chan Staff Writer 
Resident fellows for 10 dormitories
here have been selected for next year.
Eight first-timers will join the system,
and two current resident fellows will
shift to new assignments, according to
Assistant Dean of Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
residential education, said that faculty
members showed more interest in the
resident fellow program this year than
last.
According to Supton, one of the
main reasons faculty members choose
to become resident fellows is greater
interaction with students.
"They (the resident fellows) get a
real kick out of the energy in the
houses and enjoy being able to partici
pate with the students in activities," she
said.
Kathy Mack, the new fellow for
Serra house in Stern Hall, said she
wanted to be a resident fellow because
her job as a clinical instructor at the
Law School has not involved her with
students as much as she would like.
In selecting resident fellows, "the
preference is for members of the

Academic Council — that is, people
with an assistant professor status or
more than that." said Supton." We also
have worked successfully with mem
bers of the senior staff, such as (Dean
of Admissions) Fred Hargadon and
(Registrar) Sally Mahoney, who have
deep knowledge of the University's
policies and resources and who have
direct interaction with students," she
added.
Mahoney will be the new resident
fellow for Larkin house in Stern Hall.
Steve Ferruolo, the new fellow for
Rinconada house in Wilbur Hall, said
he felt that a better sense of student
interests and activities would help him
become a more active participant in the
clhssroom.
Ferruolo, an assistant professor in
history, moved here with wife Karen
McLaughlin in September and expects
the job to help acquaint him with Stan
ford.
"It's important for a teacher to be
involved both in and out of the clas
sroom. My experience as an under
graduate suggests that so much of
what's really important takes place
within the university but not in the con
fines of the classroom,", Ferrfiolo

explained.
He said he is encouraged by his per
ception that students here want a dorm
to he more than a place to live, and he is
challenged by his feeling that residen
tial education hasn't been working very
well.
"What's needed maybe is some new
ways of doing things; a new balance of
social and academic or maybe more in
formal contacts," said Ferruolo.
Ferruolo and McLaughlin will work
next year with Otero's fellows. Bill and
Sheila Weber, in an experimental
joint-dorm program for Rinconada
and Otero. Rinconada will have two
floors of men and one of women and
Otero will have the reverse; two floors
of women and one of men. The two
residences will combine activities
under a joint-dorm program.
Ferruolo said he is looking forward
to working with freshmen. "They have
less set ideas as to what a resident fel
low does or what a dorm is or would
be," he said.
Kathleen Namphy, new fellow for
Madera, agreed. "I really enjoy
freshmen. I like their eagerness and en
thusiasm," said Namphy, who teaches
in the Western Culture program.

Faculty members take the job for
other reasons as well. It may fit well
into personal or family plans for a
period of time, and it offers the con
venience of on-campus living. There is
also financial benefit from meals pro
vided by Food Service and free living
arrangements.
"Some resident fellows have a view
of resident fel lowing as something im
portant to them, but not something
they would like to do all the time,"
Supton said.
"They see themselves leaving for
awhile and coming back. That's some
thing we would like to encourage, so
that we have experienced people and
new blood at the same time." she ad
ded.
Asst. Prof. Art Pacheco of the
School of Education, next year's resi
dent fellow at Zapata, is one such re
turnee. Asst. Prof. Gregson Davis of
the classics and English departments
will re-enter fhe program as Toyon's
fellow.
Supton said that Residential Educa
tion prefers people who have a teach
ing relationship with students, because
"we want residences to be seen as set
tings for educational programs. It's
likely that the resident fellow will be
seen by students in his teaching capac
ity. Also, students would have the be
nefit of knowing the faculty member in
a way that often is not available."
Law instructor Mack presents a twist
to this usual interchange. Mack origi
nally was offered a position at Donner,
but refused an all-freshmen dorm be
cause she felt her lack of knowledge
about Stanford made her unqualified
for such an assignment. Considering
herself a lawyer rather than a teacher,
she said, "I felt what I had to offer was

really for people who were thinking of
getting out of Stanford — up
perclassmen. I'm really pleased to have
Serra (a four-class dorm in Stern
Hall)."
Other newly assigned resident fel
lows are Joan and Tom Darling, who
will he in Arroyo, in Wilbur Hall. Joan
Darling teaches in the Human Biology
program and Tom Darling is a post
doctoral fellow in neurobiology.
Michael Carter, who heads the Struc
tured Liberal Education program, has
been assigned to Donner and Assoc.
Prof, of history Kennell Jackson, cur
rently in Serra. will move to Branner
Hall next vear.
