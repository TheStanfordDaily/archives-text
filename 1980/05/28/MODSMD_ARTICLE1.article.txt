# Row office report
## Zete suspension recommended 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
Acting Row Director Diana
Conklin recommended Tuesday
that Zeta Psi residential
privileges he suspended for three
years.
In a report to Assoc. Dean for
Residential Education Norm
Robinson. Conklin said she "ran
out of optimism." and cited inci
dents of community vandalism,
damages to the house and prob
lems with debt repayment.
"I have vet to see any hard
clear evidence that they under
stand how to govern them
selves." she said.
"We're not talking about
sporadic incidents. There has
been consistent and chronic theft
within the house and in the
community." said Conklin. '"I
saw no hope for change."
Robinson told the Dail\ today
he is "inclined to accept" her re

commendation.
Robinson said that last Feb
ruary he issued the Zetes "one
final warning that they knew was
final." Conklin said that it was
"absolutely unambiguous" that
continued "unacceptable be
havior" would result in the
likelihood that a new group
would occupy the house next
year.
"The whole house doesn't
think it's a proper or justified
move by the University." com
mented Scott Pederson. Zete
house president. "They're kick
ing us off for the acts of four
pledges."
Responding to the charge that
the House disobeyed the Uni
versity directive. Pederson said
that "since February 4. no active
member has v andali/ed anything
in the outside community. Four
pledges stole some bamboo, but
they are not active members; we

can't take 17 pledges and lead
them bv the hand. This is unfor
tunate and we don't condone it.
It will ne\ er happen again â€” the
IFC passed a resolution stating
this."
Conklin s recommendation
states that historically, Zete trad
itions result in destructive inci
dents. "We've asked them re
peatedly to change," she main
tained.
Although she said she "ap
preciated efforts by Zete mem
bers" to come in and talk about
the problems, "each year we get
reassurances from house leaders
and nothing is done."
Robinson has given the house
until Monday to submit any
materials on their behalf. The
house is working on a five-page
proposal "instituting new con
cepts in the house to make sure it
doesn't happen again." said
Pederson.

"We're throwing out certain
traditions like the luau. We'll be
a more organized house, with
more structure." he added.
The IFC (Inter-Fraternity
Council) met last night to discuss
Conklin's recommendation and
Zete actions.
"The Zetes have a problem
and they shouldn't be allowed to
continue in the pattern they've
set. liyt the answer is not putting
the whole house into the draw
next year," said John Kinney,
past IFC president.
"Any 'all or nothing' solution
on the part of the University is
uncompromising, unfair and in
effective. There should he a re
sponsible and self-motivated
punishment lev ied by the Arbit
ration Committee and the Zetes:
it's the only fair way to deal with
the problem." he added.
The Zetes have already
adopted two measures addres

sine problems of leadership in
the house. A pledge liaison was
appointed and one faculty and
one alumnus were chosen to
come to meetings.
"This is really unique that
they've taken action upon them
selves." said Kinney. Additional
measures suggested by house
members to the II C included a
social probation for at least one
quarter; weekly reports to the
Arbitration Committee: instiga
tion of community service pro
jects: and immediate suspension
of any member responsible for
damage or theft to, or outside,
the house. These recommenda
tions will toj.' discussed at a com
mittee meeting this afternoon.
Robinson is conferring with
both Conklin and Dean of Stu
dent Affairs Jim Lyons. A final
decision will be made early next
week.
