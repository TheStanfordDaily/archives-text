# Students from Northwest besieged with 'ash-grams'
## 
### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
While the Bay area has man
aged to avoid the de\ astatine ef
fects of Mount St. Helens' recent
ash eruptions, many students
here are concerned about
families and friends in their
Northwest homes. Care pac
kages filled with \ olcanic ash and
newspaper clippings are com
mon sights m the post office
boxes of students from the areas
in Washington and Oregon that
were hit by the ash.
"I got pictures from home yes
terday," saiiHngrid Holmlund.a
junior from Spokane, Wash.
"Nobody seems to know what is
going on. For example, first they
told everybody to wash oft their
cars to get rid of the ash, then
they found out that washing the
ash with water turned it into sul
furic acid, so they had to stop,"
Holmlund said.
'Burned out'
Ann Miller, a sophomore from
Portland, Ore., said that her fam
ily is tired of being inconveni
enced by the ash, which coated
the city in a one-half-inch layer
for several days. "The excite
ment wore oil quickly, although
there hasn't been that much of a
problem in Portland," Miller
said. "Officials are advising
people to drive about 15 miles
per hour on city streets, and it is
suggested that everyone wash off
the ash from the paws of their
pets', but the rain has washed
away most ol the ash from the
area," Miller explained.
Many students say they have
not received mail fnyn home, as
many post offices in eastern
Washington were closed during
the initial disaster period, and
some students say they were
worried it might take days to re
ceive needed funds from home.
Also some students say because
some roads have been closed,
driving home at the end ol this

quarter will be difficult, if not
impossible.
Oops ruined
The devastation to crops in the
eastern Washington area is of
concern to the families of many
students. "Farmers are saying
that the best thing that could
happen is rain to help their crops
combat the ash. but this won't
happen this time of the year."
said junior Laura Bean, a
philosophy major from Rich
land, Washington. "Richland is
in a desert, and farmers who arc
concerned about apple, peach
and asparagus crops will just
have to t ind other solutions." she
added.
Spokane. Washington, about
350 miles east of the volcanic
mountain, has been one of the
areas hardest hit by the ash de
posits. In fact. Seattle residents
at the opposite end ol the state
are teasingly calling Spokane.
" Ash-kane."
"People have been advised
not to go outside at all. said
C'indy Stark, a junior from
Spokane. "A lot of people are
wearing goggles and masks and
you just can't drive more than
I 00 miles before you have to re
place your oil and air filters," she
added.
Kngine blow-outs
Six city buses in Spokane have
blown their engines as city offi
cials seek to maintain a minimum
of public transportation, accord
ing to Stark. ( ity schools did not
reopen until Tuesday of this
week after being closed for more
than a week.
In spite ol the problems, many
people have been able to find
humor in the situation.
Holmlund noted that one
Spokane bank has posted a sign
outside its doors which reads,
"lor security reasons, please
remove your mask," and her
mother told her that her black
cat must be vacuumed to get rid

of ash it collected outside.
Stark said that the biggest
problem is that the ash is messy.
"It's not like snow, and it's not
like a dust storm; it's just
bizarre," she said.
Many effects of the ash were
not expected. For example, one
student noted that the stores are
almost sold out ol sanitary nap
kins because people are using
them as wrap-around protection
for their oil filters.
Happier here
While Bean said she was "dis
appointed"' that her home town
ol Richland wasn't harder hit by
the ash — making for more ex
citement — most students say
they are happy to be on campus
rather than at home.
"I'm glad that I'm here so that
I don't have to stop doing things
while things settle down." said
