# In contrast to some other institutions
## Central development office key to program here 
### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
With literally millions of dol
lars at stake, organization
within any university's develop
ment department is critical. The
University deals with this crucial
problem of fundraising
philosophy by operating a cen
tralized Office of Development
as clearinghouse tor all outside
funding needs within the Univer
sity.
Proposals for new projects
that will require soliciting out
side funds all move through the
University's central Develop
ment Office before any action is
taken.
Stanford's philosophy differs
from that at many comparable
institutions, most notably peren
nial fundraising leader Harvard.
But according to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, the system has
kept the University running a
strong second for some time.
"The judgment is that we do
better, all things considered,
when we work with an or
ganized. orderly plan." said Joel
Smith. \ ice president for de
velopment here.
Centralization means that
money-seeking efforts through
out the University are coordi
nated. and all fundraising is un
dertaken in the name of the en
tire University.
This does not mean that vari
ous departments have no au
tonomy in development pro
jects.
t t You need to separate two
1 things. We are exceed
ingly decentralized as far as aspi
rations bubbling up all over the
University, but these aspirations
do not all turn into fundraising
programs." said Smith.
The purpose of centralization
is two-fold, according to Fulton.
first, it helps avoid "milking"
the wrong source for funds, he
said. As Development Office
staff assigned to a project be
come more familiar with its
specifics, thev are able to draw

on their experience to identity
potential donors who would he
interested in 112 unding a particular
program, said Fulton.
"When we do ha\ e a prospec
tive donor who we know has a
large capacity to donate, we do
look for University needs that
would he ot specific interest to
that donor. And sometimes it's
an exploring process. It's possi
ble that we might put before this
person three or four brief de
scriptions ot major gilt needs."
he said.
Once sources arc identified,
the Development Office works
with the fund seekers to prepare
a proposal to be submitted to a
potential donor. The office
might also arrange some meet
ings between the head ot the
fundraising project and the head
of the potential donor group.
Second, coordination is neces

sary to avoid repeated solicita
tion of one individual or founda
tion. That does happen in an or
ganization that is decentralized,
said Fulton.
Which proposals ultimately
turn into development ef
forts is a decision under the au
thority of the provost, who is
charged with ordering priorities
among the University's heeds.
As a proposal is submitted.
Smith meets with Provost
Donald Kennedy to decide
whether to "give it a shot," said
Smith. Kennedy is the expert on
the academic component, while
Smith specializes in the fundrais
ing possibilities. "We're an am
bitious place. If there's a reason
able chance, we go lor it."
However, there are those who
disagree with some priority deci
sions made. Others feel cramped

by the authority of the De
velopment Office.
"I'm gratified that there's not
more dissent than there is. There
is some, and 1 don't know of any
system that could eliminate it.
We just hope for understanding
that we're all going to benefit in
the long run." said Smith.
"Questions are asked and
challenges are made, but an ex
planation submitted to all parties
is usually sufficient." he said.
"But I don't want to give the im
pression that no one ever expres
ses disappointment."
"We fight for priorities here,
but I'd rather have it decided in a
meeting than go right to the
donor and have him decide bet
ween projects. He may well de
cide not to give at all it he feels
threatened." said Doug Single,
associate athletic director forde
v elopment.

46 T can't imagine having an
A argument with someone in
another department over fun
draising. because we know (the
decisions are) over our heads, at
the vice presidential level." said
Single, who directs one of the
larger fundraising programs
within the University.
Centralization here does not
mean that the party seeking
funds does not take an active role
in the effort, said Fulton.
No such role exists at some in
stitutions* such as Notre Dame,
where the development office it
self conducts all of the universi
ty's fundraising activities, ac
cording to that school's As
sociate Vice President for Public
Relations and Development
James Murphy.
In contrast, some faculty here
are quite active in fundraising.
