# In contrast to some other institutions
## Central development office key to program here 
### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
With literally millions of dol
lars at stake, organization
within any university's develop
ment department is critical. The
University deals with this crucial
problem of fundraising
philosophy by operating a cen
tralized Office of Development
as clearinghouse tor all outside
funding needs within the Univer
sity.
Proposals for new projects
that will require soliciting out
side funds all move through the
University's central Develop
ment Office before any action is
taken.
Stanford's philosophy differs
from that at many comparable
institutions, most notably peren
nial fundraising leader Harvard.
But according to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, the system has
kept the University running a
strong second for some time.
"The judgment is that we do
better, all things considered,
when we work with an or
ganized. orderly plan." said Joel
Smith. \ ice president for de
velopment here.
Centralization means that
money-seeking efforts through
out the University are coordi
nated. and all fundraising is un
dertaken in the name of the en
tire University.
This does not mean that vari
ous departments have no au
tonomy in development pro
jects.
t t You need to separate two
1 things. We are exceed
ingly decentralized as far as aspi
rations bubbling up all over the
University, but these aspirations
do not all turn into fundraising
programs." said Smith.
The purpose of centralization
is two-fold, according to Fulton.
first, it helps avoid "milking"
the wrong source for funds, he
said. As Development Office
staff assigned to a project be
come more familiar with its
specifics, thev are able to draw

on their experience to identity
potential donors who would he
interested in 112 unding a particular
program, said Fulton.
"When we do ha\ e a prospec
tive donor who we know has a
large capacity to donate, we do
look for University needs that
would he ot specific interest to
that donor. And sometimes it's
an exploring process. It's possi
ble that we might put before this
person three or four brief de
scriptions ot major gilt needs."
he said.
Once sources arc identified,
the Development Office works
with the fund seekers to prepare
a proposal to be submitted to a
potential donor. The office
might also arrange some meet
ings between the head ot the
fundraising project and the head
of the potential donor group.
Second, coordination is neces

sary to avoid repeated solicita
tion of one individual or founda
tion. That does happen in an or
ganization that is decentralized,
said Fulton.
Which proposals ultimately
turn into development ef
forts is a decision under the au
thority of the provost, who is
charged with ordering priorities
among the University's heeds.
As a proposal is submitted.
Smith meets with Provost
Donald Kennedy to decide
whether to "give it a shot," said
Smith. Kennedy is the expert on
the academic component, while
Smith specializes in the fundrais
ing possibilities. "We're an am
bitious place. If there's a reason
able chance, we go lor it."
However, there are those who
disagree with some priority deci
sions made. Others feel cramped

by the authority of the De
velopment Office.
"I'm gratified that there's not
more dissent than there is. There
is some, and 1 don't know of any
system that could eliminate it.
We just hope for understanding
that we're all going to benefit in
the long run." said Smith.
"Questions are asked and
challenges are made, but an ex
planation submitted to all parties
is usually sufficient." he said.
"But I don't want to give the im
pression that no one ever expres
ses disappointment."
"We fight for priorities here,
but I'd rather have it decided in a
meeting than go right to the
donor and have him decide bet
ween projects. He may well de
cide not to give at all it he feels
threatened." said Doug Single,
associate athletic director forde
v elopment.

46 T can't imagine having an
A argument with someone in
another department over fun
draising. because we know (the
decisions are) over our heads, at
the vice presidential level." said
Single, who directs one of the
larger fundraising programs
within the University.
Centralization here does not
mean that the party seeking
funds does not take an active role
in the effort, said Fulton.
No such role exists at some in
stitutions* such as Notre Dame,
where the development office it
self conducts all of the universi
ty's fundraising activities, ac
cording to that school's As
sociate Vice President for Public
Relations and Development
James Murphy.
In contrast, some faculty here
are quite active in fundraising.
with permission of the De
velopment Office.
"There are lots of faculty who
are very entrepreneurial who do
a lot of fundraising on their own,
but that does not mean that we
(thL 4 Development Office) are
not involved," said Fulton. '* .
"Normally (seeking funds) is
pretty much my initiative," said
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a driving
force behind the Art Depart
ment's efforts to bring outdoor
sculpture, such as Albers' Wall,
to the University.
L L ' I lie Development Office's
X only involvement is in
making sure that we don't get
our wires crossed," said Elsen.
He said that, for the most part,
he goes out and finds his own
sources and then just clears them
with the administration.
"A number of times I have
found prospective donors and
was told that the University al
ready has connections with that
specific donor. That's just the
procedure that's followed." he
said.
Elsen praised the system as
"good in principle."
"I think it's a good thing, be
cause there are a lot of people

who are interested (for example)
only in the Art Museum and
would resent being pressured
into donating to other prog
rams," he said.
Some fund seekers are less en
thusiastic about the succcss of
centralization. One faculty
member, who asked not to be
named, said trying to introduce a
program for sponsorship of
graduate work has prov en a very
"frustrating experience."
"Government training sup
port (which can be sought inde
pendently of the Development
Office) is cyclical at best. I would
like for us as a department to
have a stable source of funds for
graduate support. That would
free us from the whims of I / 1
funding," he said.
The major problem, according
to the professor, is the reluctance
of the Development Office to
allow departments to contact
sources independently.
t w ' I Mi ere is nothing to prevent
A us from going outside. It
would just antagonize the De
velopment Office. Personally, I
would not mind doing it, but at
the department level we're less
willing to do she said, adding
that some departments do eir

cumvent central approval for
fundraising.
Smith said his office has no
way of knowing how many such
unapproved fundraising efforts
are in operation.
"If the purpose for which the
department sought to raise funds
was not approved by the Pro
vost's office, then we're not au
thorized to do anything about
it." said Fulton.
Smith added that such unap
proved programs are almost en
tirely innocent, resulting from
involved parties not fully under
standing I'diversity policy
"We think we've de
monstrated that a centralized,
coordinated ; >ro<:ram 1 mkv The
results . . .k ! uidly 'early
lor themselves. he said
"The in-i step would be to
show the, rid seekers) that
they'll do . rvv nkiiig with
the team Mm M all these prob
lems are o ivcted through per
suasion." I
Single described an instance
where the team concept was
of mutual benefit to both the
Development Office and the
Athletic Department.
"It was the success of athletic
teams that helped pull Stanford

tundraising through the years of
student unrest. At the same time,
when we've had some had athle
tic years, the Development Of
fice helped pull us through."
Single admits that central di
rection on what sources to solicit
probably limits the Athletic De
partment's prospect body. But
even so. he says, there are far
more pros than cons.
Still, some wish they could get
out and meet their needs on then
own.
"I understand their (the De
velopment Office's) reasons for
protecting their sources."' said
the unidentified faculty member,
but he added that it is frustrating
to be denied access to thos
sources in order to gain suppoi'
for .1 project he feels is equally
important as some projects now
authorized to seek funds, espe
cially similar proposals.
Smith admitted that all I ni
versity needs could never be til
led. but reiterated his conviction
that there is no better way to
satisfy the most possible needs.
•'I think that at the Develop
ment Office here you get a
chance to make your case. But
I've never seen anyone particu
larly upset. You just defer to
other needs." said Single.

within the University.
Centralization here does not
mean that the party seeking
funds does not take an active role
in the effort, said Fulton.
No such role exists at some in
stitutions* such as Notre Dame,
where the development office it
self conducts all of the universi

cording to that school's As

Relations and Development
James Murphy.
In contrast, some faculty here
are quite active in fundraising.
with permission of the De
velopment Office.
"There are lots of faculty who
are very entrepreneurial who do
a lot of fundraising on their own,
but that does not mean that we
(thL 4 Development Office) are
not involved," said Fulton. '* .
"Normally (seeking funds) is
pretty much my initiative," said
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a driving
force behind the Art Depart
ment's efforts to bring outdoor
sculpture, such as Albers' Wall,
to the University.
L L ' I lie Development Office's
X only involvement is in
making sure that we don't get
our wires crossed," said Elsen.
He said that, for the most part,
he goes out and finds his own
sources and then just clears them
with the administration.
"A number of times I have
found prospective donors and
was told that the University al
ready has connections with that
specific donor. That's just the
procedure that's followed." he
said.
Elsen praised the system as
"good in principle."
"I think it's a good thing, be
cause there are a lot of people

who are interested (for example)
only in the Art Museum and
would resent being pressured
into donating to other prog
rams," he said.
Some fund seekers are less en
thusiastic about the succcss of
centralization. One faculty
member, who asked not to be
named, said trying to introduce a
program for sponsorship of
graduate work has prov en a very
"frustrating experience."
"Government training sup
port (which can be sought inde
pendently of the Development
Office) is cyclical at best. I would
like for us as a department to
have a stable source of funds for
graduate support. That would
free us from the whims of I / 1
funding," he said.
The major problem, according
to the professor, is the reluctance
of the Development Office to
allow departments to contact
sources independently.
t w ' I Mi ere is nothing to prevent
A us from going outside. It
would just antagonize the De
velopment Office. Personally, I
would not mind doing it, but at
the department level we're less
willing to do she said, adding
that some departments do eir

cumvent central approval for
fundraising.
Smith said his office has no
way of knowing how many such
unapproved fundraising efforts
are in operation.
"If the purpose for which the
department sought to raise funds
was not approved by the Pro
vost's office, then we're not au
thorized to do anything about
it." said Fulton.
Smith added that such unap
proved programs are almost en
tirely innocent, resulting from
involved parties not fully under
standing I'diversity policy
"We think we've de
monstrated that a centralized,
coordinated ; >ro<:ram 1 mkv The

Single described an instance
where the team concept was
of mutual benefit to both the
Development Office and the
Athletic Department.
"It was the success of athletic
teams that helped pull Stanford

tundraising through the years of
student unrest. At the same time,
when we've had some had athle
tic years, the Development Of
fice helped pull us through."
Single admits that central di
rection on what sources to solicit
probably limits the Athletic De
partment's prospect body. But
even so. he says, there are far
more pros than cons.
Still, some wish they could get
out and meet their needs on then
own.
"I understand their (the De
velopment Office's) reasons for
protecting their sources."' said
the unidentified faculty member,
but he added that it is frustrating
to be denied access to thos
sources in order to gain suppoi'
for .1 project he feels is equally
important as some projects now
authorized to seek funds, espe
cially similar proposals.
Smith admitted that all I ni
versity needs could never be til
led. but reiterated his conviction
that there is no better way to
satisfy the most possible needs.
•'I think that at the Develop
ment Office here you get a
chance to make your case. But
I've never seen anyone particu
larly upset. You just defer to
other needs." said Single.
With literally millions of dol
lars at stake, organization
within any university's develop
ment department is critical. The
University deals with this crucial
problem of fundraising
philosophy by operating a cen
tralized Office of Development
as clearinghouse tor all outside
funding needs within the Univer
sity.
Proposals for new projects
that will require soliciting out
side funds all move through the
University's central Develop
ment Office before any action is
taken.
Stanford's philosophy differs
from that at many comparable
institutions, most notably peren
nial fundraising leader Harvard.
But according to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, the system has
kept the University running a
strong second for some time.
"The judgment is that we do
better, all things considered,
when we work with an or
ganized. orderly plan." said Joel
Smith. \ ice president for de
velopment here.
Centralization means that
money-seeking efforts through
out the University are coordi
nated. and all fundraising is un
dertaken in the name of the en
tire University.
This does not mean that vari
ous departments have no au
tonomy in development pro
jects.
t t You need to separate two
1 things. We are exceed
ingly decentralized as far as aspi
rations bubbling up all over the
University, but these aspirations
do not all turn into fundraising
programs." said Smith.
The purpose of centralization
is two-fold, according to Fulton.
first, it helps avoid "milking"
the wrong source for funds, he
said. As Development Office
staff assigned to a project be
come more familiar with its
specifics, thev are able to draw

on their experience to identity
potential donors who would he
interested in 112 unding a particular
program, said Fulton.
"When we do ha\ e a prospec
tive donor who we know has a
large capacity to donate, we do
look for University needs that
would he ot specific interest to
that donor. And sometimes it's
an exploring process. It's possi
ble that we might put before this
person three or four brief de
scriptions ot major gilt needs."
he said.
Once sources arc identified,
the Development Office works
with the fund seekers to prepare
a proposal to be submitted to a
potential donor. The office
might also arrange some meet
ings between the head ot the
fundraising project and the head
of the potential donor group.
Second, coordination is neces

sary to avoid repeated solicita
tion of one individual or founda
tion. That does happen in an or
ganization that is decentralized,
said Fulton.
Which proposals ultimately
turn into development ef
forts is a decision under the au
thority of the provost, who is
charged with ordering priorities
among the University's heeds.
As a proposal is submitted.
Smith meets with Provost
Donald Kennedy to decide
whether to "give it a shot," said
Smith. Kennedy is the expert on
the academic component, while
Smith specializes in the fundrais
ing possibilities. "We're an am
bitious place. If there's a reason
able chance, we go lor it."
However, there are those who
disagree with some priority deci
sions made. Others feel cramped

by the authority of the De
velopment Office.
"I'm gratified that there's not
more dissent than there is. There

of the Development Office to
allow departments to contact
sources independently.
t w ' I Mi ere is nothing to prevent
A us from going outside. It
would just antagonize the De
velopment Office. Personally, I
would not mind doing it, but at
the department level we're less
willing to do she said, adding
that some departments do eir

cumvent central approval for
fundraising.
Smith said his office has no
way of knowing how many such
unapproved fundraising efforts
are in operation.
"If the purpose for which the
department sought to raise funds
was not approved by the Pro
vost's office, then we're not au
thorized to do anything about
it." said Fulton.
Smith added that such unap
proved programs are almost en
tirely innocent, resulting from
involved parties not fully under
standing I'diversity policy

Single described an instance
where the team concept was
of mutual benefit to both the
Development Office and the
Athletic Department.
"It was the success of athletic
teams that helped pull Stanford

tundraising through the years of
student unrest. At the same time,
when we've had some had athle
tic years, the Development Of
fice helped pull us through."
Single admits that central di
rection on what sources to solicit
probably limits the Athletic De
partment's prospect body. But
even so. he says, there are far
more pros than cons.
Still, some wish they could get
out and meet their needs on then
own.
"I understand their (the De
velopment Office's) reasons for
protecting their sources."' said
the unidentified faculty member,
but he added that it is frustrating
to be denied access to thos
sources in order to gain suppoi'
for .1 project he feels is equally
important as some projects now
authorized to seek funds, espe
cially similar proposals.
Smith admitted that all I ni
versity needs could never be til
led. but reiterated his conviction
that there is no better way to
satisfy the most possible needs.
•'I think that at the Develop
ment Office here you get a
chance to make your case. But
I've never seen anyone particu
larly upset. You just defer to
other needs." said Single.
With literally millions of dol
lars at stake, organization
within any university's develop
ment department is critical. The
University deals with this crucial
problem of fundraising
philosophy by operating a cen
tralized Office of Development
as clearinghouse tor all outside
funding needs within the Univer
sity.
Proposals for new projects
that will require soliciting out
side funds all move through the
University's central Develop
ment Office before any action is
taken.
Stanford's philosophy differs
from that at many comparable
institutions, most notably peren
nial fundraising leader Harvard.
But according to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, the system has
kept the University running a
strong second for some time.
"The judgment is that we do
better, all things considered,
when we work with an or
ganized. orderly plan." said Joel
Smith. \ ice president for de
velopment here.
Centralization means that
money-seeking efforts through
out the University are coordi
nated. and all fundraising is un
dertaken in the name of the en
tire University.
This does not mean that vari
ous departments have no au
tonomy in development pro
jects.
t t You need to separate two
1 things. We are exceed
ingly decentralized as far as aspi
rations bubbling up all over the
University, but these aspirations
do not all turn into fundraising
programs." said Smith.
The purpose of centralization
is two-fold, according to Fulton.
first, it helps avoid "milking"
the wrong source for funds, he
said. As Development Office
staff assigned to a project be
come more familiar with its
specifics, thev are able to draw

on their experience to identity
potential donors who would he
interested in 112 unding a particular
program, said Fulton.
"When we do ha\ e a prospec
tive donor who we know has a
large capacity to donate, we do
look for University needs that
would he ot specific interest to
that donor. And sometimes it's
an exploring process. It's possi
ble that we might put before this
person three or four brief de
scriptions ot major gilt needs."
he said.
Once sources arc identified,
the Development Office works
with the fund seekers to prepare
a proposal to be submitted to a
potential donor. The office
might also arrange some meet
ings between the head ot the
fundraising project and the head
of the potential donor group.
Second, coordination is neces

sary to avoid repeated solicita
tion of one individual or founda
tion. That does happen in an or
ganization that is decentralized,
said Fulton.
Which proposals ultimately
turn into development ef
forts is a decision under the au
thority of the provost, who is
charged with ordering priorities
among the University's heeds.
As a proposal is submitted.
Smith meets with Provost
Donald Kennedy to decide
whether to "give it a shot," said
Smith. Kennedy is the expert on
the academic component, while
Smith specializes in the fundrais
ing possibilities. "We're an am
bitious place. If there's a reason
able chance, we go lor it."
However, there are those who
disagree with some priority deci
sions made. Others feel cramped

by the authority of the De
velopment Office.
"I'm gratified that there's not
more dissent than there is. There
is some, and 1 don't know of any
system that could eliminate it.
We just hope for understanding
that we're all going to benefit in
the long run." said Smith.
"Questions are asked and
challenges are made, but an ex
planation submitted to all parties
is usually sufficient." he said.
"But I don't want to give the im
pression that no one ever expres
ses disappointment."
"We fight for priorities here,
but I'd rather have it decided in a
meeting than go right to the
donor and have him decide bet
ween projects. He may well de
cide not to give at all it he feels
threatened." said Doug Single,
associate athletic director forde
v elopment.

46 T can't imagine having an
A argument with someone in
another department over fun
draising. because we know (the
decisions are) over our heads, at
the vice presidential level." said
Single, who directs one of the
larger fundraising programs
within the University.
Centralization here does not
mean that the party seeking
funds does not take an active role
in the effort, said Fulton.
No such role exists at some in
stitutions* such as Notre Dame,
where the development office it
self conducts all of the universi
ty's fundraising activities, ac
cording to that school's As
sociate Vice President for Public
Relations and Development
James Murphy.
In contrast, some faculty here
are quite active in fundraising.
with permission of the De
velopment Office.
"There are lots of faculty who
are very entrepreneurial who do
a lot of fundraising on their own,
but that does not mean that we
(thL 4 Development Office) are
not involved," said Fulton. '* .
"Normally (seeking funds) is
pretty much my initiative," said
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, a driving
force behind the Art Depart
ment's efforts to bring outdoor
sculpture, such as Albers' Wall,
to the University.
L L ' I lie Development Office's
X only involvement is in
making sure that we don't get
our wires crossed," said Elsen.
He said that, for the most part,
he goes out and finds his own
sources and then just clears them
with the administration.
"A number of times I have
found prospective donors and
was told that the University al
ready has connections with that
specific donor. That's just the
procedure that's followed." he
said.
Elsen praised the system as
"good in principle."
"I think it's a good thing, be
cause there are a lot of people

who are interested (for example)
only in the Art Museum and
would resent being pressured
into donating to other prog
rams," he said.
Some fund seekers are less en
thusiastic about the succcss of
centralization. One faculty
member, who asked not to be
named, said trying to introduce a
program for sponsorship of
graduate work has prov en a very
"frustrating experience."
"Government training sup
port (which can be sought inde
pendently of the Development
Office) is cyclical at best. I would
like for us as a department to
have a stable source of funds for
graduate support. That would
free us from the whims of I / 1
funding," he said.
The major problem, according
to the professor, is the reluctance
of the Development Office to
allow departments to contact
sources independently.
