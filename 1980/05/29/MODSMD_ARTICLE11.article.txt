# Fundraising failures occur occasionally
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The variety of new structures,
which have been springing
up around campus recently,
might lead one to believe the
University has been rather suc
cessful in its fundraising efforts.
Indeed, the University re
ceiv ed more than $64 million last
year from its philanthropic
friends, or an average of
$ 175.000 per day.
But despite the seemingly end
less fountain of donated funds,
the University frequently cannot
raise all the money it needs to
improve and develop educa
tional programs and facilities on
campus.
The "funding tap" cannot
simply be turned on by the Office
of Development to 112 ill the cotters
of those responsible for imple
menting new projects.
Securing the multi-million
dollar donations so vital to the
University for development of
programs requires dogged per
sistence. uncanny timing and a
lot of luck.

According to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, "it's not a
foolproof system, but it's'the
only one we know."
While University fundraisers
do not like to admit that there is
any such thing as a fundraising
"failure." there have been in
numerable instances when the
University has not convinced
donors to contribute money lor
completion ot a specific topic.
The University has been un
able to conv inee people to
donate lor building
maintenance endowments. I ni
ton said. Income from such funds
would pay fit keep existing
facilities in top condition — a vi
tally important and expensive
cost the University must incur
a nnually.
In addition, a proposal submit
ted in the early 19705, which the
University supported, to reno
vate Building 30 of the On ad and
restore it to the state in which
students would have found it in
IS9I. did not attract sufficient
outside hacking, he said. Con

sequently. the project was
shelved.
The University does not ev en
attempt to raise money for stu
dent dormitories or street
maintenance because it doesn't
feel there are people sufficiently
interested to contribute to these
necessary projects. Fulton said.
Even high-priority projects
are not immune to fundraising
obstacles. The new Green Lib
rary. when in its planning stages,
encountered substantial funding
difficulties which required scal
ing the project down considera
bly.
The original plans for a new
Main Library called for twice as
much floor space as Green I.ib
rary now has. according to Phil
lip Leighton. then chief ot library
projects.
At lust, the education and en
gineering libraries, as well as 13
or 14 smaller branches, were to
he housed in the new building, he
said. The proposed library also
would have housed a student
lounge and snack bar. and a
cdniputer facility, Leighton said.
Kenneth C'uthbertson. then

vice president for development,
said the University had trouble
securing the large single dona
tion they felt was necessary to
begin work.
In the early 1970s the original
proposal had a price tag ot
around $20 million. The Univer
sity felt it needed a large dona
tion of half that amount — about
$1 0 or S1 2 million — but recog
nized that the University had
never before received more than
$3 million from one charitable
source. Cuthbertson said.
The Development Of 112 ice con
tinued to secure smaller dona
tions of $]()().()()() or $200.000.
but the prospects of securing a
major gift became "depressingly
worse and worse," he said.
In the mid-19705, then well
into the project planning, the
University re-evaluated the es
timated project cost and found
that, mainly due to inflation, the
price tag had soared to around
$40 million. Cuthbertson said.
"Donors don't tend to inflate
their ideas of giv ing as rapidly as
inflation." he said, consequently
the prospects of securing a gift
for half the project cost became
even less optimistic.
As a result, the University de
cided to scale the project down
and then try to raise half of the
now diminished cost.
Cuthbertson said.
In 1976. the new plan called
for expenditures totaling $20
million for renovatibn of the old

library and completion of the
new wing, Leigh ton said.
fa i 1 j vervone involved in the
J_—/planning knew we were
shooting for the moon on the
first project." Cuthbertson said.
After the project was scaled
down, planning officials were
still very enthusiastic about it.he
said. The Development Office
recognized, however, that it still
needed the large "seed gift" be-

tore the library could be con
structed. Cuthbertson said.
Development officials knew
that funds could be raised by
smaller contributions in the
$1 ()().()()() range, but it takes
many smaller contributions to
match one big gift, he said. Sec
uring the big gift is "always a
matter of luck and opportunity,"
Cuthbertson added.
There are very few donors
able or willing to give the large

gift necessary to fund such a pro
ject. he said.
"It is harder to raise money for
bricks and mortar." Cuthbertson
said. While foundations do have
the money, they usually don't
like to contribute such large
sums to building projects. The
Development Office can raise
money in smaller increments for
endowed professorships over an
extended time period, he said,
but "there is a time bind involved

in raising money for such capital
projects."
"Stanford is awfully fortunate
that (Cecil Green) came along
and donated the $6 million
needed to start the project," he
said. "There aren't that many
pockets of wealth that are
philanthropicully inclined."
He said the University never
had more than a few donors who
were potentially interested in

The new wing of Green Library, though lavishly appointed in several respects, is only about
one-half the size planners had originally proposed about a decade ago. Despite the University's
recognition that a new library was a top priority for the campus, a major gift to build the structure
could not be found. Finally, after paring the proposal by 50 percent, development officials were
able to secure a $6 million gift from Cecil Green in 1976, allowing the project to move ahead.
donating the major gift lor the
library.
II the Greens hadn't come
along to save the day, there
would have been no giving up on
the project, Cuthbertson said.
•'We would have kept banging
away at it." recognizing the fact
that the library was ;i top prior
ity. vitally important to the
school.
Although the new Green Lib
rary stands completed, the struc
ture still has not been completely
paid for.
According to Susan Ross, de
velopment officer for the lib
raries. there is still a $1.4 million
funding gap that the Uni\ ersity is
trying to close.
Donors often believe that
once a project is completed, it
has been totally funded, she said.
For this reason, it is harder to
secure gifts once a building is 111
place. Ross said.
In an effort to attract gifts, the
University is offering to name
reading areas of the new library
for donors who contribute more
than $1 00.000 to the facility. she
said.

Though the University doesn't
always get all it wants for projects,
tor the last 1 5 years it has consis
tently ranked second nationally
in its charitable receipts, Fulton
said. Only Harvard manages to
raise more charity money, he ad
ded.
Development Office officials
generally have a good idea of
what a given project's fundrais
ing potential is. Despite set
backs. the funding team has had
an excellent record of securing
donations for the many educa
tional projects the University
identifies as programmatic
priorities.
