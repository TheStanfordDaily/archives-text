# Fundraising failures occur occasionally
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The variety of new structures,
which have been springing
up around campus recently,
might lead one to believe the
University has been rather suc
cessful in its fundraising efforts.
Indeed, the University re
ceiv ed more than $64 million last
year from its philanthropic
friends, or an average of
$ 175.000 per day.
But despite the seemingly end
less fountain of donated funds,
the University frequently cannot
raise all the money it needs to
improve and develop educa
tional programs and facilities on
campus.
The "funding tap" cannot
simply be turned on by the Office
of Development to 112 ill the cotters
of those responsible for imple
menting new projects.
Securing the multi-million
dollar donations so vital to the
University for development of
programs requires dogged per
sistence. uncanny timing and a
lot of luck.

According to David Fulton,
director of development com
munications here, "it's not a
foolproof system, but it's'the
only one we know."
While University fundraisers
do not like to admit that there is
any such thing as a fundraising
"failure." there have been in
numerable instances when the
University has not convinced
donors to contribute money lor
completion ot a specific topic.
The University has been un
able to conv inee people to
donate lor building
maintenance endowments. I ni
ton said. Income from such funds
would pay fit keep existing
facilities in top condition — a vi
tally important and expensive
cost the University must incur
a nnually.
In addition, a proposal submit
ted in the early 19705, which the
University supported, to reno
vate Building 30 of the On ad and
restore it to the state in which
students would have found it in
IS9I. did not attract sufficient
outside hacking, he said. Con

sequently. the project was
shelved.
The University does not ev en
attempt to raise money for stu
dent dormitories or street
maintenance because it doesn't
feel there are people sufficiently
interested to contribute to these
necessary projects. Fulton said.
Even high-priority projects
are not immune to fundraising
obstacles. The new Green Lib
rary. when in its planning stages,
encountered substantial funding
difficulties which required scal
ing the project down considera
bly.
The original plans for a new
Main Library called for twice as
much floor space as Green I.ib
rary now has. according to Phil
lip Leighton. then chief ot library
projects.
At lust, the education and en
gineering libraries, as well as 13
or 14 smaller branches, were to
he housed in the new building, he
said. The proposed library also
would have housed a student
lounge and snack bar. and a
cdniputer facility, Leighton said.
Kenneth C'uthbertson. then

vice president for development,
said the University had trouble
securing the large single dona
tion they felt was necessary to
begin work.
In the early 1970s the original
proposal had a price tag ot
around $20 million. The Univer
sity felt it needed a large dona
tion of half that amount — about
$1 0 or S1 2 million — but recog
nized that the University had
never before received more than
$3 million from one charitable
source. Cuthbertson said.
The Development Of 112 ice con
tinued to secure smaller dona
tions of $]()().()()() or $200.000.
but the prospects of securing a
major gift became "depressingly
worse and worse," he said.
In the mid-19705, then well
into the project planning, the
University re-evaluated the es
timated project cost and found
that, mainly due to inflation, the
price tag had soared to around
$40 million. Cuthbertson said.
"Donors don't tend to inflate
their ideas of giv ing as rapidly as
