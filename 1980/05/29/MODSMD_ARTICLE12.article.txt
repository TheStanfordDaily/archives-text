# A 						man of 'integrity and conviction
## Cuthbertson energized Stanford fundraising 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
The University's success in fundraising in recent
years may lead some to associate the idea of
"development" with images of multi-zeroed checks
(lowing into the University accounts. It is easy to lose
sight ot the fact that those funds don't simply appear;
people must work hard to raise them.
In fact, for many years the development staff here
had a difficult time securing outside funding for Uni
versity programs.
The problems were due. in part, to Leland Stan
ford's proud attitude that the Stanford family could
always provide for the University's financial needs.
This not only brought Stanford into the fundraising
game late, but it also meant the University had to
overcome its self-sufficient image.
However, two major fund drives — the PACE
(Plan for a Changing Era) campaign in the early
1960s which raised $114 million, and the Campaign
for Stanford, which Irom 1972-77 raised $300 mill
ion — reversed Stanford's legacy and brought the
Univ ersitv to the number two position in annual gifts
received, second only to Harvard.
The man who headed these campaigns and who
played a major role in transforming the University
into a top contender for the fundraising dollar is
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
He no longer administers the hundreds of millions
of dollars he helped raise here before retiring as vice
president for development in 1977. In fact, he now
Mts on the other side of the fence as administrative
vice president for the philanthropic James Irvine
Foundation in San Francisco.
Now when Cuthbertson, 61. leaves his Saratoga
home every morning, he looks forward to a day of
gi\ing instead of asking for large-scale financial sup
port.
U T used to laugh at those who tried to tell me how
-Lhard it is to give out money." the softspoken
Cuthbertson says with a smile, "but now I see there
are many more needs than dollars."
In the 23 years that Cuthbertson worked here, first
as an assistant to President Wallace Sterling, then as
vice president for finance, and finally as vice presi
dent for development, he and his staff were able to
raise well over $500 million to fulfill needs here. Of
these, the accomplishment of which he is most proud
was the securing of $6 million from Cecil Green,
which made possible the new library.
He was also a major factor in raising the Universi
ty's annual gift income from about $3 million a year
when he joined the University in 1954, to over $50
million a year upon his retirement.
His successor. Joel Smith, simply calls him "the
best fundraiser I have ever known."
The philosophy which Cuthbertson said is respon
sible for the phenomenal growth in fundraising, is the
"long-term view approach," one which he says over
comes economic instability and outlasts the "glow of
the moment" associated with single, large gifts.
This view, plus the "realization that education
comes from leadership and support, not administra

tion." and the ability to utilize a good staff are the
keys to success, according to Cuthbertson.
But others around the University attribute his per
sonal achievements to other factors.
Smith said he thought Cuthbertson was successful
for two reasons. First, he cited Cuthbertson's "im
peccable integrity," and secondly, "lie has a deep
conviction about Stanford. Because he cares so much,
others have an unusual amount of respect and trust in
him," Smith said.
"Kenny probably represented the ideal kind of
person for development in an academic setting, for
not only was he effective with the business side, but

he was also in sync with what is important to the
faculty." said William Stone, director of the Alumni
Association.
"He's also greatly aided," Stone added, "with an
extremely likeable, outgoing wife."
A visit to the Cuthbertsons' home quickly con
firmed that Ken and Coline Cuthbertson are indeed a
team. Outspoken, energetic and frank, Mrs.
Cuthbertson is quick to both support and challenge
her husband's statements.
"One of the greatest things about Coline is that she
not only unstuffs stuffed shirts I've had to deal with,
she's also unstuffed me!" he says fondly.
She was beside her husband throughout his years
here, beginning when they were both under
graduates in the late 19305. When they were seniors
in 1940. he was ASSU president and she was ASSU
v ice president. "We used to neck in the office," she

quipped.
Following graduation, they were engaged while he
attended Harvard Business School. They married in
1941, but he entered the Navy only a month later.
During his live years in the Navy. Cuthbertson con
tracted polio, and still wears a brace and carries a
cane.
"But it certainly never slowed him down," she said.
"The only thing he can't do is dance, and he was never
very good at that anyway."
After his discharge, Cuthbertson received his
M.B.A. here. and then worked in business for a few
years.
But according to Mrs. Cuthbertson he had alwavs

wanted to work for the University. In 1954 he got his
chit nee.
That year, Fred Glover, now retired secretary of
the University and former assistant to Presidents
Sterling and Richard Lyman, recommended
Cuthbertson to Sterling, who was looking for an assis
tant.
6 6 A t first Wally Sterling thought it was just a
xTLcouple of Delts backing each other up (both
Glover and Cuthbertson belonged to Delta Tau
Delta fraternity), but once he met Kenny, he saw
right away how capable he was," said Glover.
"I've always considered it to be my greatest con
tribution to Stanford that I recommended Ken
Cuthbertson for that job," he added.
So Cuthbertson became Sterling's assistant and
worked primarily on budget matters. The one job he

never wanted, he claims. was to work in develop
ment. "I saw what a tough life it was," he said.
But the "tough lite was to be his. too. tor Sterling
asked Cuthbertson to become vice president for fi
nance. (That position was later split into separate vice
presidencies for development and finance.)
Mrs. Cuthbertson said she thought her husband
accepted the appointment because of his devotion to
Sterling — "He was an instructor when we were
undergraduates and \ ery personable. How could vou
say no?"
But Cuthbertson said the decision also inv olv ed the
confidence he had in his staff. He knew they could
help pick up the extra load he would have bv assum
ing the new position, he said, a position which would
involve an incredible amount of time and travel.
Despite the high pressure of his fundraising
career. Glover said Cuthbertson's greatest per
sonal asset was his "seijenity."
" 1 never saw him get angry or upset. The only thing
that would enrage him was a person who would not
listen and debate rationally." said Glover, who
worked side-bv-side with Cuthbertson in the presi
dent's office for many years.
Unfortunately . Cuthbertson was indeed faced with
this sort of confrontation during the days of turmoil

and unrest here associated with the Vietnam war.
according to Glover.
C'uthbertson agreed that the war was the hardest
obstacle he had to face in fundraising. as many loyal
University supporters withdrew their aid following
on-campus violence and destruction.
" It was a time when something that had been a v cry
enjoyable life had ended: the fun went out of it for
us." he said.
"The fun went out for everybody," Mrs.
Cuthbertson added.
"But there was never the feeling that we should
chuck it all. We just tried to make it clear that the
University needed its good friends then more than
ever. Unfortunately, the most severe damage done to
tundraising was silent, because people simply wrote
Stanford out of their wills," he said.
Yet. dealing with people unhappy with some as
pect ot the University was a constant hurdle for
the fundraiser. It cropped up in issues ranging from
the abolishment tit the Indian as the school mascot in
1972, to the dissatisfaction of some donors when
their children were not admitted to Stanford, he
explained.
"But \ery often, after a few years they'd come
back." lie said. "What was important was that we got
a chance to sit down and talk to them about the

problem."
One ot the highest compliments ever paid
C uthbertson came from C ecil Green, who in his dedi
cation ot the new library actually thanked
Cuthbertson for his work in making the gilt possible.
Smith observed that it was Green's way of acknow
ledging C uthbertson as"oneot the most professional
professionals he had ever dealt with.'j
Since his retirement, the Cuthbertsons have been
able to relax a bit. and can enjoy the company of their
children, and soon-to-be-five grandchildren. They
swim, bicycle and read when they get a chance.
"Kenny was always a great relaxer," his wife said.
"Well, people always ask me why I retired so
young. Ihe answer is that 1 was just plain tired." he
said.
Cuthbertson has. in fact, retained some ties to the
I niversity. In l l )7 l > he was elected to the Alumni
Board ot Directors, where Stone said he shares "an
encyclopedic knowledge ot people and places."
And the one thing he would have liked to do if not
what he did? "Although he might deny it. he's always
wanted to be a faculty person," said Mrs.
Cuthbertson. "111 fact, in his next life 1 think he'll
come back as a Stanford professor.
"I only hope that I'm right there with him." she
said.

sible for the phenomenal growth in fundraising, is the
"long-term view approach," one which he says over
comes economic instability and outlasts the "glow of
the moment" associated with single, large gifts.
This view, plus the "realization that education
comes from leadership and support, not administra

tion." and the ability to utilize a good staff are the
keys to success, according to Cuthbertson.
But others around the University attribute his per
sonal achievements to other factors.
Smith said he thought Cuthbertson was successful
for two reasons. First, he cited Cuthbertson's "im
peccable integrity," and secondly, "lie has a deep
conviction about Stanford. Because he cares so much,
others have an unusual amount of respect and trust in
him," Smith said.
"Kenny probably represented the ideal kind of
person for development in an academic setting, for
not only was he effective with the business side, but

he was also in sync with what is important to the
faculty." said William Stone, director of the Alumni
Association.
"He's also greatly aided," Stone added, "with an
extremely likeable, outgoing wife."
A visit to the Cuthbertsons' home quickly con
firmed that Ken and Coline Cuthbertson are indeed a
team. Outspoken, energetic and frank, Mrs.
Cuthbertson is quick to both support and challenge
her husband's statements.
"One of the greatest things about Coline is that she
not only unstuffs stuffed shirts I've had to deal with,
she's also unstuffed me!" he says fondly.
She was beside her husband throughout his years
here, beginning when they were both under
graduates in the late 19305. When they were seniors
in 1940. he was ASSU president and she was ASSU
v ice president. "We used to neck in the office," she

quipped.
Following graduation, they were engaged while he
attended Harvard Business School. They married in
1941, but he entered the Navy only a month later.
During his live years in the Navy. Cuthbertson con
tracted polio, and still wears a brace and carries a
cane.
"But it certainly never slowed him down," she said.
"The only thing he can't do is dance, and he was never
very good at that anyway."
After his discharge, Cuthbertson received his
M.B.A. here. and then worked in business for a few
years.
But according to Mrs. Cuthbertson he had alwavs

wanted to work for the University. In 1954 he got his
chit nee.
That year, Fred Glover, now retired secretary of
the University and former assistant to Presidents
Sterling and Richard Lyman, recommended
Cuthbertson to Sterling, who was looking for an assis
tant.
6 6 A t first Wally Sterling thought it was just a
xTLcouple of Delts backing each other up (both
Glover and Cuthbertson belonged to Delta Tau
Delta fraternity), but once he met Kenny, he saw
right away how capable he was," said Glover.
"I've always considered it to be my greatest con
tribution to Stanford that I recommended Ken
Cuthbertson for that job," he added.
So Cuthbertson became Sterling's assistant and
worked primarily on budget matters. The one job he

ment. "I saw what a tough life it was," he said.
But the "tough lite was to be his. too. tor Sterling
asked Cuthbertson to become vice president for fi
nance. (That position was later split into separate vice
presidencies for development and finance.)
Mrs. Cuthbertson said she thought her husband
accepted the appointment because of his devotion to
Sterling — "He was an instructor when we were
undergraduates and \ ery personable. How could vou
say no?"
But Cuthbertson said the decision also inv olv ed the
confidence he had in his staff. He knew they could
help pick up the extra load he would have bv assum
ing the new position, he said, a position which would
involve an incredible amount of time and travel.
Despite the high pressure of his fundraising
career. Glover said Cuthbertson's greatest per
sonal asset was his "seijenity."
" 1 never saw him get angry or upset. The only thing
that would enrage him was a person who would not
listen and debate rationally." said Glover, who
worked side-bv-side with Cuthbertson in the presi
dent's office for many years.
Unfortunately . Cuthbertson was indeed faced with
this sort of confrontation during the days of turmoil

and unrest here associated with the Vietnam war.
according to Glover.
C'uthbertson agreed that the war was the hardest
obstacle he had to face in fundraising. as many loyal
University supporters withdrew their aid following
on-campus violence and destruction.
" It was a time when something that had been a v cry
enjoyable life had ended: the fun went out of it for
us." he said.
"The fun went out for everybody," Mrs.
Cuthbertson added.
"But there was never the feeling that we should
chuck it all. We just tried to make it clear that the
University needed its good friends then more than
ever. Unfortunately, the most severe damage done to
tundraising was silent, because people simply wrote
Stanford out of their wills," he said.
Yet. dealing with people unhappy with some as
pect ot the University was a constant hurdle for
the fundraiser. It cropped up in issues ranging from
the abolishment tit the Indian as the school mascot in
1972, to the dissatisfaction of some donors when
their children were not admitted to Stanford, he
explained.
"But \ery often, after a few years they'd come
back." lie said. "What was important was that we got
a chance to sit down and talk to them about the

problem."
One ot the highest compliments ever paid
C uthbertson came from C ecil Green, who in his dedi
cation ot the new library actually thanked
Cuthbertson for his work in making the gilt possible.
Smith observed that it was Green's way of acknow
ledging C uthbertson as"oneot the most professional
professionals he had ever dealt with.'j
Since his retirement, the Cuthbertsons have been
able to relax a bit. and can enjoy the company of their
children, and soon-to-be-five grandchildren. They
swim, bicycle and read when they get a chance.
"Kenny was always a great relaxer," his wife said.
"Well, people always ask me why I retired so
young. Ihe answer is that 1 was just plain tired." he
said.
Cuthbertson has. in fact, retained some ties to the
I niversity. In l l )7 l > he was elected to the Alumni
Board ot Directors, where Stone said he shares "an
encyclopedic knowledge ot people and places."
And the one thing he would have liked to do if not
what he did? "Although he might deny it. he's always
wanted to be a faculty person," said Mrs.
Cuthbertson. "111 fact, in his next life 1 think he'll
come back as a Stanford professor.
"I only hope that I'm right there with him." she
said.
The University's success in fundraising in recent
years may lead some to associate the idea of
"development" with images of multi-zeroed checks
(lowing into the University accounts. It is easy to lose
sight ot the fact that those funds don't simply appear;
people must work hard to raise them.
In fact, for many years the development staff here
had a difficult time securing outside funding for Uni
versity programs.
The problems were due. in part, to Leland Stan
ford's proud attitude that the Stanford family could
always provide for the University's financial needs.
This not only brought Stanford into the fundraising
game late, but it also meant the University had to
overcome its self-sufficient image.
However, two major fund drives — the PACE
(Plan for a Changing Era) campaign in the early
1960s which raised $114 million, and the Campaign
for Stanford, which Irom 1972-77 raised $300 mill
ion — reversed Stanford's legacy and brought the
Univ ersitv to the number two position in annual gifts
received, second only to Harvard.
The man who headed these campaigns and who
played a major role in transforming the University
into a top contender for the fundraising dollar is
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
He no longer administers the hundreds of millions
of dollars he helped raise here before retiring as vice
president for development in 1977. In fact, he now
Mts on the other side of the fence as administrative
vice president for the philanthropic James Irvine
Foundation in San Francisco.
Now when Cuthbertson, 61. leaves his Saratoga
home every morning, he looks forward to a day of
gi\ing instead of asking for large-scale financial sup
port.
U T used to laugh at those who tried to tell me how
-Lhard it is to give out money." the softspoken
Cuthbertson says with a smile, "but now I see there
are many more needs than dollars."
In the 23 years that Cuthbertson worked here, first
as an assistant to President Wallace Sterling, then as
vice president for finance, and finally as vice presi
dent for development, he and his staff were able to
raise well over $500 million to fulfill needs here. Of
these, the accomplishment of which he is most proud
was the securing of $6 million from Cecil Green,
which made possible the new library.
He was also a major factor in raising the Universi
ty's annual gift income from about $3 million a year
when he joined the University in 1954, to over $50
million a year upon his retirement.
His successor. Joel Smith, simply calls him "the
best fundraiser I have ever known."
The philosophy which Cuthbertson said is respon
sible for the phenomenal growth in fundraising, is the
"long-term view approach," one which he says over
comes economic instability and outlasts the "glow of

"I've always considered it to be my greatest con

So Cuthbertson became Sterling's assistant and
worked primarily on budget matters. The one job he

But the "tough lite was to be his. too. tor Sterling
asked Cuthbertson to become vice president for fi
nance. (That position was later split into separate vice
presidencies for development and finance.)
Mrs. Cuthbertson said she thought her husband
accepted the appointment because of his devotion to
Sterling — "He was an instructor when we were
undergraduates and \ ery personable. How could vou
say no?"
But Cuthbertson said the decision also inv olv ed the
confidence he had in his staff. He knew they could
help pick up the extra load he would have bv assum
ing the new position, he said, a position which would
involve an incredible amount of time and travel.
Despite the high pressure of his fundraising
career. Glover said Cuthbertson's greatest per
sonal asset was his "seijenity."
" 1 never saw him get angry or upset. The only thing
that would enrage him was a person who would not
listen and debate rationally." said Glover, who
worked side-bv-side with Cuthbertson in the presi
dent's office for many years.

this sort of confrontation during the days of turmoil

and unrest here associated with the Vietnam war.
according to Glover.
C'uthbertson agreed that the war was the hardest
obstacle he had to face in fundraising. as many loyal
University supporters withdrew their aid following
on-campus violence and destruction.
" It was a time when something that had been a v cry
enjoyable life had ended: the fun went out of it for
us." he said.
"The fun went out for everybody," Mrs.
Cuthbertson added.
"But there was never the feeling that we should
chuck it all. We just tried to make it clear that the
University needed its good friends then more than
ever. Unfortunately, the most severe damage done to
tundraising was silent, because people simply wrote
Stanford out of their wills," he said.
Yet. dealing with people unhappy with some as
pect ot the University was a constant hurdle for
the fundraiser. It cropped up in issues ranging from
the abolishment tit the Indian as the school mascot in
1972, to the dissatisfaction of some donors when
their children were not admitted to Stanford, he
explained.
"But \ery often, after a few years they'd come
back." lie said. "What was important was that we got
a chance to sit down and talk to them about the

problem."
One ot the highest compliments ever paid
C uthbertson came from C ecil Green, who in his dedi
cation ot the new library actually thanked
Cuthbertson for his work in making the gilt possible.
Smith observed that it was Green's way of acknow
ledging C uthbertson as"oneot the most professional
professionals he had ever dealt with.'j
Since his retirement, the Cuthbertsons have been
able to relax a bit. and can enjoy the company of their
children, and soon-to-be-five grandchildren. They
swim, bicycle and read when they get a chance.
"Kenny was always a great relaxer," his wife said.
"Well, people always ask me why I retired so
young. Ihe answer is that 1 was just plain tired." he
said.
Cuthbertson has. in fact, retained some ties to the
I niversity. In l l )7 l > he was elected to the Alumni
Board ot Directors, where Stone said he shares "an
encyclopedic knowledge ot people and places."
And the one thing he would have liked to do if not
what he did? "Although he might deny it. he's always
wanted to be a faculty person," said Mrs.
Cuthbertson. "111 fact, in his next life 1 think he'll
come back as a Stanford professor.
"I only hope that I'm right there with him." she
said.
The University's success in fundraising in recent
years may lead some to associate the idea of
"development" with images of multi-zeroed checks
(lowing into the University accounts. It is easy to lose
sight ot the fact that those funds don't simply appear;
people must work hard to raise them.
In fact, for many years the development staff here
had a difficult time securing outside funding for Uni
versity programs.
The problems were due. in part, to Leland Stan
ford's proud attitude that the Stanford family could
always provide for the University's financial needs.
This not only brought Stanford into the fundraising
game late, but it also meant the University had to
overcome its self-sufficient image.
However, two major fund drives — the PACE
(Plan for a Changing Era) campaign in the early
1960s which raised $114 million, and the Campaign
for Stanford, which Irom 1972-77 raised $300 mill
ion — reversed Stanford's legacy and brought the
Univ ersitv to the number two position in annual gifts
received, second only to Harvard.
The man who headed these campaigns and who
played a major role in transforming the University
into a top contender for the fundraising dollar is
Kenneth Cuthbertson.
He no longer administers the hundreds of millions
of dollars he helped raise here before retiring as vice
president for development in 1977. In fact, he now
Mts on the other side of the fence as administrative
vice president for the philanthropic James Irvine
Foundation in San Francisco.
Now when Cuthbertson, 61. leaves his Saratoga
home every morning, he looks forward to a day of
gi\ing instead of asking for large-scale financial sup
port.
U T used to laugh at those who tried to tell me how
-Lhard it is to give out money." the softspoken
Cuthbertson says with a smile, "but now I see there
are many more needs than dollars."
In the 23 years that Cuthbertson worked here, first
as an assistant to President Wallace Sterling, then as
vice president for finance, and finally as vice presi
dent for development, he and his staff were able to
raise well over $500 million to fulfill needs here. Of
these, the accomplishment of which he is most proud
was the securing of $6 million from Cecil Green,
which made possible the new library.
He was also a major factor in raising the Universi
ty's annual gift income from about $3 million a year
when he joined the University in 1954, to over $50
million a year upon his retirement.
His successor. Joel Smith, simply calls him "the
best fundraiser I have ever known."
The philosophy which Cuthbertson said is respon
sible for the phenomenal growth in fundraising, is the
"long-term view approach," one which he says over
comes economic instability and outlasts the "glow of
the moment" associated with single, large gifts.
This view, plus the "realization that education
comes from leadership and support, not administra

tion." and the ability to utilize a good staff are the
keys to success, according to Cuthbertson.
But others around the University attribute his per
sonal achievements to other factors.
Smith said he thought Cuthbertson was successful
for two reasons. First, he cited Cuthbertson's "im
peccable integrity," and secondly, "lie has a deep
conviction about Stanford. Because he cares so much,
others have an unusual amount of respect and trust in
him," Smith said.
"Kenny probably represented the ideal kind of
person for development in an academic setting, for
not only was he effective with the business side, but

he was also in sync with what is important to the
faculty." said William Stone, director of the Alumni
Association.
"He's also greatly aided," Stone added, "with an
extremely likeable, outgoing wife."
A visit to the Cuthbertsons' home quickly con
firmed that Ken and Coline Cuthbertson are indeed a
team. Outspoken, energetic and frank, Mrs.
Cuthbertson is quick to both support and challenge
her husband's statements.
"One of the greatest things about Coline is that she
not only unstuffs stuffed shirts I've had to deal with,
she's also unstuffed me!" he says fondly.
She was beside her husband throughout his years
here, beginning when they were both under
graduates in the late 19305. When they were seniors
in 1940. he was ASSU president and she was ASSU
v ice president. "We used to neck in the office," she

quipped.
Following graduation, they were engaged while he
attended Harvard Business School. They married in
1941, but he entered the Navy only a month later.
During his live years in the Navy. Cuthbertson con
tracted polio, and still wears a brace and carries a
cane.
"But it certainly never slowed him down," she said.
"The only thing he can't do is dance, and he was never
very good at that anyway."
After his discharge, Cuthbertson received his
M.B.A. here. and then worked in business for a few
years.
But according to Mrs. Cuthbertson he had alwavs

wanted to work for the University. In 1954 he got his
chit nee.
That year, Fred Glover, now retired secretary of
the University and former assistant to Presidents
Sterling and Richard Lyman, recommended
Cuthbertson to Sterling, who was looking for an assis
tant.
