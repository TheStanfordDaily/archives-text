# No major changes forecast for campus in next 10 years
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Last year. University fun
draisers secured more than
$5.9 million for new buildings on
campus. representing some 9.2
percent of all gilt receipts.
New facilities are among the
most conspicuous tangible re
sults ot successful fundraising.
and the University has many
major building projects under
wit y.
But barring another ear
thquake like the one in 1 906. the
campus here will look much the
same 10 years from now. How
ever. Univefsity needs, particu
larly in technological areas, are
difficult to forecast. Who could
have predicted SLAC in the
19405?
Housing will remain a top
priority. According to Phil Wil
liams, University architect and

director oi planning. "We need
housing more than anything,
especially for young faculty and

and the 460-aere site In the Uni

the primary residence sites.
Projects which should be
completed over the next three
years include the Braun music

next to Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at a cost of $(i.3 niilliyn: Com

yet been determined, and an

Lake Lagunita also are planned.
Peter Hopf, associate director
of facilities, said the dorm will be
completed in stages, but.should
be usable by 1952 or 198.1.

Other likely projects include
an i ntegrated-sy stems
building, a Med School science
building and an athletic-activity
wing next to Lncina gym. The
Med School building plans
merely represent "the ongoing
need tor scientific facilities."
Hopt said. The athletics-facility
proposal will go to the Board ol
Trustees for approval in June.
Both the old chemistry build
ing and parts ot the Quad are
slated for major reconstruction.
The chemistry building probably
will remain standing because ol

Williams said.
"Quad renovation is an ulti

front will be completed by the
new Bldg. 1 20.
According to Hopf. Man

for at least five or 10 more years.

University planners expect to see few major changes in the campus layout over the next 10 years,
yet maps which show building projects, like this one. are dotted with one construction program
after another.
out. It's really a question of
whether they'll survive," he said.
Rebuilding Tresidder Union
into more of a student meeting
place was a major issue of this
month's ASSU Senate election.
But the University administra
tion does not view Tresidder re
novation as a top priority. Hopf
said that "unless some munifi
cent donor comes along with $5
million," major changes are un
likely. "It's a question of what
are perceived to be the im
mediate priorities," he added.
The University funds about 27
percent of construction through
gifts. 46 percent through borrow
ing and 10 percent through unre
stricted capital reserves. The re
mainder is funded from a variety
of other means. Housing in par
ticular. which comprises 33 per
cent of facility use, is difficult to
fund through donations. Room
rent increases will cover the debt
financing required for the 800-
unit student residence, which has
received first-stage approval.
Government research funding
has decreased since the generous
federal grants of the 19605. Wil
liams said, however, that the
economic crunch has been sof
tened here by wise budgeting
and forecasting of income and
cost.
According to David Fulton,
director of development
communications, corporations
are not likely sources of funds for
new buildings. Foundations are
prime targets, but "not manv
prospects" exist.
"Very few individuals can af
ford to build buildings now." he
added. Individual donors used to
be likely building flinders when
facilities could be built for $1
million. But construction costs
have skyrocketed.
The University owns 8100
acres on the mid-Peninsula. Of
these, 5800 acres are currently
used for academic projects. Core
academic buildings represent
more than half of University land

use. Auxiliary buildings, such as
student residences, comprise the
remaining space.
Each year, the capital budget
staff compiles the Facilities Plan
and Capital Funding Forecast for
the upcoming five years. The
book, which is published by the
vice president for business and
finance, gives a status report on
current and planned physical
facilities within the academic
campus. It also integrates the
planning activities of the pro
vost, business and finance office,
development office, facilities of
fice, and controller's office. Fi
nally, it provides a basis for trus

tees decisions.
The goals of these offices in
clude providing adequate stu
dent facilities and correcting
existing facility deficiencies. For
example, before recent renova
tion. said Bud Ratts. assistant
controller, the history facilities
were totally inadequate.
Costs of both construction and
renovation are staggering. More
than 70 percent of the physical
plant here has been constructed
since 1955. In the period from
Feb. 1, 1978, to Dec. I. 1979,
the University completed $34
million worth of projects. And

the capital budget staff recom
mends that a minimum of $13
million annually should be re
served lor plant reinvestment.
According to Fulton, fun
draising and building needs
don't happen overnight. "Build
ing needs arise in an evolutio
nary way," he said. "We don't
just raise money for one building
project at a time."
"Once a building is approv ed,
then they're all kind of equal,"
said Richard Bennett, director of
development administration.
Priorities are constantly chanu

ing and often have little effect on
the speed of a building's comple
tion.
The basic procedure is as fol
lows: a department states a prog
ram needed; a dean or officer
reviews and approves the need;
the provost and appropriate vice
president review and approve
the need; the president and vice
presidents review and approve
project initiation; the trustees
okay proceeding with the pro
ject; the vice presidents approve
the project; the trustees approve
the project design and budget;
the design is completed; and the
facility is constructed.
