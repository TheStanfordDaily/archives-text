### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Last year. University fun
draisers secured more than
$5.9 million for new buildings on
campus. representing some 9.2
percent of all gilt receipts.
New facilities are among the
most conspicuous tangible re
sults ot successful fundraising.
and the University has many
major building projects under
wit y.
But barring another ear
thquake like the one in 1 906. the
campus here will look much the
same 10 years from now. How
ever. Univefsity needs, particu
larly in technological areas, are
difficult to forecast. Who could
have predicted SLAC in the
19405?
Housing will remain a top
priority. According to Phil Wil
liams, University architect and

director oi planning. "We need
housing more than anything,
especially for young faculty and

and the 460-aere site In the Uni
versity Medical Center should be
the primary residence sites.
Projects which should be
completed over the next three
years include the Braun music
building, which should go up
next to Dinkelspiel Auditorium
at a cost of $(i.3 niilliyn: Com
munication Department Bldg.
1 20 at a cost of $ 1 I million: and
a cardiovascular research lab at
the Medical Center at a cost ot
$14 million. A research lab lor
"Vers Large Systems Integra
tions.*' whose location has not
yet been determined, and an
SOO-unit student residence by
Lake Lagunita also are planned.
Peter Hopf, associate director
of facilities, said the dorm will be
completed in stages, but.should
be usable by 1952 or 198.1.

Other likely projects include
an i ntegrated-sy stems
building, a Med School science
building and an athletic-activity
wing next to Lncina gym. The
Med School building plans
merely represent "the ongoing
need tor scientific facilities."
Hopt said. The athletics-facility
proposal will go to the Board ol
Trustees for approval in June.
Both the old chemistry build
ing and parts ot the Quad are
slated for major reconstruction.
The chemistry building probably
will remain standing because ol
tradition, although it is obsolete.
Williams said.
"Quad renovation is an ulti
mate goal." Hopt added. Its
front will be completed by the
new Bldg. 1 20.
According to Hopf. Man
zanita Park probably will be here
for at least five or 10 more years.
