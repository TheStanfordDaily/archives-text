# Smith heads development

Of all the factors that contri
bute to making the Univer
sity a successful fundraising in
stitution. one of the most impor
tant is the people involved. And
at the head of Stanford's team is
Vice President for Development
Joel Smith.
" The excellence of Stanford is
a great asset in fundraising. But
to derive the maximum fundrais
ing success Irom that takes
creativity, hard work and de
velopment leadership — and
Joel Smith prov ides all of those,"
said Daryl Pearson, general sec
retary for the Office of De
velopment.
Smith, leaning back in his
chair, relaxed but attentive, took
a more impersonal view of what
makes for an effective fun
draiser. Those asking for money
must have "a deep conviction
about what they're doing." he
said." I'm really convinced about
the importance of that."
Also, "it's very important to
be substantively well-informed."
It's important that the people
being asked to donate money
sense that "the person doing the
asking really knows what's going
on," Smith added.
Smith's experience at the Uni
versity dates back to the mid
19605T when he was hired to
work in the Office ol Develop
ment under Pearson. Smith soon
became associate dean of stu
dents. served about I 1 : years,
then, in 1967, was appointed as
sociate provost and dean of stu
dents.
In 1969 Smith moved to
Ciranv ille, Ohio to become pres
ident of Denison University. But
in 1975 he returned here to work
as a special consultant to then
Vice President for Development
Kenneth Cuthbertson. Smith
succeeded him two years later
when Cuthbertson retired.
Pearson said he likes to think
"it was his (Smith's) expo
sure to fundraising when he first
came to the University that made
him decide that was the area of
University administration that he
likes best."
According to Smith, he chose
fundraising because it is "a vit
ally important activity for a place
such as Stanford, and I like to be
in on the action."
Smith said "there's no ques
tion about it" — his job now is
definitely different from his pre
vious position as dean ot stu
dents.
"I had very different roles, and
a very different life." lie com
mented. As dean of students, "I
had contact with students hour
after hour, day alter day.' In his
present job, "it's relatively rare
that I have any contact with stu
dents." Smith said.
Smith pointed out that lie was
dean of students in the late
19605, which he called a "special
time." because of the emotion
ally charged atmosphere as
sociated with the Vietnam War.
"I spent almost all ot my time
trying to deal with problems ot
law and order," he explained.
Smith said he adapted to the
role well because "the crisis
period called forth the crisis in
me," but added that he "would
not be good at that job as it* is
now."
Smith said his experience as
president of Denison was also
very different from his current
role in fundraising.
Denison, he said, is a strictly
liberal arts college ot about 2000
students, a "different world"
from Stanford. Because the Uni
versity is larger, there is a ditter
encc in scale, but there is an even
greater difference in complexity,

he said. "I happen very, very
much to prefer that complexity,"
he added.
As president of a university
"the great risk is that you take
everything too seriously." Smith
commented, and that risk is grea
ter at a small school where the
administration is "all in so
close," and the support system is
not as widespread.
t Smith also described the joh as
"'very, very difficult emotion
ally" and "remarkably lonely."
The loneliness of the joh didn't
bother him as much, though, "be
cause I tend to be a card-carrying
loner."
Smith added, however, that he
is only a loner in his professional
lite. Sitting in his orderly, spaci
ous office with rows of black bin
der notebooks shelved neatly
along the wall. Smith appears
cool and business-like.
But according to his colleague
John Hays, director of the
annual fund. Smith is "a very
warm and pleasant person" and
one who "forms close, warm
friendships."

In answering questions. Smith
speaks slowly and deliberately,
pausing to organi/e his thoughts
before verbalizing them.
Hays said this characteristie
probably comes from his experi
ence as president of Denison and
his past legal training, "where
preciseness of thought and
statement is important."
Smith, a Marshall scholar, was
I'hi Beta Kappa and student
body president at Beloit College,
graduating summa cum laude in
1955. He later got his law degree
at the University of Wisconsin
Law School, where he was also
editor of the Wisconsin Law Re
view.
Before coming here, he prac
ticed law in Minneapolis.
Smith, 46, now lives on cam
pus near Lake Lagunita. where
he enjoys "conventional in
terests" such as jogging around
the lake. Smith said he also en
joys reading spy novels and is
"the ranking expert on country
music, certainly in the administ
ration and perhaps in the whole
