# Fundraisers accommodate all types of donors
## 
### Rob Lempert News Editor 
There are 119.171 Stanford
alumni living in the world
today, ranging from the very rich
to the not-so-poor. They are
spread across the continent and
occupy a multitude of profes
sions. Their interests are as
numerous as the individuals
themselves.
In fact, the only thing the
alumni have in common is their
alma mater — and the letter or
phone call each receives once a
year from an eager volunteer sol
iciting a gift for Stanford.
Five different volunteer or
ganizations. all similar but all
aimed at a different group of po
tential donors, make up the
program whose task it is to keep
the University well supplied with
alumni gifts. Stanford has been
asking for annual gifts from its
alumni only since 1937. a short
amount of time compared to the
Ivy League schools, said David
Fulton, director of communica
tions in the Office of Develop
ment and one of the directors of
the volunteer gift program.
But though it is new, Stan
ford's program is well de
veloped. Whether an alumnus is
struggling with his first job after
school and has barely a dollar to
spare or is a multi-millionaire in
dustrialist ready to go into
philanthrophy. the University
has a program by which alumni
can give.
The programs are differen
tiated by the amounts given and
the types of donor.
Indi\ idual alumni may give to
the Major Gifts Program if their
gift totals $25,000 or more. Less
generous (or wealthy) alums
may donate to the Annual Fund.
Corporations, whether or not
they have any personal ties to the
University, can give through the
Corporate Gilts Program, and
the Foundations Gifts Program
accepts gifts from large research
groups. Finally, the Trusts and
Bequests Program enables
alumni to lea\ e a little something
lor Stanford in their will.
Each program has a national
chairman, and most are divided
into regional committees.
The Major Gifts Program, for
example, is made up of I iv e areas
each containing a collection ol
cities in a different area ot the
country. The volunteers who
work in the Major Gifts commit
tees must know the University
very well, according to Fulton,
and they must represent Stan
lord in a high-level way. It is not
surprising that the national and
area chairman in Major Gilts
also sit on the Board ol Trustees
ot the University.
The Annual l und includes
seven categories: Special
Gilts ($lO,OOO $25,000). Per
sonal Solicitation ($250-
$10,000). General Appeal
($250 and under). Parents
Committee (lor parents ol stu
dents ). Student Development
(lor recent graduates and
seniors). Professional Funds (for
donations to athletics — the
Buck Club — and protessional
schools — law. business,
medicine, etc.). and the Class
l und (another avenue lot small
donations, like the General Ap
peal ).
Each program has its own in
dividual methods lor soliciting
gilts, ranging from a painstaking,
vears-long process lor Major
Gilts to mass mailings lor the
Annual Fund. But the basic idea
lor all ol them. I niton savs. is to
reach all those ready and able to
give.
It is obvious to the fundraisers
which alums are able to give
Major Gilts. Fulton said, "but
that is not to say there aren't
happy surprises." Basically, a

volunteer from the Major Gifts
Program will approach a poten
tial donor with the idea of mak
ing a gift, and in a process that
may take years, try to match the
University's needs with the indi
\ idual's interests. The main diffi
culty usually encountered. Ful
ton said, is the desire of many
potential donors to give a very
restricted gift.
A restricted gilt is one that is
gi\en for a single purpose.
But. large gilts which are totalis
unrestricted are exceedingly
rare. Fulton said.
The more genera! a gilt is. the
more useful it is to the L'ni\ersity
and thus the volunteer tries to

broaden the scope of jj potential
gift.
If. for example, a donor wants
to give money to create an en
dowed professor's chair in
American Studies — and the
University already has two such
chairs — the volunteer on the
case would ask if the donor
would endow a chair in another
department — perhaps
humanities — and thus enable
the University to hire a professor
tor a less fleshed out department.
According to Fulton, major
gilts tend to be earmarked for
such things as scholarships and
fellowships, endowed books, en
dowed chairs and buildings.
Currently, the Major Gifts

Program is.trying to raise money
for the new music building.
Committee members meet and
leaf through sheets of names,
discussing whose interest in the
performing arts might be suffi
cient to prompt a donation.
Volunteers in the Annual
Fund have a slightly different
emphasis. Here the idea is to in
still in as many alumni as possible
the tradition of giving. At
Dartmouth. (">0 percent of its
alums give to their alma mater.
Fulton says, while only 25 per
cent ot Stanford grads do
likewise. The main goal of the
Annual Fund is to up this figure.
"We've got to get rid of the
idea that Stanford is rich." Inl -

ton explains, "for it does project
an affluent image. But the Uni
versity is not rich in that all its
needs are not met."
The Special Gifts and Per
sonal Solicitation sub
programs of the Annual Fund
work something like Major
Gifts. Potential donors are lo
cated and urged to make a dona
tion through personal contacts
with volunteers. But the other
areas of the General Fund work
differently, because they arc
aimed at small contributions
from a large number of people.
The General Appeal uses
mailings and phone messages to
urge alums to gi\e whatever they
can once a year to the University.
The objective is to build a gi\ mg
tradition on a grass roots level
among alumni. Mailings are tai
lored to the alumni's gi\ing re
cords and class affiliation and arc
sent throughout the year. Phone
appeals are concentrated in the
fall and spring when past donors
and random alums are called on
a rotating basis.
Another part of the Annual
Fund is the Senior Pledge, or
ganized under the Student De
velopment sub-program. Stu
dent volunteers personally con
tact their fellow seniors, asking
them to pledge approximately
$N0 over the three years im
mediately following their gradu
ation.
The most low-key soliciting
comes under the auspices of the
Trusts and Bequests Program.
Every couple of years older
alums receive letters reminding
them of the possibility of putting
Stanford in their wills. The Stan
lord R-play is a group of lawyers
here. who. in a related project,
distribute to se\ eral thousand at
torneys a special manual that
outlines the various ways to in
clude a uni\ ersity in a will and all
the relevant legal codes.
The Trusts and Bequests
Program also sponsors the l ife
Income system, bv which a donor
can give a sum of money to Stan
ford and receive a percentage of
the gift as interest income from
the University for the rest of Ittt"
or her life.
About two to three thousand
volunteers participate in
the Annual Fund soliciting each
year. Fulton said these people
are just those alums willing to
donate some time to the Univer
sity and who enjoy fundraising,
either because they like meeting
people or find themselves good
at it.
The Corporate Program is
more closcly integrated with
regular University employees
than the Major Gifts or Annual
Fund. There is a good deal of
information exchanged between
corporate scientists and profes
sors here. Fulton said, thus cor
porations have a good idea of
what programs they might be in
terested in funding.
Still, Stanford volunteers regu
larly contact the members of the
Fortune 500, soliciting dona
tions that usually are earmarked
for scientific or technical schools
such as Earth Science, Engineer
ing, the Medical Center and the
Graduate School of Business,
which of course studies more ef
ficient business management.
Many corporations also have
matching funds programs
in which they may add to any
contribution made by one of

their employees to their alma
mater.
Contributions from Founda
tions also tend to go to projects
in which the Foundations are
particularly interested, but such
projects tend to be more in the
humanities and social sciences,
which balances industries' preoc
cupation with technology and
science.
Last year, the Annual Fund
collected $5 million. This year
the target is to collect $5.3 mill
ion. But this figure represents
more than just the amount the
program heads think they can
wrest from the alumni. Fulton
said.
Each year the provost's office
makes a list of the University's
most urgent needs. Usually some
of these needs have more poten
tial as gift opportunities than
others.
Buildings, for instance, tend to
be more glamorous than hiring
more janitors, and thus provide a
bigger draw for funds. Pulton
said.
By balancing the University's
needs with the possibilities of its
various sources of income —
gifts, federal grants, tuition, land
royalties and interest off the en
dowment — the program heads
determine their targets for the
year.
But even if those targets are
hit. "the University's needs far
overshadow its capacity to raise
funds," Fulton said.

($250 and under). Parents
Committee (lor parents ol stu
dents ). Student Development
(lor recent graduates and
seniors). Professional Funds (for
donations to athletics — the
Buck Club — and protessional
schools — law. business,
medicine, etc.). and the Class
l und (another avenue lot small
donations, like the General Ap
peal ).
Each program has its own in
dividual methods lor soliciting
gilts, ranging from a painstaking,
vears-long process lor Major
Gilts to mass mailings lor the
Annual Fund. But the basic idea
lor all ol them. I niton savs. is to
reach all those ready and able to
give.
It is obvious to the fundraisers
which alums are able to give
Major Gilts. Fulton said, "but
that is not to say there aren't
happy surprises." Basically, a

volunteer from the Major Gifts
Program will approach a poten
tial donor with the idea of mak
ing a gift, and in a process that
may take years, try to match the
University's needs with the indi
\ idual's interests. The main diffi
culty usually encountered. Ful
ton said, is the desire of many
potential donors to give a very
restricted gift.
A restricted gilt is one that is
gi\en for a single purpose.
But. large gilts which are totalis
unrestricted are exceedingly
rare. Fulton said.
The more genera! a gilt is. the
more useful it is to the L'ni\ersity
and thus the volunteer tries to

broaden the scope of jj potential
gift.
If. for example, a donor wants
to give money to create an en
dowed professor's chair in
American Studies — and the
University already has two such
chairs — the volunteer on the
case would ask if the donor
would endow a chair in another
department — perhaps
humanities — and thus enable
the University to hire a professor
tor a less fleshed out department.
According to Fulton, major
gilts tend to be earmarked for
such things as scholarships and
fellowships, endowed books, en
dowed chairs and buildings.
Currently, the Major Gifts

Program is.trying to raise money
for the new music building.
Committee members meet and
leaf through sheets of names,
discussing whose interest in the
performing arts might be suffi
cient to prompt a donation.
Volunteers in the Annual
Fund have a slightly different
emphasis. Here the idea is to in
still in as many alumni as possible
the tradition of giving. At
Dartmouth. (">0 percent of its
alums give to their alma mater.
Fulton says, while only 25 per
cent ot Stanford grads do
likewise. The main goal of the
Annual Fund is to up this figure.
"We've got to get rid of the
idea that Stanford is rich." Inl -

ton explains, "for it does project
an affluent image. But the Uni
versity is not rich in that all its
needs are not met."
The Special Gifts and Per
sonal Solicitation sub
programs of the Annual Fund
work something like Major
Gifts. Potential donors are lo
cated and urged to make a dona
tion through personal contacts
with volunteers. But the other
areas of the General Fund work
differently, because they arc
aimed at small contributions
from a large number of people.
The General Appeal uses
mailings and phone messages to
urge alums to gi\e whatever they
can once a year to the University.
The objective is to build a gi\ mg
tradition on a grass roots level
among alumni. Mailings are tai
lored to the alumni's gi\ing re
cords and class affiliation and arc
sent throughout the year. Phone
appeals are concentrated in the
fall and spring when past donors
and random alums are called on
a rotating basis.
Another part of the Annual
Fund is the Senior Pledge, or
ganized under the Student De
velopment sub-program. Stu
dent volunteers personally con
tact their fellow seniors, asking
them to pledge approximately
$N0 over the three years im
mediately following their gradu
ation.
The most low-key soliciting
comes under the auspices of the
Trusts and Bequests Program.
Every couple of years older
alums receive letters reminding
them of the possibility of putting
Stanford in their wills. The Stan
lord R-play is a group of lawyers
here. who. in a related project,
distribute to se\ eral thousand at
torneys a special manual that
outlines the various ways to in
clude a uni\ ersity in a will and all
the relevant legal codes.
The Trusts and Bequests
Program also sponsors the l ife
Income system, bv which a donor
can give a sum of money to Stan
ford and receive a percentage of
the gift as interest income from
the University for the rest of Ittt"
or her life.
About two to three thousand
volunteers participate in
the Annual Fund soliciting each
year. Fulton said these people
are just those alums willing to
donate some time to the Univer
sity and who enjoy fundraising,
either because they like meeting
people or find themselves good
at it.
The Corporate Program is
more closcly integrated with
regular University employees
than the Major Gifts or Annual
Fund. There is a good deal of
information exchanged between
corporate scientists and profes
sors here. Fulton said, thus cor
porations have a good idea of
what programs they might be in
terested in funding.
Still, Stanford volunteers regu
larly contact the members of the
Fortune 500, soliciting dona
tions that usually are earmarked
for scientific or technical schools
such as Earth Science, Engineer
ing, the Medical Center and the
Graduate School of Business,
which of course studies more ef
ficient business management.
Many corporations also have
matching funds programs
in which they may add to any
contribution made by one of

their employees to their alma
mater.
Contributions from Founda
tions also tend to go to projects
in which the Foundations are
particularly interested, but such
projects tend to be more in the
humanities and social sciences,
which balances industries' preoc
cupation with technology and
science.
Last year, the Annual Fund
collected $5 million. This year
the target is to collect $5.3 mill
ion. But this figure represents
more than just the amount the
program heads think they can
wrest from the alumni. Fulton
said.
Each year the provost's office
makes a list of the University's
most urgent needs. Usually some
of these needs have more poten
tial as gift opportunities than
others.
Buildings, for instance, tend to
be more glamorous than hiring
more janitors, and thus provide a
bigger draw for funds. Pulton
said.
By balancing the University's
needs with the possibilities of its
various sources of income —
gifts, federal grants, tuition, land
royalties and interest off the en
dowment — the program heads
determine their targets for the
year.
But even if those targets are
hit. "the University's needs far
overshadow its capacity to raise
funds," Fulton said.
There are 119.171 Stanford
alumni living in the world
today, ranging from the very rich
to the not-so-poor. They are
spread across the continent and
occupy a multitude of profes
sions. Their interests are as
numerous as the individuals
themselves.
In fact, the only thing the
alumni have in common is their
alma mater — and the letter or
phone call each receives once a
year from an eager volunteer sol
iciting a gift for Stanford.
Five different volunteer or
ganizations. all similar but all
aimed at a different group of po
tential donors, make up the
program whose task it is to keep
the University well supplied with
alumni gifts. Stanford has been
asking for annual gifts from its
alumni only since 1937. a short
amount of time compared to the
Ivy League schools, said David
Fulton, director of communica
tions in the Office of Develop
ment and one of the directors of
the volunteer gift program.
But though it is new, Stan
ford's program is well de
veloped. Whether an alumnus is
struggling with his first job after
school and has barely a dollar to
spare or is a multi-millionaire in
dustrialist ready to go into
philanthrophy. the University
has a program by which alumni
can give.
The programs are differen
tiated by the amounts given and
the types of donor.
Indi\ idual alumni may give to
the Major Gifts Program if their
gift totals $25,000 or more. Less
generous (or wealthy) alums
may donate to the Annual Fund.
Corporations, whether or not
they have any personal ties to the
University, can give through the
Corporate Gilts Program, and
the Foundations Gifts Program
accepts gifts from large research
groups. Finally, the Trusts and
Bequests Program enables
alumni to lea\ e a little something
lor Stanford in their will.
Each program has a national
chairman, and most are divided
into regional committees.
The Major Gifts Program, for
example, is made up of I iv e areas
each containing a collection ol
cities in a different area ot the
country. The volunteers who
work in the Major Gifts commit
tees must know the University
very well, according to Fulton,
and they must represent Stan
lord in a high-level way. It is not
surprising that the national and
area chairman in Major Gilts
also sit on the Board ol Trustees
ot the University.
The Annual l und includes
seven categories: Special
Gilts ($lO,OOO $25,000). Per
sonal Solicitation ($250-
$10,000). General Appeal
($250 and under). Parents
Committee (lor parents ol stu
dents ). Student Development
(lor recent graduates and
seniors). Professional Funds (for

likewise. The main goal of the
Annual Fund is to up this figure.
"We've got to get rid of the
idea that Stanford is rich." Inl -

ton explains, "for it does project
an affluent image. But the Uni
versity is not rich in that all its
needs are not met."
The Special Gifts and Per
sonal Solicitation sub
programs of the Annual Fund
work something like Major
Gifts. Potential donors are lo
cated and urged to make a dona
tion through personal contacts
with volunteers. But the other
areas of the General Fund work
differently, because they arc
aimed at small contributions
from a large number of people.
The General Appeal uses
mailings and phone messages to
urge alums to gi\e whatever they
can once a year to the University.
The objective is to build a gi\ mg
tradition on a grass roots level
among alumni. Mailings are tai
lored to the alumni's gi\ing re
cords and class affiliation and arc
sent throughout the year. Phone
appeals are concentrated in the
fall and spring when past donors
and random alums are called on
a rotating basis.
Another part of the Annual
Fund is the Senior Pledge, or
ganized under the Student De
velopment sub-program. Stu
dent volunteers personally con
tact their fellow seniors, asking
them to pledge approximately
$N0 over the three years im
mediately following their gradu
ation.
The most low-key soliciting
comes under the auspices of the
Trusts and Bequests Program.
Every couple of years older
alums receive letters reminding
them of the possibility of putting
Stanford in their wills. The Stan
lord R-play is a group of lawyers
here. who. in a related project,
distribute to se\ eral thousand at
torneys a special manual that
outlines the various ways to in
clude a uni\ ersity in a will and all
the relevant legal codes.
The Trusts and Bequests
Program also sponsors the l ife
Income system, bv which a donor
can give a sum of money to Stan
ford and receive a percentage of
the gift as interest income from
the University for the rest of Ittt"
or her life.
About two to three thousand
volunteers participate in
the Annual Fund soliciting each
year. Fulton said these people
are just those alums willing to
donate some time to the Univer
sity and who enjoy fundraising,
either because they like meeting
people or find themselves good
at it.
The Corporate Program is
more closcly integrated with
regular University employees
than the Major Gifts or Annual
Fund. There is a good deal of
information exchanged between
corporate scientists and profes
sors here. Fulton said, thus cor
porations have a good idea of
what programs they might be in
terested in funding.
Still, Stanford volunteers regu
larly contact the members of the
Fortune 500, soliciting dona
tions that usually are earmarked
for scientific or technical schools
such as Earth Science, Engineer
ing, the Medical Center and the
Graduate School of Business,
which of course studies more ef
ficient business management.
Many corporations also have
matching funds programs
in which they may add to any
contribution made by one of

their employees to their alma
mater.
Contributions from Founda
tions also tend to go to projects
in which the Foundations are
particularly interested, but such
projects tend to be more in the
humanities and social sciences,
which balances industries' preoc
cupation with technology and
science.
Last year, the Annual Fund
collected $5 million. This year
the target is to collect $5.3 mill
ion. But this figure represents
more than just the amount the
program heads think they can
wrest from the alumni. Fulton
said.
Each year the provost's office
makes a list of the University's
most urgent needs. Usually some
of these needs have more poten
tial as gift opportunities than
others.
Buildings, for instance, tend to
be more glamorous than hiring
more janitors, and thus provide a
bigger draw for funds. Pulton
said.
By balancing the University's
needs with the possibilities of its
various sources of income —
gifts, federal grants, tuition, land
royalties and interest off the en
dowment — the program heads
determine their targets for the
year.
But even if those targets are
hit. "the University's needs far
overshadow its capacity to raise
funds," Fulton said.
There are 119.171 Stanford
alumni living in the world
today, ranging from the very rich
to the not-so-poor. They are
spread across the continent and
occupy a multitude of profes
sions. Their interests are as
numerous as the individuals
themselves.
In fact, the only thing the
alumni have in common is their
alma mater — and the letter or
phone call each receives once a
year from an eager volunteer sol
iciting a gift for Stanford.
Five different volunteer or
ganizations. all similar but all
aimed at a different group of po
tential donors, make up the
program whose task it is to keep
the University well supplied with
alumni gifts. Stanford has been
asking for annual gifts from its
alumni only since 1937. a short
amount of time compared to the
Ivy League schools, said David
Fulton, director of communica
tions in the Office of Develop
ment and one of the directors of
the volunteer gift program.
But though it is new, Stan
ford's program is well de
veloped. Whether an alumnus is
struggling with his first job after
school and has barely a dollar to
spare or is a multi-millionaire in
dustrialist ready to go into
philanthrophy. the University
has a program by which alumni
can give.
The programs are differen
tiated by the amounts given and
the types of donor.
Indi\ idual alumni may give to
the Major Gifts Program if their
gift totals $25,000 or more. Less
generous (or wealthy) alums
may donate to the Annual Fund.
Corporations, whether or not
they have any personal ties to the
University, can give through the
Corporate Gilts Program, and
the Foundations Gifts Program
accepts gifts from large research
groups. Finally, the Trusts and
Bequests Program enables
alumni to lea\ e a little something
lor Stanford in their will.
Each program has a national
chairman, and most are divided
into regional committees.
The Major Gifts Program, for
example, is made up of I iv e areas
each containing a collection ol
cities in a different area ot the
country. The volunteers who
work in the Major Gifts commit
tees must know the University
very well, according to Fulton,
and they must represent Stan
lord in a high-level way. It is not
surprising that the national and
area chairman in Major Gilts
also sit on the Board ol Trustees
ot the University.
The Annual l und includes
seven categories: Special
Gilts ($lO,OOO $25,000). Per
sonal Solicitation ($250-
$10,000). General Appeal
($250 and under). Parents
Committee (lor parents ol stu
dents ). Student Development
(lor recent graduates and
seniors). Professional Funds (for
donations to athletics — the
Buck Club — and protessional
schools — law. business,
medicine, etc.). and the Class
l und (another avenue lot small
donations, like the General Ap
peal ).
Each program has its own in
dividual methods lor soliciting
gilts, ranging from a painstaking,
vears-long process lor Major
Gilts to mass mailings lor the
Annual Fund. But the basic idea
lor all ol them. I niton savs. is to
reach all those ready and able to
give.
It is obvious to the fundraisers
which alums are able to give
Major Gilts. Fulton said, "but
that is not to say there aren't
happy surprises." Basically, a

volunteer from the Major Gifts
Program will approach a poten
tial donor with the idea of mak
ing a gift, and in a process that
may take years, try to match the
University's needs with the indi
\ idual's interests. The main diffi
culty usually encountered. Ful
ton said, is the desire of many
potential donors to give a very
restricted gift.
A restricted gilt is one that is
gi\en for a single purpose.
But. large gilts which are totalis
unrestricted are exceedingly
rare. Fulton said.
The more genera! a gilt is. the
more useful it is to the L'ni\ersity
and thus the volunteer tries to

broaden the scope of jj potential
gift.
If. for example, a donor wants
to give money to create an en
dowed professor's chair in
American Studies — and the
University already has two such
chairs — the volunteer on the
case would ask if the donor
would endow a chair in another
department — perhaps
humanities — and thus enable
the University to hire a professor
tor a less fleshed out department.
According to Fulton, major
gilts tend to be earmarked for
such things as scholarships and
fellowships, endowed books, en
dowed chairs and buildings.
Currently, the Major Gifts

Program is.trying to raise money
for the new music building.
Committee members meet and
leaf through sheets of names,
discussing whose interest in the
performing arts might be suffi
cient to prompt a donation.
Volunteers in the Annual
Fund have a slightly different
emphasis. Here the idea is to in
still in as many alumni as possible
the tradition of giving. At
Dartmouth. (">0 percent of its
alums give to their alma mater.
Fulton says, while only 25 per
cent ot Stanford grads do
likewise. The main goal of the
Annual Fund is to up this figure.
"We've got to get rid of the
