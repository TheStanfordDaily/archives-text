# It's tough to say no to $1 million, but it happens
##

Last year, the University officially ac
cepted more than $64 million in gilts
from corporations, foundations and pri
vate individuals.
That is. $f>4 million of acceptable gilts.
The key is that not all gifts offered can be
accepted. Trustees give heavy considera
tion to restrictions placed on gifts, rather
than blindly accepting every gift offer.
However, trustees and fundraisers
agree that, although the University can
not accept all the real estate, stock,
artwork and money gifts offered, rejec
tion of a gift is a rare occurrence.
"We don't get a lot of people knocking
on our door saying, 'We want to start a
school of forestry,' " explained John
Cosov ich. director of major-gift fundrais
ing here. Cosov ich said this*is because
fundraisers have "an understanding of
what the University's academic goals
are."
Protection of academic goals and. in
particular, academic freedom is the main
concern of the Board of Trustees when
considering whether to accept a gift. Dr.
Peter Bing, president of the board, said,
"The board is inflexible about not accept
ing gifts that infringe on academic free
dom." Bing has praised the board for
what he calls the "courage" to refuse even
substantial gilts and grants which had
strings attached.

A few years ago, not infringing on
academic freedom meant giving up
$750,000 in government funds. Trustees
recall that at that time the federal gov
ernment requested American medical
schools to accept a quota of American
medical students studying abroad. The
government also asked for changes in
medical school curricula to include
courses on sexual dysfunction.
111 return for compliance with the gov
ernment program universities were to
receive "capitation fees." a specified sum
of money for each enrolled medical stu
dent'
The government restrictions, however,
infringed on'the University's rights to
freely select students and curricula. Stan
lord and sc\ eral other institutions refused
the offer and lost the $750,000 it had
been receiving annually.
At tirst, Stanford and Yale were the
only major universities to reject the gov
ernment offer. Later, other universities
joined the lobby to repeal the restrictions.
Cosov ich said Congress has since dropped
the requirements.
The University also pays close atten
tion to issues of academic freedom
whenever it accepts an endowed profes
sorship. according to David Fulton, direc
tor of development communications.
An endowed chair, as such gifts are cal
led, costs $1 million or more and "is more
useful the more broadly it is construed."

Fulton said.
' Let's say somebody 40 years ago ga\ e
us an endowed chair lor the study ot
polio." Fulton explained. At that time,
polio was a dangerous disease worthy ot
intensive reseraeh. Now. Fulton said, the
chair "would he an anachronism."
Immunology, a more general research
topic, would he a better choice for a gift.
Fulton said.
Last year, for instance, the board
negotiated with an anonymous donor to
loosen conditions placed on what is now
the George Edwin Burnell chair in the
Religious Studies Dept.
The board accepted the chair only after
insuring that its holder have no legal obli
gation to lecture on the philosophy of
Burnell* a prominent Christian Scientist
o! the 19205.
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of the
Religious Studies Department and holder
of the Burnell chair, calls the revisions
minor."l wouldn't accept a chair that told
me what to think." Clebsch said.
Clebsch said the protection of academic
freedom can be taken too far. It a chair is
too broadly defined it can be shifted from
one department to another department or
school within the University, a situation
he sees as a potential threat to departmen
tal stability.
Protection ol academic freedom is only
one consideration 'of board members
when they accept, reject or negotiate the

conditions of a gift.
U Tf ;i donor gave the University an
JLartwork, say. a very valuable paint
ing. on condition it be displayed in per
petuity," Pulton said, the board might ask
lor a revision of that condition.
Gifts donated through a bequest in a
will of a donor may also require special
consideration it the conditions of the gilts
are questionable. "The more funds that
are unrestricted and are for general use,
the more useful those funds are." accord
ing to trustee William Eberle.
In one case, a donor's will provided for
a scholarship fund for Stanford students
from Inglewood. Calif.
The trustees decided to lessen the fund's
restrictions so that other students would
be eligible for funding because current
enrollment of students from Inglewood is
limited. The conditions of the gift were
revised through a court action.
In all cases, donor restrictions become
"a question of reasonableness," Eberle
said.
To make the donation process as
smooth as possible. Pulton said, there is
"often prolonged discussion" between a
donor and University representatives.
Fulton emphasized the "case by case" na
ture of the process.
And how does the University approach
a rejected donor? "Very cautiously."
Eberle said."lf they're reasonable, they'll
understand a very difficult situation."
