What do the Human Biology Program, the Lucie Stern Profes
sorship in Philosophy, the Tanner Fountain and the Building 120
Reconstruction have in common?
All were made possible through the generosity of University
benefactors.
With tuition slated to rise to $6285 next year, it's difficult to
believe the University still must depend so heavily on fundraising
income. But the fact is that tuition pays only 50 percent of a
student's education here. While gifts alone do not make up the
other 50 percent, virtually all new academic buildings and many
programs are made possible only through outside funding.
Last year, the University received 54,450 separate gifts, total
ing $64.5 million. In other words, the Office of Development here
brought in $175,000 each day to support a myriad of University
needs.
So fundraising at a major educational institution like Stanford,
is a vitally important subject. But "development," as the Univer
sity prefers to term it, is one of the most complex and least
understood activities in which the University engages.
As a result, we decided to devote a magazine to the subject of
fundraising. There is no "Cover Story," but rather a series of
stories exploring several key aspects of development.
included are articles on some of the interesting gift giving
"plans" the University has set up to make philanthropy easier,
some of the general methodology of fundraising, and some of the
people who have helped move the University into the number
two spot, behind Harvard, in annual gift receipts to private educa
tional institutions.
We hope you find the material interesting and informative.
