## Secret hit list rumored Kadafi purges Libyan exiles 
### Doyle McManus The Los Angeles Times 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — At
least eight Arab exiles are mur
dered, and dark warnings go out
to others. The most recent victim
is found in Athens with his head
nearly severed by blows from an
ax.
A series of mysterious explo
sions reportedly rocks one of the
Middle East's strategic oilfields.
The explosions are rfever
explained, but Palestine Libera
tion Organization officers in
Beirut whisper of coups, and
rumors of coups.
Foreigners, including two
Americans, are imprisoned —
some as accused spies. Embas
sies are closed, diplomats expel
led.
This sounds like the stuff of a
paperback thriller — and there is
more: fanatical death squads
armed with a secret hit list, a
mercurial Arab strongman, links
with international terrorism, a
whiff of oil.
In fact, all this is the latest
ohapter in the erratic, often
brutal saga of Col. Moammar
Kadafi, the charismatic desert
mystic who has ruled his under
populated North African coun
try of Libya for lOV2 years.
Return home
Last month, Kadafi com
manded all Libyan exiles to re
turn home immediately, or face
"liquidation" — evidence that
he meant what he said. At least
four members of the small com
munity of anti-Kadafi Libyans
abroad had already been mur
dered.
After the colonel's ultimatum,
the assassins came out into the
open, leaving pro-Kadafi pam
phlets and daubing revolutio
nary slogans on walls at the
scfcnes of their murders. The
death total now is eight or nine,
there being some uncertainty
over whether one man was killed
by the Libyan leader's hit-men.
And when the United States
expelled four of Kadafi's "dip
lomats," he threatened to cut off
Libyan oil supplies, which make
up about four percent of U.S.
imports.
Why?
Why the sudden, vicious
purge?" Paranoia," an Arab dip

lomat suggested. And an Arab
scholar who recently visited
Tripoli, the Libyan capital, ag
reed.
"Kadafi is not in any real trou
ble, not that anyone can see," he
said. "The exiles are not a real
threat. This looks like pre
emptive self-defense. He is af
raid the exiles might become a
threat, and he wants to stop that
before it gets started."
In 1974, he declared unity
with his neighbor to the West,
Tunisia, but when that marriage
turned sour, Kadafi reportedly
sent three assassins to kill Tuni
sian President Habib Bourguiba.
Lambasting
Kadafi has lambasted and con
tested almost every Arab leader,
including Yasser Arafat, chief of
the Palestine Liberation Organi
zation, for being insufficiently
anti-Israel. He once waved a pis
tol threateningly at King Hussein
of Jordan.
When he decreed that Libya
should turn away from both
communism and capitalism, and
adopt his "green book" of Is
lamic socialism, Kadafi bluntly
told his country's middle class:
"A socialist country cannot rec
ognize a capitalist class: that
class must disappear.
It is that policy of radical
socialization, proclaimed in
1977, that has driven many
members of Libya's "capitalist
class" abroad.
Kickbacks
Others have fled since Kadafi
began a purge late last year
against officials and businessmen
accused of arranging commis
sions and kickbacks on
multimillion-dollar government
contracts.
About 2000 Libyans — repor
tedly including more than 100
junior army officers — have
been arrested and tried by
"people's" revolutionary com
mittees.
"They put the trials on televi
sion," said a Lebanese journalist
just back from Libya. "Incredi
ble — people shouting charges,
and the guy shouts back his de
fense."
Diplomats believe that many
of the accused have been exe
cuted. although they say they
have no confirmation of this.

If there were an organized op
position to Kadafi, it would
probably rally around Lt. Col.
Omar Muhayshi, one of Kadafi's
aides in the 1 969 coup that over
threw King Idris. Muhayshi lied
Libya in 1 975 after an open con
flict with Kadafi, whom he later
called "a dangerous psycho
path." Kadafi accused Muhayshi
of attempting to overthrow him.
Muhayshi now lives in Egypt,
whose president, Anwar Sadat,
has publicly called Kadafi "the
lunatic of Libya" and expressed
a desire to see the colonel over
thrown.
Kadafi came to power in a
bloodless coup in 1969, over
throwing King Mohammed Idris.
Kadafi, who was then only 31,
announced that foreign bases —
the rent from which was Libya's
main source of income — would
be closed, and that Libya would
join the Arab nationalist camp
led by Egypt's President Gamal
Abdel Nasser, another young of
ficer who had overthrown a king.
In those days, Kadafi was the
dewy-eyed idealist of the Arab
world, ready for "total unity"
with Egypt, Syria and the Sudan
at a moment's notice.
