# South Korean city returns to normal

KWANGJU, South Korea —
The vegetable carts reappeared
on the streets of Kwangju yes
terday, signalling a Teturn to
normal after 10 days of protest,
anti-government riots and a
shoot-out that brought the city
back under military control.
The citizens were without
fresh food for much of that
period, and the market was
doing a brisk business. Govern
ment supplies of food and
medicine were also on the way.
Troops and tanks dominate
the city, the heaviest concentra
tion being in a downtown plaza
where for several days tens of
thousands had gathered to pro
test martial law and other actions
of the military leadership.
The new Korean military
leadership under Lt. Gen. Chun
Doo Hwan is asserting itself
against any internal challenge.
This military group, composed
largely of generals from the late
president Park's home province
who rose to favor under his
tutelage and shaped themselves
in his image, decided on the af
ternoon of May 17 to take power
under total martial law and im
pose it on the existing civilian
government.
The crucial decision was taken
without consultation with the
United States, which considered
it an overreaction to events at
that time and subsequently pro
tested the decision to the Korean
leaders.
The martial law takeover and
the arrest of many dissidents and
political leaders, including vete
ran opposition leader Kim Dae
Jung, touched oft the rebellion in
Kwangju, the capital of Kim's
home province and historic
center of dissidence from Seoul's
rule.
The plaza was the scene of the
shootings early Tuesday morn
ing when government troops
drove into the city and routed
young militant holdouts to take
control of this city of 800,000.
There were no visible signs of
more anti-government protests.
The sound of gunfire was heard
briefly yesterday morning, citi
zens said, but its origin was un
known.
As they resumed a semblance

of normal activity, the people of
Kwangju were wary of talking
about the Tuesday assault that
dislodged holdouts from the
provincial headquarters and
ended the rebellion.
An American who lives here
said his Korean friends felt the
pre-dawn attack was "pretty
much inevitable. People felt it
had to come."
"Compared with what had
happened last week, it wasn't so
bad," he said, referring to the
army's initial violent attempts to
suppress student demonstrations
and massive street protests. "I
think they felt they would do
what they had to do and no
more." Like others interviewed,
the American declined to give
his name.
"We expect things to return to
normal from now on." he added.
Aside from the overwhelming
presence of troops, tanks and
other military vehicles, the most
vivid reminder of Kwangju's
troubles was a group of citizens
clustered outside a large public
gymnasium on one side of the
plaza.
They were waiting to view the
bodies of the 65 persons killed in
last week's battles. The bodies of
those unidentified still are on
display inside the building, and
more than two dozen persons
had gathered to determine
whether missing relatives were
among the dead.
A new "emergency" citizens'
committee has been formed and
was assured yesterday that one
of its initial requests of the milit
ary commander — permission to
hold regular Wednesday evening
church services — would be
granted.
The committee is preparing to
distribute emergency food and
medical supplies sent by the gov -
ernment. Both were in short
supply as the holdout continued
and the government troops sea
led off almost all roads leading
into the city.
Tliis was the first day of nor
mal street activity since the
shoot-out. Most people had
stayed indoors throughout
Tuesday as troops searched for
persons suspected of having tried
to defend the provincial head
quarters and another fortified
spot, Kwangju Park.
