# Trips to rural China start
## 
### Leslie Hornung Staff Writer 
Foreigners have only recently been allowed
to visit rural China, and a few Americans will
have that opportunity this summer. Several
trips, sponsored by the Chinamerican Corpora
tion. are being arranged to the southern
Chinese village of Tai Shan in the Guangdong
province. Visitors will fly to Hong Kong, take a
train to Canton and board a minibus to Tai
Shan, crossing three major rivers by ferry.
Trips to the area are not like the typical "five
cities in two weeks" excursion to China. The
three-week journey, costing $2000. includes
two weeks in Tai Shan, where visitors arc en
couraged to explore that particular aspect of
rural China which interests them most. Previous
visitors observed rural communes and hospitals,
hiked up Stone Flower Mountain, exercised
with the villagers anil meandered through the
marketplace.
The Chinamerican Corporation, with a com
mitment to appropriate technology, is also
building China's first and only solar inn in Tai
Shan. The 40-bcdroom inn was designed by Jon
Hammond, a solar designer and architect (rom

Davis, California. The inn will include solar
panels for passive space and water heating, lots
of "thermal mass" from the heavy brick build
ing materials, and naturally ventilated rooms
connected together.
Approval for the inn concept was granted by
the local community and provincial and na
tional authorities. After 12 years, ownership of
the inn will revert to the Chinese.
Hammond, who is familiar with appropriate
solar home designs for various U.S. climates,
said the inn will be built "in a style compatible
with Chinese building techniques, but we'll in
troduce the best kinds of solar technology avail
able." Using Chinese workers and materials,
the inn will be completed this fall.
A slide presentation describing the Tai Shan
area of China and details about the trip will be
held at Bechtel International Center today at
4:15 p.m.. and also at the Palo Alto Cultural
Center on Wednesday, June 4 at 7:30 p.m.
Larry Davis, president of the Chinamerican
Corporation, will tell about his personal experi
ences in China and answer questions about the
trip «>r the solar inn. ♦
