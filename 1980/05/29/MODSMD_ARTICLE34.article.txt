economic hardships.
But neither Khomeini nor Bani-Sadr
mentioned the hostages, who spent their
207 th day in captivity — and Austrian

Greece, he thought there was only "a fair
chance that the hostages will he released
sooner or later."
Kreisky, who recently returned from
meetings in Tehran with Iranian leaders,
said Iran "is not ready to give in to any
kind of pressure." And in Washington,
State Department spokesman Thomas

would await Iranian reaction to the World
Court decision ordering the hostages' re
lease before taking its case for sanctions
back to the United Nations. Iran has al
ready called the World ( uirt decision
"meaningless."

tion. continued to simmer, spewing a
plume of steam and ash 3 miles high.
With the death toll at 21 and 7 I people
listed as missing, a do/en helicopters
searched under clearing skies for possible
survivors. But authorities said there is lit
tle chance ol finding any more people
alive and the air search probably will be
called off by the weekend.

the first two days following the eruption,
but since then have found only dead
bodies and a German shepherd with her
pups.
Two moderate earthquakes shook
Mount Margaret, about eight miles
north-northwest of the volcano yester
day. but scientists did not know what con

miles to the west. They also rattled the
Cowlitz County jail in Longview.
Unemployment surge seen
WASHINGTON — Americans tiled
more claims for unemployment insurance
during mid-May than in any week since at
least 1967, an ominous sign of a new surge
; in the nation's jobless rate, the govern
[ment reported yesterday.
The Labor Department said a season
lally adjusted record of 675.000 Ameri-
Icans filed new claims for jobless benefits
in the week ending May 17, a sharp jump

from the previous high of 616,000 first
time claims recorded the week before.
The latest figure is the highest for new
claims filed in one week since the gov
ernment began collecting seasonally ad
justed figures 13 years ago.
Unemployment shot up from 6.2 per
cent in March to a 7 percent rate in April,
the largest one-month jump since the
depths of the last recession. Each rise of
one percentage point in the unemploy
ment rate means 1,040,000 more Ameri
cans are out of work.
"It seems quite probable . . . that the
economy is already experiencing its shar
pest fall during the current quarter." Mil
ler told the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress. "The worst may be behind us."
