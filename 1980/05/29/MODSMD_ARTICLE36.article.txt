# Prop. 9 blasted here
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
The problems that the elderly and poor
people would face if Proposition 9. the
California income tax-cutting initiative,
passes in the June 3 state referendum
were the main topics of a demonstration
in White Plaza Monday night.
Sponsored by the Conference tor Race,
Religion and Social Concerns, a local citi
zen's action group, the rally against the
so-called Jarvis II bill drew a crowd of 70
Palo Alto-area residents.
Highlighting the demonstration, East
Palo Alto councilwoman and former
mayor Gertrude Wilkes claimed that
Prop. 9 will hurt the poor and un
employed the hardest.
" It's only so far you can oppress people,
then they won't take it anymore. Then
people are going to break out, if people
see no hope," said Wilkes.
"I don't think that we can continue to
close off, cut out, and shut off and expect
people to behave themselves," Wilkes
said. "We've got to deal with the prob
lems of the inner cities. We can't hide it,
or pretend it isn't there just because it's on
the other side of the highway."
If Prop. 9 passes, she declared,
"You're gonna have little Floridas and
little Georgias all over the place," refer
ring to the recent racial uprisings in Miami
and in Wrightsvillc, Ga.
Citing drastic budget cuts already made
by Prop. 13 two years ago, which, accord
ing to Wilkes, affected East Palo Alto's
Police Department, social worker and
probation officer staffs and other public
services, Wilkes said, "Prop, nine really
frightens me because wc already under
stand what it means."
Rabbi Sidney Axelrod, of the Beth Am
Reform Synagogue in Los Altos, claimed
that aid for the elderly in the form of

programs such as "meals on wheels,"
transportation for the handicapped and
other services currently available free to
the elderly would be affected.
"These programs for the elderly have
been taken for granted, but they are an
absolute necessity (for the elderly),"
Axelrod said.
"Above all, we must avoid bringing hell
into people's lives . . . by fighting this vici
ous bill," he added.
Milo Gwosden, co-chairman of the
"No on Nine" committee of Palo Alto,
compared the government to an over
weight race horse which the owner would
like to get back into shape. The best way
to do this, Gwosden said, is by controlling
the horse's diet, not by cutting its legs
(vital government services) off.
Also speaking at the rally were: the
Lutheran Campus Pastor here, Manfred
Bahmann, the superintendent of schools
of the Milpitas School District, Pete
Messa, and the executive minister of the
Council of Churches in Santa Clara
County, Dr. Dwight Kintner. Joe
Hochmann, the Mountain View resident
who organized the rally, also spoke
briefly.
"It's really incredible, the number of
various community organizations that
have come together to oppose this bill,"
said Bahmann after the rally, indicating a
long list of "No on Nine" supporters.
B'nai B'rith, NAACP, Senate of the
Archdiocese of San Francisco and the
California State Employees Association,
as well as 30 other advocacy groups in the
area, have all announced their opposition
to the bill. University president Richard
Lyman is Honorary Chairman of "No on
Nine" Citizens For California.
Jarvis 11, which is trailing in the most
recent polls, will be on the state referen
dum June 3,

ous bill," he added.
Milo Gwosden, co-chairman of the
"No on Nine" committee of Palo Alto,
compared the government to an over
weight race horse which the owner would
like to get back into shape. The best way
to do this, Gwosden said, is by controlling
the horse's diet, not by cutting its legs
(vital government services) off.
Also speaking at the rally were: the
Lutheran Campus Pastor here, Manfred
Bahmann, the superintendent of schools
of the Milpitas School District, Pete
Messa, and the executive minister of the
Council of Churches in Santa Clara
County, Dr. Dwight Kintner. Joe
Hochmann, the Mountain View resident
who organized the rally, also spoke
briefly.
"It's really incredible, the number of
various community organizations that
have come together to oppose this bill,"
said Bahmann after the rally, indicating a
long list of "No on Nine" supporters.
B'nai B'rith, NAACP, Senate of the
Archdiocese of San Francisco and the
California State Employees Association,
as well as 30 other advocacy groups in the
area, have all announced their opposition
to the bill. University president Richard
Lyman is Honorary Chairman of "No on
Nine" Citizens For California.
