# Anatomy of fundraising success
## Project heads seek funding 
### Sara Lessley Staff Writer 
Suppose it's 1969. You're a
distinguished faculty member
with a great idea for an interdis
ciplinary program in the
humanities and sciences open
only to undergraduates. Suppose
an expanded planning commit
tee enlarges and enthusiastically
supports the idea. And even
suppose the University approves
the proposal.
You still have a big obstacle
blocking the success of your
grand plan — money.
You figure you need about $2
million just to get the program
off the ground. What do you do
next?
The problem isn't uncommon.
Behind almost every University
proposal, project or plan there's
a need for raising funds. That is
the job of the University Office
of Development.
In the case of our scenario, a
prestigious foundation actually
did grant $1.9 million for this
proposal, with the proviso that
the University match some of the
funds. By most accounts the
money has been well spent: the
scenario's real-life model is the

popular Human Biology Prog
ram.
Although the story behind the
Hum Bio Program isn't quite
that simple, it does illustrate
what Richard Bennett, director
of development administration,
calls the "paradigm of fundrais
ing — the perfect example of all
the elements working together."
A faculty proposal, project ap
proval, a foundation grant,
matching provisions and gifts
from individuals make Hum Bio
a good example of a fundraising
success.
According to Bennett, a fa
culty idea or proposal is often the
first step in the fundraising pro
cess. The backers work out a ten
tative budget and program de
tails. Next, the proposal's au
thors seek University approval
through the provost's office. The
office must give program ap
proval and fundraising approval.
Only then does the Develop
ment Office enter the picture,
Bennett said.
C 4 undraising absolutely
A does not set priorities for
the University," he added.
Finally, depending on the type
of proposal, several fundraising

sources are considered. The
University generally obtains its
annual $50 to $60 million in gifts
from four areas: foundations,
corporations, individual gifts,
and wills and bequests.
Bennett said a foundation is
"the most likely place" to raise
money for a proposal like Hum
Bio.
Corporations usually give
"moderate amounts ranging
from $5000 to $200,000 " Ben
nett said. Occasionally the sum is
larger, but few corporations will
give millions of dollars, he said.
Living individuals typically
give gifts of a few dollars to about
$500,000, he said. Also they
tend to have "their own in
terests," from athletics to scho
larships, which makes it more
difficult to approach them with
University priorities, Bennett
said.
Wills and bequests reflect pre
determined interests of the
donors. Such after-the-fact gifts,
then, are not a source to seek out
for funds.
A r\umber of endowments
(gifts'ip which the original
sum is invested and only a por
tion of the interest spent) do
come from wills and bequests
since the donors often want to
leave a permanent gift. Corpora
tions and foundations, on the
other hand, prefer to see their
funds used in the short-term,
Bennett said.
Foundations, however, are
more likely to give si/able grants
in areas of University need.
"You can take University in
terests to a foundation to look at
an exciting proposal and if it's
kind of in line with the directions
of the foundation." it may be wil
ling to fund the project. Bennett
said.
In the Hum Bio case, the Ford
Foundation was a fairly natural
choice for the funding request.
According to Bennett, in the
1950s and 1960s the foundation
was "the most generous to edu
cation." its primary interest.
In addition, Bennett added,
most top professors have a
"good feel" for which founda
tions are interested in their work
and so are aware of which found
ations may be willing u> fund
their projects.
Sociology Prof. Sandy
Dornbusch said the Hum Bio
saga began when two Stanford
faculty met with a Ford Founda
tion representative in late fall ol
1965.
Dornbusch said David Ham
burg, then head of the Medical

School Psychiatry Department,
and Paul Ehrlich, biology profes
sor. returned from New York,
both believing there was a "real
opportunity to build a different
kind of program based on Stan
ford's own resources."
The resulting committee con
sisted of then department heads
Albert Hastorf (Psychology),
Joshua Lcderberg (Genetics).
Norman Kretchmcr (Pediatrics),
Donald Kennedy (Biology),
former Sociology Department
head Dornbusch, and Hamburg
and Ehrlich. Hopkins Marine
Station Director Colin Pitten
drigh joined the group later.
The committee presented a
more detailed, but still informal
proposal to an enthusiastic foun
dation in early 1% 1 ), Dornbusch
said.
As the plans were refined, he
said the committee began to
worry that a successful program
might make it vet another of
many pressures on the Univer
sity budget requiring the ad
ministration to find funds some
where.
So the committee added $1.2
million to its budget for half the
cost of four endowed chairs. The
sum was in addition to $700.000
to start and run the program for
the first five years. Meanwhile,
the University had agreed to
provide a number of support ser
vices, such as supplies, space and
secretarial assistance.
The word came back from the
Ford Foundation — it never
gave money for endowed chairs.
Two foundation staffers arrived
to make an offer of about $ 1 mill
ion to Kretchmer and
Dornbusch. They refused the
money, holding out for the total
SI .9 million to protect the prog
ram, Dornbusch said.
The foundation "found us so
adamant and the program so de
sirable that regardless of Ford
Foundation policy" an exception
was made, and the program was
granted $ 1.9 million in October
1 969.
The Office of Development
found donors for the four chairs
during the 1972-77 Campaign
lor Stanford, which netted the
University $300 million total.
The professorships are named
for the individual or group which
funded the second half of the en
dowed chair. The last one was
funded in 1977, about eight
years after the foundation gave
the original funds.
Today, more than 10 years
after the initial grant, the fun
draising segment of the program
is not over.
Dornbusch said the "original,
apparently ample funding
proved inadequate in part be
cause of the success of the prog
ram." He said the large number
of human biology students, re
quiring more course offerings,
plus inflation, have forced the
program to "constantly beg for
money" from the University.
And program directors have
"begun to talk about future at
tempts to raise more funds," he
said.
