# Anatomy of fundraising success
## Project heads seek funding 
### Sara Lessley Staff Writer 
Suppose it's 1969. You're a
distinguished faculty member
with a great idea for an interdis
ciplinary program in the
humanities and sciences open
only to undergraduates. Suppose
an expanded planning commit
tee enlarges and enthusiastically
supports the idea. And even
suppose the University approves
the proposal.
You still have a big obstacle
blocking the success of your
grand plan — money.
You figure you need about $2
million just to get the program
off the ground. What do you do
next?
The problem isn't uncommon.
Behind almost every University
proposal, project or plan there's
a need for raising funds. That is
the job of the University Office
of Development.
In the case of our scenario, a
prestigious foundation actually
did grant $1.9 million for this
proposal, with the proviso that
the University match some of the
funds. By most accounts the
money has been well spent: the
scenario's real-life model is the

popular Human Biology Prog
ram.
Although the story behind the
Hum Bio Program isn't quite
that simple, it does illustrate
what Richard Bennett, director
of development administration,
calls the "paradigm of fundrais
ing — the perfect example of all
the elements working together."
A faculty proposal, project ap
proval, a foundation grant,
matching provisions and gifts
from individuals make Hum Bio
a good example of a fundraising
success.
According to Bennett, a fa
culty idea or proposal is often the
first step in the fundraising pro
cess. The backers work out a ten
tative budget and program de
tails. Next, the proposal's au
thors seek University approval
through the provost's office. The
office must give program ap
proval and fundraising approval.
Only then does the Develop
ment Office enter the picture,
Bennett said.

A does not set priorities for
the University," he added.
Finally, depending on the type
of proposal, several fundraising

sources are considered. The
University generally obtains its
annual $50 to $60 million in gifts
from four areas: foundations,
corporations, individual gifts,
and wills and bequests.
Bennett said a foundation is
"the most likely place" to raise
money for a proposal like Hum
Bio.
Corporations usually give
"moderate amounts ranging
from $5000 to $200,000 " Ben
nett said. Occasionally the sum is
larger, but few corporations will
give millions of dollars, he said.
Living individuals typically
give gifts of a few dollars to about
$500,000, he said. Also they
tend to have "their own in
terests," from athletics to scho
larships, which makes it more
difficult to approach them with
University priorities, Bennett
said.
Wills and bequests reflect pre
determined interests of the
donors. Such after-the-fact gifts,
then, are not a source to seek out
for funds.
