# Fundraising: A Challenge for the 80's
## 
### Mike Charlson Staff Writer 
It was Leland Stanford's inten
tion that his founding grant
would support the entire opera
tion of the University. Income
from the endowment was to pay
Everything from professors'
salaries to maintenance costs.
But that was a long time ago.
That was before the University
consisted of seven schools,
numerous institutes and study
centers, and well over 1000 fa
culty. That was before the Uni
versity stood as one ol the
preeminent institutions of higher
education in the nation.
To maintain today's standing,
the University must depend
heavily on outside funding for
new programs, buildings and fa
culty positions.
Amazingly. Stanford has met
the challenge of raising those
funds. Despite its "late start" in
the fundraising race, the Univer
sity now ranks second in annual
gilt receipts to private univer
sities. behind perennial leader
I larvard.
Gift receipts have increased
20-fold over the last 30 years,
more than doubling in the last 10
(see graph). Gifts totaled $(">4.5
million last year and administra
tion officials have so much confi
dence in the institution's ability
to maintain such funding levels
that budget planners say they
will require gift levels of more
than $50 million consistently in
the future.
What has prompted such
growth?
"Competence." said Joel
Smith, vice president for de
velopment. "We've got the com
petence to deal with serious
fundraising problems quickly
and effectively."
Smith directs the University
112 u ndraisi ng operations,
often referred to as "develop
ment."
When a person is considering a
gift, especially a major gift, he
wants to know that he is dealing

with professionals. Smith said in
a recent interview "I think we're
successful because we treat
people correctly."
Of course, it takes more than
just good treatment. The Uni
versity's reputation is a huge
boost to development efforts.
Moreover, in relatively lew
years, the University has begun
to assemble an "old boy" system
which ri\als some Ivy League in
stitutions. Such worldwide net
work is invaluable to fundraising
efforts.
I lle University also is a strong
innovator. A perfect example is
the $300 million Campaign for
Stanford. The five-year drive,
completed in was the first
ot its kind. And. more impor
tantly. it was a complete success.
Since the campaign began to
push University gilt receipts way
'up. other institutions have un
dertaken campaigns ol their
own. many modeled closely on
the Stanford effort.
The University also boasts
some innov ativ e ways for
donating to Stanford — prog
rams designed to make it easy for
a person to be generous by tak
ing advantage of tax incentives
and special donor interests.
These issues combine to im
prove the University's reputa
tion in the fundraising commun
ity.
Still, raising funds is not au
tomatic. The current economic
crunch may injure the Universi
ty's ability to raise needed
monies.
And. even if the University is
able to raise funds for certain
projects, inflationary pressures
will tend to counter positive ef
forts from the fundraising stall.
Building costs escalate so
quickly, for example, that the an
ticipated price increase for the
new NOO-unit student residence,
due solely to inflation, is $50.000
each week.
For this reason, we have called
tins magazine "112 undraising at
Stanford: The Challenge for the
"SOs."
