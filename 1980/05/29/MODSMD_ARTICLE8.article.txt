# About the Cover
## 
### 

Our cover artist, Cathy Tetef. a senior majoring in design,
tried to capture the essence of today's magazine in her graphic
interpretation of "Fundraising at Stanford." Her design reflects
the multi-faceted complexity and future implications of the fun
draising issue. The individual patterns in the design derive from
the repetition and juxtaposition ot various financial symbols.
These abstract elements mesh and interweave to form a graphic
whole. Suggested in the boldness ol the design is the urgency and
importance of the fundraising issue.
