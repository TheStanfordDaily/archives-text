# Stanford ranks 2nd in gifts
## 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
The debate continues irresolutely over which
university is academically superior to which
other uni\ersit\. Collegiate athletic teams vie vig
orously on the field and in the gym to establish
physical predominance. But on one front, the bat
tle is not so pitched, and the results are not so
contestable. Fundraising figures do not lie.
Stanford has been No. 2 in private-institution
fundraising. consistently to Harvard, for quite a
long time, according to Da\ id Fulton, director ol
development communications. In 1977-78. the
most recent year for which statistics are available,
the University amassed a grand total of support of
$54.5 million, compared to Harvard's $63.6 mill
ion and third-place Yale's $45.1 million. In its last
fi\ e-year campaign, ending a year ago. the Univer
sity raised $300 million.
Those numbers, however, as indicative of fun
draising effort as they may be, do not tell the entire
story.
Almost all people judge by the numbers." admit
ted Vice President for Development Joel Smith.
"But success is really much more than that. It's
crucial to meet our goals." he said. The bottom
line figures are important, but the match-up ol
acquired funds and stated goals is overriding, ac
cording to Smith.
Stanford's success in those terms is considered
outstanding by Smith because "we understand our
underlying objectives and the process for meeting
those objectives better than other places. We in
\ est a lot of time into understanding what I call the
institutional agenda," he said. "We really have a
good idea of what we want to accomplish."
That "bottom-up" process begins when the pro
vost and Smith meet with the deans and the direc
tors of major University programs to discover the
needs and aspirations of those academic depart
ments. Then, the provost sorts out those desires
thcmaticallv and sets priorities, while Smith's of
fice investigates the prospects of fundraising for
those needs.
4 «.' I Mie fact that we want something does not
1 mean that we'll automatically get it." Smith
explained.
From those determinations, a fundraising
agenda is constructed, and "we judge our success
by the extent to which we raise the money that
underwrites those objectives," Smith said.
For example, broad categories in the last major
fundraising campaign here were facilities,
academic programs, professorships, fellowships
and libraries. Those headings were further broken
down into what Smith termed "a quite detailed
road map" of objectives.
"It's awfully important to have specific, not just
global goals." he asserted.
The planning work doesn't end with the agenda
outline, though. "It's a continuing job. We have to

keep changing and refining our goals as wc go
along," Smith said. "There's day-to-day surveil
lance of the structure and how it's functioning,"
said Fulton.
"We learn as we go along,'" Smith said. During
the last campaign (the $300 million campaign tor
Stanford), the agenda components were closely
watched over the drive's five-year span. "One
thing we learned then is that we probably won't
succeed in raising money for student housing,"
Smith added as illustration.
Aside from operational efficiency and know
ledge. Fulton attributed the University's fun
draising success to its quality as an institution of
higher learning and its location.
"There has been a meteoric rise in the quality of
Stanford since the 19505," he said. "At that point it
became an attractive object of philanthropy."
Also, the University derives some of its
money-making achievement from its situation in
the West, "where it's conspicuous as the best pri
\ ate university. In the East, there are a lot of excel
lent institutions very close to each other," Fulton
commented.
Yet. I ulton noted that fundraising activity does
not occupy a "dog-eat-dog world. We don't feel a
sense of competition with other schools in fundrais
ing," he claimed. "We want to see them succeed. It's
very important to us that all private institutions do,
well."
Leonard Wines, associate vice president for
I ni\ ersity affairs at USC. agreed with Fulton, "On
the athletic field certainly schools compete. In fun
draising. the competition is for public attention."
he said. "We help each other out in many areas, so
we're not a rival," he added.
USC collected a total of $33.2 million in 1977-
7<S but led the nation by a large margin in donations
from non-alumni individuals with $16 million.
In the home stretch of a five-year campaign
schedule to end June 30, 19X I. I St' has received
$240 million toward its $265 million target. "The
question now is not will we reach our goal, but how
much will we go over the top." Wines said.
Like Stanford, USC fundraising goals follow
academic goals. "We decide upon our academic
aims, place a price tag on those and then add the
price tags together to make our fundraising goals,"
Wines said.
"Wc often meet our fundraising goals but don't
necessarily meet the academic goals," he said.
"Monies come in tailored to donors' desires and
interests. Unfortunately, people don't die of En
glish," so cancer research may receive a great deal
of support, but academic chairs are ignored.
Pacesetter Harvard is directed by a corporation,
similar in make-up to a board of trustees. Besides
garnering the most overall funding, Harvard ec
lipsed all other schools in 1977-7S'in support from
foundations ($19.7 million), total gifts to its annual

fund ($12.3 million), and endowment market
value (51.4 billion).
Harvard just began a major, five-year drive last
October to earn $250 million, largely for
Harvard College and select professional schools
and programs, acording to Joseph Carr. the direc
tor of communications tor the Harvard develop
ment office.
Carr said Harvard's fundraising accomplish
ments are due in large part to the loyalty ot its
alumni and"the record of this university that
places among the more rcknowned universities in
the world. Harvard has a record ol public serv ice in
terms matched by few other universities." he said.
"Harvard opened in 1681. They've been at this
business a Ippg time." Fulton said.
Harvard's neighbor on the Charles River, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, received
the lion's share of corporate and business financ
ing. with $12.2 million in 1977-7 X. "We receive
about one-third of our support from corporations
and tend to be out front in the country in that
area." said MIT Director of Resource Develop
ment Nelson Lees.
MIT lias developed an industrial liaison prog
ram. including about 200 major corporations from
the Fortune 500. Lees explained. Those busines
ses. spurred by the high level of research underta
ken at MIT. donate regularly to relatively unre
stricted tunds at MIT.
Implementing a goal process equivalent to Stan
lord's. MIT closed out its five-year campaign

four weeks ago with $250.2 million, well above its
$225 million projection.
MITs success points to one competitive element
involved in fundraising — the search for corporate
funding. "We essentially compete for foundation
and corporate support." Fulton said." But it's heal
thy and friendly competition."
Another Ivy League institution. Yale.ran first in
1977-7N in alumni gilts, raising $24 million. "We
do very well with alumni, of which there are just
under 95.000." said Acting Director of Develop
ment David Edwards. "Over many years. Yale
alums have been very generous."
Completed last year, the Campaign for Yale at
tracted $374 million for "our most prominent suc
cess." Edwards said. "Some of Yale's needs that
were identified at the beginning ol the campaign
are still unfulfilled, however." he said.
"Since the campaign concluded, we've been try
ing to do much the same thing as Stanford: that is.
to keep the lev el of gift income up to the lev el ol the
campaign." Edwards said. "This is the lirst year,
and we believe we'll do it."
Currently, Yale's goals, as stated by its presi
dent. are to increase its endowment and to upgrade
its physical plant, particularly the athletic facilities,
[kit. "as yet. there is no order of priority at Yale.
Our objective is cash income." Edwards said.
The v ice presidents for development ol Harvard.
Yale, Princeton and Stanford will meet this sum
mer for three days lor "open-ended discussion."
according to Smith. II present trends continue, the
Ivies may soon seek fundraising advice from this
West Coast institution.

value (51.4 billion).
Harvard just began a major, five-year drive last
October to earn $250 million, largely for
Harvard College and select professional schools
and programs, acording to Joseph Carr. the direc
tor of communications tor the Harvard develop
ment office.
Carr said Harvard's fundraising accomplish
ments are due in large part to the loyalty ot its
alumni and"the record of this university that
places among the more rcknowned universities in
the world. Harvard has a record ol public serv ice in
terms matched by few other universities." he said.
"Harvard opened in 1681. They've been at this
business a Ippg time." Fulton said.
Harvard's neighbor on the Charles River, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, received
the lion's share of corporate and business financ
ing. with $12.2 million in 1977-7 X. "We receive
about one-third of our support from corporations
and tend to be out front in the country in that
area." said MIT Director of Resource Develop
ment Nelson Lees.
MIT lias developed an industrial liaison prog
ram. including about 200 major corporations from
the Fortune 500. Lees explained. Those busines
ses. spurred by the high level of research underta
ken at MIT. donate regularly to relatively unre
stricted tunds at MIT.
Implementing a goal process equivalent to Stan
lord's. MIT closed out its five-year campaign

four weeks ago with $250.2 million, well above its
$225 million projection.
MITs success points to one competitive element
involved in fundraising — the search for corporate
funding. "We essentially compete for foundation
and corporate support." Fulton said." But it's heal
thy and friendly competition."
Another Ivy League institution. Yale.ran first in
1977-7N in alumni gilts, raising $24 million. "We
do very well with alumni, of which there are just
under 95.000." said Acting Director of Develop
ment David Edwards. "Over many years. Yale
alums have been very generous."
Completed last year, the Campaign for Yale at
tracted $374 million for "our most prominent suc
cess." Edwards said. "Some of Yale's needs that
were identified at the beginning ol the campaign
are still unfulfilled, however." he said.
"Since the campaign concluded, we've been try
ing to do much the same thing as Stanford: that is.
to keep the lev el of gift income up to the lev el ol the
campaign." Edwards said. "This is the lirst year,
and we believe we'll do it."
Currently, Yale's goals, as stated by its presi
dent. are to increase its endowment and to upgrade
its physical plant, particularly the athletic facilities,
[kit. "as yet. there is no order of priority at Yale.
Our objective is cash income." Edwards said.
The v ice presidents for development ol Harvard.
Yale, Princeton and Stanford will meet this sum
mer for three days lor "open-ended discussion."
according to Smith. II present trends continue, the
Ivies may soon seek fundraising advice from this
West Coast institution.
The debate continues irresolutely over which
university is academically superior to which
other uni\ersit\. Collegiate athletic teams vie vig
orously on the field and in the gym to establish
physical predominance. But on one front, the bat
tle is not so pitched, and the results are not so
contestable. Fundraising figures do not lie.
Stanford has been No. 2 in private-institution
fundraising. consistently to Harvard, for quite a
long time, according to Da\ id Fulton, director ol
development communications. In 1977-78. the
most recent year for which statistics are available,
the University amassed a grand total of support of
$54.5 million, compared to Harvard's $63.6 mill
ion and third-place Yale's $45.1 million. In its last
fi\ e-year campaign, ending a year ago. the Univer
sity raised $300 million.
Those numbers, however, as indicative of fun
draising effort as they may be, do not tell the entire
story.
Almost all people judge by the numbers." admit
ted Vice President for Development Joel Smith.
"But success is really much more than that. It's
crucial to meet our goals." he said. The bottom
line figures are important, but the match-up ol
acquired funds and stated goals is overriding, ac
cording to Smith.
Stanford's success in those terms is considered
outstanding by Smith because "we understand our
underlying objectives and the process for meeting
those objectives better than other places. We in
\ est a lot of time into understanding what I call the
institutional agenda," he said. "We really have a
good idea of what we want to accomplish."
That "bottom-up" process begins when the pro
vost and Smith meet with the deans and the direc
tors of major University programs to discover the
needs and aspirations of those academic depart
ments. Then, the provost sorts out those desires
thcmaticallv and sets priorities, while Smith's of
fice investigates the prospects of fundraising for
those needs.
4 «.' I Mie fact that we want something does not
1 mean that we'll automatically get it." Smith
explained.
From those determinations, a fundraising
agenda is constructed, and "we judge our success
by the extent to which we raise the money that
underwrites those objectives," Smith said.
For example, broad categories in the last major
fundraising campaign here were facilities,
academic programs, professorships, fellowships
and libraries. Those headings were further broken
down into what Smith termed "a quite detailed
road map" of objectives.
"It's awfully important to have specific, not just
global goals." he asserted.
The planning work doesn't end with the agenda
outline, though. "It's a continuing job. We have to

keep changing and refining our goals as wc go
along," Smith said. "There's day-to-day surveil
lance of the structure and how it's functioning,"
said Fulton.
"We learn as we go along,'" Smith said. During
the last campaign (the $300 million campaign tor
Stanford), the agenda components were closely
watched over the drive's five-year span. "One
thing we learned then is that we probably won't
succeed in raising money for student housing,"
Smith added as illustration.
Aside from operational efficiency and know
ledge. Fulton attributed the University's fun
draising success to its quality as an institution of
higher learning and its location.
"There has been a meteoric rise in the quality of
Stanford since the 19505," he said. "At that point it
became an attractive object of philanthropy."
Also, the University derives some of its
money-making achievement from its situation in
the West, "where it's conspicuous as the best pri
\ ate university. In the East, there are a lot of excel
lent institutions very close to each other," Fulton
commented.
Yet. I ulton noted that fundraising activity does
not occupy a "dog-eat-dog world. We don't feel a
sense of competition with other schools in fundrais
ing," he claimed. "We want to see them succeed. It's
very important to us that all private institutions do,
well."
Leonard Wines, associate vice president for
I ni\ ersity affairs at USC. agreed with Fulton, "On
the athletic field certainly schools compete. In fun
draising. the competition is for public attention."
he said. "We help each other out in many areas, so
we're not a rival," he added.
USC collected a total of $33.2 million in 1977-
7<S but led the nation by a large margin in donations
from non-alumni individuals with $16 million.
In the home stretch of a five-year campaign
schedule to end June 30, 19X I. I St' has received
$240 million toward its $265 million target. "The
question now is not will we reach our goal, but how
much will we go over the top." Wines said.
Like Stanford, USC fundraising goals follow
academic goals. "We decide upon our academic
aims, place a price tag on those and then add the
price tags together to make our fundraising goals,"
Wines said.
"Wc often meet our fundraising goals but don't
necessarily meet the academic goals," he said.
"Monies come in tailored to donors' desires and
interests. Unfortunately, people don't die of En
glish," so cancer research may receive a great deal
of support, but academic chairs are ignored.

similar in make-up to a board of trustees. Besides

The planning work doesn't end with the agenda
outline, though. "It's a continuing job. We have to

keep changing and refining our goals as wc go
along," Smith said. "There's day-to-day surveil
lance of the structure and how it's functioning,"
said Fulton.
"We learn as we go along,'" Smith said. During
the last campaign (the $300 million campaign tor
Stanford), the agenda components were closely
watched over the drive's five-year span. "One
thing we learned then is that we probably won't
succeed in raising money for student housing,"
Smith added as illustration.
Aside from operational efficiency and know
ledge. Fulton attributed the University's fun
draising success to its quality as an institution of
higher learning and its location.
"There has been a meteoric rise in the quality of
Stanford since the 19505," he said. "At that point it
became an attractive object of philanthropy."
Also, the University derives some of its
money-making achievement from its situation in
the West, "where it's conspicuous as the best pri
\ ate university. In the East, there are a lot of excel
lent institutions very close to each other," Fulton
commented.
Yet. I ulton noted that fundraising activity does
not occupy a "dog-eat-dog world. We don't feel a
sense of competition with other schools in fundrais
ing," he claimed. "We want to see them succeed. It's
very important to us that all private institutions do,
well."
Leonard Wines, associate vice president for
I ni\ ersity affairs at USC. agreed with Fulton, "On
the athletic field certainly schools compete. In fun
draising. the competition is for public attention."
he said. "We help each other out in many areas, so
we're not a rival," he added.
USC collected a total of $33.2 million in 1977-
7<S but led the nation by a large margin in donations
from non-alumni individuals with $16 million.
In the home stretch of a five-year campaign
schedule to end June 30, 19X I. I St' has received
$240 million toward its $265 million target. "The
question now is not will we reach our goal, but how
much will we go over the top." Wines said.
Like Stanford, USC fundraising goals follow
academic goals. "We decide upon our academic
aims, place a price tag on those and then add the
price tags together to make our fundraising goals,"
Wines said.
"Wc often meet our fundraising goals but don't
necessarily meet the academic goals," he said.
"Monies come in tailored to donors' desires and

Pacesetter Harvard is directed by a corporation,
similar in make-up to a board of trustees. Besides
garnering the most overall funding, Harvard ec
lipsed all other schools in 1977-7S'in support from
foundations ($19.7 million), total gifts to its annual

fund ($12.3 million), and endowment market
value (51.4 billion).
Harvard just began a major, five-year drive last
October to earn $250 million, largely for
Harvard College and select professional schools
and programs, acording to Joseph Carr. the direc
tor of communications tor the Harvard develop
ment office.
Carr said Harvard's fundraising accomplish
ments are due in large part to the loyalty ot its
alumni and"the record of this university that
places among the more rcknowned universities in
the world. Harvard has a record ol public serv ice in
terms matched by few other universities." he said.
"Harvard opened in 1681. They've been at this
business a Ippg time." Fulton said.
Harvard's neighbor on the Charles River, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, received
the lion's share of corporate and business financ
ing. with $12.2 million in 1977-7 X. "We receive
about one-third of our support from corporations
and tend to be out front in the country in that
area." said MIT Director of Resource Develop
ment Nelson Lees.
MIT lias developed an industrial liaison prog
ram. including about 200 major corporations from
the Fortune 500. Lees explained. Those busines
ses. spurred by the high level of research underta
ken at MIT. donate regularly to relatively unre
stricted tunds at MIT.
Implementing a goal process equivalent to Stan
lord's. MIT closed out its five-year campaign

four weeks ago with $250.2 million, well above its
$225 million projection.
MITs success points to one competitive element
involved in fundraising — the search for corporate
funding. "We essentially compete for foundation
and corporate support." Fulton said." But it's heal
thy and friendly competition."
Another Ivy League institution. Yale.ran first in
1977-7N in alumni gilts, raising $24 million. "We
do very well with alumni, of which there are just
under 95.000." said Acting Director of Develop
ment David Edwards. "Over many years. Yale
alums have been very generous."
Completed last year, the Campaign for Yale at
tracted $374 million for "our most prominent suc
cess." Edwards said. "Some of Yale's needs that
were identified at the beginning ol the campaign
are still unfulfilled, however." he said.
"Since the campaign concluded, we've been try
ing to do much the same thing as Stanford: that is.
to keep the lev el of gift income up to the lev el ol the
campaign." Edwards said. "This is the lirst year,
and we believe we'll do it."
Currently, Yale's goals, as stated by its presi
dent. are to increase its endowment and to upgrade
its physical plant, particularly the athletic facilities,
[kit. "as yet. there is no order of priority at Yale.
Our objective is cash income." Edwards said.

according to Smith. II present trends continue, the

West Coast institution.
The debate continues irresolutely over which
university is academically superior to which
other uni\ersit\. Collegiate athletic teams vie vig
orously on the field and in the gym to establish
physical predominance. But on one front, the bat
tle is not so pitched, and the results are not so
contestable. Fundraising figures do not lie.
Stanford has been No. 2 in private-institution
fundraising. consistently to Harvard, for quite a
long time, according to Da\ id Fulton, director ol
development communications. In 1977-78. the
most recent year for which statistics are available,
the University amassed a grand total of support of
$54.5 million, compared to Harvard's $63.6 mill
ion and third-place Yale's $45.1 million. In its last
fi\ e-year campaign, ending a year ago. the Univer
sity raised $300 million.
Those numbers, however, as indicative of fun
draising effort as they may be, do not tell the entire
story.
Almost all people judge by the numbers." admit
ted Vice President for Development Joel Smith.
"But success is really much more than that. It's
crucial to meet our goals." he said. The bottom
line figures are important, but the match-up ol
acquired funds and stated goals is overriding, ac
cording to Smith.
Stanford's success in those terms is considered
outstanding by Smith because "we understand our
underlying objectives and the process for meeting
those objectives better than other places. We in
\ est a lot of time into understanding what I call the
institutional agenda," he said. "We really have a
good idea of what we want to accomplish."
That "bottom-up" process begins when the pro
vost and Smith meet with the deans and the direc
tors of major University programs to discover the
needs and aspirations of those academic depart
ments. Then, the provost sorts out those desires
thcmaticallv and sets priorities, while Smith's of
fice investigates the prospects of fundraising for
those needs.
4 «.' I Mie fact that we want something does not
1 mean that we'll automatically get it." Smith
explained.
From those determinations, a fundraising
agenda is constructed, and "we judge our success
by the extent to which we raise the money that
underwrites those objectives," Smith said.
For example, broad categories in the last major
fundraising campaign here were facilities,
academic programs, professorships, fellowships
and libraries. Those headings were further broken
down into what Smith termed "a quite detailed
road map" of objectives.
"It's awfully important to have specific, not just
global goals." he asserted.
The planning work doesn't end with the agenda
outline, though. "It's a continuing job. We have to

keep changing and refining our goals as wc go
