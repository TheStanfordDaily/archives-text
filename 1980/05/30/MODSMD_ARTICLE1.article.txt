# ASSU reports financial deficits, improvements in projects

### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
Two ASSU projects. Special Events and
Typesetting Shop, recorded substantial deficits
on their winter-quarter financial statements,
according to ASSU Financial Manager Bruce
Bendix.
Other projects, most notably Sunday 112 licks
and the Recycling Center, made substantial
improvements in their financial performance
over previous years, he said.
Special Events, plagued by a host of prob
lems including inclement weather, poor timing,
weak promotion and troubles with the Univer
sity. is more than $20.000 in the red this year,
Bendix said at last week's ASSL Senate meet
ing.
Asst. Financial Manager Steve Davis, who
will take over as head ol ASSU finances next
year, said the si/c ol the loss should decrease as
a result ot ev cuts to be held this summer. The
loss should be cut in halt to about SIO.OOO if

these events are successful, he said.
Special Events' gross receipts may exceed
$500,000 by the end of the summer. Bendix
said. A $10,000 loss would represent only 2
percent of that gross, he said.
The Typesetting Shop lost nearly $ 10.000 in
fall and winter quarters, Bendix said. Material
cost increases and an expanded Daily caused
the deficit, he said.
The meteoric rise in the price of silver earlier
this year pushed up the shop's costs for photo
graphic supplies, Bendix said.
The increased Daily size forced the Typeset
ting Shop to increase payroll expenditures, in
cluding a substantial rise in overtime salaries.
The Daily, which accounts for SO percent of the
shop's business, has increased from an average
of eight or nine pages to "I I-plus," said
Typesetting Shop manager Beverly Hendricks.
Bendix said negotiations are underway with
the Daily to recover the extra costs incurred by

the larger papers. He said he was optimistic
that an agreement would be reached that
would eliminate the deficit.
The Sunday Flicks recorded an income of
more than $3500 for winter quarter. The im
plementation of a group discount plan lor resi
dences increased sales and raised revenue sub
stantially, Davis said. The effort was designed
to reinstate the tradition of going to the flicks
on Sunday night and it apparently succeeded,
he said.
The flicks made money last year, although
not as much as they have this year. Bendix said.
Until last year the flicks regularly recorded
losses, he added.
The other bright spot on ASSU's balance
sheets is the Recycling Center. Buoyed by ris
ing prices and increased volume, the center
managed to nearly break even in its operations
through winter quarter, Bendix said. There

were substantial increases in the prices that it
received for mixed paper, computer paper and
cardboard, the center's income statement
showed.
In the past, the center's operating deficits
have been made up with fee assessments, Ben
dix said. This year ASSL' wanted to make it a
break-even project. When a project is funded
by a tee assessment, it is at the "whim" of
elections, which in any year may fail to get the
required 20 percent voter turnout to validate
the assessments. Bendix said.
To reduce costs, the project discontinued
collection of some items such as magazines be
cause there was no profitable market for them.
Davis said.
ASSU Linen Service, T-shirt Service,
Course Guide and Lecture Notes Service all
recorded profits for the period ending winter
quarter

Davis said the ASSU will examine the pro
jects thi> summer, particularly Special Events,
to see it any changes should be made to either
eliminate deficits or improve service.
Bendix said. "It is important to realize that
ASSU is not accepting the losses blindly."
ASSU will gi\e serious consideration to
changes it it is determined that they v\ ill be
beneficial, he said.
It it is determined that Special F.vents cannot
make it on its own under the present structure,
there are options available. Bendix said. The
deficit could be made up by a fee assessment, a
practice common at other schools, he said.
If students were charged a fee assessment,
student discount rates could be established.
Bendix said.
Lecture Notes service may purchase some
new equipment next year to improve the
printed qualit\ of the notes. Davis added.
