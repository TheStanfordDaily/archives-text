# Japanese, West Germans on-again-off-again friends

DUSSELDORF. West Ger
many — Downtown, in this West
German city of executive suite.-,
the Japanese have built an office
center that rises like an architec
tural jigsaw in angles ot glass,
slices of granite and layers of
aluminum.
The structure was designed to
get the Japanese and West Ger
mans under one roof. They ha\ e
not. and their failure to do so has
become symptomatic of other,
larger strains developing be
tween these two great postwar
trading powers.
Put up two years ago to house
both Japanese and West German
firms in equal proportion, the
center was supposed to be a sort
of monument to the friendship
between the world's new
economic miracle cultures. It
was named the German-
Japanese Center.

the offer of residency. Toda\.
only five percent ot the building

tenants.

center." said Hideo Mi/umoto.
president of Marubeni's West
German subsidiary, the trading
company that paid SI 20 million
for the eight-story building.
The rent, about two or three
times the cost of neighboring ot
lice space, turned out to be too
expensive for West German
company budgets. Besides, the
center's frills — it is air
conditioned — and its expansive
design simply didn't appeal to
conservative German corporate
tastes. German corporations
find that they ditler increasingly
with the Japanese in economic
matters, too.
Economic blows near
Although politically they are
still on very friendly terms —
both nations share an avow ed be
lief in laying claim to everyone
else's market — West Germany
and Japan are coming closer to
serious economic blows, as com
petition increases with each
other on their own home turfs.
The Japanese especially have
begun to target West Germany,
and Europe generally, by penet
rating certain markets with a
ferocity that matches their as
sault on the American economy
in the IV7Os.
Japanese products accounted
for 2.7 percent — roughly $4.2
billion — ot West Germany's
total imports last year. But this
relatively small number masks
the fact that Japan's footholds in

West Germany rest in some of
the fastest growing markets.
About two-thirds of all tape
recorders and dictating machines
in West Germany, for example,
are made in Japan. The same is
true of three out of five watches,
four out of live pocket cal
culators, half ol the portable
television sets, most cameras and
nearly all transistor radios.
Restrictions denied
West German automakers, as
well, have looked on with
deepened angst as Japanese
models for the first time took
more than five percent of the
market last year, then acceler
ated past the X percent mark
early this year.
In an unusual appeal in March.
West German electronics man
ufacturers asked the Bonn gov
ernment to impose restrictions
against Japanese imports.
The government rejected the
request. Among the major
European trading nations. West
Germany traditionally has been
the most resistant to calls for
trade barriers against the
Japanese. As one Bonn
economics official said. "We
have historically taken a liberal
trade attitude because we are
ourselves so dependent on
trade." Nevertheless, the pres
sure on Bonn is growing.
Quickening battle
This quickening battle bet
ween America's two chief
economic rivals might give U.S.
observers certain pleasure. Both
nations were, after all. rebuilt
with U.S. assistance after World
War II and since have come back
to challenge American firms in
world markets.
Their economics, distin
guished by relatively low infla
tion and unemployment, are
often singled out as examples of
what to do right — keep money
tight, encourage investment. dis
courage credit, promote friendly
labor-management relations —
against what Americans have
been doing wrong.
While the economic policies of
West Germany and Japan are
similar, however, the way they
do business is often very diffe
rent. What they have most in
common are success and an
overriding confidence in their
own abilities.
Business exasperating
The German-Japanese friend
ship dates back to the last cen
tury. when Japan, opening doors
to the West, took interest in
German philosophy, law.
medicine and art. Their World
AVar II alliance reinforced the

old ties, and this has carried over
to today.
"The Japanese prefer to work
with Germans over Americans.
The traditional friendship is
there." observed Herbert te
Kloot. Dusseldorf s liaison to the
Ja pa nese eo mm un ity.
I'll ere are exasperations on
both sides when doing business,
however.
"In Germany we are clear and
open when we deal: the Japanese
are not very clear," said
Wolfgang Miethke. manager of
Dusseldorf's economic de
velopment office.
Delays also come about as a
result ot the Japanese approach
to management. The Western
approach emphasizes individual
input and iniative. In contrast,
the Japanese stress consensus
building and a sense of participa
tion by all members of the or
ganization.
T his means more Japanese are
likely to get inv olv ed in making a
decision which, in a West Ger
man or American firm, would be
handled by one or two people.

Economic blows near

and Japan are coming closer to
serious economic blows, as com

The Japanese especially have
begun to target West Germany,

ferocity that matches their as

Japanese products accounted
for 2.7 percent — roughly $4.2

total imports last year. But this
relatively small number masks
the fact that Japan's footholds in

West Germany rest in some of
the fastest growing markets.
About two-thirds of all tape
