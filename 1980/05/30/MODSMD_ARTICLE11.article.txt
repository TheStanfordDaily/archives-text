# Cubans undergo internal reform
## 
### Marlise Simons Special to The Washington Post 
HAVANA — The daily drama of massive
exodus from this communist island state has
obscured a series of radical internal reforms
that mark one of the most fundamental trans
formations in the 21-year history of the
Cuban revolution.
Both the exodus and the reforms stem in
large part from the same root — a deep
economic slump that has brought long
unfulfilled mass expectations into the open,
along with government acknowledgement
that the Cuban economic model contained
some near-disastrous miscalculations.
Even before the refugee crisis, the gov
ernment had introduced the first in a series of
structural changes, aimed at reducing the
state's omnipresence in daily life and creat
ing more room for private enterprise and
personal initiative. Western Cuba-watchers
have described the changes as "important
ideological concessions."
Although still visible only on a small scale,
the changes pose a stark contrast to Cuba's
past economic policies; Nearly alone among
Soviet-allied states, Cuba had obliterated all
vestiges of private commerce. While some
small farmers were permitted to keep their
property, all produce had to be sold and dis
tributed by the state. Every worker, from
auto-repairmen to physicians, was employed
by the government, and every Cuban was
guaranteed a job, even if make-believe work
had to be invented to occupy him.
The result. Cuban officials now admit,
added up to inefficient production and dis
tribution. lack of initiative, high absenteeism

and nationwide frustration.
On a human level, continued shortages of
housing, consumer goods and spare parts,
poorly made clothes and long lines for every
thing from vegetables to bus rides have taken
their cumulative toll. Although Cubans have
better balanced diets than most Latin
Americans, many are tired of the lack of
variety and constant lines to purchase goods.
For the government, internal problems
were only exacerbated by international trade
and financial difficulties. Extensive trade and
barter with the Soviet bloc, the ongoing U.S.
trade embargo and near-total dependence
upon the vagaries of the international market
for sugar, which provides 80 percent of Cu
ba's earnings, have made for ongoing foreign
exchange shortages. This year, sugar and to
bacco blights destroying large portions of the
export crops dealt a near-killing blow to the
economy.
The new rules imposed by the government
include the sale of farm products in free mar
kets and the issuance of licenses for
craftsmen and entrepreneurs to go into busi
ness for themselves. State companies have
been told their priority is to make profits
rather than simply producing goods or pro
viding jobs. The managers' new freedom to
hire and fire personnel ends the official myth
that there can be no unemployment in Cuba.
"It's like awakening the spirit of competi
tion again," said one European observer.
"The absence of this, we've seen, has led to
high costs, low productivity and boredom in
the welfare states of socialism and capitalism
alike."
On the zigzag course of the Cuban revolu

tion, the new measures signify closing of the
"idealist period," when Cuba's leaders be
lieved that a socialist conscience would be
enough motivation for people to work.
Now, like the Soviet Union and China be
fore it, Cuba is unabashedly re-establishing
the relationship between efforts and rewards
as a way to stir the sluggish economy.
The first changes are already visible. Last
week in Havana and several provincial
towns, the first free farmers' markets
opened. By all accounts people pounced on
them. They sold out within a few hours. They
are modeled after the Soviet markets where
peasants can sell "surplus" after complying
with the quota they must sell to the state. For
the first time in years outside the black mar
ket, prices were set by bargaining and not by
the government.
After years of quiet moonlighting, often
charging in goods rather than cash, carpen
ters, electricians and other repairmen have
now started to work for themselves legally.
They bu,y'a license, equivalent to paying a
tax, and take on private jobs. If they want to
expand their business, however, they may
not hire any staff, but can associate with
other equals.
Either an increase of Soviet aid or new
sources of convertible cash are regarded as
indispensable for buying basic supplies and
making up for the most pressing shortages to
avoid further demoralization of the popula
tion. It is clear to the leadership that both
critics and supporters of the government are
feeling they have had to tighten their belt for
too long.

HAVANA — The daily drama of massive
exodus from this communist island state has
obscured a series of radical internal reforms
that mark one of the most fundamental trans
formations in the 21-year history of the
Cuban revolution.
Both the exodus and the reforms stem in
large part from the same root — a deep
economic slump that has brought long
unfulfilled mass expectations into the open,
along with government acknowledgement
that the Cuban economic model contained
some near-disastrous miscalculations.
Even before the refugee crisis, the gov
ernment had introduced the first in a series of
structural changes, aimed at reducing the
state's omnipresence in daily life and creat
ing more room for private enterprise and
personal initiative. Western Cuba-watchers
have described the changes as "important
ideological concessions."
Although still visible only on a small scale,
the changes pose a stark contrast to Cuba's
past economic policies; Nearly alone among
Soviet-allied states, Cuba had obliterated all
vestiges of private commerce. While some
small farmers were permitted to keep their
property, all produce had to be sold and dis
tributed by the state. Every worker, from
auto-repairmen to physicians, was employed
by the government, and every Cuban was
guaranteed a job, even if make-believe work
had to be invented to occupy him.
The result. Cuban officials now admit,
added up to inefficient production and dis
tribution. lack of initiative, high absenteeism

and nationwide frustration.
On a human level, continued shortages of
housing, consumer goods and spare parts,
poorly made clothes and long lines for every
thing from vegetables to bus rides have taken
their cumulative toll. Although Cubans have
better balanced diets than most Latin
Americans, many are tired of the lack of
variety and constant lines to purchase goods.
