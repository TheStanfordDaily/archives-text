# Rare white elephant doesn't excite king
## 
### Keyes Beech The Los Angeles Times 
BANGKOK, Thailand —
White elephants arc a symbol of
good fortune in Thailand, and by
law they automatically become
the property of the king.
So the discovery last week of a
year-old white elephant was ex
pected to be an occasion for re
joicing in the royal household.
However, the news was received

with some restraint.
King Bhumibol Adulyadej
apparently is up to here in white
elephants — so much so that they
threaten to become "White
Elephants."
The king already has an even
do/en white elephants, and more
is not necessarily better in these
days of thundering inflation.
Although described as a per
fect specimen, the newly disco
vered white elephant is certain to
undergo rigorous scrutiny before
being accepted.
There are, it seems, three
grades of white elephants: the
pre-eminent, or No. I. white
elephant, the "unique" and the
merely rare. The newly found
white elephant is said to possess
the seven physical characteristics
that put him in the top class.
These are white eyes, white pa
late, white nails, white hair,
white skin, white tail hair and
white testicles.
Elephants have a long and
honorable history in Thailand.
Warrior elephants, the tanks of
their day. once saved the Thai
kingdom from invading Bur
mese.
But white elephants have
never been trained as fighters.
Instead, because of their rarity,
they are considered august
omens of peace and prosperity.
Actually, of course, they are al
binos.
Sexual vigor is also vital, re
gardless of whether the elephant
is male or female.
The sexual vigor of one of the
king's elephants — a 25-year-old
male in his prime — is currently a
problem because all the female
white elephants are too young
for mating, according to Sawej.
It is strictly forbidden for a white
elephant to mate with a non
white.
"This leaves him sexually frus
trated, and as a result he is very
cross," Sanej said sympatheti
cally.
