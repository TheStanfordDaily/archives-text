# BUG ME
## 
### 
As this is almost my last column, I am going
to break my perfect record. Until today I have
never made up a question for Bug Me (true fact,
though even my best friends have accused me of
making up the inquiries which have appeared in
this weekly fount of information), but here goes:
My Question to Me . . .Dear Wonderful Columnist,
When I weht to pick up my graduation tickets
Tuesday, I learned that it would cost $10 to rent a
cap and gown for the ceremony, and that for only
$1.50 more I could keep said articles. What's going
on here?

The Stanford Bookstore, which works for the
Office of Public Events on this, acts as an agent of
the University and rents out the caps and gowns as
a service to the students, according to Bookstore
assistant manager Philip Chiaramonte.
Chiaramonte said that the Bookstore doesn't
make much money through the rentals, even
though they were able to secure a very good price
from the rental company this year.
He also said that the Bookstore investigated the
possibility of purchasing the caps and gowns to
eliminate the need to rent them each year. The
problem with this idea is that while private com
panies are set up to stock, store and clean the
garments, neither the Bookstore nor the Univer
sity is. Chiaramonte said that costs to students for
the caps and gowns would be higher if the
Bookstore simply purchased them.
As far as the price difference between rental and
purchase this year, Chiaramonte stresses that the
retainable gown is made of a very different mate
rial than the sturdy cotton and polyester rental
gown. These purchasable gowns are made of a thin
acetate material and are meant to be souvenirs of
commencement, and not reusable.
If the prices still seem too high to you, remember
that caps and gowns are not required apparel for
the ceremony, although the vast majority ot
graduating students do rent them.
Now on to questions from my loyal readers:
Dear Bug Me,
1. What happened to the big, beautiful ride board
that used to be on the ground floor of Tresidder
Union? It served its purpose much better than the
woefully inadequate system that is now there.
2. What is the cottage next to Angell Field used
for? Does anybody live there?
Thank you,
J.L.
1. Portia Holmes, Information Center coor
dinator for Tresidder, assures me that the ride
board is still there on the wall in the downstairs
lobby, near The Axe's display case. The ride board,
maintained by Alpha Phi Omega, a service organi
zation, has been there for all but one of the last 14

years, according to Holmes.
Perhaps the source of contusion here is the
ASSU ride board on the second floor of Tresidder.
which Holmes said was initiated in the year that
A-Phi-O was amiss and has been a sort of duplica
tion of services ever since.
2. Yes, somebody lives there. The cottage has
been rented out to married athletes since the very
early 19505. It is rented through the Athletic De
partment on the basis of a waiting list, according to
Associate Director of Athletics Bob Young.
Before the early '50s, it was the home of the
legendary Sam McDonald, originally a stable boy
for Leland Stanford, and later superintendant of
grounds for the Athletic Department. And before
that, I don't remember.
Dear Bug Me,
Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it seems funny to
me that as the arrival of impressionable parents and
Healthy alumni for graduation ceremonies in June
gets closer, suddenly hundreds of dollars of red and
white petunias were planted in the usually stark
Quad, and in various planters around campus. Is
this just a coincidence of the planting season, or an
attempt to give parents a false impression of how
beautiful the campus always is? In three years here, /
never recall an expensive "petunia project" before.
The Plant Lover writes again
"I'd say it's not all just to impress the parents,
but part of it is," said Herbert Fong, superinten
dant of labor and grounds. It is a coincidence of the
planting season in that it is time to plant summer
annuals, which in this case happen to be the
petunias.
But it is also being done in preparation for com
mencement, Fong said, along with thousands of
dollars of repairs and clean-up going on elsewhere
around campus. Frost Amphitheater in particular.
Dear Bug Me,
I was in Memorial Auditorium's men's bathroom
recently, and I noticed the partitions between the
urinals had been broken off. Was this done to fores
tall homosexual activity, the same way they removed
the doors from stalls in the Cummings Art Budding?
Puzzled and Hetero
No. The"modesty partitions," as they are called,
were broken off some years ago, according to
Bruce Wiggins, manager of operations. The parti
tions were the original heavy slabs of marble, which
are just too expensive to replace, Wiggins said.
As you can see. I've already gone on way too
long. I'm also sorry to announce that no more
questions will be accepted for publication this vol
ume. No, I'm not being despotic, it's just that
there's only one more column to go. It will run in
next week's issue, but by the time you read this it
will have already been written.

My Question to Me . . .Dear Wonderful Columnist,
When I weht to pick up my graduation tickets
Tuesday, I learned that it would cost $10 to rent a
cap and gown for the ceremony, and that for only
$1.50 more I could keep said articles. What's going
on here?

The Stanford Bookstore, which works for the
Office of Public Events on this, acts as an agent of
the University and rents out the caps and gowns as
a service to the students, according to Bookstore
assistant manager Philip Chiaramonte.
Chiaramonte said that the Bookstore doesn't
make much money through the rentals, even
though they were able to secure a very good price
from the rental company this year.
He also said that the Bookstore investigated the
possibility of purchasing the caps and gowns to
eliminate the need to rent them each year. The
problem with this idea is that while private com
panies are set up to stock, store and clean the
garments, neither the Bookstore nor the Univer
sity is. Chiaramonte said that costs to students for
the caps and gowns would be higher if the
Bookstore simply purchased them.
As far as the price difference between rental and
purchase this year, Chiaramonte stresses that the
retainable gown is made of a very different mate
rial than the sturdy cotton and polyester rental
gown. These purchasable gowns are made of a thin
acetate material and are meant to be souvenirs of
commencement, and not reusable.
If the prices still seem too high to you, remember
that caps and gowns are not required apparel for
the ceremony, although the vast majority ot
graduating students do rent them.
Now on to questions from my loyal readers:
Dear Bug Me,
1. What happened to the big, beautiful ride board
that used to be on the ground floor of Tresidder
Union? It served its purpose much better than the
woefully inadequate system that is now there.
2. What is the cottage next to Angell Field used
for? Does anybody live there?
Thank you,
J.L.
1. Portia Holmes, Information Center coor
dinator for Tresidder, assures me that the ride
board is still there on the wall in the downstairs
lobby, near The Axe's display case. The ride board,
maintained by Alpha Phi Omega, a service organi
zation, has been there for all but one of the last 14

years, according to Holmes.
Perhaps the source of contusion here is the
ASSU ride board on the second floor of Tresidder.
which Holmes said was initiated in the year that
A-Phi-O was amiss and has been a sort of duplica
tion of services ever since.
2. Yes, somebody lives there. The cottage has
been rented out to married athletes since the very
early 19505. It is rented through the Athletic De
partment on the basis of a waiting list, according to
Associate Director of Athletics Bob Young.
Before the early '50s, it was the home of the
legendary Sam McDonald, originally a stable boy
for Leland Stanford, and later superintendant of
grounds for the Athletic Department. And before
that, I don't remember.
Dear Bug Me,
Maybe it's just a coincidence, but it seems funny to
me that as the arrival of impressionable parents and
Healthy alumni for graduation ceremonies in June
gets closer, suddenly hundreds of dollars of red and
white petunias were planted in the usually stark
Quad, and in various planters around campus. Is
this just a coincidence of the planting season, or an
attempt to give parents a false impression of how
beautiful the campus always is? In three years here, /
never recall an expensive "petunia project" before.
The Plant Lover writes again
"I'd say it's not all just to impress the parents,
but part of it is," said Herbert Fong, superinten
dant of labor and grounds. It is a coincidence of the
planting season in that it is time to plant summer
annuals, which in this case happen to be the
petunias.
But it is also being done in preparation for com
mencement, Fong said, along with thousands of
dollars of repairs and clean-up going on elsewhere
around campus. Frost Amphitheater in particular.
Dear Bug Me,
I was in Memorial Auditorium's men's bathroom
recently, and I noticed the partitions between the
urinals had been broken off. Was this done to fores
tall homosexual activity, the same way they removed
the doors from stalls in the Cummings Art Budding?
Puzzled and Hetero
No. The"modesty partitions," as they are called,
were broken off some years ago, according to
Bruce Wiggins, manager of operations. The parti
tions were the original heavy slabs of marble, which
are just too expensive to replace, Wiggins said.
As you can see. I've already gone on way too
long. I'm also sorry to announce that no more
questions will be accepted for publication this vol
ume. No, I'm not being despotic, it's just that
there's only one more column to go. It will run in
next week's issue, but by the time you read this it
will have already been written.

As this is almost my last column, I am going
to break my perfect record. Until today I have
