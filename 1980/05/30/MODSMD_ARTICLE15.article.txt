SACRAMENTO â€” State
findings of a high rate pf skin
cancer at Lawrence Livermore
nuclear laboratory have been
confirmed by a national group of
scientists, the Legislature's audit
committee said yesterday.
However, the report also said
it could draw no conclusions
about the cause of the high
cancer rate at the laboratory.
The state Health Serv ices De
partment said April 17 that it
had found 19 melanoma cases
among laboratory workers bet
ween 1972 and 1977.
That rate among the laborat
ory's 4700 to 5700 employees
was three to five times the rate of
the serious skin cancer in
neighboring areas of Alameda
and Contra Costa counties, the
department said.
The department said more
study was needed to find the
cause. The laboratory, which
paid for part of the state study
costs, formed a scientist task
group to icview the state report.
The Joint Legislative Audit
Committee also asked 10 scien
tific and medical experts to re
view the state report. The com
mittee said yesterday the experts
confirmed the findings.
The committee cautioned
against drawing any conclusions
about causes.
"Sufficient investigation has
not yet been undertaken to as
sess whether there is any rela
tionship between the reported

melanoma cases and exposure to
radiation, accidents, chemical
exposures, or any other indust
rial hygiene factors." the com
mittee report said.
It said there haven't heen any
scientific findings in the past that
connect melanoma to nuclear
radiation. Malignant melanoma

had been connected only with ul
traviolet radiation.
Until more research is done,
"it is not possible to determine
what, if any, additional or diffe
rent health and safety precautio
nary measures might be war
ranted at the laboratory." the
committee said.
