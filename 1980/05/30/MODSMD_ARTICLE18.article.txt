This is the penultimate column
in my illustrious career as a Daily
health correspondent. That just
means that I'll save the sappy
sentiment for next time in the
Dead Week issue.
This is a question that I've
pondered for some time, and I'm
glad someone else possessed the
inquisitive forethought and men
tal perspicacity to ask it.
How many pregnancies are re
ported on campus annually?
What is official University policy
regarding pregnant students'.' Is
housing provided for single pa
rents?
-Fruitfully Fecund
Dr. John Dorman at Cowell
has studied the pattern of pre
gnancies among Stanford stu
dents for the past se\eral years.
From autumn, 1978, to autumn,
1979, the most recent figures
compiled reveal 177 total pre
gnancies reported to Cowell. Of
those. 40 were planned, 130 un
planned and seven unidentified.
Among the women who had
planned their pregnancies, all
were married except two (one
was engaged, and the other was a
single graduate student).
In the unplanned category, 3 I
of the gravid females were mar
ried. and 99 were impregnated
out of wedlock. Of those 99. <S 1
were planning on having abor

tions, two had decided to keep
their offspring and the rest were
undecided. From the 31 wives
who were surprised by positive
pregnancy tests, 13 planned the
abortion route. 10 desired to re
tain their fetuses and the re
mainder were uncertain.
The total number of reported
pregnancies here has risen a lot
in the past few years, according
to Dorman. In 1975, only 95
pregnancies were recorded by
Cowell. That disparity might be
credited to an increase in the
number of women going to Cow
ell. as well as in the actual fre
quency of pregnancy.
To give you an idea of the
number of women with cause to
suspect pregnancy, Cheryl Cal
loway, a Cowell laboratory
worker, disclosed that about 50
pregnancy tests are administered
per month there.
Covering your second inquiry,
Leah Kaplan of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS)
said that University has no policy
concerning pregnant students.
The administration considers
pregnancy to be a pri\ate matter
and not within its realm to regu
late. she said. Pregnancy tests
and pre-natal counseling are,
however, provided free of charge
to students at Cowell and Huston
House.

Charlotte Siege!, a psychiatric
social worker at CAPS, said that
counselors there have spoken to
about 70 pregnant women on
their partners annually tor the
past five years.
On your last count. Roger
Whitney, assistant dean of resi
dential education, said that Es
condido Village housing is avail
able for single students. It, tor
example, a single woman li\ing
in single student housing were to
give birth to a child in the middle
of the school year, she would be
responsible lor informing the
housing office ot her status
change. She would then be eligi
ble lor single parent housing.
Here's another picayune type
of statistical question. 1 extent
my thanks to K/SU's master
football statistician. John Ma
son. for helping me out on this
one.
How much does the University
spend annually for football in
juries?
-the USC defensive line
Dear Semi-pros.
Actually, the University
doesn't spend anything on foot
hnll injuries. It doesn't even buy
its very own semi-authentic

junior college transcripts. It
does, however, spend a pretty
penny — although not as pretty
as you might guess — on having
our athletic heroes mended.
No breakdown is available for
dollars spent on each sport, but
the grand total spent to heal
minor injuries to the athletes this
year was over $40,000, paid to
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, ac
cording to Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Jim Gaughran. For major in
juries requiring surgery, of which
there were seven last year, the
University doled out HOO big
ones to the Medical Center.
Doug Single, associate direc
tor for development in the Ath
letic Department, said that the
department's annual training
budget is a semi-whopping
$257,000. That sum, he
explained, includes trainers'
salaries, insurance and the
aforementioned medical bills —
in other words, "the whole ball
of wax."
Looks like that about covers
the whole semi-pot. Don't
bother to write (not that you
have the rest of the year)because
you'll be too late.

Dear Semi-pros.
Actually, the University
doesn't spend anything on foot
hnll injuries. It doesn't even buy
its very own semi-authentic

junior college transcripts. It
does, however, spend a pretty
penny — although not as pretty
as you might guess — on having
our athletic heroes mended.
No breakdown is available for
dollars spent on each sport, but
the grand total spent to heal
minor injuries to the athletes this
year was over $40,000, paid to
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, ac
cording to Asst. Athletic Direc
tor Jim Gaughran. For major in
juries requiring surgery, of which
there were seven last year, the
University doled out HOO big
ones to the Medical Center.
Doug Single, associate direc
tor for development in the Ath
letic Department, said that the
department's annual training
budget is a semi-whopping
$257,000. That sum, he
explained, includes trainers'
salaries, insurance and the
aforementioned medical bills —
in other words, "the whole ball
of wax."
Looks like that about covers
the whole semi-pot. Don't
bother to write (not that you
have the rest of the year)because
you'll be too late.

This is the penultimate column
in my illustrious career as a Daily
health correspondent. That just
means that I'll save the sappy
sentiment for next time in the
Dead Week issue.
This is a question that I've
pondered for some time, and I'm
glad someone else possessed the
inquisitive forethought and men
tal perspicacity to ask it.
How many pregnancies are re
ported on campus annually?
What is official University policy
regarding pregnant students'.' Is
housing provided for single pa
rents?
-Fruitfully Fecund
Dr. John Dorman at Cowell
has studied the pattern of pre
gnancies among Stanford stu
dents for the past se\eral years.
From autumn, 1978, to autumn,
1979, the most recent figures
compiled reveal 177 total pre
gnancies reported to Cowell. Of
those. 40 were planned, 130 un
planned and seven unidentified.
Among the women who had
planned their pregnancies, all
were married except two (one
was engaged, and the other was a
single graduate student).
In the unplanned category, 3 I
of the gravid females were mar
ried. and 99 were impregnated
out of wedlock. Of those 99. <S 1
were planning on having abor

tions, two had decided to keep
their offspring and the rest were
undecided. From the 31 wives
who were surprised by positive
pregnancy tests, 13 planned the
abortion route. 10 desired to re
tain their fetuses and the re
mainder were uncertain.
The total number of reported
pregnancies here has risen a lot
in the past few years, according
to Dorman. In 1975, only 95
pregnancies were recorded by
Cowell. That disparity might be
credited to an increase in the
number of women going to Cow
ell. as well as in the actual fre
quency of pregnancy.
To give you an idea of the
number of women with cause to
suspect pregnancy, Cheryl Cal
loway, a Cowell laboratory
worker, disclosed that about 50
pregnancy tests are administered
per month there.
Covering your second inquiry,
Leah Kaplan of Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS)
said that University has no policy
concerning pregnant students.
The administration considers
pregnancy to be a pri\ate matter
and not within its realm to regu
late. she said. Pregnancy tests
and pre-natal counseling are,
however, provided free of charge
to students at Cowell and Huston
House.

Charlotte Siege!, a psychiatric
social worker at CAPS, said that
counselors there have spoken to
about 70 pregnant women on
their partners annually tor the
past five years.
On your last count. Roger
Whitney, assistant dean of resi
dential education, said that Es
condido Village housing is avail
able for single students. It, tor
example, a single woman li\ing
in single student housing were to
give birth to a child in the middle
of the school year, she would be
responsible lor informing the
housing office ot her status
change. She would then be eligi
ble lor single parent housing.
Here's another picayune type
of statistical question. 1 extent
my thanks to K/SU's master
football statistician. John Ma
son. for helping me out on this
one.
How much does the University
spend annually for football in
juries?
