## Editorials Carter with reservations 
### 
Now that the result of California's Republi
can presidential primary contest is moot, the
only active race still facing voters is in the
Democratic Party, in which President Jimmy
Carter and Sen. Edward Kennedy are wing for
support on June 3.
We support Carter in this contest, more be
cause of our reservations about Kennedy than
for any enthusiastic feelings for Carter and his
record over the last three and one-halt vears.
Kennedy has tailed to produce any sound
solutions tor today's economic problems, nor
has he done anything to prove he has changed
his thinking away from that of the "60s
philosophy ot hiu spending by an ever-growing
government. Such an economic philosophy will
do nothing to help this nation's economic trou
bles.
Finally. Kennedy's inability to wage an effec
tive campaign against a candidate as uninspiring
as Carter lead us to believe that he would inspire
little confidence himselt in the White House.

We do not unhesitatingly endorse Carter,
however. During his presidency int'lation has
soared, unemployment has risen and U.S.
foreign policy lias battled other nations as well
as our own citizens.
We do support his mo\es toward a balanced
budget, as well as his tough-handed attitude
concerning this nation's energy policy. His
handling of the Panama Canal Treaty and his
support ot SALT II have also been encouraging.
But most disappointing has been his seeming
lack lit initiate e as this nation's chief executive.
There has been little evidence of clear leader
ship from Washington and the priority of issues
has changed from month to month.
It is this kind of leadership that leaves us with
great reservations about Carter's performance
and potential tor future improvement. How
ever. the many questions we have about Ken
nedy lead us to support a known, albeit weak,
Carter candidacy over that of an unknown, and
potentially less distinguished one of Kennedy.
