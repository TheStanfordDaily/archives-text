# House wants defense, but kills budget
## 
### William baton The Los Angeles Times 
WASIIINOTON In ;i muted \ ic
tory tor President Jimmy Carter, the
House yesterday decisively rejected a
balanced budget resolution that the
president had attacked as pro\ iding too
much tor defense and not enough for
social programs, then turned around
and voted to support the high military
spending level by voice.
The House issued the mixed signals
in a long and confusing ev cning session
that saw the budget defeated. 242-141.
but its controversial $153.7 billion de
fense figure endorsed.
Support for the military spending -
the largest peacetime defense increase
in U.S. history —came on a Republi
can motion to instruct House
negotiators to to the House-Senate
Conference ( ommittee to insist on that
figure.
It denied Carter and I louse Speaker
Thomas O'Neill Jr. a elearcut victoiy in
the defeat of the budget package that
they opposed because of ifs proposed
cuts in domestic spending to pay lor
higher defense.
Although instructions to conferees
are not binding, they should strengthen
the hand of Senate negotiators who
have already said an attempt to force a
lower defense figure could lead to an
impasse between the two bodies.
Instructions
The House agreed to the instruc
tions, proposed by Rep. Delbert l.atta
(R-Ohio). after defeating a motion to
table — or kill — the wording on a
165-123 vote.
After rejection of the budget. Sen.
Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.), Senate
Budget Committee chairman, said the
"principal blame for defeat of the con
ference report must be laid at the feet
of the president."
Hollings. a leading advocate of
higher defense spending, added that
the House vote means that "if we have
a budget resolution at all. it is
likely to shortchange our critical de
fense needs."
Reaction
Rep. Robert (iiaimo (D-Conn.),
House Budget Committee chairman,
also voiced concern over the defeat of
the compromise.
"If the liberals are upset with the
budget for one reason and the conser
vatives for another, then God help the
American people." Giaimo declared.
Many lawmakers, however, said they
were concerned that the budget did not
contain enough funds for social prog
rams that would be needed as the
economy tumbles into recession this
year.
The House vote on the budget sharply
divided the Democratic leadership,
with O'Neill and Carter at odds with
virtually every other top House Demo
crat, including Majority Leader Jim
Wright (D-Texas) and Giaimo.
