# Ax devastating tax cut
## 
### 
Proposition 9. or Jan is 11. is another stop in
the march against taxes led In Howard Jar\is
and Paul Gann. Combined with the effects of
the pre\ lously approved I 978 Prop. 13 and last
year's Prop. 4 (the Gann Initiative), this step
could jar California away from its tenuous
foothold on economic security.
This proposed constitutional amendment
would limit state personal income tax rates to ."*0
percent of those in effect during 1 1 >7N.
Authorities project that the passage of Prop
9 would cost the state $4.9 billion in fiscal year
1980-81. $4.2 billion in 1981-82 and unknown
but increasing amounts in following years. Pro
ceeds from income tax collections accrue to the
state's General Fund to finance 86 percent of all
state expenditures. Estimates indicate that the
proposed tax cut would deplete General fund
levels planned for 1980-81 by 25 percent.
Hardest hit of go\ ernment sen ices supported
by the General Fund would be public education,
which has received about 50 percent of General
Fund income in the past.
One of the most direct effects on Stanford
would be slashes in appropriations under the
California state scholarship program. More
than 1000 undergraduates here are recipients of

about $2 million in aid under this program, and
the University projects their awards will be cut
by 30 percent if Prop. 9 passes.
No bail-out would be possible to mitigate
Prop. 9 cut-backs because the state surplus is far
less than it was before Prop. 13 passed. Califor
nia's acclaimed public education system would
suiter immeasurably. As much as $900 million
in federal matching funds to state schools would
also be jeopardized.
Finally. Prop. 9 would impose redistributive
effects upon the economy — but in the opposite
direction of that normally presumed. Because
of the graduated nature of the income tax struc
ture and the fact that Prop. 9 does not apply to
any tax credits, deductions or exemptions, ex
perts predict that 55 percent of the tax savings
would accrue to the highest paid the top 4 per
cent of the taxpayers. Meanwhile, the 93 per
cent of the state's senior citizens who pay no
state income tax would be severely hurt by a loss
of free sen ices and would gain nothing.
As we have learned from Prop. 13 and its
progeny, simply cutting taxes does not make
government more efficient or brake inflation. It
denies citizens basic social sen ices and benefits
the people who need tax breaks least.
