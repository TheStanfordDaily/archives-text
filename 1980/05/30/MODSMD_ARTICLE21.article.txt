# Prop. 10 ads fraudulent
## 
### 
California voters have recently been bom
barded by one of the most fraudulent political
advertising campaigns in memory. Proposition
10 has been portrayed as the friend of the re
nter. It is not anything of the sort, however, and
never was intended to be.
Prop. 10 contains several major points, none
of which will probably e\er benefit a California
renter! but most of which would allow landlords
and real estate speculators to reap huge gains.
Specifically, the initiative prohibits any
statewide rent control from being enacted and
prohibits any local legislative authorities from
enacting rent control measures. It passed, the
initiative would only allow for rent control mea
sures to he passed by a vote of the people of a
local jurisdiction — and then only within the
standards imposed by the initiative. The initia
tive strips local authorities from enacting crea
tive rent control measures which address the
particular concerns of a community.
If Prop. 10 passes, all rent control measures
now in force will be invalidated at the next

election following this one.
Finally, the standards for rent control ordi-.
nances passed under Prop. I<> include that an
nual rent increases shall be permitted up to t-he
"average increase in the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) lor the preceeding 1 2 calendar months.'"«
And relevant to many students here is the
provision that allows landlords to raise the rent
on vacated units, even when rent control ordi
nances are in effect. This leaves students who
frequentlv move and sublease or substitute ten
ants especially vulnerable to faster rent in
creases.
The allowance of rent increases up to the
increase in the CPI is an extremely inflationary
pro\ ision. The costs of maintaining rental prop
erty go up much slower than consumer costs.
While the Daily has never been a fan of rent
control, we feel that this initiative, with its
elimination of local legislative control overrent
control and allowance for excessive rent in
creases makes it unworthy of support.
