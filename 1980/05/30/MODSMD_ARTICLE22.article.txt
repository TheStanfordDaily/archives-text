# Proposition 11 unsound
## 
### 
The vision of taxing Big Oil profits to fund
mass transit and alternative fuels development
is one that causes environmental groups and
pro-solar people to salivate as they contemplate
the irony of oil companies funding their own
competition.
Proposition 11. the state referendum that
would slap a 10 percent surtax on all California
firms that rcceiv e more than half of their income
from oil. gas or uranium development, prov ides
just such a vision. The tax money, collected
from firms with annual incomes of over $5 mill
ion, would be "reinvested" by the state in alter
native fuels development and used to upgrade
mass-transit in California's congested urban
areas.
The proposal has some sound tenets. It pro
vides for an investment tax credit ol 50 cents on
every dollar the energy firms invest in the explo
ration forenergy sources within California. And
while the basic concept of reallocating excess
profits from oil firms to the people who must
pay the high prices of oil and gas is at first glance
laudable, the Daily believes that the economic

detriment that the measure would engender far
outweighs any merits of the proposition.
Proposition 1 I is economically unsound*, for
while its chief aim is to tax away big oil profits,
its effect will be to also tax non-oil-related in
comes of the big firms and smaller firms as well.
An oil company, under the proposed law. would
pay 10 percent on income received from
wineries and even solar development sub
sidiaries.
The measure will encourage energy produc
ing firms to move to states where the tax climate
is more favorable. In addition, it could actually
cause decreased investment in energy fields as
corporations shift investments from oil and
natural gas to non-energy fields.
Finally. Proposition 1 1 does nothing to effect
the real cause of high oil prices both at home
and abroad. The twin demons of high demand
and OPEC control of oil prices will not be
changed by the measure. We cannot believe
that people will suddenly turn to mass transit if
it becomes more available without the incentive
of further increases in the price of gasoline.
