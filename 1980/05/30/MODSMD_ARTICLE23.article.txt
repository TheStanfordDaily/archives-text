# Cut oil profits, back buses
## 
### 
Windfall oil profits hardly began with the re
cently instituted phased deregulation of that in
dustry. Since OPECs massive price hike in
1973 brought the energy crisis squarely bet
ween the eyes of the American people. Big Oil
has been routinely announcing the likes of Ex
xon's first quarter $2 billion profit this year.
The time has come to channel those profits
away from the large corporations and put the
money that has come from the consumer's poc
kets to work for the consumers again. Proposi
tion I 1 does this by taxing the corporations
whose main business is oil and using those funds
to improve mass transit.
Projects that the $200 million raised could
fund — according to Gov. Jerry Brown and San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein, two propo
nents of the measure — include transit connect
ing San Francisco and the South Bay area, im
provements for the San Francisco Muni and
several proposed transit systems for Southern

California.
Oil companies' desperate campaign against
Prop. 11 seems prompted by their need to keep
mass transit systems underdeveloped. By deny
ing the public a reliable alternative. Big Oil
promotes continued demand tor its product.
Voters finally have the opportunity to express
their rage at oil company profiteering on the
world's misfortune. Reasonable profits are the
centerpiece of the free enterprise system; greed
is not.
Quite understandably, the pro-Big Oil anti-
Proposition 1 I campaign has the enormous war
chest that enables it to mount a slick advertising
campaign against the measure. We hope the
voters will not be taken in by the empty
sloganeering and misleading arguments about
"the hands of the bureaucrats" and other buzz
words that the supporters of Big Oil trot out to
maintain their profits and special privileges.
