# Bill embodies anti-business craze
## 
### 
There is a feeling in America today that
corporations are bad. that anyone involved
in business is a potential criminal and that to
make a profit is a sin. What's more, that
feeling is spreading.
I hear people describe profits as
"obscene" so often that I'm beginning to
expect the PTA to ban discussion of them
from our nation's schools. Last month, the
United States celebrated its first Big Busi
ness Day — an organized condemnation of
American corporations. Frankly. 1 think this
anti-business craze has gone too far.
It's one thing for Ralph Nader and Barry
Commoner to aim their solar-powered
rhetoric at corporate America. We have
come to expect such tantrums from them.
But it's another thing altogether when our
elected officials begin turning this hatred of
anything incorporated into legislation. Speci
fically. 1 am referring to Congressional Bill
H.R. 7010. the Corporate Democracy Act.
This bill, currently pending action in the
U.S. House of Representatives, embodies all
the worst elements of the anti-corporate fad.
It treats modern corporate structure and con
temporary corporate leadership as if there
were something intrinsically immoral about
them. And it singles corporations out for fai
lures that are in no way corporate in nature.
In addition, the bill seems totally oblivious
to the fact that corporations exist for the sake
ai producing. The act treats corporations as if
their sole raison d'etre is the provision of
jobs. By examining the faulty logic of the
three major segments of the bill, it will be
come clear that the Corporate Democracy
Act is precisely the sort of law we don't want
on the books.
Independent directors
The bill stipulates that the majority of the
board of any corporation subject to the act
shall consist of "independent" directors.
These would be persons not recently
employed by the firm in any managerial, fi
nancial or legal capacity. The reasoning be
hind this proposal is faulty in both a legal and
economic sense.
First, the act abridges the right to due pro
cess of law for present and future regular
board members. It undermines their voice in
the corporation by placing them in the
board's minority. This mandate clearly pre
supposes that any director with a working

relationship to the firm will exploit that rela
tionship for his own personal benefit. But the
implicit assumption that the non
independent director is a priori guilty of
some wrongdoing is utterly incompatible
with our legal philosophy, which assumes a
priori innocence.
Second, the idea of placing independent
directors in the dominant position on corpo
rate boards makes no economic sense what'
soever. To the extent that these independent
directors would not vote like the ni(jre
experienced, better-informed regular direc
tors. corporate boards would cease to make
valuable contributions to their firms. In the

short run.the boards would be responsible
for inferior decision making. And in the long
run.the boards-themselves would probably
lose their credibility and become powerless
organs to which no corporate manager would
feel obliged to listen.
Corporate disclosure
The second major portion of the bill stipu
lates that any corporation subject to the act
must make extensive annual disclosures,
ranging from the racial composition of its
workforce to the chemical composition of its
effluents.
The idea of requiring that firms disclose
information pertinent to society at large is
not a bad one. But the act seems to imply that
corporate employees are somehow more
likely to be injured on the job than other
workers and that corporations indulge in
more racial discrimination than privately
held firms. In the absence of any persuasive
evidence for such a position, the idea of singl
ing out incorporated firms for this sort of
mandate seems particularly inequitable, par
ticularly biased bv the current trend of anti

corporate sentiment.
The third major segment of the hill is an
economic nightmare. It reads like something
Ayn Rand might have used to show how
myopic and meddlesome — it not just plain
evil — politicians can he.
It stipulates that corporations must an
nounce plans to relocate their operations two
years in advance, and that these changes
must be reviewed by the secretary of labor
for the purpose of investigating "the feasibil
ity of preventing or minimizing such
employment loss by the modification of pro
duction lines and production techniques."
II the secretary were ultimatly to allow the
corporation to relocate its facility, then, ac
cording to the act. the firm would have to
continue paying an employee 85 percent ol
his annual salary if the move were to put that
person out of work.
In addition, if the relocation of the facility
w ere to cause a loss of rev enue to any "unit ol
local general government," then the firm
would be liable for N5 percent of that loss —
300 percent if the relocation were to a
foreign country.
The aim of all these rules and penalties
seems to be to ensure greater job security for
domestic workers and a more reliable tax
base for local governments. The fact is. how -
ever. that only a few narrow, ephemeral
goals would be achieved at the expense of
general economic welfare in America.
Workers in older towns with established
factories would" he safe in their jobs, while
growing towns would find it increasingly dif
ficult to attract corporate investment. Some
local governments would benefit from
guaranteed revenues, but corporations
would find themselves less and less able to
cut costs and meet new demands.
But even with all its irrationality and
flawed reasoning, still the worst thing about
the Corporate Democracy Act is its name.
We can overlook the logical errors made by
the nine congressmen who drafted the bill.
We should not, however, forget that those
nine congressmen jumped on the anti
corporate bandwagon and called it •'democ
racy."

There is a feeling in America today that
corporations are bad. that anyone involved
in business is a potential criminal and that to
make a profit is a sin. What's more, that
feeling is spreading.
I hear people describe profits as
"obscene" so often that I'm beginning to
expect the PTA to ban discussion of them
from our nation's schools. Last month, the
United States celebrated its first Big Busi
ness Day — an organized condemnation of
American corporations. Frankly. 1 think this
anti-business craze has gone too far.
It's one thing for Ralph Nader and Barry
Commoner to aim their solar-powered
rhetoric at corporate America. We have
come to expect such tantrums from them.
But it's another thing altogether when our
elected officials begin turning this hatred of
anything incorporated into legislation. Speci
fically. 1 am referring to Congressional Bill
H.R. 7010. the Corporate Democracy Act.
This bill, currently pending action in the
U.S. House of Representatives, embodies all
the worst elements of the anti-corporate fad.
It treats modern corporate structure and con
temporary corporate leadership as if there
were something intrinsically immoral about
them. And it singles corporations out for fai
lures that are in no way corporate in nature.
In addition, the bill seems totally oblivious
to the fact that corporations exist for the sake
ai producing. The act treats corporations as if
their sole raison d'etre is the provision of
jobs. By examining the faulty logic of the
three major segments of the bill, it will be
come clear that the Corporate Democracy
Act is precisely the sort of law we don't want
on the books.
Independent directors
The bill stipulates that the majority of the
board of any corporation subject to the act
shall consist of "independent" directors.
These would be persons not recently
employed by the firm in any managerial, fi
nancial or legal capacity. The reasoning be
hind this proposal is faulty in both a legal and
economic sense.
First, the act abridges the right to due pro
cess of law for present and future regular
board members. It undermines their voice in
the corporation by placing them in the
board's minority. This mandate clearly pre
supposes that any director with a working

relationship to the firm will exploit that rela
tionship for his own personal benefit. But the
implicit assumption that the non
independent director is a priori guilty of
some wrongdoing is utterly incompatible
with our legal philosophy, which assumes a
priori innocence.
Second, the idea of placing independent
directors in the dominant position on corpo
rate boards makes no economic sense what'
soever. To the extent that these independent
directors would not vote like the ni(jre
experienced, better-informed regular direc
tors. corporate boards would cease to make
valuable contributions to their firms. In the

short run.the boards would be responsible
for inferior decision making. And in the long
run.the boards-themselves would probably
lose their credibility and become powerless
organs to which no corporate manager would
feel obliged to listen.
Corporate disclosure
The second major portion of the bill stipu
lates that any corporation subject to the act
must make extensive annual disclosures,
ranging from the racial composition of its
workforce to the chemical composition of its
effluents.
The idea of requiring that firms disclose
information pertinent to society at large is
not a bad one. But the act seems to imply that
