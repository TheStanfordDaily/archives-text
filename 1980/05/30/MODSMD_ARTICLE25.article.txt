## Registration debate 
### 
I was very pleased at the
prompt and extensive coverage
given to the May 22 registration
debate between Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC) and
Students Against Soviet Aggres
sion. But 1 was troubled by the
fact that almost all of the discus
sion on military registration itself
went unreported.
For example, the central point
of David Setzer's presentation
lor the SAC side was that draft
registration would not add to
American military preparedness
since it could only speed up
mobilization about a week, and
since training camps could not be
made ready in time for new in
ductees under such a speeded-up
schedule.
Second. 1 believe the views on
welfare programs of Peter Pierce
of Students Against Soviet Ag
gression were inadvertently de
scribed in a way that may have
misled some readers. Pierce was
opposed to having an increased
military budget that would
create "an economic impetus for
the government to abandon
domestic social programs."
Third, I was misquoted in a
way that made my meaning un
clear. I said that the Soviets
feared Muslim anti-Soviet
"guerrilla success" in their own
backyard. The Daily's substitu
tion of "aggression" for "guer
rilla success" makes it look like
the Soviets were worried about
an Afghan invasion of the Soviet
Union. In addition, my exposi
tion of the views of Yale political
scientist Bruce Russetton World
War II were attributed to me as
my own findings.
Finally, the Daily story missed
one of the more revealing ex
changes of the debate. This took
place when Pierce said that Sy

rian invasion of a neighboring
country was a good example of a
proper occasion for the use of
America's new Rapid Deploy
ment Force. At that point a
member of the audience called
attention to the fact that Syria
had already invaded Lebanon, so
if Pierce's military policy had
been followed, the United States
would already have troops fight
ing in Lebanon.
