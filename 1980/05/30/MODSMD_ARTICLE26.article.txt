# Outrage over Oval
## 
### 
It was with more than a bit of
outrage that I read of the Uni
versity's plans to "renovate" the
Oval that fronts the Ouad.
Through the auspices of a gener
ous donation from a couple who
likes to jog through the area,
$150,000 is being spent there.
What trash.
Instead of asking the couple to
consider sending 15 deserving
students to school free for a full
year. The University used the
funds for the latest installment of
its master plan to turn the cam
pus into the equivalent of a sub
urban shopping mall. This "re
novation" comes soon after the
well-publicized outlay of
$90,000 for bollards. Can As
troturf in the Inner Ouad be far
behind?
With such a premium being
placed on the real thing these
days, why docs Stanford insist on
plasticizing its campus in this
way? This allergy to the real
world is only aggravated by an
admissions office that seems
bent on stocking the student
body with Brady Bunch clones.
How beneficial it would be if
the University's administration
realized that the insulation of its
students from the real world con
stitutes a deprivation rather than

an enhancement of the complete
educational process!
