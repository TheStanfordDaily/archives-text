# World News biased
## 
### 
We feel that the Daily's World
News section is biased toward a
conservative point of view and
that we in the University com
munity deserve better from an
"independent" newspaper. If we
wanted to read a conservative or
libertarian paper, we would go
buy one.
The Daily's recent selection of
articles on Cambodia, China,
Cuba and other socialist coun
tries can best be described as
statements from usually
anonymous sources and indi
viduals that add up to a diatribe
against socialism.
The recent article "Angolan
prosperity fades" (Daily, May
20) is an example of this biased
coverage. The article describes
the deterioration of the colonial
city of Luanda under the present
Marxist government. Nowhere
does the article even mention
that Angola is virtually at war
with the white government of
South Africa, which has em
barked on economic bombings
of civilian targets to undermine
Angola.
Nowhere does the article de
scribe the land reform or condi
tions in the countryside, where
most of the people live. Nor does
the article mention Angola's
gains in health, education and
the status of women.
The author says that most of
the Angolans appear to be
"bored and obedient," but
nowhere does he mention that
this differs from the view of

many writers who have de
scribed the Angolans' fierce
struggle for education, literacy
and a revolutionary culture.
As this country heads toward
severe economic problems and
internal rebellion, it does not
surprise us that the big newspap
ers take up much of their space to
tell us how bad socialism is and
how good capitalism is. After all.
according to the San Francisco
Chronicle itself. 80 percent of
the media outlets in this country
are owned by 10 conglomerates.
Because of this, we cannot ex
pect to hear or read much of the
problems of the capitalist coun
tries in Africa, like Zaire (whose
refugees live in Angola), or like
Equatorial Guinea (with its polit
ical refugees) or the Cameroons.
What we can expect to read is
how terrible life is in countries
like Angola, Mozambique,
Ginea-Bissau and Zimbabwe,
countries that are trying to or
ganize along socialist lines.
We expect more from the
Daily than to propagate this bias,
and worse, by selection of arti
cles. to increase that bias. This
problem could be partly solved
by the Daily making an extra ef
fort to get news stories from dif
ferent sources so that its cover
age will be better balanced.
