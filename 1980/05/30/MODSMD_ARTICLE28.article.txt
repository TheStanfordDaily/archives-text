## Delts trying to bridge gap 
### 
Recently, Douglas Feld and Rolf Munson wrote
(Daily, May 23) impugning the effectiveness of
disciplinary actions that the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity imposed upon several of its members. As
senior house associate (R A) of the fraternity, I feel
compelled to comment upon certain aspects of the
column.
Initially, I must express my sorrow that Feld and
Munson think the house suspensions amount to
"cosmetic...diversions." However, I can assure
them that the individuals thrown out of the house
do not think there is anything "cosmetic" about
living in Palo Alto next fall.
The Feld/Munson column recited a litany of acts
of vandalism wrought upon the Theta Xi fraternity,
which the columnists casually attributed to "Delts
and their compatriots": a broken freezer handle
and theft of freezer contents; a torn-up bathroom
door; and six broken windows.
As a matter of fact, "Delts and their compat
riots" were responsible for three windows broken
during the fall and winter quarters. The individuals
involved not only made amends, but also were
disciplined by the Delt house. However, the "bro
ken Ireezer" and "torn-up door" incidents posi
tively were not actions undertaken by "Delts and
their compatriots." And it should be stressed that
this is not simply an issue of credibility; the culprits
were identified, and the administration has a full
record of the incidents.
The Feld/Munson column further stated that, on
one occasion, I told the Theta Xi fraternity that it
should get used to having its windows broken this

spring (presumably by "Delts and their compat
riots" ). litis statement is perhaps an honest misin
terpretation of my remarks to Theta Xi, but more
probably an intentional falsehood elicited by the
columnists that borders on libel. In fact, I re
member precisely the form and context of my
comment.
I met with Theta Xi representatives during
winter quarter, following a broken window inci
dent. In response to a bald threat by Munson that
he would "take to baseball bats" if another window
at Theta Xi was broken, I replied that the Delt
house officers and myself would do everything pos
sible to prevent broken windows, but that a blanket
guarantee that no window would ever be broken
again would be an unrealistic gesture. In fact, since
that winter quarter meeting, there have been no
windows broken by a member of the Delt house.
A final note. Over the past decade, Delt-Theta
Xi relations have not been uniformly amicable, to
say the least. It is my belief that when the Delt
fraternity recently voted as a house to suspend
members for throwing four oranges at the Theta Xi
fraternity, the Delts took an effective and laudable
step toward bridging the gap between the houses.
In a related vein, I would be remiss not to add
that, with the glaring exception of bat-wielding
Munson, the members of Theta Xi have been
reasonable and patient this past year regarding
house relations. I owe them my utmost respect.
