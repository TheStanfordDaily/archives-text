## Rosenzweig falsely attacks ACLU 
### 
Robert Rosenzweig has submitted an ac
count of Prof. Bruce Franklin's case (Daily,
May 9) which shows that the Administration
is continuing to suppress information con
cerning Stanford's discharge of a faculty
member for pure speech. Rosenzweig not
only falsities the facts, but also attempts to
obscure the real issue: the University is con
ducting a star chamber trial of a tenured pro
fessor in violation of its own rules.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) asked for an open hearing in
Franklin's case because we have confidence
in our client and in our case.
Rosenzweig has falsely attacked the
ACLU for "factual misrepresentations,"
which are easy to refute:
1. The Charges and the Speeches. Distort
ing our columns, the Adminsitration claims
that we "misstate(d) the charges against
Franklin." But we did not state Stanford's
original charges against Franklin at all. We
wrote that Franklin had been dismissed for
delivering four speeches, and that assertion is
correct.
After unanimously finding one Administ
ration accusation against Franklin false ("the
Lodge incident"), the 1971 Advisory Board
recommended Franklin's discharge on the
remaining three charges ("White Plaza,"
"Computation Center," and "Old Union")
which together comprise four speeches. The
Administration apparently forgets what the
Advisory Board report memorializes: that
Franklin delivered two speeches at the Old
Union Courtyard. The Advisory Board
majority repeatedly condemned both Old
Union speeches as inciteful, and the Superior
Court ruled that both were constitutionally
protected expresssions of political dissent.
2. The Court Order. The Administration
cryptically argues that we were wrong in
claiming that the Court "ordered the univer
sity hearings to be reopened to reconsider
the penalty of dismissal," (our words) be
cause "the Court opened the case to be re
turned to the University for consideration of
what penalty should have been imposed."
(Rosenzweig's words.) These press office
semantics hardly prove that the Court
sanctioned the Administration's violations of
the University's own rules.
3. The Advisory Board. Rosenzweig quib
bles about our use of the phrase "Administ
ration and its Advisory Board," noting the

obvious fact that the Board is composed of
faculty members But since those professors
as a group are merely advisory to the Ad
ministration, they are the Administration's
Advisory Board. Our phrase is not only
grammatically correct but substantially ap
propriate to convey the Advisory Board's
deferential attitude toward the Administra
tion in this case. For example, the expedited
schedule for this hasty "hearing" was
adopted in compliance with President
Richard Lyman's request that the Board's
recommendation be released "no later than
the end of May."
4. The Adminsitration's Disregard for Uni
versity Rules. The Administration explains
its violation of Stanford's Rules for the Con
duct of Hearings by the Orwellian dev ice of
proclaiming that the hearing is not a "hear
ing" within the meaning of the rules. By
convenient relabeling, the Administration
has thus, with a stroke of the pen, revoked all
the rights "guaranteed" by the rules.
5. The Superior Court Decision.
Rosenzweig rails at our informing the Stan
ford community thai the Superior Court has
ruled that the Administration violated
Franklin's constitutional rights in 1972. But
even Rosenzweig's column reveals the truth
of our assertion. He admits that Franklin's
Old Union speeches "failed to meet the
Brandenberg (sic) test of incitement."
In clearer, less disingenuous words, the
Old Union speeches fall within the First
Amendment's protection. Since those
speeches were grounds for Franklin's dis
charge, and since punishment for protected
speech is a violation of fundamental rights,
the Adminsitration did indeed violate
Franklin's constitutional rights in 1972.
6. The Appeal Process. The Administra
tion continues its distortion of the facts about
its unsuccessful attempt to keep this case
from the University community. We fee!
compelled to set the record straight.
After the Superior Court ruled in 1978
that the two of Franklin's speeches were con
stitutionally protected, the Adminsitration
claimed that it alone should determine a
penalty on the remaining infractions. The
ACLU argued that the University officials
who had violated a professor's rights in the
first place could not make the final decision.
The judge agreed with the ACLU's posi
tion that a court should make the ultimate
decision on Franklin's reinstatement, but

said that he wanted the University to have a
chance to reconsider its original decision. At
that point, in the words of the Superior
Court. Stanford's attorneys "urged the court
to reconsider the implied decision" that the
University re-evaluation take place im
mediately. rather than after an appeal. The
ACLU argued in favor of returning the case
to Stanford immediately. The judge agreed
with us.
To preserve appeal rights, both the ACLU
and Stanford appealed all adverse orders en
tered in the case. The ACLU requested dis
missal of Stanford's appeal, not our own; we
simply advised the appellate court that our
appeal should also he dismissed only if the
reviewing court agreed with our view that
Franklin deserved immediate reconsidera
tion of his dismissal at the University. The
Administration strenuously objected to hav
ing the case returned to Stanford. The Court
of Appeal rebuffed the Administration's re
quest. and sent the case, as the ACLU had
requested, back to the University. The Ad
ministration petitioned for reconsideration
of that decision; the appellate court summar
ily rejected its application.
7. Oral Argument. Rosen/weig asserts that
the Administration has no objection to oral
argument, pinning the blame for the denial of
an open hearing on its Advisory BoJird. But
when ACLU attorneys sent a letter request
ing oral argument, the Administration coun
sel. far from concurring, did not even bother
to comment. The Advisory Board swittly re
fused the ACLU's request for open proceed
ings. Advisory Board Chairperson William
Clebsch refuses even to explain his determi
nation to proceed behind closed doors.
(Daily, May N.)
Failing to justify its star chamber tactics,
the Administration has resorted to attacking
us as unworthy of our organization.
Fortunately, the ultimate judge of our ac
tions will not be an apologist for the Stanford
"Administration. The ACLU saw a large or
ganization committing an injustice to an in
dividual, and concealing its actions from pub
lic scrutiny. We saw a need to expose that
injustice. Although we knew that Stanford is
a powerful institution, we spoke out.

argument, pinning the blame for the denial of
an open hearing on its Advisory BoJird. But
when ACLU attorneys sent a letter request
ing oral argument, the Administration coun
sel. far from concurring, did not even bother
to comment. The Advisory Board swittly re
fused the ACLU's request for open proceed
ings. Advisory Board Chairperson William
Clebsch refuses even to explain his determi
nation to proceed behind closed doors.
(Daily, May N.)
Failing to justify its star chamber tactics,
the Administration has resorted to attacking
us as unworthy of our organization.
Fortunately, the ultimate judge of our ac
tions will not be an apologist for the Stanford
"Administration. The ACLU saw a large or
ganization committing an injustice to an in
dividual, and concealing its actions from pub
lic scrutiny. We saw a need to expose that
injustice. Although we knew that Stanford is
a powerful institution, we spoke out.
{Dorothy Ehrlich is the executive director of

Robert Rosenzweig has submitted an ac
count of Prof. Bruce Franklin's case (Daily,
May 9) which shows that the Administration
is continuing to suppress information con
cerning Stanford's discharge of a faculty
member for pure speech. Rosenzweig not
only falsities the facts, but also attempts to
obscure the real issue: the University is con
ducting a star chamber trial of a tenured pro
fessor in violation of its own rules.
The American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) asked for an open hearing in
Franklin's case because we have confidence
in our client and in our case.
Rosenzweig has falsely attacked the
ACLU for "factual misrepresentations,"
which are easy to refute:
1. The Charges and the Speeches. Distort
ing our columns, the Adminsitration claims
that we "misstate(d) the charges against
Franklin." But we did not state Stanford's
original charges against Franklin at all. We
wrote that Franklin had been dismissed for
delivering four speeches, and that assertion is
correct.
After unanimously finding one Administ
ration accusation against Franklin false ("the
Lodge incident"), the 1971 Advisory Board
recommended Franklin's discharge on the
remaining three charges ("White Plaza,"
"Computation Center," and "Old Union")
which together comprise four speeches. The
Administration apparently forgets what the
Advisory Board report memorializes: that
Franklin delivered two speeches at the Old
Union Courtyard. The Advisory Board
majority repeatedly condemned both Old
Union speeches as inciteful, and the Superior
Court ruled that both were constitutionally
protected expresssions of political dissent.
2. The Court Order. The Administration
cryptically argues that we were wrong in
claiming that the Court "ordered the univer
sity hearings to be reopened to reconsider
the penalty of dismissal," (our words) be
cause "the Court opened the case to be re
turned to the University for consideration of
what penalty should have been imposed."
(Rosenzweig's words.) These press office
semantics hardly prove that the Court
sanctioned the Administration's violations of
the University's own rules.
3. The Advisory Board. Rosenzweig quib
bles about our use of the phrase "Administ
ration and its Advisory Board," noting the

obvious fact that the Board is composed of
faculty members But since those professors
as a group are merely advisory to the Ad
ministration, they are the Administration's
Advisory Board. Our phrase is not only
grammatically correct but substantially ap
propriate to convey the Advisory Board's
deferential attitude toward the Administra
tion in this case. For example, the expedited
schedule for this hasty "hearing" was
adopted in compliance with President
Richard Lyman's request that the Board's
recommendation be released "no later than
the end of May."
4. The Adminsitration's Disregard for Uni
versity Rules. The Administration explains
its violation of Stanford's Rules for the Con
duct of Hearings by the Orwellian dev ice of
proclaiming that the hearing is not a "hear
ing" within the meaning of the rules. By
convenient relabeling, the Administration
has thus, with a stroke of the pen, revoked all
the rights "guaranteed" by the rules.
5. The Superior Court Decision.
Rosenzweig rails at our informing the Stan
ford community thai the Superior Court has
ruled that the Administration violated
Franklin's constitutional rights in 1972. But
even Rosenzweig's column reveals the truth
of our assertion. He admits that Franklin's
Old Union speeches "failed to meet the
Brandenberg (sic) test of incitement."
In clearer, less disingenuous words, the
Old Union speeches fall within the First
Amendment's protection. Since those
speeches were grounds for Franklin's dis
charge, and since punishment for protected
speech is a violation of fundamental rights,
the Adminsitration did indeed violate
Franklin's constitutional rights in 1972.
6. The Appeal Process. The Administra
tion continues its distortion of the facts about
its unsuccessful attempt to keep this case
from the University community. We fee!
compelled to set the record straight.
After the Superior Court ruled in 1978
that the two of Franklin's speeches were con
stitutionally protected, the Adminsitration
claimed that it alone should determine a
penalty on the remaining infractions. The
ACLU argued that the University officials
who had violated a professor's rights in the
first place could not make the final decision.
The judge agreed with the ACLU's posi
tion that a court should make the ultimate
decision on Franklin's reinstatement, but

said that he wanted the University to have a
chance to reconsider its original decision. At
that point, in the words of the Superior
Court. Stanford's attorneys "urged the court
to reconsider the implied decision" that the
University re-evaluation take place im
mediately. rather than after an appeal. The
ACLU argued in favor of returning the case
to Stanford immediately. The judge agreed
with us.
To preserve appeal rights, both the ACLU
and Stanford appealed all adverse orders en
tered in the case. The ACLU requested dis
missal of Stanford's appeal, not our own; we
simply advised the appellate court that our
appeal should also he dismissed only if the
reviewing court agreed with our view that
Franklin deserved immediate reconsidera
tion of his dismissal at the University. The
Administration strenuously objected to hav
ing the case returned to Stanford. The Court
of Appeal rebuffed the Administration's re
quest. and sent the case, as the ACLU had
requested, back to the University. The Ad
ministration petitioned for reconsideration
of that decision; the appellate court summar
ily rejected its application.
