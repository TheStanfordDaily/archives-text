## Group blind to real issue 
### 
Dorothy Ehrlich's rejoinder to my comment
on her first two columns on the Franklin case
leaves me yearning for some substance to chew
on. The details of legal maneuvering teach me
nothing except renewed respect for the pro
cedural ingenuity of capable lawyers. 1 am in
clined, therefore, to reach for a real issue, one,
moreover, that the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) has been perversely blind to
since the Franklin case began.
1 hinted at that issue in my earlier column by
suggesting that the ACLU had grabbed hold ol
the wrong end of the Franklin case in the first
place. For those who were here in the late "b()s
and early '70s, I think my meaning is quite clear.
It occurs to me, though, that for many who
are now at Stanford those earlier years are not
part of their lives but part of history, and fairly
dim history at that.
So let me make the point clearly and bluntly:
the threat to civ il liberties on the Stanford cam
pus during that period, the so-called "chilling
effect" on free speech did not come from the
University administration, but from the vig
ilantes who, in the name of peace and high
principle, trashed buildings, occupied computer
centers.disrupted classes and public lectures,
and in many other ways made the public expres
sion of views different from theirs an act of
courage.
They were the repressers of dissent, the chil
lers of free speech. It was against them that
believers in civil liberties should have rallied.
That so few did is to the shame of those who did
not.
Perhaps I can make my point more vivid by
tolliijg of two small episodes from those days.
They are not especially unusual, others had
similar experiences, but these happened to me,
and so they have particular meaning to me.
Both occurred well before charges were
brought against Franklin.
The first episode occurred the day following
the first time the police actually broke upa sit-in
at Stanford. I was involved in the decision to
bring the police, and I was asked to defend the
decision at a public meeting. It took place be
fore a packed house in Tresidder's large lounge.
The meeting lasted for about five hours and for
sustained obscenity and hostility it remains un

lque in my experience.
A number of faculty mmbers were in Hie au
dience, but none saw lit or felt free to protest
that such uncivil conduct demeaned everyone
present. 1 remember one man in particular. He
is a member of my department and we knew one
another both professionally and socially. He sat
in silence, unprotesting. He is one of the faculty
members who last week made a sworn state
ment to the Advisory Board that the Franklin
decision had chilled free speech at Stanford.
The second episode took place a year or sc
later. I agreed to appear on a panel at the re
quest of ASSU. as I recall, to debate whethei
the Nuremberg Principles applied to war
related research. During the question period i
member ot the audience stood and said
" Rosenzweig. anyone who belie* es what you d(
deserves to die." Much of the audience cheered
but not m\ wife who was sitting in the au
ditorium nor my children who were listening.
Another member of the panel was a distin
guished holder of an endowed chair in one o
Stanford's professional schools. What an oppor
tunity for a respected leader of The Movement,
a believer in tree speech, to point out to a young
audience that the proper response to error is
truth, not murder; that threats of death have a
chilling effect on free speech and therefore have
no place in the university.
He did not. fie sat in silence, another of those
small examples of moral cowardice — yielding
to the fear of taking an unpopular position —
that are the real e\ idcnce of a chilling effect. A
decade later this man swore to the Advisory
Board that the Franklin decision chilled free
speech at Stanford.
Those were difficult times, though none of
the difficulties would have justified depriving
Franklin of his rights under the Constitution,
nor would they have supported a departure
from the highest traditions of academic free
dom.
I believe that the I ni\ ersity's action was con
sistent with the Constitution and that the prici
ples of academic freedom are intact and
flourishing at Stanford. I don't know where
Ehrlich was while all ot this was happening, but
there was a time when we could have used her.
