# Details of date with 'Early Date' divulged
## 
### 
Dear Readers,
My final column deals with a charitable I per
formed for the women on this campus last weekend. You
must all be familiar with the young man fondly
nicknamed "Early Date"' Kcmmeries. All quarter we ve
watched his romantic blunders splashed across this page.
First, it was few dates, then early dates, then no dates.
The Stanford community has come to leel a tender com
passion for the Mickey-Moused young man we see pick-

ing his nose every third Friday.
Well, as a colleague of the bumbling Cassanova, I vc
grown fond of the guy. So, when the phone rang last
Thursday and Kcmmeries identified himselt and asked
me to the show, I agreed, in a moment of insanity. If I
had known he meant a peep show, I might'vc been more
skeptical!
This date was Memorial Night Nightmare! It might
have helped my initial reaction if Kemmenes had
thought to bathe at least a week in advance. I m not
picky, but even the cologne couldn't cover that pervasive
scent. It was nice of him to bring me candy — one
Snickers bar and a piece of gum (already chewed).
Dinner was lovely. Steak and lobster at Si/zler's. I was

so impressed when Billy-boy took out lys credit cards to
pay for dinner. Unfortunately they had expired in '72
and he resorted to food stamps.
He had asked me if I liked pets. Of course. 1 said. I
figured he was going to pick up some gerbil food or
something before the alleged "show." No sir — I get in
the poor excuse for an automobile and who should be
sittin' pretty in the hack seat?? Lulubell!!!
As he fed her the remains of our culinary disaster
(what do you expect from $2.39 steak and lobster?) I
noticed a book shoved under the front seat: Everything
You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex in a Celica
but Were Afraid to Ask. After a whiff of Lulubell. I
figured I was the intended spark plug. But, to his credit,
Kemmeries was a perfect gentleman. He was too busy
keeping Lulubell from munching on his 100 percent
cornhide belt.
Driving up to the peep show, I noticed a gang of
questionable characters running toward the car. A bit
frightened. I asked "Early Date" to turn around. "Don't
be afraid," he reassured me, "it's the Hudda's Angels.
They're my pals."
Somehow 1 managed to convince Kemmeries to get
back on 101 and speed toward Embarcadero.
He winked as we passed Malibu Raceway but I
motioned onward and before we knew it, Town and
Country loomed before us. "How "bout some scallops at
Stickneys?" he asked. What was this? Deja vu — ad
nauseumT'
Admittedly, 1 felt a little guilty. Billy had purchased a
lovely green suit from the Army Surplus store, and the
haircut testified to the technological advances made by
the kitchen staff producing bowls at Roble. He tried.
I le asked me up to his room for an after-dinner drink.
"Bill, I'm a teetotaler," I said. "Oh, I love the ballet
myself," he responded with a moronic grin on his face.
Luckily, his idea of an after-dinner drink was a quick
stop at the third-floor water fountain. He was thoughtful

enough to wipe the rim of the styrofoam cup before
handing it to me.
Once in his room, I began to think that maybe, just
maybe, "Early Date" might pull through. He put on
some nice symphony music, lit a candle, locked Lulubcll
in the closet and ushered me to his desk chair. I Ic leaned
toward me. Slowly. "Wanta play Scrabble?"
That was it!! I had given him every opportunity for a
little nookie. I had even overlooked the fact that his two
uncapped teeth might induce massive hemorrhaging in
my upper lip if I actually kissed the guy. No way, donut
brain!

Dear Readers,
My final column deals with a charitable I per
formed for the women on this campus last weekend. You
must all be familiar with the young man fondly
nicknamed "Early Date"' Kcmmeries. All quarter we ve
watched his romantic blunders splashed across this page.
First, it was few dates, then early dates, then no dates.
The Stanford community has come to leel a tender com
passion for the Mickey-Moused young man we see pick-

ing his nose every third Friday.
Well, as a colleague of the bumbling Cassanova, I vc
grown fond of the guy. So, when the phone rang last
Thursday and Kcmmeries identified himselt and asked
me to the show, I agreed, in a moment of insanity. If I
had known he meant a peep show, I might'vc been more
skeptical!
This date was Memorial Night Nightmare! It might
have helped my initial reaction if Kemmenes had
thought to bathe at least a week in advance. I m not
picky, but even the cologne couldn't cover that pervasive
scent. It was nice of him to bring me candy — one
Snickers bar and a piece of gum (already chewed).
Dinner was lovely. Steak and lobster at Si/zler's. I was

so impressed when Billy-boy took out lys credit cards to
pay for dinner. Unfortunately they had expired in '72
and he resorted to food stamps.
He had asked me if I liked pets. Of course. 1 said. I
figured he was going to pick up some gerbil food or
something before the alleged "show." No sir — I get in
the poor excuse for an automobile and who should be
sittin' pretty in the hack seat?? Lulubell!!!
As he fed her the remains of our culinary disaster
(what do you expect from $2.39 steak and lobster?) I
noticed a book shoved under the front seat: Everything
You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex in a Celica
but Were Afraid to Ask. After a whiff of Lulubell. I
figured I was the intended spark plug. But, to his credit,
Kemmeries was a perfect gentleman. He was too busy
keeping Lulubell from munching on his 100 percent
cornhide belt.
Driving up to the peep show, I noticed a gang of
questionable characters running toward the car. A bit
frightened. I asked "Early Date" to turn around. "Don't
be afraid," he reassured me, "it's the Hudda's Angels.
They're my pals."
Somehow 1 managed to convince Kemmeries to get
back on 101 and speed toward Embarcadero.
He winked as we passed Malibu Raceway but I
motioned onward and before we knew it, Town and
Country loomed before us. "How "bout some scallops at
Stickneys?" he asked. What was this? Deja vu — ad
nauseumT'
Admittedly, 1 felt a little guilty. Billy had purchased a
lovely green suit from the Army Surplus store, and the
haircut testified to the technological advances made by
the kitchen staff producing bowls at Roble. He tried.
