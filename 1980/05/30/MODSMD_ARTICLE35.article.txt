## International day occurs 
### Rose Chan Staff Writer 
International storytelling, home-cooked de
licacies and folk dancing are just several fea
tures of International Festival Day to he held
tomorrow at Bechtel International Center.
Entertainers, cooks, craftsmen and other par
ticipants for the festival have been drawn mostly
from the international families of students here.
"There seems to he so much talent out there and
so much interest in other cultures," said Donna
Bolster, Bechtel's program coordinator. "I
thought it would be appropriate to see if we
could get everyone together.
Bolster says the festival, which used to be
organized by the Community Committee for
International Students, is being revived after six
years by Bechtel, Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) and the YWCA. and that response
has been excellent.
As participation is voluntary and admission
to the community is free, no central financing is
involved. Participants do "what is in their
means to do," said Bolster, and vendors only
hope to break even.
Crafts demonstrations planned are Chinese
brush painting, food decorating from Thailand,
batiking from Indonesia and Japanese flower

arranging. There may be a charge to take part in
some of these activities.
Food lovers can sample foods from about 15
cultures, among them Algeria, Germany, Sin
gapore, the Andean cultures, the Middle East
and Japan.
The back patio of the center will feature con
tinuous entertainment. Indonesian dancing,
Brazilian music, a Capoeira demonstration,
Stanford's Ballet Folklorico and the New Eng
land Contra are some of the highlights.
Anne Schechter from the ASSU will give
hourly travel forums with slide presentations on
Central and Latin America, Western and East
ern Europe, the Middle East. Africa and South
east Asia. Photographs from around the world
taken by Marvin Baron, Foreign Student ad
visor at UC-Berkeley's International House,
will be displayed in the living room.
The young at heart won't want to miss the
International Storytelling for Children sessions
by the Peninsula Storyteller's Guild.
Festivities on the International Center
grounds will take place from 1 1 a.m. to 5 p.m.
At S p.m., a square dance on the Tresidder
Deck will feature the bluegrass tunes ot the
"Give Me 'A' String Band." Admission is free.
