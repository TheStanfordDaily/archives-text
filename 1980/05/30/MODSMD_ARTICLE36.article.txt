# Drug connection implicated
## Defense plane auctions suspended 
### Bill Curry The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — The De
partment of Defense has sus
pended its sales of surplus milit
ary aircraft pending an investiga
tion into their use in drug traffic
operations.
The decision was made early
this week and was announced
Wednesday by Sen. Harrison
Schmitt (R-N.M.), who had
asked for a halt to the auctions
after learning that many of the
old cargo planes had been used
for large-scale smuggling of
cocaine, marijuana and
Ouaaludes from Colombia,
primary supplier ot these sub
stances to the United States.
Secretary of Defense Harold
Brown's action is not expected to
immediately affect the actual au
ctioning of old military cargo
planes from the Davis-Monthan
Air l v orce Base in Tucson, Ariz.,
which last year brought the U.S.

Treasury $3.4 million. No sales
had been scheduled before au
tumn, and a source in Brown's
oil ice said that a decision on
what to do about the problem
should be made well before then.
I he source said the investiga
tion into the sales and the planes'
use by drug smugglers would
consider options to "minimize
the problem," but added that
one option would be to allow
them to continue as now.
"We're hoping," the source
said, "for a resolution within two
months."
The Honeyard
The Los Angeles Times re
ported early this month that the
Dav is-Monthan facility
known as "The Bonevard"
lias become the nation's single
biggest source of large-load
cargo planes for drug smuggling.
The U.S. Customs Service has
identified 1 27 old military planes
being used in drug trafficking.

The planes — IX'-3s. IX'-fts,
C'onvair 240 sand 440 — are
loaded with multiton,
multimillion-dollar cargos of
drugs on remote air strips in Col
ombia's (iuajira Peninsula.
From there, they fly non-stop to
U.S. coastal areas, sweep low
under spotty radar defenses, and
touch down at improvised run
wavs or at inland airports.
The Customs Service, like
Schmitt, has also urged a halt to
the surplus plane sales as part of
a broad, stepped-up campaign
against airborne drug smuggling,
which the U.S. Drug Enforce
ment Administration estimates
accounts for about 30 percent of
the drug traffic.
Auctioneering
The Customs Service has also
proposed that the Federal Avia
tion Administration impose
tight, nev, controls on border
area airplane operations, such as

those used around the nation's
most congested airports.
The surplus military planes are
auctioned oft by sealed bidby the
Defense Logistics Agency. Most
are bought by a handful ol com
panies that specialize in sal\ag
ing or refurbishing them for such
uses as fighting forest t ires, haul
ing fish from Alaska, transport
ing breeding cattle and other
legitimate uses.
But in some cases, smugglers
have obtained them outright or
purchased them from the refur
bishing companies. Salvage
company owners have told The
limes that they have no way of
knowing what a customer plans
to do with his plane.
Schmitt said he had been gi\ en
assurances that the Department
o! Defense ill report back to
him "within a few weeks on
proposals to deal with (the prob
lem )."
