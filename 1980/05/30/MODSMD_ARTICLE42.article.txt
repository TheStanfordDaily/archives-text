cleaned in Santa Barbara." he said, "but I
look at it as a success because we got every
thing that 1 wanted accomplished. I was wor
ried about two things going into the tourna
ment. first of all, I wanted to get the team

and my players qualified for nationals. I went
through the meetings and sweated through
three shirts, but we got the team qualified,
four singles players and two doubles teams.
"Secondly, 1 was worried that we might
peak too soon. I feel I got everything 1 could
have asked for at the meeting and now 1
know we haven't peaked yet."
