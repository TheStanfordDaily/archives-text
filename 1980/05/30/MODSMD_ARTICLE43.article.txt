# The 						Friday interview
## Linda Bowman: standout golfer 
### 
(Editor's note: For the first
time in the squad's 10-year his
tory, Stanford's women golfers
garnered their first intercollegiate
championship in April at the
I SI I Intercollegiate Tourney in
San Diego. Leading the Cardi
nals and placing first overall was
junior Linda Bowman who shot a
two-round total of 154 on the

par- 76 course. Earlier in the sea
son at the Arizona Invitational
Bowman took third as Stanford
captured second place behind
nationally-ranked Arizona State.
Throughout the year the San
Rafael native has sparked the
team, under new coach Tim
Baldwin, to its finest season yet,
gaining recognition as the Stan
ford Athlete of the Month by the
Sticknev Athletic Foundation in
April. Most recently the
economics major finished third
here this month at the Nor Cat
Championships as Stanford
again placed second. In this Fri
day Inten ieK Bowman talks to
Robert Stone as she prepares for
finals and the upcoming A/AW
Nationals to be played at the Uni
versity of New Mexico.)
Stone: Are you surprised by the
team s success or yoitr own scores
this season? 'â€¢
Bowman: I was prett\ surprised
about how well I played. 1
thought I'd play well before the
season, but not as well as 1 did. I
thought the team could play bet
ter: they weren't quite playing to
full potential.
Stone: Was the coaching transi
tion as smooth as it seems to have
been ?
Bowman: It was pretty rough fall
quarter, us getting used to him
and him getting used to us. There
were six different personalities


Linda Bowman
trying to work together. Now it's
just great, and I think that it was
good that we went through that
period, lie's just super right
now. He's made a great differ
ence in our performance.
Stone: How did you get stinted
playing golj?
Bowman: M\ parents pla\ed a
lot. My mom played quite a bit of
amateur golf and played pro for a
number of years. My father
started playing when he was
about six. I started when I was
15.1 used to ride horses in shows
but the judging was too political.
That's what I like about goll
there's no judging involved.
Stone: Do von think one of the
reasons yon got a late start in golf
was because yon were sur
rounded by it when von were
young?
Bowman: Yeah, kind 01. I had
always wanted to ride horses and
when I was young I received this
horse as a present. I rode for
about the next 10 years. I gave it

up because of the judges,
though.
Stone: What do yon consider the
strong and weak points of your
game?
Bowrfi'an: M\ sand game is very
strong and my accuracy is strong.
I'm fairly long but not as long as
some of the girls I pla\ with. My
lairway woods are probably
weak now, but my putting has
improved, and I think that's
w here the game is at.
Stone: Since tournaments take
placc practically ah year round,
are there ever times when you find
it difficult to get motivated'.'
Bowman: Yes. definitely. That's
one thing that Tim is very good
at. I always have priority tour
naments that arc above the
others, but sometimes out there
it just doesn't happen. It's a mat
ter of choosing your tourna
ments and determining which
are most important.
Stone: Is there any particular
time of year that you prefer to
play?

Bowman: Well. I love the spring
and the summer, although I
still play well in the rain. I guess
that's because it (rain) slows the
tempo of the game down. It
forces me to take my time. I'd
rather play out in the nice
weather, though.
Stone: Do you have a particular
philosophy about the game?
Bowman: Well, kind of. I've
been taking lessons from Bob
dampen and he teaches a very
mathematical approach to the
game. It involves a lot of physics
and planes and angles. I don't
follow it to the degree he does,
but I've adopted that approach.
He's totally into the game. It 1 hit
a shot into the bunker he'll say.
"Good, now you can practice
your bunker shot." If you keep
that attitude it's more fun, and
you'll keep improving. I guess
basically I just try to make the
best of a situation.
Stone: What has been the most
challenging course you've ever
played?

Bowman: The orient the Univer
sity of Georgia is rcail> tough.
There's not a Hat hole on the
course. The greens are rock hard
they have Bermuda grass,
which is different from here, and
the wind is always blowing.
Stone: Wlmt is your outlook for
the Nationals coming up?
Bowman: The outlook is pretty
good. The team is I Oth as far as
standings go Inote: The top 10
women's trains arc invited to par
ticipate in the Nationals.l Hope
fully everyone on our team will
be playing well at the same time.
In most of the tournaments this
season some of us have been off
while the others were playing
well and \ ice-s ersa. So hopefully
we'll all be playing well.
Stone: What arc your plans for
the future'.'
Bowman: I think I am going to
try to go pro. and I definitely
want to go on to business school.
It's hard to say right now, but I
want to try it as a pro for a while
and see how I can do.
