## Berkeley Jazz Festival 1980 
### 
In the last 14 years. the Ber
keley Jazz festival has grown
from a homespun college pro
duction to a national event that
rivals Monterey and even New
port for preeminence in the jazz
world. This year's festival. held
last weekend, offered a range ol
stvles and depth of talent that
surpassed any musical event I
have ever attended.
The brightest stars included:
Keith Jarrett. Oscar Peterson.
Art Blakey. Betty Carter.
McCoy Tyner. Ron Carter.
Hubert Laws. Ronnie l aws.
Freddie Hubbard, Stanley
Clarke. Herbie Hancock. Chick
Co re a, Carlos Santana and John
McLaughlin.
In fact, if an\thing there might

have been too many stars; the
Berkeley producers might follow
Newport's lead and use their fes
tival as an opportunity to intro
duce new talent to a very recep
tive audience.
In the meantime, however. I'll
be happy to enjoy the best. At
the Berkeley Community
Theatre on Friday the venerable
Art Blakey. with yet another set
of new Jazz Messengers, started
things off. Blakey stuck to up
beat. mainstream jazz most of
the time, though my favorite
piece was a long, gentle medley
called "Gershwin Suite."
Blakey was followed by the
equally venerable Oscar Peter
son, who eased his massive body
down in front of a gigantic piano

and proceeded to give his audi
ence a short course in jazz his
tory Peterson can play anything.
Barrelhouse, bebop, ballads,
straight ahead. Latin, blues
any thing. 11 is solos filled the hall
with as much music as the entire
Art Blakey ensemble.
In fact, when Peterson was
joined by his guitarist Joe Pass,
(who played several superb solo
songs himself) and bv his bassist
Jim Hevvart. the quality of the
music declined. This was cause of
partly by an irritating buzz in
Hewart's bass, but mainly, I
think, because Peterson so com
pletely dominated the trio. He
set the tempo; he established
bass rhythms more commanding
than Hewart's and ran through

You're With."' Stutt has pfayed
together tor five years now. and
the musicians know each other
very well. Incapable of surprising
each other, they love to surprise
the audience. Their tav orite trick
is to push their sounds into deep,
fast currents, with each instru
ment playing a seemingly inde
pendent solo, and then to burst
into sudden explosions of simul
taneity .
Stutl was followed by Chick
Corea. whose music has gone
through many changes over the
vears and now sounds closer than
ever to the edge of rock. Once
the protege of Miles Davis.
Corea now is a master in his own
right; he played with (and in
structed) a group of musicians
who looked young enough to be
in high school. Bunny Brunei,his
impressive, rather cocky bassist,
engaged him in long,
stichomythic duets that de
lighted the crowd but which grew
repetitive and aimless.
Overall, however, the benign,
almost cherubic Corea led his
audience through labyrinths of
sounds and styles — down dazzl

melodies more airy than Pass'.
After the trio had played sev -
eral songs together. I began to
wish I could hear Peterson alone.
Saturday's concert was sold
out. I missed the Bay area's own
Andy Narrell and arriv ed just in
time to hear Stuff, a group com
posed of top-flight studio session
men: Cornell Dupree, Gordon
bdwards. FricGale. Christopher
Parker, Steve Gadd and Richard
lee. Playing a very fast and to
tally controlled jazz that never
lost touch with its blues h;isis.
Stuff smoked through about
seven long songs, including a
medley that began with Stevie
Wonder's "'Signed. Sealed, Del i
v ered" and a sparkling \ ersion of
Stephen Stills' "Love the One

ing corridors of "fusion" jazz,
down (\ia Brunei's bass) into
dark Caribbean nights and sw
inging cha-chas, and finally out
into the clear, mystic light famil
iar to fans of the old Return to
Forever.
The All-Star Jam that fol
lowed Coreli disappointed me.
Plagued by sound troubles (si
lent mikes, a disconcerting feed
back buzz through all the quiet
passages), the group failed to
come together and never hit full
stride. Jorge Dal to. the pianist,
was virtually inaudible; while
Freddie Hubbard, who thought
we could not hear him. drowned
out Hubert Laws' flute. And en
couraged. perhaps. b\ the
amateurish lighting, the group
showcased guitarist Lee
Ritenour far too often — even. I
thought, when he tried to decline
and let someone else solo. This
was. after all. one of those \ery
risky ventures — an "all-star"
jam of musicians who rarely play
together. They played well, but
failed to meet the standards set
that afternoon. They failed par
ticularly. in comparison with the

awesome session that capped the
festival Sunday.
That concert (we did not feel
the earthquakes) began with
John McLaughlin, whom I mis
sed. He was followed by McCoy
Tyner. A 1 Foster and Ron Car
ter. who played soothingly
acoustic and relatively
mainstream jazz. Foster, a gen
erally vivacious drummer, took a
back seat this time, while Tyner
played his usual brilliant, relent
less music — so hard to describe,
so full of Coltrane and yet so
pianistic — his bright, sharp, dis
tinct notes flung into the order
ing percussion of Foster and Car
ter. Carter himself was elegant
and inscrutable, moving from in
tensely meditative solos into tiny
flashes of humor and e\en self
parody. It is a tribute to this trio's
power that it managed to engage
and excite a crowd that had come
to hear more hard-driving,
high-volume fusion jazz.

tion of stars (Alphonse Mouzon,
Jon Lucien, Stanley Clarke,
Herbie Hancock, Carlos San
tana) performed all kinds of
music — rock, jazz, soft ballads
and Latin rhythms reminiscent
of the early Santana albums.
Backed by the percussion section
from Santana's band, the group
rose immediately to the very
highest level of improvisation
and stayed there.
Somehow, seemingly against
all odds, Hancock's cosmopoli
tan cool blended beautifully with
Clarke's boyishness and Santa
na's selfless virtuosity. Towards
the end of their set, Santana bec
koned to someone offstage and
held out his guitar. To
everyone's amazement, a smiling

John McLaughlin stepped for
ward to take it, and immediately
launched into oie of his long, in
trospective, icy solos — so unlike
the spicy heat of Santana.
The band, especially Clarke,
threw itself into the new chal

happily in the background, grin
ning and banging a cowbell.

forces on one guitar, Santana
fingering the left hand.

Art Blakey. with yet another set
of new Jazz Messengers, started
things off. Blakey stuck to up
beat. mainstream jazz most of
the time, though my favorite
piece was a long, gentle medley
called "Gershwin Suite."
Blakey was followed by the
equally venerable Oscar Peter
son, who eased his massive body
down in front of a gigantic piano

and proceeded to give his audi
ence a short course in jazz his
tory Peterson can play anything.
Barrelhouse, bebop, ballads,

any thing. 11 is solos filled the hall
with as much music as the entire
Art Blakey ensemble.
In fact, when Peterson was
joined by his guitarist Joe Pass,
(who played several superb solo
songs himself) and bv his bassist
Jim Hevvart. the quality of the
music declined. This was cause of
partly by an irritating buzz in
Hewart's bass, but mainly, I
think, because Peterson so com
pletely dominated the trio. He
set the tempo; he established
bass rhythms more commanding
than Hewart's and ran through

the musicians know each other
very well. Incapable of surprising
each other, they love to surprise
the audience. Their tav orite trick
is to push their sounds into deep,
fast currents, with each instru
ment playing a seemingly inde
pendent solo, and then to burst
into sudden explosions of simul
taneity .
Stutl was followed by Chick
Corea. whose music has gone
through many changes over the
vears and now sounds closer than
ever to the edge of rock. Once
the protege of Miles Davis.
Corea now is a master in his own
right; he played with (and in
structed) a group of musicians
who looked young enough to be
in high school. Bunny Brunei,his
impressive, rather cocky bassist,
engaged him in long,
stichomythic duets that de
lighted the crowd but which grew
repetitive and aimless.
Overall, however, the benign,
almost cherubic Corea led his
audience through labyrinths of
sounds and styles — down dazzl

melodies more airy than Pass'.
After the trio had played sev -
eral songs together. I began to
wish I could hear Peterson alone.
Saturday's concert was sold
out. I missed the Bay area's own
Andy Narrell and arriv ed just in
time to hear Stuff, a group com
posed of top-flight studio session
men: Cornell Dupree, Gordon
bdwards. FricGale. Christopher
Parker, Steve Gadd and Richard
lee. Playing a very fast and to
tally controlled jazz that never
lost touch with its blues h;isis.
Stuff smoked through about
seven long songs, including a
medley that began with Stevie
Wonder's "'Signed. Sealed, Del i
v ered" and a sparkling \ ersion of
Stephen Stills' "Love the One

ing corridors of "fusion" jazz,
down (\ia Brunei's bass) into
dark Caribbean nights and sw
inging cha-chas, and finally out
into the clear, mystic light famil
iar to fans of the old Return to
Forever.
The All-Star Jam that fol
lowed Coreli disappointed me.
Plagued by sound troubles (si
lent mikes, a disconcerting feed
back buzz through all the quiet
passages), the group failed to
come together and never hit full
stride. Jorge Dal to. the pianist,
was virtually inaudible; while
Freddie Hubbard, who thought
we could not hear him. drowned
out Hubert Laws' flute. And en
couraged. perhaps. b\ the
amateurish lighting, the group
showcased guitarist Lee
Ritenour far too often — even. I
thought, when he tried to decline
and let someone else solo. This
was. after all. one of those \ery
risky ventures — an "all-star"
jam of musicians who rarely play
together. They played well, but
failed to meet the standards set
that afternoon. They failed par
ticularly. in comparison with the

awesome session that capped the
festival Sunday.
That concert (we did not feel
the earthquakes) began with
John McLaughlin, whom I mis
sed. He was followed by McCoy
Tyner. A 1 Foster and Ron Car
ter. who played soothingly
acoustic and relatively
mainstream jazz. Foster, a gen
erally vivacious drummer, took a
back seat this time, while Tyner
played his usual brilliant, relent
less music — so hard to describe,
so full of Coltrane and yet so
pianistic — his bright, sharp, dis
tinct notes flung into the order
ing percussion of Foster and Car
ter. Carter himself was elegant
and inscrutable, moving from in
tensely meditative solos into tiny
flashes of humor and e\en self
parody. It is a tribute to this trio's
power that it managed to engage
and excite a crowd that had come
to hear more hard-driving,
high-volume fusion jazz.

In the last 14 years. the Ber

from a homespun college pro
duction to a national event that
rivals Monterey and even New
port for preeminence in the jazz
world. This year's festival. held
last weekend, offered a range ol
stvles and depth of talent that
surpassed any musical event I
have ever attended.
The brightest stars included:
Keith Jarrett. Oscar Peterson.
Art Blakey. Betty Carter.
McCoy Tyner. Ron Carter.
Hubert Laws. Ronnie l aws.
Freddie Hubbard, Stanley
Clarke. Herbie Hancock. Chick

than Hewart's and ran through

You're With."' Stutt has pfayed
together tor five years now. and
the musicians know each other
very well. Incapable of surprising
each other, they love to surprise
the audience. Their tav orite trick
is to push their sounds into deep,
fast currents, with each instru
ment playing a seemingly inde
pendent solo, and then to burst
into sudden explosions of simul
taneity .
Stutl was followed by Chick
Corea. whose music has gone
through many changes over the
vears and now sounds closer than
ever to the edge of rock. Once
the protege of Miles Davis.
Corea now is a master in his own
right; he played with (and in
structed) a group of musicians
who looked young enough to be
in high school. Bunny Brunei,his
impressive, rather cocky bassist,
engaged him in long,
stichomythic duets that de
lighted the crowd but which grew
repetitive and aimless.
Overall, however, the benign,
almost cherubic Corea led his
audience through labyrinths of
sounds and styles — down dazzl

melodies more airy than Pass'.
After the trio had played sev -
eral songs together. I began to
wish I could hear Peterson alone.
Saturday's concert was sold
out. I missed the Bay area's own
Andy Narrell and arriv ed just in
time to hear Stuff, a group com
posed of top-flight studio session
men: Cornell Dupree, Gordon
bdwards. FricGale. Christopher
Parker, Steve Gadd and Richard
lee. Playing a very fast and to
tally controlled jazz that never
lost touch with its blues h;isis.
Stuff smoked through about
seven long songs, including a
medley that began with Stevie
Wonder's "'Signed. Sealed, Del i
v ered" and a sparkling \ ersion of
Stephen Stills' "Love the One

ing corridors of "fusion" jazz,
down (\ia Brunei's bass) into
dark Caribbean nights and sw
inging cha-chas, and finally out
into the clear, mystic light famil
iar to fans of the old Return to
Forever.
The All-Star Jam that fol
lowed Coreli disappointed me.
Plagued by sound troubles (si
lent mikes, a disconcerting feed
back buzz through all the quiet
passages), the group failed to
come together and never hit full
stride. Jorge Dal to. the pianist,
was virtually inaudible; while
Freddie Hubbard, who thought
we could not hear him. drowned
out Hubert Laws' flute. And en
couraged. perhaps. b\ the
amateurish lighting, the group
showcased guitarist Lee
Ritenour far too often — even. I
thought, when he tried to decline
and let someone else solo. This
was. after all. one of those \ery
risky ventures — an "all-star"
jam of musicians who rarely play
together. They played well, but
failed to meet the standards set
that afternoon. They failed par
ticularly. in comparison with the

awesome session that capped the
festival Sunday.
That concert (we did not feel
the earthquakes) began with
John McLaughlin, whom I mis
sed. He was followed by McCoy
Tyner. A 1 Foster and Ron Car
ter. who played soothingly
acoustic and relatively
mainstream jazz. Foster, a gen
erally vivacious drummer, took a
back seat this time, while Tyner
played his usual brilliant, relent
less music — so hard to describe,
so full of Coltrane and yet so
pianistic — his bright, sharp, dis
tinct notes flung into the order
ing percussion of Foster and Car
ter. Carter himself was elegant
and inscrutable, moving from in
tensely meditative solos into tiny
flashes of humor and e\en self
parody. It is a tribute to this trio's
power that it managed to engage
and excite a crowd that had come
to hear more hard-driving,
high-volume fusion jazz.

mance. by Friends, epitomized
the variety of music played

the name given to a loose collec
tion of stars (Alphonse Mouzon,
Jon Lucien, Stanley Clarke,
Herbie Hancock, Carlos San
tana) performed all kinds of
music — rock, jazz, soft ballads
and Latin rhythms reminiscent
of the early Santana albums.
Backed by the percussion section
from Santana's band, the group
rose immediately to the very
highest level of improvisation
and stayed there.
Somehow, seemingly against
all odds, Hancock's cosmopoli
tan cool blended beautifully with
Clarke's boyishness and Santa
na's selfless virtuosity. Towards
the end of their set, Santana bec
koned to someone offstage and
held out his guitar. To
everyone's amazement, a smiling

John McLaughlin stepped for
ward to take it, and immediately
launched into oie of his long, in
trospective, icy solos — so unlike
the spicy heat of Santana.
The band, especially Clarke,
threw itself into the new chal
lenge, while Santana circled
happily in the background, grin
ning and banging a cowbell.
Then he and McLaughlin joined
forces on one guitar, Santana
fingering the left hand.
McLaughlin the right. The
crowd, of course, stayed on its
feet through two more songs and
at least two encores. When
Friends finally left the stage for
the last time, even the most rabid
fans seemed willing to let them
go. They had played for nearly
three hours.
