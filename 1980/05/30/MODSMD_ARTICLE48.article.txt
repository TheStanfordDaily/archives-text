# Silent spectral images of Delvaux
## 
### 
The San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art through this Sunday
is hosting a retrospective show oj
the works of Paul Delvaux, one
of the most important li\ ing sur
realists.
Delvaux, S3, was born in Bel
gium where he continues to live
and work. The show is part of
Belgium Today, an American
commemoration of the 150 th
anniversary of Belgian indepen
dence.
In 24 large oils and a selection
of watercolors, drawings and
lithographs, the dream-like
world of Delvaux is appearing
for the first time on the West
Coast.
The world of Delvaux, espe
cially in contrast to the flat bright
planes of the abstract world to
which so many American
museum-goers have become ac
customed. has a classic tone that
seems distinctly European.
Stately nudes wander through
landscapes suggestive of Piero
della Francesca. In "The Spitz -
ner Museum" (1943), the ar
chitecture of classical antiquity is
used to create a landscape and
perspective reminiscent of the
Quattrocento Italians.
In some paintings classical ar
chitecture is combined with or
eclipsed by scenes of deserted
-Belgian towns, the seaside, or
railway stations. But, always, the
scenes are rendered as if one
were looking on the other side of
a mirror at a silent spectral image
of reality.
In "The Station in the Forest."
as in many Delvaux paintings,
time seems to stand still. The

trains depart and arrive, forever
removed from the two girls who
watch them. Where arc the trains
going? For prisoners of time
their destination may evoke
eternity, and for prisoners of
space, infinity.
The selection of works at
SFMOMA includes several
works from as early as 1926
when Delvaux's painting took on
an expressionist style, until he
turned' to surrealism in the mid
-19305. The influence of the silent
dreamscapes of deChirico, who
Delvaux acknowleges as the
greatest outside influence on his
work, is first seen in "Palace in
Ruins," (1935).
The most obvious difference
between Delvaux's work and
deChirico's is Delvaux's em
phasis on the human presence.
The most frequent and most con
troversial form in Delvaux's
works is the female nude. These
enigmatic women wander
through nearly all of his land
scapes, their large eyes some
times thoughtful or searching,
but more often turned inward on
themselves. >
According to art historian
Jean Depreau, "Not only does
this nudity create an irremedi
able emptiness among his fi
gures, it also adds to the weight
of their solitude, the weight of
thv'ir frailty."
' Yet, as often as isolation and
the barriers beween people ap
pear to be themes in his works,
the artist does not verbally state
this as one of his concerns. He
speaks little on the themes of his
paintings; those close to him say

that many of his ideas come trom
childhood memories — or start
that way — as remembrances of
an image or scene. Mis study oi
architecture at the Academy ot
Fine Arts in Brussels as a young
man and his knowledge of clas
sics also seem to influence his
work.
Delvaux paints at least eight
hours every day. He often hums
to himself, in a charming melodic
voice and seems to get pleasure
even out of small things — chil
dren visiting or seeing an in
teresting piece by another artist.
When I went with Delvaux to
\ isit a Brussels home for which
he had painted an extensive set

of murals he meandered unob
trusively through the house,
sometimes humming conten
tedly. He looked at murals he
had done 25 years ago with a
bemused expression. "It was a
lot of work," he said.
DeC'hirico's description ol an
artist's work seems to fit Dc-
Ivaux. "The artist will seek this
work within the remote depths ol
the inner self; there no murmur
of a brook, no song ol a bird, no
rustle of leaves passes." In the
show at SFMOMA we are
treated to a glimpse ol Delvaux's
inner world.

'Station in the Forest" bv Delvaux
The San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art through this Sunday
is hosting a retrospective show oj
the works of Paul Delvaux, one
of the most important li\ ing sur
realists.
Delvaux, S3, was born in Bel
gium where he continues to live
and work. The show is part of
Belgium Today, an American
commemoration of the 150 th
anniversary of Belgian indepen
dence.
In 24 large oils and a selection
of watercolors, drawings and
lithographs, the dream-like
world of Delvaux is appearing
for the first time on the West
Coast.
The world of Delvaux, espe
cially in contrast to the flat bright
planes of the abstract world to
which so many American
museum-goers have become ac
customed. has a classic tone that
seems distinctly European.
Stately nudes wander through
landscapes suggestive of Piero
della Francesca. In "The Spitz -
ner Museum" (1943), the ar
chitecture of classical antiquity is
used to create a landscape and
perspective reminiscent of the
Quattrocento Italians.
In some paintings classical ar
chitecture is combined with or
eclipsed by scenes of deserted
-Belgian towns, the seaside, or
railway stations. But, always, the
scenes are rendered as if one
were looking on the other side of
a mirror at a silent spectral image
of reality.
In "The Station in the Forest."
