# Encore, 'La Cantatrice Chauve'
## 
### 
The French house seminar production of
French playwright Eugene lonesco'sLa Can
tatrice Chauve ( The Bald Soprano) left audi
ences howling in laughter Tuesday and Wed
nesday.
Presented in the original French version,
the theater-of-the-absurd play on words
progressed at an ever-increasing pace and
noise level. At the climax, the actors
screamed multi-lingual gibberish and
bounded around the stage, while the onlook
ers roared unabashedly.
Director Kamal Xein strayed from lones
co's script to allow more students to partici
pate in the play. Midway through the per
formance, the actors portraying the main
characters switched.
During a halting speech delivered in a vir
tual blackout by Le Capitaine des Pompiers
(the fire chief, played by David Rosenthal),
Steve Gules ich and Vikki Urban conceded
their roles of M. and Mme. Smith to Patrick
Longmire and Denise Keplinger. The parts
of M. and Mme. Martin also changed from

Kurt Ogle and Kathy Kemby to Kurt
Schroeder and Colleen Dolan.
The trade-off added freshness and en
thusiasm to the verbose, inactive plot with
out producing undue contusion. Distinctive
costuming and make-up maintained the
characters' recognizable identities.
lonesco first intended to present a parody
of foreign language texts in La Cantatrice
Chauve. Thus, the play is set in a typically
English household and opens with a mun
dane monologue by Mme. Smith on the de
tails of her family's repast.
Urban created the farcical mood by jux
taposing the insignificant content of her
words, "We have eaten well this evening,
with the animatedly angry tone of her deliv
ery. Gulevich's serious, polemic style in argu
ing petit points added to the sarcasm.
Leslie Gavin's insolent, domineering pre
sence as the forceful and omniscient maid
startled the audience into applause. The
lively dialogue with Le Capitaine. as she re
cited the poem, "Le Feu." was one of the

successfully absurd moments of the play.
The most often quoted passage of La Can
tatrice Cliauve, which has played every night
for the last 10 years in a small Paris theater, is
the interchange between M. and Mme. Mar
tin. in which they discover that they live in
the same apartment, own the identical bed
room furniture and have a remarkably un
ique child . . . none of which either remem
bers. Ogle's and Kemby's childish innocence
almost made the scene credible.
Except for a few onstage lapses into giggl
ing. the final drama erupted magnificently.
The harsh sounds and nonsensical phrases
emitted by the actors melded into a confused
but altogether comic melee.
Longmire especially crowed in vigorous
pomposity, and the others followed his lead.
Cacophony resounded throughout La
Maison I rancaise and across the Magi not
Line to Ha us Mitteleuropa in tribute to
lonesco's ribald insanity.
