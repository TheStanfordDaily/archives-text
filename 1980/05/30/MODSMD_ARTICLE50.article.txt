# 'Superstar' shines
## 
### 
Lots of people could think of
ways to spend $30,000.
But few people could think of
ways to spend it as well as The
Company did on its production
of the rock opera Jesus Christ
Superstar.
Andrew Lloyd Weber and
Tim Rice's Superstar, which runs
through Saturday in Frost Am
phitheater. is likely the most am
bitious musical Stanford stu
dents have produced. Before
another word is said, praise is
due to producer Michael
McNabb and director Todd Har
ris for choosing a show which has
not been outdated by thousands
of years and. not least of all. for
raising $30,000 to produce it.
Aside from being the most ex
pensive student show. Superstar
is also the first campus musical to
be performed in Frost, which
holds 9500. The challenge ol
projecting in a theater this si/e is
met well by both the cast and the
production stall.
The chorus members, who
probably have the biggest part in
the show, are strong both vocally
and dramatically. They are able
to maintain good tone and dic
tion at any volume and. most of
the time, breathe tremendous
emotional lite into the show.
Their energy projects equally
well in their dancing and in their
singing. Under thesuperv ision of
sophomore Martha Carter, the
40-member chorus moves with
amazing precision and dramatic

effect. With the exception of a
few overchoreographed mo
ments, such as the opening
number. Carter's choreography
is well-tailored to the show's
music and the' abilities of the
cast.
In fact, the amount of dancing
in this production distinguishes it
from most professional produc
tions of Superstar, which are
staged with little movement.
Highlights of this show include
"Simon Zealots." featuring
Lamott Atkins, and "Herod's
Song." in which toe pointing and
Hexing are used to great comic
effect.
The standard of excellence set
by the chorus is. for the most
part, matched by the leads. Jeff
Bell (Jesus) and Ping Ho (Mary
Magdalene) possess two of the
most gorgeous \ oiccs to be heard
anywhere, and perform their
parts with simplicity and sincer
ity. In a few instances, however,
the two tail to exploit the full
dramatic potential of their roles.
Despite his shattering rendi
tion of "Gethsemane," which
makes clear the fact that Bell
both looks and feels his part, he
does not quite project the sym
pathy and rapport so necessary
to the Christ character. Ho, as
well, falls slightly short of the
powerful emotion present in
songs like "I Don't-'Know How
to Love Him" and ''Could We
Start Again Please?"
Dick Butterfield, on the other

hand, captures the full drama of
the role of Judas and gives a per
formance as compelling as his
performance in last year's Hair.
Although his voice is generally
good, greater strength in the
upper and falsetto ranges might
make it better suited for this
part.
Probably the most balanced
performances ot the show are
given by the supporting leads.
Daniel Gunther (Pilate). Peter
Bensinger (Caiaphas). and Bar
ney Stein (Peter), all of whom
sing, act and move exceptionally
well.
The show's dramatic aspects
are well complemented b\ its
technical aspects. The orchestra,
under the baton of Robert Mil
ler. does a good job with an
enormous amount of music. De
signer Peter Maradudin and
technical director \ nice Foecke
have put together a workable
and rather interesting set. and
manage some especially striking
lighting effects.
Yet. most of the credit tor the
show's success belongs to direc
tor Todd Harris, whose staging is
natural and visually exciting.
Harris' honest, uncontrived in
terpretation ot the plot makes his
Superstar even more accessible
and more colorful than the
show's professional productions.
Hosanna. I leysanna. See it to
night.
