The Customs House
Edge Water Place
979-A Edgewater Blvd.
Foster City
574-7904'
The Customs House has
achieved what all restaurants
would like to. but few do. It
otters an abundance of good
food, at reasonable prices in a
creative and enjoyable at
mosphere.
As you walk into the re
staurant the effect ot the at
mosphere is immediate.
Situated on a man-made
canal, it resembles an old Hn
glish provincial outpost. You
could imagine \ourself in a

tropical colony around the
turn of the century.
The interior is totally un
ique. Comfortable high
backed wicker chairs afford
the patrons privacy without
closing them off from the
general atmosphere of the re
staurant. The tables are
situated amidst a cargo ot
crates, drums, barrels and
boxes. The sounds of the sea:
waves, seagulls and other
marine noises replace con
ventional background music.
It is not difficult to become
absorbed in the created at
mosphere and find vourself

and time.
This, along with merely de
cent food would make the
( ustoms Mouse worth a visit,
but the menu more than holds
its own. Creativ ely presented,
it offers approximatelv 75
dishes deliciously prepared
and reasonably priced. ( Ac
cording to Ed Engoron. the
owner and creator of The
Customs House, no entree
will be priced higher than
$9.95).
A wide variety of appetiz
ers are served in generous
portions. You could almost
make a meal of any one of
them, choosing from the in

creasingly popular potato
skins, a huge basket ot tortilla
chips with guacamole or ev en
a basket of prawns and fritters.
The entrees are the most
amazing because one would
assume that the $9.95 price
limit would mean smaller por
tions. Not so! Along with the
choice ot soup or salad, bread
and corn on the cob or baked
potato came a good-sized
main course serv ing that I was
unable to finish. (This hap
pens to me about once in a
blue moon).
The four barbecued ribs.

were trulv great. II ribs are

not your thing, the same qual
ity and abundance seem to he
available in any of the large
array of meat and seafood en
trees.
If you have room after
wards. there is an amazing list
of alcoholic dessert drinks
that would satisfy anybody's
imagination. Sinfully delici
ous, they can only be experi
enced. Given such tempting
names as "Menage a Trois"
and "Oral Fixation." they are
rich, thick and alcoholic
Finally, there is nightly en
tertainment. As you might
expect, it too is presented
creatively. In addition to pro
fessional groups, the guests
themselves get up to displav
their talents on "stage fright
night."
1 he' Customs House is de
finitely a place to go to for a
whole evening, not just for
dinner. Even though the food
and the atmosphere more
than warrant a \isit. you'd be
missing a lot if you didn't stav
to check out the entertain
