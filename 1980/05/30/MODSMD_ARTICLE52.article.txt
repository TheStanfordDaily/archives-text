Genghi's Khan isn't famous for
nothing; after all. he invented
Mongolian Barbecue. Mongo
lian what? That's right, Mongo
lian Barbecue. If you had been
part ol Genghis' crew when he
invaded China around 1211
A.D. you could have sampled
this new treat, consisting of
thin-sliced meats and fresh veg
etables cooked on a gridiron.
You could have been part of that
new wave of cooking that
brought together the best of
Mongolia and China into one
steaming hot bowl of quick
cooked lamb, beef, pork, turkey
and cabbage, sprouts, onions,
celery, and carrots. The Mongo
lians brought the meat, the
Chinese the vegetables, and the
combination was an immediate
success.
It you're kicking yourself for
hav ing been born in the Jet-Age
instead ot the iron — or iiridiron

age, stop. Right down in
Mountain View the spirit of
Genghi's Khan lives on, gridiron
and all.
When you walk into Colonel
Lee's Mongolian Bar-B-O
you're not exactly overawed by
the decor. It's very simple and
utilitarian: tables and chairs.
You don't have to spend a long
time over the dinner menu
either, there's only one choice — -
Mongolian you-know-what. But
that one choice is good and you
get to put your dinner together
yourself.
After some tasty appetizers
(which resemble miniature egg
rolls) and soup, you follow your
nose, literally, to the Bar-B-O.
There, you choose from the raw
meats and vegetables mentioned
earlier. Add sauces and oils to
your liking, and hand your bowl
to the chef. He takes it, puts it on
the gridiron and does his thing.
Two minutes later you're walk
ing back to your table with your
meal, where delicious little
"Nancy biscuits" and steamed
rice await you.
For $5.95 you'get unlimited
Bar-B-O so you can go back and
sample different combinations ot
meats, vegetables, and sauces.
There are about ten kinds of
sauces ranging from spicy (not
hot) to curry, and the Colonel is
good enough to suggest different
combinations for you.
Since you choose your ingre
dients yourself, you can make
your meal vegetarian and low
calorie or full of meats and
sauces. It seems that Americans
aren't the only ones who know
about freedom of choice.
When you've tried enough
kinds ot Bar-B-O. the waitress
brings you a single fortune
cookie, a classic finale to an East
Asian meal.
Mongolian Bar-B-O is open
every day, except Monday, from
l 1:30 a.m. (for lunch) to 10:00
p.m. Reservations are not re
quired, but it's probably a good
idea to get there early on
weekends.
So try a little Mongolian cook
ing in sunny Mountain View. It's -
close, it's inexpensive, it's really
delicious, and it's unusual.
Though Colonel Lee's Bar-B-O
is a modest restaurant, you'll re
member your meal.
