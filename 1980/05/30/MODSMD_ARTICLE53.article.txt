Heaven Can Wail ★ ★★
New Varsity, Thursday
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent tor its
success upon machinations of the
ploj that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinate
persistance and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. Strange as it
sounds, lie's good at this, and his
efforts are supported by those of a
well-addled supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as it
is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is a
thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Very good. Never again will
1 confuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.
— John Nielsen
Days of Heaven ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Tuesday & Wednes
day
Terence Malick (Badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination of the way
four main characters react to their
environment and to each other.
The setting is the Texas Pandhan
dle; the time is 1916. and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to be
made up of wheat fields and sky;
Malick makes his characters seem
both mythic and insignificant in
their magnificient surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives a
fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically different
world. Also starring Richard Gere
and Sam Shepard. Cinematog
raphy by Nestor Alemandros.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tango in Paris ★ ★★
New Varsity, Saturday-Monday
Bernardo Bertolucci, who di
rected llie Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too
deeply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels about
the ideas the movie is expressing,
there's no denying that they are
backed up impressively. Marlon
Brando is overwhelming as a
burnt-out, suicidal American. The
photography, as always with Ber
tolucc 1 (ireat, and the sets are
amazingly depressing — they all
seem to have rust-stained water
marks on the walls. Incidentally,
the "X" rating, for those going in
search of cheap thrills, now seems
ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
1 Coming Home ★ ★★★
Mountain View Theatre
Set in 1968, Coming Home is a
drama about people at •home deal
ing with the Vietnam War. The

Bruce Dern character is crudely
drawn, and the mov ie occasionally
suffers from poor transitions, but it
more than makes up for these dc
ffciences with its understanding of
the look and feel of the time. Your
doubts are ultimately replaced by
joy. Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
give excellent, compelling perfor
mances; anil Hal Ashby's direction
is excellent throughout. Fonda and
Voight received Oscars for their ef
forts.
—J.M.
Tommy ★ ★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Fownshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy — magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weakensses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some of
the resulting fragments miss every
thing and others are right on the
mark. Although the Who get the
message across better live (you
realize that when you hear Oliver
Reed singing). Russell probably
made the best possible movie ver
sion of Tommy, and that's just what
the world's greatest rock band de
serves.
— Ron Lillejord
doing in Style ★ ★★
New Varisty, Thursday
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and I ee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
von to be effective.
—R.I
10 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a scnii
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter.
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek. that is. This poster-star seems
to have reached her artistic peak as
the vacuous" 10" the title refers to.

111 That Jazz ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Boh 112 osse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wiklly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding on this some
times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles

and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
mu Iti -faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show -biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was m trouble from the start
with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anvvvav.
— R.F.

Cabaret ★ ★★ill-
New Varsity, tonight
A magical movie that absolutely
overwhelms you with its quaking,
quivering energy. That energy is
personified in Li/a Minnelli, whose
triumphant performance is
matched by the brilliance of Joel
Gray as the master ot ceremonies.
Director Boh Fosse utilizes the
enormous skills of the late
cinematographer Geoffrey Un
(sworth and creates a mood ol such
lyrical style and grace that it's easy
to forget that Cabaret was only Ins
second movie. A must-see film.
R.L.
Kramer r.v. Kramer ★★★ l/ 2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and ayoungsterof almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat-

like character study of a divorced
man s struggle to love and care for
his son (arkfvice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of ihe
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Strecp)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary pcrfor

mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how hei character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb joh in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Mcxander co
stars, and the supeib composition is
the work ot cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.F.
Apocalypse Xoh ★★★★
Mountain View Theatre
An extraordinary work of mad
genius Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is. I think, the best American mov ie
of the just-ended decade. It lias al
most untenable ambitions, but the
profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ncss ol this "impossible." almost
nihilistic, vision ol mankind Star
ring Marlon Brando. Martin
Sheen, Robert Duvall. and Fre
deric Forrest.

Caligula
Aquarius. Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In

that combines big-time stars (Mal

with hard-core sex (you name it).
I ntortunately. these two groups
are mutually exclusive, and audi
ence never learns if O'Toole is trulv
deserving of his surname. This
overly violent movie purports to
tell a story of ancient Rome, but it
is really about the calculations ot
buck-hungry maga/ine publishers
attempting one of history's greatest
tie-ins: a mov ing, grunting Penth
ouse. It you want ancient Rome,
watch Hen Hur onT V. II you want
porn, take Caligula's $0 admission

Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing. in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley Macl.aine (as Rand's
wife, who is desperately seeking at
tection). but the I ilm drags on as we
see more and more people be taken

ever they want — as Chance rises

Although it's a decided regres

Old Mill, weekend midnight spe

A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One He* Over the
Cuckoo v Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision ot America, but even in
those terms. Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made With John Savage. Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

The Tin Drum ★★★ V2
Aquarius Twin. Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small hoy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror. the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent). a haunting,
young boy w ho refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
adulthood, it is tunny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorffs
direction In German, with subti- 1
ties.

Milos Forman (One He* Over the

The Tin Drum ★★★ V2
Aquarius Twin. Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small hoy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror. the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent). a haunting,
young boy w ho refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
adulthood, it is tunny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorffs
direction In German, with subti- 1

Heaven Can Wail ★ ★★
New Varsity, Thursday
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent tor its
success upon machinations of the
ploj that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinate
persistance and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. Strange as it
sounds, lie's good at this, and his
efforts are supported by those of a
well-addled supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as it
is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is a
thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Very good. Never again will
1 confuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.

Days of Heaven ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Tuesday & Wednes
day
Terence Malick (Badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination of the way
four main characters react to their
environment and to each other.
The setting is the Texas Pandhan
dle; the time is 1916. and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to be
made up of wheat fields and sky;
Malick makes his characters seem
both mythic and insignificant in
their magnificient surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives a
fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically different
world. Also starring Richard Gere
and Sam Shepard. Cinematog
raphy by Nestor Alemandros.

Last Tango in Paris ★ ★★
New Varsity, Saturday-Monday
Bernardo Bertolucci, who di
rected llie Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too
deeply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels about
the ideas the movie is expressing,
there's no denying that they are
backed up impressively. Marlon
Brando is overwhelming as a
burnt-out, suicidal American. The
photography, as always with Ber
tolucc 1 (ireat, and the sets are
amazingly depressing — they all
seem to have rust-stained water
marks on the walls. Incidentally,
the "X" rating, for those going in
search of cheap thrills, now seems
ludicrously harsh.

Mountain View Theatre

As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Fownshend's allegorical rock

splatter all over the place. Some of
the resulting fragments miss every

made the best possible movie ver

New Varisty, Thursday
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and I ee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch

Blake Edwards' values are, for lack

Dudley Moore is an ingratiating

111 That Jazz ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Boh 112 osse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wiklly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding on this some
times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles

and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
mu Iti -faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show -biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But
Fosse's instincts have a genius of

that he was m trouble from the start

Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as

between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and ayoungsterof almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat-

like character study of a divorced
man s struggle to love and care for
his son (arkfvice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of ihe
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Strecp)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary pcrfor

mance only accentuates the de

Apocalypse Xoh ★★★★
Mountain View Theatre
An extraordinary work of mad
genius Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio

images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is. I think, the best American mov ie
of the just-ended decade. It lias al
most untenable ambitions, but the

The Tin Drum ★★★ V2
Aquarius Twin. Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small hoy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror. the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent). a haunting,
young boy w ho refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
adulthood, it is tunny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorffs
direction In German, with subti- 1

Heaven Can Wail ★ ★★
New Varsity, Thursday
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent tor its
success upon machinations of the
ploj that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinate
persistance and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. Strange as it
sounds, lie's good at this, and his
efforts are supported by those of a
well-addled supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as it
is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is a
thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Very good. Never again will
1 confuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.

Days of Heaven ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Tuesday & Wednes
day
Terence Malick (Badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination of the way
four main characters react to their
environment and to each other.
The setting is the Texas Pandhan
dle; the time is 1916. and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to be
made up of wheat fields and sky;
Malick makes his characters seem
both mythic and insignificant in
their magnificient surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives a
fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically different
world. Also starring Richard Gere
and Sam Shepard. Cinematog
raphy by Nestor Alemandros.

Last Tango in Paris ★ ★★
New Varsity, Saturday-Monday
Bernardo Bertolucci, who di
rected llie Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too
deeply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels about
the ideas the movie is expressing,
there's no denying that they are
backed up impressively. Marlon
Brando is overwhelming as a
burnt-out, suicidal American. The
photography, as always with Ber
tolucc 1 (ireat, and the sets are
amazingly depressing — they all
seem to have rust-stained water
marks on the walls. Incidentally,
the "X" rating, for those going in

Mountain View Theatre

ffciences with its understanding of

As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Fownshend's allegorical rock

director Ken Russell's strengths

splatter all over the place. Some of
the resulting fragments miss every
thing and others are right on the
mark. Although the Who get the

made the best possible movie ver

New Varisty, Thursday
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and I ee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch

Blake Edwards' values are, for lack

Dudley Moore is an ingratiating

111 That Jazz ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Boh 112 osse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wiklly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding on this some
times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles

and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
mu Iti -faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show -biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But
Fosse's instincts have a genius of

Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as

frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat-

like character study of a divorced
man s struggle to love and care for
his son (arkfvice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of ihe
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Strecp)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.

Apocalypse Xoh ★★★★
Mountain View Theatre
An extraordinary work of mad
genius Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is. I think, the best American mov ie
of the just-ended decade. It lias al
most untenable ambitions, but the

The Tin Drum ★★★ V2
Aquarius Twin. Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small hoy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror. the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent). a haunting,
young boy w ho refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
adulthood, it is tunny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorffs
direction In German, with subti- 1

Heaven Can Wail ★ ★★
New Varsity, Thursday
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent tor its
success upon machinations of the
ploj that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinate
persistance and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. Strange as it
sounds, lie's good at this, and his
efforts are supported by those of a
well-addled supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as it
is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is a
thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Very good. Never again will

Days of Heaven ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Tuesday & Wednes
day
Terence Malick (Badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination of the way
four main characters react to their
environment and to each other.
The setting is the Texas Pandhan
dle; the time is 1916. and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to be
made up of wheat fields and sky;
Malick makes his characters seem
both mythic and insignificant in
their magnificient surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives a
fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically different
world. Also starring Richard Gere

Bernardo Bertolucci, who di

the ideas the movie is expressing,
there's no denying that they are
backed up impressively. Marlon
Brando is overwhelming as a
burnt-out, suicidal American. The
photography, as always with Ber
tolucc 1 (ireat, and the sets are
amazingly depressing — they all

the "X" rating, for those going in

that's largely unjustified. George

and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin

111 That Jazz ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Boh 112 osse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wiklly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding on this some
times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles

and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
mu Iti -faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show -biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But

Writer-director Robert Benton's

heart. Benton constructs a moving,

like character study of a divorced

his son (arkfvice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of ihe
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben

does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Strecp)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a

not his point of view. Aided by the

frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over

almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is. I think, the best American mov ie

Caligula
Aquarius. Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In

that combines big-time stars (Mal

with hard-core sex (you name it).
I ntortunately. these two groups
are mutually exclusive, and audi

overly violent movie purports to
tell a story of ancient Rome, but it
is really about the calculations ot

The Tin Drum ★★★ V2
Aquarius Twin. Palo Alto
The Tin Drum is an ambitious
adaptation of Gunter Grass' classic
novel about a small hoy with un
usual powers in World War II
Germany. As an allegory of Ger
man acquiescence to the Nazi hor
ror. the film gets a little murky with
metaphor. But as a visual work, it is
filled with startling images. And as
the story of Oskar Mazerath
(David Bennent). a haunting,
young boy w ho refuses at age three
to grow another inch closer to
adulthood, it is tunny, moving and
finally irresistible. The entire cast is
superb, as is Volkor Schlondorffs
direction In German, with subti- 1

Heaven Can Wail ★ ★★
New Varsity, Thursday
Very wry. l ike a Thurber story
without the bite. Dependent tor its
success upon machinations of the
ploj that come totally out of the
blue — if the movie is to work it
must continually outwit its audi
ence.
And it does, for the most part.
Warren Beatty, though big and
strong, has more than a little Wal
ter Mitty in him — he moves
through the picture with obstinate
persistance and a stubborn sense
that he's been cheated. Strange as it
sounds, lie's good at this, and his
efforts are supported by those of a
well-addled supporting cast.
It has been noted everywhere
that the picture is based on a 1941
Robert Montgomery movie, but
Heaven isn't so much a remake as it
is an effort to exhume a kind of
movie that I'd thought was dead
and gone. It doesn't just stick old
lines into new faces and play off its
inferiority to the original — this is a
thoughtful reintroduction to a far
more intelligent kind of comedy
than that which is currently the
norm. Very good. Never again will
1 confuse Warren Beatty with Clint
Eastwood.
— John Nielsen
Days of Heaven ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Tuesday & Wednes
day
Terence Malick (Badlands) di
rected this almost hypnotically
beautiful examination of the way
four main characters react to their
environment and to each other.
The setting is the Texas Pandhan
dle; the time is 1916. and the tone,
paradoxically, is both ironic and
melancholy. The world seems to be
made up of wheat fields and sky;
Malick makes his characters seem
both mythic and insignificant in
their magnificient surroundings.
Brooke Adams, heroine of Inva
sion of the Body Snatchers, gives a
fine performance as the refugee
from the slums of Chicago who
finds herself in a radically different
world. Also starring Richard Gere
and Sam Shepard. Cinematog
raphy by Nestor Alemandros.
—Jim Mattson
Last Tango in Paris ★ ★★
New Varsity, Saturday-Monday
Bernardo Bertolucci, who di
rected llie Conformist and 1900,
delves deeply — perhaps too
deeply — into existential angst
here. But however one feels about
the ideas the movie is expressing,
there's no denying that they are
backed up impressively. Marlon
Brando is overwhelming as a
burnt-out, suicidal American. The
photography, as always with Ber
tolucc 1 (ireat, and the sets are
amazingly depressing — they all
seem to have rust-stained water
marks on the walls. Incidentally,
the "X" rating, for those going in
search of cheap thrills, now seems
ludicrously harsh.
—J.M.
1 Coming Home ★ ★★★
Mountain View Theatre
Set in 1968, Coming Home is a
drama about people at •home deal
ing with the Vietnam War. The

Bruce Dern character is crudely
drawn, and the mov ie occasionally
suffers from poor transitions, but it
more than makes up for these dc
ffciences with its understanding of
the look and feel of the time. Your
doubts are ultimately replaced by
joy. Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
give excellent, compelling perfor
mances; anil Hal Ashby's direction
is excellent throughout. Fonda and
Voight received Oscars for their ef
forts.
—J.M.
Tommy ★ ★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
As a movie, Who guitarist Pete
Fownshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy — magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and weakensses. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some of
the resulting fragments miss every
thing and others are right on the
mark. Although the Who get the
message across better live (you
realize that when you hear Oliver
Reed singing). Russell probably
made the best possible movie ver
sion of Tommy, and that's just what
the world's greatest rock band de
serves.
— Ron Lillejord
doing in Style ★ ★★
New Varisty, Thursday
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and I ee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
von to be effective.
—R.I
10 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a scnii
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter.
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek. that is. This poster-star seems
to have reached her artistic peak as
the vacuous" 10" the title refers to.

111 That Jazz ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Boh 112 osse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wiklly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding on this some
times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles

and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
mu Iti -faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show -biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was m trouble from the start
with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anvvvav.
— R.F.

Cabaret ★ ★★ill-
New Varsity, tonight
A magical movie that absolutely
overwhelms you with its quaking,
quivering energy. That energy is
personified in Li/a Minnelli, whose
triumphant performance is
matched by the brilliance of Joel
Gray as the master ot ceremonies.
Director Boh Fosse utilizes the
enormous skills of the late
cinematographer Geoffrey Un
(sworth and creates a mood ol such
lyrical style and grace that it's easy
to forget that Cabaret was only Ins
second movie. A must-see film.
R.L.
Kramer r.v. Kramer ★★★ l/ 2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and ayoungsterof almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat-

like character study of a divorced
man s struggle to love and care for
his son (arkfvice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of ihe
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Strecp)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary pcrfor

mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how hei character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb joh in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Mcxander co
stars, and the supeib composition is
the work ot cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.F.
Apocalypse Xoh ★★★★
Mountain View Theatre
An extraordinary work of mad
genius Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is. I think, the best American mov ie
of the just-ended decade. It lias al
most untenable ambitions, but the
profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi

nihilistic, vision ol mankind Star
