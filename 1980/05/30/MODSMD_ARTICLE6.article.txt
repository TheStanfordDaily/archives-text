FORT WAYNE, Intl. — Vernon
Jordan Jr.. 44, the articulate leader of
the National Urban League, was in
very serious condition last night, after
lie was shot in the back in what evi
dence indicated was a carefully plan
ned attack.
Jordan, a major civil rights figure,
was wounded early yesterday by a
sniper firing a high-powered weapon
from a grassy area overlooking both
Jordan's motel room and the motel
parking lot here.
After more than four hours of
surgery, doctors said he was expected
to recover.
"It is miraculous he lived,", said Dr.
Jeff Towles who headed the medical
team at Parkview Memorial Hospital
that operated on the Urban League
executive director. "The shot narrowly
missed his spine," the doctor said, ad
ding that the bullet broke into several
fragments when it hit Jordan.
Towles said that eight hours after the
operation Jordan's vital signs — pulse,
breathing and blood pressure — were
holding steady .
Very serious
"We have downgraded his condition
from critical to very serious. This does
not mean he is out of danger. But it
means he is weathering the post

operative period fairly well," Towles
said.
Towles said Jordan was experiencing
a slight numbness in his left leg but was
able to move it. One shot hit Jordan in
his chest area and a second glanced off
his right leg, inflicting superficial
wounds. Doctors said they were unsure
why his left leg felt numb.
Doctors were "extremely happy at
the point that he (Jordan) is moving
along as well as he is," Towles said.
"He's in great pain," said the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, head of Operation
PUSH, who. with Jordan, served as
major spokesman for black aspirations
during the last decade.
Not racial
Both local officials here and federal
officials in Washington said they did
not think the shooting was racially
motivated. Rut Fort Wayne police said
they had neither suspects nor motive
lor the seemingly carefully planned at
tack. FBI director William Webster or
dered a full investigation by his agents
on possible civil rights violations.
Jackson, after visiting the scene of
the attack, called the shooting "racial,"
adding that it aroused "all the suspi
cions of racial, political assassination."
Benjamin Hooks, president of the
National Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People, said that

while he would not speculate on the
motive, it was obvious to him that the
attack was planned.
Professional
"This is not a'Saturday night' type of
shooting." Fort Wayne Mayor Win
field Moses, flanked by local black
leaders, told reporters at the hospital,
where Jordan is in the intensive care
unit. "It was not done out of passion. It
was a professionally executed shooting.

This was done by someone who under
stands guns and knows how to use
them," the mayor said.
His assessment was based on evi
denee that police gathered from a
triangle of grass formed by the con
vergence of three roads, where the
sniper lay in wait, apparently for a long
period of time. The area where two and
perhaps three shots were fired is about
