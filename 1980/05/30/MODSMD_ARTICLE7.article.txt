## 
### Jiri Weiss Staff Writer 
President Richard Lyman this week
protested proposed changes in immig
ration rules that would force thousands
of Iranian students to leave the United
States before completing their studies
and would make all other foreign stu
dents renew their \isas annually.
In a telegram to Immigration and
Naturalization Service Acting Com
missioner David Crosland. Lyman said
the new system w ill he "costly, burden
some to institutions, students, and gov -
ernments, and administratively un
workable."
The INS simplified its procedure tor
issuing student visas in January 197 L >.
Since that time, foreign students have
been able to obtain visas for the entire
duration of their studies instead of hav -
ing to renew them annually as they had
to under the old system to which the
INS has proposed to return.
Some critics believe some foreign
students have abused the currcnt sys
tem. however.
"If the duration of status system has
been abused in some particulars, then
the abuses should he identified and re
medied. Lyman said. "To eliminate a
workable and sensible system in order
to return to one which has already
failed is hard to justify or understand."
he wrote.

"I urge you to delay putting the new
regulations into effect until more
thought, in collaboration with know
ledgeable persons in education, can be
devoted to the subject."
Foreign student adviser Mitchell
Hall estimated that only 12 ol the N6
Iranian students here would be able to
complete their studies it the change is
put into effect this summer. Under the
current administration policy of not
granting Iranian students visa exten
sions, about half of them would be able
to stay until they finish their education.
According to Lee /eigler. director ot
Bechtel International Center, all of the
more than 200,000 foreign students
nationwide would have to undergo an
interview with the INS it the new regu
lations go into effect.
While executive orders are not sub
ject to public input, regular rule
changes are posted tor 60 days in the
Federal Register, according to /eigler
who expects a good deal ot reaction
from universities around the countrv.
Last month, leaders of the American
Council on Education and live other
national organizations wrote to /'resi
dent Jimmy Carter that "these students
and many who have returned to Iran
constitute an important influence to
ward moderation in Iranian affairs and
might eventually be an important force
for reconciliation between our two na
tions.
"We must not punish indi\ iduals for
the crimes of their countrymen simply
because they represent an accessible
target. We strongly believe our role
should be to assist Iranian students to
remain members of our academic
communities," the letter continued.
Those Iranians who have had hear
ings before immigration judges and re
ceived orders to leave the country
within I 5 days have been gi\ en no con
sideration for extensions of their stay
for academic reasons. One student who
will complete his bachelor's degree this
June was ordered to leave by mid-May.
He is appealing his case.
