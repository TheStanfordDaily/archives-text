# Parking fee hike recommended
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
To combat a projected deficit of $80,000 to $ 100,000 for
the 1980-8 1 academic year, the Committee on Parking and
Transportation (C-PT) has recommended a raise in next
year's parking fees.
The recommendation will be presented to President
Richard Lyman for approval next month.
If the raise is approved, "C" permits — currently $15 —
will be raised to $20, and "A" permits will be upped 50
percent, from $50 to $75.
This would be the first increase in parking permit fees in
three years. In fact, permit prices actually went down this
year for "A" permits, from last year's $60 price.
The recommendation was made because of inflationary
rises in costs and increases associated with the Marguerite
shuttle service, said Robert Hamrdla, chairman of the
nine-person C-PT. The Marguerite, which currently oper
ates on a budget of about $340,000, is entirely supported
from the revenue raised by parking permits.
Even if the optimistic projections of the Department of
Safety come true and $500,000 worth of permits are sold,
rising fuel costs and wage increases tor Marguerite
operators make likely a high deficit for next year.
Surplus
"Fortunately, this deficit can be covered by a surplus built
up over past years," states a release from the C-PT. "1 low
ever, tbe committee will be faced with further increases in
I 98 1 -82 or a reduction in shuttle service to bring the budget
into balance."
Because of what I lamrdla called an "unsound accounting
system" in the past several years, the committee discovered
last year that it possessed about $1 50,000 in surplus, and so
permit prices this year were lowered.
However, Hamrdla predicted that at the end of this
academic year, the Parking and Transportation Fund will
actually be in a deficit position.
Decrease in number
There has been some decrease in the number of permits
sold and that trend is expected to continue because of the
higher prices of automobiles and gasoline. A survey this
year found an overall decline in traffic around the campus,

and an increase in the number of illegal parkers, Uamrdla
said.
"Hut if you beef up the law enforcement for the illegally
parked cars, your costs go up again." he added.
One dilemma is that if costs continue to rise at a high rate,
the Marguerite service may eventually have to be canceled
altogether, especially considering its low ridership.
"We are really going to have to ask some basic questions
about whether or not it's worth it to keep the Marguerite,"
he said.
Hamdrla agreed that discontinuing the Marguerite ser
vice would in a sense constitute punishing those who opt for
the more environmentally preferable mode of transporta
tion.
Other options
Other options besides dropping the service may include
charging a fee to ride the shuttle buses, reducing the number
of runs made per day. or switching to a more energy
efficient type of vehicle than the ones currently being used.
Uamrdla said the committee is looking into the possibility
of having engineering students here attempt to design some
new kind of vehicle.
Finally, Uamrdla stressed that students are neither the
main cause nor victims of the situation.
"Nearly every faculty and staff person drives a car. and
nowhere near that number ot students drive cars. Also, on
any given day.the ridership of the Marguerite is rarely more
thyn half students."
Currently the University's parking system allows for a
$15 residence permit to allow parking in lots adjoining
student residences by residents only. A "C" permit allows
parking only in lots labeled "C." while an "A" permit, the
most expensive, allows for parking in both "A" and "C"
lots.
Visitor parking
The committee will also look at other parking and trans
portation problems next year, including visitor parking.
"You have all kinds of visitors coming into the University
and it's notoriously hard for them to find a place to park,"
he said. "Both VIP guests — friends ot the University —
and people who just want to come and take a look at the
campus have trouble parking."

student residences by residents only. A "C" permit allows
parking only in lots labeled "C." while an "A" permit, the
most expensive, allows for parking in both "A" and "C"
lots.
Visitor parking
The committee will also look at other parking and trans
portation problems next year, including visitor parking.
"You have all kinds of visitors coming into the University
and it's notoriously hard for them to find a place to park,"
he said. "Both VIP guests — friends ot the University —
and people who just want to come and take a look at the
campus have trouble parking."
To combat a projected deficit of $80,000 to $ 100,000 for
the 1980-8 1 academic year, the Committee on Parking and
Transportation (C-PT) has recommended a raise in next
year's parking fees.
The recommendation will be presented to President
Richard Lyman for approval next month.
If the raise is approved, "C" permits — currently $15 —
will be raised to $20, and "A" permits will be upped 50
percent, from $50 to $75.
This would be the first increase in parking permit fees in
three years. In fact, permit prices actually went down this
year for "A" permits, from last year's $60 price.
The recommendation was made because of inflationary
rises in costs and increases associated with the Marguerite
shuttle service, said Robert Hamrdla, chairman of the
nine-person C-PT. The Marguerite, which currently oper
ates on a budget of about $340,000, is entirely supported
from the revenue raised by parking permits.
Even if the optimistic projections of the Department of
Safety come true and $500,000 worth of permits are sold,
rising fuel costs and wage increases tor Marguerite
operators make likely a high deficit for next year.
Surplus
"Fortunately, this deficit can be covered by a surplus built
up over past years," states a release from the C-PT. "1 low
ever, tbe committee will be faced with further increases in
I 98 1 -82 or a reduction in shuttle service to bring the budget
into balance."
Because of what I lamrdla called an "unsound accounting
system" in the past several years, the committee discovered
last year that it possessed about $1 50,000 in surplus, and so
permit prices this year were lowered.
However, Hamrdla predicted that at the end of this
academic year, the Parking and Transportation Fund will
actually be in a deficit position.
Decrease in number
There has been some decrease in the number of permits
sold and that trend is expected to continue because of the
higher prices of automobiles and gasoline. A survey this
year found an overall decline in traffic around the campus,

and an increase in the number of illegal parkers, Uamrdla
said.
"Hut if you beef up the law enforcement for the illegally
parked cars, your costs go up again." he added.
One dilemma is that if costs continue to rise at a high rate,
the Marguerite service may eventually have to be canceled
altogether, especially considering its low ridership.
"We are really going to have to ask some basic questions
about whether or not it's worth it to keep the Marguerite,"
he said.
Hamdrla agreed that discontinuing the Marguerite ser
vice would in a sense constitute punishing those who opt for
the more environmentally preferable mode of transporta
tion.
Other options
Other options besides dropping the service may include
charging a fee to ride the shuttle buses, reducing the number
of runs made per day. or switching to a more energy
efficient type of vehicle than the ones currently being used.
Uamrdla said the committee is looking into the possibility
of having engineering students here attempt to design some
new kind of vehicle.
Finally, Uamrdla stressed that students are neither the
main cause nor victims of the situation.
"Nearly every faculty and staff person drives a car. and
nowhere near that number ot students drive cars. Also, on
any given day.the ridership of the Marguerite is rarely more
thyn half students."
Currently the University's parking system allows for a
$15 residence permit to allow parking in lots adjoining
student residences by residents only. A "C" permit allows
parking only in lots labeled "C." while an "A" permit, the
most expensive, allows for parking in both "A" and "C"
lots.
