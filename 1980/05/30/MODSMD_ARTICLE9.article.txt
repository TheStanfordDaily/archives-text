## Chinese tell of economic frustrations 
### Jay Mathews The Washington Post 
PEKING — "People are fed
up with this talk that capitalism is
interior to socialism. I think the
two systems must be treated like
two kinds of food in two bowls.
Let the people taste both and de
cide for themselves which one
tastes better."
These words are from the
diary of a 28-year-old Peking
factory worker, made available
by him on the condition that his
name not be used. The language
is often rough and inconsistent,
but the doubts about the Chinese
communist system are heard at
some point in nearly every pri
vate conversation with young
Chinese these days!
"1 want a few dollars' raise?
Maybe, but they'll torture vou

112 rst with all the meetings, discus
sions. study sessions . . . Ah, it's
frustrating! The capitalists in the
old society were good at exploit
ing people, but the Communist
Party is even more crafty."
The worker's diary reflects a
classic generation gap between
the aged revolutionaries who re
scued China front famine, civil
war and terrible suffering 30
years ago, and their grandchil
dren. who cannot appreciate the
changes and do not find their
current lives satisfying. In a
major speech at a youth confer
ence this month, one of the aged
leaders. Vice Premier Wang Re
n/hong, pleaded with youth to
reject ' unhealthy things from
abroad and stick with communist
ideals."
A brief look at the life of one

young C hinese, complete with
inconsistencies, rumors and
petty angers, shows the message
has difficulty getting through.
Sunday: "After work at 2
p.m., I went window shopping
with a few friends to the Peking
Department Store. Our eyes
were caught by a huge crowd of
people milling in front of a dis
play window at the left side of the
building. I squeezed myself in
and found out that they were all
looking at the advertising display
ot Sanyo Corp. (a Japanese elec
tronics firm). The window was
tull of modern household electri
cal appliances, and all the
Chinese beside me were raving
about them.
"Japan achieved such speedy
economic development in the 30
vears since the war. China had

the s:imi 30 years, yet it is far
behind. Newspapers sing praises
ot socialism and damn
capitalism, but this is the best
proof.
"You go in the department
store and walk up to where they
sell cassette recorders and find
out that the sets are imported
from Japan and that the cheapest
costs about $667.1 get a monthly
salary of $27. If 1 want to buy a
cassette recorder. I'll have to
save up all my salary for three
years — that is, no food, no
drinks . . . How can you expect
me to have the urge to work for
the four modernizations (a plan
for Chinese economic growth)?
A good pair of leather shoes
costs $23 — are these the be
nefits of socialism?
Monday: "Recently there's
been a short supply of vegetables
in the market, so ordinary
Chinese frequently don't get to
eat vegetables anymore. The
huge Peking Chongwen vegeta
ble market had only one variety,
garlic shoots, to sell.
"One has to line up for more
than two hours just to be able to
buy some vegetables. They re
fused to sell more than two small
bundles of spinach per customer.
The Chinese hardly get any nut
rition from what they eat. They
care only about stuffing their
stomachs full.
"You're lucky enough if
there's somebody in the family
who could line up. If both hus
band and wife are working, leav
ing early in the morning and
coming back late at night, then
you just don't expect anything to
eat. You just bear the hunger.
What is even more infuriating is
that at the time of scarcity, some
of the grocery stores are arbitrar
ily raising the prices of vegeta
bles. They pass off low-quality
vegetables as good ones."
Tuesday: "Felt very bored
after work today, so I decided to
watch a movie. 1 made the
rounds of the movie houses and
ended up not watching any.
There are a few newly-released
movies now showing, but they're
lousy so people don't want to see
them . . . Television is even
worse. Culture is not suited to
people's wishes, but to the needs

of propaganda. During the reign
of the Gang of Four (a radical
faction that opposed China's
modernization policies), the
single scenario you saw on the
screen was the gang struggling
against veteran cadres; now the
roles are simply reversed.
' "It is such a hassle to watch a
movie you like. People literally
fight over tickets for movies
shown 'internally' (not shown
publicly but by arrangement with
work places)."
Friday: "Got up at 5 a.m. Dis
cussion on salary readjustment
reached its 10th day. We were
told that only 40 percent of the
factory population will be enti
tled to raises. The past few days,
people in my factory have been
engaged in heated arguments
over who among us should get
the pay 'raise. Although a one
step promotion means only a few
more dollars, it's what we ordi
nary Chinese hunger for.
"I'm both a technician and a
junior administrator. I've been
working for nine years. The crux
of the matter is, the government
won't let me earn what I de
serve."
Saturday: "I went around to
different workshops to inspect
the job of transporting some
machines. I also chatted with
some workers . . . about the sal
ary readjustment plan. The
majority of the workers say they
are extremely dissatisfied with
the leadership, because they
have appropriated for them
selves the 40 percent quota. All
the bureaucrats and some fre
quent toadies will get the promo
tion.
"Small wonder that a section
of the workers just lie down on
the job, either reading newspap
ers or chatting. The machines are
antiquated and noisy. The work
shop is just a messy sight.
"And what about those
bureaucrats? The rumor is that
Ye Jianying (the second-ranking
party leader) doles out $66,677
for his birthday parties in
Guangzhou. It is best that the
people in the Communist Party
make the first move in making
selt-eritieism. That's what we call
socialist equality."
