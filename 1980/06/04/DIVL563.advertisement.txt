Dear Graduating Seniors:
Many thanks to those of you who have
completed the 1980 Senior Survey. In our
continuing effort to improve Stanford's
undergraduate program, your views are
most important and will Pe taken seriously.
If you have not yet returned the survey,
please do so nowâ€”it is not too late. If
you have lost the questionnaire come by
Undergraduate Studies, Bldg 1, Room 28,
or call 497-0837.
With best wishes,
Donald Kennedy Herant Katchadourian
Vice President Vice Provost and
and Provost Dean of Undergraduate
Studies
