# Alumni Assoc. awaits grads with open arms

### 
Now that you've joined the il
lustrious ranks of the many fam
ous. infamous and otherwise un
known Stanford alumni ... so
what?
It may come as a surprise, but
someone besides your family,
your friends and you yourself has
noted the significance of your
graduation: the Stanford Alumni
Association.
The Alumni Association
shares the name of the institution
that in the name of education has
taken your money for the past
four years, but it is independent.
"We're in business as an inde
pendent association to provide
service." said William Stone, di
rector of the association.
Since he trekked across the
Quad three years ago from his
position as assistant to President
Richard Lyman. Stone has made
one of his main goals an increase
in the involvement of young
alumni in the association.
About 400 undergraduates

now are members, thanks largely
to the association's sly dealings
with parents. "We send publica
tions to students' homes and
even occasionally let parents
join. We overlook their lack of
judgment in not coming here
themselves," Stone said.
"1 told the freshmen parents
that their students won't write
them, so we will."
This past year, the association
worked closely with senior class
activities, sponsored Stanford
in-Government, provided desti
tute students with counselor jobs
at its Sierra Camp and hosted
Class Day activities.
Through the Alumni Contact
Serv icc, the association helped
students learn more about life in
the real world, putting them in
touch with professionals in six
different geographical areas —
including more than 1000
alumni in the Bay area alone.
One of your classmates re
ceived from the association the
.I.E. Wallace Sterling award for
leadership, and one of your
senior class presidents. Gray
Boyce, served on the associa
tion's Alumni Executive Board.
After missing out on all these
activities, you may wonder why
you should be interested in the
Alumni Association now. If so,
Stone has a simple answer:
membership is "a good way to
stay in touch" with the Univer
sity. "If something you want
comes up, you can take advan
tage of it."
And to dispel one common
stereotype, Stone declared,
"We're not just a martini weenie
outfit. We don't just hold tailgat
ers and cocktail parties."
What, exactly, does the as
sociation do? For family recrea
tion, it operates the popular re
treat at the Sierra Camp and the
Alpine Meadows Ski Chalet. Its
affiliated local clubs sponsor a
variety of educational and recre
ational activities, including raft
trips and art appreciation classes

hosts the Campus Conference
for approximately 1600 alumni,
and during the summer, it offers
six continuing education courses,
ranging from two days to three
weeks in length.

to name just a few.
The association also commis
sions faculty scholars to write for
The Stanford Magazine, which
publishes "pop scholarship"
twice annually, and three to four
editions of its Portable Stanford
series per year.
Both publications enable
alumni to keep up with the
academic discovery and research
here. Stone said. The Portable

Stanford, which Stone described
as "unique," captivates about
11,000 subscribers at $5.60 an
issue with topics such as
economics, stress management,
poetry and birth control.
About 250 faculty members
work for the association in some
capacity each year. "We're very
much into Stanford and the
community, although technically
separate," Stone said. The Uni

versity owns the association
building and land, he continued,
but the 50,000-member associa
tion itself is legally detached
from the University.
Only 20 percent of all
private-college alumni organiza
tions are independently based.
Stone said that independence al
lows the association to benefit
from added flexibility while at
the same time indirectly con
tributing to Stanford's financial
welfare.
Robert Rosen/weig, vice pres
ident for public affairs and the
University's representative on
the executive board, said that the
association "does not engage in
fund-raising" for explicit and
long-standing reasons.
The association can "serve the
University best by not asking for

money," he said. "The job is to
provide services and to keep
people happy."
But that is not to say that the
University does not benefit from
the efforts of the association.
"There is a high correlation
between University gifts and in
volvement" in the association,
said David Fulton, communica
tions director in the Office of
Development. The association
"is a tremendous benefit to the
University and an organization
we're always worked very closely
with,"' he said. Rosenzweig
pointed out that people active in
the association "tend to fund
raise for the University. They're
not two separate groups of
people." He said that if the as
sociation did not exist, "We'd
have to invent it."
