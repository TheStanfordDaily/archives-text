# Alumni Assoc. awaits grads with open arms

### 
Now that you've joined the il
lustrious ranks of the many fam
ous. infamous and otherwise un
known Stanford alumni ... so
what?
It may come as a surprise, but
someone besides your family,
your friends and you yourself has
noted the significance of your
graduation: the Stanford Alumni
Association.
The Alumni Association
shares the name of the institution
that in the name of education has
taken your money for the past
four years, but it is independent.
"We're in business as an inde
pendent association to provide
service." said William Stone, di
rector of the association.
Since he trekked across the
Quad three years ago from his
position as assistant to President
Richard Lyman. Stone has made
one of his main goals an increase
in the involvement of young
alumni in the association.
About 400 undergraduates

now are members, thanks largely
to the association's sly dealings
with parents. "We send publica
tions to students' homes and
even occasionally let parents
join. We overlook their lack of
judgment in not coming here
themselves," Stone said.
"1 told the freshmen parents
that their students won't write
them, so we will."
This past year, the association
worked closely with senior class
activities, sponsored Stanford
in-Government, provided desti
tute students with counselor jobs
at its Sierra Camp and hosted
Class Day activities.
Through the Alumni Contact
Serv icc, the association helped
students learn more about life in
the real world, putting them in
touch with professionals in six
different geographical areas —
including more than 1000
alumni in the Bay area alone.
One of your classmates re
ceived from the association the
.I.E. Wallace Sterling award for
leadership, and one of your
senior class presidents. Gray
Boyce, served on the associa
tion's Alumni Executive Board.
After missing out on all these
activities, you may wonder why
you should be interested in the
Alumni Association now. If so,
Stone has a simple answer:
membership is "a good way to
stay in touch" with the Univer
sity. "If something you want
comes up, you can take advan
tage of it."
And to dispel one common
stereotype, Stone declared,
"We're not just a martini weenie
outfit. We don't just hold tailgat
ers and cocktail parties."
What, exactly, does the as
sociation do? For family recrea
tion, it operates the popular re
treat at the Sierra Camp and the
Alpine Meadows Ski Chalet. Its
affiliated local clubs sponsor a
variety of educational and recre
ational activities, including raft
trips and art appreciation classes
Each spring, the association
