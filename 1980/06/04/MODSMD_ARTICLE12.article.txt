# Past commencements reflect changing times

At least once a year, the out
side world comes to "The
Farm," as families, friends and
other guests gather for com
mencement exercises.
In the University's earlier
years, the mood was cheery, in
nocent and hopeful. In 1901, for
example, the biggest concern of
commencement week seemed to
be keeping the electric lights
going until 2:30 a.m. "so there
will be no possibility of complet
ing the entire program" of the
social event of the week. Senior
Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places and
G.M. Richardson gave graduates
a few words on "The Gospel of
Work."
The class of '06, knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere

mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.

President Herbert Hoover
took time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Bill which lies on
his desk, the ardent pleas of pro
hibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River,"
he wired "cordial greetings and
warm congratulations to the
graduating Seniors at Stanford
University and my best wishes
tor a life of active service upon
which they now embark."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future," according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall

unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as we
now experience."
During the war and after,"it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism
shown by the other "war class,"
the Class of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one made
in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a John Day Mil
ler, executive of A. Schilling Co.,
importers of spices and coffee in

San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935, two units short of the
1 HO required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely affect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned
that he needed a college degree
to qualify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate, Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a un
ique graduation present — the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's life in
the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regu
lations, was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Uni
versity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch, vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look
— and not let the 1942 scene
blind us to the fact that there will
bea world after 1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war.
"And unless those who are not
summoned to the immediate
service of our nation devote
themselves to their training," he
said, "we may enter the postwar
era a generation taught but one
thing — war."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
Cold War, the Korean war . . .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived

at commencement exercises in
an academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize.)
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970, some 300 of the 1500
graduating chose not to rent caps
and gowns forcommencement to
show their opposition to the Vie
tnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of the 1600 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $5 to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided

ceremonies were held in the stadium.
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser Support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to Frost Ampitheater,
they made no effort to enter.
There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University
had banned carrying signs or
banners into the ceremonies, but
one graduate wore a peace sym
bol on his cap.
The ceremonies went
smoothly and some newspapers
referred to 1971 as the year of
"return to tradition," or the year
in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the University
had not been left untouched by
the changing times. Noting that it
is customary for the University
president to wish the departing
graduates well, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the
roles ought not to be reversed,
whether it ought not to be the
departing graduates who wish
the University well." His remark
drew laughter and applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
" Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore
the more dissent the better," he
said. "It is an eternal error to
believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class,
Sev areid expressed doubts about
the United States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are
learning that America's reach in
the world has exceeded its grasp;
that we can really give little to
other societies that they can
take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some
that there was at least one thing
the United States could give to
other countries — the technol
ogy and materials necessary for
nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions, warned listeners that "the
spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of
planet-wide "nuclear disaster."

The possibility of an atomic
holocaust "does not at this point
arise primarily from the quest for
weapons development, but
rather as a bi-product of the in
nocent but urgent quest for
energy," Moynihan explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to
separate the production of
energy from the proliferation of
weapons."
Not all the seniors participat
ing in commencement were
around to heed Moynihan's
warning: approximately 175 of
2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when
Moynihan was introduced and
returned when his speech was
over.
The walkout was the culmina
tion of that controversy which
had attended the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker from the moment it was
announced.
A statement signed by "The
Black Graduating Students"
explained the aim of the protes
ters was not to "disrupt Moyni
han's right to free speech" but to
attention to the sort oi sub
tle racism exemplified in Moyni
han's 1969 report on the Negro
family.
In that report, Moynihan at
tributed the inferior social and
economic station of blacks to
what he saw as a disintegration of
the Negro family.
The protesters' act "drew,
cheers from some .. . boos from
a few and stony silence from
most," commented one ob
server. When one woman in
sisted in applauding for the pro
testers, Moynihan told her to
"please show the same courtesy
as those departing arc showing."
He went on to deliver his
speech to the slightly depleted
audience, ending on a hopeful
note. Nuclear arms control, he
said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those
employed by the armaments in
dustry of the world. It is some
thing the graduates of 1975 may
wish to think about."
In 1977, John Hope Franklin,
an historian from the University
of Chicago, delivered something
of a retort to Moynihan's racial
views. Blasting the American
school system, Franklin said that
the "long, nightmarish fight" to
achieve educational equality had
yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is
mediocre or worse."
He blamed this on public re
luctance to break socio
economic barriers and to correct
uneven distribution of funds.
This allows the "few schools that
are good to remain good, while
the many that are poor remain
poor."
Franklin urged his audience to
fight the nation's educational in
equalities. "Racial and ethnic
discrimination in the United
States deserves your attention.
Who in the world would believe
that the richest nation in the
world — a country known for its
generosity — would be unable
to find money to educate the
children?" he said.
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily."
One year later, Donald Ken
nedy, then the Food and Drug
Comissioner on leave from the
University and since returned as
provost, criticized the "contem
porary loss of faith in govern
ment."
According to Kennedy, more
and more sectors of the public
wrongly believed that the gov
ernment was trying to gain more
control over their lives. The pur
pose of that belief, he said is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a les
sened need for its services.
"The new conservatives would
have you believe" that a reduc
tion of government activity "sig
nifies only the end of uncons
cionable intervention," while"in
reality it would mean the death
of an important concept of social
justice.
"In that concept, regulations
play a social role: it protects or
dinary people against the ad
verse consequences of private
monopoly power."
Kennedy conceded that reg
ulators have "overreached*
themselves in the past, but he ar
gued that "we have a mechanism
for redressing these errors.'' He
warned against the "all-out ef
fort" currently being made to
"convince Americans that be
cause no accurate line can be
drawn" between proper and im
proper regulation, "none should
be drawn at all."
The administ' itoi v h ioes

less than he should out of a fear
of anti-regulatory fervor may
spare himself from future con
troversy. Kennedy said. At the
same time, however, this will
"cost the system its chance of
self-correction and withhold
from the people their voice in
deciding how much government
they want."
Last year, the commencement
speaker focused on America's
interests overseas. Andrew
Young, speaking just a month
before he resigned his seat as
Ambassador to the United Na
tions, told the graduating stu
dents that they should help to
break down the barriers to world
communication and trade.
Americans should see the re
volutions in Third World coun
tries as outgrowths of the Ameri
can revolution. Young said.
"The high ideals and expecta
tions of these nations are reach
ing in the direction of human
rights and freedom," he said.
Because these principles reach
their highest development in this
country, "the people of the
world will come to your
doorsteps and mine, trying to
find ways to give order and
sense" to the world.
The graduating students.
Young continued, must there
fore help to "build understand
ing relationships that enable us
to cooperate on a worldwide
basis."
An ordained minister of the
Unitarian Church, a close as
sociate of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Georgia's
first black congressman in 101
years. Young had angered
people during his U.N. tenure
with his candid appraisals of in
ternational affairs.
At Commencement, however,
Young made it clear that his view
of foreign affairs stems from his
belief in American ideals. Quot
ing from"America the Beauti
ful." sung at the beginning of the
exercises, Young declared:
"The crowning good must be
extended across the seas to those
who look for the same level of
freedom" attained by Ameri
cans. Then, he said, the people of
the Third World "may reach the
same level of commencement we
reach today."

nocent and hopeful. In 1901, for
example, the biggest concern of
commencement week seemed to
be keeping the electric lights
going until 2:30 a.m. "so there
will be no possibility of complet
ing the entire program" of the
social event of the week. Senior
Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places and
G.M. Richardson gave graduates
a few words on "The Gospel of
Work."
The class of '06, knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere

mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.

Frost Amphitheater at the beginning of the 1937 exercises.
President Herbert Hoover
took time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Bill which lies on
his desk, the ardent pleas of pro
hibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River,"
he wired "cordial greetings and
warm congratulations to the
graduating Seniors at Stanford
University and my best wishes
tor a life of active service upon
which they now embark."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future," according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall

unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as we
now experience."
During the war and after,"it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism
shown by the other "war class,"
the Class of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one made
in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a John Day Mil
ler, executive of A. Schilling Co.,
importers of spices and coffee in

San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935, two units short of the
1 HO required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely affect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned
that he needed a college degree
to qualify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate, Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a un
ique graduation present — the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's life in
the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regu
lations, was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Uni
versity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch, vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look
— and not let the 1942 scene
blind us to the fact that there will
bea world after 1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war.
"And unless those who are not
summoned to the immediate
service of our nation devote
themselves to their training," he
said, "we may enter the postwar
era a generation taught but one
thing — war."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
Cold War, the Korean war . . .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived

at commencement exercises in
an academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize.)
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970, some 300 of the 1500
graduating chose not to rent caps
and gowns forcommencement to
show their opposition to the Vie
tnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of the 1600 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $5 to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided

ceremonies were held in the stadium.
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser Support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to Frost Ampitheater,
they made no effort to enter.
There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University
had banned carrying signs or
banners into the ceremonies, but
one graduate wore a peace sym
bol on his cap.
The ceremonies went
smoothly and some newspapers
referred to 1971 as the year of
"return to tradition," or the year
in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the University
had not been left untouched by
the changing times. Noting that it
is customary for the University
president to wish the departing
graduates well, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the
roles ought not to be reversed,
whether it ought not to be the
departing graduates who wish
the University well." His remark
drew laughter and applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
" Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore
the more dissent the better," he
said. "It is an eternal error to
believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class,
Sev areid expressed doubts about
the United States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are
learning that America's reach in
the world has exceeded its grasp;
that we can really give little to
other societies that they can
take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some
that there was at least one thing
the United States could give to
other countries — the technol
ogy and materials necessary for
nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions, warned listeners that "the
spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of
planet-wide "nuclear disaster."

The possibility of an atomic
holocaust "does not at this point
arise primarily from the quest for
weapons development, but
rather as a bi-product of the in
nocent but urgent quest for
energy," Moynihan explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to
separate the production of
energy from the proliferation of
weapons."
Not all the seniors participat
ing in commencement were
around to heed Moynihan's
warning: approximately 175 of
2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when
Moynihan was introduced and
returned when his speech was
over.
The walkout was the culmina
tion of that controversy which
had attended the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker from the moment it was
announced.
A statement signed by "The
Black Graduating Students"
explained the aim of the protes
ters was not to "disrupt Moyni
han's right to free speech" but to
attention to the sort oi sub
tle racism exemplified in Moyni
han's 1969 report on the Negro
family.
In that report, Moynihan at
tributed the inferior social and
economic station of blacks to
what he saw as a disintegration of
the Negro family.
The protesters' act "drew,
cheers from some .. . boos from
a few and stony silence from
most," commented one ob
server. When one woman in
sisted in applauding for the pro
testers, Moynihan told her to
"please show the same courtesy
as those departing arc showing."
He went on to deliver his
speech to the slightly depleted
audience, ending on a hopeful
note. Nuclear arms control, he
said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those
employed by the armaments in
dustry of the world. It is some
thing the graduates of 1975 may
wish to think about."
In 1977, John Hope Franklin,
an historian from the University
of Chicago, delivered something
of a retort to Moynihan's racial
views. Blasting the American
school system, Franklin said that
the "long, nightmarish fight" to
achieve educational equality had
yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is
mediocre or worse."
He blamed this on public re
luctance to break socio
economic barriers and to correct
uneven distribution of funds.
This allows the "few schools that
are good to remain good, while
the many that are poor remain
poor."
Franklin urged his audience to
fight the nation's educational in
equalities. "Racial and ethnic
discrimination in the United
States deserves your attention.
Who in the world would believe
that the richest nation in the
world — a country known for its
generosity — would be unable
to find money to educate the
children?" he said.
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily."
One year later, Donald Ken
nedy, then the Food and Drug
Comissioner on leave from the
University and since returned as
provost, criticized the "contem
porary loss of faith in govern
ment."
According to Kennedy, more
and more sectors of the public
wrongly believed that the gov
ernment was trying to gain more
control over their lives. The pur
pose of that belief, he said is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a les
sened need for its services.
"The new conservatives would
have you believe" that a reduc
tion of government activity "sig
nifies only the end of uncons
cionable intervention," while"in
reality it would mean the death
of an important concept of social
justice.
"In that concept, regulations
play a social role: it protects or
dinary people against the ad
verse consequences of private
monopoly power."
Kennedy conceded that reg
ulators have "overreached*
themselves in the past, but he ar
gued that "we have a mechanism
for redressing these errors.'' He
warned against the "all-out ef
fort" currently being made to
"convince Americans that be
cause no accurate line can be
drawn" between proper and im
proper regulation, "none should
be drawn at all."
The administ' itoi v h ioes

less than he should out of a fear
of anti-regulatory fervor may
spare himself from future con
troversy. Kennedy said. At the
same time, however, this will
"cost the system its chance of
self-correction and withhold
from the people their voice in
deciding how much government
they want."
Last year, the commencement
speaker focused on America's
interests overseas. Andrew
Young, speaking just a month
before he resigned his seat as
Ambassador to the United Na
tions, told the graduating stu
dents that they should help to
break down the barriers to world
communication and trade.
Americans should see the re
volutions in Third World coun
tries as outgrowths of the Ameri
can revolution. Young said.
"The high ideals and expecta
tions of these nations are reach
ing in the direction of human
rights and freedom," he said.
Because these principles reach
their highest development in this
country, "the people of the
world will come to your
doorsteps and mine, trying to
find ways to give order and
sense" to the world.
The graduating students.
Young continued, must there
fore help to "build understand
ing relationships that enable us
to cooperate on a worldwide
basis."
An ordained minister of the
Unitarian Church, a close as
sociate of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Georgia's
first black congressman in 101
years. Young had angered
people during his U.N. tenure
with his candid appraisals of in
ternational affairs.
At Commencement, however,
Young made it clear that his view
of foreign affairs stems from his
belief in American ideals. Quot
ing from"America the Beauti
ful." sung at the beginning of the
exercises, Young declared:
"The crowning good must be
extended across the seas to those
who look for the same level of
freedom" attained by Ameri
cans. Then, he said, the people of
the Third World "may reach the
same level of commencement we
reach today."

Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places and
G.M. Richardson gave graduates
a few words on "The Gospel of
Work."
The class of '06, knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere

mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.

President Herbert Hoover
took time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Bill which lies on
his desk, the ardent pleas of pro
hibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River,"
he wired "cordial greetings and
warm congratulations to the
graduating Seniors at Stanford
University and my best wishes
tor a life of active service upon
which they now embark."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future," according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall

unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as we
now experience."
During the war and after,"it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism
shown by the other "war class,"
the Class of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one made
in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a John Day Mil
ler, executive of A. Schilling Co.,
importers of spices and coffee in

San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935, two units short of the
1 HO required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely affect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned
that he needed a college degree
to qualify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate, Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a un
ique graduation present — the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's life in
the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regu
lations, was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Uni
versity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch, vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look
— and not let the 1942 scene
blind us to the fact that there will
bea world after 1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war.
"And unless those who are not
summoned to the immediate
service of our nation devote
themselves to their training," he
said, "we may enter the postwar
era a generation taught but one
thing — war."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
Cold War, the Korean war . . .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived

at commencement exercises in
an academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize.)
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970, some 300 of the 1500
graduating chose not to rent caps
and gowns forcommencement to
show their opposition to the Vie
tnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of the 1600 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $5 to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided

ceremonies were held in the stadium.
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser Support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to Frost Ampitheater,
they made no effort to enter.
There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University
had banned carrying signs or
banners into the ceremonies, but
one graduate wore a peace sym
bol on his cap.
The ceremonies went
smoothly and some newspapers
referred to 1971 as the year of
"return to tradition," or the year
in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the University
had not been left untouched by
the changing times. Noting that it
is customary for the University
president to wish the departing
graduates well, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the
roles ought not to be reversed,
whether it ought not to be the
departing graduates who wish
the University well." His remark
drew laughter and applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
" Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore
the more dissent the better," he
said. "It is an eternal error to
believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class,
Sev areid expressed doubts about
the United States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are
learning that America's reach in
the world has exceeded its grasp;
that we can really give little to
other societies that they can
take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some
that there was at least one thing
the United States could give to
other countries — the technol
ogy and materials necessary for
nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions, warned listeners that "the
spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of
planet-wide "nuclear disaster."

The possibility of an atomic
holocaust "does not at this point
arise primarily from the quest for
weapons development, but
rather as a bi-product of the in
nocent but urgent quest for
energy," Moynihan explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to
separate the production of
energy from the proliferation of
weapons."
Not all the seniors participat
ing in commencement were
around to heed Moynihan's
warning: approximately 175 of
2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when
Moynihan was introduced and
returned when his speech was
over.
The walkout was the culmina
tion of that controversy which
had attended the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker from the moment it was
announced.
A statement signed by "The
Black Graduating Students"
explained the aim of the protes
ters was not to "disrupt Moyni
han's right to free speech" but to
attention to the sort oi sub
tle racism exemplified in Moyni
han's 1969 report on the Negro
family.
In that report, Moynihan at
tributed the inferior social and
economic station of blacks to
what he saw as a disintegration of
the Negro family.
The protesters' act "drew,
cheers from some .. . boos from
a few and stony silence from
most," commented one ob
server. When one woman in
sisted in applauding for the pro
testers, Moynihan told her to
"please show the same courtesy
as those departing arc showing."
He went on to deliver his
speech to the slightly depleted
audience, ending on a hopeful
note. Nuclear arms control, he
said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those
employed by the armaments in
dustry of the world. It is some
thing the graduates of 1975 may
wish to think about."
In 1977, John Hope Franklin,
an historian from the University
of Chicago, delivered something
of a retort to Moynihan's racial
views. Blasting the American
school system, Franklin said that
the "long, nightmarish fight" to
achieve educational equality had
yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is
mediocre or worse."
He blamed this on public re
luctance to break socio
economic barriers and to correct
uneven distribution of funds.
This allows the "few schools that
are good to remain good, while
the many that are poor remain
poor."
Franklin urged his audience to
fight the nation's educational in
equalities. "Racial and ethnic
discrimination in the United
States deserves your attention.
Who in the world would believe
that the richest nation in the
world — a country known for its
generosity — would be unable
to find money to educate the
children?" he said.
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily."
One year later, Donald Ken
nedy, then the Food and Drug
Comissioner on leave from the
University and since returned as
provost, criticized the "contem
porary loss of faith in govern
ment."
According to Kennedy, more
and more sectors of the public
wrongly believed that the gov
ernment was trying to gain more
control over their lives. The pur
pose of that belief, he said is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a les
sened need for its services.
"The new conservatives would
have you believe" that a reduc
tion of government activity "sig
nifies only the end of uncons
cionable intervention," while"in
reality it would mean the death
of an important concept of social
justice.
"In that concept, regulations
play a social role: it protects or
dinary people against the ad
verse consequences of private
monopoly power."
Kennedy conceded that reg
ulators have "overreached*
themselves in the past, but he ar
gued that "we have a mechanism
for redressing these errors.'' He
warned against the "all-out ef
fort" currently being made to
"convince Americans that be
cause no accurate line can be
drawn" between proper and im
proper regulation, "none should
be drawn at all."
The administ' itoi v h ioes

less than he should out of a fear
of anti-regulatory fervor may
spare himself from future con
troversy. Kennedy said. At the
same time, however, this will
"cost the system its chance of
self-correction and withhold
from the people their voice in
deciding how much government
they want."
Last year, the commencement
speaker focused on America's
interests overseas. Andrew
Young, speaking just a month
before he resigned his seat as
Ambassador to the United Na
tions, told the graduating stu
dents that they should help to
break down the barriers to world
communication and trade.
Americans should see the re
volutions in Third World coun
tries as outgrowths of the Ameri
can revolution. Young said.
"The high ideals and expecta
tions of these nations are reach
ing in the direction of human
rights and freedom," he said.
Because these principles reach
their highest development in this
country, "the people of the
world will come to your
doorsteps and mine, trying to
find ways to give order and
sense" to the world.
The graduating students.
Young continued, must there
fore help to "build understand
ing relationships that enable us
to cooperate on a worldwide
basis."

sociate of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Georgia's
first black congressman in 101
years. Young had angered
people during his U.N. tenure
with his candid appraisals of in
ternational affairs.
At Commencement, however,
Young made it clear that his view
of foreign affairs stems from his
belief in American ideals. Quot
ing from"America the Beauti
ful." sung at the beginning of the
exercises, Young declared:
"The crowning good must be
extended across the seas to those
who look for the same level of
freedom" attained by Ameri
cans. Then, he said, the people of
the Third World "may reach the
same level of commencement we
reach today."

Work."
The class of '06, knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere

mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.

President Herbert Hoover
took time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Bill which lies on
his desk, the ardent pleas of pro
hibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River,"
he wired "cordial greetings and
warm congratulations to the
graduating Seniors at Stanford
University and my best wishes
tor a life of active service upon
which they now embark."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future," according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall

unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as we
now experience."
During the war and after,"it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism
shown by the other "war class,"
the Class of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one made
in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a John Day Mil
ler, executive of A. Schilling Co.,
importers of spices and coffee in

San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935, two units short of the
1 HO required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely affect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned
that he needed a college degree
to qualify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate, Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a un
ique graduation present — the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's life in
the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regu
lations, was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Uni
versity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch, vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look
— and not let the 1942 scene
blind us to the fact that there will
bea world after 1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war.
"And unless those who are not
summoned to the immediate
service of our nation devote
themselves to their training," he
said, "we may enter the postwar
era a generation taught but one
thing — war."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
Cold War, the Korean war . . .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived

at commencement exercises in
an academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize.)
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970, some 300 of the 1500
graduating chose not to rent caps
and gowns forcommencement to
show their opposition to the Vie
tnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of the 1600 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $5 to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided

ceremonies were held in the stadium.
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser Support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to Frost Ampitheater,
they made no effort to enter.
There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University
had banned carrying signs or
banners into the ceremonies, but
one graduate wore a peace sym
bol on his cap.
The ceremonies went
smoothly and some newspapers
referred to 1971 as the year of
"return to tradition," or the year
in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the University
had not been left untouched by
the changing times. Noting that it
is customary for the University
president to wish the departing
graduates well, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the
roles ought not to be reversed,
whether it ought not to be the
departing graduates who wish
the University well." His remark
drew laughter and applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
" Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore
the more dissent the better," he
said. "It is an eternal error to
believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class,
Sev areid expressed doubts about
the United States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are
learning that America's reach in
the world has exceeded its grasp;
that we can really give little to
other societies that they can
take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some
that there was at least one thing
the United States could give to
other countries — the technol
ogy and materials necessary for
nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions, warned listeners that "the
spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of
planet-wide "nuclear disaster."

The possibility of an atomic
holocaust "does not at this point
arise primarily from the quest for
weapons development, but
rather as a bi-product of the in
nocent but urgent quest for
energy," Moynihan explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to
separate the production of
energy from the proliferation of
weapons."
Not all the seniors participat
ing in commencement were
around to heed Moynihan's
warning: approximately 175 of
2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when
Moynihan was introduced and
returned when his speech was
over.
The walkout was the culmina
tion of that controversy which
had attended the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker from the moment it was
announced.
A statement signed by "The
Black Graduating Students"
explained the aim of the protes
ters was not to "disrupt Moyni
han's right to free speech" but to
attention to the sort oi sub
tle racism exemplified in Moyni
han's 1969 report on the Negro
family.
In that report, Moynihan at
tributed the inferior social and
economic station of blacks to
what he saw as a disintegration of
the Negro family.
The protesters' act "drew,
cheers from some .. . boos from
a few and stony silence from
most," commented one ob
server. When one woman in
sisted in applauding for the pro
testers, Moynihan told her to
"please show the same courtesy
as those departing arc showing."
He went on to deliver his
speech to the slightly depleted
audience, ending on a hopeful
note. Nuclear arms control, he
said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those
employed by the armaments in
dustry of the world. It is some
thing the graduates of 1975 may
wish to think about."
In 1977, John Hope Franklin,
an historian from the University
of Chicago, delivered something
of a retort to Moynihan's racial
views. Blasting the American
school system, Franklin said that
the "long, nightmarish fight" to
achieve educational equality had
yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is
mediocre or worse."
He blamed this on public re
luctance to break socio
economic barriers and to correct
uneven distribution of funds.
This allows the "few schools that
are good to remain good, while
the many that are poor remain
poor."
Franklin urged his audience to
fight the nation's educational in
equalities. "Racial and ethnic
discrimination in the United
States deserves your attention.
Who in the world would believe
that the richest nation in the
world — a country known for its
generosity — would be unable
to find money to educate the
children?" he said.
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily."
One year later, Donald Ken
nedy, then the Food and Drug
Comissioner on leave from the
University and since returned as
provost, criticized the "contem
porary loss of faith in govern
ment."
According to Kennedy, more
and more sectors of the public
wrongly believed that the gov
ernment was trying to gain more
control over their lives. The pur
pose of that belief, he said is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a les
sened need for its services.
"The new conservatives would
have you believe" that a reduc
tion of government activity "sig
nifies only the end of uncons
cionable intervention," while"in
reality it would mean the death
of an important concept of social
justice.
"In that concept, regulations
play a social role: it protects or
dinary people against the ad
verse consequences of private
monopoly power."
Kennedy conceded that reg
ulators have "overreached*
themselves in the past, but he ar
gued that "we have a mechanism
for redressing these errors.'' He
warned against the "all-out ef
fort" currently being made to
"convince Americans that be
cause no accurate line can be
drawn" between proper and im
proper regulation, "none should
be drawn at all."
The administ' itoi v h ioes

less than he should out of a fear
of anti-regulatory fervor may
spare himself from future con
troversy. Kennedy said. At the
same time, however, this will
"cost the system its chance of
self-correction and withhold
from the people their voice in
deciding how much government
they want."
Last year, the commencement
speaker focused on America's
interests overseas. Andrew
Young, speaking just a month
before he resigned his seat as
Ambassador to the United Na
tions, told the graduating stu
dents that they should help to
break down the barriers to world
communication and trade.
Americans should see the re
volutions in Third World coun
tries as outgrowths of the Ameri
can revolution. Young said.
"The high ideals and expecta
tions of these nations are reach
ing in the direction of human
rights and freedom," he said.
Because these principles reach
their highest development in this
country, "the people of the
world will come to your
doorsteps and mine, trying to
find ways to give order and
sense" to the world.
The graduating students.
Young continued, must there
fore help to "build understand
ing relationships that enable us
to cooperate on a worldwide
basis."
An ordained minister of the
Unitarian Church, a close as
sociate of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Georgia's
first black congressman in 101
years. Young had angered
people during his U.N. tenure
with his candid appraisals of in
ternational affairs.
At Commencement, however,
Young made it clear that his view
of foreign affairs stems from his
belief in American ideals. Quot
ing from"America the Beauti
ful." sung at the beginning of the
exercises, Young declared:
"The crowning good must be
extended across the seas to those
who look for the same level of
freedom" attained by Ameri
cans. Then, he said, the people of
the Third World "may reach the
same level of commencement we
reach today."

At least once a year, the out

line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.

President Herbert Hoover
took time out from his respon
sibilities. "Forgetting the prop
osed new Tariff Bill which lies on
his desk, the ardent pleas of pro
hibitionists and even the call of
the trout in the Rapidan River,"
he wired "cordial greetings and
warm congratulations to the
graduating Seniors at Stanford
University and my best wishes
tor a life of active service upon
which they now embark."
The commencement address,
delivered by Dr. John Maxson
Stillman, the retiring vice presi
dent of the University, discussed
"Idealism and National Policy."
The "brightest hope for the
near future," according to
Stillman. was the establishment
of a world court "which shall

unite the nations in an agree
ment that shall make forever im
possible such a catastrophe as we
now experience."
During the war and after,"it is
our duty to maintain our high
ideals . . . Success must not
tempt us to grasp for imperial
prizes." he cautioned.
In the spirit of patriotism
shown by the other "war class,"
the Class of '42 gave $1900 in
war bonds to the senior scholar
ship fund.
Because the war effort ruled
out the use of brass for the class
plate in front of Memorial
Church, the class had one made
in two-color reinforced concrete.
Among the 1150 persons
graduating was a John Day Mil
ler, executive of A. Schilling Co.,
importers of spices and coffee in

San Francisco. Miller was the
only one to receive a Bachelor of
Arts at Large Degree.
He had left the University in
April 1935, two units short of the
1 HO required for graduation. Not
having a diploma did not ad
versely affect him until an oppor
tunity to be commissioned as a
lieutenant in the Naval Air
Corps came up and he learned
that he needed a college degree
to qualify.
So the young executive came
back to the University and was
allowed to prepare a study on
"The Effect of the War on the
Spice Business" for two units.
Another graduate, Martha
Hartwig Tootle, received a un
ique graduation present — the
ripcord from the parachute
which saved her husband's life in
the Battle of Midway.
The commencement crowd,
reduced to 5000 by Army regu
lations, was given reasons for
"The Preservation of the Uni
versity" by Monroe Emanuel
Deutsch, vice president and pro
vost of the University of Califor
nia.
"There is great danger that we
may look at all university educa
tion through glasses clouded by
the mist of war," said Deutsch.
"We must take the long look
— and not let the 1942 scene
blind us to the fact that there will
bea world after 1942 and 1943."
Deutsch reminded listeners
that the country would need pro
fessionals and scholars in all
fields after the war.
"And unless those who are not
summoned to the immediate
service of our nation devote
themselves to their training," he
said, "we may enter the postwar
era a generation taught but one
thing — war."
Again, hopes for continued
peace were shattered. The Un
ited States came up with varia
tions on a theme: there was the
Cold War, the Korean war . . .
and the undeclared war in Viet
nam.
By 1969, antiwar sentiment
was rising. The former speaker
of the student legislature arrived

at commencement exercises in
an academic robe and coolie hat.
Other graduates sported anti-
ABM stickers on robes and mor
tarboards.
Disruption threat
There were threats of disrup
tion from the Students for a
Democratic Society group
(which did not materialize.)
Contrasts to the earlier "war
classes" continued to appear. In
1970, some 300 of the 1500
graduating chose not to rent caps
and gowns forcommencement to
show their opposition to the Vie
tnam war. The $5 that would
have gone to rental fees went to
peace causes.
Members of the class of '71
continued the effort. Some 200
of the 1600 students attending
ceremonies did not rent gowns,
contributing the $5 to groups
such as the Committee of Re
sponsibility, which provided

ceremonies were held in the stadium.
medical care in the United States
for war-injured children; the
Agape Foundation, the San
Francisco area project for non
violent change; and Draft Re
fuser Support, a newly-formed
group aiding men facing prison
for refusing the draft.
Although radicals handed out
Black Panther newspapers at the
entrances to Frost Ampitheater,
they made no effort to enter.
There were no disruptions, as
had been feared. The University
had banned carrying signs or
banners into the ceremonies, but
one graduate wore a peace sym
bol on his cap.
The ceremonies went
smoothly and some newspapers
referred to 1971 as the year of
"return to tradition," or the year
in which "innovation became
tradition."
Nevertheless, President
Richard Lyman seemed to
acknowledge that the University
had not been left untouched by
the changing times. Noting that it
is customary for the University
president to wish the departing
graduates well, he commented,
"Now one wonders whether the
roles ought not to be reversed,
whether it ought not to be the
departing graduates who wish
the University well." His remark
drew laughter and applause.
CBS commentator and chief
Washington correspondent Eric
Sevareid, the commencement
speaker, also had a few words on
the subject of unrest.
" Dissent is right and proper —
indeed, vital to our life — but it
does not follow that therefore
the more dissent the better," he
said. "It is an eternal error to
believe that a cause considered
righteous sanctifies unrighteous
methods."
Doubts
Like the graduating class,
Sev areid expressed doubts about
the United States' infallibility.
"Our political leaders are
learning that America's reach in
the world has exceeded its grasp;
that we can really give little to
other societies that they can
take," he said.
By 1975, it was clear to some
that there was at least one thing
the United States could give to
other countries — the technol
ogy and materials necessary for
nuclear proliferation.
Commencement speaker
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, U.S.
ambassador to the United Na
tions, warned listeners that "the
spread of plutonium around the
world" creates a threat of
planet-wide "nuclear disaster."

The possibility of an atomic
holocaust "does not at this point
arise primarily from the quest for
weapons development, but
rather as a bi-product of the in
nocent but urgent quest for
energy," Moynihan explained.
Separation
Therefore, the problem facing
Americans, he said, "is how to
separate the production of
energy from the proliferation of
weapons."
Not all the seniors participat
ing in commencement were
around to heed Moynihan's
warning: approximately 175 of
2000 graduates walked quietly
out of the amphitheater when
Moynihan was introduced and
returned when his speech was
over.
The walkout was the culmina
tion of that controversy which
had attended the selection of
Moynihan as commencement
speaker from the moment it was
announced.
A statement signed by "The
Black Graduating Students"
explained the aim of the protes
ters was not to "disrupt Moyni
han's right to free speech" but to
attention to the sort oi sub
tle racism exemplified in Moyni
han's 1969 report on the Negro
family.
In that report, Moynihan at
tributed the inferior social and
economic station of blacks to
what he saw as a disintegration of
the Negro family.
The protesters' act "drew,
cheers from some .. . boos from
a few and stony silence from
most," commented one ob
server. When one woman in
sisted in applauding for the pro
testers, Moynihan told her to
"please show the same courtesy
as those departing arc showing."
He went on to deliver his
speech to the slightly depleted
audience, ending on a hopeful
note. Nuclear arms control, he
said, would release "the energy
and creativity of all those
employed by the armaments in
dustry of the world. It is some
thing the graduates of 1975 may
wish to think about."
In 1977, John Hope Franklin,
an historian from the University
of Chicago, delivered something
of a retort to Moynihan's racial
views. Blasting the American
school system, Franklin said that
the "long, nightmarish fight" to
achieve educational equality had
yielded only the equal chance to
"secure an education that is
mediocre or worse."
He blamed this on public re
luctance to break socio
economic barriers and to correct
uneven distribution of funds.
This allows the "few schools that
are good to remain good, while
the many that are poor remain
poor."
Franklin urged his audience to
fight the nation's educational in
equalities. "Racial and ethnic
discrimination in the United
States deserves your attention.
Who in the world would believe
that the richest nation in the
world — a country known for its
generosity — would be unable
to find money to educate the
children?" he said.
"If you know how destructive
a faulty educational system can
be to the social fabric, then you
must surely want to do some
thing about an enterprise in
which you have invested so
heavily."
One year later, Donald Ken
nedy, then the Food and Drug
Comissioner on leave from the
University and since returned as
provost, criticized the "contem
porary loss of faith in govern
ment."
According to Kennedy, more
and more sectors of the public
wrongly believed that the gov
ernment was trying to gain more
control over their lives. The pur
pose of that belief, he said is "to
make government withdraw by
persuading us that there is a les
sened need for its services.
"The new conservatives would
have you believe" that a reduc
tion of government activity "sig
nifies only the end of uncons
cionable intervention," while"in
reality it would mean the death
of an important concept of social
justice.
"In that concept, regulations
play a social role: it protects or
dinary people against the ad
verse consequences of private
monopoly power."
Kennedy conceded that reg
ulators have "overreached*
themselves in the past, but he ar
gued that "we have a mechanism
for redressing these errors.'' He
warned against the "all-out ef
fort" currently being made to
"convince Americans that be
cause no accurate line can be
drawn" between proper and im
proper regulation, "none should
be drawn at all."
The administ' itoi v h ioes

less than he should out of a fear
of anti-regulatory fervor may
spare himself from future con
troversy. Kennedy said. At the
same time, however, this will
"cost the system its chance of
self-correction and withhold
from the people their voice in
deciding how much government
they want."
Last year, the commencement
speaker focused on America's
interests overseas. Andrew
Young, speaking just a month
before he resigned his seat as
Ambassador to the United Na
tions, told the graduating stu
dents that they should help to
break down the barriers to world
communication and trade.
Americans should see the re
volutions in Third World coun
tries as outgrowths of the Ameri
can revolution. Young said.
"The high ideals and expecta
tions of these nations are reach
ing in the direction of human
rights and freedom," he said.
Because these principles reach
their highest development in this
country, "the people of the
world will come to your
doorsteps and mine, trying to
find ways to give order and
sense" to the world.
The graduating students.
Young continued, must there
fore help to "build understand
ing relationships that enable us
to cooperate on a worldwide
basis."
An ordained minister of the
Unitarian Church, a close as
sociate of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King, Jr., and Georgia's
first black congressman in 101
years. Young had angered
people during his U.N. tenure
with his candid appraisals of in
ternational affairs.
At Commencement, however,
Young made it clear that his view
of foreign affairs stems from his
belief in American ideals. Quot
ing from"America the Beauti
ful." sung at the beginning of the
exercises, Young declared:
"The crowning good must be
extended across the seas to those
who look for the same level of
freedom" attained by Ameri
cans. Then, he said, the people of
the Third World "may reach the
same level of commencement we
reach today."
