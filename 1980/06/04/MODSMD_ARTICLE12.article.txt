# Past commencements reflect changing times

At least once a year, the out
side world comes to "The
Farm," as families, friends and
other guests gather for com
mencement exercises.
In the University's earlier
years, the mood was cheery, in
nocent and hopeful. In 1901, for
example, the biggest concern of
commencement week seemed to
be keeping the electric lights
going until 2:30 a.m. "so there
will be no possibility of complet
ing the entire program" of the
social event of the week. Senior
Ball.
Those were the days when
hard work still got one places and
G.M. Richardson gave graduates
a few words on "The Gospel of
Work."
The class of '06, knocked a bit
off course by an earthquake,
picked up the pieces in time to
hold a somewhat belated cere

mony on Sept. 15.
Tradition was held firmly in
line, although the class president
attempted an innovation: getting
the faculty to appear in caps and
gowns.
The request was rejected; the
Committee on Public Exercises
said it considered the time"inau
spicious for such an action on the
part of the faculty." The
graduates did appear in caps and
gowns, however.
By 1917 there was a war going
on and the graduating class was
very much aware of it.
They called themselves "The
War Class" and the cover of the
commencement issue of The
Daily Palo Alto (predecessor of
The Stanford Daily) showed a
row of uniformed young men
standing at attention next to the
U.S. flag.
Class orator W. Leslie Miller,

speaking on " The College Man
and the War," urged fellow
classmates to serve the nation.
The class will, written by A.H.
Emery, left "to all the genera
tions of Stanford students who
are to come . . . the example of
service to the nation in time of
need ....
The Class of' 17 also left "the
institution of Stanford military
training . . . for the benefit of
those who are to follow. We
hope and indeed know that they
will take full advantage of its be
nefits and that they will be better
Stanford men and better citizens
therefore."
When the United States began
to feel the Great Depression,
some may have doubted that
"better times" would ever come.
The Class of '30. however, made
no mention of the- hard times.
