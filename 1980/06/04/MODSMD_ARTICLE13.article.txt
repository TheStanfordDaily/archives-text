When the class of 19K0 en
tered the University almost four
years ago. Dean of Admissions
J red Hargadon made the ex
travagant and perhaps injudici
ous claim that '"If I were able to
do it all over again, I'd like to
start college with the class of
1 9.N0 at Stanford." One can only
wonder if Hargadon would cur
rently desire that same company
for graduation.
Likewise, after four years of
life on The 112 arm, would those of
us who are now preparing to end
our tenure here concur with
Hargadon's original sentiment?
Would we make the same
choices if we were suddenly pro
jected back to that sweltering
September day in 1976 when we
were first introduced to the plea
sures, vices and travails of Ice
land Stanford Junior Uni\ ersity?
Then the incoming freshman
class was hailed in laudatory
terms. We were categorized b\
Hargadon himself as "able, ac
complished. attractive, energetic
and diverse." ()! course, I red
had said much the same thing
about our predecessors and has
since appended an adjective a
year to that list for our succes
sors. but we knew we were spe
cial.
Certainly our past records in
dicated that we would do our
best to further Stanford tradition
and to even infuse a little verve
of our own into the sometimes
overly studious environment.

Whether or not we lived up to
our promising reputation is not
for us to judge. Whether or not
we achieve our personal goals is
something we must each
evaluate individually. Hut taking
a fleeting glimpse behind may
remind us of the legacy we now
leave the University and of the
unique opportunities it has af
forded us.
Our freshman year was
marked by politics and a return
to the activism of the 1960s and
early "70s. Campaign posters,
bumper stickers and eager de
baters littered the campus au
tumn quarter in honor of the na
tional and statewide elections.
Some of us temporarily aban
doned our midterm cramming
that November night when a
Georgia peanut farmer eked past
an incumbent but unelected
president to take our country's
highest office. People jockeyed
for position in front ot Tresid
der's giant screen, reached into
garbage bags of popcorn while
ga/ing fixedly at the hazy returns
on dorm televisions, and tooted
party horns at the just opened
American Studies House elec
tion celebration.
The energy didn't cease,
though, with Jimmy Carter's in
auguration. but was tunneled
into local concerns.
Two Marine Corps recruiters
who visited campus were pic
keted during winter and spring
quarters. President Richard

Lyman was called to task for the
California Supreme Court's de
cision in favor of Allan Bakke.
Then, the issue of the year was
pushed to the forefront: Univer
sity investment responsibility.
After the Board of Trustees
voted unanimously to abstain
from proxy votes concerning the
South African investments of
five major corporations in which
the University held stock, the
protest movement began in ear
nest. A week of student resis
tance. replete with guerrilla
theatres and numerous rallies,
upwelled May 2.
On May 9, Stanford stepped
— or rather sat — back into the
national headlines it had created
several years earlier. Some 294
students were arrested that day
for participation in a 16-hour
sit-in at Old Union. More than
450 supporters outside chanted
"Apartheid means profit, Stan
lord won't stop it." as police led
the offending loiterers away. All
2 1 >4 were later arraigned in Palo
Alto Municipal Court.
The year ended on a dry note
— the drought deprived us of a
spring-quarter lake and its ac
companying festivities. But we
hopped down to San Jose to see a
new science fiction film, entitled
Star Wars, to forget finals for
another three months.
The Stanford Committee on
Responsible Investment Policy
(SCRIP) reconvened its ac
tivities the following academic





\c;u. but at the least the lake til
led tn drown our sorrows for the
first time in three years.
Academically, the Faculty Se
mite voted to reinstate the West
ern Civilization requirement,
setting up a two-year experimen
tal period during which time a
pilot Western Culture course
would he offered voluntarily to
students. In other pre-emptive
action, the Administration re
placed the androgynous theme
house. Simone de Beauvoir.
after only a year's trial with a
German Studies house.
On the student side, yet
another achronym, SOC,
usurped ASSU Senate authority
from the Hammer and Coffin
slate of 1 The SOC senators
dominated an election marred by
controversy; 23 senators were
cited for campaign irregularities.
In December, the 33-year ban
on sororities at Stanford was of
ficially rescinded by the Board of
Trustees, and six national
sororities participated in spring
rush.
At the year's culmination, the
Supreme Court handed down
two bombshells. Hitting close to
home, the court ruled in The
Stanford Daily v. /archer that a
newspaper's offices may be
searched by police wielding a
search warrant, even if none of
its employees is suspected of a
crime. In another case, Allan
Bakke won admission into
UC-Davis medical school.

As we moved from sophomore
slump to junior jitters, the school
seemed to follow us. The ASSU
Senate led off the year by almost
impulsively extending a guest
professorship to Zulfiker Ali
Bhutto, past president and prime
minister of Pakistan. The Pakis
tani government took almost as
little notice ol that stab in the
dark as did the student bod\. and
it hung Bhutto for his alleged
transgressions.
Invoking a more frantic re
sponse. the libraries, our bas
tions of peaceful erudition and
repose, literally burst at the
seams. In early November, react
ing to California's passage of the
infamous Prop. 13, a water main
burst in the Meyer Library
basement. The damage incurred
to about 40.000 books
amounted to over $1 million.
Less than seven months later, a
sprinkler pipe in the new $12
million Green Library addition
spilled thousands of gallons of
water on the carpet, causing
more than $250,000 in damage.
Local Rep. Pete McCloskey
(R-Mcnlo Park) stirred
springtime emotions by propos
ing a national service plan for
I iS-year-olds. The prospect of
involuntary servitude loomed
over our heads all summer long.
Also, last summer the campus
was torn by a vituperative
labor-management dispute at
the Tresidder Union Coffee
House, and tension continued

until the ASSU successfully bid
for the Coffee House contract
And so, senior year and its at
tendant lethargy rolled around.
Auguring poorly for our final
year's providence, our mascot
missing football team lost the Big
(iame to the lumbering Bears for
the first time in our Stanford
term.
Sororities still awaited official
University recognition and held
rush off campus, while more
women were thrust off campus
when a three-alarm fire gutted
Storey House. Even warmed by
the addition of those displaced
homeless, the viability of the
fraternities and theme houses
was soreh questioned.
Enduring longer than we.
President Richard Lyman an
nounced his intention to resign in
August to assume the presidency
of the prestigious Rockefeller
Foundation.
Probably the biggest change
wrought has occurred in empty
ing our parents' pocketbooks. as
we cram ourselves into registra
tion lines for the right to relieve
ourselves of increasingly larger
amounts of money.
So. we leave, no doubt with
mixed emotions. And, it we
could, we might try to come back
to reli\ e the joy. the heartbreak,
the exhilcration. But only I red
Hargadon knows it we could
ever again qualify for that ex
perience.
