When the class of 19K0 en
tered the University almost four
years ago. Dean of Admissions
J red Hargadon made the ex
travagant and perhaps injudici
ous claim that '"If I were able to
do it all over again, I'd like to
start college with the class of
1 9.N0 at Stanford." One can only
wonder if Hargadon would cur
rently desire that same company
for graduation.
Likewise, after four years of
life on The 112 arm, would those of
us who are now preparing to end
our tenure here concur with
Hargadon's original sentiment?
Would we make the same
choices if we were suddenly pro
jected back to that sweltering
September day in 1976 when we
were first introduced to the plea
sures, vices and travails of Ice
land Stanford Junior Uni\ ersity?
Then the incoming freshman
class was hailed in laudatory
terms. We were categorized b\
Hargadon himself as "able, ac
complished. attractive, energetic
and diverse." ()! course, I red
had said much the same thing
about our predecessors and has
since appended an adjective a
year to that list for our succes
sors. but we knew we were spe
cial.
Certainly our past records in
dicated that we would do our
best to further Stanford tradition
and to even infuse a little verve
of our own into the sometimes
overly studious environment.

Whether or not we lived up to
our promising reputation is not
for us to judge. Whether or not
we achieve our personal goals is
something we must each
evaluate individually. Hut taking
a fleeting glimpse behind may
remind us of the legacy we now
leave the University and of the
unique opportunities it has af
forded us.
Our freshman year was
marked by politics and a return
to the activism of the 1960s and
early "70s. Campaign posters,
bumper stickers and eager de
baters littered the campus au
tumn quarter in honor of the na
tional and statewide elections.
Some of us temporarily aban
doned our midterm cramming
that November night when a
Georgia peanut farmer eked past
an incumbent but unelected
president to take our country's
highest office. People jockeyed
for position in front ot Tresid
der's giant screen, reached into
garbage bags of popcorn while
ga/ing fixedly at the hazy returns
on dorm televisions, and tooted
party horns at the just opened
American Studies House elec
tion celebration.
The energy didn't cease,
though, with Jimmy Carter's in
auguration. but was tunneled
into local concerns.
Two Marine Corps recruiters
who visited campus were pic
keted during winter and spring
quarters. President Richard

Lyman was called to task for the
California Supreme Court's de
cision in favor of Allan Bakke.
Then, the issue of the year was
pushed to the forefront: Univer
sity investment responsibility.
After the Board of Trustees
voted unanimously to abstain
from proxy votes concerning the
South African investments of
five major corporations in which
the University held stock, the
protest movement began in ear
nest. A week of student resis
tance. replete with guerrilla
theatres and numerous rallies,
upwelled May 2.
On May 9, Stanford stepped
— or rather sat — back into the
national headlines it had created
several years earlier. Some 294
students were arrested that day
for participation in a 16-hour
sit-in at Old Union. More than
450 supporters outside chanted
"Apartheid means profit, Stan
lord won't stop it." as police led
the offending loiterers away. All
2 1 >4 were later arraigned in Palo
Alto Municipal Court.
The year ended on a dry note
— the drought deprived us of a
spring-quarter lake and its ac
companying festivities. But we
hopped down to San Jose to see a
new science fiction film, entitled
Star Wars, to forget finals for
another three months.
