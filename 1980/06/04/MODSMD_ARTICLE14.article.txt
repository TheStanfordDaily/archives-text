LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly eleg
ant — somewhere in between a
French country inn and an exclu
sive British club. You can relax
in a pampered world of starched
linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50
for one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all 51.60).
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream (51.25) and
Creme Caramel (51.50 easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a huge
wooden bar with an equally
elegant, yet quiet atmosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10
a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and

boasting a growing, devoted
clientele. Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers. From
such a list as Cannelloni Floren
tine, ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re

veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken al FornoAr
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are

particularly noteworthy. Espe
cially delightful is La Posada
Tostada, which is probably the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
1 1 p.m.

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696

Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef Chu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696

Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef Chu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.

candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50

alternative.
Dessert was the high point of

The Gatehouse also has a huge

The Gatehouse is open for

MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and

boasting a growing, devoted
clientele. Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers. From
such a list as Cannelloni Floren
tine, ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re

veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken al FornoAr
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA

Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a

The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.

MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and

boasting a growing, devoted
clientele. Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers. From
such a list as Cannelloni Floren
tine, ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re

veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken al FornoAr
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.

p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are

particularly noteworthy. Espe
cially delightful is La Posada
Tostada, which is probably the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
1 1 p.m.

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696

Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef Chu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE

The Gatehouse is quietly eleg

linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50
for one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all 51.60).
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream (51.25) and
Creme Caramel (51.50 easily

The Gatehouse also has a huge

Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly eleg
ant — somewhere in between a
French country inn and an exclu
sive British club. You can relax
in a pampered world of starched
linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50
for one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all 51.60).
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream (51.25) and
Creme Caramel (51.50 easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a huge
wooden bar with an equally
elegant, yet quiet atmosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for
dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10

MADDALENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and

boasting a growing, devoted
clientele. Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers. From
such a list as Cannelloni Floren
tine, ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re

veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken al FornoAr
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.

p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are

particularly noteworthy. Espe
cially delightful is La Posada
Tostada, which is probably the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
1 1 p.m.

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696

Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef Chu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.

pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.
THE CHINA LION

China Lion, though only two

The menu features over 180

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE

The Gatehouse is quietly eleg

French country inn and an exclu

in a pampered world of starched
linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50
for one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all 51.60).
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream (51.25) and
Creme Caramel (51.50 easily
triumph over your calorific con

The Gatehouse also has a huge

elegant, yet quiet atmosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for

MADDALENA'S CONTI

Now in its second year and

boasting a growing, devoted

for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers a conti
nental menu; pasta is served un
blushingly alongside Scampi
Bordelaise. Our meals were ex
cellent.
The abundant Italian pastas
are the unusual appetizers. From
such a list as Cannelloni Floren
tine, ($6.25), Fettucini alia
Romana ($5.25) and alia
Romagna ($5.50), we chose
Linguine Von.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re

veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chicken al FornoAr
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and carpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.

Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are

particularly noteworthy. Espe
cially delightful is La Posada
Tostada, which is probably the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
1 1 p.m.

MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S

One shouldn't miss the mu shu

prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no

for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of

El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid
style, $2.50) Dahadana /A.v
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park.
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamares
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.

Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means
"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
1 cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are

particularly noteworthy. Espe
cially delightful is La Posada
Tostada, which is probably the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
1 1 p.m.
Asian
MUI KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic,
"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-yang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the keys to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance, rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese, Mandarin and other
styles of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui Kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui Kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
"the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHU'S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696

Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef Chu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu, Chu will
prepare it specially if you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carte items and $6.50 to $7.50
for dinners), Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best of all, great food. Run by
former Vietnamese vice premier
Nguyen Ton Joan, the Mekong
offers 23 entrees and five soups,
all reasonably priced at about $3
a la carte.
Vietnamese cooking uses
marinades and spices exten
sively, but they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct but subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflect
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees are
the usual barbeque chicken,
which is first marinated in green
onion and soy sauce, and the
Mekong curries. The Mekong of
fers a very civilized but casual
atmosphere.
COLONEL LEE'S MONGO
LIAN BBQ
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, are not known
for their fancy cookery. Their
simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century.
The Chinese added vegetables
and other ingredients, and the
cuisine became known as the
"Mongolian Barbeque."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appeti/er bars) are
in for a new treat — an entre bar!
Dinner is priced at $4.95 and in

cludes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro. are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbeque sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming by the fact that no one

spoke English very well. Colonel
l.ee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.
THE CHINA LION
3345 F.I Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old. is establish
ing a reputation for excellent
Chinese food. Samson Chu
