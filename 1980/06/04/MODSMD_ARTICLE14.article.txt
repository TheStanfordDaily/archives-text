LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Ouite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Pointes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d /huitres an Curry

(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice, lour delightful soups are
Noisette d'Agneau an
Ps>rto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1'3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise —fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
chocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
only up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or $60 dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du

Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites— 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Su/ette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.
Palo Alto
326-5680
Well, Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And if the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $X, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re
freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better

than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2880
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes, Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks of
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings), Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Panzotti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina

(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard faire of ice-cream,
zabaglione, sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly eleg
ant — somewhere in between a
French country inn and an exclu
sive British club. You can relax
in a pampered world of starched
linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good — it is, but it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break (sl2 for two; $6.50
for one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
