... to the Farm!
And welcome to the 1 9sQSummerVisitor'sGuide. a special publication of
The Stanford Daily. We have designed the Visitor's Guide with the idea of
acquainting summer school students, conferees and visitors with a little bit of
the University's history and have tried to outline some of the unique and
interesting aspects of the Peninsula.
For those already familiar with the area, we hope to give you some new
insights into entertainment, recreation, and dining delights this summer, and
certainly some diversions from those lengthy seminars or book-filled nights
in Meyer Library.
This summer is already shaping up as a happening-filled one. As you may
have already heard, current provost Donald Kennedy was chosen last week
to become Stanford's new president. Richard Lyman will be leaving on
August 1 for New York, to assume the presidency of the prestigious
Rockefeller Foundation.
The last few days have also heard talk of Stanford being considered as the
site for the United States' "alternative Olympics." For more news on these
and other stories, concerning both Stanford and the "world beyond Palm
Drive," be sure to keep up with the issesof the summer Daily. The Daily will
come out every Tuesday and Friday, beginning tomorrow, and copies will be
available all over campus.
Some of the articles printed in this issue are new; others are reprints of
other Daily articles. All of them can give you at least a taste of what is
available to you this summer. We could not tell you everything, but there is at
least enough space to recommend a few sources for more information.
The "pink section ot the Sunday Examiner & Chronicle includes an
in-depth entertainment section, plus TV listings and other Bay area events.
You also might want to browse through the bookstore's many San Francisco
restaurant guides and Northern California excursion books.
At any rate, have a good stay at Stanford, take advantage of what we hope
will be nice weather, and enjoy the Visitor's Guide\
