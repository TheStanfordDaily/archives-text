# Thomas: scientist with 'a bold view of man'
## 
### 
Dr. Lewis Thomas — scientist,
educator, physician and author
— will address the graduating
class of 1980 on Sunday after
noon in Frost amphitheater.
Thomas, author of The Lives
of a Cell: Notes of a Biology
Watcher and The Medusa and the
Snail: More Notes of a Biology
Watcher, is currently the presi
dent of the Memorial Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Center in New
York, one of the world's leading
cancer research centers.
Thomas will speak on "Uncer
tainty in Science."
A member of the National
Academy of Sciences and the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, Thomas was dean of
the Yale Medical School before
going to Sloan-Kettering in
1974.
Two years ago, in an address
to the American Association for
the Advancement of Sciences, he
said, "These are not the best
times for the human mind. All
sorts of things seem to be turning
out wrong, and the century
seems to be slipping through our
fingers with almost all promises
unfilled.
"We are ignorant about how
we work, about where we fit in.

and most of all about the enorm
ous, imponderable system of life
in which we are all embedded as
working parts.
"It is not so bad a thing to be
totally ignorant; the hard thing is
to be part way along toward real
knowledge, far enough to be
aware of being ignorant. It is
embarrassing and depressing,
and it is one of our troubles to
day."
Thomas earned the National
Book Award in 1974 for The
Lives of a Cell, and his other
book. The Medusa and the Snail,
last year was ranked in the top
ten by the NewXork City Book
Review for more than 20 weeks.
Each book is a collection of
short essays which deal with
Thomas' efforts to find a place
for the human being in a biologi
cal world.
Alan Alpert, a senior class
president, said Thomas' name
was submitted to President
Richard Lyman for invitation
because "we wanted someone
outside the usual political
framework."
Gray Boyce, another senior
class president, said Thomas is
"so interdisciplinary that he can
relate to many people and there

fore have a more widespread ap
peal."
Thomas has received degrees
from Princeton University, Har
vard Medical School and Yale
University. He served his intern
ship at Boston City Hospital.
As a professor, administrator
and advisor, Thomas has worked
at several medical facilities, in
cluding Johns Hopkins, New
York University, University of
Minnesota Medical School and
Yale.
Time magazine has called
Thomas"a gifted writer with wit,
imagination and a bold, en
couraging vision of hoth man and
nature."
At the time of his selection,
the senior class presidents to
gether said, "We feel his inter
disciplinary approach fills a need
in our society. Because he is able
to perceive relationships bet
ween various disciplines, he
achieves a more thorough under
standing of life as a whole.
"To Dr. Thomas, a keen ob
server and thinker, scientific
phenomena elicit philosophical
notions. Moreover, he com
municates these notions, allow
ing us to share and appreciate his
insights."

Joining Alpert and Boyce in
the statement were senior class
presidents Sandra Shanker and
David Hood.
Thomas' name originally was
suggested through informal sur
veys given to the senior class. His
name was added to a list of about
150 others that were then consi

dered by the Advisory Com
mencement Panel composed of
the four senior presidents, two
professors, one graduate student
and Lyman's assistant, Jean Fet
ter. They narrowed the list down
to six names, from which Lyman
qhose Thomas to be the 1980
commencement speaker.

we work, about where we fit in.

and most of all about the enorm
ous, imponderable system of life
in which we are all embedded as
working parts.
"It is not so bad a thing to be
totally ignorant; the hard thing is
to be part way along toward real
knowledge, far enough to be
aware of being ignorant. It is
embarrassing and depressing,
and it is one of our troubles to
day."
Thomas earned the National
Book Award in 1974 for The
Lives of a Cell, and his other
book. The Medusa and the Snail,
last year was ranked in the top
ten by the NewXork City Book
Review for more than 20 weeks.
Each book is a collection of
short essays which deal with
Thomas' efforts to find a place
for the human being in a biologi
cal world.
Alan Alpert, a senior class
president, said Thomas' name
was submitted to President
Richard Lyman for invitation
because "we wanted someone
outside the usual political
framework."
Gray Boyce, another senior
class president, said Thomas is
"so interdisciplinary that he can
relate to many people and there

fore have a more widespread ap
peal."
Thomas has received degrees
from Princeton University, Har
vard Medical School and Yale
University. He served his intern
ship at Boston City Hospital.
As a professor, administrator
and advisor, Thomas has worked
at several medical facilities, in
cluding Johns Hopkins, New
York University, University of
Minnesota Medical School and
Yale.
Time magazine has called
Thomas"a gifted writer with wit,
imagination and a bold, en
couraging vision of hoth man and
nature."
At the time of his selection,
the senior class presidents to
gether said, "We feel his inter
disciplinary approach fills a need
in our society. Because he is able
to perceive relationships bet
ween various disciplines, he
achieves a more thorough under
standing of life as a whole.
"To Dr. Thomas, a keen ob
server and thinker, scientific
phenomena elicit philosophical
notions. Moreover, he com
municates these notions, allow
ing us to share and appreciate his
insights."

Joining Alpert and Boyce in
the statement were senior class
presidents Sandra Shanker and
David Hood.
Thomas' name originally was
suggested through informal sur
veys given to the senior class. His
name was added to a list of about
150 others that were then consi

dered by the Advisory Com
mencement Panel composed of
the four senior presidents, two
professors, one graduate student
and Lyman's assistant, Jean Fet
ter. They narrowed the list down
to six names, from which Lyman
qhose Thomas to be the 1980
commencement speaker.
