# From earthquake to fire; an historical campus tour

### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley." he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises. . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — "a misty camp
of mountains pitched tumult
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming its
higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena. its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemi
sal . . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks. Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their uni
versity on the site of their subur
ban home. Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876. consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant of Endow
ment with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grain fields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the stvle

of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it follows
the European Romanesque,
which is characterized by re
ctilinear stone buildings joined
bv covered arcades formed ol
successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.
The inner quad of 12 clas
sroom buildings — with the cent
ral place reserved for the future
Memorial Church — and three
engineering buildings. Eneina
Hall for men and Roble Hall for
women were ready for the Uni
versity's opening on October 1.
IX9I.
"These long corridors with
their stately pillars." Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will have
their part !n the students' train
ing. Each stone in the quad
rangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White ol
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beautiful
college architecture in America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April IS. |9()h. the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad
100 feet high and decorated with
a triezc depicting the march of

civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a librarv.
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to he known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but onlv a
temporary one. for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pursu
ing a construction project that
was begun in 1886 and that has
been intermittently continued up
to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board ot
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the footh
ills.

The areas designated tor light
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used tor space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biological
sciences.
T he inner and outer quads oc
cupy 17 acres at the heart of the
academic area The inner quad's
12 classroom buildings, two of
which are now used by the presi
dent and his staff, date from the
time the University opened in
1891, while the outer quad was
completed in 1903. the same
year that Memorial Church was
dedicated.
Buildings in the outer quad are
being brought up to
earthquake-proof standards by
an "inside-out" process of con
struction to preserve the
sandstone exterior.

Stanfords' deep religious faith,
though they were followers of no
