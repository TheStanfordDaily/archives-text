# From earthquake to fire; an historical campus tour
## 
### 
When David Starr Jordan ar
rived at Stanford in the summer
of 1891 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley." he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex
tends southward 50 miles and
more from near the head of San
Francisco Bay. Bounding it on
the southwest rises. . . the Sierra
de la Santa Cruz — "a misty camp
of mountains pitched tumult
ously' ....
"Immediately behind the
University estate and forming its
higher background is the
wooded Sierra Morena. its cloak
of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemi
sal . . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar
ren and treeless Sierra del Monte
Diablo."
In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor
able climate assured by its situa
tion between bay and ocean, its
meadows patterned with ancient
oaks. Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their uni
versity on the site of their subur
ban home. Palo Alto.

The first parcel, bought in
1876. consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant of Endow
ment with the stipulation that it
should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi
dent of Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, and the promi
nent landscape architect, Fre
derick Law Olmsted, in the
summer of 1886.
Grainfield site
They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grain fields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen
eral concept for the grounds and
the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the stvle

of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most
eminent architect of his time.
The style is called Richardso
nian Romanesque, and it follows
the European Romanesque,
which is characterized by re
ctilinear stone buildings joined
bv covered arcades formed ol
successive half-circle arches
supported by short columns with
decorated capitals.

sroom buildings — with the cent

Memorial Church — and three

"These long corridors with
their stately pillars." Dr. Jordan
said at the dedication, "will have
their part !n the students' train

rangle shall teach its lesson of
grace and genuiness."
President Andrew D. White ol
Cornell pronounced the Stan
ford buildings the most beautiful
college architecture in America.
The ground shook
But just before five on the
morning of April IS. |9()h. the
ground beneath Stanford's new
buildings shook for 45 seconds.
The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill
ions of dollars of damage.
The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con
cussion blew out the front wall.
The rose window and the huge
Venetian mosaic of the Sermon
on the Mount that had graced the
facade lay as rubble in the inner
quad.
Memorial Arch, the central
structure of the outer quad
100 feet high and decorated with
a triezc depicting the march of

civilization — was damaged
beyond repair. So were a librarv.
and gymnasium that were just
short ot completion. None of
these was replaced.
Reconstruction cost more
than $2 million. Classes were
dismissed until the fall. Seniors
in what has come to he known as
"The Earthquake Class" were
voted their degrees in May.
It was a setback, but onlv a
temporary one. for the young
university quickly rebuilt, pursu
ing a construction project that
was begun in 1886 and that has
been intermittently continued up
to the present.
The construction has taken
place on approximately 5000
acres reserved by the Board ot
Trustees for educational uses.
This is the heartland of the Stan
ford land, comprised for the
most part of the central portion
running from El Camino Real to
the back boundary in the footh
ills.

The areas designated tor light
lie in open land, including the
arboretum, golf course and the
foothill lands used tor space
probing antennae and research
in nuclear physics and biological
sciences.

though construction was defer
red When Senator Stanford died
in 1893. his widow determined
that the church would be built as

a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to ap
prove the mosaic sketches, and
obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, occupies
most of the facade of the church
and. with 47 figures, depicts the
Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven

ice. but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pam
phlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World

War I when he headed the
Commission tor Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial lo the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who
search for peace."
I he Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems til social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium). dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I.the au
ditorium also contains in the
lover plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The

main auditorium scats I 700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The local
point of the plaza is a tall, tree
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store, lounge
and student government offices.
In addition, it contains a com
munity center with meeting
rooms, music listening rooms, art
gallery and record, tape and
reading libraries.
The Stanford School ol
Medicine moved from San 1 ran
cisco into its quarters in I95 l >

The $21 million structure con
sists of three sections — the hos
pital, the outpatient clinics and
the teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerland Ford
dedicated the $1 1.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown lib
rary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman Hall,
which contains the classrooms
and moot court; the James Irvine
Gallery, which contains the fa
culty and student meeting rooms
and lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Rising steeply
trom Searsville Lake, the 735-
acre preserve contains a unique
association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dot ted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
streams and pools. The preserve

is used regularly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga
tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Fnergy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energy of 20 billion electron
volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the'7os end. the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the

early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements, in
cluding campus landmarks such
as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Lib
rary, the Green Library annex,
the Terman Engineering Center
and the Mudd chemistry build
ing.
Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building pro
jects for the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new music
facility behind Dinkelspiel Au-

ditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction will soon begin on a
new $25 million, SOO-student
dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event this year necessitated more
construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was gut
ted by fire in March. The Univer
sity plans to rebuild the structure
soon, at an estimated cost of $ 1.4
million.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneficience of University
donors (including the federal
government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as it was this year, for in
stance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in 18S6
when Senator Stanford decided
to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

The ponderous church tower,

obtaining papal permission to

The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, occupies

After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of

Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pam
phlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World

War I when he headed the
Commission tor Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial lo the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who
search for peace."
I he Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems til social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium). dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I.the au
ditorium also contains in the
lover plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The

main auditorium scats I 700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The local
point of the plaza is a tall, tree
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store, lounge
and student government offices.
In addition, it contains a com
munity center with meeting
rooms, music listening rooms, art
gallery and record, tape and
reading libraries.
The Stanford School ol

The $21 million structure con

the teaching laboratories and

New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerland Ford
dedicated the $1 1.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown lib
rary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman Hall,
which contains the classrooms
and moot court; the James Irvine
Gallery, which contains the fa
culty and student meeting rooms
and lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Rising steeply
trom Searsville Lake, the 735-
acre preserve contains a unique
association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dot ted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
streams and pools. The preserve

is used regularly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga
tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Fnergy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energy of 20 billion electron
volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the'7os end. the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the

early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements, in
cluding campus landmarks such
as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Lib
rary, the Green Library annex,
the Terman Engineering Center
and the Mudd chemistry build
ing.
Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building pro
jects for the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new music
facility behind Dinkelspiel Au-

ditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction will soon begin on a
new $25 million, SOO-student
dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event this year necessitated more
construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was gut
ted by fire in March. The Univer
sity plans to rebuild the structure
soon, at an estimated cost of $ 1.4
million.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneficience of University
donors (including the federal
government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as it was this year, for in
stance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in 18S6
when Senator Stanford decided
to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting

After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely

Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pam
phlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World

War I when he headed the
Commission tor Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial lo the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who
search for peace."
I he Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems til social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium). dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I.the au
ditorium also contains in the
lover plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The

main auditorium scats I 700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The local
point of the plaza is a tall, tree
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store, lounge
and student government offices.
In addition, it contains a com
munity center with meeting
rooms, music listening rooms, art
gallery and record, tape and
reading libraries.

New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerland Ford
dedicated the $1 1.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown lib
rary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman Hall,
which contains the classrooms
and moot court; the James Irvine
Gallery, which contains the fa
culty and student meeting rooms
and lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Rising steeply
trom Searsville Lake, the 735-
acre preserve contains a unique
association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dot ted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
streams and pools. The preserve

is used regularly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga
tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Fnergy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energy of 20 billion electron
volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the'7os end. the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the

early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements, in
cluding campus landmarks such
as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Lib
rary, the Green Library annex,
the Terman Engineering Center
and the Mudd chemistry build
ing.
Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building pro
jects for the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new music
facility behind Dinkelspiel Au-

ditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction will soon begin on a
new $25 million, SOO-student
dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event this year necessitated more
construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was gut
ted by fire in March. The Univer
sity plans to rebuild the structure
soon, at an estimated cost of $ 1.4
million.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneficience of University
donors (including the federal
government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as it was this year, for in
stance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in 18S6
when Senator Stanford decided
to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

The great earthquake killed two
men on campus and caused mill

The ponderous church tower,
with its clocks, chimes and spire,
crashed into the chancel of
Memorial Church, and the con

obtaining papal permission to

The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, occupies
most of the facade of the church
and. with 47 figures, depicts the

After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of

Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pam
phlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World

War I when he headed the
Commission tor Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial lo the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who
search for peace."
I he Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems til social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium). dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I.the au
ditorium also contains in the
lover plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The

main auditorium scats I 700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The local
point of the plaza is a tall, tree
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store, lounge
and student government offices.
In addition, it contains a com
munity center with meeting
rooms, music listening rooms, art
gallery and record, tape and
reading libraries.
The Stanford School ol

The $21 million structure con

the teaching laboratories and
classrooms.
New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerland Ford
dedicated the $1 1.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown lib
rary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman Hall,
which contains the classrooms
and moot court; the James Irvine
Gallery, which contains the fa
culty and student meeting rooms
and lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Rising steeply
trom Searsville Lake, the 735-
acre preserve contains a unique
association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dot ted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
streams and pools. The preserve

is used regularly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga
tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper
ates a two-mile-long atom
smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Fnergy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energy of 20 billion electron
volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the'7os end. the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the

early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements, in
cluding campus landmarks such
as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Lib
rary, the Green Library annex,
the Terman Engineering Center
and the Mudd chemistry build
ing.
Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building pro
jects for the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new music
facility behind Dinkelspiel Au-

ditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction will soon begin on a
new $25 million, SOO-student
dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event this year necessitated more
construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was gut
ted by fire in March. The Univer
sity plans to rebuild the structure
soon, at an estimated cost of $ 1.4
million.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneficience of University
donors (including the federal
government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as it was this year, for in
stance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in 18S6
when Senator Stanford decided
to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.

When David Starr Jordan ar

of 1891 to be the University's
first president, he found the
countryside enthralling:
"The Santa Clara Valley." he
wrote in his autobiography, "ex

"Immediately behind the

of redwood, oak and madrono
diversified by thickets of chemi
sal . . . .
"On the east, opposing the
green ridges of the Holy Cross,
stretches the long, relatively bar

In this sheltered area 30 miles
south of San Francisco, its favor

oaks. Senator and Mrs. Leland
Stanford established their uni

The first parcel, bought in
1876. consisted of 650 acres
along San Francisquito Creek,
and subsequent purchases ran
the total to 8250 acres.
The whole of the Stanfords'
land was given to the University
in the 1885 Grant of Endow

should never be sold.
To this land. Senator Stanford
brought Francis Walker, presi

They gave serious thought to
locating the campus in the footh
ills of the ranch, so as to take
advantage of the magnificent
view of the bay, but they finally
decided to drive in a stake in the
grain fields below, at a point that
marks one corner of the Inner
Quadrangle. The senator felt the
flat site was more practical for
later expansion.
Olmsted worked out the gen

the buildings, but it remained for
the young Boston architect,
Charles Allerton Coolidge, to
develop this concept in the stvle

of his late mentor, Henry Hobbs
Richardson, considered the most

red When Senator Stanford died
in 1893. his widow determined
that the church would be built as

a memorial to him.
Mrs. Stanford chose the final
designs for windows and
mosaics, traveling to Italy to ap
prove the mosaic sketches, and
obtaining papal permission to
copy the Roselli fresco of the
"Last Supper" in the Sistine
Chapel.
The Venetian mosaics which
cover the interior walls are
largely Old Testament, depicting
the history of redemption. The
largest mosaic, however, occupies
most of the facade of the church
and. with 47 figures, depicts the
Sermon on the Mount.
After the earthquake of 1906,
the structure was completely
dismantled and rebuilt around a
steel framework. Another set of
mosaics was brought from Ven

ice. but the 80-foot spire, hous
ing clocks and chimes, was never
rebuilt.
Hoover's erection
The campus landmark, 285-
foot Hoover Tower, was dedi
cated at the University's 50th
anniversary in 1941. The tower
and the adjoining Lou Henry
Hoover Building (opened in
1967) house the vast documen
tary collections of the Hoover
Institution on War. Revolution
and Peace — millions of items
that include books, documents,
files, manuscripts, diaries, pam
phlets, posters, maps and photos.
The Herbert Hoover Memorial
Building, completed in 1978,
honors the former president's
humanitarian works.
Herbert Hoover started the
library collection during World

War I when he headed the
Commission tor Relief in Bel
gium. Struck with the thought
that his relief work placed him in
a position to document the war.
Hoover shipped crates of mate
rial lo the library at Stanford, his
alma mater, and laid the literary
foundation of the Hoover In
stitution.
At the 1941 ceremony.
Hoover said: "The purpose of
this institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a chal
lenge to those who promote war.
They should attract those who
search for peace."
I he Institution has more
material on communism than
can be found anywhere outside
Russia. It has more data on Mus
solini than can be found in Italy.
It also probably has the most
complete record on Hitler and
the Nazi movement extant.
With these resources, the in
stitution serves as a center for
advanced study and research on
problems til social, political and
economic change in the 20th
century.
World War I memorial
Across from Hoover Tower
sits Memorial Hall (Au
ditorium). dedicated in 1937.
Built primarily through student
contributions as a memorial to
Stanford students and faculty
slain in World War I.the au
ditorium also contains in the
lover plaques honoring the Stan
ford dead of World War 11. The

main auditorium scats I 700 and
the Little Theater seats 200.
Just south of the quad is White
Memorial Plaza, a 200,000
square foot landscaped area do
nated to the University by Mr
and Mrs. Raymond White in
memory of their sons. The local
point of the plaza is a tall, tree
form fountain executed in
bronze by San Francisco sculptor
Aristides Demetrios.
Bordered by the bookstore,
post office, Tresidder Memorial
Union, the music building and
the Old Union — which contains
several student services — the
plaza is a campus crossroads.
Tresidder, named in memory
of Donald Bertrand Tresidder,
alumnus and fourth president ot
the University, contains the
usual student union facilities ot
food service, small store, lounge
and student government offices.
In addition, it contains a com
munity center with meeting
rooms, music listening rooms, art
gallery and record, tape and
reading libraries.

New law school
The Stanford Law School has
been housed in Crown Quad
rangle since September 1975,
when President Gerland Ford
dedicated the $1 1.9 million facil
ity. The school resides in four
buildings: the Robert Crown lib
rary, which can seat the entire
law student body at the same
time; Frederick I. Richman Hall,
which contains the classrooms
and moot court; the James Irvine
Gallery, which contains the fa
culty and student meeting rooms
and lounges; and 600-person
Kresge Auditorium.
Behind the central campus,
the University operates its sci
ence "farms," the oldest of
which is the Jasper Ridge Biolog
ical Preserve. Rising steeply
trom Searsville Lake, the 735-
acre preserve contains a unique
association of rock ledges and
outcroppings, oak-dot ted
savannahs, chaparral, redwoods,
streams and pools. The preserve

is used regularly for teaching.
The Radioscience Laboratory
conducts at its antenna farm one
of the most productive and var
ied programs of ionospheric and
interplanetary radio investiga
tion. Its scientists made the first
radar contact with the sun.
The most spectacular of the
antennae, the 70-ton, 150-foot
diameter steel and aluminum
"Dish," has explored the sun,
planets and interplanetary gases
by means of a radar beam.
The Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC) oper

smasher on 460 acres along Sand
Hill Road. The $114 million
machine, financed by the Atomic
Fnergy Commission and com
pleted in 1966. fires the electron
down a straight, slender tube
rather than whirling protons in
circles, as most atom smashers
do. The machine develops an
energy of 20 billion electron
volts.
Stone age crumbles
As the'7os end. the University
draws to a close its so-called
"Second Great Stone Age," a
building boom launched in the

early '60s in which the Univer
sity has attempted to meet its big
post-war expansion in students
and faculty.
In the last 20 years, the Uni
versity has raised some $325
million to pay for new campus
facilities and improvements, in
cluding campus landmarks such
as Maples Pavilion, Meyer Lib
rary, the Green Library annex,
the Terman Engineering Center
and the Mudd chemistry build
ing.
Now. however, as the Univer
sity stabilizes its population, it
plans fewer major building pro
jects for the next 10 years.
The University's appearance
will not change dramatically in
the next decade, at least. Plans
are still tentative for a new music
facility behind Dinkelspiel Au-

ditorium. On the west side of
Lagunita Court, however, con
struction will soon begin on a
new $25 million, SOO-student
dormitory.
Also, a rather unexpected
event this year necessitated more
construction as the Storey
House, one of two all-women
dormitories on campus, was gut
ted by fire in March. The Univer
sity plans to rebuild the structure
soon, at an estimated cost of $ 1.4
million.
But construction projects such
as the new music center and
dormitory do depend largely on
the beneficience of University
donors (including the federal
government), and in this in
flationary age, the University
may have difficulty raising the
necessary funds.

Stanford may not always be as
lucky as it was this year, for in
stance, when a middle-aged
couple who like to jog in the area
donated $150,000 to renovate
and replant the "Oval" in front
of the main entrance.
If Stanford does attract the re
quired support, it might continue
to build right through the 100 th
anniversary of that day in 18S6
when Senator Stanford decided
to locate his new university on
the site of his horse farm.
The Senator felt that any land
good enough for breeding horses
ought to be good enough for
teaching students.
