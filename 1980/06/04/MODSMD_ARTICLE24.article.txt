# Summer conferences
## 
### Mike Charlson 
What do the Principles of
Christian Science. Podiatric
Dermatology and AAU Boxing
have in common?
Well, they are all among the
nearly 130 groups which will
hold conferences on the Farm
this summer.
Conferences this year are ex
pected to attract over 14,000
people, according to Conference
Manager Lois Fariello. and ac
commodating all those people is
quite a task. Fariello's staff in
cludes four full-time people year
'round. Three additional tem
porary employees are needed
during the heavy summer
months.
Unlike conference offices at
many other universities. Fariello
said heroffice isa"one-stop con
ference shopping center."
When a group wishes to hold a
conference at the University,
they contact Fariello's office, tell
her their needs, and she handles
the rest. Housing, meeting room
space, catering, banquets, par
ties or transportation are all
taken care of. "Anything the>
need, we'll help them get it."
It is this conference office ser
vice, Fariello said, that accounts
for the high number of annual
conferences held at the Univer
sity. Some 35 percent of the con
ferences this summer are repeat
gatherings.
The conference topics are var
ied. and so are their individual
requirements. Some weekend
seminar programs can need as
little as box lunches and some
auditorium space. Their cost can
be as low as $25 for participants.
Other conferees pay several
thousand dollars for a few weeks
of intense work in some of the
professional programs, like the
Stanford Executive Program

sponsored tor eight weeks by the
Graduate School ot Business.
Such programs have a host ot
special needs.
Among the more popular
programs are the annual coach
ing camps for young people.
Basketball and football are
taught to some 500 youngsters
by members of the varsity coach
ing staffs.
Other programs are more
technically oriented, like the an
nual course in opthalmology,
scheduled for June 29 through
August 30.
Some conferences, like
"Technology in America." July
IS to 20. are weekend affairs.
Others continue throughout the
summer, such as Psychiatry Prot.
William Dement's "Summer
Sleep Camp." June 22 to Sept. 7.
But no matter what the con
ference. almost every program
helps the University in several
ways. Fariello explained. The
conferences are often academi
cally oriented, she said, and to
have a national conference at the
University aids the University's
reputation in the academic
community.
The University's reputation is
also enhanced through many of
its less rigorous conferences. The
coaching camps for children and
other high school oriented prog
rams allow young people to sec
the campus and become familiar
with what it has to offer. The
same holds true for some of the
more convention-like programs
for adults.
And. besides the intangible
benefits, the conferences are. of
course, a big source of income,
especially for the Housing and
Food Services.
Fariello said the conferences
raise enough money through
summer programs to more than

make up the Housing and Food
Services deficit from the regular
academic year. Many academic
programs also benefit monetar
ily from conference sponsorship
in the summer months.
Fariello said the University's
reputation for conferences has
been steadily improving each
year, so that more and more con
ferences are held. Besides the
summer conferences, she said
her office coordinated some 185
conferences during the regular
academic year as well.
She said the conference office
is already booking into 1986.
with some programs planned
which will include over 1000 par
ticipants.
The conference programs will
be enhanced, she said, in a few
years when a new 800-unit stu
dent residence is opened west of
Lagunita Court. The complex,
scheduled for completion in time
for the 1983 summer programs,
will be nicely suited for some of
the- more prestigious profes
sional programs. "We're looking
for new ways of finding programs
which will fit in well with the
facility."
Indeed, the conference prog
ram is such an important
money-making source for Hous
ing and Food Services that the
committees working on the plans
for the new residence complex
often alter plans slightly to ac
commodate the conferences.

"If it doesn't hurt the students
to make some slight'modifica
tions, I'm all for it," said one stu
dent member of the Advisory
Committee on New Residences.
"Accommodating the confer

ences only makes sense. It keeps
the student room and board bills
from rising even faster. And this
complex is going to cost plenty.
So any help we can get is wel
comed with open arms."

little as box lunches and some
auditorium space. Their cost can
be as low as $25 for participants.
Other conferees pay several
thousand dollars for a few weeks
of intense work in some of the
professional programs, like the
Stanford Executive Program

sponsored tor eight weeks by the
Graduate School ot Business.
Such programs have a host ot
special needs.
Among the more popular
programs are the annual coach
ing camps for young people.
Basketball and football are
taught to some 500 youngsters
by members of the varsity coach
ing staffs.
Other programs are more
technically oriented, like the an
nual course in opthalmology,
scheduled for June 29 through
August 30.
Some conferences, like
"Technology in America." July
IS to 20. are weekend affairs.
Others continue throughout the
summer, such as Psychiatry Prot.
William Dement's "Summer
Sleep Camp." June 22 to Sept. 7.
But no matter what the con
ference. almost every program
helps the University in several
ways. Fariello explained. The
conferences are often academi
cally oriented, she said, and to
have a national conference at the
University aids the University's
reputation in the academic
community.
The University's reputation is
also enhanced through many of
its less rigorous conferences. The
coaching camps for children and
other high school oriented prog
rams allow young people to sec
the campus and become familiar
with what it has to offer. The
same holds true for some of the
more convention-like programs
for adults.
And. besides the intangible
benefits, the conferences are. of
course, a big source of income,
especially for the Housing and
Food Services.
Fariello said the conferences
raise enough money through
summer programs to more than

make up the Housing and Food
Services deficit from the regular
academic year. Many academic
programs also benefit monetar
ily from conference sponsorship
in the summer months.
Fariello said the University's
reputation for conferences has
been steadily improving each
year, so that more and more con
ferences are held. Besides the
summer conferences, she said
her office coordinated some 185
conferences during the regular
academic year as well.
She said the conference office
is already booking into 1986.
with some programs planned
which will include over 1000 par
ticipants.
The conference programs will
be enhanced, she said, in a few
years when a new 800-unit stu
dent residence is opened west of
Lagunita Court. The complex,
scheduled for completion in time
for the 1983 summer programs,
will be nicely suited for some of
the- more prestigious profes
sional programs. "We're looking
for new ways of finding programs
which will fit in well with the
facility."
Indeed, the conference prog
ram is such an important
money-making source for Hous
ing and Food Services that the
committees working on the plans
for the new residence complex
often alter plans slightly to ac
commodate the conferences.

"If it doesn't hurt the students
to make some slight'modifica
tions, I'm all for it," said one stu
dent member of the Advisory
Committee on New Residences.
"Accommodating the confer

ences only makes sense. It keeps
the student room and board bills
from rising even faster. And this
complex is going to cost plenty.
So any help we can get is wel
comed with open arms."

The American Indian Educators are just one of over 120 groups
who will hold conferences here this summer.
What do the Principles of
Christian Science. Podiatric
Dermatology and AAU Boxing
have in common?
Well, they are all among the
nearly 130 groups which will
hold conferences on the Farm
this summer.
Conferences this year are ex
pected to attract over 14,000
people, according to Conference
Manager Lois Fariello. and ac
commodating all those people is
quite a task. Fariello's staff in
cludes four full-time people year
'round. Three additional tem
porary employees are needed
during the heavy summer
months.
Unlike conference offices at
many other universities. Fariello
said heroffice isa"one-stop con
ference shopping center."
When a group wishes to hold a
conference at the University,
they contact Fariello's office, tell
her their needs, and she handles
the rest. Housing, meeting room
space, catering, banquets, par
ties or transportation are all
taken care of. "Anything the>
need, we'll help them get it."
It is this conference office ser
vice, Fariello said, that accounts
for the high number of annual
conferences held at the Univer
sity. Some 35 percent of the con
ferences this summer are repeat
gatherings.
The conference topics are var
ied. and so are their individual
requirements. Some weekend
seminar programs can need as
