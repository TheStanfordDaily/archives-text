# ASSU recycling project saves paper, cans... trees
## 
### Karen Springen 
Those big green bins outside your dorm are not
pretty trashcans â€” they're for recycling.
But many summer conferees and freshmen are
unfamiliar with the ASSU recycling project, said
the campus recycling center's public awareness
coordinator, Patrick McFadden.
He called recycling "efficient waste disposal."
Recycling reduces waste, conserves resources
and energy, raises community awareness and re
duces the need to use the Palo Alto landfill,
McFadden said.
They collect about 35,000 cans a month, said
McFadden. About two-thirds of these are beer
cans and Coors Brewing Co., one of the original
users of aluminum cans, buys back the cans.
The center basically recycles paper, cardboard,
aluminum and glass. Magazines, carbon paper,
glued boxes and waxed cardboard cannot be hand
led.
The government cites a 95 percent energy sav
ings from the use of recycled aluminum cans, ac
cording to McFadden.
The center also collects 10 tons of glass and 40
tons of mixed paper per month. The reuse of this
paper saves about 680 trees per month, he said.
Recycled paper is usually converted into
cardboard and used to make detergent and cereal
boxes. Higher quality paper, such as computer
sheets, is made into the top layer of boxes.

ASSU recycling began in January 1978. Its op
eration has saved the equivalent of 758 tons ot coal
or 151.656 gallons of gasoline, said McFadden.
adding that paper recycling here has saved the
equivalent of 13,500 trees.
McFadden said the recycling drive should be
constant. "When students leave Stanford, they
should want to continue to recycle."
There are 600 bins throughout the campus.
Set-ups usually include two paper bins, one
aluminum bin and one glass bin. The bins are not
for garbage, he stressed.
The project runs at a small deficit. Expenses
include the wages of the 20 employees.
Revenues are about $8360 per year, with mixed
paper providing $3410 of this revenue.
Aluminum makes up $1060 of this amount.
"Because of the labor involved in sorting
aluminum cans, they aren't quite as good as most
people think," said McFadden.
Employees must sort the cans, since tin and bi
metal cans cannot be handled here.
The center is located behind the firehouse and
the Food Research Institute in the trailer yard.
Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Satur
day.
The ASSU office in Tresidder is open 9 a.m. to 5
p.m., Monday through Friday. The goodwill trailer
is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday.
