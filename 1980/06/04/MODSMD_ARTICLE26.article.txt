# See the 'real' golden spike
## Campus galleries hold 'treasures' 
### 
Have you ever thought you'd
like to see the real "Golden
Spike"? Are you an avid con
chologist or mineralogist?
If so, you can find such trea
sures right here on campus.
Listed below are some little
known or often forgotten places
to \ isit when you feel in need of a
study break or want to do some
nearby exploring.
The Physics Explorama on the
second floor of the Varian
Physics Lab is a do-it-yourself
physics museum, with experi
ments and changing displays that
invite visitor participation. The
Explorama is open weekdays
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.. telephone
497-4233.
The I.eland Stanford Jr.

Museum has early American art,
oriental jade. Little Leland's
toys, a fantastic 91-piece exhibit
of Rodin sculpture, and yes. the
actual "Golden Spike." which
I.eland Stanford and his fellow
railroad magnates pounded into
the rails at the joining of the
transcontinental railroad. The
museum Is open Tuesday
through Friday 10 a.m. to 4:45
p.m., and admission is free.
Tours are available Tuesdav at
12:15 p.m. and Sundays at 2 p.m.
The Art Gallery, located bet
ween Hoover Tower and the
Quad, houses smaller, changing
exhibits. Admission to the Gal
lery, open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tuesday through Friday, and 1
p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sun

day. also is tree.
For a quiet place to stroll or
just to sit and think, you might
\ isit the Stanford family
mausoleum, or the nearby cactus
gardens, both found in the
northeast section of the Ar
boretum. It's different . . . and
actually quite lovely.
And. perhaps for rainy days,
anyone who's ever combed a
beach will enjoy the conchotomy
(sea shell) collection tucked up
under the eaves on the third floor
of Geology Corner (in the Quad,
room 341). You can stop by from
y a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through
Friday, except during lunchtime.
Telephone 497-2537.
Another collection — thanks
again to the Geology Dept. -
may be found upstairs in Mitch
ell Earth Sciences Building, right
outside the library, where a dis
play of spectacular minerals

from all over the world is on
\ iew.
In the lobby of the Coffee
House in Tresidder, you can
often find a photograph exhibit
that features the work of local
artists. The exhibits usually in
clude landscapes and "human in
terest" candid shots in black and
white.
And the University's Rare
Book Collection is kept in the
Bender Room of the Main Lib
rary — a cluttered, interesting
browsing room filled with an
tiques. The Benter Room is open
Monday through Friday. N a.m.
to 5 p.m.. and Saturdav 9 a.m. to
12 p.m.. 497-4054.
Keep these little "get-aways"
in mind. The next time you need
to stop fidgeting or escape from
the books — but haven't the time
or money to make it farther than
your own "back yard" — they
may be just the thing.
