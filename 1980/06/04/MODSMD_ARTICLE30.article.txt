## 
### Joan O'Connell 
It would be a shame tor any
one to leave Stanford without
spending at least one night "on
the tow n" in one of the greatest
towns in the world . . San Fran
cisco.
Unfortunately some see the
City by simply rushing about to
all the tourist-map highlights,
squeezing onto a cable car. and
checking out the North Beach
scene. They may have seen San
Francisco on the surface, but to
really see it. you've got to look a
little deeper.
With all its diversity. San
Francisco has very unique and
positive attractions for each vis
itor who takes the time to seek
them out.
Of the many who come to the
City — the name by which resi
dents refer to their home —
those who wander quietly
through its neighborhoods,
down its side streets, into its
parks and along its waterfront,
sense that there is something
quite special about it. Indeed
San Francisco is a city ol
neighborhoods. In each ol the
do/ens ot districts, trom the Sun
set district bv the beach to Rus

sian Hill, one can find establish
ments. services and attitudes de
signed lor the particular and
sometimes even peculiar needs
of those who live there.
Explore them one by one.
An interesting pocket in the
City, and one sometimes ignored
on "official" tourist maps, is the
Mission District. Home of the
historic Mission Dolores and rol

4 San Francisco is a world to explore, it is a
place where the heart can go on a delightful
adventure. It is a city in which the spirit can
know refreshment every day. y

also a center tor the City's His
panic population. Although it'
an older area, the Mission Dis
trict is 11111 of life and charm. an<
most San I raneiscans agree it ha
just about the best weather o
any area.
The North Beach area
situated between Columbus A\
enue and Telegraph Hill, otter'
Italian coffee houses, bakerie

and truttorie. In Washington
Square Park, the local residents
like to take in the noontime sun.
Although the nightclubs along
Broadway Street, including The
Condor — home of Carol Doda
— have brought the most fame to
the area, visitors should also be
away ot its cultural attractions,
including bookstores, art gal
leries and international restaur-

ants.
Around Castro Street below
Market, the shops and restaur
ants cater mainly to the local gay
community. What was once a
quiet, actually decling neighbor
hood has become an important
cultural and political center. The
area's many Victorian-style
homes and sidewalk businesses
have been refurbished and reno
vated. making the small com

munity one of the Cit\°s most at
tractive. Crossing from Castro
Street in Eureka \ u 11 e\ to 24th
Street in Noe \ allev (the two dis
tricts were named for the twin
peaks which tower above the
Citv to the west), one will ob
serve another area which is com
ing to life. Be sure to stop at 24th
and Castro Streets for a taste ot
the original Bud's ice cream .it
his corner store.
Most of San Francisco's
Chinese community can he
found in Chinatown, a 16-
square-block area bounded by
Stockton. Kearny. Bush and
Broadway Streets. Walking up
Grant Street, one will see the
"touristy" side of ( hinatown,
with its jewelry stores and
souvenir stands, but the side
streets also contain some in
teresting sights, such as
tearooms. Chinese schools, and
theaters.
Those seeking a taste ot
Japanese culture should stop by
the Japan Center at (jough ant
Geary, where one can linti
Japanese restaurants, shops ant:
cultural attractions.
