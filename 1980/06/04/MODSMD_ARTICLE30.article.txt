# Exploring San Francisco
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
It would be a shame tor any
one to leave Stanford without
spending at least one night "on
the tow n" in one of the greatest
towns in the world . . San Fran
cisco.
Unfortunately some see the
City by simply rushing about to
all the tourist-map highlights,
squeezing onto a cable car. and
checking out the North Beach
scene. They may have seen San
Francisco on the surface, but to
really see it. you've got to look a
little deeper.
With all its diversity. San
Francisco has very unique and
positive attractions for each vis
itor who takes the time to seek
them out.
Of the many who come to the
City — the name by which resi
dents refer to their home —
those who wander quietly
through its neighborhoods,
down its side streets, into its
parks and along its waterfront,
sense that there is something
quite special about it. Indeed
San Francisco is a city ol
neighborhoods. In each ol the
do/ens ot districts, trom the Sun
set district bv the beach to Rus

sian Hill, one can find establish
ments. services and attitudes de
signed lor the particular and
sometimes even peculiar needs
of those who live there.
Explore them one by one.
An interesting pocket in the
City, and one sometimes ignored
on "official" tourist maps, is the
Mission District. Home of the
historic Mission Dolores and rol

4 San Francisco is a world to explore, it is a
place where the heart can go on a delightful
adventure. It is a city in which the spirit can
know refreshment every day. y

also a center tor the City's His
panic population. Although it'
an older area, the Mission Dis
trict is 11111 of life and charm. an<
most San I raneiscans agree it ha
just about the best weather o
any area.
The North Beach area
situated between Columbus A\
enue and Telegraph Hill, otter'
Italian coffee houses, bakerie

and truttorie. In Washington
Square Park, the local residents
like to take in the noontime sun.
Although the nightclubs along
Broadway Street, including The
Condor — home of Carol Doda
— have brought the most fame to
the area, visitors should also be
away ot its cultural attractions,
including bookstores, art gal
leries and international restaur-

ants.
Around Castro Street below
Market, the shops and restaur
ants cater mainly to the local gay
community. What was once a
quiet, actually decling neighbor
hood has become an important
cultural and political center. The
area's many Victorian-style
homes and sidewalk businesses
have been refurbished and reno
vated. making the small com

munity one of the Cit\°s most at
tractive. Crossing from Castro
Street in Eureka \ u 11 e\ to 24th
Street in Noe \ allev (the two dis
tricts were named for the twin
peaks which tower above the
Citv to the west), one will ob
serve another area which is com
ing to life. Be sure to stop at 24th
and Castro Streets for a taste ot
the original Bud's ice cream .it
his corner store.
Most of San Francisco's
Chinese community can he
found in Chinatown, a 16-
square-block area bounded by
Stockton. Kearny. Bush and
Broadway Streets. Walking up
Grant Street, one will see the
"touristy" side of ( hinatown,
with its jewelry stores and
souvenir stands, but the side
streets also contain some in
teresting sights, such as
tearooms. Chinese schools, and
theaters.
Those seeking a taste ot
Japanese culture should stop by
the Japan Center at (jough ant
Geary, where one can linti
Japanese restaurants, shops ant:
cultural attractions.
There are other tireat areas toi
strollers. Past the shops and
many restaurants on Clement
Street, one will come to the Leg
ion of Honor, a museum which
commands a sweeping \ iev\ of
the Golden Gate Bridge.
A walk down Union Street
west of Van Ness will take you
past antique shops, boutiques
and singles bars; a walk down
Polk between Broadway and
Sutter will give you a glimpse ot
more antique shops and, like the
Castro area, a good number ol
gay bars. Stopping in the art gal
leries in the downtown area near
Cirant. Post and Sutter, can also
be a pleasant way to spend a
quiet afternoon.
Don't forget to stop by Nob
Hill, where the peaks of Califor
nia. Sacramento, Jones and
Taylor Streets meet. The place
where men who made their tor

tunes in gold and railroads lived
in the latter part of the 1 9th cen
tury (including I.eland Stan
lord). Nob Hill now offers such
attractions as Grace Cathedral, a
look at the outside of the Bohe
mian Club and, ot course, the
magnificent hotels. Walking
through the Fairmont or the
Mark Hopkins or the Stanford
Court, try to imagine a San Fran
cisco of days gone bv.
You won't want to stop explor
ing until you're craned your neck
to see the beautiful homes in
some of the finest districts —
Pacific Heights, the Marina and,
on the other side of the City. St.
Francis Wood.
In each of these many areas,
you'll discover a favorite re
staurant. a special place to have
coffee, or a unique vista. Make
note ot the places you want to

revisit. That's what getting to
know San Francisco is all about.
But of course there are other
things to do in San Francisco,
famous and popular because
they're interesting and fun.
Fisherman's Wharf is one ol
these places, often as popular
with natives as it is for tourists
because of its art galleries, street
performers, and amusements.
Although most natives choose to
eat their seafood in less-known,
less-expensive and often more
relaxed settings, a first-timer's
trip to the whart without eating
at Scoma'sor Alioto's Number *-)
or Sabella's might leave one
wondering.
A fairly new spot also worth
checking out is Pier 39. a reno
vated pier now holding restaur
ants. shops and galleries instead
of cargo. Designed with the
tourist in mind, the complex's
prices are outrageously expen
sive. but there's fun for all at an
arcade and carousel, and it's cer
tainly worth seeing.
And of course, don't forget
Golden Gate Park, a day's ex
cursion in itself. Besides woods
and frisbec fields and stables and
toy boat lakes and a real buffalo
preserve and bike paths that
wind around the park down to
the Pacific Ocean, some sav it

just doesn't have anything to
offer . . . hut don't believe them.
One of the most beautiful and
largest city parks in the country,
it also offers a Japanese Tea
Garden, the M.H. DeYoung
Museum, and the California
Academy of Sciences, with its
aquarium, terrarium and
planetarium. For those of you
caught up in the roller disco fad.
Fulton Street on the park's north
side is generally lined with skate
rental \ans. especially on the
weekends, and areas in the park
have been set aside for skaters.
Another interesting and his
toric spot is Fort Point beneath
the south end of the Golden
Gate Bridge. Built by the U.S.
Army during the Civil War. it
was once the principal defense
base on the West Coast. It's now
a national monument and open
lor tours. Be sure to dress
warmly, though; the winds
whipping through the gate — the
Golden Gate that is — are very
strong and \erv chilly.
When you come to the end of
your last day in San Francisco,
and are sitting in the Buena Vista
with an Irish coffee, or spying
one of the best views available,
from the top ol Coit Tower on
Telegraph Hill, remember where
vou left vour heart.

eat their seafood in less-known,
less-expensive and often more
relaxed settings, a first-timer's

revisit. That's what getting to
know San Francisco is all about.
But of course there are other
things to do in San Francisco,
famous and popular because
they're interesting and fun.
Fisherman's Wharf is one ol
these places, often as popular
with natives as it is for tourists
because of its art galleries, street
performers, and amusements.
Although most natives choose to
eat their seafood in less-known,
less-expensive and often more
relaxed settings, a first-timer's
trip to the whart without eating
at Scoma'sor Alioto's Number *-)
or Sabella's might leave one
wondering.
A fairly new spot also worth
checking out is Pier 39. a reno
vated pier now holding restaur
ants. shops and galleries instead
of cargo. Designed with the
tourist in mind, the complex's
prices are outrageously expen
sive. but there's fun for all at an
arcade and carousel, and it's cer
tainly worth seeing.
And of course, don't forget
Golden Gate Park, a day's ex
cursion in itself. Besides woods
and frisbec fields and stables and
toy boat lakes and a real buffalo
preserve and bike paths that
wind around the park down to
the Pacific Ocean, some sav it

just doesn't have anything to
offer . . . hut don't believe them.
One of the most beautiful and
largest city parks in the country,
it also offers a Japanese Tea
Garden, the M.H. DeYoung
Museum, and the California
Academy of Sciences, with its
aquarium, terrarium and
planetarium. For those of you
caught up in the roller disco fad.
Fulton Street on the park's north
side is generally lined with skate
rental \ans. especially on the
weekends, and areas in the park
have been set aside for skaters.
Another interesting and his
toric spot is Fort Point beneath
the south end of the Golden
Gate Bridge. Built by the U.S.
Army during the Civil War. it
was once the principal defense
base on the West Coast. It's now
a national monument and open
lor tours. Be sure to dress
warmly, though; the winds
whipping through the gate — the
Golden Gate that is — are very
strong and \erv chilly.
When you come to the end of
your last day in San Francisco,
and are sitting in the Buena Vista
with an Irish coffee, or spying
one of the best views available,
from the top ol Coit Tower on
Telegraph Hill, remember where
vou left vour heart.
It would be a shame tor any
one to leave Stanford without
spending at least one night "on
the tow n" in one of the greatest
towns in the world . . San Fran
cisco.
Unfortunately some see the
City by simply rushing about to
all the tourist-map highlights,
squeezing onto a cable car. and
checking out the North Beach
scene. They may have seen San
Francisco on the surface, but to
really see it. you've got to look a
little deeper.
With all its diversity. San
Francisco has very unique and
positive attractions for each vis
itor who takes the time to seek
them out.
Of the many who come to the
City — the name by which resi
dents refer to their home —
those who wander quietly
through its neighborhoods,
down its side streets, into its
parks and along its waterfront,
sense that there is something
quite special about it. Indeed
San Francisco is a city ol
neighborhoods. In each ol the
do/ens ot districts, trom the Sun
set district bv the beach to Rus

sian Hill, one can find establish
ments. services and attitudes de
signed lor the particular and
sometimes even peculiar needs
of those who live there.
Explore them one by one.
An interesting pocket in the
City, and one sometimes ignored
on "official" tourist maps, is the
Mission District. Home of the
historic Mission Dolores and rol

4 San Francisco is a world to explore, it is a
place where the heart can go on a delightful
adventure. It is a city in which the spirit can
know refreshment every day. y
William Saroxan

ling Dolores Park, this district i
also a center tor the City's His
panic population. Although it'
an older area, the Mission Dis
trict is 11111 of life and charm. an<
most San I raneiscans agree it ha
just about the best weather o
any area.
The North Beach area
situated between Columbus A\
enue and Telegraph Hill, otter'
Italian coffee houses, bakerie

and truttorie. In Washington
Square Park, the local residents
like to take in the noontime sun.
Although the nightclubs along
Broadway Street, including The
Condor — home of Carol Doda
— have brought the most fame to
the area, visitors should also be
away ot its cultural attractions,
including bookstores, art gal
leries and international restaur-

ants.
Around Castro Street below
Market, the shops and restaur
ants cater mainly to the local gay
community. What was once a
quiet, actually decling neighbor
hood has become an important
cultural and political center. The
area's many Victorian-style
homes and sidewalk businesses
have been refurbished and reno
vated. making the small com

munity one of the Cit\°s most at
tractive. Crossing from Castro
Street in Eureka \ u 11 e\ to 24th
Street in Noe \ allev (the two dis
tricts were named for the twin
peaks which tower above the
Citv to the west), one will ob
serve another area which is com
ing to life. Be sure to stop at 24th
and Castro Streets for a taste ot
the original Bud's ice cream .it
his corner store.
Most of San Francisco's
Chinese community can he
found in Chinatown, a 16-
square-block area bounded by
Stockton. Kearny. Bush and
Broadway Streets. Walking up
Grant Street, one will see the
"touristy" side of ( hinatown,
with its jewelry stores and
souvenir stands, but the side
streets also contain some in
teresting sights, such as
tearooms. Chinese schools, and
theaters.
Those seeking a taste ot
Japanese culture should stop by
the Japan Center at (jough ant
Geary, where one can linti
Japanese restaurants, shops ant:
cultural attractions.
There are other tireat areas toi
strollers. Past the shops and
many restaurants on Clement
Street, one will come to the Leg
ion of Honor, a museum which
commands a sweeping \ iev\ of
the Golden Gate Bridge.
A walk down Union Street
west of Van Ness will take you
past antique shops, boutiques
and singles bars; a walk down
Polk between Broadway and
Sutter will give you a glimpse ot
more antique shops and, like the
Castro area, a good number ol
gay bars. Stopping in the art gal
leries in the downtown area near
Cirant. Post and Sutter, can also
be a pleasant way to spend a
quiet afternoon.
Don't forget to stop by Nob
Hill, where the peaks of Califor
nia. Sacramento, Jones and
Taylor Streets meet. The place
where men who made their tor

tunes in gold and railroads lived
in the latter part of the 1 9th cen
tury (including I.eland Stan
lord). Nob Hill now offers such
attractions as Grace Cathedral, a
look at the outside of the Bohe
mian Club and, ot course, the
magnificent hotels. Walking
through the Fairmont or the
Mark Hopkins or the Stanford
Court, try to imagine a San Fran
cisco of days gone bv.
You won't want to stop explor
ing until you're craned your neck
to see the beautiful homes in
some of the finest districts —
Pacific Heights, the Marina and,
on the other side of the City. St.
Francis Wood.
In each of these many areas,
you'll discover a favorite re
staurant. a special place to have
coffee, or a unique vista. Make
note ot the places you want to
