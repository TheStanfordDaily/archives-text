# Stop and sip for awhile... on a winetasting excursion
## 
### 
Visiting and touring a winery
can he an enjoyable part of any
stay in the Bay area, or for that
matter. Northern California.
\ ery few areas in this part of the
state do not have at least one
winery nearby, and the Penin
sula is no exception.
Several wineries are situated
within a few miles of the Univer
sity. Kir those who do not have
the means to visit the fabled
Napa vintners or the wineries to
the south, the local establish
ments otter good wines in a
pleasant atmosphere.
Because, however, they are all
quite small, it is prudent to call
ahead to ensure that someone is
around to tzive a talk on their

wines â€” not to mention a taste of
them as well.
Page Mill Winery is tin Page
Mill Road, not lar beyond In
terstate 2SO; Sherrill Cellars is
under the post office in Wood
side; and Woodside Vineyards is
a halt mile up Kings Mountain
Road, toward Huddart Park.
Each of these wineries, which
usually open lor tasting one
weekend a month, reflect the
family-operation approach that
is blossoming elsewhere in the
United States. They do not make
very much wine, and therefore
they can sell it on the premises
without the added expense of
distributors and retailers. They
also do not pretend to make

wines tor a mass market, and
thus can make their products
with distinctive tastes and smells.
All three winemakers are
charming and knowledgeable
people, making visits to their
wineries a real delight.
Another close and hospitable
area for sampling wines may be
found south of Stanford in the
Santa Clara Valley. Paul Mas
son. Mirassou and other large
vintners have tine tour programs
and elegant tasting rooms, and
they offer several excellent wines
for sampling.
A little farther south, the
Hecker Pass wineries provide an
interesting contrast to those in
the valley; instead of technology
and corporate capital, one finds
in Hecker Pass a love for the soil
and the painstaking traditions
that go into the making of their
wines.
Hecker Pass is about a 45-
minute drive from Stanford.
From U.S. 101, drive into Mor
gan Hill and turn right on State
Route 152, toward Watsonville.
Follow the highway to where it
deadends in Hecker Pass Road.
At that point, several wineries
are within walking distance of
one another. Picnic areas are
convenient, and the rolling hills
make bicycle exploration of the
area very pleasant.
The Live Oak winery has a
fascinating tasting room and a
very colorful owner, Peter Scag
lioti, who concentrates on mak
ing inexpensive jug wines.
The Bertero winery has more
of a space-age architectural style
and a wider range of wines to
sample, but its hosts do not have
Scaglioti's somewhat unusual
philosophies about life.
The Fortino and Hecker Pass
wineries are owned by brothers
who hate each other, but they
make good, hearty red wines.
Back along the highway, there

is kirigan Cellars, where one can
taste their Malvasia Bianca. and
Sycamore Cellars, off the Uvas
Road turnoff.
For the more adventurous of
palate-pleasers, the Napa-
Sonoma-Mendocino counties
offer beautiful countryside and
more wineries than you could
visit in a week. These establish
ments produce much of Califor
nia's varietal wines.
To get to the famous "wine
country," follow Highway 101
up to San Francisco, across the
Golden Gate Bridge, well past
San Rafael, until the signs start
directing you to Napa. Sonoma,
St. Helena and other small towns
famous for their line grapes and
wines. Or travel farther north to
Guerneville and Healdsburg,
also the home of some excellent
wineries.
Its best to locate a good map
lor these excursions, as roads to

the wineries are often off the
beaten path. You may also have
to depend on the friendly natives
for directions, although rest as
sured, you'll know you're in
"wine country" right away by the
rows and rws of grapes planted
in the vineyards along the road.
As points of reference, and re
portedly good tours, you might
want to check out the Christian
Brothers winers in St. Helena,
and Korbel & Brothers winery in
Guerneville. In Mendocino
County, a tour of the Weibel
wineries is always fun, although
you should be prepared for a
rather lengthy journey, as Red
wood Valley is quite a ways
north.
Be prepared to pay a price af
the more famous wineries, as
they sometimes suffer tor their
fame. On weekends they are
often verv crowded, and some
