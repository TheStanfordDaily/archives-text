LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive: at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are

unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an /tors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Poirttes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d thnitres an Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered. Noisette d'Agneau an
Porto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1^3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
ehocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 Kl Camino Real
Redwood Citv
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
onlv up in the City. Dining is
fairly formal, and a jacket and tie
is considered the appropriate at
tire for men. The menu is large
and represents a well-chosen
selection of traditional continen
tal recipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 or ShO dinner bill
for two. it would be just as easv

to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites — 22 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis and Chicken Saute with ar
tichokes only begin to suggest all
the bases covered.
For dessert, consider the

French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two).
Chocolate Mousse ($.95) and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
Continental
HENRY'S
482 University Ave.

Palo Alio
326-5680
Well. Henry's is great.
Everything here is flawlessly
prepared. And it the food lacks
the inspiration of a top-flight
French restaurant, the generous
proportions, fair prices and great
atmosphere more than compen
sate. Entrees are priced between
$5 and $<S, and come with a
choice of homemade soup or
house salad.
The house salad was crisp, re

freshing and served with a chilled
fork.
Sole Florentine, one of the
daily specials, comprised two
large pieces of sole, resting on a
bed of fresh spinach and covered
with a light wine sauce. Perfectly
cooked vegetables and better
than-average rice accompanied
the sole.
Emince de Veau Zurich (veal
Zurich-style) is another sure bet
at Henry's. The real character of
the ingredients, moreover, is not
masked by heavy sauces. Both
oversalting and oversaucing are
frequent faults of even the best
French restaurants.
Have a drink at the bar or a
meal in the back room.
Henry's. It's mighty fine.
MODESTO LANZONE'S
Ghirardelli Square
San Francisco
771-2SBO
Modesto Lanzone specializes
in Italian cuisine of central and
northern Italy.
Seven antipasti dishes range in
price from $3.95 to $5.50. Two
little-known dishes. Caponadda
al tonno (tuna, tomatoes and on
ions) and Insalata di mare (mari
nated squid with shrimp) reflect
the important influence of the
sea in the Italian kitchen.
Like most other Italian re
staurants in America, Modesto's
pasta dishes are designed to be
complete meals. In this case, the
waiter's advice is worth heeding:
split the pasta dish. The Ag
nolotti alia crema (round disks ot
pasta stuffed with chicken,
cheese and ham), Gnocchi Verdi
al sugo (small potato flower
dumplings). Guanciali al Funghi
(pillows of pasta with ricotta and
mushrooms) are among the
more exotic pasta offerings. Our
top recommendation is Pan:.otti
alia crema di noci stile maluelina
(stuffed pasta with ricotta and
walnut sauce).
The regular, mixed green
salad, a la carte, is $1.95.
A wide variety of main courses
fills out Modesto's menu.
The desserts included the
standard (aire of ice-cream,
zubaglione. sherbert and creme
caramel.
The waiters, many of whom
are Italians, add a touch of the
old country.
Hearty portions, soft
candlelight and the quiet charm
of the lights of the Bay make
Modesto's well worth returning
to.
THE GATEHOUSE
265 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
326-1330
The Gatehouse is quietly eleg
ant — somewhere in between a
French country inn and an exclu

sive British club. You can relax
in a pampered world of starched
linen, fresh flowers and
candlelight and wine. Not that
the food isn't good— it is. hut it's
the ambiance, not the cuisine,
that you'll remember.
The dinner menu offers a
choice of salads, steaks, seafood
and daily specials such as Beef
Wellington ($11) and Stuffed
Trout ($9.75). Scandinavian
Koltbords — a platter of assorted
fruits, cheeses, meats, seafood
and break ($l2 for two; $6.50
lor one) provide a unique dinner
alternative.
Dessert was the high point of
the meal; Cheesecake, assorted
cakes and pastries (all $1.60).
various flavors of Rick's Rather
Rich Ice Cream ($1.25) and
Creme Caramel ($1.50 easily
triumph over your calorific con
science.
The Gatehouse also has a huge
wooden bar with an equally
elegant, yet quiet atmosphere.
The Gatehouse is open for

dinner from 5:30 p.m.; for lunch
from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;
and for Sunday Brunch from 10
a.m. until 2:30 p.m.
MA DDA LENA'S CONTI
NENTAL
544 emerson
Palo Alto
326-6082
Now in its second year and
boasting a growing, devoted
clientele, Maddalena's is a must
for any self-professed French or
Italian gourmet.
Maddalena's offers salads a la
carte, such as spinach ($5.50 for
two), mushroom ($5), Caesar
($5.50 for two) and Butter Let
tuce with seafood ($4.95).
The entree list most clearly re
veals Maddalena's continental
variety and ranges from such fish
dishes as Sole Meuniere ($9.95)
and Sole Florentine with Shrimp
($10.50) to Chic ken al Forno Ar
turo ($8.25) and Steak Sinatra.
Just as the excellent cuisine
and reasonable prices remind
one of bygone days, so too does
Maddalena's decor — soft blue
walls and earpeting, gold framed
pictures, beautifully painted sc
reens and chandeliers.
Maddalena's is open Tues.
thru Sat. from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. and 6-10 p.m.
Mexican
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Erancisco
928-2279
El Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callos a
la Madrilena (Tripe Madrid

style, $2.50) Dabadana As
turiana (casserole of white
beans, ham, chorizo and park,
$2.75) and Chorizo Salteado
(sauteed chorizo, $2.50) are
three of the rarer items in the
appetizer category. Calamines
Rebozados (breaded baby squid
with lemon) is a best buy at
$2.50. A huge plate of the squid
would have been more than
enough for a main course. And
they were excellent.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.
Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana. a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The

Paella Marinera ($ 16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled
lamb, $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,
the Budin de Pan (bread pud
ding) or the Natillas ( special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
948-9865
The best Mexican restaurant
in the Stanford area is La Estrel
lita. Estrellita, located on San
Antonio and El Camino, means

"little star," but it deserves four
big ones.
It used to be that Estrellita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.
Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile relienos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3), with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
ic. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
I cannot recommend Estrellita
highly enough. But a word ol
caution: it is difficult to manage

more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie hags.
You could get by easily with
$4.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it, in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive, and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching $20 for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
almost anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are
particularly noteworthy. Espe
ciallv delightful is I a Posada
Tostada. which is probabK the
biggest tostada you've ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and order
only one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are servec
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop
ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
11 p.m.
Asian
Mi l KIANG
895 Villa Street
Mountain View
969-3232
Among the great conglomera
tion of inauthentic.
•"Americanized" Chinese re
staurants strung out from San
Francisco to Sunnyvale, there is
a unique Chinese dining experi
ence in Mountain View. Mui
Kiang (Mwee Kee-vang) is the
only restaurant in the United
States that features the distin
guished Hakka cuisine.

Freshness of ingredients and
precision in the dishes' prepara
tion are the ke>s to Hakka food.
Sauces and spices are used to en
hance. rather than smother, the
ingredients. Thus Hakka food
successfully combines the dis
tinctive characteristics of Can
tonese. Mandarin and other
st\les of Chinese cooking.
Appetizers at Mui kiang are
both exotic and imaginative.
The excellent Special Beef
Soup, the chefs own recipe, is
yet another example of the
creativity in which the Hakka
chefs take pride.
Mui kiang's Salt-Baked Chic
ken is a house specialty called
""the most popular dish in Hong
Kong." Seasoned only with sea
salt, it has unparalled succu
lence.
CHEF CHI \S
Corner of El Camino Real and
San Antonio Road
Los Altos
948-2696
Offering Mandarin and Can
tonese cuisine. Chef C'hu's is ex
tremely popular with Stanford

people because it combines un
commonly good service with
soma of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss the mu shu
pork, which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it is distinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a In carle
items for lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any of their
"specialties." And if there's a
dish not on the menu. Chu will
prepare it specially.
THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a half years old. is establish
ing a reputation for excellent
Chinese food. Samson Chu

and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Manda
rin and Hunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner which
include old favorites but also
offer manv specialties.
