LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
University and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it is the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and they are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator,
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily, this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive: at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are

unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an /tors d'oeuvre,
Mousseline de Saint Jacques aux
Poirttes d'asperges (mousse of
scallops in lobster sauce with as
paragus spears — $6.50) and
Feuillete d thnitres an Curry
(baked oyster in curry sauce in
pastry — $6.95) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered. Noisette d'Agneau an
Porto (lamb in port wine sauce
— $ 1^3.75) was truly exceptional,
offering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the
prsentation of this dish.
A good cross-section of de
sserts includes hot or cold Souf
fle Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse an
ehocolat and selected cheeses.
L'AUBERGE
2826 Kl Camino Real
Redwood Citv
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge, may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you'd expect to find
