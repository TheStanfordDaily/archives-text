Sunday brunch 9:30 a.m. - 2 p.m.
The Holiday Inn advertises its Sunday brunch as
"The Peninsula's Most Famous Buffet with One
Complimentary Glass of Champagne." and it
really is wonderful. Your senses can be easily over
whelmed by the selection and the sheer quantities
of the dishes offered. Do take your time and try to
sample each one.
Your party will be seated by the maitre d' at a
white tablecloth-covered table in one of the two
rooms, the larger of which is vaguely reminiscent ot
a Middle Eastern tent. Your waiter will ask when
you would care for your glass of champagne and,
having decided, you head for the buffet.
The long, tiered table with large flower ar
rangements and decoratively placed dishes is an
inviting sight. lake a warm plate (too warm lor
your first course of Iruit and rolls), a bit of butter,
and a glass of orange, tomato or grapefruit juice.
Move 011 and dip your hand into the baskets ol
sweet rolls, danishes and muffins; the banana-nut
bread is particularly good.
The fruit selection is marvelous — fresh pineap
ple. cantaloupe, honey dew melons, watermelon
and strawberries; stewed peaches and prunes;
grapefruit, baked apples, and a 11 uit salad. Papayas
I and tigs are a special treat. There is also cottage
cheese.
Our plates were heaped by this time, so we re

turned to our tabic to sip champagne and enjoy our
selections.
The chet shines on the warm plates. Besides the
usual brunch tare of scrambled eggs, eggs Be
nedict. bacon, sausage, and hash brown potatoes,
we found chicken crepes in a supreme sauce, rolled
filet of sole in white wine sauce with shrimp, sliced
ham and rice. The chicken crepes were very good,
and we enjoyed the sole and eggs Benedict. The
sauces were excellent.
We had more than outdone ourselves but were
drawn to the dessert buffet. The offerings range
from a simple dish of jello to caramel creme. pretty
lrench patisseries, and large bowls ot chocolate
mousse. The mousse was our favorite, and we each
had at least one of the delightful patisseries, which
each tasted as wonderful as it looked.
Throughout, our waiter was most attentive, de
spite its being a particularly busy Sunday, and he
kept our places cleared and our coffee cups full. We
were disappointed by the plate ol plastic cream
containers on our table. A small jug ot cream
would have been much nicer.
The Holiday Inn in Palo Alto is \ cry proud of its
brunch and with good reason. I'hey make every
thing from the flower arrangements right down to
the French patisseries. Hverythmg was delicious
and beautifully laid out. It is somewhat noisy, but
the large turnover is necessary il such a buffet is to
be offered for only $7.95 per person.
The brunch is every Sunday from 9:30 a.m. to 2
p.m. and is a fantastic place for a special outing with
friends or \ isiting family. Reservations are a must.
