ALEX'S MOUNTAIN HOUSE
13808 Skyline Blvd.
Woodside
851-9971
To reach Alex's Mountain House on a
stormy night, visitors must know their desti
nation. Out of the fog on wooded Skyline
Drive, a large sign and yellow lights welcome
you.
Inside the main room it is dim. but a tire
glows and spreads warmth. Couches, an
L-shaped bar. and small tables give locals
sitting space to share talk. A lively noise en
sues from the young crowd that is clad in
jeans in flannel shirts.
Citv people beware! Settling in to this
backwoods establishment makes you feel as
it you are entering a mountain dweller's life.
For effect, tiffany lamps cast light on
antique-style mirrors. Several old pianos sit
as decorations, not in tune to be played. In
lieu, a brightly-lit jukebox spews '50s music
and jazz.
Casual greetings lead to accommodating
service at the entrance to the back room. The
theme of this dining room is red. White win
dow casings accent the brick-red walls. Red
lanterns illuminate red-clothed tables, yield
ing just enough light to read by.
At a glance, home cooking made novel
with sauces and stuffings describes Alex's
menu. It welcomes you with appetizers trom
the sea: tresh Long Island oysters or a shrimp
cocktail. II you prefer, try an artichoke
"steamed fresh 112 rom Pescadero" with melted
butter or mayonnaise.

Then choose from fish, shellfish, chicken,
lamb, beef or vegetarian dishes. Let your
mood decide a sauce and your dish. Alex's
also gives you a white wine cream sauce with
a hint of currv; hollandaise; orange-honey
glazes; mint sauces and other homemade
combinations.
Although the regular menu features less
than 10 entrees, variety tempts you. And
there are surprises! When your waitress exp
lains the evening specials, ask about the
freshness of that dish that especially appeals
to you. This is a key to your delight in dinner.
A loaf of crusty, browned bread, freshly
baked and still warm, accompanies a large
garden salad. Diners toss and help them
selves to the tresh ureens and to the jar ot

homemade dressing.
1 praise Alex's evening specials. The ap
petizer of marinated crab proved tender and
flavorful. No salty taste or stringy meat here.
Also, the rabbit baked in cream sauce and
topped with real bacon pieces won points. A
stock base used before the rabbit is smoothed
with the delicately spiced cream sauce. The
meat, which looks and tates a bit like chic
ken. fell right off the bone.
Unfortunately, the rainbow trout was
scantily stuffed and did not taste that fresh.
This is why asking for suggestions regarding
freshness is emphasized.
Chopped, Iresh broccoli and a mixture of
wild rice accented the main plate. Alex's en
trees. which include garniture, bread loaf,
and salad, cost approximately $6.50 to
Si 1.50. A wine list is available. Wine, ap
petizers and desserts are a la carte.
Anticipating dessert? It is all homemade.
Mom would appreciate Alex's brandied
apple pie. It is chunky and topped with real
whipped cream. A layer cheesecake with a
light heart tantalizes the light-hearted.
Choose also from chocolate mousse.
Owner Alex Reid dates his building in a
glen to the speak-easv days of the twenties.
The Mountain House has occupied it for the
past six years. The bar serves a regular local
clientele, but the dining room attracts fre
quenters from San Francisco and the Bay
area. No reservations are taken: yet even on
a foggy, foggy night, the Mountain House
was pleasingly full.

lains the evening specials, ask about the
freshness of that dish that especially appeals
to you. This is a key to your delight in dinner.
A loaf of crusty, browned bread, freshly
baked and still warm, accompanies a large
garden salad. Diners toss and help them
selves to the tresh ureens and to the jar ot

homemade dressing.
1 praise Alex's evening specials. The ap
petizer of marinated crab proved tender and
flavorful. No salty taste or stringy meat here.
Also, the rabbit baked in cream sauce and
topped with real bacon pieces won points. A
stock base used before the rabbit is smoothed
with the delicately spiced cream sauce. The
meat, which looks and tates a bit like chic
ken. fell right off the bone.
Unfortunately, the rainbow trout was
scantily stuffed and did not taste that fresh.
This is why asking for suggestions regarding
freshness is emphasized.
Chopped, Iresh broccoli and a mixture of
wild rice accented the main plate. Alex's en
trees. which include garniture, bread loaf,
and salad, cost approximately $6.50 to
Si 1.50. A wine list is available. Wine, ap
petizers and desserts are a la carte.
Anticipating dessert? It is all homemade.
Mom would appreciate Alex's brandied
apple pie. It is chunky and topped with real
whipped cream. A layer cheesecake with a
light heart tantalizes the light-hearted.
Choose also from chocolate mousse.
Owner Alex Reid dates his building in a
glen to the speak-easv days of the twenties.
The Mountain House has occupied it for the
past six years. The bar serves a regular local
clientele, but the dining room attracts fre
quenters from San Francisco and the Bay
area. No reservations are taken: yet even on
a foggy, foggy night, the Mountain House
was pleasingly full.
