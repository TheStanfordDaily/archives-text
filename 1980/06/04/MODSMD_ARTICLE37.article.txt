Does the name sound famil
iar? No, it isn't a French version
of Ken's House of Pancakes. It
doesn't even serve breakfast, let
alone omelettes! Maybe L'Om

Camino in South Palo Alto,
L'Omelette is a country-style
French restaurant and Bistro
that was opened in 1932. It has
undergone numerous changes in
management, but has remained a
favorite among Stanford stu
dents and alumni.
Currently, L'Omelette is
owned by Louis Borel and
Lorenzo Armanno. who re
stored the traditional setting of
classicandprovincial French din
ing in a country-inn atmosphere.
Hurricane lamps and French
floral place-settings complement
the dimly lit wooden dining
room.
Additional momentos dating
back to 1 932 decorate the entry,

Bowl game is on proud display.
Borel and Armanno combine
tradition and legend, still affec
tionately calling their restaurant
"L'Ommies," with classy yet not
stuffy French cuisine and service.
L'Omelette's bill of fare is
traditionally French, from ap
petizers to desserts. One can
choose from esc argot to crevettes
to whet the appetite. We chose to
be tres francais and tried the Pate
Maison, a house specialty. This
proved to be a good choice — the
pate, embedded in lettuce, was
tasty but not too spicy or fatty.

The list of entrees included 112 resh
seafood, beef, veal, and poultry.
Each selection came complete
with the soup du jour and a din
ner salad. The soup was served
first: a delightfully subtle yet
tasty vegetable soup.
The salads, in comparison,
were quite tangy and a bit over
powering. Leafy green lettuce
was lightly sprinkled with egg
yolk and spices, and then
smothered with a mustard and
horseradish house dressing.
After the pleasantly bland pate
and vegetable soup, the dressing
was good, but too strong.
The main dishes were well
presented, each complete with
garden fresh vegetables and
either potatoes or rice. We de
cided to trv a seafood dish,
Saumon Supreme de Grille (gril
led salmon), and a meat dish.
Cote de Veuu (veal with fresh
mushroom sauce). The salmon
was fresh and flaky, served with a
light and creamy hollandaise
sauce, but was a bit too grilled.
The Cote ue Venn was a better
selection, covered with fresh
mushroom sauce and cooked
until it was tender and moist.
To complement our meal, we
had chosen a French Riesling
wine, somewhat drier than a
California Riesling. I.'Omelet
te's extensive wine list, complete
with maps of the wines' origins,
was fascinating to look at, even
for a non-drinker. They offer an
amazing selection of domestic
and imported wines.
To finish oft our meal, we tried
two "special" desserts. Although
we could have chosen from
chocolate mousse, parfaits. sun
daes or camambert cheese, the
"Raspberry Melba" and "Pro
fiteroles" sounded especially

tempting. The Raspberry Melba
was a nice, light touch to a tilling
meal.
As we finished our desserts
and sipped our cappuccino and
coffee kioki. Monsieur Borel sat
down and revealed to us the his
tory of L'Omelette and his
career. We were most intrigued
by his ability to run and cook for
his patrons, and entertain them.
The overall service at
L'Omelette was good. Our wai
ter was enthusiastic and energe
tic, as well as informative. Ser
vice was prompt, even on a Fri
day evening, and our meals ar
rived warm and tastefully pre
sented. Prices were high, with
the entrees ranging from $8.50
to $16. but that. too. is in typical
French tradition!!

we could have chosen from
chocolate mousse, parfaits. sun

tempting. The Raspberry Melba
was a nice, light touch to a tilling
meal.

The overall service at
L'Omelette was good. Our wai

Does the name sound famil
iar? No, it isn't a French version
of Ken's House of Pancakes. It
doesn't even serve breakfast, let
alone omelettes! Maybe L'Om
mies rings a bell? Located on El
Camino in South Palo Alto,
L'Omelette is a country-style
French restaurant and Bistro
that was opened in 1932. It has
undergone numerous changes in
management, but has remained a
favorite among Stanford stu
dents and alumni.
Currently, L'Omelette is
owned by Louis Borel and
Lorenzo Armanno. who re
stored the traditional setting of
classicandprovincial French din
ing in a country-inn atmosphere.
Hurricane lamps and French
floral place-settings complement
the dimly lit wooden dining
room.
Additional momentos dating
back to 1 932 decorate the entry,
bar and dining room walls. A pic
ture of Stanford's first Rose
Bowl game is on proud display.
Borel and Armanno combine
tradition and legend, still affec
tionately calling their restaurant
"L'Ommies," with classy yet not
stuffy French cuisine and service.
L'Omelette's bill of fare is
traditionally French, from ap
petizers to desserts. One can
choose from esc argot to crevettes
to whet the appetite. We chose to
be tres francais and tried the Pate
Maison, a house specialty. This
proved to be a good choice — the
pate, embedded in lettuce, was
tasty but not too spicy or fatty.

The list of entrees included 112 resh
seafood, beef, veal, and poultry.
Each selection came complete
with the soup du jour and a din
ner salad. The soup was served
first: a delightfully subtle yet
tasty vegetable soup.
The salads, in comparison,
were quite tangy and a bit over
powering. Leafy green lettuce
was lightly sprinkled with egg
yolk and spices, and then
smothered with a mustard and
horseradish house dressing.
After the pleasantly bland pate
and vegetable soup, the dressing
was good, but too strong.
The main dishes were well
presented, each complete with
garden fresh vegetables and
either potatoes or rice. We de
cided to trv a seafood dish,
Saumon Supreme de Grille (gril
led salmon), and a meat dish.
Cote de Veuu (veal with fresh
mushroom sauce). The salmon
was fresh and flaky, served with a
light and creamy hollandaise
sauce, but was a bit too grilled.
The Cote ue Venn was a better
selection, covered with fresh
mushroom sauce and cooked
until it was tender and moist.
To complement our meal, we
had chosen a French Riesling
wine, somewhat drier than a
California Riesling. I.'Omelet
te's extensive wine list, complete
with maps of the wines' origins,
was fascinating to look at, even
for a non-drinker. They offer an
amazing selection of domestic
and imported wines.
To finish oft our meal, we tried
two "special" desserts. Although
we could have chosen from
chocolate mousse, parfaits. sun
daes or camambert cheese, the
"Raspberry Melba" and "Pro
fiteroles" sounded especially

tempting. The Raspberry Melba
was a nice, light touch to a tilling
