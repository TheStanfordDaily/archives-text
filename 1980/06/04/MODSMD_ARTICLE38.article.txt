From the outside. Monti's
Seafood Restaurant in Menlo
Park looks small and intimate.
The intimate part is right, but it is
by no means small. The building
itself contains three elegantly
furnished dining rooms and a
cocktail lounge. Off to the side of
the main building is a fresh-fish
market, which is open six days a
week.
The interior is quite cozy. The
floors are carpeted, and most of
the dining tables are set oft in
booths by wood partitions.
There are hanging plants and
paintings adorning the walls, as
well as some beautiful stained
glass panels mounted on the
walls.
The atmosphere is generally

very sedate, being that the re
staurant caters to an older, more
affluent croud. The lighting is
dimmed to create a more distin
guished and intimate surround
ing.
Monti's specializes in Eastern
seatoods, which are imported to
ensure freshness. These include
Maine lobster, cherry stone
clams, and blue point oysters.
Everything on the menu is avail
able in their fish market. The
menu is not limited to Eastern
seafood, however. It is in fact
quite extensive, offering Conti
nental dinners in addition to
their wide variety of seafood.
Most of the fish offered on the
menu is breaded, sauteed or
poached, and served in rich
sauces (which hide not only the
true flavor of the fish, but the
bones as well). The average din
ner plate ranges from $7.95 to
$N. 95. but you can pay as little as
$6.95 or as much as $13.95 per
person. The portions are pretty
good sized and are served with
salad or vegetables, and
potatoes.
Monti's is open seven days a
week. Monday through Friday
they are open for lunch and din
ner; Saturday and Sunday they
serve only dinner. For those in
terested m entertainment. Fri
day and Saturday they have what
Monti calls their "sing-along" in
the cocktail lounge.
If you are imprssed by expen
sive looking surroundings, rich
sauces and a distinguished at
mosphere. Monti's Seafood Re
staurant is something to look
into.
