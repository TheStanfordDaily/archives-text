# Job prospects look improved for liberal arts seniors, law and med students
## 
### 
Graduation can he a traumatic
experience, particularly for
those departing without im
mediate plans for enrollment at a
graduate school. Stepping out of
the ivory tower environment of
college into the bustling and
competitive job market can be
intimidating, even for know
ledgeable and worldly Stanford
students.
But in the last 10 years, aided
by the extensive services of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), students here
have entered the employment
ranks directly out of school in
increasingly larger numbers.
In 1980, that trend appears
certain to continue: a record 50
percent of the bachelor's degree
recipients have decided to forego
immediate entry into graduate
school, and that figure includes
60 percent of the women stu
dents. up from 40 percent just
two years ago.
Ralph Keller, director of the
CPPC, told the Daily this week
that the center expects to place at
least K7 percent of its registrants,
a percentage that would match
its 1979 success rate. Keller

based his prediction on the lack
of harried concern among job
seekers:
"If they're worried, they come
in to see us at the last minute.
The absence of that is a good
sign."
(Because the CPPC conducts
its annual job information survey
in the summer, it will not have
until then an accurate reading of
the students' success.)
Opportunities for liberal arts
majors have improved signific
antly this year, Keller said. "For
the first time, some big organiza
tions are showing an interest in
our liberal arts graduates, and I
think that trend will continue."
According to Keller, large
banks, accounting firms and cor
porations such as Mobil Oil have
begun to seek out non-science
undergraduate degree recipients
for entry-level management pos
itions.
Keller cites two reasons for the
change:
One, the average starting sal
ary for an MBA has risen as
tronomically in the last several
years, to approximately
$28,000. A liberal arts bachelor,

on the other hand, usually com
mands an entry salary of no more
than $12,000. Many firms, Kel
ler said, have responded to this
trend by resorting to the "two
for-one system," hiring two stu
dents with a bachelor's degree
instead of one MBA.
Two, liberal arts majors in re
cent years have done more to
prepare themselves for the job
market. "We encourage them to
take more courses like
economics, statistics, math and
accounting," Keller said.
Ironically, this increase in the
popularity of math and engineer
ing courses comes at a time when
engineering students face a level
ling of their prospects for
employment. Although the re
cession has not yet descended on
Silicon Valley, home of many
former Stanford engineers,
"some automative firms have
had to cut back," Keller said.
As a result, he continued, "we
don't expect it to look as good for
mechanical engineering" in
1 9NO as it did in 1979. Even so, a
drop-off from last year — when
placement among graduates in
the fields for engineering and
sciences improved 19.7 percent
— should not pose too great a
problem for engineering stu
dents: Keller expects the de
mand for engineers to exceed the
supply once again.
Summarizing the outlook for
graduating seniors, Keller said.
"Based on past experience, the
situation certainly looks good.
There are not many signs of the
recession affecting our students
yet, and we hope that that will
continue."
Graduates of most of Stan
ford's professional schools also
have a promising road ahead. At
the Business School, said
Marianne Weingartner of the
Business School Placement Of
fice, graduates have had "a gen
erally strong year," despite the
recession.
Indeed, she continued, "We
sense that the job market is very
similar to last year's," when most
of the graduates landed jobs pay
ing in the neighborhood of
$27,500. This year, she con
tinued, the novice MBA proba
blv will command a salary of
about $30,000.
Jobs in marketing remain on a
rising curve for Stanford MBAs,
Weingartner said, and interest in
consulting also continues to be
high. As a new trend, some busi
ness school students have de
cided to try positions in the
communications industry.

At the law school, Gloria
Py/ka, director of law school
placement, said that at least 90
percent of this year's 174
graduates have made solid work
plans. In that respect, she said,
this year "basically parallels the
last two years."
Salaries for fledgling attorneys
probably will increase margi
nally over last year's. Lawyers
starting out in metropolitan
areas such as Los Angeles or
New York may expect to receive
more than $30,000 a year.
Weingartner said.
Graduates of the medical
school have compiled an essen
tially perfect placement record.
According to Dr. Elizabeth
Short of the Medical Center Stu
dent Affairs Office, 74 of the 78
MDs graduating this year will
join intern programs in clinical
training at hospitals around the
country. The remaining four will
continue into post-doctoral re
search.
Internships are determined by
a computerized matching pro
cess in which the students and
hospitals select their top choices.
This year, 100 percent of the
Stanford medical students apply
ing to intern programs received
matches. Of those, 76 percent
"matched" with one of their top
three choices.
Those figures closely follow
those set in previous years. Short
said. "Our students should be
proud."
