# Job prospects look improved for liberal arts seniors, law and med students
##

Graduation can he a traumatic
experience, particularly for
those departing without im
mediate plans for enrollment at a
graduate school. Stepping out of
the ivory tower environment of
college into the bustling and
competitive job market can be
intimidating, even for know
ledgeable and worldly Stanford
students.
But in the last 10 years, aided
by the extensive services of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC), students here
have entered the employment
ranks directly out of school in
increasingly larger numbers.
In 1980, that trend appears
certain to continue: a record 50
percent of the bachelor's degree
recipients have decided to forego
immediate entry into graduate
school, and that figure includes
60 percent of the women stu
dents. up from 40 percent just
two years ago.
Ralph Keller, director of the
CPPC, told the Daily this week
that the center expects to place at
least K7 percent of its registrants,
a percentage that would match
its 1979 success rate. Keller

based his prediction on the lack
of harried concern among job
seekers:
"If they're worried, they come
in to see us at the last minute.
The absence of that is a good
sign."
(Because the CPPC conducts
its annual job information survey
in the summer, it will not have
until then an accurate reading of
the students' success.)
Opportunities for liberal arts
majors have improved signific
antly this year, Keller said. "For
the first time, some big organiza
tions are showing an interest in
our liberal arts graduates, and I
think that trend will continue."
According to Keller, large
banks, accounting firms and cor
porations such as Mobil Oil have
begun to seek out non-science
undergraduate degree recipients
for entry-level management pos
itions.
Keller cites two reasons for the
change:
One, the average starting sal
ary for an MBA has risen as
tronomically in the last several
years, to approximately
$28,000. A liberal arts bachelor,

on the other hand, usually com
mands an entry salary of no more
than $12,000. Many firms, Kel
ler said, have responded to this
trend by resorting to the "two
for-one system," hiring two stu
dents with a bachelor's degree
instead of one MBA.
Two, liberal arts majors in re
cent years have done more to
prepare themselves for the job
market. "We encourage them to
take more courses like
economics, statistics, math and
accounting," Keller said.
Ironically, this increase in the
popularity of math and engineer
ing courses comes at a time when
engineering students face a level
ling of their prospects for
employment. Although the re
cession has not yet descended on
Silicon Valley, home of many
former Stanford engineers,
"some automative firms have
had to cut back," Keller said.
As a result, he continued, "we
don't expect it to look as good for
mechanical engineering" in
1 9NO as it did in 1979. Even so, a
drop-off from last year â€” when
