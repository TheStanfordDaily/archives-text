THE GOOD EARTH
185 University Ave.
Palo Alto

Daily 7:30 AM-10:30 PM
For those whose taste buds
crave something other than
dorm food. The Good Earth re
staurant on University Avenue
provides a pleasant switch, with
its unique variety of natural food
dishes served in a comfortable
dining atmosphere. Setting The
Good Earth apart from its area
competitors is its refusal to serve
many overprocessed and chemi
cally composed foods, replacing
them with a diversity of vegeta
bles, fruits, herbs and other
natural ingredients.
The restaurant's use of only
choice ingredients has not li
mited its selection of meals, but
on the contrary has opened up a
creative array of dishes â€” every
thing from omelettes to tostadas;
and from salads to shakes.
Hot and cold sandwiches,
soups, salads, and meat, vegeta
ble. shrimp and chicken entrees,
are among the menu selections

tor lunch and dinner. In addition,
six types of fruit and yogurt
shakes, daily baked pastries, and
assorted desserts are available
for those with a sweet tooth. Var
ious teas, juices, wines and beer
accompany Good Earth dishes.
Cireen ferns hang lazily over
the tables against a background
of wood paneled walls. This
creates a relaxed and easy-going
atmosphere for those who enjoy
eating and talking in an unrushed
manner. One of the most surpris
ing characteristics of the Good
Earth is the diversified crowd
that regularly attends the re
staurant.
"We don't generally draw one
type of person." explained man
ager Mary Wolleson. "but any
one who is concerned about what
food goes in their stomach."
As far as prices are concerned,
a McDonald's it is not. Yet in
view of the type of food served
and the relatively large portions
given, the prices appear to be
somewhat reasonable with pos
sible exceptions in the entree
section. Prices run about $3 to $4
for sandwiches, $3 to $5 for
salads, and to S7 for entrees.

I would not recommend The
Good Earth to stubborn steak
and lobster lovers, picky pizza
pushers, fast food freaks, or
those who go into prolonged
periods of depression when their
parents make them eat vegeta
bles. This restaurant will appeal
only to those who enjoy the
wholesome, natural and fresh
taste of those foods which come
from the good earth.
