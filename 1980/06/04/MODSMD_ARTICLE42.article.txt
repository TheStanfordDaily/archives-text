"Peking and Szuechwan Cuisine" read the
menu cover at O'Mei Restaurant. Peking and
Szuechwan? What ever happened tit simple
"Flow about some Chinese food tonight?"
A more than helpful O'Mei waitress
answered some of the questions. She explained
that Mandarin cuisine represented much of the
cooking tound in central and northern China,
while Cantonese reflected the sweeter foods
traditionally prepared in the southern sections.
Among the Mandarin foods are found the Pek
ing and Szuechwan preparations, both of which
O'Mei Restaurant (10 minutes north on El
Camino) ser\es Tuesday through Sunday for
lunch and dinner.
Now comtortable with the menu cover, we
decided to explore the course listings. In addi
tion to the combination dinner choices, we
found a huge a la carte listing. Included here
were upwards of 15 to 25 choices under each of
several categories, such as chicken and duck,
beef. pork, soups, vegetables, rice and noodles,
and seafood. Alongside many of the listings we
found a Chinese notation which our waitress
told us signified a spicier Szuechwan prepara
tion.
Our Peking dish, the cashew chicken which
we recognized from other Chinese restaurant
menus, was excellent — well-balanced between

chicken and cashews, and garnished with water
chestnuts.
But the S/uechwan preparation — twice
cooked pork, made the meal deliciously unique.
The sharp spice of the dish complemented the
taste of the pork strips and green pepper with
out being o\ crbearing. yet it left no doubt as to
the distinctly different tastes of China's
Szuechwan peoples.
We also sampled soups and \ egetables, which
were both of more traditional American-
Chinese style, and found them quite good. We
especially enjoyed the sizzling rice soup, which
afforded us the added pleasure ot watching the
just-fried rice heat the chicken-and-shrimp
broth with a sizzle, as our waiter placed it is the
soup at tableside.
The dining environment at O'Mei Restaur
ant included a simple combination of traditional
Chinese decor with the more American decor of
folded red table-napkins set on white table
cloths. The light amply filled the room, which
had several round tables in its center and which
was rimmed with booths.
The a la carte selections ranged in price from
$2.50 to $3.00 for rice and noodle dishes. $3.50
to $4.50 for beef, chicken, pork, and vegetable
dishes, and $6.50 to $9.00 for fish and shellfish
dishes. We found that one a la carte serving, an
order of rice, and soup would satisfy most.
Peking or Szuechwan, O'Mei's offers good
Chinese food reasonably priced and close to the
Farm.
