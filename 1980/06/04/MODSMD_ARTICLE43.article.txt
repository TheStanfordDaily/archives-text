With all the talk regarding
the "wasting" of the Jack-in
the-Box clown, many of you
may be worried that another
time-honored Stanford tradi
tion — the midnight Jack's
run —just won't be the same.
Well, don't despair. The
place hasn't been overrun yet
by little old ladies, and the
atmosphere is still fast and
plastic, despite a few changes
in the menu.
We were told Jack was
blown up to make way for a
few changes: new products,
classier facilities in some
franchises, at any rate, a
slightly different image. Yes.
friends. Jack is gone, but his
leaving has not made too
many changes in the nearby
Jacks at 2250 HI Camino in
Palo Alto.
Now, instead of the cheery
little clown who said, "Your
order, please." one simply
speaks into a metal box with a
grate over it.
The newest addition is the
"Chicken Supreme"
sandwich. A combination of a
chicken patty, lettuce, to
mate. and Swiss cheese on a
cracked wheat bun. For
$1.59. it's one of the more
expensive items on the menu
(which tells you a lot about

the place), but it's really
pretty good.
I he "Jumbo Jack" burger
is still around and is still a de
pendable and hefty meal.
Long a favorite ol late-night
munehers. the $1.25 burger
— $1.45 with cheese — is
juicy and flavorful.
But lurking near the bot
tom of the wall menu is a little
item which may soon become
known as "Jack's revenge":
the taco. There are a number
of observations to be made
about Jack's tacos, the most
complimentary of which is
that $.60 is much too much to
pay for them.
Soft drinks run in the $.40
to $.60 range, and are served
in fairly generous amounts.
Shakes aren't bad by fast
food standards, either, al
though they have a definite
ice milk taste.
Lastly, a word on another
Jack's gimmick, (rings. These
$.45 combinations of onion
rings are just about the worst
that can be found on the Mid
peninsula. Don't say you we
ren't warned.
Although the less-than
helpful manager said the
busiest time in the store's "6
a.m. to 1 or 2 a.m." day is
lunchtime. a good portion ol
the place's business continues
to come from the Stanford
late-night runs, especially on
the weekends when it stays
open until "about 3 a.m.."
Needless to say, you might
want to call ahead.


This little fellow is shown enjoying his shake, but beneath
that exterior is sadness. "I miss the clown, he admitted.
