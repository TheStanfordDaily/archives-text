Herbert Hoover. 31st President of the
United States, was a rare exception to
regularalumni whodonate money to their
alma mater.
Not only did Hoover volunteer the
funds which established the Hoover In
stitution on War. Revolution, and Peace,
in 1919. his input lead to the development
ol such programs as the Food Research
Institute and the business school.
Although the tower which bears his
name is affectionately referred to as
Hoover's last erection by the student
body, probably the 1N95 alumnus'
greatest contribution to the University
was the creation of one of the world's
most complete collections ol information
on 20th-century wars and revolution.
The Hoover institution, which marked
its 60th anniversary last year, is a major
center for advanced scholarship in politi
cal science, history, economics and inter
national law.
As student guides in the Tower point
out to \ isitors. the institution has the third
largest archives in the nation and the
largest private archives. It actually is con

tained within three buildings: the Tower,
the Lou Henry Hoover Building and the
Hoover Federal Memorial.
The institution contains over 1.250.000
volumes, including government docu
ments. as well as 3000 archive units,
which are pri\ ate collections of paper, let
ters. memos, pamphlets, diaries and other

know that they are moving in the right direction/

documents. Subscriptions to newspapers
and periodicals have resulted in more
than 30.000 titles being on tile.
What all these numbers signify to a
scholar is the possibility of thoroughly in
vestigating a subject — whether it be an
intensive study ol a particular country,
war or revolution, or a broad, compara
tive look at a political or historical
phenomenon.
History
As American Relief Administration

Director in Europe during World War I.
Hoover begun his collection with the help
ol Stanford professors Hphraim Adams
and Ralph Lut/. He hoped that the mate
rials they gathered would prov ide the data
with which future historians would work.
I.lit/ became the institution's first director
m 1925.

Until 1939. the collected materials
were stored in various places on campus
- many in the main library. The library
was not really prepared to store the mas
ses ot documents the collecting team sent
back at the end of the war.
Recognizing the need for a separate
building, the founders set about raising
money. By 1939. they were ready to start
the tower, which was dedicated in 1 94 1.
The tower
The 285-foot tower holds the library

and main archives — there are 17 levels of
stacks, as well as administrative and re
search offices, two reading rooms, two
display rooms of Hoover memorabilia
and a 35-bell carillon.
The bells were cast in Belgium for the
1939-40 World's Fair and were later do
nated to Hoover by the Belgian American
Education Foundation. Hoover gave
them to the institution, which placed them
on top of the tower.
They are still played occasionally dur
ing the summer.
Although the institution began as a veh
icle to study World War I. Hoover's
statement ol purpose that it should "pro
mote peace" throughout the world led to
its expansions and constant acquisitions.
The So\ iet and Chinese collections are
especially large. Hoover particularly en
couraged three areas ot interest which are
still pursued today: domestic problems,
international studies and scholarship fel
lowships.
As well as employing a staff of perma
nent researchers and archivists, the in-
