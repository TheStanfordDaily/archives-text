# ODDS 'n' ENDS
## Joggers should be mindful of land rules 
### Scott Waxman 
If jogging is your thing, you
can certainly find ways to satisfy
your athletic urges here at Stan
ford. But if you came to the Uni
versity with vision of exploring
most or all of the frequently pub
licized "800 wooded acres," take
heed:
Although many areas on the
west side of campus, commonly
known as the "foothills," are
beautiful and popular running
territory, fleet-footed visitors
should be aware that many of
those areas are also private
property, where trespassing is
prohibited.
Runners who demand a
cross-country trek and who want
to avoid a citation should re
member to pick up a hiking per
mit, according to the Universi
ty's real estate office.
The permits are free and allow
for traversing of the Stanford
Community Trail, a three-mile
loop through the foothills just
north of Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
Permits can be picked up in
Room 105 in Encina Hall, the
University's real estate office.
Zera Coleman, administrative
assistant in that office, said the

purpose of issuing permits is to
educate the University commun
ity about the rules laid down by
landowner Manuel Piers, who
uses the foothill area to graze his
dairy cattle.
Major rules prohibit dogs and
forbid running at night and
traveling off the trail.
According to Director of
Police Services Marvin Her
rington, during the recent
drought no cattle were on the
property, and the land was used
as a park and picnicing area by
students and residents.
The need to check permits
arose in spring 1977, when Piers
again began grazing cattle there.
"There were many incidents
of people or dogs scaring or chas
ing the cattle," Herrington said.
In addition, joggers are urged
to stay on the paths and not to
run alone for their own safety.
Newcomers to the campus
might best be steered away from
the foothills, and instead explore
the approximately two-mile path
that goes around Lake Lagunita.
Although in some spots the ter
rain gets a little rough, it's a
scenic route and a good run, ac
cording to local running en
thusiasts.
