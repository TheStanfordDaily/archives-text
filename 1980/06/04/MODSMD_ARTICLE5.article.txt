# Sentiment over economics
## Commencement remains in Frost 
### 
Placing sentiment ahead of
economics, the Universit\ will
hold commencement exercises
Sunday in Frost Amphitheater
and not in Stanford Stadium, as
the University once had consi
dered.
Frost's relatively small
capacity and the cost of chair re
ntal for a Frost ceremony caused
the University last fall to con
sider breaking the 42-year tradi
tion of holding the exercises in
the amphitheater.
But in a decision reached last
January. President Richard
Lyman said, "If there is an area
where a certain amount of sen
timent is wholly appropriate to
the decision-making process, it
may well be commencement."
The University expects the
continuation of the ceremony in
Frost to cost $33,000, compared
to $ 18,000 for a ceremony in the
stadium.
Purchase of the 18.000 chairs
necessary for the Frost ceremony
and other commencement
events will cost the University
$ 13 1,400. which it will amortize
over the 10-year life expectancy
of the chairs.
Abbey Rentals, which previ
ously rented the chairs to the
University before closing its
northern California branch, of
fered to sell its used chairs to the
University, but officials here de
cided to buy new ones instead.
In making his decision. Lyman
recognized that a continuation of
the Frost ceremonies would pose
"significant problems" apart
from the cost of buying chairs.
Because Frost holds only 9500
people, the University must limit
severely the number of free tic
kets it distributes to graduating
students. Although the Univer
sity in recent years has crammed
12,000 chairs into the am
phitheater, the increasing de
mand for tickets this year forced
the University to reduce from
four to three its allocation of tic
kets to graduates.
In such circumstances, Lyman
said, "frustration and exaspera
tion on the part of both

graduates and their families and
friends is great. And there are
unpleasant side effects such as
the scalping of tickets, which
hardly seems a desirable adjunct
to a supposedly dignified and
happy ceremony."
Lyman said that opinions he
received from students on the lo
cation of the ceremony "came
down substantially in favor of
Frost." One letter he received
from 16 graduating seniors that
impressed him in particular said
that when the ceremony "be
comes vast, ever more imper
sonal. and loses its beauty, we
wonder at the point of it all.
"A special feeling is part of the
weekend, and the amphitheater
is a beautiful ingredient."
In addition to this letter.

Frost Amphitheater will once again be the site tor the commencement exercises. Earlier this year.
I resident Richard Lyman chose the serene Frost setting over that tit the more spacious stadium.
Lyman received from the senior
class presidents a compilation of
views of more than 100 seniors.
Senior class co-president Alan
Alport said that some students
said they would not participate in
the ceremony it it were held in
the stadium.
In considering the various ar
guments for a move into the
stadium. Lyman said, "There is
some loss as well as gain in hav
ing a virtually free and open
ceremony when, as not in
frequently happens, the com

mencement speaker is a celeb
rated figure, likely to draw a
sizeable audience of curiosity
seekers, in addition to those who
have a connection of family or
friendship with the graduates;
the nature of the ceremony is
likely to change in subtle ways."
In the last 10 years, the total
number of degrees granted has
increased from 3692 in 1970 to
4023 in 1979. The percentage of
degree recipients attending the
ceremony has risen during the
same period from 35 to 62 per
cent.
