## 
### 
The Class of 'SO will soon
leave, but they'll he leaving be
hind a little ot themselves and a
lew of their memories in a small
box buried in the Quad.
The graduating class will dedi
cate its time capsule Saturday at
10:45 a.m. in the Inner Quad
rangle. next to class plates dating
back to 1 MM 1.
This year's addition to the
tradition will hold dozens ol
small remembrances ot four
years ot life on the F arm.
The capsule will include a
1980 Quad, a senior class
T-shirt, a copy of the 1976 edi
tion d 1 Approaching Stanford,
and its companion DRA T (Dis
tribution Requirements and

I rungs).
A complete volume of The
Senior Times and several issues
of The Stanford Daily — includ
ing those published after the an
nouncement of President
Richard Lyman's resignation
and the Storey House fire — also

'80's eating habits.
Programs from some of this
year's major campus theatrical
productions, a ticket to Senior
Casino Night, a leaf from the
Tree, a Band album, an unpaid
parking ticket, cocktail napkins
from Sundance Mine Company
and a swizzle stick from 42nd
Street may tell something of the
extracurricular activities of this
year's graduates.
And finally, several time
schedules, overseas applications,
lecture notes, a blue book, an
add/drop card and an academic
probation notification letter will
show that the students actually
went to school here, when they
found the time.
Each class decides when its
time capsule may be opened.
To date, none of the old cap
sules has been unearthed.

It you're interested, a Daily
columnist figured this year that
we needn't worry for quite some
time about running out of space
in the Quad for the class plates
that cover the time capsules. Ac
cording to his calculations, the
graduating class's time capsule in
the year 2000 will he located in
front of the Human Biology
Dept. The seniors in 2023 will
have to split their capsule in half,
as their diamond is bisected hy
the archway on the west side of
the Quad. Not until 21 50 will the
brass markers reach around to
the arches across from Memorial
Church.
Ihe class of 2225, he found,
will bury their mementos in front
ot the President's office. And not
until 2390, five centuries after
the founding of the University,
will the plaques wind their way to
their point of origin in front of
the church
