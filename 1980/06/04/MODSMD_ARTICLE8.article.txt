# Seniors invest in the future with pledge to the University
## 
### 
More than 1500 seniors Nvill
mark their departure from Stan
lord Sunday, but 450 of them
will not leave empty-handed, ..
They'll leave the University
with a stake in its future, having
pledged an average of $60 to the
Senior Pledge Program. They
have obtained, as the slogan ol
this year's program says,"a piece
of the Farm."
Since a core committee of 13
seniors launched this year's
pledge program in November,
more than 100 volunteer student
fund-raisers have brought in
$27,000 in senior pledges. Last
year, by comparison, about 200
donors pledged approximately
$6000.
Outstanding response
"The response this year has
been just outstanding," said Lisa
Sonne, director of student de
velopment programs for the An
nual Fund. "It's really encourag
ing to see the students recognize
the importance of philan
thropy," both to the University
and to society in general.
The program encourages
seniors to make a three-year
non-binding pledge that, as a
donation, is tax-deductible. The
seniors may designate where
they want the money applied,
such as to academic depart
ments. Overseas Studies or the
Glee Club. This year, the prog
ram fund-raisers suggested a
total pledge ol $60, which the
donors could pay in installments
ol $10, $2() and $30 during the
three-year period.
Donors also could make a
"Class of '80 Pledge" of $25,
$30, and $30, or an even larger
donation, if they so chose.
Volunteers and publicity
Lea Anne Schoen feld, chair of
this year's core committee, attri
buted the success of the 1 MHO
program to its large base of vol
unteer support and publicity in
the Daily and on KZSU.

In addition, she said the fact
that the volunteers contacted all
of the seniors personally "made
a huge, huge difference."
The fund-raisers concentrated
their efforts during Winter Quar
ter, when they sent the seniors
brochures and visited each per
sonally in campus residences.
The volunteers contacted off
campus seniors by phone.
To encourage the volunteers
in their efforts, the core commit
tee gave all of them T-shirts and
provided an "orientation prog
ram" prior to the winter quarter
drive.
As a result, Schoenfeld said,
the volunteers enjoyed the cam
paign "and didn't feel badly
when they didn't have success."
As their record indicates, most
of the volunteers did have suc
cess and eight even managed to
sign up every senior in their own
dorm.
University's need questioned
With tuition costs rising, how
ever, some seniors questioned
the University's need for addi
tional funds from those who have
just finished shelling out for tui
tion.
"After paying $9000 a year
lor four years," one senior said.
"I figure even $10 will do me a
lot more good than it will do
them."
But. because the University

depends heavily on private gilts
from alumni —as Sonne pointed
out, tuition, as some pointed out,
covers less than half of the costs
of education — the program
workers made a special effort to
explain the realities of the Uni
versity's finances.
"We wanted everyone to have
an opportunity to ask about the
University's budget," Sonne
said. "A donation here is an in
vestment; if a student has any
questions about how the Univer
sity spends money, we're here to
answer them."
The University believes that
seniors who contribute now are
more likely to contribute in the
future, Sonne continued. "Once
you're away from school, it's
easy to forget the University's
needs."
Moreover, she added, strong
participation by recent graduates
encourages corporations and
foundations to donate.
Regardless of what the Uni
versity earns from the program,
the student volunteers stand to
gain from their efforts.
"It's not the most enjoyable
thing to call up and ask people,
especially friends, and ask for
money," a volunteer said. "You
get the few clowns who tell you
you're full of shit, but the nice
people make it all worthwhile."

they want the money applied,
such as to academic depart
ments. Overseas Studies or the
Glee Club. This year, the prog
ram fund-raisers suggested a
total pledge ol $60, which the
donors could pay in installments
ol $10, $2() and $30 during the
three-year period.
Donors also could make a
"Class of '80 Pledge" of $25,
$30, and $30, or an even larger
donation, if they so chose.
Volunteers and publicity
Lea Anne Schoen feld, chair of
this year's core committee, attri
buted the success of the 1 MHO
program to its large base of vol
unteer support and publicity in
the Daily and on KZSU.

In addition, she said the fact
that the volunteers contacted all
of the seniors personally "made
a huge, huge difference."
The fund-raisers concentrated
their efforts during Winter Quar
ter, when they sent the seniors
brochures and visited each per
sonally in campus residences.
The volunteers contacted off
campus seniors by phone.
To encourage the volunteers
in their efforts, the core commit
tee gave all of them T-shirts and
provided an "orientation prog
ram" prior to the winter quarter
drive.
As a result, Schoenfeld said,
the volunteers enjoyed the cam
paign "and didn't feel badly
when they didn't have success."
As their record indicates, most
of the volunteers did have suc
cess and eight even managed to
sign up every senior in their own
dorm.
University's need questioned
With tuition costs rising, how
ever, some seniors questioned
the University's need for addi
tional funds from those who have
just finished shelling out for tui
tion.
"After paying $9000 a year
lor four years," one senior said.
"I figure even $10 will do me a
lot more good than it will do
them."
But. because the University

depends heavily on private gilts
from alumni —as Sonne pointed
out, tuition, as some pointed out,
covers less than half of the costs
of education — the program
workers made a special effort to
explain the realities of the Uni
versity's finances.
"We wanted everyone to have
an opportunity to ask about the
University's budget," Sonne
said. "A donation here is an in
vestment; if a student has any
questions about how the Univer
sity spends money, we're here to
answer them."
The University believes that
seniors who contribute now are
more likely to contribute in the
future, Sonne continued. "Once
you're away from school, it's
easy to forget the University's
needs."
Moreover, she added, strong
participation by recent graduates
encourages corporations and
foundations to donate.
Regardless of what the Uni
versity earns from the program,
the student volunteers stand to
gain from their efforts.
"It's not the most enjoyable
thing to call up and ask people,
especially friends, and ask for
money," a volunteer said. "You
get the few clowns who tell you
you're full of shit, but the nice
people make it all worthwhile."
More than 1500 seniors Nvill
mark their departure from Stan
lord Sunday, but 450 of them
will not leave empty-handed, ..
They'll leave the University
with a stake in its future, having
pledged an average of $60 to the
Senior Pledge Program. They
have obtained, as the slogan ol
this year's program says,"a piece
of the Farm."
Since a core committee of 13
seniors launched this year's
pledge program in November,
more than 100 volunteer student
fund-raisers have brought in
$27,000 in senior pledges. Last
year, by comparison, about 200
donors pledged approximately
$6000.
Outstanding response
"The response this year has
been just outstanding," said Lisa
Sonne, director of student de
velopment programs for the An
nual Fund. "It's really encourag
ing to see the students recognize
the importance of philan
thropy," both to the University
and to society in general.
The program encourages
seniors to make a three-year
non-binding pledge that, as a
donation, is tax-deductible. The
seniors may designate where
they want the money applied,
such as to academic depart
ments. Overseas Studies or the
Glee Club. This year, the prog
ram fund-raisers suggested a
total pledge ol $60, which the
donors could pay in installments
