## 
### Dan Fiduccia Staff Writer 
This year's Commencement
weekend was more exciting than
usual, as the Board of Trustees
announced on June 13 that Pro
vost Donald Kennedy will suc
ceed Richard Lyman as Univer
sity president on August 1.
Kennedy, a former chairman
of the Biology Department, first
came to Stanford since 1960. He
was named provost last year
alter he returned from
Washington. D.C., where he was
head of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
Kennedy's selection was
highly praised by many and
especially those who had partici
pated in the search process.
At a press conference last
Tuesday. Kennedy reiterated the
two proposals he made shortly

after his appointment was an
nounced.
"Growth is possible for the
humanities just as it was for the
sciences in the 's()s and '60s. I
think there has been a lot ol
progress in the humanities in the
last 10 years '' He pointed out
that the sciences did well at a
time "when there was a little
more money l>ing around from
the government."
Better advising
Commenting on under
graduate education. Kennedy
said "it is largely vigorous and
effective, but not everything is
done in ad\ ising and residential
education.'" He said he would
like to "instill the life of the mind
into the lives of students outside
of the formal curriculum."
Kennedy has not signalled any
departures from the policies of

President Lyman. "Everyone
says about government jobs, the
first 100 days are terribly criti
cal He noted since his presi
dency was beginning with a new
decade, there was pressure to la\
out his themes "in the lirst 100
minutes."
Kennedy will work on increas
ing funding for the humanities,
which he termed "very success
ful." •
"We'll find opportunities in
the humanities to attract new in
come. We don't need to cut from
the sciences."
Racial inequities
When questioned about racial
tensions on campus, Kennedy
asked: "Are minorities rep
resented in the upper levels ol
the administration? They're not.
and we'll have to work at doing


Donald and Jean Kennedy
better.
" As for the faculty, the numer
ical inadequacy of Chicanos is
the most critical problem." He
added he wanted to see better
representation of the Chicano
and black presence in the faculty.
Kennedy noted."We have not
achieved greater understanding
among the races, but it's a na
tional phenomenon, and it's the
same throughout other quality
institutions."
Kennedy commented on fed
eral involvement with the Uni
versity. saying " it's a two-way
street." He said federal prog
rams provide "very, very valu
able support." and he isn't dis
turbed by the degree of the Uni-
dependence on the fed
eral government.
Federal aid
Concerning the claim that
Stanford is being overregulated,
Kennedy said "some federal
regulations burden us more than
we would like to be. but some
regulations have stimulated us."
Kennedy referred to the con
tention that the University has
received money in return for
permitting federal intrusiveness.
terming the contention "the ar
gument of the Faustian bargain"
which he believ ed "doesn't stand
careful scrutiny."
"We didn't buy regulation just
because we took the king's shil
ling."
Kennedy said he wanted his
presidency to be measured "by

how attractive Stanford is to stu
dents. how peers of the faculty
regard them, and the health and
spirit of the institution."
No set date
When asked if he had consi
dered how long he wanted to be
president, Kennedy answered
that he hadn't reached any firm
conclusion, except "not to share
the conclusion if 1 have one.
"It's useful to have a review,
and it's appropriate to ask
people how it's going and en
courage them to answer with
candor. If you go on then, at least
you know how to."
On a lighter note, Kennedy
said it would give him "a great
deal of pleasure" if Stanford
went tii the Rose Bowl, but that
he would "worry if we went all
the time, but I would also worry
if we never went."
Laudatory remarks
Praise for Kennedy was forth
coming from all corners of the
multi-pronged search process,
which began in January when
Lyman announced his upcoming
resignation.
"The Board of Trustees
elected the person who clearly
enjoys the broadest, deepest,
highest regard for the presidency
in all quarters of the Stanford
community," said Religious
Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
who headed the faculty Presiden
tial Search Committee. "During
the search, the groundswell of
sincere support among the fa
culty for Don Kennedy was truly

remarkable. I believe we should
rejoice, all of us, that he is willing
to accept this responsibility."
Clebsch added that his com
mittee had gathered data on al
most 250 people, including very
intense evaluative information
on about 40. "A large number of
very fine, able persons" were re
ported to the board, and the best
was elected, he said.
Kennedy was the unanimous
first choice of the Associated
Students Presidential Search
Committee. Headed by former
Council of Presidents member
Laura Meade, the committee an
nounced that "We are enthusias
tic about Stanford's future under
Kennedy's leadership and vis
ion."
Robert Brown, chairman of
the Presidential Selection Com
mittee, said that "There were a
number of nominees possessed
of outstanding qualifications, but
the committee believes that
Kennedy is the best choice for
Stanford, not only because of his
long Stanford association and
comprehensive academic qual
ifications, but particularly be
cause of his infectious en
thusiasm for the University.

Donald and Jean Kennedy
better.
" As for the faculty, the numer
ical inadequacy of Chicanos is
the most critical problem." He
added he wanted to see better
representation of the Chicano
and black presence in the faculty.
Kennedy noted."We have not
achieved greater understanding
among the races, but it's a na
tional phenomenon, and it's the
same throughout other quality
institutions."
Kennedy commented on fed
eral involvement with the Uni
versity. saying " it's a two-way
street." He said federal prog
rams provide "very, very valu
able support." and he isn't dis
turbed by the degree of the Uni-
dependence on the fed
eral government.
Federal aid
Concerning the claim that
Stanford is being overregulated,
Kennedy said "some federal
regulations burden us more than
we would like to be. but some
regulations have stimulated us."
Kennedy referred to the con
tention that the University has
received money in return for
permitting federal intrusiveness.
terming the contention "the ar
gument of the Faustian bargain"
which he believ ed "doesn't stand
careful scrutiny."
"We didn't buy regulation just
because we took the king's shil
ling."
Kennedy said he wanted his
presidency to be measured "by

how attractive Stanford is to stu
dents. how peers of the faculty
regard them, and the health and
spirit of the institution."
No set date
When asked if he had consi
dered how long he wanted to be
president, Kennedy answered
that he hadn't reached any firm
conclusion, except "not to share
the conclusion if 1 have one.
"It's useful to have a review,
and it's appropriate to ask
people how it's going and en
courage them to answer with
candor. If you go on then, at least
you know how to."
On a lighter note, Kennedy
said it would give him "a great
deal of pleasure" if Stanford
went tii the Rose Bowl, but that
he would "worry if we went all
the time, but I would also worry
if we never went."
Laudatory remarks
Praise for Kennedy was forth
coming from all corners of the
multi-pronged search process,
which began in January when
Lyman announced his upcoming
resignation.
"The Board of Trustees
elected the person who clearly
enjoys the broadest, deepest,
highest regard for the presidency
in all quarters of the Stanford
community," said Religious
Studies Prof. William Clebsch,
who headed the faculty Presiden
tial Search Committee. "During
the search, the groundswell of
sincere support among the fa
culty for Don Kennedy was truly

remarkable. I believe we should
rejoice, all of us, that he is willing
to accept this responsibility."
Clebsch added that his com
mittee had gathered data on al
most 250 people, including very
intense evaluative information
on about 40. "A large number of
very fine, able persons" were re
ported to the board, and the best
was elected, he said.
Kennedy was the unanimous
first choice of the Associated
Students Presidential Search
Committee. Headed by former
Council of Presidents member
Laura Meade, the committee an
nounced that "We are enthusias
tic about Stanford's future under
Kennedy's leadership and vis
ion."
Robert Brown, chairman of
the Presidential Selection Com
mittee, said that "There were a
number of nominees possessed
of outstanding qualifications, but
the committee believes that
Kennedy is the best choice for
Stanford, not only because of his
long Stanford association and
comprehensive academic qual
ifications, but particularly be
cause of his infectious en
thusiasm for the University.
This year's Commencement
weekend was more exciting than
usual, as the Board of Trustees
announced on June 13 that Pro
vost Donald Kennedy will suc
ceed Richard Lyman as Univer
sity president on August 1.
Kennedy, a former chairman
of the Biology Department, first
came to Stanford since 1960. He
was named provost last year
alter he returned from
Washington. D.C., where he was
head of the Food and Drug Ad
ministration.
Kennedy's selection was
highly praised by many and
especially those who had partici
pated in the search process.
At a press conference last
Tuesday. Kennedy reiterated the
two proposals he made shortly

after his appointment was an
nounced.
"Growth is possible for the
humanities just as it was for the
sciences in the 's()s and '60s. I
think there has been a lot ol
progress in the humanities in the
last 10 years '' He pointed out
that the sciences did well at a
time "when there was a little
more money l>ing around from
the government."
Better advising
Commenting on under
graduate education. Kennedy
said "it is largely vigorous and
effective, but not everything is
done in ad\ ising and residential
education.'" He said he would
like to "instill the life of the mind
into the lives of students outside
of the formal curriculum."
Kennedy has not signalled any
departures from the policies of

President Lyman. "Everyone
says about government jobs, the
first 100 days are terribly criti

dency was beginning with a new
decade, there was pressure to la\
out his themes "in the lirst 100
minutes."
Kennedy will work on increas
ing funding for the humanities,
which he termed "very success
ful." •
"We'll find opportunities in
the humanities to attract new in
come. We don't need to cut from
the sciences."
Racial inequities
When questioned about racial
tensions on campus, Kennedy
asked: "Are minorities rep
resented in the upper levels ol
