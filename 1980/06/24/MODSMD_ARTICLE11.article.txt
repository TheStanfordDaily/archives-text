mittees lor their endeavors and
lor their ultimate determination.
Replacing I.yman. who has

leader and "one ot the most ar
ticulate spokesmen tor higher
education in this country." is no
simple task I'he job would be
more than sufficiently challeng
ing without the imposing

here over a 20-year span as both
an academic and an adminis
trator The widespread success
and popularity of the Human
Biology program, which he es
tablished. is but one indicator ot
his concern tor students.
Kennedy also won respect lor
his role heading the federal food
and Drug Administration. In the

vacillating winds ot Washington,
tic was able to retain his integrity
and devotion to scientific' prog
ress. Kennedy is familiar with a
government that involves itsell
ever more frequently with edu
cation.
As a scientist. Kennedy brings
a new outlook and pursuit to the
office ot the president. But an
analytic, quick-thinking mind,
tempered by his self-professed
interest in the humanities,
should serve Kennedy well as the
responsibilities ot the president
inevitably mount.
By already highlighting the
need for improvement in the
humanities, undergraduate edu
cation and affirmative action lor
I acuity and administrators. Ken
nedy has revealed a sensitivity
tor the many div erse elements on
campus. His progress in those
and other areas is anticipated.
The presidency ot the Univer
sity is no sinecure, and Ken
nedy's path will he undoubtedly
strewn with many confounding
hurdles. The Daily is confident
that Donald Kennedy can sur
mount those obstacles and forge
new paths of educational suc
cess.
Congratulations. President
