# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Viewpoint The 						summer Daily wants your ideas 
### 
Welcome to the summer Daily
. . . or. more accurately, the
summer Twice-Weekly. The title
Daily is a true misnomer because
this summer edition is not a daily
newspaper at all. In fact, it isn't
even an edition; rather, it is a
minute segment ot a volume ol
the regular academic-year Daily.
So, one could say that the is
sues published on Tuesdays and
Iridays (with the exception ol
the Fourth of July) from now
until August 15 serve only as the
connective tissue between one
••real" Daily and another.
Vet. for the sake of all our sen
sitive egos, let's pretend other
wise. As the University itself un
dergoes a transformation of sorts
over the summer, so too does the
Daily. And those changes do not
mean that the campus or the
Daily is no longer real — just
different.
This intermittant Daily is still a
student-run, independent or
ganization. catering to the Uni
versity community. But in the
slower-paced atmosphere af
forded by summer quarter, we

have mure time and opportunity
to analyze the responsibilities
inherent to our monopolistic
position.
Last quarter, the Daily staff
was harangued for "taking itself
too seriously." Although the jus
tification for that claim is moot. I
hope that no probable cause will
exist this summer to arouse simi
lar cries.
Nor will the Daily of the next
two months persist in calling it
self a professional organization.
Whereas we will certainly strive
to produce the best newspaper
possible in an effort to dessimi
nate the most information possi
ble, we must recognize our limi
tations as a student publication.
The Daily's duty is not solely to
its readers. Instead, it is equally,
perhaps primarily, to its staff,
whom it has promised to train in
the journalistic art.
Furthermore, I will flatly state
that the Daily will not be purely
objective this summer. Any
newspaper touting itself as such
is kidding itself and most likely
not fooling its public. Size and

employee constraints obviate the
sheer verbosity that total objec
tivity would entail. Selective
coverage, among numerous
other choices, is thereby necessi
tated — and those choices are by
definition subjective.
In our attempt, however, to
subdue personal bias in the Daily
this summer, you, the reader, can
aid us immeasurably. Simply put.
we need your feedback. Let us
know what you like about the
Daily and what you don't like.
Inform us of the news-gathering
chances we may be missing. Tell
us what you believe deserves
more coverage and what merits
less.
Only with the benefit of many
viewpoints and varied perspec
tives can we more closely ap
proach that elusive goal termed
objectivity. Moreover, perhaps
we can, in the process, infuse the
Daily and the campus with more
humility, a more sincere sense of
humor and a better appreciation
for our surroundings.
