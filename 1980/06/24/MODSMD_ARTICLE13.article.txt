## If input creative, then reject, else commit suicide

I may be a wandering, unde
cided humanities student, but I
am a lairly open-minded one (it
this is possible). Hav ing heard so
much about the computers that
are infiltrating society. I ven
tured into LOTS late one even
ing to try them lor myself. No
thing fancy, just a simple space
game or something fun like that.
With the aid of a friend (a real
account holder I. I logged in by
using some obscure code word
that I paid little attention to.
When I had logged in. volumes
ol instructions came rolling up
the screen at a rate taster than
even the most gifted Evelyn
Wood graduate could possibly
have read. The first sign that one
would have to have done this
many times before being able to
easily use a computer.
112 inally. I got to the game sec
tion of the computer by typing in
" help game." My choices flashed
before me: Adventure. Star
Trek. Galaxy, etc. Adventure
looked enticing. What could be
more exciting than a little adven
ture?
"Help Adventure."
"You are at a road with a river
and a forest ..." I gathered that
I should go somewhere.
"Follow river."
"You come to a cliff."'
"Jump off."

"Sorry. I don't understand
that." Or something to that af
fect.
I couldn't figure this out. The
computer doesn't understand?
This went against cverything that
I had been taught to believe.
0.K.. perhaps not everyone
jumps oft of cliffs when they
come to them, but I think com
puters should leave room tor
those of us who are less stable
than the average computer sci
ence major.
"I want to jump."
The computer didn't under
stand this either. If it wasn't an
inbred human tendency that had
been taken into account, the
computer was not prepared to
respond.
It reminded me of first quarter
when I asked a friend a question
about the readings in our
freshman English class. All he
said was that he didn't under
stand thui slut and that the only
reason he had taken the class was
to get the stupid requirement out
of the way. Me would write oft as
useless what he didn't have an
immediate answer for. It seems
that many share this attitude that
a class is stupid unless it helps in
advancing a career.
I decided to try another game.
"Help quit."

"Are you sure that you want to
quit now?"
"Yes."
I switched to Galaxy. I im
agined tun thrills in space, with
spaceships blazing through the
universe seeking and destroying
evil enemies. What I got were
written situations for which I was
to give strategic commands. I
kept trying to blow everything
up. The computer couldn't
handle this. Just like in Adven
ture, w hen 1 tried to give a typical
response to the computer, the
computer could not understand.
I don't think that it even tried,
though.
"Help quit."
This request produced a long
list of the possible responses, at
the end of which was "commmit
suicide." For some reason this
possibility was very appealing.
For a moment I wondered if
committing suicide is a fantasy

that we all share. Surely all of us
who have failed Calculus Ihave
considered it. I typed in the
called-for code to kill myself, but
I did not die. I found this very
distressing. Instead of perishing,
I was placed into another com
mand situation. Is this what
death holds for us? I tried to
commit suicide again, risking
being locked up in a mental in
stitution for the rest of my time
allocation. Again I lived.
I remembered the computer
having told me at the beginning
of my ordeal that if 1 needed help
from a human, to ask the one at
the terminal next to me. I asked
the human next to me if he would
help me commit suicide. He
stopped pounding on the keys
and smiled and said that he
would be happy to.
When he saw how I had been
playing, he became annoyed and
told me that I was wasting time. I

could imagine the computer tel
ling me the same thing, if it had
had the chance.
I realize that this was my first
experience with computers (the
first time is never good) and that
my reactions might not he as
educated as they should he. But
there seems to be a real lack of
originality in the computers.
Why is it that the computers
have so little room for imagina
tion? Who makes these things
anyway? Probably the guys who
have graduated with many hon
ors after having studied nothing
but computers for four years.
Seeing machines like the
LOTS computer, could anyone
say it's a shame to have distribu
tion requirements and to require
people to undertake a broad
program of studies?
