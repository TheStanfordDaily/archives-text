investigations' valid
In response to your editorial
"Hold Line on Sororities"
(Daily, May 17) there is some
gross misinformation regarding
sorority "investigations" that
needs clarifying.
Not all City Panhellenics func
tion exactly the same hut they
basically serve the same purpose,
that of seeking information for
prospective members which any
organization is entitled to as a
screening process in selecting its
members. It should be a conge
nial situation for both parties â€”
how else but by asking questions,
can you learn about a person?
II the ISC and/or the Univer
sity would allow more personal
data from the rushees at the
onset of rushing, the Panhel-
Icnics would not need to make
parental contacts.
There have never been in
quiries as to the family's income
or within the last eight years,
their church affiliation. Because
the sororities and the universities
wish to retain high academic
standards, poor grades can be a

deterrent to the girl as well as the
group.
You said they don't have the
right to ask these questions.
Every conversation is prefaced
with, "Would you mind answer
ing some questions about your
daughter?" The parent has the
right to refuse it they so desire.
My many years as an active
and an alumnae in the Greek sys
tem have been the most
cherished and rewarding for me.

Carter's tragic flaw
The tragic flaw of Jimmy Car
ter's presidency is not merely
that we have discovered that he
is human, but that he admits it.
The notion that the President of
the United States is not an avatar
is abhorrent to us hero-seeking
commoners.
Right off the bat Jimmy Carter
told us everything we didn't want
to hear. And what's more is he
keeps telling us.
Just last summer he publicly
announced he'd made a mistake
in the ehixising of his cabinet and

it was time to rectify that error.
And think back to his admission
of reevaluating the intention of
Soviet aggression. How dare he
he so honest about his human
ness. Ronald Reagan would cer
tainly never let us down like that.
Contrary to our former Gov
ernor's opinion. Carter has not
been the cause of the decline of
American supremacy in the
world. That position was chal
lenged over three decades ago,
when the available technology of
modern weapons surpassed the
boundaries of traditional global
superiority.
Carter certainly has his weak
nesses, and I doubt he'll ever go
down in the history books as one
of our most brilliant leaders.
Electing him for the next four
years may not bring guarantees
of economic prosperity, but we
can trust his reaction to threats of
war will be to pursue every pos
sible alternative to ensure peace.
And in this day and age, peace is
truly the only viable alternative.
