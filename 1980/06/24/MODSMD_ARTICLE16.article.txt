## America bullies Iran 
### 
ine current tactic oi tne car
ter administration is to take the
spotlight off the confrontation
building in the Persian Gulf.
But no one should be deceived
that this represents any shift in
strategic policy. The U.S. is still
in the process of assembling a
powerful strike force in the Ara
bian Sea that now includes a fleet
of four aircraft carriers, dozens
of ships and tens of thousands of
Marines.
The prevailing patient attitude
may well be a tactic open to sud
den reversal, just as the con
ciliatory line pursued early in the
spring was a smokescreen to di
vert attention from the setting up
of the adventure that left eight
Americans dead in the Iranian
desert.
The primary motivation for
the U.S. build-up in the Gulf reg
ion is to signal that the U.S. in
tends to try to assure the flow of
oil to the West by military force if
necessary — that it is willing to
shed blood for oil. Rather than
adjust its own behavior to chang
ing realities, the U.S. is intent on
trying to salvage its historic pol
icy of imperialist appropriation
in areas of the world unable to
match it in military strength.
Lest we forget — and the ad
ministration is doing everything
it can to distract our attention
from this — it was the U.S. that
put the Shah back on the throne
of Iran after he was driven from
the country by masses of Iranians
who had the effrontery to
suggest that the oil under their
soil belonged to them rather than

American anu British oil com
panies.
In order to keep the Shah in
power, the U.S. took charge ot
training one of the most repres
sive secret police forces in the
Third World, the SAVAk. To
bolster the Shah's pestige as well
as our balance of trade, we sold
his regime billions of dollars of
sophisticated planes, radar,
ships, and other military equip
ment he had no conceivable use
for, except to patrol the Persian
Gulf for his benefactor. Mean
while. a large, displaced under
class grew in proportion to Iran's
"modernization."
When the Iranian people fi
nally rose up again and. undeter
red by this powerful repressive
apparatus, threw off the Shah for
good, it was not the irrational
featherings of religious fanatics,
but a clear headed assessment of
recent history that led the Ira
nians to blame a large part of
their suffering on the American
government.
By admitting the Shah to the
U.S. and thereby raising the
threat of a second attempt to re
store him to power, by refusing to
repudiate its past imperialist
policies, by amassing a powerful
fleet off Iran's borders, by refus
ing to rule out a second, inten
sified strike into Iran which
would surely lead to major
bloodshed, the U.S. has shown it
is more determined to rescue its
imperialist policy than the
American hostages.
