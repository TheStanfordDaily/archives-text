## Make new dorm solar-powered 
### 
As the plans for construction
of additional student residences
progress one very important
question remains unanswered:
will the University include active
solar hot water heating in the
scheduled new housing com
plex?
This may come as a surprise to
many of you as it has been mista
kenly interpreted in reports that
the University has already cho
sen to install active solar systems.
This is not so, as the University
has made no commitment to in
stall solar hot water heating in

the new dorms.
Stanford Energy Action's
(SEA) cash flow analysis has
shown that Stanford would save
one-half to one million dollars
during the system's first decade
of operation if solar heating is
used. With rising energy costs,
which eventually translate into
student costs, this savings should
be of interest to all students.
The least that will be done,
says the University, is that they
will plan to allow for retrofitting
in the design of the buildings.
This retrofitting would be dime
in five or ten years when they
foresee solar hot water heating
system as being more profitable.
This is not good enough. The
economics for installation are by
tar the best during the original
construction. By waiting ten
years Stanford will lose the
one-half to one million dollars in
savings and society will lose over
8000 barrels ol oil â€” energy that
could have been supplied by the
sun.

Santa Clara County has taken
action in resolving some energy
problems by mandating the in
stallation of solar hot water
heaters in new residences alter
the end of this year, and retrofit
ting houses upon sale after
January 1. 1953 Unfortunately,
through a technicality Stanford's
new dorm will probably not tall
under this mandate.
The Stanford community has
given support to this solar hot
water heating project. The
ASSU Senate passed a resolu
tion urging the University to in
stall solar hot water systems.
SKA circulated a petition and ef
fortlessly collected signatures
from over 650 students and fa
culty who support solarizing the
new residences. These petitions
have been presented to project
coordinator Robert Nerrie.
Now is the time for the Uni
versity to act.
