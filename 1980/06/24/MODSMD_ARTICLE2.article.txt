# Advisory Board reaffirms original Franklin decision
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
The Stanford Advisory Board
has unanimously decided to reaf
firm the dismissal of former Uni
versity professor Bruce Franklin.
President Richard Lyman has
accepted the decision and has
asked the Board of Trustees to
concur in his decision. The trus
tees will consider the president's
decision at a special meeting July
14.
Franklin, now a tenured pro
fessor at Rutgers University, was
penalized in 1972 after he was
found guilty on three charges of
misconduct.
President Lyman requested
reconsideration of Franklin's
case after the Superior Court of
Santa Clara County issued a de
cision finding Franklin not guilty
on one of the three counts in
1978.
"We do not believe that the
question of penalty is much af
fected by whether Prof. Franklin
incited and precipitated danger
ous and disruptive activities on
three occasions on the same day
or only on two, or even one," the
Board said in its recent 6-0 deci
sion.
Disruptive function
"His purpose on each occa
sion, according to the findings of
the 1972 Board, was to disrupt
the normal functioning of Stan
ford University because of its
supposed responsibility for im
perialism and the Vietnam War,
and to do whatever he could to
encourage disruptive and de
structive conduct while
safeguarding his own position as
a tenured professor.
"In calmer circumstances he
might have had little chance of
success, but in the super-excited
atmosphere of February, 1971,
he was able to have a substantial
destructive influence."
The earlier Board's decision
rested on evidence gathered
from 33 days of open hearings
concerning the instances of mis
conduct.
Three guilty counts
By a unanimous vote, that
original Board found Franklin
guilty of inciting a crowd at
White Plaze to illegally occupy
the Stanford Computation
Center under circumstances
where there was a risk of serious
damage to the computer and to
its users.

On a split vote of 5-2, Franklin
was also found guilty of interfer
ing with police attempts to dis
perse the demonstration outside
the Computation Center by urg
ing and inciting students and
others to disregard or disobey
lawful police orders.
By the same vote, the first
Board found Franklin guilty of
intentionally urging and inciting
lawless and dangerous disruptive
activity in a speech delivered at
the Old Union Courtyard on the
night following the occupation of
the Computation Center.
Court reversal
Six years after this decision
was reached, the Superior Court
of Santa Clara County upheld
the first two decisions, but main
tained that the Old Union speech
was not punishable under judi
cial precedence.
Implementation of the
Superior Court's remand was de
layed by an appeal filed by Prof.
Franklin and a cross-appeal filed
by the University. The appellate
courts dismissed these appeals as
premature last February, and
Lyman then referred the case to
the current Advisory Board to
decide it dismissal was still the
appropriate penalty for the two
charges upheld by the court.
In the ensuing decision
making process, the Board used
records from the 1972 proceed
ings and also considered
Franklin's case as presented by
the American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU).
'Chilling effect'
The ACLU argued that "any
major punitive sanction against
Prof. Franklin . . . for his pure
speech activity, in the historical
context of the protest movement
against the Vietnam War. would
be a gross betrayal of the \ allies
that the university should stand
for: academic freedom, indi
vidual liberty and fundamental
fairness."
One of the issues raised by the
ACLU in support of Franklin is
that his dismissal had a "chilling
effect" on academic freedom.
Eight professors here argued
in conjunction with the AO U
that there has been a noticeable
effect on academic trccdom
since Franklin was fired.
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Bernard Roth wrote in the
ACLU opening brief that, "the
firing of Bruce Franklin has con

tributed to a marked decline in
the diversity and activism of the
Stanford faculty."
History Prof. Harold Kahn
cited the "pattern ol junior fa
culty silence" as an indicator of
the decline in academic freedom.
Board response
The Board's recent decision
responds to these charges.
"Assertions by selected af
fiants concerning a supposed de
cline in academic freedom at
Stanford do not persuade us. In
our opinion, academic freedom
at Stanford remains in a healthy
state."
Franklin's case was addition
ally controversial because he was
the first tenured professor to be

dismissed from Stanford in the
last 50 years.
"This case raises important
questions of academic
freedom — on both sides." the
six members of the Board de
clared.
"As professors at Stanford
University, we are keenly iiw;»re
ot the enormous importance ot
protecting the freedom of faculty
members to speak and publish
their views and to engage in ac
tivity which may he resented by
persons in positions of authority.
Freedom for all
"As tenured members ot the
Stanford faculty, and as elected
representatives of the faculty as a
whole, we appreciate the critical

role ot tenure in protecting
academic freedom.
"But the politically active pro
fessor is not the only member ol
the University community w ho is
entitled to the protection ol
academic freedom. Those who
wish to engage in research.
teaching and learning. w\tW ot
without the assistance ol com
puters, have a right to he pro
tected from lawless and destruc
tive attacks, and from those who
abuse their position with the
University by inciting students
and others to such activity.
"Protection of the freedom ot
the individual faculty member is
ensured not b\ a total refusal to
punish incitement, but rather by
a guarantee that the conduct will
be judged by the professor's
academic peers, on the basis of
calm deliberation after a fair
hearing.
"The dismissal of Prof.
Franklin should be reaffirmed."
The current Advisory Board
includes Profs. James Adams,
mechanical engineering; Robert
Chase, surgery, Sidney Drell,
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center; Calvin Ouate, applied
physics; Eugene Webb,
Graduate School of Business;
and Albert Hastorf, human biol
ogy and psychology. It is headed
by Prof. William Clebsch, religi
ous studies.
Hastorf withdrew on his own
motion from the review because
he had been involved in the case
as a dean in 1971.
