# Lyons, Robinson spare scrutinized fraternity
## Zetes not suspended: placed under IFC control 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
Associate Dean tor Residen
tial Education Norm Robinson
has granted the Interfraternity
Council (IFC) full jurisdiction
o\er the /.eta Psi house for the
academic year 19K0-Kl.
By taking that action, he "held
in abeyance" the recommenda
tion ot Row Director Diana
Conklin that the Zetes lose their
residential privileges lor three
years
The fraternity house will be
"in receivership" with the IFC,
which means that the Council
will collect rent and damage
payments, have full authority to
dictate rules and evict any
member ot the house. Dean ol
Student Affairs James I yons
said that some possibilites tor
II C action might be requiring
meetings with minutes taken, a
substantial damage deposit, or
auditing of financial records.
Conklin said that Robinson's
decision is a "three-way win ' be
cause the Zetes keep their house,
the II C gets a chance to prove
itself an influential organization,
and the I niversity does not need
to handle the"day to day" dif
ficulties with the Zetes.
History of vandalism
The decision is .in attempt to
solve the problems ot theft and
vandalism by the /.etc actives
and pledges that have occurred
over the past several years. Some
ot the incidents cited by Conklin
in her report to Robinson were:
- May I 976. two separate ar
rests ot Zete pledges, one tor
stealing palm fronds on campus,
the other tor stealing lamps from
a Palo Alto restaurant and injur
ing a woman during the pledge's
escape
— June 1 V#7K. Zetes caused
more than $2000 in damage to
their house at the end ot the
academic year.
— Dec. 1479. Zetes burned a

Christmas tree on the Storey
House lawn, set oft fire extin
guishers (one aimed at a wo
man's face) with a resulting re
sponse from the tire department.
Jan. 1980. Zete credit
with the I niversitv Commissary
was cut oft due to a house debt
that had grown in one year to
exceed $20,000.
May 19N0, new damages
this quar'er estimated to exceed
$5000. Zete pledges were ap
prehended for theft of nets worth
SSOO from campus athletic
fields; theft ot bamboo, palm
fronds, plants and planter boxes
from priv ate homes and an office
in Palo Alto. One pledge ran
through a plate glass window at
the Zete house while trying to
elude police.
Consistent pattern
Conklin. upon recommending
suspension, insisted. "We're not
talking about sporadic incidents.
There has been consistent and
chronic theft within the house
and in the community." She
quoted a 1978 investigation of
Zete initiation activities: there is
"an attitude in the house which
has elevated stealing to the point
where it constitutes an integral
part of the perennial house tradi
tion. '
Zete house president, Scott
Penderson, countered that,
"Since (the University's final
warning) Feb. 4. no active
member has v andali/ed anything
in the outside community. Four
pledges stole some bamboo, but
they are not active members; we
can't take 17 pledges and lead
them by the hand."
Former II C' president John
Kinney concurred, saying "the
problems spring quarter were
due to a lack ot direct communi
cation between the actives and
the pledges. Unlike most frats,
the Zetes have no liason with
their pledges."

Deans' idea
According to the University
News Service, "The basic idea
(of letting the II C' handle the
Zetes) was developed by Robin
son and Lyons." Lyons added
that he and Robinson had
"thought through the idea of
suspension to (its) later stages"
w hen the IFC "wrote to us offer
ing to monitor the Zetes."
Lyons said that Kinney wrote
the dean's office, making some
"very convincing points." Lyons
cited the following:
— In the spirit ot self
government that the Residential
Education Office upholds, the

fraternities should have some say
in the decision to suspend hous
ing privileges.
— Suspending fraternities has
not solved the problem in the
past, as evidenced by the con
tinuing difficulties with Delta
Tau Delta, which has been
kicked off twice in eight years,
according to Lyons; and with the
Zetes. who have been suspended
once before.
— This is an opportunity for
the IFC and the frats to work
more cooperatively, exercising
their own power and authority.
Good chance
When asked about any pos

sihilities of laxness by the IFC,
Conklin replied that the Council
has "a lot at stake" here in terms
of effort, community opinion of
the fraternity system and its own
"value as a problem solver."
"I think they have a fairly
good chance of bringing it off.
The IFC has been a rather strong
organization this year," she said.
"The IFC will have to basically
give them on-site training on
what it means to be self
governing. The Council can do
anything it decides is necessary
to turn the house around. It's
kind of innovative," Conklin
concluded.

in Palo Alto. One pledge ran
through a plate glass window at
the Zete house while trying to
elude police.
Consistent pattern
Conklin. upon recommending
suspension, insisted. "We're not
talking about sporadic incidents.
There has been consistent and
chronic theft within the house
and in the community." She
quoted a 1978 investigation of
Zete initiation activities: there is
"an attitude in the house which
has elevated stealing to the point
where it constitutes an integral
part of the perennial house tradi
tion. '
Zete house president, Scott
Penderson, countered that,
"Since (the University's final
warning) Feb. 4. no active
member has v andali/ed anything
in the outside community. Four
pledges stole some bamboo, but
they are not active members; we
can't take 17 pledges and lead
them by the hand."
Former II C' president John
Kinney concurred, saying "the
problems spring quarter were
due to a lack ot direct communi
cation between the actives and
the pledges. Unlike most frats,
the Zetes have no liason with
their pledges."

Deans' idea
According to the University
News Service, "The basic idea
(of letting the II C' handle the
Zetes) was developed by Robin
son and Lyons." Lyons added
that he and Robinson had
"thought through the idea of
suspension to (its) later stages"
w hen the IFC "wrote to us offer
ing to monitor the Zetes."
Lyons said that Kinney wrote
the dean's office, making some
"very convincing points." Lyons
cited the following:
— In the spirit ot self
government that the Residential
Education Office upholds, the

fraternities should have some say
in the decision to suspend hous
ing privileges.
— Suspending fraternities has
not solved the problem in the
past, as evidenced by the con
tinuing difficulties with Delta
Tau Delta, which has been
kicked off twice in eight years,
according to Lyons; and with the
Zetes. who have been suspended
once before.
— This is an opportunity for
the IFC and the frats to work
more cooperatively, exercising
their own power and authority.
Good chance
When asked about any pos

sihilities of laxness by the IFC,
Conklin replied that the Council
has "a lot at stake" here in terms
of effort, community opinion of
the fraternity system and its own
"value as a problem solver."
"I think they have a fairly
good chance of bringing it off.
The IFC has been a rather strong
organization this year," she said.
"The IFC will have to basically
give them on-site training on
what it means to be self
governing. The Council can do
anything it decides is necessary
to turn the house around. It's
kind of innovative," Conklin
concluded.

member ot the house. Dean ol
Student Affairs James I yons
said that some possibilites tor
II C action might be requiring
meetings with minutes taken, a
substantial damage deposit, or
auditing of financial records.
Conklin said that Robinson's
decision is a "three-way win ' be
cause the Zetes keep their house,
the II C gets a chance to prove
itself an influential organization,
and the I niversity does not need
to handle the"day to day" dif
ficulties with the Zetes.
History of vandalism
The decision is .in attempt to
solve the problems ot theft and
vandalism by the /.etc actives
and pledges that have occurred
over the past several years. Some
ot the incidents cited by Conklin
in her report to Robinson were:
- May I 976. two separate ar
rests ot Zete pledges, one tor
stealing palm fronds on campus,
the other tor stealing lamps from

was cut oft due to a house debt
that had grown in one year to
exceed $20,000.
May 19N0, new damages

$5000. Zete pledges were ap
prehended for theft of nets worth
SSOO from campus athletic
fields; theft ot bamboo, palm
fronds, plants and planter boxes
