### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
A special exemption from the Health Care
Financing Administration's (HCFA) earlier deci
sion to reduce Medicare reimbursements to hospi
tals will avoid an estimated loss of $2 million for
Stanford Medical Center, officials announced last
Thursday.
This deficit was based on the former reimburse
ment ratio of $169 paid to $192 charged for a
ward room.
HCFA stated in a letter to the area's Medicare
intermediary. Blue Cross of Northern California,
that limits on reimbursements by the federal gov
ernment for hospital services to Medicare patients
will be lifted, and all losses incurred since last Sep
tember, when the decision was made, will be re
stored retroactively.
The exemption was granted uniquely to Stanford
Med Center as the result of a year of petitioning by
University officials. HCFA recognized that though
California patients pay more for hospital care, they
receive "more intensive" service and so average a
relatively shorter period of hospital stay.
Despite the grant, the Med Center does not plan

to lower current hospital rates of $2 14 tor a private
room, $192. semi-private, and $ I 7S. ward room
Room rates were increased last year when Medi
care announced its reimbursement decrease. Ac
cording to the hospital news bureau, this grant will
only keep hospital costs from rising even more
under the former "penalty" of HCFA lowered
reimbursements.
Med Center Executive Director Dr. Peter J.
Levin was not available for further comment.
I he Med Center is now struggling to meet new
regulations on certification of interns now prop
osed by HCFA, for which officials estimate a cost
of $1.4 million to annual revenue.
Before the exemption, the Med Center had an
nounced an increase of 11.6 percent from last year,
working out to an average of $20 per month tor
daily room rates. Directors had planned to raise
charges to non-Medicare patients, forgo new con
struction and "compromise the quality of patient
services."
lor other state hospitals, HO A s reimburse
ment limits represent a loss of $13 million and
affect 40 percent of the average hospital patient
population.
