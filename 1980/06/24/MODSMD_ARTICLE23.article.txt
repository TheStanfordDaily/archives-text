Work for the Daily this summer. We're looking for
anyone with a little ingenuity and ability to use it. How about
that cartoon strip you've been casually scribbling for years?
Or the perfect feature article you've always visualized but
never seen in print?
We want to infuse the Daily with some new vigor this
summer, and only you can help us out. Stop by the office in
the Storke Publications Building anytime, and join in the
innovation.
