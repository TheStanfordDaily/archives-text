# Escondido: a world in itself
## 
### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
The name Escondido Village
is indeed a misnomer. The Vil
lage houses 2750 adults and
about 750 children. The area is
abuzz with the speech ot over 24
languages and the sounds ol
gurgling infants and rambuncti
ous children. The Spanish word
escondido, meaning hidden,
does not here apply.
Housing in the Village is avail
able to all married under
graduate students, all graduate
students, both married and
single, and all students with
families.
Like everywhere else on cam
pus. housing is limited and wait
ing lists are long. Rent in the Vil
lage is cheaper than most off
campus housing. Because of the
current lack of affordable hous
ing in the surrounding area, the
Village expects housing waiting
lists next fall to be even worse.
Half and a quarter
But the Village, begun in
is now large enough to
house approximately one-halt of
the single graduate students and
one-quarter of the married

graduate students here.
Recent changes made by the
University administration are al
lowing for better Village ad
ministration and for more active
involvement by those living in
the Village.
Last September, the position
of Village Director was created.
The Director is given an assistant
dean ot students position and is
responsible for giving housing
assignments, discussing indi
vidual student petitions and
coordinating the Village orienta
tion program.
Jan Marx, the new director,
said. "1 am hying to get even
more organization in the Village.
The Village has tremendous po
tential. Strong student govern
ment is the key to services im
provement."
Village Council
In the past, the Village has
been governed by the Village
Council that was both a social
and political organization. The
Council was responsible for or
ganizing such social activities as
the annual flea market and for
political activities involving
housing maintenance, residents'

rent, and other policy concerns.
Marx has developed a new
idea for forming what she calls
the "Neighborhood Network."
The new network will work in
conjunction with the Village
Council and the Village ad
ministration.
" I support the concept very
strongly, but as of yet we've not
had enough participation. 1 hope
the neighborhood concept
works," she said.
Neighborhoods
The program involves dividing
the Village into 22 neighbor
hoods both by geographic
placement and population of
each area. Each neighborhood
will be headed by a neighbor
hood coordinator who will over
see the concerns of his or her
neighbors; the coordinator's
duties will be "similar to those of
a dorm president, only more so,"
said Marx.
The coordinator will organize
his or her district's social ac
tivities as well as collect resi
dents' feedback to meet the
needs of that particular
neighborhood.
The Village will air a pilot pro
ject involving eight neighbor
hoods this fall. Elections for
neighborhood coordinators took
place last week. Elizabeth
Johnson, a student spouse run
ning for a coordinator position,
was pessimistic about the re
sponse of Village residents.
"(Village) people are lethargic.
They don't seem to want to do
anything," she said.
She said that she had arranged
a meeting to decide her
neighborhood's nominations
and no one had shown up, so, she
decided to run. Johnson is also
editor of the Village Express, the
Village newspaper. She writes
many of the articles herself.
Community atmosphere
Marx said she hoped the net
work system will create more of a
community atmosphere in the
Village. She compared the Vil
lage to a small town. Like a small
town, she said, many residents
know each other and all are un
ited by their ties to the Univer
sity. The Village runs on the
academic calendar.
Although some students tend
to feel isolated in the Village,
many are involved in the various
programs offered to aquaint

themselves with the Village, the
campus, and often to liv ing in the
United States. Forty percent of
the village's residents aie from
foreign countires.
Ma Patel, a graduate student in
the communications department
from India, found the structure
of the Village useful in acclimat
ing herself to the United States
and to Stanford.
Active high rise
"1 didn't know anybody. Es
condido Village has been most
convenient. My high rise is quite
active," she said. Patel said that
though many of her friends are
Indian, through the Village ac
tivities she had made many
friends from all over the world.
The nature of the Village de
mography which includes stu
dents, student spouses, foreign
families and children, makes
necessary the implementation of
special programs to accommo
date these groups.
The largest of these programs
is the Village nursery school Fun
by a parent cooperative. The Vil
lage Infant Center, also a

cooperative, cares for the needs
of children under the age of one.
YWCA
Also, the Escondido Village
YWCA, located in the Village
Center, features a wide variety of
resource programs to all Stan
ford students and their families.
Much of their programming is
oriented toward the non
working student spouse, many of
whom are international women,
said Gail McLellan, YWCA di
rector.
Currently no adult support
groups are sponsored through
the Village hut McLellan said it
is important for the residents to
know there are options so they
can set up programs.
Marx, too, echoed these con
cerns. "I am concerned with the
quality of life in Escondido Vil
lage. If people have strong per
ceptions of what they feel needs
changing, I am open to ideas,"
she said.
The Village also offers several
community areas for free use, by
the residents in which to offer
classes, hold meetings or use as
activity space.

a dorm president, only more so,"
said Marx.
The coordinator will organize
his or her district's social ac
tivities as well as collect resi
dents' feedback to meet the
needs of that particular
neighborhood.
The Village will air a pilot pro
ject involving eight neighbor
hoods this fall. Elections for
neighborhood coordinators took
place last week. Elizabeth
Johnson, a student spouse run
ning for a coordinator position,
was pessimistic about the re
sponse of Village residents.
"(Village) people are lethargic.
They don't seem to want to do
anything," she said.
She said that she had arranged
a meeting to decide her
neighborhood's nominations
and no one had shown up, so, she
decided to run. Johnson is also
editor of the Village Express, the
Village newspaper. She writes
many of the articles herself.
Community atmosphere
Marx said she hoped the net
work system will create more of a
community atmosphere in the
Village. She compared the Vil
lage to a small town. Like a small
town, she said, many residents
know each other and all are un
ited by their ties to the Univer
sity. The Village runs on the
academic calendar.
Although some students tend
to feel isolated in the Village,
many are involved in the various
programs offered to aquaint

themselves with the Village, the
campus, and often to liv ing in the
United States. Forty percent of
the village's residents aie from
foreign countires.
Ma Patel, a graduate student in
the communications department
from India, found the structure
of the Village useful in acclimat
ing herself to the United States
and to Stanford.
Active high rise
"1 didn't know anybody. Es
condido Village has been most
convenient. My high rise is quite
active," she said. Patel said that
though many of her friends are
Indian, through the Village ac
tivities she had made many
friends from all over the world.
The nature of the Village de
mography which includes stu
dents, student spouses, foreign
families and children, makes
necessary the implementation of
special programs to accommo
date these groups.
The largest of these programs
is the Village nursery school Fun
by a parent cooperative. The Vil
lage Infant Center, also a

cooperative, cares for the needs
of children under the age of one.
YWCA
Also, the Escondido Village
YWCA, located in the Village
Center, features a wide variety of
resource programs to all Stan
ford students and their families.
Much of their programming is
oriented toward the non
working student spouse, many of
whom are international women,
said Gail McLellan, YWCA di
rector.
Currently no adult support
groups are sponsored through
the Village hut McLellan said it
is important for the residents to
know there are options so they
can set up programs.
Marx, too, echoed these con
cerns. "I am concerned with the
quality of life in Escondido Vil
lage. If people have strong per
ceptions of what they feel needs
changing, I am open to ideas,"
she said.
The Village also offers several
community areas for free use, by
the residents in which to offer
classes, hold meetings or use as
activity space.


The name Escondido Village
is indeed a misnomer. The Vil
lage houses 2750 adults and
about 750 children. The area is
abuzz with the speech ot over 24
languages and the sounds ol
gurgling infants and rambuncti
ous children. The Spanish word
escondido, meaning hidden,
does not here apply.
Housing in the Village is avail
able to all married under
graduate students, all graduate
students, both married and
single, and all students with
families.
Like everywhere else on cam
pus. housing is limited and wait
ing lists are long. Rent in the Vil
lage is cheaper than most off
campus housing. Because of the
current lack of affordable hous
ing in the surrounding area, the
Village expects housing waiting
lists next fall to be even worse.
Half and a quarter
But the Village, begun in
is now large enough to
house approximately one-halt of
the single graduate students and
one-quarter of the married

graduate students here.
Recent changes made by the
University administration are al
lowing for better Village ad
ministration and for more active
involvement by those living in
the Village.
Last September, the position
of Village Director was created.
The Director is given an assistant
dean ot students position and is
responsible for giving housing
assignments, discussing indi
vidual student petitions and
coordinating the Village orienta
tion program.
Jan Marx, the new director,
said. "1 am hying to get even
more organization in the Village.
The Village has tremendous po
tential. Strong student govern
ment is the key to services im
provement."
Village Council
In the past, the Village has
been governed by the Village
Council that was both a social
and political organization. The
Council was responsible for or
ganizing such social activities as
the annual flea market and for
political activities involving
housing maintenance, residents'

rent, and other policy concerns.
Marx has developed a new
idea for forming what she calls
the "Neighborhood Network."
The new network will work in
conjunction with the Village
Council and the Village ad
ministration.
" I support the concept very
strongly, but as of yet we've not
had enough participation. 1 hope
the neighborhood concept
works," she said.
Neighborhoods
The program involves dividing
the Village into 22 neighbor
hoods both by geographic
placement and population of
each area. Each neighborhood
will be headed by a neighbor
hood coordinator who will over
see the concerns of his or her
neighbors; the coordinator's
duties will be "similar to those of
a dorm president, only more so,"
said Marx.
The coordinator will organize
his or her district's social ac
tivities as well as collect resi
