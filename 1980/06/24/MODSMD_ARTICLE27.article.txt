Renaissance man
Next President Lyman intro
duced Commencement Speaker
Dr. Thomas as "a man for ail
seasons."
Declaring that the human
species is "not necessarily good
at anything in particular except
language, and using this we tend
to get things wrong," Thomas set
out his view of the world as an
organism in its embryonic stage,
with human beings becoming
"the central nervous system for

the whole system.
" I even like the notion that our
cities, still primitive, archaic,
fragile sructures, could turn into
the precursors of ganglia, to he
ultimately linked in a network
around this planet," stated
Thomas, the president and chief
executive officer of the Memo
rial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York.
Awards
After the commencement
speech, the Walter J. Gores Fa
culty Achievement Awards were
given to Profs. Henry Riggs (in
dustrial engineering and en
gineering management) and
Eleanor Macoby (psychology),
and to graduate student John
Willison (physics).
The Lloyd W. Dinkelspiel
Awards were given to History
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, English
Prof. Ronald Rebholz. social
worker Leah Kaplan, and
graduating seniors Gray Boyce
and Peter Salovey.
Following this. Lyman gave a
farewell speech in which he
criticized the mood of the Stan
ford campus ten years ago as hav
ing "the climate of \ indent hos
tility among people who should
have been colleagues in the
common endeavor of learning."
He lamented the "distressing"
actions he felt he had to take,
"particularly a degree of reliance
on police power." However, he
said he viewed those actions "in
no spirit of apology" and drew a
correlation between his decision
to call in the police and the deci
sion of a sick individual to
"choose the surgeon over the
mortician." â€ž
Mixed sentiment
Stating he felt, in some ways,
like many of the graduates.
Lyman said "Jing and I take
leave of this place with a strange
mixture of sadness at leaving and
eager anticipation of our next
steps."
Following Lyman's speech.
Chancellor Wallace Sterling
hailed the departing president as
"truly a leader in education" in
the United States and said
Lyman takes with him as he
leaves "a cornucopia of good
wishes." Next. President of the

Board of Trustees Peter Bing
paid tribute to Mrs. Lyman as a
"primary force" for fair housing
nationwide and by saying "her
style was the warm and convivial
dinner from which no one ever
wanted to go home."
When the official commence
ment activities were over, Dean
of the Chapel Robert
Hamerton-Kelly gave the bene
diction and the graduates of the
Class of 1980 left under the re
cessional of "All Right Now."
Learn more
In his commencement speech,
Thomas described humans as
puzzled and claimed "we have
been selected in evolution of our
gift of ambiguity." Stating "our

place in the life of the world is
still unfathomable because we
have so much to learn," he said
there is no hope of understand
ing our role in the world except
by learning more, part of this
learning being through "science,
more and better science."
'"Having been given brains
with a certain power but limited
by a certain fallibility, we are bet
ter equipped for finding our way
through the future," he said.
Long life
Calling our species "a tissue
for the earth's awareness."
Thomas refuted the gloomy pre
dictions by some that we are
doomed to a quick extinction.
" Remembering how skilled

our species is with language and
metaphor, almost from birth,
how good we are at recognizing
and recording our mistakes, and
how spectacularly we excel all
othercreatures on this planet be
cause of the presence in our
midst, from time to time, ol
people like Johann Sebastian
Bach and Mark Twain as display
ing tor all the world what we can
do as a species with our brains
when we put our minds to it, and
remembering that Nature is by
nature parsimonious, tending to
hang on to useful things when
they really do work. I have hopes
for our survival into maturity."
Dr. Thomas concluded his
speech.
