# Graduation a chore for registrar
## 
### 
Commencement is a joyous
occasion for graduates and their
families, but it is a hectic period
for the Registrar's Office.
During the past year, students
have earned a total of about
4000 degrees, including 1800
undergraduate and 2200
graduate and professional de
grees, according to Registrar
Sally Mahoney.
About 2500 diplomas were
presented in 30 separate de
partmental ceremonies follow
ing the Frost Amphitheater
commencement June 15. The
remaining 1500 were sent out by
first class mail the following
Monday.
About 25 members ol the re
gistrar's staff, working with indi
vidual liaisons in each depart
ment. tried to meet the indi
vidualized needs of all graduates
the week before the actual cere
monies.
The deadline forcourse grades
to be submitted by faculty was
Thursday noon, June 12. Six
hours later, computerized data
was available indicating whether
students had completed their re
quirements and course work
satisfactorily.
Assistant Registrar Michelle
Moore then contacted Ifi7 stu
dents whose graduation status

remained uncertain, urging them
to resolve their problems by Fri
day noon. By Saturday after
noon. only 4 1 remained on this
doubtful list.
About 50 students, whose
work remained incomplete, ar
ranged in advance to participate
as "walk throughs" in the dip
loma ceremonies. Around 30
more were added in the lmal two
days. Instead of receiv ing actual
degrees, these students obtained
official "walk through" certifi
cates, including their names and

requests to return the portfolios.
"We feel commencement
ought to be a pleasant occasion."
Mahoney said. "There's no prob
lem in having students partici
pate. so long as they and we
clearly understand the condi
tions tor the walk throughs."
Members ot the registrar's
stall worked until 1 1 p.m. Satur
day to place the red diploma
portfolios in proper sequence for
each ceremony. Tied in red rib
bons. the papers were picked up
at 8:30 a.m. Sunday.
