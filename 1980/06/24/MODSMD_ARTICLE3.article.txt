# University refuses to host alternate Olympic track meet
## 
### Brad Brockbank Staff Writer 
Citing a lack of adequate
planning time and other obsta
cles, University officials last
Thursday declined to titter Stan
ford as host to a proposed "al
ternative Olympics" in track and
field this summer.
Stanford Stadium was the
latest site considered for the
meet, which would be open to
athletes from nations boycotting
the 19X0 Olympics in Moscow,
after plans to stage the competi
tion in Berkeley and Philadel
phia fell through. Hoping to sal
vage the meet for the West
Coast, San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein approached
newly-selected University Presi
dent Donald Kennedy with the
idea of making a bid for the
event. But after consideration
with Athletic Department and
Public Affairs officials here,
Kennedy announced the deci
sion to forgo making the offer
to host the meet.
Kennedy could not be reached
for comment yesterday, but was
quoted in I riday's.Sn/i Francisco
Chronicle saying. "We feel there
is simply not enough time to or
gani/c an event of this si/e anil
complexity. Additionally, we are
not convinced ot the guarantees
that the top athletes in track and
field would be available and wil

ling to compote in a meet of this
nature."
Berkeley had scheduled the
meet for July 17 and IK. hut it
was canceled last Tuesday by its
sponsor — The Athletics Con
gress — following last minute ob
jections by some Berkeley city
council members. Veronika
Fukson. a council member, ex
pressed concerns about the po
tential for political violence and
the abilities of the local police
force to provide adequate sec
urity. Supporters ol the meet
charged that opponents were
merely concerned about the
damage to Berkeley s"l ettist im
age" if the city was to host a meet
in defiance of the Olympics in
Moscow.
Though no official action was
taken at the council meeting.
Athletics Congress Executive
Director Ollan Cassell sub
sequently canceled the meet,
claiming that "comment by
politicians in Berkeley has
created an unfavorable climate
in which to hold this competi
tion," according to the Chroni
cle.
Obstacles abound
Though Palo Alto city officials
expressed no qualms about the
meet and. in fact, supported the
idea ol holding it here, there
were just too many organiza
tional obstacles to overcome, ac

cording to Assistant Athletic Di
rector Gary Cavalli.
Besides the inadequate time
(less than a month) to plan such
an event. Ca\ alii said the "inter
nal politicing" between the In
ternational Amateur Athletic
Foundation (lAAI ). the United
States Olympic Committee and
the Athletics Congress raised
questions as to whether the meet
would occur at all.
Similar concerns prompted
University ot Pennsylvania Ath
letic Director Charles Harris to
withdraw his school as a site lor
one ol the meets. According to
the Chronicle. Harris could not
be assured the lAAI- would not
take sanctions against the
athletes (and their nations) who
would compete in the meet, si nee
the scheduled dates lor the
Philadelphia meet — July 22 and
23 — conflicted with the opening
ceremonies of the Moscow
Olympics.
Tour conflicts
In addition, the athletes
scheduled to compete in these
"alternative Olympics" would
be in the middle of a European
tour and are scheduled to be in
Oslo. Norway on July 15. Both
Harris and officials here vsere
understandably concerned about
participation at American meets
less than a week later. There was
the "potential to host the biggest
flop in the world," said Harris.
Plans to hold the meet here
would have been further compli
cated by the lack of available
housing on campus, Cavalli said.
And finally, plans to renovate
the football field in Stanford
Stadium in mid-August posed
another obstacle.
Cavalii, Athletic Director
Andy Geiger and Vice President
for Public Affairs Robert
Rosenzweig all stressed that
politics played no part in the de

cision not to make a bid tor the
meet.
"The decision was made solely
on the merits of our ability to do
it," Rosenzweig said. He said he
personally believed the objec
tions raised by the members of
the Berkeley city council to be
"ridiculous," and said he did not
believe hosting such a meet
would represent tacit support of
President Jimmy Carter's deci
sion to boycott the Summer
Olympics.
"I don't think universities
should have foreign policies,"
Rosenzweig added.
