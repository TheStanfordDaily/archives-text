# Graduation was more than diploma
## 
### Chris Greene Staff Writer 
Graduation weekend is a great deal more than
commencement ceremonies. Graduates are franti
cally packing those last items, going for a drink with
friends one last time, nursing hangovers (from
those final har-crawls), attending scheduled ac
tivities such as the Baccalaureate Service and
Senior Class Day, and trying to find time to spend
with their parents so they don't get too upset.
The first activity of the weekend was the Bac
calaureate Service in the Inner Quad on Saturday,
June 14 at 9:30 a.m. The graduates marched to
their seats under the banner of their school.
A powerful and very emotional sermon was deli
vered by Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, the National
Director for lnterreligious Affairs of the American
Jewish Committee. He spoke of his efforts to aid
the "boat people" who tied Vietnam in 1978 and of
the tremendous human suffering these people en
dured while the world community watched.
After the service, members of the senior class
met in the southwest corner of the Quad for the
ceremony of the laying of the class plaque.
Vice President and Provost Donald Kennedy
said that it would take 512 such plaques before the
Quad was completely circled once. He noted that
this was considerably less than the 626 calculated
by the University's first president, David Starr Jor

dan. Though Jordan's figure has been incorrectly
used for the past 83 years. Kennedy was heartened,
saying, "We gain a renewed sense of the dynamism
of knowledge and the ephemerality of conviction."
Seniors and their families walked from the
plaque-laying ceremony to Bowman Grove for the
senior-parent luncheon, organized by the Senior
Class Presidents and Bowman Alumni Associa
tion.
In addition to box lunches, the crowd of over
4000 was provided with a series of speakers, in
cluding Dean of Undergraduate Admissions Fred
Hargadon, Political Science Prof. Nannerl
Keohane, Stanford Alumni Association Director
William Stone and President Mary Carrol Scott,
and University President Richard Lyman.
During the lunch, a gift of a set of books was
given to the University by the Class of I 980 in the
name of Lyman, a noted bibliophile. Also an
nounced was the recipient of the J.E. Wallace Sterl
ing Award, Peter Stamos, for his potential to be of
continuing service to the University.
Saturday's official activities ended with a recep
tion by Lyman at his residence the Lou Henry
Hoover House. Refreshments were served on the
spacious lawn in front of the house. The reception
line to greet President and Mrs. Lyman and Presi
dent of the Board of Trustees Peter Bing and his
wife contained over 100 people for most of the
afternoon.
