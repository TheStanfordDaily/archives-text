# Supreme Court patent decision could benefit Stanford research
## 
### Kick Altman Staff Writer 
Last week's Supreme Court
ruling that man-made microor
ganisms are patentable was re
ceived quite favorably by much
of the affected research center
here.
The Court's 5-4 decision has
set a precendent that could result
in the University receiving royal
ties from every company that ex
periements in genetic engineer
ing.
In 1974, Stanford Prof. Stan
ley Cohen and UC'-Berkeley
Prof. Herbert Boyer applied for
a patent for their gene-splicing
technique for recombinant DNA
that makes most genetic ex
perimentation possible.
This Stanford—UC-Berkeley
application had been suspended
pending the outcome of the Sup
reme Court ruling. It is now ex
pected that the patent will be
granted and the two universities
will obtain rights to the process
of genetic engineering.
For example. General Electric
could patent its oil-eating
microbe —the organism that
prompted the Supreme Court
decision — but if GE were to use
the gene-splicing technique for
its microbe, it would have to pay
a royalty to Stanford and Ber
keley.
Good decision
" I think the Supreme Court deci
sion is a good one," said Niels
Reimers. manager of technology
licensing here. "It is an impor
tant affirmation of patent rights
which provide vital incentives for
invention in this rapidly expand
ing field of knowledge."
A "field of knowledge" is the
best way to presently describe
the ideas of recombinant DNA.
as there is no large-scale applica
tion being implemented — only
experimental production. GE's

oil-eater, for instance, may
never perform the services
theory says it will.
"The burden of proof in an
open environment," Reimers
said, "will just be too much. But
really, we could care less about
what GE is going to do with their
microbe that eats oil. The impor
tant thing is the patent applica
tion that we have had on file for
six years. We hope that now it
can go forward."
No moral judgment
The Supreme Court did not
make a moral judgment; it did
not address man's place in exper
imenting with life. It only inter
preted the Constitution's proc
lamation concerning patenting.
"If there is any moral issue to
this it should be brought before
the legislature. The patent has
nothing to do with that," Reim
ers said.
"But if ours is the basic patent
that underlines the whole field,"
he continued, "we will require all
industrial licensees to follow the
biological and safety procedures
of the guidelines for recombin
ant DNA.
"You're not going to see any
body engineering people. That's
not quite at our level."
Cohen quiet
Cohen, who pioneered the
gene-splicing technique with
Boyer, gave up all of his royalty
rights to the University. He was
terse, almost bitter, in response
to questioning about the patent.
"I really haven't thought
about it, frankly," he said. "One
of the conditions of allowing
Stanford to apply for a patent in
my name was that I would eive

up all royalties. I've done that,
and I've since stayed as far away
from the whole issue as possible.
I've read in the papers about the
Supreme Court decision, but
that's really all 1 know about it. I
just have no thought about it."
Reimers believes that the ac
ceptance of the Stanford-
Berkeley patent will not affect
research at either university. It
will come into effect only in the
packaging and selling of pro
ducts using gene-splicing.
He also believes the public will
be better informed about mic
robiological research once it is
protected by a patent.

"Without this protection, U.S.
industry would have been at a
significant disadvantage in trying
to get the results of these dis
coveries to the public. Further
more, international competitors
could simply duplicate the mate
rial elsewhere and sell the un
patented products in the U. 5.,"
Reimer said.
"The overall effect of the deci
sion should be to encourage
prompt and full disclosure on in
ventions, accelerate their com
mercial development and thus
bring beneficial results of mic
robiological research to the pub
lic earlier," he asserted.
Provost and next President
Donald Kennedy said of the
Supreme Court decision, "We're
very pleased and proud ot the
fact that some of the critical dis
coveries were done here. We're
pleased, too. that the patent has
been assigned, but what kinds of
income it will produce I think is
an awfully speculative matter."

industry would have been at a
significant disadvantage in trying
to get the results of these dis
coveries to the public. Further
more, international competitors
could simply duplicate the mate
rial elsewhere and sell the un
patented products in the U. 5.,"
Reimer said.
"The overall effect of the deci
sion should be to encourage
prompt and full disclosure on in
ventions, accelerate their com
mercial development and thus
bring beneficial results of mic
robiological research to the pub
lic earlier," he asserted.
Provost and next President
Donald Kennedy said of the
Supreme Court decision, "We're
very pleased and proud ot the
fact that some of the critical dis
coveries were done here. We're
pleased, too. that the patent has
been assigned, but what kinds of
income it will produce I think is
an awfully speculative matter."
Last week's Supreme Court
ruling that man-made microor
ganisms are patentable was re
ceived quite favorably by much
of the affected research center
here.
The Court's 5-4 decision has
set a precendent that could result
in the University receiving royal
ties from every company that ex
periements in genetic engineer
ing.
In 1974, Stanford Prof. Stan
ley Cohen and UC'-Berkeley
Prof. Herbert Boyer applied for
a patent for their gene-splicing
technique for recombinant DNA
that makes most genetic ex
perimentation possible.
This Stanford—UC-Berkeley
application had been suspended
pending the outcome of the Sup
reme Court ruling. It is now ex
pected that the patent will be
granted and the two universities
will obtain rights to the process
of genetic engineering.
For example. General Electric
could patent its oil-eating
microbe —the organism that
prompted the Supreme Court
decision — but if GE were to use
the gene-splicing technique for
its microbe, it would have to pay
a royalty to Stanford and Ber
keley.
Good decision
" I think the Supreme Court deci
sion is a good one," said Niels
Reimers. manager of technology
licensing here. "It is an impor
tant affirmation of patent rights
which provide vital incentives for
invention in this rapidly expand
ing field of knowledge."
A "field of knowledge" is the
best way to presently describe
the ideas of recombinant DNA.
as there is no large-scale applica
tion being implemented — only
experimental production. GE's

oil-eater, for instance, may
never perform the services
theory says it will.
"The burden of proof in an
open environment," Reimers
said, "will just be too much. But
really, we could care less about
what GE is going to do with their
microbe that eats oil. The impor
tant thing is the patent applica
tion that we have had on file for
six years. We hope that now it
can go forward."
No moral judgment
The Supreme Court did not
make a moral judgment; it did
not address man's place in exper
imenting with life. It only inter
preted the Constitution's proc
lamation concerning patenting.
"If there is any moral issue to
this it should be brought before
the legislature. The patent has
nothing to do with that," Reim
ers said.
"But if ours is the basic patent
that underlines the whole field,"
he continued, "we will require all
industrial licensees to follow the
biological and safety procedures
of the guidelines for recombin
ant DNA.
"You're not going to see any
body engineering people. That's
not quite at our level."
Cohen quiet
Cohen, who pioneered the
gene-splicing technique with
Boyer, gave up all of his royalty
rights to the University. He was
terse, almost bitter, in response
to questioning about the patent.
"I really haven't thought
about it, frankly," he said. "One
of the conditions of allowing
Stanford to apply for a patent in
my name was that I would eive

up all royalties. I've done that,
and I've since stayed as far away
from the whole issue as possible.
I've read in the papers about the
Supreme Court decision, but
that's really all 1 know about it. I
just have no thought about it."
Reimers believes that the ac
ceptance of the Stanford-
Berkeley patent will not affect
research at either university. It
will come into effect only in the
packaging and selling of pro
ducts using gene-splicing.
He also believes the public will
be better informed about mic
robiological research once it is
protected by a patent.
