SEOUL, South Korea —
South Korea's military rulers are
maneuvering for long-range
political control of the govern
ment by exposing corruption
among their civilian rivals and
preparing new benefits for the
country's one million govern
ment and army employees.
Officials say a pay boost for
government workers and sol
diers is on the way. to win sup
port for the small group of gen
erals now running the country
and prevent discontent over in
flation from fueling further polit
ical dissent. An unusual June IS
disclosure of massive fortunes
earned by leading civilian politi
cians also appears designed to
win support from average Ko
reans unhappy with the impact of
petty corruption on their own
lives.
The martial-law command
charged that nine former politi
cal officials now under deten
tion, including the head of the
nation's principal political party,
Kim Jong Pil, amassed
$142,185,000 through abuse of
political power, violating laws on
financial contributions, taxation,
foreign exchange control and
overseas property flight. The
nine were arrested the night of
May 17 in a general roundup of
political dissidents and possible
rivals to the influence of Lt. Gen.
Chon Doo Hwan, now leading a
small military group in effective
control of the government.
The government announce
ment said the nine agreed to for
sake any public office in the fu
ture and "voluntarily donate
property to the state" to repay
their debt to the governement.
The announcement said the gov
ernment decided to "reserve
criminal punishment." This was

seen as a way of limiting further
corruption and giving some jus
tification for what has been the
sudden end of civilian govern
ment here since the October As
sassination of President Park
Chung Hee.
The government, while keep
ing a tight lid on dissent since a
series of student riots and a mass
insurrection last month in the
city of Kwangju, loosened the
reins slightly yesterday by
reopening 23 colleges and uni
versities. These include graduate
schools, nursing colleges and
medical schools that have lacked
serious anti-government student
movements. Officials said more
of the approximately 150 col
leges still closed would be
opened gradually if no further
trouble developed.
Despite heavy publicity given
to a reported North Korean at
tempt Saturday to sneak nine
spies into the south by sea, foiled
when southern naval and air
forces sunk their boat, the gov
ernment said yesterday it would
continue to pursue talks in Pan
munjom over arrangements for a
meeting of North Korean and
South Korean prime ministers.
A spokesman for the southern
delegation said the northern de
legation had informed them,
however, that its leader, Hyon
Jun Guk, would be absent at a
session today because of "health
reasons." The South Korean de
legation spokesman said his
group would try to break a dead
lock in the talks by proposing a
deadline for holding of the prime
minister's meeting and a change
in the agenda.
In a move to demonstrate the
country's combat readiness in
the face of any threat from the
north, the government took cor
respondents Sunday on a rare
all-dav tour of new facilities.
