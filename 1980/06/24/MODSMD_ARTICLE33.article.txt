Love is a Sacrifice
Southside Johnny and the
Asbury Jukes
Mercury Records
It has been said that great
blues singers have to be black. If
ever a white man belied that
statement, it would be Southside
Johnny Lyon of Asbury Park.
New Jersey. On this, his fifth al
bum. (his first on the Mercury
label) however, Southside seems
to be straying further than usual
from his rhythm and blues roots.
Southside has never been one to
restrict his music to formal
genres, and on Love is a Sacrifice
he is fast closing in on rock'n'roll
territory . His material has always
been a unique and raucous com-

bination of rock and r & b,
sprinkled liberally with blasts
from his jazzy five piece horn
section. Love is a Sacrifice is a
distinct departure from the
Juke's previous style.
This album, like the Jukes'
last. The Jukes, leans heavily to
ward rock'n'roll. Gone is the re
liance on the horn section. In
stead, slowly but surely,
guitarists Billy Rush and Joel
Gramolini are beginning to
dominate the band. Most notici
ble on the last two albums has
been Rush's increasing strength
as a song-writer. Whereas the
first Jukes albums relied on
Motown soul covers and songs
written by Asbury Park cohort
Bruce Springsteen and E Stree
ter and former Juke Miamai

Steve Van Zandt. Rush has
taken over both writing and pro
ducing tasks completely.
However, Love is a Sacrifice is
a good album, but not a great
one. It suffers, as do all Jukes
albums, in the translation from
live show to recorded material.
The Jukes, who were in town last
week, have an incredible live
show which defies recording.
There is always a great discre
pancy between the overpower
ing intensity of the Jukes in con
cert and their comparatively
weak-spirited records. The
Jukes' excellence in concert
seems to hide any intrinsic flaws
in their material, which become
glaringly obvious on record.
Since they are no longer em
phasizing their strongest
area — Southside's incredible
r & b voice and the great horn
section — the Jukes seem to be
suffering an identity crisis. On
Love is a Sacrifice, the horns are
only used sparingly, as filler, and
Southside finds himself singing
less soulful material, less soul
fully.
Some of the songs on Sacrifice
are as strong as any other Jukes
material to date, but even these
have not progressed beyond the
narrow scope of vision that the
Jukes have previously shown.
Sacrifice is not a very consistent
album. Some songs, notably
"Murder" and the single
"Why?", as well as the title cut
and "Love When It's Strong."
are up to the Jukes' high stan
dards. They are as thrilling and

powerful as one expects a band
as tight and as talented as the
Asbury Jukes to be. Other cuts,
like "It Hurts" and "Keep Our
Love Simple" are disappoint
ingly below par — they are, in
fact, mundane. It is significant
that tiro Asbury Jukes are about
the least quotable band in the re
cording business, a fact which is
apparent from their song titles.
Choruses like "Murder, mur
der" and "On the beach, on the
beach, on the beach, beach," just
do not make good copy. Not that
this is the only criterium for rat
ing a song, as some of the best
rock songs around have perfectly
mindless lyrics, but it is interest
ing to note that if the word
"babv" was not in the English

language, Southside Johnny and
the Asbury Jukes probably could
not exist.
The Jukes' former record
company. Epic, seems to think
that this album will make the
Asbury Jukes a household word
(though that's what the critics
have said about their last two al
bums, too.) Acting accordingly,
they have packaged a "Greatest
Hits" album timed to be released
alongside Sacrifice, in order to
cash in on the Jukes' imminent
and long overdue commercial
success. If Love is a Sacrifice
makes Southside Johnny and the
Asbury Jukes famous, it will be
because they deserve to be, and
not because this album is as good
as they can be.
