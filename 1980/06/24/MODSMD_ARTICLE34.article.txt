## Beethoven's 9th in Opera House finale 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony
ended its long association with
the War Memorial Opera House
on June 14 with a performance
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony
that was sometimes thundering
and sometimes lyrical but always
precisely true to form.
The Symphony Orchestra and
the San Francisco Symphony
Chorus performed under con
ductor Hans Vonk. Vonk con
trolled the orchestra admirably
and they were especially respon
sive to his forceful guidance
through the more energetic por
tions of the symphony, notably
the end of the first movement,
the beginning of the second, and
the conclusion of the fourth
movement.
A work that is so familiar to
the audience as this one is a chal
lenge for a conductor to make
the music fresh. The extra care
Vonk put into this performance
and the extra time he spent in
teaching the orchestra exactly
how he wanted the piece to
sound was evident in the perfor
mance of each segment of the
orchestra. Most noteworthy
were the harmony and perfect
timing of the string sections and
the clarity of the horns.
The principal singers turned in
fine performances. They were
soprano Mary Shearer, mezzo
soprano Gwendolyn Jones,
tenor Jerold Norman, and
baritone Douglas Lawrence.
They sang Friedrich Schiller's
"Ode to Joy" with the true pas
sion this piece deserves.
This quartet was beautifully
supported by the chorus, whose
power was restrained until its

time came to rage over the heads
of the orchestra and out into the
audience. Chorus director Louis
Magor has attracted many
talented singers to the San Fran
cisco Chorus, and they displayed
their talent generously this night.
There were two minor distrac
tions from the beauty of this per
formance, however. First, Vonk
re-tuned the orchestra between
the second and third movements.
And while doing so is common
for this symphony, the accom
panying break in concentration
never fails to annoy me. Sec
ondly, Vonk, in his excitement at
mustering the forces of the or
chestra, often grunted loudly and
was quite audible from the first
few rows (1 was in the third). If
the passage was vibrant, his noise
was drowned out by the power of
the instruments. However, Vonk
was often excited at relatively
quiet passages, and at such times
he was at greater volume than
the orchestra.
The performance of the Sym
phony No. 9 marked the end of
the 1979-80 symphony season,
which concluded with fourteen
performances comprising the
Beethoven Festival. Next year,
the San Francisco Symphony will
perform in the Louise M. Davies
Symphony Hall, across the street
from the Opera House. Still
under construction, this hall is
considered quite an improve
ment from the Opera House,
which has been widely criticized
for its accoustical flaws.
Still, there is something quite
elegant about a fine performance
in that stately building, and for
one last time the San Francisco
Symphony provided one.
