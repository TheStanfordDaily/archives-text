## Parker keeps riding higher 
### 
The Up Escalator
Graham Parker and the
Rumour
Elektra Records
Masterfully combining the
frenetic vocals and urgent lyric
styles of today's better new wave
musicians with what he calls a
desire to "just write good pop
songs" has been Graham
Parker's forte for some time.
And he's proved it once again
with his new album on Elektra
Records, The Up Escalator.
Following up the critically
acclaimed Squeezing Out Sparks
lp of last year, which was
Parker's closest dabble into the
new wave, was not an easy chore.
Parker's own emotionally
wrought vocals, along with
Brinsley Schwartz's whining, yet
lyrical guitar lines made the
album one of '79's best, to be
sure.
Again, with Escalator, Parker
seems to be sticking with a good

thingâ€”the catchy guitar
dominated tunes and the lyrics
that make you feel like you're
eavesdropping on one of
Parker's personal conversations.
Parker is much like his fellow
countryman, Elvis Costcllo, in
the latter respect, often writing
songs about painful or embaras
sing situations with what seems
to be first-hand experience.
But unlike Costello, Parker is
not angry. He's just serious.
But that's not to say he doesn't
have a sense of humor, for
Parker's ability to look at the
way we live and have a good
laugh is one of his most appeal
ing qualities.
On Escalator's "Paralvzed,"

Parker sings:
I wait for you to disown me.
When you leave I won't look.
I wait for someone to phone me
With the phone off the hook.
The song, about freezing up in
awe of a potential lover, is typical
Parker. Undoubtedly he's been
in the situation before, for the
picture he paints is frighteningly
accurate.
But instead of getting angry
and denouncing the woman for
what is plainly his problem,
Parker is saying "Look at the
way I've behaved. Isn't it
stupid?"
Later, in "Jolie Jolie," Parker
tells another story of a lover
