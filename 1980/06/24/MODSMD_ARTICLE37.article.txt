## Parker keeps riding higher 
### 
The Up Escalator
Graham Parker and the
Rumour
Elektra Records
Masterfully combining the
frenetic vocals and urgent lyric
styles of today's better new wave
musicians with what he calls a
desire to "just write good pop
songs" has been Graham
Parker's forte for some time.
And he's proved it once again
with his new album on Elektra
Records, The Up Escalator.
Following up the critically
acclaimed Squeezing Out Sparks
lp of last year, which was
Parker's closest dabble into the
new wave, was not an easy chore.
Parker's own emotionally
wrought vocals, along with
Brinsley Schwartz's whining, yet
lyrical guitar lines made the
album one of '79's best, to be
sure.
Again, with Escalator, Parker
seems to be sticking with a good

thing—the catchy guitar
dominated tunes and the lyrics
that make you feel like you're
eavesdropping on one of
Parker's personal conversations.
Parker is much like his fellow
countryman, Elvis Costcllo, in
the latter respect, often writing
songs about painful or embaras
sing situations with what seems
to be first-hand experience.
But unlike Costello, Parker is
not angry. He's just serious.
But that's not to say he doesn't
have a sense of humor, for
Parker's ability to look at the
way we live and have a good
laugh is one of his most appeal
ing qualities.
On Escalator's "Paralvzed,"

Parker sings:
I wait for you to disown me.
When you leave I won't look.
I wait for someone to phone me
With the phone off the hook.
The song, about freezing up in
awe of a potential lover, is typical
Parker. Undoubtedly he's been
in the situation before, for the
picture he paints is frighteningly
accurate.
But instead of getting angry
and denouncing the woman for
what is plainly his problem,
Parker is saying "Look at the
way I've behaved. Isn't it
stupid?"
Later, in "Jolie Jolie," Parker
tells another story of a lover
who's got him wrapped around
her finger.
There's no remedy.
Just keep on vearnin' for the
sound of your voice.
I don 't use teardrops as weapons
by choice.
It's just the fallout from my eyes.
Songs like these, and several
others, like "Love Without
Greed" and"The Beating of
Another heart." reveal a man

who knows that love realh does
stink. Songs like "Love Gets
You Twisted," and "Local
Girls" from Sparks are of the
same, largely paranoid genre.
One of Escalator's most pleas
ant surprises is hacking \ocals by
none other then Bruce Springs
teen on "Endless Night." "The

Boss" and Parker work together
beautifully — "looking for the
switch that turns on the endless
night."
Parker deserves a great deal of
credit for getting Springsteen to
sing on this song, for who could
possibly know any more about
"the endless night?" No one, of
course.
Parker's cynicism and poking
wit are especially evident on
"Stupefaction," possibly the

lp's catchiest number. Here
Parker sings about a stupefied
race of people who are taken in
by billboards, greed, and the
mundanities of everyday life in
the city.
/ ask the landlord, "how much
you makin?
Don't you get tired of just takin'

and takin'?"
I ask my neighbor, "why are you
so stupid?
Givin us those dirty looks and
trying to murder cupid."
Overall Parker has made
another \ery good album. What
seems to be missing, however, is
some of the raw energy that got
especially squeezed out on
Sparks. There are few real
"bring-down-the-house" type
rockers like "Saturday Night Is
Dead" on this record. Parker has
instead opted for even more of a
pop sound.
It's a very classy sound,
though, far from much of the
"sugary" pop being produced
these days. Nicky Hopkins, who
replaces Bob Andrews on Es
calator, adds some excellent

keyboard work, and is a big part
of the album's total sound. While
Andrews was barely audible on
Sparks, Hopkins' piano even
carries the lead on a couple of

Escalator's songs, and makes a
very nice background to all the
cithers.
But because Hopkins gives the
album a more melodic flavor,
that does not mean it lacks that
"punch" which characterizes
Parkers' other work. The force

behind that punch would, of
course, be Parker's band. The
Rumour, which seems to get bet
ter and better with each album.
Brinsley Schwartz is still one of

the classier guitarists around,
sending off his distinct, snarling
riffs. He's tempered and never
sounds like he's out ol control,
but at the same time he can rock
like few others can. He's the per
fect guitarist for Parker's music,
for Parker is similar himself.
