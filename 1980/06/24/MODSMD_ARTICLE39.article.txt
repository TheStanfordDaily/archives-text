Paige wins
EUGENE, Ore. (AP) —
Gritty Don Paige burst into
the lead with just over 200
meters to go and went on to

win the 800 meter race last
night at the U.S. Olympic
Track and Field Trials.
Paige, the classy runner
from Villanova who hears a
physical resemblance to
former standout miler Jim
Rvun, was timed in one mi
nute 44.53 seconds, his per
sonal best, over the Univer
sity of Oregon's rain-slicked
Haywood Field track.
The slippery conditions
obviously did not bother the
clever Paige. He waited pa
tiently before making his big
move and sweeping past early
pacesetter Mark Enyeart. a
1976 Olympian.
James Robinson came up
fast on the final lap and took
second in 1:45:58. Randy
Wilson was third in 1:45.82
with Enyeart fading to fourth
in 1:46.05,
Paige, after gaining the
lead and opening a clear ad
vantage over the field, was
able to look over his shoulder
down the stretch before cros
sing the finish line. It was a
much easier race than even he
had expected.
