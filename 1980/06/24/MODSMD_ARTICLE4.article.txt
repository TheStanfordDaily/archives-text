VENICE — The sixth annual
gathering ot heads ot gov em
inent ot the seven leading indust
rial nations has ended in the cus
tomary mood ot selt
congratulations and cautious op
timism.
But the issues that have been
avoided in Venice or lett unre
solved will probablv soon over
take in importance the rather
predictable results ot the meet
ing.
Issues involving the Middle
East were treated like some
scandal in an otherwise happy
family and simply not discussed.
There were some private ex
changes with President Jimmy
Carter on the subject, but the d it -
terences ot approach and politi
cal outlook between the I nited
States and the rest ot the nations
on Middle East policy, were sim
plv too great to be aired around
the table in the polite world ot
heads ot state.

The second big world problem
that was ducked at the Venice
summit was the shaping of a
eommor policy tor the industrial
world toward the developing
world.
Much lip-ser\ice was paid to
the problem in the communique
and in the statements ol all seven
heads ot state at their joint ap
pearance before newsmen at the
end ot their two-day meeting.
But despite what was said, they
did not come to grips with the
essential question ot what they
are going to do about north
south problems — the relation
ship between the industrialized
nations ot the Northern Hemis
phere and the largely unde
veloped Southern Hemisphere.
Any decisions were shelved
until the leaders meet in Ottawa
next year.
Although thev spent a great
deal ot time hammering out their
|i>int statement on Afghanistan,
the leading Western nations
achieved no clear and coherent

political-economic-diplomatic
strategy or understanding on
East-West relations and dealings
with the Soviet Union.
The Carter administration
puts a tar stronger, hard-line in
terpretation on the Afghanistan
situation than the Europeans do.
and the Europeans are clearly
going to be talking to the So\ icts
a great deal more in the months
ahead than the Americans.
Perhaps one of the strangest
diplomatic odyssevs ol all at this
meeting was the fact that the
seven heads of government sol
emnly produced a statement on
the taking of diplomatic hostages
that does not even mention Iran.
It is not clear who objected to
naming Iran in the declaration,
or why. but the best that could be
agreed upon was a statement to
"condemn vigorously the taking
of hostages and the seizures of
diplomatic and consular pre
mises." without any mention of
any cases or countries where that
had occurred.
The issues that were avoided
here are not going to go away —
and they are likely to overtake
Carter and the other heads of
state all too soon.
