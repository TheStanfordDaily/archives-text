# Physicist Richter seeks simple explanations
## 
### Allan Chen Staff Writer 
Upon walking into Physics
Prof. Burton Richter s office, a
casual visitor might not believe
that it is the office of a man who.
just four years ago. won the
Nobel Prize in physics.
Its space, plainness and grey
government-issue furniture con
ceal the fact that its occupant is
pushing forward the frontiers ol
one of the most esoteric subjects
in physics: elementary particle
physics.
Modern physics, especially
those branches which explore

fundamental questions about the
unvierse, has become far re
moved from everyday experi
ence. Nonetheless, Richter be
lieves that physics still aims to
explain nature in a fundamen
tally simple way.
According to Richter, the two
basic questions of his discipline
are: "What are the fundamental
constituents of matter and what
are the basic forces of nature?"
Richter shared the Nobel
Prize in I 976 with J.J. Ting of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for the discovery ol
the Psi/J particle. This particle's

existence forced a major revision
in physicists' theories of what the
universe is made of.
As to the basic forces of na
ture, there are four, or as Richter
put it, three-and-a-half. They
the electromagnetic force, grav
ity, the strong nuclear force and
the weak nuclear force.
One-force goal
"One of the goals of physics is
to find a model in which there is
only one force, and where these
four are manifestations of that
single force," Richter said.
"I say three-and-a-half be
cause physicists now believe that
the strong nuclear force and the
electromagnetic force have been
unified theoretically. Although
there are still some problems
with this, what remains to be
done is to find experiemental
evidence that supports the
theory's predictions."
After receiving his Ph.l) at
MIT in 1956, Richter came to
Stanford. He is currently a full
professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SI.AC)
where he directs the Stanford
Positron Electron Alternating
Ring (SPEAR) facility.
The SPEAR accelerator gen
erates two oppositely directed
beams of electrons and positrons
which travel in circles. The
beams collide to generate ener
gies that are higher than those of
linear accelerators. The colli
sions produce elementary parti
cles which tell physicists what the
universe is made of.

Richter is also working to per
fect the Positron Electron Pro
ject (PHP) ring. This is essen
tially a larger scale version of the
SPEAR facility.
In describing his motivations
for studying physics, Richter is
concise. "I would say that I am
curious about the way the world
works," he says.
His view of science, however,
is not the traditional one. Richter
does not believe that scientists
are completely objective in ap
proaching a problem.
'"All scientists have a pet
theory which they want to prove.
Scientist A has a theory A, and
scientist B has a theory B.
Cancel out theory
"Science works by the pre
judices of many scientists cancel
ing each other out. It is best to
have a lot of scientists with many
prejudices working in the field so
that they will somehow cancel
each other out. In the process nl
natural selection which follows,
an accurate picture of the uni
verse emerges."
This picture ol the universe
isn't what it used to be. Einstein's
theory of relativity and the
theory of quantum mechanics
caused intellectual revolutions in
scientific thought.
But the problem is that certain
kinds of knowledge about the
physical universe may be unat
tainable.
"It is not obvious what the
fundamental constituents (of

matter) are," Richter said. "It is
possible that the deeper and
deeper you go. the more parti
cles you find — it may never
end.
Simple ideology
Richter justifies his research in
the physics of elementary parti
cles with simple principles.
"Nature is not only com
prehensible, it is basically sim
ple," he says. The physicist has to
manipulate equations and calcu
lations that may be very com
plex. but:
"That complexity is not some
thing that bothers scientists as
long as the theory itself is simple
and elegant."
He gives the example of the
Schrodinger wave equation
which describes the most proba
ble locations of electrons around
an atomic nucleus.
It doesn't matter, Richter be
lieves, that the specific calcula
tions for atoms with more than a
few electrons and protons are so
complex that the equation is im
practical to use. The general
form of the equation is simple
and aesthetically pleasing.
Simplicity and elegance are
therefore important informal
crfteria among physicists if a
theory is to gain acceptance.
Richter had no comment
about why the universe exists
and why there are conscious be
ings in the universe.
"Why the universe is there is
something I rarely speculate ab
out. Mavbe late at nioht after
I've had some wine . . .

unified theoretically. Although
there are still some problems
with this, what remains to be
done is to find experiemental
evidence that supports the
theory's predictions."
After receiving his Ph.l) at
MIT in 1956, Richter came to
Stanford. He is currently a full
professor at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SI.AC)
where he directs the Stanford
Positron Electron Alternating
Ring (SPEAR) facility.
The SPEAR accelerator gen
erates two oppositely directed
beams of electrons and positrons
which travel in circles. The
beams collide to generate ener
gies that are higher than those of
linear accelerators. The colli
sions produce elementary parti
cles which tell physicists what the
universe is made of.

Richter is also working to per
fect the Positron Electron Pro
ject (PHP) ring. This is essen
tially a larger scale version of the
SPEAR facility.
In describing his motivations
for studying physics, Richter is
concise. "I would say that I am
curious about the way the world
works," he says.
His view of science, however,
is not the traditional one. Richter
does not believe that scientists
are completely objective in ap
proaching a problem.
'"All scientists have a pet
theory which they want to prove.
Scientist A has a theory A, and
scientist B has a theory B.
Cancel out theory
"Science works by the pre
judices of many scientists cancel
ing each other out. It is best to
have a lot of scientists with many
prejudices working in the field so
that they will somehow cancel
each other out. In the process nl
natural selection which follows,
an accurate picture of the uni
verse emerges."
This picture ol the universe
isn't what it used to be. Einstein's
theory of relativity and the
theory of quantum mechanics
caused intellectual revolutions in
scientific thought.
But the problem is that certain
kinds of knowledge about the
physical universe may be unat
tainable.
"It is not obvious what the
fundamental constituents (of

matter) are," Richter said. "It is
possible that the deeper and
deeper you go. the more parti
cles you find — it may never
end.
Simple ideology
Richter justifies his research in
the physics of elementary parti
cles with simple principles.
"Nature is not only com
prehensible, it is basically sim
ple," he says. The physicist has to
manipulate equations and calcu
lations that may be very com
plex. but:
"That complexity is not some
thing that bothers scientists as
long as the theory itself is simple
and elegant."
He gives the example of the
Schrodinger wave equation
which describes the most proba
ble locations of electrons around
an atomic nucleus.
It doesn't matter, Richter be
lieves, that the specific calcula
tions for atoms with more than a
few electrons and protons are so
complex that the equation is im
practical to use. The general
form of the equation is simple
and aesthetically pleasing.
Simplicity and elegance are
therefore important informal
crfteria among physicists if a
theory is to gain acceptance.
Richter had no comment
about why the universe exists
and why there are conscious be
ings in the universe.
"Why the universe is there is
something I rarely speculate ab
out. Mavbe late at nioht after
I've had some wine . . .


Burton Richter
Upon walking into Physics
Prof. Burton Richter s office, a
casual visitor might not believe
that it is the office of a man who.
just four years ago. won the
Nobel Prize in physics.
Its space, plainness and grey
government-issue furniture con
ceal the fact that its occupant is
pushing forward the frontiers ol
one of the most esoteric subjects
in physics: elementary particle
physics.
Modern physics, especially
those branches which explore

fundamental questions about the
unvierse, has become far re
moved from everyday experi
ence. Nonetheless, Richter be
lieves that physics still aims to
explain nature in a fundamen
tally simple way.
According to Richter, the two
basic questions of his discipline
are: "What are the fundamental
constituents of matter and what
are the basic forces of nature?"
Richter shared the Nobel
Prize in I 976 with J.J. Ting of the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology for the discovery ol
the Psi/J particle. This particle's

existence forced a major revision
in physicists' theories of what the
universe is made of.
As to the basic forces of na
ture, there are four, or as Richter
put it, three-and-a-half. They
the electromagnetic force, grav
ity, the strong nuclear force and
the weak nuclear force.
One-force goal
"One of the goals of physics is
to find a model in which there is
only one force, and where these
four are manifestations of that
single force," Richter said.
"I say three-and-a-half be
cause physicists now believe that
the strong nuclear force and the
electromagnetic force have been
unified theoretically. Although
there are still some problems
with this, what remains to be
done is to find experiemental
evidence that supports the
theory's predictions."
