# Byrne allows reporter to continue to 'sit-in'

### Arthur Rotstein By The Associated Press 
CHICAGO — A reporter for
the Chicago Tribune ignored an
e\ iction notice yesterday and re
ported for work at City Hall as a
"squatter." but Mayor Jane
Byrne didn't kick him out.
Mrs. Byrne had announced
over the weekend that she in
tended to bar the Tribune from
the City Hall press room because
of what she considered its unfair
treatment of her administration.
Jay McMullen. the mayor's
press secretary and husband,
said yesterday that if the repor
ter. Robert Davis, insisted on
staying. "I'm not going down
there with a shotgun."
He said the press room status
of Da\ is "is apparent!) now that
of a rent-free squatter." The
Tribune, he said, "is staging a
sit-in."
The mayor, in a jovial mood,
even telephoned Davis for a
friendly but off-the-record chat,
the reporter said.
She had been less jo\ ial when
the newspaper published in its
Sunday editions a suppressed
report critical of the previous
administration. The newspaper
also has carried stories critical of
Byrne and alleging that or
ganized crime has ties to City
Hal! and the police department.
The mayor accused the
Tribune of engaging in "innuen
dos. bes. smears, character assas

sinations and male chauvinistic
tactics." and said the newspaper
was no longer welcome at City
Hall.
Yesterday, several dozen re
porters. photographers and
cameramen descended on Davis
as he arrived. Then, with Da\is
among them, they hovered
around McNullen's desk four
floors up. TV lights shining, to
find out what the mayor planned
to do.
McMullen denied that city of
ficials had been told to refuse to
answer the Tribune's questions
or to pro\ ide them access to pub
lic records.
"We're not going to harass
Mr. Davis. No one's trying to
pre\ ent him from doing his job."
he said. "Nobody ordered any
body not to cooperate with City
Hall reporters. I don't know
where that nonsense came from.
We never told the Tribune we
wouldn't answer their ques
tions."
When Davis asked McMullen
what the mayor's schedule was.
he jokingly countered. "How's
the sit-in going?" He then cor
dially answered Davis' question
and later that of another Tribune
reporter.
McMullen said the mayor
might decide to charge the
Tribune rent, then added.
"Maybe we'll have to evict
everybody — or charge rent: 1
don't know."
