30 U.S. commandos and 15
hostages could have been kil
led in the aborted April 24
attempt to rescue 53 Ameri
cans held by Iranian militants,
according to Newsweek
magazine.
This meant that the mission
was approved although plan
ners acknowledged that sa\ -
ing 38 hostages could cost 45

lives, the magazine said.
The magazine did not say
how it had obtained its infor
mation.
The mission sent eight
RH-53D Sea Stallion
helicopters from the aircraft
carrier USS Nimitz in the
Gulf of Oman 600 miles to a
desert point 250 miles south
of Tehran. The choppers
were to rendezvous there
with eight C-130 transport
planes carrying men. fuel and
equipment from a base in

Egypt. The commandos were
to fly by helicopter to moun
tains 50 miles southeast of
Tehran from where they
would launch the rescue at
tempt at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran, the magazine said.
The mission was called off
by military commanders after
three of the eight helicopters
failed. Before men and
equipment could be
e\acuated from the desert a
C-130 collided in the air with
one of the helicopters.
