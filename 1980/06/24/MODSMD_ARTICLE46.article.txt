Brezhnev defends policy
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev yesterday reaffirmed the Krem
lin's longterm military intervention in Af
ghanistan. while the Soviets elsewhere
disclosed that an announced partial troop
withdrawal includes one division ol sol
diers and 1 OS tanks.
"We had no choice hut to send troops.
And events have confirmed that this was
the only correct decision." Brezhnev de
clared in a speech at the closed-door
Communist Party central committee
Plenum made public by the official lass
press agency. "We will further help Af
ghanistan build the new life and preserve
the gains of the April revolution . .
Radio Moscow in a midday broadcast
said. "One Soviet di\ ision and 108 tanks
are leaving Kabul," and quoted the Af
ghan Information Ministry as saying they
are "leaving across the Salang Pass."
Western sources here say this apparently
means one regiment from an armored di
vision and elements of a motorized rifle
division, estimating that perhaps about
10.000 troops are headed back to Soviet
territory.
Neither Brezhnev nor any other Soviet
leader disclosed whether the pull-out
means an actual reduction in the Soviet
military force in Afghanistan. U.S. offi
cials pointed to strong indications in re
cent days that the Soviets have been rein
forcing their units, estimated earlier in the
year to total about 85.000.
Israelis shoot students
JERSULAEM — Israeli troops fired
into a crowd of demonstrating West Bank

students yesterday, wounding five.
The students at Birzeit University were
protesting the death earlier yesterday of a
Bethlehem University student wounded
last Thursday in what Israeli occupation
forces said was an accidental shooting.
Officials at the university said that sol
diers fired from the roofs of nearby build
ings into a crowd of students demonstrat
ing inside a university courtyard. But the
military government said the shots were
fired during a stone-throwing demonstra
tion outside the school.
The most seriously hurt of the five.

Summit threatens OPEC
VENICE, Italy — The world's seven
biggest industrial nations last night moved
aggressively to "break the existing link
between economic growth and consump
tion of oil," pledging to embark on a
major new program to develop the equi
valent of 15 million to 20 million barrels
of oil per day from other sources by 1990.
The plan reflects almost precisely an
American proposal for severing the
Western consuming nations from depen
dence on the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, and as such is a
major political victory of President Car
ter.
At the same time, as they would up
their sixth economic summit session, all of
the leaders served notice on OPEC that
its pricing policies "in some cases (have)
virtually destroyed the prospects for
growth in the developing countries.
In strong language, a final communique

said that the industrialized countries
could not alone carry the responsibility of
aid by "re-cycling" OPEC surpluses, and
that OPEC would have to dig into its own
pockets to share the costs. There was a
similar warning to the "Industrialized
Communist countries."
Carter loses nuclear vote
WASHINGTON — An energy task
force of the Democratic Platform Com
mittee on Sunday handed President Car
ter his first setback in his carefully orches
trated effort to write the party's 19K0
platform when it voted 17 to 11 to re
commend a phaseout of nuclear power
plants.
Carter aides said they thought they
could reverse the vote when the full
150-member committee takes up energy
issues later in the week.
The task force vote represented Sen.
Edward Kennedy's first victory in the
platform committee, where he has been
outvoted on every major issue.
Vietnam attacks Thailand
ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP)
— Vietnamese troops backed by artillery
and tanks struck inside this pro-Western
nation yesterday in an apparent effort to
punish Thailand for allowing guerrillas
opposed to the Vietnamese-backed gov
ernment in Cambodia to operate along
the Thai-Cambodian border.
Thai military sources said 1 30 Thai sol
diers were killed or wounded and an esti
mated 100,000 Cambodian refugees were
sent fleeing from their camps.

The Thai Supreme Military Command
in Bangkok warned it would "act strongly
to protect our national security and
sovereignty" and moved U.S.-made jet
fighter-bombers near the embattled fron
tier between Thailand and Cambodia.
Observers called the fighting the most
serious between Thailand and Vietnam
since Hanoi's forces invaded Cambodia
late in 1978 and toppled the regime of
Premier Pol Pot, but they agreed it did not
signal the start of an invasion of Thailand.
Both China and the United States are on
record as supporting the territorial integ
rity of Thailand.
Dow climbs; prime falls
NEW YORK (AP) — Stock prices
showed some scattered gains today as the
bank prime lending rate continued its
steady descent.
Gainers held a 7-6 lead over losers in
the mid-day tally of New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues.
. The Dow Jones average of 30 indust
rials was up 4.01 at 873.72 by noontime.
The market began moving up after New
York's Morgan Guaranty Trust cut its
prime rate from 12 to 1 P/2 percent, and
the much smaller Southwest Bank of St.
Louis trimmed its rate to 11.

Small craft advisory San Francisco and

Vietnam attacks Thailand
ARANYAPRATHET, Thailand (AP)
— Vietnamese troops backed by artillery
and tanks struck inside this pro-Western
nation yesterday in an apparent effort to
punish Thailand for allowing guerrillas
opposed to the Vietnamese-backed gov
ernment in Cambodia to operate along
the Thai-Cambodian border.
Thai military sources said 1 30 Thai sol
diers were killed or wounded and an esti
mated 100,000 Cambodian refugees were
sent fleeing from their camps.

The Thai Supreme Military Command
in Bangkok warned it would "act strongly
to protect our national security and
sovereignty" and moved U.S.-made jet
fighter-bombers near the embattled fron
tier between Thailand and Cambodia.
Observers called the fighting the most
serious between Thailand and Vietnam
since Hanoi's forces invaded Cambodia
late in 1978 and toppled the regime of
Premier Pol Pot, but they agreed it did not
signal the start of an invasion of Thailand.
Both China and the United States are on
record as supporting the territorial integ
rity of Thailand.

Brezhnev defends policy
MOSCOW — Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev yesterday reaffirmed the Krem
lin's longterm military intervention in Af
ghanistan. while the Soviets elsewhere
disclosed that an announced partial troop
withdrawal includes one division ol sol
diers and 1 OS tanks.
"We had no choice hut to send troops.
And events have confirmed that this was
the only correct decision." Brezhnev de
clared in a speech at the closed-door
Communist Party central committee
Plenum made public by the official lass
press agency. "We will further help Af
ghanistan build the new life and preserve
the gains of the April revolution . .
Radio Moscow in a midday broadcast
said. "One Soviet di\ ision and 108 tanks
are leaving Kabul," and quoted the Af
ghan Information Ministry as saying they
are "leaving across the Salang Pass."
Western sources here say this apparently
means one regiment from an armored di
vision and elements of a motorized rifle
division, estimating that perhaps about
10.000 troops are headed back to Soviet
territory.
Neither Brezhnev nor any other Soviet
leader disclosed whether the pull-out
means an actual reduction in the Soviet
military force in Afghanistan. U.S. offi
cials pointed to strong indications in re
cent days that the Soviets have been rein
forcing their units, estimated earlier in the
year to total about 85.000.

Summit threatens OPEC
VENICE, Italy — The world's seven

aggressively to "break the existing link
between economic growth and consump

major new program to develop the equi

of oil per day from other sources by 1990.
The plan reflects almost precisely an
American proposal for severing the
Western consuming nations from depen

major political victory of President Car
