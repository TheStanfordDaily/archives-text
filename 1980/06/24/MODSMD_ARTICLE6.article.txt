From the Daily wire services
NEW DELHI. India — The
death of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi's son. Sanjay. in a pri
vate plane crash here Monday
leaves a gaping hole in India's
political framework and is bound
to alter the future ot Indian poli
tics.
The 33-vear-old younger son
ol the prime minister was with
out question the most powerful
person in the country behind his
mother.
As the son and closest political
confidant of the prime minister.
Gandhi's death will also change
the shape of her prime minister
ship. There was some concern in
the capital yesterday about Mrs.
Gandhi's ability to overcome the
tragedy , but she moved stoically
through the day.
Gandhi was viewed by his
rapidly expanding political fol
lowing as a man impatient to cor
rect his country's ills, and some
one who refused t > tolerate inef
ficiency. However, his enemies,
and he had many, viewed him as
an insensitive, politically imma
ture ruffian who had already
shown his willingness to run
roughshod over India's democ
ratic process.
Opposition leaders charged
that Mrs. Gandhi was grooming
him as n successor which Mrs.

Gandhi denied. But the
nickname, the "crown prince."
remained in use by his numerous
critics.
Sanjay's influence in national
politics surfaced during the
1975-77 state of emergency
proclaimed b\ Mrs. Gandhi, giv
ing her and other officials ex
traordinary powers. Although he
did not hold an off icial post at the
time, he wielded enormous
power.
He inspired a controversial
birth control program which led
to many allegedly coerced
sterilizations and. ultimately, a
voter backlash against his
mother's regime. She was ousted
in the 1977 general elections,
after 1 1 years in office.
However. 33 months of gov
ernment under Prime Minister
Morarji Desai and Charan Singh
— regarded by some as unpro
ductive and bickering — helped
erode memories of emergency
abuses and Mrs. Gandhi re
turned to power in a landslide
election victory last January.
Sanjay won his 112 irst seat in Par
liament then and emerged after
that as a vocal member. Even his
own supporters admitted he
wielded power disproportionate
to his position as one of 52>S
members of the lower house.
