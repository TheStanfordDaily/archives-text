MOSCOW â€” The Kremlin's
announcement of a withdrawal
of some army units from Af
ghanistan was a "gesture" re
quiring a Western response in
order to move toward a political
settlement of the crisis. Soviet
sources said here Sunday.
The sources also suggested
that the withdrawal is already
under way. and stressed that if it
leads to any aggra\ ation of fight
ing between Afghan rebels and
the Soviet-backed regime of Af
ghan President Babrak Karmal.
"It would, of course, mean the
army going back."
The comments appeared to
confirm skepticism among
Western and Islamic sources
here that the surprise withdrawal
announcement represented any
meaningful change in the Soviet
position. Rather, those diploma
tic sources said, the move ap
pears to represent a Soviet effort
to put diplomatic pressure on the
non-Communist world while not
seriously compromising Mos
cow's commitment to prop up
the unpopular Karmal regime.

The United States and other
nations have demanded a com
plete Soviet troop withdrawal
from Afghanistan as a precondi
tion for a political settlement of
the crisis. It seemed clear from
the announcement that no such
full withdrawal is currently con
templated by the Soviet side.
The Tass announcement came
at a time when Western and
non-aligned nations are in disar
ray over how to react to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
In the United Nations. 1 04 coun
tries have condemned the inter
vention. but there has been little
agreement on the appropriate
steps needed to counter the
Soviet move.
The Soviet leadership has
played on these divisions to pur
sue its goals of isolating the Un
ited States from its western
European allies, and minimizing
its political losses in the Islamic
world. The Kremlin insists that
its actions in Afghanistan should
have no impact on the policy of
East-West detente, or a relaxa
tion of tensions. It accuses the
United States, and China, in par
ticular. of supporting Afghan re

bels and whipping up
"anti-Soviet hysteria" to
camouflage their own attempts
to dominate the Middle Hast and
Asia.
The Islamic countries are so
divided by other issues that the>
have been unable to mount a un
ified reaction to the Soviet move
into Afghanistan. And western
Europe, which has developed ex
tensive economic ties with Mos
cow over the last decade, has
been reluctant to follow the U.S.
lead in imposing strong sanctions
in the wake of the invasion.
The timing ot the Tass an
nouncement appeared designed
to play further on those divi
sions.
It occurred the same morning
that Western leaders, including
President Jimmy Carter, assem
bled in Venice to open important
economic and political talks, it
also coincided with an Islamic
meeting in Switzerland devoted
to the Afghanistan crisis. And it
preceeds by only a week the ex
pected arrival here of West
German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt for summit talks with
Brezhnev.
