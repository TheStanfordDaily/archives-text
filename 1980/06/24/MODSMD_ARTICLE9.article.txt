## No wiretaps found at Republican office 
### Robert Jackson The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — District of Columbia
police on Sunday punctured Washington's
newest political spy story — the one about
Republican National Committee offices
being bugged.
In fact, police left Republican officials fac
ing the music — literally.
A six-hour electronic sweep of the office of
RNC co-chairman Mary Crisp failed to un
cover any evidence of illegal eavesdropping
or wiretapping, police said.
Moreover, officers said a double strand of
wires found in the ceiling of Crisp's office,
which some RNC officials believed were
highly suspicious, turned out to be carrying
nothing more than music.
" One of our men connected a headphone
to these two loose wires and heard music
coming over them." police spokesman
Joseph Gentile told reporters.
Gentile said that the wires were apparently
part of a sound system carrying recorded
music into rooms of the Capitol Hill office
building where RNC headquarters are lo
cated.
The wires had been found above a drop
ceiling during an examination of Crisp's of

fice by a private security company last Wed
nesday and Thursday. Crisp had called in the
experts, she said, after hearing strange beep
ing noises on both her office and home tele
phones. Tests at her apartment found no e\ i
dence of any bugs.
Crisp said Sunday night there were "still a
lot of unanswered questions." But other
RNC officials seemed to accept the police
findings.
Donald hers, the committee's general
counsel, said that police wanted to conduct
additional interviews. including talks with
pri\ ate electronic experts who first examined
Crisp's office.
"1 think the press has blown the whole
thing out of proportion." hers said.
A spokesman for the FBI said. "We're not
in it at all. Nothing has been brought to our
attention that would indicate any federal
laws have been broken."
Spokesman Jeff Maynard said indications
of eavesdropping have been speculative.
"If the police were to find any hard evi
dence. we might very well become in\ ol\ ed."
Maynard said.
Gentile said that police could not rule out
the possibilit\ that a listening device might
once have been in place. The investigation

will continue tor several more days, he said.
But police technicians were certain that
the two loose wires, with a jack at one end.
could not ha\ e been used tor ea\ esdropping.
Gentile said.
"We did not tind any devices within the
office." he told reporters. "There are de-
ices, ot course, which you can plant outside
the office." Police equipment could not de
tect those, he said.
RNC officials said Richard Go\ ignon. a
former army electronics expert, last week
had found what he believed was an elec
tromagnetic field near Crisp's desk, indicat
ing that electronic monitoring may be occur
ring from outside the building.
However, other experts who were sub
sequently hired by the committee concluded
that if a magnetic field previously existed in
the room, it was no longer there. Police were
unable to reach a conclusion on that ques
tion. Gentile said.
In an interview. Crisp said she "would like
to see a solution to the discrepancies as to
what the professional electronic experts told
me and what the police reported. I was led to
believe that those loose wires were not the
ordinary type ot wiring I'm not an expert ol
course."
