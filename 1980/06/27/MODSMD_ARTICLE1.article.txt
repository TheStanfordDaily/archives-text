Ending a long debate. Con
gress approved on Wednesday
President Jimmy Carter's re
quest for $13.3 million for regist
ration of 19- and 20-year old
men for the draft.
Registration will begin on July
21 and continue for two weeks
according to Carter's plan.
Those born in 1960 and 1961
will be required to report to their
local post offices for sign up. The
maximum penalty for not com
plying is five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
The University has no official
position at this time, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
said, because there is "no need
for a policy yet." However, he
added, "we would not feel com
fortable as agents of the Selec
tive Service. It's our assumption
that all transactions are between
the Service and the students."
When asked about providing

addresses and ages for govern
ment use, Lyons said, "We gen
erally don't make available in
formation that the student
doesn't want made available."
Commenting on University
actions in the past, former stu
dent body president David Har
ris said that University coopera
tion with the Selective Service in
the spring of 1966 provoked a
three day sit-in at the President's
office. The issue was the use of
Stanford buildings for adminis
tering government tests of
academic performance. Those
tests were used to determine the
distribution of educational de
ferments, Harris said.
Harris warned that the process
of registration and draft has been
streamlined since the Vietnam
war, making resistance more dif
ficult. There will be no card car
rying this time, and, in general,
being registered will be "a rela
tively inconspicuous part of
people's lives."
Those parts of the process that
helped draft resisters in the past

have now been eliminated, Har
ris said. Ten years ago a person
notified for induction had two
months to appeal for exemption.
This has been reduced to ten
days notice before being sent to
boot camp, according to Harris.
Harris suggested that students
here should "draw the administ
ration out" on its draft policy
through a series of conferences
with University officials. Ques
tions such as the funding of a
campus draft counselor should
be asked directly.
There has already been some
reaction in the Bay area to the
passing of the appropriations
bill. San Francisco is one of five
cities in which the National Re
sistance Committee (NRC) has
called for a registration boycott.
NRCspokesperson Monte Krell,
19, has pledged to refuse to re
gister saying that "if a few people
are willing to stand up to the law
publicly, tens of thousands will
follow privately." The NRC says
that only 2 percent non
compliance would create 80,000
new criminals, which is three
times the capacity of the federal
prisons.
According to Doris Jones of
People Against the Draft, her
organization will be providing in
formation at the post offices on
the peninsula regarding the op
tions registrants will have. "We
want people to see the whole
thing as one process that is build
ing very fast, " instead of regist
ration as separate from draft and
war, Jones said.
At the Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC) meeting last
night, members approved a plan
to march to the site of a cam
paign dinner to be given for Car
ter at the Portola Valley home of
