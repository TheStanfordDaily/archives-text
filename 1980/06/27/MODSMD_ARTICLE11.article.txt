The Los Angeles Times
Washington â€” Selcctivc Ser
vice Director Bernard Rostker
said yesterday that President
Carter will issue a proclamation,
possibly next Tuesday, reviving
military registration for the first
time since 1 975.
Carter's plan, which won final
congressional approval Wed
nesday, will require men horn in
1960 and 1961 to register for the
draft at local post offices, begin
ning July 21.
Next January, men born in
1962 will be required to register,
and the program will continue
enrolling 18-year-olds each year
thereafter.
The American Civil Liberties
Union, meanwhile, filed suit to
block the president's plan on
grounds of unconstitutional sex
discrimination because it re
quires men but not women to re
gister. The ACLU acknow
ledged, however, that its aim ac
tually was to kill the registration
plan.
Suit Filed
The suit, filed in federal dis
trict court here, contended that
registration puts the burden on
men only and violates the Con
stitution's Fifth Amendment
guarantee of due process under
the law.
"We have obviously not con
sidered draft registration a be
nefit and we have no desire to
extend it to women," ACLU
Executive Director Ira Glasser
said. "But we believe that if this
(suit) is successful, it will effec
tively kill the whole plan."
Selective Service officials have
prepared and are about to distri
bute information on registration
to radio and television stations

and daily and weekly newspap
ers throughout the country.
