# Reagan's tax-cut fails to pass U.S. Senate
## 
### Art Pine The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — The Senate's Democ
rats nervously voted down Ronald Reagan's
tax cut proposal yesterday, but only after
hurriedly abandoning their balanced-budget
plans and promising theirown tax cut legisla
tion within 10 weeks.
In a reversal that caught both the House
and the Carter Administration by surprise, a
hastily called caucus of Senate Democrats
formally asked the Finance Committee to
draft legislation by Sept. 3 for a major tax cut
in 1981 that would compete with the Reagan
plan.
A few hours later, the full Senate defeated
the first of several expected GOP efforts to
tack Reagan's plan onto other pending bills.
The party-line 58-to-38 vote kept the tax cut
off a bill lifting the federal debt ceiling.

The embarrassed Democrats here, put on
the defensive by Reagan's surprise proposal
Wednesday for a 10 percent across-the
board tax cut for 1981, combined with faster
depreciation writeoffs for business invest
ment.
Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D-W. Va.),
led the Democrats in their response, brand
ing the Reagan approach a "Simple Simon,
Tinkertoy" economic plan that would
amount to writing tax policy on the Senate
floor without hearings. He predicted the
Democratic alternative would eventually
pass.
Reagan, obviously relishing the effect his
proposal has had. issued a statement saying,
"Yesterday I urged the Congress to enact an
immediate tax cut ... to come to grips with
the country's desperate economic decline.
Today, the Democrats in the Senate

answered. Their pitiful response: 'We need a
study, a task force.' "What are they waiting
for?" he chided. "And where have they been
all these months? What do these Democratic
leaders in the Senate expect to learn . . . that
millions of American families don't already
know?"
The action by the Senate Democrats shat
tered previous plans by congressional leaders
to put off consideration of a tax bill during
this election year. Until a few days ago, the
Democrats had seemed intent on balancing
the budget instead.
Reagan's thrust on Wednesday changed
all that, at least for the Senate. Its Finance
Committee is now committed to drafting a
major tax cut bill that includes both rate cuts
for individuals and investment incentives for
business.
