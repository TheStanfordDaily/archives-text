# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Crouse and O'Leary CIR policy insensitive 
### 
Now that the Commission on
Investment Responsibility
I CI R) has apparently completed
its work for the year, we feel that
it is an appropriate time to re
\ lew the ClR's decisions tin
South Africa related proxies. On
the whole the ClR's record is a
disappointing one.
The fundamental problem
with the ClR's position is the
ClR's contention that I S. in
vestment can help eliminate
apartheid in South Africa. In the
ClR's words: "... on balance
the presence of certain private
companies in South Africa may
be beneficial to the needs and
aspirations of both the black and
white population of South Africa
and may tend to accelerate
needed reforms."
The CI R's \ lew reflects a mis
perception of the South African
situation in its belief that affir
mative action programs prom
ised under the Sulli\an code of
conduct (i.e. desegregated
facilities, equal pay. training
programs and promotion of
blacks in management) can pro
duce substantial social change
and thus justify corporations'
continuing presence in South Af
rica.
The affirmative action reforms
that the Sullivan principles aim
to promote do not affect the
foundations of apartheid. These
principles deal essentially only
with aspects of "petty" apartheid
(segregated facilities, etc.) while
leaving intact the structure of
grand apartheid — the numer
ous acts such as the homelands
policy, migrant labor laws, pass
laws, and group areas act — that
are designed to deny blacks all
rights in South Africa.
There is a realization among
blacks in South Africa that U.S.
corporate investment has not led
to greater economic and political

gains for blacks but rather has
strengthened and entrenched the
South African government. By
contributing much needed capi
tal and technology in key areas of
the South African economy —
computers, oil. mining and
synthetic fuels, corporations
have enabled South Africa to be
more self-sufficient militarily
and economically and thus more
able to resist pressure to share
power and resources with blacks.
We are most distressed that
the CIR and the trustees persist
in belie\ ing, in the face of all the
contrary evidence, that U.S. cor
porations can help to dismantle
apartheid and lead to a signific
antly better life for blacks in
South Africa. In addition, given
the large amounts of stock that
Stanford owns in many com
panies operating in South Africa
and for which no proxies were
presented, we do not feel that the
consideration given to a few pro
xies on a few specific points can
reasonably be called investment
responsibility.
We agree with the conclusions
made by Frank Vogl, U.S.
economics correspondent for the
Times of London after a recent
visit to South Africa:
"To invest in South Africa is to
boost the confidence of the
whites, and nothing less than to
support ideals that run com
pletely counter to the democracy
of which Americans are so
proud. To suggest that by invest
ing in South Africa one is helping
to bring about change and the
improvement of the condition of
blacks is to seek an excuse for
supporting racialists because it is
financially profitable."

O'Leary are members of the
Memorial Church Task force on
South Africa.)
