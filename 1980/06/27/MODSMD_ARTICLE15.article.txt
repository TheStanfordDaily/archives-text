## Mutual destruction unacceptable 
### 
One cool spring evening ear
lier this month, an Air Force
watch officer sitting deep be
neath Cheyenne Mountain in the
North American Defense Com
mand post outside Colorado
Springs, Colo, heard a beeping
noise from his computer termi
nal. He watched as a message
appeared on the computer sc
reen before him warning that the
Russians had launched nuclear
missiles from their land bases
and submarines. These missiles
were due to land all over the Un
ited States in about nine minutes.
As it turned out, of course, the
warning was not real. It was a
computer malfunction. Our
wonderful multi bill ion -dollar
worldwide military command
and control system has warned of
at least fifty such attacks just this
last year, flow many times can
we afford to put our nuclear
forces on alert because of such a
warning?
The world has come uncom
fortably close to nuclear destruc
tion \cry recently, and therefore
it is a good time to look at our
present nuclear defense policy.
The acronym for our defense
policy is M A I) It is a policy of

"mutual assured destruction." If
the Soviets launch their nuclear
weapons against us, we will un
leash ours against them â€”
probably destroying the earth in
the process. Because neither of
us, by the limits of SALT I, are
allowed an effective anti-missile
defense, we are both assured of
being destroyed. Is not this pol
icy unethical? Let us pursue the
issue on a more philosophical
level.
If our defense policy is one
that advocates killing innocent
civilians uninvolved with the bel
ligerent forces, then surely it is
unethical. One can argue,
though, that we would not be kil
ling innocent civilians, for they
should be considered part of the
belligerent force.
But if the U.S.S.R. were to
launch a surprise nuclear attack
on us, only a handful of Russians
would even know about it.
Furthermore, the few that insti
gated the attack would be pro
tected in underground silos and
command posts. We would re
taliate by killing people totally
uninvolved with the "war."
To have a nuclear defense pol
icy that is ethically sound, we

cannot threaten to kill innocent
civilians. The threat itself is im
moral and against human rights.
The only ethically acceptable op
tion in targeting our defensive
nuclear weapons is to aim them
at threatening enemy nuclear
forces. This means enemy nuc
lear submarines, hardened silos,
bombers and underground
command/control centers. This
is a policy of "counterforce."
There is a major problem with
it, however. If our weapons arc
only to be used defensively (as a
second strike force) then what
good would it do us if they were
strictly counterforce? For exam
ple, if the Russians were to
launch their missiles against our
cities, what good would it do us
to strike back against theirempty
silos and submarines? Any effec
tive counterforce-as-defense
policy would necessitate a pre
emptive first strike use.
Because 1 have no intention of
trying to justify a first-strike with
nuclear weapons under any cir
cumstances (how could a first
strike even be considered a de
fense since we could not be abso
lutely certain that we were about
to be attacked) and because a
second-strike counterforce de
fense would be highly ineffec
tive, we must look elsewhere for
an effective and ethically sound
defense.
In my next column, I will
explore what appears to be our
only ethically acceptable nuclear
defense.
