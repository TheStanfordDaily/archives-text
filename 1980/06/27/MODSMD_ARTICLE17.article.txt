Education is a touchy topic at
Stanford; who can, after all, re
ally be called an educated per
son? There are no easy answers
in the search for culture, espe
cially in light of the closeness
learning has to our hearts — or
should 1 say, to our pocketbooks.
After subjecting ourselves to
this $10,000 a year waterfall of
verbiage and information most
of us are understandably reticent
to admit that we are lacking in
some intellectual essentials.
Now, I have not mentioned all
of this in order to insult Stanford
students. Nor do 1 want to out

line a comprehensive definition
of what an educated person
should know; there are enough
books on that topic to fill a small
library. What I would like to do is
point out one area of a person's
education that gets fairly small
billing at Stanford, a world view.
1 anticipate some of you will
want to stop reading at this point.
For pre-(you fill in the blank)
students, questioning one's val
ues can be an obstacle to grad
school and to the life-style that
an advanced degree affords. For
others, it's just too difficult and
emotionally taxing. And finally,
for some it has been the central
goal of their time at Stanford.
These people will probably do
well to put this paper away and
do some significant reading in an
operations research textbook.
Many centuries ago, when
Christian churches populated
Europe with novel educational
institutions called "universities,"
education was seen as a process
in which a student became aware
of how different fields of know
ledge contributed to an overall
world view.
Questions like "Who is
man?," "What is the ultimate re
ality (God, gods, matter, etc.)?,"
"What is the basis of morality?,"
and "What is the meaning (if
any) of human history?" were
some of the foci of this search for
a value structure. Under these
circumstances, the word "uni
versity," implying a unity, had
some meaning.
Today, however, the univer
sity has become a fractured place

where knowledge is pursued in
different fields with little or no
reference to the larger questions
of world views and value struc
tures; it has become a "multiver
sity." And this, as I have pointed
out, leaves Stanford students
with no coherent way of looking
at the world.
Yet in a real sense there is no
way of escaping the question of
values. We all live our lives ax if
we had answers to the important
world view questions. When we
abhor the killing of humans, we
make a statement that people are
very valuable. But why do we
think that people are valuable?
At this point we've arrived at a
world view and value structure
question, really just a variation
on the "Who is man?" query.
Humanists claim people are val
uable because they are the most
complex and only self-conscious
animals on earth. Nihilists like
Samuel Beckett believe that talk
ing about human value is absurd
since the world is meaningless.
Christians believe that humans
are valuable because they are
created by God in the divine im
age. And many Stanford stu
dents have little to say on the
subject at all.
But they should. Doesn't edu
cation become a farce when such
an important question is left un
pursued? I think so, and I hope
more Stanford students will seek
to shape their own coherent
value structures — the future
will depend on their answers.
