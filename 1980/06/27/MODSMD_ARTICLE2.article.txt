# University nurses threaten to strike
## 
### Carl Johnson Staff Writer 
Over 1000 registered nurses at
Stanford University Hospital
will go on strike next week unless
a new collective bargaining ag
reement is reached by midnight,
July 4, a nurse's labor organiza
tion has announced.
The Committee for the Rec
ognition of Nursing Achiev
ments (CRONA) which repre
sents the non-supervisory staff
registered nurses at the hospital
announced its intention to strike
three days ago. CRONA has
been negotiating with the hospi
tal administration since May 20
for a new agreement to succeed
the current one which will expire
June 30.
A federal mediator is expected
to join the negotiations soon, ac
cording to Prisci 11 a Wheeler,
chief negotiator for the hospital.
However, both sides have a long
way to go before an agreement
can be reached.

"There is a wide gap between
us as to what the nurses consider
appropriate for salaries and
compensation," said Wheeler.
Uncertainties
Neither side has said what
exactly the nurses are asking for,
nor what the hospital is willing to
offer.
Wheeler refused to speculate
as to whether an agreement
could be reached before the July
4 deadline.
Hospital administrators, how
ever, have already begun to
make contingency plans for a
strike. These plans may include
closing selected parts of the hos
pital, admitting patients only for
emergency or nonelective treat
ment and transferring patients
to other hospitals according to a
schedule which depends on the
progress of the negotiations, ac
cording to Hospital Adminis
trator Gary Mecklenburg.
Patients requiring critical care
and patients in areas trom which
they cannot be moved to other
hospitals will not be left without
care even in the event of a strike,
however, according to Joanna
Nelson, R.N., chief negotiator
for CRONA. Nelson pledged

that, "We will make sure patient
care is not compromised."
Negotiations so far have cen
tered on nurse's salaries, grie
vance procedures and non
monetary compensations.
Negotiators were unwilling to
mention any more specific items
under consideration.
"We are trying to come up
with a solution that is satisfactory
to both sides," said hospital
negotiator Wheeler, "... we
recognize our responsibilities to
both the patients and everyone
involved. A strike would be very
debilitating."
History
In 1974 CRONA nurses
walked off the job for 11 days.
During the period 30 nurses —
half of them CRONA nurses
working under the terms of a
previous agreement with the
hospital administration —
staffed the renal, coronary and
intensive care units of the hospi
tal as well as the emergency and
premature infants facilities. In

addition, the number of patients
at the hospital was reduced from
the average of 500 to only 72 by
the time the dispute was settled.
In 1978 last-minute negotia
tions prevented a walk out
scheduled for June 30 after a
strike notice had been tiled 10
days earlier.
Under the National Labor Re
lations Act, CRONA is required
to give 10-day notice of its inten
tion to strike. CRONA filed its
notice with the hospital ad
ministration on Tuesday. The fil
ing of the strike notice entitled
the negotiators to help from a
federal mediator in resolving the
five-and-a-half week old dis
pute.
The Federal Mediation and
Concilation Services, which pro
vide mediators to help resolve
labor disputes contacted
negotiator Wheeler's office on
Wednesday. Negotiators have
been meeting on a daily basis
since May 20 and will continue
until an agreement is reached.
