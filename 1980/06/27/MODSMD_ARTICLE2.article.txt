# University nurses threaten to strike
## 
### Carl Johnson Staff Writer 
Over 1000 registered nurses at
Stanford University Hospital
will go on strike next week unless
a new collective bargaining ag
reement is reached by midnight,
July 4, a nurse's labor organiza
tion has announced.
The Committee for the Rec
ognition of Nursing Achiev
ments (CRONA) which repre
sents the non-supervisory staff
registered nurses at the hospital
announced its intention to strike
three days ago. CRONA has
been negotiating with the hospi
tal administration since May 20
for a new agreement to succeed
the current one which will expire
June 30.
A federal mediator is expected
to join the negotiations soon, ac
cording to Prisci 11 a Wheeler,
chief negotiator for the hospital.
However, both sides have a long
way to go before an agreement
can be reached.

"There is a wide gap between
us as to what the nurses consider
appropriate for salaries and
compensation," said Wheeler.
Uncertainties
Neither side has said what
exactly the nurses are asking for,
nor what the hospital is willing to
offer.
Wheeler refused to speculate
as to whether an agreement
could be reached before the July
4 deadline.
Hospital administrators, how
ever, have already begun to
make contingency plans for a
strike. These plans may include
closing selected parts of the hos
pital, admitting patients only for
emergency or nonelective treat
ment and transferring patients
to other hospitals according to a
schedule which depends on the
progress of the negotiations, ac
cording to Hospital Adminis
trator Gary Mecklenburg.
