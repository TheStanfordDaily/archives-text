If you can overlook the
enormous amount of money that
was spent on a pretty ridiculous
set of explosions and car crashes,
and you happen to enjoy John
Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, you
can really have a great time at the
recently released Blues Brothers
Movie.
1 was bitterly disappointed
with last year's 1941, in which
both Aykroyd and Belushi star
red. and I'm still angry with them
both for leaving TV's Saturday
Night Live so, frankly. I wasn't
expecting much from their new
movie. But to my surprise. I
found it very entertaining, and,
believe it or not. well worth the
price of admission.
Maybe it was just the mood I
was in. I'm not sure, but Ayk
royd and Belushi do a fine job of
making some real characters out
of a couple of guys I was begin
ning to wonder about.
What we find out is that Jake
(Belushi) is the classic hard
nosed little tough guy. He loves
his brother, his music and raising
a little hell, and that's probably
about it. Elwood is a litle more
quiet than his brother, but he
makes up for it in mischief, like
when he pulls a can of marine
epoxy out of his ever-present
briefcase and applies it to the
"bad guys" gas pedal.
The story revolves around
what Elwood continually refers

to as "a mission from God" —
the brothers must somehow find
$5000 in 11 days to rescue the
Chicago orphanage they lived in
as children. In order to earn the
money, Jake and Elwood per
suade their old Blues Brothers
Band, which consists of a for
midable list of real life studio
musicians, to get back together.
Fortunately, director John
Landis (who directed Animal
House and co-wrote this movie's
script with Akroyd) knew better
than to let the band try to act
much. Even in the few spots
where they must — they don't.
James Brown, Cab Calloway,
Ray Charles and Aretha
Franklin, who all make mostly
musical appearances, don't em
barrass themselves too badly
when they give acting a try, how
ever.
The movie actually starts out
pretty slowly, showing the re
acquaintance of the brothers
after Jake gets out of prison.
Things don't really get going
until the Blues go to church.
They end up at the "Triple Rock
Baptist Church" where James
Brown plays a triply soulful
preacher who leads his congrega
tion in a real rocker of a service.
The fun starts when Jake and
Elwood, the only white people in
the church, get into the act, danc
ing their patented high-speed jit
ter steps around and in front of

the altar.
The same kind of thing hap
pens when the band goes out to
buy some equipment at Ray
Charles' music store. When
Charles sits down to de
monstrate a keyboard, and the
rest of the band plus Jake and
Elwood join in on "Shake Your
Tailfeather," the whole
neighborhood goes nuts. It's re
ally one of the funniest scenes
I've seen in some time.
The movie climaxes with what


Elwood and Jake — The Blues Brothers
