## The Blues have good news
### 
Once upon a time, John Be-*
lushi and Dan Aykroyd, two
popular young television come
dians, decided they would like to
be musicians, too. So they ap
peared on TV a few times, and
people thought they were
"cute." Then they said they
wanted to make an album and
the record company said, "OK,
people think you're cute, we'll
let you give it a try." Well, they
did, and they got some very ex
cellent studio musicians to be on
it with them, playing covers of
old rhythm and blues material.
The rest, of course, is recent
history. The Blues Brothers' first

album. Briefcase Full of Blues,
sold like crazy. Double-platinum
crazy, in fact. So they decided to
make a movie, which was re
leased last week. And their sec
ond album is the soundtrack to
go with it.
My guess is that the excite
ment over the Blues Brothers
has died down since their last
album was released and that
their newest effort will fall short
in the sales department. Unfor
tunately, and to my surprise, the
Blues Brothers Movie Sound
track is a much better record
than Briefcase Full of Blues.
The records' 12 songs, four of

which are performed by artists
other than Jake and Elwood(Be
lushi and Aykroyd) are nicely ar
ranged, well produced, and best
of all, give an excellent feel for
what the movie's like. As I sat in
my chair and listened for the first
time to the record's version of
"Peter Gunn Theme," I could
recall very precisely the scene in
which the song was played â€” as
Jake and Elwood walked down a
Chicago backstreet towards their
meager home.
Songs like "Sweet Home
Chicago," Ray Charles' version
of "Shake Your Tailfeather,"
