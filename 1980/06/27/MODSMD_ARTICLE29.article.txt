## Urban Cowboy—trying to live a myth 
### 
I Gcxxi may be too strong a
word to apply to Urban Cowboy;
the film's form is too slight, its
ideas too tentative to hold up
under the weight of superlative s
With that in mind, let's begin
simply by noting that the film is
much better than anyone had
any right to expect. If Urban
Cowboy does not meet the
criteria for being the legendary
"good movie," then it manages
to give a pretty fair imitation of
one.
As nearly everyone must
know by now, the movie features
John Travolta drinking beer and
wearing a Stetson. It also stars
Debra Winger as Travolta's
girlfriend/wife; Scott Glenn as
his sadistic arch rival; and, in a
particularly sympathetic por
trayal of a woman who has made
a career out of making the best of
things, Brooke Alderson as his
aunt.
A character as important as
any of the others is a Houston
bar named Gilley's. More screen
time is devoted to loving pans
across its smoky expanse than is
devoted to any of the film's
players. Characters walk from
the blue-white heat of a Texas
afternoon into the bar's comfort
ing gloom. This escape into a
simpler world makes up Urban
Cowboy's emotional core; any
deeper resonance the film pos
sesses finds its origins here.
On one level or another, Gil
ley's contains the stuff dreams

are made of. For Winger's
character, Sissy, the bar is the
final preserve of a nobler race of
men — she goes up to Travolta's
character. Bud, and asks without
cynicism, "Are you a real cow
boy?" The answer, of course, is
that in Gilley's all men (or at
least all Texans) are cowboys.
Gilley's is home of the
mechanical bull, the ultimate test
of manhood for a generation
reared on the freeway. Bud, a

city cowboy, must prove himself
on a city hull. He sees no irony in
the sport; it's the nearest he can
get to the real thing.
Urban Cowboy's director,
James Bridges, is best known as
the director of The China Syn
drome. The distance between the
two films is not as great as it at
first seems. Both deal with
characters trying to make some
impact on a mechanized, imper
sonal society. The characters in

Urban Cowboy strive to main
tain a vision of the world that
cannot correspond to their ex
periences. The film's greatest
conflict is between how the
characters think of themselves
and how they really are.
Bridges deliberately
downplays some of the story's
flashier aspects; despite a strong
potential for melodrama, the
film's tone comes out dry and
distanced. This effect works as
both a problem and an advan
tage. The dead spots in the film
come out really dead — there is
no melodramatic momentum to
sustain them.
But the dryness of tone also
lends the film a certain dignity it
might not otherwise have had
(and with a star as notorious as

Travolta, I'm certain Bridges
struggled to attain any dignity he
possibly could). There is an un
deniable sadness about the film's
characters. Their dreams of get
ting something nice, something
real, are our dreams, too.
Urban Cowboy will probably not
be as popular as it would have
been had Bridges opted for a
safe, flashy style. By deem
phasizing the importance of who
wins the mechanical bull compet
ition, for example, he may have
lost thousands of paid admis
sions. But, to a large degree, his
gamble improved the film. For
all the film's faults, in Urban
Cowboy Bridges achieved the
near-unbelievable: he made a
"John Travolta film" worth tak
ing seriously.
