### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
The Immigration and
Naturalization Servicc (INS)
may now grant Iranian students
extensions of stay until they have
completed their current prog
rams of study. Over 70 students
here will thus be allowed to finish
their studies before returning to
Iran.
In a quiet policy shift. Presi
dent Jimmy Carter rescinded his
order to deport Iranian students
when their 1-94 forms, the offi
cial documents which authorize
their periods of stay, expire.
President Carter announced
that the INS could not issue or
reissue visas to Iranian nationals
as one of his four sanctions
against the Iranian government
in April.
The International Communi
cations Agency now attributes

Carter's reversal decision to the
efforts of the National Associa
tion for Foreign Student Affairs
(NAFSA) and other organiza
tions to prevent Iranian students
from being deported.
Eighty-six of the 93 Iranians
studying here would have been
affected by Carters original or
der. In May, three Iranian stu
dents were given notice to leave
the country, and several were
called to hearingsat Immigration
Court in San Francisco. These
students were in technical viola
tion of INS regulations. Most are
now appealing their cases.
The other Iranian students
here should have no problems as
long as they keep their visas and
I-94's up to date, according to
Mitchell Hall foreign student ad
viser on campus.
Iranian students were gener
ally pleased with the news.

"I'm happy to be here, to
finish my degree with no disrup
tions," a graduate student in in
dustrial engineering said.
Another student, who just re
ceived his Master's degree and
has now begun work on his Ph.D.
in electrical engineering, felt that
his rights had been violated by
the threat of deportation.
"I'm happy that I'm allowed to
finish my studies because that's
my right," he said. "When I
applied for admission here at
Stanford, if they didn't want me
to come here, they should have
told me from the beginning."
Another electrical engineer
ing student spoke with reserve
about being able to continue his
studies. "That's the way it should
be," he said.
