Being There ★ ★ ★ ★
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Hal Ashby (Coming Home,
Shampoo) directed this affecting,
gentle satire about a man whose
innocence becomes a valuable
commodity. Peter Sellers plays
Chance the gardener; his per
formance may be his best since he
played Quilty in Kubrick'sl.olita.
Being There is so tied to
Chance's deadpan, simplemin
dedly literal world-view that the
audience leaves the theater a lit
tle da/ed — our thought proces
ses have begun to slow and
stretch to match his. Shirley
MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas
(who won an Oscar for his ef
forts) turn in fine supporting
characterizations.
—Jim Mattson
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint. San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before,
but this sequel to Star Wars has
lost most of its sense of humor.
Everything's become deadly
serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet
creature who, for a moment,
manages to instill a sense of
magic and expectation. The
movie's ending is the biggest let
down of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with some
thing better than that after three
years of work?

The Tin Drum ★ ★ ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
"War is bad . . .War is
bad. . .War is bad. .." For all its
good intentions, the din of this
drum beats too long and too loud.
This adaptation of the Gunter
Grass novel is visually inventive;
and occasionally intriguing.
Weirdness, however, can only
carry one along just so far . ..
See this one for the vivid
cinematic moments everyone's
been telling you about (the kid
really does peer out in disgust
from his mother's womb); leave
the much-ballyhooed "hidden
meanings" to the book.
—Leslie Bixel

The Shining ★
Palo AJto Square
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's (too faithful?
not faithful enough?) adaptation
of the Stephen King novel
supplies neither the promised
shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman
in a bathtub) nor hinted-at
depths of characterization. Jack
Nicholson gleefully overplays his
role as madman-father to tele
pathic son Barry Lloyd; driven to

knife-wielding hysteria by it all is
mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing
performance — she has a capac
ity for pinpointing emotional
emptiness that a better movie
might have used to stunning ef
fect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to de
vote infinite care fashioning a
monument to nothing in particu
lar.

Some Like It Hot★ ★★ ★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Billy Wilder directed this clas
sic comedy; Marilyn Monroe.
Tony Curtis, and Jack Lemmon
star. Sex roles are torn apart
(Lemmon and Curtis spend most
tot the tilm in drag) only to be
more-or-less reestablished at the
end, proving once again that
nihilism is a girl's best friend. Not
to be missed.
—J.M.
The Black Stallion ★ ★ ★ ★
Park, Menlo Park
Carroli Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola, di
rected The Black Stallion as if the
only logic he had ever known was
a cinematic one. Incidents in the
film which, on the strictest narra
tive level, are absurd, seem per
fectly reasonable when viewed on
the film's own terms. Ballard has
lived up to his promise with a
work of striking imagery.
A boy and a horse are ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal. The
story is wish-fulfillment of the
highest order, a grand-scale re
working of "look what followed
me home. Ma."
—J.M.
Fame ★ ★ *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A New York school for the
performing arts forms the setting
for this interesting, uneven
drama. We see excerpts from the
lives of the students as they work
toward their only goal in life:
fame.
The acting, by a talented un
known cast, is oftentimes strik
ing, and several scenes — where
the entire school goes crazy danc
ing, singing and playing music —
border on brilliance. Unfortu
nately, the film's drama shows an
alarming tendency toward
melodrama, and at times all we
have on the screen is dramatic
mush.
Alan Parker directed; Michael
Gore supplied the music.
—Simon Labov

The Electric Horseman ★ ★ ★
Fox Theater, Redwood City
Sydney Pollack directed this
ode to modern-day populism
with an eye toward pleasing his
audience. Rodeo star/cereal
spokesman Robert Redford ste
als a $12 million racehorse in
order to set it free; jaded reporter
Jane Fonda strikes out after the
story and ends up falling in love.
Willie Nelson's music completes
the package.
The film has a sweetness of
tone that allows it to rise above
being merely slickly inoffensive.
It's evident that the director and
the performers are genuinely
fond of the movie's characters,
and such good naturedness is a
very rare commodity indeed.
—J.M.
The Goodbye Girl ★ *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil
Simon seem made for each other:
they both laugh too loudly at
their own jokes. Simon fans, and
there are many, should find this
movie to be entirely satisfactory,
but the movie's approach to com
edy seems almost clinical — one
gets the feeling that the jokes
have been fine-tuned by an audi
ence wearing electrodes. The
movie also features Marsha
Mason as a woman whose idea of
a fulfilling avocation is redecorat
ing her apartment. Herbert Ross
(The Turning Point, Nijinskyj di
rected.
—J.M.
The Blues Brothers Movie
Bijou, Palo Alto ★ ★ ★
If you can look past the ridicul
ous amount of money spent on
destruction (which admittedly
isn't easy), you will find a funny,
well-conceived movie. John
Landis (director. Animal House)
directed and co-wrote the script
with Dan Aykroyd. There's
plenty of good music and enter
taining dancing, but possibly the
most enjoyable partis just watch
ing Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues)
do their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go
home and think about — but then
it doesn't pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
