# U.S.-Japan leaders discuss environment

The second Japanese-
American Environmental
Conference, which will take
place here next Monday
through Thursday, is looking
for participants. With more
than 50 Japanese delegates
from a wide variety of
academic and business fields,
as well as presidents of sev
eral Japanese environmental
organizations in attendance,
Americans may be underre
presented.
Because of unavoidable de
lays in publicizing the event in
the United States, the confer
ence has full Japanese par
ticipation, but few American
delegates, according to King
Ming Young, manager of the
conference and associate di
rector of the Institute for In
tercultural Communication,
which is arranging the confer
ence.
"The program organizers
were caught in a bind,"
Young said. "We postponed
the promotion of this confer
ence until we received con
firmation from our funding
sources. Because there was a
delay in their response, the

publicity was severely hand
icapped."
Young said she fears the
American participants will be
outnumbered by their
Japanese guests. "It would be
awkward to have an Ameri
can minority in the audience
when the conference is in the
United States," she said.
When the first conference
was held in 1978, more than
80 Japanese delegates wel
comed the American delega
tion in Yokohama, Japan.
Claude Look, chairman of
the Japan Outings Commit
tee in 1978, said, "The major
purpose of the conference
was an exchange of informa
tion. Japan wanted to know
how Americans got so in
volved in environmental is
sues." He said the average
Japanese citizen is less aware
of broad environmental is
sues than the average Ameri
can .
The successful interaction
of Japanese and American
business and academic en
vironmental interests in 1978
prompted the conference
members to pledge to hold a
second conference in the Un
ited States.
