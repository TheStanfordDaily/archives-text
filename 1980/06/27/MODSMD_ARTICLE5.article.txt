# SLAC funds restored by House
## 
### Peter Steinerman Staff Writer 
An amended version of the
Energy and Water Development
Appropriations Bill for fiscal
year 1981 passed the House of
Representatives by a wide mar
gin this week. The current bill
restores $107.4 million of the
$178 million that had been cut

from the budget of the Office of
Research and Development of
the Department of Energy in a
previous version. The bill also
restores $16.5 million to the
Federal budget from which
SI. AC receives part of its operat
ing revenue.
According to a spokesman for
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park), the amendment to the bill
passed by a vote of 254-151,
while the bill itself passed
through the House Wednesday,
334-87. While the efforts of two
other Congressmen, Don Fuqua
(D-Fla.) and Mike McCormack
(D-Wash.), were crucial in the
bill's passage, McCloskey was
quoted as saying that without the
efforts of .SLAC Director
Wolfgang Panofsky, "nothing
would have happened."
The amendment was carried
by Senator Fuqua, who is the
chairman of the House Commit
tee on Science and Technology,
which is the authorizing commit
tee for Energy and Water De
velopment.
Panofsky explained that the
overall budget of the Energy and
Water Development Committee
had been decreased by $155
million, even as several new pro
jects for water and nuclear
power research were being
added to it. Accomodation of the
funding ceiling set by the House

Budget Committee forces a
"sacrifice" of other research pro
jects to permit the budgeting of
the newer ones.
Panofsky added that the
Energy and Water Development
Committee actually funded two
"independent" fields of re
search, causing "a lot of non
comparable things to be put into
competition."
The original version of the bill
would have cut $20.5 million
from the appropriations for the
operation of the three higher
energy physics facilities around
the country, including SLAC,
Fermilab in Illinois, and
New York's Brookhaven
Laboratories. Approximately
$7.5 million was also slated to be
cut from high energy physics'
"Capital Items" budget, which
provides for construction and
maintenance. Panofsky said that
the amended bill restores $16.5
million to the operations budget,
and added that he expected the
Senate to provide for the remain
ing $4 million when it resumes in
July.
Panofsky said that lobbying ef
forts for the amendment came
from several national academic
groups, including the American
Association of Universities, as
well as the 55 research organiza
tions currently utilizing SI.AC's
facilities.
