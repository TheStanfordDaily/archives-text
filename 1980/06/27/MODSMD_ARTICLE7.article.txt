## NATO members end two days of security talks 
### Don Oberdorfer Bradley Graham The Washington Post 
ANKARA, Turkey — Secret
ary ot State Edmund Muskie,
ending two days of talks with the
Atlantic allies, said yesterday
Soviet troops appeared to he
"hunkering down" in Afghanis
tan for a two- or three-year stay
and termed Moscow's an
nounced withdrawal there a "red
herring."
Muskie's comments came as
foreign ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) issued a communique
that condemned the Soviet inva
sion and called again for "im
mediate. unconditional and total
withdrawal" of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan The state
ment said the continued Soviet
occupation, now six months old,
"jeopardizes world peace."
At a press conference after
ward. Muskie defended Western
measures taken so far to pressure
the Soviets to leave Afghanistan
as "still in place, still working."
No new measures were publicly
suggested at this session.
Meeting in the wake of the
Venice summit, the NATO
ministers sought to reinforce the
show of alliance unity de
monstrated at the earlier gather
ing of the heads of the world's
seven most powerful non
communist countries. But differ
ences continued to show through
here between America and

Europe on foreign policy, par
ticularly on the Mideast.
Self-determination
U.S. officials blocked a Euro
pean effort here to win NATO
endorsement of the right to
Palestinian self-determination
diplomatic code words refer
ring to the right of Palestinian
refugees in Gaza and the West
Bank of the Jordan River to de
termine their own political fu
ture. Such a right was endorsed
by the nine nations of the Euro
pean Community at their summit
meeting two weeks ago.
But yesterday's NATO state
ment held to less committed lan
guage preferred "by the United
States. It spoke only of the need
for a Mideast settlement to
achieve the "legitimate rights of
the Palestinian people."
The earlier European action
drew an Israeli protest. It also
disturbed U S. officials who wor
ried that further European initia
tives in the Mideast could ruin
the Camp David framework for
Egyptian-Israeli peace talks — a
framework that the Europeans
believe should be expanded to
include the Palestinians.
The ministers also issued a
separate declaration condemn
ing terrorism and taking special
note of the holding of American
hostages in Iran.
Belgian resistance
Given less public attention
was the inability of the Belgian
government here to give its final

endorsement of the NATO mis
siles plan.
The NATO decision has en
countered serious resistance in
Belgium — one of the several
countries scheduled to take the
new missiles once they are de
ployed — and the Brussels gov
ernment, just recovering from a
political crisis, has not been in a
position to take a firm stand.
Belgian officials are said to be
awaiting the outcome of West
German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt's visit to Moscow before

acting themselves and have con
sidered sending their own mis
sion to Eastern Europe or Mos
cow.
The NATO ministers expres
sed hope that the SALT 11 treaty,
now stalled in the U.S. Senate,
would be ratified "at the earliest
opportunity."
Commenting on this, Muskie
came close to saying that the tre
aty could not be ratified while
Soviet troops remain in Af
ghanistan, but declined to state
such a judgment categorically.
