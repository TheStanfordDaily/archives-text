# Nicaraguans enjoy first anniversary

MANAGUA, Nicaragua —
Excitement is building here in
preparation for an ambitious
rally to celebrate the fall of dic
tator Anastasio Somoza.
Bulldozers are clearing space
for the new July 19 Plaza, plan
ned to hold 500,000 people —
about one-fifth of the country's
population.
Men and women of all ages
and walks of life are drilling
seven days a week to march to
the rally with their units of the
newly formed "People's
Militias."
The Sandinista People's Army
formed by the guerrillas and
youthful civilian supporters who
defeated Somoza's National
Guard a year ago is preparing its
first full-scale military parade.
The ruling Sandinista Libera
tion Front's high-level anniver
sary celebration committee has
invited a starstudded list of

foreign guests including the pres
idents of Costa Rica, Mexico and
Venezuela, Angela Davis, Jane
Fonda and an assortment of
other leftists and sympathizers.
The elaborate plans to celeb
rate the anniversary reflect the
Sandinista devotion to retelling
the history of Nicaraguan
nationalism from the time of na
tional hero Augusto Sandino's
campaign against the Marines
and their ally, the first Anastasio
Somoza, until the fall of his son
last year.
"This final defensive" that
overthrew Somoza began June 4,
the anniversary of a general
strike called by the Sandinistas.
Honoring the memory of the
"heroes and martyrs" of the
struggle against Somoza is an
important part of the Sandinista
mystique, and many neighbor
hoods have homemade monu
ments on every block to the
guerrillas and civilians killed
there by the National Guard.
One corner in the working
class neighborhood of Rigueiro
has a more elaborate monument,
a modernistic fountain erected to
the memory of ABC correspon
dent Bill Stewart who was killed
on that spot by a National
Guardsman.
Last Friday, one year after
Stewart's death. Junta member
Arturo Cruz dedicated the
monument, which bears a plaque
saying, "Bill Steward did not die
in a foreign land. We keep alive
his memory because he is part of
free Nicaragua."
Cruz recalled that the news
film of Stewart's death, broad
cast around the world, did much
to turn international opinion
against Somoza's tottering re
gime.
