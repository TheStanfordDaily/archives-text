Vatican sets euthanasia policy
VATICAN CITY — The Roman Catholic
Church, catching up with medical advances that
enable physicians to prolong the life of the dying
for months or years, said yesterday that doctors
and patients can morally refuse to use extreme
artifical means to ward off death.
In a 3000-word document, the church repeated
its condemnation of mercy killing but said
techniques of artificial life support can actually
pose a threat to the right to die peacefully and with
human dignity.
The declaration setting out formal guidelines on
euthanasia was issued by the Sacred Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith, the former Holy
Office, and approved by Pope John Paul 11.
The Vatican said it was drawn up to respond to
requests by bishops and priests, as well as doctors
and hospital personnel, for the church's position on
euthanasia in the light of new techniques for ex
tending the life of the terminally ill.
