Gay pride spilled over onto
the streets of San Francisco Sun
day, as the ninth annual Gay
Freedom Day Parade and Rally
attracted over 30,000 marching
participants and an estimated
250,000 observers.
A dozen members of the Stan
ford Gay Peoples' Union (GPU)
marched in the parade, and sev
eral dozen other members of the
Stanford community journeyed
up the peninsula to watch the
proceedings from the sidelines.
Enthusiastic crowds lined the
sidewalks as gay men, lesbians
and their supporters marched
down Market Street to the Civic
Center for an afternoon of
speeches and music. People
came from as far away as
Amsterdam. Canada and
Hawaii. Cities from all over
California were well
represented.
A variety of groups and indi
viduals participated in the
parade. Musical groups, such as
the Lesbian Chorus and the Gay
Men's Chorus, sang as they
marched. Political candidates
shook hands and waved to the
crowd as they passed by mem
bers of San Francisco's large gay
population.
The "Dykeson Bikes" contin
gent and the "Sisters of Per
petual Indulgence" — men dres
sed in nuns' habits — received
enthusiastic cheers.
Christian groups and
"Straights for Gay Rights" ming
led with "Commie Queers," an
organization of communist gays,
and members of the "Phoenix
Levis and Leather Club,"'

another gay organization.
The diversity of the crowd and
the marchers pointed to the fact
that gays come from all classcs,
races and occupations.
Jessica Crosson, a medical
student at Stanford, said she was
"delighted by the presence of the
Bay Area Physicians for Human
Rights and the Lesbian Doc
tors."
Other people criticized some
aspects of the Freedom Parade,
however. Naomi Porat, a Stan
ford junior, said, "I objected to
the exploitation of women's
bodies by transvestites. There
was a lot of that." A Stanford
alum agreed, saying that there
was a real mockery of women's
bodies in some cases.
Other critics of the parade ob
jected to the apolitical nature of
the banners and the speeches.
The march was more a festival
than a protest.
One observer disagreed. "It
was more radical than last year,"
he said. "There was only one sav
ings and loan."
Many felt the parade was less
well-attended than last year.
When asked if this indicated a
greater security among gays,
Rhio Hiersch of Stanford's Gay
People's Union, said. "Yes. It
indicated less of a need for a
sense of community because
there's less of a sense of being
outcasts. We feel more at
home."
I le emphasized that gays often
do not have some very basic
rights that other people do. This
was evident in the float from San
Jose which lamented the loss of
the gay rights ordinances in San
Jose and Santa Clara County on
the June 3 ballot.
