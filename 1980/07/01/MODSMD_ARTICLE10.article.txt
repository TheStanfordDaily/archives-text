# Congress can cut abortion funding
## 
### Jim Mann The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — The Sup
reme Court yesterday upheld the
authority of Congress to refuse
to pay for abortions, even when
they are said to be needed to pre
serve the health of indigent wo
men.
By the slim margin of 5 to 4,
the justices decided that nothing
in the U.S. Constitution or the
federal Medicaid law prohibits
Congress from cutting off most
federal aid for poor women's
abortions, as Congress has cho
sen to do for the past four years.
Pro-abortion and civil liberties
groups had argued that the cut
off was unfair and unconstitu
tional. They pointed out that the
Supreme Court has already de
cided that a woman has a con
stitutional right to choose an
abortion, and that under the
Medicaid program. Congress
pays for virtually all other medi
cal services. Thus, they con
tended, Congress is in effect
penalizing women for exercising
a constitutional right.
"Abortion is inherently diffe
rent from other medical proce
dures, because no other proce
dure involves the purposeful
termination of a human life,"
Justice Potter Stewart wrote for
the court.
The federal cut-off is com
monly called the Hyde Amend
ment after Rep. Henry Hyde

(R-111.)- the congressman who
first sponsored the provision in
1976.
The key constitutional ques
tions were whether the Hyde
Amendment deprives poor
women of either the liberty or
the equal protection of the laws
guaranteed by the U.S. Constitu
tion. Stewart concluded that the
law does neither.
Stewart reasoned that it is not
the federal government that pre
vents a poor woman from having
an abortion, but rather the wo
man's lack of money. And, he
noted, the court has chosen in its
decisions to allow government
officials greater latitude to dis
criminate against the poor than
they are allowed to discriminate
on the basis of race or national
origin.
For the minority. Justice Wil
liam Brennan wrote that the
court's "fundamental flaw" was
"its failure to acknowledge that
the discriminatory distribution
of the benefits of government
largesse can discourage the exer
cise of fundamental liberties just
as effectively as can an outright
denial of those rights through
criminal and regulatory means.
Also in the minority. Justice
Thurgood Marshall predicted
that the ruling would have "a de
vastating impact on the lives and
health of poor women" — some
of whom, he said, may "resort to
back-alley butchers."
