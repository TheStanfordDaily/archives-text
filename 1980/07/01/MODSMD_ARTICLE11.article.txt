SANTE FE, N.M. — Gannett
Co., Inc., the nation's largest
newspaper group, was ordered
by a federal judge yesterday to
return the Santa Fe New Mexican
to the newspaper's former
owner, Robert McKinney.
U.S. District Judge Santiago
Campos said his decision was
based on Friday's verdicts by a
six-member jury, which ruled
that Gannett breached an
employment contract McKinney
received during the 1976 merger
of The New Mexican into Gan
nett.
Flowever, jurors found that
Gannett had not entered into the
contract intending not to fulfill it.
Allen Neuharth, chairman and
president of Gannett, said the
company would appeal im
mediately.
Campos said that in view of
the jury's decisions, anything
other than return of the news
paper "would be just a patch
work job."

He said evidence showed that
Gannett officials "laid out a clear
trail as to theirattitude . . . which
clearly indicated they wanted
Mr. McKinney off the masthead
and that they wanted to strip him
of his responsibilities."
Neuharth, in a statement from
the company's Rochester, R.Y.,
headquarters, said the decision
was "outrageous" and"basedon
politics and provincialism rather
than fact or law."
McKinney had charged that
Gannett officials violated the
employment contract he re
ceived during the transaction by
taking certain personnel and
editorial actions without his con
sent.
Under the contract, he was to
retain several top positions at the
newspaper — including pub
lisher, editor-in-chief and
chairman of the board of direc
tors — for five years after the
merger.
Gannett attorneys argued that
certain actions by Gannett offi
cials were justified because

McKinney did not fulfill his
duties under the contract.
Campos ruled early in the trial
that Gannett breached McKin
ney's employment contact when
the newspaper published, over
McKinney's objections, a June 4,
1978, editorial endorsement of
gubernatorial candidate Bruce
King.
Campos tentatively set Aug. 5
for the second part of the trial,
which will consider how the re
turn of the newspaper would be
accomplished. But he said that
date may be changed if the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Denver agrees to hear Gannett's
appeal.
