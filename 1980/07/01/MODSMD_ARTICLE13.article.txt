# FAA downplays computer failures
## 
### Robert Jackson The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON â€” Federal
Aviation Administration offi
cials said yesterday that the prob
lem of computer failures at air
traffic control centers is lessen
ing, despite congressional
charges that a crisis exists.
Langhorne Bond, the FAA's
administrator, told a House sub
committee that computer break
downs have decreased by 53 per
cent, and that the interruptions
"have not posed a threat to
safety."
Bond denied reports that
some air traffic controllers were
asked to alter records to try to

minimize the problem of break
downs.
He challenged Reps. John
Burton (D-San Francisco) and
Robert Whittaker (R-Kan.),
who said they were told of such
incidents, to "give me one single
example of a falsified record, one
piece of evidence." Burton and
Whittaker said they would not
do so at this time.
The four-year-old problem of
computer outages in the nation's
air tracking system has gained
new attention in recent weeks as
failures were reported at Frem
ont and Palmdale air traffic con
trol centers that track aircraft
over Northern and Southern
California, respectively.
In addition, a similar break
down at Chicago has left that
area's computerized safety sys

tern out of commission for the
last 1 1 days.
When such failures occur, air
traffic controllers must switch
over to an older "broadband"
radar system that includes the
use of small plastic tags, known
as "shrimp boats," to mark the
location of 20 or more aircraft in
the same vicinity.
Noting that controllers must
quickly radio the planes involved
to determine their altitude, since
the older system does not au
tomatically show altitude. Bur
ton compared it to "driving on a
California freeway 100 miles an
hour during heavy fog."
Bond, however, said that since
the computerized system went
into effect in 1976, "perfor
mance has been steadily improv
ing, not getting worse."
