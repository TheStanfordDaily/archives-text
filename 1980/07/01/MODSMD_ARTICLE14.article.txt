## Press ignores liberation 
### 
September 7, 1979 marked an
historic moment in the history of
United States-Puerto Rico rela
tions. By commuting the sen
tences of the four Puerto Rican
Nationalist prisoners on that
day.the Carter administration
threw out a straw into the winds of
contemporary geopolitics. The
release of Oscar Collazo. Rafael
Cancel Miranda. Irvin Flores
and Lolita Lebron. self
proclaimed soldiers in the na
tional liberation struggle of
Puerto Rico, was applauded by
the vast majority of the Puerto
Rican people, whatever their
political persuasions.
While most Americans may
think of the Nationalists as a
band of terrorists or fanatic
gunmen, the truth of the matter
is that they were proclaiming, al
beit in a violent fashion, a cry for
nationhood and freedom that
goes back more than 100 years.
Their release by President
Jimmy Carter produced a few
headlines at the time. However,
it was followed soon after by the
restoration of the historic curtain
of silence in the news media that
has been in force for years
around the Puerto Rican inde
pendence movement.
The enforced silence of the
colonized and marginalized na
tions will continue to be broken
by the sounds of bombs and the
sight of bloodshed until those
who have ears to hear and eyes to
see have them opened by the
voice of reason.
That the curtain of silence be
again cynically or carelessly
brought down around the issues
inherent in Puerto Rico's con
tinuing colonial status is pure
folly. If there is any lesson still
unlearned by the Anglo-
American peoples, it is that the
suppression of national libera
tion movements along with the
self-imposed ignorance about
the oppressive conditions under

colonial rule will only steel adhe
rents of independence and
economic self-determination for
further resistance. Rhodesia and
Northern Ireland attest to the
bankruptcy of political systems
based on colonial domination
and rule by former colonialists.
Clearly, the odds are over
whelmingly against the national
liberation movement in Puerto
Rico. The combined resources of
the American armed forces and
the law enforcement agencies in
Puerto Rico and the United
States, along with the numbing
effects of welfare dependency on
the Puerto Rican populace,
make the prospects for indepen
dence through armed struggle
seem implausible and suicidal.
And yet. the struggle continues.
It is in the interests of all
peoples to encourage an en
lightened dialogue and a peace
ful conclusion to these liberation
efforts. Politicians running for
the Presidency in "Campaign
80" are fooling themselves and
the American public by promis
ing continued federal benefits
and the dubious honor of being
Americans first and Puerto Ri
cans second.
The release of the four
Nationalist prisoners should sig
nal the United States' commit
ment to engage knowingly in the
inevitable process of decoloniza
tion and independence of Puerto
Rico. Only then will the re
volutionary shot heard round the
world in 1 776 be a lasting symbol
of thiscountry'sfundamental be
lief in the principle of freedom
and justice for all. Until Puerto
Rico is able to determine its na
tional destiny freely and fully,
the American Revolution will be
unfinished and the American
people unfree.
