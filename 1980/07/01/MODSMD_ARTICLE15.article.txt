## Anderson not a liberal candidate

"Come on now professionals,
come on now WASP's, come on
now all of you who earn over
$25,000 a year, lei's get together
in this new effort."
Independent Presidential
candidate John Anderson
(U.S. News and World Report,
May 19, 1980)
Of course, John Anderson
didn't mean for it to come out
quite that way. The interviewer
had tossed him an embarrassing
question about the narrowness
of his constituency, and in his
fumbling and inarticulate at
tempt at an answer, Anderson let
loose the above characterization
of his campagin strategy to date.
He went on to admit that he has
some work ahead of him trying
to expand his appeal beyond the
white, liberal, upper and
upper-middle classes.
He sure does. Anderson may
be the darling of the elite media
(the New York Times said of
Anderson, "Why Not the
Best?") and he may be popular
on elite upper-class campuses
like Stanford, but Anderson has
yet to capture the heart of the
average steel-worker in
Pittsburgh or cotton farmer in
Mississippi or truck-driver in
California.
Why John Anderson has cap
tured the allegiance of affluent
liberals is a deep mystery. An
derson has the attitude and de
meanor of a small-town Mid
western preacher: pompously
self-righteous; eager to lecture
us on our sins and determined to
reform our evil ways (via his
proposed punitive gasoline tax,

for example); and devoted to
doing good to us whether we
want to be done good by or not.
On June 19, 1961, Anderson
introduced in Congress a prop
osed Constitutional amendment:
"Section I. This nation dev
outly recognizes the authority and
law of Jesus Christ, Saviour and
Ruler of nations, through whom
are bestowed the blessings of Al
mighty God. ..."
He reintroduced the amendment
on March 11, 1963.
Evidently, the sainted John
did not view Jews, atheists and
other infidels as members in
good standing of this nation —
the First Amendment not
withstanding.
Of course, the Anderson
legend has it that this latter-day
political Elmer Gantry turned
away from his old life of reactio
nary conservatism in the mid
'60s and was born again as a new
and shining liberal.
L.et's look at the record.
In 1971, Anderson supported
extending the draft for two years,
and voted against ending the
draft and against limiting the ex
tension of the draft to one year.
He favors the introduction of
theater nuclear weapons in
Western Europe; he favors in
creased military aid to the Pakis
tani dictatorship: he voted for
the neutron bomb and the B-l
bomber.
Anderson supports Carter's
attempt to antagonize the
Soviets via the grain embargo
and Olympic boycott. After the
phony crisis over the Soviet
brigade in Cuba last fall, Ander
son denounced Carter for being
too dovish, for "ignominously
backing down" before the

Soviets.
Anderson favors a strong
American naval presence in the
Persian Gulf region and believes
that a Soviet occupation of Iran
would require a prompt U.S. re
sponse, possibly including the
use of force. (Even Ronald
Reagan is willing to admit that
military intervention in such a
situation would be impracticable
and a "threat to world peace.")
On the domestic front. Ander
son supports tax breaks for in
vestors and a balanced budget
but opposes any serious tax cuts
for America's working people —
he supports the traditional con
servation program. (Again, even
Reagan no longer rigidly adheres
to that position.)
In short, honest John is no
more a liberal than the Ayatollah
Khomeini is a born-again South
ern Baptist. Now that the old
time religion of New Deal
liberalism is dying and
thoroughly discredited, its one
time devotees are evidently wil
ling to latch on to anyone — even
a fraud like John Anderson —
who mumbles a few lines from
the old gospel.
Of course, Anderson is not re
ally a conservative either. He's
something much worse: a politi
cal opportunist who uses a loud
voice and an obnoxious manner
to hide his utter lack of consis
tent positions or firm principles.
The fact that many members
of America's liberal elite have al
lowed themselves to be suckered
by this Midwestern preacher
man is. perhaps, the final proof
that American liberalism is in
deed dead.
