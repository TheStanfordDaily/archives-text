## Releasing of hostages imminent 
### 
In the light of recent events, it
is probably safe to predict that
the hostages in Iran will be re
leased before they celebrate
their first anniversary of captiv
ity. One might even hazard to
guess that they will be back be
fore the November election.
Now what is the basis for this
prediction?
My prediction is not based on
the tractability of the militants or
government officials in Iran. In a
pattern already seen in Euro
pean history the aristocracy has
united with the radical discon
tents in Iran to overthrow the

classes created by economic
progress. The old landowners
and mullahs who lost privileges
under the thrust of moderniza
tion united with the young milit
ants who sought a political order
based on religious or anti-
Western ideology. In their facti
ous ranks flexibility is not to be
found.
My prediction is founded on
the certainty, long appreciated
by the Carter administration,
that the one and only condition
for the release of the hostages
was the death of the deposed
Shah at the hands of an Iranian
firing squad or from the ravages
of cancer.
Now that the Shah lies dying in
Egypt it seems that the Iranians
will get an execution of sorts and
the hostages will be released.
Those who whine about the
strident military posturing of the
U .S. with regard to Iran are bark
ing up the wrong tree. The ad
ministration probably enter
tained the notion of major milit
ary action only for a very brief

time. The calculable safety of
waiting for the Shah to die would
be a much more attractive prop
osition to a policymaker.
Carter was prepared to do just
that until pressures from sagging
public opinion ratings and from
military activists tempted him to
try to kill two birds with one
stone with the rescue mission. It
was then that Vance resigned in
the face of what he saw to be a
precipitous deviation from a
previously planned strategy.
So now we bide our time. Car
ter's policy has reduced us to
waiting for an aged, ailing, and
some say, bitter man to die.
When he does die, and the hos
tages come home, and after the
TV interviews are over, it will
not have been a victory for
American foreign policy. And
anv claim to credit for the hos
stages* release by the administra
tion will be spurious.
