We reject the reinstatement of
registration and the draft as un
necessary, immoral and uncon
stitutional: unnecessary because
in this age of high technology and
nuclear overkill, a conventional
land army has now become obso
lete; immoral, in that it forces
Americans, against their wishes,
to work towards the death and
destruction of other peoples and,
in many cases, repressing these

peoples solely to maintain the
power of large corporations or
American puppet governments:
and unconstitutional because the
Fourteenth Amendment of the
United States Constitution
guarantees freedom from "in
voluntary servitude."
