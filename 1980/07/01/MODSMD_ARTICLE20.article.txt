# New cruise missiles draw harsh criticism
## 
### Michael Getler The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — The Pen
tagon, in an extraordinary dis
play of faith in new technology, is
counting heavily on a quartet of
new cruise missiles to help main
tain the arms balance with Mos
cow — even though none of
these missiles is operational yet.
In effect, the United States is
making a $10 billion bet that
these low-flying missiles, which
look like flying torpedoes, will
not only work as advertised but
also quickly close a missile gap
with the Soviets that officials fear
could otherwise open in a few
years.
The Defense Department's
top officials and scientists are
unanimous in their praise and
confidence in these new weapons
and are moving full speed ahead
on all four at roughly the same
time, with little or no challenge
within the defense establishment
and Congress.
Yet a small group of critics
warn privately that these
weapons could be Hying toward
"a total flop" and creating a false
sense of security for a portion of
the future U.S. missile arsenal.
The critics argue that these
missiles would have a hard time
finding their targets in a real war
time situation and that the prog
ram of flight testing in this coun
try could be tailor-made for
"cooking up" the kind of results
that feed a false sense of confi
dence.
Cruise missiles are basically
small, pilotless airplanes, pow
ered by jet engines and carrying
either an atomic bomb or a large
conventional non-nuclear explo
sive in the nose. The missile can
be fired from land, sea or air at
targets many hundreds of miles
away, supposedly with extreme
accuracy.
The key to doing this is a very
sophisticated electronic brain in
each missile which consists of an
inertial guidance system to put
the missile on its initial course, a
second guidance system to cor
rect its position as it flies toward

the target, and a computer to
give it the orders.
In essence, the cruise missile is
throughly "American" in the
eyes of both its supporters and
critics. To its supporters, it
exploits areas of technology
where the United States has a
considerable edge to produce a
dramatic advance in weaponry,
while to its critics it reflects a fas
cination with technology that has
led to too many excessively com
plex weapons that don't perform
as advertised.
In all of the programs, the
cruise missile is basically meant
to replace airplanes. The idea is
to launch the cruise missile well
outside the range of enemy de
fenses that might otherwise
shoot down the missile-carrying
airplane.
William Perry, undersecret
ary of defense for research and
engineering and the Pentagon's
top scientist, countered the
charge that the United States is
putting too many eggs in one
technological basket with the
cruise missiles by pointing out
that America's landbased ICBM
force is supposed to be moder
nized with the new MX missile
and that the new Trident
missile-firing submarines will
also soon begin entering the
fleet.
Perry is the principal driving
force behind the cruise missile.
Some of his friendly critics think
he has a case of "cruise
missilitis."
The critics focus on several
areas.
Historically, they say, cruise
missiles are not new, having been
used by the Germans in World
War 11 in the form of crude "buzz
bombs." Much more modern
versions were built by the U.S.
Navy and Air Force in the early
1960s in the Regulus and
Matador missile programs.
Neither of these missiles was
very reliable, and critics believe
new versions with better
technology still face the burden
of history.
The much more severe test.

they believe, lies in the very low
altitude and high-speed envi
ronment in which the cruise mis
sile flies. These missiles take a
pounding, sometimes for hours,
in the turbulent air at low level.
This plays havoc with gyroscopes
trying to hold the missile on
course and generally contributes
to reliability problems with in
struments. they say.
Stored in the computer mem
ory of each missile is an elec
tronic "map" of the route the
missile is supposed to take to the
target. These are prepared from

pictures taken by space satellites
or reconnaissance planes of po
tential enemy territory. By using
a special electronic scanning de
vice on the missile that points
toward the ground, the missile's
brain is supposed to compare
what the ground looks like to
what the map looks like.
With this electronic match-up
telling the computer exactly
where the missile is, it then sends
a "fix" to the inertial guidance
system, correcting any naviga
tional errors that may have crept
in during the flight so far, De

pending on the length of the
flight, the missile might need to
fly over or near several fix points
in orderactually to hit the target.
The eritics have little confi
dence in tests run on missile
ranges in the western United
States where the terrain is well
known. They suspect that the hig
financial stakes and widespread
involvement of industry, both
military services and the Penta
gon's research establishment will
produce a "cruise missile cartel"
unwilling to challenge test re
sults.

"a total flop" and creating a false
sense of security for a portion of
the future U.S. missile arsenal.
The critics argue that these
missiles would have a hard time
finding their targets in a real war
time situation and that the prog
ram of flight testing in this coun
try could be tailor-made for
"cooking up" the kind of results
that feed a false sense of confi
dence.
Cruise missiles are basically
small, pilotless airplanes, pow
ered by jet engines and carrying
either an atomic bomb or a large
conventional non-nuclear explo
sive in the nose. The missile can
be fired from land, sea or air at
targets many hundreds of miles
away, supposedly with extreme
accuracy.
The key to doing this is a very
sophisticated electronic brain in
each missile which consists of an
inertial guidance system to put
the missile on its initial course, a
second guidance system to cor
rect its position as it flies toward

the target, and a computer to
give it the orders.
In essence, the cruise missile is
throughly "American" in the
eyes of both its supporters and
critics. To its supporters, it
exploits areas of technology
where the United States has a
considerable edge to produce a
dramatic advance in weaponry,
while to its critics it reflects a fas
cination with technology that has
led to too many excessively com
plex weapons that don't perform
as advertised.
In all of the programs, the
cruise missile is basically meant
to replace airplanes. The idea is
to launch the cruise missile well
outside the range of enemy de
fenses that might otherwise
shoot down the missile-carrying
airplane.
William Perry, undersecret
ary of defense for research and
engineering and the Pentagon's
top scientist, countered the
charge that the United States is
putting too many eggs in one
technological basket with the
cruise missiles by pointing out
that America's landbased ICBM
force is supposed to be moder
nized with the new MX missile
and that the new Trident
missile-firing submarines will
also soon begin entering the
fleet.
Perry is the principal driving
force behind the cruise missile.
Some of his friendly critics think
he has a case of "cruise
missilitis."
The critics focus on several
areas.
Historically, they say, cruise
missiles are not new, having been
used by the Germans in World
War 11 in the form of crude "buzz
bombs." Much more modern
versions were built by the U.S.
Navy and Air Force in the early
1960s in the Regulus and
Matador missile programs.
Neither of these missiles was
very reliable, and critics believe
new versions with better
technology still face the burden
of history.
The much more severe test.

they believe, lies in the very low
altitude and high-speed envi
ronment in which the cruise mis
sile flies. These missiles take a
pounding, sometimes for hours,
in the turbulent air at low level.
This plays havoc with gyroscopes
trying to hold the missile on
course and generally contributes
to reliability problems with in
struments. they say.
Stored in the computer mem
ory of each missile is an elec
tronic "map" of the route the
missile is supposed to take to the
target. These are prepared from

pictures taken by space satellites
or reconnaissance planes of po
tential enemy territory. By using
a special electronic scanning de
vice on the missile that points
toward the ground, the missile's
brain is supposed to compare
what the ground looks like to
what the map looks like.
With this electronic match-up
telling the computer exactly
where the missile is, it then sends
a "fix" to the inertial guidance
system, correcting any naviga
tional errors that may have crept
in during the flight so far, De

pending on the length of the
flight, the missile might need to
fly over or near several fix points
in orderactually to hit the target.
The eritics have little confi
dence in tests run on missile
ranges in the western United
States where the terrain is well
known. They suspect that the hig
financial stakes and widespread
involvement of industry, both
military services and the Penta
gon's research establishment will
produce a "cruise missile cartel"
unwilling to challenge test re
sults.
WASHINGTON — The Pen
tagon, in an extraordinary dis
play of faith in new technology, is
counting heavily on a quartet of
new cruise missiles to help main
tain the arms balance with Mos
cow — even though none of
these missiles is operational yet.
In effect, the United States is
making a $10 billion bet that
these low-flying missiles, which
look like flying torpedoes, will
not only work as advertised but
also quickly close a missile gap
with the Soviets that officials fear
could otherwise open in a few
years.
The Defense Department's
top officials and scientists are
unanimous in their praise and
confidence in these new weapons
and are moving full speed ahead
on all four at roughly the same
time, with little or no challenge
within the defense establishment
and Congress.
