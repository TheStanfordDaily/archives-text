# Firearm debate continues: New York passes new law

BOSTON â€” Five years ago,
blunt warnings went up at the
borders of Massachusetts:
Anyone convicted of carrying a
gun without a state permit goes
to jail for one year.
No exception. No probation.
No suspension. No furlough.
Today, firearms advocates
still bristle over the law billed
as the country's toughest gun
control measure, but its sup
porters say it is a lifesaver.
** It's the single best law in the
country," said retired Judge-
John Fox, who helped sponsor
the penalty and remains its
most passionate advocate.
"It has the main ingredient:
the certainty of punishment for
lawbreakers," he said. "Police
officers say they can see the
effect now, with fewer guns in
evidence."
A similar measure was
signed into law in New York by
Gov. Hugh Carey on June 13.
It mandates a one-year prison
term for anyone convicted of
having a loaded, illegal hand
gun in public. But there, a
judge may waive the penalty if

he feels it is too harsh for the
circumstances.
Current New York law pro
vides for up to 15 years for il
legal gun possession but such
sentences are rare. Of 3N94
felony gun arrests in New York
City in 1 97N, only 7 percent re
sulted in prison sentences.
After the Massachusetts sta
tute took effect in April 1975.
the death rate from gun-related
incidents dropped, said Da\ id
Bartley.who was Massachusetts
1 louse speaker when he helped
sponsor the law. He is now
president of Holyoke Com
munity College.
"Five years later, there are at
least 50 to 75 more people alive
each year," he said. "That's
good. It won't solve the ills of
society, but there is no reason
for anyone to carry a gun on the
streets unless he is a police of
ficer."
Public Safety Secretary
George Luciano said he's so
encouraged that he is propos
ing a similar required jail term
for drug trafficking.
"It was not intended to be a
gun control law," he said. "It
was intended, as the legislative
mandate said, to decrease the

incidence of violent crime in
volving firearms away from
home or business."
But the law contains a fea
ture that's particularly nettle
some to its opponents: simply
carrying a gun outside a home
or business is a violation, even
if no other crime is involved.
"When this law was prop
osed," said Michael Yacino,
executive director of the Ciun
Owners' Action League, "it
was as a penalty for'illegal use'
of a gun. Now that was a great
idea. That was aimed at the
criminal.
The mandatory jail term got
mixed marks in a two-year
study by a group of Boston and
Northeastern University scho
lars.
"Although there was a re
duction in certain types of gun
crimes alter Bartley-Fox went
into effect, (all) persons who
illegally carried a firearm by no
means went to jail for one
year,'' said Professor David
Rossman of the Boston Uni
versity School of Law.
Rossman said the Bartley
f ox law cut the number of gun
assaults, but that non-gun as
saults increased.
