# Geologist studies many realms

### Allen Chen Staff Writer 
Peering through the viewport
of the deep submersible Alvin,
the geologist gazed on a haunting
landscape at the bottom of the
Atlantic.
"The terrain was grandiose —
large lava flows with a coarse
sneaking interwoven lace of
huge tuhes, often with collapsed
tops and caverns under
neath. . . ."
Was it only the beauty of the
undersea landscape that moti
vated Geology Prof. Tjeerd van
Andel to ride Alvin to the Atlan
tic seafloor to view the mid-
Atlantic Ridge?
"... 1 saw my first oceanic
fault six inches high, the next one
two feet, but there they were.
Then a bigger one, some 90 feet,
looking like a pile of cookies that
had somehow been sliced, or a
gigantic wine rack with sliced
basalt pillows for bottle bot
toms. . . ."
The above passages, excerp
ted from his book. Tales of an
Old Ocean, describe dream-like
alien landscapes seen by only a
handful of humans.
Scientists study nature for dif
ferent reasons. Some see beauty
in nature's works, like the land
scape of the mid-ocean ridge.
For others, the laws of symmetry
and structure which govern the
universe are pleasing to con
template.
Some are driven by a heartfelt
concern for humanity. They seek
scientific solutions to human

problems such as generating
energy, controlling population
growth or raising efficient pro
tein crops.
A few simply enjoy solving
puzzles.
Van Andel became interested
in science for a combination of
these reasons. He originally
chose archaeology as his field.
"Hut since there was no demand
for Dutch archaeologists trained
in Indonesia, I turned to geology.
Mostly. I have been fascinated
by the historical aspects of the
earth." he said.
Van Andel's views about na
ture and science changed along
with his career. While shifting
from one geologic specialty to
another, including paleoc
limatology (the study of the his
tory of earth's climate), marine
sedimentation processes, the
geology of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, and the Galapagos Rift
zone, he formulated a general
way of looking at the world. The
earth is a place where catas
trophic changes occur periodi
cally, according to van Andel.
Nothing on earth stays the same
for very long, and yet ihe earth
survives and continues.
As to why the universe exists,
van Andel claims to have no
strong beliefs. "I am not basi

tally a religious person, and 1 do
not believe in an all-knowing
God," he said.
1 lowever, the order of the uni
verse causes van Andel to be
lieve in a creator. "It seems as
though the universe is too com
plex to have been formed by
chance. There is evidence of a
pattern, and this implies that
there must be a pattern-maker,"
he said.
Van Andel realized that he
wanted to study different classes
of geological problems while he
was studying shallow water sed
iments.
"After a while, the solution to all
problems began to look the
same," he said. "The calcareous
(calcium-bearing) sediments I
was studying off the coast of Au
stralia looked a lot like those off
the Gulf of Mexico. They
seemed to have formed in the
same way, and 1 did not know
whether 1 was too stupid to fi
gure out how the sediments in
Australia really formed, or
whether both really had formed
the same way."
So, he began an odyssey which
took him through several
branches of earth history, espe
cially those concerned with the
sea. In addition to geological
problems, van Andel studied the

history of life on earth, especially
its early history in the sea.
He has also researched the
sea's impact on human affairs —
the economic aspects of mineral
resources and the politics of the
sea.
"1 like to be out on ships, out
on the ocean, watching the sun
set," van Andel said. "I enjoy
the feeling of independence, of
working with a hand-picked
group of scientists who must im
provise solutions to technical

problems when they are far from
any port."
More than other scientists, van
Andel is willing to transgress the
boundaries of his discipline. For
a time, he thought the scientific
method was the superior way of
learning about the universe.
"1 felt I was dealing with the
world in a better manner . . .
(Now)I do not believe that artifi
cial barriers exist between discip
lines, but that each one has its
own tools and methods"

More than other scientists, van
Andel is willing to transgress the
boundaries of his discipline. For
a time, he thought the scientific
method was the superior way of
learning about the universe.
"1 felt I was dealing with the
world in a better manner . . .
(Now)I do not believe that artifi
cial barriers exist between discip
lines, but that each one has its
own tools and methods"

Peering through the viewport
of the deep submersible Alvin,
the geologist gazed on a haunting
landscape at the bottom of the
Atlantic.
"The terrain was grandiose —
large lava flows with a coarse
sneaking interwoven lace of
huge tuhes, often with collapsed
tops and caverns under
neath. . . ."
Was it only the beauty of the
undersea landscape that moti
vated Geology Prof. Tjeerd van
Andel to ride Alvin to the Atlan
tic seafloor to view the mid-
Atlantic Ridge?
"... 1 saw my first oceanic
fault six inches high, the next one
two feet, but there they were.
Then a bigger one, some 90 feet,
looking like a pile of cookies that
had somehow been sliced, or a
gigantic wine rack with sliced
basalt pillows for bottle bot
toms. . . ."
The above passages, excerp
ted from his book. Tales of an
Old Ocean, describe dream-like
alien landscapes seen by only a
handful of humans.
Scientists study nature for dif
ferent reasons. Some see beauty
in nature's works, like the land
scape of the mid-ocean ridge.
For others, the laws of symmetry
and structure which govern the
universe are pleasing to con
template.
Some are driven by a heartfelt
concern for humanity. They seek
scientific solutions to human

problems such as generating
energy, controlling population
growth or raising efficient pro
tein crops.
A few simply enjoy solving
puzzles.
Van Andel became interested
in science for a combination of
these reasons. He originally
chose archaeology as his field.
"Hut since there was no demand
for Dutch archaeologists trained
in Indonesia, I turned to geology.
Mostly. I have been fascinated
by the historical aspects of the
earth." he said.
Van Andel's views about na
ture and science changed along
with his career. While shifting
from one geologic specialty to
another, including paleoc
limatology (the study of the his
tory of earth's climate), marine
sedimentation processes, the
geology of the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, and the Galapagos Rift
zone, he formulated a general
way of looking at the world. The
earth is a place where catas
trophic changes occur periodi
cally, according to van Andel.
Nothing on earth stays the same
for very long, and yet ihe earth
survives and continues.
As to why the universe exists,
van Andel claims to have no
strong beliefs. "I am not basi

tally a religious person, and 1 do
not believe in an all-knowing
God," he said.
1 lowever, the order of the uni
verse causes van Andel to be
lieve in a creator. "It seems as
though the universe is too com
plex to have been formed by
chance. There is evidence of a
pattern, and this implies that
there must be a pattern-maker,"
he said.
Van Andel realized that he
wanted to study different classes
of geological problems while he
was studying shallow water sed
iments.
"After a while, the solution to all
problems began to look the
same," he said. "The calcareous
(calcium-bearing) sediments I
was studying off the coast of Au
stralia looked a lot like those off
the Gulf of Mexico. They
seemed to have formed in the
same way, and 1 did not know
whether 1 was too stupid to fi
gure out how the sediments in
Australia really formed, or
whether both really had formed
the same way."
So, he began an odyssey which
took him through several
branches of earth history, espe
cially those concerned with the
sea. In addition to geological
problems, van Andel studied the

history of life on earth, especially
its early history in the sea.
He has also researched the
sea's impact on human affairs —
the economic aspects of mineral
resources and the politics of the
sea.
"1 like to be out on ships, out
on the ocean, watching the sun
set," van Andel said. "I enjoy
the feeling of independence, of
working with a hand-picked
group of scientists who must im
provise solutions to technical

problems when they are far from
any port."
