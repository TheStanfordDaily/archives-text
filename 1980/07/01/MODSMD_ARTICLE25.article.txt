## movies / tom vitale Kubrick's Shining is good, but no masterpiece 
### 
I went to see The Shining with
the highest expectations. There
is no director more technically
adept than Stanley Kubrick. Jack
Nicholson, who always overacts,
plays a part that begs tor overact
ing. Shelley Duvall, playing a de
voted though slightly catatonic
wife and mother, is also well cast.
And. of course. The Shining is a
horror movie, and I love horror
movies.
Nicholson does in fact revel in
his role of a homicidal maniac.
He lumbers around bug-eyed,
foaming at the mouth and wag
ging his tongue. Duvall starts out
a little too dizzy, but soon she
resembles a large scrawny nest
ing bird, not too imposing, but
willing to protect her young at all
costs. The remaining actors nor

tentiously underact, with the ex
ception of Scatman Crothers, the
cook, who is trapped in a point
less. disposable role.
Alas, it is Kubrick who disap
points. His unequaled facility
with the technology of filmmak
ing has distracted him from his
greater purpose. Effects are in
cluded for their own sake rather
than for their contribution to the
film as a whole. Kubrick the
scriptwriter also slips, and we
miss the cogent, tight screenplay
we expect from him.
While not a masterpiece of the
genre. The Shining is still a very
good horror film, especially
when compared with Gothic
garbage like Amityville Horror
or Prophecy.
The plot of The Shining is verv

simple. Nicholson plays a writer
offered the job of winter
caretaker of a large Colorado re
sort hotel. Hoping that this sec
lusion will allow him to write, he
accepts and brings along his wife
(Duvall) and young son Danny
(Danny Lloyd) to this snow
bound Elysium. But this is no
writer's paradise; the hotel is
haunted or perhaps just haunt
ing. Nicholson goes off the deep
end and chases his wife and child
with an axe.
A stock horror plot like this
would be. 1 thought, a perfect
vehicle for Kubrick, who can
manipulate our emotions as well
as any director. The success of
horror movies, the preference of
masochist filmgoers. is hinged
upon the director's effective toy
ing with the audience's emo
tions. The movie must make us
squirm. The best indicator of the
quality of a horror film is the in
tensity with which we desire to
be somewhere else, like in
church or maybe Candlestick
Park. The Shining does make us
squirm, but we squirm too much
and become inured to it.
The way to discomfort an au
dience is to give advance warning
of unavoidable disaster. Plenty
ot advance warning is given in
The Shining. The first few scenes
are aerial views of frigid moun
tain lakes and landscapes. The
gliding, surreal quality of these
scenes tells us that, as in all
dreams, we are alone. These

sequences almost make us
queasy and put us very ill at ease.
We are told early in the film
that a previous caretaker, in a fit
of "cabin fever," took to his wife
and daughters with an axe and to
himself with a shotgun.

Throughout the rest of the film
young Danny's incomplete pres
ience. the "shining" of the title,
reminds us of Nicholson's im
pending homicidal mania.
But the best evidence that
Nicholson is going to go honkers
is Nicholson himself. Hell, the
man looks like the devil. He'sgot
those funny arched eyebrows, a
hideous grin, and a hairline that
receeds at the corners of his
forehead and makes the exposed
shiny skin look like little horns.
The instant we see his face we
know that he's going to do some
thing nasty.
At this point Kubrick makes a
mistake. 1 le does not convince us


Nicholson
