## movies / tom vitale Kubrick's Shining is good, but no masterpiece 
### 
I went to see The Shining with
the highest expectations. There
is no director more technically
adept than Stanley Kubrick. Jack
Nicholson, who always overacts,
plays a part that begs tor overact
ing. Shelley Duvall, playing a de
voted though slightly catatonic
wife and mother, is also well cast.
And. of course. The Shining is a
horror movie, and I love horror
movies.
Nicholson does in fact revel in
his role of a homicidal maniac.
He lumbers around bug-eyed,
foaming at the mouth and wag
ging his tongue. Duvall starts out
a little too dizzy, but soon she
resembles a large scrawny nest
ing bird, not too imposing, but
willing to protect her young at all
costs. The remaining actors nor

tentiously underact, with the ex
ception of Scatman Crothers, the
cook, who is trapped in a point
less. disposable role.
Alas, it is Kubrick who disap
points. His unequaled facility
with the technology of filmmak
ing has distracted him from his
greater purpose. Effects are in
cluded for their own sake rather
than for their contribution to the
film as a whole. Kubrick the
scriptwriter also slips, and we
miss the cogent, tight screenplay
we expect from him.
While not a masterpiece of the
genre. The Shining is still a very
good horror film, especially
when compared with Gothic
garbage like Amityville Horror
or Prophecy.
The plot of The Shining is verv

simple. Nicholson plays a writer
offered the job of winter
caretaker of a large Colorado re
sort hotel. Hoping that this sec
lusion will allow him to write, he
accepts and brings along his wife
(Duvall) and young son Danny
(Danny Lloyd) to this snow
bound Elysium. But this is no
writer's paradise; the hotel is
haunted or perhaps just haunt
ing. Nicholson goes off the deep
end and chases his wife and child
with an axe.
A stock horror plot like this
would be. 1 thought, a perfect
vehicle for Kubrick, who can
manipulate our emotions as well
as any director. The success of
horror movies, the preference of
masochist filmgoers. is hinged
upon the director's effective toy
ing with the audience's emo
tions. The movie must make us
squirm. The best indicator of the
quality of a horror film is the in
tensity with which we desire to
be somewhere else, like in
church or maybe Candlestick
Park. The Shining does make us
squirm, but we squirm too much
and become inured to it.
The way to discomfort an au
dience is to give advance warning
of unavoidable disaster. Plenty
ot advance warning is given in
The Shining. The first few scenes
are aerial views of frigid moun
tain lakes and landscapes. The
gliding, surreal quality of these
scenes tells us that, as in all
dreams, we are alone. These

sequences almost make us
queasy and put us very ill at ease.
We are told early in the film
that a previous caretaker, in a fit
of "cabin fever," took to his wife
and daughters with an axe and to
himself with a shotgun.

Throughout the rest of the film
young Danny's incomplete pres
ience. the "shining" of the title,
reminds us of Nicholson's im
pending homicidal mania.
But the best evidence that
Nicholson is going to go honkers
is Nicholson himself. Hell, the
man looks like the devil. He'sgot
those funny arched eyebrows, a
hideous grin, and a hairline that
receeds at the corners of his
forehead and makes the exposed
shiny skin look like little horns.
The instant we see his face we
know that he's going to do some
thing nasty.
At this point Kubrick makes a
mistake. 1 le does not convince us


Nicholson
that Nicholson is a loving father
or even cares to be. Kubrick fails
to use the additional shock value
of a good family man turning on
his wife and child. We sense from
the beginning of the film that
Nicholson doesn't even like
them.
Okay, so we're on our guard.
We start looking for the telltale
signs of imminent fright. The
paradigm is dark creepy places.
But there are none in this film.
Kubrick has bathed every set
with day-bright florescent light
ing. The effect is devastating be
cause we don't know when to
close our eves and scream. And
the sterility of these bright sets —
everything except Nicholson is
perfectly clean — succeeds in

making us feel even more iso
lated.
Another sure-fire clue to an
upcoming fright is a corner.
When a character in a horror
movie goes around a corner, dol
lars to donuts there is going to be
something there. It could be a
ghost, an old woman with a
butcher knife, a severed head, or
anything, but it's going to be
there. Kubrick has fashioned
halls with lots of corners and has
given Danny a Big Wheel tricy
cle to ride around them.
These sequences are techni
cally perfect. We feel like we are
riding with Danny. Kubrick uses
(overuses?) a Steadicam which
allows smooth tracking shots
from the perspective of Danny's
shoulder. The sound of the tricy
cle wheels on hard floors and

carpets is magnificently repro
duced.
Although technically perfect,
these scenes move too quickly.
We've barely realized that we
are around one corner when we
turn another. The scenes are diz
zying but not frightening. We
should be given a chance to com
prehend that the last corner was
a false alarm and to lower our
defenses, only to build anticipa
tion again as we approach the
next corncr. Instead, we experi
ence an emotional overload, and
we short out. We care what will
happen next, but we lose interest
in the crucial question of when.
The scenes that really work
are Nicholson's conversations
with the demons in resi
dence. Lloyd the bartender, a
smooth, reptilian fellow, plies
Nicholson with bourbon to
catalyze the expression of
Nicholson's hostility toward his
family. Nicholson, who has had a
drinking problem, responds to
this treatment. Nicholson later
meets Grady, the spirit of the
earlier homicidal caretaker, and
they calmly discuss how to "con
trol" a family.
What makes these scenes
work is our perception of the
demons. When we first see Lloyd
and Grady we think that they are
products of Nicholson's mind.

They are his internal demons —
alcoholism and repressed hostil
ity. It is Nicholson's schizop
hrenia that fixes our attention.

When Nicholson asks Grady
"Weren't you the caretaker
who. . .?" and Grady responds
"You are the caretaker, you've
always been" we know that
Nicholson has always wanted to
hack his family to hits, but he's
managed to hold off until now.
Kubrick contradicts this pow
erful result late in the film. The
demons are no longer abstrac
tions of Nicholson's schizop
hrenia. They are independent
entities. They perform a wholly
unsatisfactory role of dens ex
maxina (actually mains ex
machina) and we are dissap
pointed to see that the hotel is
just plain haunted. When the
demons spook Duvall, we are of
fended by the cliches.
In The Shining, Kubrick is try
ing to make a statement about
evil's permanence, its timeless
ness. The Shining is filled with
ambiguities and inconsistencies
of time. We never know the time
of day and we do not sense the
passage of time. Kubrick gives us
confusing captions reading
"Thursday," "One Month La
ter," or "One A.M." They have
no point of reference and come
in no meaningful pattern. At one
point Duvall refers to an incident
that occured five months before;
Nicholson later says that it was
three years before.
But Kubrick's thesis is incom
plete and should have been
stated much more strongly.
Early in the film Danny's "shin
ing" expresses reservations
about going to the hotel. Is it be
cause the hotel contains evil or
becausc the evil dormant in
Nicholson cannot be contained
there? If Kubrick had kept the
demons the product of Nichol
son's mind instead of indepen
dent agents he would have force
fully stated not only the
tinielessness but the übiquity of
evil, and he would have made a
better horror film in the process.

catalyze the expression of
Nicholson's hostility toward his
family. Nicholson, who has had a
drinking problem, responds to
this treatment. Nicholson later
meets Grady, the spirit of the
earlier homicidal caretaker, and
they calmly discuss how to "con
trol" a family.
What makes these scenes
work is our perception of the
demons. When we first see Lloyd
and Grady we think that they are
products of Nicholson's mind.

They are his internal demons —
alcoholism and repressed hostil
ity. It is Nicholson's schizop
hrenia that fixes our attention.

When Nicholson asks Grady
"Weren't you the caretaker
who. . .?" and Grady responds
"You are the caretaker, you've
always been" we know that
Nicholson has always wanted to
hack his family to hits, but he's
managed to hold off until now.
Kubrick contradicts this pow
erful result late in the film. The
demons are no longer abstrac
tions of Nicholson's schizop
hrenia. They are independent
entities. They perform a wholly
unsatisfactory role of dens ex
maxina (actually mains ex
machina) and we are dissap
pointed to see that the hotel is
just plain haunted. When the
demons spook Duvall, we are of
fended by the cliches.
In The Shining, Kubrick is try
ing to make a statement about
evil's permanence, its timeless
ness. The Shining is filled with
ambiguities and inconsistencies
of time. We never know the time
of day and we do not sense the
passage of time. Kubrick gives us
confusing captions reading
"Thursday," "One Month La
ter," or "One A.M." They have
no point of reference and come
in no meaningful pattern. At one
point Duvall refers to an incident
that occured five months before;
Nicholson later says that it was
three years before.
But Kubrick's thesis is incom
plete and should have been
stated much more strongly.
Early in the film Danny's "shin
ing" expresses reservations
about going to the hotel. Is it be
cause the hotel contains evil or
becausc the evil dormant in
Nicholson cannot be contained
there? If Kubrick had kept the
demons the product of Nichol
son's mind instead of indepen
dent agents he would have force
fully stated not only the
tinielessness but the übiquity of
evil, and he would have made a
better horror film in the process.

Duvall

I went to see The Shining with
the highest expectations. There
is no director more technically
adept than Stanley Kubrick. Jack
Nicholson, who always overacts,
plays a part that begs tor overact
ing. Shelley Duvall, playing a de
voted though slightly catatonic
wife and mother, is also well cast.
And. of course. The Shining is a
horror movie, and I love horror
movies.
Nicholson does in fact revel in
his role of a homicidal maniac.
He lumbers around bug-eyed,
foaming at the mouth and wag
ging his tongue. Duvall starts out
a little too dizzy, but soon she
resembles a large scrawny nest
ing bird, not too imposing, but
willing to protect her young at all
costs. The remaining actors nor

tentiously underact, with the ex
ception of Scatman Crothers, the
cook, who is trapped in a point
less. disposable role.
Alas, it is Kubrick who disap
points. His unequaled facility
with the technology of filmmak
ing has distracted him from his
greater purpose. Effects are in
cluded for their own sake rather
than for their contribution to the
film as a whole. Kubrick the
scriptwriter also slips, and we
miss the cogent, tight screenplay
we expect from him.
While not a masterpiece of the
genre. The Shining is still a very
good horror film, especially
when compared with Gothic
garbage like Amityville Horror
or Prophecy.
The plot of The Shining is verv

simple. Nicholson plays a writer
offered the job of winter
caretaker of a large Colorado re
sort hotel. Hoping that this sec
lusion will allow him to write, he
accepts and brings along his wife
(Duvall) and young son Danny
(Danny Lloyd) to this snow
bound Elysium. But this is no
writer's paradise; the hotel is
haunted or perhaps just haunt
ing. Nicholson goes off the deep
end and chases his wife and child
with an axe.
A stock horror plot like this
would be. 1 thought, a perfect
vehicle for Kubrick, who can
manipulate our emotions as well
as any director. The success of
horror movies, the preference of
masochist filmgoers. is hinged
upon the director's effective toy
ing with the audience's emo
tions. The movie must make us
squirm. The best indicator of the
quality of a horror film is the in
tensity with which we desire to
be somewhere else, like in
church or maybe Candlestick
Park. The Shining does make us
squirm, but we squirm too much
and become inured to it.
The way to discomfort an au
dience is to give advance warning
of unavoidable disaster. Plenty
ot advance warning is given in
The Shining. The first few scenes
are aerial views of frigid moun
tain lakes and landscapes. The
gliding, surreal quality of these
scenes tells us that, as in all
dreams, we are alone. These

sequences almost make us
queasy and put us very ill at ease.
We are told early in the film
that a previous caretaker, in a fit
of "cabin fever," took to his wife
and daughters with an axe and to
himself with a shotgun.

Throughout the rest of the film
young Danny's incomplete pres
ience. the "shining" of the title,
reminds us of Nicholson's im
pending homicidal mania.
But the best evidence that
Nicholson is going to go honkers
is Nicholson himself. Hell, the
man looks like the devil. He'sgot
those funny arched eyebrows, a
hideous grin, and a hairline that
receeds at the corners of his
forehead and makes the exposed
shiny skin look like little horns.
The instant we see his face we
know that he's going to do some
thing nasty.
At this point Kubrick makes a
mistake. 1 le does not convince us


Nicholson
that Nicholson is a loving father
or even cares to be. Kubrick fails
to use the additional shock value
of a good family man turning on
his wife and child. We sense from
the beginning of the film that
Nicholson doesn't even like
them.
Okay, so we're on our guard.
We start looking for the telltale
signs of imminent fright. The
paradigm is dark creepy places.
But there are none in this film.
Kubrick has bathed every set
with day-bright florescent light
ing. The effect is devastating be
cause we don't know when to
close our eves and scream. And
the sterility of these bright sets —
everything except Nicholson is
perfectly clean — succeeds in

making us feel even more iso
lated.
Another sure-fire clue to an
upcoming fright is a corner.
When a character in a horror
movie goes around a corner, dol
lars to donuts there is going to be
something there. It could be a
ghost, an old woman with a
butcher knife, a severed head, or
anything, but it's going to be
there. Kubrick has fashioned
halls with lots of corners and has
given Danny a Big Wheel tricy
cle to ride around them.
These sequences are techni
cally perfect. We feel like we are
riding with Danny. Kubrick uses
(overuses?) a Steadicam which
allows smooth tracking shots
from the perspective of Danny's
shoulder. The sound of the tricy
cle wheels on hard floors and

carpets is magnificently repro
duced.
Although technically perfect,
these scenes move too quickly.
We've barely realized that we
are around one corner when we
turn another. The scenes are diz
zying but not frightening. We
should be given a chance to com
prehend that the last corner was
a false alarm and to lower our
defenses, only to build anticipa
tion again as we approach the
next corncr. Instead, we experi
ence an emotional overload, and
we short out. We care what will
happen next, but we lose interest
in the crucial question of when.
The scenes that really work
are Nicholson's conversations
with the demons in resi
dence. Lloyd the bartender, a
smooth, reptilian fellow, plies
Nicholson with bourbon to
catalyze the expression of
Nicholson's hostility toward his
family. Nicholson, who has had a
drinking problem, responds to
this treatment. Nicholson later
meets Grady, the spirit of the
earlier homicidal caretaker, and
they calmly discuss how to "con

The instant we see his face we
know that he's going to do some
thing nasty.
At this point Kubrick makes a
mistake. 1 le does not convince us


Nicholson
that Nicholson is a loving father
or even cares to be. Kubrick fails
to use the additional shock value
of a good family man turning on
his wife and child. We sense from
the beginning of the film that
Nicholson doesn't even like
them.
Okay, so we're on our guard.
We start looking for the telltale
signs of imminent fright. The
paradigm is dark creepy places.
But there are none in this film.
Kubrick has bathed every set
with day-bright florescent light
ing. The effect is devastating be
cause we don't know when to
close our eves and scream. And
the sterility of these bright sets —
everything except Nicholson is
perfectly clean — succeeds in

making us feel even more iso
lated.
Another sure-fire clue to an
upcoming fright is a corner.
When a character in a horror
movie goes around a corner, dol
lars to donuts there is going to be
something there. It could be a
ghost, an old woman with a
butcher knife, a severed head, or
anything, but it's going to be
there. Kubrick has fashioned
halls with lots of corners and has
given Danny a Big Wheel tricy
cle to ride around them.
These sequences are techni
cally perfect. We feel like we are
riding with Danny. Kubrick uses
(overuses?) a Steadicam which
allows smooth tracking shots
from the perspective of Danny's
shoulder. The sound of the tricy
cle wheels on hard floors and

carpets is magnificently repro
duced.
Although technically perfect,
these scenes move too quickly.
We've barely realized that we
are around one corner when we
turn another. The scenes are diz
zying but not frightening. We
should be given a chance to com
prehend that the last corner was
a false alarm and to lower our
defenses, only to build anticipa
tion again as we approach the
next corncr. Instead, we experi
ence an emotional overload, and
we short out. We care what will
happen next, but we lose interest
in the crucial question of when.
The scenes that really work
are Nicholson's conversations
with the demons in resi
dence. Lloyd the bartender, a
smooth, reptilian fellow, plies
Nicholson with bourbon to
catalyze the expression of
Nicholson's hostility toward his
family. Nicholson, who has had a
drinking problem, responds to
this treatment. Nicholson later
meets Grady, the spirit of the
earlier homicidal caretaker, and
they calmly discuss how to "con
trol" a family.
What makes these scenes
work is our perception of the
demons. When we first see Lloyd
and Grady we think that they are
products of Nicholson's mind.

They are his internal demons —
alcoholism and repressed hostil
ity. It is Nicholson's schizop
hrenia that fixes our attention.

When Nicholson asks Grady
"Weren't you the caretaker
who. . .?" and Grady responds
"You are the caretaker, you've
always been" we know that
Nicholson has always wanted to
hack his family to hits, but he's
managed to hold off until now.
Kubrick contradicts this pow
erful result late in the film. The
demons are no longer abstrac
tions of Nicholson's schizop
hrenia. They are independent
entities. They perform a wholly
unsatisfactory role of dens ex
maxina (actually mains ex
machina) and we are dissap
pointed to see that the hotel is
just plain haunted. When the
demons spook Duvall, we are of
fended by the cliches.
In The Shining, Kubrick is try
ing to make a statement about
evil's permanence, its timeless
ness. The Shining is filled with
ambiguities and inconsistencies
of time. We never know the time
of day and we do not sense the
passage of time. Kubrick gives us
confusing captions reading
"Thursday," "One Month La
ter," or "One A.M." They have
no point of reference and come
in no meaningful pattern. At one
point Duvall refers to an incident
that occured five months before;
Nicholson later says that it was
three years before.
But Kubrick's thesis is incom
plete and should have been
stated much more strongly.
Early in the film Danny's "shin
ing" expresses reservations
about going to the hotel. Is it be
cause the hotel contains evil or
becausc the evil dormant in
Nicholson cannot be contained
there? If Kubrick had kept the
demons the product of Nichol
son's mind instead of indepen
dent agents he would have force
fully stated not only the
tinielessness but the übiquity of
evil, and he would have made a
better horror film in the process.

Duvall

I went to see The Shining with
the highest expectations. There
is no director more technically
adept than Stanley Kubrick. Jack
Nicholson, who always overacts,
plays a part that begs tor overact
ing. Shelley Duvall, playing a de
voted though slightly catatonic
wife and mother, is also well cast.
And. of course. The Shining is a
horror movie, and I love horror
movies.
Nicholson does in fact revel in
his role of a homicidal maniac.
He lumbers around bug-eyed,
foaming at the mouth and wag
ging his tongue. Duvall starts out
a little too dizzy, but soon she
resembles a large scrawny nest
ing bird, not too imposing, but
willing to protect her young at all
costs. The remaining actors nor

tentiously underact, with the ex
ception of Scatman Crothers, the
cook, who is trapped in a point
less. disposable role.
Alas, it is Kubrick who disap
points. His unequaled facility
with the technology of filmmak
ing has distracted him from his
greater purpose. Effects are in
cluded for their own sake rather
than for their contribution to the
film as a whole. Kubrick the
scriptwriter also slips, and we
miss the cogent, tight screenplay
we expect from him.
While not a masterpiece of the
genre. The Shining is still a very
good horror film, especially
when compared with Gothic
garbage like Amityville Horror
or Prophecy.
The plot of The Shining is verv

simple. Nicholson plays a writer
offered the job of winter
caretaker of a large Colorado re
sort hotel. Hoping that this sec
lusion will allow him to write, he
accepts and brings along his wife
(Duvall) and young son Danny
(Danny Lloyd) to this snow
bound Elysium. But this is no
writer's paradise; the hotel is
haunted or perhaps just haunt
ing. Nicholson goes off the deep
end and chases his wife and child
with an axe.
A stock horror plot like this
would be. 1 thought, a perfect
vehicle for Kubrick, who can
manipulate our emotions as well
as any director. The success of
horror movies, the preference of
masochist filmgoers. is hinged
upon the director's effective toy
ing with the audience's emo
tions. The movie must make us
squirm. The best indicator of the
quality of a horror film is the in
tensity with which we desire to
be somewhere else, like in
church or maybe Candlestick
Park. The Shining does make us
squirm, but we squirm too much
and become inured to it.
The way to discomfort an au
dience is to give advance warning
of unavoidable disaster. Plenty
ot advance warning is given in
The Shining. The first few scenes
are aerial views of frigid moun
tain lakes and landscapes. The
gliding, surreal quality of these
scenes tells us that, as in all
dreams, we are alone. These

sequences almost make us
queasy and put us very ill at ease.
We are told early in the film
that a previous caretaker, in a fit
of "cabin fever," took to his wife
and daughters with an axe and to
himself with a shotgun.

Throughout the rest of the film
young Danny's incomplete pres
ience. the "shining" of the title,
reminds us of Nicholson's im
pending homicidal mania.
But the best evidence that
Nicholson is going to go honkers
is Nicholson himself. Hell, the
man looks like the devil. He'sgot
those funny arched eyebrows, a
hideous grin, and a hairline that
receeds at the corners of his
forehead and makes the exposed
shiny skin look like little horns.
The instant we see his face we
know that he's going to do some
thing nasty.
At this point Kubrick makes a
mistake. 1 le does not convince us


Nicholson
that Nicholson is a loving father
or even cares to be. Kubrick fails
to use the additional shock value
of a good family man turning on
