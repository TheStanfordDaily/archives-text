## 'Paul' doesn't matter now 
### 
McCartney II
Paul McCartney
Columbia Records
One of the most encouraging
aspects of the ensuing decade is
that Paul McCartney no longer
matters — God he thanked. The
worst thing about McCartney's
new solo album, McCartney II
(besides Linda), is that Paul
McCartney obviously thinks that
Paul McCartney matters very
much. McCartney has a minor
knack for writing chatty little
tunes, hut that is all he has, other
than pots of money.
Greedy McCartney has deli
vered a new album to the com
pany was paid his filthy four mill
ion.and no doubt laughed all the
way to the bank. McCartney II

has got to be the worst piece of
crap on the market, and it's all
the worse because the buyer
knows that McCartney is getting
away with murder.
The thing about pop music in
general is that by nature it is
meaningless. That is why it is
pop, and not some other form of
music. This is OK, though, as
long as both the artist and the
audience realize this. Most pop
artists do know this, and thus,
they set about writing music that
is "candy for the ears" — music
that sounds nice but doesn't have
any depth. McCartney is the
world's foremost expert on this
kind of music, as is demonstrated
on his previous albums, Venus
and Mars, Londontown and

Band on the Run. McCartney
seems to have forgotten his
place, and released an album
which is full of less than
mediocre pop music.
People who generally like pop
music are not going to like
McCartney II because the songs
on it are not catchy, memorable,
or even good to dance to. People
who listen to other forms of rock
music are not going to like this
album any better because the
music on it is so intensely trivial.
Paul McCartney has put out
some bad albums before, but this
time he has gone too far, because
everything about McCartney II
rings cheap. Only the single
"Coming Up" has any merit, and
its merit is that it sticks in your
head like a Datsun commercial.
This is unfortunate, because it is
an obvious ploy to get the gulli
ble public to buy the album, only
to find upon listening what an
abominable waste of money it is.
There is both a studio version
of "Coming Up" and a single live
version enclosed in the album.
The versions are virtually the
same, and McCartney was either
too cheap or too lazy to put an
extra song on the back of the en
closed single — instead he left it
blank. The other songs on the
record are mostly mindless
twaddle. McCartney does seem
to be lightly attempting to sound
"new wave," utilizing the hollow
drum rhythms that one hears
also from the Flying Lizards,
Bruce Wooley and "M." But
McCartney overuses this device,
and in fact does this whole album
in such a haphazard manner that
any new wave tendencies are un
recognizable. It sounds instead
like undanceable disco — repeti
tive, but waterv.
