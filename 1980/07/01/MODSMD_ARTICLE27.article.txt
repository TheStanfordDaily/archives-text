# Eighth jazz workshop begins Mon.
## 
### 
Jimmy Nadel, versatile jazz saxophonist
and Stanford alumnus, returns to campus
next week to lead the Stanford Jazz Work
shop for the eighth year in a row. Sponsored
by STARTS and the Tresidder Program
Board, the workshop is designed to develop a
musician's ability to express himself in the
jazz idiom. The course will meet two even
ings a week for seven weeks, and will provide
instruction in theory, criticism and playing.
Nadel divides the course into beginning
and advanced sections, letting the students
themselves decide where they belong. A
classically trained musician, for example,
might start in the beginner's section because
it emphasizes simple and familiar modal
forms — one or two chord changes or key
centers — which the student can then fill up
with notes that sound like jazz. More ad
vanced jazz players will review the simpler
forms and then go to work on the more com
plicated and sophisticated harmonic move
ments of be-bop.

Emphasizing the oral (and aural) tradition
of jazz, Nadel comments, "Only recently has
jazz education become organized. It used to
be that people listened to records or live
sessions and stole the good ideas." Thus one
improved as a jazz musician by incorporating
the techniques and ideas of one's "fav's" and
applying an original, individual angle to
them. Nadel believes that this traditional
method is still valid, and prevails upon his
students to develop their ear.
In the "lab" sessions, the students play the
tunes they have studied "at their own hearing
level. There is no need to be a beautiful tech
nician to be expressive." Nadel says these
meetings are characterized by much sharing
and feedback, and the more advanced stu
dents are often able to aid the beginners. He
deliberately gears the workshop so that many
different levels can be simultaneously
explored.
Later in the same evening, Nadel will
move to the Cofee House with an ensemble

from the class for a public jam session. This
year these performances have been switched
to Monday night so that guest artists with the
evening off will have a chance to sit in.
What does he believe to be crucial to a
jazzman's education? "Memory. A lot of
playing jazz is memorizing a pattern, and that
frees you to be creative — to do things you
never thought you could. And memory im
proves through use — both in detail and
capacity. A lot of homework goes into play
ing a good solo."
Open to all, regardless of Stanford affilia
tion, the Jazz Workshop requires only that
students know the major scales of their in
strument and be able to read music. The first
meeting is Monday, July 7, at 7 p.m. in Tre
sidder Lounge. Given the interactive theme,
the Workshop prospers with a healthy turn
out, says Nadel, and he will be happy to meet
and teach individuals who play any instru
ment and have an interest in jazz.
