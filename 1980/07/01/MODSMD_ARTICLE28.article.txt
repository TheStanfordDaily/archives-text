## Pres. Hall Jazz Band entertains all ages 
### 
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band came to Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium last Friday and Satur
day nights, and enchanted the
crowds with the delightful and
exciting time-honored magic of
New Orleans traditional jazz.
This band and its music are re
markable for their ability to
please and entertain people of
almost any age or musical taste
the audience on Friday night
looked as diverse as any I have
seen at a Lively Arts event this
year, and a fine time seemed to
be had by all.
It's no wonder, really. The
melodies and chord progressions
are lovely and familiar, the
rhythms are intoxicating (do
children have a natural affinity
for the tuba, and do they ever
grow out of it?), and the perfor
mance maintains the integrity
and sophisticiation of an original
jazz form. This is not the
watered-down "Dixieland"
music that can be heard at
mediocre restaurants and
Kiwanis picnics. Such bands are
invariably dull, sticking close to
the melodies of stage standards
and playing each song in the
same cliched manner. The real
New Orleans jazz sound is not
only fun, it is original music of
the highest quality.
The seven gentlemen who en
tertained us so well are not a re
vivalist movement or the sour
fruit of a promoter's nostalgia.
Their roots are in this music, and
they have been playing it all their

lives. The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band consists of five very elderly
(up to their late * 70s) black musi
cians, and two younger white
men who sound no less authen
tic. Although the players could
not hide their age. the music
sounded fresh and was played
with energy and joy.
The tone of the concert varied
from spirituals and ballads to
slow blues and up-tempo ver
sions of popular songs from early
in this century. The band was at
home in all of these idioms, and
they generated a feeling of relax
ation and familiarity. The sol
oists danced as they played; the
players sitting out the solos kept
time with complicated hand
movements — almost dancing
while sitting — and the trom
bonist, Frank Demond, mugged
and encouraged the audience to
clap in time. The crowd re
sponded with enthusiastic shouts
and spontaneous applause. If
anything at all detracted from
the pleasure felt by the younger
members of the audience, it was
that the band never announced
the names of the songs, leaving
us with an "oh yeah. Dad used to
hum that" recognition of the
tunes.
Although much of this music is
characterized by polyphonic im
provisation of the horns over a
steady rhythm section, there
were many fine solos. The most
consistently interesting were by
the clarinetist. Willie Humphrey,
and the banjo player, Narvin

Kimball. Humphrey's solos were
dramatic and technically de
manding, but they did not appear
formularized or forced in the
least. Kimball alternated pick
ing, playing chords and strum
ming for a unique effect. Trom
bonist Demond was especially
adept at communicating the
moods of several ballads, and
Willie Humphrey's brother
Percy played a lively trumpet
lead during the ensembles.

In addition to their instrumen
tal virtuosity, many of the band
members sing, or at least have a
blues shout. Kimball's show
piece ballad was especially
pretty, vocally as well as instru
mental ly.
Jazz critics and musicians
argue over the historical roots of
jazz and the part played by the
New Orleans sound. Many inf
luential composers of the "30s
and '40s disavowed the influence

of this wild and often poorly
played style, whereas many cri
tics claim that this music led di
rectly to contemporary forms.
The truth may never he known,
since much of early jazz was
never recorded. Yet the Preser
vation Hall Jazz Band is a kind of
living history, which listeners
may contemplate or simply
enjoy when the hand plays for
the July 4 picnic at Frost Am
phitheatre.
