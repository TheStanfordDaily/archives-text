## Police to begin Quad crackdown 
### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
Alter July 15, Stanford police
will be citing unauthorized
motor vehicles in operation or
parked within the Quad.
Under the California Vehicle
Code a motorcycle, motor
powered bicycle, or a car could
be fined up to $5 for a parking
violation and $25.50 for a mov
ing violation.
According to Captain Raoul
Nicmeyer of the Stanford Police,
a pcdali-powercd moped cannot

be cited as a motor vehicle until
the motor is turned on.
The only vehicles cleared to
operate in the Quad (besides
bikes) arc: emergency. Univer
sity, and authorized commercial
service trucks or those driven by
electric gate key holders.
All accesses to the Quad have
been posted and printed permits
will be required by anyone enter
ing with a motor-driven vehicle.
Before notification of this
crackdown, police had given
warnings or had personally es

cortcd violators out of the Quad.
Now concern for bicycle safety
and complaints against mopeds
have prompted this new safety
action.
Niemeyer said that students
and faculty will he re-notified of
these violations before fall quar
ter 1 980.1 Ic gives no estimate of
the number of people now enter
ing the Quad illegally and is not
sure whether electric carts driven
by handicapped students will be
given permits or designated
parking areas.
