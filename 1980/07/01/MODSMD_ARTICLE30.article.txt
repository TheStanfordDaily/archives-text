Israeli troops raid base
JERL'SAL.HM — Israeli paratroopers
early yesterday staged what Israeli Chief of
Staff Raphael Eitan termed "the biggest
and most sophisticated" raid into Lebanon
in 18 months, blowing up five buildings at a
Palestinian base 19 miles north of the Israeli
border.
Eitan said that Israeli troops killed " 10 to
20 terrorists" of the Arab Liberation Front,
an Iraqi-based group that claimed responsi
bility for the April attack on Misgav Am
Kibbutz in which three Israelis died.
The state-owned Beirut radio said that 11
persons were killed by the Israelis, including
two women and four children who were in a
house that was blown up.
Eitan, in a Tel Aviv press conference,
denied the report. "We changed our origi
nal plans and avoided attacking one build
ing because we were in doubt whether civi
lians were in it,"he said.
The Palestinian base is north of the Kas
miyeh Bridge over the Litani River, and
about a mile inland from the sea. Eitan gave
no details of how the Israelis got to the
Palestinian facility, but Beirut sources said
that the Israelis came ashore in rubber boats
and also landed by helicopter, and that Is
raeli naval craft provided covering fire as
the raiders withdrew.
Economic index rebounds
WASHINGTON — A key government
gauge of the nation's economic health re
bounded sharply in May from April's record
drop, while top private economists said yes
terday the nation's very steep plunge into
recession may be slowing.
The government's Index of Leading Indi

cators — released yesterday — declined 2.4
percent last month, with increased layoffs in
manufacturing industries accounting for
one-third of the drop.
But that is significantly less than April's
revised 4.1 percent falloff, the Commerce
Department reported.
May's decline was the seventh in the last
eight months and continues a downward
trend that began in September 1978. Tradi
tionally, three consecutive monthly declines
in the index constitutes a recession.
However, three private forecasters inter
viewed yesterday said the index's rebound
in May offers a bit more evidence that the
most rapid monthly declines in the troubled
economy may be over, although they
cautioned that the recession will persist for
four to six months before reaching a low
point, with unemployment — a lagging
measure of economic activity — sure to rise
some more.
Shah undergoes surgery
CAIRO, Egypt — The exiled shah ot
Iran underwent surgery yesterday to drain
his lungs of accumulated fluids, a complica
tion of pneumonia. One of his doctors said
the former monarch was in satisfactory con
dition. "His chances are more than 75 per
cent," said Dr. Abdel Kader Osman, one of
the three surgeons who performed the op
eration.
The doctor said he did not know when the
one-time Iranian monarch would be able to
resume the temporarily suspended
chemotherapy treatments that are believed
critical to halting the spread of his lymphatic
cancer. Medical sources independent of the
shah's case say his condition is a common
effect of the chemotherapy.

Family could save hostage
An investigator of the Iranian Justice
Ministry called on the parents of an Ameri
can hostage yesterday to travel to Iran to
seek "forgiveness" for their son's alleged
sexual misbehavior. Otherwise the captive
Marine may go on trial, he said.
The hostage. Sgt. Michael Moeller, 2N, is
accused of having had sexual relations last
fall with a young Iranian woman, who later
was hanged by her brother because he be
lieved her pregnancy disgraced their family.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman George Havens indicated an
exemption from President Jimmy Carter's
Iran-travel ban would be considered for a
trip to Iran by the Moellers. The State De
partment reiterated its opposition to any
trials of the hostages, who are supposed to
have diplomatic immunity.
In another development yesterday, the
Iranian government ordered the expulsion
of a Soviet diplomat from Tehran for al
legedly exchanging "intelligence docu
ments" with a foreigner.
Pope speaks out in Brazil
BRASILIA, Brazil — Pope John Paul II
came to Brazil yesterday on what he called
"a pastoral and religious mission" and lost
no time in stressing his traditionalist posi
tion in a dispute between the church and the
military-backed regime of the world's
largest Roman Catholic country.
The pope "paid tribute" to Brazil's
bishops in a speech at Brasilia's military air
base. But he warned half a million people in
an afternoon open-air Mass that the
church's mission cannot be reduced "just to
socio-political matters."

Major cities face strikes
Midnight strike deadlines were posted
yesterday by employees of the nation's
major copper producers and by municipal
workers in Detroit, while New York City's
firemen hollered unanimous approval of a
walkout set for later in the week.
In addition, garbage collectors in New
Haven, Conn., walked out to protest a work
cutback, and doctors remained on strike
against a Boston hospital, although a
nurses' strike there was averted.
An estimated 39,000 copper workers
prepared for a strike after negotiations bet
ween 26 unions and seven companies broke
down over a cost-of-living dispute. The
copper unions have struck for every pact
since the mid-19605. The contracts covered
workers in Arizona, Washington, Utah,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas. Maryland and
New Jersey.

Economic index rebounds
WASHINGTON — A key government
gauge of the nation's economic health re
bounded sharply in May from April's record
drop, while top private economists said yes
terday the nation's very steep plunge into
recession may be slowing.
The government's Index of Leading Indi

cators — released yesterday — declined 2.4
percent last month, with increased layoffs in
manufacturing industries accounting for
one-third of the drop.
But that is significantly less than April's
revised 4.1 percent falloff, the Commerce
Department reported.
May's decline was the seventh in the last
eight months and continues a downward
trend that began in September 1978. Tradi
tionally, three consecutive monthly declines
in the index constitutes a recession.
However, three private forecasters inter
viewed yesterday said the index's rebound
in May offers a bit more evidence that the
most rapid monthly declines in the troubled
economy may be over, although they
cautioned that the recession will persist for
four to six months before reaching a low
point, with unemployment — a lagging
measure of economic activity — sure to rise
some more.
Shah undergoes surgery
CAIRO, Egypt — The exiled shah ot
Iran underwent surgery yesterday to drain
his lungs of accumulated fluids, a complica
tion of pneumonia. One of his doctors said
the former monarch was in satisfactory con
dition. "His chances are more than 75 per
cent," said Dr. Abdel Kader Osman, one of
the three surgeons who performed the op
eration.
The doctor said he did not know when the
one-time Iranian monarch would be able to
resume the temporarily suspended
chemotherapy treatments that are believed
critical to halting the spread of his lymphatic
cancer. Medical sources independent of the
shah's case say his condition is a common
effect of the chemotherapy.

Family could save hostage
An investigator of the Iranian Justice
Ministry called on the parents of an Ameri
can hostage yesterday to travel to Iran to
seek "forgiveness" for their son's alleged
sexual misbehavior. Otherwise the captive
Marine may go on trial, he said.
The hostage. Sgt. Michael Moeller, 2N, is
accused of having had sexual relations last
fall with a young Iranian woman, who later
was hanged by her brother because he be
lieved her pregnancy disgraced their family.
In Washington, State Department
spokesman George Havens indicated an
exemption from President Jimmy Carter's
Iran-travel ban would be considered for a
trip to Iran by the Moellers. The State De
partment reiterated its opposition to any
trials of the hostages, who are supposed to
have diplomatic immunity.
In another development yesterday, the
Iranian government ordered the expulsion
of a Soviet diplomat from Tehran for al
legedly exchanging "intelligence docu
ments" with a foreigner.
Pope speaks out in Brazil
BRASILIA, Brazil — Pope John Paul II
came to Brazil yesterday on what he called
"a pastoral and religious mission" and lost
no time in stressing his traditionalist posi
tion in a dispute between the church and the
military-backed regime of the world's
largest Roman Catholic country.
The pope "paid tribute" to Brazil's
bishops in a speech at Brasilia's military air
base. But he warned half a million people in
an afternoon open-air Mass that the
church's mission cannot be reduced "just to
socio-political matters."

Major cities face strikes
Midnight strike deadlines were posted
yesterday by employees of the nation's
major copper producers and by municipal

firemen hollered unanimous approval of a
walkout set for later in the week.
In addition, garbage collectors in New
Haven, Conn., walked out to protest a work
cutback, and doctors remained on strike
against a Boston hospital, although a
nurses' strike there was averted.
An estimated 39,000 copper workers
prepared for a strike after negotiations bet
ween 26 unions and seven companies broke
down over a cost-of-living dispute. The
copper unions have struck for every pact
since the mid-19605. The contracts covered
workers in Arizona, Washington, Utah,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas. Maryland and
New Jersey.

Israeli troops raid base
JERL'SAL.HM — Israeli paratroopers
early yesterday staged what Israeli Chief of
Staff Raphael Eitan termed "the biggest
and most sophisticated" raid into Lebanon
in 18 months, blowing up five buildings at a
Palestinian base 19 miles north of the Israeli
border.
Eitan said that Israeli troops killed " 10 to
20 terrorists" of the Arab Liberation Front,
an Iraqi-based group that claimed responsi
bility for the April attack on Misgav Am
Kibbutz in which three Israelis died.
The state-owned Beirut radio said that 11
persons were killed by the Israelis, including
two women and four children who were in a
house that was blown up.
Eitan, in a Tel Aviv press conference,
denied the report. "We changed our origi
nal plans and avoided attacking one build
ing because we were in doubt whether civi
lians were in it,"he said.
The Palestinian base is north of the Kas
miyeh Bridge over the Litani River, and
about a mile inland from the sea. Eitan gave
no details of how the Israelis got to the
Palestinian facility, but Beirut sources said
that the Israelis came ashore in rubber boats
and also landed by helicopter, and that Is
raeli naval craft provided covering fire as
