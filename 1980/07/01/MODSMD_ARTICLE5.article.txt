# President will dine at Portola Valley home
## SAC plans protest for Carter 
### Simon Labov Staff Writer 
The final approval of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's draft regist
ration plan has spurred an in
crease in anti-draft organizing on
campus and Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) has been
busy trying to show the president
that they are among many
people whodo not think registra
tion is a good idea.
SAC's immediate plan is to
march to a $500 a plate fundrais
ing dinner that Carter will be ad
dressing on Thursday evening.
The dinner is at the home of Wal
ter Shorenstein on Westridge
Road in Portola Valley. Shorens
tein is an executive of the Trans
america Corporation.
Registration for men born in
1960 and 1961 is scheduled to
begin later this month. The
American Civil Liberties Union
plans to block it in court, charg
ing that registration of men, and
not women, is discrimination
against men and therefore un
constitutional.
SAC member David Setzer
said that SAC wants to take this
opportunity of Carter's visit "to
express our dissent from Presi
dent Carter's draft registration
plan." Setzer said that he feels
the most effective way to stop the

draft — which he says is clearly
the next step — is to have poor
turnout for registration.
"We cannot suggest that
people break the law," he said,
"but (registering) is not just a
simple act. People should realize
all the consequences of what

they are doing."
The maximum penalty for re
fusing to register is five years in
jail and a $ 1 ().()()() line.
One SAC member pointed out
that only 2 or 3 percent of the
people required to register is
equal to the total capacity of the
federal prison system.
Boh Thawley, another SAC
member, expressed frustration
because of the difficulties im
posed by the registration taking
place during the summer. "It
seems less than coincidental that
Carter's registration is happen
ing in the summer when cam
puses and high schools are vac
ant and contacts are broken mak
ing it incredibly hard to organize
resistance," Thawley said.
He also added that "a lot of
kids are living at home and some
are under intense pressure from
their parents to register."
One of the ideas for Thurs
day's march was to invite Carter
to dessert after the dinner.
Cherry pie would be served
while people discussed their
opinions with the president. No
reply to the invitation has been
received.
