# Cluster blacked out
## 
### Peter Steinerman Staff Writer 
Electricity to buildings on the
southeast side of campus was dis
rupted late Thursday evening
due to a faulty cable, according
to Jerry Ostrander, associate di
rector of facilities. Service re
sumed Friday morning when
work crews were able to reroute
power to the blacked-out areas.
Ostrander identified the af
fected buildings as the Cowell
Cluster, Wilbur Hall, Meyer Lib
rary, Crothers Memorial Hall
and Engineering Row. Ostran
der added that power to Cowell
Student Health Center was not
curtailed.
Ostrander said that a "fault to
the ground" in one of the under
ground cables was determined to
have been responsible for the
blackout. He commented that
such occurences happen from

time to time, and that they are
purely random. The University's
"looped" electrical system al
lows power to he rerouted
around the faulty cable.
Ostrander said the cable was
in the process of being replaced,
and that the new wiring will have
better insulation.
Superintendent of Utility Dis
tribution Systems Bob Mcknight
said that power to the Cowell
area went out at about 11:25
p.m. He added that while the
damaged cable had been isolated
by 3:30 a.m.. it was determined
that it would be "much safer" to
wait for the arrival of reserve
crews in the daytime before
finalizing repairs. McKnight es
timated that power to Wilbur
Hall, the building most severely
disrupted by the power failure,
was restored at 9:30 a.m.
In addition to the extra safety
factor. McKnight said that he de
cided to wait to complete repairs
because no research facilities or
the student health center had
been affected. He added that
since all cables were effectively
"buried" in concrete ducts, no
lives were endangered by the de
fective cable.
A spot check of buildings in
the Cowell Cluster area revealed
that no serious ill-effects were
suffered due to the brief power
outage. Patrick Longmire, resi
dent of Terra House, reported
that students there turned the
situation to their advantage.
"Things around here got pretty
mellow," he said. "People sat
around outside. Alter a while,
we all went upstairs to sleep."
