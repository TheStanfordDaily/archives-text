last year, suffered an attack in a
different part of his heart yester

the Israeli Knesset (parliament)
in which his government staved
off an attempt that could have
brought it down.
Begin's doctor. Mervyn Got
tesman, said after tests late
Monday that Begin had sus
tained a "small myocardial in
farction that could have been
caused by severe stress. An in
farction is a narrowing of the ar
teries of the heart."
Begin was stricken as a vote
was nearing on an opposition
move to dissolve the parliament
and call for new elections. His
government survived by a nar
row six-vote margin in the 120-
seat Knesset.
Friends said that the challenge
of yesterday's vote had filled
Begin with high spirits. Sunday
night he had danced traditional
Hassidic dances for half an hour
at a bar mitzvah celebration for a
Knesset member's son.
But Monday afternoon in the
Knesset, as Deputy Prime Minis

how long Begin would be hos

fatal heart attack in March 1977,
two months before his election,
and then suffered a mild stroke
that cost him about 20 percent of
his vision last summer. He had

exhaustion and complications
from the earlier heart attack.
