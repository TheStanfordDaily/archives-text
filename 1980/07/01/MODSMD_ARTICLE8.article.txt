# Schmidt, Brezhnev talk in Kremlin
## 
### Kevin Klose The Washington Post 
MOSCOW — West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
strongly appealed to Leonid
Brezhnev last night to pull all
Soviet troops out of Afghanistan
to end "this dangerous crisis"
and also asked the Kremlin to
begin talks without precondi
tions on limiting nuclear
weapons in Europe.
But in earlier talks at the
Kremlin Brezhnev apparently
showed little inclination to move
from the Soviet position on Af
ghanistan.
Brezhnev, 73-year-old Com
munist Party general secretary,
told Schmidt that a political set
tlement could be reached on the
basis of the May 14 proposals of
the Marxist Kabul regime, which
call for recognition of the Babrak
Karmal government by Iran and
Pakistan.
The meeting here, the first in
Moscow between Brezhnev and
a Western leader since the Dec.
27 Soviet invasion, began yes
terday accompanied by con
tinued Western disagreement
over a united response to the Af
ghan crisis. There also was
American nervousness over
Schmidt's intentions on the
NATO decision to base new
medium-range nuclear-tipped
missiles in Western Europe to
counter a continued Soviet buil

dup.
But Schmidt in his toast at the
fortified historic citadel in the
center of this capital bluntly de
clared that the Soviets had
gained military advantage over
the West by deploying a new
generation of medium-range
nuclear missiles in Central
Europe, forcing NATO to
counter. NATO agreed last De
cember on an American plan to
site 572 advanced Pershing and
cruise missiles in Western
Europe, beginning at the end of
1983 when the weapons arc
ready.
Schmidt and President Jimmy
Carter have had uneasy relations
in recent months over the chan
cellor's suggestion for a freeze on
their deployment pending talks
with the Russians. In his toast
Schmidt noted that the NATO
decision included an offer to
Moscow to negotiate limits on
the new arms.
Washington expects tlu Krem
lin to press Schmidt hard on the
nuclear-forces questiuon in its
attempts to stall the NATO deci
sion.
On Afghanistan, Schmidt said
the West and most of the world
community supported calls early
in the year by the United Nations
and the Islamic Conference for
the Soviets to withdraw.
The Soviets announced June
22 they were pulling a division

and 108 tanks out of Afghanis
tan. Western military analysts
believe the personnel would
total about 8000 to 10,000
troops. Moscow has never dis
closed how many troops it has in
the country to secure the Marxist
Babrak regime, but Western
analysts estimate it to be about
85,000.
There are reliable reports
from Kabul that the Russians are
altering the composition of
their forces, reducing the ar
mored elements and adding
helicopters and other forces
more suited to the kind of guer
rilla warfare that has developed
in the rugged, mountainous
country between the Russians
and Moslem tribesmen who have
declared a holy war against the
invaders.
The Germans consider
Schmidt's stay in Moscow a
"working visit," his first since his
last meeting here with Brezhnev
in 1974, and the Soviets are try
ing to lay on the full panoply as
sociated with a state visit.
Thus, Brezhnev himself met
the chancellor at the VIP airport.
Vnokovo-Tno, when he might
normally have expected to be
greeted by Premier Alexei
Kosygin. The Kremlin wants to
show the world, on the eve of the
Olympics, that Afghanistan has
not interrupted normal relations
with the West.

told Schmidt that a political set
tlement could be reached on the
basis of the May 14 proposals of
the Marxist Kabul regime, which
call for recognition of the Babrak
Karmal government by Iran and
Pakistan.
The meeting here, the first in
Moscow between Brezhnev and
a Western leader since the Dec.
27 Soviet invasion, began yes
terday accompanied by con
tinued Western disagreement
over a united response to the Af
ghan crisis. There also was
American nervousness over
Schmidt's intentions on the
NATO decision to base new
medium-range nuclear-tipped
missiles in Western Europe to
counter a continued Soviet buil

dup.
But Schmidt in his toast at the
fortified historic citadel in the
center of this capital bluntly de
clared that the Soviets had
gained military advantage over
the West by deploying a new
generation of medium-range
nuclear missiles in Central
Europe, forcing NATO to
counter. NATO agreed last De
cember on an American plan to
site 572 advanced Pershing and
cruise missiles in Western
Europe, beginning at the end of
1983 when the weapons arc
ready.
Schmidt and President Jimmy
Carter have had uneasy relations
in recent months over the chan
cellor's suggestion for a freeze on
their deployment pending talks
with the Russians. In his toast
Schmidt noted that the NATO
decision included an offer to
Moscow to negotiate limits on
the new arms.
Washington expects tlu Krem
lin to press Schmidt hard on the
nuclear-forces questiuon in its
attempts to stall the NATO deci
sion.
On Afghanistan, Schmidt said
the West and most of the world
community supported calls early
in the year by the United Nations
and the Islamic Conference for
the Soviets to withdraw.
The Soviets announced June
22 they were pulling a division

and 108 tanks out of Afghanis
tan. Western military analysts
believe the personnel would
total about 8000 to 10,000
troops. Moscow has never dis
closed how many troops it has in
the country to secure the Marxist
Babrak regime, but Western
analysts estimate it to be about
85,000.
There are reliable reports
from Kabul that the Russians are
altering the composition of
their forces, reducing the ar
mored elements and adding
helicopters and other forces
more suited to the kind of guer
rilla warfare that has developed
in the rugged, mountainous
country between the Russians
and Moslem tribesmen who have
declared a holy war against the
invaders.
The Germans consider
Schmidt's stay in Moscow a
"working visit," his first since his
last meeting here with Brezhnev
in 1974, and the Soviets are try
ing to lay on the full panoply as
sociated with a state visit.
Thus, Brezhnev himself met
the chancellor at the VIP airport.
Vnokovo-Tno, when he might
normally have expected to be
greeted by Premier Alexei
Kosygin. The Kremlin wants to
show the world, on the eve of the
Olympics, that Afghanistan has
not interrupted normal relations
with the West.
