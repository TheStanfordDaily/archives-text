# GOP convention debates ERA

### R. Gregory Nokes The Associated Press 
DETROIT — The Republi
can party's fervent quest for con
vention unity was seriously im
periled yesterday by growing
disagreement over whether the
GOP should maintain its 40-year
support for the Equal Rights
Amendment for women.
Michigan Gov. William Milli
ken told the party's platform
committee that failure to support
the ERA now "would be a clear
statement to people across this
country that we are retreating
from our traditional support of
equality for women."
Ronald Reagan, who is certain
to be nominated as the party's
presidential candidate at the full
convention next week, opposes
the amendment, even though it
has been endorsed by Republi
can platforms dating back to
1940. Reagan aides say he would
probably accept a pro-ERA
plank in the platform if that is the
convention's wish.
Milliken said the party could
lose large numbers of votes if it
fails to specifically endorse the
amendment in its 1980 platform,
as it did in 1976.
"If we repudiate our 1976 pos
ition, then we will be repudiated
by a large segment of America's
population — and deservedly
so," he said in his welcoming ad
dress to the platform committee.
A group of three prominent Re
publican women, including a
former GOP national chairman,
made much the same point in a
separate news conference.

The GOP platform committee
is drafting the party's 1980 plat
form this week for presentation
to the full convention next week.
Except for yesterday's opening
session, most of the remaining
deliberations will be secret.
Party officials want to avoid
open disagreements that would
threaten the image of a unified
Republican party that will rally
behind Reagan in the fall am
paign.

The disagreement over an
EiRA plank was virtually the
only dispute that had surfaced in
platform delibertions. The draft,
which was prepared hy party
leaders and Reagan representa
tives, supports increased defense
spending and the proposed
Kemp-Roth three-year tax cut
plan.
It supports a constitutional
amendment to prohibit abor
tions and opposes a peace-time
military draft.
