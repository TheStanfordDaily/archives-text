WASHINGTON — Key ad
visors to Ronald Reagan believe
the United States must challenge
the Soviet Union to an acceler
ated nuclear arms race before
the two countries can achieve
adequate arms control.
Only if the Soviets are con
vinced that the United States will
modernize and expand its nuc
lear forces will they make sig
nificant concessions, the Reagan
men said in recent interviews.
If Reagan, the Republican

near-nominee, is elected in
November, these advisors — all
veterans of past strategic arms
negotiations — said they would
advise that he:
— Abandon SALT 11, the
controversial arms treaty signed
in 1979 by President Jimmy Car
ter and his Moscow counter
parts. The treaty has not yet been
ratified by the U.S. Senate.
— Embark immediately on a
costly program to protect U.S.
missiles and improve their capa
bility to light a limited nuclear
war.
— Take a tough negotiating
stance to force the Soviets to ac
cept more favorable SALT
terms, but be patient if they do
not immediately make conces
sions.
Reagan, who has no direct ex
perience in strategic affairs, thus
far has reflected the thinking of
three strategic experts among his
10 top foreign policy advisers:
retired Gen. Edward Rohny,
Fred Ikle and William Van
Cleave.
"If we put them on notice that
we'll go up. then there's a chance
that they'll come down." savs

Rohny. who represented the
Joint Chiefs of Staff during the
SALT 11 negotiations and who
then retired rather than support
the treaty approved by Carter.
Van Cleave, a professor at the
University of Southern Califor
nia who worked briefly on SALT
I before resigning from govern
ment, is an apostle of "quick
fixes" for the U.S. missile and
bomber force. He believes those
forces are vulnerable to destruc
tion in a Soviet sneak attack and
must be upgraded well before
weapons like the new MX missile
can be deployed in the late
1980s.
He advocates immediately
starting to dig new underground
silos for the Minuteman 111 mil
liles, then shuttling them secretly
from hole to hole to confuse
Soviet targeters. The administra
tion rejected that idea because of
fears that it would violate SALT
provisions designed to insure
that each side can check the
number of launchers deployed
by the other.
Van Cleave also supports a
crash program to outfit the aging
B-52 bomber with cruise mis
siles, in greater numbers than the
administration proposes.
