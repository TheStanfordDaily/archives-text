## Registration intolerable 
### 
The United States enters the
'SOs with a troubled economy, a
precarious dependence on
dwindling oil reserves and an in
ternational standing at a 40-year
low. In response to the latest
round of foreign crises our presi
dent has called for registration of
19- and 20-year-old men to begin
later this month. The step is bil
led by its supporters as neces
sary. as a show of American
strength and unity. But we disag
ree. We see registration as a sign
of weakness, as an inappropriate
solution to our diplomatic trou
bles. both ineffective abroad and
damaging at home.
Mandatory registration is not
in keeping with the American
ideals of individual freedom and
privacy. This much is obvious.
We do. however, realize that this
is not an absolute ideal, that
there are times when it is a citi
zen's duty to serve his or her
country . We realize that we must
often sacrifice some freedoms to
preserve others and that there
may be nothing intrinsically
wrong with a republic calling its
young men to register for possi
ble military service. But we also
believe that such invasions of in
dividual liberty must not be
taken lightly nor be allowed for
any thing but the most vital goals.
We believe the president's re
gistration plan is not warranted
hy the nation's present difficul
ties nor do we think it will ease
any of the nation's troubles.
The United States is currently
faced with an array of foreign
policy problems. Among them
are our failure to force Soviet
troops to leave Afghanistan, our
critical dependence on crude oil
from a region where one of t he
largest states is our self
proclaimed enemy, and the lack
of cohesion and direction in the
Western Alliance, which seems
\ulnerable to Soviet diplomatic
thrusts seeking to weaken it.
The president's registration
plan seeks to face these prob
lems. We feel it will not face
them well.
Registered individuals will

have no more combat training
than un-registered ones, and. ac
cording to the Selective Service
System, the plan will only de
crease the time needed to
mobilize by seven days. Thus,
registration will do little to in
crease America's ability to send
a large army into battle in the
frightful event that we should
ever need to do so. Untrained
19-year-olds will also do nothing
to increase our small-scale inter
vention capabilities. Put simply,
registration will not make our
commandos' helicopters work
any better.
What will registration do for
our influence in the Mid-East or
for the strength of NATO?
Probably little. Registration is
not likely to impress the Iranians
or make the United States seem
more reliable to the Saudis. It is
not likely to give our alliance the
sense of unity and purpose it so
badly needs. In short, registra
tion is a poor substitute for
statesmanship.
The registration bill itself is
being challenged in court be
cause it does not include women.
We support this challenge. In the
unfortunate occurrence of a
peacetime registration, we feel
that men and women should be
treated equally. Whether women
are used as combat troops or sol
ely in positions behind-the-lines,
they can make no less a contribu
tion to the safety of this country
than their male counterparts.
Similarly, we agree with Con
gress' removal of the exemption
for those attending colleges or
universities. Such an exemption
places an economic and racial in
equality in the system that de
termines who shall risk their lives
for their country.
We fear that registration is one
more invasion of the individual
liberties of Americans. We fear
that without good cause, such in
vasions are a dangerous prece
dent. We hope that the president
has other than pure political mo
tives forcallingforregistration in
this election year, but we have
our doubts.
