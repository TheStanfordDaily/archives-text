## Nine steps to balance the budget 
### 
In the wiley ways of
Washington there are many ways
to skin the proverbial taxpaying
cat. The latest method calls for
rhetoric as sharp as a scalpel and
lots of guile. It's called "Balanc
ing the Budget"and is played by
congressmen and the President.
"Balancing the Budget" can
be played in several ways. For
instance, government expendi
tures can be lowered to match
incoming revenue. Unfortu
nately this version of the game
leaves government employees
with precious little to do.
Instead this is how "Balancing
the Budget" is being played in
Washington this year:
1. Don't cut spending. In
crease it.
2. Since "Balancing the

Budget" is more important in the
election season than later in the
year, overestimate revenues.
You can always spend more la
ter. Last year more than 40 bill
ion additional dollars were ap
proved and spent after the origi
nal budget was approved.
It the economy is in recession
don't let that change your re
venue and spending projections.
There's nothing to be gained by
assuming the worst.
3. Raise social security taxes.
4. Raise all taxes. Push
everyone into a higher tax brac
ket by inflating incomes 15 per
cent per year. Of course
everyone will have to take a cut
in their standard of living since
inflation will far exceed real in
creases in productivity, but at
least the budget will balance.
5. Assess the largest tax in his
tory on energy consumers. Don't
call it a revenue measure though,
even if its primary purpose is to
raise revenue. Call it a "Windfall
Profits Tax" and tell people it is a
tax on Big Oil. Tell people it will
keep those nasty oil companies
from operating department
stores and condominium pro
jects and other things equally
harmful to the U.S. economy.
Forget to mention that it was
government regulations and tax
policies that made-it less profita
ble to reinvest all that capital into
more energy projects.
Tell them that the government
will use the money to fund
energy research and public

transit even though only a small
part of it will be spent for that
purpose. Use most of the money
to maintain massive income
transfer programs.
7. Add a pleasant little sur
prise like a surplus in the budget.
Most people will probably not
remember what a surplus is but it
should impress the older voters
that do anyway. But make it a
small surplus â€” say 500 million
dollars. A large surplus implies
fiscal irresponsibility and leads
to nuts like Howard Jarvis crawl
ing out of the woodwork trying
to give the surplus back to the
taxpayers.
N. Improve the financial ap
pearance of the federal balance
sheet by using accounting proce
dures that would land a
businessman in jail. Keep over
two trillion dollars in unfunded
and contingent liabilities out of
the budget statement where it
might give people the wrong idea
about the state of the federal
government's financial health.
y. Tell the voters that you are
getting tough. This is no ordinary
bloated, record 613 billion dollar
budget. It is a lean and austere, a
sign of the discipline of the New
Age.
Yes, the Balanced Budget is a
wonderful thing. Sometimes
though I think we might be bet
ter off with a smaller one.
