## Society stereotypes individuals

Do you worry about being
labeled? I do. You see, there are
these people around that are
great at categorizing other
people. I'm sure you've seen
them; they all kind of dress,
speak and act alike. These
people, they'll watch you for a
while and then they'll say to
themselves, "Ah hah, I know
what kind of person he is."
They've got you in a nutshell be
fore you can yell Sather Gate.
I felt that I had to change their
opinion of me.
One way is to never act in the
same manner twice. This method
will work for a while, but one
soon runs out of possible ways to
behave. It got to the point with
me where I would do things like
trying to tie my shoes while
standing on my head.
Spontaneity became difficult.

Others tended to get impatient
as I tried to figure out weird ways
to react to situations. I ended up
confusing myself as much as I did
anyone else. Consistency, I de
cided. is necessary in order to
avoid permanent multiple
schizophrenia.
I took a look at the people
whom I was trying to escape. I
thought about trying to be like
them; everybody seemed to like
them. Maybe they'd leave me
alone if I were one of them. No
way. I wasn't about to wear sail
ing shoes if I didn't know how to
sail and I couldn't picture myself
constantly uttering phrases like
"bummed" and "keyed."
I reluctantly decided that the
only way to remain unique and to
keep what little self respect I had
left was to take an objective look
at myself and to decide on a life
style according to my own values,
goals and beliefs. This is a rather
rigorous process of self
examination and would be far
too difficult and time consuming
to seriously recommend were it
not for a remarkable new device
developed in a combined effort
by the weight lifters at Encina
gym and the boys at LOTS.
This miraculous innovation is
guaranteed to give you an iden
tity that you can live with. It con
sists of a specially adapted
63-way mirror and some tiny
electrodes that link a computer
to the subject's head. The
creators claim that, standing in
front of the mirror, one can see
one's whole "self," and from en
tirely new perspectives!
Meanwhile, those little elec
trodes record and register one's
reactions through brain im

pulses. A printout of the sub
ject's (or victim's) values and
goals is available within 6.4 mi
nutes. Beliefs, they say, are easy
once you know your values and
goals.
What a coincidence, this was
just what I was looking for. I was
overjoyed to find that all of my
problems could be solved for me
so quickly and effortlessly. 1
wasted little time in trying this
fantastic invention.
After my forehead was cere
moniously cleaned, the elec
trodes were administered. Next 1
was lead to the right place to
stand in front of the oracle. Then
1 stood and looked at myself in
the specially contorted 63-way
mirror. I could see myself all
over the place. In some places 1
was whole and in some places I
was in little parts. 1 laughed a lot.
When I was given my printout,
I was pleased to find that my val
ues include money, power,
beautiful women and big cars (it
could have been worse). My
goals are a high paying job (in
any field), a Mercedes or at least
a Cadillac, and a good name in
my community (the place where
1 earn my high salary).
As promised, beliefs were now
easily discovered. I'll have God
and morality when they can help,
church every Sunday, and a firm
belief in America as the land of
opportunity.
It's such a relief to be a self
determined individual. Now I
can pursue my goals without
worry.
