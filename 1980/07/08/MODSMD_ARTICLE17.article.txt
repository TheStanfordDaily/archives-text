## concerts /shelly stevenson MOR night at Maples proves to be pleasing 
### 
It can't be easy to live with the
stigma of being a wildly success
ful Top-40 band. The Little
River Band, who brought a tight,
well-crafted show to Stanford's
Maples Pavillion Thursday
night, are definitely a group of
musicians who have not been
paid their proper due.
Not that middle-of-the-road
isn't a grey area ot the popular
music scene. Borrowing on mus
ical styles ranging from the Byrds
to the Bee Gees, it is a mottled
and apologetic genre otten unin
spired and dull. It needn t be
bland, though it often is. Beware,
an example is close at hand.
Firefall
Firefall opened the evening's
festivities on the impressive
ASSU Special Events-sponsored
double bill. The band, a MOR,
country-oriented group, has had
a string of perfectly acceptable
AM hits. Firefall could have
been good in concert. Instead
they settled for being adequate.
Kicking off its summer tour,
Firefall played several numbers
from Undertow, the band's latest
Ip. These included "Headed For
A Fall" and "Business Is Busi
ness." Firefall hit tunes like "Just
Remember I Love You" and
"Strange Way" did manage to
spark a responsive note from the
large audience.
Energy shortage
By and large though; these,
and lesser known numbers like
"Mexico" and "Sweet And
Sour" came off just a little flat
and occasionally off key. Nor did
band members expend much
musical or physical energy to
offset the missing polish present
on their albums. Enough said.
The Little River Band, on the
other hand, really delivers. The
seasoned Australian band gave
its audience more than mere
muzak. Their rolling, rhythmic
rock 'n' roll numbers were well
timed and well-executed. The
band also projects an energetic

and engaging stage presence.
Unlike Firefall, l ittle River
band members looked like they
were enjoying themselves. They
are pros.
Handful of hits
Boasting multiple hits over the
years, the band performed
"Help Is On The Way," "Happy
Anniversary" and "It's A Long
Way There." Other songs in
cluded "Mistress Ol Mine,"
"Man On The Run"and "Cool
Change" from the First Under
The Wire lp. "Red Shoes" and
"Don't Let The Needle Win"
came from the groups' most re
cent effort. Backstage Bass.
Special mention should be
given to lead singer Glen Shor
rock. I le has a pleasant voice and
he is a good showman. Beeb Bir
tles. Little River electric and
acoustical guitar player, added
several lead vocals and an in
gratiating smile to the perfor
mance. The band also features
an array of competent, even bass
and guitar players as well as an
additional keyboards player who
added sweet, rich tones to the
music. The vocals and harmonies
were generally as well meshed as
the band's melody lines. Little
River members also pen rela
tively intelligent lyrics though
they occasionally indulge in
mawkishly sentimental numbers
like "Lonesome Loser."
A strong show overall
All in all, the concert was an
enjoyable and commendable ef
fort. The sound level throughout
both acts was amazingly good.
Lighting effects for the Little
River Band were moderately in
teresting especially the strobes
copic stars and moonlight motif
for their encore number, "Re
miniscing."
Again, the musical virtues of a
solid soft rock band like the Lit
tle River Band should not go un
acknowledged in the wake of
more colorful and contentious
rock 'n' rollers. I left Maples
smiling. So did streams of other
people. And that is, of course,
the payoff.

a string of perfectly acceptable
AM hits. Firefall could have
been good in concert. Instead
they settled for being adequate.
Kicking off its summer tour,
Firefall played several numbers
from Undertow, the band's latest
Ip. These included "Headed For
A Fall" and "Business Is Busi
ness." Firefall hit tunes like "Just
Remember I Love You" and
"Strange Way" did manage to
spark a responsive note from the
large audience.
Energy shortage
By and large though; these,
and lesser known numbers like
"Mexico" and "Sweet And
Sour" came off just a little flat
and occasionally off key. Nor did
band members expend much
musical or physical energy to
offset the missing polish present
on their albums. Enough said.
The Little River Band, on the
other hand, really delivers. The
seasoned Australian band gave
its audience more than mere
muzak. Their rolling, rhythmic
rock 'n' roll numbers were well
timed and well-executed. The
band also projects an energetic

and engaging stage presence.
Unlike Firefall, l ittle River
band members looked like they
were enjoying themselves. They
are pros.
Handful of hits
Boasting multiple hits over the
years, the band performed
"Help Is On The Way," "Happy
Anniversary" and "It's A Long
Way There." Other songs in
cluded "Mistress Ol Mine,"
"Man On The Run"and "Cool
Change" from the First Under
The Wire lp. "Red Shoes" and
"Don't Let The Needle Win"
came from the groups' most re
cent effort. Backstage Bass.
Special mention should be
given to lead singer Glen Shor
rock. I le has a pleasant voice and
he is a good showman. Beeb Bir
tles. Little River electric and
acoustical guitar player, added
several lead vocals and an in
gratiating smile to the perfor
mance. The band also features
an array of competent, even bass
and guitar players as well as an
additional keyboards player who
added sweet, rich tones to the
music. The vocals and harmonies
were generally as well meshed as
the band's melody lines. Little
River members also pen rela
tively intelligent lyrics though
they occasionally indulge in
mawkishly sentimental numbers
like "Lonesome Loser."
A strong show overall
All in all, the concert was an
enjoyable and commendable ef
fort. The sound level throughout
both acts was amazingly good.
Lighting effects for the Little
River Band were moderately in
teresting especially the strobes
copic stars and moonlight motif
for their encore number, "Re
miniscing."
Again, the musical virtues of a
solid soft rock band like the Lit
tle River Band should not go un
acknowledged in the wake of
more colorful and contentious
rock 'n' rollers. I left Maples
smiling. So did streams of other
people. And that is, of course,
the payoff.
