## The
						Island: boring, grisly 
### 
In the beginning there was
Jaws. And Jaws was successful
and made millions for its creator,
Peter Benchley. And he was
pleased with his work.
It came to pass begat
The Deep, and again the masses
flocked to Benchley. Thus, Uni
versal Pictures, looked down
upon Benchley and said, "Thou
true and faithful servant, what
dost thou have for us now?"
Benchley, in his infinite wisdom,
said, "let there be The Island."
And it was done.
The Island, the latest in a
wretched line of summer enter
tainment, is so bad it matches the
quality of the book it's based on.
Screenwriter Benchley and di
rector Michael Ritchie set out to
tell us yet another version of the
Bermuda Triangle Mystery
(yawn) and stop nothing short of
both numbing us with boredom,
and disgusting us with grisly vio

lence.
It's all here, folks. We get ax
ings in the skull and in the
stomach. We get garrotings,
point-blank shootings, bizarre
tortures. All of this, believe it or
not, lies in the first 10 minutes of
The Island, and, as they say, you
ain't seen nothing yet.
We also get Michael Caine as
yet another of those crusading
reporters bent on uncovering the
"hidden truth" behind this mys
terious stretch of water. Snatch
ing his obnoxious, gun-loving
13-year-old son out of school,
Caine waltzes down to Florida,
meets a few of Benchley's "col
orful" cardboard islanders and
proceeds immediately to get cap
tured by a gang of vicious pirates
living on a nearby island. Yes,
that's right. Pirates.
Evidently — we learn in sev
eral agonizingly slow scenes —
these buccaneers have been liv

ing on their hidden island for
some 300 years, all the while
practieing a delightful lifestyle of
sinking any ship that wanders
close enough, and butchering the
men aboard. The women —
Benchley leers through his tat
tered script — are kept for
"more important" Veasons. The
pirates, you see, risk dying out or
going completely insane unless
new female blood can be found
to restock the village.
What a pleasant moment for
us when we learn that Caine will
be allowed to live only until he
impregnates the last of the un
diseased females in the tribe.
Charming.
Caine's brat of a son, for no
understandable reason, then
proceeds to dump dad for the life
offered by these vile, filthy
slaughterers. Jeffrey Frank plays
the boy with about as much ta
