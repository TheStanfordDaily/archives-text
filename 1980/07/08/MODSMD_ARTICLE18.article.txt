## The 						Island: boring, grisly 
### 
In the beginning there was
Jaws. And Jaws was successful
and made millions for its creator,
Peter Benchley. And he was
pleased with his work.
It came to pass begat
The Deep, and again the masses
flocked to Benchley. Thus, Uni
versal Pictures, looked down
upon Benchley and said, "Thou
true and faithful servant, what
dost thou have for us now?"
Benchley, in his infinite wisdom,
said, "let there be The Island."
And it was done.
The Island, the latest in a
wretched line of summer enter
tainment, is so bad it matches the
quality of the book it's based on.
Screenwriter Benchley and di
rector Michael Ritchie set out to
tell us yet another version of the
Bermuda Triangle Mystery
(yawn) and stop nothing short of
both numbing us with boredom,
and disgusting us with grisly vio

lence.
It's all here, folks. We get ax
ings in the skull and in the
stomach. We get garrotings,
point-blank shootings, bizarre
tortures. All of this, believe it or
not, lies in the first 10 minutes of
The Island, and, as they say, you
ain't seen nothing yet.
We also get Michael Caine as
yet another of those crusading
reporters bent on uncovering the
"hidden truth" behind this mys
terious stretch of water. Snatch
ing his obnoxious, gun-loving
13-year-old son out of school,
Caine waltzes down to Florida,
meets a few of Benchley's "col
orful" cardboard islanders and
proceeds immediately to get cap
tured by a gang of vicious pirates
living on a nearby island. Yes,
that's right. Pirates.
Evidently — we learn in sev
eral agonizingly slow scenes —
these buccaneers have been liv

ing on their hidden island for
some 300 years, all the while
practieing a delightful lifestyle of
sinking any ship that wanders
close enough, and butchering the
men aboard. The women —
Benchley leers through his tat
tered script — are kept for
"more important" Veasons. The
pirates, you see, risk dying out or
going completely insane unless
new female blood can be found
to restock the village.
What a pleasant moment for
us when we learn that Caine will
be allowed to live only until he
impregnates the last of the un
diseased females in the tribe.
Charming.
Caine's brat of a son, for no
understandable reason, then
proceeds to dump dad for the life
offered by these vile, filthy
slaughterers. Jeffrey Frank plays
the boy with about as much ta
lent as the man who wrote his
part, alternating his loving son/
rebellious youth facial expres
sions with the dramatic timing
and expertise of Jessica Savitch.
Michael Caine — a long-time
favorite of mine — has nothing
other to do than grit his teeth and
look appalled. Actually, that's
okay. At least 1 felt as if 1 had
company.

If ever an example of wasted
talent could be found, it lies here.
Showing only the slightest hints
of the brilliance demonstrated in
Sleuth and The Man Who Would
Be King, Caine wades through
the bilge, mired in the film's
worst scenes and most insipid
dialogue. I only hope he made a
fortune off this. He deserves
much better.
Women will surely love The

Island. Our female lead masters
two facial expressions, but has no
such range with regards to her
vocal inflections. Of course, that
doesn't matter. Her sole reason
for being in the film is to get pre
gnant. Lovely.
We've heard much about the
emergence of new and important
female roles in the 19705. But
this bit of vile characterization is
enough to remind us how valu
able a Julia or a Norma Rae can
be.
The most insulting aspect of
The Island, however, rests on its
reliance on good old blood and
guts. I've mentioned the first 10
minutes of the film, which serve
as a primer for the atrocities to
come. Director Ritchie sets new
lows in the depths that moral
taste and sense can attain in the
motion picture industry by again
and again splitting a skull open

when the going gets slow.
The problem is simple. We
have a film here that fails on
every conceivable level. First, it
is an action film that fails by lean
ing too much on the sword for its
power. Without any interest
evoked in the characters, why
should we care about who lives
and dies? One can only stand for
so many deaths before they be
come meaningless and, fre
quently. comical.
Second. Benchley's script,
often unintentionally hilarious,
rises only to the level of his
prose. That, alone, should keep
scores out of the theaters.
Packed full of meaningless
scenes and unnecessary charac
ters, and boasting the most inept
and immature musical score in
my memory. The Island stands as
a monument to failure in every
sense.
