## Brubaker — confused, ineffective garbage 
### 
Prison reform is receiving a
good deal of attention these days
and the depiction of prison con
ditions has become a favorite
task of talented documentary
filmmakers. Hollywood is never
far behind, and it now offers us
Brubaker, a painfully deficient
attempt at film.
Robert Redford stars as
Brubaker, the new reformist
warden of a work farm. Another
quixotic battle against the
windmills of corruption could be
a good Redford role. This one is
not.
The movie begins with Red
ford entering the prison as a
prisoner for a few days so that he
can observe first-hand the
miserable prison conditions.

These scenes are completely un
believable. As the cameFa pans
the prisoners we see the usual
unfortunate victims of society.
But none of them looks guilty.
Surely one of the two dozen con
victs has committed the horrible
crime for which he has been sen
tenced. Instead they look like
aged fraternity pranksters, a
reunion at the Animal House.
Only the keepers (who are also
prisoners) look like hardened fe
lons.
And among them is Redford,
his unshaven countenance look
ing scruffy, but in no way crimi
nal. We instantly know that he
couldn't commit a crime worse
than parking in a no loading
zone, and then, only if he had a
good reason.
Throughout Redford's incarc
eration we are forced to observe
hints and glimpses of the various
horrors of prison life. The allu
sions to homosexual rape, tor
ture and general abuse are
hurled at the audience randomly
and wildly. There is no analysis,
no depth to these suggestions.
They have all the sting of a Ned
ball. We wrinkle our noses at the
unpleasantness, but we do not
react with horror.
Director Stuart Rosenberg
tries to horrify us with blood and
gore. We see a man with a gun
shot wound, and we watch
another piece his palm together
after impaling it. Others are hurt
when a roof collapses. But we
don't see these injuries suffered
and we somehow disassociated
them from prison life.
Rosenberg, who has such mas
terpieces as Amityville Horror to
his credit, has completely missed
the real horror of prison life —
the intense, unrelenting tensions
among the inmates. Any
mediocre documentary gets that


Redford et al in Brubaker
point across emphatically.
Rosenberg doesn't even come
close.
The Brubaker publicity mate
rial claims that the mm ie is really
about heroes. This is absurd.
Redford, although dedicated to
reform, cjuits after realizing the
extent of the corruption he is fac
ing. That's a hero? There is no
heroism in the incoherent
"you're not a true liberal" lines
that Redford speaks. Redford
looks confused as he delivers
these lines. We don't understand
them either, and we anticipate
(indeed welcome) his confusion.
Trying to hide another basic
deficiency. Brubaker pretends to
have a plot. There is some puzzl
ing babble about bodies buried
on the farm. Unfortunately there
is no hint that this mystery exists
until the movie has run for an
hour and a half. Bv this time we
couldn't care less about any mys
tery. Apparently neither did the
scriptwriter; we are never given a
satisfactory explanation of what
has been going on.

Rcdford does the best he can
with this shoddy material. With
two notable exceptions, the re
maining actors, mostly second
rate character actors from televi
sion, portray their two
dimensional characters with ap
propriate mediocrity.
The first exception is Yaphet
Kotto, who has too often wasted
his talents in drivel like this. He
displays with facility the only two
emotions the script will allow
him — confusion and anger.
Oddly, these were the only two
emotions this movie elicited
from me.
Jane Alexander is less than
mediocre. She tries to give her
character meaning and \ ibrancy,
but the script gives her so little
help that she falls flat. Seemingly
desirous of further ridicule, she
effects an ephemeral Southern
drawl. At first it sounds Texan,
then Georgian, then Philadelp
hian. It soon becomes unrecog
nizable as Alexander gets con
fused; it's about time she caught
up with us.
