## Brubaker — confused, ineffective garbage 
### 
Prison reform is receiving a
good deal of attention these days
and the depiction of prison con
ditions has become a favorite
task of talented documentary
filmmakers. Hollywood is never
far behind, and it now offers us
Brubaker, a painfully deficient
attempt at film.
Robert Redford stars as
Brubaker, the new reformist
warden of a work farm. Another
quixotic battle against the
windmills of corruption could be
a good Redford role. This one is
not.
The movie begins with Red
ford entering the prison as a
prisoner for a few days so that he
can observe first-hand the
miserable prison conditions.

These scenes are completely un
believable. As the cameFa pans
the prisoners we see the usual
unfortunate victims of society.
But none of them looks guilty.
Surely one of the two dozen con
victs has committed the horrible
crime for which he has been sen
tenced. Instead they look like
aged fraternity pranksters, a
reunion at the Animal House.
Only the keepers (who are also
prisoners) look like hardened fe
lons.
And among them is Redford,
his unshaven countenance look
ing scruffy, but in no way crimi
nal. We instantly know that he
couldn't commit a crime worse
than parking in a no loading
zone, and then, only if he had a
good reason.
Throughout Redford's incarc
eration we are forced to observe
hints and glimpses of the various
horrors of prison life. The allu
sions to homosexual rape, tor
ture and general abuse are
hurled at the audience randomly
and wildly. There is no analysis,
no depth to these suggestions.
They have all the sting of a Ned
ball. We wrinkle our noses at the
unpleasantness, but we do not
react with horror.
Director Stuart Rosenberg
tries to horrify us with blood and
gore. We see a man with a gun
shot wound, and we watch
another piece his palm together
after impaling it. Others are hurt
when a roof collapses. But we
don't see these injuries suffered
and we somehow disassociated
them from prison life.
Rosenberg, who has such mas
terpieces as Amityville Horror to
his credit, has completely missed
the real horror of prison life —
the intense, unrelenting tensions
among the inmates. Any
mediocre documentary gets that
