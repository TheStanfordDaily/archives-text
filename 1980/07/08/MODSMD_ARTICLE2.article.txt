# 250 protest Carter's visit
## 
### Peter Steinerman Assistant News Editor 
Over 250 protesters gathered
nearby the Portola Valley home
ot real-estate developer Walter
Sehorenstein last ITiursdax night
to express their displeasure with
the impending draft registration
and Schorenstein's guest: Presi
dent Jimmy Carter.
Observers say that the de
monstration proceeded peace
fully. with no interference from
police or Secret Service agents.
The protesters assembled at
Portola Valley Shopping Center
at 6 p.m., and marched two miles
towards the Schorensteins'
home. Police barricades kept the
group from entering the estate's
grounds, so they lined the route

ot the president's motorcade
trom where his helicopter
touched down to the house.
Many demonstrators carried
signs saying "I won't die for oil"
and No dralt, and chanted
"Hey. hey, Jimmx Carter, how
many kids do you plan to slaugh
ter Several protesters were
equipped with bull horns.
Bill Evers, candidate for the
House of Representatives and
one of the organizers of the pro
test. commented that Carter
seemed oblivious to the de
monstrators as he sped by in a
police car. Evers referred to the
president's reaction as "a
Richard Nixonism," and that it
was similar to the former presi
dent's refusal to confront de
monstrators in the late '60s.
Barton Bernstein, a professor
of history here, addressed the
crowd prior to Carter's arrival.
Bernstein stated that Carter had
"exaggerated and mishandled"
the various crises of his administ
ration. and that the president
was moving toward an unneces
sary draft. In "Carter
promised us a president we de
served. We're still looking for
him," Bernstein said.
Later, Bernstein characterized
the demonstrators as united by
their opposition to the draft, but
not politically unified. He also
commented that the reporters
following the president in the
motorcade mirrored his disin
terest in the protest.
The protesters were also ad-

dressed by activist Daniel
Ellsburg, who stated that the
burden of stopping the impend
ing draft registration should not
be borne by 19- and 2()-year olds
alone, b.llsburg said that he
openly advocated "ci\ il dis
obedience" in urging people not
to register. and th;it he would ;iid
and abet anyone who did so.
I he protest was sponsored b\
several regional anti-draft or
ganizations. including Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC).
Laura Kay. Stanford senior and
member of SAC, said that she
thought the si/e of the demonst
ration was pretty good, despite
the only one week of advance
notice that was given for the
event.
Kay said that she considered
the registration "the first step
toward the draft," that would be
easier to introduce after the pres
idential elections in November.
She added that SAC had "no
concrete plans" for future de
monstrations in the area.but that
some activities were being consi
dered at local post offices during
the week of July 21. when regist
ration actualh takes place.
A Stanford alumnus who goes
by the name of Chrystal said that
he was gratified that the de
monstration drew so many
people on such short notice.
"The protests," he said,"are just
beginning." and predicted that
they "will grow apace" as the
government moves toward the
introduction of the draft.

sary draft. In "Carter
promised us a president we de
served. We're still looking for
him," Bernstein said.
Later, Bernstein characterized
the demonstrators as united by
their opposition to the draft, but
not politically unified. He also
commented that the reporters
following the president in the
motorcade mirrored his disin
terest in the protest.
The protesters were also ad-

dressed by activist Daniel
Ellsburg, who stated that the
burden of stopping the impend
ing draft registration should not
be borne by 19- and 2()-year olds
alone, b.llsburg said that he
openly advocated "ci\ il dis
obedience" in urging people not
to register. and th;it he would ;iid
and abet anyone who did so.
I he protest was sponsored b\
several regional anti-draft or
ganizations. including Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC).
Laura Kay. Stanford senior and
member of SAC, said that she
thought the si/e of the demonst
ration was pretty good, despite
the only one week of advance
notice that was given for the
event.
Kay said that she considered
the registration "the first step
toward the draft," that would be
easier to introduce after the pres
idential elections in November.
She added that SAC had "no
concrete plans" for future de
monstrations in the area.but that
some activities were being consi
dered at local post offices during
the week of July 21. when regist
ration actualh takes place.
A Stanford alumnus who goes
by the name of Chrystal said that
he was gratified that the de
monstration drew so many
people on such short notice.
"The protests," he said,"are just
beginning." and predicted that
they "will grow apace" as the
government moves toward the
introduction of the draft.
