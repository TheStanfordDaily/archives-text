## Two great new local discs

Huey Lewis and the News

There's good news from the
Bay area's pool of local rock n'
roll talent these days, in the form
of two new debut albums from
San Francisco bands. Ukiah
heroes Tommy Tutone and
Marinites Huey Lewis and the
News have each just released
self-titled albums that are bound
to put San Francisco back on the
map as the place to be for
homegrown rock 'n' roll. Not
only does Tommy Tutone al
ready have a hit single, "Angel
Say No," but both his and Lewis'
albums are already climbing
steadily up the charts. No won
der, for both records are full of
exciting, accessable, and most of
all, truly triumphant music, proc
laiming the joy of being, not a
rock 'n' roll star, hut a rock 'n'
roll heart.
These two bands have a com
mon bond in that both Lewis and
News' keyboard player Sean
Hopper, as well as Tommy
Tutone drummer Mickey Shine,
are late of a band called Clover.
Clover backed Elvis Costello on
his first album and U.S. tour, and
another Stiff act, Dave Ed
munds, has used Lewis' services
on his album Repeat When
Necessary, recording Lewis'
song "Bad is Bad." Clover has
since split, and its members are
divided between the News,
Tommy Tutone, The Doobie
Brothers and Carlene Carter.
Huey Lewis and the News is a
driving, bright and energetic al
bum. The News aren't new wave
by any standards, yet their music,
which is straight ahead rock 'n'
roll, is as modern, concise and
punchy as any of the best of new
wave. The songs aren't cluttered
with the cardinal crime of most
rock 'n' roll — long, bad guitar
solos and stolen stale riffs. Al
most every song on this album
would be a prime choice for a
single. They're all that good. The
actual single, "Some Of My Lies
Arc True (Sooner Or Later),"
which opens the first side, is as
good as they come — it starts out
driving, pushing hard, and never
lets up. The rest of the album
takes off from where "Lies"
leaves off ... on the right side of
catchy. There's nothing lax or
boring about this whole album.
Songs like "Stop Trying," "Now
Here's You" and "Trouble in
Paradise" are the kind that just
one listening will leave firmly
implanted in your brain.
Lewis' voice, a throaty and
commanding r&b growl, delivers
these memorable rockers in just
the right way. The key ingredient
to this record's outstanding
sound is Johnny Colla's
saxophone. Without the sax
breaks that permeate each song,
this could have been just another
hard working rock band's bid for

tame. Instead, it's a real conten
der.
Tommy Tutone is just as good,
and for almost the same reasons.
Tommy Heath, lead singer and
namesake, has a real knack for a
catchy beat and subtly memora
ble lyrics. The haunting quality
to each tune makes them more
than just love songs, and Heath's
anguished nasal shout carries a
conviction that is more than just
a good act.
Tommy Tutone has been to
gether less than a year, but they
fit together so well that their re
lative innocence (they're from
Ukiah, for godsake) is lost in a
naturalness that permeates their
sound. They are concerned with
small town romance, small town
scenarios, small town rock 'n'
roll; and this atmosphere that
they create lingers even after the
melodies have faded. Their
songs are sprinkled with people
we know: Sally, Johnny, Rachel,
June, the girl who was "born
with rock 'n' roll shoes," the boy
who "has the keys to his father's
Ranchero."
The thing that makes Tommy
Tutone and lluey Lewis and the

News so special is their beat. This
is the kind of rock you hear at the
roller rink; the kind of songs you
hum on the way to pick up your
date to the drive-in movies on
Friday night. Tutone and Lewis
are just those boys you see every
day pumping gas, and later, at
night, pumping out a beat so fine

it's impossible to sit still to. Their
hearts are in this music, and thus,
a listener finds himself really
caught up in it. Tutone's
"Sounds of a Summer Night,"
where "boys keep calling, trying
to drag her out on the street, to
dance to the night, move to the
beat of the latest hits," are the

sounds of garage hands, sweating
out rock 'n' roll sets for the local
kids all night long.
Tommy Intone and Huey
Lewis and the News represent
rock at its best, and rock being
used as what it is meant for. It is
rock that means more than just
big bucks for the record com
pany and mindless kicks for the
masses. This is smalltown rock —
rock for the love of rock n' roll,
rock as escape, rock as revela
tion. It is an avenue for ordinary
people, into a smaller, closer and
inevitably nicer, world.
