LOS ANGELES (AP) —
Baseball's 1980 All-Star Game
looks like a home game in more
ways than one for the Los
Angeles Dodgers.
With Los Angeles hosting the
midsummer classic for the first
time in 21 years today, four
Dodgers will be in the National
League's starting lineup and h ur
lers Jerry Reuss and Bob Welch
will be on the mound staff of Na
tional League Manager Chuck
Tanner.
Los Angeles' Steve Garvey
will open at first base, Davey
Lopes at second. Bill Russell at
short and Reggie Smith in the
outfield as the fans' choices.
Lopes was the top vote-getter in
both leagues, being named on
3,862,403 ballots.
There was criticism of the fan
voting — as usual — with some
claiming the ballot boxes were
stuffed at Dodger Stadium.
The NL pitching staff also in
cludes Philadelphia's Steve
Carlton, Pittsburgh's Jim Bibby
and Kent Temulve, Houston's

J.R. Richard, Chicago's Bruce
Sutter and San Francisco's Ed
Whitson — named to replace ail
ing Giants' teammate Vida Blue.
The American League, which
hasn't won an All-Star Game
since 197 1 and has won hut one
of the past 17 contests, tries
again with a number of newcom
ers.
Joining the New York Yan
kees' Tommy John and Rich
Gossage — the only two AL
pitchers who have appeared in a
previous All-Star game — were
Kansas City's Larry Gura, Bal
timore's Steve Stone, Seattle's
Rich Honeycutt, Toronto's Dave
Stieb and relievers Ed Farmer of
Chicago and Tom Burgmeicr of
Boston.
Three AL starters as voted by
the fans — Boston outfielder Jim
Rice, Milwaukee second base
man Paul Molitor and third
baseman George Brett of Kansas
City — will not play because of
injuries.
The contest, to be nationally
televised by ABC-TV, is

scheduled for a 5:40 p.m. PDT
start.
