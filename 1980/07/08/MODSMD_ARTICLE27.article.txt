# Ex-Cardinal basketball star to join 'White Shadow' cast
## 
### Kevin Jones Staff Writer 
Wolfe Perry, former Stanford basketball stand
out. has recently been signed to an acting contract
by the producers of the weekly television series.
The White Shadow. The one-year contract carries a
four year option and a weekly stipend of $1500 for
Perry.
In a telephone interview from his Southern
California home, the Oakland native reported that
he received the part after auditioning while on a
week-long hiatus granted him by the Public Broad
casting System (PBS). He had been working with
PBS since shortly after leaving Stanford in 1979.
Though the series features the encounters of a
white basketball coach in a predominantly black
high school. Perry likes to think that he won the job
through his acting ability, and not merely his athle
tic prowess. He points out that he is the only
"player" in the cast, but also confesses that "when
they found out 1 could dunk, they knew that I
wasn't just another actor."
Perry credits the Stanford Drama Department
with making possible his transition from the
hardwoods to Hollywood. So how did Perry,
ranked among the top 10 scorers in Stanford bas
ketball history, manage to excel in both acting and
sports? "A lot of long days," he replied. "I'd have
class in the morning, basketball all afternoon, re
hearsals in the evening, then have to go study until I
was about to drop. It usually worked out to about
24-hour days."
Though now working 10 to 12 hours every day
on the set. Perry believes that after his years at
Stanford, there is really nothing to it. "It's great. I
can come home at night and my knees don't hurt. I
don t even have to use the rail to pull myself up
stairs anymore.

"It was a little strange at first," Perry said of
living and working around Hollywood. "1 was a big
lan of movies when 1 was growing up. Now 1 can go
down to the car wash or somewhere like that and
I'll see all these people that I'm used to seeing on
the screen.
"People talk a lot about how spoiled actors are
— how tempermental and all that. I suppose
there's some truth to it. but it's really different than
it seems. Actors are professionals. They're good at
what they do, and they expect everything to bo
right. They get upset when it's not."

'Ifs great. I can come home at
night and my knees don't hurt. I
don't even have to use the rail to
pull myself upstairs anymore.'

Though Perry en joys watching other members of
the cast trying to gain and refine basketball skills,
he dare not volunteer his services as a coach. "Like
1 said, actors can be very touchy sometimes. They
don't like to hear about what they're doing wrong.
But you'd better believe that 1 try to learn as much
as 1 can about acting from them. I've learned a lot,
too."
What about Perry's plans for the future? "Origi
nally, I had planned to try acting for four or five
years then pick up my Master's. But I've been
getting good feedback from agents and my man
ager. They've been really positive about the work
I've been doing, so I think I'll just see how it goes
for a while. I'm hoping to do a movie soon, but I
just lost out on a part I really wanted. I'm still
looking, though."
If Wolfe Perry's acting skills develop to any
where near the level of his ability to handle a bas
ketball, he will not have to look for very long.
