# Energyfast begins here

### Jim Harrow Staff Writer 
Starting today, 25 Bay area
high school sophomores, mem
bers of the Youth Conservation
Corps (YCC), will go door to
door in Palo Alto and Menlo
Park for two weeks urging citi
zens to reduce gasoline con
sumption. The group will help
install water heater blankets in
Palo Alto and will launch a
curbside recycling program in
Menlo Park.
The YCC members will try to
educate citizens about energy
conservation by promoting a
program called Energyfast. John
Fitton, Youth Director for the
Corps, said,"Energyfast is trying
to get the residents of the Bay
area to cut their consumption of
gasoline from the national aver
age of bO gallons per month to
40."
If every driver cut back to 40
gallons per month then we would
save as much oil as we now im
port from the Persian Gulf. The
kids will help sign up people for
the Energyfast Program and ask
them to keep a record of their
monthly gasoline consumption.
After two weeks, the students
will return to their own com
munities and continue to involve
people in the same programs.
Gary Williams, director of the
Stanford MBA Program, whose
son Jason is involved with the
YCC, said, "I think it's an excel
lent program. It gives the kids a
chance to participate in conser
vation and helps increase con
sciousness in preserving re
sources."
The YCC was started during
the 1976-77 drought to help citi
zens conserve water and other
natural resources. The YCC is
sponsored by the Creative Initia
tive Foundation, an organization
of 500 Bay area families who
share an interest in preserving
and enhancing the quality of life,
and by the cities of Menlo Park
and Palo Alto.
