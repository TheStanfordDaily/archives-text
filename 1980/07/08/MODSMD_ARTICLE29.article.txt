# Many problems confront space shuttle program
## 
### Ed Asiano Staff Writer 
The problem-riddled space
shuttle program may finally he
ready to get off the ground. Ac
cording to Dr. Michael
Yarymovych. an aeronautics en
gineer at Rockwell Interna
tional. speaking here last Wed
nesday, "it will usher in a new era
in space transportation."
Yarymovych spoke as a part of
the 17th annual Stanford-
NASA-ASEE Aerospace
Technology Seminar, a federally
funded fellowship program, tak
ing place every Wednesday night
in Jordan Hall through August.
The space shuttle, the last of
the once-thriving American
space program is a plane-shaped
rocket similar in size to a DC-9
that will be propelled into space,
where the crew will have up to 30
days to perform experiments,
repair satellites, or in the future,
build space stations.
Its biggest asset is its reusabil
ity. An estimated 50 missions are
projected for each shuttle before
it will be scrapped, as compared
to one mission for each of the
Apollo rockets.
Acceleration has been care
fully designed at three times the

force of gravity to accomodate
the average person.
The shuttle is "just a big truck,
a cabin up front and 60 feet of
payload space," said
Yarymovych. This amounts to
60.000 pounds of payload capac
ity per mission which NASA
hopes will eventually make the
shuttle a money-making propos
ition. As Yarymovych said, the
shuttle is "in business to haul
cargo — payload is by definition
the load that pays."
The space shuttle has, how
ever. been beseiged by prob
lems, economic and technical,
and Tarymovych haltingly de
scribed many of these in his jok
ing manner: "a funny thing hap
pened on the way to insula
tion . . . the damn things (insula
tion tiles) kept breaking."
The insulation remains a
major source of frustration.
Upon re-entry the shuttle is ca
reening down at 25 times the
speed of sound, at a 40 degree
angle. Temperatures rise as high
as 3000 degrees Farenheit. In
Yarymovych's words, "things
get a bit sporty."
To protect the passengers,
19,000 pounds of thermal pro
tection tiles had to be added, se

verely decreasing the payload.
Thirty-one thousand tiles, each
one separately molded to pre
cisely match the contour of the
shuttle, were glued in place.
When tests proved them in
adequate each one had to be re
moved, "densified" and re
placed.
Insulation is not the only prob
lem. Last year the craft's weight
and mechanical structure were
found to be unacceptable after
an analysis of data derived from
two years of testing was made.
The development of the shut
tle's main engine has been a long
process. Yarymovych reported
that "the engines have to be
tested in their clusters of three.
In this we are experiencing some
very good progress," but the
progress has been very time
consuming and costly.
NASA decided that it was im
practical to test engine compo
nents separately before they are
assembled into clusters.
Therefore, if anything mal
functions during testing, the
whole engine can be damaged.
This is exactly what has hap
pened, four times in the last two
years.
Everything from the seven

day orbit capacity to the 160-
hour turn-around time for shut
tle reusability is being
questioned, and many answers
won't come until the projected
86 test missions are completed.
"We're embarrassed, we can't
get our work done — the pres
sure from the customer is severe,
the pressure from the world is
severe. It is a high priority to get
this space shuttle going." said
Yarymovych.
The biggest problem is fund
ing. So far, research and de
velopment plus production costs
are around $9 billion, with oper
ational costs following the de
velopment stage starting at $15
billion.
A recession-conscious Con
gress laid out the fiscal ground

rules: $5.15 billion (in 1971 dol
lars), $300 million for NASA
support facilities and $1 billion
to produce a fleet of five shuttles.
NASA, knowing this was in
adequate, took on the project
hoping that the space needs of
the military would help obtain
additional financing and, thus,
left itself no margin for error.
A fight for funds has ensued.
"I counterclaim the shuttle is on
schedule (not three years be
hind), and the engineers are
doing their jobs at the rate they
are being funded," said
Yarymovych. "We ask for more
money and they (Congress) say
'try harder.' The trouble with
engineers is we do ... we should
put our foot down and say no."
He is quick to add, "but we like
the challenge."

Yarymovych. This amounts to
60.000 pounds of payload capac
ity per mission which NASA
hopes will eventually make the
shuttle a money-making propos
ition. As Yarymovych said, the
shuttle is "in business to haul
cargo — payload is by definition
the load that pays."
The space shuttle has, how
ever. been beseiged by prob
lems, economic and technical,
and Tarymovych haltingly de
scribed many of these in his jok
ing manner: "a funny thing hap
pened on the way to insula
tion . . . the damn things (insula
tion tiles) kept breaking."
The insulation remains a
major source of frustration.
Upon re-entry the shuttle is ca
reening down at 25 times the
speed of sound, at a 40 degree
angle. Temperatures rise as high
as 3000 degrees Farenheit. In
Yarymovych's words, "things
get a bit sporty."
To protect the passengers,
19,000 pounds of thermal pro
tection tiles had to be added, se

verely decreasing the payload.
Thirty-one thousand tiles, each
one separately molded to pre
cisely match the contour of the
shuttle, were glued in place.
When tests proved them in
adequate each one had to be re
moved, "densified" and re
placed.
Insulation is not the only prob
lem. Last year the craft's weight
and mechanical structure were
found to be unacceptable after
an analysis of data derived from
two years of testing was made.
The development of the shut
tle's main engine has been a long
process. Yarymovych reported
that "the engines have to be
tested in their clusters of three.
In this we are experiencing some
very good progress," but the
progress has been very time
consuming and costly.
NASA decided that it was im
practical to test engine compo
nents separately before they are
assembled into clusters.
Therefore, if anything mal
functions during testing, the
whole engine can be damaged.
This is exactly what has hap
pened, four times in the last two
years.
Everything from the seven

day orbit capacity to the 160-
hour turn-around time for shut
tle reusability is being
questioned, and many answers
won't come until the projected
86 test missions are completed.
"We're embarrassed, we can't
get our work done — the pres
sure from the customer is severe,
the pressure from the world is
severe. It is a high priority to get
this space shuttle going." said
Yarymovych.
The biggest problem is fund
ing. So far, research and de
velopment plus production costs
are around $9 billion, with oper
ational costs following the de
velopment stage starting at $15
billion.
A recession-conscious Con
gress laid out the fiscal ground

rules: $5.15 billion (in 1971 dol
lars), $300 million for NASA
support facilities and $1 billion
to produce a fleet of five shuttles.
NASA, knowing this was in
adequate, took on the project
hoping that the space needs of
the military would help obtain
additional financing and, thus,
left itself no margin for error.
A fight for funds has ensued.
"I counterclaim the shuttle is on
schedule (not three years be
hind), and the engineers are
doing their jobs at the rate they
are being funded," said
Yarymovych. "We ask for more
money and they (Congress) say
'try harder.' The trouble with
engineers is we do ... we should
put our foot down and say no."
He is quick to add, "but we like
the challenge."
The problem-riddled space
shuttle program may finally he
ready to get off the ground. Ac
cording to Dr. Michael
Yarymovych. an aeronautics en
gineer at Rockwell Interna
tional. speaking here last Wed
nesday, "it will usher in a new era
in space transportation."
Yarymovych spoke as a part of
the 17th annual Stanford-
NASA-ASEE Aerospace
Technology Seminar, a federally
funded fellowship program, tak
ing place every Wednesday night
in Jordan Hall through August.
The space shuttle, the last of
the once-thriving American
space program is a plane-shaped
rocket similar in size to a DC-9
that will be propelled into space,
where the crew will have up to 30
days to perform experiments,
repair satellites, or in the future,
build space stations.
Its biggest asset is its reusabil
ity. An estimated 50 missions are
projected for each shuttle before
it will be scrapped, as compared
to one mission for each of the
Apollo rockets.
Acceleration has been care
fully designed at three times the

force of gravity to accomodate
the average person.
The shuttle is "just a big truck,
a cabin up front and 60 feet of
payload space," said
Yarymovych. This amounts to
60.000 pounds of payload capac
ity per mission which NASA
hopes will eventually make the
shuttle a money-making propos
ition. As Yarymovych said, the
