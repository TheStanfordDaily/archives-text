# Nurses' contract vote to be revealed today
## Tentative agreement reached 
### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
Stanford Medical Center
nurses reached a tentative ag
reement on their contract which
had expired July I. hospital offi
cials announced yesterday.
One thousand nurses rep
resented by the Committee For
Recognition of Nursing
Achievements (CRONA) will
vote on the newly proposed con
tract until 6 p.m. today. Results
should be confirmed near 10
a.m. tomorrow.
This vote is the second after a
collective bargaining agreement
between the Hospital and
CRONA was defeated July 3 by
a narrow margin, according to
Chief Negotiator for the Hospi
tal, Priscilla Wheeler. After this
defeat CRONA gave the re
quired ten-day notice to strike
July 14, extending it from the
earlier deadline of 12:01 a.m.
July 4.
Details of the agreement and
contract have not been released.
Chief Negotiator of CRONA,
Joanne Nelson, R.N., was not
available for comment.
"Because of the sensitivity,
the negotiators are pretty tight
lipped about it," said Bill Snyder
of Stanford News Services.

"They are giving out information
to members only first."
Should an agreement not he
made the hospital will he ahle to
accept only 100 patients of the
critically ill. emergency, and
short-term patients who want
surgery and can he released hv
July 14. according to Stanford
Medical Center News Bureau di
rector Spyros Andreopoulos.
In the past week, the case load
has dropped form 565 to ahout
250.
All non-emergency and elec
tive surgeries would he directed
to neighboring hospitals. Pa
tients should receive instructions
from their physicians as to any
change in plans. Most elective
surgery after July 4 has already
been postponed.
Outpatient services in the
Hospital's clinics are unaffected
by contract disagreements since
their nurses are not CRONA
members.
Other publications have listed
a weekend differential wage and
higher night shift pay as reasons
for the strike. Senior nurses may
ask for preferential treatment in
rescheduling procedures.
One patient said, "Even
though I will gointosurgeryafter
one day's notice, I have a lot of

sympathy for the nurses. Com
pared to the doctors they get a
pretty raw deal. But it's bizarre
that they don't give the condi
tions of the strike. They aren't
the only affected party."
"At this point, the hospital's
primary concern is to continue to
provide for the welfare of its pa
tients." added Wheeler. Nurses
stated earlier that they intend to
provide coverage of critical care
despite a strike.
In 1978, last minute negotia
tions prevented a walk-out
scheduled before June 30.
Nurses did strike for 1 1 days in
1974 but retained a supervisory
staff of RNs in the intensive care
and emergency units.
"1 was looking forward to
spending the July Fourth holiday
in the hospital," complained
one patient whose surgery was
postponed. "It's safer to be in
there than on the streets that
weekend."
