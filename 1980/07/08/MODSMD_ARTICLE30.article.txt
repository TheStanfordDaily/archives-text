CAIRO, Egypt â€” The de
posed Shah of Iran is "in satisfac
tory condition" and could be
taken out of intensive care soon

one of the doctors treating him
said yesterday.
The specialist, who asked not
to be identified, said during a
telephone interview that
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is
"much better ... (and) can
come out of intensive care if his
temperature remains stable and
normal for three or four days."
The shah's spokesman,
Robert Armad, said the ex
monarch's temperature was
down to 99.5 degrees
Fahrenheit, less than a degree
above normal. It had been re
ported as high as 104 degrees in
recent davs.
The 60-year-old former Ira
nian monarch was rushed to the
hospital June 27 with a high
fever, and chest and abdominal
pains. Three days later, surgeons
operated and drained 1.5 quarts
of pus and water from beneath
the shah's lungs. Doctors said the
pus accumulated there because
of an infected cyst in the pan
creas.
The doctor treating the de
posed ruler said yesterday the
cyst formed because of "an in
jury in the pancreas" during an
operation last March in which
the shah's cancerous spleen was
removed.
