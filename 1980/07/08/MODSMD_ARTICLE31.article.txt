# Busy schedule entails 10 plays
## Summer Theatre opens season 
### Liz Rosner Staff Writer 
The second season of Stan
ford's Summer Theater has offi
cially begun, inaugurated with a
production of Eugene lonesco's
Exit the king on July 2 at noon in
the Nitery.
During the next eight weeks,
the Stanford Summer Theater
will present a total of 10 plays:
seven experimental pieces and
one-acts in the Nitery. and three
main season shows in the Little
Theater.
As the number of perfor
mances indicates, it is an inten
sive summer program for work
shop members. According to
program director Mike Ram
saur, this provides participants
with an "authentic introduction
to repertory theater."
"It is a compact learning ex
perience," said a drama majorat
Stanford who is participating in
the program; "We get more
done in one day than would take
a week to get done during the
school year."
The company, consisting of
Stanford students and visiting
students, is actively involved 15
hours a day, six days a week, in
all aspects of production from set
construction to acting to
makeup.
"You're not just acting â€”
you're learning the craft at the
same time, and immediately put
ting into practice what you're
learning," said Lisa Jacobson,
rehearsing a scene from Hooters
on the theater steps.

Required for all members is a
movement class taught each
morning by Juan Valenzuela.
"Many actors lack flexibility,"
explained Valenzuela. "They
stand orsit or talk; my classes are
to free them and free their
bodies. Just as we train our voi
ces to reflect the motivations be
hind feelings, we can train our
bodies to give those feelings
more sincerity."
Acting classes are optional, of
fered at both introductory and
advanced levels, since those who
prefer not to act may concentrate
solely on technical work. All
those wishing to act, however,
must participate in the technical
areas as well.
During the school year,
academic considerations en
courage the production of plays
that are considered classical, but
obscure. In the summer, how
ever. there is greater freedom to
produce more contemporary and
popular plays. As a result, the
summer lineup attempts to com
bine a commercial orientation
with a literary one.
Total involvement
The participants enjoy the ab
sence of academic conflicts.
"You can't concentrate as com
pletely on acting, movement,
and performances-type activities
when you have an economics
paper due. During the summer,
you can totally devote yourself to

the show," one actor said.
Another participant was more
ambivalent about the idea of
total involvement: "The inten
sity of the program has the dubi
ous advantage of not letting you
think about yourself or about life
itself."
One of the main goals of the
summer theater program is to
achieve a more professional,
summer-stock type of experi
ence for the participants. It is
likely that an individual will be
involved simultaneously in re
hearsals, performances, and
technical work for various pro
ductions.
A full schedule of free plays
The Nitery series will be
shown free of charge Wednesday
through Friday at noon and Fri
day at midnight during the
eight-week period. The plays in
the main season series, shown in
the Little Theater, are Sam
Shepard's Suicide in Bb, Ted Tal
ly's Hooters, and Brian Burton's
adaptation of Sweeney Todd the
Barber.
An important feature of the
summer program is the
camaraderie which develops
among the workshop members.
"We're not just a collection of
people working together," one
participant said. "There's really
a community feeling and unified
spirit. And, of course, there are
great parties on the weekends."
