## Roots of modern feminism 
### 
The Women's Room
Marilyn French
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
687 pps. $2.95
Occasionally a book appears
which cuts behind the
philosophical formulas of
feminism and makes the emo
tions and actions of feminists
comprehensible to mainstream
society. The Women's Room by
Marilyn French does just that.
Even readers who habitually ig
nore radical feminists will not be
able to resist the inexorable emo
tional logic which motivates
French's characters.
The novel describes the evolu
tions of a woman named Mira
from her precocious childhood in
the '30s. through motherhood,"
into mature adulthood. Along
the way the book avoids every
cliche we now associate with the
raising of a feminist conscious
ness. Although Mira is typical of
many women of her generation,
she is not the stereotyped
housewife who hates her life and
deserts to California. She was
happily married and reasonably
content with her life. She was
bewildered by her husband's
sudden desire for a divorce.
When she went to Harvard in
1968 to begin work on her doc
torate, she did not intend to be

come a feminist. Her convictions
grew out of her experiences.
French's description of Mira's
growth not only describes one
person's perceptions, but the
perceptions of women across the
country. The novel thus reveals
the empirical roots from which
the modern women's movement
sprang.

/ hate discussions of
feminism that end up
with who does the
dishes. . . . But at the
end, there are always the
damned dishes.

Mira changes radically in the
course of The Women's Room,
but she nevertheless remains an
accessible character. Readers
who have never been divorced
can feel her shock as distinctly as
if it were their own. Those who
are not willful can feel her out
rage at being manipulated.
Those who are male can ap
preciate her philosophy and the
uneasy contradictions of her ide
als. This accessibility removes
the mystery behind feminist
philosophy.

The Women's Room is clearly
political, yet it succeeds because
it is not a polemic. It prescribes
few answers to the intolerable
situations Mira and her friends
face. Rather, it formulates the
crucial feminist questions in such
a way they become recognizable
as the age-old questions that
have troubled humankind since
societies were first formed. What
are the natures of independence
and dependence among indi
viduals? Are we free agents in
society or does culture govern
our futures and program our
drives? Can love be anything but
completely selfish? Obviously,
questions as momentous as these
cannot be answered, but they do
take on feminist significance.
Mira's story is interspersed
with reflections by the narrator
about Mira's life. She writes
from some time in the early
1970s and the reader soon be
gins to suspect that the narrator
is telling us her own life story.
Consequently, her opening re
marks are enticing for the wealth
of experiences they imply, but
they arc also confusing. The
book should he read twice be
cause the real conclusion ap
pears in the first two chapters.
The characters who share Mi
ra's life at Harvard are worthy of

mention. First there is Val, a big,
loud woman who joins "the luna
tic fringe that gets the middle to
move over a hit;" a curious
Christ figure. Isolde once made
an attempt at achieving respec
tability by getting engaged, but

realized immediately that it was
hopeless. At last report, she was
studying Middle English in Lon
don and living with a marvelous
woman who drives a cab. Ben:
playful, intelligent, caring, the
best of men but nonetheless one
who expects great sacrifices from
the woman he loves.

All truths are mortal
illnesses.

There are others. Kyla, the law
student at Stanford who will one
day "come flying through my
window like Batwoman. bearing
in her hand the new Ten Com
mandments." There is Ava, the
born dancer who began too late:
"1 keepfalling. 1 am old. There is
no hope."
These characters come alive
on the pages of The Women's
Room. The reader soon begins to
wonder if they aren't real people.
Is The Women's Room really
Marilyn French's autobiog
raphy? Are its characters her
personal friends? In the end, it
doesn't matter. The emotions
are real. The characters are as
memorable as any you will meet.
To paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut:
just because it never happened
doesn't mean it isn't true.

no hope."
These characters come alive
on the pages of The Women's
Room. The reader soon begins to
wonder if they aren't real people.
Is The Women's Room really
Marilyn French's autobiog
raphy? Are its characters her
personal friends? In the end, it
doesn't matter. The emotions
are real. The characters are as
memorable as any you will meet.
To paraphrase Kurt Vonnegut:
just because it never happened
doesn't mean it isn't true.

The Women's Room
Marilyn French
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
687 pps. $2.95
Occasionally a book appears
which cuts behind the
philosophical formulas of
feminism and makes the emo
tions and actions of feminists
comprehensible to mainstream
society. The Women's Room by
Marilyn French does just that.
Even readers who habitually ig
nore radical feminists will not be
able to resist the inexorable emo
tional logic which motivates
French's characters.
The novel describes the evolu
tions of a woman named Mira
from her precocious childhood in
the '30s. through motherhood,"
into mature adulthood. Along
the way the book avoids every
cliche we now associate with the
raising of a feminist conscious
ness. Although Mira is typical of
many women of her generation,
she is not the stereotyped
housewife who hates her life and
deserts to California. She was
happily married and reasonably
content with her life. She was
bewildered by her husband's
sudden desire for a divorce.
When she went to Harvard in
1968 to begin work on her doc
torate, she did not intend to be

come a feminist. Her convictions
grew out of her experiences.
French's description of Mira's
growth not only describes one
person's perceptions, but the
perceptions of women across the
country. The novel thus reveals
the empirical roots from which
the modern women's movement
sprang.

/ hate discussions of
feminism that end up
with who does the
dishes. . . . But at the
end, there are always the
damned dishes.

Mira changes radically in the
course of The Women's Room,
but she nevertheless remains an
accessible character. Readers
who have never been divorced
can feel her shock as distinctly as
if it were their own. Those who
are not willful can feel her out
rage at being manipulated.
Those who are male can ap
preciate her philosophy and the
uneasy contradictions of her ide
als. This accessibility removes
the mystery behind feminist
philosophy.

The Women's Room is clearly
political, yet it succeeds because
it is not a polemic. It prescribes
few answers to the intolerable
situations Mira and her friends
face. Rather, it formulates the
crucial feminist questions in such
a way they become recognizable
as the age-old questions that
have troubled humankind since
societies were first formed. What
are the natures of independence
and dependence among indi
viduals? Are we free agents in
society or does culture govern
our futures and program our
drives? Can love be anything but
completely selfish? Obviously,
questions as momentous as these
cannot be answered, but they do
take on feminist significance.
Mira's story is interspersed
with reflections by the narrator
about Mira's life. She writes
from some time in the early
1970s and the reader soon be
gins to suspect that the narrator
is telling us her own life story.
Consequently, her opening re
marks are enticing for the wealth
of experiences they imply, but
they arc also confusing. The
book should he read twice be
cause the real conclusion ap
pears in the first two chapters.
The characters who share Mi
ra's life at Harvard are worthy of

mention. First there is Val, a big,
loud woman who joins "the luna
tic fringe that gets the middle to
move over a hit;" a curious
Christ figure. Isolde once made
an attempt at achieving respec
tability by getting engaged, but

realized immediately that it was
hopeless. At last report, she was
studying Middle English in Lon
don and living with a marvelous
woman who drives a cab. Ben:
playful, intelligent, caring, the
best of men but nonetheless one
who expects great sacrifices from
the woman he loves.

All truths are mortal
illnesses.

There are others. Kyla, the law
student at Stanford who will one
day "come flying through my
window like Batwoman. bearing
in her hand the new Ten Com
mandments." There is Ava, the
born dancer who began too late:
"1 keepfalling. 1 am old. There is
no hope."
