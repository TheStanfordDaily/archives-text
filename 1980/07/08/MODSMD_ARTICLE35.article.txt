In Whit/ House Years Henry
Kissinger enters into negotia
tions with the reader on the
meaning of the five years of his
tory from 1968 to 1973 covered
by this first volume of his
memoires. The controversial
episodes are there. Kissinger's
chapters on The Agony of Viet
nam and Autumn of Crisis: Chile
will provoke the most con
troversy among pundits.
But Kissinger negotiates con
vincingly. Despite the heroic
length of the work, his prose
rarely sags. Instead with each
new development he revives the
reader's interest with occasional
vistas of global events, engaging
portraits of the leaders with
whom he met and of colleagues
with whom he maneuvered for
power and influence.
