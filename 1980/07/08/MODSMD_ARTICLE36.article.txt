# Henry Kissinger
## WHITE HOUSE YEARS 
### 
Interspersed are humorous
anecdotes, some revealing wit
and some reflecting the slapstick
absurdities that can overtake
powerful men on serious busi
ness. Kissinger relates that be
cause of his relatively low station
as National Security Advisor
much of his time at banquets was
spent calculating the distance be
tween himself and the President
and wondering whether when
the affair ended he could reach
his limousine before the motor
cade drove away.
Kissinger, like many conserva
tive writers, has mastered the art
of the sardonic observation. He
takes delight in pointing out in an
aside the inconsistencies of a
domestic opponent. These barbs
scattered throughout the book
will undoubtedly delight his
sympathizers and infuriate his
victims.
Kissinger's arguments are co
gent in their appeal and Byzan
tine in detail. From negotiations
with the urbane French Presi
dent Pompidou on NATO
policies to the frustration of fac
ing the implacable North Viet
namese negotiator Le Due Tho,
he finds political interconnec
tions that link disparate per
sonalities and ambiguous events
into a coherent pattern. Ulti
mately, it is Kissinger's unshake
able faith in the coherence of this
pattern and his own ability to
shape it that makes him convinc
ing to his supporters and suspect
to his detractors.
Critics like Barbara Tuchman
argue that Kissinger is the "com
plete cold warrior" and that we
should view the antagonism with
Communism in "local terms."
This is surely sensible advice but
not very helpful. In any case it is
difficult to indict Kissinger on

the charge that he fails to con
sider regional political needs in
his policy formulations. Such
considerations guided him in his
negotiations with the European
powers within the Common
Market, and they led him to his
patient strategy in the Middle
East.
In the New York Review of
Books Stanley Hoffmann argues
that the problem with Kissinger
is that his approach rests on a
false premise, that the rivalry r>e
tween the United States and
Soviet Union "absorbs every
other conflict or issue." But
Hoffmann overstates considera
tion of Soviet motives. As the
only other acknowledged super
power, the Soviet Union must be
considered in our foreign policy
decisions around the world. It
would be equally absurd for the
Soviets to ignore U.S. influence
in their calculations.
What disturbs Kissinger's cri
tics the most is his espousal of a
20th century balance of power.
Nuclear weapons and the
emergence of the Third World
since World War II have not
eradicated the arithmetic of the
balance of power but have raised
it to a calculus.
If there were any doubts re
maining, Vietnam clarified that
the American position in the
world is not one of hegemony but
of a nation that like all others has
to find its role in the global ba
lance.
Hut the really distasteful im
plication of the balance of
power, one that does not jibe
with the liberal conclusions of
the 19605, is that in the long run
military power does matter.
Perhaps one of the strongest as
sertions in Kissinger's memoires
is the historical lesson that the
goodness of a country's citizens
and the justice of its institutions
simpply do not make a difference
in the life expectancy of nations.
The only proven correlate to
security in global politics has

been military strength.
Kissinger's book will undoub
tedly fuel debate for decades to
come. It must be read as a classic
on American politics by anyone
who professes to try to under
stand American foreign policy in
the last 20 years.

mately, it is Kissinger's unshake
able faith in the coherence of this
pattern and his own ability to
shape it that makes him convinc
ing to his supporters and suspect
to his detractors.
Critics like Barbara Tuchman
argue that Kissinger is the "com
plete cold warrior" and that we
should view the antagonism with
Communism in "local terms."
This is surely sensible advice but
not very helpful. In any case it is
difficult to indict Kissinger on

the charge that he fails to con
sider regional political needs in
his policy formulations. Such
considerations guided him in his
negotiations with the European
powers within the Common
Market, and they led him to his
patient strategy in the Middle
East.
In the New York Review of
Books Stanley Hoffmann argues
that the problem with Kissinger
is that his approach rests on a
false premise, that the rivalry r>e
tween the United States and
Soviet Union "absorbs every
other conflict or issue." But
Hoffmann overstates considera
tion of Soviet motives. As the
only other acknowledged super
power, the Soviet Union must be
considered in our foreign policy
decisions around the world. It
would be equally absurd for the
Soviets to ignore U.S. influence
in their calculations.
What disturbs Kissinger's cri
tics the most is his espousal of a
20th century balance of power.
Nuclear weapons and the
emergence of the Third World
since World War II have not
eradicated the arithmetic of the
balance of power but have raised
it to a calculus.
If there were any doubts re
maining, Vietnam clarified that
the American position in the
world is not one of hegemony but
of a nation that like all others has
to find its role in the global ba
lance.
Hut the really distasteful im
plication of the balance of
power, one that does not jibe
with the liberal conclusions of
the 19605, is that in the long run
military power does matter.
Perhaps one of the strongest as
sertions in Kissinger's memoires
is the historical lesson that the
goodness of a country's citizens
and the justice of its institutions
simpply do not make a difference
in the life expectancy of nations.
The only proven correlate to
security in global politics has

been military strength.
Kissinger's book will undoub
tedly fuel debate for decades to
come. It must be read as a classic
on American politics by anyone
who professes to try to under
stand American foreign policy in
the last 20 years.
