## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
President Jimmy Carter's
two-day visit to the Bay area last
week included touring, politick
ing and some rather vocal op
position. especially from groups
opposed to the draft and regist
ration.
Fresh from a morning speech
to a gathering of the National
Education Association in Los
Angeles. Carter landed Thurs
day afternoon at the Oakland
Airport, greeted by Oakland
Mayor Lionel Wilson, anil sev
eral local Democratic Party

leaders. Carter's lirst visit to the
area in over a year included a
windy hut warm tour of the port
of Oakland which he called a fast
growing, dynamic area of the
state.
After the tour, the President
and Mrs. Carter appeared briefly
in Jack London square, greeted
by civic leaders and friends and
also several hundred picketers
protesting his reinstatement of
draft registration and several
other issues.
Ignoring their chants of "Stop
the Draft" and "Hey, Hey, Ho,
I 10. Carter's draft has got to go,"

Carter instead attacked recent
Republican proposed tax cut
plans.
I le said the tax cut proposed by
Republican presidential candi
date Ronald Reagan â€” which
would eventually lower federal
income taxes by 30 percent
would reward the wealthy and
was sheer deception.
" Ah. c'mon let's talk about the
draft" called a sign-carrying stu
dent. There was no response
from Carter.

released from the White House
