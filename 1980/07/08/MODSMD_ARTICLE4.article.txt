# Carter politicks around Bay area
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
President Jimmy Carter's
two-day visit to the Bay area last
week included touring, politick
ing and some rather vocal op
position. especially from groups
opposed to the draft and regist
ration.
Fresh from a morning speech
to a gathering of the National
Education Association in Los
Angeles. Carter landed Thurs
day afternoon at the Oakland
Airport, greeted by Oakland
Mayor Lionel Wilson, anil sev
eral local Democratic Party

leaders. Carter's lirst visit to the
area in over a year included a
windy hut warm tour of the port
of Oakland which he called a fast
growing, dynamic area of the
state.
After the tour, the President
and Mrs. Carter appeared briefly
in Jack London square, greeted
by civic leaders and friends and
also several hundred picketers
protesting his reinstatement of
draft registration and several
other issues.
Ignoring their chants of "Stop
the Draft" and "Hey, Hey, Ho,
I 10. Carter's draft has got to go,"

Carter instead attacked recent
Republican proposed tax cut
plans.
I le said the tax cut proposed by
Republican presidential candi
date Ronald Reagan — which
would eventually lower federal
income taxes by 30 percent
would reward the wealthy and
was sheer deception.
" Ah. c'mon let's talk about the
draft" called a sign-carrying stu
dent. There was no response
from Carter.
Earlier 111 the day a statement
released from the White House
ministrations. "There has to be a common com
mitment which was lacking in the early '70s when
our nation was torn apart . . . was not trusted, not
believed," said the president. "Things were done in
secret, and when these secrets were revealed,
brought shame to the Oval Office . . . and to the
people of the United States." he continued.
Commenting on issues at home. Carter stated,
"my administration is committed to the deprived,
the poor . . . the illiterate . . . those more unfortu
nate than ourselves. It is our duty to bring them
into the consciousness of America."
After his speech. Carter was joined by Feinstein,
Wilson and Janet Gray Hayes, mayor of San Jose,
on the podium. Feinstein, looking especially viv
acious, announced, "It is my great pleasure to pre
sent this to my president. . . the Order of Maritime
Merit. Rank of Grand Commander."
Carter accepted the award, flashed a toothy grin,
then jumped from the podium carrying the gaudy
placque, obviously very pleased.
It was a gorgeous, sleepy day in Portola
Valley — perfect for an outdoor luncheon. 1h the
hours before the president's arrival, the uuests en

joyed Chicken Senorita, sangria and mango ice
cream on a lav ishly decorated outdoor patio.
Next door to the "Meadows," Shorenstein's
"country home," a man hoeing weeds is seemingly
oblivious that the most powerful man in the world
will be honored a short distance away.
Soon a fleet of Mercedes, Rolls and Cadillacs
break the fragile quiet. A regiment of valets
quickly relieve the owners of their cars. People of
all kinds are arriving. Arabs, Japanese
businessmen and their wives, graying executives,
blacks, whites, Indian women, all are among the
many attending the president's visit. When Chip
Carter arrives, he is the celebrity of the moment.
He bears a remarkable resemblance to Jimmy
around the mouth.
As small talk infiltrates the large patio area, and
Cal Tjader's band plays Brazilian rhythms in the
background, the scene takes on the air of a well
scrubbed church social. Then the press arrives en
masse, and a helicopter arrives signifying the im
portance of a man dropping in on the spot; even the
mariachis stop for a look. The anticipation is thick
in the air. and when Carter suddenly appears, all
else is forgotten.

released from the White House
ministrations. "There has to be a common com
mitment which was lacking in the early '70s when
our nation was torn apart . . . was not trusted, not
believed," said the president. "Things were done in
secret, and when these secrets were revealed,
brought shame to the Oval Office . . . and to the
people of the United States." he continued.
Commenting on issues at home. Carter stated,
"my administration is committed to the deprived,
the poor . . . the illiterate . . . those more unfortu
nate than ourselves. It is our duty to bring them
into the consciousness of America."
After his speech. Carter was joined by Feinstein,
Wilson and Janet Gray Hayes, mayor of San Jose,
on the podium. Feinstein, looking especially viv
acious, announced, "It is my great pleasure to pre
sent this to my president. . . the Order of Maritime
Merit. Rank of Grand Commander."
Carter accepted the award, flashed a toothy grin,
then jumped from the podium carrying the gaudy
placque, obviously very pleased.
It was a gorgeous, sleepy day in Portola
Valley — perfect for an outdoor luncheon. 1h the
hours before the president's arrival, the uuests en

joyed Chicken Senorita, sangria and mango ice
cream on a lav ishly decorated outdoor patio.
Next door to the "Meadows," Shorenstein's
"country home," a man hoeing weeds is seemingly
oblivious that the most powerful man in the world
will be honored a short distance away.
Soon a fleet of Mercedes, Rolls and Cadillacs
break the fragile quiet. A regiment of valets
quickly relieve the owners of their cars. People of
all kinds are arriving. Arabs, Japanese
businessmen and their wives, graying executives,
blacks, whites, Indian women, all are among the
many attending the president's visit. When Chip
Carter arrives, he is the celebrity of the moment.
He bears a remarkable resemblance to Jimmy
around the mouth.
As small talk infiltrates the large patio area, and
Cal Tjader's band plays Brazilian rhythms in the
background, the scene takes on the air of a well
scrubbed church social. Then the press arrives en
masse, and a helicopter arrives signifying the im
portance of a man dropping in on the spot; even the
mariachis stop for a look. The anticipation is thick
in the air. and when Carter suddenly appears, all
else is forgotten.
