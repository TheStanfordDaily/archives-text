## Computer analyzes writing styles Play attributed to Shakespeare 
### Nikki Finke The Associated Press 
LONDON — A computer
program that analyzes writing
styles has convinced one British
scholar that a much-contested
16th-century play is the work of
William Shakespeare.
Thomas Merriam, a lecturer at
Basingstoke Technical College,
said Sunday he analyzed by
computer The Booke of Sir
Thomas More, which has long
been the subject of scholarly dis
pute. He believes Shakespeare
was the author. Others attribute
at least part of it to Shakes
peare's rival, Anthony Munday.
In 1916 the British academic
Sir Edward Maunde Thompson
concluded that, based on hand
writing evidence, Shakespeare
had written at least a section of
the play. But the claim has been
hotly contested. Most of the play
is said to be in Munday's hand
writing.
"The only reason that scholars
have given for Munday writing
the play is that it is in Munday's
handwriting," Merriam told The

Associated Press. "Now we have
a way of more or less de
monstrating that the real author
is not the person who actually
wrote it."
Merriam combined his in
terest in computers and Shakes
peare on the disputed manus
cript by using a sophisticated
computer program of writing
style analysis developed in 1976
at Edinburgh University.
Merriam, 46, said the compu
ter program can distinguish
among the writing of different
authors by looking at uncon
scious "word habits" which con
sistently appear in a writer's
work but reportedly cannot suc
cessfully be copied by imitators
or forgers.
The result is a kind of literary
fingerprint that can be analyzed
by entering an entire text into a
computer. Merriam says.
Merriam compared 41 word
habits in other Shakespeare

plays — including Julius Caesar
and Pericles — with the text of
Sir Thomas More and found only
one difference he believed sig
nificant.
" I here can be no doubt that
the words are Shakespeare's."
he said. But he still expects skep
ticism from other academics:
The reason the play is in both
men's handwriting, according to
Merriam, is that Munday copied
the words from Shakespeare dur
ing a brief period of collabora
tion between their two rival thea
ter companies in 1593, the year
the play is believed to have been
written.
The computer method, de
veloped by Morton, has gained
some acceptance in the literary
world. Morton used it to estab
lish Titus Andronicus as a play
by Shakespeare and not by
playwright John Peele as some
scholars thought.
