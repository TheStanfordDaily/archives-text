# Atrocities cited in El Salvador

LA ESTANCIA, Honduras
— More than 460 refugees from
El Salvador who arrived in this
remote mountain village on May
5 are lising in makeshift tents of
plastic and sticks or in hammocks
strung beneath trees that offer
only scant protection from the
season's daily storms.
Many of the children are
naked, their bodies covered with
sores, their bellies distended
with malnutrition, playing in
sewage-drenched mud among
emaciated pigs and dogs.
But they are the lucky ones.
Other Salvadorans who have at
tempted escape to this country
have been caught between what
a Honduran journalist called
"the hammer and the anvil."
Fleeing before the counterin
surgency sweeps by the Salvado
ran armed forces, they arrive at
the border to be met by Hondu
ran troops.
Reports sifting out of an even
more remote region about 50
miles west of here suggest that
the biggest massacre in recent
Salvadoran history may have
taken place nine days after these

people arrived, when another
large group of refugees tried to
cross the Sumpul River into
Honduras.
Accounts by priests and nuns
who have traveled on both sides
of the border vary as to the
number of casualties and some
key details. Some say the Hon
duran troops fired on refugees,
others that the Mondurans fired
on the Salvadoran soldiers to try
to stop the slaughter and some
sav the Hondurans never fired at
all'.
What is clear is that despite the
worsening violence that besets
densely populated El Salvador,
less than 1500 Salvadoran re
fugees have made their way into
Honduras so far.
This may be because many
have decided to go not as re
fugees, but as immigrants to
other Central American coun
tries, to Mexico or, in many cases
as illegal immigrants to the Un
ited States. If it is also that they
are afraid of the Honduran
troops patrolling the border, the
Honduran government hardly
finds that upsetting.
Many Hondurans regard the
refugees as the vanguard of a

Salvadoran revolution.
For Honduras, the difficulties
posed by these people are not
merely questions of sustenance.
The poorest nation in Central
America, Honduras still suffers
from admitting many of the
1 ()(),()()() Nicaraguan refugees
during the Sandinista revolution
a year ago. Those eventually left,
to he replaced by several
thousand defeated Nicaraguan
national guardsmen, who have
been both an economic burden
and a political liability for Hon
duras in its relations with the new
Nicaraguan government.
Tremendously complicating
matters as far as the Salvadorati
refugees are concerned is the
lack of diplomatic relations bet
ween Honduras and El Salvador,
dating back to the 100-hour
"soccer war" in 1969. Although
a disputed soccer game was in
volved. the cause of the conflict
was Honduran resentment of
Salvadoran immigration, and
after the war 300,000 Salvado
rans were expelled from Hon
duras. This country has 1 million
fewer people than El Salvador's
4.6 million, and Honduras has a
far larger territory.
