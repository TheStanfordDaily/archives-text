BANGKOK. Thailand â€”
Three major relief agencies,
"fed up" with being used as
food suppliers for a guerrilla
war, will cut off all food aid to
areas of the embattled Thai-
Cambodian border controlled
by insurgents loyal to ousted
Cambodian Premier Pol Pot,
reliable sources said yesterday.
Documents made available
to The Associated Press
showed that the International
Committee of the Red Cross,
the U.N. Children's Fund (UN
ICEF) and the U.N. World
Food Program (WFP) would
halt the food flow by July 21
because much of it was be
lieved going to Pol Pot's guer
rillas.
The Pol Pot forces are fight
ing Vietnamese troops and sol
diers of the Hanoi-backed
Cambodian government.
It also was learned that the
three agencies hope to phase
their programs out of the entire
border relief operation, hand
ing over the task of caring for
some 200,000 people to pri
vate voluntary groups.
For now, the ICRC and UN
ICEF will continue food dis

tribution to displaced Cambo
dians in border areas outside
Pol Pot territory, provided
there is a clear separation bet
ween civilians and '"armed
groups."
In the region north of the
Thai border town of Aranyap
rathet, anti-communist "Free
Khmer" groups control large
concentrations of Cambodians.
Relief officials have had easier
access to needy civilians in
these encampments than to the
Pol Pot areas.
Sources in the agencies said
they were "fed up" because the
Pol Pot forces were clearly re
ceiving food supplies, in viola
tion of the agencies' basic prin
ciples. that would increase their
fighting ability.
Recent fighting between
Vietnamese and Thai troops
along the frontier may have
been a factor in the suspension
decision, which was reportedly
made at a recent meeting in
New York of ICRC operations
chief Jean-Pierre Hocke, UN
ICEF head James Grant and
Sir Robert Jackson, a special
envxjy of U.N. Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim
charged with the refugee prob
lem.
