AJO, Ariz. — Twelve Sal
vadorans feared lost in the blis
tering heat of the Arizona desert
turned up in a Mexican border
town yesterday, surprising offi
cials searching for more victims
of a cruel abandonment by
smugglers.
Thirteen bodies and 13 sur
vivors were found over the
weekend in the scorched waste
land of Organ Pipe National
Monument Park, where sand
temperatures soared as high as
150 degrees.
"It was very good news" to
learn that the unaccounted-for
women and children never left
San Luis, Sonora, Mexico, with
26 others known to have been
smuggled into the park about 20
miles southeast of here," said
Senior Border Patrol Agent E.J.
"Jerry" Scott.
Although the search con
tinued yesterday. Park Superin
tendent Franklin Wallace said
agents didn't expect to find any
more bodies or survivors in the
516 square-mile park.
The most recently discovered
bodies — nine women and two
men found Sunday in a decom
posing condition — indicated the
ill-fated aliens expected the
smugglers to escort them to
civilization, Scott said.
Some of the women were clad
in high-heeled shoes, silk stock
ings and dresses and had painted
toenails and fingernails, attire
woefully unsuited for a 50- to
60-mile hike across the desert.
Three women and two men
were being treated for dehydra
tion and cactus wounds at the
company hospital of the Phelps

Dodge mining company. All
were listed in serious condition
but were expected to survive.
Eight others were being kept at a
Pima County Sheriff's station
about one mile away.
Scott refused to allow repor
ters to visit either group of sur
vivors. He also lamented the fact
that the first survivors found
along Route 85 lied about their
companions.
"The first three men we found
on the highway told us there
were no others in the desert,"
said Scott. "That was on Friday,
and if they had told us about the
other people out there we prob
ably could have saved them all."
The 13 men and women who
lived through the waterless
ordeal told authorities they sur
vived by drinking aftershave lo
tion. liquid deodorant and urine.
Some survivors said several
among them threatened to kill
one another over drops of urine.
"We put it in rags and we
wiped our faces with it," said
Yolanda Estela Hernandez, 20.
"It was so hot and we were so
thirsty."
Scott said the smugglers,
known as "coyotes" along the
border, brought the Salvadorans
to the Mexican side of the border
by truck, walked them across a
barbed wire cattle fence to the
American side then stole their
money and valuables.
The survivors told agents they
paid up to $ 1200 each to get into
the United States.
"One of the merchants had
$4000 on him so he apparently
escaped from being robbed,"
said Scott, who vowed that the
smugglers would be caught.
