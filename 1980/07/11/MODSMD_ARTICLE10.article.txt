# Space 'junkyard' envisioned

### Howard Benedict The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON â€” One year
after Skylab tumbled spectacu
larly from the Western Austra
lian sky, at least 4700 manmade
objects still orbit Earth, a vast
space junkyard whirling at
17,000 mph.

Scientists worry that one day
the debris will start colliding,
breaking into smaller orbiting
fragments, and create a poten
tially serious hazard for as
tronauts, satellites and space sta
tions.
"If the current trend con
tinues, collisions between orbit
ing fragments and other space
objects could be frequent," says
D.J. Kessler, an astrophysicist
with the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA).
There's even talk about cap
turing some of the larger pieces
and parking them in a safe place
in orbit.
"With the space shuttle, it may
prove beneficial to retrieve old
payloads and rocket bodies, and
the designation of an area of

space as a 'garbage dump' may
be useful," Kessler said.
Skylab was a special case. At
77.5 tons, the space station was
the largest satellite ever sent into
orbit, and sections of it were big
enough to survive the searing
heat of re-entry.
NASA says nothing that big
made by the United States will
be allowed to make an uncon
trolled re-entry again. It will be
kept in orbit or be guided to re
entry over an ocean.
Kessler, a member of NASA's
Space Environment Office, said
only 5 percent of the orbiting ob
jects are operating satellites,
while 12 percent are nonfunc
tioning. Another 18 percent are
rocket stages, bolts, cables, sep
aration springs and other devices
that accompany the pay/oads.
