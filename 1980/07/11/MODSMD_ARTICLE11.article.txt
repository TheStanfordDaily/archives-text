Searing sunshine pushed the
1980 heat wave into its 1 9th day

over a wide area of the South,
Southwest, the Plains and
Dakotas. The death toll from the
heat reached 217 in 13 states.
Heat-related deaths num

lahoma, 29 in Arkansas, 17 in
Tennessee, 14 in Missouri, nine
each in Georgia and Kansas, six
in Illinois, five in Mississippi,
lour in Louisiana, and one each
in Alabama, Indiana and Neb
raska.
Fred Ostby, director ot the
National Severe Storms Fore
case Center in Kansas City, said
yesterday that temporary relief
may be in store for Kansas and
part of Oklahoma on Sunday and
Monday from a low pressure sys

tem heading eastward from the
north-central Pacific.
Me cautioned the relief would
not affect Texas, and"it may last
only a couple of days. We may
have a couple of days where the
temperatures will not get over
90."
In Nebraska, corn farmers
face potential losses in the mill
ions of dollars unless rain falls.
Donald Hanwav of the Univer
sity of Nebraska said the greatest
danger is to non-irrigated corn, a
crop worth $36 million last year.
In Texas, farmers have lost at
least $750 million worth of crop
and livestock from the heat wave
and dry spell, said Reagan
Brown, state agricultural com
missioner. He said greater losses
could occur if no rain falls by
Aug. I.
