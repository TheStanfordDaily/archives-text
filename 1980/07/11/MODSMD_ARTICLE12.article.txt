## Abortion ruling cruel to low-income women 
### 
On June 30, the Supreme Court ruled in a narrow 5-4 decision
that Congress could ban federal payments for most abortions, even
if the operation is considered medically necessary but not endanger
ing the mother's life. This decision comes seven years after the
court's landmark 7-2 ruling that abortions could not be prohibited
up to the sixth month of pregnancy.
We find the recent ruling by this slim majority to be a callous
denial of the court's position as a champion of the rights of the poor
and disadvantaged in this country. A quarter of a million women
each year, many of them because of medical necessity, will be
forced to find cheap (and thus often illegal) abortions or bear
unwanted children under conditions of duress.
Justice Potter Stewart wrote for the majority that "abortion is
inherently different from other medical procedures" and that Con
gress could deny Medicaid funding for abortions in the pursuance of
the ■"legitimate government objective of protecting potential life."
We do not accept these arguments in light of the court's earlier
decision striking a law that declared abortions illegal and recogniz
ing the constitutional right of women to choose to terminate a
pregnancy. It the court is morally opposed to this form of medical
care, why cannot Congress exercise its "legitimate" power to make
it illegal for all women?
Furthermore, as dissenting Justice John Paul S:evens wrote, the
Medicaid program was started in 1965 to give money to people
"who satisfy two neutral categories — financial need and medical
need." In creating this one exception for abortion, the court has
prevented poor women from exercising a constitutional right to
have an operation, perhaps one that is medically necessary.
What options does the Court leave available to an unmarried
woman who discovers today that she is pregnant? If she is wealthy,
she could bring the pregnancy to term or she could go to a reputable
hospital and pay for an abortion.
If she is poor, she can have the child at no cost for the delivery.
Unfortunately, unwanted children may be beaten, neglected or
abandoned. More likely, she will try to find someone to perform an
abortion cheaply, or she may try to induce a miscarriage herself.
We find this appalling inequality unjustifiable. In this case, the
court has shown itself, as Southern Christian Leadership Confer
ence President Joseph Lowry said, to be "insensitive to the plight of
the poor."
We agree.
