## Profit from guns or plowshares 
### 
19K0 could prove to be
another record breaking year for
the international arms business.
A record $25 billion in arms
were sold in 1979, one fourth
more than in 197 N. President
Jimmy Carter has approved a
$3.7 billion arms package for
Egypt and Israel. Saudi Arabia
was given a controversial $4 bill
ion arms deal that included
sophisticated F-16 fighters. In
addition, three new customers
(North Yemen, Oman and Su
dan) have begun purchasing
arms from the U.S.
All this is strong stuff for an
administration that blocked over
a billion dollars worth of arms
sales in 1978. In his 1976 cam
paign, Carter pledged that he
would reduce U.S. arms sales
particularly to unstable regions
of the world.

He naively hoped that by beat
ing U.S. swords into plowshares
other countries might be per
suaded to reduce their arms sales
as well. It has obviously failed.
Insecurity in the Middle East
after the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan, the capture of the
Sacred Mosque in Saudi Arabia
by Moslem fanatics and the Rus
sian role in South Yemen and
Ethiopia have brought new fears
to oil rich countries that see
themselves as defenseless.
Carter is trying hard to main
tain old friendships in the Middle
East after the ouster of the Shah
of Iran and amidst a growing un
easiness among other countries
that perceive the United States
as uncertain and impotent.
The rush to sell swords to
these countries has in part been
encouraged by the refusal of the

Carter administration to sell
plowshares. The U.S. firms that
sell those plowshares must face
an array of restrictions that limit
their competitiveness abroad.
In the hottest construction
market in the world (the Middle
East), U.S. contractors netted
only 1.6 percent of new construc
tion dollars spent between June
of 1978 and June of 1979, put
ting them in twelfth place in
Mideast construction contracts.
Lacking the ability to sell glass,
concrete and steel, the U.S. has
turned to fighter jets and guns.
While Jimmy Carter's
moralism has largely vanished
from U.S. arms policy, it is still
firmly in place in corrupt
business laws that forbid over
seas kickbacks and payoffs.
Foreign competitors in the rest
of the world where such tactics
are the accepted practice suffer
no such restrictions.
U.S. tax policies are unusually
unfair. The U.S. is the only
major exporting country that
taxes its expatriate workers'
foreign income on top of the
taxes imposed by the host coun
try. According to one construc
tion firm, while a foreign com
petitor could pay a salary of
$36,000 to a manager in the
Middle East, a U.S. firm would
have to pay him over $60,000 for
him to take home the* same
amount of money after taxes.
In the tradeoff between guns
and plowshares, selling guns has
always been easy. Selling plow
shares is a subtler art, one that
the Carter administration has
discouraged.

class of 79 and will be a graduate
student in politics at Princeton
next fall.)
