## Jimmy Harrow Separate California in two parts 
### 
Northern Californians are
often fond of talking about how
great it would be if California
were divided into a northern and
southern half. They have a great
distaste for Southern California,
its smog, its hordes of people, its
overdevelopment and its de
struction of its environment.
Now, the talk about dividing
the state has become more seri
ous in tone. Los Angeles, in its
greed for more water, has begun
the destruction of the northern
half of the state. First it was the
picturesque Owens Valley, now
it is the salty waters of Mono
Lake and soon it shall be the
mighty Sacramento delta and the
San Francisco Bav environment.

Legislation has recently been
passed that will provide for more
water to be diverted from the
Sacramento River into the
California Aquaduct on its jour
ney to Southern California.
Northerners have a right to be
concerned. One direct result of
the Peripheral Canal legislation
is that water costs to delta far
mers will increase. This means
that the cost to the consumer of
summer crops such as almonds,
corn, tomatoes and pears will in
crease also. The delta farmers
produce over $600 million in
produce each year.
Worse yet from the north
erner's perspective is that the
physical structure to divert even

larger amounts of water from the
delta will be constructed. What
will happen when the state ex
periences another severe
drought? Who will get the first
claim on the water resources of
the northern part of the state?
These questions are real. The
fears they raise are equally real.
Southern California has begun
what Ray Dasmann long ago
feared: the destruction of
California. Now is the time to
begin the separatist movement
and to legally free the north from
the economic and political
stranglehold of the menacing
south.
