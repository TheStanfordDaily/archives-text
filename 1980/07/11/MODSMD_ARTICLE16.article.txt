## Reagan a laugherist in campaign 
### 
As one who in the past has
supported Ronald Reagan both
for his efforts on behalf of Re
publican presidential candidate
Barry Goldwater in 1964, and in
his subsequent campaigns for
governor of California, it is with
considerable disillusionment
that 1 find myself hoping for his
defeat this November.
Heretofore I have left it to
those more impressed than my
self with liberal dogma to de
plore Reagan's politics. This
year, however, liberal arguments
seem to be failing to defeat him.
"The Reagan candidacy," ob

serves one liberal senator," is the
result of the bankruptcy of
liberalism."
But if liberalism is bankrupt,
so too, 1 suspect, is Reaganism.
Indeed, Mr. Reagan's economic
proposals fail to meet the very
first test of avoiding bankruptcy:
his numbers do not add up. At
one time he proposes to balance
the budget, cut taxes, and boost
defense spending.
This is possible only if one ac
cepts the questionable theory of
Arthur Laffer, that reducing
taxes will generate increased
government revenue. That few
serious economists take Laf
ferism seriously is perhaps less
remarkable than that Reagan
himself has embraced the totally
contradictory notion that the
purpose of tax cuts is to force
reduced government spending.
Reagan's opinions on energy
are no less unsound. Citing
grossly exaggerated estimates of
the amount of recoverable oil in
the United States, Reagan scoffs
at the idea that Americans
should be less profligate in their
consumption of energy. The
thoughtless destruction of
natural resources, a theme of
conservatives since the days of
Burke and de Tocqueville, is of no
apparent concern to him.
It is not Reagan but Anderson
who recognizes that energy is a
root cause of our current
economic problems. It is Ander
son who calls for a gas tax, while
Reagan backpedals on free
market principles to bail out the
automotive industry. It is Ander
son who stresses the need for in
creased savings and investment
to bolster productivity, while
Reagan fishes for votes, like a
latter-day Democrat with inane
promises of tax cuts.
It is Anderson, not Reagan,
who understands the strategic
implications of the energy crisis.
When the greatest single threat
to our national security would
seem to be our dependence on
Mideast oil, Reagan harps on
Taiwan and Panama.
Even though it would seem
that any military action would
only destroy our oil lifeline and
that the battleground would be
highly advantageous to the
Soviets, Reagan wants to pour
billions of dollars into advanced
weapons systems instead of
energy conservation.
Reagan compounds his lack of
strategic vision with a parochial
sense of national interest that
does violence to the ideals of
freedom on which our country

was founded. When Reagan
speaks of our "vital interests" in
the Mideast, the Arabs may be
sure that it is not their liberty, but
their resources which interest
him.
One finds in Thucydides this
warning to the ancient Athe
nians: "What you do not realize
is that your empire is a tyranny
exercised over subjects who do
not like it." One fails to detect in
Reagan's support for the former
Shah of Iran and former Nicara
guan President Anastasio
Somoza that sense of history re
quired to spare us the fate of the
Athenian League.
All this is not to say that
Reagan is without his virtues. He
is a nice man, but so was Warren
Harding. He was not a bad gov
ernor, but neither was Jimmy
Carter. He has no illusions about
the Soviets but, unlike Ander
son, did not have the courage to
support the grain embargo.
Most importantly, Reagan is
vocal in his support of less gov
ernment and more freedom. Un
fortunately, however, his sup
port for individual freedom is
circumscribed by his New Right
constituency.
He is hostile to non-traditional
life styles, would prohibit
marijuana and abortion, and
would enhance F. 8.1, and C.I.A.
surveillance. It is not Reagan,
but Ed Clark, the Libertarian
nominee, who offers the voters a
principled stand for individual
freedom and rights.
Nor does Reagan offer a
realistic alternative to Carter's
incompetence. His political con
stituency is narrow and he has
done little to broaden it in his
choice of issues: the Panama
Canal and abortion seem some
how unlikely to determine the
fundamental course of events in
the 1980s.
If Reagan were elected, there
is little reason to believe that he
would be able to halt the cancer
ous growth of government in
Washington any more than he
did in Sacramento. Far more
likely, he would quickly be as
discredited as Jimmy Carter, and
the nation would be clamoring
tor Ted Kennedy.
Those of us who favor free
market principles might be wise
to spare Reagan the indignity of
the White House; better to let
Anderson or Jimmy take the
flak.
