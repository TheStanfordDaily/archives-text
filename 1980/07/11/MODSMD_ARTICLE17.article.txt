## Disarmament needed 
### 
In my last column (Daily, June
27) I argued that our present
nuclear defense policy is ethi
cally unacceptable.
We cannot threaten the entire
Soviet population with our nuc
lear arsenal just because we are
afraid of the potential actions of
a few Russian officials. And we,
in turn, should not be hounded
by the threat of extinction be
cause of the potential actions of
President Jimmy Carter or
Ronald Reagan, or son\p crazy
submarine commander.
Ethically, I believe our only
acceptable nuclear defense is
one of disarmament. We must
begin to unilaterally disarm.
History has proven that the
United States has been the lead
ing country in the arms race. We
were the first to develop the
atom bomb, the hydrogen bomb,
M.I.R.V.s, and we will undoub
tedly be the first to deploy the
M.X. and cruise missiles. The
Soviet Union has followed in our
footsteps always— usually some
four or five years later.
This trend is known as the
"action-reaction cycle." Most
likely it is reversible and would
work toward bilateral disarma
ment.
Now let's pursue the issue
more philosophically. It would
be highly beneficial for the
U.S.S.R. to follow our disarma
ment initiative. An arms race is
economically devastating — not
to mention the price of an actual
war — to all parties involved.
The M.X. program alone will
cost us at least $30 billion, and
the burden is put on the Soviets
to follow.
Besides these heavy financial
burdens, a spiraling arms race
may be devastating in other
ways. The increased chances of a
nuclear accident or war escalate
rapidly as the race continues.
Our present "negotiation
from strength' 1 policy is just a
euphemism for the making of

nuclear threats which make us
look aggressive and increase the
chances of war.
The potential for economic
welfare, the increased trade and
the greatly decreased chances of
being blown off the face of the
earth would be too much for the
Soviet Union to pass up by not
joining us in disarming.
Because they have always con
sidered us the aggressors, they
would feel no need to launch an
attack against us should we dis
arm. It would only cause need
less destruction and greatly
hamper their trade and the
world's finite resources. It would
make no sense for them to at
tack.
Ethically, our only viable al
ternative is to disarm. I think that
realistically this is our only op
tion as well. We need not disarm
completely at first. But unilateral
disarmament, in hopes that it will
lead to bilateral and (let's not
forget China and Europe) mul
tilateral disarmament, is the
most humane option available to
us at this time.
The famous "Damoclean"
speech that President John F.
Kennedy delivered to the United
Nations against a background of
heightened international tension
nearly 20 years ago (Sept. 25,
1961) is still extremely relevant:
"Today, every inhabitant of
this planet must contemplate the
day when this planet may no
longer be habitable. Every man,
woman and child lives under a
nuclear sword of Damocles,
hanging by the slenderest of
threads, capable of being cut at
any moment by accident or mis
calculation or by madness ....
"The events and decisions of
the next ten months may well de
cide the fate of man for the next
ten thousand years."
