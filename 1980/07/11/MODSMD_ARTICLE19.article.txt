Anderson consistent
David Miller's article (Daily,
July 1) totally misrepresented
independent presidential candi
date John Anderson.
Miller, like all Anderson's cri
tics, harped on the Con
gressman's religious fervor of
1961 and, like the others, Miller
neglects to mention that Ander
son was the first to criticize this
aspect of himself. He freely ad
mits his mistaken conception of
religion in government and his
foolishness as a first-year Con
gressman.
More revealing, however, is
Miller's confused and contradic
tory description of Anderson's
voter appeal. He notes that
"Anderson has yet to capture the
heart of the average steelworker
in Pittsburgh, or the cotton
farmer in Mississippi, or the
truck driver in California." Then
Miller calls the Congressman "a
midwestern preacherman."
Anderson appeals to the
minds of the educated middle
and upper classes first precisely
because he does not preach, does
not indulge in empty yet
frighteningly effective political
platitudes. He tells you what's on
his mind in concrete terms, in
dollars and cents plans. This is
not what the American public is
used to, but that is neither An
derson's fault nor the public's. It
is the effect mass media has had
on American democracy.
Anderson has been entirely
consistent with himself. Miller
needs to learn the difference be
tween this and strict adherence

to ideological dogma, be it lib
eral or conservative. It is in
teresting to note that Miller, a
Libertarian, does not appreciate
Anderson's stands for women's
rights,against the draft (contrary
to Miller's contention) and for
both decreased federal spending
and federal regulation.
In addition to "Why not the
Best?," Anderson's campaign
literature lists these specific
stands that the congressman has
taken and suggests that we
"think about the issues and vote
for John Anderson." This is not
liberalism, conservatism, or
libertarianism; it is just rational
ity, finally, in politics.

Bird a religious symbol
1 would like to bring to the
attention of your readers the
meaning of the following "bird
design" used as a decorative
motif in your"Bay Area Events"
section on June 4.
On behalf of the Stanford Ba
ha'i community I would like to
point out that although the de
sign seems to have been taken
out of a book of logos and
designs, it has a particular religi
ous significance to Baha'is.
This calligraphic bird design
was penned by Mishkin Qalam.a

well-known Baha'i calligraphist
of the 19th century. This design
is an artistic arrangement of the
phrase " Bismi'llahi'l
Bahiyyi'l-Abha" which means
"In the name of God, the Glori
ous, the Most Glorious."

In (he words of a Baha'i scho
lar it describes a "bird of
paradise in the form of the
Greatest Holy Name (the name
of God) sitting on the tree of
Touba (tree of paradise) ... an
art form found in many Baha'i
houses . . . framed and hung in a
place of honor."
