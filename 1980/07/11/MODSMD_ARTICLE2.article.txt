# University to defy labor ruling
## 
### Jim Harrow Staff Writer 
The University has refused to
comply with a State Labor
Commissioner's decision that
University employees, who walk
off the job because of a concern
over health and safety condi
tions, are entitled to be paid.
The case (Britlon el a I v. Stan
ford University) involved five
computer operators who were
forced to occupy the partially
completed Center for Informa
tion Building (CIT) during June
of 1979.
Citing numerous safety viola
tions, Bob Britton, computer
operator at CIT, and four other
employees walked out June
24-26. Britton said the Univer
sity "was in violation of the per
mit requirements to occupy the
building. He cited such hazards
as the lack of fire alarms in the
building, holes in the floor where
the IBM computer was housed,
water leaking under the floor,
inadequate ventilation and a
dust problem from sandblasting.
The workers had requested
and received a safety inspection
by the Joint Safety Committee,
who also found the building un
safe.
The Safety Committee is com
posed of six union represent
tivcs and six management per
sonnel who issue an advisory re
port to management.
After three days of hearings,
Labor Commissioner Ray Bredy
determined that "those
safety and health conditions
were such as to cause concern,
and there was justification tor
the workers to refuse to work. 1
The University was then directed
to pay $600 in back wages and
for time the workers spent at
tending the hearings.
The University then chal
lenged the decision by refusing
to pay. The state in return pro
ceeded to prosecute the Univer
sity in Superior Court.
University Associate Counsel
Ross Campbell, who rep

resented Stanford in the case,
claims that the issue is not one of
money. Rather it is under what
circumstances a worker is jus
tified in his or her refusal to
work.
There must be "a real and ap
parent hazard to the employee
that is sufficient to justify refusal
to work. We don't want it to be
that a worker can be 'concerned'
and just walk off the job, he
said.
Leo Seidlitz who represented
the employees at the hearing dis
agreed with Campbell. He said
the real issue is that "Stanford
insists on the right to decide for
itself whether the working condi
tions are safe or not."

By withholding payment,
Stanford has violated Section
6311 of the California Labor
Code which says workers can re
fuse to work under unsafe condi
tions and not be discriminated
against, added Seidlitz.
USE grievance
The United Stanford
Employees (USE) Local 680
filed a grievance to ask that the
workers who walked off the job
be reimbursed for the time of the
walkout and for the time spent at
the hearing.
An arbiter, Arman Garsa
mian, has been selected, and the
case will be heard next Monday
and Tuesday on campus. This
