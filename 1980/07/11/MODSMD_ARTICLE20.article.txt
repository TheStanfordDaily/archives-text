# Pentagon wishes to increase funds given for research
## 
### Debbie Walker 
There was a time when the
mention of research funded by
the Pentagon inspired visions of
university scientists building
deadly weapons in secret
laboratories.
At Stanford, however, and at
most universities, classified re
search and weapons research
have been illegal since the early
'70s when strong feelings about
the Vietnam War brought an end
to the previously amicable rela
tionship between many univer
sity scientists and the Pentagon.
Now, five years after Vietnam,
the Pentagon is cautiously trying
to reestablish those friendly ties.
According to a May article in
the New York Times, the Penta
gon will probably provide over
$650 million for research in
1981, of which more than 40 per
cent will be available to
academic institutions.
The Times article cited in
stances of Defense Department
officials visiting campuses all
over the country offering funds
for various forms of basic re
search. It also referred to the
competition between several
universities for the $200 million
Congress has authorized the
Pentagon to funnel into its very
high-speed integrated circuits
program.
Gerald Lieberman, vice pro
vost and dean of research, said
he did not foresee any dramatic
changes in the research going on
at Stanford as a result of this
trend in the Defense Depart
ment's policy.
Lieberman acknowledged,
however, that the Department of
Defense would very much like to
"woo colleges and universities
back into the fold.
"They recognize that research
is terribly important to the de
velopment of the technological
capability of this country,"
Lieberman said. "They will not
look to the University to develop

weapons, but to further basic sci
ence."
Lieberman said that over time
the amount of funding provided
to researchers at Stanford has
remained fairly constant. There
was a major cutback between
1971 and 1973 when the Univer
sity banned classified research,
but since then there have been
no major decreases or increases.
In 1976 Pentagon funding
comprised 7.9 per cent of Stan
ford's total research volume, and
in 1979 it made up 8.2 percent of
the total.
Though there has been an in
crease in actual dollars — $7.6
million in 1976 and $ 11.6 mill
ion in 1979 — this has been con
sistent with the increased fund
ing provided by other sources.
Lieberman said that condi
tions under which defense funds
are used are comparable to those
under which funding provided by
such agencies as the Department
of Energy or the National Sci
ence Foundation are employed.
"The procedure is the same,"
Lieberman said. "A research
proposal is prepared and submit
ted to one of the agencies. If they
are found worthwhile, they are
funded, but the agency has no
control over what the resear
chers do beyond what the resear
chers themselves have proposed
to do."
Lieberman added that funding
would not be accepted for any
project that is inconsistent with
the University's standards.
It is also illegal for any re
searcher to conduct a project
secretly.
The University has adopted a
Statement of Principles Con
cerning Research which states
that "the principle of openness in
research — the principle of free
dom of access by all interested
persons to the underlying data,
to the processes and to the final
results of research — is one of
overriding importance."
