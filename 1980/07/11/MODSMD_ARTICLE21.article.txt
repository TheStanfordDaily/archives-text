# Vitamin C inhibits cancer Pauling asserts in speech
## 
### Edward Asiano 
Dr. Linus Pauling, speaking before an over
flow crowd Wednesday, explained his theories
of vitamin C as a curing agent for cancer and
other infectious diseases.
Pauling, a distinguished scientist and two
time Nobel Prize winner, asserted, "large doses
of vitamin C should he taken by 98 percent of
the population."
The professor emeritus of Stanford spoke at
the 17th annual Stanford-NASA-ASEE
Aerospace Technology Seminar being held
every Wednesday through August 6th.
In a highly technical speech, Pauling, profes
sing his controversial ideas on vitamin C,
explained how he and his associate Dr. Ewan
Cameron have achieved success in treating ter
minally ill cancer patients. In some cases, "un
beatable" patients, expected to live only
months, have survived over eight years.
Research being conducted at the Linus Paul
ing Institute of Science and Medicine, located in
Menlo Park, has been inconclusive. Dr. Arthur
Robinson, former president and director of the
Institute and a co-founder in 1973, was fired by
Pauling in 1978 over experiments that indicated
vitamin C in small doses increased the fre
quency of cancer in mice.
Robinson is suing the five trustees of the In
stitute, including Pauling, his former professor,
for $25.5 million.
In addition, Robinson filed a slander suit
against G. Richard Hicks, the Institute's execu
tive vice president. Hicks, a one time officer of
Dean Whitter Reynolds and former fund-raiser
for the Institute, is accused of describing Robin
son slanderously as physically dangerous, in
competent and crooked.
The conflict arose over a series of experi
ments Robinson says he designed and managed.
They involved 900 mice induced with a kind of
skin cancer. He fed one group the usual mouse
food; a second only raw fruits and vegetables; a
third ate the raw foods and heavy doses of vita
min C, and so on, with variation for 12 more
groups.
Robinson, a proponent of raw food and veg
etable diets, found the mice on that diet signific
antly reduced the number of cancerous sores.
The mice fed raw fruits and vegetables along
with massive amounts of vitamin C had results
Robinson described as, "just fantastic."
After three months, the control groupfed just
mouse food, had an average of 49.6 cancerous
lesions; the vitamin C fortified vegetarians av

eraged only 1.4 lesions. But mice on a regular
diet supplemented by the equivalent of 10
grams, the dose Pauling recommends, suffered
higher numbers of lesions, 61.4, than the con
trol group. A group where vitamin C was re
duced even further, to only three grams a day,
suffered an average 82.3 lesions.
Robinson admits the tests are incomplete but
alarmed at the results, he says, "this is work that
no scientist should sit on."
Pauling described the experiments as
amateurish and stated, "none of our work is
ready for publication as yet, and it would be
quite improper of me . . . to discuss any of the
preliminary findings."

The Mayo Clinic also has done testing on the
effects of vitamin C on human cancer patients,
and found no effect of lengthening or improving
of the lives of the victims. The testing at the Mayo
Clinic was of the double blind control variety, a
scientifically respected test that requires a con
trol group receiving no treatment.
Pauling responding to criticism that Dr.
Cameron, the co-author of their book, does not
attempt a double blind test, said, "he is so con
vinced of it's (vitamin Cs) effects, his ethical
principals would not allow him to withhold
treatment to half the patients."
The essence of Pauling's theories is blas
togenisis, the increase of lymphasites which do
battle in the bloodstream against milignant
cells. The strengthening of Colygin, the rein
forcement of the cellular cement, also prevents
cancerous cells from spreading.
Pauling himself states, "in general 1 don t
know why vitamin C does the things it does,'
but he says to get "good ideas, you have a lot of
ideas and throw out the bad ones."

The essence of Pauling's theories is blas
togenisis, the increase of lymphasites which do
battle in the bloodstream against milignant
cells. The strengthening of Colygin, the rein
forcement of the cellular cement, also prevents
cancerous cells from spreading.
Pauling himself states, "in general 1 don t
know why vitamin C does the things it does,'
but he says to get "good ideas, you have a lot of
ideas and throw out the bad ones."

Dr. Linus Pauling, speaking before an over
flow crowd Wednesday, explained his theories
of vitamin C as a curing agent for cancer and
other infectious diseases.
Pauling, a distinguished scientist and two
time Nobel Prize winner, asserted, "large doses
of vitamin C should he taken by 98 percent of
the population."
The professor emeritus of Stanford spoke at
the 17th annual Stanford-NASA-ASEE
Aerospace Technology Seminar being held
every Wednesday through August 6th.
In a highly technical speech, Pauling, profes
sing his controversial ideas on vitamin C,
explained how he and his associate Dr. Ewan
Cameron have achieved success in treating ter
minally ill cancer patients. In some cases, "un
beatable" patients, expected to live only
months, have survived over eight years.
Research being conducted at the Linus Paul
ing Institute of Science and Medicine, located in
Menlo Park, has been inconclusive. Dr. Arthur
Robinson, former president and director of the
Institute and a co-founder in 1973, was fired by
Pauling in 1978 over experiments that indicated
vitamin C in small doses increased the fre
quency of cancer in mice.
Robinson is suing the five trustees of the In
stitute, including Pauling, his former professor,
for $25.5 million.
In addition, Robinson filed a slander suit
against G. Richard Hicks, the Institute's execu
tive vice president. Hicks, a one time officer of
Dean Whitter Reynolds and former fund-raiser
for the Institute, is accused of describing Robin
son slanderously as physically dangerous, in
competent and crooked.
The conflict arose over a series of experi
ments Robinson says he designed and managed.
They involved 900 mice induced with a kind of
skin cancer. He fed one group the usual mouse
food; a second only raw fruits and vegetables; a
third ate the raw foods and heavy doses of vita
min C, and so on, with variation for 12 more
groups.
Robinson, a proponent of raw food and veg
etable diets, found the mice on that diet signific
antly reduced the number of cancerous sores.
The mice fed raw fruits and vegetables along
with massive amounts of vitamin C had results
Robinson described as, "just fantastic."
After three months, the control groupfed just
mouse food, had an average of 49.6 cancerous
lesions; the vitamin C fortified vegetarians av

eraged only 1.4 lesions. But mice on a regular
diet supplemented by the equivalent of 10
grams, the dose Pauling recommends, suffered
higher numbers of lesions, 61.4, than the con
trol group. A group where vitamin C was re
duced even further, to only three grams a day,
suffered an average 82.3 lesions.
Robinson admits the tests are incomplete but
alarmed at the results, he says, "this is work that
no scientist should sit on."
Pauling described the experiments as
amateurish and stated, "none of our work is
ready for publication as yet, and it would be
quite improper of me . . . to discuss any of the
preliminary findings."

The Mayo Clinic also has done testing on the
effects of vitamin C on human cancer patients,
and found no effect of lengthening or improving
of the lives of the victims. The testing at the Mayo
Clinic was of the double blind control variety, a
scientifically respected test that requires a con
trol group receiving no treatment.
Pauling responding to criticism that Dr.
Cameron, the co-author of their book, does not
attempt a double blind test, said, "he is so con
vinced of it's (vitamin Cs) effects, his ethical
principals would not allow him to withhold
treatment to half the patients."
The essence of Pauling's theories is blas
togenisis, the increase of lymphasites which do
battle in the bloodstream against milignant
cells. The strengthening of Colygin, the rein
forcement of the cellular cement, also prevents
cancerous cells from spreading.
Pauling himself states, "in general 1 don t
know why vitamin C does the things it does,'
but he says to get "good ideas, you have a lot of
ideas and throw out the bad ones."
