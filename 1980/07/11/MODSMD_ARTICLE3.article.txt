# Vice-consul is ill
## Iran to release a hostage 
### Associated Press 
Iran announced yesterday that
it will free Vice-consul Richard
Queen, one of 53 American hos
tages held since Nov. 4, because
of illness, and return him to his
family.
Tehran radio said Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini ordered
Queen, 28, of Lincolnville,
Maine, released "due to the
humane teachings of Islam"
after Khomeini learned from
militants at the occupied U.S.
Embassy that he "has been hos
pitalized in one of Tehran's hos
pitals."
Word of Queen's pending re
lease came several hours after
the Iranian government an
nounced it had crushed an at
tempted coup. The United States
and Iraq were blamed for the
attempt.
The nature of Queen's illness
was not described, but the radio
broadcast quoted Khomeini's of
fice as saying Iranian specialists
conducted several examinations
and"reached the conclusion that
he should be transferred to one

of the countries enjoying better
medical facilities."
The broadcast originally iden
tified the hostage as Queen, but
translators later changed the
name to Richard Owen. The
U.S. State Department said no
one named Richard Owen was
among the hostages.
Both a Richard Owen and
Richard Queen are among the
53 hostages on a list compiled by
the Associated Press. If Owen is
not a hostage, it raises the possi
bility there arc 52 hostages, not
53 as previously believed.

State Department officials in
Washington could not confirm
that any of the hostages would be
released, but said they were "ur
gently checking the report" and
had notified Queen's parents,
Jeanne and Harold Queen, who
moved to Lincolnville; Maine,
from Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., in
December.
President Carter said in An
chorage, Alaska," If it is true and
if he is well after adequate treat
ment, we will be thankful The
proper thing for the terrorists to
do is to release all the hostages."
Queen's mother was one of
three hostage relatives who
traveled to Europe in April to
urge Europeans to write letters
to Iranian authorities urging re
lease of the hostges.
Queen's release was ordered
in a letter to Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, Tehran
radio said. The broadcast gave
no indication whether the re
lease signaled a change in policy
toward the hostages.
