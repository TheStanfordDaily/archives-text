## Jonathan Richman to play at Tresidder Saturday nite 
### 
Beserkley recording artist Jonathan Richman,
formerly of Jonathan Richman and the Modern
Lovers, will make a solo performance at the Tre
sidder Lounge tomorrow night at 8 p.m. as part of
his summer-long tour.
Richman has recorded five (soon to be six) al
bums on the Beserkley label. Probably his most
well known song, which he recorded with the Mod
ern Lovers, is the classic " Roadrunner," part of
Greg Kihn's repertoire for some time.
Born in Boston, Richman began to play the
guitar at age 15. When he was 17 he started playing
in public as a single.
"1 used to play on the Cambridge Commons,
along with other local talent," he says,"and 1
talked the guy into letting me play a few numbers
between groups. 1 played very loud at that time and
I often just made up songs as 1 went along . . . 1
thought I was very romantic but some didn't."
Richman claims he isn't "new wave" per se, but
will admit that some new artists may have been
influenced by his work.

Thought not possessing one of the prettier voices
around, Richman has an inate ability to gain and
maintain a very high level of energy during his
shows, especially when you consider that it's just
one guy and one guitar up there.
Richman is also well known for his bizarre sense
of humor which is incorporated into his music.
Songs like "Abominable Snowman in the Market,"
"Egyptian Reggae," "Here Come the Martian
Martians" and "Nature's Mosquito" are among his
weirdest, and best songs.
It was in Europe that the Modern Lovers split
up. And it was there that Richman decided he
wanted to be a solo act.
"I put across the songs better alone," Richman
explains. "I use a band on records because the
people can't see me."
It you would like a chance to see Richman, tic
kets are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office for
$5. There will also be some tickets available at the
door.
