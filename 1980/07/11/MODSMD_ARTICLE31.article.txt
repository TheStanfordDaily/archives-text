## The 						'Stones' worst ever? 
### 
Emotional Rescue
The Rolling Stones
Rolling Stones Records
The title track of an album, it
seems, is as good a place as any to
begin a review.
In the case of the newly re
leased Emotional Rescue, by the
Rolling Stones, I laughed out
loud the first time I heard the
title track. This is known as a bad
sign.
Mick Jagger's ridiculous
falsetto — it's too much. Charlie
Watt's tinny little drum line —
it's saddening. Bill Wyman's
thumping bass, which actually
isn't bad, becomes barely notice
able behind Jagger's voice and a
muddled organ part. Same with
Keith Richard'sguitar.lt'sthere,
but it takes a pair of headphones
and lots of volume to really hear
it.
The lyrics to "Emotional Re
scue," which sounds like Smokey
Robinson on acid, are mostly
mindless, so I'll leave them
alone.

So the title track is bad — not a
cardinal sin. How about the rest
of the album?
Fortunately, it sounds nothing
like the title track. Unfortu
natelv, most of it is just about as
bad.
About half of the album's
material is remotely like the
'Stones last lp, Some Girls. Ap
parently, much of Emotional Re
scue was recorded in the same
sessions as Some Girls. That
would explain why.
It's too bad the 'Stones have to
put rejects from their previous
album on their new one, but
that's showbiz, 1 suppose.
There are 10 songs on Emo
tional Rescue. Four of them
might, under some cir
cumstances, be considered good.
Certainly none of them will ever
be considered as among the
'Stones best. Or even near-best.
The album's four best songs,
we shall say then are,"Send ItTo
Me," "Indian Girl," "Down in
the Hole," and "All About
You."

The first, a sort of reggae
shuffle, is hinged on a solid,
steady drum beat. Ron Wood's
rhythm guitar carries the song's
pleasant melody. Richards chips
in for a few short little solo licks,
and Jagger's voice is bearable, if
not uninspired.
"Indian Girl" is a country
western-type ballad that sounds
an awful lot like "I Only Want
To Be Your Friend" on It's Only
Rock'n'Roll. The song gets a lit
tle tedious, though, especially
when you realize that its only
message is that "life keeps on
going on, getting harder and
harder."
"Down In The Hole" is an
all-out blues number, complete
with harmonica, "pained"
guitars and lyrics about being out
on the street "bumming for
cigarettes." It's not bad, but Jag
ger is just not convincing. He
sounds as if he's "faking" the
blues, which one should never
do.
Finally, there is "All About
You," the last song on the al
bum. This, which features
Richards on lead vocals, is like a
combination of "Indian Girl"
and "Down in the Hole." It's a
country-ish blues song, and
Richards handles it very well. He
really does sound blue. Given the
trouble he's had with the law
lately, that is perfectly under
standable.
So where do the 'Stones go
from here? Their new album is
clearly a step down from any
thing they have ever done. Oh,
they've made some bad records
in the past. Some say they ha
ven't come up with a good one
since Exile on Main Street.
Maybe they haven't, but Emo
tional Rescue pales in compari-

DO NOT
RUN ALONE

son to anything the 'Stones have
ever made.
Was '78's Some Girls, which
most critics regarded as the
band's best in a long while, just
lucky? Have the 'Stones gone
into an irreversalbe tailspin?
I believe they have. In all the
Rolling Stones' efforts to be dif
ferent, they have run themselves
into a dead-end. Some Girls was
witty and pretty imaginative.
Emotional Rescue is not. It is re
petitive and boring.
It's a shame, but it's the truth.
Maybe the 'Stones should pack it
up; disband. Then at least we
wouldn't have to watch a group
that should be remembered for
excellence embarrass themselves
with trash like this.

The title track of an album, it
seems, is as good a place as any to
begin a review.
In the case of the newly re
leased Emotional Rescue, by the
Rolling Stones, I laughed out
loud the first time I heard the
title track. This is known as a bad
sign.
Mick Jagger's ridiculous
falsetto — it's too much. Charlie
Watt's tinny little drum line —
it's saddening. Bill Wyman's
thumping bass, which actually
isn't bad, becomes barely notice
able behind Jagger's voice and a
muddled organ part. Same with
Keith Richard'sguitar.lt'sthere,
but it takes a pair of headphones
and lots of volume to really hear
it.
The lyrics to "Emotional Re
scue," which sounds like Smokey
Robinson on acid, are mostly
mindless, so I'll leave them
alone.

So the title track is bad — not a
cardinal sin. How about the rest
of the album?
Fortunately, it sounds nothing
like the title track. Unfortu
natelv, most of it is just about as
bad.
About half of the album's
material is remotely like the
'Stones last lp, Some Girls. Ap
parently, much of Emotional Re
scue was recorded in the same
sessions as Some Girls. That
would explain why.
It's too bad the 'Stones have to
put rejects from their previous
album on their new one, but
that's showbiz, 1 suppose.
There are 10 songs on Emo
tional Rescue. Four of them
might, under some cir
cumstances, be considered good.
Certainly none of them will ever
be considered as among the
'Stones best. Or even near-best.
The album's four best songs,
we shall say then are,"Send ItTo
Me," "Indian Girl," "Down in
the Hole," and "All About
You."

The first, a sort of reggae
shuffle, is hinged on a solid,
steady drum beat. Ron Wood's
rhythm guitar carries the song's
pleasant melody. Richards chips
in for a few short little solo licks,
and Jagger's voice is bearable, if
not uninspired.
"Indian Girl" is a country
western-type ballad that sounds
an awful lot like "I Only Want
To Be Your Friend" on It's Only
Rock'n'Roll. The song gets a lit
tle tedious, though, especially
when you realize that its only
message is that "life keeps on
going on, getting harder and
harder."
"Down In The Hole" is an
all-out blues number, complete
with harmonica, "pained"
guitars and lyrics about being out
on the street "bumming for
cigarettes." It's not bad, but Jag
ger is just not convincing. He
sounds as if he's "faking" the
blues, which one should never
do.
Finally, there is "All About
You," the last song on the al
bum. This, which features
Richards on lead vocals, is like a
combination of "Indian Girl"
and "Down in the Hole." It's a
country-ish blues song, and
Richards handles it very well. He
really does sound blue. Given the
trouble he's had with the law
lately, that is perfectly under
standable.
So where do the 'Stones go
from here? Their new album is
clearly a step down from any
thing they have ever done. Oh,
they've made some bad records
in the past. Some say they ha
ven't come up with a good one
since Exile on Main Street.
Maybe they haven't, but Emo
tional Rescue pales in compari-

DO NOT
RUN ALONE

son to anything the 'Stones have
ever made.
Was '78's Some Girls, which
most critics regarded as the
band's best in a long while, just
lucky? Have the 'Stones gone
into an irreversalbe tailspin?
I believe they have. In all the
Rolling Stones' efforts to be dif
ferent, they have run themselves
into a dead-end. Some Girls was
witty and pretty imaginative.
Emotional Rescue is not. It is re
petitive and boring.
It's a shame, but it's the truth.
Maybe the 'Stones should pack it
up; disband. Then at least we
wouldn't have to watch a group
that should be remembered for
excellence embarrass themselves
with trash like this.
