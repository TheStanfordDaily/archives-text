## The
						'Stones' worst ever? 
### 
Emotional Rescue
The Rolling Stones
Rolling Stones Records
The title track of an album, it
seems, is as good a place as any to
begin a review.
In the case of the newly re
leased Emotional Rescue, by the
Rolling Stones, I laughed out
loud the first time I heard the
title track. This is known as a bad
sign.
Mick Jagger's ridiculous
falsetto — it's too much. Charlie
Watt's tinny little drum line —
it's saddening. Bill Wyman's
thumping bass, which actually
isn't bad, becomes barely notice
able behind Jagger's voice and a
muddled organ part. Same with
Keith Richard'sguitar.lt'sthere,
but it takes a pair of headphones
and lots of volume to really hear
it.
The lyrics to "Emotional Re
scue," which sounds like Smokey
Robinson on acid, are mostly
mindless, so I'll leave them
alone.

So the title track is bad — not a
cardinal sin. How about the rest
of the album?
Fortunately, it sounds nothing
like the title track. Unfortu
natelv, most of it is just about as
bad.
About half of the album's
material is remotely like the
'Stones last lp, Some Girls. Ap
parently, much of Emotional Re
scue was recorded in the same
sessions as Some Girls. That
would explain why.
It's too bad the 'Stones have to
put rejects from their previous
album on their new one, but
that's showbiz, 1 suppose.
There are 10 songs on Emo
tional Rescue. Four of them
might, under some cir
cumstances, be considered good.
Certainly none of them will ever
be considered as among the
'Stones best. Or even near-best.
The album's four best songs,
we shall say then are,"Send ItTo
Me," "Indian Girl," "Down in
the Hole," and "All About
You."

The first, a sort of reggae
shuffle, is hinged on a solid,
steady drum beat. Ron Wood's
rhythm guitar carries the song's
pleasant melody. Richards chips
in for a few short little solo licks,
and Jagger's voice is bearable, if
not uninspired.
"Indian Girl" is a country
western-type ballad that sounds
an awful lot like "I Only Want
To Be Your Friend" on It's Only
Rock'n'Roll. The song gets a lit
tle tedious, though, especially
when you realize that its only
message is that "life keeps on
going on, getting harder and
harder."
"Down In The Hole" is an
all-out blues number, complete
with harmonica, "pained"
guitars and lyrics about being out
