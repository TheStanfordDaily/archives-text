## Of Ricky and 'Noah's Ark' 
### 
You want to call him "cute,"
but it doesn't quite fit.
Cherub-faced and with a spat
tering of freckles across his up
turned nose, Ricky Schroder is
already a nine-year veteran of
show business. He delivers his
lines with a flair, both on and off
the screen. He'll talk about poli
tics, girls and baseball with the
self-assurance of any man
about-town. At 10, Ricky is what
you might call a "professional
kid."
Ricky was in San Francisco re
cently for a promotional preview
for his latest film, Disney's The
Last Flight of Noah's Ark, open
ing this week in the Bay area.
The south-sea romp incorpo
rates all the tried and true Disney
ploys from animals to orphans to

a shipwreck on a remote island.
But the best thing about the
movie has got to be Ricky.
Against the rather wooden
acting of chubby Elliot Gould as
a pilot named Dugan — or as
Ricky would say with his East
Coast accent, "Mistah Doogin"
— and Genevieve Bujold as a
somewhat vacant missionary,
Ricky and his friend Brutus, a
2400 lb. Brahma bull, add some
spark and zest to an otherwise
tedious adventure.
Terribly slow for the first 20
minutes, Noah's Ark does pick
up after a hernia-provoking
scene in which the shipwrecked
passengers and two Japanese
soldiers who were never clued-in
to the end of World War 11, con
vert a B-29 bomber into a boat.

Well, if "you rike it, you
rucky," 1 must say, stealing a line
from John Fujioka's very
stereotyped portrayal of Hiro, a
Japanese soldier.
Ricky says the best thing about
the movie for him was playing
with the many animals on board
the "ark," and swimming on the
Hawaiian beaches where much
of the film was shot.
"That Brutus, he was a great
guy," Ricky said, but he also re
vealed that the shark used was
actually a remote-controlled
machine.
"I'm too good for them to let a
shark eat me," he piped.
His mother Diane, who travels
with him everywhere, shot her
son a sharp glance. Diane
Schroder, an attractive, down
to-earth woman, is quick to cor
rect Ricky's grammer and man
ners when he gets a little too
rambunctious.
She explained that she allowed
her children — Ricky's sister
Dawn. 13, is also a model — to
get into show business to pay for
their education.
Ricky began modeling when
he was four months old, and has
appeared in over 50 television
commercials. His first movie role
was as Jon Voight's sidekick in
The Champ, for which he re
ceived an Academy Award
nomination. Before shooting
Noah's Ark, he worked with Wil
liam Holden, one of his heroes,
in The Earthling, soon to be re
leased. This month he is flying to
London to begin filming Little
Lord Fauntleroy, a CBS televi
sion movie with Alec Guiness.
As for the future?
Ricky's mom said he'll keep
on making movies, "only for as
long as he wants to, and enjoys
it." College is paid for now, but
the straight-A fourth grader isn't
sure he wants to go.
Ricky said his biggest dilemma
is whether to become a profes
sional actor or a star baseball
player for the New York Yan
kees. Currently he plays first
base for the Padres, a Little
League team near his home in
Greenwich, Conn.
As the Schroders prepared to
attend yet another publicity
function, Ricky was running
around, teasing his sister, just
like any other little boy.
One reporter winked and said,
"Ricky, don't ever grow up."
"Thank you," he grinned,
knocking over a glass.
"Oh Ricky, will you please be
careful," his mother sighed.

London to begin filming Little
Lord Fauntleroy, a CBS televi
sion movie with Alec Guiness.
As for the future?
Ricky's mom said he'll keep
on making movies, "only for as
long as he wants to, and enjoys
it." College is paid for now, but
the straight-A fourth grader isn't
sure he wants to go.
Ricky said his biggest dilemma
is whether to become a profes
sional actor or a star baseball
player for the New York Yan
kees. Currently he plays first
base for the Padres, a Little
League team near his home in
Greenwich, Conn.
As the Schroders prepared to
attend yet another publicity
function, Ricky was running
around, teasing his sister, just
like any other little boy.
One reporter winked and said,
"Ricky, don't ever grow up."
"Thank you," he grinned,
knocking over a glass.
"Oh Ricky, will you please be
careful," his mother sighed.


Ricky Schroder, Julie Bland, and Brutus
You want to call him "cute,"
but it doesn't quite fit.
Cherub-faced and with a spat
tering of freckles across his up
turned nose, Ricky Schroder is
already a nine-year veteran of
show business. He delivers his
lines with a flair, both on and off
the screen. He'll talk about poli
tics, girls and baseball with the
self-assurance of any man
about-town. At 10, Ricky is what
you might call a "professional
kid."
Ricky was in San Francisco re
cently for a promotional preview
for his latest film, Disney's The
Last Flight of Noah's Ark, open
ing this week in the Bay area.
The south-sea romp incorpo
rates all the tried and true Disney
ploys from animals to orphans to

a shipwreck on a remote island.
But the best thing about the
movie has got to be Ricky.
Against the rather wooden
acting of chubby Elliot Gould as
a pilot named Dugan — or as
Ricky would say with his East
Coast accent, "Mistah Doogin"
— and Genevieve Bujold as a
somewhat vacant missionary,
Ricky and his friend Brutus, a
2400 lb. Brahma bull, add some
spark and zest to an otherwise
tedious adventure.
Terribly slow for the first 20
minutes, Noah's Ark does pick
up after a hernia-provoking
scene in which the shipwrecked
passengers and two Japanese
soldiers who were never clued-in
to the end of World War 11, con
vert a B-29 bomber into a boat.

Well, if "you rike it, you
rucky," 1 must say, stealing a line
from John Fujioka's very
stereotyped portrayal of Hiro, a
Japanese soldier.
Ricky says the best thing about
the movie for him was playing
with the many animals on board
the "ark," and swimming on the
Hawaiian beaches where much
of the film was shot.
"That Brutus, he was a great
guy," Ricky said, but he also re
vealed that the shark used was
actually a remote-controlled
machine.
"I'm too good for them to let a
shark eat me," he piped.
His mother Diane, who travels
with him everywhere, shot her
son a sharp glance. Diane
Schroder, an attractive, down
to-earth woman, is quick to cor
rect Ricky's grammer and man
ners when he gets a little too
rambunctious.
She explained that she allowed
her children — Ricky's sister
Dawn. 13, is also a model — to
get into show business to pay for
their education.
Ricky began modeling when
he was four months old, and has
appeared in over 50 television
commercials. His first movie role
was as Jon Voight's sidekick in
The Champ, for which he re
ceived an Academy Award
nomination. Before shooting
Noah's Ark, he worked with Wil
liam Holden, one of his heroes,
in The Earthling, soon to be re
leased. This month he is flying to
London to begin filming Little
Lord Fauntleroy, a CBS televi
sion movie with Alec Guiness.
