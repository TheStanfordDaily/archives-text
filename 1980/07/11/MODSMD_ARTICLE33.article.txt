## Someone really should stop the music 
### 
You remember Bruce Jenner.
He's the guy who stole Ameri
ca's heart in the 1976 summer
Olympics and has since achieved
immortality in Polaroid com
mercials (replacing Lawrence
Olivier, one assumes). He's one
of the "big stars" in Can't Stop
the Music. Strike one.
Then there's Nancy Walker.
She played Rhoda's very cute
and very Jewish mother on The
Mary Tyler Moore Show. Well,
she's the one who directed this

film. Strike two.
The Village People. Strike
three.
What am 1 supposed to say
about a film that boasts the com
bined "talents" of this diverse
crowd? 1 could rail against the
inanity of a script that has Val
erie Perrine proclaim, "I don't
judge people" just before she
kicks Jenner out of her apart
ment for being "too uptight and
square."
I could condemn the Village

People for selling out to Hol
lywood schlock. A few years
ago these guys attained fame
when America realized what
"Macho Man" was all about.
Men singing about men? How
shocking! Not surprisingly, that
element is conspicuously missing
here — or, at the least, it's heav
ily covered up.
Or, how about targeting my at
tack of Allan Carr, the producer.
He brought us Grease, you'll re
member. No. Too easy. You
know what they say about hitting
the broad side of a barn.
There are countless faults with
Can't Stop the Music, but some
how I really can't get all that
upset about any of them. I mean,
when a film like The Shining
comes out, it's all right to rip it
apart, for it constitutes the work
of a professional, important film
artist — Stanley Kubrick.
But Can't Stop the Music just
doesn't deserve that kind of at
tention. We're talking about a
film by a man who thinks great
motion picture making consists
of sticking Olivia Newton-John
in tight leather pants and starting
the cameras rolling. Getting too
riled up about this film would be
like shredding a high school play
in the New York Times. There's
just no need.
Given what we've got — a very
light, and fairly energetic piece
of summer fluff — I guess this
thing isn't totally worthless. If
you look hard enough, Paul Sand
(another Mary Tyler Moore re

fugee) is in there somewhwere,
doing quite well with a pencil
sketched role.
Plus, there are some fairly en
tertaining musical numbers —
namely "YMCA" which follows
our stars through what must be
the cleanest, swiftest, and most
enjoyable production number
ever set in a men's gymnasium.
Honestly, seeing all those guys
twist, turn, flip and flop in time to
that music is enough to get even
Busby Berkeley's toes tapping.
This number alone redeems the
film from utter self-destruction.
1 guess my chief complaint
with Can't Stop the Music is that
it's so concerned with being
kinky, wild and "free." Valerie
Perrine's neighbor appears again
and again with crass, witless re
marks literally reeking of in
nuendo. And when an audience
gets to see spaghetti poured over
Bruce Jennei's lap just so Per
rine can get his pants off — well,
maybe we're going a bit too far.
Not that I'm against kinky
thrills (heavens no!), it's just that
Carr and Walker fail so misera
bly in attaining any kink at all. By
straining to be decadent and ris
que, they only succeed in being
boring and humorless.
By the time the Village People
get down to their last ten-minute
song, no one cares anymore.
They gyrate and pump away at
us, yelling that "you just can't
stop the music."
At least someone might have
tried.
