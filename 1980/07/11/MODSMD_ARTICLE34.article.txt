THE WINERY
2391 El Camino Real
326-7043
The Winery, located just east
of campus on El Camino at
California, is no real newcomer
to the Stanford area. 1 had first
noticed it a few years ago, soon
after my arrival in Palo Alto.
"It's the local expensive
steakhouse," someone told me,
and the stereotype stuck. A visit
— now two visits — to the Win
ery, however, showed something
rather different.
Upon entering, one maygodi
rectly to the hostess' podium,
where wine specials at attractive

prices are listed on a chalk board,
or one may move through swing
ing doors into the lounge.
The larger back part of the
lounge is dark, brick and wood
walls, with appropriately, old
pictures of California wineries.
Small tables with candles and
comfortable though not plush
chairs make for a cozy, and on
uncrowded nights quite intimate,
atmosphere.
For those so inclined, the area
around the bar is much lighter,
and noisier. Happy Hour, or
rather Happy Hours, 5-7 p.m.
weekdays is an added plus, espe
cially for students and other tight

budgeters; there are reduced
price drinks and free hors
d'oeuvres. These last may in
clude cheese and crackers,
meatballs, guacamole, or even
sections of a 10 ft. submarine
sandwich. It's well worth trying
even, or maybe especially, if
you're not planning on dinner!
As in the bar, there are two
distinct rooms, and the distinc
tion here is even greater. One,
the Garden Room, is aptly
named, with many live plants. It
is a bright, pretty room, with al
most an outdoor atmosphere.
We were seated, however, in
another dark brick and wood
room. Deep booths and more
candles make this an excellent
choice for a romantic evening.
Our waiter was quick to bring
menus, and to tell us the "Fresh
Fish du Jour." This fish varies in
price and in style of preparation,
according to what is available,
and we supposed, the whim of
the chef. Our night the offerings
were snapper and salmon.
Swordfish and sea bass have also
been available recently.
The remainderof the Winery's
menu is simple and to the point
— Seafood on one side, meats on
the other, with a few Surf and
Turf combinations. I decided to
try the salmon ($8.95), my friend
chose the Filet Mignon with
sauce Bearnaise ($9.65). Other
choices ranged from Calimari,
Steak Kabob, and Chicken
Teriyakai (all at only $6.95), to
such splurges as Alaskan King
Crab, The Wine Master (filet
mignon topped with crab, as

paragus and sauce Bearnaise),
and Delmonico Steak (all
$11.95).
Another nice alternative
would have been the Seafood
Platter, sauteed prawn, broiled
lobster, steamed crab, and fresh
fish ($10.95). It's a far cry from
the indistinguishable plate of
fried breaded seafood one often
encounters. We also sampled the
"Fresh Vegetable of the Day"
($1.50); there is only one each
day, tonight artichoke.
Aptly enough, there is a un
ique wine policy here. You may
choose from a reasonably priced
wine list emphasizing California
wines, as well as the specials, or
choose all the house wine you
can drink (Red, White or Rose)
for just $1.50 per person with
dinner or lunch. The house
brand is California Cellars, in
this taster's opinion one of the
better jug wines. One note: if
you would like to drink your
wine immediately please ask, as
otherwise it may not be brought
until your entree.
Entrees include hot bread and
butter, good but not homemade,
rice or potato, and"the Winery's
Salad Buffet." While not the
most overwhelming salad bar
around, the Winery's is quite
good, including a lettuce-red
cabbage base, mushrooms,
cauliflower, sprouts, green pep
pers, onions, various beans,
bacon bits, croutons and three
dressings.
Forestalling any wild desire
for seconds on salad, our entrees
arrived promptly. The artichoke

turned out to be a whole one,
steamed and served with butter,
mayonnaise and lemon. It was
enough for two. Our potatoes,
ordered "with everything except
bacon bits," were large and top
ped with an impressive amount
of sour cream, chives and butter.
The salmon was grilled, simple
but well prepared; it was a thick
slice of very tasty firm fish. The
filet mignon itself was excellent,
tender and flavorful, though
perhaps a tad too red for
medium.
The dessert menu is quite li
mited, only Chocolate Bavarian
($1.50) and Cheesecake ($1.75)
are offered. We split a piece of
this latter item; it was good, rich
but not overly sweet. Anotheral
ternative, not listed on the menu,
might be one of the Winery's
special coffee drinks ($1.75),
served at your table or in the
lounge. Both the Irish coffee and
a Kahlua/vodka/whipped cream
variety are personally recom
mended.
The two atmospheres, bright
or intimate, offer flexibility ac
cording to mood. The service,
though sometimes harried, is
friendly, and the prices can be
more than reasonable for very
good, if not incredibly fancy,
food. With the cheaper entrees
two could have a nice, plentiful
dinner with wine foraround $20,
taxand tip included. You could
of course spend more, but even
with drinks (especially if you
come early), it would be hard to
go much above $30 per couple.
