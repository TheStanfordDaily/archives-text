CHIC'S PLACE
Pier 39
San Francisco
421-2442
Pier 39 exudes that all-too
familiar touristy air. This latest
San Francisco "landmark" prot
rudes out into the bay between
the docks of two harbor cruise
companies and fetures a plethora
of little stores selling everything
from Golden Gate Bridge post
cards to ceramic cable cars, those
drop-in-a-dime and-see-
Alcatraz telescopes, and a
merry-go-round.
By day it is a place crawling
with those camera-carrying vis
itors, oohing and aahing at the
rustic wooden terraces as au
thentic Californian as anything
Walt Disney created, and buying
up those little trinkets that are
not the main export of the Port of
San Francisco. By now . . . well,
it is not the place where you'd
expect to find one of the City's
fine restaurants.
But you may be surprised.
Chic's (pronounced like the bird
— not the style) Place is a sea
food restaurant located just on
the bay-side of that long wooden
bridge that connects Pier 39 with
its multi-story parking lot. Once
you pass through the front door,
though, the decor quickly
changes from the planked walls
of the pier. The interior of Chic's
Place is dominated on one side
by a long, basically modern bar,
but with subtle lines that give it a
stately Victorian look without
the clutter. In fact, with a little
imagination, the dining hall
could be an elegant turn-of-the
century San Franciscan saloon,
complete with tuxedoed waiters.
Chic's Place's most remarka
ble feature, however, is undoub
tedly its view. Every table in the
long, narrow dining hall is within
several feet of the restaurant's
westward-looking picture win
dos. Just outside is the pier's
marina, filled with the yachts of
those more fortunate seafarers
who have more than Lake Lag to
wet their feet in.
Beyond that is the Bay, with
Alcatraz in full view. In the dis
tance the Golden Gate spans the
entrance to the Pacific and con
nects the City with Marin, which
trom this angle shows hardly a
touch of human life and appears
only as a rugged, beautiful
stretch of hills rising out of the
sea.
The only thing marring our
view was the Blue and Gold Bay
Cruise company's large S.S.
Golden Bear moored just out

side the window.
Chic's Place has an interesting
twist to its menu. After you have
been seated and been given the
usual paper variety, a
waiter hurries to your table with a
platter laden with prime exam
ples of the day's catch. Hunks of
salmon, swordfish and sole sur
round crabs and clams, all pulled
fresh from local waters. The wai
ter gives a tantalizing description
of each item and then scurries off
to show the delicacies to another
table.
For openers, the soups were
hearty and robust. In fact, they
were served in such giant-sized
bowls that they almost wasted,
rather than whetted, the appe
tite. But our voracity for the
soups' full-flavored body did not
allow us to leave an eyedrop. The
clam chowder could have
emerged from a steaming Boston
kitchen stocked with thick, juicy
clams just off the boat. The
tomato-stuffed bisque was
adequately spiced, although it
would probably not have
aroused the jealousy of a Marse
illes chef.
The spinach salad com
plemented our opening course
nicely, just offsetting the previ
ously consumed pepper. Best of
all was the elan and low-keyed
humor with which our waiter
prepared it before our eyes.
Make sure you ask for the waiter
who lights Sterno pots by rub
bing two sticks together.
Our entrees could only be de
scribed as superb. The fresh sal
mon must have recently arrived
from the Northwest. Enveloped
richly in a blanket of bernaise, it
broke delicately without flaking
at the touch of a fork. It was ac
companied by baby spears of
broccoli and our choice of rice
pilaf. The swordfish swelled with
meaty vitality but carried a sub
dued taste to be savored.
To top off our binge, we or
derd a Mexican Romance for de
ssert. Almost as seductive as its
name implies, a Mexican Ro
mance consists of a steaming
mug of coffee laced generously
with Kahlua. It was one of Chic's
long list of dessert coffees, all of
which sounded tempting and
even a little risque.
All in all, Chic's Place may not
be pre-eminently chic, but it cer
tainly outclasses the rest of Pier
39 and easily rivals its more es
tablished and expensive coun
terparts further down the Wharf.
