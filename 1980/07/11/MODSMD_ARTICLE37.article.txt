SHIDA OF TOKYO
TERIYAKI
RESTAURANT
833 W. EI Camino Real
Sunnyvale
(408) 245-2345
When one walks into Shida,
the warm, intimate surroundings
invite the diner to view an un
usual bamboo ceiling and large
lantern which serve as the focal
point of the room. The restaur
ant has small, semi-private indi
vidual rooms as well as tables
separated by screen partitions to
lend privacy to one's meal and
conversation.
We sat towards the back at a
table near a large gold Japanese
screen. Our waitress was dressed
in a knee-length kimono (much
to our chagrin), however, the
high percentage of Japanese cus
tomers reassured us!
The menu revolves around
variations of teriyaki dinners
with sushi and ala carte dishes as
well. Prices ranged from $5.95
for chicken teriyaki to $12 for
lobster tempura.
We tried the chef s special (A)
which included shrimp and veg
etable tempura, chicken and
pork teriyaki, salmon teriyaki,
and futomaki sushi for $7.95, the
| chefs special (B) which was the
same as (A) except it substituted
| salmon teriyaki with sashimi
(fresh raw tuna), also for $7.95.
| We also ordered one of the de
luxe dinners which included
sukiyaki, shrimp and vegetable
tempura, and yakitori for $9.95.

All three dinners were served
with either green salad or fish
broth soup or miso (soy bean)
soup.
The green salad was simply
lettuce with a thick oil and vin
egar dressing in which we found
the oil taste to predominate.
The miso soup was delicious,
with tofu and green onions with a
strong stock flavor. The fish
broth soup (osuimono) was a lit
tle salty, but had a flavorful taste.
We recommend the soups rather
than the salad unless you crave
green salad.
The chicken yakitori arrived
on skewers covered with a sweet
sauce. The chicken was very ten
der and juicy, with the skin still
on, and the onions on the skew
ers were mild and crunchy.
The two chef s specials came
on individual large trays with
partitions which made an impre
ssive and attractive outlay of
food. Unfortunately, by the time
we had finished half the meal,
the remaining entrees were al
ready cold.
The tempura was light, but
could have been a little crispier.
The teriyaki was excellent and a
nice touch was that the boneless
chicken, though a little dry,
could be easily handled with
chopsticks.
Don't miss the tuna cooked in
soy sauce, ginger and sake which,
along with some broccoli, and
egg combine for a delightful ap
petizer. The sashimi — maguro
(tuna) was fresh and served with
a dab of wasabi (green horse

radish), we were pleased that
they used maguro, which is
rather soft and melts in your
mouth, but this is purely a matter
of personal taste. In addition, the
sashimi was accompanied by a
charming California touch, al
falfa sprouts!
The teriyaki was delicious but
some hot rice would have been
welcome in addition to the sushi,
especially since the sauce was
quite strong.
The sukiyaki arrived in a large,
heavy iron pot with sliced beef,
mushrooms, carrots, onions,
yam noodles (clean and slip
pery), tofu (bean curd), napa
cabbage and green onions
cooked in a sweet broth and
mirin (sweet rice wine). We
chose to eat the sukiyaki with a
slightly beaten raw egg and
realized this was a good choice
since the sukiyaki sauce was
quite strong which was tempered
by the egg. We found the
sukiyaki to be rather overly
sweet for our personal tastes but
realize that most Japanese prefer
their sukiyaki quite sweet.
We did not order beef teriyaki
but upon inquiring discovered it
was prepared in a less traditional
way, sliced thin, marinated and
broiled.
If you are looking for a warm,
cozy atmosphere and are in the
mood for excellent teriyaki —
Shida is the place. Service is re
laxed and friendly, but with only
two waitresses and a full house
most of the time, be prepared for
a more leisurely meal.

luxe dinners which included
sukiyaki, shrimp and vegetable
tempura, and yakitori for $9.95.

All three dinners were served
with either green salad or fish
broth soup or miso (soy bean)
soup.
The green salad was simply
lettuce with a thick oil and vin
egar dressing in which we found
the oil taste to predominate.
The miso soup was delicious,
with tofu and green onions with a
strong stock flavor. The fish
broth soup (osuimono) was a lit
tle salty, but had a flavorful taste.
We recommend the soups rather
than the salad unless you crave
green salad.
The chicken yakitori arrived
on skewers covered with a sweet
sauce. The chicken was very ten
der and juicy, with the skin still
on, and the onions on the skew
ers were mild and crunchy.
The two chef s specials came
on individual large trays with
partitions which made an impre
ssive and attractive outlay of
food. Unfortunately, by the time
we had finished half the meal,
the remaining entrees were al
ready cold.
The tempura was light, but
could have been a little crispier.
The teriyaki was excellent and a
nice touch was that the boneless
chicken, though a little dry,
could be easily handled with
chopsticks.
Don't miss the tuna cooked in
soy sauce, ginger and sake which,
along with some broccoli, and
egg combine for a delightful ap
petizer. The sashimi — maguro
(tuna) was fresh and served with
a dab of wasabi (green horse

radish), we were pleased that
they used maguro, which is
rather soft and melts in your
mouth, but this is purely a matter
of personal taste. In addition, the
sashimi was accompanied by a
charming California touch, al
falfa sprouts!
The teriyaki was delicious but
some hot rice would have been
welcome in addition to the sushi,
especially since the sauce was
quite strong.
The sukiyaki arrived in a large,
heavy iron pot with sliced beef,
mushrooms, carrots, onions,
yam noodles (clean and slip
pery), tofu (bean curd), napa
cabbage and green onions
cooked in a sweet broth and
mirin (sweet rice wine). We
chose to eat the sukiyaki with a
slightly beaten raw egg and
realized this was a good choice
since the sukiyaki sauce was
quite strong which was tempered
by the egg. We found the
sukiyaki to be rather overly
sweet for our personal tastes but
realize that most Japanese prefer
their sukiyaki quite sweet.
We did not order beef teriyaki
but upon inquiring discovered it
was prepared in a less traditional
way, sliced thin, marinated and
broiled.
If you are looking for a warm,
cozy atmosphere and are in the
mood for excellent teriyaki —
Shida is the place. Service is re
laxed and friendly, but with only
two waitresses and a full house
most of the time, be prepared for
a more leisurely meal.
SHIDA OF TOKYO
TERIYAKI
RESTAURANT
833 W. EI Camino Real
Sunnyvale
(408) 245-2345
When one walks into Shida,
the warm, intimate surroundings
invite the diner to view an un
usual bamboo ceiling and large
lantern which serve as the focal
point of the room. The restaur
ant has small, semi-private indi
vidual rooms as well as tables
separated by screen partitions to
lend privacy to one's meal and
conversation.
We sat towards the back at a
table near a large gold Japanese
screen. Our waitress was dressed
in a knee-length kimono (much
to our chagrin), however, the
high percentage of Japanese cus
tomers reassured us!
The menu revolves around
variations of teriyaki dinners
with sushi and ala carte dishes as
well. Prices ranged from $5.95
for chicken teriyaki to $12 for
lobster tempura.
We tried the chef s special (A)
which included shrimp and veg
etable tempura, chicken and
pork teriyaki, salmon teriyaki,
and futomaki sushi for $7.95, the
| chefs special (B) which was the
same as (A) except it substituted
| salmon teriyaki with sashimi
(fresh raw tuna), also for $7.95.
| We also ordered one of the de
luxe dinners which included
sukiyaki, shrimp and vegetable
tempura, and yakitori for $9.95.
