Yes! We can give Komatsu
only our highest recommenda
tion. Komatsu is located in
Campbell, not San Francisco
Japantown.
A short 20-minute drive south
from campus, a small Japanese
restaurant caters to the tradi
tional Japanese dining experi
ence. Despite its newness and
unusual location, Komatsu has a
large number of regular
Japanese customers, some from
as far as the East Bay.
At Komatsu, one has a choice
of the sushi bar, where you may
observe the preparation of the
time honored dish, regular ta
bles, or a more private tatami
room seating four people.
We took off our shoes and sat
in a tatami (straw mat) room
with a well under the table to
make seating more comfortable.
The waitress, clad in a traditional
kimono, brought "genmaicha,"
an unusual Japanese tea with
popped rice in it.
The menu is extensive. Not
only does Komatsu serve com
monly ordered dishes such as
tempura, sukiyaki and teriyaki
but it also offers many popular,
truly Japanese dishes often not
found in other Japanese restaur
ants in the United States.
Appetizers range from $2.30
for Yakitori (chicken on skew
ers) to $7.50 for assorted sashimi
(raw fish). The choice of dinners
includes tempura. sukiyaki. ton
katsu (fried breaded pork cutlet)
assorted teriyaki dishes,
nabemono and combination
plates.
Prices are average for a
Japanese restaurant from $5.25
for vegetable tempura to $ 14.25
for their special six course din
ner. For the more adventurous
diner, a selection of many side
dishes and sushi are also availa
ble.
We decided to order some
commonly requested dishes such
as tempura and teriyaki as well as
the more traditional dishes. The
dinner started with hiyayakko
(cold Tofu), miso soup (soy bean
soup) and the special nigiri sushi.
We then ordered the special six
course dinner which included an
appeti/er. sashimi, sunomono,
tempura. beef teriyaki, soup,
pickles and rice.
The hiyayakko arrived first:
cold-cooked 'lofu (usually
served as a summer dish in Ja
pan) served on a bed of ice. top
[><:d thin shaving* of dried
fish h aooompamed by a

tasty sauce of grated ginger and
green onions for dipping.
The appetizer consisted of two
pieces of cooked egg, some
squid, and crab presented on an
elegant lacquer tray with the
sunomono (a cucumber salad
with a shrimp, octopus, and
longneck clam garnish) and the
sashimi (raw tuna, or maguro, in
this case).
Everything was absolutely de
licious. The hiyayakko was re
freshing and delicately flavored.
The sunomono had been mari
nated in a sweet, lemony sauce
and the flavors of seafood and
cucumber combined excellently.
In Japanese cooking, presen
tation is equally as important as
the taste of the food itself.
The meal was elegant and im
pressive without being ostentati
ous.
We continued to be awed
when our waitress brought in the
nigiri sushi tray. Nigiri consists of
cold rice balls with wasabi (green
horseradish) and a slice of fish or
other seafood on top. The nigiri
plate was so beautiful we gazed
at it for a long period of time
before attempting to eat any
thing. Each nigiri was a different
color (due to what was on top of
it) and all were attractively ar
ranged in rows on the tray. In all
we found crab, maguro (tuna),
salmon eggs, shrimp, sea urchin,
smoked salmon, red caviar,
squid, long necked clams and
mackeral.
The tempura and beef teriyaki
followed and were both excel
lent. The tempura was light and
crispy and included a wide vari
ety of vegetables and shrimp, the
beef teriyaki was grilled medium
rare to order, cut into serving
size and covered with a small
amount of mild sauce which was
neither overly sweet or salty
(many restaurants put too much
soy sauce in their teriyaki sauce,
this was nof so here). For dessert
we had a choice of green tea ice
cream or mandarin oranges.
Tradition and authenticity
seem to be Komatsu's
philosophy. The service is
friendly and well-paced. Our
waitress was willing to explain
details and admitted that the re
staurant is so traditional, she
serves men before women.
Not only is the food authentic
but the smallest details in
Japanese dinner etiquette are
carefully followed. Extra rice
was served in a lacquer bowl on
the side, soup bowls came with
covers and the restaurant'sdecor
demonstrated the stark simplic
ity of a true Japanese restaurant.

Prices are average for a
Japanese restaurant from $5.25
for vegetable tempura to $ 14.25
for their special six course din
ner. For the more adventurous
diner, a selection of many side
dishes and sushi are also availa
ble.
We decided to order some
commonly requested dishes such
as tempura and teriyaki as well as
the more traditional dishes. The
dinner started with hiyayakko
(cold Tofu), miso soup (soy bean
soup) and the special nigiri sushi.
We then ordered the special six
course dinner which included an
appeti/er. sashimi, sunomono,
tempura. beef teriyaki, soup,
pickles and rice.
The hiyayakko arrived first:
cold-cooked 'lofu (usually
served as a summer dish in Ja
pan) served on a bed of ice. top
[><:d thin shaving* of dried
fish h aooompamed by a

tasty sauce of grated ginger and
green onions for dipping.
The appetizer consisted of two
pieces of cooked egg, some
squid, and crab presented on an
elegant lacquer tray with the
sunomono (a cucumber salad
with a shrimp, octopus, and
longneck clam garnish) and the
sashimi (raw tuna, or maguro, in
this case).
Everything was absolutely de
licious. The hiyayakko was re
freshing and delicately flavored.
The sunomono had been mari
nated in a sweet, lemony sauce
and the flavors of seafood and
cucumber combined excellently.
In Japanese cooking, presen
tation is equally as important as
the taste of the food itself.
The meal was elegant and im
pressive without being ostentati
ous.
We continued to be awed
when our waitress brought in the
nigiri sushi tray. Nigiri consists of
cold rice balls with wasabi (green
horseradish) and a slice of fish or
other seafood on top. The nigiri
plate was so beautiful we gazed
at it for a long period of time
before attempting to eat any
thing. Each nigiri was a different
color (due to what was on top of
it) and all were attractively ar
ranged in rows on the tray. In all
we found crab, maguro (tuna),
salmon eggs, shrimp, sea urchin,
smoked salmon, red caviar,
squid, long necked clams and
mackeral.
The tempura and beef teriyaki
followed and were both excel
lent. The tempura was light and
crispy and included a wide vari
ety of vegetables and shrimp, the
beef teriyaki was grilled medium
rare to order, cut into serving
size and covered with a small
amount of mild sauce which was
neither overly sweet or salty
(many restaurants put too much
soy sauce in their teriyaki sauce,
this was nof so here). For dessert
we had a choice of green tea ice
cream or mandarin oranges.
Tradition and authenticity
seem to be Komatsu's
philosophy. The service is
friendly and well-paced. Our
waitress was willing to explain
details and admitted that the re
staurant is so traditional, she
serves men before women.
Not only is the food authentic
but the smallest details in
Japanese dinner etiquette are
carefully followed. Extra rice
was served in a lacquer bowl on
the side, soup bowls came with
covers and the restaurant'sdecor
demonstrated the stark simplic
ity of a true Japanese restaurant.

Yes! We can give Komatsu
only our highest recommenda
tion. Komatsu is located in
Campbell, not San Francisco
Japantown.
A short 20-minute drive south
from campus, a small Japanese
restaurant caters to the tradi
tional Japanese dining experi
ence. Despite its newness and
unusual location, Komatsu has a
large number of regular
Japanese customers, some from
as far as the East Bay.
At Komatsu, one has a choice
of the sushi bar, where you may
observe the preparation of the
time honored dish, regular ta
bles, or a more private tatami
room seating four people.
We took off our shoes and sat
in a tatami (straw mat) room
with a well under the table to
make seating more comfortable.
The waitress, clad in a traditional
kimono, brought "genmaicha,"
an unusual Japanese tea with
popped rice in it.
The menu is extensive. Not
only does Komatsu serve com
monly ordered dishes such as
tempura, sukiyaki and teriyaki
but it also offers many popular,
truly Japanese dishes often not
found in other Japanese restaur
ants in the United States.
Appetizers range from $2.30
for Yakitori (chicken on skew
ers) to $7.50 for assorted sashimi
(raw fish). The choice of dinners
includes tempura. sukiyaki. ton
katsu (fried breaded pork cutlet)
assorted teriyaki dishes,
nabemono and combination
plates.
