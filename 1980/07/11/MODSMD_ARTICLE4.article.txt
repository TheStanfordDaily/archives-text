# Nurses avert strike
## 
### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
Stanford University Hospital's
Registered Nurses voted by a
two-thirds majority to ratify a
new 20-month contract prop
osed July 6, news bureau officials
announced Tuesday.
Represented by the Commit
tee for the Recognition of Nurs
ing Achievements (CRONA),
747 nurses of almost 1000 ag
reed to accept the conditions of
the new contract, thereby avert
ing a strike planned for July 14.
The contract includes a 1 2 per
cent wage increase retroactive to
June 22, a 3 percent increase on
March 1, 1981, and a 9 percent
increaseon July 1, 1981.
Other changes were an in
crease of night shift pay by 2
percent, improvements in educa
tional and retirement benefits, a
new program for performance
evaluation, and long-term disa
bility funds, according to Pris
cilla Wheeler, chief negotiator
for the hospital.
A seniority clause to be
applied by a special arbitration
panel of five when found ap
propriate to individual cases was
also added to the contract.
Since the contract expired
June 30 and a strike was first set

for July 4, the hospital has re
duced the number of patients
from over 550 to under 250 on
July 5. The strike deadline was
extended to July 14 after nurses
defeated a former proposal by a
narrow margin. Only 100 pa
tients would have been admitted
in the event of a strike.
"The hospital has a backlog of
admissions," affirms Hospital
Administrator Gary Mecklen
burg. "We will be working
closely with the medical staff in
order to admit their patients as
soon as possible."
CRONA, established in 1 966,
was headed by Joanna Nelson
R.N. throughout the proceed
ings. Ruth Carpenter served as a
federal arbitrator.
The new contract was shor
tened from the previous length
of 24 months to only 20 to pro
vide a near overlap with other
hospitals' contracts. This helps in
recruiting nurses as their former
contracts expire.
Negotiations began May 20
between C'RONA and the hos
pital, CRONA giving strike
notice on June 24 for July 4. By
July 1 a tentative agreement was
reached but not ratified, and
strike notice was extended to
July K and finally to July 14.
