HOUSE OF GENJI
1335 N. Ist Street
San Jose
(408) 286-4120
The House of Genji in San Jose is an ideal place
for those seeking both a good meal, attractively
served and deliciously prepared, as well as a fun
and entertaining evening. The restaurant is a
branch of Genji of Tokyo which has opened other
restaurants in Guam and (much to our surprise!)
Omaha, Nebraska. Genji serves an exclusively
teppanyaki menu where dinner is prepared at one's
table by skilled chefs on large electric or gas grills.
One must not jump to the conclusion that Genji
is representative of an authentic Japanese restaur
ant. Teppanyaki is but one of the more familiar and
popular types of Japanese cuisine in the United
States.
Mr. Saito, manager of Genji in San Jose, admits
some aspects of Genji's meals are adaptations from
other countries. Chefs at Genji usually have a pre
vious background in Japanese or French cooking
and are trained at the restaurant. The charm that
Genji holds lies in the entertaining performance
given by these chefs, not its authenticity per se.
Genji has 16 tables, each with its own grills,
seating six to 10 persons each. The restaurant also
has banquet facilities and a cocktail lounge which it
shares with the adjoining Chinese restaurant,
Cathay. The majority of Genji's customers are
non-Japanese, many are business people.
Virtually all food is sliced and prepared for cook
ing in the kitchen and then stir-fried or grilled at
the tables in the dining rooms.
Prices at Genji are comparable to those at other
teppanyaki restaurants. Especially appealing was
the large variety available ranging from chicken
teppanyaki ($8.50 for dinner) to beef ($9.95) to
individual seafood and combination dinners (sea
sonal, up to $ 17.95). Dinner orders included soup,
salad, vegetable/shrimp teppanyaki and desert.
The atmosphere at Genji was pleasant, with soft
lighting and tasteful, simple decor. On busy nights,
it may be rather boistrous as the tables fill up, so we
do not recommend Genji to those seeking an inti
mate, romantic evening. We were pleased to see
the waitresses wearing authentic kimonos (as op
posed to the "bathrobes" one distressfully encoun
ters in too many restaurants). For the most part,
what was adapted from non-Japanese sources
blended tastefully with the general setting.
We decided to order filet mignon teppanyaki

($9.95) and the seafood combination (seasonal,
about $17.95). A pot of green tea was already at
the table when we were seated and we poured it
ourselves. Service from the waitresses was quick,
efficient and unobtrusive, sometimes overly so, as
dishes mysteriously appeared and disappeared
without warning. We might note that we were sea
ted with two couples at the same large table.
The salad was a standard tossed garden of let
tuce, radishes and cherry tomatoes with an unusual
touch — a thick, mildly hot dressing topped with
deep-fried cellophane noodles (long rice). Ot
sukemono (Japanese pickled vegetables served as
"salad" in most Japanese restaurants was offered
on the menu but as a priced side order. The soup,
osuimono (clear fish broth) was a nice change from
the commonly served misoshiru (soy bean broth)
and though pleasant, did not have a very distinct
stock flavor.
Indisputably, the high point of the evening began
when our chef, Taka, wheeled in a cart complete
with artistically arranged platters of meat, seafood,
vegetables, knives and other utensils, sauces and
seasonings.
Since teppanyaki dinners vary immensely de
pending on the chef, we craned our necks to ob
serve four different chefs in the dining room. All
displayed amazing degrees of dexterity and skills,
slicing meat and vegetables, tossing seasonings,
sauces and knives with great ceremony. Each had
an individual style ranging from the whimsical to
the flamboyant, adding delightful touches such as
flipping cooked shrimp into our plates amidst the
applause and cheers of our fellow diners.
Both the filet mignon and seafood dinners were
excellent, with generous servings, attractively pre
sented on heavy plates.
The filet mignon was serv ed as we requested — a
juicy medium rare, cut in large cubes with fresh
mushrooms. The seafood combination consisted of
lobster, scallops and prawns with broccoli heaped
in a red lobster shell topped with sliced lemons and
butter.
The vegetables were crisp and colorful, and even
the beansprouts weren't overdone although Taka
had used them to spell his name out on the grill.
Despite the generous use of spices, seasonings
and sauces, everything was subtly flavored and
could be eaten without large amounts of rice or tea.
For dessert, we were offered a choice of green tea
ice cream, fruit sherbet or mandarin orange sec
tions, a light way to round out an excellent and
filling meal.
