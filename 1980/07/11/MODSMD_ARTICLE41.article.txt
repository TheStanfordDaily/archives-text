# CINEMA SCOPE

### 
Sleeper ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen betore he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex
'But Were Afraid to Ask, plays next
Thursday through Sunday.
—Jim Mattson
The Shiming ★
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.
—J.M.
The Tin Drum
Aquarius, Palo Alto
"War is bad .. . War is bad . . . War
is bad.. For all its good intentions,

the din of this drum beats too long and
too loud. This adaptation of the
Gunter Grass novel is visually inven
tive; and occasionally intriguing.
Weirdness, however, can only carry
one along just so far. ...
See this one for the vivid cinematic
moments everyone's been telling you
about (the kid really does peer out in
disgust from his mother's womb);
leave the much-ballyhooed "hidden
meanings" to the book.
—Leslie Bixel
Superman ★ ★ ★,
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise that somehow manages to
work in spite of it all. A surprising
number of the right decisions were
made, and what the movie lacks in
childlike wonder it makes up for with
an experienced comic book sense. As
Lois I-ane, Margot Kidder is the best
thing in the movie — she brings out
the sexiness we always knew Lois
Lane had.
—Ron Lillejord
Hair ★★★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
A great musical fantasy that's also a
kicky visual trip. Director Milos For
man (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest, Taking Off) works in a reckless,
giddy fashion; he perfectly captures
the timeless, rock 'n' roll, rebellious
spirit of the '60s and makes it live
again. It's a fantasy vision of America,
but even in those terms, Hair might be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.
—R.L.
Harold and Maude ★ ★ ★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
Harold is a young man whose hob
bies are attending funerals and com
mitting suicide. Maude is an old
woman who believes in free love and
in the inherent goodness of humanity.
It's clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love. Hal

Ashby (Being There, Coming Home)
directed this invigorating cult comedy.
The two principals are played by Bud
Cort and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Sevens enliven the soundtrack.
—J.M.
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J.M
Paper Moon ★ ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Peter Bogdanovich directed this
black-and-white comedy about a
Bible-swindler (Ryan O'Neill), a
foul-mouthed little girl (Tatum
O'Neill) and a floozy (Madelaine
Kahn). Bogdanovich is so busy steal
ing from other movies he's seen that
he lets some nice bits pass by almost
unnoticed, but it's a surprisingly
well-maintained effort from a director
who would later bring you full-blown
diasters like Nickelodeon.
—J.M.
The Producers ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A movie that has forged an amaz
ingly durable reputation on the
strength of one good gag. One gets the
feeling that Brooks would have pre
ferred to be making "Springtime for
Hitler," the play-within-thc-film,
than the movie itself — cinematically,
the look of the film is a textbook case
of ineptitude. The Producers is

triple-billed with High Anxiety
(another film that, in its TV-style ugli
ness, reveals Brooks' appalling lack of
visual sense) and The 12 Chairs. All
play tonight.
—J.M
The Blues Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Fame ★ ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A New York school for the per
forming arts forms the setting for this
interesting, uneven drama. We sec ex
cerpts from the lives of the students as
they work toward their only goal in
life: fame.
The acting, by a talented unknown
cast, is oftentimes striking, and several
scenes — where the entire school goes
crazy dancing, singing, and playing
music — border on brilliance. Unfor
tunately, the film's drama shows an
alarming tendency toward melod
rama, and at times all we have on the
screen is dramatic mush.
Alan Parker directed; Michael
Gore supplied the music.
—Simon Labov

Guano

Two Alfred Hitchcock
classics, Notorious, (photo at
left) and Foreign Correspon
dent, play through Wednes
day at the Festival Cinema,
Palo Alto.
Notorious is a spy story
done with the wit and grace of
Restoration comedy; it is
among the most beautifully
crafted films of the genre. It is
a film of gleaming surfaces
shown in caressing close-ups:
wine bottles, teacups and
keys all take on a sheen of
intrigue. Cary Grant plays an
American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude
Rains; the device he uses is
Ingrid Bergman. The irony is
that Rains engages our sym
pathies more than Grant does
— Rains is the member of the
triangle who knows the least
and whose love is most sin
cere.
Foreign Correspondent
stars Joseph Gotten as a re
porter who uncovers Euro
pean skullduggery in the
period immediately preced
ing World War 11.

jokes in this one — unfortunately only
eight or nine of them are at all humor

The Blue I agoon
Old Mill, Palo Alio
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take i
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randall Kleiscr
(Grease) has seen to it that there's I
something here to offend everyone. ]
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a J
"4()s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.
—J.M.
Apocalypse Now 'A"A"A"A'
New Vanity, Palo Alio
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of Dark
ness; he employs Conrad's essential
narrative but not his point of view.
Aided by the superb cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro, Coppola creates |
stunning images of Vietnam, combin
ing frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into al
most literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and turn
away others. Apocalypse Now is, I |
think, the best American movie of the '!
just-ended decade. It has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the profound
questions it confronts you with justify J
the seeming craziness of this "impos- rj
sible," almost nihilistic, vision of
mankind. Starring Marlon Brando, it
Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall and 112
Frederic Forrest. 112

Three long, painful years in the

The Tin Drum
Aquarius, Palo Alto
"War is bad .. . War is bad . . . War

the din of this drum beats too long and

Gunter Grass novel is visually inven
tive; and occasionally intriguing.
Weirdness, however, can only carry
one along just so far. ...
See this one for the vivid cinematic
moments everyone's been telling you

leave the much-ballyhooed "hidden

Superman ★ ★ ★,

A triumph of corporate com
promise that somehow manages to
work in spite of it all. A surprising
number of the right decisions were
made, and what the movie lacks in
childlike wonder it makes up for with
an experienced comic book sense. As
Lois I-ane, Margot Kidder is the best

Hair ★★★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
A great musical fantasy that's also a
kicky visual trip. Director Milos For
man (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest, Taking Off) works in a reckless,
giddy fashion; he perfectly captures
the timeless, rock 'n' roll, rebellious
spirit of the '60s and makes it live
again. It's a fantasy vision of America,
but even in those terms, Hair might be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Harold and Maude ★ ★ ★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
Harold is a young man whose hob
bies are attending funerals and com
mitting suicide. Maude is an old
woman who believes in free love and
in the inherent goodness of humanity.
It's clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love. Hal

Ashby (Being There, Coming Home)
directed this invigorating cult comedy.
The two principals are played by Bud
Cort and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Sevens enliven the soundtrack.
—J.M.
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J.M
Paper Moon ★ ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Peter Bogdanovich directed this
black-and-white comedy about a
Bible-swindler (Ryan O'Neill), a
foul-mouthed little girl (Tatum
O'Neill) and a floozy (Madelaine
Kahn). Bogdanovich is so busy steal
ing from other movies he's seen that
he lets some nice bits pass by almost
unnoticed, but it's a surprisingly
well-maintained effort from a director
who would later bring you full-blown
diasters like Nickelodeon.

The Producers ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A movie that has forged an amaz
ingly durable reputation on the
strength of one good gag. One gets the
feeling that Brooks would have pre
ferred to be making "Springtime for
Hitler," the play-within-thc-film,
than the movie itself — cinematically,
the look of the film is a textbook case
of ineptitude. The Producers is

triple-billed with High Anxiety
(another film that, in its TV-style ugli
ness, reveals Brooks' appalling lack of
visual sense) and The 12 Chairs. All
play tonight.
—J.M
The Blues Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Fame ★ ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A New York school for the per
forming arts forms the setting for this
interesting, uneven drama. We sec ex
cerpts from the lives of the students as
they work toward their only goal in
life: fame.
The acting, by a talented unknown
cast, is oftentimes striking, and several
scenes — where the entire school goes
crazy dancing, singing, and playing
music — border on brilliance. Unfor
tunately, the film's drama shows an
alarming tendency toward melod
rama, and at times all we have on the
screen is dramatic mush.

Two Alfred Hitchcock
classics, Notorious, (photo at

dent, play through Wednes
day at the Festival Cinema,
Palo Alto.
Notorious is a spy story
done with the wit and grace of
Restoration comedy; it is
among the most beautifully
crafted films of the genre. It is
a film of gleaming surfaces
shown in caressing close-ups:
wine bottles, teacups and
keys all take on a sheen of
intrigue. Cary Grant plays an
American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude
Rains; the device he uses is
Ingrid Bergman. The irony is
that Rains engages our sym
pathies more than Grant does
— Rains is the member of the
triangle who knows the least
and whose love is most sin
cere.
Foreign Correspondent

Apocalypse Now 'A"A"A"A'
New Vanity, Palo Alio
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of Dark
ness; he employs Conrad's essential
narrative but not his point of view.
Aided by the superb cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro, Coppola creates |
stunning images of Vietnam, combin
ing frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into al
most literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and turn
away others. Apocalypse Now is, I |
think, the best American movie of the '!
just-ended decade. It has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the profound
questions it confronts you with justify J
the seeming craziness of this "impos- rj
sible," almost nihilistic, vision of
mankind. Starring Marlon Brando, it

Sleeper ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen betore he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You

leave the much-ballyhooed "hidden

Superman ★ ★ ★,
Park, Menlo Park
A triumph of corporate com
promise that somehow manages to
work in spite of it all. A surprising
number of the right decisions were
made, and what the movie lacks in
childlike wonder it makes up for with
an experienced comic book sense. As
Lois I-ane, Margot Kidder is the best
thing in the movie — she brings out
the sexiness we always knew Lois
Lane had.
—Ron Lillejord
Hair ★★★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
A great musical fantasy that's also a
kicky visual trip. Director Milos For
man (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest, Taking Off) works in a reckless,
giddy fashion; he perfectly captures
the timeless, rock 'n' roll, rebellious
spirit of the '60s and makes it live
again. It's a fantasy vision of America,
but even in those terms, Hair might be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Harold and Maude ★ ★ ★
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
Harold is a young man whose hob
bies are attending funerals and com
mitting suicide. Maude is an old
woman who believes in free love and
in the inherent goodness of humanity.
It's clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love. Hal

Ashby (Being There, Coming Home)
directed this invigorating cult comedy.
The two principals are played by Bud
Cort and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Sevens enliven the soundtrack.
—J.M.
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J.M
Paper Moon ★ ★ ★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Peter Bogdanovich directed this
black-and-white comedy about a
Bible-swindler (Ryan O'Neill), a
foul-mouthed little girl (Tatum
O'Neill) and a floozy (Madelaine
Kahn). Bogdanovich is so busy steal
ing from other movies he's seen that
he lets some nice bits pass by almost
unnoticed, but it's a surprisingly
well-maintained effort from a director
who would later bring you full-blown
diasters like Nickelodeon.

The Producers ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
A movie that has forged an amaz
ingly durable reputation on the
strength of one good gag. One gets the
feeling that Brooks would have pre
ferred to be making "Springtime for
Hitler," the play-within-thc-film,
than the movie itself — cinematically,
the look of the film is a textbook case
of ineptitude. The Producers is

triple-billed with High Anxiety
(another film that, in its TV-style ugli
ness, reveals Brooks' appalling lack of
visual sense) and The 12 Chairs. All
play tonight.
—J.M
The Blues Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Fame ★ ★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
A New York school for the per
forming arts forms the setting for this
interesting, uneven drama. We sec ex
cerpts from the lives of the students as
they work toward their only goal in
life: fame.
The acting, by a talented unknown
cast, is oftentimes striking, and several
scenes — where the entire school goes
crazy dancing, singing, and playing
music — border on brilliance. Unfor
tunately, the film's drama shows an
alarming tendency toward melod
rama, and at times all we have on the
screen is dramatic mush.
Alan Parker directed; Michael
Gore supplied the music.

Guano

Two Alfred Hitchcock
classics, Notorious, (photo at

dent, play through Wednes
day at the Festival Cinema,
Palo Alto.
Notorious is a spy story
done with the wit and grace of
Restoration comedy; it is
among the most beautifully
crafted films of the genre. It is
a film of gleaming surfaces
shown in caressing close-ups:
wine bottles, teacups and
keys all take on a sheen of
intrigue. Cary Grant plays an
American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude
Rains; the device he uses is
Ingrid Bergman. The irony is
that Rains engages our sym
pathies more than Grant does
— Rains is the member of the
triangle who knows the least
and whose love is most sin
cere.
Foreign Correspondent
stars Joseph Gotten as a re
porter who uncovers Euro
pean skullduggery in the
period immediately preced
ing World War 11.

When the two kids aren't enacting

Apocalypse Now 'A"A"A"A'
New Vanity, Palo Alio
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of Dark
ness; he employs Conrad's essential
narrative but not his point of view.
Aided by the superb cinematographer
Vittorio Storaro, Coppola creates |
stunning images of Vietnam, combin
ing frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into al
most literal hell that will engross —
horribly fascinate — some, and turn
away others. Apocalypse Now is, I |
think, the best American movie of the '!
just-ended decade. It has almost un
tenable ambitions, but the profound
questions it confronts you with justify J
the seeming craziness of this "impos- rj
sible," almost nihilistic, vision of
mankind. Starring Marlon Brando, it
Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall and 112
Frederic Forrest. 112

Sleeper ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen betore he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About Sex
'But Were Afraid to Ask, plays next
Thursday through Sunday.
—Jim Mattson
The Shiming ★
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

The Tin Drum
Aquarius, Palo Alto
"War is bad .. . War is bad . . . War
