GOP completes platform
DETROIT — Brimming with confi
dence, the Republican Platform Commit
tee virtually completed work last night on
a 1980 platform that it hopes will help
pave the way for Ronald Reagan to win
the presidency in November.
The platform calls for a sharp increa
se in U.S. defense spending, a tougher
posture toward the Soviet Union, a 10
percent tax cut for Americans and an
anti-abortion amendment to the Con
stitution. It withholds the party's support
for an Equal Rights Amendment for
women for the first time in 40 years.
The committee finished work a day
ahead of schedule; and Sen. John Tower,
platform committee chairman, said, "I
think it reflects the unity of the party and
the singlemindedness of our purpose."
All that remained to be completed was
an introductory statement, and Tower
said this would be done this morning.
The platform clearly reflects the
policies and positions of Reagan, and his
lieutenants were active in persuading the
delegates to accept them with a minimum
of controversy and debate.
Mondale sees party unity
WASHINGTON — Vice President
Walter Mondale expressed concern yes
terday that a bitter fight between Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Presi
dent Carter at the Democratic convention
could wreck Carter's chances for re
election.
Mondale appeared to be mystified as to
Kennedy's intentions in pressing his fight
for the Democratic presidential nomina
tion to the convention floor since Carter
has accumulated several hundred dele
gates more than the 1666 required for
nomination.
The vice president, inteviewed during a
breakfast session at the Los Angeles
Times' Washington Bureau, said he has
not talked with Kennedy, but has a hunch

"that when the convention convenes,
there will be some fights, but we'll come
out of it united. But that's only a guess at
this time because I don't know — it turns
entirely on what his intentions are."
"Having worked with Kennedy for 14
to 16 years in the Senate, I don't think
he'd play the spoiler's role or wrecker's
role. And anyone who does, and I don't
think he would, must be aware of the blame
that would be heaped on them," Mondale
said.
Soviets begin 'free-firing'
WASHINGTON — Soviet forces in
Afghanistan have resorted to "free
firing" into villages and to air-dropping
mines and personnel-counting sensors
along main infiltration trails from Pakis
tan, a senior U.S. official said yesterday.
The move provides a striking parallel to
U.S. actions in Vietnam.
"At first the Soviet troops were careful
not to attack villages," the official re
ported. "But now they have been given
free rein to fire freely into the towns and
the huts to rout insurgents or any other
persons there."
In addition to civilian casualties from this
tactic, "these free-fire practices have in
creased the refugee flow from the coun
tryside into Kabul and also to Pakistan,"
he said.
The mines and sensors being dropped
along main Afghan trails are "like the
equipment we tried out on the Ho Chi
Minh trail years ago," the U.S. official
said.
"Free-fire zones" were one of the most
severely criticized U.S. tactics in Viet
nam. By declaring such zones, American
authorities sought to force Vietnamese
out of a region. But the effect was to
license indiscriminate shooting at any
thing that moved in the zone, inevitably
bringing about a high number of civilian
casualties and an exodus of refugees.
The official, who requested anonymity,

said the Soviets have
withdrawn only about 5000 men follow
ing their much-publicized announcement
last month that they would withdraw a
division. At least 80,000 Soviet soldiers
remain in Afghanistan, he said.
Tranquilizer ads changed
WASHINGTON — In an effort to cut
the vast overuse of tranquilizers, the Food
and Drug Administration has persuaded
drug-makers to tell doctors these pills
should not be used for"everday" stress.
Five companies, including Hoffman-
Laßoche, whose Valium and Librium are
taken by the millions, will begin saying in
their physician-directed advertisments:
"Anxiety or tension associated with the
stress of everday life usually does not re
quire treatment with an anxiolytic (anti
anxiety) drug."
The aim, FDA Commissioner Jere
Goyan said yesterday, is to reduce the use
of drugs "not clearly needed."
Judge says Iran must pay
WASHINGTON — A federal judge
yesterday issued the first court ruling in
the United States which holds that Iran
must compensate U.S. firms whose assets
were nationalized by the Iranian govern
ment.
U.S. District Judge George Hart Jr.
said Iran must pay three groups of U.S.
insurance companies whose assets and
capital investments were seized June 25,
1979.
Thomas Shack Jr., one of the attorneys
representing Iran, said the decision would
be appealed.
Hart said Iran's nationalization of the
insurance firms violated a 1955 treaty be
tween Iran and the United States in which
the countries agreed that compensation
would be paid when property is
nationalized.
The judge also said the failure to pay

compensation violated international law.
He noted the U.N.
General Assembly has voted that com
pensation should be paid when the prop
erty of another nation is nationalized.
Carter to aid auto industry
DETROIT — The auto industry and
the government, antagonists for 14 years,
have formed an alliance for survival that
appears unlike any other in the history of
U.S business.
The new auto industry committee an
nounced by President Jimmy Carter here
Tuesday will involve leaders of U.S. au
tomakers, the United Auto Workers and
government regulatory agencies in plan
ning a three-year recovery for the indus
try.
The president's brief announcement of
a new "close-knit, permanent relation
ship" was thin on details, but White
House aides said they hope a pattern has
been set for close cooperation to protect
and strengthen vital U.S. industries.
Carter also called for faster investiga
tion of the impact of Japanese imports,
which could lead to trade restrictions
against Japan later this year.
"We consider this the first part of a
national industrial policy," said chief
White House domestic adviser Stuart
Eizenstat.

ion shares, against 52.01 million Wed
nesday.
