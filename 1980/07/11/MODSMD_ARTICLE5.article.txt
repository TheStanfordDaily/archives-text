# Newspaper fights Daily case decision
## 
### Kathy Kemby Staff Writer 
Editors of a monthly newspaper in Mint,
Michigan and their A.C.L.U.-funded attor
ney are now preparing a case that they hope
will limit the Supreme Court's Z.urcher v.
The Stanford Daily decision of 1978 which
ruled that police with a warrant could search
newspaper offices even it the paper was an
innocent third party.
The impetus for the case came from a
surprise police search May 1 5 ot printing
offices of The Flint Voice. The police hoped
to seize an issue of the alternative paper
before it was published.
According to Howard Simon, head of the
Michigan A.C.L.U., the police seizure ot
The Voice files was the first such action since
the Daily decision two years ago.

News analysis

Simon stated that I he Voice is tiling its
case in the state of Michigan in order to
"enact a higher standard of freedom ot the
press in Michigan" than that which is now
found at the federal level and in most other
states.
Voice co-editor Alan Hirvela said that
the Daily decision gave police "an open
license to search offices of the press." Great
harm was done to the press by the Daily

decision since all reporters can now be
forced to reveal their sources, he said.
And the revelation of a source was the
spur to the police search ot Ihe Voice, ac
cording to llirvela.
At noon Nov. 2. The Voice printed a re
port issued by the Mint ombudsman which
verified an earlier Voice accusation that
Flint Mayor James Rutherford had forced
seven city members of the Comprehensive
Employee Training Act. a federally-funded
program that provides jobs and training, to
campaign for and donate to his re-election
campaign.
But according to a city charter, the om
budsman's report was not to be released to
the public until 4 p.m. that same day. The
report somehow had been leaked to /he
Voice.
Six months later The Voice printing office
was searched by Mint police wielding a
search warrant and hoping to ascertain the
origin of the ombudsman's report that ap
peared in the paper.
The Voice, fearing a search of its editorial
offices next, sought a court injunction pro
hibiting further police searches, Genessee
County Circuit Judge Phillip Elliot denied
the request but said that police could only
obtain a search warrant for The Voice of
fices from him or from a justice ot the
Michigan Supreme Court.

In a concurring opinion to the Daily deci
sion Justice Lewis Powell wrote, "While
there is no justification for the establish
ment of a separate Fourth Amendment pro
cedure for the press, a magistrate asked to
issue a warrant for the search of press offices
can and should take cognizance of the inde
pendent values protected by the 112 irst
Amendment."
In addition to the A.C.L.IJ., The Voice
claims support from the Reporter's Com
mittee for Freedom of the Press in
Washington, D C., in its attempt to test the
scope of the Daily decision.
Dissenting Justice John Paul Stevens
warned in the Daily ruling that
"Countless law-abiding citizens — doctors,
lawyers, merchants, customers, bystanders
may have documents 111 their possession
that relate to an on-going criminal investi
gation. The consequences ot subjecting this
laruc category of persons to unannounced
police searches arc extremely dangerous.
The Flint search was also not connected
with a felony charge as was the Daily case,
according to Hirvela. In the Hint case "no
one was charged with a crime." he said.
Daily offices were searched in order to
obtain information concerning assailants ot
police in a Stanford Hospital de
monstration.
