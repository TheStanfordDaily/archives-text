## Guofeng to resign 
### Jay Mathews The Washington Post 
PHKING â€” Chinese Premier
Hua Guofeng will give up his
post as head of the Chinese go\ -
ernment at a meeting of the Na
tional People's Congress in Au
gust. according to a knowledge
able Chinese official.
The official, quoted by dip
lomatic sources here yesterday,
said Hua will retain his posts as
chairman of the Communist
Party and of the Military Affairs
Commission, although limits are
also expected to be put on the
amount of time he can hold those
jobs.
Although Hua's departure as
premier has been rumored here
tor months, the diplomats said
the unnamed official was the first
the\ had encountered in a posi
tion to know who said a decision
had definitely been reached. He
did not name Hua's successor,
but most Chinese officials here
expect it to be Vice Premier
Zhao Xiyang, w ho now has con
trol of day-to-day affairs in the
state council, the center of Chi
na's government.
The removal of Hua as pre
mier would follow an unusual
number of public appearances he
has made in his role as head of
the Chinese army. Some analysts
here suggest Hua is making an
effort to increase his support
among army leaders who are un
happy about lack of financial

support trom the government to
buy new weapons.
Hua was named premier in
April three months after
the death of Premier Chou
En-lai and two days after a riot in
central Peking. The rioters op
posed radical Maoist policies and
apparently supported the mod
erate policies ol Vice Premier
Deng Xiaoping.
The government, under
Deng's influence in the last three
years, has doled out funds for
new, much-needed military
equipment \ery sparingly. The
official press has complained
about factionalism and ideologi
cal problems within the army.
The dispute now appears to
focus on w ho will succeed the ail
ing Xu Xiangqian. 7K; as defense
minister. Military analysts here
expected former Canton com
mander Xu Shiyou would come
to Peking to take the job, as a
long-time supporter of Deng,
but he has not yet appeared in
the job.
His position is said to have
been weakened by his reluctance
to criticize the memory of Mao,
whose image the Deng group
wishes to tarnish a bit, and by the
heavy casualties suffered by the
Chinese army under Xu's com
mand in its 1979 invasion of Vie
tnam. Another Deng candidate
might be Wei Guoqing, director
of the army's general political
department.
