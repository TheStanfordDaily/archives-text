President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr said yesterday the Iranian
government had thwarted a
planned military coup whose
plotters intended to bomb the
home of revolutionary leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
His statement indicated some of
the alleged conspirators may
have been killed.
Bani-Sadr. in a radio broad
cast. said he and other top offi
cials had been informed of the
coup plan a month ago and had
heen waiting to catch the plotters
"on the spot."
In a sketchy report June 12,
Tehran Radio said an anti
gen ernment plot had been unco
vered in the Iranian army. A
week later, it was announced
that 27 soldiers had been ar
rested in an anti-government
conspiracy.
Bani-Sadr said the plan in
volved bomb attacks on Kho
meini's home and other "clerical

places."
He said "some army person
nel" at Nouzhah barracks, near
the western Iranian city of
Hamadan, were behind the coup
bid.
"Some of the plotters were
punished last night when they
tried to carry out their plan," he
said. In Iran's current revolutio
nary vocabulary, "punish" often
means death.
In other developments, it was
reported Wednesday that Iran's
Revolutionary Council has de
cided a prime minister will be
chosen by next week, disposing
of one more preliminary before
Parliament debates the fate of
the 53 American hostages.

media, meanwhile, reported a
series of Iraqi air and ground at
tacks along Iran's western bor

least one Iraqi warplane and
three helicopters had been shot
down.
