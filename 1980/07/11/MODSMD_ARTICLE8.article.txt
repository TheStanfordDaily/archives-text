# OECD issues economic forecast
## 
### Don Cook The Los Angeles Times 
PARIS — The Organization
for Economic Cooperation and
Development issued a gloomy
forecast yesterday and warned
its 24 member nations that they
must continue to more cauti
ously in order to offset the in
flationary impact of higher oil
prices.
The OECD did not say how
soon the new oil prices
would work their way through
the economic systems, but
warned against any easing up of
monetary and fiscal policies too
soon, before real structural ad
justments are achieved.
"An oil price rise of over 130
percent since the end of 1978 has
increased the net oil import bill
by an amount equivalent to
about 2 percent of GNP (gross
national product), increased
prices by several percentage
points, and may — by the end of
1981 — have reduced OECD
real GNP by some 5 percent
compared with what it would
otherwise have been,"the report
said.
"Although tight fiscal and
monetary policies are essential
for creating the conditions
necessary for a restoration of ba
lanced growth, this is only a first
step on the long road to more
satisfactory growth and high

employment."
In the next six months, the
OECD experts see a moderate
slowing down of inflation from
around 12 percent overall to
below 10 percent by the early
part of next year. But they fore
case declining productivity for
the remainder of this year and
relatively weak investment all of
next year as well.
There will be an increase in
unemployment in the OECD
countries from around 20 million
at present to more than 23 mill
ion by mid-1981, or nearly 7
percent of the labor force, and
"over half of this increase could
occur in the United States," the
report predicted.
Thanks to increased oil prices,
the OECD countries are now
running a trade deficit of approx
imately $100 billion, bui with
tight monetary policies and de
clining oildemandthanks in part
to the general economic situa
tion, this will probably drop by
half in the early part of next year.
The OECD said that it is going
to take the next 12 to 18 months
to absorb the new round of oil
price increases — provided the
countries "are not subjected to
further large shocks."
The economic cycle the in
dustrial world is now passing
through was described in these
terms: "Higher oil prices lower
the purchasing power of domes

tic incomes by increasing the
quantities of goods and services
which have to be offered in ex
change for each barrel of oil.
This terms-of-trade change re
duces the volume of domestic
spending in the OECD
economy. The counterpart is an
increase in the real income of
OPEC (the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting States), but
OPEC is slow to spend this in
come so the total of domestic and
foreign spending in the OECD
economy tends to fall."
About the only hopeful note is
the OECD's conclusion that
"upward price pressures now
seem to have eased, at least for
the time being," with spot prices
now close to the top official
prices and freight rates also on
the decline. Lower economic
growth and lower stockpiling
"may lead to a reduction in
OECD oil consumption in 1980
of around 2 million barrels a day
and a fall in new oil imports of
around 2 million barrels a day."
It is hoped that this slackening
of demand will also ward off
another economic price shock
and give time for the present in
creases to be absorbed. But, as
the OECD comments, "the
prospect of rising unemploy
ment, rapid inflation and declin
ing real income ... is by any
normal standards unsatisfac
tory."
