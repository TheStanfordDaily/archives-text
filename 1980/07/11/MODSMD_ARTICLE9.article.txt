## GOP convention: Reagan's nomination certain 
### Walter Nears The Associated Press 
DETROIT — Ronald
Reagan, cast at last as the leading
man of the Republican Party,
claims his star billing Wednesday
night at a national convention
scripted as carefully as any movie
he ever made. And he made 55
of them.
The former governor of
California, long a champion of
Republican conservatism, is un
challenged for the nomination,
and his lieutenants are in control
of the proceedings.
There'll be moments of dissent
but it is, in fact, a convention
without contest, the ritual begin
ning of the Republican campaign
to regain the White House lost to
Jimmy Carter four years ago.
The 32nd GOF convention
opens on Monday, with song,
ceremony and speech after
speech after speech. All told,
there are 33 speakers on the
program, and that doesn't count
introductions.
Among the speakers are
Reagan's vanquished presiden

tial rivals, the former president
who narrowly defeated him for
the 1976 nomination, the 1964
nominee in whose campaign ser
vice Reagan began shaping his
political credentials.
The show begins on Monday
at 11 a.m. EDT, in cavernous Joe
Louis Arena, decked in red.
white and blue bunting, carpet
ing and fresh paint. The final
gavel is scheduled to fall at 11
p.m. on Thursday.
It will be a performance with
out suspense, save for the selec
tion of a vice presidential
nominee. That's up to Reagan,
and he is expected to announce
his choice next Thursday, for
ratification at the final conven
tion session that night.
The lineup of orators is dotted
with vice presidential prospects:
Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
former United Nations Ambas
sador George Bush, Senate Re
publican Leader Howard H.
Baker Jr., former Ambassador
to Great Britain Anne
Armstrong, former Secretary of

Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Rep.
Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan,
former Secretary of the Treasury
William Simon.
There are other names on the
guess-list, too, including those of
Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, the
Reagan campaign chairman; and
Rep. Tom Evans of Delaware.
But Reagan will make the de
cision, and he hasn't hinted at his
choice.
An Associated Press survey of
Republican delegates showed
more of them — about 20 per
cent — favor Bush than any of
the other prospects. But unless

Reagan wants him, that makes
no difference.
Bush still has 178 delegates
pledged to support him for the
presidential nomination, but he
quit the contest on May 26, last
to concede the nomination
among what once was a big field
of Reagan challengers. He's re
leasing his delegates to Reagan
as the convention opens.
His appearances prior to ac
cepting the nomination will be
rationed; Reagan doesn't plan to
work delegate caucuses as he had
to four years ago when he was
challenging then-President

Gerald R. Ford. Instead, Repub
lican leaders will come to him, by
invitation to his Plaza Hotel
suite.
It is Detroit's first national
political convention, and Repub
lican leaders say they are here to
demonstrate that the party is
concerned with the woes of the
cities and the minority Ameri
cans who live there.
Vander Jagt, the convention
keynote speaker, said the choice
of Detroit "was meant to sym
bolize our party's interest in and
concern for elements in our soci
ety from whom our party was
seen to be estranged."

Reagan's vanquished presiden

tial rivals, the former president
who narrowly defeated him for
the 1976 nomination, the 1964
nominee in whose campaign ser
vice Reagan began shaping his
political credentials.
The show begins on Monday
at 11 a.m. EDT, in cavernous Joe
Louis Arena, decked in red.
white and blue bunting, carpet
ing and fresh paint. The final
gavel is scheduled to fall at 11
p.m. on Thursday.
It will be a performance with
out suspense, save for the selec
tion of a vice presidential
nominee. That's up to Reagan,
and he is expected to announce
his choice next Thursday, for
ratification at the final conven
tion session that night.
The lineup of orators is dotted
with vice presidential prospects:
Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York,
former United Nations Ambas
sador George Bush, Senate Re
publican Leader Howard H.
Baker Jr., former Ambassador
to Great Britain Anne
Armstrong, former Secretary of

Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Rep.
Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan,
former Secretary of the Treasury
William Simon.
There are other names on the
guess-list, too, including those of
Sen. Paul Laxalt of Nevada, the
Reagan campaign chairman; and
Rep. Tom Evans of Delaware.
But Reagan will make the de
cision, and he hasn't hinted at his
choice.
An Associated Press survey of
Republican delegates showed
more of them — about 20 per
cent — favor Bush than any of
the other prospects. But unless

Reagan wants him, that makes
no difference.
Bush still has 178 delegates
pledged to support him for the
presidential nomination, but he
quit the contest on May 26, last
to concede the nomination
among what once was a big field
of Reagan challengers. He's re
leasing his delegates to Reagan
as the convention opens.
His appearances prior to ac
cepting the nomination will be
rationed; Reagan doesn't plan to
work delegate caucuses as he had
to four years ago when he was
challenging then-President

Gerald R. Ford. Instead, Repub
lican leaders will come to him, by
invitation to his Plaza Hotel
suite.
It is Detroit's first national
political convention, and Repub
lican leaders say they are here to
demonstrate that the party is
concerned with the woes of the
cities and the minority Ameri
cans who live there.
Vander Jagt, the convention
keynote speaker, said the choice
of Detroit "was meant to sym
bolize our party's interest in and
concern for elements in our soci
ety from whom our party was
seen to be estranged."
