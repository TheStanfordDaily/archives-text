# GOP convention opens in Detroit

From the Daily wire services
DETROIT — Ronald
Reagan, the reigning Republi
can, summoned his supporters to
a crusade ' to make America
great again" as the GOP opened
its clockwork convention yester
day with ritual vows to wrest the
White House from President
Jimmy Carter.
Reagan came in triumph to
claim the presidential nomina
tion and pick a vice presidential
partner for the fall campaign.
Virtually everything was settled
in advance, save Reagan's choice
of a running mate. He'll make
that selection tomorrow night,
after his own unchallenged
nomination.
"Gov. Reagan is 90 percent of
the way toward choosing Bush as
his running mate," one Reagan
intimate said yesterday.
Another well-placed Reagan
source said that "Bush was the
only political choice who makes
sense — and Gov. Reagan is
known for making sensible
choices."
On the convention floor,
Louisiana delegation chairman
John Cade Jr. said that it was his
feelings"that Bush is pretty well
decided on and the rest is just
window dressing. 1 can't believe
the way (Reagan) has
come to Detroit today and
doesn't know who the vice presi
dential nominee is."
But while Cade favors Bush,
his delegation voted 2 to 1 in
support of Rep. Jack Kemp ol
New York for vice president, and
the Oklahoma, Arizona and
Washington delegations also
lined up behind Kemp as
battlelines were drawn in the
convention.
Among the delegates there
seemed little sentiment for the
three other prospective running
mates supposedly on Reagan's
list — Indiana Sen. Richard G.
Lugar, former Secretary of De

fense Donald H. Rumsfeld and
Tennessee Sen. Howard H.
Baker Jr. An NBC survey of
more than 77 percent of the de
legates found Bush leading in
preferences with 47 percent (731
delegates), and Kemp second
with 35 percent (537 delegates).
Reagan's welcoming rally at
the Detroit Plaza Hotel was as
carefully staged as the no
contest convention down the
street, and played to a crowd that
packed the lobby, cheering and
chanting his name.
Beaming, waving, clutching
outstretched hands, Reagan
worked his way across the lobby
with his wife, Nancy, at his side.
Republicans hired their con
vention halls in a Democratic
city, and Reagan said they were
in the right place to dramatize
Carter's economic failures.
"It's very obvious that all of
you know, all of us know, why
we're here, the need for a
crusade in this country today,
and I'm glad that it's in this city
that is really riding point with re
gard to the economic problems
that have been brought on us by
this administration in
Washington,"he said.
"We are determined, all of us,
to change this and to make
America great again," he said.
Right on time. Republican
Party Chairman Bill Brock rap
ped the gavel to begin the 32nd
Republican National Conven
tion, four days and nights of
speech and celebration that will
award Reagan the nomination
he has sought for a dozen years,
then ratify his choice of a vice
presidential partner.
The convention was scripted
right down to the minute. It
began with two hours of midday
routine, and a sendoff speech hy
Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
who is campaigning to be
Reagan's vice presidential
choice as ardently as anyone can.
