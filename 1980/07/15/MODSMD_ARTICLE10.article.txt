# Domestic gold goes on sale
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Starting today, Americans
can buy domestic gold in small quantities when the
Treasury Department begins taking orders for
one-ounce and half-ounce medallions.
The medallions — both slightly larger than a
quarter — are the first of 10 that the federal gov
ernment intends to sell over the next five years.
Each medallion will honor a different American
artist. One million half-ounce medallions, with a
portrait of singer Marian Anderson, and 500,000
one-ounce medals, commemorating painter Grant
Wood, are being struck this year.
Prices of the medallions will be based on the
previous day's closing price of gold on the New
York Commodity Exchange, plus $12 for the
Wood medal and $6 for the Anderson medal to
cover production and distribution costs.

Initially, the medallions will be sold only through
post offices, with a limit of three medals of each size
per person. The Treasury Department said orders
are expected to be accepted until Sept. 30, with
delivery taking eight to 12 weeks.
Because the price will fluctuate daily, postal
clerks will validate orders when they are mailed.
Prices are to be available daily via toll-free tele
phone numbers — 800-368-5510 for most people
and 800-368-5500 for residents of Alaska, Hawaii,
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
Although Americans have had the right to own
gold since 1974, when it was removed as a monet
ary standard, there has been no U.S.-produced
coin available for sale at a price the public could
afford, except for special medallions struck during
the nation's Bicentennial in 1976.
