# Airline stock prices fly upward
## 
### Ken Gepfert The Los Angeles Times 
When the nation's airlines
start reporting their second quar
ter earnings this week, the
number will be scary enough to
star in an airplane disaster

movie. Analysts expect the in
dustry's bottom line to be awash
in red ink for the third successive
quarter.
Yet, on Wall Street, airline
stock prices are cruising upward.
Since the beginning of June,
21 of 23 carriers tracked by
Value Line Investment Survey
have shown gains in price. Three
airlines even hit 52-week highs,
and trading in one of those —
USAir — was so heavy that
one-sixth of its oustanding
shares changed hands in seven
days.
Airline analysts say investors'
behavior is perfectly under
standable for several reasons:
— Airlines' fuel costs, which
doubled in one year, finally have
started to stabilize.
One very positive develop
ment, several analysts said, was a
Civil Aeronautics Board deci
sion last May granting airlines
broad new authority to raise
many fares without government
permission.

— Airlines' passenger traffic
has held up better than expected
during the recession.
— Airlines' stock values tradi
tionally have started to rebound
early in a recession — usually
about five months prior to the
low point of the overall
economic downturn, according
to one analyst. Institutional in
vestors, well aware of this tradi
tion, have turned to the airlines
in search of bargains.
Investor awareness of these
factors combined to stop the
slide in price of airline securities
in late April — about the same
time many trunk carriers were
omitting dividends and reporting
first quarter losses that totaled
$226 million.
The carriers' stocks, which
tend to move as a group, have
increased about 40 percent in
value since then. "When they
move, they move like bandits,"
said Robert Joedicke, an analyst
for the New York brokerage of
Lehman Bros. Kuhn Loeb.
