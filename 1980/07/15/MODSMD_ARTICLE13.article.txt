## GOP is archaic 
### 
The Republican Party
nominating convention, meeting
this vseek in Detroit, has offi
cially ushered in this year's pres
idential campaign fanfare. And.
in the true sense of tradition rep
resentative of its middle name,
the GOP meeting, replete with
banners, hats and elephants,
superficially resembles pre\ious
such affairs. Unfortunately, on a
deeper level, its platform and
policy decisions also harken back
to a bygone era.
Hailing 19N0 as a banner year,
the Republican Party and its
messiah. Ronald Reagan, are
presently embarking upon a
crusade to "make America great
again." Thus, the party freely
admits that it is pursuing a path
of regression. If its convention
platform is an accurate indica
tion of its members' desires, the
GOP is presenting the American
public with goals and methods as
dated as its eventual nominee.
To the delight of conservative
stalwart. Sen. Jesse Helms
(N.C.), delegates "wrote the
platform to fit what (Reagan's)
has been saying all these years."
In the platform committee,
right-wing hardliners rammed
through a plank favoring a con
stitutional amendment to ban all
abortions, no doubt in accord
with Reagan's born-again,
right-to-life ideology.
In the same vein, the plat
form's judiciary plank, in a
statement termed "the most out
rageous thing I have ever seen in
a Republican platform" by Sen.
Charles Percy (III.), endorsed
only those judges who oppose
abortions and recognize "the
sanctity of innocent human life."
Most distressing of all. the

con\ ention turned its back on its
40-year support of the Equal
Rights Amendment. By a vote ot
90-9, the platform commitee
spurned its former language cal
ling for an F.RA addition to the
Constitution and included an
open-minded compromise
acknowledging "the legitimate
efforts of those who support or
oppose ratification" of the prop
osed amendment.
GOP foreign policy precepts
are also aligned with those ot a
candidate who would urge that
the United States blockade
Cuba. Faithful to mold, the party
platform defamed the Panama
Canal treaties as an "unfortu
nate giveaway" and rebuked
American aid to "the Marxist re
gime in Nicaragua."
All in all. the platform and the
convention are filled with the
usual Republican blandish
ments. along with popularly in
novative ideas like tax cuts. Its
rhetoric bespeaks, in the moder
ate Percy's words, "the worst
sort of extremism of the 1964
convention reincarnated." Its
catch phrases are those of a man
who really hasn't changed his
thinking in the past 30 years.
True, the country as a whole
has turned to the right since the
upheavals of the '60s. But, the
Republican Party, rather than
move to meet that surge, has
shifted further to the conserva
tive fringe. Maybe the 22 percent
of the voters who are registered
Republican do adhere to the an
tiquated philosophy of the "uni
fied" convention. We doubt it.
Moreover, we are sure that the
entire electorate will not be
swept onto a bandwagon of
"fond" remembrances.
