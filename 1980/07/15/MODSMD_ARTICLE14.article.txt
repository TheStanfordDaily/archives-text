## Private capital can change slums 
### 
It is hard to imagine a worse
case of urban decay than the
South Bronx in New York City.
Once a middle class area with a
population of over a half million,
it has degenerated into a crime
ridden wasteland.
The deterioration of the South
Bronx can be traced to the inter
ference of all levels of govern
ment in the economic life of the
area over four decades. Since
World War 11 rent controls froze
rents at their 1943 levels. The
middle class fled from rental
units that could not be main
tained by their landlords. Fed
eral incentives such as FHA and
GI housing mortgages lured
people away to other areas of
New York City. Housing quality
declined.
During the 1940s and '50s
large numbers of poor blacks and
Puerto Ricans were drawn to
New York by the promise of high
wages and a good life. Many
of these people did not get jobs
and became additions to the wel
fare rolls. The vacated South

Bronx began to fill with welfare
cases.
People were thrown out of
jobs when New York City began
to jack up taxes to finance liberal
education and pension programs
and feed exorbitant union appe
tites. Businesses were driven out
of the city in droves by the puni
tive tax structure. The exodus
took away what little hope was
left for the poor to get jobs. Wel
fare rolls swelled.
Today the South Bronx is a
war zone. The chances of serving
prison time for a felony are less
than one in a hundred. Over 30
fires a day occur in the South
Bronx, at least 10 of which are
suspected by authorities of being
deliberately set. Welfare families
burn down their own apartments
to earn welfare disaster assis
tance.
Government efforts to reverse
the decline have simply failed.
The traditional government sol
ution of the 1960s and '70s was
to reward cities for having bligh
ted areas by giving them federal

money. Millions of dollars under
evtry program from Model
Cities to Employment Training
Assistance have poured into the
wasteland with no effect.
But a bill introduced in Con
gress by Rep. Jack Kemp
(R-NY) in May could bring life
back to the South Bronx. The bill
is a novel effort to attack the
problem of urban slums with pri
vate dollars instead of taxpayers'
dollars.
Kemp's Enterprise Zone Act
would draw a green line around
the South Bronx and declare a
tax holiday within its borders.
For a period of years, say 20, all
enterprises in the zone would
have their tax bills reduced or
waived. Businesses would be
lured in to set up shop by this tax
carrot.
The effect on the South Bronx
would be dramatic. Without
producing a new bureaucracy or
spending any federal funds, jobs
would be created to take the un
employed off welfare. The area
could turn from a rathole for
federal money into an urban area
that pays its own way.
Kemp's idea has stirred cauti
ous optimism in such unlikely
places as the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of
Colored People. NAACP
Chairwoman Margaret Wilson
and Urban League President
Vernon Jordan both expressed
interest in Kemp's bill.
Since the 19605, the govern
ment sledgehammer has not
eliminated the slums in our
major cities with money or prog
rams. The time has come for a
solution that allows private en
terprise to build up poor
neighborhoods rather than let
ting the government try to tear
them down.
