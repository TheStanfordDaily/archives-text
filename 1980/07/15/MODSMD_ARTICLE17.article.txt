## Bush should be Reagan's pick 
### 
This week, which marks the
return to television stardom of
one of our favorite actors of the
past, the eyes of America turn to
the mini-series known as the Re
publican National Convention.
Although a more accurate title
might he"The Ronald Reagan
Coronation Show," the event
has some political significance
besides the now completed orig
inal task of choosing a presiden
tial nominee.

The most attention will be
given to Reagan's choice of a
running mate. Because of
Reagan's age, many consider the
vice-presidential spot more criti
cal in this case than in past years.
This applies to the increased
chance of an emergency ascen
sion to the presidency, as well as
the probability that the ex
governor will not run for re
election in 1984, leaving his
vice-president as heir apparent.
Public concern over Reagan's
death in office is unwarranted.
The governor is in excellent
health, as evidenced by his ap
pearances throughout his vigor
ous campaign, as well as pub
lished medical reports. The polit
ical question is valid; if Reagan
chooses not to run in 1984, the
vice-president would be a strong
candidate for the Republican
nomination.
Reagan needs a man who has
what it takes to be president if
necessary and one who will have
a useful role in the Reagan ad
ministration. He needs someone
who is a proven manager, dip
lomat, and leader. The vice
president must be knowledge

able in foreign policy and in deal
ing with Congess. And, perhaps
the most politically important at
tribute: he must be publicly per
ceived to have all of these qualifi
cations, in the interest of na
tional confidence.
The logical choice would ap
pear to be George Bush of
Texas. As Ambassador to the
U.N., a U.S. Congressman, Di
rector of the CIA, and Republi
can Party leader, he has shown
the skills necessary for such an
administrative position.
The press seems to feel that
Bush has become Reagan's
likely choice anyway, but the
bigger question is: what does this
tell us about Ronald Reagan?
Whatever decision he makes, the
choice of a competent, proven
administrator will be an early
sign to a scrutinizing America
that Reagan can make the kinds
of choices we want a president to
make.
