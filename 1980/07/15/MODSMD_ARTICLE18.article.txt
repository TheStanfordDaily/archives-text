## Computer a menace 
### 
On November 9, 1979, the
computer of the North American
Air Defense (NORAD), de
signed to issue warning of an at
tack from the Soviet Union, indi
cated a submarine-launched bal
listic missile attack. Three times
in seven months this piece of
electronic equipment placed
America's strategic nuclear
forces on alert, bringing the
world to the brink of nuclear
holocaust because of an elec
tronic malfunction.
Senior Pentagon officials sub
sequently admitted that they
would not have confessed to
these potentially catastrophic er
rors if word of them had not pre
viously leaked to the press.
Nonetheless some facts have
come to light:
— a CBS Inc. computer expert
who has evaluated the Pentagon
computer system for 18 months
has concluded that the system is
incapable of coping with a na
tional emergency;
— it was revealed that the
NORAD computer is inacti
vated or thrown off in its calcula
tions when commercial power
lines in the area are struck by
lightning;

— the president was not alerted
to any of the scares, leaving the
decision as to the survival or
death of mankind in the hands of
senior Pentagon officials;
— authority to make such
apocalyptic decisions has been
delegated to major overseas
commanders definitely during
the Eisenhower and Kennedy
administrations and probably
during the Johnson, Nixon and
Ford administrations;
— in March of 1976, America's
ballistic missile early warning
radar in Greenland generated a
large-scale attack alert in re
sponse to radar reflections off
the moon;
— similar systems have iden
tified Venus or flocks of geese as
enemy attacks;
— The silent senior officials of
the Pentagon are currently pon
dering a hair-trigger early alert
system at no point involving
human decisions.
Hawks and doves alike should
realize that neither computers
nor humans are fail-safe. The
only national security is in inter
national disarmament
