# Speaker tells how to manage stress
## 
### Liz Rosner Staff Writer 
If you're suffering from
nervousness, exhaustion and
irritability, you may be
exhibiting some of the
symptoms of thiamine defi
ciency. But look again, be
cause these are also some of
the common manifestations
of stress.
The intimate relationship
between an individual's
biochemical conditions and
stress was the theme of last
Wednesday's session of the
Stress Management course
sponsored by STARTS.
The workship is taught by
Al Scopp, Ph.D., program di
rector of the Bay Area Pain/
Rehabilitation Center at
O'Connor Hospital in San
Jose. It is designed as an in
tegrated approach to stress
management, combining in
formational lectures and dis
cussion with deep relaxation
exercises.
According to Scopp, the
workshop is a means of "giv
ing people the tools to lower
stress as well as tools to de
velop greater self-awareness.
But it's up to the individual to
use the tools effectively."
It is also an "active ap
proach," Scopp claims, in
volving a "triad of elements:
1) beliefs, thoughts and at
titudes; 2) nutritional,
biochemical aspects, and 3)
exercise."
In last week's lecture on
"Nutrition and Stress,"
Scopp explained that stress,
defined as a physiological
event, involves the body
burning nutrients, vitamins
and minerals faster than nor
mal. If the body is deficient in
certain nutrients, an indi
vidual is likely to be more sus
ceptible to stress. Further
more, he said, depletion of
these nutrients during stress
ful periods results in the ten
dency to stay stressed longer.
Scopp emphasized that,
"Everyone is biochemically
unique . . . therefore, the op
timal nutritional require
ments vary from individual to
individual."
He encouraged the group
to seek professional help in
order to determine their par
ticular nutritional needs.

"Anyone interested in mov
ing toward wellness should
have a hair analysis to deter
mine amounts of calcium and
magnesium present," he said.
"People under stress tend
to he too high in calcium and
magnesium and low in other
important minerals," Scopp
explained.
He also pointed out the im
portance of Vitamin C. which
he says the body consumes a
great deal of under stress.
"It's said that when you're
angry for three minutes, your
body uses up 60(1 mg. of Vit
amin C." Scopp said, and ad
vised the group to take extra
Vitamin C.
A 30-minute relaxation
exercise followed the 50 mi
nute lecture. The 20 particip
ants found comfortable posi
tions on the floor â€” most
lying prone on their backs
with shoes removed. With the
lights off, Scopp proceeded to
talk the group through a rela
xation technique involving
deep breathing, isolating and
relaxing areas of the body
from feet to head, and con
centrating on relaxing par
ticularly tense regions, im
agining lungs and diaphragm
filling and releasing air like
big balloons.
In the final minutes of the
exercise, participants were to
picture themselves in a very
stressful situation, remaining
calm and in control.
A woman working for the
AFL-CIO cited her interest
in occupational stress as the
primary reason for being in
the course.
"Stress is a killer," she said.
"There is a need to promote
programs for stress reduction
both for the labor movement
and the entire community."
