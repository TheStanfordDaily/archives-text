# Verity calls for more business in politics
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
A new commitment by the
American business community
to get more involved in politics
in this November's elections,
could establish a "pro
enterprise" government, ac
cording to C. William Verity,
chairman of the United States
Chamber of Commerce.
Verity's address last Friday,
to over 100 members of the
Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco, was part ot a
nationwide program called
"Let's Rebuild America in the
'80s," sponsored by the
chamber.
The program is aimed at
local business communities and
stresses the need for grassroot
support to limit government
spending, increase exports,
remove unnecessary govern
ment regulations, and, in short,
"rebuild America's economic
base," he explained.
Verity called for concerted,
local campaign strategies by
business interests this fall, to

elect a president, 17 senators
and 73 congressmen who will
work to form a "coalition to
support pro-enterprise legisla
tion.
He blamed unsoundlcon
sumer credit practices ana an
administration "with the idea
that government can do all
things for all people," for the
nation's current economic

problems. He predicted the
federal deficit for 1980 will hit
$65 billion, adding, "It's time
to go on the offensive.
"What American business
must do is go out and educate
the politicians to get rid of their
cynical attitudes toward busi
ness. If you can't educate them,
then be active in finding their
replacements," he said.
"Pay attention to how he
(the politician) vbtes, not to
what he says," Verity added.
Verity stressed the need for
business leaders to rally behind
Senate Bill 2773, the National
Export Policy Act of 1980,
which he said would loosen the
"stranglehold" posed by gov
ernment over-regulation of
American corporations.
Yet, he also said the gov
ernment should aid American
car manufacturers by stopping
the "unfair importing of
foreign cars," until at least
1983, when American corpora
tions will again be competing
with foreign manufacturers.
Verity, who is also the

chairman of the hoard of
Armco, Inc., the nation's fifth
largest steel firm, faulted the
Carter administration for what
he called a "Marshall plan
mentality.
"Trying to dictate what is
right and wrong has lost us a lot
of trade partners," he said. The
key to world peace is strong
trade between the United
States and other countries â€”
including the Soviet Union, he
added.
In closing. Verity said the
business community should
face the challenge of making its
values acceptable to young
people. "Twelve years ago, the
businessman would be booed
off major university campuses.
Today college students are at
tending school to learn busi
ness and economics in greater
numbers than ever.
"It's up to us to show that
those values are the right
ones," he said.
The 63-year-old Verity said
he will be taking the chamber's
