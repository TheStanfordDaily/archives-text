# Groups denied frosh info.

### Chris Rogers Staff Writer 
Student-run groups have
been denied access to freshmen
information cards, making it dif
ficult for the groups to directly
recruit before freshman orien
tation.
Spring Quarter this year, the
Committee on Entering Stu
dents (CES) in conjunction with
the Registrar, the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies, the Dean of
Student Affairs, and the Sub-
Committee of Undergraduate
Studies, determined that it
would become a stated policy
that no student-run group would
be allowed access to the
freshmen preference cards.
Freshmen, prior to registra
tion, fill out a card which indi
cates their interests, hobbies and
experience. These "preference"
cards are stored at the Academic
Information Center.
Groups that have used the
cards in the past to recruit are
worried about getting their or
ganizations running in order to
meet the needs of Fall Quarter.
These groups include the
LSJUMB; the Daily; KZSU,
most choral, musical and acting
groups and many minority or
ganizations.
Both the Daily and KZSU
launch into full operation at the
beginning of Fall Quarter and
thus need a full staff to operate.
In the case of performing groups,
performing areas such as the au
ditoriums must be booked in ad
vance. According to one per
forming group member, it is dif
ficult to make a schedule when
you don't know if you are going
to have a viable group.
The Band, according to Band
manager Bruce Heiman, is in a
difficult position. It has no con
trol over its schedule, which is
determined by the Pac-10
Commissioners. The Band has
no choice but to have a fully via
ble group by a pre-detcrmined
date.
The decision to ban use of the

information cards was made be
cause it was felt that the release
of freshman's addresses was an
invasion of privacy, said Profes
sor Orrin Robinson, Chairman
of the CES. He also said that it
probably was not legally defen
sible.
He said that he felt under
graduates do not want a label
tagged onto them as soon as they
arrive at Stanford and that the
advance contact from student
groups put unwarranted pres
sure upon entering freshmen to
join specific groups.
The ban was applied unilater
ally to prevent any one group
from seeming to have been sing
led out for preferential treat
ment.
According to Heiman, re
cruitment for all groups will now
take place only through informa
tion given by the RA's, during
Orientation Week and in the
orientation packages given to
each freshman.
Robinson said it must be stres
sed that use of these lists for
freshman recruitment is very
much a gray area and that there
has never been any formal policy
regarding who has, or is denied,
access to them.
The use of the cards probably
started "as a fluke" said Robin
son. "Someone may have used
the cards in the past and the facil
ity came into general use as time
passed."
The Band, according to
Heiman is a particulary special
case. The Band is a class as well
as a student group. Heiman said
he feels that if the AIC has the
right to contact freshmen about
freshmen seminars, then the
Band should have the right as an

academic entity to contact the
freshmen.
Heiman suggests another pos
sible solution as putting a yes/no
box on the "preference" card
that allows the freshmen to de
cide whether they would allow
access to their cards.
Heiman points out the prob
lem the Band has faced, and will
face, due to the ban.
This year, Heiman said, the
Boston College opener is on Sep
tember 20. This is immediately
followed by the UCLA game (in
Los Angeles this year) on Oc
tober 1 I, as well as a game
against San Jose in the interrim.
Heiman said that if Orienta
tion is on September 22 that only
leaves 20 or so days to recruit,
practice and polish the Band into
performance quality. Heiman
added that the problem this year
is greatly aggravated by the fact
that a large number of people
graduated this past June, leav ing
the Band at about 100, when its
lull strength should be about
144.
"There's a lot of ground to be
made up in a short time,"
Heiman said.
In previous years Band Camp
was held the week of orienta
tion, and Heiman said, access to
the freshmen mailing list
brought a high attendance, com
pared to last year's poor atten
dance when access was refused
for the first time.
"This," Heiman said, "re
sulted in a Band well below par."
