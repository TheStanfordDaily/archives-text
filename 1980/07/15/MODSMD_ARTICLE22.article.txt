# Medicare withdraws aid for heart transplantation
## 
### Gail Edmondson-Schares Staff Writer 
Medicare coverage of heart
transplantation costs has been
withdrawn pending initiation of
a study on the medical, social,
economic and ethical consequ
ences of the procedure.
The study, announced June 12
by Secretary of Health and
Human Sciences, Patricia Har
ris, will begin in September
19K0, and will probably involve
the University hospital. Under
the proposed plan, any institu
tion which is chosen toparticpate
in the government study will be
reimbursed by Medicare for
"appropriate costs."
Medical Center surgeons Dr.
Norman Shumway and Dr. Ed
ward Stinson said they were not
sure what the impact of the with
drawal of Medicare funding
would have on the program at
Stanford. However, the im
mediate effects arc clearly less
threatening than the potential
long range impact of the study.
Since Stanford will most likely be
included in the study. Medicare
funding here will probably be re
stored for two to four years, be
ginning in September.
Currently, no patients who
have been referred to the Medi
cal Center for consideration of a
transplant are Medicare be
neficiaries. "We would be
greatly concerned if transplant
candidates had to be discrimi
nated against between now and
September," said Lois Christ
opherson, chief clinical social
work in charge of the cardiac
transplant program at Stanford.
High priority
According to Ross Campbell,
legal counsel for the Medical
Center, government officials say
they have given high priority to
this project and will work with
Stanford to solve any problems
that arise between now and Sep
tember.
Medicare-eligible patients

who have received heart trans
plants and continue to need
treatment, and those eligible
persons already accepted for a
transplant at the Stanford Medi
cal Center and the University of
Arizona Hospital will be funded
by Medicare.
The transplant team at Stan
ford is mainly concerned with the
outcome of the study and the ef
fect of the government's decision
on third-party payers, such as
private insurance companies.
According to Christopherson,
problems will arise if private in
surance companies balk as a re
sult of the withdrawal of "medi
care sanction" (i.e. Medicare
funding) of the procedure. How
ever, so far no one has followed
Medicare's lead.
"If they do, we will indeed be
reduced to a very small program,
accessible only to the rich, or to
the four to six patients which are
covered by research grants,"
Christopherson said.
'Optimistic support'
Medical Center heart sur
geons are expressing "optimistic
support" of the government
plan. They feel it is appropriate
for Medicare to study new inno
vations in medicine and to
evaluate the potential benefit of
such procedures. The Stanford
team is "eager to cooperate and
hopeful of the results of the
study," according to Christ
opherson.
Dr. Shumway and his team be
lieve heart transplantation is
both "reasonable and neces
sary" therapy for a select group
of patients with untreatable
heart disease. Without such
therapy, 90 percent of those pa
tients will die within two months.
Stanford hopes to have a lot of
input into the study," Campbell
stated.
The survival statistics for heart
transplants performed at the
Medical Center are indeed en
couraging. Based on results dat

ing from January 1974, to the
present, nearly 70 percent of the
heart transplant patients treated
by Dr. Shumway's team survive
the first year. The survival rate at
five years is 50 percent.
Willem Van Buuren, the
longest surviving heart trans
plant patient, has lived ten and
one-half years with his new
heart. Another Stanford heart
transplant patient will have sur
vived the operation 10 years in
August, and two people will
reach nine years during 19N0.
'Many unknowns*
"Certainly, there are many
unknowns, and there is a need
for further research, especially in
immunology," Christopherson
said, "hut we no longer consider
our program experimental.
The Medical Center heart
transplant team describes its
work as "clinical research," to
stress the medical benefits which
patients receive from transplan
tation.
Ninety percent of Stanford's
patients are successfully rehabili
tated and return to normal lives.
"To call our program experi
mental negates the clinical be
nefits of our work; those youths
entering college who had trans
plants at 12 or 13. those graduat
ing from college, starting
careers, and leading active nor
mal lives because they have re
ceived a transplant," Christ
opherson said.
"There are two reasons be
hind the government's decision
to study heart transplants," Dr.
Shumway said. "They are con
cerned about being democratic.
. . . and they are worried that
many hospitals will take up heart
transplantation if Medicare sanc
tion is given to the procedure."
Both concerns center on the
economics and ethics of heart
transplantation.
Concern about funding
The decision to study heart
transplants is part of the gov

ernment s increasing concern
about funding new medical
techniques and technologies be
fore effectiveness criteria are es
tablished.
The government is also con
cerned about the economic con
sequences of the potential
spread of interest in performing
heart transplants. Competing
social needs force the govern
ment to focus on the economics
of heart transplantation: In a
time of budgetary constraints
and limited resources, is it cost
efficient to fund an operation
which aids only a small portion of
the population?
There are currently five medi
cal centers in the United States
which perform transplants regu
larly (Stanford, University of
Arizona, Virginia, New York
and Wisconsin). Several more
hospitals are considering trying
the procedure, or have per
formed one or two heart trans
plants already.
Cost to society
Despite the seemingly enorm
ous cost of a heart transplant and
subsequent hospitalization
($40,000 to $1000.000). the op
eration may be cost-efficient in
some cases. One study by an ac

tuarial expert at London's City
University revealed that the cost
to society of treating a man in
capacitated by heart disease, and
supporting his dependent family
for four years would be $7 1,300.
Even if the man received no
treatment, and died im
mediately, the cost to society
would be $69,000. These figures
include estimates of the value ol
the patient's work, the loss of his
direct contributions in tax and
Social Security, and the cost ot
maintaining a dependent family
in benefits for four years.
On the brighter side. Dr.
Philip Oyer, assistant professor
of cardiovascular surgery at the
University, revealed that the cost
of heart transplantation at the
Medical Center could be greatly
reduced: "The developmental
phase of the program was costly
â€” they did things they don't do
anymore: they ordered more lab
tests than they needed, more
X-rays, etc. It all adds up." A
doctor in Cambridge, England, is
doing the same operation they
do at Stanford, tor half the cost,
according to Oyer. In addition,
new immunosuppressive drugs
may help reduce the cost of heart
transplantation.
