## drama /lisa bucholz 'Suicide in Bb': good, but not Shepard's best 
### 
Existential murder mysteries
can leave one with a great thirst
for a double scotch or some other
escape hatch. Suicide in
which opened Stanford Summer
Theatre's season last Wednesday
under the direction of Leigh
Sealy, is no exception, and I sup
pose that's a good sign.
As a work, Sam Shepard's
Suicide in does not approach
his Mad Dog Blues or Cowboy
Mouth. It suffers from Shepard's
redundancy of theme and image
(cowboys, bacon-lettuce-and
tomato sandwiches, jazz and
rock music are here as catch
phrases rather than meaningful
symbols) and his penchant for
excessive autobiography

wherein the play turns inward
more and more. The "viability,"
the "spokesmanship." the elec
tric outward movement for
which Mad Dog Blues is so ad
mired. is lacking.
Given the introspective nature
of the play, the actors must en
gage us less by feelings of associ
ation than by the importance and
magnitude of their passion. It's a
difficult task — as our particular
generation is somewhat alien
tated from Shepard's dearest
subjects. I sometimes wondered
if the actors really understood
these attitudes. Shepard's
"Jazzy dripping" hasn't the cult
following it once did.
Shepard opts for ambiguity of

plot, time and place, the latter
achieved by John Rathman's
splendid set and complimentary
lighting — an eerie space hung
with foil strips that absorb and
reflect the light to create depths
and subliminal shadows.
The plot itself is simple: two
detectives, Pablo (Van
Abercrombie-Engelhardt) and
Louis (Doug Schuetz), investi
gate a murder which has occured
in the apartment of a well-known
jazz musician, Niles (Leigh
Sealy). What happens is not sim
ple. The two detectives, an ill
assorted pair, discover in the
course of their investigation that
they are terrifyingly part of many
realities — most significantly
Niles'.
Niles" musicians, Petrone
(Todd Salovey) and Laureen
(Coco McPherson). who haunt

his apartment waiting for a re
hearsal to begin, have no identity
of their own — they are merely
that part of Niles, his musicians.
Salovey, with his thin, goofy
body and labored delivery is
quite good as the parasitic sax
player, Petrone. His only valida
tion is that he is Niles' musician.
Salovey's earnestness suggests
all the resignation of this role.
"I'm part of the scum of the
earth," he offers in his good
natured way.
Laureen, who again is not so
much a bassist as she is Niles'
bass player, buffers the unpleas
ant consciousness of the uncer
tainty of identity and existence
with heavy sarcasm; Coco
McPherson had a marvelous
grasp of this aspect of her charac
ter. She curled herself around
her instrument with sensual and

disdainful concentration,
sprawled in chairs, sneered, tap
ped her foot to some silent bass
line. "This music plays itself,"
she drawls to the confused detec
tives. McPherson was the bored
accessory to that music's per
formance.
Pablo and Louis, the detec
tives, are our inlet into this pri
vate insantiy. Their roles are dif
ficult because through them
Shepard demands that the audi
ence acknowledge its own mad
ness. Van Abercrombie-
Engelhardt as Pablo carries the
first part of this action: his
thick-skinned, drop-jaw in
credulity and condescending
squint are perfect for the sleazy
detective (white belt, polyester
shirt) bent on impressing big
names by solving the case. Un
fortunately, while Pablo does
become party to Niles' problems
of definitive reality, the transi
tion simply wasn't devastating
enough.
Finally, Niles himself— it is a
performance I am loathe to
criticize, since Leigh Sealy re
placed the ailing Brian Wool
liams at the very last moment.
Niles is the legend itself, the
creating and forming reality, the
source of the music that plays it
self. For Petrone, he is a great
"Kodiak bear." For all the
characters he is a mystery.
At times, Sealy did not seem to
feel himself to be the focus of the
play. This is essential, for, after
all, it is his exploration and his
murder/suicide. Niles must pro
vide a core, not merely another
reflection of the chaos. Sealy was
most moving in the moment
when he turned on Petrone, re
fusing responsibility for the sax
player's existence, and also in an
anxious moment where he strug
gles with himself over the mur
der of one of his multiple selves.
Sealy's gruff voice and demeanor
— he is not willing to plead, but
his attachment to these "friends"
is too great to let them go unsung
— conveycd the dilemma well.
Suicide in requires that all
of its characters sustain too long
soliloquies and repetitive, over
extended actions, but this is an
organic weakness. All the per
formers handle these demands,
victimized occasionally by the
weight and talkiness of the script.
I should mention that the play
is also full of Shepard's charac
teristic zest, slangy, dialogue and
witty social observations. David
Birnbaum, the secretive piano
player, adds a delicate musical
counterpoint to the action. At
the same time. Suicide is "visual
music" (as Niles describes his
work) — perhaps a fugue —
complicated, overlapping itself,
harrowing in itsdiffuseness, Patti
Smith, a long-time associate of
Shepard, wrote in a poem "Sam
Shepard can usually be found
parked down at the docks/ . . .
with a six pack of Carta Blanca
and a daily racing form" —
perhaps he knows best how to
deal with his vision.
Waiter, a double scotch.
