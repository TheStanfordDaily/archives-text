## Jackson Browne's newfound optimism 
### 
Hold Out
Jackson Browne
Elektra/Asylum
Musically, Jackson Browne's
new album Hold Out sounds
much the same as his previous
albums, but this is not to say that
Hold Out is especially similar to
anything Browne has done be
fore.
The forerunners to Hold Out,
notably Late for the Sky and The
Pretender, have laid bare the
structure of a society bent on an
nihilation. Browne's songs have
always been full of lost suburbia
and images of a blank California
desert landscape, and his
scenarios usuallv describe a race

of people in need of salvation.
Hold Out follows this tradition.
Up until now, however,
Browne's conclusion has been
that "nothing survives/ but the
way we live our lives." On Hold
Out, Browne takes this conclu
sion one step further and
explores its meaning. 1 n so doing
he breaks through the imperson
ality of other albums, and makes
the jump from mere profoundly
to real compassion.
The most important step that
Jackson Browne has taken on
Hold Out is not so much one of
philosophy but one of emotional
clarity. His previous albums have
left him fairly aloof; safe. He has
always been the conveyor of a
serious message — the prophet
of apocalypse — but he's never
stepped out of the safety and dis
tance of vinyl before. On Hold
Out Browne has finally lept from
the role of narrator right into the
scene.
In so doing he has put his own
security on the line, risking his
naked feelings being ridiculed.
Hold ,Out\ lyrics are far more
uncluttered than any other
Jackson Browne album. By
stripping the personal images of
decadent California off the
bones of each song, Browne
turns to universals. There is less
color on this album, and more
stark truth.
Some people may find this
album embarrassingly frank.
They may call it trite and melod
ramatic — condemnation caused
by discomfort. Because we are
uncomfortable, we laugh ... a
glimpse of bare and painful feel
ings make most people squirm.
They'd rather not know, and for
this reason, most artists avoid
real emotion on record. Those
that can merge conviction with
truth are few and far between.
Early Dylan, Bruce Springsteen,
Graham Parker and Elvis Cos
tello are a few who have man
aged, and these artists do tend to
make us uncomfortable and un

sure as we see ouselves mirrored
in their images. Now Jackson
Browne has joined the ranks of
those whose pain and joy are
blatantly transposed to vinyl.
Browne's transcendence seems
to have been heavily influenced
by Springsteen's last album,
Durkness On The Edge of Town.
Hold Out"% opening song, "Disco
Apocalypse," tells, as did
Springsteen's "Darkness on the
Edge of Town," of men and
women who have lost everything
and who need something, even if
it's as revolting as disco, to be
lieve in. "People watch the time
go by/ they do their jobs and live
and die/ and in their dreams they
rise above/ by strength or hate or
luck or love." "Disco
Apocalypse" brings Browne to
the realization that people — all
people — are just looking for
that single something more.
In "Boulevard," he restates
the tragedy: "nobody rides for
free/ nobody gets it like they
want it to be/ nobody hands you a
guarantee/ nobody."
Many people would call Hold
Out a depressing album, but I
find it an exhilerating one. It
speaks not of despair, but of
courage, of the struggle to sur
vive. It's major message is to
hold out. To hold out and hold
on. Browne not only discovers a
deep love of humanity on this
album, but he also offers a solu

tion to despair. Believe in your
self, he says. Don't compromise.
In "Boulevard" he speaks of
despair: "Down on the
Boulevard they take it hard/ they
look at life with such disregard/
they say it can't he won/ the way
the game is run/ but if you choose
to stay, you end up playing any
way." Then, at the end of the
album, he offers those hard faces
redemption. "For the countless
souls beaten by their goals/ keep
a hold on now/ and the ones bet
rayed by the deals they've made/
keep a hold on/ if you hold your
ground it'll turn around/ keep a
hold somehow."
On Hold Out, the desert and
the sky have disappeared.
California and I,A have disap
peared. Instead the sky is
smoggy and dark and the land
scape is cement, flashing lights
and missing persons. But Hold
Out is Jackson Browne's most
optimistic album to date — the
only one in which he finishes by
expressing hope. This album
does not deliver a prophecy of
apocalypse, or a deluge — it ad
vocates self-preservation. This is
an album about love. And love of
humanity. Though the music
does sound similar to what
Browne has done before Hold
Out does bring redemption of a
sort. Jackson Browne has held
out, and will continue holding
out for a more perfect world.

scenarios usuallv describe a race

of people in need of salvation.
Hold Out follows this tradition.
Up until now, however,
Browne's conclusion has been
that "nothing survives/ but the
way we live our lives." On Hold
Out, Browne takes this conclu
sion one step further and
explores its meaning. 1 n so doing
he breaks through the imperson
ality of other albums, and makes
the jump from mere profoundly
to real compassion.
The most important step that
Jackson Browne has taken on
Hold Out is not so much one of
philosophy but one of emotional
clarity. His previous albums have
left him fairly aloof; safe. He has
always been the conveyor of a
serious message — the prophet
of apocalypse — but he's never
stepped out of the safety and dis
tance of vinyl before. On Hold
Out Browne has finally lept from
the role of narrator right into the
scene.
In so doing he has put his own
security on the line, risking his
naked feelings being ridiculed.
Hold ,Out\ lyrics are far more
uncluttered than any other
Jackson Browne album. By
stripping the personal images of
decadent California off the
bones of each song, Browne
turns to universals. There is less
color on this album, and more
stark truth.
Some people may find this
album embarrassingly frank.
They may call it trite and melod
ramatic — condemnation caused
by discomfort. Because we are
uncomfortable, we laugh ... a
glimpse of bare and painful feel
ings make most people squirm.
They'd rather not know, and for
this reason, most artists avoid
real emotion on record. Those
that can merge conviction with
truth are few and far between.
Early Dylan, Bruce Springsteen,
Graham Parker and Elvis Cos
tello are a few who have man
aged, and these artists do tend to
make us uncomfortable and un

sure as we see ouselves mirrored
in their images. Now Jackson
Browne has joined the ranks of
those whose pain and joy are
blatantly transposed to vinyl.
Browne's transcendence seems
to have been heavily influenced
by Springsteen's last album,
Durkness On The Edge of Town.
Hold Out"% opening song, "Disco
Apocalypse," tells, as did
Springsteen's "Darkness on the
Edge of Town," of men and
women who have lost everything
and who need something, even if
it's as revolting as disco, to be
lieve in. "People watch the time
go by/ they do their jobs and live
and die/ and in their dreams they
rise above/ by strength or hate or
luck or love." "Disco
Apocalypse" brings Browne to
the realization that people — all
people — are just looking for
that single something more.
In "Boulevard," he restates
the tragedy: "nobody rides for
free/ nobody gets it like they
want it to be/ nobody hands you a
guarantee/ nobody."
Many people would call Hold
Out a depressing album, but I
find it an exhilerating one. It
speaks not of despair, but of
courage, of the struggle to sur
vive. It's major message is to
hold out. To hold out and hold
on. Browne not only discovers a
deep love of humanity on this
album, but he also offers a solu

tion to despair. Believe in your
self, he says. Don't compromise.
In "Boulevard" he speaks of
despair: "Down on the
Boulevard they take it hard/ they
look at life with such disregard/
they say it can't he won/ the way
the game is run/ but if you choose
to stay, you end up playing any
way." Then, at the end of the
album, he offers those hard faces
redemption. "For the countless
souls beaten by their goals/ keep
a hold on now/ and the ones bet
rayed by the deals they've made/
keep a hold on/ if you hold your
ground it'll turn around/ keep a
hold somehow."
On Hold Out, the desert and
the sky have disappeared.
California and I,A have disap
peared. Instead the sky is
smoggy and dark and the land
scape is cement, flashing lights
and missing persons. But Hold
Out is Jackson Browne's most
optimistic album to date — the
only one in which he finishes by
expressing hope. This album
does not deliver a prophecy of
apocalypse, or a deluge — it ad
vocates self-preservation. This is
an album about love. And love of
humanity. Though the music
does sound similar to what
Browne has done before Hold
Out does bring redemption of a
sort. Jackson Browne has held
out, and will continue holding
out for a more perfect world.

Musically, Jackson Browne's
new album Hold Out sounds
much the same as his previous
albums, but this is not to say that
Hold Out is especially similar to
anything Browne has done be
fore.
The forerunners to Hold Out,
notably Late for the Sky and The
Pretender, have laid bare the
structure of a society bent on an
nihilation. Browne's songs have
always been full of lost suburbia
and images of a blank California
desert landscape, and his
scenarios usuallv describe a race

of people in need of salvation.
