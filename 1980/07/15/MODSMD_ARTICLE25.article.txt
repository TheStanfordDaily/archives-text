## Richman's show funny, entertaining 
### 
Originality. Unpredictability. Sense of humor.
These three elements, mainly, account for what is pleasing about
Jonathan Richman. Fortunately, he possesses enough of each to
make him a-very enjoyable performer.
Take Saturday's Special Events-sponsored show at the Tresidder
Lounge. There Richman pulled off one ol the most challenging feats
in rock'n'roll, let alone in all of show business — the solo perfor
mance.
Without the benefit of a back up band, Richman took the stage
wearing his usual blue sweatshirt, blue jeans, and cream colored
cowboy boots. His hair looked tossled, like he'd just walked in off a
windy street. I le smiled vaguely at the audience of about 200. He was
undoubtedly "on something," but he was also plainly, ready to be
thoroughly entertaining.
And that's exactly what he was; for the seasoned Richman fans in
their early 30's, and for the several rapt children (admitted free of
charge) and tor the rest of us who were somewhere in between.
Alternating between two electric guitars and singing a capella,
Richman immediately brought the audience into his show by making
us laugh. His pouting,"Leave it to Beaver" facial expressions and his
self-mocking hip thrusts started the audience giggling, and that was
just where he wanted it.
Classic Richman songs left over from his days with the Modern
Lovers like "Ice Cream Man," "Honeybee," and "Stop This Car, I'm
Getting Out" serve as perfect examples of the Maine native's bizarre
sense of humor. Their tunes are difficult to distinguish at times, for
Richman really doesn't rely too heavily on his guitar, but the sheer
novelty of their lyrics is enough to keep the audience enraptured.
At times, it's true, some of Richman's songs dangle perilously close
to trite. I'm thinking especially of his dramatic rendition of "Affec
tion." At Tresidder this particular song was more like something one
might expect to see on "Mister Rogers Neighborhood" than at a
rock'n'roll show.
But a rock'n'roll show it was. Rock'n'roll pleasingly free of flashy
stage antics and tough guy lyrics. It was original, unpredictable, and
frequently funny rock'n'roll. And that's most important, because
that, as you may remember, is what sets Jonathan Richman apart
from everybody else.
