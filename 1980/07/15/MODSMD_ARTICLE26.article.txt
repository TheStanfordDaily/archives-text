## 'Hangar 18': trashy hokum 
### 
There are few absolutes in the
universe of cinema, but I can
think of one: Any movie with
many television actors is going to
be bad. Hangar 18 is full of TV
retreads, and a better title for the
film might be The Man From
U.N.C.L.E. Visits F Troop. But
as bad as Hangar 18 is, and it is
bad, it isn't bad enough to be fun,
though it comes close.
The first bad thing about Han
gar 18 is the TV advertising for
it. "Has the government kept
secret information about an alien
spacecraft which crashed in the
Arizona desert?" ask the ads, en
ticing the conspiracy theorist in
all of us.
Don't let the ads fool you. This
movie is no expose; it's a fairy
tale. The first scene of the film
involves a mission of a U.S. space
shuttle. I don't think we have one
of those. The Chronicle isn't very
thorough, but if we did 1 would
have read about it by now.
The plot of Hangar 18 isn't
much to speak of. A satellite
launched by the space shuttle
collides with a nearby alien ship,
which is forced to land in
Arizona ( talk about emergen
cies). The Air Force seizes the
ship and moves it to Hangar IK,
an isolated research facility. The
two astronauts from the shuttle
try to find out what is going on
while a presidential advisor tries
to stop them in order to protect
the president's reelection. I
won't even try to explain.
Meanwhile, NASA scientists are
studying the alien ship. Their
discoveries are absurd.
Absent the tedious cat and
mouse game played by the as
tronauts (and most of the film is
wasted on this). Hangar 18 could
have been a fun movie, a 1980
model of the spaceman movies of
the 50's. Not the good ones like
The Day the Earth Stood Still,
but Grade B hokum like// Came
From Outer Space or Attack of
the Crab Monsters.
The special effects are cheap,
which they should be. No Star
Wars spaceship with great detail,
the alien craft in Hangar 18 looks
like an old Wcstinghouse cabinet
radio. The interior is tacky disco
â€” aluminum foil wallpaper, etc.
And lots of colored lights; all
aliens love colored lights.
The NASA scientists make
their discoveries with approp
riate wide-eyed incredulity.
They talk in wondrously mean
ingless scientific jargon. At one
point a scientist oozing with dis
belief says to Darrin McGavin,
the leader and most bug-eyed of
the scientists, "The propulsion

system ... I think . . . it's... fu
sion powered!" What was he ex
pecting, a Wunkel rotary engine?
I really enjoyed that scene.
The acting in the movie is ter
rible, which is line. The two as
tronauts are played by Gary Col
lins, whose face you've seen on
TV a million times too many ,and
James Hampton, who reached
the pinnacle of his career playing
the bugler Dobbs on F Troop. A
pudgy astronaut? Only in the

movies.
Robert Vaughn plays the prcs
idential advisor. He has not
acted or dressed so poorly since
he starred in Teenage Caveman.
His dastardly agents, however,
do dress well. Nowdays you can
always tell CIA agents a mile
away because they drive Chev
rolets into fiery crashes and wear
dark suits while walking across
the Arizona desert.
All in all. 1 preferred Attack of
the Crab Monsters.
