## Devo tones it down a little 
### 
The reaction is inevitable:
"You like Devo?"
Aficionados of the five spud
boys from Akron are constantly
being labeled as musical mon
goloids and then, along with fans
of groups like Kiss and The
Monkees, being hustled off to
homes for the Culturally Stunted
where they can be safely left to
commit whatever sonic atrocities
they choose.
The problem seems to be that
Devo-haters, and some fans,
take Devo over-seriously, seeing
its oeuvre as some sort of a
human bio treatise with Muzak.
And certainly it can be annoying
to listen to a 14-year old's lecture
on the neo-Darwinism inherent
in "Smart Patrol Mr. DNA."
But to believe to de-evolution
as a profound theory is to miss
the fact that Devo is one of the
cleverest and most creative
bands to come forth in the past
few years which, considering the
quality of so many of the late '70s
groups, is quite a compliment,
even coming from a snotty stu
dent record review. How many
bands would do a cover version
of "Secret Agent Man"? And
even Elvis Costello has never
been able to sum up a relation
ship with words as pungent as
these from "Gut Feeling";
"Something about the way you
taste/ Makes me want to clear my
throat."
But enough of broad generali
zations. Devo's got a "new
album — it's been out for a
month and a half but please per
mit me to indulge in the great
Rolling Stone tradition of stale
record reviews. The album's cal
led Freedom of Choice and is
somewhat of a change for the

group — a '"Transition Record"
in review parlance. The album
has been stripped of a lot of De
vo's traditional trappings pre
sumably to make it more palata
ble to those who usually find
Devo obnoxious. But unlike the
Clash's London Calling which x
sacrificed none of that band's
quality, Devo's mainstreaming
has meant a watering down of
the band's audible talent. Even
the cover art. a fairly straight pic
ture of the boys, is a step down
from the "Actual Size" cover of
their first album. And the inner
sleeve — a catalogue — is an
over-indulgence of the band's
cynicism and also reeks of "let's
just get it out."
The music has been toned
down, both lyrically and aurally
from Devo's two previous al
bums. The songs are tighter,
shorter and simpler, the synth
esizers are less rambunctious and
the singing is surprisingly
straight ahead. While flirting
with avant-gardism in the past.
Devo has never been afraid of a
good old-fashioned hook, and
Freedom of Choice is chock full
of catchy, almost hummable
tunes, some sounding vaguely
Knack-like, perhapsthe ultimate
perjorative to many true believ
ers.
But to make a comparison to
the "Beatles of the' Bos" is not to
say that Freedom of Choice is a
bad album. While there are a
couple of clinkers — especially
"Don't You Know," a vapid
sounding song that rips off a
"rocket in my pocket" line from,
of all sources for lyric theft, Little
Feat — writers Bob
Mothersbaugh and Gerald Cas
lin have created, in the main.

songs that are satisfying in a clas
sic rock and roll way, if not from
an "on the fringe" perspective.
Most notable are: "Girl U
Want," "Gates of Steel," "Mr.
3's Ballroom," and "Whipit,"
the albumV'hit." While it seems
doubtful that Freedom of Choice
will appeal to the vast plowed
field of spuds, neither should it
embarass the already commit
ted.
Ot course you can't keep a
concept band going forever and a
Devo album in the same style as
its predecessors would have run
the risk of tritedom. But while
dishing up a decent album it
seems as if the boys themselves
are on the verge of taking de
evolution too seriously.
