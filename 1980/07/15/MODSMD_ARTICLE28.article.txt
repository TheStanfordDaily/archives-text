## Bach Festival provides plenty of pleasant music 
### 
The 43rd annual Carmel Bach Festival
opened last Friday night with perfor
mances of two cantatas, "Christ in
Death's Grasp" and "Sleepers, Wake"
and the Brandenburg Concerti Nos. 2 and
3. The Bach of this Festival is sweet, neat,
and well-mannered.
The Festival began in 1935 as an
amateur enterprise, but since 1965 the
musical director and conductor has been
Sardor Salgo, who for most of the period
was also director of the Stanford Sym
phony and Stanford Opera Theater. Salgo
brought musical competence to the festi
val, but judging from the opening concert,
it is Bach tempered to this town of arty
shoppers, doll house cottages and gentle
weather. It is Bach for music loving
grandmothers with little that is sinewy,
intellectual or powerful.
Two Brandenburg Concerti, great,

familiar concert staples, received a re
spectful reading. The Concerto No. 2 in F
Major is scored for solo violin, oboe,
flute and trumpet accompanied by a
small string orchestra. Friday's perfor
mance featured a Baroque trumpet,
which is smaller, sharper and higher than
the modern instrument. The trumpeter
seemed uncomfortable with the instru
ment and the shrill tone unbalanced the
thematic exchanges between the solo
players.
Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 in G
Major is scored for nine strings. Salgo
inserted an innovative harpsicord solo be
tween the two allegro movements, ex
panding on Bach's own second move
ment, which consists of only two chords.
Salgo's addition is successful. The percus
sive harpsichord interlude set off and en
hanced the rich and rapid string playing of

the third movement.
The two cantatas were sung by a chorus
of 70 voices. "Christ lag in Todesbaden"
(Christ in Death's Grasp) is an Easter
work of somber beauty. The singing was
adequate but not inspired. The orchestra
was joined by a small organ that lacked
the depth and power needed as an under
pinning for this work. The tone was thin,
with no sonorous rumblings.
"Wachet auf," (Sleeper's wake) is a
magnificent lyrical cantata that closed the
program. The chorus overcame its earlier
shakiness and was joined by three sol
oists, among them Stanford's Choral Di
rector William Ramsey. The work has
some of Bach's most eloquent melodic
inventions, which Salgo presented with
taste and skill. The final chorale is a paean
that is simple but exquisite. It ends in a
falling away and a sigh. Salgo was so

pleased and moved he had the chorus sing
the section twice.
The Carmel Bach Festival continues
until July 27 with performances of Bach's
" Wedding Cantata," B Minor Mass, and
the cantata "How beautifully shines the
morning star." There will also be perfor
mances of choral and instrumental music
by Vivaldi, Mozart, Hayden, Beethoven
and composers of the French Baroque, as
well as Mozart's opera "The Marriage of
Figaro."
However lacking the Festival may be in
musical muscle, its selections are among
the world's finest compositions,and its set
ting in Carmcl's Sunset Center Theater is
charming and picturesque. For a faultless
and powerful performance, go elsewhere,
but for pleasant music in an unequaled
location, there is little that can equal the
Bach Festival in Carmel-by-the-Sea.
