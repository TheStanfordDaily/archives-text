## Queen: cluttered, contrived 
### 
The scene inside the Oakland
Coliseum Sunday night was
hardly one of austerity. When
Queen, the superstar British
rock hand, came on stage, the
audience was treated to an
elaborate display of flashing and
gyrating lights, smoke and fan
fare which continued throughout
the hour and 45 minute-long
show. The effects that sur
rounded Queen's entire perfor
mance exemplified the type of
show Queen's audiences expect,
as well as the type of record
Queen puts out — lavish, clut
tered and contrived. However,
the things that Queen does well,
such as perform heavy metal
music, they do well — certainly
better than most current heavy
metal bands.
Since the majority of heavy
metal bands have nothing to re
commend themselves except
their excessive, obnoxious and
boring whaling away at their in
struments, heavy metal has de
servedly gained a bad name.
Queen, however, does heavy
metal the way it should be done
(if it has to be done at all), and
despite their flaws, they sound
quite good in concert.
Queen is ashamed to associate
themselves with heavy metal, so
they clutter their albums and
shows up with special effects,
hoping to sound like progressive
art-rock. But they end up sound
ing pretentious. In concert, one
realizes that they are indeed
heavy metal, and nothing
else .
A lot of people write Queen
off as teeny-bopper music, but in
fact, to a certain extent they have
been innovative in a fairly li
mited field. Queen is damned by
the reputation of their audience,
which seems to have an average
age of 13 and an average IQ of
the same. This audience is, in
short, easy to fool, and even
easier to please.
The main problem with Sun
day's concert was tht Queen
lacks subtlety. Opening with
"Jailhouse Rock." they pro
ceeded to wham all hell out of
the song till it seemed like a de
flated and noisy nothing, instead
of the classic song that it is.
Queen has an impressive sound
system, and the amount of notes
they squeeze out of what is es
sentially a 3-piece band (Brian
May on lead guitar, John Deacon
on bass, and Roger Taylor on
drums, with Freddie Mercury
dashing in and out on the piano)
is utterly amazing. Contrast,
however, is not their middle
name.
After stomping "Jailhouse
Rock" to death, Queen did 23
more of their own songs. A good
sized show it was, and well done
if you like theatrics. Mercury's
constant dramatics became a bit

tedious after a while, only to be
replaced eventually by the other
band members' alotted solos,
which were equally monotonous.
Soaring 3-piece harmony, a
whole lot of echo and power
chords, and the inescapable dry
ice smoke were the name of the
day. Didn't dry ice smoke go out
with Deep Purple? One guesses
not.
Queen has the effrontery to
perform every song in exactly the
same manner. They have abso
lutely no range, especially Fred
die Mercury and Brian May. on
whom most of the musical bur
den falls. Mercury's posing and
shouting sounds more like musi
cal comedy. One can easily pic
ture him singing "Oh, What a
Beautiful Morning" from "Ok
lahoma." May must be the most
boring lead guitarist in the his
tory of rock. All he knows how to
do is rehash his own riffs, over

and over again, drowning him
self out in re-verb. The rhythm
section of Taylor and Deacon is
quite good if unsubtle, except for
Taylor's disgusting and predict
able drum solo, replete with
gong. Must every heavy metal
band include one?
Queen in concert proves that
heavy metal, when done cor
rectly, isn't such a bad thing as it
once seemed. But their perfor
mance was the epitome of rote
superstardom. They seemed
aloof from the audience; their
comments were so inane, and
their actions toward their fans
were so inconsiderate, that it was
no wonder only an audience of
13 and 14 year olds would think
Queen were neat. Even Queen's
expensive and elaborate light set
couldn't hide the fact that Queen
is up there going through the mo
tions — and very old, tired mo
tions at that.


Queen — Posing for a publicity picture. Are they really anything
more than a teeny-bopper band?

hardly one of austerity. When
Queen, the superstar British
rock hand, came on stage, the
audience was treated to an
elaborate display of flashing and
gyrating lights, smoke and fan
fare which continued throughout
the hour and 45 minute-long
show. The effects that sur
rounded Queen's entire perfor
mance exemplified the type of
show Queen's audiences expect,
as well as the type of record
Queen puts out — lavish, clut
tered and contrived. However,
the things that Queen does well,
such as perform heavy metal
music, they do well — certainly
better than most current heavy
metal bands.
Since the majority of heavy
metal bands have nothing to re
commend themselves except
their excessive, obnoxious and
boring whaling away at their in
struments, heavy metal has de
servedly gained a bad name.
Queen, however, does heavy
metal the way it should be done
(if it has to be done at all), and
despite their flaws, they sound
quite good in concert.
Queen is ashamed to associate
themselves with heavy metal, so
they clutter their albums and
shows up with special effects,
hoping to sound like progressive
art-rock. But they end up sound
ing pretentious. In concert, one
realizes that they are indeed
heavy metal, and nothing
else .
A lot of people write Queen
off as teeny-bopper music, but in
fact, to a certain extent they have
been innovative in a fairly li
mited field. Queen is damned by
the reputation of their audience,
which seems to have an average
age of 13 and an average IQ of
the same. This audience is, in
short, easy to fool, and even
easier to please.
The main problem with Sun
day's concert was tht Queen
lacks subtlety. Opening with
"Jailhouse Rock." they pro
ceeded to wham all hell out of
the song till it seemed like a de
flated and noisy nothing, instead
of the classic song that it is.
Queen has an impressive sound
system, and the amount of notes
they squeeze out of what is es
sentially a 3-piece band (Brian
May on lead guitar, John Deacon
on bass, and Roger Taylor on
drums, with Freddie Mercury
dashing in and out on the piano)
is utterly amazing. Contrast,
however, is not their middle
name.
After stomping "Jailhouse
Rock" to death, Queen did 23
more of their own songs. A good
sized show it was, and well done
if you like theatrics. Mercury's
constant dramatics became a bit

tedious after a while, only to be
replaced eventually by the other
band members' alotted solos,
which were equally monotonous.
Soaring 3-piece harmony, a
whole lot of echo and power
chords, and the inescapable dry
ice smoke were the name of the
day. Didn't dry ice smoke go out
with Deep Purple? One guesses
not.
Queen has the effrontery to
perform every song in exactly the
same manner. They have abso
lutely no range, especially Fred
die Mercury and Brian May. on
whom most of the musical bur
den falls. Mercury's posing and
shouting sounds more like musi
cal comedy. One can easily pic
ture him singing "Oh, What a
Beautiful Morning" from "Ok
lahoma." May must be the most
boring lead guitarist in the his
tory of rock. All he knows how to
do is rehash his own riffs, over

and over again, drowning him
self out in re-verb. The rhythm
section of Taylor and Deacon is
quite good if unsubtle, except for
Taylor's disgusting and predict
able drum solo, replete with
gong. Must every heavy metal
band include one?
Queen in concert proves that
heavy metal, when done cor
rectly, isn't such a bad thing as it
once seemed. But their perfor
mance was the epitome of rote
superstardom. They seemed
aloof from the audience; their
comments were so inane, and
their actions toward their fans
were so inconsiderate, that it was
no wonder only an audience of
13 and 14 year olds would think
Queen were neat. Even Queen's
expensive and elaborate light set
couldn't hide the fact that Queen
is up there going through the mo
tions — and very old, tired mo
tions at that.


Queen — Posing for a publicity picture. Are they really anything
more than a teeny-bopper band?
