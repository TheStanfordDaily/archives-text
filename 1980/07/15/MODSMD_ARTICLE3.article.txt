# Med Center renovation okayed
## 
### Susie Oglesby Staff Writer 
A $4 million renova
tion of the outpatient clinics at
Stanford Mcdical Center was
approved by the University
Board of Trustees June 13.
The project, funded primarily
by the James Boswell Founda
tion, includes the first significant
improvements in the clinic
facilities since their construction
in 1959.
The Boswell Foundation, lo
cated in Los Angeles, supports
hospitals and other health care
facilities in California and
Arizona. The foundation pro
vided the original funding for the
Boswell building, the wing of the
Medical Center complex in
which the clinics are housed.
The $3 million gift from the
Boswell Foundation was do
nated specifically for the upgrad
ing of the outpatient clinics. It
will supplement a proposed $97
million program to modernize

the hospital over the next six
years.
In the outpatient clinics almost
200 faculty physicians treat their
patients and teach medical stu
dents. The clinics keep quite
busy with approximately
136,000 patient visits per year.
David Mendelow, Associate
Dean of the Medical School and
administrator of the clinics, said
the facilities are no longer con
ducive for the modern care of
outpatients.
A recent planning report
stated, "They have inadequate
waiting areas, undersized exa
mining rooms and major imped
iments to the attraction of pa
tients and the integration of pa
tient care and teaching ac
tivities."
The major aim of the new con
struction will be to correct these
deficiencies hy taking into ac
count the needs of those using
the clinics.
The new area will be designed

to complement teaching needs as
well as patient needs. Mendelow
noted that "In a teaching setting,
you need more conference
areas." In addition, waiting
space will be increased; traffic
patterns re-structured to allow
for more patient privacy: exa
mining rooms will he larger; ven
tilation systems improved; and
special procedure rooms will be
consolidated.
The general atmosphere in the
clinics now is somewhat"depres
sing," said Elvia Garwood, man
ager of major projects at the
Med Center. The renovation will
offer an overall brightening and
refurbishing to improve the
clinic's appearance and comfort.
Mendelow continued, "The
completed facility will be more
helpful for teaching ... it will be
pleasant for patients, allow for
more privacy and permit greater
efficiency by grouping similar ac
tivities."
Both Mendelow and Garwood
emphasized that the plans are
the result of many cooperative
efforts. The renovation is de
signed to satisfy the needs of the
nurses, administrators, doctors.

students and patients who spend
time there each day.
"I'm very happy with the
plans," said Vera Waechter, RN
and Manager of the Clinic Pa
tients Services. She said the ap
proval of the project was the
culmination of a year-long pro
cess of discussions and inter
views with division chiefs, de
partment chairmen and others to
determine the needs of the
clinics.
The next step will be taken by
Alemeter and Finley of Palo
Alto, the architectural firm cho
sen to do the design. Once design
plans are submitted, the Board
of Trustees must grant final ap
proval to begin the renovation
which is slated for 1981.
During the actual renovation,
the clinics will remain open.
Mendelow predicts only a minor
degree of inconvenience. The ar
chitects, in conjunction with
clinic administrators, plan to un
dertake the construction in
stages they determine to be the
least disturbing. A completion
date has not been set, but reno
vation is anticipated to take one
to two years.

"I'm very happy with the
plans," said Vera Waechter, RN

views with division chiefs, de
partment chairmen and others to
determine the needs of the
clinics.
The next step will be taken by
Alemeter and Finley of Palo
