Firing squad shoots 26 in Iran
TEHRAN — Iranian executioners shot at least
26 persons late Sunday and yesterday, including
former arms chief of staff Lt. Gen. Houshang
Hatem, two leaders of the Bahai religious sect and
an anti-government student activist, the official
news media reported.
At least 19 of the Iranians executed —in Tabriz,
Tehran and Hamadan — were accused of drug
trafficking, prostitution, adultery or other vices
that have become capital offenses under Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's strict Moslem regime.
The open-air executions were further evidence
of the harsh turn that Iran's revolutionary justice
has taken in recent weeks.
The Moslem militants holding the U.S. Embassy
published a purported interview with one of their
American captives in which he admitted to being a
CIA officer and named two of his contacts — both
high-level Iranians.
If the published statements are accurate, it would
mark the first time that one of the hostages has
confessed to being an officer of the Central Intelli
gence Agency. The militants identified the hostage
as Thomas Ahem, a 48-year-old State Department
employee and native of Fond du Lac, Wis., whom
they have accused previously of espionage.
Billy registers as Libyan agent
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
brother. Billy, was forced to register as a foreign
agent for Libya yesterday and in doing so acknow
ledged accepting $22,000 from that country's radi
cal Arab government. •
The Department of Justice described the
$22,000 as "compensation" Carter received for
services he performed for the Libyans. The presi
dent's brother, who consented to register as an
agent in the face of a department civil suit, said the
funds were part payment of a half-million-dollar
loan he had sought from the Libyans.
The suit alleged that Carter would continue to
represent the Libyans illegally unless the court is
sued an injunction restraining him. Carter said,
however, that he is not now engaged in or consider
mg any activities for the Libyans.
White House officials conceded that the action
was likely to futher alienate Jewish voters from the
president. However, Ray Jenkins, a spokesman,
maintained that the suit was "a private matter bet
ween the Justice Department and a private indi
vidual who happens to be the president's brother."
Heat wave scorches Missouri
JEFFERSON CITY. Missouri — Missouri's
governor placed the National Guard on alert and
declared a state of emergency yesterday after the
number of heat-related deaths in the state skyroc

keted to 142, far more than in any of the 15 states
gripped hv an unrelenting heat wave.
Across the lower half of the nation, people —
especially the elderly and the poor — suffered from
the three-week-old heat wave, which is expected to
last for at least the remainder of the week.
The unofficial death toll — 330 at the end of last
week — had nearly doubled by yesterday.
Health authorities reported nearly 100 people
died from the heat over the weekend in two Mis
souri cities alone, St. Louis and Kansas City, as the
temperature reached 108 degrees.
"This is one of the worst health crises or public
safety crises 1 have viewed as governor," said Gov.
Joseph Teasdale in Kansas City.
Teasdale, at work at 1 a.m.. signed an executive
order declaring a state of emergency and placing
guard units in the state's four largest cities on alert
to provide emergency transportation.
Senate in impasse over budget
SACRAMENTO — The state's record-setting
budget deadlock is making the legislature look
like a "madhouse with the inmates in charge," the
Senate's Democratic leader said yesterday.
But Senate Republican leaders vowed to con
tinue to hold the $24.1 billion spending plan hos
tage until a bill dealing with program cost-of-living
adjustments becomes law.
" 1 have checked with enough of our members to
conclude that we are going to maintain the same
position," said Sen. Ken Maddy of Fresno, the
GOP caucus chairman.
The Senate has failed three times to approve the
budget bill, the last time early Saturday on a 25-15
vote, two short of the two-thirds majority needed
for passage.
The impasse has left the state in financial limbo
1 5 days into a new fiscal year — the longest time in
memory that California has gone without a budget
— and is forcing delays in some payments, includ
ing legislators' $46-per-day expense checks.
Dow breaks 900 in active trade
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials yester
day gained 14.33 to close at 905.45. That was the
first time since Feb. 13 and only the second time
this year that the index finished above 900.
Gainers outnumbered losers by a wide margin
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 45.50 million shares,
against 38.31 million in the previous session.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow except for patchy low
clouds this morning. Lows in the 50s. Warmer days
with highs in the upper 70s and 80s. Northwest
winds to 20 mph afternoons.

news media reported.
At least 19 of the Iranians executed —in Tabriz,
Tehran and Hamadan — were accused of drug
trafficking, prostitution, adultery or other vices
that have become capital offenses under Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's strict Moslem regime.
The open-air executions were further evidence
of the harsh turn that Iran's revolutionary justice
has taken in recent weeks.
The Moslem militants holding the U.S. Embassy
published a purported interview with one of their
American captives in which he admitted to being a
CIA officer and named two of his contacts — both
high-level Iranians.
If the published statements are accurate, it would
mark the first time that one of the hostages has
confessed to being an officer of the Central Intelli
gence Agency. The militants identified the hostage
as Thomas Ahem, a 48-year-old State Department
employee and native of Fond du Lac, Wis., whom
they have accused previously of espionage.
Billy registers as Libyan agent
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
brother. Billy, was forced to register as a foreign
agent for Libya yesterday and in doing so acknow
ledged accepting $22,000 from that country's radi
cal Arab government. •
The Department of Justice described the
$22,000 as "compensation" Carter received for
services he performed for the Libyans. The presi
dent's brother, who consented to register as an
agent in the face of a department civil suit, said the
funds were part payment of a half-million-dollar
loan he had sought from the Libyans.
The suit alleged that Carter would continue to
represent the Libyans illegally unless the court is
sued an injunction restraining him. Carter said,
however, that he is not now engaged in or consider
mg any activities for the Libyans.
White House officials conceded that the action
was likely to futher alienate Jewish voters from the
president. However, Ray Jenkins, a spokesman,
maintained that the suit was "a private matter bet
ween the Justice Department and a private indi
vidual who happens to be the president's brother."
Heat wave scorches Missouri
JEFFERSON CITY. Missouri — Missouri's
governor placed the National Guard on alert and
declared a state of emergency yesterday after the
number of heat-related deaths in the state skyroc

keted to 142, far more than in any of the 15 states
gripped hv an unrelenting heat wave.
Across the lower half of the nation, people —
especially the elderly and the poor — suffered from
the three-week-old heat wave, which is expected to
last for at least the remainder of the week.
The unofficial death toll — 330 at the end of last
week — had nearly doubled by yesterday.
Health authorities reported nearly 100 people
died from the heat over the weekend in two Mis
souri cities alone, St. Louis and Kansas City, as the
temperature reached 108 degrees.
"This is one of the worst health crises or public
safety crises 1 have viewed as governor," said Gov.
Joseph Teasdale in Kansas City.
Teasdale, at work at 1 a.m.. signed an executive
order declaring a state of emergency and placing
guard units in the state's four largest cities on alert
to provide emergency transportation.
Senate in impasse over budget
SACRAMENTO — The state's record-setting
budget deadlock is making the legislature look
like a "madhouse with the inmates in charge," the
Senate's Democratic leader said yesterday.
But Senate Republican leaders vowed to con
tinue to hold the $24.1 billion spending plan hos
tage until a bill dealing with program cost-of-living
adjustments becomes law.
" 1 have checked with enough of our members to
conclude that we are going to maintain the same
position," said Sen. Ken Maddy of Fresno, the
GOP caucus chairman.
The Senate has failed three times to approve the
budget bill, the last time early Saturday on a 25-15
vote, two short of the two-thirds majority needed
for passage.
The impasse has left the state in financial limbo
1 5 days into a new fiscal year — the longest time in
memory that California has gone without a budget
— and is forcing delays in some payments, includ
ing legislators' $46-per-day expense checks.
Dow breaks 900 in active trade
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials yester
day gained 14.33 to close at 905.45. That was the

this year that the index finished above 900.
Gainers outnumbered losers by a wide margin
on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 45.50 million shares,
against 38.31 million in the previous session.
