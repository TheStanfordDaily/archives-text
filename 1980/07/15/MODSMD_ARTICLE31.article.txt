Vandalism
Resulting from a continuing
vandalism spree, the windows of
two cars parked on Santa
Theresa Street last night were
broken. Small, easy-to-grab arti
cles were also reported missing
from the vehicles. According to
police, several similar incidents
have occurred over the past six
weeks. The damage is all thought
to have been wrought by the
same person. People are advised
to use caution when parking on
Santa Theresa near the Storke
Publications Bldg., at night and
to remove all valuables from
their cars.
