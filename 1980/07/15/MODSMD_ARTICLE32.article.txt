### Liz Rosner Staff Writer 
This summer's Distinguished
Faculty Forum series begins to
night with a lecture by Norman
Wessells, Professor of Biological
Sciences.
Entitled "Nerves, Lungs and
L imbs: Building an Embryo,"
Professor Wessells' lecture will
be the first of three lectures pre
sented through Memorial
Church in order to give the
community here the opportunity
to hear and question leading fa
culty members.
Wessells" lecture will include
the presentation of a short film
taken in the course of his re
search. Focusing on the natural
history of an embryonic nerve
cell, he will be discussing exper
iments he has conducted on
nerve cells in lungs and limbs of
the embryo, looking at how a
nerve cell grows and moves in its
environment.
The Distinguished Faculty

Forum is designed to bring lead
ing researchers closer to people
here who would not otherwise
have access to their lectures or
articles.
This type of faculty appear
ance is particularly appropriate
for students and visitors who are
here only during the summer and
are interested in research at
Stanford.
For the professors, the forum
is an opportunity for a wider im
mediate audience, as opposed to
the worldwide academic audi
ence reached through books and
journals.
Chosen by Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly of the Chapel,
the upcoming speakers for the
summer include: Prof. Kenneth
Arrow, economics; and Prof.
Henry Breitrose, communica
tion. Each lecture will be fol
lowed bv a question and answer
period, and all three will take
place in the Round Room of
Memorial Church.
