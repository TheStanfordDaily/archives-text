# Daily case in House
## 
### Ed Asiano Staff Writer 
Bills designed to counter the
effects of the 1 978 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that police need
only warrants to search news
paper offices, even it the jour
nalists are not suspected of a
crime, are being pushed through
Congress, hut not without diffi
culty.
The case, /.urcher v. The Stan
ford Daily, was carefully ob
served at the time by broadcast
ing and print media. When the
decision was announced, the
Carter Administration proposed
legislation to counter its effects.

News analysis

Now, the Carter Administra
tion. in an alliance with conserv
tive Senator Strom Thurmond
(R-S.C.), is blamed for diluting
the legislation presently making
its way through Congress.
Representative Robert
Kastenmeier (D-Wis.), chair
man of the House Judiciary
Committee's Subcommittee on
Courts, Civil l.iberties, and the
Administration of Justice, led a
bill (H.R. 3456), through his
subcommittee and the full com
mittee. It protects journalists
and private citizens, so-called
nonsuspect third parties, from
police searches authorized only
by warrants.
In the Senate, Birch Mayh (D-
Ind ), chairman of the Judiciary
Committee's Constitution sub
committee, moved a similar bill
(S. 1790) through his subcom
mittee. Hut when it was brought
before a full committee vote,
Bayh ran into trouble. Carter's
Justice Department, with strong
support from the powerful
Thurmond, opposed the section
dealing with third parties. Aimed
primarily to protect the docu
ments of doctors and lawyers,
the Justice Department seemed
to prefer no hill to one including
the provision.
The Senate compromise, ap
proved unanimously, deleted the
third party provision. Replacing
it was one directing the attorney
general to issue guidelines for of
ficials to follow when obtaining
warrants to seize from a person
"not reasonably believed to be a
suspect."
Both bills, if passed, would
necessitate federal, state and

local authorities to obtain sub
poenas before conducting
searches. Subpoenas cannot be
issued without advance warning,
permitting the request for one to
be opposed in court.
The pressure from Thurmond
and the support he gathered ruf
fled Bayh. He callcd the White
House expressing concern over
Justice's attitude. That led to a
series of meetings in the Execu
tive Office Building. In one
meeting several backers of the
bill, including the Trial Lawyers
Association, the Radio-
Television News Directors As
sociation, and the American
Civil Liberties Union, an
nounced to the Justice Depart
ment the compromise was ac
ceptable. They also agreed to
urge the House, whose bill re

mained intact, to accept the wa
tered down Senate version.
Kastenmeier, however, is not
ready to give in. He held out
against Justice Department pres
sure and recently refused to con
form his bill to the Senate's. Al
though not adamant about a
change, he feels the Fourth
Amendment, protecting against
unreasonable search and sei
zures, covers everyone.
A Kastenmeier aide says,"the
Carter Administration has gone
along with Thurmond and the
Republicans, and we're left hold
ing the bag."
Meanwhile police, freed by
the Daily decision, conducted a
surprise search of the offices of
the Flint Voice, an alternative
paper printed in Flint, Michigan.
