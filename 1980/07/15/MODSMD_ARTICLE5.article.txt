## UN 						Women's Conference begins 
### Ole Duus Associated Press Writer 
COPENHAGEN. Denmark
— Five years after the start of the
United Nations' Decade for
Women. 1500 delegates from
140 countries here for a confer
ence heard yesterday that the
campaign to ease women's bur
dens had far to go.
Formally opening the 18-day
conference "devoted to one of
the great human objectives of
our time." U.N. Secretary-
General Kurt Waldheim warned
against overlooking the progress
that has been made in the past
five years, but said social and
economic realities give little
cause for complacency.
Lucille Nair, Jamaican

secretary-general of the confer
ence. said: "We have learned
valuable lessons. The attitudinal
prejudices which stand in the
way of women's advancement
are held by women as well as
men. and both are responsible
for the lack of political will in
many countries to change the
status of women."
The potential of education for
improving the condition of
women has not been realized,
she said. Despite decreased mat
ernal and child mortality there is
widespread, chronic ill-health
among women, and women still
move — when they move at all —
into the lowest-paid, most sex
stereotyped and most insecure
jobs, she said.
The Israeli delegation to the

conference, headed by Hava
Hareli, Israel's ambassador to
Norway, was reportedly prepar
ing a rebuttal to an official con
ference document harshly
criticizing the treatment of Pales
tinian women in the area "oc
cupied since 1948" — or since
Israel's birth.
