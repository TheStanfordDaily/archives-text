# Soviet forces shell Afghan countryside
## 
### James Hatton Associated Press Writer 
NEW DELHI, India — In an
apparent change of tactics,
Soviet troops have attacked and
bombed 50 to 60 villages in the
Afghan countryside in the past
two weeks, causing "many
thousands" of civilian and rebel
casualties, a diplomatic source
said yesterday.
There also has been a marked
increase in Soviet air traffic into
the Afghan capital in the last
four days, with as many as a
dozen Russian transport planes
landing daily during daylight
hours in addition to the continu
ing nightly supply flights, the
source said.
About 10 days ago, the dip
lomat said, the Soviets reduced
their efforts to engage the anti-
Marxist Afghan rebels in the
countryside and instead sharply
increased their attacks on vil
lages suspected of harboring the
guerrijlas.
The informant, an Afghan
area specialist with close con
tacts in Kabul, said there repor
tedly were more than 1000
casualties in one large village and

38 in a smaller one. He said that
because-reports of the attacks
came "so frequently and so regu
larly" he estimated the toll in the
thousands.
The casualty estimate could
not be independently confirmed,
and the source did not speculate
as to how many Soviet troops
might have been killed or
wounded in the raids.
Soviet generals have ordered
retaliatory attacks on Afghan vil
lages in the past, and the rebels
responded by warning villagers
in advance to flee an area in
which they planned a raid against
the Russians.
One reason for the high casu
alty figures in the recent raids is
that the Soviets struck at greater
distances, and caught villages off
guard, the source said.
"I have heard that they (Soviet
troops) are attacking without
warning," the source said. "In
the past, the insurgents would
tell the people to get out in ad
vance of (rebel) attacks (against
Soviet positions). But the Soviets
have been expanding the radius
of their retaliatory attacks
beyond what had previously
been expected."
