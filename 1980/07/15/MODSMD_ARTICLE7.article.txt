# New Japanese head chosen

TOKYO — A Japanese politician who has
known Zenko Suzuki intimately over the years was
asked recently to describe Suzuki's general views
on foreign affairs.
The politician said he had no idea what those
views are. He said, somewhat vaguely, that he sup
posed that Suzuki would generally follow the
policies of the late Prime Minister Masayoshi Oh
ira. Beyond that, he just couldn't say.
It was not an unexpected answer. Zenko Suzuki
is scheduled to he annointed as the new prime
minister of Japan today, hut his views even after 35
years in national politics, are not widely known.
Suzuki himself is almost unknown outside the im
mediate circle of political intimates.
Suzuki is expected to be formally voted the
choice of Liberal Democratic Party members in
both houses of the parliament today. Since his
party holds substantial majorities in both cham
bers, he is certain to be named prime minister on
Thursday.
An amiable, hard-working man who has held an
important LDP position for years, the 69-year-old
Suzuki is regarded by colleagues as an excellent
political tactician. For nine terms he has served as a
chairman of the party's executive council, a posi
tion that requires patience and an ability to resolve
factional struggles. "A moderator," is how one

LDP member describes him.
Failing to have distinctive views is not unusual in
a prime minister candidate in Japan. For three
decades, they have been chosen from a fairly nar
row spectrum of conservative politicians.
Most, however, had been previously known as
prominent Cabinet ministers. Almost all had
served as minister of foreign affairs, international
trade and industry, or finance, and their views on at
least one important segment had become known.
Suzuki has held none of those three key posts,
although in the past 20 years he has been minister
of posts, health and welfare and agriculture. None
involved him in crucial, highly publicized affairs.
Suzuki's choice as prime minister stems from the
factional struggles within the LDP and the fact that
he had fewer enemies than any of the other men
considered. Two considerably more prominent
men were finally overlooked — Yasuhiro
Nakasone, because too many colleagues distrust
him, and Toshio Komoto, because he had refused
to defend the Ohira government in a crucial no
confidence vote last May.
As late as two weeks ago, no one talked of
Suzuki as a candidate, but as the others were re
jected his name kept popping up among a council
of elders charged with selecting someone the party
could more or less agree on. He had been chosen
earlier as the new leader of Ohira's large faction.
