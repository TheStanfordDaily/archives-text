## ERA supporters march in Detroit 
### 
From the Daily wire services
DETROIT A virtual
"Who's Who" of the moderate
wing of the Republican Party
yesterday led a march of 1 1,000
supporters of the Equal Rights
Amendment through downtown
Detroit, protesting the retreat on
the amendment in the GOP plat
form.
"My party has endorsed the
Equal Rights amendment for 40
years," Jill Ruckelshaus, a
longtime party activist and wife
of one of the best known figures
in the Nixon administration, de
clared in an impassioned speech
at the end of the march." Dwight
Eisenhower endorsed ERA.
Richard Nixon endorsed ERA.
Gerald Ford endorsed the ERA.
"But something happened in
Detroit last week," she bel
lowed. her voice cracking with
emotion. "Give me back my
party."
She was joined in the protest
by Senate Minority Whip Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska), Sen.
Charles Mathias (R-Md.), Sen.
Jacob Javits (R-N.Y.), Rep. Paul
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
Rep. Margaret Heckler (R-
Mass.), Helen Milliken, wife of
the Michigan governor. Rep. Bill
Green (R-N.Y.) and a host of
local and state party leaders.
The march, which passed by
the site of the Republican Na
tional Convention as a sidewalk

honky-tonk band played "I
Want a Girl Just Like the Girl
who Married Dear Old Dad,"
was organized by the National
Organization for Women. Most
protesters were feminist and
nonparty members.
But Republican moderates,
upset over the rightward drift of
the party, saw it as a vehicle to
"send a message" to Ronald
Reagan and the conservative
forces who control the conven
tion.
"1 think it's sending a message
to the country that there are
people in Detroit who support
the Equal Rights Amendment."
said Mathias."lt'sa more impor
tant issue than it was 40 years
ago because more women are in
the workforce and need protec
tion."
"I'm not sure Reagan's advis
ers understand the w hole issue or
the opportunity it offers them,"
said Doug Bailey, a respected
Republican political consultant
who joined in the march. "The
ERA is a litmus test issue. To a
lot of young people a party that
dismisses ERA is not going to get
a hearing.
"Millions of Americans aren't
particularly comfortable with
Reagan but they hate Jimmy
Carter. They're about ready to
vote tor Reagan if he just gives
them a signal. He's missing it on
ERA."
