# Bush buries his dissent
## Reagan calls for a new consensus of values 
### 
From The Washington Post
DETROIT — Ronald
Reagan, the one-time New
Dealer who became a latter-day
apostle of conservatism, ac
cepted the presidential nomina
tion of his adopted Republican
Party last night with a speech
bidding Democrats and Inde
pendents to join in a "new con
sensus" of common values.
Addressing the final session of
the convention after it ratified
his midnight-choice of George
Bush as his running-mate,
Reagan delivered a message
aimed both at reassuring his own
conservative backers and attract
ing traditional Democrats disap
pointed with what he called '"the
mediocre leadership" of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter.
The 69-year-old former
California governor, employing
the oratorial talents that made
him a successful actor in his ear
lier career, vowed to "carry our
message to every American, re
gardless or party affiliation, who
is a member of this community of
shared values."
He invoked the words that
have become the cornerstones of
the conservative movement
Reagan has been promoting
since his mid-life conversion
after youthful activism as Hol
lywood union president and lib
jiral Democrat.
Belief in those values — "fam
ily, work, neighborhood, peace
and freedom" — he said would
make the long-time minority
Republicans a party united, with
positive programs for solving the
nation's problems.
Blaming the Carter administ
ration and the Democratic Con
gress for the "unprecedented

calamity. . . (of) a disintegrating
economy, a weakened defense
and an energy policy based on
the sharing of scarcity, Reagan
declared:
"I will not stand by and watch
this great country destroy itself
under mediocre leadership that
drifts from one crisis to the next,
our national will and
purpose."
Earfier, Keagan and his
lieutenants worked hard to as
sure his conservative followers
that the selection of Bush, the
most persistent and successful of
his challengers for the nomina
tion, was not a betrayal of the
cause for which they had la
bored.
At a morning news conference
with Reagan, the 58-year-old
former Texas congressman.
Ambassador and Central Intelli
gence Agency director did his
part by burying his previous dis
sent from key elements of
Reagan's economic, tax and so
cial policy.
Bush had called Reagan's
plans to curb government spend
ing unrealistic, his tax-cut prop
osals inflationary, his support of
an anti-abortion amendment
unwise and his opposition to the
Equal Rights Amendment
backward-thinking.
But yesterday he said he
would be "emphasizing the
common ground" and "en
thusiastically supporting this
Republican platform," which
endorses Reagan's views. "I'm
"not going to get nickel-and
dimed to death with details,"
Bush added.
Much of the questioning from
reporters went right past the
selection of Bush to the drama of

Reagan's ardent but unsuccess
ful courtship of former President
Gerald Ford for the running
mate post — a bid that Reagan
abandoned late Wednesday
night when he and Ford were
unable to agree on the gov
ernmental powers the former
president would exercise if the
unprecedented political partner
ship had succeeded.
But the fact that Ford em
braced the term "co-presidency"
on nationwide television, in this
most sensitive moment of the
negotiations, already had done
damage. It had, for example, re
portedly angered Reagan by
seeming to diminish his image of
being able to handle the job
single-handedly.
And it surprised those who
thought they knew him best.
"The whole concept of a co
presidency shows a lack of
sophistication about the office,"
one of those advisers said in dis
may. "And I hate to say it, but
that's a helluva thing to say about
a man who has held the office."
In the end, the former presi
dent, whose suite is on the 70th

floor of the Detroit Plaza, had
wound up traveling to the con
vention hall headquarters of
Walter Cronkite to send a mes
sage to Reagan, who was in his
own suite on the 69th.
Ford really had not meant to
put public pressure on Reagan to
agree to his concessions, nor to
embarrass him by embracing the
notion of a co-presidency. Ford's
advisers maintained.
The said Ford went on televi
sion simply because he had been
scheduled to do so weeks ago.
