President Jimmy Carter, saying
he anticipates a "hard-fought
and thoughtful campaign," chal
lenged Republican presidential
nominee Ronald Reagan to a

promptly went politicking.
Reagan, in Detroit, lost no time
accepting the challenge offered
the day after his selection as Re
publican standard-bearer and his
announcement of George Bush
as his running mate.
Carter, who spent the week of
the Republican National Con
vention on vacation in Georgia,
flew to Jacksonville, Fla., yester
day afternoon for a day of politi
cal talks, taking his first oppor
tunity to react to the nomination
of Reagan.
After an outdoor rally in
Jacksonville, the president was
flying to Hollywood, Fla., for a
fund-raiser and a speech to the
International Transport Work
ers Federation before returning
to Washington.
Asked by reporters in
Jacksonville about the Reagan
nomination, the president said:
"1 think it's a good ticket. I think
they'll be formidable opponents,
and we look forward to a good
campaign."
And if former President
Gerald Ford had been named as

Reagan's vice-presidential
nominee?
"That would have been a plea
sure either way," the president
said.
Before departing yesterday
morning from Sapelo Island off
the Georgia coast, where he had
been vacationing. Carter made a
congratulatory telephone call to
Reagan and then sent a telegram
suggesting the fall debates "in
the various regions of our na
tion."
Reagan "said he thought that
was a good idea," Carter told
reporters later.
