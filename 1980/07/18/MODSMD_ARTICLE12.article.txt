WASHINGTON — The Departments of
Energy and Justice said yesterday that they had
uncovered no evidence that oil companies created
last year's gasoline shortage or purposely inten
sified the crisis to drive up prices.
During the time of long lines at service stations in
spring and summer of 1979, most refiners actually
charged less than the maximum prices permitted
under government regulations, the Department of
Energy said.
However, the oil companies could have made
more gasoline available to the public during the
period of scarcity ranging from May through July,
the two departments said in separate reports to
President Jimmy Carter.

Oil company officials have said that they held
hack supplies to avoid what they feared would he
even worse shortages later in the year. They noted
that Iran had curtailed production and the world oil
market was chaotic.
Neither the Department of Justice nor the De
partment of Energy report criticized the oil com
panies' actions.
The companies' critics have charged that the
firms sought to drive up prices and to tighten the
already nervous market.
"We urged the companies" to put more gasoline
into the market, Douglas Robinson, deputy head
of the Economic Regulatory Administration, told a
news conference at which the Department of
Energy report was issued. He said several com
panies refused to follow the department's advice.
