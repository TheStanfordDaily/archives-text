## Give ASSU a chance 
### 
This year, for the first time, the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
Senate and Student Financial
Manager all assumed office con
currently. at the end of last quar
ter. We hope that such organiza
tional cohesion will be reflected
by a unity of purpose and action.
We are encouraged by the po
tential of this group to create a
vibrant, efficient organization
worthy of attention and respect.
The University needs a student
association responsible to its
members and determined to
provide them with as much ser
vice as possible.
We appreciated the efforts of
last year's COP and senate in
implementing both structural
and attitudinal change within
their ranks. The ASSU. particu
larly the senate, strove to over
come a reputation, which had
frequently been tainted by polit
ical scandal and a lack of con
cern.-
One favorable result of the
ASSU's renewed vigor was its
procural of the Coffee House.
An ASSU corporation success
fully bid for this half-million
dollar-per-year venture and
turned the concessions into a
larely student-run business. Stu
dents are already benefiting
from the Coffee House's more
reasonable prices and better ser
vice.
_Many of the improvements
wrought by the ASSU were or
ganizational. Such changes do
not make memorable or exciting
front-page stories, but they are
the key elements of any prosper
ous organization.
An important step in this reor
ganization was the senate's re
turning involvement in the fi

nancial affairs of the ASSU. We
hope that the senate will use its
familiarity with student life to
direct such ASSU offerings as
typesetting, t-shirt sales and lec
ture notes along the lines desired
by the student body.
This new ASSU will soon be
working with a new University
administration. Even though
much of President Kennedy's
staff will be the same as Presi
dent Lyman's, there is no deny
ing that the overturn of administ
ration will allow for an easier
re-evaluation of an old, estab
lished relationship.
We wholeheartedly encourage
the administration to allow the
ASSU to prove its dependability
and usefulness to the Stanford
community, just as we applaud
current University officials and
Tresidder Union for extending
the Coffee House contract to the
students.
The ASSU is faced with a chal
lenging opportunity to assert it
self as a valuable organization.
With this opportunity comes the
responsibility, perhaps onerous,
to do well. A good performance
will be a meaningful asset to Stan
ford in the years ahead; a poor
one will burden future student
governments for a long while.
The sincerity of the recently
installed ASSU leadership,
along with the groundwork al
ready laid, points to the former
occurrence. We look forward to
the realization of their well
meaning intentions.
