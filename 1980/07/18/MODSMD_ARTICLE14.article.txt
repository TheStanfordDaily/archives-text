Reporting inaccurate
Edward Asiano's report on
Dr. Linus Pauling's speech of
Wed. July 9 (Daily July 11)
travesties Dr. Pauling's views
through errors of commission
and errors of omission.
First of all, the title of the talk,
omitted in the Daily report, was
"How Valuable is Nutrition in
the Control of Cancer?" Dr.
Pauling's answer, also omitted,
was "... I think it's about as
valuable as any other treatment,
or regime, at the present time —
perhaps not recognized to be so,
but that's my opinion."
Furthermore, in the course of
two successive sentences, the
story misspells "blastogenisis"
(i.e. blastogenesis), "lympha
cites" (i.e. lymphocytes),
"milignant" (i.e. malignant),and
"Colygin" (i.e. collagen, the
principal structural protein in the
body), all on the way to mis
representing Dr. Pauling's ideas
on why vitamin C is effective
against cancer.
The reporter greatly reduced

the scope of Dr. Pauling's asser
tions. Pauling regards vitamin C
as significantly effective in pre
venting and treating cancer
along with other diseases
whether infectious or not — in
cluding, for example, heart dis
ease and schizophrenia — and as
"about equally effective against
all of them."
He theorizes, with much
epidemiological evidence to
back him, that vitamin C specifi
cally acts against cancer in at
least three ways: through blas
togenesis of lymphocytes under
antigenic stimulation; and by
stimulating the body's produc
tion of antibodies, complement,
interferon and collagen fibrils.
Since we know that these natural
protective mechanisms operate
against diseases of all kinds, we
can conclude that no matter what
is wrong with you vitamin C will
help you.
The story refers to the Mayo
Clinic test of vitamin C and
cancer as "of the double blind
control variety (sic), a scientifi
cally respected test. . . ." He

does not mention that the Mayo
Clinic investigators have admit
ted to errors in their testing, and
have told the press that they may
attempt to redo their experi
ment. 1 can only point out that
these investigators (Creagen,
Moertel, et al.) misrepresented
Dr. Cameron's work in the Vale
of Leven study, neglected to
analyze their results so as to pro
vide information on the value of
chemotheraphy and on the in
teraction of chemotherapy and
vitamin C, and mistitled their ar
ticle in a manner that made their
study sound like a refutation of
Pauling and Cameron's work,
when in fact they studied a radi
cally different patient popula
tion. The majority of Mayo
Clinic patients had no natural
protective mechanisms left to
stimulate.
1 should note one last omis
sion. In his talk. Dr. Pauling es
timated that an adequate intake
of vitamin C (and other nutri
tional measures) might well re
duce the age-specific morbidity
of diseases by more than 75 per
cent. By the well-known relation
between mortality and longevity,
the Gompertz law, this corres
ponds to living 32 years long. I
cannot help regarding this as
newsworthy.

Editor's note: The Daily staff re
grets the aforementioned spelling
errors. The hlame for such mis
takes should not rest solely with
the reporter, hut equally with the
editors, whose responsibility it is
to correct reporter errors. On
matters of content, the Daily must
trust its reporters to recount
events as fairly and objectively as
possible. Every word of a speech
cannot be practically verified by
the editors. This criterion may not
always accord with the opinions
of all readers, but we will con
tinue to aim for attainable stan
dards of reliability.

the Control of Cancer?" Dr.
Pauling's answer, also omitted,
was "... I think it's about as
valuable as any other treatment,
or regime, at the present time —
perhaps not recognized to be so,
but that's my opinion."
Furthermore, in the course of
two successive sentences, the
story misspells "blastogenisis"
(i.e. blastogenesis), "lympha
cites" (i.e. lymphocytes),
"milignant" (i.e. malignant),and
"Colygin" (i.e. collagen, the
principal structural protein in the
body), all on the way to mis
representing Dr. Pauling's ideas
on why vitamin C is effective
against cancer.
The reporter greatly reduced

the scope of Dr. Pauling's asser
tions. Pauling regards vitamin C
as significantly effective in pre
venting and treating cancer
along with other diseases
whether infectious or not — in
cluding, for example, heart dis
ease and schizophrenia — and as
"about equally effective against
all of them."
He theorizes, with much
epidemiological evidence to
back him, that vitamin C specifi
cally acts against cancer in at
least three ways: through blas
togenesis of lymphocytes under
antigenic stimulation; and by
stimulating the body's produc
tion of antibodies, complement,
interferon and collagen fibrils.
Since we know that these natural
protective mechanisms operate
against diseases of all kinds, we
can conclude that no matter what
is wrong with you vitamin C will
help you.
The story refers to the Mayo
Clinic test of vitamin C and
cancer as "of the double blind
control variety (sic), a scientifi
cally respected test. . . ." He

does not mention that the Mayo
Clinic investigators have admit
ted to errors in their testing, and
have told the press that they may
attempt to redo their experi
ment. 1 can only point out that
these investigators (Creagen,
Moertel, et al.) misrepresented
Dr. Cameron's work in the Vale
of Leven study, neglected to
analyze their results so as to pro
vide information on the value of
chemotheraphy and on the in
teraction of chemotherapy and
vitamin C, and mistitled their ar
ticle in a manner that made their
study sound like a refutation of
Pauling and Cameron's work,
when in fact they studied a radi
cally different patient popula
tion. The majority of Mayo
Clinic patients had no natural
protective mechanisms left to
stimulate.
1 should note one last omis
sion. In his talk. Dr. Pauling es
timated that an adequate intake
of vitamin C (and other nutri
tional measures) might well re
duce the age-specific morbidity
of diseases by more than 75 per
cent. By the well-known relation
between mortality and longevity,
the Gompertz law, this corres
ponds to living 32 years long. I
cannot help regarding this as
newsworthy.

Editor's note: The Daily staff re
grets the aforementioned spelling
errors. The hlame for such mis
takes should not rest solely with
the reporter, hut equally with the
editors, whose responsibility it is
to correct reporter errors. On
matters of content, the Daily must
trust its reporters to recount
events as fairly and objectively as
possible. Every word of a speech
cannot be practically verified by
the editors. This criterion may not
always accord with the opinions
of all readers, but we will con
