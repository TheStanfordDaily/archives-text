## Reagan's stands more moderate 
### 
Dale Gieringer's article
(Daily, July 11) "Reagan a
laughtrist in campaign" left me
with grave doubts about his in
terest in seriously researching
political issues. Indeed, for
someone who claims to be a
former Ronald Reagan suppor
ter, I find him to be seriously

misinformed.
He asserts: "When the
greatest single threat to our na
tional security would seem to be
our dependence on Mideast oil,
Reagan harps on Taiwan and
Panama." I would say to
Gieringer, check again. In
Reagan's own words: "The'cent
ral objective of American policy
in the (middle east) region
should be to prevent the exten
sion of Soviet influence or domi
nation over any nation or coali
tion of nations. The region is es
sential to the ettective function
ing of allied nations' economies,
and is of pivotal geopolitical im
portance."
As for Taiwan, 1 can only
suggest that Gieringer should
read the 1980 Republican party
platform and/or listen to
Reagan's statements. A portion
of the platform reads "Growing
contacts between the U.S. and
the People's Republic of China
reflect the interest of both na
tions."
Richard Allen, one of
Reagan's top foreign policy ad
visers, has stated that Reagan's
foreign policy does not include a
re-recognition of Taiwan. How
ever, Reagan does feel that
"President Carter's ill-timed de
recognition of the Republic of
China (Taiwan) was a betrayal of
a long-time friend and ally . . .
(and) dealt (it) a shabby, need
less blow."
As for the Panama Canal,
Gieringer's attempt to pin the
issue to Reagan (personally, I
thought the Democrats were the
donkeys on this one) as some
thing he "harps on" or staunchly
believes will "determine the
fundamental course of events in
the 1 98()s" can only be seen as
cheap demagoguery.
1 would ask Gieringer: Does
the 19K0 Republican platform
contain so much as a word about
the Panama Canal? Does it call
for the United States to break
and/or renegotiate the treaty?
How then can this be termed a
"Reagan" issue?
Ronald Reagan has "harped
on": the economy (inflation, un
employment, taxation); defense
spending; President Carter's
multitude of incompetencies;
and his own record as governor.
When these issues are raised
with Governor Reagan now, it is
inevitably due to the question of
a reporter who wishes to con

tinue to portray him in the light
which you have chosen to accept.
Gieringer goes on to say of
Reagan that"the thoughtless de
struction of natural resources. . .
is of no apparent concern to
him." Nothing could be farther
from the truth. This oft-heard
sentiment is a pre-concelved no
tion; simply a media portrayal of
the man only believed by those
who accept what they are told
and don't check out the facts.
Reagan's general policy to
ward the environment can best
be summed up in his own words,
taken from policy statements is
sued earlier this year:
"Heightened concern for the en
vironment is probably one of the
most positive outgrowths of the
19605."
During the last quarter of
Reagan's eight-year California
governorship, he had this to say:
"California's air quality stan
dards are the highest in the na
tion. In fact, we had to get special
permission from Washington be
cause our laws are more strict
than the national laws. The same
is also true of water pollu
tion. . . Most of this legislation
went into the books with the
governor's signature.
Gicringer's over-estimation of
the role of USC economist Ar
thur I.after's advisory role ap
palls me. May 1 suggest he take a
stroll across campus to the
Hoover Institution, where
Reagan's chief economic advis
ers really come from (Martin
Anderson, Milton Friedman,
Dan Throop Smith. Thomas
Moore and Roger Freeman).
In short, a decision not to vote
for Reagan based on some of
Gieringer's statements is at best
hasty. We would do better to
look deeper. In Governor
Reagan's words, "When you
study, be sure to sec all sides of
each question and don't be
frightened by those on either
side of an argument."
As for Anderson and Carter:
A vote for Anderson is unrealis
tic â€” a short time away from the
Stanford campus will allow one
to regain a perspective on the
electability of a third-party pres
idential candidate. A vote for
Carter is a vote for four more
years of incompetence, and as
such is ludicrous.
