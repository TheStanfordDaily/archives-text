# Athletes and the college institution:
## Stanford's academics remain a top priority 
### Rick Altman Staff Writer 
One of the many favorite pastimes
American media seems to have is to take
one aspect of college and education and
turn it into a year-long issue.
Last year, a Newsweek cover asked:
"American education: What are out chil
dren really being taught?" A few months
later. Time Magazine followed suit with
an in-depth piece about college lifestyles
and their effects on college education.
Sports Illustrated started this year's
game of follow-the-leader by exploring
the relationship between college institu
tions and their athletes.
The prognosis was not encouraging.
Oftentimes there was no relationship
found whatsoever. At many universities
the magazine visited, athletics was a sepa
rate community altogether — with diffe
rent entrance requirements, different
grading criteria, entirely different cur
riculua.
The most telling statistic: 2 percent
of college athletes go on to compete pro
fessionally. What happens to the other 98
per cent depends upon the extent of the
college/athlete relationships.
Many of those 98 per cent did indeed
end up at ballparks . . . collecting a dollar
for every car. selling over-priced hot dogs
and pushing the post-game broom.
This, of course, represents an extreme;
nonetheless, an extreme that was found
all too prevalent.
Officials and coaches at Stanford were
left a bit dismayed. Not because they were
implicated in all this (they were not), but
because they were not included in it. They
feel their school would have represented
the other extreme.
"If that's true that only 2 pecent go
on to pro ball," says Stanford head foot
ball coach Paul Wiggin. "then we
overwhelming obligation to 98 per cent of
the people."
And that is one obligation that has been
fulfilled. The graduation rate for letter
man is higher than the total student body.
A study by Professor John Harbaugh, fa
culty athletic representative and presi
dent of the Pac-1 0 conference, shows that
90 percent of the male athletes in the last
five years graduated and 85 percent went
on to graduate school.
Women athletes also graduate Stanford
at a very high rate. In 1979, 87 percent of
the varsity competitions earned degrees.
"That's the bottom line," Wiggin con
tinues. "That's the number one product
we sell. Let's say you arc good enough to
play pro football. Fine, but if you're 21
years old and you find that you can't, have
a plan B. Or a plan A, really. Plan A
should be a career, plan B should be toot
ball."
Dick Dißiaso has been coaching Stan
ford basketball for five years. Fvery one
of his players has graduated.
"Not almost all of them," he says
proudly, "not missing three — but 1 00 per
cent graduation rate. How many schools
can say that?
"That's the bottom line," he adds, mir
roring Wiggin s very words. "That's why
you come to school, supposedly. I make
basketball the vehicle by which people
can go to school. There are three million
people graduating high school every year
and maybe 30 go on to play pro ball. The
real emphasis has to be on the student."'
In addition to the high athlete gradua
tion rate, Stanford sports a very clean
complexion amid the current rash of
cheating scandals plaguing athletic de

partments nation-wide.
The traceable cause of both of these
amenities seems to be the Department of
Admissions. Unlike many schools, the
coaches do not decide who will play on
their teams before Admissions first says,
yes, they can go to Stanford.
And according to Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon, a superior high school
athlete may be worthy of pro scouts and
autograph seekers, but not necessarily a
ticket to Stanford.
"Here athletes go through the same
process that any other candidate for ad
mission does," Hargadon said.
"Everyone admitted must have the
academic ability to be successful here.
"Athletes don't net 'breaks' in admis
sion. It's one of the strengths we consider,
and act favorably on in some cases. But
it's not a'break' in the sense that a student

will get in just because he or she is an
athlete, if otherwise we don't feel that
student has something to contribute to the
university."
Athletic Director Andy Geiger likes
the arrangement. "The strength of the
Stanford system is that the admissions
process is all in the admissions office. We
recruit vigorously and provide an applic
ant pool of students that we are interested
in, but we do not make the decision as to
which of them are accepted to the Univer
sity. We are aware of the admissions
parameters so we concentrate our efforts
on searching out students that have athle
tic talent and can qualify and succeed at
Stanford."
This process is understood throughout
the athletic department. Perhaps that is
one of the reasons that it works so
smoothly. Although it is natural for
coaches to be tempted by the superjfrck
who has nothing else, they all know the
rules and they play within them.
Most of them even like the rules.
"We (athletics) do the same thing the
rest of the school does."' says Dißiaso
with conviction. "Our candidate pool is
very narrow because of our admissions
requirements and that is a problem that is
part of Stanford. But it is correct. I
wouldn't want one set ot standards tor
basketball and another for the music de
partment. Everyone here plays by the
same rules. We recruit for the University
— the students are a part of it.
"You're accepted here because you can
do the work, not because you can hit a
15-foot jumper. Athletic departments arc
not supposed to run the University.
" It's frustrating, and sometimes it's dif
ficult. But it's right."
"Sometimes it breaks your heart," says
Wiggin with a smile. His job is particularly
difficult because his team is verv lame. A

basketball team starts five players, a foot
ball team starts 22. But like Dißiaso,
Wiggin is unwilling to allow his team to
make policy for the rest of the school.
"That should never happen here. Then
you have a dual standard that takes the
edge off of this school. I don't want to
sacrifice winning at any cost. But I know
the ground rules, and I'm going to fight
like thunder to be a winner within them."
Actually, it would be more accurate for
Wiggin to say that he has a pretty good
idea what the ground rules are. Even Har
gadon does not know what the criteria for
admissions are — and that is because he
refuses to define them.
"People constantly ask for defined
parameters below which its a hopeless
case," muses Geiger. "Fred (Hargadon)
always gets the question, 'How low will
vou no?' 1 raise mv hand and say. Please

don't answer that question.' Because as
soon as he says 1150 Board scores, 3.5
GPA, we're going to have somebody
who's 1 1 20 with a 3.48 whom we want."
Tennis coach Dick Gould said it best.
"There are absolutely no absolutes."
Gould waS cautious to discuss entrance
requirements — the other coaches av
oided the matter entirely — but 14 years
as the head coach has given him a feel for
the abstract mixture of attributes which
allows a student to be admitted.
" I don't care if the guy is the best player

in the world. If he is under 1000 in the
Boards and he's not, say, a solid 3.2, I
know he's got almost no chance of getting
in. 1 don't even pursue it.
"Generally speaking, it has my
experience that if a person is truly out
standing or unique in something — tennis,
music or politics — he will have an edge,
other things being equal.
"The key is how outstanding. If a kid is
number five in the country and has less
than 1200 Boards and less than 3.5,1 have
a very small chance at getting him. If that
same kid is No. 1 in the country,
then 1 have a chance at him."
The strict yet undefined guidelines
have left the athletic program remarkably
unscathed in a college athletic world that
has put corruption practically in vogue.
But what the guidelines do to the suc
cess of the teams will al ways be a mystery.
The past cannot be changed and the fu
ture probably will not be.
"One measure of success is winning and
losing," evades Dißiaso, "but that's not
the only measure. Our graduation rate is
another measure."
"When we look at a survey of athletes,"
says Wiggin, also in an attempt to resolve
the mystery, "we're different from other
schools. They look at height, weight and
speed. We look at GPA first and go from
there. It's not that we don't have the same
'athletic factor' that anyone else has,
we're just going to give you another side
of things."
Neither of these coaches could say'yes,
limitations hurt our teams,' or'no, they do
not.' There is no way to know.
The guidelines certainly cut down on
the available athletes Stanford can court.
At the same time, Stanford's aura — due
in part to the strict requirements — is an
attraction to athletes who are looking for
"another side of things."
Without the limitations, more athletes
could come to Stanford, but would they
want to? The attractive Stanford com
munity might not seem so attractive if any
old superjock could get in.
Gould believes that of the top five high
school tennis players in the country each
year, usually two of them are "realistic
candidates" for Stanford.
"Now that does not mean they will be
admitted, or that they will even want togo
— but that they are realistic candidates. If
we can get those two out of five each year,
we will continue to be contenders."
Gould's tennis team is not a good indi
cator of the range of availability that the
University has, for two reasons: Stanford
tennis has its own aura that attracts tennis
players more effectively than other
sports; and tennis players commonly
come from academically-motivated
families so they tend to qualify for Stan
ford more often than other athletes.
"It would be foolhardy to establish a
subgroup that is not qualified otherwise to
be here," Geiger said. "We would set up a
societal problem that would be the begin
ning ol the end for Stanford Athletics.
Anybody who accepts a position in the
Department of Athletics at Stanford has
to understand the context of the program
with respect to the whole community.
"In the final analysis, the academic
standards of Stanford enhance the athle
tic program because we get very special
people. Intelligence and athletics are
good partners."
And it is in that order.. The program is
not Athletics at Stanford. It is Stanford
Athletics.

we will continue to be contenders."
Gould's tennis team is not a good indi
cator of the range of availability that the
University has, for two reasons: Stanford
tennis has its own aura that attracts tennis
players more effectively than other
sports; and tennis players commonly
come from academically-motivated
families so they tend to qualify for Stan
ford more often than other athletes.
"It would be foolhardy to establish a
subgroup that is not qualified otherwise to
be here," Geiger said. "We would set up a
societal problem that would be the begin
ning ol the end for Stanford Athletics.
Anybody who accepts a position in the
Department of Athletics at Stanford has
to understand the context of the program
with respect to the whole community.
"In the final analysis, the academic
standards of Stanford enhance the athle
tic program because we get very special
people. Intelligence and athletics are
good partners."
And it is in that order.. The program is
not Athletics at Stanford. It is Stanford
Athletics.

One of the many favorite pastimes
American media seems to have is to take
one aspect of college and education and
turn it into a year-long issue.
Last year, a Newsweek cover asked:
"American education: What are out chil
dren really being taught?" A few months
later. Time Magazine followed suit with
an in-depth piece about college lifestyles
and their effects on college education.
Sports Illustrated started this year's
game of follow-the-leader by exploring
the relationship between college institu
tions and their athletes.
The prognosis was not encouraging.
Oftentimes there was no relationship
found whatsoever. At many universities
the magazine visited, athletics was a sepa
rate community altogether — with diffe
rent entrance requirements, different
grading criteria, entirely different cur
riculua.
The most telling statistic: 2 percent
of college athletes go on to compete pro
fessionally. What happens to the other 98
per cent depends upon the extent of the
college/athlete relationships.
Many of those 98 per cent did indeed
end up at ballparks . . . collecting a dollar
for every car. selling over-priced hot dogs
and pushing the post-game broom.
This, of course, represents an extreme;
nonetheless, an extreme that was found
all too prevalent.
Officials and coaches at Stanford were
left a bit dismayed. Not because they were
implicated in all this (they were not), but
because they were not included in it. They
feel their school would have represented
the other extreme.
"If that's true that only 2 pecent go
on to pro ball," says Stanford head foot
ball coach Paul Wiggin. "then we
overwhelming obligation to 98 per cent of
the people."
And that is one obligation that has been
fulfilled. The graduation rate for letter
man is higher than the total student body.
A study by Professor John Harbaugh, fa
culty athletic representative and presi
dent of the Pac-1 0 conference, shows that
90 percent of the male athletes in the last
five years graduated and 85 percent went
on to graduate school.
Women athletes also graduate Stanford
at a very high rate. In 1979, 87 percent of
the varsity competitions earned degrees.
"That's the bottom line," Wiggin con
tinues. "That's the number one product
we sell. Let's say you arc good enough to
play pro football. Fine, but if you're 21
years old and you find that you can't, have
a plan B. Or a plan A, really. Plan A
should be a career, plan B should be toot
ball."
Dick Dißiaso has been coaching Stan
ford basketball for five years. Fvery one
of his players has graduated.
"Not almost all of them," he says
proudly, "not missing three — but 1 00 per
cent graduation rate. How many schools
can say that?
"That's the bottom line," he adds, mir
roring Wiggin s very words. "That's why
you come to school, supposedly. I make
basketball the vehicle by which people
can go to school. There are three million
people graduating high school every year
and maybe 30 go on to play pro ball. The
real emphasis has to be on the student."'
In addition to the high athlete gradua
tion rate, Stanford sports a very clean
complexion amid the current rash of
cheating scandals plaguing athletic de

partments nation-wide.
The traceable cause of both of these
amenities seems to be the Department of
Admissions. Unlike many schools, the
coaches do not decide who will play on
their teams before Admissions first says,
yes, they can go to Stanford.
And according to Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon, a superior high school
athlete may be worthy of pro scouts and
autograph seekers, but not necessarily a
ticket to Stanford.
"Here athletes go through the same
process that any other candidate for ad
mission does," Hargadon said.
"Everyone admitted must have the
academic ability to be successful here.
"Athletes don't net 'breaks' in admis
sion. It's one of the strengths we consider,
and act favorably on in some cases. But
it's not a'break' in the sense that a student

will get in just because he or she is an
athlete, if otherwise we don't feel that
student has something to contribute to the
university."
Athletic Director Andy Geiger likes
the arrangement. "The strength of the
Stanford system is that the admissions
process is all in the admissions office. We
recruit vigorously and provide an applic
ant pool of students that we are interested
in, but we do not make the decision as to
which of them are accepted to the Univer
sity. We are aware of the admissions
parameters so we concentrate our efforts
on searching out students that have athle
tic talent and can qualify and succeed at
Stanford."
This process is understood throughout
the athletic department. Perhaps that is
one of the reasons that it works so
smoothly. Although it is natural for
coaches to be tempted by the superjfrck
who has nothing else, they all know the
rules and they play within them.
Most of them even like the rules.
"We (athletics) do the same thing the
rest of the school does."' says Dißiaso
with conviction. "Our candidate pool is
very narrow because of our admissions
requirements and that is a problem that is
part of Stanford. But it is correct. I
wouldn't want one set ot standards tor
basketball and another for the music de
partment. Everyone here plays by the
same rules. We recruit for the University
— the students are a part of it.
"You're accepted here because you can
do the work, not because you can hit a
15-foot jumper. Athletic departments arc
not supposed to run the University.
" It's frustrating, and sometimes it's dif
ficult. But it's right."
"Sometimes it breaks your heart," says
Wiggin with a smile. His job is particularly
difficult because his team is verv lame. A

basketball team starts five players, a foot
ball team starts 22. But like Dißiaso,
Wiggin is unwilling to allow his team to
make policy for the rest of the school.
"That should never happen here. Then
you have a dual standard that takes the
edge off of this school. I don't want to
sacrifice winning at any cost. But I know
the ground rules, and I'm going to fight
like thunder to be a winner within them."
Actually, it would be more accurate for
Wiggin to say that he has a pretty good
idea what the ground rules are. Even Har
gadon does not know what the criteria for
admissions are — and that is because he
refuses to define them.
"People constantly ask for defined
parameters below which its a hopeless
case," muses Geiger. "Fred (Hargadon)
always gets the question, 'How low will
vou no?' 1 raise mv hand and say. Please

don't answer that question.' Because as
soon as he says 1150 Board scores, 3.5
GPA, we're going to have somebody
who's 1 1 20 with a 3.48 whom we want."
Tennis coach Dick Gould said it best.
"There are absolutely no absolutes."
Gould waS cautious to discuss entrance
requirements — the other coaches av
oided the matter entirely — but 14 years
as the head coach has given him a feel for
the abstract mixture of attributes which
allows a student to be admitted.
" I don't care if the guy is the best player

in the world. If he is under 1000 in the
Boards and he's not, say, a solid 3.2, I
know he's got almost no chance of getting
in. 1 don't even pursue it.
"Generally speaking, it has my
experience that if a person is truly out
standing or unique in something — tennis,
music or politics — he will have an edge,
other things being equal.
"The key is how outstanding. If a kid is
number five in the country and has less
than 1200 Boards and less than 3.5,1 have
a very small chance at getting him. If that
same kid is No. 1 in the country,
then 1 have a chance at him."
The strict yet undefined guidelines
have left the athletic program remarkably
unscathed in a college athletic world that
has put corruption practically in vogue.
But what the guidelines do to the suc
cess of the teams will al ways be a mystery.
The past cannot be changed and the fu
ture probably will not be.
"One measure of success is winning and
losing," evades Dißiaso, "but that's not
the only measure. Our graduation rate is
another measure."
"When we look at a survey of athletes,"
says Wiggin, also in an attempt to resolve
the mystery, "we're different from other
schools. They look at height, weight and
speed. We look at GPA first and go from
there. It's not that we don't have the same
'athletic factor' that anyone else has,
we're just going to give you another side
of things."
Neither of these coaches could say'yes,
limitations hurt our teams,' or'no, they do
not.' There is no way to know.
The guidelines certainly cut down on
the available athletes Stanford can court.
At the same time, Stanford's aura — due
in part to the strict requirements — is an
attraction to athletes who are looking for
"another side of things."
Without the limitations, more athletes
could come to Stanford, but would they
want to? The attractive Stanford com
munity might not seem so attractive if any
old superjock could get in.
Gould believes that of the top five high
school tennis players in the country each
year, usually two of them are "realistic
candidates" for Stanford.
"Now that does not mean they will be
admitted, or that they will even want togo
— but that they are realistic candidates. If
we can get those two out of five each year,
we will continue to be contenders."
Gould's tennis team is not a good indi

'athletic factor' that anyone else has,
we're just going to give you another side
of things."
Neither of these coaches could say'yes,
limitations hurt our teams,' or'no, they do
not.' There is no way to know.
The guidelines certainly cut down on
the available athletes Stanford can court.
At the same time, Stanford's aura — due
in part to the strict requirements — is an
attraction to athletes who are looking for
"another side of things."
Without the limitations, more athletes
could come to Stanford, but would they
want to? The attractive Stanford com
munity might not seem so attractive if any
old superjock could get in.
Gould believes that of the top five high
school tennis players in the country each
year, usually two of them are "realistic
candidates" for Stanford.
"Now that does not mean they will be
admitted, or that they will even want togo
— but that they are realistic candidates. If
we can get those two out of five each year,
we will continue to be contenders."
Gould's tennis team is not a good indi
cator of the range of availability that the
University has, for two reasons: Stanford
tennis has its own aura that attracts tennis
players more effectively than other
sports; and tennis players commonly
come from academically-motivated
families so they tend to qualify for Stan
ford more often than other athletes.
"It would be foolhardy to establish a
subgroup that is not qualified otherwise to
be here," Geiger said. "We would set up a
societal problem that would be the begin
ning ol the end for Stanford Athletics.
Anybody who accepts a position in the
Department of Athletics at Stanford has
to understand the context of the program
with respect to the whole community.
"In the final analysis, the academic
standards of Stanford enhance the athle
tic program because we get very special
people. Intelligence and athletics are
good partners."
And it is in that order.. The program is
not Athletics at Stanford. It is Stanford
Athletics.

One of the many favorite pastimes
American media seems to have is to take
one aspect of college and education and
turn it into a year-long issue.
Last year, a Newsweek cover asked:
"American education: What are out chil
dren really being taught?" A few months
later. Time Magazine followed suit with
an in-depth piece about college lifestyles
and their effects on college education.
Sports Illustrated started this year's
game of follow-the-leader by exploring
the relationship between college institu
tions and their athletes.
The prognosis was not encouraging.
Oftentimes there was no relationship
found whatsoever. At many universities
the magazine visited, athletics was a sepa
rate community altogether — with diffe
rent entrance requirements, different
grading criteria, entirely different cur
riculua.
The most telling statistic: 2 percent
of college athletes go on to compete pro
fessionally. What happens to the other 98
per cent depends upon the extent of the
college/athlete relationships.
Many of those 98 per cent did indeed
end up at ballparks . . . collecting a dollar
for every car. selling over-priced hot dogs
and pushing the post-game broom.
This, of course, represents an extreme;
nonetheless, an extreme that was found
all too prevalent.
Officials and coaches at Stanford were
left a bit dismayed. Not because they were
implicated in all this (they were not), but
because they were not included in it. They
feel their school would have represented
the other extreme.
"If that's true that only 2 pecent go
on to pro ball," says Stanford head foot
ball coach Paul Wiggin. "then we
overwhelming obligation to 98 per cent of
the people."
And that is one obligation that has been
fulfilled. The graduation rate for letter
man is higher than the total student body.
A study by Professor John Harbaugh, fa
culty athletic representative and presi
dent of the Pac-1 0 conference, shows that
90 percent of the male athletes in the last
five years graduated and 85 percent went
on to graduate school.
Women athletes also graduate Stanford
at a very high rate. In 1979, 87 percent of
the varsity competitions earned degrees.
"That's the bottom line," Wiggin con
tinues. "That's the number one product
we sell. Let's say you arc good enough to
play pro football. Fine, but if you're 21
years old and you find that you can't, have
a plan B. Or a plan A, really. Plan A
should be a career, plan B should be toot
ball."
Dick Dißiaso has been coaching Stan
ford basketball for five years. Fvery one
of his players has graduated.
"Not almost all of them," he says
proudly, "not missing three — but 1 00 per
cent graduation rate. How many schools
can say that?
"That's the bottom line," he adds, mir
roring Wiggin s very words. "That's why
you come to school, supposedly. I make
basketball the vehicle by which people
can go to school. There are three million
people graduating high school every year
and maybe 30 go on to play pro ball. The
real emphasis has to be on the student."'
In addition to the high athlete gradua
tion rate, Stanford sports a very clean
complexion amid the current rash of
cheating scandals plaguing athletic de

partments nation-wide.
The traceable cause of both of these
amenities seems to be the Department of
Admissions. Unlike many schools, the
coaches do not decide who will play on
their teams before Admissions first says,
yes, they can go to Stanford.
And according to Dean of Admissions,
Fred Hargadon, a superior high school
athlete may be worthy of pro scouts and
autograph seekers, but not necessarily a
ticket to Stanford.
"Here athletes go through the same
process that any other candidate for ad
mission does," Hargadon said.
"Everyone admitted must have the
academic ability to be successful here.
"Athletes don't net 'breaks' in admis
sion. It's one of the strengths we consider,
and act favorably on in some cases. But
it's not a'break' in the sense that a student

will get in just because he or she is an
athlete, if otherwise we don't feel that
student has something to contribute to the
university."
Athletic Director Andy Geiger likes
the arrangement. "The strength of the
Stanford system is that the admissions
process is all in the admissions office. We
recruit vigorously and provide an applic
ant pool of students that we are interested
in, but we do not make the decision as to
which of them are accepted to the Univer
sity. We are aware of the admissions
parameters so we concentrate our efforts
on searching out students that have athle
tic talent and can qualify and succeed at
Stanford."
This process is understood throughout
the athletic department. Perhaps that is
one of the reasons that it works so
smoothly. Although it is natural for
coaches to be tempted by the superjfrck
who has nothing else, they all know the
rules and they play within them.
Most of them even like the rules.
"We (athletics) do the same thing the
rest of the school does."' says Dißiaso
with conviction. "Our candidate pool is
very narrow because of our admissions
requirements and that is a problem that is
part of Stanford. But it is correct. I
wouldn't want one set ot standards tor
basketball and another for the music de
partment. Everyone here plays by the
same rules. We recruit for the University
— the students are a part of it.
"You're accepted here because you can
do the work, not because you can hit a
15-foot jumper. Athletic departments arc
not supposed to run the University.
" It's frustrating, and sometimes it's dif
ficult. But it's right."
"Sometimes it breaks your heart," says
Wiggin with a smile. His job is particularly
difficult because his team is verv lame. A

basketball team starts five players, a foot
ball team starts 22. But like Dißiaso,
Wiggin is unwilling to allow his team to
make policy for the rest of the school.
"That should never happen here. Then
you have a dual standard that takes the
edge off of this school. I don't want to
sacrifice winning at any cost. But I know
the ground rules, and I'm going to fight
like thunder to be a winner within them."
Actually, it would be more accurate for
Wiggin to say that he has a pretty good
idea what the ground rules are. Even Har
gadon does not know what the criteria for
admissions are — and that is because he
refuses to define them.
"People constantly ask for defined
parameters below which its a hopeless
case," muses Geiger. "Fred (Hargadon)
always gets the question, 'How low will
vou no?' 1 raise mv hand and say. Please

don't answer that question.' Because as
soon as he says 1150 Board scores, 3.5
GPA, we're going to have somebody
who's 1 1 20 with a 3.48 whom we want."
Tennis coach Dick Gould said it best.
"There are absolutely no absolutes."
Gould waS cautious to discuss entrance
requirements — the other coaches av
oided the matter entirely — but 14 years
as the head coach has given him a feel for
the abstract mixture of attributes which
allows a student to be admitted.
" I don't care if the guy is the best player

in the world. If he is under 1000 in the
Boards and he's not, say, a solid 3.2, I
know he's got almost no chance of getting
in. 1 don't even pursue it.
"Generally speaking, it has my
experience that if a person is truly out
standing or unique in something — tennis,
music or politics — he will have an edge,
other things being equal.
"The key is how outstanding. If a kid is
number five in the country and has less
than 1200 Boards and less than 3.5,1 have
a very small chance at getting him. If that
same kid is No. 1 in the country,
then 1 have a chance at him."
The strict yet undefined guidelines
have left the athletic program remarkably
unscathed in a college athletic world that
has put corruption practically in vogue.
But what the guidelines do to the suc
cess of the teams will al ways be a mystery.
The past cannot be changed and the fu
ture probably will not be.
"One measure of success is winning and
losing," evades Dißiaso, "but that's not
the only measure. Our graduation rate is
another measure."
"When we look at a survey of athletes,"
says Wiggin, also in an attempt to resolve
the mystery, "we're different from other
schools. They look at height, weight and
speed. We look at GPA first and go from
there. It's not that we don't have the same
'athletic factor' that anyone else has,
we're just going to give you another side

number five in the country and has less
than 1200 Boards and less than 3.5,1 have
a very small chance at getting him. If that
same kid is No. 1 in the country,
then 1 have a chance at him."
The strict yet undefined guidelines
have left the athletic program remarkably
unscathed in a college athletic world that
has put corruption practically in vogue.
But what the guidelines do to the suc
cess of the teams will al ways be a mystery.
The past cannot be changed and the fu
ture probably will not be.
"One measure of success is winning and
losing," evades Dißiaso, "but that's not
the only measure. Our graduation rate is
another measure."
"When we look at a survey of athletes,"
says Wiggin, also in an attempt to resolve
the mystery, "we're different from other
schools. They look at height, weight and
speed. We look at GPA first and go from
there. It's not that we don't have the same
'athletic factor' that anyone else has,
we're just going to give you another side
of things."
Neither of these coaches could say'yes,
limitations hurt our teams,' or'no, they do
not.' There is no way to know.
The guidelines certainly cut down on
the available athletes Stanford can court.
At the same time, Stanford's aura — due
in part to the strict requirements — is an
attraction to athletes who are looking for
"another side of things."
Without the limitations, more athletes
could come to Stanford, but would they
want to? The attractive Stanford com
munity might not seem so attractive if any
old superjock could get in.
Gould believes that of the top five high
school tennis players in the country each
year, usually two of them are "realistic
candidates" for Stanford.
"Now that does not mean they will be
admitted, or that they will even want togo
— but that they are realistic candidates. If
we can get those two out of five each year,
we will continue to be contenders."
Gould's tennis team is not a good indi
cator of the range of availability that the
University has, for two reasons: Stanford
tennis has its own aura that attracts tennis
players more effectively than other
sports; and tennis players commonly
come from academically-motivated
families so they tend to qualify for Stan
ford more often than other athletes.
"It would be foolhardy to establish a
subgroup that is not qualified otherwise to
be here," Geiger said. "We would set up a
societal problem that would be the begin
ning ol the end for Stanford Athletics.
Anybody who accepts a position in the
Department of Athletics at Stanford has
to understand the context of the program
with respect to the whole community.
"In the final analysis, the academic
standards of Stanford enhance the athle
tic program because we get very special
people. Intelligence and athletics are
good partners."
And it is in that order.. The program is
not Athletics at Stanford. It is Stanford
Athletics.
