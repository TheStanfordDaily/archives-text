The University's plan toestab
lish a new $16 million Center for
Integrated Systems (CIS) na
tional research laboratory has
been delayed until enough in
dustrial sponsors are found to
raise the $6 million minimum
financing required before the
Board of Trustees will authorize
execution of engineering plans
for the proposed center, said
John Young, President of
Hewlett-Packard.
Each Industrial sponsor must
commit $750,000 over a three
year period for the proposed
center. So far only Hewlett-
Packard. TRW, General Electric
and Northrop Corporation have
agreed to sponsor the construc
tion of the center.
According to Electrical En
gineering Chairman John l.in
vill's office, the original plan was
to involve 15 companies as in
dustrial sponsors.

Young, a member of the CIS
Development Committee in
volved in the fundraising effort,
says only four more companies
are being sought as industrial
sponsors.
Young said IBM, Bell Labs,
Texas Instruments, Xerox and
Fairchild have expressed an in
terest in sponsoring the center.
"My own personal goal is to see
the $6 million in place by Sep
tember or October." he added.
Once the money is raised the
Trustees will be given a proposal
that asks them to proceed with
the construction of the Center.
The Trustees first meeting will
be held the second week in Oc
tober.
The objective of CIS is to
bring together the Electrical En
gineering and Computer Science
Departments so as to train new
people and to generate the new
scientific and technological ideas
that will be required to develop
very large scale integrated sys

terns (VLSI). The result of this
technology will be the develop
ment of a more powerful compu
ter.
CIS will have "truly national
significance because it will give a
technology base for industry that
is needed for the export vigor of
our country," said Young.
Site selection for the CIS isn't
final, but rumors are that it will
be built in the Varian parking lot
near the general science build
ings on campus.
The real value of CIS may be
that it will bring physically to
gether the faculty from the
Computer Science and Electrical
Engineering Departments
whose work is increasingly over
lapping.
Once industry comes up with
the necessary construction
funds, government agencies will
sponsor the research activities
of CIS such as the development
of VLSI systems
