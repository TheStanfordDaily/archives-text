# Registration to begin Monday; few exceptions to be granted

### Terry Simons Features Editor 
Registration for the draft, ap
proved by the U.S. Senate last
month, begins July 21 for men
born in 1960 and the following
week for men born in 1961.
All 19- and 20-year-old male
citizens and resident aliens will
be required to fill in a registra
tion card at their nearest post
office. The only men exempted
from registration are those on
active duty with the armed forces
or in service academies, non
resident aliens, and those con
fined in penal or mental institu
tions.
The actual day each individual
must register will depend on his
month of birth. For example,
men born in January, February
or March will register on Mon
day.
Fridays and Saturdays will be
makeup days.
The registrants will be asked
to fill in their name, address,
birth date, social security
number and telephone number
on the registration cards. Each
individual must register in per
son.
Under the law authorizing the
Selective Service, the govern

ment agency which is responsible
for providing people for the
armed forces in the event of a
national emergency, f ailure to
complete the registration card
correctly can lead to a fine of up
to $10,000 and/or a jail term of
up to five years. However, the
law does not specifically require
registrants to give their Social
Security numbers.
â€” The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACI.U) claims that
under the Privacy Act, individu
als may not be denied any lega
rights for refusing to give out
their Social Security number un
less expressly required by federal
law.
According to Michael Miller,
field representative for the
ACLU in San Francisco, many
men may refuse to provide their
Social Security number because
they consider it a basic invasion
of their privacy to have their So
cial Security numbers, which are
intended to be used for tax pur
poses, used by the Selective Ser
vice to check records.
The Central Committee for
Conscientious Objectors,
(CCCO), one of some 400
groups trying to mobilize resis
tance to the registration, is advis

ing conscientious objectors to fill
in the Social Security box on the
registration cards with the
words, "I am a CO."
According to Garland Donit
ant, spokesperson for the Selec
tive Service, this will not offi
cially register conscientious ob
jector status in the government
computers.
However, the CCO advises
this procedure as a gesture, and
added that a copy of a registra
tion card labelled CO can be
used by objectors later if the
draft is reinstated as evidence
that they notified the govern
ment of their CO beliefs at the
first opportunity.
In a more formal move against
registration, the ACLU has filed
a suit in the U.S. District Court in
Washington, charging that the
registration is unconstitutional
because it excludes women. The
intent of this suit is not to get
women included in the registra
tion, but to kill the registration
program.
How much resistance can be
expected from the young men
who are required to register is
now a matter of diverse specula
tion.
