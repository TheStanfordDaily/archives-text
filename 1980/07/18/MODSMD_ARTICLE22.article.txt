# Energy costs greatly escalate
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
Skyrocketing fuel prices
and increased consumption
are forcing more and more of
Stanford's funds into energy
costs.
According to Mark
Diashyn. a University finan
cial analyst, Stanford's
natural gas bill rose by 66.4
percent from September to
May of this past academic
year, and electricity costs rose
by 57.6 percent over the same
period.
Increased consumption re
sulting from an unusually cold
spring and the addition of
new buildings also has contri
buted to the need for $6.8
million to pay for energy costs
last year and a projected total
of $7.2 million for 1980-81
energy costs.
Energy costs now claim 5
percent of the operating
budget and are increasing at a
much higher rate than any
other part of this budget, ac
cording to Tim Warner, a
staff associate in the
Academic Planning Office.
"When unanticipated costs
go up so fast, there is an im

pact in terms of limiting your
flexibility to do things within
the budget," Warner said.
"Innovation and improve
ment are impaired and new
programs we might otherwise
have done can't be im
plemented when the condi
tional budget is used for
energy. Hence conservation
must be utilized to its
maximum potential."
Diashyn points out that
"fuel costs are an outside
element which we cannot
control, but we can control
use. This is especially impor
tant when natural gas and
electricity prices are going up
at such rapid rates."
Lynda Weisberg, Stan
ford's energy program man
ager, has outlined the steps
necessary to bring rising
energy costs back down to a
growth rate equivalent to that
of the operating budget.
Over the next three years,
electricity consumption must
be reduced by 18 percent
from present usage levels and
natural gas consumption cut
by 43 percent. If both goals
are achieved, Weisberg as
sures the University could
save over $10 million.
