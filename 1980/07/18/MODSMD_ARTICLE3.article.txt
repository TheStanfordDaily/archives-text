## McPherson plans to stay No. 1 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
The hardest way to come up in
the business world is to go
through school, according to
Rene McPherson, new dean of
Stanford's Business School.
In a press conference on Wed

nesday, McPherson noted that
one's willingness to observe, lis
ten and learn from others are
invaluable to one's education in
or out of school. McPherson said
one of his reasons for accepting
the deanship is his desire to make
a contribution.
"The system has been very
good to me, and in taking this
position I feel I'm going back and
reinvesting in that system,"
McPherson said.
Fifth dean
At 55, McPherson is the fifth
dean in the history of the
Graduate School of Business,
and succeeds Arjay Miller who
retired in June after 10 years as
dean. Seriously injured in a car
crash last December, McPherson
still walks with a crutch, but the
accident has not dampened his
enthusiasm.
Miller led Stanford to the posi
tion of one of the top business
schools in the country, and
McPherson said one of his major
goals will be keeping that posi
tion.
"You can't start resting on
your oars," McPherson said, "or
people will go by you like a
shot."
To provide students with the
most useful education, McPher
son said it will be important to
focus on two major issues.
Two issues
The first, according to
McPherson, is that"Business has
become very international. No
longer are we looking only at the
United States; we are citizens of
the world."
Secondly, curriculum must be
geared to the situation in the
19905, not the 1980s, for this is
when students will be applying
their skills.
He emphasized that students
should not be wrapped up in

looking for an immediate pay off
from their education.
"I don't think your first job is
very important," McPherson
said. "Ten years later — that's
when you realize how important
your education is."
Dana Corp.
McPherson comes to Stanford
as chairman of the Dana Corpo
ration, based in Toledo.Ohio,
where he has worked for 28
years.
He does not foresee a tough
adjustment to his new position.
Over the years McPherson has
been involved in academia. He
was the impetus behind the Dana
University, an in-house school
which offers business and techni
cal training to Dana employees.
He is also a Wilson Fellow and
as such makes annual visits to
college campuses, conducting
seminars with students and fa
culty.
Listening to people
While at Dana. McPhcrson
vigorously enforced his dedica
tion to "listening to people,"
converting the company into a
very decentralized body where
decisions are made at the lowest
possible level.
As McPherson said in a Wall
Street Journal interview, "a per
son is pretty smart about hi> own
job," as McPherson has proven
through his own background.
The dean received his B.S. in
engineering from Case Institute
of Technology and received an
MBA degree from Harvard Bus
iness School. He joined Dana in
1 952 as a sales engineer and ad
vanced to become president in
1968.
When asked why he came to
Stanford, McPherson said,
"What was it Marlon Brando
said? Oh yes — it was an offer I
couldn't refuse."
