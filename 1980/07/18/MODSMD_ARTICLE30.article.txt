## 'Teacher': summers best? 
### 
In the midst of a sea of disap
pointing and sleazy comedies
that have been released this
summer (Used Cars, Up the
Academy, Roadie, etc.), along
with a series of dull thrillers
(Rough Cut, The Island, Hanger
18), there is one movie you can
go see that still exudes simplicity,
charm and honest-to-God high
caliber quality performance.
Why Shoot The Teacher, now at
the Aquarius in Palo Alto,
should get this year's vote to re
place last year s Breaking Away
as Surprise Summer Hit.
Why Shoot The Teacher is the
low-key little story of a young
man (Bud Cort, better known as
the suicidal Harold of Harold
and Maude) who takes his first
job as a school teacher in the
depression-torn Canadian out
back, Sasketchawan, 3000 miles

away from his home in the East.
The movie chronicles the dif
ficulties he has adjusting not only
to the arduous life of the tundra,
but also in coping with the pov
erty stricken lural children, chil
dren who have spent their whole
lives thousands of miles from
anywhere.
In the course of his year in
Sasketchawan, Max, the hero,
has a brief affair with a terribly
lonely farmer's wife (Samantha
Eggar), does a one-day stint as a
political activist with the newly
formed Socialist Party, learns to
discipline boys twice his size and
weight, deals with a stubbornly
inefficient school inspector, and
finally conquers the dreadful,
all-encompassing cold and lone
liness of the Canadian North.
In short. Max comes of age.
But Why Shoot The Teacher is
more than just another run-of
the-mill "Rites of Passage"
movie. Max's heroism in facing
his own peculiar trials is certainly
as intriguing and as courageous
as Luke Skywalker facing the
whole Galactic Empire.
Because Why Shoot The
Teacher does not try to do too
much, what it does try to do suc
ceeds brilliantly. The photo
graphy, which captures the chill
and barren landscape of Sas
ketchawan, is thrilling, and its
quiet beauty affects the whole
scenario.
Not the least of Max's prob
lems is in merely going to the
toilet... no mean feat in a coun
try where there is no indoor
plumbing, and the temperature
rarely rises above zero degrees

Fahrenheit. The plight of poor
Max's initial search for a feasible
outhouse is heartbreaking.
These types of episodes are
sprinkled throughout Why Shoot
The Teacher, and though they
are hardly romanticized, they
give the movie its realistic, yet
amusing flavor.
Bud Cort, as Max, does a
commendable job of conveying
naivete, terror, intelligence, and,
at times, utter joy as his job prog
resses through various stages of
despair and success. Samantha
Eggar, as the lonely London
woman displaced and married to
a hardened Sasketchawan
farmer, is moving, and her feel
ings of isolation and desolation
at being in the wilds of Canada
with little hope of ever seeing a
city again are shockingly real.
Why Shoot The Teacher is
another in a series of recent films
which depict historical scenes of
personal triumph. Australian
films My Brilliant Career and
Picnic At Hanging Rock suc
ceeded in much the same manner
as this film, giving roots to little
known aspects of Australian cul
ture.
What makes this film so
charming is its simplicity. It por
trays real life, yet it is never
mundane â€” the high quality of
each performance, the script,
and the photography, all contri
bute to making it a lovely film. It
is a welcome relief from the
onslaught of tediously overdone
films gracing other movie threat
ers this summer.
