# 'Hooters' to open next Wed.
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer Theatre's second show, Ted Tally's Hoot
ers, will open next Wednesday, July 23 at 8 p.m. in the Little Theatre.
It will subsequently run July 24-26 and July 30-August 2.
Set in a summer resort at Cape Cod, Hooters centers on two
19-year old men and their feverish sexual pursuit of two slightly older
women.
The main prey, Cheryl, a 25-year old woman facing impending
marriage to a boring bank executive, is surprisingly responsive,
thereby drawing feminist reprovals from her outspoken friend,
Ronda.
According to director Jim Carmody, Hooters is a comedy border
ing on farce, contrasting the shallow adolescent swashbuckling of the
boys with the worldliness and thoughtfulness of the women.
While the play may seem little more than a seaside romp, says
Carmody, it nonetheless imparts a good deal of wisdom about
relations between men and women and about the fears and insec
urities behind extreme personal stances.
Playwright Talley treats the characters with great subtlety, Car
mody says. At the beginning of the play, he notes, audiences are more
likely to be drawn to the likable Cheryl and Clint, but by play's end will
almost certainly develop a greater interest in the extremists, Ricky
and Ronda.
Hooters was first performed in April of 1978 at Playwright's
Horizon in New York City, and was recently done at The Empty
Space in Seattle. Playwright Ted Tally, a product of the Yale School
ot Drama, wrote Terra Nova, his highly-acclaimed first work.
