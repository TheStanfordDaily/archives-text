## 'Airplane!' soars with comic energy 
### 
It would be a crime to spoil this
movie by giving away all the
good bits. Suffice it to say that
Airplane! is one of those grab
bag comedies in which its makers
— the same group responsible
for Kentucky tried Movie —
throw in every gag that could
ever come to mind so that the
film seems to be in the bloated

magazine title glimpsed in the
background, or a ludicrous
sound effect; Airplane! drips

play its jokes; the mugging of
someone like Dom DeLuise,
who appears in 90 percent of
these sorts of movies, is con
spicuously and happily absent.
Instead Airplane! has assembled
