Trevino and Watson
lead
MUI RFIELD, Scotland
(AP) — Lee Trevino, who
usually plays his best in hot
weather,defied biting cold,
blustery winds and driving
rain for a 3-under-par 68 yes
terday and a tie with Stanford
graduate Tom Watson for the
first round lead in the 109 th
British Open Golf Champ
ionship.
Trevino said he was unruf
fled by the miserable playing
conditions that raked the
Muirfield links and left most
of the international field of
151 golfers dripping and
shivering.
"I expect "em," Trevino

said of the conditions. "1
work on this tournament
mentally. I expect wind, rain
and cold weather here. I came
prepared.
"Heck, you ought to see my
suitcase. Heaven save me if it
ever turned warm — I'd die.
I've got nothing cool to
wear."
The day started cold and
stayed cold — sometimes col
der than at other times, but it
was never warm. Jack
Nicklaus and others pulled on
mittens.
"It was the worst day to
plav in the British Open since
1964." Nicklaus said, "and
that was the worst day I ever
played in."

When Watson and Balles
teros finished in mid
afternoon and the rains con
tinued and the cold deepened
and the winds continued to
bite in from the Firth of
Forth, even the Scots began
to drift away.
"1 played well, with a lot of
confidence," said Irevino,
who scored his second British
Open triumph in 1972, the
last time it was played at
Muirfield. "I didn't play well
in the practice rounds, but
that don't count. I like to run
when the game starts.
"I always feel like 1 have a
chance of winning any time
I'm playing in a golf tourna
ment," he said.
