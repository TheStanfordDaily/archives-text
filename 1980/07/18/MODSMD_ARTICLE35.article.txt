"As the campaign of 1976 wore
on, he Found himself more and
more bewildered. How had
America come to this strange
time in its history?"
In the fall of 1976, 1 shame
fully confessed to my history ad
viser that the more I read about
modern American history, the
more confused I became. The
adviser smiled, and told me 1 was
not alone, but 1 did not believe
him. Thus was I surprised to find
Theodore White, journalist, au
thor and historian, making the
sanjf confession in his latest
work, In Search of History. Un
like me, he has begun to under
stand the answers to his ques

tion.
White's insight into the re
volution in China, post-war re
covery in Europe, and cold war
America are invaluable, in part,
because he had the luck and the
instinct to be where momentous
events were making history.
White's adventure encompasses
the personalities, the events and
the ideas which shaped world
history between 1938 and 1963.
Throughout his work. White
presents richly human vignettes
of the great figures he came to
know. When Chou En-lai of
fered him roast suckling pig at a
dinner in his honor. White put
down his chopsticks, and
explained as best he could in
Chinese that he was Jewish and
that Jews were not allowed to eat
any kind of pig meat. This cast a
shadow over the Communist

banquet: "the group, all friends
of mine by then, sat downcast
and silent, for I was their guest,
and they had done wrong."
White says Chou himself took
over, lifted his chopsticks, and
repeated 'ch'ing, ch'ing' (please,
please), pointed at the roast pig,
and grinning, said: 'Teddy, this is
China. Look again, see. Look. It
looks to you like pig — this is a
duck.' White burst out laughing:
"He laughed, the table laughed.
I plunged the chopsticks
in. broke the crackle, ate my first
mouthful of certified pig, and
have eaten of pig ever since for
which I hope my ancesters will
forgive me . . . (Chou) was that
kind of man — he could make
one believe that pig was duck,
because one wanted to believe
him and because he understood
the customs of other men and

societies and respected them."
Writing for the New York
Times book Review, Richard
Rovere states: "In Search of His
tory has all the pace and energy
of the earlier work and many
other things: more insight, more
reflections, more candor, more
intimacy, more humor, more
humility, surer and sharper
judgments of those he writes ab
out, including himself."
White I'dmits that Chou En-lai
was, along with Joseph Stilwell
and John F. Kennedy, "one of
the three great men I met and
knew in whose presence I had
near total suspension of disbelief
or questioning judgment."
White's portraits of these men,
and a host of others including
Chiang K'ai-shek ("a man com
bining " Methodist morality" and
'animal treachery'), Madame
Chiang ("mistress of every level
of the American language from
the verses of the hymnal to the
most sophisticated bitchery"),
Konrad Adenauer ("The Old
Fox"), Jean Monnet, Henry
Wallace, and Dwight
Eisenhower, are filled with inti
mate and intriguing details sel
dom found in history texts.
Yet White gives us more than
sparkling character sketches.
The story he tells satisfies great
curiosity and fills an immense
and troublesome gap in our
knowledge of the events that
shaped modern American his
tory.
To me, the best chapters are
those on China. In 1938, White
graduated summa cum laude
from Harvard in Chinese history.
That year, he went to China on a
traveling scholarship, "to find
out what was happening there:
How did history actually hap
pen?"
Witnessing one of the great
upheavals of the twentieth cen
tury, White soon learned an
"iron rule" of politics and
power: "people accept govern
ment only if the government ac
cepts its first duty — which is to
protect them." He saw com
munists in the hills, not yet cal
ling themselves government, but
becoming government because
they offered protection.
The formulas White presents
to understand the revolution in

China are clear and simple. He
says, for example, "Revolutions
are made by intellectuals. Not all
intellectuals are revolutionaries.
But it intellectuals can weave
their ideas about what bothers
ordinary people, they can ens
nare and mesh them together. If
they are shrewd enough to de
scribe conditions to workers and
families so that simple people
recognize what is cramping them
or destroying them — then they
can mobilize these people to
change things, to kill, to hunt, to
die, to be cruel . . .
Critics, including Eric F.
Goldman, who reviewed In
Search of History for Saturday
Review, find White's formulas
too simple. Goldman says re
volutions "come from a tangled
multitude of circumstances." 1
don't believe White's analysis is
over-simplified (the moving
forces of history are not always
best discerned from behind a
desk). White stayed close to the
action, and "action always and
ultimately brought me back to
politics and history." In Search
Of History deftly untangles the
"multitude of circumstances'
which caused ther evolution in
China.
White's instinct led him to
Europe in IM4B, to see the Mar
shall Plan unfold. There he
learned that there are two ways
of governing men: "one either
lures them forward by hope of
gain ... or one drives them for
ward by bayonet ..." From
