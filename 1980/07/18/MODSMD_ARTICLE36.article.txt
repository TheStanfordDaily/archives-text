Who has conversed with
Churchill, Hitler, Mussolini,
Goering, and Goebbels, and
joked with Stalin and Roosevelt?
Who guessed at the Nazi-Soviet
pact before the Washington ex
perts did, quotes Shakespeare,
and anticipates Bertrand Russell
and Bernard Shaw, and has time
left over to become an admiral,
sire a family of heroes and ad
venturers, and translate a Ger
man history of World War II? It
is none other than Victor "Pug"
Henry, the larger-than-life hero
of this more-than-ambitious
novel of the Second World War.
Author Herman Wouk posses
ses a knack for bringing history
to life that earned him the
Pulitzer Prize in 1952 for his
novel The Caine Mutiny. His
latest, War and Remembrance is
an emotional, dazzling, sensuous

history of World War II as lived
by the Henry family.
Wouk creates a world largely
lost to the post-Vietnam genera
tion. We can still see its dim re
flection in our parents, but it is
slipping away. For those who
have lived through the war this
'book will bring back memories
of a different military age, con
cerns then fresh, faiths more cer
tain. For those of us who have
not, Woi-k has done his best to
recreate it.
We follow the marriage of Pug
Henry to the beautiful but weak
Rhoda that began in Wouk's
1000 page prologue The Winds
of War. Pug advances up the
Navy career ladder as his
youngsters start their own lives;
each of them is shaped by global
events that sweep them along.
Son Byron continues his ro
mance with that beautiful Jewish
Phi Bete from Radcliffe, Natalie
Jastrow, and finds a career in the
submarine service. Warren, a
Clark Gable sort with a "godlike

quality" becomes a Navy pilot,
has affairs with women of all ages
from Florida to Hawaii, and
helps stop the Japanese at the
Battle of Midway. Daughter
Madeline rejects her father's
straight-laced morality and finds
happiness in the shallow world of
Hollywood.
The marriage between Pug
and Rhoda, built up as a central
pillar in Winds of War, crumbles
under the separation forced by
war and the mid-life crisis pro
voked by aging and dissatisfac
tion. Around this nexus spins a
galaxy of sub-plots and events.
Wouk bounces us around his
world at a supersonic pace. We
count the corpses in a North Af
rican tank battle. We watch the
construction of the cre
matoriums at Auschwitz. In fact,
we see every major battle of the
war and moment of passion in
this family. War and lechery are
the constant themes of War and
Remembrance.
