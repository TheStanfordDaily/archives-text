It is difficult anymore to use
certain words in a poem. Not
four-letter words, of course, or
the bugbear of genitalia. Those
are easy enough it seems.
Rather, words like "angel" or
"soul." High falootin' metaphys
ical words, let's say. And this
difficulty is to some extent justi
fiable. We want poetry to speak
to our experience, not simply to
our ancestors'. Thus, in Galway
Kinnell's new book. Mortal Acts,
Mortal Words, the ephemeral
appeal of the epigram from Pet
rarch might surprise a contem
porary reader: "... mortal
beauty, acts and words have put
all their burden on my soul." The
truth is, though, that Kinnell is at
his best when he tempts us with
abstractions, teases us, then —to
rephrase Stevens a bit —
bloodies them. Kinnell spirals us
back down to a physical earth, to
a life of bone and flesh, the living
of which is indeed a burden, but
also a blessing.
By taking the reader to the
lived particular, many of these
poems make concrete the pain
and joy of being mortal. "St.
Francis and the Sow," in the first
section of the book, is such a
poem. Here Kinnell celebrates
the physical, shows us, or the sow
in each of us, that even in our
mire bespattered ugliness there
is beauty. Though everything
"flowers from within of self
blessing," it is sometimes neces
sary "to reteach a thing its lovli
ness."
Other poems in the first sec
tion also successfully portray the
two faces of mortality, the pain
and the joy. "The Choir" grace
fully haunts the reader with the
knowledge that "everyone who
truly sings is beautiful," whether
the singing be from joy or
mourning. "Fisherman" and
"Wait" deal with the death of a
friend and the "enormous emp
tiness" the friend's wife now suf
fers. Also in the first section is
the endearing "After Making
Love We Hear Footsteps," in

which Kinnell's son, Fergus, ap
pears at his parents' doorway
asking "Are you loving and
snuggling? May 1 join?" Which
he does, while his parents . . .
"touch arms across his little,
startlingly muscled body—/ this
one whom habit of memory
propels to the ground of his mak
ing,/ sleeper only the mortal
sounds can sing awake,/ this bles
sing love gives again into our
arms."
The three other sections in the
book continue Kinnell's themes
of love, death, remembrance,
and — to some degree — nature.
In Part 11, I think my favorites
are "Kissing the Toad" and
"Daybreak." Try thinking of
how many poets — re known or
unknown — have written poems
on sunrise orsunset.and you'll be
delighted with Kinnell's inven
tiveness in "Daybreak." The
whole of Part 111 consists of
poems concerning the poet's
family and their gradual di
minishment through death,
especially the deaths of his
brother and mother. All five
poems — "The Sadness of
Brothers," "Goodbye," "Look
ing at Your Face," "The Last
Hiding Places of Snow," and "52
Oswald Street" —are quite mov
ing. Exceptionally good in Part
IV are "The Mild Bottle" and
"Flying Home."

"... as Saint Francis put his hand
on the creased forehead of the
sow, and told her in words and in
touch blessings of earth on the
sow, and the sow began
remembering all down her thick
length from the earthen snout all
the way through the fodder and
slops to the spiritual curl of the
tail,
from the hard spininess spiked
out from the spine
down through the great broken
heart
to the blue milken dreaminess
spurting and shuddering
from the fourteen teats in the
fourteen mouths sucking and
blowing beneath them:
the perfect loveliness of sow."

Despite the excellence of most
of the poems, a few problems
should he mentioned. The first
has to do with the old show or tell
distinction. Kinnell is too often
content with using words like
"sad" or "happy" in order to tell
us about an emotion instead of
somehow showing us the emo
tion fleshed out. He is indeed at
his best when he makes abstract
emotions concrete. Yet, he is not
always at his best. Secondly, he
tends to overuse anaphora, an
old cataloguing technique of be

ginning consecutive phrases or
sentences with the same word or
words. Using anaphora in one
poem works well, in two be
comes questionable, and in
three . . . well, one rather wishes
he hadn't. My third difficulty is
with only one or two poems: the
conversational style turns too
conversational. "Angling, A
Day" is a case in point. 1 have
nothing against this type of style;
in fact. 1 like it quite a bit. At
times, however, it can become
too lax. My last problem con
cerns only one poem, "Two Set
Out on Their Journey." The
poem centers around the
metaphor of reading pages in the
book of our lives, a metaphor re
ally so cliche that not even as
good a poet as Kinnell can do
much with it, regardless of his
success with the poem on the
traditional theme of daybreak.
Mortal Acts, Mortal Words as
a whole, however, very much
mitigates these criticisms. It is a
book more quiet than his earlier
Body Rags (1968) and The Book
of Nightmares (1971), less
bizarre. It can creep up on a
reader and not let go. In com
parison to his collection of
poems from 1946-64 (1971),
there are proportionately more
good poems in the newer book.
Readers who are familiar with
Kinnell already, and like him,
should also like Mortal Acts,
Mortal Words. Those familiar
with him, but not finding him
suitable (formalists perhaps) still
might learn something from his
keen perceptiveness. Readers
who do not know Kinnell's work,
or even contemporary poetry in
general, might have balked at the
strangeness of his earlier books.
But in so far as Mortal Acts, Mor
tal Words is concerned, I can
only tell them, "Read Kinnell."
