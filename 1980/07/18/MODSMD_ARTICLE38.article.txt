New Vanity, Palo Alto
A bittersweet, funny comedy about
an Italian immigrant who is battered
by the system when he tries to make a
go of it in Switzerland's promised
land. This movie has a wit and warmth
to it which make it eminently watcha
ble. Nino Manfredi, as the immigrant,
has one of those gifted faces which can
make anything seem either funny or
tragic. Anna Karina is fine as an im
migrant from Greece; Franco Brusati
directed.
Plays next Tuesday and Wednes
day.
—Jim Mattson
Kramer vs. Kramer
Fox Theater, Redwood City
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an astonish
ing one With the interplay between a
brilliant Dustin Hoffman and a
youngster of almost frighteningly cor
rect instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton constructs a
moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like character study of a di
vorced man's struggle to love and care
for his son (and vice versa).
But there's gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the cus
tody case at the end of the film. After
all the care and honesty Benton's in
vested throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the female
character (Meryl Streep)?
In the main, Benton has done a
superb job in taking slender movie
material and creating a movie of sur
prising depth and complexity. Jane
Alexander co-stars, and the superb
composition is the work of cinematog
rapher Nestor Almendros. Plays
through Saturday.

The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randall Kleiscr
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a
'40s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.
—J.M

The Blue* Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wur.f has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers arc
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown" of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J M.
The Shining if
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

Five Easy Pieces ★★★★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces
explores an American Dream as it
follows an oil-rigger, Jack Nicholson,
in a search for something new, diffe
rent — better. Nicholson, the black
sheep of his upper-class, artistic family,
lives with Rayette, his pregnant
white-trash girlfriend (played endear
ingly by Karen Black). As Nicholson
confronts his elite background, Rafel
son pinpoints the clash between
American values and American ide
als. Rafelson brilliantly creates
characters that are both unusual and
vivid. His talent is especially keen
when focused upon the details of per
sonal relationships. Sensitive and
thought-provoking, this film is well
worth your buck.
—Leslie Bixel

Sleeper ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen before he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You
Always wanted to Know About Sex
' But Were Afraid to Ask, plays tonight
through Sunday.
—J.M

Tht Island
Old IVtill, Mountain View
Anyone foolish enough to take this
movie seriously needs to suspend a
good deal more than his disbelief. Un
relenting violence, a non-existent
sense of adventure, and insipid
dialogue work together to produce a
sodden, silly pirate movie. Michael
Caine plays a journalist at the mercy
of a pirate clan that survives by plun
dering tourists' yachts after slitting (in
loving slow-motion) their throats.
Pretty Bahamas scenery isn't enough
to make this movie worth the cost of
your admission ticket.

(irand Illusion ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Renoir's 1937 masterpiece,set
in a WW 1 German prison camp, can
be seen as a marvelous adventure
story; as a melancholy essay on the
loneliness of man; as a masterful study
in changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of naturalistic
cinematography. It is all of these and
much more, and might even make you
cry. With excellent performances by
Jean Ciabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich
von Stroheim. Plays Sunday only.
—Mike Hale
Madame Rosa ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Simone Signoret's performance as
Madame Rosa, a Jew who finds her
self playing guardian to an Arab boy,
vitalizes this uneven, ultimately com
pelling film. Some moments ring false
— the ending, with its last shot of
endlessly spinning recording tape,
seems sadly out of place. But the film
also has much that is undeniably right.
Signoret, once legendary for her
beauty, allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her part
makes it easy to ignore the weaknesses
in the film's technique and structure.
Plays next Tuesday and Wednesday.

Kramer vs. Kramer
Fox Theater, Redwood City
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an astonish
ing one With the interplay between a
brilliant Dustin Hoffman and a
youngster of almost frighteningly cor
rect instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton constructs a
moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like character study of a di
vorced man's struggle to love and care
for his son (and vice versa).
But there's gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the cus
tody case at the end of the film. After
all the care and honesty Benton's in
vested throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the female
character (Meryl Streep)?
In the main, Benton has done a
superb job in taking slender movie
material and creating a movie of sur
prising depth and complexity. Jane
Alexander co-stars, and the superb
composition is the work of cinematog
rapher Nestor Almendros. Plays
through Saturday.

The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randall Kleiscr
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a
'40s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.

The Blue* Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wur.f has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers arc
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown" of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J M.
The Shining if
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

Five Easy Pieces ★★★★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces
explores an American Dream as it
follows an oil-rigger, Jack Nicholson,
in a search for something new, diffe
rent — better. Nicholson, the black
sheep of his upper-class, artistic family,
lives with Rayette, his pregnant
white-trash girlfriend (played endear
ingly by Karen Black). As Nicholson
confronts his elite background, Rafel
son pinpoints the clash between
American values and American ide
als. Rafelson brilliantly creates
characters that are both unusual and
vivid. His talent is especially keen
when focused upon the details of per
sonal relationships. Sensitive and
thought-provoking, this film is well
worth your buck.

Sleeper ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen before he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You
Always wanted to Know About Sex
' But Were Afraid to Ask, plays tonight
through Sunday.

Anyone foolish enough to take this
movie seriously needs to suspend a
good deal more than his disbelief. Un
relenting violence, a non-existent
sense of adventure, and insipid
dialogue work together to produce a
sodden, silly pirate movie. Michael
Caine plays a journalist at the mercy
of a pirate clan that survives by plun
dering tourists' yachts after slitting (in
loving slow-motion) their throats.
Pretty Bahamas scenery isn't enough
to make this movie worth the cost of
your admission ticket.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Renoir's 1937 masterpiece,set
in a WW 1 German prison camp, can
be seen as a marvelous adventure
story; as a melancholy essay on the
loneliness of man; as a masterful study
in changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of naturalistic
cinematography. It is all of these and
much more, and might even make you
cry. With excellent performances by
Jean Ciabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich

Madame Rosa ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Simone Signoret's performance as
Madame Rosa, a Jew who finds her
self playing guardian to an Arab boy,
vitalizes this uneven, ultimately com
pelling film. Some moments ring false
— the ending, with its last shot of
endlessly spinning recording tape,
seems sadly out of place. But the film
also has much that is undeniably right.
Signoret, once legendary for her
beauty, allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her part
makes it easy to ignore the weaknesses
in the film's technique and structure.
Plays next Tuesday and Wednesday.

migrant from Greece; Franco Brusati
directed.
Plays next Tuesday and Wednes
day.

Kramer vs. Kramer
Fox Theater, Redwood City
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an astonish
ing one With the interplay between a
brilliant Dustin Hoffman and a
youngster of almost frighteningly cor
rect instincts named Justin Henry as
the movie's heart, Benton constructs a
moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like character study of a di
vorced man's struggle to love and care
for his son (and vice versa).
But there's gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the cus
tody case at the end of the film. After
all the care and honesty Benton's in
vested throughout, why does he have
to load the dice against the female
character (Meryl Streep)?
In the main, Benton has done a
superb job in taking slender movie
material and creating a movie of sur
prising depth and complexity. Jane
Alexander co-stars, and the superb
composition is the work of cinematog
rapher Nestor Almendros. Plays
through Saturday.

The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randall Kleiscr
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a
'40s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.

The Blue* Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wur.f has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger, splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers arc
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown" of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?

The Shining if
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

Five Easy Pieces ★★★★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces
explores an American Dream as it
follows an oil-rigger, Jack Nicholson,
in a search for something new, diffe
rent — better. Nicholson, the black
sheep of his upper-class, artistic family,
lives with Rayette, his pregnant
white-trash girlfriend (played endear
ingly by Karen Black). As Nicholson
confronts his elite background, Rafel
son pinpoints the clash between
American values and American ide
als. Rafelson brilliantly creates
characters that are both unusual and
vivid. His talent is especially keen
when focused upon the details of per
sonal relationships. Sensitive and
thought-provoking, this film is well
worth your buck.
—Leslie Bixel

Sleeper ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Sleeper is exactly the kind of movie
that people who didn't like Woody
Allen before he made Annie Hall
didn't like. This is a movie with very
little social value, and virtually none of
the melancholia that haunts Allen's
later films. The film's only redeeming
quality is that it manages to be out
rageously funny.
Miles Monroe goes into the hospital
for a simple operation. Something
goes wrong, so he is flash-frozen to be
revived centuries later in a world gone
weird.
Sleeper, triple-billed with Allen's
Love and Death and Everything You
Always wanted to Know About Sex
' But Were Afraid to Ask, plays tonight
through Sunday.

Tht Island
Old IVtill, Mountain View
Anyone foolish enough to take this
movie seriously needs to suspend a
good deal more than his disbelief. Un
relenting violence, a non-existent
sense of adventure, and insipid
dialogue work together to produce a
sodden, silly pirate movie. Michael
Caine plays a journalist at the mercy
of a pirate clan that survives by plun
dering tourists' yachts after slitting (in
loving slow-motion) their throats.
Pretty Bahamas scenery isn't enough
to make this movie worth the cost of
your admission ticket.
—Kathy Thoelecke
(irand Illusion ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Jean Renoir's 1937 masterpiece,set
in a WW 1 German prison camp, can
be seen as a marvelous adventure
story; as a melancholy essay on the
loneliness of man; as a masterful study
in changing social roles; and as an
unparalleled showcase of naturalistic
cinematography. It is all of these and
much more, and might even make you
cry. With excellent performances by
Jean Ciabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich
von Stroheim. Plays Sunday only.
—Mike Hale
Madame Rosa ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Simone Signoret's performance as
Madame Rosa, a Jew who finds her
self playing guardian to an Arab boy,
vitalizes this uneven, ultimately com
pelling film. Some moments ring false
— the ending, with its last shot of
endlessly spinning recording tape,
seems sadly out of place. But the film
also has much that is undeniably right.
Signoret, once legendary for her
beauty, allows herself to look haggish
and eccentric here; the way this
woman throws herself into her part
makes it easy to ignore the weaknesses
in the film's technique and structure.
Plays next Tuesday and Wednesday.
