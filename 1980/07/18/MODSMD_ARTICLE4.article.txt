## Jewish Americans attack Israeli gov't 
### Edward Cody The Washington Post 
JERUSALEM — An ex
traordinary swell of open criti
cism from American Jewish
leaders has irritated the Israeli
government and left some offi
cials worried about the health of
Israel's vital relationship with
U.S. Jewry.
The issue is both crucial and
delicate here. Israelis of all polit
ical persuasions are convinced
that, as those who live here and
fight Israel's wars, they alone
have the right to make its deci
sions. But at the same time, they
encourage concern for Israel
among American Jews and rely
on their influence in Washington
for maintaining the United
States' traditional military and
diplomatic support of the State
of Israel against the Arab na
tions.
A recent series of public com
plaints from U.S. Jewish leaders
against Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's West Bank
settlements policies thus has
been taken seriously here — an
grily by some, with concern
about its long-term dangers by
others. Although exchange of
opinion has been a constant in
ties between Israel and Ameri
can Jews, the new complaints are
considered sharper than ever be
fore and directed at policies that
many Israeli officials regard as
pait of Israel's security precau
tions.
The U.S. critici>m was voiced
repeatedly this week — and at
tacked by Israeli leaders as
harmful — at a U.S.-Israeli col
loquy sponsored by the Ameri
can Jewish Congress whose de
bates centered on the right of
U.S. Jews to interfere in Israeli
affairs and vice versa.

A contentious backdrop to the
discussions was a statement
signed early this month by more
than 50 prominent American
Jews expressing dissatisfaction
with Begin's policies and con
cern with "extremists in the pub
lic and the government." This
was interpreted as criticism of
Jewish zealots who establish
West Bank settlements on religi
ous as well as security grounds
with encouragement from the
Begin government, particularly
Agriculture Minister Ariel Sha
ron.
This left a bitter taste in the
mouths of some officials around
Begin, also irritated by the word
ing of the statement that seemed
to attack Begin without naming
him. One tried to persuade
another signer. Allen Pollack, to
retract his adherence, so far
without success. The bitterness
was in proportion to the prestige
of the signers, who also included,
among others, Seymour Martin
I.ipset (of Stanford), Arthur
Hertz berg, Irving Howe and
Martin Peretz.
In some respects, the U.S.
criticism, voiced against the
background music of Israeli poli
tics, takes on partisan tones
perhaps not intended by its au
thors. A major pitch of the op
position Labor Party revolves
around criticism of Begin's lack
of flexibility on the West Bank
and his use of religion as well as
security as justification for set
tlements there.
In addition, the statement
signed by U.S. Jewish leaders
was drafted by Israel's own
Peace Now movement, a pres
sure group that directs much of
its energy against Begin in an
effort to force a more flexible
negotiating stand on the gov
ernment.
