# Bulge studied as volcano blast cause

It was a small bulge that de
veloped on the upper north flank
of the volcano. Approximately
one mile in diameter, the bulge
continued to grow through April
and May at the rate of l-l 1 /:
meters per day.
On May 18, a small ear
thquake loosened the surface of
the bulge and the build-up of
magma and steam was released.
The events leading up to the
eruption of Mount St. Helens
and subsequent volcanic activity
was the subject of a talk given by
Wendell Duffield, the coor
dinator of the Geothermal Re
search Program (U.S. Geologi
cal Survey) in the fourth of seven
speeches of the NASA-ASEE
Aerospace Technology Seminar.
According to Duffield, these
earthquakes were movements of
magma, or melted rock material
pushing its way upwards in the
mountain.
Duffield explained that this
bulge of magma and steam was a
result of hot magma coming into
contact with water just beneath
the surface of the mountain.
Boiling water caused a pocket of
steam to push the mountainside
upward.
He stated that the eruption
was interesting but tragic as
there was no warning of a major
eruption even one hour before
the event. Hence, people in the
area were not alerted in time and
many lives were lost.
However he was eager to point
out the positive effectsof the vol
canic activity.
Scientists had an opportunity
to study the growth of a bulge as
well as the relationship between
earthquake activity and volcanic
eruptions. According to Duf
field, a volcano like Mount St.
Helens is a different phenome
non than the less explosive and
safer eruptions of Hawaiian vol
canoes. Also, the volcano's ash,
spread in an 100 square mile

radius, would prove to be benefi
cial to the region's soil.
With the aid of slides, Duffield
showed scenes of the volcano's
damage.
Molten rock followed down
the Toutle River for 15 miles,
raising the level of the current by
100-200 feet.
Similarly, rock flowed into
nearby Spirit Lake adding 160
feet of debris and volcanic mate
rial to the lake. In all directions
trees were scattered "like pick
up sticks," their branches and
leaves having been torn off by
the force of the blast.
On May 25, another eruption
spewed largely ash. Though the
volcano has been quiet for sev
eral days now, a dome "several
feet tall" grows in the crater
since June 12.
"Clearly, many destructive
things happened," quipped
Duffield.
Presently, as coordinator of
the Geothermal Energy Prog
ram, Duffield is involved in as
sessing the geothermal nature of
the Cascade Range of which Mt.
St. Helens is a part.
The thrust of the program is to
find places in the Range where
magma has tried to reach the
surface but has not broken
through. The heat from this
magma can be used to heat water
and to provide steam needed to
generate electricity. Says Duf
field, "Magma is indeed still
moving through the Cascade
Range."
