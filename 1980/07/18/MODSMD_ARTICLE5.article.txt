# Other nations assess Reagan
## 
### Associated Press 
Calling Ronald Reagan's foreign policy "adven
turistic" the Soviet Union took a strong stand
yesterday against the new Republican candidate's
quest for the presidency. China, the other Com
munist giant, expressed concern over future U.S.
relations with Taiwan.
European reaction to the Reagan-George Bush
ticket varied from warm praise by the respected
French daily Le Monde to the London Financial
limes' comment that Reagan's views appeared
"simple-minded."
The official Soviet news agency Tass said
Reagan stands for defending the interests of big
business at home and pursuing "an aggressive ad
venturistic course in foreign policy."
It warned that any attempt to gain military
superiority over the Soviet Union was "doomed to
failure."
Also in the Eastern bloc, the Polish news agency
PAP, in a report from its correspondent in Detroit,

said Reagan's extreme conservatism sought no less
than U.S. "domination" of the world by military
force.
China's official news agency, Kinhua, said
Reagan wants to protect America's "old friends"
on the Nationalist Chinese island of Taiwan.
China has expressed concern that if Reagan is
elected, he would re-establish ties with Taiwan,
which the United States severed as a condition for
establishing relations with communist China.
Reagan has denied he would try to do so.
Reagan got a friendlier reception in France. Le
Monde, the independent afternoon paper in Paris,
said of Reagan in an editorial:
"At nearly 70, he seems to have brought a new
youth to the Republican Party."
The paper said Ik- had been careful not to "shut
himself into a prehistoric ideology" like Sen. Barry
Goldwater, the right-wing Republican candidate
defeated in 1964, and had learned the necessity of
compromise.
