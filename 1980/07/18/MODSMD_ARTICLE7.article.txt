# Iran tries to solve hostage issue
## 
### Jay Ross The Washington Post 
TEHRAN, Iran — Iran took
another step yesterday on its tor
turous road toward the estab
lishment of a parliamentary gov
ernment that will be responsible
for determining the fate of the
American hostages.
The Majlis (parliament)
elected six lawyers as members

of the 12-man Council of Guar
dians, which is empowered to
judge whether the laws passed by
the legislature are in accordance
with Islam and the constitution.
The other six members, all cler
gymen, were appointed last Feb
ruary by the country's religious
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
The completion of the council
means that when the Majlis
meets again Sunday it will be
capable of passing legislation. Its
first action is scheduled to be
approval of a prime minister and
cabinet. No firm date has been
set for President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr to present his choice
to parliament, but it is expected
to be within the next week.
The president said in a televi
sion interview yesterday that it
was "very likely" that a decision
on the hostages would be made
by the Majlis "in the next few
weeks."
A close aid to Bani-Sadr re
cently outlined a scenario 111

which the Majlis would approve
a hill laying out general
guidelines and order the new
government to negotiate with
the United States. In this offi
cial's optimistic view, the
guidelines would not include a
demand for the return of the
ousted shah, Mohammad Re/a
Pahlavi — the original reason for
the seizure of the American Em
bassy Nov. 4.
Instead, after a short debate,
parliament would call for efforts
to repatriate the shah's wealth,
the end of the U.S. freeze on
Iranian assets, an American
pledge not to intervene in Iran
and some kind of gesture from
the United States acknowledging
its role in returning the shah to
power in a I 953 coup and main
taining his authority for another
26 years. The details would then
be left for U.S.-Iranian negotia
tions, said the official, who felt
there was a fair chance to get an
agreement and release of the
hostages before the U .S. election
campaign heats up in September.
