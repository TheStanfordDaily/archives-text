## Curfew ordered in Miami 
### Dan Sewell Associated Press 
MIAMI — The National
Guard was activated and police
ordered a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew
in part of Miami's Liberty City
area "to restore order to the
streets"' yesterday in the third
day of violence in this racially
torn city.
Early in the day, masked black
youths armed with knives and a
gun commandeered a school bus
on its way to pick up students,
and two women were wounded
in separate shootings.
County Manager Merrett
Stierheim declared a state of
emergency and set the curfew in
the James Scott housing project
in the largely black Liberty City
district.
Gov. Bob Graham's office an
nounced that 400 Guardsmen
were placed on ready reserve in
Miami-area armories and that 50
Florida Highway Patrol troops
also were put on alert in the city.
Stierheim's state of emergency
conditions included establish
ment of police barricades around
the area to prevent nonresidents
from entering and bans on sale
and public display of firearms,
sale of gasoline except directly
into a gas tank and the carrying
of alcoholic beverages in public
places.
Restore order
"We're trying to restore order
to the streets," Robert De
mpsey, acting director of the
Dade County Public Safety De
partment, announced at a news
conference with Stierheim.
"Right now that area is under
the control of criminal elements,
people with guns," he said. "This
will give us a tool to go after the
criminals and take their firearms
away."
The curfew will last at least
three nights, but could be ex
tended further, Dempsey said.
Dempsey said officers would
arrest anyone on the streets in
the restricted area without
"good reason." He added that
the policy of police restraint
would continue, explaining that
officers would not chase offen
ders into buildings where con
frontations could occur.
Restricted area
The restricted area covers 170
square blocks, comprising the

James Scott Housing project in
Liberty City.
The predicted day-long rain
that police had hoped would
calm tensions didn't last past
noon.
Violence in the Liberty City
neighborhood, scene of rioting in
May in which 18 people were
killed, erupted Tuesday after the
shooting of a white officer who
was pursuing two black robbery
suspects. "We chased them in
the project area," said wounded
officer Sgt. Fred Pelny. "They
fought us. They started hollering
to the crowd and the crowd start
ing coming and they started

shooting at us."
Police estimated at least 30
civilians required hospital treat
ment for injuries suffered during
the first two troubled nights.
Spokesman Rueben Jones
said officials were having trouble
pinning down the number of
disturbance-related arrests, "be
cause many of them are being
handled by juvenile authorities."
Before dawn yesterday, eight
blacks were arrested and
charged with armed robbery
after a school bus on its rounds
was commandeered. Jones said
driver Deborah Carter, 21, a
black, was uninjured.
