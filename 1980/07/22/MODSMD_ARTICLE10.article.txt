## Queen tells of his captivity 
### Stephen Lynton The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Richard
Queen, giving his first public ac
count of captivity in Iran, said
yesterday that he was never
brainwashed, almost never inter
rogated, but feels "like Rip van
Winkle" after eight months in
virtual isolation.
The 28-year-old embassy vice
consul, freed for treatment of
multiple sclerosis, depicted his
harshest ordeal as a period of
two to four months in a basement
room without windows. At
times, he said, he was forbidden
to speak with other hostages in
the same room.
"In a situation like that, the
imagination does horrible
things," Queen said during a
ha If-hour news conference.
"Living in that basement, it was
getting grim — it really was."
The soft-spoken diplomat,
seeming relatively relaxed de
spite his illness, appeared at the
televised news conference altera
tumultuous welcome by hun
dreds of cheering, clapping and
whistling State Department col

leagues.
He asserted that his Iranian
captors were not Marxists or
members of the Tudeh Party, the
principal pro-Moscow Com
munist group. "As far as I knew,
they were students, and they were
certainly not Tudeh Party," the
Persian-speaking Queen said. "1
will definitely say that they were
fervent Moslems and were very
anti-Communist."
He said he did not learn about
the aborted April 24 U.S. milit
ary rescue mission until his de
parture from Iran July 11. "I
didn't know a thing about it until
then." he said. "News filtered
through very poorly and slowly."
Queen noted, moreover, that
his conditions of confinement
did not appear to have been al
tered after the U.S. raid. "The
conditions lor me did not really
change," he said.
Immediately after the rescue
attempt. Iranian militants an
nounced they were dispersing
the hostages to other cities away
from Tehran. Despite conflicting
reports, U.S. officials have said

they believe at least some hos
tages were removed from
Tehran.
Although saying he was una
ware of the U.S. military mis
sion, Oueen indicated, nonethe
less. that he had heard vaguely
about some unspecified event.
The hostages thought the United
States had "planned something"
and then "called it off," Queen
said.
The tall, heavily bearded dip
lomat described his initial medi
cal treatment in Iran as
haphazard. When his symptoms
first developed last December, a
pharmacy student called a doctor
known as "The Quack," he said.
Only considerably later, when he
suffered more severe symptoms,
did a "conscientious and consid
erate" medical student summon
a highly trained doctor for help.
Queen said.
He is currently undergoing
medical tests and treatment at
Georgetown University Hospital
and is expected to go to his pa
rents' Maine home in a few days,
according to U.S. officials.
