WASHINGTON — The first
of 4 million young American
men began signing up for the
draft yesterday amid scattered
peaceful protests and continued
skirmishing over the legality and
morality of the registration.
The registration appeared to
proceed with few serious prob
lems, but demonstrations did
occur in some cities and draft law
opponents threatened more.
In Washington, about three
dozen people blocked the entr
ance to the building housing the
headquarters of the Selective
Service System. They were dis
persed without any arrests.
Post offices, where men born
in 1960 and 1961 are to register
during the next two weeks, were
also the scene of demonstrations
throughout the United States. In
Kansas City, Mo., youths held
hands in front of registration and
marched outside the building.
Those signing up were not deter
red.
Donald Ethier, acting post
master in Kansas City, said re
gistration there went "very
fine."

"There are a few pickets and
things like that, but nothing seri
ous," Ethier said. "They aren't
stopping anybody "
Postal officials in Providence,
R. 1., reported that the locks in
about 30 offices were clogged
with glue or some packing sub
stance. forcing officials to use
back doors.

In Louisville, Ky., and
Hartford, Conn., some de
monstrators greeted youths who
came to sign up, but did not stop
them.
Estimates on the number of
registrants across the nation
were unavailable, but a Selective
Service spokeswoman said all
was "fine and quiet."
