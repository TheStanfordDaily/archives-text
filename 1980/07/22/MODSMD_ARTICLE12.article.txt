# Economy: More jobless
## 
### Glenn Ritt Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — The Car
ter administration predicted yes
terday that nearly a million more
American workers will lose their
jobs by the end of the year and
that the unemployment rate will
not improve throughout 1981.
In a gloomy mid-year revision
of its budget figures, the ad
ministration predicted that:
— Unemployment will rise
from its current level of 7.7 per
cent to 8.5 percent by the end of
the year and will not improve
during 1981.
— That there is no hope of pro
ducing a balanced federal
budget.
— That consumer prices bet
ween last December and De
cember 1980 will have increased
1 2.8 percent.
Despite the dismal forecast
form the Office of Management
and Budget, administration offi
cials said there will be no prop
osal for a tax cut to stimulate the

economy at this time.
In its mid-year report, the ad
ministration said unemployment
now is expected to hit 8.5 per
cent by the end of the year. At
the current level of 7.7 percent
unemployment, the Labor De
partment says there are S million
people out of work. At 8.5 per
cent, the total would be 8.9 mill
ion.
Charles Schultze, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advis
ers, said the jobless rate could
even reach 8.6 percent next year,
significantly higher than the ad
ministration's forecast in March
of a peak 7.2 percent level.
Some private economists ex
pect joblessness to come very
close to 9 percent.
In addition, the administration
officially laid to rest hopes of a
balanced budget, conceding that
the steep recession will lead to a
billion deficit in fiscal
1981, which begins Oct. 1. That
is a sharp change from administ
ration estimates in March of a
$1b.5 billion federal surplus.
