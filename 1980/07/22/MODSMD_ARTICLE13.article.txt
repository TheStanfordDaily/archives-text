Rebuttal inadequate
1 wish to make clear to Jim
Hedges (Daily, July IS) that it
was precisely out of respect for
the Hoover Institution that I
warned against Reagan's elec
tion (Daily, July 11). Unfortu
nately, it is not their advice, but
rather that of Laffer, Kemp and
Roth which Reagan seems to
have followed in making a 30
percent tax cut a centerpiece of
his campaign.
On this count alone, Reagan
has doomed himself to follow in
Jimmy Carter's footsteps by
committing himself to unfulfilla
ble promises. It would be a
shame it this reflected discredit
on his better advisors as well.
The lip service he has paid to
the environment is unfortunately
outweighed by his repeated de
precation of conservation as an
energy strategy vis-a-vis oil pro
duction.

His recognition of the impor
tance of Mideastern oil is
likewise undone by his apparent
failure to recognize that it cannot
be secured by a predominantly
military strategy.
And as for the Panama Canal,
it is scarcely "demagoguery" on
my part, as Hedges alleges, to
suggest that it has been blown up
out of all proportion to its impor
tance, when Reagan and his sup
porters are reported to have
taken it as one of two touchstone
issues — the other being abor
tion — on which Vice-
Presidential candidates were to
be judged.
With priorities such as these, it
seems highly unlikely that
Reagan can attract the kind of
political support necessary to
"renew the American compact,"
any more than Nixon could
"bring us together again" or Car
ter "renew our trust" in govern
ment.
I would of course agree with
Hedges that a vote for Carter is a
vote for incompetence; but no
less a publication than the Wall
Street Journal has expressed
similar doubts about Reagan,
lamenting the absence of a
"younger, more experienced and
more profound candidate."
If, as Hedges claims, Reagan
and Carter are the only "realis
tic" alternatives, then that is a
shame, but it scarcely justifies
voting for either of them.

Disarmament wrong
In response to the column by
Newlaiui Shepard "Disarma
ment Needed" (Daily, July 11), I
agree with Shepard's premise
that the arms race is potentially
dangerous and certainly an un
ethical situation. The mere fact
of having such awesome power
at the command of a few indi
viduals who are not endowed
with godly insight or restraint
strikes fear in my heart.
However, Shepard's solution
to the problem, unilateral disar
mament, is totally unrealisticand
could lead to disaster.
The United States and the
Soviet Union are two superpow
ers who are engaged in an in
tense struggle to spread their in
fluence around the world. They
are not two benevolent giants
who seek to be left alone in
peace. Whether it be putting a
shah into power or sending an
army into Afghanistan, both
countries continually de
monstrate their willingness to
expand. And it is this desire to
expand that makes Shepard's
solution unacceptable.

Shepard contends that if the
United States disarms, without
any prior agreements with the
Soviet Union, the Soviets would
he nice people and do so in re
turn because they would no
longer consider us as an aggres
sor and would feel no need to
launch an attack.
Poppycock!! Contrary to
Shepard's belief that the Soviets
are in the arms race only because
the United States has forced
them to be, the Soviets actually
are about the most aggressive
political force in the world today.
In the last 15 years the Soviets
have outspent the United States
in arms to the tune of about three
to one. They claim they were
doing this to catch up. But if
that's their goal, the Soviets have
long since exceeded it.
The Soviet standing army is
larger than America's. It has
more modern equipment in
every area (tanks, missiles, sup
port weapons), and it is ready to
use them to further its own in
terests, as the people in Af
ghanistan can bear witness to.
Is all this merely a "reaction"
by the Soviets as Shepard con
tends? I think not.
Warsaw pact countries are de
ploying more nuclear systems
than NATO countries by a total
of 5364 to 2045. They have al
most double the number of
ground forces, reinforcements
and tactical aircraft. And they
have an astounding three times
the number of tanks, which are
the staple of modern ground con
flict.
So in light of all this, SALT
still appears to be about the only
viable alternative to heavier es
calation of the arms race. It has
its drawbacks (not the least of
which is the fact that it isn't actu
ally a disarmament agreement,
but more of a limiting agree
ment), but it's the only game in
town.
There is absolutely no evi
dence that the Soviets will at any
time in the future alter their ex
pansionist military philosophy,
and so the inter-nation dialogue
of SALT must be maintained.
It is no longer satisfactory for
us to allow ourselves to be una
ware of events as the American
people were in the early stages of
Vietnam. We must move out
from behind our books and delu
sions and confront the realities of
the world. We only have one
world and one chance to save it.
SALT is not a panacea, but
hopefully by negotiating for
mutual disarmament, we can
slowly cease hostilities with the
Soviets and move towards a
world of peace.
