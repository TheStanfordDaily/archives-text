# American dream is on wheels
## 
### 
I've got a car. 1 can go any
where. at any time.
If I feel like sand and sun. hey.
I'm off to the beach. Feel like
some mountains? Tahoe in four
hours.
Movies? Concerts? Anytime 1
want. This is great.
My car makes me a long dis
tance person. I can have many
friends in far-away places. I can
go wherever I want to. I can go to
crazy places in the middle of the
night!
I did all of these things for
months and months. Then some
offensive killjoy ruined my fun.
This person claimed that using
my car for crazy things is waste
ful. He said that 1 squander pre
cious fuel each time that I use my
car unnecessarily.
Well, I've never been so in
sulted. And I told him so.
He told me that I was not only
wasting fuel, but that I was also
making the air dirty. There is a
limit to how much dirt the aircan
take, he said.
Hah!, I said. I can breathe.
When the air is thick enough to
walk on, I'll worry. Leave me
alone.
He wouldn't leave me alone.
We (my car and I) were given no
mercy. I was attacked with statis
tics showing that we will run out
of resources and ruin our atmos
phere in 20 years.
My car and 1 could prevent this

absurd possibility? Come now,
let's be reasonable.
But there was no reasoning
with this ehap. The barrage of
t acts, examples of waste and pol
lution. and predictions of when
our supply of fuel and breathable
air will "run out," was formida
ble.
Finally, I had to reconsider.
The guy had a point. There is a
limit to the extent that we can
exploit the earth. My original
pride was quickly transformed
into shame. I felt like a real idiot.
Here I was, internally combust
ing at random, oblivious to the
harmful consequences of my
travels.
So. I quit driving, except when
absolutely necessary. It was a lot
easier than I had anticipated.
Not having to wait in long lines
to pay many dollars for gallons of
a volatile liquid was a luxury that
1 had not foreseen. Life without
driving turned out to be quite a
relief; for a while.
But withdrawals soon set in. I
felt unbearable cravings to
search for wide beaches and high
mountains. I was constantly
nervous, and concentration be
came difficult. Sometimes I
would even shake.
Something had to be done. I
could no longer stand the frustra
tion of not driving. I started to
make excuses to go places like
the grocery store. Once I even

went to get a haircut. Not a
pretty picture, I know.
One night, during a particu
larly bad case of the D.T.'s (de
lerious tremors), I knew that 1
had to have an answer. I needed
an affirmation that driving is
good. The battle was over. My
spineless body had been crushed.
As I lay convulsing on my bed.
I got desperate. I decided to
pray. 1 prayed and prayed for
something to show me what to
do.
The next morning, my answer
came with the newspaper. On
the front page was an article
about the Republican Party plat
form. The new conservatives
vowed to maintain the au
tomobile as America's symbol of
"personal mobility and free
dom."
If I would have known that this
is what my car represented, I
never would have gone through
the trauma of abstaining from
driving. 1 was thrilled.
So, we might use up our air
and fuel someday. A few years of
mobility and freedom, in the true
American tradition, arc certainly
worth it.
I just hope that big cars are
better representations of our
mobility and freedom than small
cars are.

If I would have known that this
is what my car represented, I
never would have gone through
the trauma of abstaining from
driving. 1 was thrilled.
So, we might use up our air
and fuel someday. A few years of
mobility and freedom, in the true
American tradition, arc certainly
worth it.
I just hope that big cars are
better representations of our
mobility and freedom than small
cars are.

I've got a car. 1 can go any
where. at any time.
If I feel like sand and sun. hey.
I'm off to the beach. Feel like
some mountains? Tahoe in four
hours.
Movies? Concerts? Anytime 1
want. This is great.
My car makes me a long dis
tance person. I can have many
friends in far-away places. I can
go wherever I want to. I can go to
crazy places in the middle of the
night!
I did all of these things for
months and months. Then some
offensive killjoy ruined my fun.
This person claimed that using
my car for crazy things is waste
ful. He said that 1 squander pre
cious fuel each time that I use my
car unnecessarily.
Well, I've never been so in
sulted. And I told him so.
He told me that I was not only
wasting fuel, but that I was also
making the air dirty. There is a
limit to how much dirt the aircan
take, he said.
Hah!, I said. I can breathe.
When the air is thick enough to
walk on, I'll worry. Leave me
alone.
He wouldn't leave me alone.
We (my car and I) were given no
mercy. I was attacked with statis
tics showing that we will run out
of resources and ruin our atmos
phere in 20 years.
My car and 1 could prevent this

absurd possibility? Come now,
let's be reasonable.
But there was no reasoning
with this ehap. The barrage of
t acts, examples of waste and pol
lution. and predictions of when
our supply of fuel and breathable
air will "run out," was formida
ble.
Finally, I had to reconsider.
The guy had a point. There is a
limit to the extent that we can
exploit the earth. My original
pride was quickly transformed
into shame. I felt like a real idiot.
Here I was, internally combust
ing at random, oblivious to the
harmful consequences of my
travels.
So. I quit driving, except when
absolutely necessary. It was a lot
easier than I had anticipated.
Not having to wait in long lines
to pay many dollars for gallons of
a volatile liquid was a luxury that
1 had not foreseen. Life without
driving turned out to be quite a
relief; for a while.
But withdrawals soon set in. I
felt unbearable cravings to
search for wide beaches and high
mountains. I was constantly
nervous, and concentration be
came difficult. Sometimes I
would even shake.
Something had to be done. I
could no longer stand the frustra
tion of not driving. I started to
make excuses to go places like
the grocery store. Once I even

went to get a haircut. Not a
pretty picture, I know.
One night, during a particu
larly bad case of the D.T.'s (de
lerious tremors), I knew that 1
had to have an answer. I needed
an affirmation that driving is
good. The battle was over. My
spineless body had been crushed.
As I lay convulsing on my bed.
I got desperate. I decided to
pray. 1 prayed and prayed for
something to show me what to
do.
The next morning, my answer
came with the newspaper. On
the front page was an article
about the Republican Party plat
form. The new conservatives
vowed to maintain the au
tomobile as America's symbol of
"personal mobility and free
dom."
If I would have known that this
is what my car represented, I
never would have gone through
the trauma of abstaining from
driving. 1 was thrilled.
So, we might use up our air
and fuel someday. A few years of
mobility and freedom, in the true
American tradition, arc certainly
worth it.
I just hope that big cars are
better representations of our
mobility and freedom than small
cars are.
