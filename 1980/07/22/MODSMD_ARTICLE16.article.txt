# An early resister recalls the experience
## Prof. Paul Seaver resisted draft registration in 1950 
### Robin Severns Staff Writer 
The draft resisters of the
1960's and '70s are familiar to
most of us. Their music survives,
their names still appear in the
press, and most college students
have met at least one. Draft re
sistance didn't begin in the '60s,
however.
Paul Seaver. a professor of
16th and 17th century English
history at the University, resisted
draft registration in 1950.
Seaver is a tanned, athletic
looking man of medium height.
He has dark hair and a wide,
white smile. He wears neither
the aloofness of an intellectual,
nor the intensity of a radical.
Appearing relaxed and patient,
he swivels his desk chair and
gazes out the window, remem
bering his growing-up years.
He is a native of Pennsylvania,
he said. He was bom in Philadel
phia, but his family moved to the
country in 1940.
His father was a socialist and a
pacifist, but just before World
War 11, neither of these beliefs
would exempt him from military
service. Since he could not ob
tain conscientious objector clas
sification. he took up farming, a
vital industry during World War
11.
Pacifist beliefs
The Seaver family became
Quakers during their years in
rural Pennsylvania. Because of
their father's influence and their
religious beliefs, Paul and his
twin brother, David, embraced
deep pacifist beliefs. When they
reached the age of 18, they re
fused to register for the draft.
Charges were brought against
them, they were tried, found
guilty and sentenced to 14
months in prison.
"My parents were horrified,"
Seaver said. Nevertheless, they
were supportive and did not op
pose their sons' actions.

As a Quaker, Paul Seaver
would have had no trouble ob
taining a conscientious objector
classification. Nevertheless, he
refused to register. He felt that to
register and accept a C.O. status
would leave the Selective Servicc
System intact. The assumption
that some men should go to war
would have been left unchal
lenged. The Seaver brothers
wanted to put an end to the war
machine altogether.
Uncomfortable trial
Their trial was an uncomfort
able one for the legal authorities
because Paul and David were
obviously not criminals, accord
ing to Seaver. They were

thoughtful, well-educated young
men.
By then the Korean War had
started. Seaver believes the Un
ited States needed soldiers and
the Selective Service System
needed an example.
"1 can't let you off because
you're placing conscience above
the law and that is ultimately
subversive," the judge told the
Seaver brothers.
Paul and David were sent to
the federal prison in Danbury,
Connecticut. Seaver remembers
that the ambition of al! prison
inmates there was to do "good
time." Doing "good time"
meant not stealing, not "squeal

ing," not asking what other pris
oners' crimes were and getting
along with the guards.
Held in contempt
Getting along with the guards
was especially difficult for the
prisoners who held the guards in
contempt for making a profes
sion of giving up their treedom.
"Being a prison guard is a
very corrosive job," Seaver said
sympathetically. "You spend all
your time being with people who
don't like you."
"Good time" minimized ten
sion and kept the prisoners sane
by making it possible for them to
live in an inherently violent soci
ety without overt violence.

Does Paul Seaver regret what
he did in 1950? "You mean,
would 1 do it again?" he asked.
"Yes, I think I would. It's impor
tant for citizens to set limits on
what the government can do."
He paused a minute and then
cautioned, "Prison isn't a dif
ficult experience for some, and
some it drives People have
to consult not only their consci
ences hut also look at themselves
and decide what they can take."
He fears an epidemic of
"anti-war fever," during which
people are pressured into doing
things against their better judg
ment.
Politically motivated
Professor Seaver thinks the
registration which began this
wetjk is politically motivated. He
feels this country is being pre
pared for the active use of milit
ary force abroad.
"The case is being built in the
press. By next year I expect we'll
be told that the volunteer army is
a failure and that we need the
draft . . . Some people believe
America ought to be playing an
imperialist role (in world poli
tics)."
Seaver's words are powerful,
but they are spoken quietly. Yet
his replies are not habitual; they
are not memorized responses to
old questions. He pauses often to
consider them. He seems to
reach into his beliefs to be sure
they are still the same. Thus each
response he gives is new and
original, for it has only this mo
ment been CQnfirmed.
Yet he is never emphatic.
Perhaps his moreal certainty
makes pulpit-pounding unneces
sary. Or perhaps — and this rings
truer — he realizes that other be
liefs are just as valid as his own.
His ideas must speak for them
selves.
Seaver appears at last as a man
who hates war, and who respects
above all the individual consci
ence.
