## concerts /dean eyre A 						Goodman trip into the past 
### 
The concert date posted on the
marquee read July 19. 1980.a1l
right, but for the near-capacity
crowd at De Anza College's Flint
Center the calendar had been
flipped back to the 1930s or
'40s. Fittingly, the host on this
trip through time, back to the
heyday of the Big Band sound,
was none other than Benny
Goodman.
While pop/rock music has
taken over most of the spotlights
in the concerts and nightclub ap

pearances. the Swing Era has de
votees who make up with en
thusiasm what they lack in sheer
numbers.
A part of these fans' devotion
has the ring of an old advertise
ment: accept no substitutes.
Most of the two-hour concert
lived up to the ticket-holders'
high expectations, but a shortage
of on-stage time by Goodman
early in the performance caused
some concern before and during
the intermission.

After a couple of numbers,
Goodman took the mike and
explained that he was leaving the
concert "in the capable hands"
of the sextet and"the real
Benny Goodman will appear la
ter."
Not playing under the shadow
of the "King of Swing" allowed
the combo to prove themselves
on their own, including well
executed, simultaneous runs on
piano and guitar by Don Haas
and Eddie Duran producing con

temporary sounds a lu George
Benson. Trombonist Jerry But
zen and trumpeter Buddy Pow
ers were highlighted in a duet
during "Squeeze Me." before
scat singer and bassist Al
Obidinski and drummer John
Markham traded solos.
The combo was excellent, but
the audience understandably
longed for the legendary
clarinetist. After three numbers
without the headliner. the crowd
grew restless, scattering shouts
of "Let's hear from Benny, we
came to hear Benny Goodman."
The opinions in turn started a
wave of murmurs, some echoing
agreement and others expressing
criticism of the outspoken fans.
Although some people noted
that Goodman looked tired at
times, the absence was due to a
mix up in communications bet
ween the sextet and Goodman,
according to a band member.
Returning after the break.
Goodman was met with hearty
applause and displayed his skills
on the "harpoon" — he's so re
laxed while playing that, despite

performing difficult passages, he
makes it look as easy as brea
thing.
Vocalists Marguerite
Juenemann and sisters Mary
Lynn and Gayle Gillaspie served
up spunky harmonizing on songs
such as "Girl Talk," "L.ouie,
Louie," and "Dance the Night
Away" — if you closed your
eyes, it could have heen the An
drews Sisters, completing the il
lusion' of having gone back in
time.
Besides displaying the style
and virtuosity that has made him
a fixture in the musical world,
Goodman's repertoire with his
band and vocalists revealed his
easy going, good-humored per
sonality. When not playing, he
strolled the stage with his
clarinet tucked in the crook of his
arm like a baton, clapping for
soloists, kidding with band
members and wearing an infec
tious smile.
After a finale spiced with
march and Dixieland riffs, the

crowd roared its approval and
called Goodman back lor an en
core number featuring his solos
and Juenemann's scatting. The
audience gave the performers a
standing ovation, which Good
man acknowledged with a
farewell toot.
After the show. Goodman met
with relatives of a former band
member, alternately packing
away his clarinet, posing with
youngsters for pictures and sign
ing photographs in his dressing
room. As pianist Haas passed by,
Goodman said, "Hey you played
your fannv off!," to which Hass

quipped, "Too bad I didn't use
my lingers."
The band members noted that
Goodman, too, "played his
fanny oil," building up an inten
sity rarely seen in his concerts.

This second half surge, along
with the combo and vocalists
gave the Swing Era set what it
hoped for — the shortcomings of
the first half were completely
erased.

crowd roared its approval and
called Goodman back lor an en
core number featuring his solos
and Juenemann's scatting. The
audience gave the performers a
standing ovation, which Good
man acknowledged with a
farewell toot.
After the show. Goodman met
with relatives of a former band
member, alternately packing
away his clarinet, posing with
youngsters for pictures and sign
ing photographs in his dressing
room. As pianist Haas passed by,
Goodman said, "Hey you played
your fannv off!," to which Hass

quipped, "Too bad I didn't use
my lingers."
The band members noted that
Goodman, too, "played his
fanny oil," building up an inten
sity rarely seen in his concerts.

This second half surge, along
with the combo and vocalists
gave the Swing Era set what it
hoped for — the shortcomings of
the first half were completely
erased.
The concert date posted on the
marquee read July 19. 1980.a1l
right, but for the near-capacity
crowd at De Anza College's Flint
Center the calendar had been
flipped back to the 1930s or
'40s. Fittingly, the host on this
trip through time, back to the
heyday of the Big Band sound,
was none other than Benny
Goodman.
While pop/rock music has
taken over most of the spotlights
in the concerts and nightclub ap

pearances. the Swing Era has de
votees who make up with en
thusiasm what they lack in sheer
numbers.
A part of these fans' devotion
has the ring of an old advertise
ment: accept no substitutes.
Most of the two-hour concert
lived up to the ticket-holders'
high expectations, but a shortage
of on-stage time by Goodman
early in the performance caused
some concern before and during
the intermission.

After a couple of numbers,
Goodman took the mike and
explained that he was leaving the
concert "in the capable hands"
of the sextet and"the real
Benny Goodman will appear la
ter."
Not playing under the shadow
of the "King of Swing" allowed
the combo to prove themselves
on their own, including well
executed, simultaneous runs on
piano and guitar by Don Haas
and Eddie Duran producing con

temporary sounds a lu George
