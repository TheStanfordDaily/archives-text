# Thieves seek money, tapes
## Car vandalisms on the rise 
### Chris Rogers Staff Writer 
There has been an enormous
upsurge in campus car vandalism
in the past few weeks. Five cases
were reported to the Stanford
police last week, in which vent
windows have been forced or
even smashed. All vandalized
cars were parked in the Univer
sity lots.
The vandalism is a result of car
burglaries, according to Lt. Mar
vin Moore of Stanford Police
Services. In June, the number of
reported auto burglaries was 39,

and so far this month the count
stands at 25. The average
number of auto burglaries on
campus is only five or six a
month. "Over the last two
months, we have been hit by a
barrage of auto burglaries." said
Moore.
The rash of car burglaries
began in Palo Alto last month
and shows no sign of letting up.
Lt. Moore said he believes it to
be the work of a well organized
gang from "off campus," who
know what they are after, and
who know how to get it. No posi

tive descriptions of suspects have
been obtained, and hours of
police stake-outs have been
fruitless.
The main areas being hit are
parking lots around athletic
facilities such as Eucalyptus Rd
and Angell Field, and residential
lots, especially in Escondido Vil
lage.
Athletic area parking lots ac
count for most of the burglaries
involving the losses of money or
valuables. People working out
have tended to empty their poc
kets in the car. and returning,
have found the rear window
smashed and their valuables
gone.
The majority of these cases
have occurred from K a.m. to 2
p.m., and without a single report
of suspicious persons.
Residential area burglaries
have involved mostly the loss ot
stereo equipment and cassettes.
These crimes have occurred
mainly in the early hours of the
morning.
Moore said circumstances
point to the possibility of two
rings operating.
Moore asked that community
members watch for people hang
ing around the athletic facilities
in normal clothing, and that they
be suspicious of battered old cars
without license plates or with a
temporary sticker. These are the
autos usually used bv car burg
lars.
To prevent your car from be
coming a target, Moore suggests
making everything less con
spicuous. All valuables should be
locked in the trunk, even empty
purses. Stereos are hard to con
ceal, but he cautioned not to
leave tapes lying in the seats.
