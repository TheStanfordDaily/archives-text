# The 						Blues Bros. give it their all in Concord
## 
### 
Dan Aykroyd and John Be
lushi were not raised as rhythm
and blues musicians.
For this reason, they have
come under some fire lately.
Blues purists claim that the two
actors are ripping off the public
in their act as Jake and Elwood
Blues, two Chicago bluesmen.
There are much better, and
perhaps more "real" blues musi
cians who should be getting the
recognition, the purists say; not
these two rich white boys.
And they're probably right.
The Blues Brothers are an act.
They're not for real. Their band,
probably the best one money
could buy. is just that — bought.
And their fans are mostly clean
cut white kids who live in places
like Piedmont and Atherton. not
Chicago's back streets.
But there comes a time in deal
ing with self-righteous purists
and/or experts in any field when
one must simply ask them to
"shut the hell up." If there were
ever a time to do so, this may be
it.
Aykroyd and Belushi have
embraced their Blues Brothers
act with such care and energy, it
shines like a freshy-polished
Cadillac. You have to sec them
in person to believe it; TV, re
cords and the movie just don't do
the trick.
The Blues Brothers were in

town last weekend, playing two
sold-out shows at the pleasant,
open-air Concord Pavilion. And
from their now famous opening
to their exuberant rendition of
"Soul Man." the show oozed en
tertainment. One might even go
so far as to call it "family enter
tainment," though Belushi's lan
guage is not exactly guarded, and
many of the songs contain rather
lurid lyrics.
Part of what makes the Blues
Brothers live show so Fun (with a
capital "F") is the fact that Ayk
royd and Belushi are very
talented showmen. The two
dance like nothing you ever saw,
combining some Charleston,
some jitterbug and some what
ever. In fact, one of the evening's
biggest surprises came when a
flickering strobe light was
switched on in the middle of one
of the Brothers' dances. Already
dressed in '40s clothing, the two
took on the look of Laurel and
Hardy in a jerky old motion pic
ture.
But beyond the Brothers'
mugging and the stage's Chicago
gas station set (complete with
regular gas listed at 27.9 cents).
Belushi is not a bad singer and
Aykroyd plays the harmonica
with far better than average skill.
Belushi got his chance to really
show off his singing skill on a
couple songs, most notably

"Shot Gun Blues," the bluesiest
of the evening's tunes. Belushi's
weakest moment was when he
sang Randy NewmanV'Guilty."
Instead of sounding genuinely
blue, Belushi sounded more like
his hilarious Joe Cocker imita
tion. But one weak song out of an
entire evening's worth? Not bad
for a comedian.
Despite repeated attempts to
divert some of the attention from
themselves to their band, Ayk
royd and Belushi stole the show.
It's certainly understandable,
though somewhat unfortunate.
Buoyed by big names (well,
they're all pretty big names) like

Tom Scott on saxophone, Tom
Malonc on trombone and Matt
Murphy on guitar, the Blues
Brothers Band really rocks. The
band's precision on songs like
"Green Onion," a classic in
strumental by Booker T. and the
MG's, entranced the audience.
The show, which included 25
songs, including encores, was
comprised mostly of material
from the band's two albums.
Briefcase I 'ull of Blues and their
movie soundtrack. Songs which
they haven't recorded, like "Go
ing to Miami," "Who's Making
Love to Your Old Lady," and a
modernized version of "There's
a Riot Going On" (the warden

has a laser gun, now), added
extra class to an already strong
show.
So the purists may not like it,
hut the Blues Brothers are ex
tremely entertaining. And what
the purists may not realize is that
in their own way, Aykroyd and
Belushi are introducing a great
style of music to a group of
people who might otherwise
have spent their whole life listen
ing to Sammy Hagar and Pat
Tr avers.
1 guess Aykroyd put it best as
he and the rest of the band took a
final bow, "We're on a mission
from God," he said, "and the
mission is the music!"

mugging and the stage's Chicago
gas station set (complete with
regular gas listed at 27.9 cents).
Belushi is not a bad singer and
Aykroyd plays the harmonica
with far better than average skill.
Belushi got his chance to really
show off his singing skill on a
couple songs, most notably

"Shot Gun Blues," the bluesiest
of the evening's tunes. Belushi's
weakest moment was when he
sang Randy NewmanV'Guilty."
Instead of sounding genuinely
blue, Belushi sounded more like
his hilarious Joe Cocker imita
tion. But one weak song out of an
entire evening's worth? Not bad
for a comedian.
Despite repeated attempts to
divert some of the attention from
themselves to their band, Ayk
royd and Belushi stole the show.
It's certainly understandable,
though somewhat unfortunate.
Buoyed by big names (well,
they're all pretty big names) like

Tom Scott on saxophone, Tom
Malonc on trombone and Matt
Murphy on guitar, the Blues
Brothers Band really rocks. The
band's precision on songs like
"Green Onion," a classic in
strumental by Booker T. and the
MG's, entranced the audience.
The show, which included 25
songs, including encores, was
comprised mostly of material
from the band's two albums.
Briefcase I 'ull of Blues and their
movie soundtrack. Songs which
they haven't recorded, like "Go
ing to Miami," "Who's Making
Love to Your Old Lady," and a
modernized version of "There's
a Riot Going On" (the warden

has a laser gun, now), added
extra class to an already strong
show.
So the purists may not like it,
hut the Blues Brothers are ex
tremely entertaining. And what
the purists may not realize is that
in their own way, Aykroyd and
Belushi are introducing a great
style of music to a group of
people who might otherwise
have spent their whole life listen
ing to Sammy Hagar and Pat
Tr avers.
1 guess Aykroyd put it best as
he and the rest of the band took a
final bow, "We're on a mission
from God," he said, "and the
mission is the music!"


Elwood and Jake — "the mission is the music"

Though not "authentic" blues musicians, Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi, as Jake and Elwood Blues,
put on a superb performance this weekend at the Concord Pavilion.
Dan Aykroyd and John Be
lushi were not raised as rhythm
and blues musicians.
For this reason, they have
come under some fire lately.
Blues purists claim that the two
actors are ripping off the public
in their act as Jake and Elwood
Blues, two Chicago bluesmen.
There are much better, and
perhaps more "real" blues musi
cians who should be getting the
recognition, the purists say; not
these two rich white boys.
And they're probably right.
The Blues Brothers are an act.
They're not for real. Their band,
probably the best one money
could buy. is just that — bought.
And their fans are mostly clean
cut white kids who live in places
like Piedmont and Atherton. not
Chicago's back streets.
But there comes a time in deal
ing with self-righteous purists
and/or experts in any field when
one must simply ask them to
"shut the hell up." If there were
ever a time to do so, this may be
it.
Aykroyd and Belushi have
embraced their Blues Brothers
act with such care and energy, it
shines like a freshy-polished
Cadillac. You have to sec them
in person to believe it; TV, re
cords and the movie just don't do
the trick.
The Blues Brothers were in

town last weekend, playing two
sold-out shows at the pleasant,
open-air Concord Pavilion. And
from their now famous opening
to their exuberant rendition of
"Soul Man." the show oozed en
tertainment. One might even go
so far as to call it "family enter
tainment," though Belushi's lan
guage is not exactly guarded, and
many of the songs contain rather
lurid lyrics.
Part of what makes the Blues
Brothers live show so Fun (with a
capital "F") is the fact that Ayk
royd and Belushi are very
talented showmen. The two
dance like nothing you ever saw,
combining some Charleston,
some jitterbug and some what
ever. In fact, one of the evening's
biggest surprises came when a
flickering strobe light was
switched on in the middle of one
of the Brothers' dances. Already
dressed in '40s clothing, the two
took on the look of Laurel and
Hardy in a jerky old motion pic
ture.
But beyond the Brothers'
mugging and the stage's Chicago
gas station set (complete with
regular gas listed at 27.9 cents).
