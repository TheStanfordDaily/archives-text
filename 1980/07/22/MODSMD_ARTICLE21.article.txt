## Skynyrd survivors make Freebird fly again 
### 
The spirit of Southern rock'n'roll
lives on. proud, strong and wail
ing. After a fiery plane crash
claimed the lives of Lynyrd
Skynyrd lead guitarist Steve
Gaines, lead singer Ronnie Van
Zant. and back-up singer Cassie
Gaines nearly three years ago,
most thought the survivors
would not go out on the road
again, perhaps to retire or con
tinue in separate bands. Most
thought the rebel spirit of
Lynyrd Skynyrd had died on that
Georgia mountainside.
Thursday night at San Francis
co's Fox Warfield Theatre, the
Rossington-Collins Band proved
them all wrong. And a rowdy
crowd of Bay-area Southern
rockers. waving Confederate
flags, was there to welcome them
back.
A thunderous standing ova
tion and rebel veils greeted lead
guitarists Gary Rossington and
Allen Collins, bassist Leon
Wilkeson, keyboardist Billy
Powell and new members Dale
Krantz, Barry Harwood and
Derek Hess. From their first
number, it was evident that these
Jacksonville boys still have one
of the hottest bands in rock.
As they launched into "Prime
Time" from their debut album
Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere,
the sell-out crowd was up and
dancing. Throughout their in
credibly tight one-and-a half
hour set, Rossington and Collins
allowed them very little time to
sit down. From the first, lead
singer Dale belted out some of
the strongest, bluesiest singing
that I've heard in a long time.
Starting off each tune with a per
sonal rap about the song, her
voice complemented the blues
rock stvle of Rossington-Collins

perfectly. In an interview early
this year. Allen Collins expres
sed the concern that a male
singer would find himself in the
position of copying Van Zant,
throwing himself open to com
parisons he couldn't possibly
meet. Krantz succeeded Thurs
day in blowing away the precon
ceptions of male-dominated
Southern rock. In the words of
Rossington. she's "one wailing
bitch." coming out best on the

slower blues numbers like
"Getaway" and "Three Times as
Bad."
Although it took a few songs
before the band was jamming to
gether, the interplay evoked the
best of Skynyrd three-guitar
rock. Barry Harwood. though
lacking the fire and intensity of
Steve Gaines, was an excellent
complement to Rossington's
soaring guitar work and plays an
incredibly mean slide. Collins

was content for the first half of
the set to stay back and play
rhythym. but when they broke
into "Winners and Losers," a
no-holds-barred rocker, all three
were out in front, jamming hard.
One of the finest moments of
the show came during that song,
when Rossington traded wailing
slide licks with Billy Powell's in
tricate blues runs on the piano.
Powell still plays one of the finest
honky-tonk pianos around.

Artimus Pyle's replacement
for this tour, drummer Derek
Hess, was the surprise of the
show.
Rossington-Collins came back
for one 2()-minute encore, a clas
sic rendidtion of "Freebird,"
which they dedicated to Ronny
Van Zant. Krantz and Harwood
left the stage as Collins and Ros
sington played a slow, bit
tersweet version without vocals.
And the Freebird lives on.
