## Four Tops-still strong after 26 years 
### 
1954: The Shah of Iran is sec
uring his political position after a
U.S.-backed coup put him in of
fice the previous year, the classic
lines of the 1956 Chevy are just
rough sketches on a designer's
drawing board, and The Four
Tops come together as a musical
group in Detroit.
1965: The Vietnam War and
peace-time draft escalate
beyond peace-time realities, the
Haight-Ashbury district of San
Francisco is boiling over with
creativity that will result in The
Jefferson Airplane, Grateful
Dead and Santana, and The Four
Tops begin their string of hits
with"Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch."
1980: Ronald Reagan sol
idifies his campaign for presi
dent. Bo Derek remains a 10,
and on day 260 of the Iranian
Hostage crisis (last Saturday),
The Four Tops play the Keys
tone Palo Alto.
As you can see, the world has
changed considerably since
1954, but then so have The Four
Tops to a certain extent. Levi

Stubbs. Abdul "Duke" Fakir,
Renaldo Benson and Lawrence
Payton came together as
recently-graduated high school
students in 1954 and have re
mained together as The Four
Tops ever since. They have
changed from what was probably
a loose singing group that sang
around the neighborhood to a
tight, choreographed unit with a
string of hits (their latest —
"Mac Arthur Park" in the mid
'70s).
As for the show itself, it
started late or at least it seemed
that way. The audience had to
wait nearly two hours to see the
Tops which included watching
the band set up, numerous mic
rophone checks and a comedian
named Clarence Sterling (who is
actually Phillipino) doing
reasonably good material with
an occasional bomb.
After one song by the band,
The Four Tops took the stage
and began a 55-minute musical
review of themselves as perfor
mers and as a group. They

opened with their 1973 single
"Ain't No Woman Like The One
I've Got" and wove their way
between the '60s and '70s with
"Baby, I Need Your Loving,"
"Main St.." "Bernadette," "Its
The Same Old Song," "Walk
Away, Renee" "Reach Out,"
"Standing in The Shadows of
Love" and "Sugar Pie, Honey
Bunch."
Like Marvin Gaye, Stevie
Wonder and The Supremes, The
Four Tops were part of the
Motown mid-'6os stable of ta
lent. Unlike their former col
leagues, they still reside in and
identify with the city of Detroit.
This may not seem like a major
point of interest, but it is actually
a profound statement on their
musical style and direction.
The state of soul and R&B
music has, like rock and roll,
been commercialized and incor
porated. Formula riffs,
computer-controlled writing
with an emphasis on down beat
and dance rhythms have become
a standard procedure. The result
has been the "Sound of Philly"
second generation, the many
mutations of disco and a general
blurring of the real emotions that
went into early R&B/soul music.
How else could one explain the
emergence of such groups as the

Blues Brothers? Not to take any
thing away from the Belushi/
Aykroyd team, but all they are
doing is cover versions of old
Sam & Dave/Otis Redding, et
al. songs. And this is where The
Four Tops fit in. They are one of
the few surviving artists that
have an orientation on the music
and lyrics of the song. It was
groups like The Four Tops that
Roger Daltrey and Pete
Townsend would listen to on the
record player after one of their
rehearsals. And the reason "for
this is that the message is univer
sal. There are feelings that are
transmitted in their records and
especially their performances
that can't be found in much of
our modern-day music.
If you could have heard lead
singer Levi Stubbs last Saturday
night, you would have heard
what I am talking about. In es
sence, The Four Tops have cho
sen not to go to L.A. or some
other music hub and remain true
to the roots that have meant so
much to so many. The Four Tops
played the Keystone Palo Alto
when the Isley Bros, play arenas
like the Oakland Colesium. All I
can say is, "So What?" The Isley
Bros, got rid of Jimi Hendrix as
their guitarist back in the mid
'6os, so what do they know?

rehearsals. And the reason "for
this is that the message is univer
sal. There are feelings that are
transmitted in their records and
especially their performances
that can't be found in much of
our modern-day music.
If you could have heard lead
singer Levi Stubbs last Saturday
night, you would have heard
what I am talking about. In es
sence, The Four Tops have cho
sen not to go to L.A. or some
other music hub and remain true
to the roots that have meant so
much to so many. The Four Tops
played the Keystone Palo Alto
when the Isley Bros, play arenas
like the Oakland Colesium. All I
can say is, "So What?" The Isley
Bros, got rid of Jimi Hendrix as
their guitarist back in the mid
'6os, so what do they know?
1954: The Shah of Iran is sec
uring his political position after a
U.S.-backed coup put him in of
fice the previous year, the classic
lines of the 1956 Chevy are just
rough sketches on a designer's
drawing board, and The Four
Tops come together as a musical
group in Detroit.
1965: The Vietnam War and
peace-time draft escalate
beyond peace-time realities, the
Haight-Ashbury district of San
Francisco is boiling over with
creativity that will result in The
Jefferson Airplane, Grateful
Dead and Santana, and The Four
Tops begin their string of hits
with"Sugar Pie, Honey Bunch."
1980: Ronald Reagan sol
idifies his campaign for presi
dent. Bo Derek remains a 10,
and on day 260 of the Iranian
Hostage crisis (last Saturday),
The Four Tops play the Keys
tone Palo Alto.
As you can see, the world has
changed considerably since
1954, but then so have The Four
Tops to a certain extent. Levi

Stubbs. Abdul "Duke" Fakir,
Renaldo Benson and Lawrence
Payton came together as
recently-graduated high school
students in 1954 and have re
mained together as The Four
Tops ever since. They have
changed from what was probably
a loose singing group that sang
around the neighborhood to a
tight, choreographed unit with a
string of hits (their latest —
"Mac Arthur Park" in the mid
'70s).
As for the show itself, it
started late or at least it seemed
that way. The audience had to
wait nearly two hours to see the
Tops which included watching
the band set up, numerous mic
rophone checks and a comedian
named Clarence Sterling (who is
actually Phillipino) doing
reasonably good material with
an occasional bomb.
After one song by the band,
The Four Tops took the stage
and began a 55-minute musical
review of themselves as perfor
mers and as a group. They

opened with their 1973 single
"Ain't No Woman Like The One
I've Got" and wove their way
between the '60s and '70s with
"Baby, I Need Your Loving,"
"Main St.." "Bernadette," "Its
The Same Old Song," "Walk
Away, Renee" "Reach Out,"
"Standing in The Shadows of
Love" and "Sugar Pie, Honey
Bunch."
Like Marvin Gaye, Stevie
Wonder and The Supremes, The
Four Tops were part of the
Motown mid-'6os stable of ta
lent. Unlike their former col
leagues, they still reside in and
identify with the city of Detroit.
This may not seem like a major
point of interest, but it is actually
a profound statement on their
musical style and direction.
The state of soul and R&B
music has, like rock and roll,
been commercialized and incor
porated. Formula riffs,
computer-controlled writing
with an emphasis on down beat
and dance rhythms have become
a standard procedure. The result
has been the "Sound of Philly"
second generation, the many
mutations of disco and a general
blurring of the real emotions that
went into early R&B/soul music.
How else could one explain the
emergence of such groups as the

Blues Brothers? Not to take any
thing away from the Belushi/
Aykroyd team, but all they are
doing is cover versions of old
Sam & Dave/Otis Redding, et
al. songs. And this is where The
Four Tops fit in. They are one of
the few surviving artists that
have an orientation on the music
and lyrics of the song. It was
groups like The Four Tops that
Roger Daltrey and Pete
Townsend would listen to on the
record player after one of their
rehearsals. And the reason "for
this is that the message is univer
sal. There are feelings that are
