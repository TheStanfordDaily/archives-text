# GOP conclave reconsidered

spent last week covering the
Republican National Conven
tion, and has returned with his
impressions.
DETROIT — "The Re
publican Party convenes,"
begins the preamble to the
1980 Republican platform,
"and selects its nominees at a
time of crisis. America is ad
rift. Our country moves
agonizingly, aimlessly, almost
helplessly into one of the
most dangerous and disor
derly periods in history."
As one member of the plat
form committee put it last
Tuesday, the second day of
the 1980 Republican ex
travaganza, "We are in grea
ter danger than we were the
day after Pearl Harbor."

News analysis

In a whirl of motions and
seconds directed toward an
end which surprised no one,
the Republican big-wigs es
poused the most conservative
rhetoric this country has
heard since the early sixties.
All week, the likes of Gerry
Ford, Howard Baker and
Don Rumsfeld strutted to the
podium, bolstered by the
moment, and lashed at Jimmy
Carter's tenure while flatten
ing the Soviet Union under
their theoretical thumbs.
Ford tore through his speech
like never before. He looked
forceful and at home as he
castigated the Carter ad
ministration, not at all like the
clumsy, stand-offish man we
remember from his White
House days.
After eight years of embar
rassment and vears of minor

ity status, the Republican
party seems to sense that the
time to take the reins back
from the Democrats could
very well be now. The coun
try's booming inflation,
foreign crises and growingly
conservative attitude seemed
to hang in the air above the
shouting so the speakers
could reach up and grab a
piece of criticism whenever
they needed it.
After all that time of hold
ing their rightist breath for
fear that someone might yell
out. 'Yeah, but what about
Richard Nixon,' the Republi
cans seemed confident and
enthusiastic to let the dam
break led by their new de
fense — 'What about Jimmy
Carter?'
All in all, though, after the
first few major speakers, the
speeches began to sound
pretty much the same.
Frankly, unless you were a
hard core Republican, the
convention was pretty boring.
But for the delegates. Detroit
was one big party. They loved
it.
In a maze of polyester,
shaded every tint of red,
white and blue, they sang,
drank, cheered and carried on
as if America had just won the
Great War, not as if it would
arm to prevent a new one. For
five blocks of Detroit river
front, they marched up and
down from the Renaissance
Center on one end to Joe
Louis on the other, covered
with buttons, fake straw hats
and those miniature Ameri
can flags stuck where ever
they could fit them. At first it
all looked more like an Ok
lahoma football weekend
than a national convention.
Americana at its finest.
