# Planning accelerated for new undergrad housing
## 
### Susie Blake Staff Writer 
The University's plans for
construction of a new dorm
proposed to house 800 under
graduates has been put on "fast
track" in an effort to minimize
time and curb inflationary costs,
according to Elizabeth Kitas, as
sociate project manager.
"Fast track" means speeding
up the processing of architec
tural plans and cost analysis so
that construction can begin as
soon as possible.
"One thing special about the
project is that inflation is a big
cost factor. The sooner it (the
dorm) gets built, the more
money you've saved," Kitas said.
The new dorm will increase
the University's ability to house
undergraduates from 82 to 8b
percent, leaving the remaining
14 percent to seek housing off
campus.

" The project is important be
cause the University's inability
to house undergraduates may
inhibit Stanford's ability to at
tract top students," said Mike
Charlson, a student member of
the planning committee.
The site for the new dorm is
west of Lagunita Court, and cur
rent architectural plans call for a
main complex built around a
center court, three independent
houses and three eating clubs.
The committee is now working
to achieve a balance between de
sign options and budgetary con
straints by reviewing particular
architectual aspects and con
struction materials. Present op
tions include putting in solar
panels, a red tile roof at an extra
cost, and deciding the si/c and
number of rooms to be built.
The current objective of the
dorm planning commitee is

completion of the schematic
stage of the project hv the end of
this summer, according to J;imes
Lyons, dean of student affairs.
The final architectual plans and
proposed construction costs will
then go to the Board of Trustees
for final approval in October.
The budget for the project,
originally set at $35 million, is
now estimated to cost between
$32 and $36 million and will be
funded primarily through tax
free loans from the California
Educational Facilities Administ
ration and student fees collected
from University housing, Lyons
said.
Lyons currently anticipates
that the trustees will approve
plans submitted by the project
committee and expects construc
tion to begin shortly after ap
proval is granted. Parts of the
dorm are scheduled to he ready
for occupancy by fall 1982.
