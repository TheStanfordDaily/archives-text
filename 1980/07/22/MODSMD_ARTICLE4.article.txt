# Protesters picket area post offices
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
Over 125 chanting, banner
waving anti-registration protes
ters marched on local post offices
yesterday as the first day of re
gistration for the military draft
got under way across the U.S.
In what was probably the
largest demonstration on the
Peninsula, organized by the
Mid-Peninsula Coalition to Re
sist Registration for the Draft,
the group marched through the
central business districts and in
front of die ccntral post offices ol
Menlo Park and Palo Alto.
Shouting slogans like: "B-l-G
O-I-L, Shell and Exxon go to
hell!," and"The people united,
can never be defeated!," some of
the group carried banners which
read "I didn't raise my son to be
a soldier," and "Keep Your
Hands Off the Youth of
America."
One demonstrator got his re
gistration card from the post of
fice in Palo Alto and then burned
it before the crowd, reminiscent
of draft card burning during the
'60s. During this registration,
however, registrants will not be
required to carry their cards with
them as they were during the
Vietnam era.
As the throng moved through
the streets, many passersby and
shoppers waved, and motorists
honked their horns in sympathy
with the protesters. Some joined
the march.
Outside the post office the
marchers formed pickets in front
of the doors, while inside, mem
bers of various anti-registration
groups talked to individuals in
tending to register.
Although there is a restriction
against counseling, aiding or
abetting non-registrants, which
comes with a stiff penalty — up
to five years in prison and a
$ I (),()()() line — this did not stop
a few people from trying to talk
the 19- and 20-year-olds out of
registering.
"There's a fine line between
having a discussion of beliefs and
actually encouraging people not
to register," said Claire Smith,
program chairperson for the Un
ited Nations Organization in the
Mid-Peninsula, "... in any
case, we must just be willing to
go to jail rather than to go to
war."
Yesterday, about 35 people
arrived at the Palo Alto post of
fice intending to register, but
only 10 ol them actually regis
tered. according to David Mills
tein. of People Against the Draft
and the War Resister's League.
No official statistics as to the
number of registrants have been
made available yet. however.
Referring to reports that re
gistration is progressing
smoothly. Millstein expressed
some doubts.
"It's really deceiving.
Everyone's saying, as on KCiO
tion and Answer" sheet designed
to clarify any problems that
might be raised by students con
cerning the implications of the
new legislation. He added his of
fice was not prepared to repre
sent students on an individual
basis.
Saying that although the fu
ture still "holds a lot of un
knowns," Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons commented

that he did not think the gov
ernment would go through the
expense and trouble of reactivat
ing draft registration unless there
were serious plans to put it to
use.
Lyons said that his office has
no present plans to provide draft
counseling as it did during the
Vietnam war. In the meantime
he advised students to obtain ac
curate information about regist
ration.
