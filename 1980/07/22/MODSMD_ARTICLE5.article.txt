## Chinese genetic control urged 
### Jay Mathews The Washington Post 
PEKING â€” Arguments have begun to surface in
the official Communist Partv newspaper. The
People's Daily, that propose controlled breeding of
Chinese people through laws prohibiting persons
with genetic detects, including color blindness,
from marrying or having children.
On June 8. the new spaper published an article by
a medical officer in l.iaoing Province saying. "We
have done very little to improve the qualitv of the
population." He said "necessary laws" were re
quired to keep those with "congenital diseases"
from producing children.
In a May 22 article, another expert, /hong
Huilan. said the mentally ill. hemophiliacs and the
color blind were a drain on society and"from the
point of view of genetics and eugenics, we should
gradually reduce their number." Eugenics is the
studv of human improvement by genetic control.

I he suggestions lack the authority of govern
ment edicts and are expected to incite resistance
and debate, but they indicate the extremes to which
many C hinese are willing to go to reduce a popula
tion nearing the billion mark.
I he abortion rate in China remains high, averag
ing 50 to 1 00 percent of the number of live births in
most communities visited by foreigners. Scattered
reports tell of mothers coming under heavy pres
sure from local officials to abort a third child.
Ihe strict rules of the birth control campaign,
and the communist role in it, could damage the
party's already shaky hold on public confidence.
Provincial authorities threaten severe economic
penalties tor young couples who produce more
than one child. Prospective parents have confessed
to tears that the single offspring allowed them may
have some defect. To many Chinese determined to
continue the family name, this defect may include
simply being female.
