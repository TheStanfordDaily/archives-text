# Marxist Afghan regime purged
## 
### Tyler Marshall The Los Angeles Times 
NEW DELHI. India â€” A
long-expected purge of the be
leaguered Marxist regime in Af
ghanistan is under way, appa
rentl> aimed at strengthening
President Babrak Karmal's per
sonal power. Afghan observers
said yesterday.
A major government reor
ganization. announced Sunday,
coupled with a string of new
senior government appoint
ments and the tone of Karmal's
recent speeches are all cited by
analysts here as evidence that the
purge has begun.
It appears to be aimed at

crushing opposition to Karma I
trom within the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanis
tan. While appearing to be an
endorsement of the man the
Soviets placed in power billow
ing their invasion in late De
cember, the purge also repre
sents a major Soviet policy set
back in the strife-torn country.
I he Soviets had previously
tried to force two warring fac
tions within the ruling party to
work together under karmal in
an eltort to broaden its precari
ously thin popular base.
But the two factions concen
trated more on destroying each
other than on confronting the
growing rebel insurgency, which
has brought the business of gov
ernment to a virtual standstill in
most areas outside the capital of
Kabul.
Members of one faction,
known as Khalqis (masses), who
were loyal to Afghanistan's first
Marxist president, Nur
Mohammad Taraki and his ruth
less successor Hafizullah Am in.
have been actively trying to un
dermine Karmal and his smaller,
more intellectually grounded
band of followers of the Parcham
(flag) group. Both take their

names from the title of newspap
ers they once published.
The fractious nature ot Afghan
politics, which prevents like
minded groups from working to
gether even in times of crisis, has
helped make Afghanistan so dif
ficult to rule through most of its
history and virtually impossible
for conquerers to subdue. The
same deep divisions that plague
the Kabul regime are also
characteristic of the insurgents
working to overthrow the gov
ernment and expel the Soviets.
Those familiar with the Af
ghan situation say it is impossible
to predict how widespread the
purge might be. but it is certain
to further narrow the regime's
political support.
It is estimated that a maximum
of about 75,000 of A fghanistan's
17 million people belong to the
People's Democratic Party and
that at least two-thirds of them
are Khalqis.
The first hint that the Soviets
abandoned efforts to impose
party unity came last month
when Kabul Radio announced
the execution of 13 former
senior People's Democratic
Party members. All 13 were
Khalqis.
