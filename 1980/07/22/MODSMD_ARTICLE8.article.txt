PARIS â€” Former Syrian
Premier Salah Eddin Bitar, the
most prominent Syrian opposi
tion leader in Western Europe,
was assassinated here yesterday
hy a lone gunman who shot him
in the back of the neck with a
silencer-equipped pistol as he
was unlocking his office.
Several veteran Western stu
dents of the Palestine Liberation
Organization scoffed at the idea
as a bizarre attempt to throw in
vestigators off the track. The
PLO vigorously denied the story.
The same observers took seri
ously. however, the suggestion
that the hard-pressed regime of
Syrian President Hafez Assad
was behind the slaying of a man
who had come to be the leading

symbol of democratic opposition
to an increasingly repressive
government.
Bitar, 68, was by far the best
known leader of a group of
exiled opposition forces that had
begun about six months ago to
overcome their differences and
to organize themselves here into
a broad multi-religious National
Front against the Assad govern
ment based on the small Alanite
Moslem sect. The government
directed Damascus press had
been publishing generalized
threats against the Front for
some time. The assassination of
Bitar, said a Western diplomatic
observer, is "a sign of the desp
eration of the regime."
By yesterday evening, no one
had claimed credit for the killing
of Bitar, however.
