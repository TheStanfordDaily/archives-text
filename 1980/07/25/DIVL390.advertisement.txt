We have been fold by the President that draff registration is being
instituted to indicate our resolve in the face of Soviet aggression. We
fear that new potential Viet Nams are in the making. We do not
believe that our young people should be pawns in the game of
Presidential politics, or that they should provide an ever ready pool for
massive military adventures in the developing countries. We support
those of you who are in non-violent opposition to the draft.
