# Clark condemns draft, presidential opponents
## 
### Liz Rosner Staff Writer 
"If you have to register for the
draft, then register for the vote
â€” vote Libertarian." So read
one of the many slogans dis
played at yesterday's rally in
front of the post office, where Ed
Clark, Libertarian presidential
candidate, held a noon press con
ference.
Clark, campaigning in the Bay
area, voiced his support for pro
tests against the draft registra
tion in a brief speech to the
crowd of around 100 Stanford
summer students, visitors and
local residents.
Stanford Against Conscrip
tion members and Clark suppor
ters marched together in a
picket-line, moving past the

side-hy-side tables promoting
Libertarians and SAC.
Local Libertarian candidates
Bill Evers, running in the 12th
Congressional District race, and
Chuck Olson, running for the
21 st Assembly District seat, also
joined the picketers.
Clark stressed his party's view
of the draft as a modern form of
slavery.
"Opposition to the draft
strikes a great blow for liberty,"
Clark said, and made a pledge to
the crowd:
"If elected, I will pardon
everyone imprisoned or fined in
connection with opposition to
registration or the draft."
Clark has been a full-time
presidential candidate since July
1 and said his platform offers an
alternative to Reagan, Carter
and Anderson.
"Anderson's policies are in
distinguishable from the other
two," Clark said. "The two
party system is crumbling, and
this is a great opportunity for the
Libertarians as a third party."
One of Clark's proposals to
tackle the nation's economic
problems is a major tax cut, and
he also advocates abolition of the
Department of Energy as a key
step toward alleviating energy
problems and reducing depen
dence on foreign oil.

The main theme of the Liber
tarian platform revolves around
the principle of non
intervention, in terms of both
foreign and domestic policy. The
Libertarians perceive the draft as
governmental intervention in
personal freedom, and similarly
want to see the end of a foreign
policy of involvement in the in
ternal affairs of other nations.
"The perceived shift (in sen
timent) in the U.S. is a shift away
from government interven
tion. . . . There is a growing nos
talgia for the past, and we (Liber
tarians) share that nostalgia,"
Clark said.
"If we had the right foreign
policy, we would not need more
people in the armed forces. . . .
The problems of the draft are all
attributable to Jimmy Carter's
actions, which are someplace be
tween idiocy and criminality."
Clark also warned the crowd
of the Vietnam-era overtones of
the draft registration. "Compul
sory registration for the draft will
have the same or worse effects as
in the 19605."
A group of SAC members
acted out a pantomime version
of the registration procedure fol
lowing Clark's speech. They por
trayed registration as a prelude
to draft and war, with some of
the participants wearing postal
and army uniforms.
