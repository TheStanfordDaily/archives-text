# Bethlehem admits bribery
## 
### Martha Hamilton The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Bethlehem Steel Corp.
pleaded guilty yesterday to an elaborate scheme in
which it padded nearly $2 million onto shipowners
bills to raise bribe money to win lucrative repair
contracts.
The scheme operated over a five-year period
and tunneled part of the money through a phony
Swiss corporation.
The giant shipbuilding corporation pleaded
guilty to ten felony counts of a criminal information
filed yesterday morning in U.S. District Court in
New York. Although the Justice Department
acknowledged that it does not intend to charge any
office, employee or agent of Bethlehem in connec
tion with the investigation, the company itself
could be liable for a $518,000 fine.
Papers filed in court yesterday left open the pos
sibility that those who accepted the bribes might be
charged.
From 1972 to 1976, the company paid ship

owners' representatives more than $4(X),(XX) in bribes
to throw ship repair business to Bethlehem and to
help get payments expedited. Bethlehem has ship
repair yards in Baltimore; Beaumont, Texas; Bos
ton; Hoboken, N.J.; San Francisco and San Pedro.
Calif.
Nothing in the papers filed in courts yesterday
precludes possible prosecution of individuals who
accepted the bribes. The Justice Department also
held open the possibility of subsequent criminal
prosecution of individuals if additional information
arises. It also said it may prosecute anyone in
volved in the scheme for embezzlement or theft of
funds from Bethlehem.
The bribe money was raised by adding commis
sions for Offis pour le Financement du Commerce
et de I'lndustrie S.A. (OFCI) of Our, Switzerland,
which purportedly acted as Bethlehem's ship
repair sales agent, or by submitting false invoices
for materials never received and services never
rendered. The commissions, ranging from 1.5 per
cent to 6.5 percent, were added into totals in in
voices sent to shipowners.
