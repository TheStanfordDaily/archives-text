# Gas allocation badly flawed

WASHINGTON â€” The fed
eral government's system of al
locating gasoline during emergen
cies is badly flawed and could not
prevent another outbreak of the
service station lines that plagued
motorists during shortages last
spring and summer, federal offi
cials and outside experts said
yesterday.
Hampered by poor planning
and bad management, the De
partment of Energy responds
poorly to emergencies. Com
ptroller General Elmer Staats

told the investigations subcom
mittee of the Senate Gov
ernmental Operations Commit
tee.
Staats heads the General Ac
counting Office, the investiga
tive arm of Congress, which has
issued 24 reports in the past six
years directly or indirectly
criticizing the government's fai
lure to prepare for energy
emergencies.
The government's gasoline
regulatory plan is "a miserable
and very controversial prog
ram,'' acknowledged Hazel Rol
lins. who as economic regulatory

administrator for the Depart
ment of Energy, administers the
complex rules that govern
gasoline distribution.
The current distribution sys
tem is based on past usage, and
critics argue that, as a result, it
can't respond to crises. Stations
in rural and tourist areas had
plenty of gasoline during last
summer's crisis because people
were afraid to leave the cities tor
weekend and vacation driving.
Staying in the urban areas, driv
ers exhausted the local supplies
and generated lines at service
stations.
