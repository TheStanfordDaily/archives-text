# Curfew ordered in Chattanooga

CHATTANOOGA. Tenn. -
A citywide curfew was ordered
yesterday in an effort to put a lid
on racial trouble in the streets,
but a black leader called it a
"Band-Aid approach."
Black leaders said the curfew
order by Mayor Charles "Pat"
Rose may dissipate the unrest lor
now. but won't deal with the un
derlying causes — distress over
unemployment and tenant com
plaints about the quality of city
housing.
Violence broke out Tuesday
after an all-white jury acquitted
two Ku Klux Klansmcn and con
victed a third on reduced assault
charges in the April 19 shotgun
shootings of four black women.
Rose told city commissioners
he is ordering all retail busines
ses — including gasoline sta
tions, restaurants and theaters —
to close from 9:30 p.m. to 5:30
a.m.
A 14-member coalition of
black organizations called Wed
nesday for the Justice Depart
ment to investigate the 12 jurors

and the records of the five-day
trial. The Justice Department al
ready has directed the FBI to in
vestigate the shootings to see
whether there were any civil
rights violations.
Firebombings, rock and bottle
throwing and attempts to set
fires had kept officials busy for
the past two nights. Injuries have
been few. but the fires have
damaged two warehouses, a re
staurant and stores.
George Key, Chattanooga
chapter president of the National
Association for the Advance
ment of Colored People, said the

curfew is, by itself, inadequate.
"My reaction to it is this is only
a Band-Aid over a festering
sore," Key said in a telephone
interview. "It won't do any good
to run the problems under
ground."
The Criminal Court jury on
Tuesday acquitted William
Church, 23, who calls himself
imperial wizard of the Justice
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
and member Larry Payne, 26. of
four counts each of assault with
intent to commit murder which
resulted in bodily injury.
