## Olympics political 
### 
The 22nd Olympiad opened
last Saturday in Moscow,
neither unscathed nor
paralyzed by the absence of
some 31 nations led by the
United States. But more sig
nificant than the immediate
impact of President Jimmy
Carter's Olympic boycott is
the political nature of interna
tional athletic competition
which it affirms.
Admittedly, politics has
always pervaded the Olym
pics. Participants in the origi
nal Greek games proudly rep
resented their states, just as
contestants today compete
under the banners of their
countries. Since the revival of
the Olympics in this century,
however, politics has in
fringed upon the realm of
sports in more than just a pat
riotic way. Athletic victory is
no longer attributed to the in
dividual for superior ability,
training and effort. Winning
now connotes a better way of
life and. hence, is used to en
dorse political systems.
A long string of examples,
occurring with accelerated
frequency over the last four
Olympics, is available to up
hold that claim. Adolf Hitler
manipulated the 1932 Berlin
Olympics to display the gran
deur and success of Nazi
Germany. At Mexico City in
1968, black Americans first
threatened to boycott be
cause South Africa was not
barred from the games. Then,
Tommie Smith and John Car
los, the gold and bronze
medal winners respectively in
the 200-meter dash, defiantly
raised their gloved hands in
the black power salute on the
victory platform. The two
were expelled from further
competition by the Interna
tional Olympic Committee.
The political warfare really
broke out at the 1972 Munich
Olympics. Starting things off,
Rhodesia was refused entr
ance to the games. Next,
frighteninely worse, 1 1 Is

raelis were murdered by
Palestinian terrorists. The
guerrillas' ri?id on the
"politically-neutral" Olym
pic Village stunned the world,
but did not shock the lOC
into changing its policies. In
stead. the traditional sporting
atmosphere of the Olympics
is now stifled by legions of
police and stringent security
measures.
Finally, the black African
nations boycotted the last
Olympics, and Carter's latest
maneuver has turned the
Olympics into a blatant polit
ical tool.
U.S. athletes, many who
had envisioned this Olympics
as a life-long goal, had little
choice but to comply with Car
ter's order. The U.S. Olympic
Committee's hands were
politically tied by an ambiti
ous executive.
We see Carter's symbolic
gesture as precisely that: an
empty political move with lit
tle substantive effect beyond
the damage inflicted upon the
hopes of our athletes. The
lack of worldwide television
coverage and the shortage of
spectators has deprived the
Soviets of their "testimonial
to worldwide acceptance of
Soviet foreign policy." Yet, it
has not persuaded them to
loosen their grip on Afghanis
tan.
We also view the Olympic
appearance of Yassar Arafat,
the kingpin behind the
Munich deaths, and the deten
tion of Western journalists as
abominations of the Olympic
ideal. Politics will breed poli
tics.
As long as the lOC refuses
to recognize the inherent
political nature of the
present-day Olympics, the
games will continue to be
plundered by political machi
nations. Unless the
nationalisic format of the
Olympics is modified, the
lOC's pursuit of non-aligned
athleticexcellence will perish.
