## Anderson cloned from Carter 
### 
Reading in the paper of Jimmy
Carter's recent statement that
the 1976 debate was pivotal in
getting him elected touched me
with a deep sense of betrayal.
Four years ago as a college
freshman I, like many others,
lost my heart to Jimmy Who's vis
ion of an America run by a gov
ernment "as good as its people."
Recently I reviewed some
clippings from old newspapers to
reconfirm my impression of the
central thrust of Jimmy Carter's
debate with Gerald Ford.
He argued, quite convincingly
I still believe, that a government
charged with the moral impera

tive of being as good as its people
should not resort to unemploy
ment to fight inflation and play
politics as usual with the federal
treasury.
Yet Carter has elevated the
doling out of federal money for
primary campaign purposes to a
fine art and has embraced the
economic policy that got Ford
voted out of office: fighting infla
tion with unemployment.
In this not so best of all possi
ble worlds I'm willing to accept a
politician occasionally reneging
on a campaign promise. How
ever, if President Carter is not to
be held accountable for his

wholesale abandonment of the
entire 1976 populist platform of
his campaign, then why bother
having elections at all?
It is probably the supreme
irony of the 1980 campaign that
the more Carter comes to re
semble what Ted Kennedy calls a
"Ronald Reagan clone" the
more John Anderson comes to
resemble a Jimmy Carter clone
circa 1976.
His self-description as a fiscal
conservative and social liberal
sounds hauntingly familiar. Yet I
still find it appealing.
Perhaps being supposedly
older and wiser, alarm bells
should go off in my head when a
Playboy interviewer criticizes
Anderson for sounding like
Jimmy Carter promising not to
lie to us. Yet it was an interesting
study in contrasts recently bet
ween Carter's call (undoubtedly
politically motivated) for Ram
sey Clark's prosecution and John
Anderson's courageous call for
an impartial investigation of
CIA-SAVAK torture links.
Similarly, whereas Carter
flip-flopped his way to the 1976
Democratic nomination, Ander
son has not shied away from tak
ing hard stands on issues such as
Iran.
In the final analysis then I still
believe in Carter's social liberal,
fiscal conservative 1976 prom
ises. Maybe John Anderson is
the man to fulfill them.
