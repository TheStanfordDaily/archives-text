## Non-registrants may get off free

On Friday, July 18, a special
three-judge federal court ruled
unanimously that the Selective
Service Act is unconstitutional
because it excludes women. The
Selective Service Act is the basis
for President Carter's authority
to order 19- and 20-year-old
men to register for the draft.
The Justice Department is ap
pealing the ruling to the Sup
reme Court, and if the Court ag
rees to hear the case a decision
may be expected sometime in
1981.
The ruling enjoined the gov
ernment from proceeding with
its plan to begin registration on
July 21. However, on July 19,
Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan granted a government
request to stay the injunction
until the whole Supreme Court
can rule on the case. Brennan's
action means that the govern

ment can proceed with its regist
ration plans.
Clearly the most important
question facing someone who
contemplates not registering is
whether the Justice Department
will be able to successfully prose
cute anyone who fails to register
before the Supreme Court rules
in 1981.
Here are some opinions:
Donald L. Weinberg (attorney
for the plaintiffs): "Registration
will be entirely voluntary, be
cause the government cannot
prosecute those who choose not
to register under an unconstitu
tional law." (New York Times,
7/19)
Charles R. Nesson (associate
dean of the Harvard Law
School): "For young men who
choose to delay registration it
would be very defensible that
there is a court's declaration that
the law is unconstitutional,
against a stay merely postpon
ing a final rule. . . . The Gov
ernment would have difficulty
showing criminal intent if it
chose to prosecute nonregis
trants." (New York Times, 7/20)
On Saturday the New York
Times itself took a position close
to that expressed by Weinberg:
" Even if a Justice of the Supreme

Court should grant a stay . . . the
three-judge panel's nullification
of the draft statute means that
registration will be without force
of law, because the special
court's ruling that the law was
unconstitutional cannot be
stayed." (New York Times, 7/19)
However, by Sunday the
Times was taking a more neutral
position: "Some lawyers ques
tioned the practical effect of the
justice's stay, contending that
the Justice Department would be
hard put to prosecute a young
man for failing to register while
the constitutional issue is pend
ing before the Supreme Court."
(New York Times, 7/20)
If it is possible to distill these
conflicting opinions into one sen
tence of advice on the constitu
tionality issue, it would probably
be something like this: If you de
cide to postpone registration
until after the Supreme Court
rules in 1981, on the ground that
the most authoritative interpre
tation of the Selective Service
Act is that the Act is unconstitu
tional, then you will have a pretty
good case if you are ever prose
cuted.
