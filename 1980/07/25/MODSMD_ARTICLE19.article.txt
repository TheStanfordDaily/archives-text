Anderson flip-flops
It is disturbing that a person
majoring in philosophy would
engage in evasion of the facts and
distortion of ordinary language;
yet, in her criticism (Daily, July
11) of my column on John An
derson, Patricia Rose does just
that.
Rose does not refute or deny a
single fact stated in my column
— Anderson's recent frighten
ingly militaristic statements on
the Mideast and Cuba, his firm
support for the draft during the
Nixon years, etc.
Instead, she simply an
nounces, ex cathedra, that "An
derson has been entirely consis
tent with himself."
When we last had a draft, An
derson strongly supported it;
now he poses as an anti-draft
candidate. Anderson pretends to
be an anti-nuclear candidate; yet
his record shows a strong and de
termined support for special
privileges for the nuclear power
industry.
Is this Rose's definition of
"consistent?"

Rose exemplifies the pseudo
religious fervor to which I refer
red in my column: she refuses to
allow her faith in Anderson to be
disturbed by the facts.
As Rose implies, I do indeed
agree with Anderson on some
particular issues — ERA,
legalized abortions, etc. I am
worried less by his current posi
tions (which can hardly be much
worse than Carter'sor Reagan's)
than by his eagerness to reverse a
position whenever he judges
such a reversal to be politically
expedient.
What is frightening about
John Anderson is his utter con
tempt for the voting public, his
belief that whatever his inconsis
tencies and flip-flops on the is
sues, his supporters will continue
to view him as forthright, princi
pled, and consistent: in Rose's
case, that belief is evidently jus
tified.
Contrary to Rose's argument,
Anderson offers us not simple
rationality but only simple de
magoguery.
