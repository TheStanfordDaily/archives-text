WASHINGTON (AP) â€”The
Senate created a nine-member
panel yesterday to investigate
Billy Carter's links with Libya's
radical Arab government and to
determine whether the White
House influenced a Justice De
partment investigation of the
president's younger brother.
The committee will "pursue
the truth wherever the truth may
lead," said Sen. Birch Bayh (D-
Ind.), chairman of the new panel.
Billy Carter registered as a
foreign agent on June 14, under
pressure from the Justice De
partment. He has acknowledged
receiving $220,000 from Libya,
which he described as an install
ment on a $500,000 loan. Ad
ministration and Libyan oficials
deny that he acted as an agent of
that government, however.
The Carter administration has
denied influencing the Justice
Department decision not to pro
secute thepresident's brother for
his initial failure to register as an
agent of the Libyan government.
The agreement creating the
Senate panel directs it to look into
"activities relating to individuals
representing the interests of
foreign governments."
It does not name Billy Carter.
