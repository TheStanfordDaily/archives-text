Acarya Krtashivananda Av
adhuta, general secretary of
Prout Universal, spoke July
17 on Prout (Progressive
Utilization theory) and how its
ideals are needed in Western soc
iety.
Prout is a philosophical con
cept that preaches the path to
spiritual fulfillment through
Tantric yoga.
Unlike other Indian
philosophy imports, Prout em
braces the material world. It is a
socioeconomic philosophy which
believes the industrialized soci
ety and mankind in general are
part of the process of attaining
true spiritual freedom. The pro
cess is a synthesis of the world's
physical, mental and spiritual re
sources and the maximum utili
zation of those resources.
Prout was founded on the writ
ings of Indian philosopher P.R.
Sarkar. The movement began in
1959 as an alternative to the
politics of India, which appeared
despotic and uncaring to the dis
illusioned Indians.
This revolt against established
tyranny was expounded by
Krtashivananda in his speech.
He drew parallels from through
out Western history, and said
that all new movements were at
tempts by humans to win back
their desire to seek true freedom
from the few who wielded
power, such as Christianity
against the Roman Empire;
Adam Smith and capitalism
against the Third Estate, and
Marx against capitalism.
Prout wants to help human be
ings "back to finding freedom,
true freedom," which

Krtashivananda said, "is the
power to control desires, not the
power to do what one wants to."
Prout believes in the utiliza
tion of technology because it be
lieves that the three aspects of
man are linked and science is a
potential asset to life,
Krtashivananda added.
All individual expression is
encouraged and social freedom
is by the successive elimination
of obstructions to spiritual free
dom. "But," he warns, "when
social freedom becomes the goal,
it too becomes an obstruction."
To obtain utilization of the
world's resources, Prout wants
one human society, and, since it
has its feet squarely on terra
firma, it will attain this by having
a world government.
This government would be
based, according to the general
secretary, on a common
philosophy, a common constitu
tion, a common penal code —
based on human values, not
materialistic considerations —
and the minimum requirements
of life available as a right and not
a privilege — these being
employment, consummable
goods and price controls.
Krtashivananda claims that
this Prout-Utopia would not be
imposed, but he did not rule out
revolutionary force as a means of
attaining this society.
The world would be divided
into self-sufficient regions, based
on local resources — the United
States, for example, would be
come 30-40 such regions.
"Prout will help the human
being to destroy the Frankens
tein that he has built," said
Krtashivananda.
