"Orwellian." It's a word that
has become as familiar to us as
"neurotic." We bandy it about
with an ever-diminishing aware
ness of what it means or where it
came from. George Orwell — his
writings, his mystique — has
been assimilated into the miasma
of popular culture and history,
leaving many complex realities
to languish in a murky past. Or
well: The Transformation seeks
out those realities in an effort to
recreate and understand the real
Orwell. This is the final volume

in a collaborative effort that
began with Journey to the Fron
tier (1966) and continued with
The Unknown Orwell (1972).
The series examines the effects
of the Spanish Civil War on three
British writers of the 1930s —
John Cornford, Julian Bell, and
George Orwell.
There is, in a certain sense,
very little to say about this book.
It is a chronicle, not an argu
ment, and as such arouses
neither violent disagreement nor
fanatical sympathy. Stansky and
Abrahams have written what
seems to me an essentially trans
parent book, one that examines
the specifics of Orwell's life as
primary and his writing as a func
tion of those specifics.
It is transparent for two
reasons: first, because of the
prose itself — effortless, grace
ful, and unfailingly clear; and
second, because of the authors'
decided bias toward reportage
rather than interpretation.
While Orwell: The Transfor
mation is not provocative, it is
anything but boring, didactic, or
mindless. The book is extremely
readable. In the absence of vig
orous editorializing, Stansky and
Abrahams have subtly informed
these pages with a feel for the
man that acknowledges the facts
of his life and simultaneously
transcends them. This is what
biography is all about; at once
knowing the facts and piecing
them together in a way that lends
the portrait a sort of authentic
vitality.
What this means in practical

terms is that a lot of people can
and should read this book. It is
not a ponderous academic
treatise hut an unexpectedly en
grossing study of a man who de
mands the serious attention of
anyone seeking to understand
the modern West.
Since Stansky and Abrahams
hold the spotlight exclusively
and consistently on Orwell, it's
perhaps fair to look beyond the
book (or, more accurately,
through it) to Orwell himself.
What the authors have done
thematically is to trace the evolu
tion of the synthetic Orwell. We
remember George Orwell, if we
remember him at all, as a bleak
prophet, as an acute political
consciousness, and as an artist.
His greatness sprang from an
ability to fuse these often skewed

elements of personality into a
powerful style and message. Yet
he was not always such a mature
force. By exploring Orwell's in
tellectual and artistic origins,
Stansky and Abrahams attempt
to show how Eric Blair (his real
name) grew into the George Or
well of popular history.
Orwell embarked on his liter
ary career with a curiously bifur
cated sensibility. He desired, on
the one hand, massive social re
form: he burned with outrage
against the degradation of the
poor and the evils of industrial
capitalism. Even his earliest
books (especially Down and Out
and The Road to Wigan Pier) re
veal this profound indignation.
His passionate interest in these
issues never waned, and found
expression even in his late mas

terworks, Animal Farm and
1984.
On the other hand, Orwell also
wanted to write works of art: he
sought a reputation as a novelist,
not as a political crusader. He
planned to write a novel a year,
but though he met his quota for a
while, the struggle to produce art
grew increasingly burdensome.
As Stansky and Abrahams indi
cate, his was not a powerful crea
tive imagination. His "artisitic"
novels were based closely on
events of his own life, a limited
source that soon left him strap
ped for fresh material.
This odd unease — the par
tially repressed strife between
social reformist instincts de
manding vent and a determina
tion to produce art — pervades
Orwell's early work. Orwell set

his literary house in order as
a result of his experiences in the
Spanish Civil War. Here, we are
told, Orwell finally apprehended
something of the reality of
socialism, a doctrine he'd em
braced some time previously but
never precisely understood. His
political naivete began to give way
to realism, and his cynicism was
brought into sharper focus. This,
in short, was the "transforma
tion;" the forging of George Or
well from the disparate shards of
a literary schizophrenia.
Stansky and Abrahams don't
altogether succeed in explaining
this metamorphosis. Their affin
ity for narrating rather than
analyzing becomes, in the final
chapters, a hindrance. One
senses that something is happen-
ing to Orwell over the last sixty
pages, but Stansky and Ab
rahams afford but dim glimpses
of exactly what. Perhaps this is as
it should be; the book is, after
all, a biograpy, not a definitive
explanation. And despite my
mild bewilderment, I admire the
author's restraint in not offering
analysis beyond what the evi
dence supports.
This possible blemish is the
only real complaint against the
book. For anyone who has read
anything by Orwell (and that
should include just about
everyone), Orwell: The Trans
formation should prove both
highly accessible and genuinely
enlightening.
