## Chilling psychological thriller 
### 
Innocent Blood
P.D. James
Charles Scribner's
Sons
311 pps. $10.95
Anyone who has cherished
modern detective fiction has
heard the name P.D. James.
With her latest opus, Innocent
Blood, Ms. James has tried to
break out of the detective mold
and into the open novel. Consid
ering the tension and suspense
engendered by Innocent Blood,
she may have failed. Her pro
tagonist, Philippa Rose Palfrey,
sets out to discover the identity
of her natural parents and falls
into a psychological morass
foreshadowed by the reluctance
of her adoptive parents, Maurice
and Hilda, to encourage her
search. The book is less than
satisfying in its conclusion, yet it
holds the reader in respectful
thrall because of the masterful
characterizations which nearly
dominate the plot.
No character, however briefly
introduced or however minor,
is allowed to remain two
dimensional. The reader is
guaranteed to find fault with the
most favorable characters and to
find worth in the most despicable
ones. It is this point
counterpoint of psychological
types that lends complexity to a
plot which cannot otherwise rival
the suspense of certain other
James works such as Death of an
Expert Witness.
James' writing style makes
clever use of intricate metaphors
and literary imagery to delight
the most literate of readers. The
protagonist, Philippa, is said to
have presented herself to the
world "with self-conscious art,
daily remaking herself in her
own image." Of her adoptive pa
rents, Philippa states, "1 don't
think they love me. But we suit
each other on the whole. That's
more convenient, I imagine, than
living with people that you love
but don't suit." As she travels to

the London suburb where her
natural parents once lived, she
notes the drab urban sprawl
"from which sprang a tangle of
television aerials, frail crooked
fetishes against the evil eye."
James once more makes refer
ence to ancient superstitions
when describing a character's re
luctance to pronounce his happi
ness. "How early he must have
learned that primeval lesson, the
distrust of joy. Touch wood,
cross fingers, light a candle,
please God don't notice that I'm
happy." Hesitant to give voice to
her need for parental love, the
protagonist says of her mother,
"when she was there she was
more there than anyone I've ever
known."
Perhaps the most difficult part
of reviewing this book is the ex-

pression of a peculiar love-hate
attraction the reader feels to
ward the three main characters.
All are understandable, even
when their crimes are heinous.
The characters use each other,
lie, cheat and dream of revenge.
It is despite, or perhaps because
of this that we find them so ines
capably human. We are left with
a bad taste in our mouths, and no
convenient mouthwash of disbe
lief or hatred to separate us from
their folly.
When Philippa Palfrey finally
receives her original birth certifi
cate, she notes the address and
sets off in search of information
concerning her natural parents.
Neighbors inform her, in brutal
fashion, that her parents raped
and murdered a neighborhood

child ten years before. Her
father, Martin Ducton, died in
prison, and her mother, Mary
Ducton, has served ten years.
Philippa's carefully nourished
fantasy of a perfect, if forgotten,
childhood crumbles in the face of
the cold truth.
Eventually she comes to the
realization that whatever her
mother's crime, she must recon
cile her own memories/fantasies
with the reality embodied in
Mary Ducton, late of Melcombe
Grange prison. Philippa ar
ranges for the release of her
mother into her custody, and lo
cates an apartment for them in
the London suburbs.
The suspense begins with the
simultaneous retirement of an
aging civil servant who is deter
mined to avenge his daughter's

'How early he must have earned that primeval les
son, the distrust of joy. Touch wood, cross fingers,
light a candle, please God don't notice that Tm
happy.'

rape and murder. He discovers
Philippa's identity and then her
current address. The ensuing
surveillance and climax are truly
worthy of the P.D. James tradi
tion. Shock and after-shock are
dealt out with consummate skill.
It is the final chapter which
leaves one most disturbed. Some
readers may find it psychologi
cally acceptable; others may not.
In any case, the preceding 300
pages are well worth the asking
price of the book. James' style is
magnificent in its determined
probing of the dark recesses of
the human psyche. You'll prob
ably find yourself boring your
friends with innumerable quotes
from this chilling psychological
thriller.

Perhaps the most difficult part
of reviewing this book is the ex-

pression of a peculiar love-hate
attraction the reader feels to
ward the three main characters.
All are understandable, even
when their crimes are heinous.
The characters use each other,
lie, cheat and dream of revenge.
It is despite, or perhaps because
of this that we find them so ines
capably human. We are left with
a bad taste in our mouths, and no
convenient mouthwash of disbe
lief or hatred to separate us from
their folly.
When Philippa Palfrey finally
receives her original birth certifi
cate, she notes the address and
sets off in search of information
concerning her natural parents.
Neighbors inform her, in brutal
fashion, that her parents raped
and murdered a neighborhood

child ten years before. Her
father, Martin Ducton, died in
prison, and her mother, Mary
Ducton, has served ten years.
Philippa's carefully nourished
fantasy of a perfect, if forgotten,
childhood crumbles in the face of
the cold truth.
Eventually she comes to the
realization that whatever her
mother's crime, she must recon
cile her own memories/fantasies
with the reality embodied in
Mary Ducton, late of Melcombe
Grange prison. Philippa ar
ranges for the release of her
mother into her custody, and lo
cates an apartment for them in
the London suburbs.
The suspense begins with the
simultaneous retirement of an
aging civil servant who is deter
mined to avenge his daughter's

son, the distrust of joy. Touch wood, cross fingers,
light a candle, please God don't notice that Tm

rape and murder. He discovers
Philippa's identity and then her
current address. The ensuing
surveillance and climax are truly
worthy of the P.D. James tradi
tion. Shock and after-shock are
dealt out with consummate skill.
It is the final chapter which
leaves one most disturbed. Some
readers may find it psychologi
cally acceptable; others may not.
In any case, the preceding 300
pages are well worth the asking
price of the book. James' style is
magnificent in its determined
probing of the dark recesses of
the human psyche. You'll prob
ably find yourself boring your
friends with innumerable quotes
from this chilling psychological
thriller.

Innocent Blood
P.D. James
Charles Scribner's
Sons
311 pps. $10.95
Anyone who has cherished
modern detective fiction has
heard the name P.D. James.
With her latest opus, Innocent
Blood, Ms. James has tried to
break out of the detective mold
and into the open novel. Consid
ering the tension and suspense
engendered by Innocent Blood,
she may have failed. Her pro
tagonist, Philippa Rose Palfrey,
sets out to discover the identity
of her natural parents and falls
into a psychological morass
foreshadowed by the reluctance
of her adoptive parents, Maurice
and Hilda, to encourage her
search. The book is less than
satisfying in its conclusion, yet it
holds the reader in respectful
thrall because of the masterful
characterizations which nearly
dominate the plot.
No character, however briefly
introduced or however minor,
is allowed to remain two
dimensional. The reader is
guaranteed to find fault with the
most favorable characters and to
find worth in the most despicable
ones. It is this point
counterpoint of psychological
types that lends complexity to a
plot which cannot otherwise rival
the suspense of certain other
James works such as Death of an
Expert Witness.
James' writing style makes
clever use of intricate metaphors
and literary imagery to delight
the most literate of readers. The
protagonist, Philippa, is said to
have presented herself to the
world "with self-conscious art,
daily remaking herself in her
own image." Of her adoptive pa
rents, Philippa states, "1 don't
think they love me. But we suit
each other on the whole. That's
more convenient, I imagine, than
living with people that you love
but don't suit." As she travels to

the London suburb where her
natural parents once lived, she
notes the drab urban sprawl
"from which sprang a tangle of
television aerials, frail crooked
fetishes against the evil eye."
James once more makes refer
ence to ancient superstitions
when describing a character's re
luctance to pronounce his happi
ness. "How early he must have
learned that primeval lesson, the
distrust of joy. Touch wood,
cross fingers, light a candle,
please God don't notice that I'm
happy." Hesitant to give voice to
her need for parental love, the
protagonist says of her mother,
"when she was there she was
more there than anyone I've ever
known."
