## rock 'n' roll/doug steiner Author/musician Jim Carroll speaks out 
### 
Not many people in the audience
last Friday at the Mabuhay Gar
dens knew that Jim Carroll is an
accomplished author and poet.
They liked his rock'n'roll, his
confidence on stage, the driving
heat. He wasn't Elvis Costello,
Springsteen, or early Dylan, but
he did have an equally unique
sound. The lyrics werent always
intelligible but there was a re
markable rhythm to them. On
Saturday night the overflowing,
almost violent crowd clamored
for three encores. He parted his
hair, he squeezed the mike back
with both hands, he swung it to
the side — all the while a tension
in his resonant voice, in the rush
ing stream of words that still
managed to fit the beat.
In an interview a few days ago,
Carrol! had this to say about the
show: "I really felt good that
night.and I was jumping up on
the drum risers and doing the
stuff 1 never usually do. It was a
really .special show. It was like
magic that happens. There are
certain songs that do that to me,
like "When the City Drops Into
the Night," they always take me
out of myself. You really trans
cend, and you just don't know
where the fuck you are or any
thing. It's incredible the power
that comes onto you, and that
you feel going out into the audi
ence. They pick it up too, and
then you're completely vulnera
ble. I think that's what impresses
audiences most about what 1 do.
They get very riveted and mes
merized.
"After that show it took me
two days to get over it. Still
kinda hyped from it."
From the age of 12 to 15 Jim
Carroll wrote his highly

acclaimed book, The Basketball
Diaries, recently re-released as a
paperback. One volume of his
poetry, entitled Living at the
Movies, was nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize.
Back in the '60s he might have
turned to rock or even folk
rather than poetry, but, "I
couldn't play the fuckin' guitar.
The guy who was teaching me
was always trying to get me to
play right-handed."

But about two years ago he
started taking music seriously,
becoming a proficient guitarist,
lefty.
Ultimately it was Patti Smith
who gave him his first taste of
the music scene; he opened for
her in San Diego as a last minute
fill-in. He had some lyrics
memorized only because he was
down there to read them in a
friend's movie. It was his first
show, and he only had about ten

minutes worth of material.
Heartfelt lyrics
"The audience just went crazy
about it."he says,"and I was
completely bitten. 1 had this
music coming from behind me
giving me this energy and this
enormous kid energy from the
audience, which you never ex
perience at a poetry reading.
These kids just perceive these
lyrics to their heart rather than in
their intellect. They couldn't

care less about any style, or being
impressed by the sophistication
of an image — with poets you try
to blow someone away with a
line, 'what a great fuckin' line'
and you can hide any bullshit be
hind this facade of style, and
people will be impressed — with
kids, they don't care about that.
They can see through any lies if
you're writing a song that's out
side of yourself, which is what
most songs are, they're after
thoughts, a musician's idea of
what a lyric should be . . . like
Devo doing what they consider
to be clever, whereas it's like fif
teenth rate William Burroughs.
Art student bullshit. When 1 de
cided to do this, I said 1 was going
to do rock'n'roll songs with the
best lyrics I could write . . . These
lyrics arc integral to me. and
they're honest in that sense. You
can't go wrong with that, because
they (the audience) perceive that
at a heart level. They dug it
though, the kids. For me, their
energy coming at me and the
musical energy was just energy
sandwich with me between it,
and 1 was bit. So the next time 1
got asked to do a poetry reading
at the Mabuhay 1 said 'fuck it,'
and we put together this thing."
A collaborative effort
Part of the reason Carroll's
band sounds so tight is that all of
the songs are a collaborative ef
fort. Carroll works on the music
as well as the lyrics, and
everyone contributes something
to the blend at one time or
another. Lyrics are his forte
though. In reading them you can
get a feel for the many different
levels of sophistication at work in
his songs. Dominating every

thing there is a rush of emotion.
From the title track of his upcom
ing debut, Catholic Boy, due out
in about a month comes this:
I was born in a pool, they made
my mother stand
And I spat on that surgeon and
his trembling hand.
When I felt the light, I was worse
than bored
I stole a doctor's scalpel, and I
slit the cord.
I was a Catholic boy, I was re
deemed thru pain and not thru
joy.
Carroll says that his song
"When the City Drops" takes
him out of himself on stage. For
the listener too, there is a tension
so great, an impending giant hor
ror so powerfully sustained that
your flesh crawls and heart tight
ens with a flood of emotion.
It's when ambitious little girls
start .. . they start to dream
about a change in style
It's when the slick boys got their
finger . . . they got their finger in
the telephone dial ....
It's when the sneak thives check
the alleys ... they check the al
leys for unlocked doors
And Bobby's little sister gets
frantic... Cause Bobby's sister's
little brother can't score
It's when the woman from my
dream is ... oh my God,
That's the woman on the floor
Single out soon
Originally Keith Richards was
going to produce the album, but
his own Emotional Rescue was a
long time in the studio. Lou
Reed was excited about produc
ing it, but things didn't work out.
Anyway, the first single should
be out next week, "Day and
Night" b/w "People Who Died."

Bobby Keyes, saxophonist on
most of the Rolling Stones' al
bums can be heard on some of
the album cuts, and Clarence
demons of the E Street Band
plays on one song. After Catholic
Boy is released there will be a
national tour, but for now, Jim
Carroll will still be at the smaller
clubs — the Back Dor tomorrow
night, and the Keystone Palo
Alto a week from tomorrow.
The press now treats Jim Car
roll as a kind of novelty, although
he's still doing everything he used
to do, and writing more prose
than he has for a long time. In a
few weeks the national
magazines will be carrying
stories on him. Just you wait.
