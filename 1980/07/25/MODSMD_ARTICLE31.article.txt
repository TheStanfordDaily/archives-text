MOSCOW (AP) — Yelena Davydova of the
Soviet Union won the women's gymnastics all
around competition at the Summer Olympics last
night alter an unbelievable argument among officials
delayed the announcement of a winner for almost 30
minutes.
Davydova was given the gold medal with 79.150
points. Nadia Comaneci of Romania and Maxi
Gnauck of East Germany tied for the silver medal at
79.075 each.
The dispute erupted after Comaneci finished her
final exercise on the balance beam. She earlier had
scored a perfect 10 points on the uneven parallel
bars, from which she fell Wednesday night in team
competition when her Romanian team finished sec
ond to the Soviets.
A Soviet spokesman said the dispute concerned
the initial refusal of the Romanian head judge,
Maria Simionescu, to agree with the decision of four
eastern European judges to award Comaneci 9.85
points for the beam routine. The Romanian oficial
insisted that she be given a score of 9.9 or above.
The dispute was referred to a jury, which upheld
the judges' decision If Comaneci had gotten a 10,

she would have won the event.
During the judges' controversy, Davydova, 18,
went up onto the mat and held up her arms to the
crowd of mostly Soviet fans. They roared, except for
a small group of Romanians which was demonstrat
ing volubly for Comaneci and holding up Romanian
flags and banners.
In the men's all-around gymnastics competition
yesterday afternoon, Alexander Dityatin of the
Soviet Union won the gold medal and became the
first male Olympic gymnast to score a perfect mark
of 10.
Dityatin, the all-around world champion, re
ceived a perfect 10 in the vault. In all, five perfect
10 scores were awarded in the men's competition.
Soviet swimmer Vladimir Salnikov won his third
gold medal of these games last night, setting an
Olympic record of 3:51.31 in the men's 400-meter
freestyle. He broke a 3:51.93 record set by Brian
Goodell of the United States in 1976, and added to
the gold medals he won in the 1500-meters, in
which he became the first man to swim the distance
in under 15 minutes, and the 800 relay.
