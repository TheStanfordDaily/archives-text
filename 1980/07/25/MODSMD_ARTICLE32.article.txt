ECCO! It means "here it is" in
Italian. And here in Palo Alto is
an amazing Italian restaurant.
Many people have probably first
noticed the Hyatt Palo AJto as
we did; the Las Vegas-looking
place with the white statues in
the driveway. Well, the statues
are gone, and evidently the re
modeling was done inside and
out, for ECCO and the Tempo
lounge opened just this last May.
We were early for our reserva
tion and went first into Tempo.
Comfortable chairs and wonder
fully plush loveseats await here,
along with an unusual party mix
in glass jars on the tables â€”
cracker bits, peanuts in a
cookie-like shell, and many
other difficult to describe
goodies. Warning: these are very
addicting. The drinks are not
cheap, $1.75 for a glass of wine,
$2.95 for a Strawberry dacquiri.
This last though was one of the
best we have had, very fruity,
thick, and not overly sweet.
The restaurant itself, however,
is the truly special part. It is sur
rounded by frosted etched glass
panels, with many lush plants,
and done overall in pretty green
tones. Seating is a combination
of round tables with wicker

chairs, and many circular booths.
We were seated in one of these
booths and were quite pleased
and comfortable. Almost im
mediately two smiling young
people introduced themselves as
Molly and Cole, our waiting
team for the night.
The menu is a la carte; this is
not one of those seven course
family style Italian restaurants.
Several appetizers are offered,
including antipasto ($2.95), as
well as soup, both a soup of the
day-and Minestrone ($1.50,
$1.75), and a salad ($1.50). We
chose to try these last two.
The remainder of the menu
consists of pasta, pizza, and meat
and seafood dishes. The past and
pizza are both made from scratch
at a pasta bar in the center of the
restaurant.
As we wanted to sample both
this pasta and the more tradi
tional entrees, I ordered the Fet
tucini Ecco ($7.95) at our wait
resses suggestion, and my friend
chose the Veal Marsala
($11.95).
Other selections included the
Pizza ($7.95), which we were
told was excellent, six other pas
tas ($5.95-8.50), with either
green or white noodles, and in
triguing preparations of a dozen
varying meats and fish, including
stuffed calamari ($7.95) and
duckling di tullio ($11.95).
We had also chosen a bottle of

wine, a white Italian Fontina
Candida ($8), and found even
the wine opener to be special. A
contraption called a Bacchus, it
stood about four feet high on
three legs. Our waitress, who
seemed to be really enjoying her
work, explained to us the opera
tion of this device.
Then the salad arrived. House
salads tend to be a plate of let
tuce, with perhaps one other
vegetable or a tomato slice
thrown in. Not at ECCO. Molly
wheeled out a wooden cart with a
bowl of lettuce in the center, and
side compartments of broccoli,
cauliflower, mozzarella, mus
hrooms, prosciutto, homemade
croutons, and a few other things.
Asking before she added each
item, she tossed it all together
with dressing and presented a
huge plate to me. As a final
touch, salad forks are kept chil
led in a glass bowl with crushed
ice, surrounded by carnations. It
was definitely one of my more
memorable salads.
The soup arrived shortly after,
and it was quite good, though a
bit of a letdown after the salad
preparation. Our waiter, how
ever, returned with a hand-held
gadget containing a block of
parmesan cheese, which he
grated over the soup. Another
special touch!
With these openers came a
skillet of bread, sourdough garlic
on one side, pizza bread (the
same base with tomato sauce and
cheese) on the other. It was de
licious. We were offered more,
but decided wisely to save room

for the entrees. The empty skillet
was then removed, and fresh
breadsticks brought to replace it.
The entrees didn't deviate
from this general excellence. The
veal was well-cooked, tender,
and served in a light but still tasty
sauce. It was accompanied by
crisply cooked fresh vegetables,
which made for a colorfully at
tractive plate. The Fettucccini,
which was a huge portion (if you
choose this dish as an appetizer,
split it, at least two ways), was
equally well presented. Fresh
green noodles were topped with
sauteed tomato wedges and
mushrooms, ham livers, and sev

eral large prawns. The fresh
parmesan cheese was offered
again too. It was a wonderful
dish. Even the noodles them
selves had a good flavor; they
were miles above the average
bland store-bought pasta. We
were told the fettuccini was very
popular, and I would unhesitat
ingly recommend it.
We had planned on ordering
dessert, but were unsure of being
able to eat it. Our approaching
waiter heard us discussing split
ting something, and offered that
he had just the thing. We trusted
his judgment, and were glad we
did. He brought us each a small
glass plate containing one can
noli, a rolled pastry shell filled
with sweetened cheeses (ricotta
and cream) and chocolate chips,
capped with cherries and dusted
with powdered sugar ($2.25 for
2). They were almost too rich but
delicious.
We were completely charmed
by ECCO. The atmosphere was
casual; customers dressed in ev
erything from shorts (hotel
guests?) to semi-formal attire.
The food was delicious and pre
sented with as much flair and im
agination as I've ever seen. On
top of it all, our waiting team
managed to combine first name
familiarity with really good, car
ing service; we never had to wait
long for anything. An evening
with "the works" there will cost
over $30 (though you could
spend less), but it will be worth it,
and probably be one to re
member. It was for us.
