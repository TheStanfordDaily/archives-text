For us, Shang Yuen was a very pleasant surprise.
Often referred to as"that Chinese restaurant in the
Cannery," the restaurant is frequently dismissed
by those in the Bay area as a tourist spot. How
ever, we discovered that, although Shang Yuen
serves a large number of tourists, it does not com
promise on the authenticity of its cuisine and serves
many Northern Chinese favorites as well as some
unique and special dishes.
Prices at Shang Yuen cover a large range and tend
to be on the slightly expensive side, but are afford
able. We were surprised to note that most of the
items listed on the menu were Northern, not Can
tonese, and that many would probably be unfamil
iar to most tourists.
The menu features several sections, including
House Specials, appetizers (hot and cold), sizzling
iron platters, poultry and seafood. The manage
ment recommends all the house specials, Szechuan
prawns, smoked tea duck and the iron platters as
customer favorites. As in many other Chinese re
staurants, the chef is willing to accomodate cus
tomers who order dishes not found in the written
menu.
The name "Shang Yuen" can be roughly inter
preted as "elegance atop the mountain" and was
the name of a favorite dining spot of the emperors of
China. The atmosphere of the restaurant reflects
this name.
The decor is attractive and artistic without being
gaudy. The entire restaurant is long and narrow
with windows facing the city inland and a garden
type balcony outside (no dining on the balcony).
However, beautiful painted screens break up the
length and make it possible to close off large indi
vidual rooms for banquets.
When one enters, a large Mongolian grill table
marks the center and a cocktail lounge with large
comfortable chairs and a view of the city sits off to
one side. The walls have a warm red and gold motif
with scrolls and plants, giving the room a refreshing
garden atmosphere.
Our first dish was the squab soup in bamboo cup
($1.75 per person). The soup was prepared and

served in individual bamboo cups made of wide
bamboo sections. The manager explained that
since American bamboo was too slender and nar
row, the cups were imported from Taiwan at con
siderable expense.The soup was prepared by minc
ing squab with other ingredients, spooning it into
the cups and steaming them until the squab was
cooked and had produced a broth. The result was
both attractive and delicious!
The next dish was one of the house favorites â€”
smoked tea duck (half size $9.00). As described in
the menu, the chef wrapped a whole duck in spices
and tea leaves for several days, roasted it in an oven
and deep fried it before serving. It arrived on
shredded lettuce, cut to an easy-to-handle size.
The combination cooking method rendered a crisp
skin and tender and juicy meat. The flavor was
deliciously different, not at all overpowering or
greasy.
After we finished the duck, our waiter placed a
very hot, ornately carved iron platter in the center
of our table and warned us to protect our faces with
our napkins. He then poured a prepared dish of
stir-fried beef, onions and green peppers onto the
platter. The dish sputtered, fizzled and steamed for
a minute and then we very carefully served ourse
lves.
The dessert, almond float, was the real thing.
Used to a white variation on Knox gelatin in most
places, we were pleased to find the almond cubes
made from agar mixed with whole lichees and
juice. The dessert was a little too sweet and over
powering for our tastes, but it was nonetheless very
refreshing.
In retrospect, we regret that we did not ask to try
one of the many interesting seafood dishes, since
Shang Yuen is located by Fisherman's Wharf and
many customers would want to order fish, squid or
prawns. However, what we did eat that night was
both delicious and attractively served.
Shang Ylien promises a meal with many interest
ing dishes, in attractive surroundings with well
paced, careful service.
It is an ideal place when you want good food and
more, whether you are going in a large group or
with only one other person. The restaurant has the
ideal by-the-bay atmosphere without the touristy
compromising overtones of the many other re
staurants in the immediate vicinity.
