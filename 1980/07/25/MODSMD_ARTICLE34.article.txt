Great Eastern, located in the
heart of San Francisco's
Chinatown, is a moderate to mod
erately expensive restaurant re
commended for large groups and
banquets.
Although the restaurant offers
dishes from many areas of China,
in our opinion, (warning: this is
based on only two visits) the less
spicy dishes are by far the best.
Gracious co-owner/manager
Ms. Wong, plays a very impor
tant role at the restaurant and is
often present to seat her guests
and assist in ordering house
favorites.
Dishes she especially recom
mends include clams in black
bean sauce, taro baskets with
shrimp and a special stuffed
chicken.
On our second occasion to
visit Great Eastern, we asked
Ms. Wong to order for us and she
proposed the chef's special
($9.95 per person) plus her favo
rite dish — clams in black bean
sauce. For the two of us, this
came to two appetizers, soup, six
entrees and dessert for approxi
mately $ 12 each. Warning to our
readers: you will probably want
to order much less!
The appetizers consisted of
barbecued spareribs and a large
spring (egg) roll cut into four
pieces served on a bed of shred
ded lettuce.
The spareribs were tasty and
not at all greasy. If you like your
spareribs spicy, you will find
these quite mild. The spring roll,
though not very crispy, had a de
licious filling of a large variety of
shredded meat and vegetables.
This was followed by a very
flavorful chicken soup with three
won tons floating among pieces
of ham, char-siu (barbecued
pork) and chopped green onions.

The entrees were then served
approximately at the same time.
The butterfly shrimp were de
licious. Split flat, dipped in egg
batter and fried, they had a diffe
rent texture than the light and
crispy deep fried rock cod filet
served with sweet and sour
sauce.
The next dish, parchment
chicken, is rarely found on the
written menu of most Chinese
restaurants. It consisted of very
tender boneless chicken, co
vered with hoisin (plum) sauce,
carefully wrapped in squares of
aluminum foil and then deep
fried.
The final two entrees were ex
cellent. Large tender steak cubes
were marinated and stirfried
with green pepper and onion
very briefly so that the steak was
juicy and very rare and the veg
etables, bright, flavorful and
crisp.
At this point, we were abso
lutely stuffed and ready to leave
when the waiter stopped us and
served dessert. The dessert —
lotus squares, were something
new which we had never eaten
before. Not only were they a
welcome change from your stan
dard almond float, mandarin
oranges or fortune cookies, but
they were heavenly — and de
-1 iciously fattening. They con
sisted of two layers of dough with
a filling of yellow bean paste be
tween, deep fried and served hot
cut into squares.
In summary, the food that
night was very, very good. How
ever, we had eaten there previ
ously and had not been as happy
with our meal. We surmise that
spicy, hot food (which we had
ordered previously) is not this
restaurant's forte. What the chef
and manager prefer to serve
tends to be tasty but not very
spicy.
