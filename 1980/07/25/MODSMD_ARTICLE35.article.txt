EMPRESS OF CHINA
838 Grant Avenue, Top Floors
San Francisco
434-1345
The Empress of China is breathtakingly
beautiful. Located on top of the China Trade
Center on Grant Avenue, the restaurant boasts
a huge banquet room on the fifth floor, a large
cocktail lounge and four large dining rooms
each with fabulous views of the city. From the
moment one steps off the elevator to view the
empress painting and the octagonal wood pavil
ion assembled without a single nail, it is without
doubt that the decor of this restaurant is one of
the high points that has made it world famous.
The green and gold decor accompanied by
plants and trees give the restaurant a garden
like atmosphere and at the same time bone
inlaid tables, art objects, and Princess Chan
deliers make the palace an art-collector's
dream.
The restaurant is so famous that visitors to
San Francisco from cities as far as Paris have
heard of the Empress of China and indeed, we
were seated near five French businessmen at the
next table. The customers of the restaurant
were varied in age and dress from the French
businessmen to large families and young
couples in T-shirts.
The waiters, neatly dressed and attentive, are
friendly and quick to assist in ordering and
answering questions. What was very refreshing
was their lack of stuffiness and snobbery despite
the formality and opulence of the setting. The
customers and employees add the hit of infor
mality that makes the Empress of China an
elegant yet comfortable place to dine.
Prices at the Empress of China are quite high,
ranging from 52.25-58.50 for appetizers,
52.50-S 12.50 for soup, and entrees run about
S7-SlO. The restaurant features many dishes
from all regions of China and a separate chef for
each region. There are few unusual dishes listed
and most are appealing to the untrained palate.
For delicacies and exotic dishes, this is probably
not the place (unless you are planning a banquet
and order in advance).
We were served the "China Gourmet" menu
($18.95 per person; other complete menus
were for $9.95 and $11.95). This included
Scampi, Kuo Tieh (Peking pot stickers), bar
becued Young Quail, Sizzling Rice Soup, Szec
huan Spiced Beef, Empress Lobster Prawns,

Rice and Peking Glazed Apples for dessert.
The Kuo Tieh were delicious and juicy yet
crisp on the bottom. They came served with
shredded ginger, vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil
poured on top by the waiter. He also placed a
small spice dish of ginger salt and Chinese mus
tard next to our plates in case we wanted spicier
food.
The scampi were served in a mildly hot sauce
with green onions and a seafood fork, which
turned out to be very useful. They were delici
ously tender and just enough to whet our appe
tites for our next dish. Hot towels accompanied
the scampi and as we were wiping our fingers,
the waiter wheeled in a cart with our next ap
petizer.
The young quail had been marinated and
barbecued in a five-spice sauce but our waiter
then poured brandy over them and flambeed
them at the table. The result was fabulous!
The soup, sizzling rice soup, was dramatically
served as our waiter slid a plate of crisp deep
fried rice into a steaming broth chock-full with
zucchini, black mushrooms, pork, shrimp, tofu
and green onions. We found the soup very fil
ling and a cut above similar soups elsewhere due
to the large variety of ingredients in the soup.
Both the beef and lobster and prawns were
very good, served in large quantities. The beef
was not very spicy but quite tender. The lobster
and prawns were served in large pieces with
water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, mushrooms
and vegetables each with its own distinct flabor.
In observing the service, we would describe it
as meticulous. Our waiter explained each dish,
wiped every plate before setting it down and
was very careful with the smallest details. Rice
came pre-packaged in small bowls inverted on
plates which were then Hipped over when they
reached our table. A doily was placed under
neath our teapot (which was promptly refilled
whenever it was empty),and hot towels accom
panied each new dish which required use of
one's fingers.
The dessert. Peking Glazed Apples, was per
fectly prepared. Sliced apples, dipped in batter
with sesame seeds and sauteed in sugar syrup
were dropped into ice water and removed crisp
on the outside and warm and juicy inside. The
meal was completed with almond cookies and
fruit thins. â€ž .. _
