# Chinese cuisine & continental decor

IMPERIAL PALACE
919 Grant Avenue
San Francisco
982-4440
Located in the heart of
Chinatown, the Imperial Palace
reflects a quiet elegance dis
tinctly apart from the crowded
city streets. A doorman greets
the diner to the dimly lit ambi
ence of manager Tommy Toy's
highly celebrated restaurant.
The Imperial Palace is in a
class of its own. The decor is
tastefully chosen in muted red
and gold tones, crystal chan
deliers, silver platters, and of
course, roses on the table.
One may be surprised at this
seemingly continental atmos
phere, but the proximinity of the
tables and the excellent cuisine
show hopeful glimpses of the
Chinese authenticity the diner is
seeking. Indisputably, this com
bination of Chinese cuisine with
continental service is what
makes the Imperial Palace un
ique.
The prices are extremely high,
probably matched by few other
Chinese Restaurants in the area.
Appetizers can easily double the
price listed elsewhere and en
trees average around $9.ooeach.
(Keep in mind that one would
order more than one entree per
person.) Delicacies such as
Sharks Fin Soup and Peking
Duck run close to $20.00. What
one pays for is not so much the
food itself (which though superb,
can be found comparably at
lower prices elsewhere) but the
service, atmosphere and elegant
decor.
Our waiter was dressed for
mally and brought us an ap
petizer of minced squab served
on crisp lettuce cups and topped

with hoisin sauce. The squab was
cooked with water chestnuts,
mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and
olive seeds combined together
for a variety of flavors and tex
tures which made this appetizer a
treat. Hot towels followed this
dish.
The soup was brought in on a
cart, served in a tureen heated
dramatically with flames leaping
from underneath the dish. The
shredded scallop soup was de
licious with mushrooms and
fresh coriander to complement
the seafood.
For the main meal, we had
three entrees: chicken with black
bean sauce, crystal prawns, and
barbequed Mongolian lamb with
asparagus. All ot the dishes were
beautifully presented and
cooked to perfection. Our waiter
served the entrees together
Western style (on individual
plates).
The lamb had been marinated
before cooking and was very
tender and barely tasted like
lamb. The asparagus was tender;
the other vegetables were crisp
but not underdone.
We topped off this sumptuous
dinner with almond float served
with lichees and loquats. The
fruit was light and refreshing but
the almond float was absolutely
overpowering. We would
perhaps recommend this dessert
with reservations.
Technically, in every aspect,
the Imperial Palace is perfect.
The cuisine is superb, the service
impeccable and the surroundings
elegant. The restaurant has been
successful in attracting the haute
couture. However, the restaur
ant is not recommended for
those seeking authentic Chinese
cuisine in every aspect.
The Imperial Palace has excel
lent facilities for banquet dining
and special dishes developed for
the occasion. Be prepared to
learn about such exquisite dishes
as "Buddha Jumps Over the
Fence," taking several days to
make and costing $75. Our din
ner of appetizer, soup, three en
trees and dessert for two came to
approximately $65.
