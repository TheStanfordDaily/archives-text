King of Hearts ★ ★ ★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
This enormously popular anti-war
valentine is probably over-rated: it
gets a little too wrapped up in the
wonder of its own whimsy for comfort.
But this is a fantasy that's hard to re
sist: in the end, those who are simple
and kind triumph over those who are
clever and wicked.
Alan Bates stars as the WW I sol
dier who enters a French village where
the only inhabitants are the residents
of the town's insane asylum. He falls in
love with the completely looney and
very charming Genevieve Bujold, and
they live crazily ever after. Philippe
Deßroca directed.
—Jim Mattson
Casablanca ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented ro
mance for two generations of
filmgoers.
Casablanca sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung over
and over again by Dooley Wilson, and
the services of Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and the
great Claude Rains also add their ta
lents. What more could you ask?
The director was Michael Curtiz
(Robin Hood) and the studio was
Warner Brothers. Starts next Thurs
day.

Norma Rie ★ ★ ★ ★
Fox, Redwood City
Martin Ritt directed this industrial
drama about a woman who fights to
have a union put in the textile mill
where she works. Sally Field gives an
assured and very likeable perfor
mance asNorma Rae; herdaysas"the
Flying Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her southern
accented, rolling-gaited character.
This is a "small" movie in the same
way that An Unmarried Woman was
small — the emphasis is more on
characterization than on action. Ron
Leibman'co-stars. Plays with Coal
Miner's Daughter.
La Cage aus Folles ★ ★ ★
Fine Arts, Pak> Alto
When your future father-in-law is
the Undersecretary for Public Moral
ity, how do you explain the six-foot
dildo in the living room? Or the fish
net stockings on the butler? Or your
mother's beard? A Guess Who's Com
ing To Dinner for the '70s, but much
funnier and much less offensive. Star

ring Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Ser
rault.
—Mike Hale
Being There ★ ★ ★ ★
Laurel, San Carlos
Hal Ashby (Coming Home, Sham
poo) directed this affecting, gentle sa
tire about a man whose innocence be
comes a valuable commodity. Peter
Sellers plays Chance the gardener; his
performance may be his best since he
played Quilty in Kubrick's Lohta.
Being There is so tied to Chance's
deadpan, simplemindedly literal
world-view that the audience leaves
the theater a little dazed — our
thought processes have begun to slow
and stretch to match his. Shirley Mac-
Laine and Melvyn Douglas (who won
an Oscar for his efforts) turn in fine
supporting characterizations. Plays
Monday and Tuesday.

Harold and Maude 'A' ★ 'fc
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
Harold is a young man whose hob
bies are attending funerals and com
mitting suicide. Maude is an old

Chushingura, an epic tale of
Japanese feudalism, plays
tomorrow through Monday at
the New Varsity Theater in
Palo Alto. Hiroshi Inagaki di
rected this version of the clas
sic tale of the 47 samurai who
strive to avenge the death of
their master. No attempts
were made to conceal the
film's studio origins — the
leaves on the trees are cel
lophane, and the houses, with
brilliant, omni-directional
lighting, are obviously sets.
Inagaki's characters are as
stylized, making Chushingura
less an example of filmed the
ater than of an effort to crys
tallize narrative through ar
tifice.

woman who believes in free love and
in the inherent goodness of humanity.
It's clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby (Being There, Coming Home)
directed this invigorating cult comedy.
The two principals are played by Bud
Cort and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens enliven the soundtrack.

Airplane
Menlo, Menlo Park
From most of the people that
brought you Kentucky Fried Movie
comes this disappointing and largely

unfunny parody of disaster films.
There are about a million and a half
jokes in this one — unfortunately only
eight or nine of them are at all humor
ous. Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul
Jabbar and a whole host of other
non-comedians are the non-stars.
—Peter Finch
The Empire Strikes Back ★ ★ ★ ★
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Empire Strikes Back is a classic
in motion picture entertainment. The
visual effects have been lauded across
the pages of newspapers around the
world. Combining these stunning ef
fects with a plot that is simple but ex
citing has given this movie a trait
which is sadly lacking in the industry
today: FUN. Don't expect great con
clusions on the human situation; just
sit and enjoy each scene as it whizzes
by at speeds not allowed by current
laws of physics. Like its predecessor,
you'll want to see this one twice.
—Chris Greene

The Shining ★
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry L.loyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.
—J.M.
The Blurs Brothers Movie ★ ★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—P.F.
The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randall Kleiser
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a
'4()s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.
