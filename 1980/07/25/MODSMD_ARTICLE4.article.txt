# Grievances aired at Tresidder protest
## 
### Chris Rogers Peter Steinerman Staff Writers 
Some 30 angry custodians and
maintenance employees at Tre
sidder Union marched Wednes
day, protesting what they con
sider "unjustified" harassment
by the management.
The employees, members of
United Stanford Employees
(USE), organized the march to
highlight problems they face at
their jobs and to demand im
mediate action from Tresidder
managers.
However, Tresidder officials
later said most of the workers'
complaints were not current and
that they had been resolved
some time ago. They also said
they were unaware of the pur
pose of the demonstration.
Danny Ibrisimovic, USE pres
ident, said the recent policies of
the management have caused
"unjust" hardships to the custo
dians. The workers' primary
complaint was management's al
leged use of temporary help in
the facility, instead of moving to
replace unfilled permanent posi
tions.
Additional complaints include

the exclusion of temporary help
from the use of time clocks, ordi
narily mandated for the perma
nent staff.
Ibrisimovic also cited the un
necessary staggering of workers'
lunch breaks, claiming that it was
done to prevent their gathering
together on the free time; and
the undue "disciplining" of staff
members with exemplary re
cords.
The "unkindest cut" of all,
added Ibrisimovic, was to change
the graveyard (late night) shift to
a swing (afternoon-evening)
shift. He commented that this
has made the work of the custo
dians much harder, as there are
more customers at that time in
the actual work areas.
Acting steward Ah Kan Lee
addressed the demonstrators,
urged them to make their re
quests known and warned they
would take no more "harass
ment."
Ibrisimovic also spoke to the
protesters, saying he felt the
"harassment" was actually an at
tempt to "break up" the union.

Union director, said later she

had been approached by the de
monstrators just as she wasleav
ing the cafeteria area. Op
penheim commented most of the
issues the employees were de
monstrating against had been
"resolved" some time ago.
The major problem currently
unresolved, Oppenheini said,
remains that of "combining op
erations needs and personal
schedules." She added the facil
ity had not been using temporary
help for the past month, and the
complaints about lunch breaks
had been resolved a week before

the protest. Jeff Nelson, Tresid
der manager, later commented
he was not aware of the purpose
of the demonstration at the time.
He said Tresidder was "dirty,"
and did not look well, and that he
was "implementing some new
ideas" in order to change the
situation.
Admitting that these ideas
were not being accepted as well
as he would have liked. Nelson
commented that "nobody had
been forced out yet."
Nelson said he was not trying
to " 'union-bust,' but trying to
make Tresidder a nice place for
the community."
