# Arrow: decontrol, put profits tax on oil
## 
### Susie Blake Staff Writer 
Nobel Laureate Kenneth
Arrow highlighted the aims of
an economic system concerned
with policy-making on energy
and the environment Tuesday
evening during Memorial
Church's Distinguished Fa
culty Forum.
Arrow, professor of opera
tions research and economics
here, defined the goals of an
economic system as achieving a
balance between equity and ef
ficiency to "provide the most
human satisfaction possible"
and commented that this ba
lance might be best ac
complished in the energy area
by regulating environmental
cost and by decontrolling
prices.
The present price controls on
oil and energy have kept the
domestic price below the world

price and are thus inefficient
since the price of oil does not
reflect the actual economic
costs, argued Arrow.
He suggested that foreign oil
embargoes directed at the Un
ited States may lead to energy
shortages and thus increase
U.S. political vulnerability.
Current energy policy calls
for a gradual decontrol of crude
oil prices until the domestic
price reaches the world price by
October 1981.
If oil is decontrolled, the ad--
ditional profits resulting from
price increases could then be
taxed and redistributed
through a policy such as the
Windfall Profits Tax, Arrow
continued. He proposed that
by combining the efficiency of
the unregulated market price
system and the equity of redis
tribution through a profits tax
both functions of the economic
system would be met.
