## Shuttles, satellites, systems: U.S. plans and problems 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
The United States has not put
much effort into the develop
ment of space stations for
people, according to Joseph
Sharp, deputy director of life sci
ences at Mountain View's
NASA-Ames Research Center.
"There are no plans to put
people in space more than 30
days before the end of the cen
tury," Sharp told a crowd of
more than 100 Wednesday night
at an Aerospace Technology
Seminar.
Although the new space shut
tle will contain a large space
laboratory dedicated primarily
to life sciences, he said the
Soviets have pioneered space
station work. They have almost
twice the number of person-days
in space as the United States and
they were "the first to experi
ment with everyday manufactur
ing activities such as welding"
and laboratory construction.
Should the United States de
cide to begin a space station
program, the research will locus
on creating closed loop systems,
where the waste of one part is the
food of another.
Sharp said among the many
chemical loops necessary for
human sur\ ival, the most evident
is the production of oxygen by
plants from the waste carbon
dioxide of human respiration.

No stable, closed system of liv
ing things has been constructed
to date, according to Sharp. Even
in nature, "nothing near" a
closed system has been observed
except the earth itself. The ac
complishment of this feat for a
human living system, even if con
stant money were spent on re
search, is 50 to 100 years away,
Sharp predicted.
He said this research would
begin by attempting to construct
a stable aquarium of bacteria,
working up to larger systems that
would include humans.
The space stations would be
donut-like structures a few
kilometers across that spin at a
rate sufficient to create an artifi
cial gravity from the centrifugal
force. People would be able to
stand in the ring on the outside
wall Mirrors at the center would
guide light through windows in
the inside wall of the ring.
The inside of the ring would be
quite natural because an enorm
ous number of plants would be
necessary to keep the oxygen
level correct, Sharp said. He
speculated that recombinant
DNA techniques might aid the
creation of more efficient oxygen
producing plants.
Queried about the safety of
the outer structure of the ring, he
replied that if a hatch were left
open or it a meteor struck one of
