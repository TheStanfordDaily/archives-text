### William Clairborne The Washington Post 
JERUSALEM â€” A second
hunger-striking Palestinian sec
urity prisoner from the controv
ersial Nafha Prison in the Negev
Desert died yesterday as a result
of forced feeding by Israeli au
thorities, sparking a new wave of
Arab protests in the West Bank
and East Jerusalem.
Despite the deaths, prison of
ficials said other Arab prisoners
who are protesting conditions at
Nafha would continue to be
force fed through tubes inserted
into their mouths. A prison ser
vices official said the alternative
was to let the inmates die, and
that this was rejected because of
"Jewish humanism."
The incidents have generated
a controversy among Israeli
Jiuman rights activists, some of
iwhom have demanded that the
prison system's policy of force
feeding protesting inmates be
reviewed. The prisoners in
volved are in their 13th day of
refusing to eat.
The Interior Ministry said it
will appoint a committee to re
view the policy but forced feed
ing would continue for the time
being.
Denying charges by attorneys
of the victims that they had suf
focated after salt water was
pumped into their lungs by
guards, prison officials said the
inmates had regurgitated a liquid
food solution that was forced

into their stomachs, and then
held their breaths until it entered
their lungs.
Authorities said the forced
feeding "accidents" had occur
red at the Ramie Prison, near Tel
Aviv, where 26 prisoners were
transferred Monday night from
Nafha. At first, prison officials
had said the inmates had been
transferred to Ramie because of
their weakened condition from
not eating, and had contacted
pneumonia.
The second Arab prisoner to
die was Rassim Muhammed Ha
lani, who was serving a life sen
tence at Nafha for three convic
tions of throwing hand grenades
in the Gaza Strip, one of which
killed a Gaza resident. On Tues
day night, another prisoner,
Mohammed Shahada Jaafri,
died as a result of forced feeding.
The deaths triggered a series
of demonstrations yesterday in
Bethlehem and East Jerusalem
at which Arab protestors and re
latives of the victims charged Is
raeli prison authorities with beat
ing the inmates and then forcing
crude rubber hoses down their
throats into which was poured
liquids. A prison services
spokesman, David Zilberman,
denied the charge, saying trained
nurses were present at the feed
ings.
Lea Tsemel, one of the in
mates' attorneys, produced an
affidavit she said she obtained
from a Palestinian prisoner,

Yaacoub Dawani, 34, a former
economics student at Cairo Uni
versity, who was sentenced to life
in 1968 on a terrorism convic
tion.
In the statement, Dawani said
nurses and guards at Ramle beat
him repeatedly when he refused
to eat rice and milk, and then
forced a rubber tube from an
enema bag into his stomach,
through which was forced a salty
solution.
"It was like drinking the Dead
Sea. I told the nurse that it went
into my lungs, and I coughed,"
Dawani said in the statement.
Another inmate. Attiye
Sawarka, 34, gave Tsemel a
statement charging that guards
beat him in the abdomen until he
agreed to eat rice and milk.
Tsemel,who visited Nafha yes-
the 48 remaining in
mates there told her they will not
end their hunger strike until their
demands to be transferred are
met. Prisoners have complained
that they are suffering in 100-
degree desert heat in over
crowded cells with inadequate
ventilation.
About 300 Arab protestors
staged a sit-in yesterday at the
International Red Cross head
quarters in East Jerusalem, de
manding an independent inves
tigation into the deaths. The In
terior Ministry, which governs
the prison services, said it will
conduct its own investigation.
