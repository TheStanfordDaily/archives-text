## FBI to investigate Civiletti 
### Ronald Ostrow The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — FBI Director William
Webster and Michael Shaheen Jr., the Department
of Justice's chief internal investigator, mapped
plans yesterday for determining whether Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti obstructed justice in
the Billy Carter case.
In conducting the unusual investigation, Sha
heen intends to scrap his office's standard practice
of relying heavily on sworn affidavits, it was
learned. Instead, FBI agents will conduct exten
sive interviews with officials and others concerned.
Reliance on such affidavits in previous investiga
tions by Shaheen's Office of Professional Respon
sibility has been criticized by some members of
Congress on the grounds that the procedure was
not as penetrating and rigorous as face-to-face
questioning.
Shaheen last week announced his investigation

into whether Civiletti violated the law or broke
Department of Justice regulations when he raised
the subject of the Billy Carter case in a June 17
Oval Office meeting with President Jimmy Carter.
Civiletti acknowledged the exchange after first
telling reporters that he had not talked to anyone in
the White House about the case. Civiletti disclosed
his role when Lloyd Cutler, presidential counsel,
advised him that President Carter had made a
memo of the brief conversation.
Despite the internal investigation and an inquiry
by a special Senate judiciary subcommittee,
Civiletti is adhering to plans to leave Thursday on a
19-day trip to Hawaii. Australia and New Zealand,
said Robert Smith, a Justice Department spokes
man.
Civiletti said he told the president that he
thought Billy Carter had been foolish and should
have registered as a foreign agent for Libya "long
ago."
