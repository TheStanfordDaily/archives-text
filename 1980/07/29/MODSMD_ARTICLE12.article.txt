WASHINGTON — The re
bellious group of House Democ
rats leading the "dump Carter"
movement announced yesterday
they have lined up $200,000 to
fund a crash campaign aimed at
opening the Democratic presi
dential nomination to candidates
other than President Jimmy Car
ter and Sen. Edward Kennedy.
The three dozen House mem
bers working to expand the par
ty's choices said they have
formed a "committee for an
Open Convention," which will
lobby convention delegates and
party leaders in the two weeks
before the convention opens in
New York.
Working with some $200,000
in pledges already rounded up by
Arnold Picker, a California
Democrat who started a "dump
Carter" effort of his own earlier
this month, the House Democ
rats plan to set up offices in
Washington and New York to
begin contacting delegates.
The House group, made up
mainly of junior Democrats who
have little influence or recogni
tion beyond their own congres
sional districts, also began to line
up backing from some senior
party officials.
Govs. Hugh Carey of New
York and Richard Lamm of Col

orado both expressed support
for the "open convention" idea,
and suggested it will be a major
topic among Democratic gover
nors at a national governors'
conference in Denver next week.
At least three prominent
Democratic senators — Gaylord
Nelson of Wisconsin, Patrick
Moynihan of New York, and
Henry "Scoop" Jackson of
Washington — also called for the
convention delegates to consider
alternatives to Carter and Ken
nedy.
This came after a Philadelphia

Democrat. S. Harrison "Sonny"
Dogole, said Sunday he would
form a separate committee de
signed to make Jackson the
Democratic nominee. Jackson
declined either to embrace or re
ject Dogole's efforts on his be
half.
It is still not clear whether any
of these campaigns will be able to
keep the nomination out of Car
ter's hands. In primaries and
caucuses this spring, the presi
dent won the support of about
2000 national delegates, some
300 more than he needs to win.
