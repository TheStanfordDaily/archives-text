WASHINGTON â€” Produc
tivity fell at a steep 3.1 percent
annual rate during the second
quarter this year, as the recession
triggered a record drop in
economic output, the govern
ment reported yesterday.
The spring productivity drop
marked the sixth straight quarter
that the measure of economic ef
ficiency registered a decline, the
longest such string since the
1974-75 recession, the Labor
Department said.
The latest report pushed the
productivity rate for the private
economy to its lowest level since

1976.
Excluding agriculture, pro
ductivity for non-farm business
dropped by an annual rate of 4.1
percent during the second quar
ter, the largest decline in six
years.
The U.S. rate of productivity
growth has been sluggish in rela
tion to most other industrialized
nations for much of the past de
cade.
The Labor Department said
the productivity decline in the
second quarter resulted from a
record 12.5 percent drop in out
put and a 9.7 percent fall in paid
working hours.
