Carter sweating it . . .
President Jimmy Carter wipes the sweat from his face as he is
introduced to a fund raising barbecue at the home of Dale Sights in
Robards, Kentucky. In addition to the summer heat of the Southern
campaign trail, Carter has also been experiencing a lot of political
heat lately as federal investigations of his brother Billy 's dealings with
the Libyan government continue.
