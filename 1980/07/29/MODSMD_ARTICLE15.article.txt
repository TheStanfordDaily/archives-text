## Presidential intrigue 
### 
1 enthusiastically join in the
unanimity of delight at the as
cension of Donald Kennedy to
the office ot University president
this I riday. He is a proven leader
with a sincere concern for the
good of the students, and I must
add that I am among the greatest
fans of his now-famous sense of
humor.
Kennedy's 20 years as one of
Stanford's most popular profes
sors provide an academic out
look and rapport with students
which are invaluable to a presi
dent.
A successful year as provost
proves that he can handle the in
ternal University administration,
and his brief stint with the fed
eral government gives him the
nationwide outside contacts
necessary to maintain the Uni
versity's influence.
Considering all of these qual
ifications. Kennedy seemed like
the logical choice to succeed
President Richard Lyman when
the Board of Trustees made its
decision in June. In fact, logical
isn't the word, obvious is more
appropriate. Come to think of it.
Stanlord University, just who
were you trying to fool?
I mean, you go and tie up the
chair ot our Religious Studies
Department as head of the
"Presidential Search Commit
tee." whose outcome is 'a
foregone conclusion.
You build up all this suspense
from the day President Lyman
announces his resignation, and
then make the dramatic an
nouncement tin the eve of com
mencement. Everyone wanted
Kennedy, and we all knew it
would he Kennedy, so why didn't
we just get it over with?

And vou, Don Kennedy, you
had a pretty good idea which way
things were going, didn't you? I
mean, one doesn't just go and
resign from the highest govern
ment position in one's field for
nothing. You knew., didn't you?
No one turns down the presi
dency of Yale to he vice
president of anything. You come
back to Stanford to he president.
Considering Kennedy's "pres
idential" qualifications, I'm
wondering what kind of a "deal"
had to he made a year ago to get
him to take the No. 2 spot. Just
what constitutional powers did
Lyman have to concede in the
bargain? Did Kennedy want the
power to appoint high-level
academic officials? Surely he
wouldn't he a do-nothing vice
president.
And arc the rumors true?
Were the late-night closed-door
negotiations headed by a high
ranking official with a European
accent and the initials U.K.?
Some say that the two almost ag
reed to an unprecedented "co
presidency" before Kennedy
backed out because "it would
never work."
And most important, what
does this say about the judgment
and leadership abilities of the
men involved? Are these the
kind of people we want running
our University?
The answer is yes. I only hope
for the sake of my diploma that I
have accurately assessed the new
president's now-famous sense of
humor.
Best of luck. President Ken
nedy.
