## Mark Sinz Campaign reform contradictory

Now that Ronald Reagan has
emerged from the Republican
Convention in Detroit, he will
receive plenty of financial help in
his run for the presidency.
Under existing federal elec
tion laws Reagan and President
Jimmy Carter, as the Democra
tic nominee, are each allowed
to spend just under S3O million
until the November election.
But Reagan supporters such as
Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)
and Harrison Schmitt (R-N.M.)
have formed their own indepen
dent campaign organizations for
Reagan. It is estimated that such
groups could raise as much as an
additional $30 million on
Reagan's behalf.
Such independent spending is
perfectly legal provided the fun
draisers are truly independent.
But some feel they are not.
The Federal Election Commis
sion filed suit in United States
District Court against the re
election organizations under the
campaign reform law.
Parts of the original campaign
reform law of 1974 have already
been declared unconstitutional
by the Supreme Court. In
Buckley vs. Valeo, the Court
noted that the act's limitations
on independent expenditures
"place substantial and direct re
strictions on the ability of candi

dates. citizens and associations
to engage in protected political
expression, restrictions that the
First Amendment cannot toler
ate."
But the FEC suit will likely at
tack the independence of the
groups by contending that they
are led by long-time Reagan
friends. These groups would thus
violate the reform law because
they were not independent.
The Election Commission
complaint should be denied. If
the complaint is upheld in court
it will lessen political debate and
competition in presidential elec
tions.
Already incumbents enjoy
substantial advantages in run
ning for re-election. An incum
bent's name and face are spread
across the front page of news
papers and magazines around
the country. Very well, this may
come with the office.
But restricting the amount of
money that a challenger and his
supporters can spend inhibits the
candidate's right and his suppor
ters' right to compete for adver
tising space the only way they
can. with money from political
contributions. This hurts not
only Reagan's candidacy but that
of John Anderson, Ed Clark and
others who choose to run for
president.

Ironically, the FEC complaint
is attempting to stifle just what
the 1974 law was intended to en
courage: small contributions
from many supporters.
Since the 1974 restrictions
went into effect, the Republicans
have shown themselves to be
more inventive and successful
with mass mailings to solicit con
tributions than the Democrats.
A 1979 study by the Harvard
School of Government confirms
that conservative candidates
tend to rely on direct-mail fun
draising about twice as often as
liberal candidates.
The independent organiza
tions headed by Helms and
Schmitt specialize in just this
kind of targeted mass-appeal
fundraising.
It can only be hoped that the
Federal Court will not seek to
arbitrarily decide who is an inde
pendent Reagan friend and who
is not.
Ruling against the FEC com
plaint will allow candidates to get
their message to the voters. If the
complaint is upheld, it is the vot
ers who will once again have to
bear the cost.
(Mark Sinz is a member of the
class of' 79 and will be a graduate
student in politics at Princeton
next fall.)
