## Retrospective glance at the 20th Century 
### 
LOS ANGELES, 2033 A.D.
— I was looking through my
scrapbook of clippings the other
day, and 1 was amazed at some of
the troubles Americans had last
century.
Can you believe that we used
to buy our fuel from countries
that hated us? They would
charge us exorbitant prices, and
then threaten not to sell it at all.
Once they even rounded up a
bunch of Americans living over
there — about 50 of them I think
— and kept them in captivity for
two and a half years!
We should all rejoice that we
don't have to put up with that
anymore. There is little worse
than being dependent on
anothercountry for something as
important as our energy.
It's been almost 25 years since
we started using nuclear power
as part of our energy program.
'That miracle of splitting the
atom helped save our country.
No more ridiculous prices, no
more embargoes, no more going
to war to make sure that our
country has the energy we need.
Yet can you believe that there
are still a lot of people who want
us to stop using our nuclear reac
tors?
We've only had eight acci
dents — and only three that you
could really call "major" — yet
there are many who are dead set
against nuclear power.
It's people like them that hurt
our country. Can't they see that
nuclear power is one of the best
things that could have possibly
happened to us? My god, they
must be completely blind to the
cheap energy it gives us. not to
mention some very attractive
fringe benefits. What we need is
more, not less.
For instance, in the last acci
dent— at our downtown plant —
250 men became sterile. If we
could only increase that number
by, say, a factor of 10, we might
have our population problem
solved.
I understand there were a few
deaths also, but not enough to
make a sizeable dent.
When Three-Mile Island had
its fourth leak, many of the citi
zens of Harrisburg began to emit
a reddish glow, especially from
the face and eyes. Obviously this
curious effect took a little getting
used to, but ultimately the city
was able to reduce its consump
tion of electricity by nearly a
third. Street lights were cut way
back, becoming completely
needless on busy holiday shop
ping nights. The company that
made night lights went out of
business.
The neighborhood disco al
lowed its red citizens in free and
even employed many of them to

stand on the dance floor and spin
around.
For nearly 75 years, this coun
try has been trying to solve the
problems of over-population
and runaway energy usage. It
took nuclear power to provide a
feasible, viable and effective sol
ution.
Yet it doesn't stop there. Nuc
lear power goes far beyond such
simple amenities. Radioactivity
can and already has begun to
change many of our most
dangerous social norms.
Remember when it was a
dreadful thing when a man
started to lose his hair? These
days, half the men over 30 have
no hair, and it is a rarity to see a
man my age with anything more
than a few strands on the legs.
But do we care? Heck no! Bald
ness is so common now that it is
no longer a social embarrass
ment to anyone. That's healthy!
Some of the women still resort
to buying wigs, but we're work
ing on that.
And remember when
everyone wanted to get suntans
in the summer because they all
thought it looked so nice. Well
now that we have that greenish
tint in our pigmentation no one
ever worries about getting a tan.
The amount of skin cancer cases
from too much sun is down
dramatically.
That's healthy!!
Back in our prime, the fellows
and I used to walk down the
street eyeing the young ladies.
We were often hard on the unat
tractive ones. We probably gave
some of them inferiority com
plexes. But now there is no such
thing as ugly. Some of our ap
pearances today are so com
pletely unprecedented, that old
standards of pretty and ugly sim
ple do not apply.
And believe me, that's one as
pect of society we can do with
out. Take it from me: 30 years
ago, 1 was prematurely gray and
overweight and endured the
stigma that society gave to gray,
fat people. But now I'm just as
indescribable as everyone else.
And I don't care what anyone
else says — I like my second
nose.

A lot of the effects of radiation
are still in the planning stages.
Scientists are daily coming up
with new effects. All they have to
do is perfect them, assuming the
protesters (I bet they're Com
munists) do not succeed in their
absurd plot to abolish all use of
nuclear power.
If you ask me, they are our
biggest problem, not a few
measly drops of Uranium 238.
They want to halt one of the most
exciting ventures this country
has embarked on since the kid
napping of the Ayatollah Kho
meini.
That is completely un-
American. 1 continually ask
them how they can possibly love
their country and still want to
carry out their treacherous plot.
They always answer the same
way: "WV have a right to live our
own life, blah, hlah, blah.
Well what about our country
and its right to prosper? Doesn't
that count for anything? Don't
they care about our country and
its democratic principles? It ap
pears not. So they must be
Communists.
To all of you righteous Ameri
cans, I say we cannot let the
Communists get in the way.
Whatever it takes, they must be
stopped.
Any true American would ag
ree.
Just consider some of the pos
sibilities nuclear radiation offers
us. The list is endless. Human life
can go where it has never gone
before.
On experiments with laborat
ory animals, scientists have wit
nessed the creation of extra eyes,
limbs, rainbow-colored skin to
nes, even heads actually growing
larger.
One scientist suspects that as
the head enlarges, so does the
brain. Our entire intellectual
ability could skyrocket. We
might even find a way to get
those Communists to think right.
We certainly would be able to
alleviate our problem of un
employment. All these new
types of humans require study
ing, cataloguing, and most of all,
displaying! Human zoos would
need to hire as many attendants

as animal zoos. And you can bet
that every town will want to have
one. Unfortunately — and this
might be the worst things about
nuclear power — freak shows at
circuses might not be quite the
same. But really now — don't
you think that's a small price to
pay for such a miracle as nuclear
radiation?
Another scientist believes that
with the proper combination ot
gamma rays and x-rays, all pig
mentation could be univer
salized.
The consequences of such a
breakthrough would be magnifi
cent. For centuries, nations have
been at war over racial issues.
The color of one's skin has been
a source of intense emotion and
violence for as long as I have
been covering news events. It is
one of our worst unnecessary
evils. Universalization of skin
color just might bring peace to
this planet at last. No more wars,
no more bombs, and best of all.
no more fear of radioactive fall
out infesting our land and popu
lation.
It would be glorious.
Today, I am prepared to prop
ose a schedule of mass
production for the government
to institute immediately.
This will be done with im
maculate attention to detail.
After all. safety is our number
one concern.
Each community will set up its
own radio center. There, citizens
can get their weekly alpha-ray
doses, buy their One-A-Day
Photons plus Boron, and any
other essential products they
might need — plutonium boos
ters, tritium supplements, arti
cles of clothing to accommodate
seven fingers, three legs, two el
bows. or whatever. We will also
offer a free booklet of minimum
daily adult requirements.
In case we still encounter
trouble from that Communist
group, each community will he
outfitted with a SWAT team,
whose sole duty is to ensure that
all citizensget their chance to use
the facilities. Even though the
Communists may not look any
different from us normal folk, it
will be easy to tell them apart.

and enforcement should he rela
tively simple. Just look at it this
way. Anyone who would not
want to participate in this grand
unprecedented experience . .
must he a Communist. They will
all he hauled off to the radio
center's holding station, where
they will he juiced up intravene
ously.
Simple hut effective.
Our community could set up
its radio center easily — in the
\ acant lot next door to the fallout
shelter.
The most exciting part of all ol
this is that we are really still new
in the field of nuclear radiation.
There is so much for us to learn,
so much for us to experience. It
boggles the mind that some
people could have the audacity
to want to stop all ot it.
Most of the Communists are
still advocating that old clunker,
solar power. But we still have the
same problem with the solar
power that we did 15 years ago:
it takes so darn long to develop
and implement — about 20
years.
This really might he our tinal
frontier. The extent of human
evolution, the limits of mutation.
And the best thing about it is the
fact that it things don't work out
well, we can just stop. The effects
of our experimentation will be
completely gone in a generation
or four.
But the Communists are shut
ting their eyes to all ot these ex
citing possibilities just because ol
a few measly generations. I really
hope we won't be forced to take
military action against them, hut
we surely cannot allow them to
stand in our way. Who are they
to deny us entrance into what
might be the threshold ot a new
race ol humans . . . radiomen.
112 or those of you who are still a
wee bit skeptical. 1 leave you
with this parting thought: Think
of how nice it would be to say. in
reference to your mother, "She
must have eyes in the back of her
head'' . . . and mean it.
