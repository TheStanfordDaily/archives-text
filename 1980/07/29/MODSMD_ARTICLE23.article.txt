# 'Rail renaissance' may be wave of the future
## 
### Kdward Asiano Staff Writer 
A step backwards may he the
wave of the future for California
commuters. A passenger "rail
renaissance" is taking shape.
With the prices of gas well
over a dollar per gallon and
highways costing $1 million per
mile, governments and citizens
alike are looking for transporta
tion alternatives.
"The beauty of the railroad is
that the rails are in place and it's
just a matter of their best use."
says Frank Lanza of the State
Department of Transportation.
In February, the department
published a rail plan describing
what is in store for the state over
the next few years.
The continuation of the
Southern Pacific (S.P.) commute
run, from San Francisco to San
Jose, was a high priority. De
scribed as "a milestone for pas
senger rail serv ice in California,"
by the Department ol Transpor
tation Director, Adriana Gian
turco, a contract was agreed
upon bv the state and San Fran
cisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, subsidizing the
S.P. commute service for the
next 10 years.
"The only commute service in
existence in California, and it
would have gone out of business.
We've managed to keep it." said
Gianturco. "At the same time,
we've got a pioneering effort
going in Southern California to
institute new commuter rail ser
vice. A ruling from the Public
Utilities Commission compels
new service there, and if that
holds up in court .. . we'll have
operations in both Northern and
Southern California."

In Southern California, four
lines would connect Los Angeles
with Orange County, Riverside,
San Bernadino and Oxnard. In
addition, many inter-city runs
have been proposed, including
one from Sacramento to Los
Angeles.
The railroads, however, are
not enthusiastic. Traditionally,
rail passenger services have not
been profitable. This year, S.P.
estimates an $11.5 million com
mute run deficit.
Jerry Pera, manager of Com
mute Services at Southern
Pacific, explains, "transit sys
tems all lose money, by that I
mean operating costs always ex
ceed the revenues they generate.
Otherwise, you have to raise the
fares so high, nobody can use the
system."
That is why S.P. has been battl
ing in court for years to discon
tinue the service, and why they
were delighted to sign the con
tract. effective July I. 1980.
The agreement calls for $250
million over the next 1 0 years to
balance S.P.'s deficit, upgrade
services and provide new
locomotives and passenger
coaches.
Of the $11.5 million deficit
this year, the federal govern
ment's Urban Mass Transit Ad
ministration will provide $2 mill
ion in grants while S.P. contri
butes $400,000 annually for the
next five years. The state then
splits the remaining $9.1 million
with the three local counties,
who divide their portions on a
volume of ridership per county
basis.
CalTrans, the state agency in
charge, will gradually buy new
equipment, locomotives and

passenger coaches, to replace the
outdated S.P. equipment, even
tually increasing the number of
trains and the commuter capac
ity.
Federal agencies will prov ide
80 percent of all equipment
costs, although all new acquisi
tions will be owned by the state.
S.P. will receive $472,000 a
year in rental fees for the use of
their system, but is responsible
for maintenance of the track and
cars for three years.
All the parties involved agreed
the contract was beneficial. "We
got all the key things we wanted,
and they got the key things they
wanted," said Gianturco.
"That's the best kind of negotia
tion."
Discrepancies arose, however,
when the significance of the con
tract was projected. Predicts
Pera, "in the years to come,
they're going to have to replace
track, ties, stations, locomotives,
cars . . . that's why. yes. we were
happy to get out of the business,
because we faced that. In 10
years, if we had to replace the N7
cars we've got, and 24 locomo
tives, tracks and ties, we're talk
ing about $200 to $300 million,
and so CalTrans is going to pay
that."
Pera continued,"l believe that
once the government realizes
just what it is costing them,
they're going to take the whole
business and buy the line."
"Maybe that's what they are
hoping," said Gianturco. "As a
matter of fact, looking back over
the negotiations, it seems to me.
that is something they were ini
tially saying, that they wanted us
to buy the whole thing, lock,
stock and barrel. We don't think

that's necessary, and that's not
part of the final agreement," she
said.
"If you allow something to de
teriorate, to reconstruct it is tre
mendously expensive, hut if you
put in the day to day mainte
nance. which up until now S.P.
has been . . . and we expect them
to continue to do, then you're
not talking about huge costs to
bring it back to what it was."
Gianturco added.
Even a possibility of BART
using the right-of-way was dis
cussed. "The transit planners of
the region may well decide ... to
run BART all the way around
the bay. They wouldn't have to
condemn houses . . . they could
run BART trains down there at
100 miles per hour." suggested
Pera. "I don't know what the ad
vantage, frankly, would be to
us," replied (Jianturco.
The basis for disagreement
stems from differing views on
what is owed the commuter. As
Lanza states, "the railroad
(commute service) is operating
as a public utility, and the com
muter should have a right to a
transportation alternative ... if
necessary we'll enter into a con
tract to make sure this is con
tinued."
S.P. however, feels no obliga
tion to run a service that loses
money. As Pera said, "it would
be better from our standpoint, it
they bought that whole right
of-way . . . then we could retain
just enough property to have a
third rail to run our freight trains
. . . and you wouldn't have to
have this marriage of a private
company and a government
agency."
What riders can expect is a re
worked schedule which has been
agreed upon, although, "it's not

firm yet." The schedule's pre
dicted release ranges from this
October, to within the next year.
The schedule patches "glaring
holes," and provides more trains
for reverse commute (riders
moving in the opposite direction
from the mainstream of com
muters).
"We would also hope to see
improvements in the service it
self ... a little spiffier looking
cars, the possibility of adding a
cafe car... to serve coffee in the
morning and drinks in the after
noon, things like that." says
Gianturco.
An improved bus feeder sys
tem can also be expected. "The
local transit companies will
reexamine their schedules so
they will mesh better with the
commuter rail service," states
Gianturco.
Bill Sullivan. Transit Market
ing Manager for Santa Clara
County Transit, agrees, "within
the year, you'll see a large im
provement ... to all of the S.P.
depots in Santa Clara county."
for Stanford students, that
means excellent access to the
campus.
The improvements will be li
mited for the next two or three
years, while new equipment is
delivered. "C'alTrans was . . .
able to buy a commute service
that was not deteriorating, that
was still operating on time, they
were one of the lucky ones."
I'era said.
The service does offer a reli
able transportation alternative
for Peninsula travel. In addition,
there now seems, for the first
time, to be a real desire to cater
to the public needs.
As Pera asked, "why pay for a
car and public transport?"

(commute service) is operating

muter should have a right to a

necessary we'll enter into a con

tinued."
S.P. however, feels no obliga

money. As Pera said, "it would
be better from our standpoint, it
they bought that whole right
of-way . . . then we could retain
just enough property to have a
third rail to run our freight trains
. . . and you wouldn't have to

With rising gas prices and crowded highways, new commuter solutions are being sought. The newest and
most likely form of commuter transportation will he by rail. The government is now looking into helping
finance a rebirth of the trains running in the area.
A step backwards may he the
wave of the future for California
commuters. A passenger "rail
renaissance" is taking shape.
With the prices of gas well
over a dollar per gallon and
highways costing $1 million per
mile, governments and citizens
alike are looking for transporta
tion alternatives.
"The beauty of the railroad is
that the rails are in place and it's
just a matter of their best use."
says Frank Lanza of the State
Department of Transportation.
In February, the department
published a rail plan describing
what is in store for the state over
the next few years.
The continuation of the
Southern Pacific (S.P.) commute
run, from San Francisco to San
Jose, was a high priority. De
scribed as "a milestone for pas
senger rail serv ice in California,"
by the Department ol Transpor
tation Director, Adriana Gian
turco, a contract was agreed
upon bv the state and San Fran
cisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, subsidizing the
S.P. commute service for the
next 10 years.
"The only commute service in
existence in California, and it
would have gone out of business.
We've managed to keep it." said
Gianturco. "At the same time,
we've got a pioneering effort
going in Southern California to
institute new commuter rail ser
vice. A ruling from the Public
Utilities Commission compels
new service there, and if that
holds up in court .. . we'll have
operations in both Northern and
Southern California."

In Southern California, four
lines would connect Los Angeles
with Orange County, Riverside,
San Bernadino and Oxnard. In
addition, many inter-city runs
have been proposed, including
one from Sacramento to Los
Angeles.
The railroads, however, are
not enthusiastic. Traditionally,
rail passenger services have not
been profitable. This year, S.P.
estimates an $11.5 million com
mute run deficit.
Jerry Pera, manager of Com
mute Services at Southern
Pacific, explains, "transit sys
tems all lose money, by that I
mean operating costs always ex
ceed the revenues they generate.
Otherwise, you have to raise the
fares so high, nobody can use the
system."
That is why S.P. has been battl
ing in court for years to discon
tinue the service, and why they
were delighted to sign the con
tract. effective July I. 1980.
The agreement calls for $250
million over the next 1 0 years to
balance S.P.'s deficit, upgrade
services and provide new
locomotives and passenger
coaches.
Of the $11.5 million deficit
this year, the federal govern
ment's Urban Mass Transit Ad
ministration will provide $2 mill
ion in grants while S.P. contri
butes $400,000 annually for the
next five years. The state then
splits the remaining $9.1 million
with the three local counties,
who divide their portions on a
volume of ridership per county
basis.
CalTrans, the state agency in
charge, will gradually buy new
equipment, locomotives and

passenger coaches, to replace the
outdated S.P. equipment, even
tually increasing the number of
trains and the commuter capac
ity.
Federal agencies will prov ide
80 percent of all equipment
costs, although all new acquisi
tions will be owned by the state.
S.P. will receive $472,000 a
year in rental fees for the use of
their system, but is responsible
for maintenance of the track and
cars for three years.
All the parties involved agreed
the contract was beneficial. "We
got all the key things we wanted,
and they got the key things they
wanted," said Gianturco.
"That's the best kind of negotia
tion."
Discrepancies arose, however,
when the significance of the con
tract was projected. Predicts
Pera, "in the years to come,
they're going to have to replace
track, ties, stations, locomotives,
cars . . . that's why. yes. we were
happy to get out of the business,
because we faced that. In 10
years, if we had to replace the N7
cars we've got, and 24 locomo
tives, tracks and ties, we're talk
ing about $200 to $300 million,
and so CalTrans is going to pay
that."
Pera continued,"l believe that
once the government realizes
just what it is costing them,
they're going to take the whole
business and buy the line."
"Maybe that's what they are
hoping," said Gianturco. "As a
matter of fact, looking back over
the negotiations, it seems to me.
that is something they were ini
tially saying, that they wanted us
to buy the whole thing, lock,
stock and barrel. We don't think

that's necessary, and that's not
part of the final agreement," she
said.
"If you allow something to de
teriorate, to reconstruct it is tre
mendously expensive, hut if you
put in the day to day mainte
nance. which up until now S.P.
has been . . . and we expect them
to continue to do, then you're
not talking about huge costs to
bring it back to what it was."
Gianturco added.
Even a possibility of BART
using the right-of-way was dis
cussed. "The transit planners of
the region may well decide ... to
run BART all the way around
the bay. They wouldn't have to
condemn houses . . . they could
run BART trains down there at
100 miles per hour." suggested
Pera. "I don't know what the ad
vantage, frankly, would be to
us," replied (Jianturco.
The basis for disagreement
stems from differing views on
what is owed the commuter. As
Lanza states, "the railroad
(commute service) is operating

tions will be owned by the state.
S.P. will receive $472,000 a
year in rental fees for the use of
their system, but is responsible
for maintenance of the track and
cars for three years.
All the parties involved agreed
the contract was beneficial. "We
got all the key things we wanted,
and they got the key things they
wanted," said Gianturco.
"That's the best kind of negotia
tion."
Discrepancies arose, however,
when the significance of the con
tract was projected. Predicts
Pera, "in the years to come,
they're going to have to replace
track, ties, stations, locomotives,
cars . . . that's why. yes. we were
happy to get out of the business,
because we faced that. In 10
years, if we had to replace the N7
cars we've got, and 24 locomo
tives, tracks and ties, we're talk
ing about $200 to $300 million,
and so CalTrans is going to pay
that."
Pera continued,"l believe that
once the government realizes
just what it is costing them,
they're going to take the whole
business and buy the line."
"Maybe that's what they are
hoping," said Gianturco. "As a
matter of fact, looking back over
the negotiations, it seems to me.
that is something they were ini
tially saying, that they wanted us
to buy the whole thing, lock,
stock and barrel. We don't think

that's necessary, and that's not
part of the final agreement," she
said.
"If you allow something to de
teriorate, to reconstruct it is tre
mendously expensive, hut if you
put in the day to day mainte
nance. which up until now S.P.
has been . . . and we expect them
to continue to do, then you're
not talking about huge costs to
bring it back to what it was."
Gianturco added.
Even a possibility of BART
using the right-of-way was dis
cussed. "The transit planners of
the region may well decide ... to
run BART all the way around
the bay. They wouldn't have to
condemn houses . . . they could
run BART trains down there at
100 miles per hour." suggested
Pera. "I don't know what the ad
vantage, frankly, would be to
us," replied (Jianturco.
The basis for disagreement
stems from differing views on
what is owed the commuter. As
Lanza states, "the railroad
(commute service) is operating
as a public utility, and the com
muter should have a right to a
transportation alternative ... if
necessary we'll enter into a con
tract to make sure this is con
tinued."
S.P. however, feels no obliga
tion to run a service that loses
money. As Pera said, "it would
be better from our standpoint, it
they bought that whole right
of-way . . . then we could retain
just enough property to have a
third rail to run our freight trains
. . . and you wouldn't have to
have this marriage of a private
company and a government
agency."
What riders can expect is a re
worked schedule which has been
agreed upon, although, "it's not

firm yet." The schedule's pre
dicted release ranges from this
October, to within the next year.
The schedule patches "glaring
holes," and provides more trains
for reverse commute (riders
moving in the opposite direction
from the mainstream of com
muters).
"We would also hope to see
improvements in the service it
self ... a little spiffier looking
cars, the possibility of adding a
cafe car... to serve coffee in the
morning and drinks in the after
noon, things like that." says
Gianturco.
An improved bus feeder sys
tem can also be expected. "The
local transit companies will
reexamine their schedules so
they will mesh better with the
commuter rail service," states
Gianturco.
Bill Sullivan. Transit Market
ing Manager for Santa Clara
County Transit, agrees, "within
the year, you'll see a large im
provement ... to all of the S.P.
depots in Santa Clara county."
for Stanford students, that
means excellent access to the
campus.
The improvements will be li
mited for the next two or three
years, while new equipment is
delivered. "C'alTrans was . . .
able to buy a commute service
that was not deteriorating, that
was still operating on time, they
were one of the lucky ones."
I'era said.
The service does offer a reli
able transportation alternative
for Peninsula travel. In addition,
there now seems, for the first
time, to be a real desire to cater
to the public needs.
As Pera asked, "why pay for a
car and public transport?"

With rising gas prices and crowded highways, new commuter solutions are being sought. The newest and
most likely form of commuter transportation will he by rail. The government is now looking into helping
finance a rebirth of the trains running in the area.
A step backwards may he the
wave of the future for California
commuters. A passenger "rail
renaissance" is taking shape.
With the prices of gas well
over a dollar per gallon and
highways costing $1 million per
mile, governments and citizens
alike are looking for transporta
tion alternatives.
"The beauty of the railroad is
that the rails are in place and it's
just a matter of their best use."
says Frank Lanza of the State
Department of Transportation.
In February, the department
published a rail plan describing
what is in store for the state over
the next few years.
The continuation of the
Southern Pacific (S.P.) commute
run, from San Francisco to San
Jose, was a high priority. De
scribed as "a milestone for pas
senger rail serv ice in California,"
by the Department ol Transpor
tation Director, Adriana Gian
turco, a contract was agreed
upon bv the state and San Fran
cisco, San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties, subsidizing the
S.P. commute service for the
next 10 years.
"The only commute service in
existence in California, and it
would have gone out of business.
We've managed to keep it." said
Gianturco. "At the same time,
we've got a pioneering effort
going in Southern California to
institute new commuter rail ser
vice. A ruling from the Public
Utilities Commission compels
new service there, and if that
holds up in court .. . we'll have
operations in both Northern and
Southern California."

In Southern California, four
lines would connect Los Angeles
with Orange County, Riverside,
San Bernadino and Oxnard. In
addition, many inter-city runs
have been proposed, including
one from Sacramento to Los
Angeles.
The railroads, however, are
not enthusiastic. Traditionally,
rail passenger services have not
been profitable. This year, S.P.
estimates an $11.5 million com
mute run deficit.
Jerry Pera, manager of Com
mute Services at Southern
Pacific, explains, "transit sys
tems all lose money, by that I
mean operating costs always ex
ceed the revenues they generate.
Otherwise, you have to raise the
fares so high, nobody can use the
system."
That is why S.P. has been battl
ing in court for years to discon
tinue the service, and why they
were delighted to sign the con
tract. effective July I. 1980.
The agreement calls for $250
million over the next 1 0 years to
balance S.P.'s deficit, upgrade
services and provide new
locomotives and passenger
coaches.
Of the $11.5 million deficit
this year, the federal govern
ment's Urban Mass Transit Ad
ministration will provide $2 mill
ion in grants while S.P. contri
butes $400,000 annually for the
next five years. The state then
splits the remaining $9.1 million
with the three local counties,
who divide their portions on a
volume of ridership per county
basis.
CalTrans, the state agency in
charge, will gradually buy new
equipment, locomotives and

passenger coaches, to replace the
outdated S.P. equipment, even
tually increasing the number of
trains and the commuter capac
ity.
Federal agencies will prov ide
80 percent of all equipment
costs, although all new acquisi
tions will be owned by the state.
S.P. will receive $472,000 a
year in rental fees for the use of
their system, but is responsible
for maintenance of the track and
cars for three years.
