# Tony Roko: At 90, a quiet Stanford legend
## 
### Susie Oglesby Staff Writer 
Stanford has seen a lot of changes since 1907 and
there is one person who has seen them all. Former
Stanford employee, Tony Roko, age 90, still lives
on campus in a cottage hidden behind plant ser
vices.
"He's a legend," said Stanford Personnel Direc
tor Rob Parker. "For years. Stanford had an ar
rangement where employees were allowed to stay
on after retirement. Mr. Roko is most likely a car
ryover from the time when there wasn't anything
else around here. There were no welfare programs
and Stanford took care of its employees."
Roko came to California from Austria and
began work at Stanford 73 years ago. He did "all
kinds of work," he said. "There were no machines,
so we used horses and wagons. I dug ditches, put in
new pipelines ... I worked nine-hour days for
$ 1.75 a day."
Then 30 years ago Roko became a night watch
man and moved into the cottage where he lives
now. "You know, the kids play football, baseball,
and they stay after practice to take showers . . . you
have to stay there at nieht after they leave and turn

out the lights and lock doors."
Roko stopped working in 1970, but "they didn't
get rid of me . . . they let me live here free." The
University allowed him to stay for the past ten
years and even official documents refer to the land
on which he lives as "Tony's Plot." According to
Bob Young, Athletic Department Grounds Man
ager, "it's his until he dies."
The only time Roko has left his secluded plot
recently was when he had to have surgery and spent
45 days in a convalescent home afterward. Roko
said, "1 can't see very good and I can't hear you,"
but he added that he manages anyway. Although
he has no wife or family, he said that he has many
friends who visit him often. About three months
ago doctors discovered that he had cancer, so now
his friends are looking into a convalescent home for
him.
But, in the meantime, Roko is happily spending
his days in his garden. He said he had good luck this
year; "everything came out â€” the stringbeans, to
matoes, cucumbers, and zucchini. 1 have a hard
time when I plant. I get tired. I feel a lot better
when I sit down. He added in a still heavy Austrian
accent, "I'm too old. That's the problem with me.
But I'm not in a hurry, so I take it easy."
