Amidst the cacophony of San
Francisco sounds — hotel
strikes, construction work, traf
fic and even cable cars — the
melodies of the annual Munici
pal Railway Cable Car Bell Ring
ing Championship floated above
Union Square.
Hundreds of tourists and on
lookers gathered to cheer on the
cable car gripmen and the local
celebrities as they competed for
national fame, applause, and in
the case of the celebrities, gifts
for the charities of their choice.
Carl Payne. "World Champ
ion" cable car bell ringer in both
1977 and '78, made a dazzling
comeback to defeat last year's
champion, Michael McClure,
who placed third. Payne re
gained his title with a jazzy, syn
copated rhythm he played on a
motorized cable car.
"If I can do it, Muhammed Ali
can do it too!" Payne joked.
The contestants' tunes varied
in style and tempo as each per
formed a unique blend of cres
cendosand clangs. The winnerof
the celebrity competition added
a touch of class to his act by wear
ing a tuxedo and bringing along
two violinists for accompani
ment.
Both visitors and locals
thoroughly enjoyed the free
event, and everyone clapped
along with the ringing composi
tions.
"Clap your hands!" the master
of ceremonies encouraged,
"This is San Francisco!"
