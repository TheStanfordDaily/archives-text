# Donations help Viking
## 
### Jim Harrow Staff Writer 
At the end of this month the
third of four Viking spacecraft
that reached Mars in 1976 will
run out of attitude control gas,
leaving only the Viking 1 Lander
as the last working probe of the
Viking Mission according to Don
Bane, public information officer
for the Jet Propulsion Laborat
ory (JPL) in Pasadena.
The lander will continue send
ing weather and picture data
from Mars to JPL into 1990. But
there will not be enough funds to
process the data received from
Viking.
The San Francisco section of
the American Astronomical Soc
iety has organized a group calling
themselves the Viking Fund. The
goal of the Viking Fund is to
raise $1 million through private
contributions, then to donate

this money to NASA.
"The point of Viking Fund is
to show Congress that there are
people willing to put money be
hind the space movement and
that the American people are in
terested in a strong civilian space
program. There is a tremendous
amount of frustration with the
current U S space program,"
said Stan Kent, chairman of the
Viking Fund.
Boh Guccione, publisher of
Penthouse and OMNI magazines,
helped launch the Viking Fund
movement by providing free ad
vertising space in these
magazines. Readers responded
by contributing $50,000 and by
writing over 40,000 letters. Mar
tian Metals Company of Cedar
Park, Texas which makes minia
ture Martian models, has agreed
to donate 10 percent of its profits
from June to August to the Vik
ing Fund.
"What the United States has
to realize is that by sitting on the
fence, some one else will take the
lead in space exploration. The
Soviet Union has obviously
committed themselves to space.
The Soviet people say the reason
wc go into space is because it is
the natural thing to do," said,
Kent.
