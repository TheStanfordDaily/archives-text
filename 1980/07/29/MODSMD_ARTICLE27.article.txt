## movies Iron lillejord 'Dressed To Kill'— De Palma's superb gothic 
### 
Brian De Palma's Dressed to
Kill is the most exhilarating
American movie since Close En
counters of the Third Kind, and
many people who see it will hate
it. De Palma's out to scare the
absolute hell out of people here,
and he does it, magnificently.
Dressed To Kill is decidedly
not a safe evening. And it's illus
trative of the disheartening
paradox of American movies
that one of the few movies this
summer to evoke any pleasura
ble emotional response was
brushed off by many in the pre
view audience I saw it with.
And those who revere Hitch
cock may have their complaints,
too; the ads seem determined to
tout De Palma as the new Hitch
cock, even calling him the "mas
ter of the macabre." De Palma
indeed has borrowed from
Hitchcock here, but he's no sim
ple immitator: he takes Hitch
cock's tricks and infuses them
with his own jazzy style and glee
ful perversity. De Palma also
throws in his own tricks and
takes us right into his night
world: no Hitchcock gothic
plunges you into its vortex as
deeply as this one does.
The movie essentially playsoff
the same device Hitchcock
utilized in Psycho; after getting
you involved with a troubled
woman (Janet Leigh in Psycho,
Angie Dickinson here), she'>
abruptly, brutally killed, for no
apparent or logical reason. From
there, De Palma uses another
Hitchcock motif: a call girl who
witnesses the murder (Nancy Al
len) is a prime target both for the
killer and for the police, who re
gard her as the leading suspect.
With the help of the dead wo
man's son, Allen must prove her
innocence and avoid gruesome
death by discovering the identity
of the killer.
Dc Palma's at his most seduc
tive here; for all its gothic chills,
this is often a sexy movie. De
Palma's script plays like a series
of alluring set pieces, each with
its teasing opening and smashing
chaos. De Palma's visual mastery
fuses the set pieces together; his
technique keeps us in an almost
constant state of pleasurable un
certainty and terror.
De Palma's teasing is open
handed; we see all the tricks, but
we're stil fooled. The illusion/
reality shell game begins right
away: Dickinson takes a hot.
steamy shower — suddenly she's
grabbed. Her husband stands
shaving, doing nothing to help.
But it's only a dream, and De
Palma abruptly cuts to the
wham-bam- thank-you-ma'am
love making she's trying to men
tally escape from. Pino Donag
gio's score and Ralf Bode's

cinematography embellish the
movie's playtul/menacing tone.
Donaggio (who also did Car
rie's score) writes in a derivative
but sprightly style. His music
never approaches the height
John Williams' did in The Fury.
but it's often amusing (in Dic
kirrson's shower scene, the
music rises as she opens her
mouth — intentionally over
dramatic moans of pleasure) and
doesn't get in the way. Bode
gives the movie a shimmering
smoothness that reminds us of
his fine work in Saturday Night
Fever. His gliding camera gives
the movie an almost hallucinat
ory look. And Bode's surpris
ingly consistent; even in its
scenes of violence the movie
keeps its dieamy, disarming
beauty.
Although it's visually compel
ling. Dressed to Kill is probably
De Palma's most earthbound
movie; it's still got DePalma's
kinky sensibility, but there's a
chilling sanity to it, too. The
movie lacks the visual lunacy of
The Fury or Phantom of the
Paradise — there are no explo
sions of color or bodies blowing
up right and left.
But Dressed to Kill offers its
own pleasures. Dc Pakna'smuch
better with character develop
ment and story telling here;
while he's still not exceptional at
it.the improvement is dramatic.
In his last thriller. The Fury, De
Palma's inadequacies with simil
iar expository scenes left us so
thoroughly confused that the
movie's climax, for all its visual
power and brilliance, never
began to affect us the way it was
intended to.
De Palma seems to have sol
ved those problems now. He's
playing all of his scenes right to
the edge, no matter their tone.
The most startling example is a
wordless, lengthy seduction sequ
ence in the first half of the movie;
it often shows such dexterity and
control that I had to keep re
minding myself that De Palma
directed it.
In the sequence. De Palma
quickly establishes that Dickin
son is lonely and wants some

casual, passionate sex. for no
other reason than that she wants
some fun. Using tracking shots,
De Palma brings Dickinson and
a stranger (Ken Baker) together
in a kind of uncertain mating
dance set in an art gallery; they
pursue each other in a series of
sudden feints and retreats. The
sequence is almost too stylized
and it lasts a bit tot) long, but De
Palma redeems it with an explo
sive. fulfilling lovemaking scene.
Always the absurdist. DePalma
puncutates the sequence by hav
ing Dickinson discover that her
partner is a VD victim; that takes
care of any nascent romantic
feeling.
De Palma's just toy ing with us.
of course; he's playing with our
expectations. Even as he's relax
ing the pace, he's getting us more
involved in Dickenson's story,
leaving us unprepared for what
will follow. He lets the audience
get its bearing, and then he pro
ceeds to smash them up. When
the violence comes, we're left to
tally off balance: you can almost
hear De Palma laugh as he
pushes us off the edge. The
movie's last hour is a dazzling
exercise in nearly total terror,
broken up only by the briefest
moments to relax.
With Dickinson's demise.
Nancy Allen takes over the
movie. Allen's got the picture's
juiciest role, and she proves to be
a real charmer. Playing the stock
market and scheduling pick ups
even as she's being stalked by the
killer. Allen (who's De Palma's
wife) makes an unconventional
heroine; we care about her even
though she doesn't want our
sympathy. At first, Allen acts
demure, but it's just a put on;
she's street wise — she'll do
whatever it takes to survive.
(The New York setting is a big
plus. Everyone's hustling;
everyone's a little threatening.
Danger can come from any side,
and the audience instinctively re
sponds to this.) If Allen has to
crudely seduce psychiatrist
Michael Cainc to discover the
killer's identity, she'll do it —
and with an almost too delicious
pleasure. Allen, who gives off

heat constantly, makes the typi
cal Hitchcock ice maiden (the
Eva Marie Saint-type) look like
a hole in the screen.
You rarely get a good likeable
performance in a gothic: Allen's
is one of the few. It's an indica
tion of her considerable presence
that she also smoothly handles
the quirky, almost romantic rela
tionship her character has with
Keith Gordon, who plays Dic
k inson's teenage son.
De Palma, who's uncomforta
ble with the conventional man
woman movie relationship — or
any kind of traditional romance
(he conclusively proved that in
Obsession) — demonstrates in
the Allen-Gordon friendship
that he has "heart." but it's on
his own terms.
Gordon plays a kind of "nor
mal" version of the telekinetic
kids who populate Carrie and
The Fury (i.e., he's a genius but
he can't make things fly about).
Dc Palma has a fondness for
these wiz-kids whose genius
makes most people uncomforta
ble. and he lets his impersonal
guard down when Gordon's on
screen.

The other performances vary.
Dickinson's an inspired casting
choice; she's a sexier, more hot
blooded version of Janet Leigh,
and De Palma employs her skill
fully. Dennis Franz has a swag
gering. broadly comic role: he
and Allen ha\e some nice, off
color verbal sparring. Michael
Caine's performance is largely
unremarkable. De Palma's only
interested in getting a familiar
face and voice.
There are a few minor prob
lems. There's a half-hearted at
tempt to explain the movie's
plot. But even this sequence is
only a tease; in most movies,
such an explanation would signal
that the movie is over, but De
Palma's just getting your guard
down as he engineers the final
shock. (De Palma's endings keep
getting better and better; this
one — a magnificent reprise of
one of his favorite devices —
maybe his best yet.)
The easy critical reaction to
this movie will probably include
the innane statement "well, it's
just like Psycho," not admitting
that Dressed to Kill goes farther.
is visually stronger and more var
ied, has more sustained action
and is just plain scarier than
Psycho; in fact, this movie out
distances Psycho in nearly every
way.
We want gothics to be done in
striking and more exciting ways,
but we really don't expect to see
any truly original stories in the
genre, do we? Hitchcock was a
master, at least partly, because
he was able to fool us with essen
tially the same tricks and same
stories over and over again, and
we really shouldn't fault De
Palma for being the same kind of
slight-of-hand artist. The Time
review of this movie appeared to
be shocked that anyone but
Hitchcock would do a shower
scene.
In terms of what he really
wants toaccomplish, De Palma is
among the most uncomplicated
of directors; he is utterly without

pretense. What his work really
shares with Hitchcock is a com
pelte delight in successful audi
ence manipulation. Where De
Palma can be distinguished from
Hitchcock is in his sensibility.
For all of his love of perverse
shocks, Hitchcock was often a
genteel director. De Palma isn't
genteel; with him, we're left with
only his fondness for perversity
and his willingness to play scenes
right to the edge. De Palma
makes no moral judgment;
"good" characters are just as
likely to get the knife as "bad"
characters. The knowledge that
De Palma may not let us off the
hook — that we and his charac
ters may forever stay in the
nightmare — makes this movie
more vivid and more terrifying
than most Hitchcock gothics.
His sensibility is what makes
De Palma a great director of

thrillers, but it may be just what
keeps Dressed to Kill from be
coming the big hit its large ad
vertising campaign is trying very
hard to create. It's safer to know
that some characters will defi
nitely survive, but De Palma
stubbornly refuses to give such
guarantees, and it just may keep
him out of the winner's circle
again.
But the winner's circle is
where he belongs; even with its
familiar tricks. Dressed to Kill is
among the greatest virtuoso per
formances ever given by a direc
tor of a gothic. There are so few
people who are out there making
movies now, that you want to
stand up and applaud at the end
of Dressed to Kill. The movie
packs a charge; it explodes in
your head. You leave high, re
membering why you go to
movies and what sheer fun they
can be.
