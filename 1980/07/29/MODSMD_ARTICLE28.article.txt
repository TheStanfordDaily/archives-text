## 'Our Song': S.F.'s best offering this summer 
### 
In a summer of San Francisco
theater notable only for its
mediocrity, there is one bright
spot sufficient to keep even the
most downtrodden "Best of
Broadway" suscriber from giv
ing his tickets to the babysitter
and catching up on reruns of
'â€¢ Dallas."
Neil Simon's They're Playing
Our Song, at the Curran Theater
through August 24. seems to be
the best show in town: the
musical-comedy has been warm
ing the cockles of thousands of
Bay area theater-goers during its
oft-extended run.
But one should pause before
dropping the dishes and running
to stand in line for a couple of
balcony tickets. They're Playing
Our Song's success (curiously
undimmed by some wretched
TV' ads) is more the result of its
competitor's shortcomings and
its creators' surnames than its in
dividual merits as an example of
the genre of musical-comedy or
the work of its esteemed author
and composer.
The story should sound famil
iar: it is.
Boy meets girl, they fall in
love, quarrel, separate, and then
reunite years later as the older
and-wiser are wont to do. Neil
Simon keeps the script witty and
amusing with deft-manipulation
of New York sarcasm, good old
fashioned belly laughs, and in
tensely personal sensitivity and
sympathy for his characters and
audience. Marvin Hamlisch and
Carol Bayer Sager provide us
with some clever and peppy
tunes, including the tender bal
lad "Fallin," and the jazzy
"Working It Out." All numbers
and scenes are ably presented by
Victor Garber as Vernon the

boy composer. Marsh Skaggs as
Sonia the girl lyricist, and six
backup singers (three preppy
bovs and three pretty girls) who
enter periodically as the leads'
consciences in a cute musical
comedy takeoff on Sybil, 1 sup
pose.
All this is thoroughly enjoy
able and. although the second act
gets a bit fussy and bogs down in
its conflict development, it is an
engrossing show. You're almost
a sure bet to emerge from the
theater tapping your feet to the
zippy disco rendition ot the title
song and feeling all warm all
over.
Your problems should begin
where mine started: on the way
home in the car. Simon did write
it, but it isn't a shadow of the
recent Chapter Two or (my favo
rite) Plaza Suite that made us
wonder how words could emerge
in such beautiful succession from
one man's Smith Corona. Ham
lisch's tunes are fun. but lack the
power and craftsmanship that
earned him a Tony for/4 Chorus
Line. The only collaborator who
seems to live up to her potential
in my mind is the lyricist Carole
Bayer Sager, known for making
her lines rhyme even better than
her two last names in such tunes
as "Nobody Does it Better" and
something called "A Groovy
Kind of Love!' the souvenir
booklet was kind enough to
bring to my attention.
Sager's involvement in this
project was explained recently
on a " Phil Donahue Show," I be
lieve. It seems Hamlisch and
Sager were sort of involved, see,
and this play's all about how they
met and feel in love and broke up

and feel in love again, see, and
they somehow got Neil Simon to
take this great story of these
wonderful kids and make it cute
enough to fill a theater eight
times a week. Well, 'round about
here 1 got pretty sick and tired of
the whole project and wished
they had cut an album together
and left it at that.

They're Playing Our Song hits
the spot for the desperate local
or the undiscriminating tourist.
It is carefully constructed to ap
peal to the greatest number of
potential viewers, and as such is
humorous in a simple way and is
restfully inoffensive. In this re
spect, it resembles more a
McDonald's commercial than a

piece of theater.
All this is not meant to keep
you away from the Curran and
instead send you to Jane Powell
and Howard Keel in 1 Do! I Do!
(Don't! Don't!). They're Playing
Our Song is the best ticket in
town, and if you're going to see
anything this summer, you
should certainly see this.
