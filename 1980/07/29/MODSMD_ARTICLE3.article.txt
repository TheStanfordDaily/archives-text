than the original videotapes.
Paul Riess. news director at
KBCI. said the confiscation of
the tapes violated the station's
lirst Amendment rights. He said
the officers threatened to take all
the tapes in the station alter sta
tion officials refused to help
them locate the prison tapes.
"They were going to take a

us until they happened to find
the tapes they wanted." Riess
said.
The tapes, made Wednesday
