## 'Hooters': hilarious fluff 
### 
C'mon kids, stop watching re
runs of "Leave It to Beaver" in a
desperate effort to be enter
tained. God knows you can't re
late, so spend this week's
cigarette money on something
you are going to relate to
Hooters, state-of-the-art fluff
fun brought to you by Stanford
Summer Theater.
This play is so topical it will be
hopelessly dated in about 72
hours, so go see it while it's in its
prime— I laughed for two hours
straight. I was afraid it was going
to be witty but pointed social
commentary; not to worry. It's
just stuff everyone has lived
through rendered hysterically
funny by near-flawless work by
four talented performers.
The plot doesn't really need
any explanation. Two guys
Clint, the college boy, and Ricky,
Clint's high-school buddy — rent
a cabin on the Cape (referred to
as'TheCod" by Ricky) and take
up the pursuit of two vacationing
bank tellers — Cheryl, who is
about to marry one of the bank's
boring officers, and Ronda. who
is less enamoured of the current
sexual politics than her friend.
Well, so much for one-sentence

plot summaries. It's not impor
tant because I'll put money on
your having done or said 70 per
cent of the stuff in Hooters.
Acclaim goes first to the
framework — the costuming, the
brilliant set design (sand all over
the stage — that John
Rathman!). and the good little
musical intros to certain scenes.
rhe key to the pleasingness of
this play is in the characteriza
tions — Ted Tally, the author,
must have bugged dorm rooms
across the country to record his
perfect dialogue. Scott Williams
and Warren Craig Huartson
(Ricky and Clint) walk. talk, and
deliver like two million other
American boys you've seen and
heard. Andrea Bahmann looks
and preens like the quintessen
tial city bank teller (at the beach
with a suitcaseful of makeup),
and Lisa Jacobsen is one of your
slightly insecure and guileless
friends. These actors and actres
ses. who surely have a first-hand
grasp on all these situations of
sexual strategy, are the play's
whole charm.
At a party two days later. I met
some people who'd gone to see
Hooters also; we all started

shooting lines from the at
each other, remembering all the
best scenes: Ricky and Clint on
the beach moving their towels
apart to avoid looking faggy, and
developing a coughing system to
evaluate the beach bunnies; the
nonstop consumption of beer;
girltalk about pore-minimi/er
reducing-clarifying-lot ion
number-three; Ricky assuring
Clint that "the chicks are
paralyzed" by musk oil, and that
a picnic is the right move because
"ii there's one thing chicks like
better than getting laid, it's eat
ing;" Ricky trying to appeal to
feminist sensibilities by discus
sing ratification of the "EAR;"
the too-familiar defense
mechanism of working in pairs
and its inevitable complications.
What woman hasn't drawn a
frantic friend aside for a hurried
consultation on whether to stay
or go? What man hasn't en
gineered some ruse to make sure
the females present drink five
times more beer than the males?
Well, if you haven't done it,
you've seen it happen, and that's
just as much reason for liking
Hooters. The cast reproduce all
of this with a sure, freewheeling

naturalness that is comic, real,
and engaging.
Jacobsen and Bahmann offer
the more serious side of the play
as the "older" women. The two
admirably avoid self
righteousness — ex-cheerleader
Cheryl, an easy target, has as
much conviction about her ar
guments as ostensibly

feminist-minded Ronda, and
both actesses take care to show
the strengths and the weaknesses
in their characters.
But not to get bogged down in
the "implications." In its class, I
give it a 10. A 10? Well, okay, a
9.8 from the Russian judge — go
see it (July 30 through August 2)
and you'll know what I mean.

Rathman!). and the good little
musical intros to certain scenes.
rhe key to the pleasingness of
this play is in the characteriza
tions — Ted Tally, the author,
must have bugged dorm rooms
across the country to record his
perfect dialogue. Scott Williams
and Warren Craig Huartson
(Ricky and Clint) walk. talk, and
deliver like two million other
American boys you've seen and
heard. Andrea Bahmann looks
and preens like the quintessen
tial city bank teller (at the beach
with a suitcaseful of makeup),
and Lisa Jacobsen is one of your
slightly insecure and guileless
friends. These actors and actres
ses. who surely have a first-hand
grasp on all these situations of
sexual strategy, are the play's
whole charm.
At a party two days later. I met
some people who'd gone to see
Hooters also; we all started

shooting lines from the at
each other, remembering all the
best scenes: Ricky and Clint on
the beach moving their towels
apart to avoid looking faggy, and
developing a coughing system to
evaluate the beach bunnies; the
nonstop consumption of beer;
girltalk about pore-minimi/er
reducing-clarifying-lot ion
number-three; Ricky assuring
Clint that "the chicks are
paralyzed" by musk oil, and that
a picnic is the right move because
"ii there's one thing chicks like
better than getting laid, it's eat
ing;" Ricky trying to appeal to
feminist sensibilities by discus
sing ratification of the "EAR;"
the too-familiar defense
mechanism of working in pairs
and its inevitable complications.
What woman hasn't drawn a
frantic friend aside for a hurried
consultation on whether to stay
or go? What man hasn't en
gineered some ruse to make sure
the females present drink five
times more beer than the males?
Well, if you haven't done it,
you've seen it happen, and that's
just as much reason for liking
Hooters. The cast reproduce all
of this with a sure, freewheeling

naturalness that is comic, real,
and engaging.
Jacobsen and Bahmann offer
the more serious side of the play
as the "older" women. The two
admirably avoid self
righteousness — ex-cheerleader
Cheryl, an easy target, has as
much conviction about her ar
guments as ostensibly

feminist-minded Ronda, and
both actesses take care to show
the strengths and the weaknesses
in their characters.
But not to get bogged down in
the "implications." In its class, I
give it a 10. A 10? Well, okay, a
9.8 from the Russian judge — go
see it (July 30 through August 2)
and you'll know what I mean.
C'mon kids, stop watching re
runs of "Leave It to Beaver" in a
desperate effort to be enter
tained. God knows you can't re
late, so spend this week's
cigarette money on something
you are going to relate to
Hooters, state-of-the-art fluff
fun brought to you by Stanford
Summer Theater.
This play is so topical it will be
hopelessly dated in about 72
hours, so go see it while it's in its
prime— I laughed for two hours
straight. I was afraid it was going
to be witty but pointed social
commentary; not to worry. It's
just stuff everyone has lived
through rendered hysterically
funny by near-flawless work by
four talented performers.
The plot doesn't really need
any explanation. Two guys
Clint, the college boy, and Ricky,
Clint's high-school buddy — rent
a cabin on the Cape (referred to
as'TheCod" by Ricky) and take
up the pursuit of two vacationing
bank tellers — Cheryl, who is
about to marry one of the bank's
boring officers, and Ronda. who
is less enamoured of the current
sexual politics than her friend.
Well, so much for one-sentence

plot summaries. It's not impor
tant because I'll put money on
your having done or said 70 per
cent of the stuff in Hooters.
Acclaim goes first to the
framework — the costuming, the
brilliant set design (sand all over
the stage — that John
Rathman!). and the good little
musical intros to certain scenes.
