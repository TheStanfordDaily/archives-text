## Cliches abound in Fuller's latest 
### 
Samuel Fuller used to make
B-movies, drive-in movies,
late-night-TV movies. Then he
was discovered by Francis Truf
faut and Cahiers du Cinema, be
came a cult figure in France, got
financing for a big budget, major
release picture, and now the
summer of 19S0 will be remem
bered as the one in which Stanley
Kubrick and Fuller had movies
out within a month of each other.
Fuller's background shows in
The Big Red One, for in many
ways, this movie is a melting pot
for all the war movie cliches since
Birth of a Nation. We have the
gruff, combat-hardened
sergeant, the street kid from the
Bronx, the coward who proves
himself when it matters most, the
writer, the farm kid from the
Midwest, the baby-faced kid
who's usually called "The Kid"
although this time around it's
"Baby Face," and. of course, the
Krazy Krauts — the members
and enemies of the Big RedOne,
The First Infantry Division that
the movie follows across the
battlefields of World War II
from North Africa, and the de
sert campaigns against Rommel,
to the liberation of a concentra
tion camp in Czechoslovokia.
As the troops move from bat
tle to battle so does the movie cut
from vignette to vignette, all ap
parently culled from Fuller's
own experiences during the war.
There is a bit of the feeling of the
memoir here, a nostalgic
camaraderie that in some ways
makes one wish to have partici
pated in the thing, snipers and
mines not withstanding.
But perhaps because these are
Fuller's memories on the screen,
there is a realism to this movie
that is especially evident in its

details — the many uses the army
finds for condoms, a hand-made
Italian hearse with an orphan's
rotting mother inside, the faces
in a Belgiam home for the re
tarded. These are things outside
the normal scope of war movies,
and it is these details that make
The Big Red One both entertain
ing and affecting, that flesh out
this basically plotless movie. The
comic panic of the dog faces
when forced to help in the deliv
ery of a Frenchwoman's baby is
predictable, but when the farm
boy proudly holds the sopping
infant (of course, the farm boy
gets to play obstetrician because
he's birthed colts back home) his
joy is real and even cynical col
lege students in the audience
have to smile.
Fuller's direction of the movie
is interesting, for one would ex
pect an action-quickie director
to concentrate in the main on
producing thrilling battle scenes.
And while there is often a real
sense of danger, and the usual
bodies fly and fall, and the
bombs go off on cue (to the left
and to the right but never on our
heroes), moments that seem cal
culated to create suspense
merely plod along. The tone of
the film becomes far more con
vincing, and more at ease with
the material, when it moves to

the interplay between the Gl's.
The short relationship that de
velops between the sergeant and
a young survivor of the concent
ration camp is handled well and
is actually touching when it had
every right to become grossly
sentimental: the boy's face tears
you apart in the way those paint
ings of waifs with saucer eyes are
meant to.
Lee Marvin performs so well
as the sergeant that one can al
most hear him mumbling at the
Academy Awards ceremony:
"Thanks, but I just do my job."
Almost.
Bobby DiCiccio wisecracks cre
ditably as the young writer and
narrator of the film who grows
up to be Samuel Fuller, and even
Mark Hamill, who amazingly as
it may seem, looks younger here
than he did in Star Wars, is be
lievable in the role of the coward
and is allowed to indulge himself
with a leering Jack Nicholson im
itation as he repeatedly shoots an
already dead German officer in
one of the movie's very few truly
bad scenes.
As the sergeant says,"The
games are always the same," and
there is much in The Big Red One
that has been seen before, but. as
with any good cliche, there is as
much truth as there is conven
tion.
