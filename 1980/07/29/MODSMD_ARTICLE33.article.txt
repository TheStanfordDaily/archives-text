Soviets strike
NEW DELHI. India — The
Soviets have launched their
largest military air attack in Af
ghanistan since they invaded the
war-torn country seven months
ago. and it apparently is aimed
against Afghan army units rebel
ling against the Soviet-backed
government, according to dip
lomatic reports reaching here.
The reports state that Afghan
army garrisons in Helmand.
Maidan and Gha/ni provinces
have risen in rebellion against
the regime and are now engaged
in heavy fighting against Soviet
forces and Afghan army units
still loyal to President Babrak
Karmal's regime.

Militarv analysts said the army
revolt may be in reponse to a
purge currently being carried out
by President Karmal within the
ruling People's Democratic
Party of Afghanistan.
Moscow mourning
MOSCOW — Thousands of
Muscovites surged into
Taganvka Square yesterday in a
remarkable spontaneous
farewell to Vladimir Vysotsky, a
leading Soviet actor who died
Thursday and whose under
ground songs of satire and criti
cism are a contemporary cultural
and political phenomenon.
There was no doubt, as many
said, that they had come because

of their love for a man whose
songs of satire, Stalinist camps,
and just plain workers had
touched them in some irreplace
able way.
In a demonstration of unbri
dled popular feeling virtually
without precedent in the era of
Leonid Brezhnev, people
climbed atop parked buses, pul
led themselves onto the roofs of
streetside kiosks and appeared
by the hundreds on rooftops
around the square.
Equally remarkable, the
crowds jeered and sometimes
fought with the police, ignored
them, or protected each other
from forays by the muscular men
in their white blouses and dress
white caps for the Olympics.

Job data not released
WASHINGTON — The Pru
dential Insurance Co.. in a po
tential test of the government's
power to gather information
from private industry, yesterday
was barred from all federal con
tracts for refusing to give
employment data to the gov
ernment in a routine antidis
crimination investigation.
The Labor Department, which

initiated the action, luis not ac
cused the nation's largest insurer
of discriminatory employement
practices, hut labor officials said
they need the company's
employment computer tapes for
their investigation.
Today's weather
Fair and warm through tomor
row. Lows in the mid 50s to mid
60s. Highs in the 90s. Northwest
