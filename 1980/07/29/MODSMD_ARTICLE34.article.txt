# Brown: U.S. forces not second; Indian Ocean action possible
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
The United States is second to none in terms of
military power, and those implying otherwise are
"playing fast and loose with American security."
according to Secretary o' Defense Harold Brow n.
Brown said yesterday in Oakland, "Voices
speaking only of American weaknesses and Soviet
strengths are giving a wrong and dangerous impre
ssion to the people of the United States, our allies,
and the Soviet Union.
"If the Soviets believe they are predominant
militarily, then their behavior will be different."
Brown said at a news conference before he addres
sed more than 350 Commonwealth Club members.
Brown said the chaos in Iran and the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan have led to intensified
military efforts in the Southwest Asia-Persian
Gulf-Indian Ocean region. By the end of this week.
Brow n said, seven Navy ships will be in place in the
Indian Ocean to make clear to the Soviet Union,
"we have both the w ill and the ability to defend our
\ ital interests." He added military action would be
taken if necessary.
The secretary refused to direct his warnings to
ward Ronald Reagan, despite allusions to the Re
publican presidential candidate by reporters. "I
don't want to characterize this question with per
sonalities." he said.
In his speech. Brown warned that attempting to
obtain military superiority over the Soviet Union,
which "some" promise, is a military and economic
impossibility, and that it would result in an end of
arms control, an expensive arms race, and acceler
ate competition in the most dangerous arena.

strategic nuclear weapons.
Instead, Brown said he wanted to see an across
the board beef-up of our defense capabilities,
"from tanks to theater nuclear weapons," to main
tain the approximate balance between the U .S. and
the Soviet Union.
The Defense Department will continue to seek
ratifications of the SALT II treaty, added Brown.
Although about 10 demonstrators picketed in
front of the Hotel Leamington decrying draft re
gistration and shouting, "Down with Brown, Sec
retary of War and Destruction," he only briefly
spoke of recent draft registration efforts, saying
only he was "pleased with the relatively orderly
way" they have proceeded so far.
The secretary said he supports registration of
women as well as men for purposes of "equity,"
although he said it was up to the courts to deter
mine its legality.
Hopefully. Brown said, the problems of the cur
rently all-volunteer forces — desertion, declining
quailty of recruits — can be overcome to provide a
volunteer army that works. He said a raise in
salaries, possibly as high as 11 percent, for armed
services personnel would be forthcoming.
Brown's speech was never interrupted by
applause, and many commented afterwords that it
was "too technical."
He did spend considerable time discussing
specific weaponry. Brown said the defense de
partment was mo\ing "full speed ahead" on
strengthening land-based missiles, submarine
launched missiles, and bombers. The Trident sub
marines should start undergoing sea trials next
year, he said.
