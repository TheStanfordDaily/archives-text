# PG&E power shortage possible
## Stanford may cut electricity 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
There is a good chance that Pacific Gas & Elec
tric (PG&E) will ask Stanford to voluntarily curtail
its electricity consumption this summer.
The Energy Regulatory Commission has iden
tified the Northern California power region as one
of five areas in the country most likely to be faced
with a shortage of electrical power.
Company researchers predict that reserve mar
gins will fall below 5 percent sometime during
the months of August and September, according to
PG&E officer Dennis Pooler.
"This compares with the 15 percent reserve
margin that is considered desirable by the Califor
nia Public Utilities Commission." said Lynda
Wcisberg. Stanford's energy program manager.
When reserve margins fall below 5 percent, a
three-stage alert system is triggered,and electricity
users are asked to reduce their consumption.
Stanford has an individual three-stage plan that
is to go into effect upon notification from PG&E.
Robert McKnight. Stanford's superintendent ol
utility distribution systems, and one of the creators
of the plan, said Stanford was asked to make volun
tary reductions in June 1979 when PG&E had a
problem with a generator at the Moss Landing
facility.
"We implemented the first stage ol our plan, and
it worked." McKnight said.
When PG&E calls and requests a reduction, the
Work Control Center uses a "phone tree to
quickly notify building coordinators.
Weisberg said under a Stage I alert, unneces
sary lights and appliances would then be turned oil.

For example, photocopy machines could he un
plugged.
Under a Stage 2 alert, to be implemented it
PG&E's reserves drop to 3 percent, there would be
a limited shut-down at the central steam and chil
led water plant.
Jerrv Ostrander. Stanford's associate director ot
utilities systems, said at this point individuals might
begin to feel some discomfort as cooling systems
were affected.
"But if you happened to have a window open.
Ostrander said, "you might not even notice the
reduction."
During a Stage 1 alert, lie added, most people
would be unaware that anything had happened.
If reserves fall to 1.5 percent, a Stage 3 alert
would occur. This would set oil what PCi&L calls
"rotating outages."
Customers would receive planned interruptions
of electrical serv ice for betweentwo-and four-hour
periods on a rotating basis until the emergency
subsided.
However. Mcknight explained that in order to
avoid having all of the I niversity s electricity cut
off for limited periods. Stanlord has made an ag
reement with PG&E that it will initiate its own
major shutdowns and that this will be the equiva
lent ol a "rotating ouage."
"All measures will be taken to protect medical
patients, laboratory animals and research experi
ments." Ostrander said.
The University would also attempt to protect
computer-stored information.
Ostrander said the most likely scenario tor this
tight electricity situation would between noon and
h p.m.. the "peak hours." on an extremelv hot da v.
