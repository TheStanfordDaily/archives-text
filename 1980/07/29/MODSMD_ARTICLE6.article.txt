Although the details o! his
birth arc sketchy. Mohammad
Re/a Pahla\i and his twin sister.
Ashrat. were born Oct. 2h. 19|9.
in a run-down house in the red
light district til South Tehran.
But two years later, his father.
Rc/a. a scmi-literate Cossack
who had risen from the enlisted
ranks to o iloncl. led a successful
military mup. Colonel Re/a be
came prime minister in 1923 and
was crowned "Shah Re/a the
Great" in I 925.
A giant of a man at h feet 6.
Shah Re/a towered over those
around him. especially his
slightly built son. whose timidity
is said to have dismayed the old
shah. Conscious of his own lack
of education. Shah Re/a devoted
much attention to the training of
his son.
The future shah lived a double
life, alternating between fast cars
and women in Europe and a
sober military life at home.
Then on Sept. lb. 194 1. in\ading
Allied commanders forced Shah
Re/a. a German sympathizer, to
abdicate in favor of his son.
Mohammad (one month before
his 22nd birthday).
Politically the shah cut a
heroic figure. In 1946 he person
ally led Iranian troops against
Soviet forces then occupying the
province of Azerbaijan, regain
ing the territory in subsequent
negotiations.
Three years later an assassina
tion attempt left him slightly dis
figured. The monarch had calmly
walked away as his bodyguards
killed the gunman, drove himself
to a hospital for emergency at
tention. and then immediately

made a broadcast to the nation to
prove that his injuries were
slight.
In 1951 his prime minister,
Mohammed Mossadegh,
nationalized British and U.S. oil
interests and then in 1953. after
increasing estrangement from
the shah, triggered an interna
tional crisis by refusing to pay
compensation. In the turmoil of
August 1953. the shah fled to
safety in Europe on the ad\ ice of
Kermit Roosevelt who was the
regional CIA chief. Within three
days. Mossadegh was over
thrown after massive demonstra
tions reportedly organized by the
CIA.
A key supporter during this
crisis was General Nematollah
Nasiri. who was rewarded with
the command of Savak, the sec
ret police. Nasiri. apparently
with the shah's approval, began
cracking down ruthlessly on dis
senters.
Observers say that the shah
became preoccupied with plans
to develop a backward, almost
medieval country, into the 2()th
" century . He invested tens of bill
ions of dollars in ambitious pro
jects that he believed would turn
Iran into a rich industrial nation.
To spur land reform he gave
away parts of his own vast land
holdings.
With the aid of Empress
Farah. he championed women's
rights in a male-dominated soci
ety and made halting attempts to
liberalize political life. However,
the isolation of his imperial
status allowed corruption and
repression to grow malignantly
around him.
Behind his imperious public

image, however, intimates said
the shah was quiet, retiring and
often assailed by doubts over the
way he wielded power.
The shah had a split personal
ity — sometimes a quiet, insec
ure private man. and then, a
forceful, often ruthless imperial
leader — which grew out of a
massive inferiority complex.
Near the end of his reign the
shah appeared to have suffered a
breakdown as he finally realized
that the situation in Iran had
slipped beyond his control. He
would sit in dumb silence in the
midst of a conversation as if lie
had suffered a stroke. Whether
Ins unpredictable behavior dur
ing those days was connected
with his secret treatments for
lymphatic cancer, which he had
suffered since 1972. or whether
it was simply an extension of his
enigmatic character, remains a
mystery.
