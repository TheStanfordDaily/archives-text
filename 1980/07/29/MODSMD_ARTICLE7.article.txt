Freed hostage Richard
Oueen said Sunday he hopes
the death of the Shah of Iran
is "an opening leading to the
release of the other hos

Oueen met with reporters

any expectations that the
shah's death would lead to the
release of the 52 remaining
American hostages.
"To tell you the truth. I
don't really know that much
about it,"he said.
Looking fit and appearing
animated, Oueen said he
spent much of his time in cap
tivity reading. "You had to
find a world of your own," he
said.
The mere mention of a day

lit the week fueled specula
tion among the hostages that
that would he the day of their
release, he said. "Of course, it
wouldn't come." he said. "I
tried to stop listening to that."
Queen said he spends his
time telephoning families of
the other hostages. I le said he
feels he has to: "It's a cathar
sis every time I talk to them."
The telephone conversations,
he said, are important "both
for them and myself."
He said the hostages' main
concern was fear that their
letters home did not get sent.
"The mail was a constant
source of gripes." he said.
Queen said he spent much
of his time in captivity reading
Shakespeare and teaching
himself French,
"A fair number of other"
hostages are studying lan
guages as well, he said.
