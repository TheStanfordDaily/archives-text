# Iranians riot in Washington

WASHINGTON — Rival
Iranian demonstrators, many
chanting slogans and waving
banners and some wielding sticks,
clashed with each other and with
police in a series of skirmishes
Sunday on the streets of
downtown Washington.
By the time the series of rallies
ended in late afternoon, more
than 35 persons — including two
police officers — had been
treated for injuries, mostly
minor, and 1 10 persons had been
arrested. Traffic was periodically
disrupted as police chased pro
testers through downtown
streets on foot, scooter and
horse.
What the rival factions lacked
in size — the four separate
groups attracted a total of about
1500 demonstrators — they
made up for in the intensity of
their rhetoric.
To add to the mix of conflict
ing ideologies and police
demonstrator clashes, scores of
American tourists, servicemen
and other bystanders jeered at
the Iranians and occasionally
fought with them in the streets.
The focus of the day's ac
tivities was a rally in Lafayette
Square sponsored by the Iran
Freedom Foundation, whose

founder, exiled Iranian diplomat
Ali Akbar Tabatabai, was assas
sinated last Tuesday in the
doorway of his suburban
Bethesda, Md., home.
Among the 400 persons who
attended the IFF rally were some
who lamented the death of shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. But
the IFF supporters, who unani

mously denounced the regime of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
were outnumbered by three dis
parate pro-Khomeini and Mar
xist groups, whose 1 100 follow
ers taunted them from nearby
streets and sidewalks, and occa
sionally made forays into their
midst, setting off free-for-alls.
