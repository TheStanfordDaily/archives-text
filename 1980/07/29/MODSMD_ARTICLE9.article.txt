### John Goshko The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON â€” The Car
ter administration said yesterday
it will continue to permit the
children of the deposed shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who
died Sunday, to attend school in
the United States and to be vis
ited here periodically hy their
mother, the former empress.
State Department spokesman
John Trattnersaid the U.S. gov
ernment will stand hy the com
mitments it made regarding the
shah's family prior to his depar
ture from the United States for
Panama last December.
At the time. White House
chief of staff Hamilton Jordan
and White House counsel Lloyd
Cutler met with the shah at Lack
land Air Force Base hospital in
Texas and agreed to specific un

derstandings about what help the
United States would provide in
exchange for his agreement to
leave the country.
The main points of the still
secret agreement covered the
conditions under which the shah
could return to this country for
medical treatment. They also arc
known to have included a prom
ise that his four school-age chil
dren could continue their educa
tion here and that their mother,
now living in Egypt, could visit
them regularly to supervise their
care and schooling.
Trattner said that, while the
family's plans are unclear, he
understood that at least some of
the children "probably will re
turn here to school in the fall"
and added that the shah's widow
"still has the right to visit them."
