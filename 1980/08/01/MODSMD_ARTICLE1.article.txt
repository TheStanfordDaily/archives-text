## Artificial cell creation may aid in hepatitis, cancer care 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
Researchers at the School of Medicine have suc
ceeded for the first time in growing human hybridomas,
artificially created cells that produce pure or "monoc
lonal" antibodies.
The breakthrough is thought to have important future
applications as therapy in the treatment of diseases rang
ing from hepatitis-B to cancer, and as a vaccine replace
ment. The development of pure antibodies from human
cells may be a powerful tool for studying human disease,
and also as a method for rapid diagnosis of viral and
bacterial infections and diagnosis of cancer, the resear
chers claim.
The process was pioneered by Dr. Lennart Olsson, a
Danish medical research council fellow now at Stanford,
and Dr. Henry Kaplan, D'Ambrogio Professor of
Radiology and director of the Cancer Biology Laborat

Kaplan reported the results of their research last week
at the International Congress of Immunology in Paris.
The work was sponsored by grants from the National
Cancer Institute.
"In principle, this method should permit generation of
human monoclonal antibodies against a broad spec
trum of predefined antigens (substances that cause the
body to produce antibodies, as diseases do)," said Kap
lan.
Antibodies are highly specific molecules that often
form 'he body's first line of defense against viruses,
bacteria, and other foreign invaders.
Until now, scientists had only been able to produce
monoclonal anti-bodies from mouse cells. But these are
not the most effective antibodies, researchers say, be
cause of the body's natural reaction against foreign,
non-human proteins.

Olsson and Kaplan produced the human antibody
molecules using bone marrow cancer cells developed by
Dr. Kenneth Nilsson of the Wallenberg Laboratory at
the University of Uppsala, Sweden.
Ihe key to their success, however, was that they
primed the human cells chemically to select a mutant cell
line that propagated in the test tube more readily.
They next fused the mutant cells with the uninvolved
spleen cells of patients who had had their spleens re
moved at Stanford University Hospital.
At least two weeks prior to surgery such patients are
routinely submitted to immunologic tests, and they were
sensitized to a chemical, 2-dinitrochlorobenzene
(DNCB).
The sensitized spleen cells then produced antibodies
to DNC B. 1 he hybrid cell, or hybridoma, formed by the
fusion process then has some of the features of the spleen
cells and some ot the features ot the mutant cancer cells.
