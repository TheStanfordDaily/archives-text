## Anderson out if Carter fails 
### Eleanor Randolph The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — Indepen
dent presidential candidate John
Anderson said yesterday, after a
meeting with Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.). that he may re
consider his bid for the White
I louse if President Jimmy Carter
fails to win the Democratic
nomination.
Anderson, who formerly had
maintained that he would "un
der no circumstances" abandon
his campaign, changed his posi
tion after a 45-minute meeting
with Kennedy, who is still fight
ing to become the Democratic
choice at the party's convention
in New York this month.
At a joint press conference
with Kennedy in the hallway out
side the senator's office, Ander
son said Kennedy had not asked
him to withdraw if someone
other than the president, includ
ing Kennedy, is nominated. And
Anderson also made it clear
that he had not promised to with
draw if Carter is rejected by the
convention.
"Obviously, if a different deci
sion from the one that has been
so widely predicted should . . .

emerge out of the Democratic
convention . . . then it would
only he prudent, forone like my
self who believes very much in the
two-party system, to perhaps
consider what my position then
would he," Anderson said.
When it was pointed out that
this changed the position taken
by Anderson at a recent press
conference, the congressman
said that he was running "not be
cause I am attacking the two
party system, but because I'm at
tacking the nominating process
that apparently is destined to
give us nominees like President
Carter and Ronald Reagan."

Kennedy, who had asked An
derson to come to his office for
the meeting, said "I think that
there would be less likelihood lor
the need for his candidacy should
I gain the Democratic nomina
tion."
While aides to both Anderson
and Kennedy insisted that no
deals were struck between the
two, the meeting clearly was an
effort to add to the growing pres
sure on Capitol Hill to "open"
the Democratic convention — a
move that is seen by Carter's ad
visers as an effort to discard the
president while he is low in pub
lic opinion polls.
