### Dale Nelson Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — A Senate
subcommittee, girding for its in
vestigation of Billy Carter's
L ibya connection, focused yes
terday on selection of a top-flight
lawyer, foreclosing the possibil
ity that President Jimmy Carter
will testify before the Democra
tic National Convention begins.
But the president, apparently
determined to have his say be
fore delegates meet to choose
their 1980 party standard
bearer, canceled plans for a
campaign trip to Cleveland on
Monday. Press secretary Jody
Powell said Carter expects to
have his written report to Con
gress on the affair completed on
that day.
Powell said the president
"hopefully" will hold a news
conference Monday to answer
questions about his younger
brother's relationship with
Libya.
In Americus, Cm., meantime,
Billy Carter vehemently denied
having received copies of State
Department cables dealing with
I.ibya. Asked about a series of
allegations made Wednesday by
Joel Lisker, a Justice Depart
ment official, Billy said, "Lisker
is hill of shit." I isker heads the
department's foreign agents re
gistration section.
The swift-moving develop
ments fueled even further the

fires of speculation surrounding
Carter, seeking renomination for
another term, and brother Billy,
central figure in the govern
ment's investigation of possible
influence peddling involving
Libya, one of the most radical of
.Arab nations.
On Capitol Hill, investigating
senators said they probably will
not call Carter to testify about his
brother's ties with Libya until
after the Democratic Conven
tion, which opens in New York
on Aug. 11.
Sens. Birch Bayh (D-Ind), and
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C ),
made the statements shortly be
fore the special Senate panel met
to consider naming a lawyer to
spearhead the investigation.
President Carter had said ear
lier this week he was willing to
testify before the Senate panel,
and"the sooner the better."
Bayh and Thurmond were inter
viewed on NBC's "Today"
show.
The Senate subcommittee
went to work one day after
Lisker, in an interview with the
Associated Press, asserted that:
Billy Carter told him in a
Jan. 16 interview that the presi
dent had given him cables con
cerning the Libyan trips.
The president's brother
lied about when he first got
money trom Libya. Asked if the
word "lie" could be used, l isker
