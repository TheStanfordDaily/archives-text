## Farewell to Lymans 
### 
Today, Aug. 1. 19K0. Donald Kennedy becomes the eighth presi
dent of Stanford University, and a new chapter of University history
will begin to unfold. The turnover also signifies the end of an era for
Stanford â€” the 10-year presidency of Richard Lyman.
Under Lyman's leadership, the University made a quantum leap in
private financial support and rose to the top in graduate education.
Also during Lyman's tenure in office, undergraduate applications
reached an all-time high, as did the enrollment of blacks and
chicanos. Lyman encouraged the most significant curriculum revision
of the past decade, the Western Culture requirement, which will go
into effect this autumn.
That Lyman was an effective president is undeniable. Sometimes,
however, his propensity for efficiency resulted in the high-handed
use of authority. Most notably, he was criticized by some for resorting
to strong-arm tactics in quelling the riots' of the early '70s.
Overall. Lyman gracefully endured the ups and downs associated
with the administration of any major university. Chiefly, he never lost
sight of the primary aim of education: the students. He stayed abreast
of the opinions and concerns of the student body, as he and Mrs.
Lyman tirelessly attended hundreds of ASSU, dorm and group meet
ings. Lyman was in touch with every segment of the University
structure.
Not only does Lyman's move to the presidency of the Rockfeller
Foundation denote a Stanford loss, it entails a sizeable loss to the
educational community at large. As the 1979 elected head of the
Association of American Universities, Lyman was hailed as an
energetic and persuasive force in improving the educational oppor
tunities available in this country.
True, neither the University nor U.S. academia is "the length and
shadow of one man." But the calm, decisive presence of Richard
Lvman will be acutely missed
