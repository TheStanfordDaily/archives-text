# Police search press

Last Saturday. Idaho sheriffs deputies, possessing a search war
rant, raided the offices of Boise television station KBCI. The de
puties legally seized two hours of videotape which was to be used in a
documentary depicting last week's Idaho state penitentiary riots.
That search marked the second time that police have used the
search warrant to impinge upon the normal operation of the press
since the Supreme Court condoned such action in the 1978 Zurcher
v. The Stanford Daily case. Between 1971, when the Daily offices
were foraged by Palo Alto police, and the final court decision in
1978. 13 similar incidents against media organizations not suspected
of any crime occurred.
We tear that, backed by such a string of precedents and unhindered
by either Congressional or judge-made law, police intrusions upon
the press and other innocent third parties will undoubtedly continue.
Since the Supreme Court ruling against the Daily, press agencies
have requested to be subpoenaed, rather than presented with search
warrants, for material related to criminal proceedings. A subpoena is
much more amenable to the rights of the affected party than a search
warrant. A subpoena can be more closely tailored to the particular
case. Furthermore, it can he contested in court.
Police claim that they must employ search warrants instead of
subpoenas because a subpoena would allow the questioned party the
chance to remove or destroy evidence. The /.urcher case, however,
sanctioned search warrants without even considering that possibility.
And in Boise, the police gave the television station ample time to rid
itself of property when they issued a press release announcing the
search a day in advance. A subpoena alone would clearly have
sufficed.
The present search warrant policy certainly places the private files
of many professionals in the realm of public scrutiny. For the press,
such potentialcan be substantially damaging. Reporters often depend
upon the promise of confidentiality to obtain sources and, then, news
stories. Also, news agencies frequently investigate the conduct of
public officials, which would be especially prone to government
search.
Even last week, while ordering CBS News to produce some un
aired tapes. Chief Judge Collins Seitz of the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit wrote, "The compelled production of a repor
ter's source materials can constitute a significant intrusion into the
news-gathering and editorial process. Like the compelled disclosure
of confidential sources, it may substantially undercut the public pol
icy favoring the free flow of information to the public that is the
foundation for the (First Amendment) privileges."
We agree in sentiment with Seitz. We hope that the current bills in
Congress to protect the rights of journalists against unnecessary
infringement will pass. Yet, aside from the overriding Constitutional
privileges afforded the press, we would also hope that the private
affairs of all innocent individuals would be duly shielded from the
intrusive and sometimes unnecessary search warrant.
