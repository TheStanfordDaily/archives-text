# THE STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## John Mason Selfish Americans ignore hard facts 
### 
Perhaps it is because this is an
election year, or perhaps be
cause the country has just suf
fered through the disaster-filled
tenure of the Jimmy Carter ad
ministration. But whatever the
reason, Americans have gotten
to the point where they complain
almost incessantly about the way
this nation is run.
It seems as though every
prominent journalist, academi
cian and statesman in the coun
try is preoccupied by "the lead
ership crisis." And all of this has
become so commonplace that no
one ever bothers to question the
premise that America's troubles
are due to bad leadership.
I, for one, question that pre
mise. And I would like to suggest
that the real American failure is
the failure of Americans to be
led.
I sense that we dream of lead
ers who would make hard deci
sions for us. But 1 see the inabil
ity of the government to solve
our problems as an inevitable
consequence of our own failure
to show any willingness to com
promise, adjust or sacrifice.
We have become materially
spoiled and ideologically un
realistic, and we have come to
absolutely resent the statesman
who will face us with hard facts.
So, as a result, we get accomoda
tion from our leaders when we
need decisiveness, weakness
when wc need strength. But the
fault is ours, not theirs.
For example, last winter
Jimmy Carter announced that
dramatic increases in the rate of
inflation had prompted him to
revise his proposed federal
budget so that spending would
not exceed revenues. But to do
this without raising taxes, he
explained, would require that
funding for a number of federal
programs be cut.
Instantly, organizations repre
senting everyone from women
and blacks to environmentalists
and local politicians announced
that they would scrutinize the
president's new budget for any
cuts in programs beneficial to
their interests. What is signific
ant is that the constituents of
these groups, added together,
comprise a majority of the popu
lation.

And so this is a clear case in
which an attempt to combat a
situation harmful to all Ameri
cans was met with the refusal of
most Americans to suffer any
personal loss for the common

good. Someone else would have
to make the sacrifices.
A second of our failures is
exemplified by the position of
the liberal political element
which devotes its energy to op
posing both the growth of nuc
lear power and the reinstatement
of draft registration.
But while the stilled develop
ment of nuclear powered
generating facilities will hinder
us in our attempt to secure
adequate energy supplies and to
gain some degree of indepen
dence fron the politically man
ipulative OPEC cartel, the vocal
opposition to draft registration
will signify to the rest of the
world that the United States is
unwilling to defend its interests
in the Persian Gulf.
Thus, energy needs will con
tinue to go unfulfilled, we will
remain economically and politi
cally dependent upon the cap
ricious OPEC oil ministers and
we will grow increasingly vulner
able to the adventures of foreign
powers who are far less reticent
to exert military force than we
are.
But the central issue here is
neither the necessity of nuclear
power nor the value to the Un
ited States of putting on a more
militant face to the world.
Rather, it is the idea that
America has become childishly
unwilling to compromise.
We could pursue a program of
nuclear energy development and
forget about mustering an army
to fight in Arab oil fields. Or, we
could put a halt to the use of
nuclear reactors while, for the
sake of ensuring a continued
supply of oil, we develop a milit
ary presence in the Middle East.

Unfortunately, instead of
making any such realistic choice,
many Americans have turned
their attention to the painless
dream solution of solar power.
And it is this belief in a panacea,
combined with the refusal to
compromise, which is so de
bilitating to America.
Finally, the issue of military
service is the one which most
exactly typifies the decadence of
our common spirit. It is a na
tional disgrace that America,
alone among western powers,
has chosen to finance a merce-

A clarification: in last Tuesday's Daily, there was an error in the
printing of a letter from the Dean of Student Affairs. The Dean's
office has told us that draft registrants must provide their Social
Security numbers when requested. This use of the Social Security
number is currently under litigation in the District Court for the
District of Columbia.

nary military force.
Justified by the self-serving
anti-draft arguments which
claim that a conscripted army is
somehow more likely to be sent
to war than a "volunteer" force,
we have hired the few to perform
the patriotic duties owed by the
many.
In essence, we have re
pudiated the entire notion that
an American citizen has an obli
gation to his country. Just the
other night, I heard a young man
on the television (whom I recog
nized as a Stanford student) say
that he was grateful that Presi
dent Carter's draft registration
plan had gotten bogged down
because otherwise he would
have had to consider leaving the
country.
While 1 cannot imagine that he
was sincere in saying this, 1 do
see where such a statement is
possible — if not probable —
given contemporary American
attitudes. Twenty years ago, such
flippancy would have been re
garded as insulting and unpatrio
tic.
And 20 years ago, we asked
our leaders to be more than pan
derers. We offered to them our
energy and will to act. and we
asked of them the courage to
move forward. When John F.
Kennedy accepted the Democra
tic nomination for the presidency
in July 1960, he bound his party
to just such a commitment.
"The New Frontier of which 1
speak is not a set of promises,"
he said, "it is a set of challenges.
It sums up not what I intend to
offer the American people, but
what I intend to ask of them."
And six months later, at his
inauguration, he bound the na
tion to that same commitment. "
"Ask not," said Kennedy,"what
your country can do for you; ask
what you can do for your coun-
Ky."

It is those words of Kennedy's
that we should keep in mind
when we choose new leaders this
fall. And it is that spirit of con
tribution that we should re
member when we ask where the
responsibility for America's for
tune lies.
