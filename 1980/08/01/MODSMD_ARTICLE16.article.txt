# Student loans â€” an ever increasing demand
## 
### kathy Sheil Staff Writer 
As college costs continue to
rise, worries about where the
money will come from also in
crease. And its not just the lower
income families that are af
fected. With tuition, room and
board going up 12 to IS percent
in some places this year,
everyone is feeling the pinch.
Because colleges use a
needs-based criteria in assigning
financial aid, the less able one is
to meet college costs, the easier it
is to find financing. Middle in
come families often feel
"squeezed out" and even those
in the upper tax brackets may
have problems financing their
children's college careers.
An increasingly popular
method of financing is student
loans. Some schools have their
own loan plans, and the National
Direct Student loan plan is avail
able to students based on need.
But the biggest of the programs
is the Guaranteed Student Loan
Program (GSLP), sponsored by
the federal government.
Since the passage of the Mid
dle Income Student Assistance
Act, the GSLP no longer places a
ceiling on family income for
eligibilitv, and. according to Ken
Kaufman, assistant director of
loans for the Financial Aids Of
fice (FAO) here, the number of
people taking out loans is "in

creasing wildly."
About 45 percent of the un
dergraduates at Stanford have
student loans.
The popularity of the program
stems from the fact that there is
no question of family income,
loans are made directly to the
student, and the terms of the
loans are much better than other
loans. Under the GSLP, the gov
ernment subsidizes the interest
on the loan while a student is
enrolled in school and for a 9- to
12-month "grace period" after
graduation. The student repays
the loans at a rate of 7 percent,
with the government subsidizing
the difference between that and
the market rate.
The funds are actually made
available through private lead
ers, banks, credit unions and sav
ings and loans associations. Al
though schools like Stanford in
clude loans as part of the "self
help" in a financial aid package,
it is not necessary to go through
the University for the GSL.
Because the loans are guaran
teed by the government, banks
are still willing to lend to stu
dents, despite recent restrictions
in credit. "Student loans are un
secured loans," said Tony
Cadena, an analyst from the
FAO. "Without subsidy, banks
are still lending at the market
rate, and are going to get at least
some of their investment back.

even with the high default rate."
Wells Fargo Bank, which op
erates only in California, proces
sed over 10,000 loans last year,
and says that demand is increas
ing this year. Dick Dunn of Wells
Fargo says that Wells Fargo con
siders the loan program part of
its corporate responsibility to
education. "We believe in the
whole philosophy of the prog
ram," said Dunn. "That's why
we try to make the money avail
able every year."
To be eligible for a federally
insured loan the borrower must
be enrolled or accepted for en
rollment on at least a part-time
basis in an eligible institution. A
student can borrow up to $2500

per academic year as an under
graduate or $5000 per year as a
graduate. The total amount of
loans a student may have out
standing while an undergraduate
is $7500. The aggregate limit for
graduate or professional study,
including loans made at the un
dergraduate level, is $15,000.
To qualify for the interest sub
sidy, the student must provide
the lender with a statement from
the school indicating the stu
dent's cost of attendance and
other financial assistance. He or
she must also be making "satis
factory progress" and maintain
ing good standing, if already en
rolled. One also must be a citi
zen, national or permanent resi
dent of the United States, or be

in the United States on other
than a temporary hasis with in
tent to become a permanent re
sident.
A student normally obtains a
loan application from his or her
lending institution Applications
can also be obtained from
schools or regional offices of the
Office of Education.
There is some discussion going
on in Washington, D.C., regard
ing changes in the program.
The GSI.F has had sharp in
creases in the past, from SI..S
billion in 1977, to estimates of
$5.3 billion this year. Many
members of Congress, con
cerned about government spend
ing, are proposing that the prog
ram be altered to require stu
dents graduating or dropping out
of college to pay all of the in
terest on the loans, including the
part that was deferred during
school, at a rate of 9 percent.
There are also moves to in
crease the loan ceilings in re
sponse to the rise in college costs.
Whether or not the proposals
will go through is not certain at
this point. According to Kauf
man, the issue will probably not
receive any more attention until
after the Democratic conven
tion.

Since the passage of the Mid
dle Income Student Assistance
Act, the GSLP no longer places a
ceiling on family income for
eligibilitv, and. according to Ken
Kaufman, assistant director of
loans for the Financial Aids Of
fice (FAO) here, the number of
people taking out loans is "in

creasing wildly."
About 45 percent of the un
dergraduates at Stanford have
student loans.
The popularity of the program
stems from the fact that there is
no question of family income,
loans are made directly to the
student, and the terms of the
loans are much better than other
loans. Under the GSLP, the gov
ernment subsidizes the interest
on the loan while a student is
enrolled in school and for a 9- to
12-month "grace period" after
graduation. The student repays
the loans at a rate of 7 percent,
with the government subsidizing
the difference between that and
the market rate.
The funds are actually made
available through private lead
ers, banks, credit unions and sav
ings and loans associations. Al
though schools like Stanford in
clude loans as part of the "self
help" in a financial aid package,
it is not necessary to go through
the University for the GSL.
Because the loans are guaran
teed by the government, banks
are still willing to lend to stu
dents, despite recent restrictions
in credit. "Student loans are un
secured loans," said Tony
Cadena, an analyst from the
FAO. "Without subsidy, banks
are still lending at the market
rate, and are going to get at least
some of their investment back.

even with the high default rate."
Wells Fargo Bank, which op
erates only in California, proces
sed over 10,000 loans last year,
and says that demand is increas
ing this year. Dick Dunn of Wells
Fargo says that Wells Fargo con
siders the loan program part of
its corporate responsibility to
education. "We believe in the
whole philosophy of the prog
ram," said Dunn. "That's why
we try to make the money avail
able every year."
To be eligible for a federally
insured loan the borrower must
be enrolled or accepted for en
rollment on at least a part-time
basis in an eligible institution. A
student can borrow up to $2500

per academic year as an under
graduate or $5000 per year as a
graduate. The total amount of
loans a student may have out
standing while an undergraduate
is $7500. The aggregate limit for
graduate or professional study,
including loans made at the un
dergraduate level, is $15,000.
To qualify for the interest sub
sidy, the student must provide
the lender with a statement from
the school indicating the stu
dent's cost of attendance and
other financial assistance. He or
she must also be making "satis
factory progress" and maintain
ing good standing, if already en
rolled. One also must be a citi
zen, national or permanent resi
dent of the United States, or be

in the United States on other
than a temporary hasis with in
tent to become a permanent re
sident.
A student normally obtains a
loan application from his or her
lending institution Applications
can also be obtained from
schools or regional offices of the
Office of Education.
There is some discussion going
on in Washington, D.C., regard
ing changes in the program.
The GSI.F has had sharp in
creases in the past, from SI..S
billion in 1977, to estimates of
$5.3 billion this year. Many
members of Congress, con
cerned about government spend
ing, are proposing that the prog
ram be altered to require stu
dents graduating or dropping out
of college to pay all of the in
terest on the loans, including the
part that was deferred during
school, at a rate of 9 percent.
There are also moves to in
crease the loan ceilings in re
sponse to the rise in college costs.
Whether or not the proposals
will go through is not certain at
this point. According to Kauf
man, the issue will probably not
receive any more attention until
after the Democratic conven
tion.
As college costs continue to
rise, worries about where the
money will come from also in
crease. And its not just the lower
income families that are af
fected. With tuition, room and
board going up 12 to IS percent
in some places this year,
everyone is feeling the pinch.
Because colleges use a
needs-based criteria in assigning
financial aid, the less able one is
to meet college costs, the easier it
is to find financing. Middle in
come families often feel
"squeezed out" and even those
in the upper tax brackets may
have problems financing their
children's college careers.
An increasingly popular
method of financing is student
loans. Some schools have their
own loan plans, and the National
Direct Student loan plan is avail
able to students based on need.
But the biggest of the programs
is the Guaranteed Student Loan
Program (GSLP), sponsored by
the federal government.
