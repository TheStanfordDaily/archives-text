"In Darkness there is Death. - '
So begins the first line of The
Ninja, an erotic novel of the
samurai tradition. The title de
rives from the name of a class of
deadly Japanese assassins that
arose in the sixteenth century
from the lowest levels of
Japanese society.
The Ninjas found clients
among the highest class samurai
who hired them to carry out
deeds forbidden by their own
code of honor. They were repu
ted to "know a thousand ways to
kill."
Nicholas Linnear, a
Chinese-American cast as the
hero of The Ninja, lives in a
luxurious beach house in West
Bay Bridge. New York. For
reasons never made clear he be
gins to lose touch with the mod
em world.
He quits his $200,000 a year
job for reasons equally obscure,
that he cannot express, and
which we must finally conclude
revolve around convenience of
plot.
No sooner has he quit his job
than a series of gruesome and
professionally executed murders
begins to occur in West Bay
Bridge and New York City, each
one successively closer to Lin
near. The murders, Linnear
comes to discover, are the work
of a modern-day Ninja stalking
the Perrier crowd of New York..
The Ninja's ultimate target is
Linnear.
Now enter the cops a la
Kojack. Bring on the forensic
medical examiners, who, just
like Ouincy, seem to be person
ally involved in every case that

comes their way. Periodically go
back to Nick's childhood in Ja
pan. Have Nicholas meet a
beautiful heiress with a father
who is a cross between Robert
Vesco and H.L. Hunt, and the
book is underway at a fast clip.
But the development of the
secondary characters in Ninja
consists of only enough detail to
allow us to identify them at the
morgue in the next chapter.
Motivations are often muddy,
real emotion is wanting, and the
dialog is of TV quality. In fact,
much of the plot could have been
taken from a routine television
cop show.
So what makes this book
work? After all, Mr. Lustbader
has never written a novel before,
although he quit his job at CBS
Records to write this one. He is
not Japanese nor has he ever
been to Japan. Yet he has con
cocted a winning formula that
has catapulted his book into the
Best Seller List even before its
official publication date, and has
made him an instant millionaire.
For one thing, Lustbader pos
sesses the instincts of the
market-pleasing script prodigies
of Burbank and Hollywood. One
of the principles of such writing
holds that the slowest scene loses
the viewer (or reader) and hence
determines the success of the
piece. By adhering to this criter
ion of the marketplace
Lustbader has produced an un
adulterated thriller. It never
slows down.
Fortunately Lustbader does it
without descending into the
depths of maudlin romance or
melodrama that have made so
many other best sellers success
ful. He does give us another
world that we have never before
experienced, the cult of the
Ninja.

He also tries to give us a bit of
Japanese culture, but it must be
admitted that wading into The
Ninja's cultural content covers a
depth up to one's ankles. And
Lustbader spends too much time
prodding his Oriental characters
into making stereotypical com
ments on the Japanese martial
spirit and spouting Oriental pop
psychology.
Many of the scenes set in Ja
pan, from Nicholas' childhood,
could be taken from the pilot
episode of Kung Fu, a two
and-a-half star TV effort. In
deed, much of The Ninja in plot
and theme brings on waves of
deja vu for those who have
watched the Carradine series.
The excitement comes from
the tension Lustbader strings be
tween intense episodes of vio
lence, death and sex. The book
should be termed erotic not be
cause of Lustbader's steamy sex
scenes but from his intertwining
of sex and death.
But Lustbader never firmly
grasps this theme. Instead it ap
pears on occasion and almost ac
cidentally.
Instead Lustbader more
closely captures the carnality of
Harold Robbins in The Adven
turers :rough and unpolished ad
venture full of the uncivilized
and the animal.
Overall we have a thriller lack
ing depth and devoid of real
people. Tt moves with the sub
tlety of a freight train but pro
vides the thrills of a roller
coaster.
Save your money for the
paperback edition or the movie.
They were all included in
Lustbader's original deal with M.
Evans & Co. at an undisclosed
figure that spells good karma for
the author of The Ninja.

dialog is of TV quality. In fact,
much of the plot could have been
taken from a routine television
cop show.
So what makes this book
work? After all, Mr. Lustbader
has never written a novel before,
although he quit his job at CBS
Records to write this one. He is
not Japanese nor has he ever
been to Japan. Yet he has con
cocted a winning formula that
has catapulted his book into the
Best Seller List even before its
official publication date, and has
made him an instant millionaire.
For one thing, Lustbader pos
sesses the instincts of the
market-pleasing script prodigies
of Burbank and Hollywood. One
of the principles of such writing
holds that the slowest scene loses
the viewer (or reader) and hence
determines the success of the
piece. By adhering to this criter
ion of the marketplace
Lustbader has produced an un
adulterated thriller. It never
slows down.
Fortunately Lustbader does it
without descending into the
depths of maudlin romance or
melodrama that have made so
many other best sellers success
ful. He does give us another
world that we have never before
experienced, the cult of the
Ninja.

He also tries to give us a bit of
Japanese culture, but it must be
admitted that wading into The
Ninja's cultural content covers a
depth up to one's ankles. And
Lustbader spends too much time
prodding his Oriental characters
into making stereotypical com
ments on the Japanese martial
spirit and spouting Oriental pop
psychology.
Many of the scenes set in Ja
pan, from Nicholas' childhood,
could be taken from the pilot
episode of Kung Fu, a two
and-a-half star TV effort. In
deed, much of The Ninja in plot
and theme brings on waves of
deja vu for those who have
watched the Carradine series.
The excitement comes from
the tension Lustbader strings be
tween intense episodes of vio
lence, death and sex. The book
should be termed erotic not be
cause of Lustbader's steamy sex
scenes but from his intertwining
of sex and death.
But Lustbader never firmly
grasps this theme. Instead it ap
pears on occasion and almost ac
cidentally.
Instead Lustbader more
closely captures the carnality of
Harold Robbins in The Adven
turers :rough and unpolished ad
venture full of the uncivilized
and the animal.
Overall we have a thriller lack
ing depth and devoid of real
people. Tt moves with the sub
tlety of a freight train but pro
vides the thrills of a roller
coaster.
Save your money for the
paperback edition or the movie.
They were all included in
Lustbader's original deal with M.
Evans & Co. at an undisclosed
figure that spells good karma for
the author of The Ninja.

"In Darkness there is Death. - '
So begins the first line of The
Ninja, an erotic novel of the
samurai tradition. The title de
rives from the name of a class of
deadly Japanese assassins that
arose in the sixteenth century
from the lowest levels of
Japanese society.
The Ninjas found clients
among the highest class samurai
who hired them to carry out
deeds forbidden by their own
code of honor. They were repu
ted to "know a thousand ways to
kill."
Nicholas Linnear, a
Chinese-American cast as the
hero of The Ninja, lives in a
luxurious beach house in West
Bay Bridge. New York. For
reasons never made clear he be
gins to lose touch with the mod
em world.
He quits his $200,000 a year
job for reasons equally obscure,
that he cannot express, and
which we must finally conclude
revolve around convenience of
plot.
No sooner has he quit his job
than a series of gruesome and
professionally executed murders
begins to occur in West Bay
Bridge and New York City, each
one successively closer to Lin
near. The murders, Linnear
comes to discover, are the work
of a modern-day Ninja stalking
the Perrier crowd of New York..
The Ninja's ultimate target is
Linnear.
Now enter the cops a la
Kojack. Bring on the forensic
medical examiners, who, just
like Ouincy, seem to be person
ally involved in every case that

comes their way. Periodically go
back to Nick's childhood in Ja
pan. Have Nicholas meet a
beautiful heiress with a father
who is a cross between Robert
Vesco and H.L. Hunt, and the
book is underway at a fast clip.
But the development of the
secondary characters in Ninja
consists of only enough detail to
allow us to identify them at the
morgue in the next chapter.
Motivations are often muddy,
real emotion is wanting, and the
dialog is of TV quality. In fact,
much of the plot could have been
taken from a routine television
cop show.
