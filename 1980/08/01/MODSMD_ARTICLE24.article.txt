Short Takes
Michael Meltsner
Random House
244 pps. $8.95
Michael Meltsner is dean of
the Law School at Northeastern
University in Boston; Short
Takes is his first novel. Meltsner
writes taut but supple prose, and
has a flair for creating minor
characters who are interesting
enough to support a novel in
their own right. He is an ex
tremely intelligent man but he is
not yet a good novelist, and Short
Takes' failings are instructive.
The book's narrator, Jeremy,
is a Manhattan attorney who
splits his time between a public
service organization he calls
Good Works and teaching at
Columbia Law. Jeremy is a
once-young Turk who no longer
knows whether he works out of a
sense of social justice or out of
pride. When the novel opens, he
learns that he is being considered
for a federal judgeship and also
for the deanship of a West Coast
law school. After all his good
works, can Jeremy accept some
sort of position in the legal estab
lishment?
For answers, Meltsner thrusts
Jeremy into a flashback which
fills most of the novel. Too much
of this reads like "Guided Tour
Through Our Times." Jeremy
goes to Israel, defends Lenny
Bruce, does civil rights work in
Georgia, witnesses Gary Gil
more's execution, and is in South
Africa at the time of the revela
tions about Biko's death.
Other episodes are better, par
ticularly the novel's second chap
ter "Cards and Horses," about
Jeremy's childhood trips to the
racetrack with his father, and his
first job as an insurance claims
adjuster in the Catskills.
At the end of the novel,
Jeremy decides that he can join
the legal estabilshment, that he
will accept the judgeship if it's
offered him. The process by
which Jeremy arrives at this deci
sion is, however, obscure.
Meltsner does not provide a con
vincing link between Jeremy's di
lemma and its resolution.
The link, 1 suppose, is meant
to be provided by the flashback,
yet that flashback doesn't so
much explain or justify Jeremy's
resolution as it does the reasons
for the dilemma in the first place.
And so, when Meltsner has to
explain Jeremy's reasoning, he is
forced to rely on a cliche:
Of the Gilmore execution, 1 am
not a reliable witness ... 1 do re
member - how could I forget -
that afterwards I was ready to be
judged and thereby to judge. . . .1
had seen the worst that our need

for order could do and / still
wanted to be part of it. At last I
was ready to abide by the rules
without giving an easy inch to
their built-in inequities and cun
ning iniquities.
Jeremy's sentiments are noble
ones, and I wish him, or
Meltsner, well. If this, however,
is the only language Meltsner has
to give his usually articulate and
self-conscious hero at the novel's
turning point, then Meltsner has
not sufficiently refined Jeremy's
characterization.
Short Takes' other principal
problem is tied to its first person
narration. Jeremy frequently in
terrupts his intelligent reminis
cences to deliver essays on the
law. These essays are interesting
but as fiction, they are inelegant.
The great strength of first person
narration is that it gives the au
thor relatively easy access to a
strong voice and characteriza
tion. Its great risk is that the au
thor will confuse preaching with
that characterization, with the
establishment of a compelling
voice.
Meltsner dips into cliche just
often enough to lose the compel
ling quality that would transform
these essays into part of Jeremy's
characterization, and so the es
says come as holes in the novel's
fabric rather than part of the fab
ric itself.
Short Takes suffers from the
standard problems of first
novels, but nevertheless has a
great many good moments.
Those sections dealing with the
day-to-day business of the law,
rather than with Jeremy's rather
metaphysical doubts, are fas
cinating. Meltsner shows a gift
for both comedy and characteri
zation in these passages, particu
larly one in which Jeremy is
asked to defend an overbearing
woman — "I'm an interesting
person. Everyone says that." —
who is busted for the sale of
cocaine. If in his next novel,
Meltsner can string moments
like that into a coherent whole,
the result should be quite in
teresting.

Short Takes

Random House

Michael Meltsner is dean of
the Law School at Northeastern
University in Boston; Short
Takes is his first novel. Meltsner
writes taut but supple prose, and
has a flair for creating minor
characters who are interesting
enough to support a novel in
their own right. He is an ex
tremely intelligent man but he is
not yet a good novelist, and Short
Takes' failings are instructive.
The book's narrator, Jeremy,
is a Manhattan attorney who
splits his time between a public
service organization he calls
Good Works and teaching at
Columbia Law. Jeremy is a
once-young Turk who no longer
knows whether he works out of a
sense of social justice or out of
pride. When the novel opens, he
learns that he is being considered
for a federal judgeship and also
for the deanship of a West Coast
law school. After all his good
works, can Jeremy accept some
sort of position in the legal estab
lishment?
For answers, Meltsner thrusts
Jeremy into a flashback which
fills most of the novel. Too much
of this reads like "Guided Tour
Through Our Times." Jeremy
goes to Israel, defends Lenny
Bruce, does civil rights work in
Georgia, witnesses Gary Gil
more's execution, and is in South
Africa at the time of the revela
tions about Biko's death.
Other episodes are better, par
ticularly the novel's second chap
ter "Cards and Horses," about
Jeremy's childhood trips to the
racetrack with his father, and his
first job as an insurance claims
adjuster in the Catskills.
At the end of the novel,
Jeremy decides that he can join
the legal estabilshment, that he
will accept the judgeship if it's
offered him. The process by
which Jeremy arrives at this deci
sion is, however, obscure.
Meltsner does not provide a con
vincing link between Jeremy's di
lemma and its resolution.
The link, 1 suppose, is meant
to be provided by the flashback,
yet that flashback doesn't so
much explain or justify Jeremy's
resolution as it does the reasons
for the dilemma in the first place.
And so, when Meltsner has to
explain Jeremy's reasoning, he is
forced to rely on a cliche:
Of the Gilmore execution, 1 am
not a reliable witness ... 1 do re
member - how could I forget -
that afterwards I was ready to be
judged and thereby to judge. . . .1
had seen the worst that our need

for order could do and / still
wanted to be part of it. At last I
was ready to abide by the rules
without giving an easy inch to
their built-in inequities and cun
ning iniquities.
Jeremy's sentiments are noble
ones, and I wish him, or
Meltsner, well. If this, however,
is the only language Meltsner has
to give his usually articulate and
self-conscious hero at the novel's
turning point, then Meltsner has
not sufficiently refined Jeremy's
characterization.
Short Takes' other principal
problem is tied to its first person
narration. Jeremy frequently in
terrupts his intelligent reminis
cences to deliver essays on the
law. These essays are interesting
but as fiction, they are inelegant.
The great strength of first person
narration is that it gives the au
thor relatively easy access to a
strong voice and characteriza
tion. Its great risk is that the au
thor will confuse preaching with
that characterization, with the
establishment of a compelling
voice.
Meltsner dips into cliche just
often enough to lose the compel
ling quality that would transform
these essays into part of Jeremy's
characterization, and so the es
says come as holes in the novel's
fabric rather than part of the fab
ric itself.
Short Takes suffers from the
standard problems of first
novels, but nevertheless has a
great many good moments.
Those sections dealing with the
day-to-day business of the law,
rather than with Jeremy's rather
metaphysical doubts, are fas
cinating. Meltsner shows a gift
for both comedy and characteri
zation in these passages, particu
larly one in which Jeremy is
