## another perspective /peter finch 'Dressed To Kill' predictable, disappointing 
### 
(Editor's Note: It is invariable
that opinions will differ on
movies. What appeals to one per
son is often completely worthless
in the eyes of another. With this in
mind, I have taken the liberty of
running a second review of Brian
De Palma's controversial new
film, Dressed to Kill, which was
given a favorable note in Tues
day's Daily.)
All cries of plagiarism aside,
Brian De Palma has just released
a very bad movie, and 1 think it
deserves attention as such.
Many critics have panned
Dressed to Kill, calling it an in
ferior clone of Hitchcock's

Psycho, Vertigo and others.
Okay, so there are a couple
shower scenes — big deal; 1 have
nothing against emulating a mas
ter like Hitchcock — //it works.
Unfortunately it doesn't. Nor
does anything else in this movie.
Therefore, my complaint is not
that De Palma has copied any
one, it's simply that he has failed
to make an entertaining movie
on any level.
First of aLI, there is not one
genuine scare in the whole story.
What are intended to be shock
ing scenes evoke belly laughs a
good percentage of the time; not
the nervous titters I heard at The
Shining; but out and out laughter

of the Amityville Horror variety.
Perhaps the problem is that
De Palma is incredibly predicta
ble here, writing overly long
scenes that drain the movie of
any suspense it might otherwise
have had. At the conclusion of a
particularly lengthy scene in
which the lonely Angie Dickin
son pursues a potential lover in
an art gallery 1 realized that 1 had
completely lost interest. Instead
of hanging over the edge of my
seat with anticipation, I reclined,
wondering when the movie
would be over.
At least, 1 thought at the time,
De Palma would come up with
an interesting finale — some

thing he had done well in his
otherwise abysmal Carrie. But
much to my dismay. Dressed To
Kill's ending is not interesting.
It's every bit as predictable as the
rest of the movie. (Anyone who
has seen Carrie will experience a
strong deja vu sensation; I'll
leave it at that.)
De Palma's script, though oc
casionally adequate, dips fre
quently into a tone reminiscent
of thrillers you might find grac
ing the shelves of your local
supermarket. Almost every
word Dennis Franz utters as the
obnoxious New York detective,
for example, reeks of the Tom
Snyder School of "Why don't

we just come out and say it?!?"
His hip "frankness" is enough to
make you sick.
For the most part, the rest of
the cast is uninspired as well.
Anyone could have played Dic
kinson's part, and she does no
thing to keep us from wishing
someone else had. Michael
Caine, who plays her psychiat
rist, adds nothing special. Nancy
Allen and Keith Gordon are
both pretty good, hut don't look
for them at the Academy
Awards.
People clapped at the end of
Dressed To Kill, all right. They,
like myself, were relieved to see
this pathetic film end.
