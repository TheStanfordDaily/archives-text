## Three Bay area album alternatives 
### 
For those who find the FM
radio playlists ebbing in original
ity and interest, there is always
the singles racks in local avante
garde record stores around the
Bay area. Many struggling rock
groups and unsigned artists re
lease self-produced and mar
keted singles as a way of captur
ing some attention, though few
of these records are actually ever
played on the stodgy commercial
radio stations — at least, not dur
ing prime listening hours. In brief,
here are some of the more in
teresting local singles on the cur
rent market:
HOLLY AND THE ITA
LIANS: "Miles Away" b/w "It's
Only Me." Holly and the Italians
used to appear nightly at punk
clubs around San Francisco, but
finding the new wave market
overcrowded, overzealous, and

unproductive, they went to Enn
land in search of success, and
eventually got signed by Virgin
Records. Holly's bought a new
an p or two since her Mabuhay
days, and now that her sound sys
tem is cleared up a tad, she
sounds as terrific as one always
suspected upon seeing her in ac
tion. "Miles Away" is the best
rock'n'roll single I've heard since
Blondie's "Hanging on the Tele
phone." For a 3-piece band, this
is par excellence ineverv respect.
DEAD KENNEDYS: "Police
Truck" b/w "Holiday in Cam
bodia." i suppose the Dead
Kennedys (of SF mayoratorial
candidate Jello Biafra fame)
meant these songs to contain
some dramatic or political irony
— at least, I hope they did — but
unfortunately, they missed the
point completely. It Jello meant
there to he some political or
humane implications in these
songs, he totally blew it.and 1.
for one, am offended. "Police
Truck" is about policemen who
arrest prostitutes and then
gang-rape them, a theme 1 don't
find particularly amusing but
which the Dead Kennedy clan
must think a real yuck. One can
only infer upon hearing it that
they are all gung-ho for sexism
and police brutality. Any irony is
lost in the mix and in Jello's
deadpan poseur-punk voice.
"Holiday in Cambodia" is even
grimmer; advising spoiled rich
preppies to go to Cambodia
where "You'll do what you're
told . . . where the slums cot so

much soul." If the rhymes were
beter this might be funny, but
since Jello Biafra is from Aspen
and is a closet spoiled rich pre
ppie himself, this song is merely
stupid and offensive, as well as
repulsive.
JO ALLEN AND THE
SHAPES. "Cryin" Over You"
b/w "Lowlife." Signed to SF's
first punk label. 4 15 Records, Jo
Allen and the Shapes seem mis
cast as new wave heroes. Allen,
who used to be drummer with
space-rockers Hawkwind. has
changed his style considerably
since then, but he's not new
wave. The Shapes are not a great
singles band, but they'll probably
put out a good album — "Cryin"
Over You" is too long and not
quite catchy enough to be a hit

single, yet this is a great club
band, and has the potential to go
far.
Other suggestions: There's a
new album out which is guaran
teed to brighten up the dullest
party: Chipmunk Punk, yes,
friends, they're back. Simon.
Theodore, and Alvin Chipmunk
have a new record out and it's
chock full o' hits — songs we all
know and love, like"Crazy Little
Thing Called Love." "My
Sharona," and the immortal
"Just the Way You Are," plus
many more of your favorites
sung by those lovable litle ro
dents themselves and none the
worse for it. The record is a must
for anyone over 13, and is of
course produced by the inde
fatigable manager, Dave.
