The Magic Flute ★★ ★ ★
New Vanity, Palo Alto
Ingmar Bergman directed this ver
sion of the Mozart opera. The master
of the psychological drama is in a
summertime mood here: his film is in
fused with a sense of sheer delight.
Filmed opera has never seemed so
magical. In Swedish, with English sub
titles. Plays next Sunday and Monday.
—Jim Mattson
Animal House ★ ★ ★ ★
Fox, Redwood City
This is a slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorification of
white male fantasies. And because of
this, this story about frat life and non
life in '62 works: Animal House's ap
proach fits its subject matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on cam
pus." I'm never quite sure what drives
Belushi, but whatever it is, it must be
good stuff. HlayS tonight and tomor
row night.
—Ron Lillejord
Children of Theatre Street ★ ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This documentary about Lenin
grad's famed Kirov School of Ballet
suffers from pretentiousness, senti
mentality and Grace Kelly's narra
tion, but still should be seen by anyone
interested in dance. Serious examina
tions of the dancer's life are rare
enough, and this is our only glimpse of
tremendous discipline needed to live
that life in the Soviet Union. Plays
Sunday and Monday.
—Mike Hale
The Blues Brothers Movie ★ ★ ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director. Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Dressed To Kill
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The author of a review of Dressed to
Kill in this issue of the Daily says that
he doesn't take issue with director
Brian De Palma's "emulation" of
Hitchcock. But that is the issue: De

Palma has gone beyond mere emula
tion into cinematic felony. De Palma
steals Hitchcock's plots (this is, of
course, not the first time — Sisters,
like DTK, was a remake of Psycho-,
Obsession was a shot-by-shot rehash
of Vertigo) without taking over the au
teur's underlying moral tensions. The
result is a brittle, empty thriller worn
down to nothing by its own stylistic
conceits.
This is a film designed to be con
sumed and thrown away. After De
Palma brings up references to other
films (the ending of DTK quotes his
own Carrie) he demands that we don't
think about where he got them. His is
parasite movie-making of the highest
order.

The Front ★ ★★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
A saga of the Hollywood Blacklist.
Woody Allen plays a mild-mannered
man who agrees to act as front for a
blacklisted screenwriter (Zero Mas
tel). By putting his name on the
scripts, Allen gets a taste of glory
while Mostel makes enough money to
survive. Martin Ritt's direction is
shoddy in spots; the film has a cheap,
crude look to it as cuts don't match
and sound booms dangle into the
frame. The director's concern is with
his characters — they have a human
appeal which makes it possible to ig
nore the film's technical shortcom
ings.
—J.M

Gigi ★ ★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
The last gasp of the MGM musical.
This movie, made in the late '50s when
the fortunes of the studio and all of
Hollywood were on the decline, is en
tertaining enough, but the creative fire
isgonc and we're left with a movie that
has masterful set direction and a
rather cold heart. Leslie Caron plays
Colette's scarcely pubescent French
girl. Louis Jordan, recent star of FDS
florist commercials, makes a very dis
tant mentor for the nymphet. Even
Maurice Chevalier seems to spend
more of his time than usual mugging at
the camera.
Vinccnte Minelli directed; Arthur
Freed produced.
-J.M.

The Shining ★
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shirting is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

The Empire Strikes Back ★ ir
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger,splashier, but
dull All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J.M
Editor's note the renew of ESB which
appeared in last week's CinemaScope

Casablanca ★ ★★★
New Vanity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented ro
mance for two generations of
filmgoers.
Casablanca sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung over
and over again by Dooley Wilson, and
the services of Humphrey Hogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and the
great Claude Rains also add their ta
lents. What more could you ask?
The director was Michael Curtiz
(Robin Hood) and the studio was
Warner Brothers. Plays tonight and

The Shining ★
Palo Alto Square
An interesting, infuriating, bewil
dering mess of a movie. Stanley Kub
rick's (too faithful? not faithful
enough?) adaptation of the Stephen
King novel supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman in a
bathtub) nor hinted-at depths of
characterization. Jack Nicholson glee
fully overplays his role as madman
father to telepathic son Barry Lloyd;
driven to knife-wielding hysteria by it
all is mother Shelley Duvall. Duvall
gives the film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness that
a better movie might have used to
stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making, The Shirting is a testament to
Kubrick's ability to devote infinite
care fashioning a monument to no
thing in particular.

The Empire Strikes Back ★ ir
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger,splashier, but
dull All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?

Casablanca ★ ★★★
New Vanity, Palo Alto
The movie that's represented ro
mance for two generations of
filmgoers.
Casablanca sports a seductive
studio luster, a theme song sung over
and over again by Dooley Wilson, and
the services of Humphrey Hogart and
Ingrid Bergman. Peter Lorre and the
great Claude Rains also add their ta
lents. What more could you ask?
The director was Michael Curtiz
(Robin Hood) and the studio was
Warner Brothers. Plays tonight and

Ingmar Bergman directed this ver

Filmed opera has never seemed so
magical. In Swedish, with English sub
titles. Plays next Sunday and Monday.

Animal House ★ ★ ★ ★
Fox, Redwood City
This is a slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorification of
white male fantasies. And because of
this, this story about frat life and non
life in '62 works: Animal House's ap
proach fits its subject matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on cam
pus." I'm never quite sure what drives
Belushi, but whatever it is, it must be
good stuff. HlayS tonight and tomor
row night.

Children of Theatre Street ★ ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This documentary about Lenin
grad's famed Kirov School of Ballet
suffers from pretentiousness, senti
mentality and Grace Kelly's narra
tion, but still should be seen by anyone
interested in dance. Serious examina
tions of the dancer's life are rare
enough, and this is our only glimpse of
tremendous discipline needed to live
that life in the Soviet Union. Plays
Sunday and Monday.

The Blues Brothers Movie ★ ★ ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John Landis (director. Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Dressed To Kill
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The author of a review of Dressed to
Kill in this issue of the Daily says that
he doesn't take issue with director
Brian De Palma's "emulation" of
Hitchcock. But that is the issue: De

Palma has gone beyond mere emula
tion into cinematic felony. De Palma
steals Hitchcock's plots (this is, of
course, not the first time — Sisters,
like DTK, was a remake of Psycho-,
Obsession was a shot-by-shot rehash
of Vertigo) without taking over the au
teur's underlying moral tensions. The
result is a brittle, empty thriller worn
down to nothing by its own stylistic
conceits.
This is a film designed to be con
sumed and thrown away. After De
Palma brings up references to other
films (the ending of DTK quotes his
own Carrie) he demands that we don't
think about where he got them. His is
parasite movie-making of the highest
order.

The Front ★ ★★
Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
A saga of the Hollywood Blacklist.
Woody Allen plays a mild-mannered
man who agrees to act as front for a
blacklisted screenwriter (Zero Mas
tel). By putting his name on the
scripts, Allen gets a taste of glory
while Mostel makes enough money to
survive. Martin Ritt's direction is
shoddy in spots; the film has a cheap,
crude look to it as cuts don't match
and sound booms dangle into the
frame. The director's concern is with
his characters — they have a human
appeal which makes it possible to ig
nore the film's technical shortcom
ings.

This movie, made in the late '50s when
the fortunes of the studio and all of
Hollywood were on the decline, is en
tertaining enough, but the creative fire
isgonc and we're left with a movie that
has masterful set direction and a
rather cold heart. Leslie Caron plays
