## 
### Jim Harrow Staff Writer 
Two young women have
complained to Stanford
Police Services about a white
male in his mid-20's who drives
a brown van and poses as a
freelance photographer for a
modeling agency.
The man coaxed the two
women out to a wooded area
on campus and wanted them
to disrobe. The women re
fused and H' tlays later re
ported the incident to the
Standford police.

Police Chief Marvin Hcr
rington says that this isn't an
unusual scam and that it often
happens at other universities.
"No crime has been com
mitted at this point, but we
are very concerned about this
sort of thing," he said.
The man's method of oper
ation is similar to those of a
person last year who handed
out cards to women, trying to
get them to pose.
If other women have simi
lar complaints, they should
contact Police Services at
497-3444.
