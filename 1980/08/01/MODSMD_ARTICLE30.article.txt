Sadat must face Israelis' vote
CAIRO â€” The Israeli Parliament's defiant vote
to make Jerusalem Israel's undivided capital has
forced a dangerous and unwanted decision on
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, adding to the sus
picion which increasingfV is poisoning relations be
tween Egypt and Israel.
Sadat must decide whether to suspend the Pales
tinian autonomy talks again or to swallow hard and
absorb the Israeli challenge with only the formal
complaints made so far. In the view of analysts here,
the Egyptian leader stands to lose either way.
If the talks are suspended, it may turn out to be
impossible to revive them again without confront
ing the Jerusalem issue, which American, Egyptian
and Israeli negotiators agree is the most difficult of a
long list of disagreements. But if the Israeli Parlia
ment'schallenge goes unanswered, Egypt'sposition
within the negotiations will be significantly
weakened by doubt over its will to resist Israeli
toughness, and its standing in the Arab world will be
further damaged.
Diplomats here thus are predicting Sadat is likely
to consider himself forced to suspend the talks

again, although remaining ready to resume them as
he did this month after an earlier two-month walk
out. If he broke off the negotiations the first time,
when the Jerusalem bill was only introduced, they
say, he will have to break them off again now that it
was actually passed by the Knesset, despite the danger
of a long, possibly fatal delay.
