# Want fiction and drama? Watch politics on TV

"The interaction between politics and television may
not be in the best interests of the republic," said Prof.
Henry Breitrose, chairman of the Communication De
partment. Tuesday evening.
"Our ideal notion of what the political process is all
about doesn't lend itself to packaging for prime-time TV,"
Breitrose said.
Breitrose said he is concerned both about television as a
medium which has developed its own rules, and about
politics as program material for commercial television.
"There is little to indicate that viewing network news
results in an increase in one's political knowledge." said
Breitrose.
Television deals in images, and the dominantTV form is
the fictional narrative, complete with heroes and villains.
Breitrose discussed the television images of several

presidential candidates: Ronald Reagan's TV image is
that of "a leader, mature but not decrepit, embodying
traditional American middle-class values." For Reagan,
any global problem is manageable with a little gumption
and stick-to-it-ness. The image conjured up is that of the
Walton family in the White House.
President Jimmy Carter portrays the image of "a leader,
trusting and loyal . . . who cares, worries and prays. He is
not unlike Captain Kirk, running a diverse Starship En
terprise," said Breitrose.
John Anderson's television image is, above all, diffe
rent. He is "upright, proud, and human but not humble,"
said Breitrose. Anderson tells the hard truth instead of the
easy lie â€” reminiscent of Professor Kingsfield in the TV
series The Paper Chase.
The problem with the television imagery surrounding
candidates is that it can mislead the voter. "Leadership
ability is very different from leadership style." said Breit
rose .

Imagery can become pivotal in the choice of the unde
cided voter. "When the undecided voter is forced to make
a decision," said Breitrose, "image becomes important,"
especially it the voter is politically unsophisticated, from
lower income classes, and a heavy television viewer.
Breitrose used the 1980 Republican Convention as an
illustration of politics as dramatic narrative. The story of
the convention included an exposition, a complication,
conflict, climax and a resolution.
According to Breitrose, the narrative of the 1980 Re
publican Convention ran into difficulty: "Instead of a
proper complication, a subplot got out of hand."
A typical convention subplot is the choice of Vice-
President. When Gerald Ford began announcing his terms
of "co-presidency," the subplot was out of control.
"1 he climax of the convention came when Reagan en
tered the subplot and his very nomination became incon
sequential," said Breitrose.
