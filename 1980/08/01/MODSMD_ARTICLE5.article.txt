# Loop leaks, mall made into mess once more
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
The newly completed Galvez
Mall has been a real mess lately
as construction crews replaced a
leaking chill water line between
Crothers Memorial Hall and the
Green Library.
Uprooted palm trees, dis
placed park benches and granite
bollards stand awkwardly off to
either side of the construction
site as a back-hoe machine digs a
450-foot long, 16-foot deep
trench right through the middle
of newly planted flower beds,
plots of fresh, green grass, and
carefully manicured planter
boxes — not to mention all that
freshly laid asphalt and concrete.
A portable toilet for the work
ers is now stationed where strol
lers used to be able to pause be
neath a shady tree, and a giant
crane sways over it all.
"Yeah, it's a real shame." con

ceded Joe ( atrington, who ov cr
sees construction at the sight for
the University's utility depart
ment. "We got everything just to
where it was growing good, then
we have to teai it up again."
Necessity for tlie construction
arose when the main under
ground chill-waterline sprung a
leak somewhere underneath
Galvez Mall about three days he
fore Commencement Day, ac
cording to Jerry Ostrander, di
rector of utilities.
This chill-water line carried
cold water to more than 20 build
ings around campus, such as the
law school and Green I ibrary for
their air-conditioning systems.
Ostrander blamed the break
on faulty bedding of the IS inch
pipe, and the fragility of the
material from which the pipe was
made, a fiberglass material cal
led Techitc. The line is now
being replaced with a much stur
dier material, Transite, a con
crete and asbestos substance.
Ostrander would not say what
the cost of the construction
would be. The funds are being
paid out of an emergency reserve
fund that the University keeps
for such unexpected mishaps.
It is possible that other leaks
will spring in the chill water loop
in the future, and these too will
have to be replaced, or braced

and patched.
Nobody likes the thought of it,
though, since the chill water loop
goes around most of the main
campus from the central boiler
plant, down Via Crespi and Serra
streets, all the way to the Law
School.
"In 1971 (when the loop was
first put in place) evidently they
thought that Techite was a viable
substitute for Transite," says Os
trander. "We've had enough
problems with it now that we
don't think so anymore."
