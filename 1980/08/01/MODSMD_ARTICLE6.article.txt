## Peru begins new democracy 
### Charles Krause The Washington Post 
LIMA, Peru â€” Peru became
only the seventh country in
Spanish-speaking Latin America
to be governed by a freely and
fairly elected democratic gov
ernment Monday as Fernando
Belaunde Terry was sworn in as
his country's l()2nd president,
ending 12 years of authoritarian
military rule.
In his inaugural address, Be
launde promised to respect the
country's new constitution, work
to strengthen democracy, create
an independent judiciary, ob
serve human rights, spur
economic development and re
store freedom ot the press.
Belaunde referred several
times during his speech to the
fact that he was being inaugu
rated for the second time, a not
so subtle reminder that he was
overthrown by the military here
in 1968 near the end of a presi
dential term that began with his
election in 1963.
Lima, a normally bustling cap
ital city of some 5 million resi
dents. was unusually quiet, re
flecting, in the view of several
observers, a certain skepticism
on the part of Peruvians that the
new civilian government is going

to have much mure success than
the outgoing military regime in
solving the country's severe
economic and social problems.
Communist and other leftist
members of the new congress
were generally unenthusiastic
about Belaunde's inaugural ad
dress.
They accused the new presi
dent of being pro-capitalist and
pro-United States and promised
to give him no respite during his
first weeks and months in office.
Belaunde, 67, an architect,
won 45 percent of the votes in
May's election against 14 oppo

nents.
The new president also an
nounced that Peru's newspapers
and television stations, taken
over by the military government,
would be returned to their
former owners as a guarantee of
freedom of the press.
Peru's return to democracy is
viewed as a highly important
example for the rest of Latin
America by the Carter administ
ration and by the region's other
democracies, Colombia, Ven
ezuela, Costa Rica, Mexico,
Ecuador and the Dominican Re
public.
