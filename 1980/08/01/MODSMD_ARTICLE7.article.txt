# Shah's death has no effect
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The speaker of Iran's Parlia
ment says a parliamentary com
mittee will take up the question
of what to do with the American
hostages in early August,
Japanese reports from Tehran
said Monday.
At the same time, a Tehran
newspaper believed to he close
to Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr declared that the Un
ited States must "come to its
senses" and "transfer all of the
shah's assets to Iran."
On Sunday, after the death of

deposed Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi in Egypt, the Moslem
militants holding the U.S. Em
bassy reaffirmed that their hos
tages will not be freed unless the
"stolen" Pahlavi wealth is re
turned to Iran, a French radio
correspondent reported from the
Iranian capital.
Iranian officials said Sunday
the ex-shah's death would have
no effect on the hostage standoff,
but others have said it changes
the crisis to some degree.
The two "moderates" with
whom President Jimmy Carter
has tried to negotiate forso many
months — Foreign Minister
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who has
said he would no longer continue
in office, and President Bani-
Sadr, who appears to have lost
most of his power — will not be
calling the shots.
There is a possibility the mul
lahs will go ahead and solve the
hostage crisis on their own, now
they no longer need their captiv
ity as a weapon against Bani-
Sadr. There is a school of
thought that holds that the hos
tages have been kept so long pre
cisely because Bani-Sadr wanted
to get rid of them.
In sum, the optimistic apprai
sal hinges on a conviction that
post-revolutionary Iran — even
the Iran of the Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini and the mullahs —
must eventually stop ruminating
on its accumulated grievances
against the shah and his allies
and must get on with running the
country..
