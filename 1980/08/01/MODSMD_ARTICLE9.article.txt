"A Brahman would today
have a greater propensity to dine
at the home of a non-Brahman,
but he still wouldn't let a non-
Brahman into his kitchen," said
an Indian expert.
Although the ancient caste
rituals are generally acknow
ledged to be on the wane at vir
tually every level of society, the
caste system is in little danger of
extinction.
"Caste isn't dying. It's merely
changing its form," said Dr. K.L.
Sharmaof the Institute for Social
Systems in New Delhi. "It is still
the most important social iden
tifier, but is now more a system
of power relationships."
Today, caste distinction and
caste interests define issues and
influence the choice of political
candidates and political patron
age at nearly all levels of the sys
tem.
The new political role of caste
is likened to that of ethnic pull in
New York City politics.
Every New York City politi
cian denies he is appealing to
ethnic prejudices, just as his In
dian counterpart speaks against

caste, hut each knows it's the key
and shapes his campaign around
it.
Like racial prejudice in the
United States, caste bias thrives
even though it is universally con
demned by India's politicians
and is outlawed by the constitu
tion.
But the demands of the demo
cratic process are slowly working
to change the shape of the caste
system, in many cases forcing
down barriers between castes
with similar interests.
The marriage bond continues
to define the limits of caste, and
there remains great pressure to
marry within one's own caste,
sociologists say.
Originally, there were just
four castes in India, based on ra
cial differences that existed 30
centuries or more before Christ.
Today, according to some esti
mates, there are as many as
3000. One's primary caste might
be based on religion, one's sub
caste on location and sub-sub
caste on occupation.
"It's been with us for 2000
years." one observer said of the
caste systtem. "I would say it's
good for 1000 more."
