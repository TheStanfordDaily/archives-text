# Sculpture finally completed
## Albers Wall dedicated 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
Almost a decade after its in
ception, Josef Albers' controver
sial Stanford Wall was dedicated
last Friday before a gathering of
more than 120 people.
University President Donald
Kennedy, in his first day in of
fice, began the ceremony
acknowledging the controversy
surrounding the Wall's construc
tion.
"Modern art on a heroic scale
simply does not readily yield to
consensus. Even to those who
may not like it.it belongs here
because it merits — indeed
commands — attention to the ar
tist's purpose and to its own
place in the diverse catalog of
artistic ventures."
Nicholas Fox Weber, execu
tive director of the Josef Albers
Foundation, quoted Albers.
"To distribute material pos
sessions is to divide them .To dis
tribute spiritual possessions is to
multiply them."
Weber thanked Art History
Professor Albert Elsen, official
sponsor and fund raiser for the
project, and architect Robert
Mittelstadt of San Francisco,
who was in charge of the con
struction, for their efforts in br
inging the Wall to completion.
Elsen then spoke, saying Al
bers "belonged to the great gen
eration of modernists that in
cluded Picasso, Miro, and
Matisse, who saw the artist as in
dispensable not to practical life
but to the vigor of culture.
"Albers wanted this unique
sculpture ... to stand in a uni
versity community. It is a way of
affirming to teachers and stu
dents he would never know that
art and science are not enemy
faculties, but complementary
disciplines," Elsen concluded.
The work is located in Lomita

Mall between the Quad and the
Physics Tank. It is 53 feet long,
nine feet high, and one foot wide.
One side has round black steel
rods inlaid into the mortar of
white brick, while the other has
square stainless steel rods in
geometric shapes on smooth
black granite.
Josef Albers was an interna
tionally known artist and a major
figure in the development of
abstract art. He was born in
Germany in 1888, attended and
taught at the Bauhaus, a re
nowned school of art there, and
came to America in 1933. He
taught at the Black Mountain
College in North Carolina and
then at Yale, where he stayed
until his death in 1976.
According to Neal Benezra,
an art history graduate student

doing his dissertation on the
Wall, Albers was contacted in
1971 by Peninsula collector
Harry Anderson about the
commissioning of a relief
sculpture. Albers submitted the
final design in 1973.
Though there were some de
lays in construction due to the
precision of the work, the major
difficulty was finding a location
that did not meet severe resis
tance.
A site beside the Stanford
Museum was approved, but was
found to not provide the proper
space for viewing the work, Be
nezra said. The proposal of using
the Canfield Mall in front of the
law school generated so much
protest that the site was never
approved.

YES, IT'S ART — The Albers Wall, created by the late sculptor Josef Albers, was dedicated Friday.
The Wall, which is on Lomita Mull, was completed after several years of controversy and work.
The final location in front of
the Physics Tank was decided
upon despite complaints from
faculty and staff in nearby build
ings that it blocks the view in that
area.
Elsen'ssummarizing comment
on the long dispute was " If it we
ren't controversial, it wouldn't
be authentic modern art."
