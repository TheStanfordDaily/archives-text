# Governors evade Carter issue
## 
### David Broder The Washington Post 
DENVER— Backers of Pres
ident Jimmy Carter passed up an
easy propaganda victory yester
day when they declined to ask
Democratic governors to en
dorse Carter's stand on the
"open-convention" controversy,
and campaign chairman Robert
Strauss hinted that the issue may
be finessed at next week's na
tional convention as well.
After a breakfast caucus of
Democratic governors domi
nated by the president's backers
broke up without a vote on the
issue, Strauss suggested at a
press conference that the "loy
alty rule" to which Sen. Edward
Kennedy and "open conven
tion" forces object may never be
applied.
Asked if the Carter forces
might consider releasing their
delegates to' "vote their consci
ences," after the rule has been
formally adopted next Monday,
Strauss said, "We might do that.
You never know."
It was the broadest hint yet
given by the Carter high com
mand that the rules controversy,
which has been at the center of
the frantic maneuvering by

Democrats out to dump Carter,
may be mooted on the conven
tion floor.
When reporters pressed him
on the point, the campaign
chairman first backed away, say
ing "We have never had any dis
cussion" about releasing the
Carter delegates, as Kennedy
has already offered to release his
own.
But then he added. "I'm not
going to do anything that indi
cates a lack of confidence in our
delegates staying with us.*' And
he predicted that Carter would
enjoy "a net gain in strength" if
all the delegates — including
Kennedy's — were freed from
the commitments they made at
the time of their selection.
Strauss' comments indicated
no softening in the Carter forces'
determination to defeat the chal
lenge by the Kennedy camp and
some uncommitted Democrats
to the proposed convention rule
allowing tlie replacement of any
delegate who threatens to violate
his or her candidate pledge.
Strauss claimed — and ex-
Gov. Patrick Lucey of Wiscon
sin. deputy chairman of the Ken
nedy campaign, confirmed —
that if the Carter forces had

pushed for a vote at the caucus
held yesterday morning during
the annual meeting of the Na
tional Governors Association,
the "loyalty" rule would have
been endorsed by 18 of the 24
Democrats in the room.
Both Strauss and Gov. Bill
Clinton of Arkansas, the pro-
Carter caucus chairman, said
they did not seek a vote in the
interests of post-convention
party harmony.
