## Canal battle not over 
### 
"In a sense, the history ot
Southern California is the record
of its eternal quest for water, and
more water, anu still more wa
ter,'" wrote Carey McWilliams
more than thirty years ago.
On July IS. 19S0 Governor
Jerry Brown signed into law a bill
that would end Southern
California's quest for water
through the year 2030. The legis
lation known as the 'Peripheral
Canal Bill" is a disaster in dis
guise.
While the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California
rejoices in the wake of the can
al's legislative victory, norther
ners and environmentalists are
preparing a counterattack.
State Senator John
Garamendi of Walnut Grove,
who calls the Peripheral Canal
the "Dracula Ditch," is
spearheading a statewide re
ferendum drive that would sub
mit the Peripheral Canal bill to
popular vote.
Garamendi's group (the
California Coalition Against the
Peripheral Canal) have vowed to
prevent implementation of the
last planned expansion of the
State Water Project.
Other groups such as the En
vironmental Defense Fund and
the San Francisco Bay Area
Conservation League have
promised legal action that will tic
up the bill in the courts.
Their motivation for opposing
the bill is fear. The Peripheral
Canal might just destroy the San
Francisco Bay and turn the delta
into a salt water marsh.
Delta farmers oppose the bill
because it means that water they
once received for free will now
have to be bought from the state.
Most northern Bay area resi
dents tear the canal because it
gives Southern California con
trol over the faucet for their
plumbing.
Southern water officials and

large landowners such as J.G.
Boswell and the Irvine Company
will lead the battle to defeat
northern opponents to the Canal
bill. The landowners' mo
tives are economic; a steady
water supply means that de
velopment of new housing tracts
can continue.
MWD needs the water to meet
customer demands through the
year 2000. It was rumored that
even without legislative ap
proval, the MWD would have
constructed the canal with its
own public funds. Even with
legislative approval, the MWD
will end up paying two-thirds of
the cost of the $7 billion water
project.
What is ironic about this water
battle is that no group is likely to
come out a winner. The flaw is
that the philosophy of Califor
nia's water delivery system is
bad: we use energy to pump
water and we subsidize large
farmholders by selling them
surplus water at public expense.
The big farm holdings waste
water by growing rice, sugar
beets and livestock foods. These
are crops that provide immediate
high economic return but rape
the land for future generations to
use.
To get water into Southern
California requires that the
water be lifted by gigantic pumps
2300 feet over the Tehachapi
Mountains.
The electrical costs for pump
ing this water was negotiated 20
years ago at 0.3 cents per
kilowatt hour â€” can you imagine
what the new rates will be when
the contract expires in 1983?
And we will be pumping three
times the amount of water over
the mountains.
The battle over water has be
gun.
