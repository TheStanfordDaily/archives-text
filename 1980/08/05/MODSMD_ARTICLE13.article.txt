## Phrase destroys logical opponents 
### 
I've found a great new gadget.
It gets me out of all of those pre
viously frightening situations
when 1 feel intimidated by some
one who seems to know more
about something than I do. Until
now, challenges and contradic
tions were impossible to deal
with.
But now I've got my "I don't
believe that." Yes, it's a simple
device, and it's easily adapted to
nearly all of your household con
frontations.
If anvone ever tells me that

I'm wrong, I can just whip out
this little gem and boldly shout" I
don't believe that!" I am thus
freed of all responsibility for my
thoughts, actions and words. It's
great.
Often when reading books, I'll
see a way of life similar to mine
brutally satirized. No problem.
In these instances I don't even
have to say it. I just think " I don't
believe that." and my conscience
is clear again. It's that powerful.
The best thing about this mira
cle apparatus is the remarkable
way that it cripples the arrogant
fools who are constantly trying to
prove me wrong. The pattern
rarely varies.
They'll deliver their argument,
usually attempting to appear
humble, and try to convince me
that I should want to change my
ways. They naively think that
they've got all of my possible de
fenses covered, and that I'm fal
ling for the sincerity bit.
It is right as they finish (timing
is very important) that I draw
from the hip my all
encompassing "I don't believe
that" and fire it right between
the ears.
They have no idea of how to
react. No possible response can
compete with me, let alone de
feat me. Some of the more noble
ones actually admit being con
quered:
"Well, I guess there's nothing
I can say to that," they'll say.
Then I stroll away trium
phantly.

The most amazing part of this
invention is that it's so easy to
use. Four small words can render
even the most confident
preacher defenseless; or offense
less.
Yeah, 1 could take the time to
learn why their arguments never
stand up to mine, and why I'm
always right, hut why bother?
This weapon is extremely
powerful. I feel that I must make
this warning before I advocate
it's widespread use. When used
properly, "I don't believe that"
can be a loyal companion and
can reduce any self-righteous
holy roller into a babbling mass
of meaningless subjects and
verbs.
It must be operated with the
utmost discretion, though. If not
used wisely, "I don't believe
that" can induce a chronic (and
sometimes even unjustified)
overconfidence and sense of sec
urity in the user. This is just what
we arc fighting against, so be
very careful.
1 hear that the same people
who brought us this phenome
non are now developing a "So
what?" device. It isn't quite as
powerful as the"I don't believe
that," but it can be used in many
more situations. I would recom
mend owning both, for if one of
them ever fails, you'll need a
back-up.
