Reporting inaccurate
John Mason incorrectly stated
(Daily, August 1 ) that
"America, alone among western
powers, has chosen to finance a
mercenary military force." In
fact. Great Britain, the birth
place of representative govern
ment and individual liberty, has
also rejected conscription in
favor of a "mercenary" (i.e.,
volunteer) force.
But it is less Mason's manifold
factual inaccuraciesthan his gen
eral espousal of an authoritarian
conservative ideology which re
quires a reply.
To defend his support for the
draft and his general call for ab
ject submission to governmental
authority and power. Mason
quotes John Kennedy's famous
bit of rhetoric: "Ask not what
your country can do for you; ask
what you can do for your coun
try."
Economist and anarchist
David Friedman has suggested
that Kennedy's statement be re
placed by a more honest and
realistic alternative: "Ask not
what the government can do for
you. Ask what the government is
doing to you."
Exhibiting the zeal for blind
obedience, faith and self
sacrifice that is typical of conser
vatives, Mason cites "the failure
of Americans to be led" and our
"failure to show any willingness
to . . . sacrifice" as the causes of
"the decadence of our common
spirit."
Mason has, it seems, forgotten
the historical basis of the Ameri
can spirit. The American herit
age consists not of a lemming
like willingness to be led. an ea
gerness to engage in self
sacrifice or a child-like faith in
government leaders.

The American spirit is histori
cally grounded in a jealous and
determined defense of personal
liberties against the state, an un
yielding skepticism and hostility
towards government and a re
fusal to he sacrificed to serve the
whim of kings, politicians and
other madmen in authority.
It is the right to "the pursuit of
happiness" — not the duty to
practice self-sacrifice — which is
the core of the American tradi
tion.
In recent decades, this nation
has unfortunately trod the path
of self-sacrifice and government
"leadership" advocated by au
toritarian conservatives like Ma
son: the result is the multiple
crises and disasters which we
face today.
It's time to abandon that reac
tionary path and return to the
revolutionary libertarian princi
ples enunciated by Thoreau, Jef
ferson and the other fathers of
the American spirit.

Upon my return from a trip,
my associates in the Linus Paul
ing Institute of Science and
Medicine have asked me to
clarify some statements by Ed
ward A si a no in his report (Daily,
July 11) on my lecture on vita
min Cand cancer in the Stanford
NASA-ASEE Aerospace
Technology Seminar. These
statements, which are untrue or
grossly misleading, refer to a
matter that I did not mention in
my lecture.
First. Dr. Arthur B. Robinson
was removed by the Board of
Trustees of the institute from his
positions with the institute be
cause he refused to obey instruc

tions given him by the hoard, not
because of experiments that in
dicated that vitamin C in small
doses increased the frequency of
cancer in mice, as stated by
Asiano.
Second, the article stated in
correctly that the experiments on
skin cancer in 900 mice were de
signed and managed by Dr.
Robinson. In fact, the ideas of
studying vitamin C and raw fruits
and vegetables in relation to
cancer in mice and other
laboratory animals were origi
nated by me, and I also selected
skin cancer in hairless mice as the
system to study.
I then asked Dr. Robinson if
he would assist me by the day
to-day supervision of the pro
ject, and he agreed to do so. Be
cause of this activity he might
feel justified in saying that he
managed the project; but he
managed it for me, and he did
not design it.
Third, although a small
amount of vitamin C added to a
standard diet increased the
number of tumors for one group
of mice, the increase is not statis
tically significant, a point that
is ignored by Dr. Robinson and
Mr. Asiano. The statistically sig
nificant observations are that
added vitamin C decreases the
number of tumors.
I regret that Mr. Asiano did
not check his article with me. Not
only could the incorrect state
ments have been eliminated, but
also a better account of the strik
ing observations about vitamin C
and human cancer made by my
associate Dr. Ewan Cameron
could have been presented to the
readers of the Daily.

Second, the article stated in
correctly that the experiments on
skin cancer in 900 mice were de
signed and managed by Dr.
Robinson. In fact, the ideas of
studying vitamin C and raw fruits
and vegetables in relation to
cancer in mice and other
laboratory animals were origi
nated by me, and I also selected
skin cancer in hairless mice as the
system to study.
I then asked Dr. Robinson if
he would assist me by the day
to-day supervision of the pro
ject, and he agreed to do so. Be
cause of this activity he might
feel justified in saying that he
managed the project; but he
managed it for me, and he did
not design it.
Third, although a small
amount of vitamin C added to a
standard diet increased the
number of tumors for one group
of mice, the increase is not statis
tically significant, a point that
is ignored by Dr. Robinson and
Mr. Asiano. The statistically sig
nificant observations are that
added vitamin C decreases the
number of tumors.
I regret that Mr. Asiano did
not check his article with me. Not
only could the incorrect state
ments have been eliminated, but
also a better account of the strik
ing observations about vitamin C
and human cancer made by my
associate Dr. Ewan Cameron
could have been presented to the
readers of the Daily.

Reporting inaccurate
John Mason incorrectly stated
(Daily, August 1 ) that
"America, alone among western
powers, has chosen to finance a
mercenary military force." In
fact. Great Britain, the birth
place of representative govern
ment and individual liberty, has
also rejected conscription in
favor of a "mercenary" (i.e.,
volunteer) force.
But it is less Mason's manifold
factual inaccuraciesthan his gen
eral espousal of an authoritarian
conservative ideology which re
quires a reply.
To defend his support for the
draft and his general call for ab
ject submission to governmental
authority and power. Mason
quotes John Kennedy's famous
bit of rhetoric: "Ask not what
your country can do for you; ask
what you can do for your coun
try."
Economist and anarchist
David Friedman has suggested
that Kennedy's statement be re
placed by a more honest and
realistic alternative: "Ask not
what the government can do for
you. Ask what the government is
doing to you."
Exhibiting the zeal for blind
obedience, faith and self
sacrifice that is typical of conser
vatives, Mason cites "the failure
of Americans to be led" and our
"failure to show any willingness
to . . . sacrifice" as the causes of
"the decadence of our common
spirit."
Mason has, it seems, forgotten
the historical basis of the Ameri
can spirit. The American herit
age consists not of a lemming
like willingness to be led. an ea
gerness to engage in self
sacrifice or a child-like faith in
government leaders.

The American spirit is histori
cally grounded in a jealous and
determined defense of personal
liberties against the state, an un
yielding skepticism and hostility
towards government and a re
fusal to he sacrificed to serve the
whim of kings, politicians and
other madmen in authority.
It is the right to "the pursuit of
happiness" — not the duty to
practice self-sacrifice — which is
the core of the American tradi
tion.
In recent decades, this nation
has unfortunately trod the path
of self-sacrifice and government
"leadership" advocated by au
toritarian conservatives like Ma
son: the result is the multiple
crises and disasters which we
face today.
It's time to abandon that reac
tionary path and return to the
revolutionary libertarian princi
ples enunciated by Thoreau, Jef
ferson and the other fathers of
the American spirit.

Upon my return from a trip,
my associates in the Linus Paul
ing Institute of Science and
Medicine have asked me to
clarify some statements by Ed
ward A si a no in his report (Daily,
July 11) on my lecture on vita
min Cand cancer in the Stanford
NASA-ASEE Aerospace
Technology Seminar. These
statements, which are untrue or
grossly misleading, refer to a
matter that I did not mention in
my lecture.
First. Dr. Arthur B. Robinson
was removed by the Board of
Trustees of the institute from his
positions with the institute be
cause he refused to obey instruc

tions given him by the hoard, not
because of experiments that in
dicated that vitamin C in small
doses increased the frequency of
cancer in mice, as stated by
Asiano.
