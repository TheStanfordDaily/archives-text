Walter Reinhold, chairman and chief execu
tive officer of Varco International, Inc., the
world's largest manufacturer of oil field drilling
and production equipment, has made a gift of
one million dollars to the School of Engineer
ing. Reinhold donated this money to the Uni
versity as a memorial to his father, Baldwin
Reinhold, Sr., saying that it "gives effect to my
father's enthusiasm for Stanford."
According to Timothy Kennedy, personal
lawyer to Reinhold and Varco International,
Reinhold, Sr. was not college educated. How
ever, he numbered many Stanford graduates
among his close friends, read University publi
cations and often visited the campus where he
maintained a special interest in the Hoover Lib
rary Archives.
Walter Reinhold is a graduate of Stanford,
where he received his A.B. in history in 1949.
According to Reinhold, the gift also "expresses
my own appreciation to the University for in
troducing me to the science and humanities."
Reinhold. Sr., a Swiss German immigrant,
came to the United States in 1905. Settling in
Southern California, he continued his trade as a
metal worker specializing in heat treatment.
Soon after he began heat treating the rather
primitive tools used in the drilling of oil at that
time, and in 1908 he formed Varco Interna-

tional, Inc.
In 1975 Reinhold, Sr. retired and his son,
Walter, become chairman of the company.
Reinhold. Sr. died in 1976 and in December ot
1979 Reinhold set up a trust fund for Stanford,
transferring one million dollars ot Varco Inter
national common stock to the fund. The present
value of the stock is estimated to be $ 1.9 million
dollars. The shares will pass over to Stanford at
the time of Reinhold's death at their full value.
According to Kennedy, the legal process in
volved in establishing the trust fund was not
complicated and in fact is becoming a "common
device" that is "gaining in popularity" because
it benefits both the recipient and the creator of
the trust fund.
However, Kennedy was quick to add that the
donation is a reflection of the benefactor and
indeed Reinhold is a "fascinating" and well
liked man who is "devoted to academic excel
lence."
Reinhold has specified that the funds be used
at the discretion of the University, however, it is
expected that they will be used in the endow
ment of a professorship in the School of En
gineering, or in the creation of graduate fellow
ships.
Then-President Richard Lyman called the
donation a "magnificent gift" saying that "we
are extremely grateful to Mr. Reinhold for his
generosity."
