A pretended plane crashes in
the baylands. Thirty injured
people are scattered on the
ground, suffering from com
pound fractures, burns and
punctured intestines, while three
doctors, one sipping coffee,
stand by.
The scene was the first phase
of Stanford Hospital's simulated
disaster drill last Tuesday morn
ing.
The drill is designed to test the
hospital's reflexes in the event of
a calamity. It also provides a
"learning and training exercise
for the new house staff and
nurses," said Dr. Jan Ehren
werth, the disaster control of
ficer.
During the drill, the patients
arrive in ambulances and are met
by teams of hospital employees,
each manning their stations.
They quickly route the injured
and simulate treatment. All the
hospital departments are in
volved in the drills, including
housekeeping and gift shop
workers.
Scheduled well in advance, the
point of the exercise, "is not just
to have things run smoothly. The
surprise element isn't as impor
tant as getting as many people as
possible involved, said Dr.
Ehrenwerth.
Things didn't always run
smoothly. There was nearly a
real accident when a Coast
Guard helicopter, testing the
heliport procedures, landed with
an engine smoking. The crew

jumped from the chopper and
ran. tearing it might catch on tire,
while police and sight-seers
looked on. thinking it part of the
drill.
Inside, the patients were hand
led quickly, but with some confu
sion. A patient with a simulated
concussion and neck fracture
had his head slammed into a wall
while his gurney was loaded into
an elevator.
The bi-annual disaster drill is a
Joint Commission of Hospital
Accreditation requirement, and
not popular with all the staff.

which are real problems ot pre

of simulation. Dr. Ehrenwerth.

admitted hiding out at first dur

A debriefing followed the
drill, where all the problems and
