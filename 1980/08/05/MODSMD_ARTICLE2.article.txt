WASHINGTON (AP)
President Jimmy Carter said last
night that he does not plan to
release his Democratic delegate
majority from pledges to vote for
his renomination next week in
New York.
Carter asserted that what Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
seeks is not an open convention
hut a brokered nomination that
would ignore the will of the vot
ers.
The president told a nationally
broadcast news conference that
" neither I nor any member of my
administration has violated any
law or committed any impropri
ety" in the case of brother Billy's
dealings with 1 .ibya.
The Billy Carter affair has be
come a selling point for the pres
ident's challengers as they seek
to sway Democratic National
Convention delegates to vote
against a rule binding nominat
ing votes to the outcome of
Democratic primary elections
and caucuses.
Since Carter won a majority of
the delegates in those elections
and caucuses, the rule would
guarantee his renomination
when the Democratic National
Convention votes one week 112 rom
tomorrow. The convention
opens next Monday, with a vote
on the delegate-binding rule as
the first major test of strength

between Carter and challenger
Kennedy.
Carter said he has no plans to
heed the demands of Kennedy
and others, including Senate
Democratic Leader Robert
Byrd. that the delegates be re
leased from their commitments.
"1 ran in all the primaries, all
the caucuses," Carter said. "In
that intense political competition
I won about 60 percent ol the
commitments of the delegates."
He said "these are not mv de
legates. they're the voters' dele
gates."
While Kennedy and other
Democrats talk of an open con
vention, Carter said, the phrase
is "a gross misnomer
"What they actually are cal
ling for is a brokered com ention
to induce those delegates to \ iol
ate their signed pledge or oath "
Carter said.
He said all the candidates
knew the rules before they ran.
and so did the people who were
elected delegates. He said to
undo the commitments forged in
the primaries would reverse a
decade of Democratic reforms
that were intended to remove the
nominating process from the
hands of the power brokers unci
put it in the hands <>/ the voters.
The Billy Carter affair was the
dominant topic at an extraordi
nary, hour-long news confer
ence, one week before the open-
ing gavel of the Democratic Na
tional Convention.
In a 15-minute opening state
ment, Carter declared that
"neither I nor any member of my
administration has violated any
law or committed any impropri
ety" in the case of brother Billy
and his dealings with the gov
ernment of Libya.
"We are extremely close. I
love him and he loves me."
Carter said Billy is a colorful
personality, a man thrust into the
national limelight when he be
came president, and he spoke of
Billy Carter's treatment for al
coholism.
The president called his ef
forts — unsuccessful — to dis
suade Billy from traveling to
Libya, saying that his effort was
for Billy's good as well as the good
of the nation.
Carter said he is not aware of
any efforts by his brother to af
fect U.S. policy toward Libya. "I

am certain that he made no such
efforts with me," Carter said.
He said the only situation in
which Billy's dealings with L ibya
did involve government policy
was in the effort to enlist that
government's support in efforts
to gain release of the American
hostages in Iran.
The president said his brother
has not tried to influence ad
ministration policy toward
Libya.

The Billy Carter affair was the
dominant topic at an extraordi
nary, hour-long news confer
ence, one week before the open-
ing gavel of the Democratic Na
tional Convention.
In a 15-minute opening state
ment, Carter declared that
"neither I nor any member of my
administration has violated any
law or committed any impropri
ety" in the case of brother Billy
and his dealings with the gov
ernment of Libya.
"We are extremely close. I
love him and he loves me."
Carter said Billy is a colorful
personality, a man thrust into the
national limelight when he be
came president, and he spoke of
Billy Carter's treatment for al
coholism.
The president called his ef
forts — unsuccessful — to dis
suade Billy from traveling to
Libya, saying that his effort was
for Billy's good as well as the good
of the nation.
Carter said he is not aware of
any efforts by his brother to af
fect U.S. policy toward Libya. "I

am certain that he made no such
efforts with me," Carter said.
He said the only situation in
which Billy's dealings with L ibya
did involve government policy
was in the effort to enlist that
government's support in efforts
to gain release of the American
hostages in Iran.
The president said his brother
has not tried to influence ad
ministration policy toward
Libya.
