# Mass Media Institute offers practical training

### Sidra Watts Staff Writer 
Jules Dundes. director of the
Mass Media Institute, smiles
often with what appears to be
ever-present calm and con'
dences. His office, strewn w
pencils, papers, notebooks, tape
recorders, radios and closed
circuit tele\ isoins. looks like part
of the set design for All The Pres
ident's Men.
Director of the Institute for
the past seven years. Dundes
quietly considers the Mass
Media program announced on
bold blue and yellow posters de
corating almost every narrow
corridor of Redwood Hall. The
38th Annual Mass Media Insti
tute began June 23 and ends Au
gust 16.

The University's Mass Media
Institute is "possibly the best" of
the media programs offered
around the country, according to
Dundes. It includes five work
shops: Film Production, Broad
cast News and Public Affairs.
Mass Media, Television Produc
tion and Journalism. Each prog
ram is designed as pre
professional training and pro
vides a theoretical and practical
orientation to the media.
Mark Stephens, who teaches
editorial techniques during the
regular school term as well as
during the summer, said he and
the other Communication De
partment faculty want to make
the learning experience as prac
tical as possible.
"We try to offer the best we

can ... to make the summer ses
sion a simulation of real world
media situations and indoctri
nate the students into what the
real world is like," he said.
This practical orientation
stems in part from the Institute's
beginnings. Organized in 1942,
the program served as a "vehicle
for training women in journalism
to fill the vacancies left as men
around the country were drafted
during the war," Dundee
explained.
"We've expanded the prog
ram to include TV Production
and the Journalism Program.
The other three have been part
ot the Institute going back 10
years or so and we've expanded

the academic courses to include
Broadcast Writing, TV Aesthe
tics and Mass Communication
Law in addition to the work
shops," he said.
Janet Scoutten, an under
graduate majoring in Communi
cation is studying film produc
tion this summer because "it's
more intensive training all at
once, instead of spread out in
various courses during the school
year.
"The first day you're here,
they hand you a camera and you
start making films ... it's a good
way to prepare for a career in
film making and I'd strongly re
commend it to anyone," Scout
ten said.
The regular academic mem

hers of the Department of
Communication and working
professionals in news broadcast
ing and film teach the Institute
classes. Fifty students are regis
tered this summer.
"Many of the students who've
studied here have gone into in
dustry and are scattered across
the country. They write back
with the best kind of comments,"
Dundes said. He declined to
mention his past students, "for
fear I'd forget someone," but
said "you'd recognize some of
the names."
The telephone rings. The tele
vision is turned on by another
student who breezes in. The tape
recorder is moved to the back of
the desk. Jules Dundes smiles
again.
