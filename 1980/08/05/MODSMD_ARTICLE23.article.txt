## Sun, fun and diversity characterize Poco show 
### 
Poco, Dave Mason and Huey
Lewis and the News shared an
attractive bill of faire Sunday af
ternoon in Stanford's Frost Am
phitheater. Sponsored by
ASSU-Special Events, this con
cert offering brought together
three bands who differ widely in
style and energy. Performing
cuts from their latest Ip releases
along with familiar singles, these
artists successfully catered to a
variety of rock 'n' roll prefer
ences.
Huey Lewis and the News was
just simply an outstanding open
ing act. The group is a stylish,
well-toned, high-calibre New
Wave act which is quickly be
coming a Bay area favorite. Re
cently back from a stint on the
English rock scene, Huey has
rounded up a fine bunch of local
musicians.
Their debut album is a solid
effort and, like the music of other
New Wave bands, gains momen
tum on stage. The band did
"Some Of My Lies Are True
(Sooner or Later)," "Trouble in

Paradise," "Hearts" and "Who
Cares," among other tunes from
the album. Front man and voc
alist Huey Lewis also added a
stinging harmonica and John
Colla's saxophone filled out the
groups' foot-stomping rhythms.
Dave Mason also brought a
distinct liveliness to the stage as
he performed many of the hit
singles he has enjoyed since his
departure from Traffic. He and
his band, which features Steve
Krueger on guitar, did "Take It
To The Limits," "Only You
Know And 1 Know"and "We
Just Disagree." Mason also per
formed lengthier versions of
"Feelin' Alright" and Rod
Stewart's hit,"Keep Me Hangin"
On."
Favoring the audience with his
"blasts from the past," Mason
performed tunes by two of his
major musical influences. Bob
Dylan and Sam Cooke. Fans
clamored for his elaborate edi
tion of "All Along The Watch
tower." Sam Cooke's classic
"Bring It On Home To Me" was

somewhat overdone but still in
teresting. Mason's latest album is
entitled, intriguingly enough.
Old Crest Of A New Wave. The
band did "Paralyzed" and
"You're A Friend of Mine" from
that effort.
Barring the unrelenting,
brain-scrambling August sun
and a few minor technical prob
lems, the concert to the point was
energetic and unimpeachable in
content and presentation. Poco
delivered a mellower and some
what more subdued set than the
preceeding two acts.
The band's latest album.
Under The Gun, is aiso the title
of their current single. Poco also
did several cuts from this album
including " Reputation," a popu
lar though suspect theme in to
day's rock 'n' roll. "Made of

Stone" and "Friends In The Dis
tance." Acoustic guitar pieces
"Crazy Love" and "Everlasting
Kind" were rich and soothing in
tone.
Though Poco's performance
was somewhat sedate for my per
sonal tastes, the absence of a
dynamic stage show should not
detract from the band's other
wise considerable musical cre
dentials. Prolific and influential,
Poco was heralded by critics as
the first major band to bridge the
gap between country-west
ern and rock genres. Pickin' Up
The Pieces, Legend and A Good
Feelin' To Know are superlative
and collectible albums.
But, alas, the band's most il
lustrious musicians departed for
greener pastures. Founding
members Jim Messina and

Richie Furay, originally with
Buffalo Springfield, went on to
solo careers. Tim Schmidt and
Randy Meisner went on to the
Eagles and Ricky Nelson's Stone
Canyon Band, respectively. As
the ranks thinned down to the
Paul Cotton/Steve Cropper in
fluence, some of the inspiration
and energy has naturally eroded
in the process.
Nonetheless, Poco was en
joyed by many and appear to be
undainted by their turnovers in
personnel. All in all, not includ
ing third degree burns from the
sun, Sunday's outing was one of
the most enjoyable outdoor con
certs I have seen in years, at
Stanford or elsewhere. Look for
Jefferson Starship, August 31, in
Frost when they perform a be
nefit for the Community Associ
ation for the Retarded.

formed lengthier versions of
"Feelin' Alright" and Rod
Stewart's hit,"Keep Me Hangin"
On."
Favoring the audience with his
"blasts from the past," Mason
performed tunes by two of his
major musical influences. Bob
Dylan and Sam Cooke. Fans
clamored for his elaborate edi
tion of "All Along The Watch
tower." Sam Cooke's classic
"Bring It On Home To Me" was

somewhat overdone but still in
teresting. Mason's latest album is
entitled, intriguingly enough.
Old Crest Of A New Wave. The
band did "Paralyzed" and
"You're A Friend of Mine" from
that effort.
Barring the unrelenting,
brain-scrambling August sun
and a few minor technical prob
lems, the concert to the point was
energetic and unimpeachable in
content and presentation. Poco
delivered a mellower and some
what more subdued set than the
preceeding two acts.
The band's latest album.
Under The Gun, is aiso the title
of their current single. Poco also
did several cuts from this album
including " Reputation," a popu
lar though suspect theme in to
day's rock 'n' roll. "Made of

Stone" and "Friends In The Dis
tance." Acoustic guitar pieces
"Crazy Love" and "Everlasting
Kind" were rich and soothing in
tone.
Though Poco's performance
was somewhat sedate for my per
sonal tastes, the absence of a
dynamic stage show should not
detract from the band's other
wise considerable musical cre
dentials. Prolific and influential,
Poco was heralded by critics as
the first major band to bridge the
gap between country-west
ern and rock genres. Pickin' Up
The Pieces, Legend and A Good
Feelin' To Know are superlative
and collectible albums.
But, alas, the band's most il
lustrious musicians departed for
greener pastures. Founding
members Jim Messina and

Richie Furay, originally with
Buffalo Springfield, went on to
solo careers. Tim Schmidt and
Randy Meisner went on to the
Eagles and Ricky Nelson's Stone
Canyon Band, respectively. As
the ranks thinned down to the
Paul Cotton/Steve Cropper in
fluence, some of the inspiration
and energy has naturally eroded
in the process.
Nonetheless, Poco was en
joyed by many and appear to be
undainted by their turnovers in
personnel. All in all, not includ
ing third degree burns from the
sun, Sunday's outing was one of
the most enjoyable outdoor con
certs I have seen in years, at
Stanford or elsewhere. Look for
Jefferson Starship, August 31, in
Frost when they perform a be
nefit for the Community Associ
ation for the Retarded.
Poco, Dave Mason and Huey
Lewis and the News shared an
attractive bill of faire Sunday af
ternoon in Stanford's Frost Am
phitheater. Sponsored by
ASSU-Special Events, this con
cert offering brought together
three bands who differ widely in
style and energy. Performing
cuts from their latest Ip releases
along with familiar singles, these
artists successfully catered to a
variety of rock 'n' roll prefer
ences.
Huey Lewis and the News was
just simply an outstanding open
ing act. The group is a stylish,
well-toned, high-calibre New
Wave act which is quickly be
coming a Bay area favorite. Re
cently back from a stint on the
English rock scene, Huey has
rounded up a fine bunch of local
musicians.
Their debut album is a solid
effort and, like the music of other
New Wave bands, gains momen
tum on stage. The band did
"Some Of My Lies Are True
(Sooner or Later)," "Trouble in

Paradise," "Hearts" and "Who
Cares," among other tunes from
the album. Front man and voc
alist Huey Lewis also added a
stinging harmonica and John
Colla's saxophone filled out the
groups' foot-stomping rhythms.
Dave Mason also brought a
distinct liveliness to the stage as
he performed many of the hit
singles he has enjoyed since his
departure from Traffic. He and
his band, which features Steve
Krueger on guitar, did "Take It
To The Limits," "Only You
Know And 1 Know"and "We
Just Disagree." Mason also per
formed lengthier versions of
"Feelin' Alright" and Rod
Stewart's hit,"Keep Me Hangin"
On."
