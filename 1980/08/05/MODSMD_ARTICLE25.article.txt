## Despite difficulties, Allman Bros, stay hot 
### 
Well folks. Old Ralice hit
another Southern Rock show
this weekend. Friday night at the
Oakland Auditorium the
Allman Brothers Band showed
themselves to be the originators
and masters of the genre once
again.
Opening their hour and half
set with "Don't Want You No

More" and "It's Not My Cross to
Bear," the Brothers played in
their original hard-driving
blues-rock style. After guitarist
Duane Allman and bassist Berry
Oakley died in the early '70s, the
addition of pianist Chuck
Leavell gave the Brothers a dis
tinctly jazz-like flavor, which led
to conflicts within the band. It
eventually contributed to their

dissolution, with Leavell and
drummer Jai Johnny Johnson
starting the jazz-fusion band Sea
Level, Dickie Betts starting
Great Southern and Gregg
Allman getting detoxified.
After the completion of those
three ventures, the band reun
ited to put out Enlightened
Rogues, an album reminescent of

their earlier efforts like Idlewild
South.
Although currently working
on some new material, the band
was content to play mostly old
songs, including such classic
tunes as "Whipping Post."
Featuring ex-Great Southern
bassist David Goldflies, "Whip
ping Post" evoked the old
Allman Brothers perfectly.
Goldflies is an excellent bassist
as evidenced by his intricate solo
during "Pegasus" (off the En
lightened Rogues album), the
first of the band's two encores.
Never having heard Goldflies do
a solo, 1 was very impressed. I le
moved from blues to jazz with
the articulation of a master. To
ward the end of his solo, drum
mer Johnny Johnson joined in to
lay in a tight samba-like rhythm.
Also during "Pegasus," drum
mers Butch Trucks and Johnson
took a long solo, proving them
selves again to be undoubtedly
the finest rhythm section in all of
rock.
Though hampered by equip
ment difficulties, like when
Johnson's toms started walking
off stage, and when bass pedals
broke and snares snapped, the

two never missed a beat, working
off each others distinct styles
perfectly. At one point. Trucks
got up and performed a solo
within a solo on the two large
kettle drums as Johnson played
rhythm on his cymbals.
Unfortunately, the technical
difficulties during that solo car
ried over to the band's otherwise
excellent set. Both the drums
and Gregg Allmans' organ were
constantly under-miked. Feed
back and distortion from the ter
rible acoustics in the cavernous
Oakland Auditorium marred
even Dickie Betts superb guitar
playing. Because of these prob
lems, Betts seemed restrained
and didn't undertake the jams
with ex-Great Southern guitarist
Dan Toler that are their
trademark.
In this respect. Friday's show
was something of a disappoint
ment. it lacked the intensity and
creativity that characterized
their come-back appearances
last year. But it was still the
Allman Brothers, and the not
quite sellout crowd loved them,
bringing them back tor their clas
sic "Rambling Man," their final
encore.
