## Les 						Brown: still renowned 
### 
Les Brown's group fully lived
up to its billing as "The Band of
Renown" by thrilling Friday
night's Flint Center audience
with a mixture of big band music
and more contemporary pieces
arranged in swing style.
Band leader Brown opened up
the performance by explaining
that "We're here to have fun"
and judging from the toe-and
hand-tapping crowd of over
1200. that's exactly what was
served up â€” as the first notes of
classics like Glenn Miller's "In

the Mood" filled the auditorium.
the "ah's" of nostalgic recogni
tion chimed in.
Most of the numbers show
cased the talents of five
saxophonists (plus occasional
appearances on sax by Brown),
three trombonists, four trumpet
ers, bassist, pianist and drum
mer, but the instrumentation was
varied and several vocalists in
cluded for particular effects.
For example, a flugelhorn solo
spiced up "On A Clear Day You
Can See Forever," and flute ac
companiment rounded out a big
band version of Billy Joe's "Just
The Way You Are."
Trombonist Stumpy Brown
put down his horn long enough

to provide energetic vocals on
"Opus One" and "Chattanooga
Choo Choo." The only distrac
tion from the swing style of these
numbers was the disco-like bass
line on the latter, noticeably out
of place in the show's format.
Considering the turbulent ebb
and flow of the '60s and the st
rain on groups caused by indi
vidual personalities and the de
mands of show business, groups
like The Rolling Stones and The
Four Seasons stand out for their
longevity. These same pressures,
plus the evolution of music from
swing to rock 'n' roll, make the
roughly half century of enter
tainment bv Brown's band all the
more remarkable.
While featuring different per
sonnel over that span, there were
quite a lew musicians onstage
Friday who count their associa
tion with the Band of Renown
not in years hut in decades.
Besides preserving the con
tinuity of the swing style, the real
benefit of this longevity is a com
plete understanding among the
hand members of their indi
vidual skills, an understanding
clearly evident in the group's
musical cohesion and smooth
transitions to and from crisp
solos.
Technically, the only real

shortcoming of the concert was
the muffling of the sound system
as heard in the balconies, par
ticularly noticeable when Brown
served as emcee with the band
playing in the background. At
least for most of the main level,
however, the sound was clear
and kept in balance as Brown
mixed microphone levels from
mid-stage.
The only other suggestion for
the performance would be the
inclusion of a program to list the
titles of the less well-known
numbers and the names of the
band members especially to give
credit on solos. Brown did an
admirable job of acknowledging

the musicians and introducing
numbers, but some of these
comments were lost in applause
or the sound system.
In contrast to the first-half
range from "Sentimental Jour
ney" of 1945 to swing versions of
Barbra Streisand's "Evergreen"
and Jim CroceV'Bad Bad Leroy
Brown," the second half perfor
mance was entirely a string of
standards. Although some of
these songs were not as readily
recognizable to post-Swing Era
members of the audience the spi
rited combination of Helen For
rest's vocals and the band's play
quickly got the listeners "in the
mood."
