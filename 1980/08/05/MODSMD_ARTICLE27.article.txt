# Jezek, Simons head Cardinals at Irvine meet
## 
### Seth Zuckerman Staff Writer 
IRVINE, Ca. â€” Billed by its organizers
as a duel between the Moscow Olympic
gold medal times and the prowess of the
American swimmers who were denied the
opportunity to compete at Moscow, the
United States Long Course National
Swimming Championshipsdrew to a close
Saturday in a Hurry of patriotism and
pageantry.
For those interested primarily in abso
lute achievement, new world records
were set in the men's and women's 200-
meter butterfly and in the men's 200-
meter individual medley. For those more
oriented towards national pride, the meet
was a time for the Americans to beat the
Moscow winning paces in 11 out of 22
non-relay Olympic events.
Many at the meet, however,
downplayed the announcers' incessant
comparisons of Swiss and final times to
the ones achieved at the Olympics. There
is no telling, they said, how the athletes
would have performed if they were com

peting directly against one another and
many said nothing could dispel the empty
feeling of not being at the Olympics. But
the hype went on nonetheless.
As Stanford swimmer John Simons
said, "They have to play it (the meet) up
to produce better times."
Simons, slashing through the water four
seconds faster than his previous best time,
took second place in the 400-meter indi
vidual medley with a time of 4:24:74.
The sophomore said, "I'm just tickled.
It's the best feeling I've ever attained in
swimming."
Stanford swimmer Linda Je/.ek, until
recently the world record holder in the
100- and 200-meter backstrokes, took
first place in both those events, to no one's
surprise. Her times, though, were about
two-and-a-half seconds slower than the
new world record and the Olympic gold
medal time. She admitted she was un
happy with her results.
"With Linda, it's more a matter of place
than time," said out-going Stanford wo
men's coach Claudia Thomas.

Stanford's Kim Carlisle came in third in
the 100-meter backstroke at 1:03:59,
slightly behind Jezek who came in at
1:03:1.6.
Jezek said that it is invalid to compare
the times achieved here to those reached
at the Olympics, especially if the Ameri
can times are bad.
People's performances were erratic,
she said, "because there was no solid goal
to aim at" after President Jimmy Carter
announced the Olympic boycott earlier
this year.
"I had a problem getting motivated in
March and February," she said.
Stanford's Bari Weick took third place
in the 800-meter, fourth place in the
1500-meter, and fifth place in the 400-
meter freestyles. According to coach Skip
Kenney, his time of 15:31 in the 1500 was
a 20-second improvement over his previ
ous best. "I think he can be the best in the
world. He's got the talent."
Dave Sims, who will be a freshman at
Stanford in the fall, took second place in
the 1500-meter freestyle.

Throughout the meet, anti-Russian
overtones ran high, from the banner in the
stands that said "We couldn't bear to be in
Moscow but we love Irvine," to the
swimmer who commented, "Let the Rus
sians play with themselves."
These overtones reached a crescendo
of sorts Saturday night when Republican
presidential candidate Ronald Reagan
was on hand to present some of the
awards.
"How were the Russians able to im
prove their swimming so much?" he
asked. "Because they used real bullets in
the starting guns." After a few more
anti-Moscow digs and a tribute to the
"free enterprise" system that will handle
the 1954 Los Angeles Olympics, he de
parted. The spectators' enthusiasm for
him was much greater than the athletes.'
First the politicans took the spotlight
away from the swimmers by keeping them
from the Olympics, now they come here
to steal our own spotlight, one coach
grumbled.
