Jailed Iranians reveal identities
At least 80 of the 172 Iranian demonstrators
jailed in Otisville. N.Y., have broken their week
long silence and provided names to federal au
thorities, enabling officials to expedite their release
or — in the case of those here illegally — their
deportation, sources said yesterday.
But, while officials were hopeful that the appa
rent shift towards cooperation on the part of the
jailed Iranians could lead to an early release for
many, concern was mounting over the health of at
least 32 others who have been hospitalized with
symptoms of malnutrition because of a hunger
strike in protest against their arrests.
Charges by Iranian religious leader, Ayatolla
Ruhollah Khomeini. Sunday, that the jailed
demonstrators were being brutalized brought em
phatic denials yesterday from prison and federal
officials.
Hurricane attacks the Caribbean
CASIRIES. St. Lucia — Hurricane Allen, the
most intense storm to ravage the eastern Carib
bean in this century, delivered a devastating swipe
at St. Lucia Island yesterday, destroying hundreds of
homes and causing at least eight deaths, officials
reported.
Weather service officials in Puerto Rico said the
killer storm was still gaining strength, with winds
peaking at 160 mph.
Weather forecasters have said that if Hurricane
Allen continues its course it could hit the United
States, but not before early next week.

Civiletti supports judicial reform
HONOLULU — Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti strongly backs legislation requiring the
federal judiciary to set up a new method of discip
lining errant judges, he told the American Bar
Association yesterday.
Civiletti said that legislation now being consi
dered by Congress to provide a new procedure for
hearing allegations of improprieties or unfitness
against judges would increase public confidence in
the quality of the judiciary. At the same time, he
said, the legislation should help preserve the inde
pendence of the judiciary guaranteed by the U.S.
Constitution.
