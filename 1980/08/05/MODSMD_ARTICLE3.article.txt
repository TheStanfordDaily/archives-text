# Occidental stock may be divested
## 
### Jim Harrow Staff Writer 
Trustee John Packard h;is in
dicated that the Board of Trus
tees may be planning to divest its
2540 shares of Occidental Pet
roleum if that company con
tinues its "socially injurious"
hazardous waste disposal prac
tices.
Packard, contacted at his San
Francisco office Fridav, said al

though "divestiture is the ap
proach of last resort ... it you
saw that the company was mak
ing no effort to resolve their
problem, then you go to divesti
ture."
On May 19. the Board concur
red with the University's Com
mission on Investment Respon
sibility's (CIR) ' unanimous re
commendation to support a stoc
kholder resolution requesting
Occidental Petroleum to estab
lish procedures tor its produc
tion, distribution, and disposal of
hazardous wastes in order to
prevent tutu re environmental
contamination and public health
hazards."
A spokesman for Occidental
said the motion was defeated
54.4 percent to 40.8 percent.
Occidental has refused to
make public its written policy re
garding its hazardous wastes ac
cording to researchers at the In
vestor Responsibility Research
Center (IRRC). _
Occidental's subsidiary.
Hooker Chemical, has been
charged with improperly dispos
ing carcinogenic and neurotoxic
wastes at Love Canal in Niagra
Falls, New York; Montague,
Michigan; and I athrop, Califor
nia. This negligence in disposing
of its chemical wastes compelled
the Trustees to conclude that
Occidental's corporate policies
caused substantial social injury.
Social iniurv is defined as the
"injurious impact which the ac
tivities of a company are found to
have on people and which dep
rive them of their right to health,
safety and other basic free
doms"
The move to divest from Occi
dental Petroleum is hampered by
Stanford's investment policy
which states that "maximum
economic return shall be the
primary criterion for the selec
tion of the University's endow
ment securities."
The ultimate financial re
commendations on managing
the University's endowment
securities comes from the Trus
tee's Investment Committee,
and not from the CIR.
The ClR's charge is to
examine issues of investment re
sponsibility involving the Uni
versity's endowment securities
and make appropriate recom
mendations for action by the
Trustees.
The CIR does not make di
vestment recommendations to
the Trustees. Instead, the Trus
tees must conclude, after exercis
ing all their shareholder rights,
that a company has made no at

tempt at alleviating socially in
jurious corporate practices
within a reasonable time. Then
the Trustees will consider the al
ternative of divestiture.
The Trustees agreed unanim
ously that Occidental Petroleum
disposal practices caused sub
stantial social injury because
"here it is a very flagrant prob
lem;" said Packard.
Part of the problem is that
some corporations are not good
citizens about cleaning up the
wastes they dump. Recent legis
lation has been passed at the
state level which holds corpora
tions criminally liable for their
waste disposal practices.
Packard believes that the "onus
is on the industry, but it's hard to
nail them down."
At the federal level, the Re
source Conservation and Recov
ery Act (RCRA) now requires
the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) to develop stan
dards and procedures that re
quire proper management of
hazardous wastes.
The new regulations require
all companies to file notification
of hazardous waste activity by
August 18.
