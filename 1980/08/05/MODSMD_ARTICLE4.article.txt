# Draft protest: mainly spirit
## 
### Rick Altman Staff Writer 
On a Saturday more approp
riate for sunbathing than protest
ing, the Mid-Peninsula Coalition
to Resist Registration and the
Draft planned a march that at
tracted more reporters and
police officers than participants.
Four people — none of them
eligible for the current registra
tion — showed up at the Menlo
Park Post Office to march to the
Palo Alto Post Office.

News Analysis

They ended up doing very lit
tle protesting and no marching.
But interestingly enough, they
did not seem to mind. This
after-the-fact demonstration
was not intended as a show of

power — more like a meeting of
the minds.
"People are just saying no to
the government," said James
Sayre, 38, a soft-spoken spiritual
leader of sorts. "Many of them
are not bothering to come out
here and say no, they're just ig
noring it altogether. They are
pretending the whole thing does
not exist."
"People just aren't into de
monstrating," offered 18-year
old Ben Davidson, who plans not
to register w hen he becomes elig
ible in January, "but it is still im
portant to keep the issue alive. I
think there is going to be a draft
soon; we need to keep alive the
spirit of resistance."
It is that "spirit" of resistance
that these rather relaxed protes
ters are nurturing, and they do it

in quite an unusual way — at
least in a passive way.
A lot of support
"The MPCRRD," says their
press release,"supports all forms
of resistance. We also fully sup
port those who are not prepared
to take the possible consequ
ences of civil 'disobedience'."
That suggests quite a different
tone than draft resistance
movements in the 19605. The
fact that only four people
showed up to march in protest
says something in itself.
But according to Sayre, draft
resistance has a silent majority.
" I'm telling people not only to
refuse to register, but to totally
ignore the whole thing. II every
body does, they (the govern
ment) ran't cntnrrc it 1 hev run' I
prosecute a million people. They
don't even have enough jail
space."
Different from '60s
In the '60s people were not
ignoring the issue, nor were they
so aware of the consequences of
disobeying. Stanford had the
broken windows to prove it.
Is this new style of draft resis
tance indicative of a new mood
across the country? Sayre says
not neccessarily. He believes the
"new consciousness" aroused by
draft resisters in the '60s is re
sponsible for today's women's
and gay movements.
But Sayre seems to be in the
minority in that respect. Most of
the people old enough to have
witnessed both draft eras see a
marked change in the country's
reaction.
'Tn the '605," remembered

one Menlo Park woman, "there
was an anger which created a vit
ality and an energy that went in
many directions — some of it was
constructive, some destructive.
People apathetic
"Now it's just kind of like,
'well, whatever happens will
happen.'
"It's definitely part of a gen
eral change in mood. I wonder
what the American people
would have done 10 years ago if
their only choice for President
was between Carter and Regan.
We're not doing much about it at
all.
" If I had a 20-year-old son de
ciding whether to register or not,
I would tell him that I will bake
him cakes and visit him often and
spend weekends with him while
he is in prison."
In an informal poll of parents,
onlv two out of more than 20 said

that they would insist that their
son register. More than half said
they would recommend to their
son that he not register.
Yet very few of those parents
had any interest in protesting or
having their sons protest — just
in not registering. Creating
havoc over the issue of the draft is
no longer popular with these pa
rents.
So it seems that Sayre's mes
sage is being heard — ignore re
gistration rather than make a big
deal about it. In light of that, it is
understandable — fitting even —
that only four people show up for
a march against registration.
In fact, when asked why he
even came, Sayre remarked with
the casual tone that put the en
tire morning in perspective:
" I had nothing better to do, so
I thought I'd come out to a draft
demonstration."
