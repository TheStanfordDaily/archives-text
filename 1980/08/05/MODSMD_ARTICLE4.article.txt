# Draft protest: mainly spirit
## 
### Rick Altman Staff Writer 
On a Saturday more approp
riate for sunbathing than protest
ing, the Mid-Peninsula Coalition
to Resist Registration and the
Draft planned a march that at

police officers than participants.
Four people — none of them
eligible for the current registra
tion — showed up at the Menlo
Park Post Office to march to the
Palo Alto Post Office.

They ended up doing very lit

But interestingly enough, they
did not seem to mind. This
after-the-fact demonstration
was not intended as a show of

power — more like a meeting of

think there is going to be a draft
soon; we need to keep alive the
spirit of resistance."

A lot of support
"The MPCRRD," says their
press release,"supports all forms
of resistance. We also fully sup

That suggests quite a different
tone than draft resistance
movements in the 19605. The
fact that only four people
showed up to march in protest
says something in itself.
But according to Sayre, draft
resistance has a silent majority.
" I'm telling people not only to
refuse to register, but to totally
ignore the whole thing. II every
