## Italians outraged 
### Clara Hemphill Associated Press Writer 
BOLOGNA. Italy (AP) â€”
Millions of Italians stopped work
and tens of thousands poured
into city squares yesterday in a
display of national outrage over
the "Bologna massacre." the kil
ling of K4 people in the railroad
station here by what authorities
say was a bomb.
Anti-terrorist police searched
apartments and houses of neo
fascist sympathizers in 20 cities
across Italy, looking tor clues in
their investigation of Saturday's
explosion, authorities reported.
Atter finding metal fragments
in the station rubble, inves
tigators had said Sunday they
were virtually certain the blast
was the result of a bomb.
Yesterday, responding to
questions in Parliament, Italian
Premier Francesco Cossiga said
one or more bombs caused the
blast, but he did not cite evi
dence.

Authorities said they believed
right-wing extremists planted
the bomb, since the blast bore
similarities to previous attacks
claimed by rightists. The explo
sion came almost six years to the
day after 1 2 passengers were kil
led in an Italian train bombing
for which right-wing terrorists
claimed responsibility.
Investigators were studying
reports that two youths left a
suitcase in the second-class wait
ing room of the Bologna station
minutes before the explosion.
They also were checking a theory
that terrorists took the 10:06
a.m. train to Florence after leav
ing the bomb in the station. The
explosion stopped clocks at
10:25 a.m.
The national labor federation
called a two-hour general strike
in protest of Saturday's explo
sion. and union officials reported
almost 100 percent of Italian
workers honored it. Factories
were silent, trains and buses
came to a halt.
