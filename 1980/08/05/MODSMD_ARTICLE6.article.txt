# European Common Market strong

### Don Cook The Los Angeles Times 
BRUSSELS. Belgium — The
European Common Market is
moving determinedly into a
more active phase of common
foreign policy, hut its greatest
asset is still its combined
economic strength and its do
minant trading position in the
world.
The gross product of the nine
Common Market countries is
about equal to the gross national
product of the United States —
around $2 trillion a year. But the
Common Market carries on al
most three times as much exter
nal trade as the United States.
Common Market exports are
more than $570 billion a year.

compared with less than $200
billion for the United States, and
its imports are more than $600
billion, compared with slightly
more than $200 billion for the
United States.
But it is in specific trade
sensitive areas of the world
where the Common Market re
ally dominates the trading pic
ture. It carries on more than four
times as much business with the
Communist bloc as the United
States does.
In the Third World, the gap is
not as wide hut it is significant.
The Arab world, tor example,
draws about 47 percent of its im
ports from the Common Market
and only 12 percent from the Un
ited States. It sells 37 percent of

its exports to Europe and 18 per
cent to the United States.
Europe does better by the
Third World than the United
States in terms of economic aid.
In 1979, European foreign aid
programs were about double the
American effort.
Fundamentally, there is no di
vision between the United States
and Europe on what The
Economist calls "the heart of the
matter," the security of Western
Europe. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's decision
to introduce a new generation of
nuclear weapons into Europe is
evidence of the solidarity on this
side of the problem.
