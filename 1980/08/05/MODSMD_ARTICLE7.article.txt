# Nigeria's oil transforms its fate
## 
### Leon Dash The Washington Post 
LAGOS, Nigeria — Nigeria is
discovering that oil riches can
mean a windfall of wealth hut
also a hail of woes.
The country's vast oil reserves
have held out great possibilities
for growth on a continent where
nation after nation has seen its
development efforts falter and
fail. Nigerian oil revenues this
year are expected to exceed $23
billion, more than double the
$9.4 billion the country earned
in 1978. Nigeria's oil wealth pro -
vides 90 percent of its export
earnings and 83 percent of gov
ernment revenues.
But with the boom have come
headaches.
A long-running "oilgate"
scandal, involving $5 billion in
oil revenues allegedly siphoned
out of Nigeria by oil companies,
has sparked harsh public criti
cism of the government-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp., Western oil companies,
and the military government that
held power for 13 years until last
October.
In mid-January, a Texaco
offshore oil rig blew out and spil
led thousands of tons of crude
along beaches and into the fresh
water estuaries of the Niger
River Delta, hurting subsistence
farmers and fishermen who lived
in the scattered villages along the
country's eastern coastline.

Government officials are also
concerned that efforts to tighten
controls on the oil companies
may discourage participation of
others and slow the country's
plans to capture its natural gas
and tap new oil reserves.
The "oilgate" controversy is
being seen in some quarters
here, however, as the event that
will give President Shehu
Shagari legitimacy to regulate
the activities of foreign oil firms.
Government planners are now
expecting that the aftermath of
the scandal will bring long
needed energy planning, reor
ganization of the state petroleum
company and tighter control of
production.
Government and oil sources
said the plans being discussed
now include incentives to new
outside oil companies for explo
ration and development of gas
reserves, and a larger voice for
Nigeria in the production and
marketing practices of the 10
existing companies that pump
the country's oil.
Nigeria's proven oil reserves
are estimated at 18 billion bar
rels, enough for the next 20 years
at present production rates. But
that estimate could be consider
ably lower than what actually
exists, according to oil sources.
New companies have been re
luctant to come in, a Western ob
server said, because last summer
Nigeria changed the terms on oil
exploration that had previously
granted a company 40 percent of
all the oil it found. Now, all oil
discovered belongs to Nigeria
and if the company finds none
"they're just out of luck" and
must absorb the costs of explora

tion, he added.
There are now 10 oil com
panies operating rigs in Nigeria
with Shell having the largest
share of production —a little less
than 60 percent. Gulf has 15 per
cent, Mobil and Phillips together
have 16 percent, the French
company ELF 5 percent, Texaco
3 percent and Ashland,Pan
Ocean and Tenneco together
about 1 percent.
Nigeria also has huge reserves
of natural gas and is presently
burning off 600 million cubic
feet of the gas each day in con
junction with its oil production.
Only 6 percent of the gas is cap
tured for domestic use.
The country's natural gas
company, Bonny LNG, has plans
to build a$ 10 billion natural gas
refinery and export system. In
February, Bonny signed letters
of intent with eight European
countries to supply S billion
cubic feet of liquefied natural gas
annually for 20 years beginning
in 1985.
An informed source said
Nigeria is seeking high prices be
cause the country will have to
borrow at commercial interest
rates the $10 billion to finance
construction of the refinery and
wants guaranteed markets at
contractual prices before com
mitting itself.
Concern for maintaining high
prices on crude oil last week
moved the government to cut
back its oil production by 10 per
cent. Long a proponent of higher
oil prices within the Organiza
tion of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Nigeria decided to cut
back in the face of a world oil glut
rather than bring down its prices.
