## Kennedy, Anderson cut Carter 
### Bill Stall The Los Angeles Times 
NEW YORK — Sen. Edward
Kennedy and Rep. John Ander
son criticized the Carter ad
ministration with almost equal
fervor yesterday for failing to
provide enough help for Ameri
ca's blacks. Both candidates said
that things would get even worse
for blacks.
Both Kennedy and Anderson
said that things would get espe
cially bad for blacks under an
administration oi Republican
Ronald Reagan.
Kennedy, the Massachusetts
Democrat challenging Carter at
next week's Democratic Na
tional Convention here and An
derson. an independent candi
date, addressed the Annual

Convention of the Urban
League.
Kennedy and Anderson, a
Republican member of Congress
from Illinois who mounted his
independent campaign after los
ing several GOP primaries, both
received enthusiastic responses
from the largely black audience.
But. in general, their reception
was more restrained than that
the two candidates received last
month at the NAACP conven
tion in Miami.
Reagan will address the con
ference today and Carter plans
to speak tomorrow.
Kennedy's and Anderson's
addresses contained marked
similarities on many points as
each decried the plight of blacks
in the areas of jobs, justice, civil

rights and the treatment of Hai
tian refugees.
Anderson, who followed
Kennedy, took note of the "ex
cellent remarks of the distin
guished speaker who went be
fore me" and skipped over part
of his text that provided a statis
tical litany of how poor blacks
are fairing in society today.
The list was similar to the one
that Kennedy already had re
cited moments before.
Each speaker reviewed his
own civil rights credentials be
fore the 2500 delegates, consi
dered to be representative of
millions of black votes at stake in
the November election.
Kennedy said, "1 am proud
that I have never cast a vote that
was wrong on civil rights."
