# Kennedy debuts on 'Campus Conference'

The University's new presi
dent, Donald Kennedy, is going
to leave things in the administra
tion pretty much as he found
them â€” at least for the moment.
In general, Kennedy is pleased
with the administration as it
stands.
"I think that the present ad
ministration is a very strong ad
ministration, and I don't have
any plans to change things,"
Kennedy said.
Kennedy, who took office Au
gust 1, succeeding Dr. Richard
Lyman (now president of the
Rockefeller Foundation), made
his comments on a special edi
tion of Campus Conference
Tuesday night. Speaking with
reporters from KZSU and the
Daily, Kennedy answered ques
tions on subjects ranging from
draft registration to his support
of the griffin for University mas
cot.

Kennedy, soon to be 49, said
he had been at Stanford for 20
years, with a brief time-out to
head the Food and Drug Ad
ministration in Washington, and
"doesn't expect to end up any
place else," once he leaves the
president's office.
He also said his political
philosophies are not all that diffe

rent from those of former Presi
dent Lyman.
With regard to registration of
19- and 20-year olds for the
military draft, Kennedy declined
to outline any formal administra
tion policy beyond that of "mak
ing an effort to supply students
with as accurate information as
possible about their obligations
under registration."
Kennedy said "it's important
to keep separate the issue of'is a
draft O.K.' and the question 'for
what war?"
Based on his discussions with
students, Kennedy said he un
derstood "there would be pretty
widespread opposition to a draft
installed for the particular pur
pose of securing energy re
sources abroad."
But, he added: "Whether that
distaste would extend to drafts
installed for very different pur
poses at other times, I'm not
sure."
Among the areas where Ken

nedy intends to use some of his
influence is in encouraging de
velopment of Stanford's tradi
tionally less-strong humanities
program.
Kennedy, who helped found
the inter-disciplinary Human
Biology Program here, said al
though Stanford has made "very
impressive gains" in the
humanities, particularly in the
last 10 years, these efforts have
been hampered both by lack of
library resources and a provin
cialism that causes studies in the
humanities to gravitate to the
eastern states.
Until recently, according to
Kennedy, library resources at
Stanford "were not sufficient to
fuel a major effort in the
humanities." However, the
opening of Green Library last
spring, he added, has "repaired"
that problem.
Kennedy also plans to encour
age the establishment of a center
at which people from the

humanities departments could
interact, perhaps also bringing in
people from outside.
On a happy note, Kennedy
said that, contrary to his own
predictions, federal funding for
research is up at Stanford, while
it is down at many other institu
tions.
" I was convinced that we were
already into a definite turndown
in federal research funding
Kennedy said, "hut funding (this
year) is up and up significantly."
Kennedy credited the upturn
to the proficiency of faculty at
securing funds for their research
projects out of federal coffers
and hoped they could keep up
their"rope tricks." However, he
conceded that in the long-run
federal funding may yet go
down.
The University, therefore,
must continue to get more fund
ing from corporations and the
private sector, Kennedy
explained.
