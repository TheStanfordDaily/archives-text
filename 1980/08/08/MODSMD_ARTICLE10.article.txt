## Hold open convention 
### 
The Democratic National Convention opens in just three short
davs, and from the looks ot it.it appears Ronald Reagan could
have written the script. Saddled with an incumbent president with
the lowest rating in the historv of the polls and a simmering
scandal that alternates between comedy and corruption, the
Democratic Party is disjointed and contused, unsure whether it
should focus its wrath on itself or its Republican challengers.
But we are not convinced that such seeming "weaknesses" are
necessarily bad for Jimmy Carter, the Democratic Party, or the
United States. The Daily supports the growing calls for an open
convention in the hopes that this will provide an opportunity for
the long-awaited debate on the president's record and give the
Democrats the best chance for choosing a candidate well equip
ped to defeat Ronald Reagan in the tall.
We are aware, however, that an open convention is not without
its dangers and its critics. After all. voters in primary states across
the nation overwhelmingly chose delegates pledged to elect
Jimmv Carter as the Democratic nominee. Would it be fair to
release those delegates from their pledges and allow them to
perhaps turn their backs on the mandate of the v titers? Such is the
argument of the Carter backers.
One must remember that the rule binding delegates to their
candidates has never been one close to the moral fiber of Ameri
can politics. In 1472. Carter opposed this same rule to help
George McGovern win the nomination. Two years ago, before his
poor show ings in the primaries. Senator Edward Kennedy favored
it.
One must also remember that the way we choose our presiden
tial candidates is still evolving from conventions of smoke-filled
rooms to direct popular participation. But as the New York Times
stated in its July 31 editorial, the emerging system is as of yet
incomplete.
We have no reason to believe that the existing system is the best
method of choosing our president. In fact, we have many indica
tions that it is not It would be a travesty to cling to this questiona
ble rule in the face of declining polls and rising unemployment
indicators, especially considering America's long tradition of
checks and balances on the exercise of political power.
We believe it is quite fair for the delegates to the Democratic
convention to use their judgment and to act as a check on the
primary and caucus processes.
There is always the danger that a nationally televised display of
disunity would so weaken the Democratic nominee that he would,
no matter who he was. be totally helpless against Reagan in the
tail. But if party unity means that wise and knowledgeable men
like Jerry Ford and Henry Kissinger swallow their pride and utter
platitudes to a cheering throng, then perhaps the Democrats and
the country would be better off without it for now.
An open convention would give Democrats from all sides of the
party the opportunity to question the record that was hidden in the
Rose Garden for so much of the primary campaign, and give men
such as Ted Kennedy. Walter Mondale, Henry Jackson. Edmund
Muskie. and yes. Jimmy Carter, a chance to debate the course
their party and the nation should take.
Only in this way. we believe, will Democrats have the best
chance to achieve the one thing they all agree on — protecting
America from the policies of a President Reagan.
