## Disarmament, not proliferation 
### 
In my column of July 11,1 ar
gued that because our present
nuclear defense policy is highly
unethical and dangerous, we
must pursue a program of disar
mament.
I suggested that it would be
most effective ii we were to begin
to disarm unilaterally, in the
hopes that multilateral disar
mament would follow. I did not
intend to suggest that we should
fully disarm without requiring a
similar response by the Russians.
1 think it is clear, however, that
the extremely slow 5.A.1..T.
process is an ineffective means to
stop the madness of arms prolif
eration We need to move fast if
we are to save the world, and I

see no reason why we should not
move first.
Certainly, there is no guaran
tee that the Soviets will at any
time in the future alter their ex
pansionist military philosophy.
However, this does not preclude
our setting an example for the
rest of the world by altering our
military philosophy.
Consider the present situa
tion. We now have around 9000
nuclear warheads pointing at the
Soviet Union. And they have
about 6000 pointing at us. We
are set up to launch from land
underground silos, from flying
bomber squadrons and from un
dersea submarines.
By 1985, one Trident sub

marine will be equipped with 24
Trident-2 missiles capable of
striking any point on over half
the earth's surface. Each of these
Trident-2 missiles will be able to
deliver 17 super-accurate
M.I.R.V. (Multiple independent
reentry vehicle) warheads to
within a few feet of as many
targets.
And with about 100 kilotons
payload per warhead, this one
submarine will be able to destroy
up to 408 Soviet cities with a
blast five times as powerful as
that which leveled Hiroshima.
President Jimmy Carter is
predicting a national defense
budget of $ 143 billion for the fis
cal year 1981. The U ,S. Office of
Management and Budget has
predicted that this will rise to
over $205 billion for fiscal 1983.
Carter wants to push ahead
with the M.X. and cruise mis
siles. and is again considering the
B-l Bomber. Neutron bombs
are being made and stored.
The direction in which we are
heading is clearly one of inevita
ble doom. It makes great sense
for us to choose now as the time
to stop the madness.
We can easily afford to dis
pense with some of our nuclear
stockpile without in any way
hampering our presently much
too powerful nuclear defense.
Let's be smart and make the
first move in disarmament. It can
only be to our, as well as to the
world's, advantage.
