# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Barbara Honegger Stanford's private status threatened 
### 
In 1972 Professor Bruce
Franklin, a tenured faculty
member of the Department of
English at Stanford University,
was fired by the University for
allegedly "inciting others to vio
lence." Franklin went to court,
and the case was returned to
Stanford's Advisory Board for a
penalty review. The Advisory
Board has just determined that
Franklin should still have been
fired for allegedly overstepping
his free-speech rights two in
stead of three times.
There is a Franklin case you
probably don't know about be
cause it's not in the interest of
either side for you to know. This
article is about the real Franklin

case — the one behind the scenes
and between the lines— that will
return to haunt us until it is fi
nally decided by the Supreme
Court of the United States,
probably sometime in the next
six years.
Until his case reached the at
torneys, Franklin didn't have any
free speech rights at Stanford. In
fact, like every other faculty,
staff and student member of this
institution, he didn't have any
constitutional rights at all.
That is because Stanford Uni
versity is still formally treated as
if it were a private institution,
like a family or a neighborhood
church; and the Constitution of
the United States applies only to
public institutions.
Stanford University let the
Constitution, including its free
speech rights, apply in Franklin's
case. In legal language, Stanford
stipulated, before the case even
began, that the Constitution
would apply.
So, technically and legally,
Stanford could have done any
thing it wanted to Franklin, but
instead its attorneys agreed that
his case would be argued in the
courts as if the Constitution were
applicable to all his speech and
actions on campus.
Stanford stipulated that the
Constitution would apply in
Franklin's case because if it
hadn't, you can bet your life
Franklin's attorneys would have
argued that the Constitution
applied in any case because Stan
ford, due to the fact that it re
ceives millions upon millions of
taxpayers' dollars, is really a pub
lic institution.
That is, Stanford's alternative
to giving Franklin the grounds
for his case was to face a crucial
and precedent-setting test of its
status as a constitutionally
exempt private institution, a test
upon which its very survival as a
major institution of higher learn
ing would depend.
Personally, I laud Stanford
University for its actions in the
Franklin case, despite the fact
they were probably taken for
selfish reasons. By so doing, it
has put off the crucial legal test
for a few more years and pro
tected all of us from a far worse

fate.
However, Stanford is not
without blame for what has hap
pened. Government doesn't
come into a vacuum. It has to
have an excuse for redefining
traditionally private domains as
public. Historically, government
has justified its extension into
areas where private parties and
institutions clearly have abused
their privileges.
Over the years, and especially
during the late administration of
Richard Lyman, Stanford has
penalized its faculty for a
number of evident wrongs in a
politically-motivated and arbit
rary way.
During Lyman's administra
tion, the University fired Dr.
Franklin for allegedly inciting
others to violence while merely
fining two other professors for
actually committing violence
against a staff person and two
students, respectively.
It is this kind of arbitrary ac
tion which rightly tempts agg
rieved faculty, staff and students
to question Stanford's right to
make its own decisions about
penalties and equally tempts the
government to step in and make
some sense of crime and
punishment on campus.
Stanford would not be in the
situation it is today vis-a-vis the
Franklin case if it had done years
ago what it must do now before
its private status is questioned
successfully by the next court
case that comes along.
That is to figure out some way
to function as a great graduate
and undergraduate institution
without accepting public funds.
Already, it has gone part of the
way towards realizing this goal.
Under Lyman's administration,
Stanford greatly increased its
private sources of support, and
the Medical School recently re
jected a large government grant
instead of accepting the strings
attached to public funding.
This must be done, and there is
no better time than the present
to begin, under a new University
president.
