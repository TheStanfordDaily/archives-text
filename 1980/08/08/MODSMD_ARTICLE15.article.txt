### The White Album Joan Didion Pocket Books 221 pp. $2. 75 
Reading any of Joan Didion's
work always gives me the unmis
takeable sense that I am reading
about Didion herself—she is
forever suspended between the
reader and her subject, simul
taneously being inspector and in
spected. Yet she acts not as a
barrier but rather as the eye of
the microscope through which
we are peering, the slide on
which the specimen is placed.
In The White Album, Didion
reflects on the '60s, but she is
writing both about the period
and about herself as a reporter in
that period. She was there to ob
serve and record events and con
versations, to listen to the sounds
of the tumult.
And yet Didion is anything but
a typical reporter — her per
petual self-consciousness leaves
no room for attempts at objectiv
ity. Says Didion, "writing is the
act of saying 'I, I, I,' of imposing
oneself upon other people — of
saying 'listen to me, see it my
way, change your mind. 1 "
The White Album is a collec
tion of essays, a number of which
are concerned with evaluating
the decade of the '60s. Didion,
however, is not trying to tell us
what it meant but rather what it
didn't mean. While Slouching

Towards Bethlehem portrayed
the bleakness and pathos of the
Haight-Ashbury flower child
generation, The White Album
poses a difficult question: Did
the decade that seemed to cause
such social upheaval simply van
ish without a trace?
Didion is repeatedly struck by
the lack of evidence that the '60s
had any effect on society; at
times, she finds it hard to believe
that the '60s ever happed. At a
Jaycees meeting in early 1970,
she feels as though she is in a
time warp, finding people de
termined to "meet 1950 head
on."
Didion is careful to refrain
from being contemptuous or dis
dainful — she appears simply to
have had an acute sense of what
was happening even at the time.
When visiting the so-called
"Battlefield" at San Francisco
State, Didion felt as though she
were witnessing a mockery —
almost a betrayal — of the
movement, "an instance of the
enfants terribles and the Board of
Trustees unconsciously col
laborating on a wishful fantasy
(Revolution on Campus) and
playing it out in time for the six
o'clock news."
Although her criticism of
empty rhetoric and self-delusion
is well-aimed, she seems to con
tradict herself when she addres
