movement. Suddenly she is con
descending and accusatory, chid
ing them for getting "stalled in
the personal," and sounding a bit
like a literary version of Phyllis
Schlafley.
It is as though Didion is so dis
tanced from this particular sub
ject that her critical powers lose
their accuracy. She is at her best
when she is up close, and espe
cially when her passion is free to
express reverance, as in her piece
on Georgia O'Keefe. 1 lere. Did
ion is unabashed in her admira
tion for O'Keefe's reflection of
character in her style, since it so
obviously describes Didion's
own self-expression. "Every
word chosen or rejected, every
brush stroke laid or not laid
down betrayed one's character."
Her essays about water, and
about Hoover Dam in particular,
are intimate reflections of her
obsession with control. Con
stantly troubled by feelings that
she is living her life by improvisa
tion, and unable to fit things into
the "narrative," Didion has an
overwhelming love for seeing
water under control.
Her vision of the dam in its
place in eternity is one of the
most moving passages in the
book: "... a dynamo finally free

of man, splendid at last in its ab
solute isolation, transmitting
power and releasing water to a
world where no one is."
In many ways, Didion is still
struggling with old issues, still
"trying to come to terms with
disorder," just as she was in
Slouching Towards Bethlehem.
" 1 want you to know, as you read
me, precisely who I am and
where I am and what is on my
mind," writes Didion in one es
say, but we know only that Did
ion is not sure of the who, the
what or even the where.
She confesses her distorted
view of the world, her being
"alert only to the stuff of bad
dreams." Indeed, the bad
dreams are what Didion under
stands so exceptionally well; her
remarkable ability to perceive
things the way others do not —
remembering that "no one was
surprised" the day of the Sharon

Tate Polanski murders — makes
her reflection on the '60s un
iquely powerful.
And still she is forever mindful
of the umbilical cord that both
binds her and keeps her apart: " 1
could lay off my own state of pro
found emotional shock on the
larger cultural breakdown, could
talk fast about convulsions in the
society and alientation and
anomie . . . but... 1 am not soci
ety in microcosm."
She does talk about all of those
things and all the while remains
relentlessly personal, trying as a
writer to achieve that balance be
tween the personal and the gen
eral that she feels the movements
of the '60s failed to achieve. And
there she is, so close to the glass
of the microscope that she is both
pressed flat against the outside
and at times just inside, but al
ways translucent against the
view. —LIZ ROSNER
