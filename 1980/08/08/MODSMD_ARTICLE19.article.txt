## 'Early Californian fare' Unique food offered 
### THE IRON WORKS 3877 El Camino Real Palo Alto 493-3433 
When going out to eat, the
choice of restaurant often begins
with type of food — will it be
steak, pizza. Mexican. Chinese?
What about early Californian?
What is early Californian? The
Iron Works advertises as "early
Californian fare," and it was with
curiosity that we approached a
recent evening there.
Next door to Jack-in-the-Box,
only a small white building is vis
ible from the street. A long
greenery covered passage,
though, leads one invitingly back
to a large two-leveled garden
terrace. This terrace, the man
ager later told us, is partly glass
topped for comfort, but the open
beam roof gave a cheery outdoor
feeling to theplace—the way you
might want to feel on your own
home patio. There is also an in
side seating area, with a similar
rough-hewn construction, but
dark and den-like.
We were seated in the higher
outdoor level. One small com
plaint: the lawn chairs used are
comfortable, but a bit too low for
short people, myself at 5'3". The
awkward feeling was slight, and
though I soon forgot about it,
shorter folk might be discom
forted.
A drink list is on the outside of
the menu, offering a good variety

of interesting drinks, including
Margaritas by the pitcher. Elect
ing more mdoerate openers, we
ordered a Strawberry Margarita
($2.25) and a Ramos Fizz
($2.50). Both were well made
and brought promptly by our
young, quite friendly waiter.
The menu is subdivided into
several sections, with the Moun
tains, the Prairie and the Sea on
one side; Early Early Californian
on the other. Roughly translated
these refer to meat and seafood
and Mexican style food.
There is, however, more to the
Iron Works. A closer look at the
menu shows that most of the dis
hes, particularly the meats and
seafood, have some special, even
unusual method of preparation.
My friend chose the Pancho Veal
($9.25). (There is clearly a puns
ter around in the marketing de
partment).
From the Early Early side 1
chose the Crab Enchilada Espe
cial ($8.25). Other selections
ranged from Chile Rellenos,
Tostadas and the like, to such
creations as Miners Bones, large
meaty beef bones glazed with
brandy and honey, or Shrimp
Manzanillo, shrimp in a wine,
butter and garlic sauce.
Prices for these and other en
trees fell roughly between $6.50
and $11, with the Early Early
Californian ones generally at the
lower end of the scale. These
prices may seem high, but they

all do include full dinners.
And they are very full dinners
at that. After talking with our
waiter we had decided on a
pitcher of Sangria ($5.50), and
this dark, delicious and potent
liquid arrived with our first
course of Sopaipillas. These last
are triangles of deep-friend
bread, which the menu told us
were originated by the Spaniards
and the Pueblo Indians. They
were slightly sweet and very
good. French bread is an alterna
tive option, but I would un
hesitatingly recommend trying
the Sopaipillas.
Dinners also come with
homemade soup, or a tossed
green or spinach salad. The soup.

a hearty bean,was distinctive and
savory. The green salad, lettuce
with garbanzo and kidney beans,
was certainly adequate though
not special.
The veal was served attrac
tively «/Mh rice and bright green
sauteed zucchini, and the crab
enchiladas looked like some
thing out of a travel magazine
red, orange and gold topped with
the green and white of
guacamole and sour cream. They
were served with refried beans
with cheese and amazingly pink
rice. This rice at first seemed a bit
much, though after the initial
surprise it blended rather nicely
into the general color scheme.

Moreover, care had obviously
been taken with the taste of the
food as well. This wasn't low
grade, costumed fare by any
means. The two enchiladas were
filled with a large amount of
sweet crabmeat, and the sauce
was exceptionally well
seasoned. Though I tend to reach
for tabasco almost as a matter of
course, I had no need to here.
The beans and rice, particularly
the former, were steps above the
bland TV-dinner tasting var
ieties so often served as Mexican
side dishes.
The veal turned out to be a
nice piece of high-quality meat,
in a strong Spanish-tasting sauce.
Onion and pepper flavors pre
dominated. I very much liked it,
but those of you who like your
meat "straight" might do better
to try something else. The fresh
zucchini, though, which was
cooked with butter and pepper,
would probably please all pa
lates.
We would have liked to try the
Flan ($1.50) for dessert, but they
were out of it, so we settled for
the Mexican chocolate pudding
($1.75) instead. It was rich, tast
ing strongly of chocolate and
cinnamon. Unique and worth
trying if you like those two
flavors. A note to all fellow caf
feine addicts — the coffee is ex
cellent.
