A visiting Chinese physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), Dr. Gao
Chong-shou, 47, suffered seri
ous head injuries following a
bicycle accident last Thursday.
Gao was found lying by his
bicycle just past the SLAC
gatehouse near Sand Hill Road
at about 8:45 p.m.
According to Douglas Dupen,
director of personnel at SLAC,
the accident may have been
caused by a big bicycle chain
which was found wedged bet
ween the gears and spokes of the
wheel. As the bicycle came to a
sudden stop, Gao was hurled
through the air.
Witnesses reported the acci
dent immediately, and Gao was
taken to Stanford Hospital
where he was treated for a frac
tured skull and a blood clot lo
cated beneath the skull. He un
derwent surgery Friday after
noon to relieve pressure on the
brain.
Dr. Gerald Silverberg per
formed the craniotomy. A de
puty from the Chinese Consulate
in San Francisco arrived at the
hospital Friday morning, and
was in attendance throughout
the two-hour operation.
Silverberg said Wednesday
that Gao was awake and alert but
will remain at the hospital for
another week or two. He added
that there was still "significant
weakness" in the right side of
Gao's body, but that normal
function is returning "slowly."
Gao has been a visiting scien
tist at SLAC for about a year. He
is a theoretical physicist working
in elementary particle physics.
Gao was scheduled to return
to his home in Peking at the end
of August, but administrators at
SLAC requested an extension
for another year prior to the ac
cident.
