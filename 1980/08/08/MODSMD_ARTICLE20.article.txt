## movies /bruce handy A 						look at two 'comedies' of the 1980s 
### 
The Park Theatre — in the
Mid-Peninsula Urb-Ouadrant
— is offering an historic double
feature, a chance to see just what
it was that made people laugh in
the early days of the 1980s. For
only $4 the curious celluloid
timetraveller can, in one sitting,
view both Caddyshack and
Cheech and Chong's Next Movie,
two unabashedly obnoxious
examples of the "screwingbal
ling" school of comedy that was
so popular in the beginning of
that decade.
Certainly the economic cli
mate of the times had much to do
with the sorts of movies that
were produced at the time, and
the fact that the country had
begun its slide into The Even
Worse Great Depression, is re
flected in the decline from that
Golden Era of cinematic comedy
that was represented by the
mid-6l)s work of Jerry Lewis and
Don Knotts; many are the
echoes of Hook, Line and Sinker
in the various twitches and gurg
les of Caddyshack. And of
course the decade's politics had
an equal, if not greater impact on

its film. Not even the incompe
tency of then-President Carter,
which has been well documented
as a source of inspiration for the
young filmmakers who came of
age in the early '80s, can com
pare to the influence of Billy
Carter's manic brand of buf
foonery which is readily appa
rent in the two films under dis
cussion.
But perhaps the one event that
did more than any other to shape
The Aluminum Age of Comedy
was the Excretory Revolution of
the '80s. Like the earlier Sexual
Revolution, the Excretory Re
volution allowed artists a greater
freedom in the choice of subjects
as all the sundry outputs of the
human body became grist for
Hollywood's laugh mills. Not
only had on-camera flatulence
become permissible and ever de
sirable, but even full-frontal turd
shots became mandatory for
both artistic and box-office suc
cess.
Masturbation had been known
to filmmakers for sometime,
especially European directors

such as Fellinni, who figured
strongly in the Silver Age of
Pubescent Boy Movies with his
Amarcord; but only beginning
with the films of the "Post-Scat"
auteursdid masturbation, and all
its related testicular quips, get
truly out of hand and onto the big
screen, as both the character of
Mitch Kumstein in Caddyshack
and Cheech and Chong's Next
Movie's now-famous teddybear
scene will attest.
These two films are veritable
documents of the trouble the
Hollywood of the '80s had in
finding suitable stars for its films.
Anyone who had had any
amount of popularity in even the
most obscure medium was al
lowed to make the transition to
big screens and bigger budgets.
Caddyshack is particularly
noteworthy in this respect as
three television comedians
(Chevy Chase, Bill Murray and
Ted Knight) and one Borscht-
Belt comedian (Rodney Danger
field) were allowed to do their
various routines, or "things" in
the parlance of the times, with

little regard for the cinematic
whole. Ted Knight's perfor
mance also serves as a reminder
of both the way in which quality
television writing can elevate an
actor to star status only to let him
plummet back down to the
depths of a mugging, gurgling
performance in the absence of a
truly witty script.
Cheech and Chong were simi
larly allowed to flounder in their
own movie, transforming the au
rally simplistic style of their re
cordings into an aurally crude
motion picture; one is never re
ally sure whether the soundtrack
quality has decayed that much.

or if the dialogue does indeed
consist exclusively of the words
"man" and "shit."
There is a pleasant nostalgic
quality though to Cheech and
Chong's Next Movie, though. It
recreates those happy simple
years when people either
smoked marijuana or didn't. But
for the modern audience Cud
dyshack will probably be more
enjoyable, as Cheech and
Chong's Next Movie has rela
tively intolerable high levels of
cleverness, energy and style that
today's film goers may find both
old fashioned and perhaps even
appalling.
