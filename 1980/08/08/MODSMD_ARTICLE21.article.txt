## Irreverance lives in 'Todd' 
### 
Critic Brendan Gill once cal
led Sweeney Todd "a single pro
longed sick joke." As such, it is
hard to understand how it won
Tony awards for Best Book, Best
Score, Best Scenic Design, Best
Costumes, Best Actor, Best Ac
tress, Best Musical, Best Direc
tor, etc. etc. (I think they failed
only in the Best Ticket Format
category.) The premise is incred
ibly silly — a revenge-crazed
barber returns from an unjust
deportment in Australia and
starts slashing up people around
the clock while his downstairs
neighbor and mistress converts
them into stew — but if you ac
cept weirdness and the macabre
as reasons enough in themselves,
then Sweeney Todd the Barber is
good entertainment.
Sweeney Todd the Stylist (Au
gust 6-9 and 13-16) is probably
better. With a sure gift for
exaggeration and camp, Stan

ford Summer Theatre has taken
this frequently reworked melod
rama and amped it right out of
the Broadway League forever.
Bob Egan's production is
"futuristic," tongue-in-cheek
and generally quite deft.
Program notes explain that
this is a "vision of the future
world and a warning of its poten
tial structure." The notes also
enjoin us to enjoy ourselves.
Why not? — this adaptation (not
based on the same text as the
famous New York production) is
as loopy as they come. Gong
Show meets Brecht. There's an
anarchistic charm — best expres
sed in Todd Salovey's and Scott
Williams song and dance num
bers — about this off-hand pro
duction that is hard to resist. Its
futuristic framework derives
more from the "Star Trek" sen
sibility than anything else. Simi
larly, the music brings to mind

terms like "punk opera" (not
one of the cast can sing a note,
but it's not really necessary —
the original music has enough
beat and the lyrics are funny
enough to excuse or support the
. . . uh . . . noise.) The costumes
