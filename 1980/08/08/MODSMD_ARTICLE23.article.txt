Alien ★ ★★
Laurel, San Carlos
Ridley Scott directed this night
marish science-fiction movie about a
crew of a spacecraft menaced by a cre
ature that hungers for human flesh.
Alien is essentially a bug-eyed mons
ter movie from the '50s revamped
with '70s technology, and it is as emo
tionally limited as its predecessors.
Under Scott's atmospheric, quirky di
rection, however, Alien has a punch
and wit to it that hits even the most
skeptical viewer right between the
eyes. Alien is the best thriller we've
had since Jaws.
The seven-member (at the begin
ning, anyway) cast includes Tom Sker
ritt, Sigourney Weaver (a bit of trivia:
Weaver graduated from Stanford) and
Veronica Cartwright (still more trivia:
Cartwright is the grown-up version of
the little girl in The Birds). Plays to
night only.

Five Easy Pieces if if if it
Fox, Redwood City
Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces
explores an American Dream as it fol
lows an oil-rigger, Jack Nicholson, in a
search for something new, different,
better. Nicholson, the black sheep of
his upper-class, artistic family, lives
with Rayette, his pregnant white-trash
girlfriend (played endearingly by
Karen Black). As Nicholson confronts his
elite background, Rafelson pinpoints
the clash between American values
and American ideals. Rafelson bril
liantly creates characters that are both
unusual and vivid. His talent is espe
cially keen when focused upon the Ale
tails of personal relationships. Sensi
tive and thought-provoking, this film
is well worth your buck. Plays tonight
and tomorrow night.
—Leslie Bixel
King of Hearts if if if if
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This enormously popular anti-war
valentine is probably over-rated: it
gets a little too wrapped up in the
wonder of its own whimsy for comfort.
But this is a fantasy that's hard to re
sist: in the end, those who are simple
and kind triumph over those who are
clever and wicked.
Alan Bates stars as the WW 1 sol
dier who enters a French village where
the only inhabitants are the residents'
of the town insane asylum . He falls in
love with the completely looney and
very charming Genevieve Bujold. and
they live crazily ever after. Philippe
Deßroca directed. Plays through
Monday.
—J.M.
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest
Fox. Redwood City if if if if
Ken Kescy may not like it, but this
movie is one of the most consistently
challenging interpretations of a com
plex novel ever filmed. Director Milos
Forman goes all the way with the
McMurphy/Nurse Ratched battling
and, aided immeasurably by incredi
ble performances from Jack Nichol
son and I.ouise Fletchcr, gets insights
that Kesey, in the novel, didn't come
up with. Fletcher's characterization of
a woman consumed by ice and Nichol
son's portrayal of a sane man with a
crazy fire burning within him power
this most basic and kinetic of conflicts.
Plays tonight and tomorrow.

Airplane'A
Menlo, IVfenlo Park
From most of the people who
brought you Kentucky Fried Movie
comes this disappointing and largely
unfunny parody of disaster films.
There are about a million and a half
jokes in this one — unfortunately,
only about eight or nine of them are
funny. Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul
Jabbar and a whole host of non
comedians arc the non-stars
—Peter Finch
My Brilliant Careti if M
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Based on a turn-of-the-century
novel, written by an Australian
woman and published under a male pen
name in Scotland, My Brilliant Career
suffers from its own good intentions.
Sybella Melvyn, a young woman with
literary ambitions, must choose bet
ween a rich husband and life on a
rather squalid sheep ranch. Her even
tual decision is dictated by nothing less
than service to art; but this is not con
veyed on-screen, and the film, which
tries very hard not to be "feminist,"
ends up being unconvincing. Starts
next Thursday.
—Mike Hale
The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Palo Alto
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned all
alone in a tropical paradise, they take
years to figure out the finer points that
six-year-olds in t!.e audience grasp
immediately. Director Randal Kleiser
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't enacting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fishes) they're being
threatened by natives straight out of a
'40s jungle movie. A movie for dul
lards and child molesters.
—J.M
The Empire Strikes Back if if
Northpoint, San Francisco
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything's become
deadly serious — bigger,splashier, but
dull. All of the old performers are
back, but the best performance is
given by a green-skinned Muppet cre
ature who, for a moment, manages to
instill a sense of magic and expecta
tion. The movie's ending is the biggest
letdown of all — jeepers, George,
couldn't you come up with something
better than that after three years of
work?
—J.M
The Blues Brothers Movie if if if
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruction
(which admittedly isn't easy), you will
find a funny, well-conceived movie.
John I.andis (director, Animal House)
directs and co-wrote the script with
Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of good
music and entertaining dancing, but
possibly the most enjoyable part is just
watching Aykroyd and John Belushi
(Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues) do
their stuff.
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.

Harold and Maude ★ ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alio
Harold is a young man whose hob
bies are attending funerals and com
mitting suicide. Maude is an old
woman who believes in free love and
in the inherent goodness of humanity
It's clear from the beginning that the
two are destined to fall in love. Hal
Ashby (Being There, Coming Home)
directed this invigorating cult comedy.
The two principals are played by Bud
Cort and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens enliven the soundtrack. Plays
through Monday.

Wife mistress ★ ★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This film's premise is interesting
enough. A wealthy man, in hiding in
order to escape a murder charge,
watches in amazement as his previ
ously passive wife blooms as an ad
ministrator and a person after she
takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's a good one, the
execution is not. (A for effort, C minus
for achievement.) Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor per
formances as the rich man, the movie's
pacing is mangy, and the photography
is all soft-focus and oozy. Even these
might be bearable were it not for the
film's hysterically overblown score:
great waves of mood music waft across
the movie like Henry Mancini run
amuck. Plays Tuesday and Wednesday,
day.

Sunday, Memorial Auditorium
007 travels the globe to battle yet
another threat to world peace. I love
the Sean Connery James Bond
movies, but here, in his final Bond
outing, Connery is less than enthusias
tic — even his grins look pained. The
movie does bounce along well enough,
and the Las Vegas sequences, in par
ticular, have more than enough flash
to get by. With Jill St. John as the
"Bond Woman" — the ultimate sexist
cliche.

Dressed to hill
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The authors of a number of reviews
of Dressed to Kill have claimed that
they don't take issue with director
Brian De Palm's "emulation" of
Hitchcock. But that is the issue: De
Palma has gone beyond mere emula
tion into cinematic felony. De Palma
steals Hitchcock's plots (this isn't the
first time — Sisters, like DTK, was a
remake of Psycho; Obsession was a
shot-by-shot rehash of Vertigo) with
out taking over the auteur's underly
ing moral tensions. The result is a brit
tle, empty thriller worn down to no
thing by its own stylistic conceits.De
Palma's is parasitic moviemaking of
the highest order,

Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's
wonderful science-fantasy, has been rereleased in a "special
edition" that's even better than before. Spielberg recut his 1977
film, removing cumbersome sections and adding new footage.
The most lengthy sequence to be trimmed shows the Richard
Dreyfuss character building a replica of Devil's tower in his
living room; it's about half the length it was before. There's
more to the film's ending, now, but the two most striking
additions are one scene and a single shot. In the new scene,
Dreyfuss explains how he grew up with Disney 'sPinocchio, and
we begin to get a sense of the film's narrative roots. The new
shot, very brief and telling, shows the great shadow of a
spacecraft wedding the fantastic and the commonplace as it
glides over Indiana farmland. A magical movie. Playing at the
Old Mill, Mountain View.

Five Easy Pieces if if if it
Fox, Redwood City
Bob Rafelson's Five Easy Pieces
explores an American Dream as it fol
lows an oil-rigger, Jack Nicholson, in a
search for something new, different,
better. Nicholson, the black sheep of
his upper-class, artistic family, lives
with Rayette, his pregnant white-trash
girlfriend (played endearingly by
Karen Black). As Nicholson confronts his
elite background, Rafelson pinpoints
the clash between American values
and American ideals. Rafelson bril
liantly creates characters that are both
unusual and vivid. His talent is espe
cially keen when focused upon the Ale
tails of personal relationships. Sensi

is well worth your buck. Plays tonight

McMurphy/Nurse Ratched battling

Sybella Melvyn, a young woman with
literary ambitions, must choose bet

Though the idea's a good one, the

Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's
wonderful science-fantasy, has been rereleased in a "special
edition" that's even better than before. Spielberg recut his 1977
film, removing cumbersome sections and adding new footage.
The most lengthy sequence to be trimmed shows the Richard
Dreyfuss character building a replica of Devil's tower in his
living room; it's about half the length it was before. There's
more to the film's ending, now, but the two most striking
additions are one scene and a single shot. In the new scene,
Dreyfuss explains how he grew up with Disney 'sPinocchio, and
we begin to get a sense of the film's narrative roots. The new
shot, very brief and telling, shows the great shadow of a
spacecraft wedding the fantastic and the commonplace as it
glides over Indiana farmland. A magical movie. Playing at the

McMurphy/Nurse Ratched battling

Sybella Melvyn, a young woman with

This film's premise is interesting

order to escape a murder charge,
watches in amazement as his previ

takes on her husband's duties.
Though the idea's a good one, the
execution is not. (A for effort, C minus
for achievement.) Marcello Mas
troianni gives one of his rare poor per
formances as the rich man, the movie's
pacing is mangy, and the photography
is all soft-focus and oozy. Even these

Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Steven Spielberg's
wonderful science-fantasy, has been rereleased in a "special
edition" that's even better than before. Spielberg recut his 1977
film, removing cumbersome sections and adding new footage.
The most lengthy sequence to be trimmed shows the Richard
Dreyfuss character building a replica of Devil's tower in his
living room; it's about half the length it was before. There's
more to the film's ending, now, but the two most striking
additions are one scene and a single shot. In the new scene,
Dreyfuss explains how he grew up with Disney 'sPinocchio, and
we begin to get a sense of the film's narrative roots. The new
shot, very brief and telling, shows the great shadow of a
spacecraft wedding the fantastic and the commonplace as it
glides over Indiana farmland. A magical movie. Playing at the
Old Mill, Mountain View.

Alien ★ ★★
Laurel, San Carlos
Ridley Scott directed this night
marish science-fiction movie about a
crew of a spacecraft menaced by a cre
ature that hungers for human flesh.
Alien is essentially a bug-eyed mons
ter movie from the '50s revamped
with '70s technology, and it is as emo
tionally limited as its predecessors.
Under Scott's atmospheric, quirky di
rection, however, Alien has a punch
and wit to it that hits even the most
skeptical viewer right between the
eyes. Alien is the best thriller we've
had since Jaws.
The seven-member (at the begin
ning, anyway) cast includes Tom Sker
ritt, Sigourney Weaver (a bit of trivia:
Weaver graduated from Stanford) and
Veronica Cartwright (still more trivia:
Cartwright is the grown-up version of
the little girl in The Birds). Plays to
