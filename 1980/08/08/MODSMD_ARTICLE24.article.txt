Kennedy struggle continues
WASHINGTON — Despite claims of victory by
Sen. Edward Kennedy and acknowledgements of
some "softness" from the backers of President
Jimmy Carter, the odds last night remained against
success for the Kennedy-backed effort to overturn
the proposed Democratic National Convention rule
binding delegates to their candidate pledges.
Kennedy said " the 'open' rule will win by 2 to 1,
or 3 to 1," but officials in his campaign acknow
ledged that the "hard count" of delegates ready to
overturn the binding commitment was about 150
votes short of a majority.
Robert Strauss, chairman of the Carter cam
paign, said the "worst case" estimate for the presi
dent still gave him a 350-vote margin over the Mas
sachusetts senator on what both sides agree will be
the key vote at the convention.
The roll call, scheduled for Monday evening, will
be on a Kennedy challenge to the proposed conven
tion rule allowing replacement of any delegate who
threatens to bolt from the candidate preference ex
pressed at the time of his or her election.
Carter goes into the convention with 1985 dele
gates to Kennedy's 1243, with 103 uncommitted,
according to United Press International. Unless the
"loyalty rule" is overturned, Kennedy strategists
acknowledge that Carter's renomination is a cer
tainty.
In Los Angeles, the United Steel Workers of
America voted overwhelmingly for a tepid en
dorsement of Carter's reelection after Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie promised a strong military
posture that would not refuel an arms race.
Woman sailor acquitted
LONG BEACH — The first of eight women
sailors to face disciplinary action on charges of
committing homosexual acts aboard the USS Nor
ton Sound was found innocent yesterday.
A U.S. Navy administrative discharge board
ruled there was no evidence that Petty Officer 3rd
Class Tangela Gaskins, 25, had engaged in
homosexual activities with crewmates and recom
mended that she be kept in the service.
Gaskins sat stone-faced as the senior officer of
the two men and one woman on the board read its
decision. Then she burst into tears, embraced her
lawyers, and ran from the room to call her mother
and boyfriend with the news.
The verdict ended a four-day hearing, the first of
at least three scheduled this month. A second
three-member panel will be sworn in Friday for
another hearing in which the Navy will attempt to
present evidence against three of the women. Navy

prosecutors said the Gaskins case was the weakest
they had.
The hearings — a series of quasi-judicial tribun
als in which unsworn testimony is acceptable and
many of the usual rules of evidence do not apply —
are not courts-martial, but can result in a sailor's
dismissal from the Navy. The recommendations of
the hearing board are subject to appeal higher up
the chain-of-command.
Allen blasts Gulf of Mexico
MERIDH, Mexico — Hurricane Allen, a storm
with a fury never before recorded in the northwest
ern Caribbean, built devastating 185 mph winds
and 15-foot waves yesterday as it swept past the
Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico. Allen
has killed 71 people in its 1200-mile rampage.
Allen's fringes pounded Isla Mujeres and other
pleasure resorts on the Mexican peninsula, then the
hurricane moved north toward the Gulf Coast of the
United States, the U.S. National Weather Service
reported.
Estimated wind speeds had dropped to 1 75 mph
by 9 p.m., and the hurricane's speed slowed to 18
mph on a west-northwest course — compared with
its 25 mph advance Wednesday.
"If the hurricane continues on this track tonight,
it will be necessary to issue a hurricane watch for
portions of the Texas coast Friday," a weather ser
vice spokesman said. "Since part of the circulation
is now over land, the hurricane may weaken some
tonight (yesterday)."
A big day for the market
NEW YORK — The stock market surged ahead
yesterday in a full-speed-ahead advance that car
ried the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest
level in nearly 3V2 years.
Several other indicators climbed to new all-time
highs on the ninth heaviest trading volume in New
York Stock Exchange history. The Dow Jones in
dustrials, coming off an 8.45-point gain Wednes
day, jumped another 12.71 to 950.94. The last time
the average closed higher was at 950.96 on March
22, 1977.
Today's weather
Fair through tomorrow with coastal low clouds
and fog spreading inland nights and mornings. Lows
in the 50s. Highs in the 60s near the coast and the
70s to low 90s inland. Small craft advisory including
Suisun Bay and West Delta for westerly wind 15 to
35 mph decreasing south of the Bay Bridge nights
and mornings. San Francisco 62, Oakland Airport
72, Redwood City 82.

sailors to face disciplinary action on charges of
committing homosexual acts aboard the USS Nor
ton Sound was found innocent yesterday.
A U.S. Navy administrative discharge board
ruled there was no evidence that Petty Officer 3rd
Class Tangela Gaskins, 25, had engaged in
homosexual activities with crewmates and recom
mended that she be kept in the service.
Gaskins sat stone-faced as the senior officer of
the two men and one woman on the board read its
decision. Then she burst into tears, embraced her
lawyers, and ran from the room to call her mother
and boyfriend with the news.
The verdict ended a four-day hearing, the first of
at least three scheduled this month. A second
three-member panel will be sworn in Friday for
another hearing in which the Navy will attempt to
present evidence against three of the women. Navy

prosecutors said the Gaskins case was the weakest
they had.
The hearings — a series of quasi-judicial tribun
als in which unsworn testimony is acceptable and
many of the usual rules of evidence do not apply —
are not courts-martial, but can result in a sailor's
dismissal from the Navy. The recommendations of
the hearing board are subject to appeal higher up
the chain-of-command.
Allen blasts Gulf of Mexico
MERIDH, Mexico — Hurricane Allen, a storm
with a fury never before recorded in the northwest
ern Caribbean, built devastating 185 mph winds
and 15-foot waves yesterday as it swept past the
Yucatan Peninsula into the Gulf of Mexico. Allen
has killed 71 people in its 1200-mile rampage.
Allen's fringes pounded Isla Mujeres and other
pleasure resorts on the Mexican peninsula, then the
hurricane moved north toward the Gulf Coast of the
United States, the U.S. National Weather Service
reported.
Estimated wind speeds had dropped to 1 75 mph
by 9 p.m., and the hurricane's speed slowed to 18
mph on a west-northwest course — compared with
its 25 mph advance Wednesday.
"If the hurricane continues on this track tonight,
it will be necessary to issue a hurricane watch for
portions of the Texas coast Friday," a weather ser
vice spokesman said. "Since part of the circulation
is now over land, the hurricane may weaken some
tonight (yesterday)."
A big day for the market
NEW YORK — The stock market surged ahead
yesterday in a full-speed-ahead advance that car
ried the Dow Jones industrial average to its highest
level in nearly 3V2 years.
Several other indicators climbed to new all-time
highs on the ninth heaviest trading volume in New
York Stock Exchange history. The Dow Jones in
dustrials, coming off an 8.45-point gain Wednes
day, jumped another 12.71 to 950.94. The last time
the average closed higher was at 950.96 on March
22, 1977.
Today's weather

and fog spreading inland nights and mornings. Lows
in the 50s. Highs in the 60s near the coast and the
70s to low 90s inland. Small craft advisory including

Kennedy struggle continues
WASHINGTON — Despite claims of victory by
Sen. Edward Kennedy and acknowledgements of
some "softness" from the backers of President
Jimmy Carter, the odds last night remained against
success for the Kennedy-backed effort to overturn
the proposed Democratic National Convention rule
binding delegates to their candidate pledges.
Kennedy said " the 'open' rule will win by 2 to 1,
or 3 to 1," but officials in his campaign acknow
ledged that the "hard count" of delegates ready to
overturn the binding commitment was about 150
votes short of a majority.
Robert Strauss, chairman of the Carter cam
paign, said the "worst case" estimate for the presi
dent still gave him a 350-vote margin over the Mas
sachusetts senator on what both sides agree will be
the key vote at the convention.
The roll call, scheduled for Monday evening, will
be on a Kennedy challenge to the proposed conven
tion rule allowing replacement of any delegate who
threatens to bolt from the candidate preference ex
pressed at the time of his or her election.
Carter goes into the convention with 1985 dele
gates to Kennedy's 1243, with 103 uncommitted,
according to United Press International. Unless the
"loyalty rule" is overturned, Kennedy strategists
acknowledge that Carter's renomination is a cer
tainty.
In Los Angeles, the United Steel Workers of
America voted overwhelmingly for a tepid en
dorsement of Carter's reelection after Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie promised a strong military
posture that would not refuel an arms race.
