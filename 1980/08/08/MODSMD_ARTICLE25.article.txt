# Aid of 'satellites' to Soviets traced
## 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
In the past two decades, five of
the Soviet Union's Eastern
European satellite countries
"have contributed in a fairly
large measure to Moscow's suc
cess in the Third World," accord
ing to Prof. Janos Radvanyi of
Mississippi State University, a
specialist in contemporary Rus
sian and Eastern European dip
lomatic history.
Speaking here Tuesday, the
former Hungarian diplomat and
head of the Hungarian Embassy
in the United States, said the di
verse activities of Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Hungary, and Poland "prom
oted closer ties with the emerg
ing nations of Africa, Asia, and
Latin America."
He added that, "their concen
trated efforts kept the interna
tional balance of power further
toward the Kremlin-lead
socialists."
During the Khruschev era,
which lasted until 1964, the five
countries focused on South and
Southeast Asia, and the Arab
Middle East.
"In contrast to the U.S., the
five Eastern European coun
tries, as did the Soviet Union,

accepted neutrality as the guid
ing principle of the newly emerg
ing nations. They supported the
Third World'sgrievances against
their former colonial rulers and
gave unflinching support to the
liberation movements.
"This proved to be remarka
bly successful in arousing hatred
of Western imperialism and in
weakening Western political and
economic influence," Radvanyi
said.
Brezhnev came to power in
1965, and was confronted with a
foreign policy that was failing to
preserve the support of pro-
Soviet regimes, as evidenced by
the overthrow of politically
friendly leaders in five Third
World countries and their de
creased cooperation with East
ern Europe.
Among the new policies gen
erated to correct this, "the most
striking innovation was the deci
sion to provide miliary assistance
to gain power," Radvanyi said.
"Contrary to the activities of
the past, the five Eastern Euro
pean countries signed friendship
and cooperation treaties and un
dertook some miliary commit
ment to radical Arab, pro-
Soviet, and friendly nations."
