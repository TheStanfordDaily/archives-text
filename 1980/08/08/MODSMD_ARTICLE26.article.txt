From the Associated Press
SACRAMENTO â€” Cam
paign workers for independent
presidential candidate John An
derson have filed more than
400,000 petition signatures, four
times the number needed to put
him on the California ballot.
County election officials
statewide have been given the
signatures and must now verify
their validity.
The large number filed makes
it virtually certain that Anderson
will receive the 101,300 valid

signatures of registered voters
needed to place him on the ballot
as an independent candidate.
It could be the largest number
of signatures ever filed on behalf
of an independent presidential
candidate in California, said
Caren Daniels, spokeswoman
for Secretary of State March
Fong Eu.
The deadline for filing signa
tures is today, and more will be
filed, said Carolyn Stewart, An
derson's California campaign
coordinator.
