# Fire prevention on the Row: Storey blaze dramatizes need
## 
### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
"Discourage people from
sleeping in totally enclosed
spaces like boxed-in lofts . . .
In a smoky fire, given that
smoke rises, people in such
areas will be dust, dog meat,
outahere, history, gone.
People may want to do it
anyway, but at least they'll
know it's their funeral."
Bill Offutt, former assistant
director of the Row.
Since last March's fire at
Storey House, the Palo Alto
Fire Department and Row of
ficials have increased their ef
forts to inform Row "respon
sibilcs" such as RAs and
house managers how to avoid
fire risks both technically and
individually.
Before the Storey fire, fire
escapes and smoke alarms
had been installed in 22 Row
houses at a cost of over
$650,000. This summer both
Grove-Lasuen and Grove-
Mayfield, Columbae, the DU
house and Hurlburt are in the
process of having sprinklers
installed.
In other efforts, the Fire
Department Officer Dan
Smith will be working closely
with Row and University offi
cials to provide fire risk in
formation during orientation
and throughout the year.
Mandatory fire drills have
been upped to once a quarter.
As a fire hazard, the Row
presents many unique prob
lems. Houses such as Lamda
Nu, Synergy, Phi Psi, and the
Delt House are all on a hill,
far away from fire de
partment services, and could
experience water pressure
problems for fire hoses. Also,
most of the roofs of the row
houses were built to a build
ing code that did not require
fire breaks, hence the rapid

spread of fire in the Storey
incident. Firemen in that in
stance did punch holes in the
roof to let smoke and fire out
but could not act fast enough
without the help of such
built-in breaks.
Until Offutt initiated a
series of meetings and hand
outs last spring quarter, no
other fire risk material had

been designed recently. Since
the average generation of
students on the Row is only
about two years, Offutt felt
that this kind of presentation
would be annually necessary.
Included in his program
were three hand-outs and a
sheet to be posted on the cir
cuit box. These posters
warned of overloading outlets

especially with popcorn pop
pers, hair dryers, and hot
pots, smoking in bed, clogged
exit ways and propping open
doors in the event of a tire
because closed doors serve as
fire breaks.
As for detection systems
within the house, smoke
alarms serve as the best warn
ing system. Frank Jurian, as
sistant public safety director,
said the smoke detectors are
capable of sounding an alarm
at both the Stanford Fire sta
tion and also at the Palo Alto
Fire Department Communi
cations Center. They can lo
cate the fire and indicate
whether the fire will require
inside firefighting to fight it;
they will also indicate
whether it was the result of
tampering with the detector,
or whether the sprinklers
should be activated.
"The leading cause of fires
is smoking," Offut explained.
As he urged earlier in one of
his hand-outs, "Let your
smoking be metaphorical."
The Row has historically
been the victim of fires. In
1972, Fathrop, then an all
women dorm, was tire
bombed during a dance. Fast
year, the roof above the
kitchen ot the Dekc house
was partially burned due to a
grease fire. The storage shed
at the rear of Synergy house
was destroyed in a fire of De
cember 1974 with an esti
mated damage of $4000.
"Fire is frankly something
you don't think about."
claims Offutt. "Fire preven
tion collides with the average
student's lifo-stylc. Fook at
popcorn poppers, hair dryers,
etc. They see these things as
necessary. There is also an
innate fear of firemen ... it's
getting the two sides together
on this that causes the most
trouble."

houses were built to a build
ing code that did not require
fire breaks, hence the rapid

spread of fire in the Storey
incident. Firemen in that in
stance did punch holes in the
roof to let smoke and fire out
but could not act fast enough
without the help of such
built-in breaks.
Until Offutt initiated a
series of meetings and hand
outs last spring quarter, no
other fire risk material had

been designed recently. Since
the average generation of
students on the Row is only
about two years, Offutt felt
that this kind of presentation
would be annually necessary.
Included in his program
were three hand-outs and a
sheet to be posted on the cir
cuit box. These posters
warned of overloading outlets

especially with popcorn pop
pers, hair dryers, and hot
pots, smoking in bed, clogged
exit ways and propping open
doors in the event of a tire
because closed doors serve as
fire breaks.
As for detection systems
within the house, smoke
alarms serve as the best warn
ing system. Frank Jurian, as
sistant public safety director,
said the smoke detectors are
capable of sounding an alarm
at both the Stanford Fire sta
tion and also at the Palo Alto
Fire Department Communi
cations Center. They can lo
cate the fire and indicate
whether the fire will require
inside firefighting to fight it;
they will also indicate
whether it was the result of
tampering with the detector,
or whether the sprinklers
should be activated.
"The leading cause of fires
is smoking," Offut explained.
As he urged earlier in one of
his hand-outs, "Let your
smoking be metaphorical."
The Row has historically
been the victim of fires. In
1972, Fathrop, then an all
women dorm, was tire
bombed during a dance. Fast
year, the roof above the
kitchen ot the Dekc house
was partially burned due to a
grease fire. The storage shed
at the rear of Synergy house
was destroyed in a fire of De
cember 1974 with an esti
mated damage of $4000.
"Fire is frankly something
you don't think about."
claims Offutt. "Fire preven
tion collides with the average
student's lifo-stylc. Fook at
popcorn poppers, hair dryers,
etc. They see these things as
necessary. There is also an
innate fear of firemen ... it's
getting the two sides together
on this that causes the most
trouble."

Last March's fire at Storey House caused substantial damage but
fortunately no injuries. Row officials and firefighters are now at
work improving the Row's ability to prevent and limit fires.
"Discourage people from
sleeping in totally enclosed
spaces like boxed-in lofts . . .
In a smoky fire, given that
smoke rises, people in such
areas will be dust, dog meat,
outahere, history, gone.
People may want to do it
anyway, but at least they'll
know it's their funeral."
Bill Offutt, former assistant
director of the Row.
Since last March's fire at
Storey House, the Palo Alto
Fire Department and Row of
ficials have increased their ef
forts to inform Row "respon
sibilcs" such as RAs and
house managers how to avoid
fire risks both technically and
individually.
Before the Storey fire, fire
escapes and smoke alarms
had been installed in 22 Row
houses at a cost of over
$650,000. This summer both
Grove-Lasuen and Grove-
Mayfield, Columbae, the DU
house and Hurlburt are in the
process of having sprinklers
installed.
In other efforts, the Fire
Department Officer Dan
Smith will be working closely
with Row and University offi
cials to provide fire risk in
formation during orientation
and throughout the year.
Mandatory fire drills have
been upped to once a quarter.
As a fire hazard, the Row
presents many unique prob
lems. Houses such as Lamda
Nu, Synergy, Phi Psi, and the
Delt House are all on a hill,
far away from fire de
partment services, and could
experience water pressure
problems for fire hoses. Also,
most of the roofs of the row
houses were built to a build
ing code that did not require
fire breaks, hence the rapid

spread of fire in the Storey
incident. Firemen in that in
stance did punch holes in the
roof to let smoke and fire out
but could not act fast enough
without the help of such
built-in breaks.
