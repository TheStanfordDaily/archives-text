## W. German economy to face mild recession 
### Bradley Grahan The Washington Post 
BONN — The West German
economy has managed so far this
year to steady itselt aginst the
combined shocks of OPEC oil
increases and high domestic in
terest rates, churning out a
growth rate that is still above
target — and comfortably out of
step with the recession-pained
United States.
But it is a German habit to
look at the wrinkles instead of
the grin, and characteristically.
West Germany is braced for a turn
for the worse.
The shadow of a sharp
downturn began to creep over
the country with the announce
ment this week that unemploy
ment rose a steep 9 percent in
July over June toa total 853,000.
While the proportion of the total
work force out of work still isn't
much bv U.S. standards — only

3.7 percent — the summer jump
was the largest in years for West
Germany. It reflects a general
slowing down of the German
economy as forecast for the sec
ond half of 1980.
Production in key capital and
consumer goods industries has
fallen, and the construction sec
tor registered a dramatic drop,
down 4.5 percent from May to
June as a result of high interest
rates and lower public spending.
Bonn officials still believe that
output will rise 2.5 percent for
the year, largely because West
German growth was rapid in the
early part of 1980, soaring 5.5
percent in the first quarter over
the year before.
But since this is a federal elec
tion year, government officials
are showing more than usual
concern. The new unemploy
ment figures are likely to pivot
public attention away from the
war-and-peace foreign debates
that dominated German national
discussion during the first half of
the year and toward the one issue
that Germans like to worry
about most: the economic out
look.
It may seem a bit strange for a
nation that has been one of the
world's postwar economic mod
els, but ever since the late 1 9605,
Economic concerns have ranked
first among those things Ger
mans fret about. A March poll by
the Allensbaeh Institute listed
these as the top four German
worries: rising prices, en
dangered energy supplies, en
dangered environment and in
creasing unemployment.
