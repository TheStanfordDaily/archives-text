# Dutch government aids artists

THE HAGUE, Netherlands
(AP) — The Dutch government
buys art to keep artists from
Starving in garrets in the land of
Rembrandt and Van Gogh —
purchasing about 200,000 pieces
in 30 years — but some say the
practice merely fosters unworthy
works.
Some of the artworks are
loaned to public buildings, but
niost are crammed into dusty
Warehouses, infuriating artists
and frustrating a government
that has replaced the kings,
popes and merchants of old as a
patron of the arts.
The government program

began in 1949 to try to help
about 100 young artists through
hard times after World War 11,
much like the Works Progress
Administration's system of art
commissions in the United States
in the 19305.
But unlike the WPA, the
Dutch subsidies mushroomed
with prosperity. The system, be
lieved unique in the world, is
among dozens of entrenched so
cial welfare programs in this na
tion of 14 million people.
About 2850 artists get bet
ween 373 and 555 guilders
weekly—slBs t05275 U.S. dol
lars — with paid vacations, for
paintings, sculptures, si 1 ksc
ree ns, lithographs and other

works. The program now costs
about 110 million guilders —
$55 million American — annu
ally, and buys about 20,000
works of art.
"It's very depressing to know
that your work has been sitting
for 10 years in a warehouse,"
says Hans van der Sande, a
sculptor who sells about two
works yearly to the government.
But van der Sande, general
secretary of the major Dutch ar
tists' union, said the program en
courages daring, innovative art
— work that could not survive in
the commercial market.
Some culture ministry officials
say artists lose their drive and
imagination because money is
coming in. And critics say much
of the work is wretched art and
the best artists shun government
aid.
The program's goal is to aid
artists, not to create brilliant art.
Funds come from the social af
fairs ministry — the welfare de
partment — not from the culture
ministry.
Pieter Utt, who heads the
program for the social ministry,
$aid it's healthy to build a broad
creative base and keep artists at
work, even if the art is not all
museum quality. And he said the
program costs no more than
straight welfare.
He said that in its early years
the program helped many un
knowns — such as painter Karel
Appel — who are now respected
worldwide.
