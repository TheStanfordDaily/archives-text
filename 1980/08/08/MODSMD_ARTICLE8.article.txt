## Delegates stand by Carter 
### Barry Sussman The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Jimmy Carter's delegates to the
Democratie National Conven
tion feel that he has been good if
not outstanding in office. They
stand behind Carter on a wide
variety of issues that divide the
party. And, most importantly,
they believe Jimmy Carter has a
strong prospect of winning in
November.
These are among the key find
ings of a Washington Post poll of
a random sample of 591 dele
gates. While all things are possi
ble in politics, the clear thrust of
the poll findings is that it is e.\-
tremelv unlikHv that a dumn-
Carter move can succeed at the
convention, which opens Mon
day in New York City.

The poll was conducted from
July 22 to July 30, a period in
which national opinion polls
were showing Republican
Ronald Reagan with a huge lead
over Carter and when revela
tions about Billy Carter's deal
ings with Libya dominated
thenews.
Nevertheless, 98 percent of
the delegates committed to Car
ter at the time of their selection
told Post interviewers that they
still "personally prefer" Carter
as the party's nominee.
With apparent disregard for
the conventional wisdom, they
give Carter a far better than even
chance against Reagan in the
Nov. 4 election. In fact, the Car
ter delegates appeared more posi
tive about his chances than the
Reagan delegates felt about the
GOP nominee's chances, as dis

cerned in a similar Washington
Post poll of delegates before the
Republican convention in July.
The Carter delegates, on the
whole, gave the president better
than a 7-to-3 chance of beating
Reagan. Earlier, the Reagan de
legates appraised their candi
date's odds of winning as slightly
under 7 to 3.
"Carter ought to let the people
know what he's done," said one
New England Democratic dele
gate. "He's too modest."
"Take your excellent record
out of the secret cabinet and tell
the people all you've done as
president," a California delegate
advised.
"Run your campaign like
Truman did in 'give 'em hell,"'
said a delegate from the state of
Washington.
