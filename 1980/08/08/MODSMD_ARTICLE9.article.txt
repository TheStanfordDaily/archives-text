# Iranian marchers here legally

WASHINGTON — The De
partment of Justice told Presi
dent Jimmy Carter yesterday
that all but two of the 192 pro-
Khomeini Iranian de
monstrators released from de
tention Tuesday night were in
the United States legally.
The department's report was
immediately challenged bv John
Hambrick, an inspector for the
Immigration and Naturalization
Serv ice. He said at least six of the
demonstrators were in violation
of immigration laws and that no
genuine verification of their
identity was made before they
were released.
Meanwhile, about 200 Ira
nians staged a pro-Khomeini
march to the White House amid
jeers and taunts from hundreds
of government workers and
tourists. Some of the de
monstrators were the targets of
eggs, tomatoes and soft drink

cans that were tossed by the bys
tanders.
Police surrounded the de
monstrators to prevent violence,
and the march ended after four
hours with the police escorting
the Iranians to waiting buses.
The Department of Justice is
sued its statement on the de
tainees in response to a White
House request for an investiga
tion of the examining process
into their legal status.
The department said that the
Iranians — 172 men and 20
women — who were taken into
federal custody after their arrest
during demonstrations in
Washington July 27 were
checked against an index of Ira
nians holding student visas that
was compiled last year.
The check "substantiated that
all but two of the Iranians were in
the United States within the
law." the statment said.
One Iranian was found to be
under deportation proceedings
and the other had been ordered

to show cause why he should not
be deported, the statement said.
It said the INS would continue to
gather and analyze information
about the group and would act
against anyone found to be "out
of status."
