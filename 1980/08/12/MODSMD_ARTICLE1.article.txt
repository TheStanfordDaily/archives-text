# Pac-10 suspends 5 from'80 grid action
## Rose Bowl only open to Stanford, Cal, Washingtons, Arizona 
### Rob Lempert Managing Editor 
The Rose Bowl race started early this year. It's still
August, but already USC. UCLA, Oregon, Oregon St..
and Arizona St. are out of the running. Yesterday the
presidents and chancellors of the Pacific-10 conference
disqualified these schools from any post-season play as a
punishment for transcript violations.
Only Stanford. California, Washington, Washington
St.and Arizona are left as contenders for the prestigious
trip to Pasadena — or anywhere else — this New Year's
day.
The Pac-10 council ruled that the five schools had
violated conference rules and standards "in the areas of
unearned credits, falsified transcripts and the unwar
ranted intrusion of athletic department interests into the
academic processes of the respective universities," ac
cording to the official statement released from its
meeting in Denver.
The teams will remain ineligible for one year.
"It's quite a shock — that's for sure," said Stanford
linebacker Dave Morze." I never thought they would cut
the Pac-10 in half."
Many of the players here concurred, but Scott
Johnson of the Sports Information office at Oregon St.
said the penalties were "really no surprise to us."

The five schools had been under investigation since
October, when it was first revealed that a number of
their athletes might be receiving credit for classes they
never intended or those which fell below the minimum

academic standards set by the Pac-10 conference.
In addition to the one-year disqualifications, the
council also ruled that all football games won by UC'LA
in 1977, Oregon St.in 1977 and 1979. and by Oregon in
1977,1978. and 197 1 ) must be forfeited; that the USC
track and field team will forfeit its I 97S Pac-10 title, be
ineligible tor the 11 conference crown and be barred
from the Pac-10 and NCAA track and field champion
ship meets; that the Oregon swim team w ill have its 19N0
results adjusted, and that Oregon will lose three initial
football grants in aid and be placed on probation for two
years.
It is unclear from the initial reports whether or not the
penalized teams will be allowed to appear on television
this season, but Stanford Sports Information Director
Bob Rose said he believes that the teams will be pre
vented from signing any new television contracts. He
added, however, games already scheduled to be tele
vised, such as the USC-Notre Dame game, will probablv be
allowed to be aired.
Stanford Athletic Director Andy Geiger said he had
empathy for the schools involved but added that the
disqualifications will not cheapen the upcoming gridiron
cam paign.
"We are still looking forward to each and every game
of the coming football season." he said.
