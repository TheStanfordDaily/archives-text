remnants of Hurricane Allen,
described as the second strongest

tury. dealt Texas a parting blow
with widespread flooding yes
terday and dissolved into a soggy
mess over Mexico.
A deluge that brought up to 16
inches of rain to some areas as
the storm passed drove
thousands from their homes yes
terday.
Corpus Christi police reported
they found on North Beach the
body of an unidentified man.
who may have been the storm's
first victim in the United States,
not counting two others who
died of heart attacks.

Virtually all roads were closed
from Port Aransas and Corpus
Christi, on the middle coast, to
the Rio Grande Valley in South
Texas, preventing many of the
200.000 residents who had tied
over the weekend from returning
to their homes.
National Guardsmen anil vol
unteers in the Coastal Bend
evacuated about 2000 people to
shelters in the Alice area and
about 450 to Kingsville as 16
inches of rain built floods five

feet deep.
About 850 were sheltered in
an Edinburg junior high school
Sunday night after floodwaters
rose to four feet. The National
Guard was called in because
there weren't enough fire de
partment vehicles, according to
Pearl Mathis, a resident.
The National Weather Service
predicted the Nueces River, near
Corpus Christi, would rise to
seven feet above normal. Baffin
Bay, near Kingsville, had tides

nine to 10 feet above normal.
Allen, meanwhile, was gone it
not forgotten. At 6 a.m. yester
day, the National Hurricane
Center in Miami pronounced the
system — downgraded to a trop
ical storm Sunday night — a trop
ical depression, with winds of 35
mph. Allen continued to dump
heavy rain as it moved to the
west northwest across Mexico.
Mike Wallace, executive vice
president of Texas Citrus
Mutual, said in Harlingen that

the area's citrus orchards and
crop "came through in a lot bet
ter shape than 1 thought. The
trees look in good shape and
there's lots of fruit left."
But Cameron County agricul
tural agent Don Cowan in San
Benito estimated $15 million in
damage to the county's cotton
crop.
Allen had been the second
largest Atlantic hurricane on re
cord as it careened through the
Caribbean with winds up to 185
mph, killing at least 100 people.
