## DOE funding festers with citizens' money 
### 
The record of waste and ineffi
ciency among federal bureauc
racies has varied over the years.
But a young upstart, the De
partment of Energy, threatens to
break all the old records.
The origins of the DOE lie
shrouded in the noxious mists of
the price and wage controls insti
tuted under the administration
of President Richard Nixon.
Most of the controls were lifted
in 1973 and 1974, but the con
trols on energy prices continued.
In 1978 the DOE was created to
administer these controls and
handle a standby gasoline ration
ing plan.
Thus a short-term distortion
of the economy gave birth to a
permanent government institu
tion charged with goals that now
guarantee long-term economic
disruption.
The record of the department
boggles a rational mind. Accord
ing to the Federal Budget for
1979, the department's budget
was $11 billion, or about what
the United States p-?id for im
ported oil from Saudi Arabia for
that year.
It exceeds by $1.1 billion the
1979 profits of the four largest
U.S. oil companies. Spreading
this expenditure over domestic
oil production in 1979 yields a
bureaucracy surtax of over $3.50
per barrel of domestic crude.
Su ely with a massive budget
the department might be ac
complishing some good. The re
cord indicates otherwise.
In June, an article in the Los
Angeles Times indicated that the
DOE'sgasoline rationing plan, if
put into effect, would take 15
months to implement and would
be so inefficient that some 10
million drivers wouldn't receive
their ration coupons.
It might be hoped by some that
the government's experience
with earlier bureaucracies might
somehow make this one more ef
ficient and less corrupt. Not so
according to J. Kenneth Man
sfield, inspector general of the
DOE.
In a report to Energy Secret
ary Charles Duncan. Mansfield
noted that a "survey of internal
mail problems at DOE shows
that agency employees lost about
126,000 memos last year."

Likewise, "DOE workers have
made about $500,000 in per
sonal long-distance phone calls
on government phones, includ
ing one employee who called a
"Dial-a-Dirty-Joke' number in
St. Louis 42 times in two hours."
Mansfield's diligence has been
rewarded with a dead-end as
signment to France.
For all this the department
might be dismissed as another
benign bureaucratic tumor
funded to promote the idea that
new energy sources are being
developed. But the rules prom
ulgated and enforced by the de
partment are far from benign.
In Alaska, which contains
many potential oil reserves the
size of the North Slope, the DOE
has allowed the drilling of over
87 exploratory wells.
This compares with over
49,000 such wells drilled in the
lower 48 states in 1979. In fact,
most of Alaska is owned by the
federal government and closed
to even basic exploration.
Not even hard-line propo
nents of regulation for consumer
benefit can feel satisfied with
DOE policies. According to Wil
liam Hoar, writing for American
Opinion, the DOE in May de
termined that the Standard Oil
Company of Ohio did not meet
federal energy price regulations.
SOHIO must adhere to special
price rules because it invested in
the development of North Slope
deposits. They were charging
prices that were deemed too low
and were ordered to raise their
gasoline prices by 10 cents a gal
lon.
Shortly before the Ohio presi
dential primary the DOE re
versed its ruling. But now that
the primary is over the ruling has
once again been reinstated.
SOHIO will have to raise its
prices.
The day that the DOE is
abolished is the day the United
States will be on its way to a
genuine energy policy. It should
be one that heeds private
economic initiative and reduces
government interference in
energy markets.
