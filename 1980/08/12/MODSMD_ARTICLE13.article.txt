All right, I too am tired of
reading about the "Billy Carter
Affair," and 1 too feel that it has
been hopelessly overblown in
the press. On the other hand, I
was so struck by some of the
president's comments at last
week's press conference that
some irresistible possibilities
came to mind.
First, the president claimed
that he, Billy and the Attorney
General of the United States all
"forgot" and that that was the
cause of the most prominent ap
pearance of impropriety.
But. while admitting an er
roneous oversight there he
steadfastly defended his use of
his brother as a diplomatic agent,
and said that he felt it was proper
to Use family members in such a
capacity.
Listen, attending funerals and
inaugurations is one thing, but
negotiating the release of our
hostages in Iran is quite another.
If family diplomacy is the rule in
such serious situations, who

knows what could happen next?
Will the next ploy have little
Amy infiltrating the elementary
school across the street from the
embassy? Could she gain influ
ence with some of the younger
"students?"
I see Miss Lillian posing as the
Ayatollah's mother-in-law; we
know how influential they can
be.
Of course. Chip Carter could
infiltrate the embassy itself, pos
ing as one of the young Iranian
students. Put a black beard on
him, and you couldn't tell the dif
ference.
Following the Carter example,
it wouldn't be long before we
started evaluating presidential
candidates on the basis of their
families' potential overseas "in
fluence."
Brotherless Ted Kennedy
starts with a disadvantage, but
surely some of those several
sons, daughters and nephews
could gain some influence over
seas. I wonder how many of the

Teheran terrorists are preppies,
though.
And whom would Ronald
Reagan use to gain influence
with our adversaries. Would
daughter Maureen be sent to dis
cuss women's rights with Kho
meini? I think not.
Of course, there is always the
chance that future presidents will
not follow the Carter example
and will employ members of the
State Department and the dip
lomatic corps when dealing with
foreign powers.
I think such a change may im
prove the world-wide image of
America and the national image
of the presidency, but it wouldn't
be nearly as much fun, would it?
Well, if we've learned nothing
else from the "Billy Affair, at
least we know why Jerry Brown
never got elected president.
