## Boycotting an important right 
### 
In this June'sprimary election,
Santa Clara County voters over
whelmingly defeated Proposi
tion A, the Santa Clara County
gay discrimination ordinance.
That defeat does not, how
ever, put the issue behind us:
similar measures ha\*e been and
will continue to be subjects for
fierce debate in this area and
around the nation. It is impor
tant to try to untangle the moral
and human rights issues raised by
that debate.
It is imperative that we repeal
all laws which oppress gays, that
we end harassment of gays by
law enforcement authorities,
that we stop the violence and in
timidation to which gays are sub
jected, and that we work to dis
pel the atmosphere of bigotry
and hatred which is directed to
ward homosexuals.
But anti-discrimination mea
sures such as Proposition A are
the wrong means to pursue these
ends.
Measures such as Proposition
A rest on the premise that no one
has a right to ostracize or boycott
or refuse to associate with
another person because of that

person's opinions or personal
behavior.
Consider the consequences of
that principle. The National Or
ganization of Women and other
associations have organized a na
tional boycott against states
which have refused to ratify the
Equal Rights Amendment.
One of these states, Missouri,
went to court to have the boycott
declared illegal and to obtain
damages. Missouri, fortunately,
lost its case.
But under the principle adhered
to by those who backed Proposi
tion A, Missouri should have
won and NOW should have been
forbidden to discriminate against
those who hold views and engage
in behavior which NOW finds
abhorrent.
When Anita Bryant engaged
in a national campaign of bigotry
and hatred against homosexuals,
gays organized a boycott of the
Florida citrus association which
employed Bryant.
Bryant claimed that this
boycott violated her freedom of
speech by discriminating against
her on the basis of her personal
beliefs and moral values.
If one accepts the anti
discrimination/anti-boycott logic
of the supporters of Proposition
A, one would have to agree with
Bryant that gays had no right to
boycott her because of moral
views and behavior that dis
gusted them.
In recent years, the Ku Klux
Klan has expanded in numbers
and visibility. Of course, the
KKK's right to organize and to
express its views is guaranteed by
the First Amendment.
But should not intelligent.

humane people have the right to
show their horror of the Klan by
socially isolating the Klan, by re
fusing to hire or rent to Klan
supporters?
A person of liberal sympathies
may be tempted to object that
these examples completely miss
the central point: that Bryant
and Klansmen are evil people
and homosexuals are not; that it
should be legal to boycott or dis
criminate against evil people but
illegal to discriminate against or
boycott anyone else.
That position is a dangerous
one. It would enact into law a
distinction between morally ac
ceptable and unacceptable
people, those whom one may
boycott and those whom one
may not.
Freedom of association is the
most fundamental of human
rights. Just as we have the right
to boycott or discriminaate
against bigots like Bryant, so we
must also grant persons like
Bryant the right to discriminate
as they wish.
While those who support
anti-discrimination laws such as
Proposition A are doubtless
well-intentioned, their position
and logic are deeply flawed. We
should oppose anti
discrimination/anti-boycott laws
and instead concentrate on end
ing the violence, oppression and
bigotry to which gays and other
unpopular minorities are sub
ject.
