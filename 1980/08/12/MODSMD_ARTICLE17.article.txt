# Escondido Village residents "discontent"
## Rents increase by "surprising" percentage 
### Gail Edmonson Schares Staff Writer 
It surprises few that rents in
Escondido Village (EV) are ris
ing again this year.
What is surprising is the
amount of the increase: for a
one-bedroom apartment, it
comes to $32. Rent hikes for the
same apartment over the past
five years have been only $17
annually.
Effective September 1, 1980.
rates for Escondido Village
apartments will be increased 14
percent to: 1 bedroom for $261 a
month, 2 bedrooms for $299 a
month, 3 bedrooms for $323 a
month.
Discontent has arisen among
Escondido residents who realize
that the Village generates a
surplus of income for the Uni
versity each year(s 140 thousand
in 1979-80, and estimated $330
thousand for 1980-81).
By contrast, undergraduate
housing runs a deficit each year
(it lost $340 thousand in 1979-
80). Many Escondido residents
feel they are continually sub
sidizing undergraduate housing.
According to Jason Mavis, di
rector of facilities and services,
the University decided two years
ago to place all housing expenses
and income under one budget:
"The plan was to attain a zero
balance for all housing," said
Mavis.
What this means is that no
single dorm or apartment space
necessarily pays for itself: "You
can't say a person is paying the
exact cost of the unit he lives in,"
said Mavis. By policy, student
housing facilities at the Univer
sity must pay their own way.
Both graduates and under
graduates, therefore, share the
benefits of all surpluses and the
burden of all deficits.
The cost of energy is the
largest factor in the recent rent
increase, according to Adminis
trative officials. By University
estimates, the utilities bill for Es
condido Village is expected to
rise from $780,000 in 1979-80,
to an estimated $1,018,000 in
1980-81. These figures take into
account the 65 percent increase
in the cost of natural gas last
March.
The second most significant
factor in the rent increase this
year is"A-21," a federal regula
tion that changes the Universi
ty's accounting procedure. Costs
for University services are real

located to each department di
rectly. For example, housing of
fices will be charged a certain fee
for the number of purchase or
ders they generate.
Financial analyst Leslie Quin
tero said the University's indi
vidual departments have no con
trol over the costs imposed by
this regulation.
Cost of repairs and mainte
nance is the third largest compo
nent of the recent rent increase.
Administrators are anticipating
new roofing costs for several Es
condido Village buildings when
the major repairs for under
graduate housing have been
completed.
Mavis explained that Escon
dido is a newer complex, and
"much easier to break even on.
or to draw a surplus from."
Nevertheless, said Mavis, Es
condido generates its own por
tion of yearly repair bills, unique
to the Village: "Out of a $1.2-
$1.4 million bill for housing re
pairs this year, Escondido gener
ated $200,000 in elevator
maintenance expenses alone.
Other factors affecting the
rent bill at F.V include adminis
trators' salaries and costs, staff
benefits, supplies and services,
the residential education prog
ram, major maintenance or re
pair reserve and debt service for
EV.
The major maintenance or re
pair reserve is actually another
surplus generated by EV rents.
EV residents pay twice in this
category â€” once for planned re
pairs and once into a reserve
fund for emergency repairs and
maintenance.
According to Mavis, the ideal
total for these two reserves com
bined is 10 percent of the operat
ing budget or $1910 thousand
for 1980-81, though this is not
presently the case. Due to heavy
repair expenses, the Administra
tion plans to run housing at a
deficit and draw on current re
serves for the next couple years.
When the reserve reaches two to
three percent of the operating
budget, it will be built up to 10
percent again.
According to Administration
officials, it is "good manage
ment" to build up operating re
serves and long term reserves:
"one is your checkbook, and one
is your savings account," finan
cial analysts said.
EV residents are divided in
their feelings about the recent

rent increase. Approximately
half of those interviewed
strongly oppose the large in
crease this year and feel that the
University should subsidize
housing costs.
One five-year resident said
that rent increases are "a matter
of petty people of narrow vision
who seek to holster their own
reputation bv making the budget
look good. They don't judge
themselves by how many stu
dents they house successfully,
but by coming in under budget."
Many students agreed that the
burden is especially heavy for
graduate students with children
and a limited income. The result
is that even grads living in the
Village must supplement their
income with outside work. Thus
it takes many graduate students
six to seven years to complete a
four-year Ph.D. program.
The extended stay in the small
quarters can result in quite a st
rain on family members. Accord

ing to one low-rise EV resident,
"living in a one-bedroom high
rise for seven years is grounds for
divorce."
Several students mentioned
that they would prefer to be able
to pay only for the gas and elec
tricity they used. According to
Jerry Parks, facilities manager
at EV, the University would
"love" to put each unit on indi
vidual utilities meters to prom
ote conservation, but the prop
osal is prohibitively expensive.
Overall, students feel lucky to
have been offered a place to live
at EV. Even those complaining
about the increase are aware that
off-campus rental rates arc dou
ble or even triple the rates at EV.
Close to campus, anything for
less than $350 a month is unin
habitable, and top rates have
reached $650 a month for one
bedroom. Outside a three-fnilc
radius from campus, one can find
an adequate one-bedroom
apartment for $315-$350 per

month.
As of fall, 1979, Stanford had
5277 graduate students, of which
1953 were given University
housing. According to Jean
Rudehouse, assignment secret
ary for family student housing,
the University does "a pretty
good job" of housing students
with children. However, more
than 900 unmarried graduate
students applied for 220 spaces
this May. Clearly, the majority of
single graduate students are left
to find their own housing.
The availability problem may
result in the University's impos
ing a limit on the number of
years graduate students can live
on campus to six or seven, said
incoming ASSU senate member
led Mitchell. "No one is happy
with this proposal," says Mitch
ell, but housing conditions are
forcing student leaders into a
"displeasing divide and conquer
position."

Escondido Village rents are rising by a surprising rate this year. Families with children are especially
worried that the rents are going to become prohibitive. Other worries are that the number of years grad
students can live in this housing may have to be restricted.
