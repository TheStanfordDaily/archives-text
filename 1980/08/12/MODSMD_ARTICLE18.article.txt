### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
The 112 ood Research Institute
here has been granted S2 million
b\ the Koret Foundation to tund
a new program aimed at the "al
ien lation of hunger through edu
cation and research" in food pol
icy.
It is the first major grant to be
made by the foundation, which
was formed by Joseph Koret and
his late wife, Stephanie Koret.
The Korets were the founders of
Koret of California, a successful
firm manufacturing women's
sportswear.
The proposal for the grant was
made by the director of the Food
Research Institute, Walter Fal
con. Falcon had suggested that
graduate students be given fel
lowships to study "food policy,

crop selection, trade agree
ments. price levels, facility de
velopment, and population dis
tribution." according to John
Gilliland, associate director of
development here, w ho has been
arranging the grant since De
cember.
The gift will be used over the
first five years to fund 20 Ph.D
students and establish a series of
lectures and conferences by dis
tinguished Third World nation
als to study the management,
production, and distribution of
food in their own countries.
Falcon praised the humanita
rian approach of the Koret
Foundation's directors, saying
"the foundation has shown that
it intends to have an interna
tional character and to fill some
of the philanthropic void left by

the untimely death of John Roc
kefeller III."
The donation's "careful
targeting could have a measura
ble impact in the short run and a
major impact on hunger reduc
tion by the year 2000," Falcon
said.
Food policy "is really where
you're going to have the most
impact," Gilliland emphasized.
Quoting Falcon, he said "In
1978, a Stanford trained food
economist, using technology de
veloped at the Stanford prog
ram, helped make decisions in
rice policy within Indonesia
which saved that country $600
million."
The foundation will also be
making grants to various educa
tional and social welfare prog''
rams in the greater Bay area.
