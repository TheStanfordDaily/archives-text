# Kennedy loses rules fight; withdraws

### Jack Nelson The Los Angeles Times 
NEW YORK — President
Jimmy Carter overwhelmed Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
yesterday in their bitter fight
over the delegate loyalty rule at
the Democratic National Con
vention, and Kennedy im
mediately ended his challenge to
Carter's renomination.
"The effort on the nomination
is over," declared a dejected
Kennedy. "My name will not be
placed in nomination.''
The swift and dramatic end to
Kennedy's 10-month battle
against the incumbent president
came after Carter used the full
power of his office to preserve
the delegate strength that he had
compiled in 35 primaries and 2 1
state caucuses.

Only three hours after the
opening gavel fell, the conven
tion voted. 1936.4 to 1390.6
(with four delegates not voting)
to support Carter on the loyalty
rule. The provision, which hinds
all delegates to vote on the first
ballot for the candidate to whom
they were pledged when elected,
had become the decisive test of
strength between Carter and
Kennedy.
Since Carter had won almost
2000 delegate votes — about
270 more than the 1666 needed
for nomination — adoption of
the rule assured the president's
renomination by the convention
tomorrow night, even if Ken
nedy had not withdrawn.
Smiling faintly, Kennedy said,
"1 am gratified by the support I
received on the rules fight to

night — but not quite as gratified
as President Carter." His sup
porters reacted to his atempt at
humor with silence and Kennedy
continued in a monotone, not
smiling. "President Carter's
forces have won an impressive
victory this evening," he said.
"And I am a realist and I know
what this result means. I have
called President Carter and con
gratulated him."
Kennedy said nothing directly
about whether he would support
Carter in the fall campaign, but
he hinted that much would de
pend on the final shape of the
party platform.
"The efforts for Democratic
principles must and will con
tinue" he said, calling on dele
gates to help him work for "A
truly Democratic platform."
The senator, who already has
won concessions from the Carter
camp on the wording of several
planks, is scheduled to address
the convention today. He is ex
pected to concentrate on
economic issues in hope of build
ing support for his proposal for
wage and price controls and a
$12 billion jobs program — both
issues on which Carter forces
have thus far refused to com
promise.
Rep. Michael Barnes (D-
Md.), a leader of the movement
for the so-called open conven
tion, hurried to congratulate the
Carter forces on their victory and
said he believed a majority of
"open convention" delegates
would back Carter for re
election in the fall.
As debate on the rule moved
toward its emotion-charged end
ing. great waves of cheers and
counter-cheers swept the con
vention floor at Madison Square
Garden.
"Keep it open," roared Ken
nedy backers, echoing their con
tention that the rule would pre
vent a so-callcd open conven
tion.
"Carter-Cartei-Carter-Carter,
came the response of the presi
dent's backers.

The Carter forces, leaving no
thing to chance, had built an
iron-bound majority by mobiliz
ing the full resources of the presi
dency to prevent Carter dele
gates from defecting to Ken
nedy's side.
At the height of the behind
the-scenes battle over the past
weekend, the Carter-Mondale
campaign committee dispatched
more than 500 different speak
ers to meet with delegates, ans
wer their questions and urge

them to stand firm. Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale, members
of the president's Cabinet, senior
White House aides and other top
administration officials were
thrown into the fight.
Typical was the experience of
Harold Wells, an uncommitted
delegate from lowa, who said in
addition to repeated calls from a
regular Carter delegate watcher,
l irst Lady Rosalynn Carter tele
phoned on his birthday last
Wednesday.

NEW YORK — President
Jimmy Carter overwhelmed Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
yesterday in their bitter fight
over the delegate loyalty rule at
the Democratic National Con
vention, and Kennedy im
mediately ended his challenge to
Carter's renomination.
"The effort on the nomination
is over," declared a dejected
Kennedy. "My name will not be
placed in nomination.''
The swift and dramatic end to
Kennedy's 10-month battle
against the incumbent president
came after Carter used the full
power of his office to preserve
the delegate strength that he had
compiled in 35 primaries and 2 1
state caucuses.

Only three hours after the
opening gavel fell, the conven
tion voted. 1936.4 to 1390.6
(with four delegates not voting)
to support Carter on the loyalty
rule. The provision, which hinds
all delegates to vote on the first
ballot for the candidate to whom
they were pledged when elected,
had become the decisive test of
strength between Carter and
Kennedy.
Since Carter had won almost
2000 delegate votes — about
270 more than the 1666 needed
for nomination — adoption of
the rule assured the president's
renomination by the convention
tomorrow night, even if Ken
nedy had not withdrawn.
Smiling faintly, Kennedy said,
"1 am gratified by the support I
received on the rules fight to

night — but not quite as gratified
as President Carter." His sup
porters reacted to his atempt at
humor with silence and Kennedy
continued in a monotone, not
smiling. "President Carter's
forces have won an impressive
victory this evening," he said.
"And I am a realist and I know
what this result means. I have
called President Carter and con
gratulated him."
Kennedy said nothing directly
about whether he would support
Carter in the fall campaign, but
he hinted that much would de
pend on the final shape of the
party platform.
"The efforts for Democratic
principles must and will con
tinue" he said, calling on dele
gates to help him work for "A
truly Democratic platform."
The senator, who already has
won concessions from the Carter
camp on the wording of several
planks, is scheduled to address
the convention today. He is ex
pected to concentrate on
economic issues in hope of build
ing support for his proposal for
wage and price controls and a
$12 billion jobs program — both
issues on which Carter forces
have thus far refused to com
promise.
Rep. Michael Barnes (D-
Md.), a leader of the movement
for the so-called open conven
tion, hurried to congratulate the
Carter forces on their victory and
said he believed a majority of
"open convention" delegates
would back Carter for re
election in the fall.
As debate on the rule moved
toward its emotion-charged end
