# Stanford grad navigates KRON-TV to success
## 
### Edward Asiano Staff Writer 
The date was February 1.
1980. Three unions had just
struck KRON-TV. and Francis
A. Martin 111 was preparing for a
light. KRON is his baby and he
was determined it would not get
hurt.
Martin is the young, tough
Vice President and Station Man
ager of KRON. He is the ban
kroll behind the station's "com
mitment to quality," and the
backing is substantial.
Known as Rani to nearly
everyone, Martin, 37, is a prog
eny of the Thieriot family, own
ers of KRON, the San Francisco
Chronicle, and other cablc and
television stations. The family is
one of the oldest, wealthiest and
most prestigious in the Bay area.
It runs a family business kept in
the family.
When the three unions, the
American Federation of Televi
sion and Radio Artists
(AFTRA), the International
Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers (IBEW) and Office and
Professional Employees (OPE)
walked out, Martin was in for the

fight of his life. Describing him
self as a thoughtful competitor,
he said, "1 don't like confronta
tion, unless it's on my own
terms."
A tall, slender redhead, Mar
tin's boyish good looks belie his
age and are punctuated by inten
sive eyes shining from a round,
ruddy face.
Martin dressed in clothes one
employee described as "looking
like old money." He wears sus
penders and a banker's conser
vatism that he feels is a throw
back to the old "Front Page"
journalistic days. It was no won
der that a group of co-workers
during the strike were surprised
to see him dumping waste paper.
Although long regarded as the
most conservative Bay area tele
vision station, KRON is not af
raid to commit large amounts of
money to local programming.
This approach has spawned such
critically acclaimed programs as
the "Treasures of Tutankha
mun," and the "Politics of
Poison."
KRON's Newscenter 4 has
also received the dollar treat
ment; however it has yet to be re

spond. In a market where local
news ratings make or break a
station's reputation, Newseenter
4 has been a disappointment — it
remains last in the ratings. This
has been a source of distress for
Martin, but he expects the audi
ence will come around.
"There is a proper, approp
riate, thorough way to do TV
news, and that's the way we in
tend to do it."he said.
KRON has pirated a long list
of top talents from its San Fran
cisco competitors. Valerie Col
man, Evan White, Rollin Post,
Barry Tompkins (who has since
left), Joyce Shank, Tony Conig
liaro and David Fowler have all
joined the ranks at channel 4.
Managers have also been brought
in. significantly improving the
promotion, sales and news eche
lons. There are smirks on the
faces at KRON. One of KGO
TV's top salesmen has defected,
and KRON is expecting to get
another station's highly regarded
No. 2 sportscaster.
"This is the station that's on
the move," asserts Martin. Many
in the local industry agree, but
the recent strike clouded its ac
complishments.
Charges of "union busting"
and worse circulated; the unions,
thinking Martin an easy target, a
blueblood. found out differently.
Don Tayer, a spokesman for
AFTRA said, "to the extent
(Martin) was involved in the
negotiations, he was a formida
ble adversary."
The three-month strike ended
clearly in KRON's favor.
Though AFTRA, representing
the valuable on-air talent, re
ceived almost everything they
asked for, IBEW returned to the
same contract they had been of
fered before striking. OPE never
did return, and many members
lost their jobs.
"Our employees had a perfect
and absolute right to go on
strike, but once they did. our re
sponsibilities were to operate the
station and not to them," Martin
said.

He thinks job competition is
vital, and says insulation from
dismissal or discipline provides
little incentive for performance.
"We had some employees who
had crossed (into) . . . the insu
lated world of career protection.
I think the strike had a lot to do
toward changing that," Martin
said.
Tayer said Martin's philosophy
"is totally outmoded. I don't
think people perform well or
badly because of whether or not
they arc threatened with dismis
sal. 1 think that's the way you
deal with children."
Martin attributes his well
defined ideas on the broadcast
industry to his Stanford educa
tion. "Stanford has had a most
profound influence on my val
ues, views and certainly abilities,
such as they are." he said. He
thinks, •"there are probably two
great schools in America, one is
Harvard, and one is Stanford . . .
it's just world class."
Somewhat hesitant about
speaking of himself. Martin's
voice lowers noticeably. He went
to boarding school in the Hast for
eight years, and still retainsa hint
of a Massachusetts accent. After
a stint in the Marine Corps, he
emerged with a strong sense of
discipline, and everything about
him shows it. Says Martin. "1
don't think I have blinders on . . .
I want to be able to shuck and
jive in the world of TV as it is
necessary."
Martin swam competitively,
and enjoys skiing and scuba div
ing. "My golf game tends to be a
nature walk," he says. He also
"loves" dove and duck shooting,
and when interviewed, was wear
ing a pair of his grandfather's
antique suspenders, depicting
hunting scenes.
Rani is not a name he is fond
of. He said he got it as a young
boy when a nurse began calling
him "little Frannie." His mother
objected, and said "we'll call him
Rani." 'The only other time I've
ever seen it spelled like that

was when I was driving along
Broadway (street in San Fran
cisco) and on the marquee of a
strip joint, it said 'Rani Martin
dances topless tonight,'" he said.
Martin sees his role as station
manager, "as a sifter of input, a
galvanizer of ideas, and a
motivator of people. The key to
any success is going to be judg
ment," he said. "Any idea that
I'm sitting in some ivory tower,
just throwing darts at a decision
hoard and trying to exercise
power is wonderful in a novel,
hut isn't the way one operates."
Described by one of his former
professors here, Dick Block, as
"tough, bright and aggressive,"
Martin uses three different
words, and chooses them care
fully. Pausing with his head back,
deliberating, he offers,
"thoughtful, sensitive and de
termined."
"I'd like to have our competi
tion reacting to us, rather than
our reacting to them. You can
achieve a dominance of a com
petitive situation by being discip
lined, and being thoughtful, and
being determined," he said.
That is how Francis A. Martin
111 runs his life, and his television
station — and the competition
better look out.
