## concerts /dean eyre Benson goes far with 'this here guitar' 
### 
Just as the lyrics for his encore
number "On Broadway"
exclaim. George Benson played
"this here guitar" at the Circle
Star Theater Friday night. What
stole the show wasn't so much
Benson's musicianship, hut
rather his energetic and dramatic
voice. Put the two together and
you've got the reason for his
1976 album Breezin' going
platinum — the first jazz LP to
earn that distinction.
Complimenting Benson's
one-two punch was a nine-piece
band which performed his hits as
artistically as you'll hear any
where. Before introducing the
members of his band, Benson
boasted. "As usual, I've brought
the finest musicians 1 could
find"; over the course of the
hour-and a half-long set. the
group lived up to this praise.
At the heart of his accompan
iment were Ronnie Foster on
synthesizer. Randy Walman on
piano, guitarist Phil Upchurch.
drummer Tony Lewis, bassist
Banks and Vicki Randall on per
cussion and vocals.
With the inclusion of a trio of
musicians on alto and tenor sax.
flutes and trumpet. Benson's
current live sound allows for
more diversity without diluting
his jazz/pop roots.
Benson's entourage took to
the Circle Star's revolving stage,
becoming the largest jazz music

box for two shows. While playing
cuts from his last four releases,
the most recent album Give Me
The Night was featured. Num
bers off this Ouincy Jones pro
duction were the title cut,
"Moody's Mood," "Dinorah,
Dinorah," and "Love X Love."
Benson sincerely touted Jones'
behind-the-scene talent, noting
that he has been responsible for
arranging recordings with tre
mendous success for The
Brothers Johnson and Michael
Jackson among others.
Randall, a Bay area talent,
traded all-too-brief solos with
Benson on "Moody's Mood,"
and joined Foster for the back
up vocals on "Love X Love."
After acknowledging Randall's
talented voice, Benson re
sponded to the appreciative
applause by kidding that next
time he might be on tour with
her; although it was obviously
Benson's party, working in more
of Randall's vocals would be
quite a treat.
" Moody's Mood" began life as
"I'm In The Mood For Love," a
popular standard of several de
cades ago, before being renamed
when James Moody recorded his
version of it. Benson's rendering
is well arranged, but the mod
ified be-bop style isn't his forte.
Benson was at his very best on
the ballad-like arrangements of
"The Greatest Love of All," for

the Muhammed Ali movie
bioraphy The Greatest, and few
contemporary singers could
touch his performance of "This
Masquerade," the Leon Russell
composition from Breezin'-
Another definitive Benson
performance was "Lady Blue"
off his second Warner album In
[■'light, released in 1977 (and on
Weekend in L.A. from 1978).
Also penned by Russell. "Lady
Blue" was appropriately accom
panied by soft purple-blue over
head lights, evoking a romantic
atmosphere.
After playing Benson's cur
rent hit "Give Me The Nitrht."

the stage came to a stop and the
group walked briskly up the aisle
to the dressing room.
Returning to the stage, Ben
son said, "I think you know this
one," and the band went into the
telltale riff of "On Broadway,"
eliciting steady clapping
throughout the encore. After a
second standing ovation, the
combo departed for good, leav
ling an air of electricity in the
arena.
