# And at the Keystone last weekend.. . .
## concerts'/shelly stevenson Garcia pleases his faithful followers 
### 
There is something to be said
for pure, unadulterated devo
tion. Who else but a Jerry Garcia
fan would line up at noon on a
hot Saturday, eight hours before
the doors open at the Keystone,
Palo Alto, and then wait pa
tiently, warm body to body, until
after 11 p.m. to actually hear him
play.
As one who has always re
mained on the fringes of the
Grateful Dead/Garcia mystique,
I stand in awe of such dedication.
But it is a special event to see a
living legend in a cozy nightclub
setting like the Keystone. As a
major box-office draw, cult-hero
Garcia could pack 'em in almost
anywhere, even Frost Am
phitheater. But out of respect for
his fans, one must suppose, he
continues to play at places like
the Keystone.
Faithful fans
Garcia's fans, are, of course,
what it's all about. To see so
many people attuned to, and un
conditionally enjoying, the
magic of one artist is a genuine
pleasure.
Saturday night's was a unique
crowd, too. It reminds me of a
Friday night in that organic Mex
ican food place in Santa Cruz:
lots of long hair and Grateful
Dead tee-shirts. Do you have
any idea how many styles those
shirts comc in? There were also a
few Jerry Garcia ones too. And,
oh yes, the Hell's Angels were
also well-represented at Satur
day night's festivities, as well.
Happy Faces
The crowd was not quite as
euphoric as I expected. There
were, however, many glazed
eyes and happy faces. Once Jerry
Garcia and his band came
onstage, there was spontaneous

dancing every where there was
space (ergo no Daily photos).
Grey hair in his long beard, the
hudgy patriarch ot the Grateful
Dead empire does look gentle
and magnanimous. And the
man's music speaks for itself.
The distinct voice and flowing,
sustaining guitar are clearly the
foundation of the better Grateful
Dead sound. Jerry Garcia's place
in rock 'n' roll history has long
been assured.
Mellowness first
Garcia and company played a
short, languid first set. Mellow
music for a mellow, loving
crowd. Opening with the
crowd-pleasing "Sugaree,"
other numbers included "Catfish
John" and an acceptable rendi
tion of "Tangled Up In Blues."
Between sets, the Hell's
Angels contingency entertained
a handful by firing up those
lovely bikes, signalling their de
parture outside the entrance of
the club.
A second set brought up the
tempo with several lively num
bers ranging from gutsy blues to
reggae. The band performed a
leisurely, catchy version of
Jimmy Cliffs "The Harder They
Come." Their version of the
Beatles' "Dear Prudence" was
the most energetic, danceable
tune of all. "Mission In The
Rain." from Garcia's ac
complished Reflections lp was
noteworthy as well.
\ step back
Though 1 cannot safely vouch
for the Hell's Angels, the best
part of the evening was the fact
that no one left unhappy. It was
almost like a step back into gol
den pre-inflation/gas crunch
times. And the ambience was 90
percent of the fun.
