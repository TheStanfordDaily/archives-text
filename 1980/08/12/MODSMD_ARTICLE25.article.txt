## With Tazmanian Devils rock's future plays today 
### 
The crowd was pretty sparse at
the Keystone Palo Alto Friday
night, I must say.
Perhaps because cult-hero
Jerry Garcia played there Satur
day, people who might otherwise
have come to check out the Taz
manian Devils stayed home.
Then again, maybe they heard
TV's "Dallas" was going to be
especially good that night. It's a

shame, too. These guys put on
just the sort of refreshingly
hyperactive, get-up-and-dance
performance that makes you
think rock'n'roll's got a promis
ing future after all.
Their debut album on Warner
Brothers Records, released last
spring, was generally well re
ceived by critics; it's not bad

stuff. But the Devils' strengths
are not recognized so well on
vinyl; you have to see them live
to really appreciate what they
can do. And when they get hot,
they'll knock your proverbial
socks right off.
Coming out with their "hit,"
"Feel Alright," it was with their
second song that the Devils in
stantly drew most of the crowd to

the dance floor. And there they
remained through both of Friday
night's sets.
These guys play an appealing
mixture of pop, reggae and new
wave songs, nearly all of which
are great dance material. They
also throw in a few surprises.
Where else, for instance, would
you hear "Who Do You Love,"

"Twist the Night Away," "Pres
sure Drop" and Buddy Holly's
"Not Fade Away" all in one
show? (Hint: not Jerry Garcia).
The Devils' ability to cross
over into these different types of
music is reflected in the diversity
of their audience. Far from a
homogeneous crowd, Friday's
audience was a peculiar mix: a
few squealing teens, a few nicely
dressed couples in their early
2()'s, a few overweight post-30-
ites and even a few real new wav
ers.
(A good time was had by all.)
Dennis Hogan is everything a
lead singer should be. He dances
around on stage like the best of
them, and his voice stands up
remarkably well to a whole night
of singing.
Keyboardist Pat Craig's tricks
with his different sunglasses
were cute for awhile, but he
should stick to his music. What
theTazmanian Devils don't need
is another Elton John.
1 really like the way lead
guitarist David Carlson plays; his
slow, bouncing solos make him
the quintessential pop guitar
man, even though he looks like
he's bored out of his mind on
stage.
Drummer Barry Lowenthal
and bassist Duane van Demen
make up a strong rhythm section,
though van Demen's part was
mixed in a little too loud for
some of Friday's show, particu
larly the reggae numbers.
Overall, it was a good show,
though some of the songs, par
ticularly towards the middle of
the show, were too long. Good
pop songs, it seems, are better
short and to the point than long
and drawn out. All of them,
however, were masterpieces
when set against the monoton
ous noise that emanated from the
1970's doldrum-rock warm up
band Sneezer.
Onward into the '80s.
