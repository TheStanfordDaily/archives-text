## Schlock like you have never seen before 
### 
The Final Countdown, now at
the Palo Alto Square, is as bad a
movie as I have ever seen.
Period. That is the least derogat
ory statement I can make about
this film. It is such utterly worth
less schlock that it makes Hangar
18. July's "Trash Movie of the
Month," look like Citizen Kane.
Here's the plot. The U.S.S.
Nimitz, a nuclear-powered air
craft carrier, encounters a time
warp during flight exercises in
the Pacific, which sends the ship
and its crew back to December 6,
1941, the day before the
Japanese attack on Pearl Har
bor. While debating whether to
change the course of history, the
crew picks up the survivors of a
Japanese attack on a yacht â€” to
wit. a senator and his lovely
young legislative assistant.
The movie plods along while
we watch the ship's captain (Kirk
Douglas), his executive officer
(Ron O'Neal), a fighter pilot
(James Farentino) and a civilian
systems analyst (Martin Sheen)
while they mull over their predi
cament. On and on they tedi
ously drone about changing his
tory; the pharmacological uses of
this soporific footage should be
investigated.
Finally, Douglas orders his
planes aloft to engage the
Japanese and we hope for some
good action. But, wouldn't you
know it.the mischievous time
warp zaps them all back to the
present, leaving history just the

way it was. What a rip-off.
Of course, we have seen this
plot dozens of times before, usu
ally on television. Even the time
warp itself is reminiscent of the
old TV show "The Time Tun
nel." There should be no trouble
deciding what to do; everybody
knows that you can't change his
tory. Even Mr. Peabody and
Sherman knew enough only to
facilitate the occurence of his
tory as we know it.and Mr. Pea
body was only a cartoon dog!
Instead we get Martin Sheen
discussing the paradox of reverse
time travel. You know, how can
you go back and alter the course
of events to preclude your birth
w hen your existence is presuma
bly a prerequisite to your going
back in time in the first place.
Anyone who read any science
fiction while in the sixth grade is
very familiar with this little logi
cal somersault. We need some
one articulate like Bertrand Rus
sell to deal with these problems,
but all we get is a twit systems
analyst.
Sheen grins like an idiot and
says "black holes and anti
matter" as though it were a
magic incantation. (What has
anti-matter to do with it any
way?) And. of course. Sheen is
obligated to intone the name of
Einstein, who "proved in
theory" that you could travel
backwards in time. Nonsense!
Einstein never proved any such
damn thing! Whv is it that everv

one of Einstein's frivolous rumi
nations finds its way into bad
movies?
The acting in this movie stinks,
by the way. The principal actors
walk through their roles like
zombies. They were probably
wishing they were making
another movie elsewhere. (I was
wishing the same.) Only Sheen
displays life and he does that
every five minutes when he sh
outs, "Hey, what's going on
here?", much like a well-trained
dog barks to the command

"speak." I wonder how many
bones it took to train Sheen.
Since the plot and the main
characters can't keep our in
terest. Katherine Ross is put in to
cheer us up a bit. Her acting is as
abominable as everyone else's,
but she smiles or looks longingly
at the camera often enough to
keep the boys happy. At one
point she says "Shall we, Cap
tain?" meaning "Shall we
leave?" (I should have) but the
audience reads sex into the invi
tation. Every teenage male in the

theatre moaned in pubescent
ecstasy.
Left-to carry the movie by it
self, the Nimitz fails valiantly.
Footage of jets and helicopters
taking off and flying around are
interesting for a while. A short
while. Only an air traffic control
ler or Ronald Reagan could sit
through all the scenes of military
hardware without getting bored.
For all their flying around the
jets don't do anything. But then,
why should they, nothing else in
the movie does.
