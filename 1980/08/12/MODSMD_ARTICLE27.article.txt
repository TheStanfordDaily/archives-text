## McQueen is back with more good old fashioned action 
### 
Steve McQueen is finally back
after a long absence from the
screen. Last month he missed
with Tom Horn, a turgid soap
opera of a Western depicting the
fall of a bounty hunter who has
outlived his era.
McQueen's latest, The
Hunter, is also about an anac
hronistic bounty hunter, but in
stead of maudlin character study,
only a few chuckles are mined
from the anachronisms. The rest
of the film is good old-fashioned
action. That never gets old.
McQueen is "Papa" Ralph
Thorson, a bounty hunter who
works out of L.A. He's the best
in his profession, so he gets the
toughest jobs from a bail
bondsman (Eli Wallach). His
quarries include two brothers
with a penchant for throwing
sticks of dynamite and a well
armed maniac riding Chicago's
mass transit system. The later
episode includes a great chase
sequence which begins across
tenement roofs and ends in a
parking garage.

McQueen walks through his
role as well as he walks through
all his roles. His steely gaze bet
raysthe apparent mortality of his
character, yet his failures are ac
companied by expressions of
good-humored acceptance. As
usual, Wallach, as a somewhat
seedy fellow in a somewhat
seedy business, offers a gem of a
performance. The remaining
performers do their jobs but the
nature of the film precludes any
thing worthy of comment. There
is only the bounty hunter and his
quest; the latter is faceless and
his only purpose is to create
trouble for the former.
Whenever a movie has as
episodic a plot as The Hunter,
directors and scriptwriters be
come obsessed with creating a
theme to hold the film together.
In this film, the connecting
thread is the eccentric character
of Papa Thorson. The scenes be
tween the action sequences are
the weakest segments of the film
although they occasionally pro
vide comic relief.

The filler that works has to do
with Thorson's distaste for any
thing new. He drives a '51
Chevy, or tries to. Parallel park
ing is an art unknown to Thor
son, and his miserable attempts
at it are rather funny. Curbs and
parked cars are used as tactile
navigational aids instead of abso
lute boundaries. Thorson with a
rented sports car is the
metaphorical child with a loaded
gun.
The filler that doesn't work is
centered around Thorson's rela
tionship with his pregnant
schoolteacher girlfriend. All of
these scenes have an unbelieva
ble ring. There is nothing bet
ween these two; they look like
actors who have never met be
fore.
Of course, there is no reason
for filler in The Hunter. We don't
need or want any character study
because we know what sort of
character Thorson is going to be;
characters in action movies are
all the same. We arc as familiar
with them as we are with Santa
Claus or Sherlock Holmes. De
velopment of such a character is
pointless. We would all be much
happier with more violence.
Another small thing that
bothered me about The Hunter is
that it is supposed to be a true
story. This is absolutely unbe
lievable. It seems that everyone
in Hollywood has lost the ability
to distinguish fact from fantasy.
People don't live the lives of
stock Hollywood characters.
Thank God.
