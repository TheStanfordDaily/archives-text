# Nicklaus' putting wins the PGA
## 
### Mark Asher The Washington Post 
ROCHESTER, N Y. — Jack
Nicklaus faced just one crucial
putt Sunday on the way to his
seven-stroke victory for his
record-tying fifth PGA champ
ionship. It was 13 feet lon>> for a
saving par at the eighth hole. I le
had no doubt he would make it.
He stroked the ball into the
cup to retain a five-shot lead at
that point over Lon Hinkle, who
had just run in a 30-foot birdie
putt. A two-stroke swing there
could have made this final day at
Oak Hill a challenge instead of a
ho-hum finish to his 19th career
major championship.
The seven-stroke margin was
the widest in this tournament's
history and the biggest gap bet
ween winner and runner-up in a
major championship since Ben
Hogan also scored by seven shots
in the 1953 British Open at Car
dustie. The victory, worth
$60,000 and increasing
Nicklaus' season earnings to
$1 72,3c56, caps a comeback from
a two-year slump that started
when he won this year's U.S.
Open.
At 40, Nicklaus has reformed
his golf game. After tips from
Phil Rodgers on his wedge play
and old-time teacher Jack Gr
out, he says his game is better
now than a decade ago when he
allegedly was in his prime. When
he putts as he did here, with 2-T
one-putt greens in the final
rounds, no one can touch him.
Nicklaus shot 70-69-66-69 -
274 over the 6964-yard course,
with Andy Bean's 70 giving him
sole possession of second place
at 281, one over par. Gil Morgan
(72 —283) and Lon Hinkle
(75 —283) were the only other
competitors less than I 0 strokes
behind over the classic, re
vamped East Course here.
"I don't think Jack's score re
flected how hard the golf course
was," said Bean. "It didn't make
a difference how tall the rough
was here; he wasn't in the
rough."
" 1 haven't played better in the
four major championships than I
have this year," said Nicklaus.
"Oak Hill is considerably
tougher than when we played
(the U.S. Open) here in 1968. If
I played and putted like I did this
week, I might have broken 270."
Ironically, he tied Walter Ha
gen's mark of five victories in the

PGA championship in Hagen's
hometown. Nicklaus said it likely
would not have happened with
out a putting tip given him Mon
day at his Muirfield Village
course in Ohio by his 18-year
old son. Jack. The younger
Nicklaus discovered his father
was breaking off his putting
stroke early. The tip did wonders
after the first round in which he
said he struck the ball well
enough to shoot 65, but used 33
putts in scoring par 70.
On Friday, Nicklaus played
what he described as the worst
round of his career, as far as
striking the ball was concerned,
yet turned nine one-putt greens
into one-under-par 69.
He also had nine one-putt
greens in shooting his 66 — best
round of the tournament —
Saturday. Sunday he had only
six. but he was playing semicon
servatively from tee to green and
managed to save par four of the
five times he missed the green in
regulation.
"1 putted very, very well," he
said. "I didn't even make that
many when 1 was not hitting the
ball well 10 years ago and some
time winning. The funny thing
was — I walked up to the putts
and 1 knew I was going to make
them. Like the putt at 18 Satur
day night. I knew I was going to
make that putt. A lot of people
weren't too sure, but I was sure."
For the record, Nicklaus mis
sed 17 greens in his final three
rounds. His recovery shots left
him 13 makeable putts and he
dropped 1 1 of them — four from
13-15 feet, six from 4-12 feet
and three under three feet. He
missed from five and six feet.
"That's why 1 shot what I shot.
Had I missed the normal percen
tage of the saving putts, it would
have been a tournament that
anybody could have now."
Instead Nicklaus won by se
ven, topping the previous PGA
Championship record of
four held by himself and Al
Geiberger. No one has won the
U.S Open or the PGA by more
shots since Jim Barnes beat
runner-up Fred McLeod at Col
umbia Country Club in Chevy
Chase, MD„ by nine in 1921.
Indeed, the scene on the final
hole was ironic. Bean, the
runner-up, played safely for a
bogey 5 in order to protect his
three-stroke lead over Hinkle
and Morgan for second place.
