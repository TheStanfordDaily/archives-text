# Athletic officials 'embarrassed'

Officials at the Los Angeles
universities affected by yester
day's Pacific-10 conference dis
qualification ruling reacted
apologetically to the decision
that eliminated their football
teams from the Rose Bowl race.
UCLA Athletic Director
Robert Fischer said he deeply
regretted the embarrassment
that the scandal brought upon his
football team and the commun
ity. He called the Pac-10 penal

ties very severe.
He said the transgressions for
which his school is now being
punished occured in past years
and such violations could not
occur under the system presently
used at UCLA.
UCLA football coach Terry
Donahue, head coach at the time
of the academic irregularities,
said he was "embarrassed that
the academic integrity of UCLA

has been questioned."
Donahue added that he ex
pected the Bruins to play "hard,
competitive football," and that
he hoped that the other
penalized teams would do the
same.
A USC spokesperson, whose
team was also disqualified, said
"we're disappointed, but we
have every intention of making
this the best season possible."

seldom, however, as Nicklaus managed to stay out of the hazards for most of the tournament.
