# GSB targeted for energy program
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
Plans have been completed for
the retrofit of the Graduate
School of Business (GSB) to
make it more energ> efficient.
The engineers at Taylor Sys
tems Engineering, the company
hired to conduct an energy audit
of the GSB. estimate that the
project will cost in the vicinity of
$368,000 and will pay for itself
within 2Vi years.
William Macomber. Stanford
project engineer, said savings in
1980-91 should total SI 10.000.
And these figures do not even
take into account the $125,000
which the Department of Energy
is providing for the project
through its Schools and Hospi
tals Grant Program.
Lynda Weisberg. Stanford's
energy program manager, said
that steam and chilled water
meters installed at the GSB in
February, 1980 will make it pos
sible to compare energy con
sumption before and after the
retrofit.
She said the meter readings
will also be used to estimate cost
savings. A portion of the money
saved in reduced energy con

sumption will he put into a fund
to be used for a planned series of
retrofits on campus.
"The GSB project is a pro
totype for a series of building
energy projects," Weisberg said.
"Sixteen other buildings are in
various stages of being studied or
worked on."
The law school and Terman
Center are scheduled for re
trofits in the near future.
In Macomber's words, "the
GSB project reflects a new ap
proach to energy conservation at
Stanford."
Taylor Systems expects the re
trofit will cut steam at the GSB
90 percent, chilled water 54 per
cent, and electricity 45 percent.
James Trowbridge, the Taylor
employee in charge of the GSB
retrofit, said these drastic reduc
tions will be possible because the
current heating and cooling sys
tem wastes tremendous amounts
of energy. Outside air is drawn in
to be heated and cooled and then
is mixed to create the desired
temperature.
Macomber predicts that con
struction will begin in August or
September.
