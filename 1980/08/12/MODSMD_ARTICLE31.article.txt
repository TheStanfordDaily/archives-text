# Student publicly resists the draft in Chicago
## 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
Matt Nicodemus, a Stanford
undergraduate, publicly an
nounced at a press conference in
Chicago his refusal to register for
the draft.
The declaration, which was
also made in the local newspap
ers in his hometown of Evanston,
Illinois, has led to television and
radio talk shows, news coverage,
and more press conferences,
some nationally broadcast.
"1 just can't see giving my
name to a system that I'm in
complete disagreement with,"
the 20-year-old sophomore said.
Though the publicity is good
for his cause and for the organi
zation he founded and leads,
Evanston Against Registration
and the Draft, Nicodemus is
convinced that it will inevitably
land him in jail.
"I'm reconciled to the fact that
I will be prosecuted," he said. He
added that the government will
be using public resisters as an
example.
"I'll probably be in prison
about two years.
"By publicly resisting, people

will see us as logical, rational
people who made this decision.
It will force others to stop and
think and question. And it will
give those of draft age moral
support; they'll know they're not
alone," Nicodemus explained.
His organization released fi
gures showing that 30 percent of
the 20-year-olds in Chicago that
were supposed to register did
not. he said.
Nicodemus said he thought
"for a long time" before making
his decision, starting when the
first registration bills were enter
ing Congress in April. He visited
the Chicago Metropolitan Cor
rectional Center to "get an idea
of what a federal prison is like.
"I don't think of this (prison)
so much as a possible interrup
tion in my life as a change," he
said. "I'm frightened of going to
jail, but I'm more frightened of
the possibilities of a draft and

war.
Nicodemus, who is living with
his parents, said "I'm sure they
wish 1 hadn't taken the hard line
stance that 1 have, but they
realize that this is something I
I eel I have to do, anil are very
supportive."
When asked "Are you proud
of your son?" on a Chicago even
ing news show, newspaper colum
nist Charles Nicodemus said,
"Well, it's not like he's running
away from anything; he's stand
ing up to fight a battle that other
people are running away from."
Nicodemus noted that the
press has also been very en
couraging. "They clapped for us
when I finished reading my
statement . . . Even Walter
Cronkite began speaking of re
sistance as the"in thing' to do."
He hopes to return to Stanford
in the fall to study music, physics,
and philosophy.
