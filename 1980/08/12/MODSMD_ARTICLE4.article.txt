## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie warned Friday that if
America's allies "step in where the United States and American
corporations have stood aside," their action will constitute a
breach of confidence and may undermine the strength of those
alliances.
Muskie's speech to the World Affairs Council and Common
wealth Club in San Francisco challenged all industrial democ
racies to bear their share of "common burdens" like the recent
Soviet agression in Afghanistan and terrorism in Iran.
The improved political and economic stature of our allies has
brought about an end to American domination, the secretary said,
but "our allies must accept the growing responsibility that comes
with growing strength."
He especially challenged NATO forces to make good their
pledge of an annual 3 percent increase on defense spending.
Although Muskie's speech preceded a conciliatory meeting
with families of the 52 American held hostage in Iran, he did not
specifically speak of the hostages in his address to more than 900
people in Hearbst Theater. Instead, he addressed broader areas of
foreign policy like arms controls, and repeatedly called for ratifi
cation of SALT 11.
"Afghanistan unquestionably has made the task of ratification
harder. It has not made it one iota less important to our national
interest, nor one iota less critical to maintaining our common
strategy of East-West relations with our allies."
Muskie did say that after 90 days at his post, he has gained "a
strong impression of the needs to coordinate" the different
cabinet positions, because so many of them affect foreign policy.
