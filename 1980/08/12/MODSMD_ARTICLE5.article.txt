## Suicide guide held back 
### Nhoreen Johnson The Associated Press 
LONDON â€” Britain's
euthanasia society "Exit" an
nounced yesterday it would not
publish a guide on how to kill
yourself after being ad\ ised that
publication might land its offi
cials in jail.
At a somber news conference,
executives of the 45-year-old
society declared that the decision
meant "tragedy and continued
distress and personal suffering"
tor thousands of incurably ill
people longing for death.
Last tall, the group, called
"Exit. The Society for the Right
to Die with Dignity." announced
plans to publish a 30-page,
$11.50 guide for people who
wanted to know how to kill
themselves.
The booklet, written with the

help of two lawyers and a doctor,
outlined four bloodless methods
of suicide, including specific in
structions on fatal overdoses of
pills available without prescrip
tion at drug stores.
Exit officials abandoned their
plans, however, when lawyers
ad\ ised that they could be prose
cuted. and that the professionals
who helped draw up the booklet
risked losing the right to prac
tice.
The guide was intended
primarily for the painfully and
incurably ill and aged persons
who are incapacitated.
The society had said that the
booklet would be sold only to
members of three month's dura
tion. conceding that such a rule
was scant precaution against its
being acquired by the healthy in
despair, including the impulsive.
