JERUSALEM — Bluntly and
unequivocally, Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin has
formally put Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat on notice that all of
Jerusalem is going to remain
under Israel's sovereignty
forever, and that Jewish settle
ments in the occupied West
Bank will never be removed.
In a manifesto that implicitly
rules out any possibility of Israel
agreeing to negotiate those is
sues. Begin urged Sadat to put
aside his differences and renew
Egyptian-Israeli discussions on
the broader topic of proposed
autonomy for the 1.2 million
Arab inhabitants of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Begin s rebuff to Sadat was
contained in a 14-page letter re
sponding to the Egyptian presi
dent's decision last week to sus
pend the autonomy negotiations
because of the adoption by Is
rael's parliament of a law per
petuating Israeli sovereignty
over all of Jerusalem, including
the eastern sector captured by
Israel in the 1967 war. The let
ter. written last Monday, was re
leased yesterday by the Israeli
Foreign Ministry.
Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia
seems to be signaling its readi
ness to restore Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat to the Arab
fold.
The Saudi foreign minister

Sunday told Persian Gulf news
paper Al-Bayan that "We are
making efforts to bring Egypt
back into the Arab camp because
we consider its defection from it
as a great victory for Israel."
The Saudi initiative follows
one by King Hassan of Morocco,
who promised Sadat that, if he
would take a firm stand on
Jerusalem, Hassan would try to
restore him to Arab favor.
It is unlikely that Sadat will
meet the minimum requirements
of the Saudis, indulgent though
they may be, without anything
less than what the Israelis would
interpret as a repudiation of the
Camp David accords.
Coming at a time when rela
tions between the two countries
are more strained than they have
been since the 1978 Camp David
peace accords, Begin s letter to
Sadat appeared to foreclose any
likelihood of an early resump
tion of the autonomy talks.
While the letter broke no new
ground on Begin's positions on
Jerusalem or West Bank settle
ments, it dispelled rumors that
Begin had embarked on a con
ciliatory tack and had informed
Sadat that Jerusalem was negoti
able in principle. There had been
widespread reports in the Israeli
and foreign press — never offi
cially discouraged by the gov
ernment — that Begin had of
fered Sadat a face-saving gesture
by suggesting that the Jerusalem

issue could he a topic of discus
sion.
In contrast to those reports,
Begin's message was sharply crit
ical of Sadat, specifically, and the
Egyptian government, generally,
for injecting into the autonomy
process issues that are not
explicitly contained in the Camp
David accords.
But it was the issue of
Jerusalem for which Begin saved
his sharpest replies to Sadat. He
included in his message copies of
the controversial Jerusalem law
and his Sept. 17. 1978, letter to
President Jimmy Carter stating
Israel's position on the capital
city.
"1 have never misled you< nor
anybody else. Time and time
again I repeated that Jerusalem,
in its entirety, is the capital of
Israel, a city reunified and indi
visible for all generations,"
Begin wrote.
Acknowledging that
Jerusalem is holy to Moslems
throughout the world. Begin de
clared. "to the Jewish people
Jerusalem is not only holy, it is
their history for three millenia,
their heart, their dream, the visi
ble symbol of their national re
demption."
He labeled as a "contradiction
of terms" the notion that Hast
Jerusalem could be put under
Arab sovereignty, saying, "Two
sovereignties over one city
means its re-partition. Impossi
ble."
