GENEVA. Switzerland — Hundreds of young
women are killed in Arab countries under an an
cient code designed to protect "family honor"
against allegations of promiscuity, a United Na
tions Human Rights panel was told yesterday.
A report submitted to the "Working Group on
Slavery" alleged that victims had their "throats cut,
were buried alive, poisoned and disemboweled by
their father, their elder brother, a cousin or a paid
killer."
The report was presented by Jacqueline
Thibault, a representative of the London-based
Minority Rights Group, a private organization that
consults for the United Nations.
Thibault said the practice "claims the lives of
hundreds of young women every day."
I ler report said women are condemned for hav
ing extra-marital sex — willingly or by being raped
— "or just because they were observed exchanging
a few words with a young man and thus came under
suspicion of having more intimate relations."
Thibault, a social worker in Middle Eastern
countries for nine years, said such practices remain
a "horrifying reality" in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,
Israeli-occupied Arab territories and Saudi

Arabia.
Thibault said the practice occurs in Moslem and
Christian families and is not rooted in religion, but
dates to ancient times.
In her statement before the three-member
panel, she made no reference to the film Death of a
Princess, a two-hour dramatization of the 1977
executions of a married Saudi Arabian princess
and her commoner lover. The film prompted a
storm of criticism from Saudi Arabia earlier this
year.
But the report referred to the incident and said
the daughters of Arab townspeople and farmers
often shared the same fate.
Thibault related how in the town of Burka, on
the Israeli-occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River, a young man was detained for two weeks
after giving police the head of his sister whom he
had decapitated for offending "family honor."
She listed several other alleged cases without
specifying where they happened and without giving
the full identity of victims. All these cases had been
verified by witnesses or women who survived and
tied to Roman Catholic convents in the region or
abroad, Thilbault said. She said the countries con
cerned should enact laws to punish such crimes
against women and support educational programs.
