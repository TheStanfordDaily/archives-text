## Carter plans fall showdown 
### Maureen Santini The Associated Press 
NEW YORK — President Jimmy Carter's
strategists yesterday outlined a fall campaign
blueprint that establishes the Northeast industrial
belt as the prime site for a political showdown
between Carter and Republican nominee Ronald
Reagan.
At a pre-convention briefing, the president's
confidence in his renomination was underscored
when deputy campaign chief Tim Kraft dismissed
the challenge from Sen. Edward Kennedy and
concentrated on Carter's general election strategy
against the Republicans.
The Carter plan is to meet Reagan head-on in
the states the former California governor hopes to
emphasize — high-population areas of the indust
rial Northeast and Middle West.
Reagan believes he can carry traditionally
Democratic areas of the Northeast and upper
Midwest by running against the Carter record,
especially on the economy.
Carter plans to run on his record, Kraft told a
small group of reporters.
Kraft said both candidates will woo blue-collar
workers in the same industrial states, notably the
Great Lakes states, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
"His battleground states are our battleground
states," he said.
"We have to go after those same states," Kraft
said.

"Unfortunately most of them have Republican
governors."
Throughout the primary season and in his accep
tance speech at the Republican National Conven
tion in Detroit last month, Reagan blamed Carter
for increases in the inflation and unemployment
rates, and said the president had betrayed the
working classes that supported him in 1976.
Jack Watson, White House chief of staff, said
Carter will stress differences between him and
Reagan in his acceptance speech Thursday night.
Watson said the speech, expected to reach an
estimated 90 million television viewers, will pro
vide an opportunity for Carter to "articulate in
crystal-clear" terms what he accomplished in his
first term and what he intends to do in the next four
years.
In a foretaste of the Carter campaign this fall.
Vice President Walter Mondale told the Minnesota
delegation to the Democratic convention, meeting
in a midtown hotel, that the "best-kept secret in
America" is Carter's good record in the White
House.
At the same time, Mondale portrayed Reagan as
a dangerous candidate who would tear up the
strategic arms limitation agreement between the
United States and the Soviet Union in a dramatic
television appearance.
"Don't let a man like that anywhere near the
White House," the vice president warned. "He'sso
far to the right he's off the pavement."
