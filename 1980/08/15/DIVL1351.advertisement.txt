THE EUROPA
Toss it in the air, so breathtakingly light it seems to float onto your
bed... yet it's filled to overflowing with cloud-light, cloud-soft white
imported goosedown.
Snuggle under its warm embrace. Change cold sleepless nights into
golden hours of natural sleep—without burdensome weight.
And it works for generations to come, without a penny for PG&E.
Why settle for electronic weight and wires when you can own an
heirloom?

A New Shipment of Imported Goosedown Comforters.
