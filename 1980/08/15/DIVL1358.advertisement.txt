Whenever students want to
establish an organization or
need help with an existing
one, the Office of Student Ac
tivities (OSA) can provide
valuable information and oc
casional funding.
"We see our role as consul
tants to people trying to start
programs," said Patricia
Brandt, assistant director of
OSA.
Advice about long term
planning, gathering funds,
and publicizing is provided to
activities as small as a sym
phony carpool, or as large as a
theatrical event. There are
also special advisors for
black, Chicano and Asian
American activities.
OSA can help with inter
preting the effect of univer
sity policy decisions on any
student group and provides
guided tours of the adminis
trative maze.
To facilitate communica
tion between activities, OSA
keeps an updated list of the
250 student organizations on
campus. Each group is re
quired to register with OSA
every year.
The funding available is
"for general programs, and
mainly, for publicity and ser
vice operations costs,"
Brandt said.
Additional facilities are a
limited amount of office
space and two vehicles re
served for registered organi
zations.
