Three floors full of the world's
most worthwhile hooks
And records — thousands of them —
an extraordinary
Collection of classics at bargain
prices in fourteen
Rooms of the big green house
at the corner of
Kipling & Lytton. (You've been
driving by for yea rs,
Meaning to stop and check it out.
Now is the time!)
We re buying every good book and
record we can find
All day long, seven days a week.
The turnover is
Phenomenal: you'll never step
into the same Chimaera
Twice ... Check your own shelves -
Chances are
You have books and records then
you never look at
Any more. Those are the ones
we want. There is
No easier way to make money
when you sell, or save
It when you buy. We'll
see you soon!
