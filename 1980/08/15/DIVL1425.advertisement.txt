Tired of the old beer-blast scene? Worn out by those enervating American
brews that just don't do it for you any more? Well, maybe you should be
working in a different medium: try one of the titles from the Warner/
Elektra/Atlantic 6-pack: music brewed to the most exacting standards,
bubbling with energy and drive, music that gives you a great natural
feeling you just don't get with other so-called premium labels. Try one of
these releases - sale priced now at 5.99 each, LP or tape (7.98, 8.98 list)
- and see if you don't make the switch to the more satisfying Warner/
Elektra/Atlantic labels. It's no down-stream music: it's Tower. It's the
music - and a lot more.
