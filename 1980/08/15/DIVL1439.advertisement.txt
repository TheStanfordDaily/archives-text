Not everyone is the same, thank goodness. So
at Bank of America, we don't think our jobs should
be either.
Fortunately, we're big enough (and progressive
enough) to want college graduates with all kinds of
backgrounds. Business majors, yes. But also people
who are just interested in business.
Just what opportunities are we talking about?
• Well, you can work with urban community
leaders. Or show young entrepeneurs how to set up
a new business. Or advise California's farmers on
their growing concerns.
And what about opportunities for advancement?
That's up to you. of course. But when you show
us you're ready to move, we'll give you the chance
to prove it.
So consider Bank of America. We've got careers
you can really sink your teeth into.
