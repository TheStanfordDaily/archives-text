Carter drew applause, and
sometimes cheers, as he addres
sed the linal session of the
Democratic National Conven
tion that renominated him. Hut
many in the crowd that packed
the floor and the aisles of Madi
son Square Garden listened in
silence, a symptom of the divi
sions that lingered among
Democrats.
Carter and his renominated
campaign partner. Vice Presi
dent Walter Mondale, made the
convention finale a denunciation
ot Reagan, the Republican who
holds a sizable lead in the public
opinion polls with election day
three months away.
Accepting the Democratic
presidential nomination. Carter
said Reagan "and those who
with him have captured control
of the Republican party." have
renounced the traditions of Ab
raham Lincoln, of responsible
economic policy, and of safe and
sane arms control.
There were reminders of lin
gering Democratic disputes.
When Carter spoke ol his call for
draft registration, a chorus of
boos sounded across the conven
tion floor, until his supporters
overrode the jeers with their
applause.
Carter sought to depict
Reagan as a figure of the far
right, and a man whose presi
dency would raise nuclear risk.
"The new leaders of the Re
publican Party . . . have now
promised to launch an all-out
nuclear arms race." Carter said.
"This would negate any further
chance lot a mutual and ba
lanced reduction in nuclear
weapons.
"There can be no winners in
such an arms race — and all the
people on earth could be the los
ers." Carter said.
"The Republican nominee

advocates abandoning arms con
trol policies which have been
supported by every Democratic
president since Truman and
every Republican since
Eisenhower.
"This radical and irresponsi
ble course would threaten our
security — and could put the
whole world in peril." the presi
dent said.
Carter and Mondale came in
triumph to accept the nomina
tions ol a Democratic Party un
ited at the top but frayed at the
fringes, the president declaring
"we are going to whip the Re
publicans in November."
