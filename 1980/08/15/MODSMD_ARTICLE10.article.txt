### James Gerstenzang The Associated Press 
NEW YORK — President
Jimmy Carter, off and running
on his record while turning his
political guns on the Republi
cans, said yesterday he was look
ing forward to a fight against the
"irresponsible" GOP.
Victorious after a nine-month
Democratic Party battle, the
president, preparing to unveil his
campaign themes in a speech to
the Democratic National Con
vention yesterday night, turned a
fancy luncheon into a Democra
tic pep rally, firing salvo after
salvo at Ronald Reagan and the
Republicans.
He said the Republicans, who
try "every four years ... to put
on overalls and talk about jobs,"
will find that their "underestima
tion of the voters will bring black
wreaths and grief to Republican
halls on the night of Nov. 4,"
election night.
"We Democrats are really
ready for a fight. I'm really look
ing forward to it,"the president
told 500 people attending a
$5 00-a-person fund-raising
event for Democratic congres
sional candidates.
The president sought to close
the gap between himself and
Sen. Edward Kennedy, which
has dominated the four-day con
vention, and said "we've kept a
close, amicable relationship" de

spite some differences on
specific issues during the long
primary campaign.
"These differences have been
resolved," he said, revealing that
he had spoken with the senator
several times by telephone, al
though efforts to arrange a pri
vate meeting between the two
came to naught.
The president predicted that
the Democrats would win in
November "by waging one of the
most united, sharply defined
campaigns in the history of the
country."
"The issues are deep between
us," he said of the Republican-
Democratic clash.
Carter praised his record with
Congress as the most successful
of any Democratic president, in
cluding Franklin Roosevelt and
Lyndon Johnson, while the
minority Republicans "can be ir
responsible and they have well
fulfilled that role."
"We inherited in January
1977, a mess and we've been de
aling with it ever since," lie said.
The congressional campaign
speech, at the Plaza Hotel, was a
warmup for Carter's evening
speech accepting the Democratic
presidential nomination.
The question of patching up
differences with Kennedy, rather
than looking ahead to how Car
ter will campaign, dominated the
first three days of the conven
tion.
