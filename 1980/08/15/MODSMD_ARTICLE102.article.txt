LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it i> the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and the> are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator.
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques au.x
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with as

paragus) and Feuillete d'Huitre
au Curry (baked oyster in curry
sauce in pastry) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered.
As for the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce) was truly exceptional, of
fering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the pre
sentation of this dish.

A good cross section of de
serts include hot or cold Souffle
Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat, and selected cheeses.
LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the manv over

priced and generally second-rate
French restaurants on the penin
sula, Les Provinces has prov ed to
he one of the finer exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors d'ocuvres,
ranging in price from $3 for de
licious ham crepes to $4 for
smoked salmon and Esc argots
De Bourgoine. The Terrine
Maison a i Artnagnac was an un
flawed but unexceptional rendi
tion of home-made pate.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out-

side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and cherrv sauce
($11.25).

All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for
once, were noticeably cooked to
perfection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts arc the following
three items: Tarte au.x Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude on.x Pommes (hut
apple tart. $2); and Souffle
Grand Marnier ($3.75). The ex
cellence of the coffee was a rare
treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex

cuisine.
L'ORANGERIE

Crammed in among the peep

O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur

staurant serving classical haute
cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and ev
erthing is expensive. Frugality is
anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole du Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
(S 14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and the
Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is an
excellent side dish. Potage Pari
sien (potato and leek soup) is a
superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up to
the Souffle Grand Marnier or the
Souffle au.x Framboises ($5)
which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52.
and with beverages, tax and tip.
it was almost $80 for two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood Citv
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge. may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is

considered the appropriate attire
for men. The menu is large and
represents a well-chosen selec
tion of traditional continental re
cipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites 2 2 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis ($13.50) and Chicken
Saude with Artichokes and
Chives Jerusalem ($9.25), only
begin to suggest all the bases co
vered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95), and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direction
of owner-chef Louis Borel as a
line French restaurant serving
excellent food in a friendly and
efficient manner.
Dinnerat L'Omelette includes
soup du jour, salad, fresh veget
able du jour and potato or rice.
Also available for an extra
charge are any of the 10 appetiz
ers, onion soup gratinee, a large
array of desserts, a choice of be
verages and any selection from
the eight page wine list.
But indecision when choosing
a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the reg
ular offerings, which include
such diverse choices as Paupiette
de Sole Deauville ($9.75), fillet
of sole with creamed lobster
sauce, mushrooms and shrimp,
and Civet de Lapin, Chasseur
($8.95), rabbit, hunter's style,
L'Omelette serves a variety of
house specialties that change

daily.
Nine dessert choices range
from the traditional Chocolate
Mousse ($1.75) to the continent
— inspiring Camembert Cheese
($2). My companion decided on
the cheesecake ($.50) while 1 or
dered the house specialty. Fresh
Strawberries Romanoff
($2.75).
L'Omelette is a fine French re
staurant serving high quality
food that is consistently good
and frequently exceptional. The
food, the entertaining and atten
tive service and the warm atmos
phere all make L'Omelette an
excellent choice.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Nothing exceptional, but still
something nice.
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed. Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative to
restaurants within a similar price
range (the Good Earth and Chef
Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a serious
following. Here the display of
marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming back
for more.
Salad is included in the price of
all dinner items (with no limit on
how many times you can go back
to refill your plate), or can be
ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight en
trees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8. an exquisite
presentation of red ca\ iar, whole
artichoke, chilled smoked sal
mon, and brie cheese served with
a split of champagne. Notable
among the first group are a
cheese fondue ($<S.25 for two),
and the Middle Eastern Board
with stuffed grape leaves, feta
cheese, and pita bread available
for $5.10.
Desserts are simple and reflect
a preference for "the organic."
Strawberries and frozen yogurt
($1.75), homemade zucchini
cake ($1.25) and a fruit and
cheese board ($2.50) are all
uood choices.

TWO SISTERS CREPERIE
355 State
Los Altos
941-27H2
Two Sisters is an excellent
place to escape the noisy, hectic
world for a quiet, relaxing and
casual dinner.
The Two Sisters Creperie is a
delightful dining experience.
The service is friendly and var
ied. with the waitress, manager,
and one of the chefs all taking
part. The dinners are solid, but
the salads and the desserts are
the outstanding offerings.
The dinner menu features en
tree crepes, with other entrees —
Quiche Lorraine ($5.25) and
Crab Quiche ($5.75) — also of
fered along with a daily special
such as Leg of Lamp ($6.50) or
Prime Rib an jus ($8.50).
There are a variety of appetiz
ing salads to choose from includ
ing a large plate from the exten
sive salad bar ($3).
The entree crepes, ranging
from $5.25 to $6.25, include
choice of soup or salad bar, and
rice pilaf. A very nice feature of
the menu is that foran additional
$2 the extra hungry diner can
order a second crepe.
The desserts were works of
art. The Jamaican Pleasure
($2.25). a crepe filled with van-

ilia ice creame, banana slices
sauteed in brown sugar, butter
and rum, topped with a whipped
cream and nuts, was a tropical
dream. The Fantasy Fudge
Crepe ($2.25). a warm crepe
stuffed with \anilla ice cream
and smothered in hot fudge
sauce is a must for the sundae
fiend.

L'Auberge. may deserve the

L'Auberge is the kind of re

formal, and a jacket and tie is

considered the appropriate attire
for men. The menu is large and
represents a well-chosen selec

While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill

to keep the tab down to $30,

exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under

Some reviewers feel that the

L'Auberge is the kind of re

formal, and a jacket and tie is

considered the appropriate attire
for men. The menu is large and
represents a well-chosen selec

While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,

Entrees are organized under

Also available for an extra

Service is formal yet good

The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip

the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques au.x
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with as

paragus) and Feuillete d'Huitre
au Curry (baked oyster in curry
sauce in pastry) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered.
As for the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce) was truly exceptional, of
fering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful

LA TOUR
525 University Avenue
Palo Alto
321-6954
On the third floor of a rather
out-of-place looking building on
Universiy and Cowper is La
Tour. Quite simply, it i> the best
restaurant in Palo Alto. Many
claim it is the best restaurant on
the Peninsula, and the> are
probably right.
Once you get off the elevator.
you feel an atmosphere of
exclusivity. Happily this
exclusivity does not make the
service and food pretentious.
Service is formal yet good
natured and not oppressive; at
tentive without fawning.
The menu and its dishes are
unpretentious as well.
While the offerings are rela
tively familiar (there are only a
few surprises), menu descrip
tions are kept to a minimum so
the surprises are left for when the
dishes arrive.
And the surprises are quite
pleasant. As an hors d'oeuvre
Mousseline de Saint Jacques au.x
Pointes d'Asperges (Mousee of
scallops in lobster sauce with as

paragus) and Feuillete d'Huitre
au Curry (baked oyster in curry
sauce in pastry) are especially
nice. Four delightful soups are
offered.
As for the entrees, they are
sensational! Noisette d' Agneau
au Porto (lamb in port wine
sauce) was truly exceptional, of
fering another surprise — fois
gras in the sauce. Elegant
French-style beans and a nicely
broiled tomato give a colorful
and textural balance to the pre
sentation of this dish.

A good cross section of de
serts include hot or cold Souffle
Grand Marnier, strawberries,
hot apple tart, mousse au
chocolat, and selected cheeses.
LES PROVINCES
2620 El Camino Real
Redwood City
365-5550
In the face of the manv over

priced and generally second-rate
French restaurants on the penin
sula, Les Provinces has prov ed to
he one of the finer exceptions.
Les Provinces offers six cold
and three warm hors d'ocuvres,
ranging in price from $3 for de
licious ham crepes to $4 for
smoked salmon and Esc argots
De Bourgoine. The Terrine
Maison a i Artnagnac was an un
flawed but unexceptional rendi
tion of home-made pate.
Dinners include many tradi
tional French dishes from out-

side the Burgundy region, such
as Carre d'Agneau Dijonnaise
(rack of lamb, $26 for two) and
Canard Normande (roast duck
flamed with calvados, $21 for
two). Paupiette de Canard (stuf
fed breast of duck, $10.50), a
house specialty is outstanding.
Also recommended is Medaillon
de Veau Forestiere, veal with
mushroom and cherrv sauce
($11.25).

All entrees are served with
side dishes of fresh vegetables
and potatoes, which, for
once, were noticeably cooked to
perfection.
Standing out from the list of
eleven desserts arc the following
three items: Tarte au.x Fraises
(strawberry tart, $2.50); Tar
telette Chaude on.x Pommes (hut
apple tart. $2); and Souffle
Grand Marnier ($3.75). The ex
cellence of the coffee was a rare
treat.
Les Provinces is a dining ex
perience which can easily com
pete with San Francisco's French
cuisine.
L'ORANGERIE
419 O'Farrell
San Francisco
776-3600
Crammed in among the peep
shows and massage parlors on
O'Farrell, L'Orangerie is a sur
prisingly elegant, very French re
staurant serving classical haute
cuisine.
Everything is a la carte and ev
erthing is expensive. Frugality is
anathema to the style of
L'Orangerie. But there is no
question about the quality. The
Sole du Pas-de-Calais Mueniere
(S 14.25) and Carre de Pore a
L'Orangerie ($10.50) are espe
cially delightful entrees, and the
Asperges Hollandaise ($4) is an
excellent side dish. Potage Pari
sien (potato and leek soup) is a
superb appetizer.
The service is superb as well.
Each portion of the meal is
beautifully presented right up to
the Souffle Grand Marnier or the
Souffle au.x Framboises ($5)
which are especially good de
sserts.
Without the wine and
cocktails, our bill totaled $52.
and with beverages, tax and tip.
it was almost $80 for two. But
what an excellent meal!
L'AUBERGE
2826 El Camino Real
Redwood Citv
365-3735
Some reviewers feel that the
only noteworthy restaurants in
the deluxe dining category on the
Peninsula were La Tour and Les
Provinces. At least one other,
L'Auberge. may deserve the
same distinction.
L'Auberge is the kind of re
staurant you expect to find only
up in the City. Dining is fairly
formal, and a jacket and tie is

considered the appropriate attire
for men. The menu is large and
represents a well-chosen selec
tion of traditional continental re
cipes.
While it wouldn't be hard to
run up a $50 to $60 dinner bill
for two, it would be just as easy
to keep the tab down to $30,
wine included, and still enjoy an
exceptional meal.
Entrees are organized under
two headings: Specialties du
Jour and Specialties de la
Maison. The latter includes a
sampling of haute cuisine favo
rites 2 2 to be exact. Escalope
of Veal Cordon Bleu ($10.25),
Steak Diane L'Auberge a la
Louis ($13.50) and Chicken
Saude with Artichokes and
Chives Jerusalem ($9.25), only
begin to suggest all the bases co
vered.
For dessert, consider the
French restaurant regulars —
Crepes Suzette ($9 for two),
Chocolate Mousse ($.95), and
Creme Caramel ($1.95).
Traditional appointments, a
corps of very professional wait
ers and old-fashioned heavy
white linen compensate for what
would otherwise be an unin
teresting decor.
L'OMELETTE
4170 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-6812
L'Omelette, after undergoing
many changes in recent years,
has emerged under the direction
of owner-chef Louis Borel as a
line French restaurant serving
excellent food in a friendly and
efficient manner.
Dinnerat L'Omelette includes
soup du jour, salad, fresh veget
able du jour and potato or rice.
Also available for an extra
charge are any of the 10 appetiz
ers, onion soup gratinee, a large
array of desserts, a choice of be
verages and any selection from
the eight page wine list.
But indecision when choosing
a main course at L'Omelette
must not be uncommon as the
dinner menu is both varied and
extensive. In addition to the reg
ular offerings, which include
such diverse choices as Paupiette
de Sole Deauville ($9.75), fillet
of sole with creamed lobster
sauce, mushrooms and shrimp,
and Civet de Lapin, Chasseur
($8.95), rabbit, hunter's style,
L'Omelette serves a variety of
house specialties that change

daily.
Nine dessert choices range
from the traditional Chocolate
Mousse ($1.75) to the continent
— inspiring Camembert Cheese
($2). My companion decided on
the cheesecake ($.50) while 1 or
dered the house specialty. Fresh
Strawberries Romanoff
($2.75).
L'Omelette is a fine French re
staurant serving high quality
food that is consistently good
and frequently exceptional. The
food, the entertaining and atten
tive service and the warm atmos
phere all make L'Omelette an
excellent choice.
WILD STRAWBERRIES
127 Town & Country Village
Palo Alto
321-7525
Nothing exceptional, but still
something nice.
Wild Strawberries presents a
healthful array of salads, cheese
boards and quiches. The choice
is not unpleasant, only surpris
ing; indeed. Wild Strawberries
offers an appealing alternative to
restaurants within a similar price
range (the Good Earth and Chef
Chu's).
Wild Strawberries' salad bar
has already established a serious
following. Here the display of
marinated artichoke hearts,
potatoes o'brien, carrot and
raisin salad and even pickled
herring keep diners coming back
for more.
Salad is included in the price of
all dinner items (with no limit on
how many times you can go back
to refill your plate), or can be
ordered separately for $4.25.
The dinner menu lists eight en
trees below $6.50 as well as
spiced Indonesian shrimp curry
for $8.25 and the $1,000,000
Board priced at $8. an exquisite
presentation of red ca\ iar, whole
artichoke, chilled smoked sal
mon, and brie cheese served with
a split of champagne. Notable
among the first group are a
cheese fondue ($<S.25 for two),
and the Middle Eastern Board
with stuffed grape leaves, feta
cheese, and pita bread available
for $5.10.
Desserts are simple and reflect
a preference for "the organic."
Strawberries and frozen yogurt
($1.75), homemade zucchini
cake ($1.25) and a fruit and
cheese board ($2.50) are all
uood choices.

TWO SISTERS CREPERIE
355 State
Los Altos
941-27H2
Two Sisters is an excellent
place to escape the noisy, hectic
world for a quiet, relaxing and
casual dinner.
The Two Sisters Creperie is a
delightful dining experience.
The service is friendly and var
ied. with the waitress, manager,
and one of the chefs all taking
part. The dinners are solid, but
the salads and the desserts are
the outstanding offerings.
The dinner menu features en
tree crepes, with other entrees —
Quiche Lorraine ($5.25) and
Crab Quiche ($5.75) — also of
fered along with a daily special
such as Leg of Lamp ($6.50) or
Prime Rib an jus ($8.50).
There are a variety of appetiz
ing salads to choose from includ
ing a large plate from the exten
sive salad bar ($3).
The entree crepes, ranging
from $5.25 to $6.25, include
choice of soup or salad bar, and
rice pilaf. A very nice feature of
the menu is that foran additional
$2 the extra hungry diner can
order a second crepe.
The desserts were works of
art. The Jamaican Pleasure
($2.25). a crepe filled with van-

ilia ice creame, banana slices
sauteed in brown sugar, butter
and rum, topped with a whipped
cream and nuts, was a tropical
dream. The Fantasy Fudge
Crepe ($2.25). a warm crepe
stuffed with \anilla ice cream
and smothered in hot fudge
sauce is a must for the sundae
fiend.
