tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss ihemu.shu
pork which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it indistinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items lor lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any ol their
"specialties." And it there's a
dish not on the menu, Clui will
prepare it specially il you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carle items and $6.50 to $7.50
lor dinners). Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.

THE CHINA LION
3345 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-9989
China Lion, though only two
and a halt years old, is establish
ing a reputation tor excellent
Chinese lood. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Manda
rin and I lunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner which
include old favorites but also
offer many specialties. And if
you call lirst and tell them how
many people are in your group,
the owner will prepare you a spe
cially selected dinner. In addi
tion, anything not on the menu
will be promptly prepared on re
quest.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
I or a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5. but it
is worth it to splurge and pay the
$7.25 for the Lobster Chicken
Ball.
I was impressed with
their selection of soups
spinach bean curd, tomato egg
flower, abalone and seaweed, to
name a few.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE
RESTAURANT
288 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-2604
This restaurant offers great
people, great atmosphere and,
best ol all, great lood. Run by
former Vietnamese vice
premier Nguyenton Joan, the
Mekong oilers 23 entrees and
live soups all reasonably priced
at about S3 a la carle.
Vietnamese cookine uses

marinades and spices exten
sively, hut they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct hut subtle spicing
and the fresh ingredients reflects
the great care in preparation of
food at the Mekong.
Notable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic
ken which is first marinated in
green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries. The
Mekong offers a very civilized
but casual atmosphere.
MING'S
1700 Kmharcadcro Road
Fas! I'alo Alio
856-7700
Perhaps one of the finest tradi
tions in the Stanford area, Ming's
offers surprisingly inexpensive
meals in a pleasant setting.
Set just off I lighway 101 at the
end ot Embarcadero Road,

Ming's offers a broad range of
Cantonese cuisine and has done
so since 1 956.
The menu includes five basic
dinners, ranging in price from
$7.50 to $15, and supplements
these with numerous a la carte
offerings.
The atmosphere is pleasant in
the large dining rooms, and ser
vice is prompt and attentive. Re
servations are advised or
you can take your chances and
wait for your table in the bar,
where hot hors d'oeuvres are
served regularly along with
moderate quality drinks.
EXOTIC
CARAVANSARY
310 Sutter St.
San Francisco
362-4640
Caravansary Restaurant is all
that its name implies. Mid East
ern, relaxing, delicious — it is a
more pleasant oasis in San Fran
cisco. a city of overpriced unau
thentic foreign restaurants.
The cuisine at Caravansary
Restaurant is excellent pre
pared. Chicken Tebaka ($8.50)
was unique. This boneless breast
of chicken was marinated for 24
hours in pomegranate juice, then
pressed and baked in lemon but
ter. garlic and herbs.
While the Mantar Kahoh was
more familiar tasting, it was un
usually good. This generous por
tion of charbroiled top round of
lamb stuffed with mushrooms
was tender and generous, its sea
soning flavorful yet subtle.
From Caravansary's dessert
list which included cheese cake
and Baklava, we chose chocolate
mousse, which was extremely

thick and smooth, rich and
chocolaty, yet not too sweet.
Caravansary merits its name
simply for its well-prepared au
thentic Middle Eastern food, but
also for its attractive decor and
efficient, personable service.

MFNARA MOROCCAN RE
STAURANT
41 East Gish Road
San Jose
998-1583
I was a little dubious about
driving to San Jose to review the
Menara Moroccan Restaurant,
with gas lines what they are. But
once there I was treated to one of
the most delicious, and certainly
the most relaxing dinner I have
ever eaten.
One has the choice of sitting
on luxurious couch sections
which run along the entire
perimeter of the dining room or
leather floor cushions which are
strewn around the outside half of
the low dining table.
There are three complete din
ners from which to choose. Le
Diner Menara ($13.95), the spe
cialty of the house, features lamb
and chicken, Le Diner Rabati
($ 14.95) features hare and lamb.
And the other dinner ($12.95)
offers the choice of one entree
from six, among them Brochette
de Kabab, Tajine tie Lapin Pap
rika (hare and paprika), and
Tajine ii Ague ah (Jama ma
(lamb and onions). The only
stipulation is that all the guests at
one table partake of the same
dinner.
Before the meal, an exotic
teapot and golden urn are
brought to the table for the tradi
tional hand washing since almost
the entire meal is eaten with the
fingers.
The restaurant was a visual
and gastronomic delight. The
prices are expensive, but the
food is exceptional.
The restaurant is open every
night, except Sunday, from 6 to
10 for dinner. On Friday and
Saturday evenings it features
belly dancers. Reservations are
recommended.

COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN 880
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, arc not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century
A.I). The Chinese added veget
ables and other ingredients, and
the cuisine became known as the
" Mongolian Barbequc."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars) are
in for a new treat — an entree
bar! Dinner is priced at $4.95
and includes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbequc sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming bv the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Colonel
Lee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279
At last there is a restaurant in
the Bay Area that offers the fine
Mediterranean food of southern
Europe. It has been up to the
Sicilians with the successful
Caffe Sport and, lately, the
Spanish with El Meson to repre
sent the greatness of the much
maligned cuisine of the Mediter
ranean.
HI Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callus a
In Madrilena (Tripe Madrid style
$2.50), Dabadana Asturiana
(casserole of white beans, ham,
chorizo and pork $2.75) and

Chorizo Salteado (sauteed
ehorizo $2.50), are three of the
rarer items in the appetizer
category. Culamares Rebozados
(breaded baby squid with lemon)
is a best buy at $2.50. A huge
plate of the squid would have
been more than enough for a
main course. And they were ex
cellent.
El Meson offers three soups.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.
Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50.
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Other sure bets are two of the
chefs specials: The Filete de
Pargo a la Bate/era (red snapper
$6.75) and the Zarzuela Costa
Brava (assorted seafood and
shellfish in a "magnificent"
sauce). Two other dishes de
monstrate the eclecticism of a
Spanish menu that draws from
all the regions of Spain: Ostras El
Meson (oysters in the house
sauce) and the Basque dish Mer
luza a la Vasca ($7.50).
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled

lamb $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,

the Budin de Pun (bread pud
ding) or the Nalillas (special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
Mexican
CASA REAL
721 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-0959
Casa Real is an ideal place for
that quick and inexpensive meal
when you just don't feel like the
local hamburger hangout. The
food is the standard Mexican re
staurant menu, hut it is well pre
pared and the service is quite
pleasant. The location, literally
right off campus, is quite conve
nient too.
Meals can be enjoyed inside or
outside on the patio. Wine and
beer from Mexico compliment



the meal. The atmosphere is
casual and relaxed.
Lunch is served from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. Monday through Fri
day and from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30
p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Din
ner, generally under $5, is served
from 6 p.m. until about 10 p.m.
LA POSADA
Old Mill Shopping Center
Mountain View
941-3245
For those who enjoy excellent
Mexican food, and lots of it.in a
relaxing atmosphere. La Posada
is the place.
The service is pleasant and at
tentive. and the cost is somewhat
high (approaching S2O for din
ner for two), at least for a Mexi
can restaurant, but the excel
lence of the food makes it well
worth it. The menu is extensive
and diverse, with dishes to please
most anyone's tastes.
Some of the house entrees are
particularly noteworthy. Espe
cialh delightful is the La Posada
Tostada which is the biggest tos
tada you've probably ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and only
order one. The second will go to
waste.
Lunch and dinner are served
either in the dining room or on
the patio in the mall of the shop

ping center from 11:30 a.m. to
11 p.m.
LA ESTRELLITA
Corner of San Antonio and El
Camino
Mountain View
No phone
The best Mexican restarant in
the Stanford area is La Estrallita.
Estrallita. located on San An
tonio and El Camino, means'lit
tle star." but it deserves four big
ones.

It used to be that Estrallita was
run by nuns, with the profits of
the restaurant going to their re
ligious cause. Today the elderly
ladies seem to be absent, but the
food is still excellent and the ser
vice faster.
Humongous portions of qual
ity fare at incredible prices are
the formula for success at this
establishment.

Anything you order will be
tremendous, from the super-hot
sauce to the tamales, enchiladas
and chile rellenos. An outstand
ing value is the gargantuan chic
ken or beef burrito ($3). with
grand chunks of meat in and atop
it. Tostadas with guacamole are
very fine as well.
I cannot recommend Estrallita
highly enough. But a word of
caution: it is difficult to manage
more than two main items at one
sitting. Famous doggie bags.
You could net bv easily with
$4.
Ice Cream
Ice cream. America's most
popular junk food, has an espe
cially dedicated following among
students in a state with a repres
sive drinking age.
The Peninsula has a high de
nsity of ice cream parlors that
make their products on their own
premises.
Three such parlors were rated
for these qualities: amount,
smoothness, taste, service,
choice of flavors, quality, and
that great equalizer, price.
It may corneas no surprise that
Bud's Ice Cream of Redwood
City is in first place. A great vari
ety of smooth, 16 percent
butterfat-type flavors has been
Bud's attraction since the 1 y2()s.
Even the 15 minute drive down
grotesque El Camino Real
should not deter avid Bud's cul
tists. Butterbrickle and bit
tersweet chocolate make an awe

some combination.
Swensen's ice cream chain is
the most expensive. All ice
cream is made at the indi\ idual
stores. Great selection of flavors
and the most creamy-textured of
ice creams keep the fans return
ing. Swiss orange chip, rum and
raisin, and the finest French van
illa around are favorites here.
Tucked away in the Charles
ton Shopping Center, at the
corner of Middlefield and Char
leston. Rick's Rather Rich is vir
tually unknown to the Stanford
community.
"Rather Rich" describes its
commestibles such as mocha al
mond fudge and carob honey.
Rick's prices are quite reasona
ble and the service is always
cheery. Shakes here are crowned
with whipped cream and are sec
ond only to those of the legen
dary Peninsula Creamery.
Frozen Yogurt
Within biking distance of
campus, there are several estab
lishments which offer frozen
yogurt as an alternative to ice
cream.

However, not all frozen yogurt
is alike. It varies tremendously in
taste, quality, price and nutri
tional value.
YOGURT VILLAGE
4546 El Camino Real
Los Altos
948-1790
The green plants and wooden
tables of this shop created a very
comfortable and relaxing atmos
phere. Offering four daily flavors
of yogurt. Yogurt Village is con
cerned with choosing brands
which do not use sugar as a
sweetener. Alta-Dena yogurt is
usually served.
This store was the only one
which had a chocolate flavor
made without sugar. It tasted
creamy, like soft frosty ice
cream. A cantelope-half, filled
with yogurt and covered with
toppings, is one of their special
ties. Seventeen cents per ounce.
Yogurt Village has opened a
new branch at the Stanford
Shopping Center. It offers eight
flavors and 26 toppings.
DOWNTOWN YOGURT
SHOPPE
107 Town and Country Village
Palo Alto
327-2558
This shop, which serves
Alta-Dena yogurt, serves daily a
variety of flavors and toppings as
well as yogurt sundaes and pies.

l emon, strawberry and peaces
and cream flavors were sampled.
The lemon was tangy though
chalky tasting, strawberry was
\ cry refreshing and the combina
tion of peach, and \ anilla yogurts
was reminiscent of fresh peaches
with cream.
Prices were 16 cents per
ounce. Downtown is open 1 1
a.m.-10 p.m., six days a week
and 12-9 p.m. on Sunday.
SWKNSEN'S
440 University Ave.
Halo Alto
328-6869
Offering a hand-packed fro
zen yogurt dessert, Swensen's
was disappointing. The flavors
were too sugary and processed
tasting, even though the yogurt
had been made on the premises.
Average prices; 14 cents per
ounce.
BASKIN-ROBBINS
267 University Ave.
Palo Alto
325-2100
Although Baskin-Robbin's
frozen yogurt ranked slightly
above that offered by Swensen's,
it did not come close to Old
Uncle Gaylord's. The "For
Chocolate Lovers Only" flavor
was yogurty tasting and laced
with chocolate bits but it was not
anything special, nor were any of
the other flavors. Thirteen cents
per ounce.
OLD UNCLE GAYLORD'S
636 Kmerson
Palo Alto
326-1809
On a side street in Palo Alto,
we found a wonderful surprise:
healthful, hand-cranked, natural
frozen yogurt. It is delicious and
really tastes like yogurt. Uncle

Gaylord's is a delight lor the
yogurt and "quality food' lover.
Yogurt flavors range from the
very tangy and unusual ohberry
to a naturally-sweet date and
honey. Remember the way that
vanilla always smells in the bot
tle? That wonderful smell is the
taste of Gaylord's va..ilia frozen
yogurt.
For late night yogurt cravings.
Old Uncle Gaylord's is open
later than any other local shop —
until midnight. Prices are aver-,
age, at 14 cents per ounce.

THE GOOD EARTH RE
STAURANT
185 University Ave.
Palo Alto
321-9449
The Good Earth is one of the
best deals around for frozen
yogurt. They have one daily
flavor of the Alta-Dena brand
yogurt, which has a high nutri
tional value and low calorie and
chemical content. The Good
Earth offers'' various dishes and
toppings as well as delicious
shakes combining fruit, yogurt
and juice.
In addition to high quality and
convenient location, the Good
Earth has the cheapest price in
the area for fro/en yogurt: 1 1
cents per ounce. The restaurant
serves frozen yogurt 7:30 a.m.-
9:30 p.m., daiiy.
