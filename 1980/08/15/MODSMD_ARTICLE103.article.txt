tremely popular with Stanford
people because it combines un
commonly good service with
some of the best Chinese cook
ing in the area.
One shouldn't miss ihemu.shu
pork which is definitively done at
Chef Chu's. Served with silk-thin
crepes, it indistinct from the pan
cakes found at most other places.
The menu is well-chosen and
varied with over 150 a la carte
items lor lunch and dinner; one
can't go wrong with any ol their
"specialties." And it there's a
dish not on the menu, Clui will
prepare it specially il you give
him a call and ask.
Although the prices are no
longer cheap ($4.25 for most a la
carle items and $6.50 to $7.50
lor dinners). Chef Chu's is a
lively and fun place to dine,
especially with a large group of
people.

THE CHINA LION

China Lion, though only two
and a halt years old, is establish
ing a reputation tor excellent
Chinese lood. Samson Chu
(brother of "Chef Chu"), owner
and head chef, brings wide and
varied experience to his Manda
rin and I lunan cuisine.
The menu features over 180
items for lunch and dinner which
include old favorites but also
offer many specialties. And if
you call lirst and tell them how
many people are in your group,
the owner will prepare you a spe
cially selected dinner. In addi
tion, anything not on the menu
will be promptly prepared on re
quest.
The food is delicious and the
service is attentive. The prices
I or a la carte entrees are gener
ally between $4.25 and $5. but it
is worth it to splurge and pay the
$7.25 for the Lobster Chicken
Ball.
I was impressed with
their selection of soups
spinach bean curd, tomato egg
flower, abalone and seaweed, to
name a few.
MEKONG VIETNAMESE

Vietnamese cookine uses

marinades and spices exten
sively, hut they never overpower
the ingredients' own character.
The distinct hut subtle spicing

the great care in preparation of

Notable among the entrees
are the unusual barbecue chic

green onion and soy sauce, and
the Mekong curries. The
Mekong offers a very civilized
but casual atmosphere.

Fas! I'alo Alio

EXOTIC
CARAVANSARY
310 Sutter St.
San Francisco
362-4640
Caravansary Restaurant is all
that its name implies. Mid East
ern, relaxing, delicious — it is a
more pleasant oasis in San Fran
cisco. a city of overpriced unau
thentic foreign restaurants.
The cuisine at Caravansary
Restaurant is excellent pre
pared. Chicken Tebaka ($8.50)
was unique. This boneless breast
of chicken was marinated for 24
hours in pomegranate juice, then
pressed and baked in lemon but
ter. garlic and herbs.
While the Mantar Kahoh was
more familiar tasting, it was un
usually good. This generous por
tion of charbroiled top round of
lamb stuffed with mushrooms
was tender and generous, its sea
soning flavorful yet subtle.
From Caravansary's dessert
list which included cheese cake
and Baklava, we chose chocolate
mousse, which was extremely

thick and smooth, rich and
chocolaty, yet not too sweet.
Caravansary merits its name
simply for its well-prepared au
thentic Middle Eastern food, but
also for its attractive decor and
efficient, personable service.

MFNARA MOROCCAN RE
STAURANT
41 East Gish Road
San Jose
998-1583
I was a little dubious about
driving to San Jose to review the
Menara Moroccan Restaurant,
with gas lines what they are. But
once there I was treated to one of
the most delicious, and certainly
the most relaxing dinner I have
ever eaten.
One has the choice of sitting
on luxurious couch sections
which run along the entire
perimeter of the dining room or
leather floor cushions which are
strewn around the outside half of
the low dining table.
There are three complete din
ners from which to choose. Le
Diner Menara ($13.95), the spe
cialty of the house, features lamb
and chicken, Le Diner Rabati
($ 14.95) features hare and lamb.
And the other dinner ($12.95)
offers the choice of one entree
from six, among them Brochette
de Kabab, Tajine tie Lapin Pap
rika (hare and paprika), and
Tajine ii Ague ah (Jama ma
(lamb and onions). The only
stipulation is that all the guests at
one table partake of the same
dinner.
Before the meal, an exotic
teapot and golden urn are
brought to the table for the tradi
tional hand washing since almost
the entire meal is eaten with the
fingers.
The restaurant was a visual
and gastronomic delight. The
prices are expensive, but the
food is exceptional.
The restaurant is open every
night, except Sunday, from 6 to
10 for dinner. On Friday and
Saturday evenings it features
belly dancers. Reservations are
recommended.

COLONEL LEE'S
MONGOLIAN 880
304 Castro Street
Mountain View
968-0381
The Mongols, due to their
nomadic lifestyle, arc not
known for their fancy cookery.
Their simple diet of thin-sliced,
roasted meat was introduced in
China during the 13th century
A.I). The Chinese added veget
ables and other ingredients, and
the cuisine became known as the
" Mongolian Barbequc."
Lovers of "bars" (salad bars,
dessert bars, appetizer bars) are
in for a new treat — an entree
bar! Dinner is priced at $4.95
and includes all you can eat.
Take a bowl and help yourself
to frozen strips of turkey, lamb,
pork and beef. Fresh vegetables,
including shredded carrots, on
ions, celery, cabbage, bean spr
outs and cilantro, are next.
Everything is topped off by
any of several barbequc sauces.
Curry, sweet and sour, lobster,
spicy, mild, medium, hot and
extra hot are offered, and you
are encouraged to create your
own combination.
The atmosphere at Colonel
Lee's is quiet, relaxed and
casual, typical of neighborhood
cafes. The service is courteous,
and made somewhat more
charming bv the fact that no one
spoke English very well. Colonel
Lee's might be just the ticket if
you are looking for something
truly unusual.
EL MESON
1333 Columbus Ave.
San Francisco
928-2279
At last there is a restaurant in
the Bay Area that offers the fine
Mediterranean food of southern
Europe. It has been up to the
Sicilians with the successful
Caffe Sport and, lately, the
Spanish with El Meson to repre
sent the greatness of the much
maligned cuisine of the Mediter
ranean.
HI Meson's appetizers are ex
tensive and, compared to every
thing sampled, clearly were the
best items on the menu. Callus a
In Madrilena (Tripe Madrid style
$2.50), Dabadana Asturiana
(casserole of white beans, ham,
chorizo and pork $2.75) and

Chorizo Salteado (sauteed
ehorizo $2.50), are three of the
rarer items in the appetizer
category. Culamares Rebozados
(breaded baby squid with lemon)
is a best buy at $2.50. A huge
plate of the squid would have
been more than enough for a
main course. And they were ex
cellent.
El Meson offers three soups.
The house salad — Ensalada
Espanola — a mixture of onion,
tomatoes, lettuce, with an oil and
vinegar dressing, is superb.
Except for the lobster and
paella dishes, both of which
serve two persons, all the sea
food entrees are priced between
$6.25 and $8.50.
But opt for the Paella Velen
ciana, a paella with chicken,
pork, chorizo and shellfish. The
Paella Marinera ($16.50 for two)
was rather characterless.
Other sure bets are two of the
chefs specials: The Filete de
Pargo a la Bate/era (red snapper
$6.75) and the Zarzuela Costa
Brava (assorted seafood and
shellfish in a "magnificent"
sauce). Two other dishes de
monstrate the eclecticism of a
Spanish menu that draws from
all the regions of Spain: Ostras El
Meson (oysters in the house
sauce) and the Basque dish Mer
luza a la Vasca ($7.50).
Of the 10 chicken and meat
entrees, the Cordero a la Man
chega (marinated and grilled

lamb $8.25) is outstanding.
Served with wedges of lemon,
rice and vegetables, this dish
would be a "must" in any re
staurant.
And to end your meal, you can
choose between the classic flan,

the Budin de Pun (bread pud
ding) or the Nalillas (special
Spanish cream) for dessert.
Mexican
CASA REAL
721 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
326-0959
Casa Real is an ideal place for
that quick and inexpensive meal
when you just don't feel like the
local hamburger hangout. The
food is the standard Mexican re
staurant menu, hut it is well pre
pared and the service is quite
pleasant. The location, literally
right off campus, is quite conve
nient too.
Meals can be enjoyed inside or
outside on the patio. Wine and
beer from Mexico compliment
