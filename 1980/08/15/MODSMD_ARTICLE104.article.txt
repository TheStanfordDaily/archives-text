# Something else that's special about S.F. – its nightclubs
## 
### 
Newark has discos. Cleveland
has discos. Omaha has discos.
Even Marriot's Great America
has discos.
Houston has a stadium capa
ble of accomodating Led Zeppe
lin. Seattle has a really big
stadium and they put really big
(and trashy and mindless) acts
like Aerosmith in there. Los
Angeles has two stadiums capa
ble of accomodating Aerosmith
if you count Anaheim (the Rams
did).
And every place has sym
phonies, albeit of varied quality.
Every place also has Roller
Derby rinks and experimental
theater. Every place has most
everything, it you look long
enough — even the most branch
office of all branch office met
ropoli go to pains to see that this
is true. Quality of performance
aside, it just goes to show that it
was a mistake to leave Kansas in
the first place. Maybe out there
you can't get what you want, but
you can get what you need, so to
speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. San Francisco's night
clubs, even more than Herb
Caen and the Zodiac Killer, dis
tinguish this city from every in
habited community outside New
York State lines. The City has
more nightclubs than LA, for in
stance, which holds somewhere
near eight times as many in
habitants, and it offers more var
iety than LA, for example, which
holds eight times as many human
beings. No one knows why this is
true of course, except for the oc
casional smartass who argues
that San Franciscans are a race of
supremely intelligent hippie
freaks — whatever the reason, it
remains a True Fact that night
clubs here are thriving.
There are, again, many species
in the nightclub genus. We have,
for example, sleazy dives where
you can simulate living in De
troit. and more than our share of
establishments catering to the
Carol Doda crowd. And if you
went to Exeter, no need to
worry, there are exclusive places,
where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes
— hold your breath — the City
has upwards of a billion zillion
"miscellaneous" nightclubs,
ranging all the way from the
red-velvet-and-1 rank Gorshen
posh of the Fairmont Hotel to
the j ump-up-and-dovvn,
paralyzed-for-lifc, what-kind ot
funny pills did-you-say-they
were? Oh-my-god they're
turning-into-reptiles content
ment ol Mubuhay Gardens. San
Francisco, in short, has many,
many establishments designed to
provide you with entertainment
and/or dancing and/or grounds
for imbibing at night.

Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to
go. It isn't always good to have a
billion y.illion nightclubs if your
orientation issue doesn't at least
include a guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw
the noose. . ..
Did 1 happen to hear someone
out there ask for nightclub ad
vice? You in the back with cal
culator in one hand and
Michelob in the other? Very
good. There lire several such es
tablishments between here and
Marin County that could do with
special mention — if you insist. I
will force myself to reveal the lo
cation of a few.
The Great American Music
11;JI, the Old Waldorf, the Keys
tone Berkeley, the Keystone
Palo Alto, Keystone Korner and
Christo's come instantaneously
to mind, which leaves out a few,
but we'll probably get to them in
just an instant or two.
Excuse me, do I see another
hand? You in the warm-up suit?
Yes, I do suppose it's true that a
laundry list won't help much,
owing to considerable diversity
as to what in reality constitutes a
truly mythical experience
beyond anyone's wildest dreams.
I see your point. Some people
value dancing space more than
they value perfect acoustics, and
that does make it difficult to give
worthwhile advice. Almost
makes it impossible, in fact.

Hut wait. Most people here
have never even been to a night
club, and lor that reason it would
do you good if I listed what you
should look for. There are im
mutahle principles in any busi
ness. So go grab a pencil, or grab
a friend with a pencil, and write
down all of the following.
Please? What follows are the
rules by which one should judge
a nightclub (examples included).
Ahem.
Rule number one of nightclub
choosery specifically prohibits
parties of the first part from fol
lowing only high fame quotient
stars. High fame quotient stars
usually end up in stadiums, with
high boredom quotient warm-up
acts — you must remember that
nightclubs depend on medium
small entertainers.
"Medium-small" generally
has to do only with album sales,
however, as does the "high fame
quotient" — the point is that you
ought not wait all year for your
favorite group. They'll sell out
anyway, if they play in a night
club. so what true clubbers ought
to do is experiment with their
ears.
And you should know in ad
vance that rule number two is
taught for a great many people.
It requires that you admit the
existence of a Haw. Yet it is im
portant. and we should shed our
misconceptions eventually. So
remember this — despite the
popularity of component stereo

systems with multi-colored dials
and switches, most of humanity
is unable to tell a good sound
system from a dixie cup on a
string. It follows from that that
although sound systems vary in
nightclubs, to most people it
doesn't really matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh / Patti Smith /
Warren Zevon types — it is sur
prising how badly the music is
mixed ("mixing" is related to
amplification which has to do
with electricity. OK?) And
Great America's beautiful gold
leaf interior can sometimes send
a trumpet solo into an ear in a
disconcerting moment. But both
places simply don't need perfect
acoustics, because there are very
few perfect ears. Those so bles
sed can find what they need at
nearly every jazz club. (Keys
tone Korner for example. That's
a jazz place, and one of the best
anywhere. Jazz places are Ire

quented by people who demand
near-perfect acoustics — they
have it because they need it, but
other places don't.)
So that's rule two, to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Next, it is absolutely essential
to know what kind ol crowd you
like. I here's a world ol differ
ence between Mabuhay
Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know it.
for example. You gots to know
which ilk you really enjoy or else
it could destroy an evening.
And Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to be
sure — though neo-fascists pre
fer to call it "sick punk rock
crap"— but sometimes it seems
as if the music is less of an attrac
tion than the seething masses
themselves. The Mabuhay has a
distinctive crowd, to say the
least, and bridge players would
be uncomfortable. The music
does attain near-mythic status
with greater than average fre
quency, but if you're looking for
<m evening free of living ashtravs

this simply isn t your place.
GAMH is calm, the Keystones
are relatively Bohemian, and the
Waldort is rowdy-but
controlled, and surprisingly even
cross-over crowds are affected
by these reputations. It doesn't
mean that Herb Albert could
play Mabuhay and bring the
world to an end. or that Johnny
Rotten wouldn't notice that
things were quieter in the Vene
tian Room, but certain clubs do
have certain types of crowds, and
they tend to be distinctive.
The Keystone Palo Alto has
more of a straight rock crowd —
kids who've seen the Greg Kihn
Band times in the last two
years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it lias the added
advantage of being close by. un
like the MabulKty, where you
have to drive up to the City in
order to get your face threatened
by sharp objects.
The sound system at the Keys
tone is loud — in order to aid that
Communist conspiracy (some
times called rock n' roll) aimed
at destroying the ears and morals
of America's youth (oh, what are
they doing to us. ma?)

Kule three lias to uo witn tic
ket prices, but that's usually in
the paper, so forget it.
And the differences in food
and drink prices begat rule
number four. And 10, the mul
titudes were told not to forget
that gasoline is sometimes re
quired when return is made to
Palo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
of the golden call ol tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
Meanwhile, over at rule
number five, everybody got the
I inal Clue. When you choose a
club, and like it. go back. Fre
quent the place that treated you
like you wanted to be treated.
I lie psychological difference be
tween an easy ID check and the
jerk who laughs and says you
don't look 13 can be considera
ble. and a place that has extra
dancing space might turn things
around. Never underestimate
the power of a pleasant atmos
phere. once you've made up your
mind as to your definition of
"pleasant."
