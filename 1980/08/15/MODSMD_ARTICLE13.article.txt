## Daily benefits staffers 
### 
It was not quite four
years ago that we first
walked into the Daily
office, and now, in a
trite sort of way, it is
very hard to imagine fi
nally leaving for good.
As we look around, we
can remember how we
used to be so thrilled
with having an article
printed on these pages
and how now it is more
of a bother signifying
that we couldn't find a
reporter to do it instead.
We remember how im
posing this place used to
seem, and how now it is
a place where we can sit
with friends eating pizza
and cracking jokes. But
for better or for worse,
this is the last issue of
the Daily we will ever
have anything to do
with.
Hemingway once
wrote, if we remember
him correctly, that it is
sad when anything ends,
but that if the thing end
ing is bad the sadness
goes away by itself,
while if the thing ending
is good, the sadness will
only go away when the
thing is replaced by
something better.
We don't know if we
believe that (we don't
know whether we want
to), for in the whirlwind
of the thousand details
we must take care of be
fore the next adventure
starts in September, the
Daily is already begin
ning to become less im
portant. We feel more
hectic than sad.
But when we stop for
a moment to reflect, we
realize that if the Daily,

and Stanford, is ever re
placed by something
better, we will he very
fortunate indeed. We
won't try to describe
how much this place can
mean to someone; we
can just hope that even
those of you who were
only here for a summer
have at least some feel
ing of what we mean.
For us, the Daily was
part of our Stanford
routine. In specific it
taught us the techniques
of journalism and re
porting, but more im
portantly it taught us
how to deal with people
and the written word.
Although neither of us
will pursue journalism
as a career, we are sure
the skills we've learned,
the friendships we've
made and the confi
dence we've gained will
serve us well in the fu
ture. And as our room
ates used to joke, the
Daily was almost our
second home.
We realize that for
most of you, the Daily is
little more than a side
dish at breakfast. But
we hope that even so,
the Daily has been a
worthwhile, if small part
of your Stanford experi
ence. One of the things
we think we've learned
here is that perhaps the
greatest blessing one
can hope for is to be able
to do what one loves to
do, and make other
people's lives the hap
pier for it. We've had
fun here at the Daily; we
hope it has enriched
your stay at Stanford
too.
