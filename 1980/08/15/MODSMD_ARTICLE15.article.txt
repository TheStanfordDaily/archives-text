## Enjoy showing tourists The City 
### 
Hardly a weekend has gone by
this summer without some
once-familiar face appearing at
my door, demanding my gui
dance through the streets, shops
and restaurants of San Francisco.
The trick to enjoying these
guests. I've found, is to discover
a way of doing the same things
over and over again in the city
without getting bored yourself.
This requires that you be an in
teresting and adventurous per
son in your own right. Otherwise
one's personal gazetteer will be
rather limited and even the dull
among us must get bored with
Fisherman's Whart.
If. however, you are a monu
mentally boring individual, you
probably won't mind yet another
stroll through the cracked crab
and may even enjoy eating there.
If that's the case, please stop
reading because I mean to he of
fensive.
Sometimes, however, one has
got to swallow one's pride and
consent to, it not being a tourist,
at least accompanying them.
This generally means squiring
one's parents around.
The Aged P's can be a prob

lem because they usually don't
like to walk very tar and don't
enjoy restaurants where coc
kroaches peep out of the fruit
bowl.
They are sure to want to visit
Fisherman's Wharf despite the
fact that food poisoning is prob
ably more likely there than at
your favorite, roach-infested
hole-in-the-wall.
Siblings are easier to manage
than parents, if not as generous
with their wallets. They are per
fectly happy sleeping on the
floor, follow one's advice about
restaurants and do pay for gas.
Then there are travellers and
tourists. Friends, because they
are interesting enough individu
als to have been selected as such,
are travellers instead of tourists
â€” unless you are yourself a
tourist.
Tourists are usually the friends
of friends; unfortunately, the
transitive principle does not hold
tor people. The cut-off point be
tween tourists and travellers is
Grant Avenue around Jackson.
Tourists love the overpriced
Cantonese restaurants and lm

port Emporiums of the first half
dozen blocks past the Chinatown
Gates.
I'hey prefer the galleries near
Fisherman's Wharf to those on
Sutter Street and the Japanese
Tea Garden to the De Young's
Asian arts collection. One's main
danger with tourists is that they
visited the city when they were
12 and want to duplicate their
visit exactly.
Friends are easily the best
guests. They prefer draft beer
and pinball at the Beach Chalet
to drinks at the Top-of-the-
Mark and they listen to their
host's advice about what's not
worth doing. Experienced travel
lers, however, can get a bit
single-minded about pursuing
the place's more exotic delights.
My last traveller-guest even
managed to pick up a case of
hepatitis at a Castro Street bar.
Fortunately it's another one of
those diseases you can't get from
a toilet seat, but 1 still felt much
better about my then-departed
guest when I'd gotten a fix of
gamma globulin.
