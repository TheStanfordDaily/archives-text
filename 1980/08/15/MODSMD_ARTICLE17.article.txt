## America funds murder 
### 
I considered myself lucky to
have participated in an ecumeni
cal conference on world Christ
ian mission held at Asilomar at
the end of July. The subject of
the conference was U.S. rela
tions with the countries of Latin
America, principally Nicaragua
and Bolivia.
In these countries civil unrest
has been and is a major factor in
bringing about change. 1 should
like to describe a brief but sig
nificant and moving part of the
conference.
One of the topic speakers' lec
tured about the revolution in
Nicaragua. The lecturer, a physi
cian from Managua, told us
about the final convulsions and
death throes of the Somoza re
gime.
With the ready assistance of
the United States, Somoza
bombed villages in remote areas
of Nicaragua. Dr. Parajon, his
voice trembling, read a letter
from a woman whose village was
bombed. The woman, her hus
band and their five-year-old
daughter cowered in their hut
while the American-made bom
bers strafed the village.
Bullets penetrated the walls of
their badly-built house and they
decided to make a bolt. They ran
out together, the father carrying
the child. A bomber nosedived
and shot a rocket which hit the
father and child.
Dr. Parajon's audience of
well-fed, prosperous American
church people was absolutely
hushed and silent. It was our
rocket, paid for with American
tax monies, that destroyed that
little family.
Last Monday night, August 4

— fitting prelude to Hiroshima
Day — KQHD presented an
hour and a half of the most
shameless cold-war American
propaganda bv showing "The
War Called Peace:'
We were fed the usual exagg
erations and falsehoods about
the intentions of the Soviet Un
ion. What interested and in
furiated me most was the com
placent assumption by all the
panelists, including Drew Mid
dleton of the New York Times, a
supposedly truthful newspaper,
that the U.S.S.R. is and always
has been responsible for social
upheavals among our neighbors
to the south.
Such an assumption is patently
false — in fact, absurd. Had
there been a single Russian foot
soldier in Nicaragua at the time
described by Dr. Parajon, his
presence would have been blown
up in our press to the size of sev
eral Russian divisions of tanks
and artillery.
Nobody helped those Nicra
guans to throw off the U.S.-
Somoza yoke; they managed
their revolution — long needed,
long overdue — by themselves.
Likewise in Cuba, the dictator
Batista, a brutal American pup
pet. was finally overthrown
through the unaided effort of the
Cuban people themselves.
Let's try to keep r»ur facts
straight and, above all, let us
look bravely at places in the
world where our country is culp
able, where we have committed
horrible crimes, and where we
are hated, despised and feared
with good reason.
