In April of this year, I asked
the Office of Development for
the job descriptions of positions
one classification above mine; I
had reason to believe that my
own classification was lower than
it should be. A review of these
descriptions convinced me that I
was underclassified.
Toward the end of May of this
year, I asked the Personnel Of
fice to review my job and render
an opinion. Such a request is not
unusual; moreover, it is a process
that should be of continuous
concern to all departments and
offices of the University.
My job classification was re
viewed by the Personnel Office,
as requested, and I was advised
that the classification was
proper. Not being completely in
accord with that opinion, 1 again
asked the Office of Develop
ment to see the job descriptions

of those in classifications im
mediately above mine.
I then received the absolutely
astonishing news that job de
scriptions arc confidential! I was
also advised of this by the Per
sonnel Office.
Can you imagine an organiza
tion of several thousand people
attempting to function effec
tively together if job descriptions
are confidential?
Can you imagine asking
another person with whom you
are to work what their job is,
only to be told that they could
not tell you?
Is there a concern that the
University's productivity just
might increase if we knew what
each other was doing? How jobs
are to be posted if their descrip
tions are confidential, is another
example of the ridiculousness of
this trumped-up policy.
Whether in oral or written
form, job descriptions have not

been, and are not, classified. I
have seen many at Stanford; not
one is marked confidential, and
I invite the readers to look at
their own job descriptions to see
if it is so marked.
I believe other job descrip
tions become confidential when
employees discover that they arc
underclassified.
I can accept a ruling or an
opinion that a job classification is
proper or improper. I cannot ac
cept a lie that unnecessarily sup
ports that opinion.
Personnel policies and prac
tices of the University continue
to amaze me. I hope it will ulti
mately be to the University
community's best interest if I
continue to reveal their deliber
ate absurdity.
I am not a fearer.
