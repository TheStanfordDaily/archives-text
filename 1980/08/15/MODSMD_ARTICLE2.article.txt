# Carter: It's me or Reagan
## 
### David Broder The Washington Post 
NEW YORK — Jimmy Carter
invited American voters last
night to concentrate on the
"stark choice" of future direc
tions he and Ronald Reagan are
offering — and. implicitly, to
forget what his critics call the
equally stark contrast between
his promise for America and his
performance.
In using the vast audience pro
vided by network coverage of his
acceptance speech to concen
trate on the contrast between the
"security, justice and peace" he
envisaged for his own second
term and the "despair , surrender
and risk" he said would come
with Reagan's election, the pres
ident was detining the issue in
the I ySO election in the only way
his advisers think he has a chance
to win
Predictably . Carter sought last
night to put a better face on cur
rent conditions, claiming that
militarv power has been re
stored. oil imports reduced and
eight million new jobs created.
But rather than risking his
prospects on a cosmetic
gloss of today 's economic and in-

ternational scene. Carter por
trayed himself as a man who has
learned that "the true consti
tuency" of a president "is the fu
ture."
Not only was he eager to shift
the focus from the Democratic
infighting of the recent past, he
was also anxious to avoid the
traditional incumbent's claim
that he had fulfilled his own past
promises.

With Reagan deriding "trust
me" government — in a cruel
turning ot Carter's own
catch-phrase — the president did
not recall that four years ago, in
the same hall, he had promised a
balanced budget, a comprehen
sive national health insurance
program and a complete over
haul of the tax system, among
other things, and had said, " You
can depend on it."
