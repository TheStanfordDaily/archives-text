## Laser technology protects world 
### 
Today the Soviet Union is on
the verge of shattering U.S.
complacency in its lead in de
fense technology.
It has been confirmed by sev
eral U.S. intelligence sources, in
cluding the CIA and the Air
Force, that the Soviet Union is
building a high-energy particle
beam device at Saryshagan, a
missile test range in Southern
Russia.
Construction at the site began
last November, and it seems
clear that the Soviets plan to test
the device against moving missile
targets upon completion of pre
liminary tests. Once fully de
veloped, high-energy beam

weapons similar to the Sarysha
gan prototype could destroy
satellites and missiles ; n space or
in the atmosphere.
In addition, over the past sev
eral years, the Soviets have built
a permanent orbiting Soyuz
space station that could be used
to test and deploy the laser
weapons. The capabilities of
Soviet ground-based lasers
known to exist already threaten
American satellites.
While these weapons in the
U.S.S.R. are in the early stages
of development, there is no
doubt that they will become a
reality in five to 15 years. When
these weapons are finally de
ployed in ground and space
based defense systems, they
could alter the balance of power
in favor of the country that first
deploys them.
U.S. defense analysts forsee
an American system of orbiting
weapons stations, each contain
ing several high-energy lasers
powered by nuclear explosive
devices. Each station would be
capable of destroying dozens of
hostile missiles regardless of how
the missiles were launched.
The lasers would destroy
many of the missiles in their first
50 seconds of flight. In the at
mosphere the laser could heat
the missile's skin until it crum
pled under the stress of flight.
Once in space the missile
could be disabled by focusing the
laser beam on it until a vital
component is destroyed. The or
biting defense stations would be
backed up by a ground-based
system that could destroy any
missiles that survived attack
from the orbiting lasers.
In the United States, funding
for the Defense Advanced Re
search Projects Agency that now

manages the laser and particle
beam programs has been sharply
increased from $48.8 million in
the current fiscal year to
million in Fiscal 1 1 >8 I.
The implications for the Un
ited States are profound. In the
future, political leverage will go
to the nation that maintains the
edge in energy-beam weapons.
The nation that fields the
strongest array of orbital
weapons will enjoy both a real
and perceived increase in power.
Nations lacking massive num
bers of missiles (such as Com
munist China) would have no
chance of launching a successful
nuclear missile strike.
So the advent of orbiting laser
weapons would re-establish to
some degree the nuclear
monopoly once enjoyed bv the
United States and the Soviet Un
ion.
Much of the current U.S. mis
sile arsenal would be rendered
obsolete. At present, our de
fense strategy calls for us to hide
our missiles from a potential
Soviet first strike, but it does no
thing to ensure that any of those
missiles will ever penetrate a
Soviet laser defense curtain.
Strategies that call for hordes
of low-flying cruise missiles will
prove the most effective antidote
to a defense curtain that might
not be evaded, but which might
be overwhelmed by numbers.
F or the United States to let the
future of laser and particle-beam
weapons to slip from its grasp
would be acquiesce to Soviet
strategic dominance based on
these weapons.
