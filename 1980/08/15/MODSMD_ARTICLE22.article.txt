# The 						media and political campaigns
## The 						side not covered 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
It's easy to get caught up in the
media's treatment of political
campaigns. After a while we start
to view the primaries, the
speeches, the conventions and
the issues with a Walter Cronkite
(or even a Daily staff writer?) —
like perspective.
After this conditioning, watch
ing a fundraiser or political
speech in person is an interesting
experience, because no one is
there to tell you where to look.
John Anderson spoke in
Marin County a few weeks ago.
and there was nothing particu
larly startling or unique about
the candidate or his speech that
night. But it was fun to look away
from the podium for once, and
get a feeling for the flavor of the
occasion, for the speaker's ap
pearance. for the audience's at
titude. for the time-conscious
press corps, for the stoney-faced
secret service agents, for the
red-hot supporters and for those
who came just to get out of the
house.
It was no party convention to
be sure. There were a couple ot
balloons, a few signs and a ban
ner welcoming the independent
candidate to Marin, but the
mood of the more than 2000 on
hand seemed to be that they had
paid their $5 to listen, not cheer.
As Anderson spoke, the di
verse audience searched for
common ground with the Illinois
Congressman. A middle-aged
woman might clap for Ander
son's call for lower social security
taxes, yet was still w hen he sup
ported ERA.
College students who stood up
when he spoke about the need to
monitor nuclear power plants,
sat quietly and listened when he
spoke about a $.50 gasoline tax.
Before the speech, a scenario
near the stage bothered both
press people and audience mem
bers nearby w hen a secret service
guard refused to deliver — or at
least say he'd deliver — a hand
drawn picture to Anderson after
the speech. The agent's gruff re
sponse sent a disappointed men

tally retarded young man to his
seat in tears.
When it came time for intro
ductions. civic leaders preened
and strutted, proud that a presi
dential candidate was in their
town . . . and that they got to in
troduce him. Naturally Ander
son's first words to the group fo
cused on the local angle; he
joked about the movie. Serial,
and complimented Marin's car
pool system.
As Anderson spoke, the old
metaphor likening the press to
vultures ready to pounce was
eerily reinforced. In order to cap
ture those classic touching, in
spiring or humorous facial ex
pressions, strobe flashes flared
whenever the speaker would
move his hand or adjust his glas
ses. It's funny to watch, but im
agine having to wait poised to
shoot for 45 minutes, in case
Anderson should decide to wipe
a patriotic tear from his eye or

make a fist, just so the morning
front page gets its human touch.
Local campaign workers buz
zed about, excited that their can
didate was finally in their county.
They ranged from the shy, sin
cere volunteers, to the more ag
gressive, bustling take-charge
type, all sporting the "Anderson
for president" logo and his crim
son colors.
Many remarked after the
speech that Anderson looked
'tired and at times flustered —
not surprising considering he'd
gone on a whirlwind European
tour the previous week and re
newed his west-coast attack after
barely pausing to catch his
breath. Add to that the strain of
an arduous third-party campaign
which is said to be running low
on money.
We don't always see those
scenes on the evening news, but 1
bet they're always there, some
where.


Anderson, typical of many candidates in this election year, gives a
speech to a mixed crowd. Surrounded by supporters, secret service and
the press, the audience and its reaction is a side of a campaign that
often is overlooked for the more "hard" news impact of the speeches.

barely pausing to catch his
breath. Add to that the strain of
an arduous third-party campaign
which is said to be running low
on money.
We don't always see those
scenes on the evening news, but 1
bet they're always there, some
where.


Anderson, typical of many candidates in this election year, gives a
speech to a mixed crowd. Surrounded by supporters, secret service and
the press, the audience and its reaction is a side of a campaign that
often is overlooked for the more "hard" news impact of the speeches.
It's easy to get caught up in the
media's treatment of political
campaigns. After a while we start
to view the primaries, the
speeches, the conventions and
the issues with a Walter Cronkite
(or even a Daily staff writer?) —
like perspective.
After this conditioning, watch
ing a fundraiser or political
speech in person is an interesting
experience, because no one is
there to tell you where to look.
John Anderson spoke in
Marin County a few weeks ago.
and there was nothing particu
larly startling or unique about
the candidate or his speech that
night. But it was fun to look away
from the podium for once, and
get a feeling for the flavor of the
occasion, for the speaker's ap
pearance. for the audience's at
titude. for the time-conscious
press corps, for the stoney-faced
secret service agents, for the
red-hot supporters and for those
who came just to get out of the
house.
It was no party convention to
be sure. There were a couple ot
balloons, a few signs and a ban
ner welcoming the independent
candidate to Marin, but the
mood of the more than 2000 on
hand seemed to be that they had
paid their $5 to listen, not cheer.
As Anderson spoke, the di
verse audience searched for
common ground with the Illinois
Congressman. A middle-aged
woman might clap for Ander
son's call for lower social security
taxes, yet was still w hen he sup
ported ERA.
College students who stood up
when he spoke about the need to
monitor nuclear power plants,
sat quietly and listened when he
spoke about a $.50 gasoline tax.
Before the speech, a scenario
near the stage bothered both
press people and audience mem
bers nearby w hen a secret service
guard refused to deliver — or at
least say he'd deliver — a hand
drawn picture to Anderson after
the speech. The agent's gruff re
sponse sent a disappointed men

tally retarded young man to his
seat in tears.
When it came time for intro
ductions. civic leaders preened
and strutted, proud that a presi
dential candidate was in their
town . . . and that they got to in
troduce him. Naturally Ander
son's first words to the group fo
cused on the local angle; he
joked about the movie. Serial,
and complimented Marin's car
pool system.
As Anderson spoke, the old
metaphor likening the press to
vultures ready to pounce was
eerily reinforced. In order to cap
ture those classic touching, in
spiring or humorous facial ex
pressions, strobe flashes flared
whenever the speaker would
move his hand or adjust his glas
ses. It's funny to watch, but im
agine having to wait poised to
shoot for 45 minutes, in case
Anderson should decide to wipe
a patriotic tear from his eye or

make a fist, just so the morning
front page gets its human touch.
Local campaign workers buz
zed about, excited that their can
didate was finally in their county.
They ranged from the shy, sin
cere volunteers, to the more ag
gressive, bustling take-charge
type, all sporting the "Anderson
for president" logo and his crim
son colors.
Many remarked after the
speech that Anderson looked
'tired and at times flustered —
not surprising considering he'd
gone on a whirlwind European
tour the previous week and re
newed his west-coast attack after
barely pausing to catch his
breath. Add to that the strain of
an arduous third-party campaign
which is said to be running low
on money.
We don't always see those
scenes on the evening news, but 1
bet they're always there, some
where.
