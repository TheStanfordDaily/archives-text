### Jonelle Pena Ruth MacKay Staff Writers 
This is the first of two articles
featured in this issue about the
m id - Pen ins u la co m m un ity 's
opinion of its local paper, the
Peninsula Times Tribune. The
stories ure based on the results of
a survey conducted by a precision
journalism class in the Depart
ment of Communication.
Fridays are special for Eleanor
Witherspoon. It is the one day a
week that she spends at the office
of the League of Women Voters,
and it is a busy day.
As she whips up the eggs and
starts the coffee, her husband
John goes out to get the San
Francisco Chronicle off the
doorstep of their Mountain View
home. He sits at the table read
ing it, handing her one of the
middle sections as she comes to
join him for breakfast.
Soon she is on her way to
work, listening to KCBS. She
turns it up a bit to hear a story
about a local politician whom she
has been campaigning against.
She makes a mental note to look
for more details when she comes
home to the Peninsula Times
Tribune.
Word of Mouth
At the office, Witherspoon
gets most of her information by
word of mouth. Since the office
subscription to the Christian Sci
ence Monitor ran out. she looks
to Newsweek magazine for
coverage of national and interna
tional events.
If the paperboy is on time, the
Peninsula Times Tribune is wait
ing for her when she gets home.
With only a few minutes to spare
before dinner, she pulls out the
local section to check on the
story she had heard earlier. She
scans through the paper, looks at
a few more headlines in the local
section, and puts the paper down
to fix dinner.
After dinner, she reads the
paper carefully, looking espe
cially for news concerning local
government, as well as Peninsula
news that affects Mountain
View.
"I couldn't get all of my informa
tion from one source," Withers
poon says. "One source
shouldn't be expected to do ev
erything. And they couldn't if
they tried."
Primary source of community
news
Like many Peninsula Times
Tribune readers, the Withers
poons consider that paper to be
their primary source tor com
munity and Peninsula news, but
rely upon other media for their
Bay area, national and interna
tional news.
A survey conducted by a jour
nalism class at Stanford found
that more than two-thirds of the
227 subscribers from Palo Alto,
Redwood City and Mountain
View who were contacted said
the Peninsula Times Tribune was

a supplementary rather than a
primary news souree.
It is not surprising that readers
use the Peninsula Times Tribune
mainly for local news. Most re
spondents agreed with Withers
poon who said that keeping in
touch with her community, help
ing in decisions like voting, and
keeping an eye on what elected
officials are doing were impor
tant reasons for reading the
paper.
Television holds appeal
Television news holds far
more appeal for survey respon
dents than do newspapers or
news magazines, which is consis
tent with national trends. Net
work and local television news is
watched by three-fourths of the
respondents. Yet only 48 per
cent subscribe to another daily
newspaper and 36 percent sub
scribe to another news magazine.
Even so. subscribers are seri
ous about reading their local
paper: on an average, they read
the Peninsula Times Tribune five
days a week for 30 minutes a day.
The other newspapers re
spondents receive reflect
the kind of community the mid-
Peninsula contains: a well-to-do
community with its gaze fixed
north upon San Francisco rather
than south upon San Jose. Of the
48 percent who subscribe to
another daily, 61 percent read
the Chronicle, 1 1 percent read
the San Jose Mercury, and nine
percent read the Wall Street
Journal. These last two figures
are particularly interesting if one
keeps in mind how close the
Peninsula is to San Jose and that
the Wall Street Journal's reader
ship is a fairly select group.
Other newspapers
The Peninsula Times Tribune
does not have a Sunday edition,,
and almost two-thirds of the sur
vey respondents said they regu
larly read a Sunday paper.
About half of the people ques
tioned said they subscribe to or
regularly read a weekly news
paper, primarily the Palo Alto
Weekly or the Redwood City
Almanac.
Although two-thirds of those
who read weeklies feel that they
are a supplement, rather than an
alternative to the Peninsula
Times Tribune, for some the
weekly is making up for the fact
that the Peninsula Times Tribune
has broadened its coverage at the
expense of local news. Al
together, 1 7 percent said that
their weekly paper was their
primary source of community
news.
But most Peninsula Times
Tribune subscribers were satis
lied with the coverage, saying
that they looked to the Peninsula
Times Tribune for their local
news and elsewhere for other
news. Two-thirds of the respon
dents feel that the primary role
of the paper should be to provide
news about their community or
about the Peninsula as a whole.

gets most of her information by
word of mouth. Since the office
subscription to the Christian Sci
ence Monitor ran out. she looks
to Newsweek magazine for
coverage of national and interna
tional events.
If the paperboy is on time, the
Peninsula Times Tribune is wait
ing for her when she gets home.
With only a few minutes to spare
before dinner, she pulls out the
local section to check on the
story she had heard earlier. She
scans through the paper, looks at
a few more headlines in the local
section, and puts the paper down
to fix dinner.
After dinner, she reads the
paper carefully, looking espe
cially for news concerning local
government, as well as Peninsula
news that affects Mountain
View.
"I couldn't get all of my informa
tion from one source," Withers
poon says. "One source
shouldn't be expected to do ev
erything. And they couldn't if
they tried."
Primary source of community
news
Like many Peninsula Times
Tribune readers, the Withers
poons consider that paper to be
their primary source tor com
munity and Peninsula news, but
rely upon other media for their
Bay area, national and interna
tional news.
A survey conducted by a jour
nalism class at Stanford found
that more than two-thirds of the
227 subscribers from Palo Alto,
Redwood City and Mountain
View who were contacted said
the Peninsula Times Tribune was

a supplementary rather than a
primary news souree.
It is not surprising that readers
use the Peninsula Times Tribune
mainly for local news. Most re
spondents agreed with Withers
poon who said that keeping in
touch with her community, help
ing in decisions like voting, and
keeping an eye on what elected
officials are doing were impor
tant reasons for reading the
paper.
Television holds appeal
Television news holds far
more appeal for survey respon
dents than do newspapers or
news magazines, which is consis
tent with national trends. Net
work and local television news is
watched by three-fourths of the
respondents. Yet only 48 per
cent subscribe to another daily
newspaper and 36 percent sub
scribe to another news magazine.
Even so. subscribers are seri
ous about reading their local
paper: on an average, they read
the Peninsula Times Tribune five
days a week for 30 minutes a day.
The other newspapers re
spondents receive reflect
the kind of community the mid-
Peninsula contains: a well-to-do
community with its gaze fixed
north upon San Francisco rather
than south upon San Jose. Of the
48 percent who subscribe to
another daily, 61 percent read
the Chronicle, 1 1 percent read
the San Jose Mercury, and nine
percent read the Wall Street
Journal. These last two figures
are particularly interesting if one
keeps in mind how close the
Peninsula is to San Jose and that
the Wall Street Journal's reader
ship is a fairly select group.
Other newspapers
The Peninsula Times Tribune
does not have a Sunday edition,,
and almost two-thirds of the sur
vey respondents said they regu
larly read a Sunday paper.
About half of the people ques
tioned said they subscribe to or
regularly read a weekly news
paper, primarily the Palo Alto
Weekly or the Redwood City
Almanac.
Although two-thirds of those
who read weeklies feel that they
are a supplement, rather than an
alternative to the Peninsula
Times Tribune, for some the
weekly is making up for the fact
that the Peninsula Times Tribune
has broadened its coverage at the
expense of local news. Al
together, 1 7 percent said that
their weekly paper was their
primary source of community
news.
But most Peninsula Times
Tribune subscribers were satis
lied with the coverage, saying
that they looked to the Peninsula
Times Tribune for their local
news and elsewhere for other
news. Two-thirds of the respon
dents feel that the primary role
of the paper should be to provide
news about their community or
about the Peninsula as a whole.
This is the first of two articles
featured in this issue about the

Peninsula Times Tribune. The
stories ure based on the results of
a survey conducted by a precision
journalism class in the Depart

Fridays are special for Eleanor
Witherspoon. It is the one day a
week that she spends at the office
of the League of Women Voters,
and it is a busy day.
As she whips up the eggs and
starts the coffee, her husband
John goes out to get the San
Francisco Chronicle off the
doorstep of their Mountain View
home. He sits at the table read
ing it, handing her one of the
middle sections as she comes to
join him for breakfast.
Soon she is on her way to
work, listening to KCBS. She
turns it up a bit to hear a story
about a local politician whom she
has been campaigning against.
She makes a mental note to look
for more details when she comes
home to the Peninsula Times
Tribune.
