# Readers rate Peninsula Times Tribune

### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
During the past year, the
Peninsula Times Tribune has
made some changes in its content
in an effort to satisfy its readers.
Last year, a telephone survey
conducted by a Stanford Univer
sity precision journalism class
showed that the paper's effort to
attract a younger, more mobile
audience had disaffected many
of the old subscribers to the Palo
Alto Times and the Redwood
City Tribune which had merged
to form the Peninsula Times
Tribune April 2, 1979.
At the time, many of the read
ers interviewed complained
about a decrease in the coverage
of their communities as com
pared to the coverage they re
ceived in their old local papers.
This year, a follow-up tele
phone survey was conducted
April 28-May 1 1 to find out if
the same readers who were inter
viewed last year had changed
their opinions of the paper. The
follow-up survey showed that al
though the 280 respondents
from Redwood City. Palo Alto
and Mountain View still felt a
sentimental attachment to the
papers they were receiving be
fore the merget. they generally
preferred the Peninsula Times
Tribune of today to the Penin
sula Times Tribune of a year ago.
Better than after the merger
"It'sdefinitely better than just
after the merger," one Palo Alto
reader said. Although he missed
the Palo Alto Times, he said,
"You have to make way for
progress."
A higher percentage of sub
scribers felt more positive about
the Peninsula Times Tribune's
format and style this year than
they did a year ago. They liked its
organization better, found the
layout more eyecatching, and
thought the writing was more in
teresting than it was in their old
local papers. More readers were
satisfied with the coverage of
their communities and fewer felt
that their old papers were more

personal than the Peninsula
Times Tribune..
Carollee Wheeler, a nurse
from Mountain View, is one
satisfied reader. "I think it's well
laid-out and readable," Wheeler
said. "1 like the writing."
Ratings improved
Subscribers' rating of the
Peninsula Times Tribune's per
formance in covering their com
munities has also improved dur
ing the past year. On a scale of
zero to 1000, the readers gave
community coverage an average
score of 528, as compared with a
score of 442 last year.
Colleen Baker was one Red
wood City resident who sensed a
loss of community coverage
when the papers first merged,
but now feels that coverage has
improved. "Initially, it (the new
paper) was poor because it was
geared to the southern readers,"
Baker said. "Maybe we're pro
vincial. but we felt they were tak
ing away a voice that was ours."
She feels that the paper's
adoption of zoned coverage this
year improved the paper.
"Before they made the change
to local sections, I would've been
unhappy with the local coverage,
but now it's just fine," Baker
said.
Knthusiasm varied
Subscriber enthusiasm about
community news coverage var
ied significantly for different
communities. Residents of
Mountain View were generally
more satisfied with local cover
age than were residents of Palo
Alto and Redwood City. Al
though more than three-fourths
of Mountain View residents
rated the Peninsula Times
Tribune's community coverage
above average, only about one
half of Redwood City residents
and two-thirds of Palo Alto resi
dents felt that the coverage was
superior.
"The Redwood City Tribune
had more complete local news,"
Celeste Depaoli of Redwood
City said. "The new paper got a
little better after the first

month."
However, Richard Mulock of
Palo Alto saw no improvement.
"I don't like it," Mulock said."lt
has been a year and nothing has
really changed in terms of for
mat. It is no longer a local
paper."
Desire for community coverage
There were no significant
changes during the past year in
readers' desire for more com
munity coverage. More than half
of the respondents in the original
and follow-up surveys felt that
their old local paper covered
their community in greater depth
than the new paper. The major
ity also wished that the new
paper would provide a special
section for each of their com
munities.
During the past year.
IhePeninsula Times Tribune has
gained more reader respect.
Three-fourths of the readers
surveyed thought that the Times
was a responsible paper com
pared to only 57 percent who
though so last year. Forty per
cent felt that the merger had re
sulted in a better paper, as com
pared to 32 percent last year.
In short, most readers have
grown used to the Peninsula
Times Tribune during the past
year. Only 20 percent said that
they had not. In addition, the
majority of this year's respon
dents felt that those who comp
lain about the new paper do so
because they are reluctant to ac
cept change.
Miss local papers
Yet while many readers have
grown used to the new paper,
many still miss their old local
papers.
Carolyn Schwartz, of Palo Alto
feels a sense of loss: "1 miss the
old one. It was never a great
paper, but it was ours.'
Herbert Stuart of Redwood
City describes the paradox.
"I've grown used to this paper,
but I do miss the old one," Stuart
said. "I'm happier than I was a
year ago. but I still like the idea
of a hometown paper."

However, Richard Mulock of
Palo Alto saw no improvement.
"I don't like it," Mulock said."lt
has been a year and nothing has
really changed in terms of for

paper."
Desire for community coverage
There were no significant
changes during the past year in
readers' desire for more com
munity coverage. More than half
of the respondents in the original
and follow-up surveys felt that
their old local paper covered
their community in greater depth
than the new paper. The major
ity also wished that the new
paper would provide a special
section for each of their com
munities.
During the past year.
IhePeninsula Times Tribune has
gained more reader respect.
Three-fourths of the readers
surveyed thought that the Times
was a responsible paper com
pared to only 57 percent who
though so last year. Forty per
cent felt that the merger had re
sulted in a better paper, as com
pared to 32 percent last year.
In short, most readers have
grown used to the Peninsula
Times Tribune during the past
year. Only 20 percent said that
they had not. In addition, the
majority of this year's respon
dents felt that those who comp
lain about the new paper do so
because they are reluctant to ac
cept change.
Miss local papers
Yet while many readers have
grown used to the new paper,
many still miss their old local
papers.
Carolyn Schwartz, of Palo Alto
feels a sense of loss: "1 miss the
old one. It was never a great
paper, but it was ours.'
Herbert Stuart of Redwood
City describes the paradox.
"I've grown used to this paper,
but I do miss the old one," Stuart
said. "I'm happier than I was a
year ago. but I still like the idea
of a hometown paper."

During the past year, the
Peninsula Times Tribune has
made some changes in its content
in an effort to satisfy its readers.
Last year, a telephone survey
conducted by a Stanford Univer
sity precision journalism class
showed that the paper's effort to
attract a younger, more mobile
audience had disaffected many
of the old subscribers to the Palo
Alto Times and the Redwood
City Tribune which had merged
to form the Peninsula Times
Tribune April 2, 1979.
At the time, many of the read
ers interviewed complained
about a decrease in the coverage
of their communities as com
pared to the coverage they re
ceived in their old local papers.
This year, a follow-up tele
phone survey was conducted
April 28-May 1 1 to find out if
the same readers who were inter
viewed last year had changed
their opinions of the paper. The
follow-up survey showed that al
though the 280 respondents
from Redwood City. Palo Alto
and Mountain View still felt a
sentimental attachment to the
papers they were receiving be
fore the merget. they generally
preferred the Peninsula Times
Tribune of today to the Penin
sula Times Tribune of a year ago.
Better than after the merger
"It'sdefinitely better than just
after the merger," one Palo Alto
reader said. Although he missed
the Palo Alto Times, he said,
"You have to make way for
progress."
A higher percentage of sub
scribers felt more positive about
the Peninsula Times Tribune's
format and style this year than
they did a year ago. They liked its
organization better, found the
layout more eyecatching, and
thought the writing was more in
teresting than it was in their old
local papers. More readers were
satisfied with the coverage of
their communities and fewer felt
that their old papers were more

personal than the Peninsula
Times Tribune..
Carollee Wheeler, a nurse
from Mountain View, is one
satisfied reader. "I think it's well
laid-out and readable," Wheeler
said. "1 like the writing."
Ratings improved
Subscribers' rating of the
Peninsula Times Tribune's per
formance in covering their com
munities has also improved dur
ing the past year. On a scale of
zero to 1000, the readers gave
community coverage an average
score of 528, as compared with a
score of 442 last year.
Colleen Baker was one Red
wood City resident who sensed a
loss of community coverage
when the papers first merged,
but now feels that coverage has
improved. "Initially, it (the new
paper) was poor because it was
geared to the southern readers,"
Baker said. "Maybe we're pro
vincial. but we felt they were tak
ing away a voice that was ours."
She feels that the paper's
adoption of zoned coverage this
year improved the paper.
"Before they made the change
to local sections, I would've been
unhappy with the local coverage,
but now it's just fine," Baker
said.
Knthusiasm varied
Subscriber enthusiasm about
community news coverage var
ied significantly for different
communities. Residents of
Mountain View were generally
more satisfied with local cover
age than were residents of Palo
Alto and Redwood City. Al
though more than three-fourths
of Mountain View residents
rated the Peninsula Times
Tribune's community coverage
above average, only about one
half of Redwood City residents
and two-thirds of Palo Alto resi
dents felt that the coverage was
superior.
"The Redwood City Tribune
had more complete local news,"
Celeste Depaoli of Redwood
City said. "The new paper got a
little better after the first

month."
However, Richard Mulock of
Palo Alto saw no improvement.
"I don't like it," Mulock said."lt
