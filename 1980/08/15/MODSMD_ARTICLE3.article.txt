### Edward Asiano Staff Writer 
A 19-month long search for
the top post at the Medical
Center may soon come to an end.
The vice-president of medical
affairs position was vacated on
Jan. 1, 1979. when Dr. Clayton
Rich stepped down. Rich left amid
controversy, offering an "oppor
tunity for new leadership."
The search has been on since
that time. "I'm optimistic that
within a couple of weeks a deci
sion will he forthcoming." said
President Donald Kennedy.
The decision will be Ken
nedy's first major appointment
since he accepted the helm from
Richard Lyman on Aug. 1. It
may becoming not a moment too
soon.

Last April, Acting Vice Presi
dent Lawrence Crowley told the
University he would resign from
his interim position on Aug. 31 if
a permanent chief had not been
named.
Crowley noted many prob
lems, short and long-term, face
the Medical Center in the com
ing months. "I believe (these
problems) must be properly and
resolutely addressed by someone
in a confirmed leadership role
rather than by an individual in a
continuing acting capacity," he
said.
Crowley, feeling the frustra
tions of a "lame duck" situation,
made it clear in a letter to the
University that he remained a
candidate for the permanent job.
Declining to comment on the

matter, Crowley's staff has con
firmed he intends a vacation
Sept. 1.
The impending resignation
puts added pressure on Ken
nedy, who admits, "there is
abundant pressure from all
sides." If the appointment is not
made by the end of the month,
Kennedy said he would be. "on
the spot to appoint another act
ing vice-president in the in
terim." The search "has gone on
too long," he added.
Why has it taken so long? A
search committee, headed by Dr.
Thomas Merigan, chairman of
the Infectious Diseases Depart
ment, and composed of Medical
School professors, a local sur
