## movies/mike lopez â€˜No Nukes' movie reminiscent of Woodstock 
### 
The "No Nukes Concerts" oc
curred in Neu York Citv (Madi
son Square Garden) between
September 19 and 23. 1979. just
over 10 years after Woodstock
took place in upstate New York.
The No Nukes mo\ ie opened
almost 10 years, to the day. after
the Woodstock movie. The
similarities do not end there.
Like Woodstock, No Nukes is
a 70-30 mix of music and
documentary material. There
are numerous scenes of rock
stars doing perfectly normal
things (thus removing or adding
to their mystique), and perfectly
normal people doing crazy
things. And also like Woodstock,
there is a great deal of superb
music in a political environment.
Even if you are pro-nuke, you
can still enjoy this movie. Unlike
Woodstock, we all knew that
there would be great perfor
mances as witnessed on the No
Nukes album which was released
last year. The disappointment in
the movie is that we do not get to
see all the great songs from that
album. There is a stark omis
sion of "Stav" as performed bv

Jackson Browne and Bruce
Springsteen. M> only guess is
that Maurice Williams (the orig
inal artist) wanted too much
money. In addition, the Bruce
Springsteen's encore standard
"Good Golly Mis> Molly Devil
With The Blue Dress" originally
done by Mitch R\der and the
Detroit Wheels, is not included.
The movie highlights the
prime organizers of MUSE
(Musicians United for Safe
Energy). Bonnie Raitt. John
Hall. Jackson Browne and
Graham Nash with the Doobie
Brothers. James Taylor, Carly
Simon and Jessie Colin Young as
prime accessories. /Ml of these
artists turn excellent perfor
mances with Raitt doing
"Runaway," James Taylor and
Carly Simon singing "Moc
kingbird" and later with John
Hall and Graham Nash doing
Bob Dylan's "The Times Are 'A
Changin.' " Graham Nash had
two solos with "Our House" and
"Barrel of Pain" as did Bruce
Springsteen with "The River (ti
tle cut from his yet-to-be re

leased album), and the always
moving "Thunder Road."
For this reviewer, the high
lights were some of the
backstage scenes, the reunited
Crosby. Stills and Nash singing
"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes," the
above-mentioned "Thunder
Road" and subsequent Bruce
Springsteen encore piece which
goes beyond description.
Jackson Browne's "Running On
Empty" and Gil Scott-Heron's
ballad based on the unpublicized
near-melt down near Detroit in
the late '60s entitled "We Al
most Lost Detroit."
To answer your other ques
tions, the answer is yes. The
Doobie Brothers do their hits in
quality fashion including "De

pending on You," "What A Fool
Believes" and a big finale ver
sion with everyone singing "Ta
kin' It To The Streets."
Ralph Nader and Jane Fonda
appear at the open concert/rally
which was held several days after
the concerts.
And Jessie Colin Young
would not be there if he could
not sing "Let's Get Together," so
he did.
Finally, this movie provides a
good 10-year retrospect for
those who were intimately in
volved with the late '60s and
early '70s. The film shows that
time rav ages all, including musi
cians. A clear example is how
Crosby, Stills and Nash, once the
crow n princes of Woodstock Na

tion, have evolved into the com
placency of the '70s. Stephen
Stills looks like that guy you
knew in high school that you al
ways avoided except he's middle
aged. David Crosby can't sing
"Almost C'ut My Hair" because
he is losing his own. All the fire
of an earlier time has become hot
coals, but at least they're still ac
tive. Put that in your reactor and
smoke it.
Despite the ommission of any
black artist solos (except for Gil
Scott-Heron), and various songs
from the earlier-released album,
the film is a success. Excellent
editing, magnificent sound,
stunning performances and just
enough politics to get their mes
sage across.
