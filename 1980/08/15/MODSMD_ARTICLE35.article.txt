## Sellers' 'Dr. Fu Manchu’: pathetically unfunny 
### 
Peter Sellers has always been a favorite
actor of mine. Not only did he have a
genius for flawlessly portraying even the
most outrageous characters, hut his sense
of comedy made some of his films among
the funniest films ever made.
This makes Sellers' last film. The Fien
dish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, especially
pathetic. It is terribly unfunny. In fact,
there is not one good joke or funny scene
in the entire film.
Of course, some people might disagree.
However, I doubt many people will laugh
at a completely gratuitous scene involving
a fat man eating like a pig. Nor will many
laugh at characters just because they have
names like Dr. Wretch or Constable
Groin.
There is also an FBI agent named
Capone (ha-ha) who tries to be funny by

referring to "chinks" and by using indeli
cate turns of phrase like "ballbuster" or
"pissed off," as in "J. Edgar is pissed off."
Ha-ha. And there is a British inspector
from Scotland Yard who steps in the way
of a lawn sprinkler and gets the crotch of
his pants wet. Ha-ha-ha.
Although some people might disagree,
nobody in the audience laughed during
the screening I saw. Considering it was a
weekday matinee (the things I go through
for this paper) and the average age of the
audience was 14, it appears that the movie
fails even before the least discerning
movie-goer.
Admittedly it is never important in this
kind of movie, hut even the plot is boring.
The 168-year old Dr. Fu Manchu needs
canary yellow diamonds to concoct his

elixer vitae — his immortality potion. His
agents steal a gem from a Washington
museum (hence the FBI agent) and pur
sue an identical gem among the British
crown jewels by kidnapping the King and
Queen of England (hence everybody
else). Each attempt is more inept and less
funny than its precursor.
Peter Sellers plays two roles. He plays
Dr. Fu Manchu ("Fred" to his friends)
and he plays a retired Scotland Yard in
spector emotionally attached to a lawn
mower, who (the inspector, not the
mower) thwarts each of the evil Dr.'s
plans to steal the diamond. Sellers' per
formances are adequate, but neither role
allows him to display his talents for
characterization or comedy. Neither role
is at .til funnv.

Sid Caesar plays FBl's Capone. He was
supposed to have been hilarious on televi
sion in the '50s. Since that was before my
time 1 had always taken that on faith. I am
beginning to have my doubts.
This movie has outraged members of
the Asian-American community because
of its offensive ethnic stereotyping and
insulting racial references. I honestly was
not offended by this (then again, it's not
my race or ethnicity), but 1 have always
been disappointed by ethnic humor of any
sort. It is usually a cheap talentless try to
get laughs, much like jokes about flatu
lence. Both are terribly embarrassing and
rarely funny. Fortunately, Fu Manchu is
such a terrible movie that it may be a long
while before another insulting movie
comes alone.
