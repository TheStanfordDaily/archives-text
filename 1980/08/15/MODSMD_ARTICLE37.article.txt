# Costello unpredictable as ever
## 
### 
FN is Costello has always been
prolific. El\is Costello has al
ways been creative. Yet how can
he follow up an excellent album.
Get Happy!! which was actually
closer tii a double album with 20
songs crammed onto a single
disc, with a slew of singles and
Ip's that contain new and good
material? (ep: extended plav:
somewhere between a "Double
Single" and a "Mini-Album";
record companies ha\e always
been prolific, though not always
this creative.) When he is going
to bum out? ask the cynics.
The two ep's under discussion
here. Hi-Fidelity and New
Amsterdam, both begin with
their title songs which came from
Get Happy!! — but it is the new
material that is really of interest
because, for the first time in his
career, Elvis is producing his
own music.
Lowe-less
Nick Lowe. Elvis' producer in
the past and the producer again
of the two album cuts, has a
strong distinctively rich pop style
that has for the most part shar
pened both Elvis' music and his

concepts, but it has also dulled
the music at times, leaving El\is
adrift in the kind of "pure pop"
morass that Lowe himself favors.
It's nice to hear unadulterated
Costello. and his own production
is accordingly both sparser and
more eccentric, especially on
"Dr. Luther's Assistant" and
"Ghost Train." both from New
Amsterdam: strange sounds and
unidentifiable instruments surge
over and under chunky, almost
clumsy rhythms; it's different, in
the most positive, non
euphemistic sense of the word,
for these songs are equal to Elvis'
best work.
Ballads
The ep's also contains two bal
lads, "Just a Memory" and a new
slower version of Get Happy!?%
"Clown Time is Over," plus a
cover version of Van McCoy's
"Getting Mighty Crowded" — a
good standard type of rocker
that Elvis usually stays away
from. "Just a Memory" is proba
bly one of the worst things he's
ever done lyrically, but it is at the
same time, interestingly enough,
one of the best examples of Elvis'

abilities as a vocalist.
Crude sound
There is a crude sound to these
records (available as of vet only
as imports) and perhaps the
songs were not as well thought
out as those on his Ip's. (Elvis is
one of the most cerebral of all
rock and rollers), but there is
also a freshness and an inven
tiveness that bodes well for Elvis'
next musical outburst.
