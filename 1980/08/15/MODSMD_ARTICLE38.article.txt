### 
Just A Kiss A way:A Forecast for Romance, an
original multimedia revue exploring modern at
titudes toward romance in dance, film and popular
music, will be presented tonight, August 15 and 16
at 8:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Through the juxtaposition of classical and mod
ern music, the revue contrasts traditional and con
temporary notions of love relationships.
The show will be performed by the Stanford Jazz
Core, a 15-member troupe of Stanford and Bay
Area dancers. The Jazz Core was formed in 1979
by Marilyn Rosenberg and Jim Sakamoto, who
taught jazz dance classes at Stanford over the past
year.
Along the lines of Beatlemania, Just A Kiss A way

combines dance and vocals against a backdrop of
multimedia images. These images were designed
by Rex Sterns, a UCLA graduate student in film.
The multimedia effects will complement the
show's songs,.by Carly Simon, the Rolling Stones,
Joe Jackson and others.
Dancing to these songs will be MGM Grand
performer William Strickland, along with members
of both The Company and Ram's Head.
Vocalists will include musicians from the popu
lar band Rooftop Magic, Counterpoint director,
Joyce Rogers and Company star Daniel Gunther.
Just A Kiss Way is just a few days away! Tickets,
for $3, are at BASS now.


Dancers from Just \ Kiss Away leap in rehearsal for their first
performance. The show, directed by Marilyn Rosenberg, opens to
night at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
