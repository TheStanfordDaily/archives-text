Bringing Up Baby if if-kit
Festival, Palo Alio
One of the great American direc
tors — Howard Hawks — directed
two of the great American actors
Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn
— in one of the great American com
edies.
Hepburn is a screwball heiress.
Grant is a paleontologist. Baby is a
leopard. A celebration of joyous in
sanity.
Plays with The Philadelphia Story.
—Jim Mattson
The Philadelphia Story if if if if
Festival, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people who at
tempt to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadephia Story is
a thinly veiled, filmed stage play and
yet it's also an exceedingly entertain
ing movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing this
production to the screen. The director
was George Cukor, a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine performances
out of seemingly any actor. And the
actors are by no means ordinary: the
cast features Katharine Hepburn, nos
trils flaring and indignation aflame;
Cary Grant, comic sense perfectly in
tune; and James Stewart, drunkenly
singing "Over the Rainbow" as if he'd
stake his reputation on it.
Plays with Bringing Up Baby.

Orson Welles once said, "It I were
Renoir, I probably wouldn't like my
pictures, cither." If we were Hitch
cock, we probably wouldn't like Dres
sed To Kill. But we aren't, and there's
no reason we shouldn't enjoy this de
rivative little thriller. Director Brian
DePalma has his own style, if not his
own ideas, and he always keeps our
interest.
Watching DTK without having seen
Psycho is a bit like reading Ulysses
without having read the Odyssey —
you'll miss some of the finer points,
but you'll have a great time anyway.
—Mike Hale
The Blues Brothers Movie ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruc
tion. which admittedly isn't easy, you
will find a funny, well-conceived
movie. John Landis (director. Animal
House) directs and co-wrote the script
with Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of
good music and entertaining dancing,
but possibly the most enjoyable part is
just watching Aykroyd and John Be
lushi (Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues)
do their stuff. *
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.
—Peter Finch
Airplane if
Menlo, Menlo Park
From most of the people who
brought you Kentucky Fried Movie
comes this disappointing and largely
unfunny parody of disaster films.
There arc about a million and a half
jokes in this one — unfortunately,
only about eight or nine of them are
funny. Peter Graves, Kareem Abdul
Jabbar and a whole host of non
comedians are the non-stars.
—P.F.

Bread and Chocolate ★★★
Laurel, San Carlos
A bittersweet, funny comedy about
an Italian immigrant who is battered
by the system when he tries to make a
go of it in Switzerland's promised
land. This movie has a wit and warmth
to it which make it eminently watcha
ble. Nino Manfredi, as the immigrant,
has one of those gifted faces which can
make anything seem either funny or
tragic. Anna Kanna is fine as an im
migrant from Greece; Franco Brusati
directed.
Plays with Cousin, Cousine next
Monday and Tuesday.
—J.M.
Notorious if if if if
Laurel, San Carlos
A spy story done with the grace and
wit of Restoration comedy; it is among
the most beautifully crafted films of
the genre. It is a film of gleaming sur
faces shown in caressing closeups:
wine bottles, teacups and keys all take
on a sheen of intrigue. Cary Grant
plays an American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude Rains;
the device he uses is Ingrid Bergman.
The irony is that Rains engages our
sympathies more than Grant does —
be is the member of the triangle who
knows the least and whose love is most
sincere.
Plays with North by Northwest,
Sunday only.

Being There if if if if
Sequoia Fox, Redwood City
Hal Ashby (Coming Home, Harold
and Maude) directed this affecting,
gentle satire about a man whose inno
cence becomes a valuable commodity.
The late Peter Sellers plays Chance
the gardener; his performance may
have been his best since he played
Quilty in Kubrick's Lolita.
Being There is so tied to Chance's
deadpan, simplemindedly literal
world-view that the audience leaves
the theater a little dazed — our
thought processes have begun to slow
and stretch to match his. Shirley Mac-
Laine and Melvyn Douglas (who won
an Oscar for his efforts) turn in fine
supporting characterizations.
Plays with The Mouse That Roared,
Tuesday and Wednesday.

La Cage Aux Folles if if if
Fine Arts, Palo Alto
When your future father-in-law is
the Undersecretary for Public Moral
ity, how do you explain the six-foot
dildo in your living room? Or the
fishnet stockings on the butler? Or
your mother's beard?
A Guess Who's Corping To Dinner
for the '70s, but much funnier and
much less offensive. Ugo Tognazzi
and Michel Serrault star. See it soin,
before the print falls apart.
—M.H.

The Blue Lagoon
Old Mill, Mountain View
Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned alone
in a tropical paradise, they take years
to figure out the finer points that most
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randal Kleiser
(Grease) has seen to it that there's
something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't acting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas
kets; he spears fish and thinks) they're
being theatened by natives straight
out of a '40s jungle movie. A movie
for dullards and child molesters.
—J.M.
Norma Rae ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this industrial
drama about a woman who fights to
have a union put in the textile mill
where she works. Sally Field gives an
assured and very likeable perfor
mance as Norma Rae; her days as the
"Flying Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her Southern
accented, rolling-gaited character.
This is a "small" movie in the same
way that An Unmarried Woman was
small — the emphasis is more on
characterization than on action. Ron
Leibman co-stars.
Plays with All That Jazz, Saturday
through Monday.
—J.M

My Brilliant Carter ★★★
Aquarius, Falo Alio
Judy Davis gives a fine performance
as a young Australian woman with
literary ambitions forced to choose be
tween a rich husband and life on a
rather squalid sheep ranch. Her choice
is more difficult than one might think,
because it is dictated by nothing less
than service to art. The movie suffers a
little from its own good intentions —
in trying not to be "feminist," it leaves
the motives underlying her decision
anything but clear. Davis' portrayal of
a woman far ahead of her time, and
much gorgeous Australian scenery,
happily drive considerations of plot
from our minds.
Flays with Why Shoot The Teacher.
— M.H.
Wise Blood ★★★★
Los Gains, Los Gatos
The dream of two recent Harvard
grads comes to the screen, and is the
most pleasant surprise of the year.
John Huston directed this adapta
tion of Flannery O'Connor's first
novel. The movie's strongest point is
that it stays largely faithful to the spirit
of O'Connor's fiction What we see is
unremittingly fantastic, a nightmare
world peopled with moral grotesques
— yet somewhere, up there on the
screen, we can see ourselves, too.
Brad Dourif gives a remarkable
performance as Hazel Motes, just out
of Ihe army and determined to start his
own church — The Church of God
Without Jesus Christ. His rise and fall
are truly compelling.
—M.H.
North By Northwest ★★★★
Laurel, San Carlos
Cary Grant runs — from cars, crop
dusters, trains, across fields and under
Lincoln's nose. Lincoln's nose? Well,
don't believe everything you see. Al
though never scary, this is Hitchcock's
most exhilarating movie. The action
never stops, as Grant, a mild
mannered advertising executive who
was just going to the men's room, ends
up on a wild chase half-way across the
country. For company he has Eva
Marie Saint, almost as icy as Grace
Kelley — but then, don't believe ev
erything you see.
Plays with Notorious, Sunday only.
—M.H.
The Empire Strikes Back It ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything has be
come deadly serious — bigger,
splashier, but dull. All of the old per
formers are back, bi/t the best perfor
mance is given by a green-skinned
Muppet creature who, for a moment,
manages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation. The movie's ending is the
biggest letdown of all — jeepers,
George, couldn't you come up with
something better than that after three
years of work?

Laurel, San Carlos
A bittersweet, funny comedy about
an Italian immigrant who is battered
by the system when he tries to make a

Laurel, San Carlos
A spy story done with the grace and
wit of Restoration comedy; it is among
the most beautifully crafted films of
the genre. It is a film of gleaming sur
faces shown in caressing closeups:
wine bottles, teacups and keys all take
on a sheen of intrigue. Cary Grant
plays an American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude Rains;
the device he uses is Ingrid Bergman.
The irony is that Rains engages our
sympathies more than Grant does —
be is the member of the triangle who
knows the least and whose love is most
sincere.

gentle satire about a man whose inno

The late Peter Sellers plays Chance
the gardener; his performance may
have been his best since he played
Quilty in Kubrick's Lolita.
Being There is so tied to Chance's
deadpan, simplemindedly literal
world-view that the audience leaves
the theater a little dazed — our

Norma Rae ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this industrial

assured and very likeable perfor

"Flying Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her Southern
accented, rolling-gaited character.

characterization than on action. Ron

My Brilliant Carter ★★★
Aquarius, Falo Alio
Judy Davis gives a fine performance
as a young Australian woman with
literary ambitions forced to choose be
tween a rich husband and life on a
rather squalid sheep ranch. Her choice
is more difficult than one might think,
because it is dictated by nothing less
than service to art. The movie suffers a
little from its own good intentions —
in trying not to be "feminist," it leaves
the motives underlying her decision
anything but clear. Davis' portrayal of
a woman far ahead of her time, and
much gorgeous Australian scenery,
happily drive considerations of plot
from our minds.

The solution can only be found in

was George Cukor, a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine performances
out of seemingly any actor. And the
actors are by no means ordinary: the
cast features Katharine Hepburn, nos

Cary Grant, comic sense perfectly in

Quilty in Kubrick's Lolita.
Being There is so tied to Chance's
deadpan, simplemindedly literal
world-view that the audience leaves

thought processes have begun to slow

Brooke Shields and Christopher
Atkins star as the world's most dim
witted teenagers — marooned alone
in a tropical paradise, they take years
to figure out the finer points that most
six-year-olds in the audience grasp
immediately. Director Randal Kleiser

something here to offend everyone.
When the two kids aren't acting
stereotyped sex roles (she braids bas

Norma Rae ★ ★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Martin Ritt directed this industrial
drama about a woman who fights to
have a union put in the textile mill
where she works. Sally Field gives an
assured and very likeable perfor
mance as Norma Rae; her days as the
"Flying Nun" seem far behind as she
breathes life into her Southern
accented, rolling-gaited character.
This is a "small" movie in the same
way that An Unmarried Woman was
small — the emphasis is more on
characterization than on action. Ron
Leibman co-stars.
Plays with All That Jazz, Saturday
through Monday.

My Brilliant Carter ★★★
Aquarius, Falo Alio
Judy Davis gives a fine performance
as a young Australian woman with
literary ambitions forced to choose be
tween a rich husband and life on a
rather squalid sheep ranch. Her choice
is more difficult than one might think,
because it is dictated by nothing less
than service to art. The movie suffers a
little from its own good intentions —
in trying not to be "feminist," it leaves
the motives underlying her decision
anything but clear. Davis' portrayal of
a woman far ahead of her time, and
much gorgeous Australian scenery,
happily drive considerations of plot
from our minds.
Flays with Why Shoot The Teacher.

Wise Blood ★★★★
Los Gains, Los Gatos
The dream of two recent Harvard
grads comes to the screen, and is the
most pleasant surprise of the year.
John Huston directed this adapta
tion of Flannery O'Connor's first
novel. The movie's strongest point is
that it stays largely faithful to the spirit
of O'Connor's fiction What we see is
unremittingly fantastic, a nightmare
world peopled with moral grotesques
— yet somewhere, up there on the
screen, we can see ourselves, too.
Brad Dourif gives a remarkable
performance as Hazel Motes, just out
of Ihe army and determined to start his
own church — The Church of God
Without Jesus Christ. His rise and fall
are truly compelling.

North By Northwest ★★★★
Laurel, San Carlos
Cary Grant runs — from cars, crop
dusters, trains, across fields and under
Lincoln's nose. Lincoln's nose? Well,
don't believe everything you see. Al
though never scary, this is Hitchcock's
most exhilarating movie. The action
never stops, as Grant, a mild
mannered advertising executive who
was just going to the men's room, ends
up on a wild chase half-way across the
country. For company he has Eva
Marie Saint, almost as icy as Grace
Kelley — but then, don't believe ev

The Empire Strikes Back It ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even more
spectacular than before, but this
sequel to Star Wars has lost most of its
sense of humor. Everything has be
come deadly serious — bigger,
splashier, but dull. All of the old per
formers are back, bi/t the best perfor
mance is given by a green-skinned
Muppet creature who, for a moment,
manages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation. The movie's ending is the
biggest letdown of all — jeepers,
George, couldn't you come up with
something better than that after three
years of work?

Bringing Up Baby if if-kit
Festival, Palo Alio
One of the great American direc

two of the great American actors
Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn
— in one of the great American com
edies.
Hepburn is a screwball heiress.
Grant is a paleontologist. Baby is a
leopard. A celebration of joyous in
sanity.
Plays with The Philadelphia Story.

The Philadelphia Story if if if if
Festival, Palo Alto
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people who at
tempt to define what is and what isn't
"cinematic." The Philadephia Story is
a thinly veiled, filmed stage play and
yet it's also an exceedingly entertain
ing movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing this
production to the screen. The director
was George Cukor, a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine performances
out of seemingly any actor. And the
actors are by no means ordinary: the
cast features Katharine Hepburn, nos
trils flaring and indignation aflame;
Cary Grant, comic sense perfectly in
tune; and James Stewart, drunkenly
singing "Over the Rainbow" as if he'd
stake his reputation on it.

Orson Welles once said, "It I were

cock, we probably wouldn't like Dres
sed To Kill. But we aren't, and there's
no reason we shouldn't enjoy this de
rivative little thriller. Director Brian
DePalma has his own style, if not his
own ideas, and he always keeps our
interest.
Watching DTK without having seen
Psycho is a bit like reading Ulysses
without having read the Odyssey —
you'll miss some of the finer points,
but you'll have a great time anyway.

The Blues Brothers Movie ★★★
Bijou, Palo Alto
If you can look past the ridiculous
amount of money spent on destruc

will find a funny, well-conceived
movie. John Landis (director. Animal
House) directs and co-wrote the script
with Dan Aykroyd. There's plenty of
good music and entertaining dancing,
but possibly the most enjoyable part is
just watching Aykroyd and John Be
lushi (Elwood and Joliet Jake Blues)
do their stuff. *
Definitely not a movie to go home
and think about — but then it doesn't
pretend to be.

From most of the people who

Laurel, San Carlos
A bittersweet, funny comedy about
an Italian immigrant who is battered
by the system when he tries to make a
go of it in Switzerland's promised
land. This movie has a wit and warmth
to it which make it eminently watcha
ble. Nino Manfredi, as the immigrant,
has one of those gifted faces which can
make anything seem either funny or
tragic. Anna Kanna is fine as an im
migrant from Greece; Franco Brusati
directed.

Notorious if if if if
Laurel, San Carlos
A spy story done with the grace and
wit of Restoration comedy; it is among
the most beautifully crafted films of
the genre. It is a film of gleaming sur
faces shown in caressing closeups:
wine bottles, teacups and keys all take
on a sheen of intrigue. Cary Grant
plays an American agent who must
find out the secrets of Claude Rains;
the device he uses is Ingrid Bergman.
The irony is that Rains engages our
sympathies more than Grant does —
be is the member of the triangle who
knows the least and whose love is most
sincere.
