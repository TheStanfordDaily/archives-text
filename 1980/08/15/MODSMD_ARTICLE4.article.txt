# How much does it hurt?
## Pac-10 suspensions debated; Muncie draws Cal into probe 
### Peter Steinerman Assistant News Editor 
The recently announced in
eligibility of five teams in the
Pacific-10 from post-season ac
tion will not have as serious ef
fects on the future of the confer
ence as many had originally be
lieved, according to many athle
tic officials close to the situation.
The five schools — USC,
Arizona State, UCLA, Oregon,
and Oregon State — were cited
Monday for transcript falsifica
tions and other academic ir
regularities among members of
their football teams. The ruling
stated, however, that all confer
ence games played during the
1980 season will count in the
standings and in the determina
tion of the conference champ
ionship.
In a recent development,
former Cal running back Chuck
Muncie denied allegations yes
terday that he was even enrolled
at the University of Santa Clara
for which he was given credit at
UC-Berkeley even though he
reportedly never attended the

courses. Muncie, a running back
for the New Orleans Saints,
graduated Cal in 1976. Officials
reached at Pac-10 headquarters
promised an immediate investi
gation into the matter.
Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger predicted that the
effect of the ban would have a
"constructive and positive" ef
fect on the conference, and that
the football season would not be
changed "measurably" because of
it. The Cardinals, he com
mented, would not ''single-out"
any opposing team because of
their eligibility status for post
season play.
Geiger added, however, that
the Conference members "are
all anxious to get (the issue) be
hind us."
Additional penalties were
leveled by the Pac-10 executives
on Oregon, which suffered a re
duction of its initial grants-in-aid
in football. In addition, the
school was placed on probation
for two years, at which time its
athletic program would be re
viewed and a decision made as to

whether or not to continue the
probation. During the term of
probation, the football program
will be placed under especially
close scrutiny, undergoing fre
quent audits and inspections to
be initiated by the conference's
Executive Director.
Oregon football coach Rich
Brooks explained that his team
had simply been accused of more
violations, but refused to elabo
rate further. He predicted that
the penalties would not bring
about a death-blow to Oregon's
athletic program.
Brooks commented that it is
not possible to appeal the penal
ties within the conference, and
that he had accepted full respon
sibility for all the transgressions
that iiad occurred during his
term as coach. Brooks and other
members of the coaching stall
had received letters of re
primand from the university's
administration, in addition to
forfeiting their contractual pay
raises for the upcoming year.
Pac-10 spokesman Jim Mul
doon commented that Oregon

had been the target of the severe
penalties because the conference
had uncovered a longer pattern
of transcript fraud and of players
accumulating unearned credits
than those at other schools. Mul
doon added that Oregon was the
only school that had been found
awarding unearned credits in the
recruitment of freshmen who
were entering the athletic prog
rams there — other schools were
simply maintaining their
athletes' status on the teams.
Muldoon, Public Information
Director for the Pac-1 0, said the
athletic programs of all 10
schools had been under investi
gation since late October. The
decision to ban half the teams
from post-season play had been
made unanimously by a commit
tee comprised of the presidents
and chancellors ol the member
schools, on the recommendation
from the universities' athletic di
rectors and faculty representa
tives.
"It did not matter how many
students were involved," Mul
doon pointed out. "One or six or

twenty — it was not a factor in
the decisions."
Muldoon added that neither
Pac-10 nor the NCAA had
brought television sanctions
against the five schools. He
commented, however, that
ABC-TV, the network which
normally provides coverage lor
such events, might question the
desirability of broadcasting
games between teams that have
been excluded from the Rose
Bowl race.
He commented that the penal
ties were "one of the best things
ever to happen to the confer
ence," adding that in the long
term it would serve to strengthen
it."The next season will he a lit
tle strange, though," Muldoon
admitted.
Meanwhile, reactions to the
recent decision by players here
have been a niixtuc of disillu
sionment. disdain and surprise.
Halfback Darrin Nelson, who
will be entering his junior year
here, commented that "we still
have to beat all those teams to go
to the Rose Bowl . . but, some
how, it isn't going to be the
same,"
"I can see USC saying 'well,
we just didn't have the incentive'
it we ever beat them," he added.
Doug Rogers, who plays de
fensive end, responded a little
more confidently.
"It still doesn't affect our play
ing. It's like the game we played
with Arizona State last year. We
knew that we would probably be
given the game but we played to
win anyway."
Rogers added, however, that
he was "really disappointed" by
the behavior of the penalized
teams.
The Associated Press has
rated the season now a "two

and Washington, and considers
Cal as being an outside shot.

ever to happen to the confer
ence," adding that in the long
term it would serve to strengthen
it."The next season will he a lit
tle strange, though," Muldoon
admitted.
Meanwhile, reactions to the
recent decision by players here
have been a niixtuc of disillu
sionment. disdain and surprise.
Halfback Darrin Nelson, who
will be entering his junior year
here, commented that "we still
have to beat all those teams to go
to the Rose Bowl . . but, some
how, it isn't going to be the
same,"
"I can see USC saying 'well,
we just didn't have the incentive'
it we ever beat them," he added.
Doug Rogers, who plays de
fensive end, responded a little
more confidently.
"It still doesn't affect our play
ing. It's like the game we played
with Arizona State last year. We
knew that we would probably be
given the game but we played to
win anyway."
Rogers added, however, that
he was "really disappointed" by
the behavior of the penalized
teams.
The Associated Press has
rated the season now a "two
team race" between Stanford
and Washington, and considers
Cal as being an outside shot.
The recently announced in
eligibility of five teams in the
Pacific-10 from post-season ac
tion will not have as serious ef
fects on the future of the confer
ence as many had originally be
lieved, according to many athle
tic officials close to the situation.
The five schools — USC,
Arizona State, UCLA, Oregon,
and Oregon State — were cited
Monday for transcript falsifica
tions and other academic ir
regularities among members of
their football teams. The ruling
stated, however, that all confer
ence games played during the
1980 season will count in the
standings and in the determina
tion of the conference champ
ionship.
In a recent development,
former Cal running back Chuck
Muncie denied allegations yes
terday that he was even enrolled
at the University of Santa Clara
for which he was given credit at
UC-Berkeley even though he
reportedly never attended the

courses. Muncie, a running back
for the New Orleans Saints,
graduated Cal in 1976. Officials
reached at Pac-10 headquarters
promised an immediate investi
gation into the matter.
Stanford Athletic Director
Andy Geiger predicted that the
effect of the ban would have a
"constructive and positive" ef
fect on the conference, and that
the football season would not be
changed "measurably" because of
it. The Cardinals, he com
mented, would not ''single-out"
any opposing team because of
their eligibility status for post
season play.
Geiger added, however, that
the Conference members "are
all anxious to get (the issue) be
hind us."
Additional penalties were
leveled by the Pac-10 executives
on Oregon, which suffered a re
duction of its initial grants-in-aid
in football. In addition, the
school was placed on probation
for two years, at which time its
athletic program would be re
viewed and a decision made as to

whether or not to continue the
probation. During the term of
probation, the football program
will be placed under especially
close scrutiny, undergoing fre
quent audits and inspections to
be initiated by the conference's
Executive Director.
Oregon football coach Rich
Brooks explained that his team
had simply been accused of more
violations, but refused to elabo
rate further. He predicted that
the penalties would not bring
about a death-blow to Oregon's
athletic program.
Brooks commented that it is
not possible to appeal the penal
ties within the conference, and
that he had accepted full respon
sibility for all the transgressions
that iiad occurred during his
term as coach. Brooks and other
members of the coaching stall
had received letters of re
primand from the university's
administration, in addition to
forfeiting their contractual pay
raises for the upcoming year.
Pac-10 spokesman Jim Mul
doon commented that Oregon

had been the target of the severe
penalties because the conference
had uncovered a longer pattern
of transcript fraud and of players
accumulating unearned credits
than those at other schools. Mul
doon added that Oregon was the
only school that had been found
awarding unearned credits in the
recruitment of freshmen who
were entering the athletic prog
rams there — other schools were
simply maintaining their
athletes' status on the teams.
Muldoon, Public Information
Director for the Pac-1 0, said the
athletic programs of all 10
schools had been under investi
gation since late October. The
decision to ban half the teams
from post-season play had been
made unanimously by a commit
tee comprised of the presidents
and chancellors ol the member
schools, on the recommendation
from the universities' athletic di
rectors and faculty representa
tives.
"It did not matter how many
students were involved," Mul
doon pointed out. "One or six or

twenty — it was not a factor in
the decisions."
Muldoon added that neither
Pac-10 nor the NCAA had
brought television sanctions
against the five schools. He
commented, however, that
ABC-TV, the network which
normally provides coverage lor
such events, might question the
desirability of broadcasting
games between teams that have
been excluded from the Rose
Bowl race.
He commented that the penal
ties were "one of the best things
ever to happen to the confer

term it would serve to strengthen
it."The next season will he a lit
