CAPTAIN'S CABIN
SEAFOOD GROTTO
3295 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-8233
Sheltered behind a screen of
vegetation on El Camino Real,
the Captain's Cabin Seafood
Grotto offers a wide variety of
fi>h. shellfish and steaks. Its
wooden doors lead into a warm
friendly interior with an open-air
patio at the far end. The tables
and chairs were imported from
Thailand by Thai owner and chef
Den Pajnamat.
Before owning the Captain's
Cabin. Den was a chef at Trader
Vic's and the Mark Hopkins in
San Francisco. Den takes a
strong personal interest in his re
staurant. often working between
eight and 12 hours a day.
As we pondered the wine list,
our waiter brought us warm
sourdough French bread and
whipped butter. The list pro
vided an adequate selection but a
wine enthusiast might have been
disappointed at its length. It of
fered 10 California white wines,
eight French wines and included
the popular French Pouilly
Fuisse and the German Lieb
raumilch. One rose, three or four
reds and four champagnes, all
domestic, completed the list.

Prices of the wine range from
$fi for a California Chenin Blanc
to $17.25 for the Pouilly Fuisse.
We selected a bottle of Macon
Blanc ($8.50) and were de
lighted with our choice. It was a
moderately dry white wine that
provided a counterpoint to the
sweet freshness of the fish.
The dinner menu includes four
types of entrees: grilled, deep
fried, charcoal broiled and sea
food preparations such as fish
stew bordelaise. They range in
price from $5.50 to $12.95.
Before making a final deci
sion, one should consider the
four or five specials posted on
the board at the entrance. They
change daily, depending on the
available fish. We were disap
pointed, however, that the
kitchen was unable to provide
the stuffed sole special listed on
the board.
Our meal began with a fresh
prawn cocktail ($3.95) that con
sisted of four large prawns dip
ped in a spicy cocktail sauce. The
steamed clams bordelaise ap
petizer ($5.95) arrives steaming
from the stove in a large
aluminum pot. It is enough to
dent a hearty appetite.
The Boston clam chowder
($1.10) was very thick and but

tery. The consistency is not
achieved with an overdose of
potatoes, nor with a milk and
flour thickening. The chef uses
only cream in this soup and it
must be cooked long and care
fully. The chowder is a "must" at
the Captain's Cabin.
The King salmon special
($8.95) arrived with a scoop of
potatoes au gratin and a small
bowl of buttered broccoli. The
potatoes were too dry and the
broccoli was slightly over
cooked. but one taste of the sal
mon removed all dissatisfaction.
The tangy white sauce included
artichokes, capers and Bay
shrimp. The salmon itself was
cooked to firmness, but it re
tained its juices and its sweet
ness.
Together the salmon and
sauce achived a perfectly ba
lanced blend of flavors. In addi
tion, the portion was generous
enough to satisfy a moderate
eater even without an appetizer.
Seafood cannelloni ($7.75) is
a thoughtfully prepared combi
nation of fresh crab, shrimp and
scallops in a mornay sauce co
vered with a smooth blanket of
melted jack cheese. The mornay
sauce joined the flavors of the
three meats successfully with a
light, controlled touch of tomato.
The melted jack cheese topping
just began to crisp around the
edges of the dish but the whole
affair was allowed to cool to a
perfect temperature before
being served. It was .a resounding
success.
The entree came with a small
portion of vegetables and a
mound of rice pilaf. But it is ob

vious that the specialty of the
Captain's Cabin is its excellent
fish and shellfish. According to
the manager, owner Den Paj
namat ensures the quality of the
entrees by insisting on only fresh
fish and fresh shellfish whenever
possible.
He personally examines every
shipment from the several deal
ers that sell to him. He is known
to turn back any quantity of fish
that does not pass his diligent in
spection. Steak and chicken are
purchased locally and are also
strictly fresh.

Cheesecake(sl .50), chocolate
mousse ($1.50) and good coffee
brought our meal to a close. The
mousse was fluffy — not as dense
and rich as some — and topped
with sweetened, whipped cream.
For those with lighter tastes, the
generous portions of the entrees
might he better concluded with a
dessert of fresh melon or other
fruit.
The Captain's Cabin offers an
unusual combination of truly ex
cellent food, an attentive serving
staff and an informal atmos
phere. The unhurried ambience
suits the temperament of the
California diner who believes
that meals should be longer than
the intervals between. A lei
surely dinner on the garden
sheltered patio of this restaurant
brings joy to the soul as well as
the palate.

shipment from the several deal
ers that sell to him. He is known
to turn back any quantity of fish
that does not pass his diligent in
spection. Steak and chicken are
purchased locally and are also
strictly fresh.

Cheesecake(sl .50), chocolate
mousse ($1.50) and good coffee
brought our meal to a close. The
mousse was fluffy — not as dense
and rich as some — and topped
with sweetened, whipped cream.
For those with lighter tastes, the
generous portions of the entrees
might he better concluded with a
dessert of fresh melon or other
fruit.
The Captain's Cabin offers an
unusual combination of truly ex
cellent food, an attentive serving
staff and an informal atmos
phere. The unhurried ambience
suits the temperament of the
California diner who believes
that meals should be longer than
the intervals between. A lei
surely dinner on the garden
sheltered patio of this restaurant
brings joy to the soul as well as
the palate.

CAPTAIN'S CABIN
SEAFOOD GROTTO
3295 El Camino Real
Palo Alto
493-8233
Sheltered behind a screen of
vegetation on El Camino Real,
the Captain's Cabin Seafood
Grotto offers a wide variety of
fi>h. shellfish and steaks. Its
wooden doors lead into a warm
friendly interior with an open-air
patio at the far end. The tables
and chairs were imported from
Thailand by Thai owner and chef
Den Pajnamat.
Before owning the Captain's
Cabin. Den was a chef at Trader
Vic's and the Mark Hopkins in
San Francisco. Den takes a
strong personal interest in his re
staurant. often working between
eight and 12 hours a day.
As we pondered the wine list,
our waiter brought us warm
sourdough French bread and
whipped butter. The list pro
vided an adequate selection but a
wine enthusiast might have been
disappointed at its length. It of
fered 10 California white wines,
eight French wines and included
the popular French Pouilly
Fuisse and the German Lieb
raumilch. One rose, three or four
reds and four champagnes, all
domestic, completed the list.

Prices of the wine range from
$fi for a California Chenin Blanc
to $17.25 for the Pouilly Fuisse.
We selected a bottle of Macon
Blanc ($8.50) and were de
lighted with our choice. It was a
moderately dry white wine that
provided a counterpoint to the
sweet freshness of the fish.
The dinner menu includes four
types of entrees: grilled, deep
fried, charcoal broiled and sea
food preparations such as fish
stew bordelaise. They range in
price from $5.50 to $12.95.
Before making a final deci
sion, one should consider the
four or five specials posted on
the board at the entrance. They
change daily, depending on the
available fish. We were disap
pointed, however, that the
kitchen was unable to provide
the stuffed sole special listed on
the board.
Our meal began with a fresh
prawn cocktail ($3.95) that con
sisted of four large prawns dip
ped in a spicy cocktail sauce. The
steamed clams bordelaise ap
petizer ($5.95) arrives steaming
from the stove in a large
aluminum pot. It is enough to
dent a hearty appetite.
The Boston clam chowder
($1.10) was very thick and but

tery. The consistency is not
achieved with an overdose of
potatoes, nor with a milk and
flour thickening. The chef uses
only cream in this soup and it
must be cooked long and care
fully. The chowder is a "must" at
the Captain's Cabin.
The King salmon special
($8.95) arrived with a scoop of
potatoes au gratin and a small
bowl of buttered broccoli. The
potatoes were too dry and the
broccoli was slightly over
cooked. but one taste of the sal
mon removed all dissatisfaction.
The tangy white sauce included
artichokes, capers and Bay
shrimp. The salmon itself was
cooked to firmness, but it re
tained its juices and its sweet
ness.
Together the salmon and
sauce achived a perfectly ba
lanced blend of flavors. In addi
tion, the portion was generous
enough to satisfy a moderate
eater even without an appetizer.
Seafood cannelloni ($7.75) is
a thoughtfully prepared combi
nation of fresh crab, shrimp and
scallops in a mornay sauce co
vered with a smooth blanket of
melted jack cheese. The mornay
sauce joined the flavors of the
three meats successfully with a
light, controlled touch of tomato.
The melted jack cheese topping
just began to crisp around the
edges of the dish but the whole
affair was allowed to cool to a
perfect temperature before
being served. It was .a resounding
success.
The entree came with a small
portion of vegetables and a
mound of rice pilaf. But it is ob

vious that the specialty of the
Captain's Cabin is its excellent
fish and shellfish. According to
the manager, owner Den Paj
namat ensures the quality of the
entrees by insisting on only fresh
fish and fresh shellfish whenever
possible.
