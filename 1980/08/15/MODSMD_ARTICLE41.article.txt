Move over. Total Woman —
step aside. Female Eunuch, and
meet two healthy, young
California mothers who call on
both extremes and march to a
different piper. Blend together
their literary talents, mix well
with a pair of supportive hus-.
bands and ten lively kids bet
ween them, toss in a generous
portion of interest in the con
temporary role of women, and
spice with lavish cupfuls of
feminist philosophies a la
Marabel Morgan/Germaine
Greer. Bake till welldone — and
you come up with a delightful
dish, better known at bookstores
as Please Stand By - Your
Mother's Missing, a refreshingly
humorous look at the issues
raised by women's liberation. It
would be difficult not to enjoy
reading this one.

This Adam's rib-tickling
satire reaches its climax at
a nationally televised de
bate where, not two candi
dates, but over 1700 form
a range of parties, includ
ing: Employed Chinese-
American Mothers, Clois
tered Carmelite Nuns,
Black Belt Southern Belles
and Single Parent Nudists.

Please Stand By is short, writ
ten in ten-minute chapters, and
designed as easy reading for busy
people who want something both
entertaining and provocative.
This they get. The book not only
affirms but delights in what mill
ions of women have always
known: that American women
like to think of themselves as in
dividuals, not trends. Tradition
ally they have and will continue
to play an amazing combination
of roles, hoping to fashion lifes
tyles that are individually satisfy
ing, not stereotyped. Some of
them will become full-time wives
and mothers, others will choose
to work outside the home. Many
will do both, and some will do
neither.
By and large, today's Ameri
can woman seeks to avoid be
coming enslaved as much by the
dogma of liberation as by the
dogma of total subservience
within marriage — at either ex
treme women become mere ob
jects of exploitation. Both dog
mas will cheat them in the long
run, and this little book very
clearly says so. It leaves readers
chuckling at the same time.
The book is already a sell-out
at the bookstores near college
campuses, where young women
arc in the process of choosing

lifestyles and life goals. Men are
reading it too.
The authors are Bay area resi
dents who will be combining
their talents to produce a book a
year. Shirley Tallman, a San Jose
State graduate and mother of se
ven, has worked in radio and
television,, and writes a weekly
"Penny Pincher's" newspaper
column in the Bay area. She lives
with her family in San Jose,
where she teaches guitar and
writes mystery novels.
Nancy Gilsenan, mother of
three, has worked for the Uni
versity of Minnesota's Women's
Center and taught public speak
ing at San Jose State. She now
lives in Palo Alto and works as a
novelist and playwright. Gilse
nan is the 1980 national winner
of the Howard C. Crain Award
for playwrights. Her award
winning Simple Gifts will be pro
duced next winter at San Jose
State, and promises to be a
thought provoker.
Please Stand By plunges head
long into the contemporary wo
men's liberation scene with
sparkling social commentary and
warm imagination.
It climaxes in a clear victory
for individual freedom of choice,
and thus defines "liberation" as
freedom from rigidly defined al
ternatives.
But freedom of choice is not
really liberation at all without a
complete knowledge of all the
options available. Please Stand
By skirts around the edges of the
search for identity but stops
short of the actual plunge into
deep waters. Real liberation
goes far beyond the female-male
dualities of the body.
When these perceptive and
talented young authors grapple
with identity on a deeper level, I
for one will be glad to stand by —
and hear what they have to say
the next time around.
