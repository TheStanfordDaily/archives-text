People talk a lot nowdays
about language and meaning,
what with hermeneutics and
structuralism and all. Despite the
barrage of analysis, however,
there is still much to awe us. And
one welcomes the rare occasion
when a poet can write subtly and
knowingly about the miracle of
language. Such is the case in
Robert Mass's Praise in which
language plays the go-between
for objects and events and our
thinking and imagining them.
Hass uses language to rock us
skillfully between what there is
and what we make of it.
Hass, who did graduate work
at Stanford, won the 1973 Yale
Younger Poets award with Field
Guide, a book which, as Ponge or
Bly would say, gives due respect
to Things. Objects. Places, too, I
might add. For in reading Field
Guide one is aware of Hass's
ability — similar to W.C. Wil
liams's — to create atmosphere
and a sense of presence simply
through selective description,
whether it be of the forests and
beaches of Northern California
or the grime of the Tenderloin.
Praise also succeeds through
description, but it is more am
bitious than Field Guide. Hass
uses more statement, more self
conscious reflection on what he
describes and language's offer
ing it to the life of the mind.
Yet Hass uses statement to
undercut itself. In "Meditation
at Lagunitas" for example, he
writes that "each particular
erases the luminous clarity of a

general idea" and that "because
there is in this world no one
tiling/ to which the bramble of
blackberry corresponds,/ a word
is elegy to what it signifies."
Hass treats an abstract notion
like desire in the same way, the
general dissolving into particu
'lars: "It's not the riddle/of desire
that interests me; it is the riddle/
of good hands, chervil in a win
dow box,/ the white pages of a
book, someone says/ I'm tired,
someone turning on the light."
The particulars of desire and the
strange loveliness of language
sometimes merge, for there "are
moments when the body is as
numinous/ as words, days that
are good flesh continuing./ Such
tenderness, those afternoons and
evenings,/ saying blackberry,
blackberry, blackberry."

that clean-slfaven man
smelling of lotion
lint-free, walking
toward his work, a
pure exclusive music
in his mind.
-Songs to Survive the
Summer

It is tempting simply to quote
Hass and he done with it, as it is
with two poets with whom he is
intrigued: Stevens and Jarrell.
Like them, Hass can catch the
essence of a person, as he does
describing Jarrell "so sad and re
laxed in the pictures" on the
hacks of Jarrcll's hooks. And
Stevens, "that clean-shaven
man/ smelling of lotion,/ lint
free, walking/ toward his work, a/
pure exclusive music/ in his

mind." Or the essence of events,
as in"The Feast," where the hos
tess imagines her guests "drif ting
toward the food, in small groups,
finishing/ sentences, lifting a
pickle or a slice of turkey,/ nibbl
ing a little with unconscious plea
sure."
Praises might not be for
everyone, however. Hass alludes
quite often to other writers and
artists: Homer, Austen, Chekov,
Lorca, Bosch, Botticelli, Durer,
and Cezanne. A reader might
appreciate an allusion to Homer
even though he or she has never
read his "chanted dactyls" in
Greek.
Yet, without ever seeing "The
Garden of Earthly Delights." for
instance, it would be difficult to
appreciate the allusion to
Bosch's painting "where the
people are standing around . . .
and when Love comes, they
throw up." And one might be
irritated when the abstract
statements containing some
fairly strong philosophical jar
gon come too often and too close
together. But this is rare. One
should also remember that many
of these statements point to the
importance of the particulars
that follow rather than aggran
dize themselves.
Language as go-between for
thought and the external world
seems for Hass to be an event in
itself worthy of our awe. The
epigram to the first section of the
book perhaps bears this out:
"We asked the captain what
course/ of action he proposed to
take toward/ a beast so large, ter
rifying. and/ unpredictable. He
hesitated to/ answer, and then
said judiciously:/'I think I shall
praise it."'
—MARTY MCGOVERN
