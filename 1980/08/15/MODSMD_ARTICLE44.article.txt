## 
### Cynthia Elliott Staff Writer 
After only two weeks of re
acquainting himself with Stan
ford. Michael Jackson, new row
assistant director, sits comforta
bly amid prints of his favorite ar
tist and good friend Nelson Ste
vens. in a small office under
neath the stairs ot Grove-
Mayfield.
He's now researching the di
verse histories of the Row
Houses and planning his ap
proach for next year. With the
Xetes' standing in question, the
proposal for an Hast Asian house
in the works, and the apparent
controversy o! why there are so
few minority students in row
houses. Jackson has a reason to
''sit calmly" now.
I'he assistant director usually
works as a liaison to the frater
nities and sororities on campus
and the Row. while also acting as a
support to the RAs and house
managers. As both Jackson and
Row Director Diana Conklin see
it. though, "there's a lot of over
lap" between the two positions.
" 1 want to sit down and talk to
each of the houses' RAs and
managers," said Jackson. "It's
important to look at the organi
zation of each house — it helps to
determine why some houses are
stronger than others.
"People in general are too
idealistic. Political science starts
to take precedence over cleaning
the front room. But Stanford is
pretty exciting — nowhere else, 1
believe, at any other university
could you find the diversity of liv
ing spaces that you get here. Stu
dents live on the Row because
they see a family situation, identify
with a group, and a sense of be
longing," explains Jackson.
Jackson, 30, recalled his years
here when the Row was mostly
all women and fraternities were
looked down upon as too "Es
tablishment."
When questioned about

sororities finding places on cam
pus and the eventual fate of the
fraternities, Jackson answered"l
feel that the fraternities tend to
isolte themselves from the larger
community which is detrimental
to both. I don't know how
rushees deal with being rejected
and so on but I recognize that
maybe I'll have some biases, I'll
have to wait and see.
"As long as the frats and
sororities comply with Univer
sity guidelines and it legitimate
interest and autonomy exist, I
don't see any problems." assured
Jackson.
Some nt his most certain goals
next year are to bring together
Row Houses in charity drives
such as Jogathons and carnivals,
or possibly publishing a literary
magazine of material produced
by students ot the Row. He
suggests a possible Row In
tramural team and mock debates
on political topics.
