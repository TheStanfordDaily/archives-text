# Orientation: discovering about life in the dorms and the classes
## 
### Susan Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Whether you've come to Stan
ford for the curriculum, the cul
ture or the California lifestyle.
Orientation Week includes
scores of programs, meetings
and activities geared to acquaint
both the curious and the bewil
dered to their new home on the
Farm.
Below, some of the more im
portant events scheduled for the
next five days are listed.
As freshman move into their
dorms on Thursday, parents may
attend a special Parents' Day
program designed especially to
keep them busy while their sons
and daughters meet their con
temporaries. 1 leld from <X a.m. to
5 p.m. at Bowman Alumni
House, the program introduces
parents to the University and
familiarizes them with the cam
pus.
From 4:30 to 5:30 p.m., pa
rents and students are reunited
at residence receptions. Then,
after dinner, in Memorial Au
ditorium, Fred Hargadon, dean
of admissions, will introduce the
new University President,
Donald Kennedy. Kennedy will
give a welcoming address and
Herant Katchadourian, dean of

undergraduate studies will out
line the undergraduate cur
riculum at Stanford.
Believe it or not. the first set of
exams greets new students Fri
day morning, as the University
holds foreign language place
ment examinations at various lo
cations around campus from 8
a.m. to 10 a.m.
At 10:30 a.m. faculty mem
bers who are particularly in
terested in undergraduate edu
cation will lead discussions in the
dormitories.
Outstanding professors hon
ored for excellence in teaching
will speak at different campus lo
cations from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.
Then, at 5:30 p.m., students
will have a chance to meet their
faculty advisors. They will dine
together in the student resi
dences.
Often a highlight of the Orien
tation Week is the anecdotal
slide show of Stanford's history
by the University Archivist.
Typically, uppcrclassmen
begin returning to school Friday
so Friday night campus parties
are happening. They're often the
first reunion with old friends, but
don't let that make you feel out
of place. The parties are held in
the honor of new students.

Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon
the advising system is described
and academic planning and dis
ttibution requirements are dis
cussed.
From 2 p.m. on students can
count on a little fun in the sun.
An outdoor jazz and rock con
cert with two local bands will
take place on the field between
Stern and Wilbur Halls from 2
p.m. to 5 p.m. The the residences
will hold outdoor barbequcs at
5:30 p.m.
Saturday night it's time for
more parties — an activity you'll
learn is taken as seriously as
studying at Stanford.
Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. the
University sponsors an after
noon extravaganza — Field Day.
Activities include swimming,
volleyball, frisbee, races,
backgammon, parachute games
and a picnic supper and square
dancing. The event is held at the
DeGuerre Complex.
Sunday night brings the first of
a weeklv ritual. Sunday Night

Flicks are ;tn often needed break
from studies, especially during
midterms and finals.
Alter the tlicks. from 9 p.m. to
I 1 p.m. is a chance to show off a
little at the Coffee I louse in Tre
sidder Union. 1} you'd like to
perform, sign up in the Coffee
House before Sunday.
Monday and Tuesday are re
gistration days and by this time,
all the upperclassmen have re
turned to campus. It may be a hit
boggling at first — all the bikes
and reunions and so many
people.
But Stanford, sometimes cal
led the Harvard of the West,
does not require its freshmen to
wear beanies, unlike some of its
Eastern counterparts.
That means no one will be able
to distinguish freshmen from the
other students on campus. So go
with the flow and before you
know it you'll feel like you've al
ways been a part of it.
One more thing —
Welcome to the Farm!

This is probably one of your first recollections of Stanford — the Orientation volunteers unloading truck
alter truck of your luggage, bicycle, skis, and stereo equipment (not to mention the belongings of the
other freshmen in your dorm). If you think this wait is long, wait till you get to Maples.
