# Handy facts frosh should remember
## 
### 
Though it may be the Class of
'84 that's arriving for the first
time on campus, there's nothing
ominous about the qualifications
or backgrounds of these
freshmen.
Like some of the other classes
in recent years, these ex-high
school seniors blew the betting
line at the Admissions Office and
ended up accepting more invita
tions than Dean Fred Harga
don's staff had anticipated. That
usually makes the admissions
team a bit proud, but such oc
currences do not warm the hearts
of those involved in housing or
room scheduling.
The Class of '84 comprises
888 men and 670 women, edging
the anticipated number of 1500
by 58.
Black, Chicano and Native
American students make up 15
percent of the entering class.
There are 49 freshman leaving
their native countries to journey
to Stanford. The number of
Californians in this class is just
44 percent (687). with Texas
sending 68. New York and
Washington tying for third with

65, and Illinois accounting for 54
freshman.
The class has 202 students (13
percent) who are descended
from parents who are former
Stanford students.
Slightly over fifty percent of
the class will be on some type of
financial aid.
As for those not-to-be
forgotten sophomore and junior
transfers, they followed the
example of the freshman and
signed up in greater force than
expected. 89 men and 70 women
will be starting this academic
year on The Farm, meaning that
there will be nine more than the
anticipated 150 transfer students.
Formerly they were members of
the student bodies at 99 colleges
and universities.
Hargadon tersely termed the
product of his handiwork '"excel
lent."
For those frosh who may soon
be wondering why they're here,
they should remember one fact:
12,731 people applied for a spot
in this class, and that's the
greatest number of aspiring
Stanfordites in the university's
history.
