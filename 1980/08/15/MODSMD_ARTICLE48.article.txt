# Ties and skirts forgotten, not full moon over Quad

Puzzling over that row of
numbered bron/c plaques in
front of Memorial Church?
Those plaques, set in the tiles of
the Ouad since 1892, conceal
one of the few remaining Stan
ford traditions.
Each graduating class over the
years has interred a time capsule
containing the memorabilia of its
short era at Stanford — every
thing from armbands to a Satur
day Night Fever.
But other Stanford traditions
have not stood so well the test of
changing times and collegiate
whims. Some conventions out of
Stanford archives that today's
incoming freshmen never need
concern themselves with in
clude:

-- Only seniors can wear
cords.
— No freshmen men allowed
on the Row.
— No smoking in the Ouad.
— No women on the steps of
the Law building (now Political
Science).
— No corsages at Stanford
dances except the Senior Ball.
— Sharing rides with anyone
waiting under the big oak by the
History Corner.
— Only skirts on women
beyond the Post Office.
— Candy or flowers for
women locked out after closing
hours.
— No men in women's dorms
except in social rooms.
— No women alone in men's
dorms, fraternities or off campus
apartments.

— Hello Day in the Fall uhen
everyone bays Hi.
— The Bonfire on the night
before Big Game.
The demise of many of these
traditions came with women's
liberation and the sexual revolu
tion of the '60s. Others just
faded into a past that held such
scriptures more highly.
Some "new traditions," such
as following the Band to The
City the night before Big Game,
have even risen to take their
places.
But beware freshmen women:
it a senior man promises you that
a kiss at midnight under a full
moon in the middle of the Quad
will turn you into a Stanford
woman, don't laugh. That's one
Stanford tradition that's still
going strong.

One of the Stanford traditions that still survives is that of becoming a
Stanford woman (or man) under a full moon at midnight in the
middle of the Quad.
