# The
						Freshman Advising System: expectations vs. reality
## 
### Robin Millington Editor 
The underlying philosophy of
the Freshman Advising System
here is to create personalized
contact between the adviser and
the ad\ isee. according to innum
erable University brochures.
While this sy stem, in many eyes,
is better than the less personal,
centralized advising systems at
many Eastern and large state
schools, many people who are
involved with the system say
there is much room tor im

provement in the Stanford sys
tem.
Diane Middlebrook, associate
professor of English, has made
many improvements based on
student feedback. These changes
are being put into effect begin
ning with this fall's entering
class, and there is optimism in all
quarters that the improvements
will be very effective.
But, warns Tama Granoff. ad
vising coordinator of the
Academic Information Center
(AIC). unreal expectations arc

the greatest problem taceu by
everyone in the system.
Freshmen expect miracles
from their advisers and ad\ isers
feel inadequate in the face ot
these unrealistic expectations.
The most overwhelming criti
cism is that freshmen enter the
advising system expecting that
their ad\ iser will be the source ot
all kinds of information, while
the advisers expect to act as
friends or mentors to the
freshmen.
Granoff said that freshmen
should be careful about building
up this kind of expectation. She
explained that most advisers are
academics who are familiar with
their field or department but not
necessarily with other depart
ments. Their role is to help the
students find out themselves
what they need to know.
•'Be aware that these people
aren't walking encyclopedias or
tools: they arc human beings
who can be uniquely useful but
they can't be all-in-one sources
of information." Granoff said.
Alice Supton, associate dean
for residential education, and
Bob Hamrdla. assistant to the
president, both agree that ad\ is
ers should stimulate the general
trains of thought a student is hav -
ing.
Hamrdla said he believes a

great part ot the problem stems
from high school advising sys
tems. "Students have come here
from high schools where most ot
your generation, and most of
mine, for that matter, were told
what courses to take." he said.
"The poor student comes here
and really can't be told, 'should I
take English or French.' "
Marc Ventresea, member of
the Council of Presidents (COP)
and a former Residential Assis
tant (RA). said he sees the ad
viser as "someone to act as a
mentor, someone who will just
work through your thoughts with
you. An adviser isn't to tell you
which classes to take but more to
play devil's advocate."
Ventresea said that problems
begin when freshmen feel that
their advisers can't answcrall the
questions.
"There's a drawing back
period when freshmen say 'well,
they don't know anything I need
to know,' " explains Ventresea.
He added that "advisers are
human too," and their egos, too,
arc on the adviser-advisee rela
tionship.
When the adviser feels the re
jection from the advisee, a feel
ing of inadequacy can ensue,
breaking down the adviser's ex
pectations of his or her role in the
process. The adviser can in re

turn draw back, thereby drawing
the criticisms that many advisers
don't spend much time at their
tasks.
"Students and advisers are
often afraid of each other,"
added Hamrdla, who has served
as an adviser for 14 years and a
Resident Fellow for two.
In an attempt to overcome
these basic problems, which it
should be added are not neces
sarily present throughout the
system, a number of steps have
been taken this year to deal with
the unreal expectations.
As a first step. Assoc. Prof.
Middlebrook has instituted a
program to help educate the in
coming freshmen on the aims of
the advising system. This session
has been added to the orienta
tion program. Saturday at *■) a.m.
in Memorial Auditorium
Middlebrook will discuss the ex
pectations and'goals of both ad
visers and advisees with the
freshmen.
On the faculty side, a number
of innovations have been intro
duced to improve the quality of
counseling opportunities.
First, and most importantly,
three dinners each quarter will
be devoted strictly to meetings
between the students and their
advisers.
This changes the old expecta
tion that faculty members should
try to eat in the dorm once a
week.
Supton said that part of the
past problem was that this expec
tation was unfair to faculty
members who were already
heavily committed. They would
be unable to live up to this expec
tation from the very beginning
and would begin "drawing back"
an inherent sense of partial
failure.
There are a number of advan
tages to this system. First, by
formalizing the dinner meetings,
all the freshmen in the dorm
meet with their advisers at once,
creating a peer support among
advisees to appear at the dinners.
"Students have to be involved
and appreciative if advising is

going to be .1 rewarding experi
ence for the adviser," Supton
commented, and students not
showing at dinners in the past has
been a disincentive to some ad
visers.
The second advantage is that
this system creates a greater feel
ing of working with a team. By
getting to know members of the
team, i.e. other advisers. Resi
dent Fellows, RAs and the re
cently added Advising As
sociates (A As), the advisers can
learn to whom on the team they
can refer questions that they per
sonally may not be able to ans
wer.
Also, the concept of a team
advising is important to the stu
dent. If he or she cannot relate to
the adviser assigned them the
student can easily seek out
another member of the team for
help, or even change to another
adviser.
Finally, an important addition
to the advising team over the last
couple of years has been the Ad
vising Associates. This was an
experimental program started
two years ago. This incorporates
peer advisers into the system to
supplement the regular advisers,
and offers the freshmen "the
perspective of an up
perclassman," according to
Granoff.
The experiment has been a
success, growing from 10 A As
the first year to 50 this year.
Dorms requesting the program
this year are Branner, Otero,

Rineonada and I'rancos.
Ventresca perceives the rela
tionship of the advisers and the
AAs as developing a dual sup
port system.
"The adviser is a real adult in
our junior world who plays the
role of a guiding older figure,
whereas the AAs have access to
much more practical inside in
formation," lie explained.
Another step taken to aid the
adviser has been to be sure they
are aware of the various re
sources available for answering
questions they are unsure of.
"We feel advisers can't be all
in-one information banksand we
are stressing to advisers that the
AIC" is here and that they are to
call us for help," Granot't
explained.
According to Granoff,
Middlebrook "is eliminating
drastically the 'chem book' type
material we give advisers . . . re
placing it with a small pocket
si/ed publication called the Ad
viser's Yellow I'ages.
A common complaint from
advisers has been that often the
times they've most needed in
formation available in the bin
ders of adviser information was
over dinner with advisees, when
the information was least acces
sible.
Supton summed up the advis
ing system by saying "It requires
the taking of initiative in a whole
lot of ways. Everybody, advisers
and freshmen, has to work at it."
