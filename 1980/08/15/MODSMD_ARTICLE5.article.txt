## Egyptian press unleashed 
### Edward Cody The Washington Post 
CAIRO — The semiofficial
Egyptian press, reflecting grow
ing irritation in the government,
has abandoned months of en
forced restraint and returned to
venemous attacks against Israel
and Prime Minister Menachem
Begin.
A scries of strong anti-Israeli
editorials and cartoons in
government-owned Cairo news
papers and magazines de
monstrates — and is becoming
part of — the increasingly sour
atmosphere surrounding passage
of a law by the Israeli Parliament
declaring united Jerusalem as
the eternal capital of Israel.
Passage of the law led Presi
dent Anwar Sadat of Egypt to
suspend Palestinian autonomy
talks with Israel on Aug. 3 de
spite U.S. urging to continue and
reinforced the conviction of
many Egyptian Foreign Ministry
officials that Begin is not acting
in good faith in the negotiations.
Against this backdrop Cairo
journalists and cartoonists,
known for their wit and always

eager to display it, have felt less
restraint from their official
monitors, who earlier were en
forcing direct orders from Sadat
to avoid criticism that the Israelis
would judge too personal or
acidic.
As a result, the tone of their
comments has sharpened con
siderably. drawing official com
plaints frorji Begin'sgovernment
handed to Egyptian Ambassador
Saad Murtada in Israel.
Israeli diplomats here regard
the press as a faithful if not al
ways precise barometer of offi
cial thinking and often relay
editorial comment to the Foreign
Ministry in Jerusalem.
The first Israeli protest was
lodged following a cartoon Aug.
7 in the Cairo newspaper Al
Gumhuriyah showing Adolph
Hitler pinning a swaztika on Be
gin's chest with the comment:
"Heil Begin." This was a pun on
the infamous Hitlerian greeting
and the Arabic word "Heil,"
which translates roughly as
"great going." Begin himself was
shown carrying a whip beside a
banner depicting his policies
such as crackinu down on West

Bank Palestinians. Behind him
was a row of Israelis, wearing the
Star of David and stretching out
their arms in the Nazi salute.
The Israeli protest, reflecting
Jewish sensitivities on the Nazi
question, demanded an explana
tion from Sadat's government.
So far Begin's government has
received no public response
other than the standard reply
that the press in Egypt is free and
therefore does not carry official
weight.
But Al Gumhuriyah's editor,
Mohsen Mohammed, provided a
reply of sorts in a signed editorial
Wednesday in which he declared
that the Jerusalem law has pro
voked a return to "a propaganda
war" and "a new climate that
does not express peace and does
not achieve it and does not help
it."
Egyptian editorialists tradi
tionally have wielded sharp pens,
and there is little unusual about
the ferocity of their attacks. Simi
lar criticism is vented regularly
against Egyptian foes such as
President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq and the Libyan leader,
Moammar khadafy.
