## 
### 
The Sophomore Seminar
program, sponsored by the Of
fice of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies will offer 49
seminars whose enrollment is li
mited to second-year students.
According to University Om
budsman John Goheen. who will
direct the new program. Sopho

more Seminars are designed to
"enhance the sophomore year."
"Sometimes students feel a hit
lost between the freshman year,
when academic interests are en
couraged to be rather wide
spread and the Junior Year,
when students have declared a
major," said Mr. Goheen. This
new program is designed to offer
a wide range of subjects in a
seminar format so that students
can work closely with a faculty
member on a subject of mutual
interest.
Forty-nine seminars will be of
fered during the year on topics
proposed by faculty and ap
proved hy the Seminar commit
tee during Spring quarter. Some
sample titles include:
"Bioethics: Mankind with
Medicine" taught by Drs. Jane
and Andrei Calin (Department
of Medicine): "Political Theory,
Politics and Public Opinion ' by
John Bunzel, Senior Research
Fellow, Hoover Institution;
"Theory and Practice of Modern
Dance" bv Diane Freccero, Lec
turer in Undergraduate Studies;
and "Anthropology and Freud"
by (iilbert H. Herdt, Assistant
Professor of Anthropology.
"The response to the program
has been extremely good," said
Mr. Goheen, "and there are very
few spaces left."
