# Successor to Lyman as eighth university president
## Kennedy speaks on advising, faculty, humanities 
### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
When Donald Kennedy began his
presidency August 1. he became only
the eighth president of Stanford Uni
versity. The University's former vice
president and provost took office fol
lowing the resignation of President
Richard Lyman who left to become
president of the Rockefeller Founda
tion.
Though educated at Harvard. Ken
nedy is no newcomer to Stanford. His
affiliations here began in 1960 in the
Biology department of which he even
tually became chairman.
Appointed Commissioner of the
federal Food and Drug Administration
in 1977 under the Carter administra
tion, Kennedy took two years leave
from the University returning in 1979
to the vice-presidency and provostship
position.
Always interested in stimulating un
dergraduate education, he sat on its
first committee in the mid-1960s and
then later developed the Human Biol
ogy interdepartmental major. He re
ceived the Dinkelspiel Award for his
devotion to excellence in under
graduate education in 1976.
In this interview with the Daily Ken
nedy discusses his current three
priorities at Stanford as well as other
current campus issues.
* # *
Q: What do you think are some of the
biggest problems that face Stanford stu
dents today? And what specifically can
this University do to help students be
come both highly educated individuals
and people prepared to go into the
working world?
Dr. Kennedy: It's always difficult to
decide how much emphasis one wants
to place, in an institution like this, on
the world afterward in a specific sense,
that is, in the employment sense, and
how much one wants to emphasize the
values of general education, the impor
tance of turning out people who are
equipped with good thinking tools and
who are well acquainted with their cul
ture.
But I find, and 1 guess everybody
around here finds, that students these
days are rather more concerned with
the former set of problems than they
were 10 or 1 5 years ago. That certainly
says something about the economy and
something about contemporary stu
dent attitudes.
Stanford obviously tries through or
ganizations like the CPPC (Career
Planning and Placement Center) and
through various sorts of career counsel
ing programs available in the specific
departments and schools to deal with
those needs. 1 do think that in the end
the thing we can best do for students is
to prepare them by making them ex
ceptionally competent and capable
people across the full range of activities
. . . not to make them competent and
capable for just one particular job or
occupation.
In Human Biology I became drawn
very strongly to the conclusion that the
most important thing we could do for
the students was to acquaint them with
the nature of processes and with ways
of thinking, rather than grafting onto
them a particular kind of knowledge.
One can't expect to walk into a pre
fixed kind of occupation. It's going to
take some experimenting and often
that experimenting is going to be pain
ful. The best we can do for students is to
Hive them the tools ultimately to cope.
Q: I understand that you 've set as one of
vour highest priorities a reemphasis of
the humanities and liberal arts at Stan
ford since many people consider Stan-

ford a highly technical and scientifically
oriented institution. / know that situa
tion is being remedied in part by the
addition of the new undergraduate di
versification requirements
But, are Stanford students still being
attracted to the less "marketable"
majors even when there is such a push in
the economy to make money as soon as
one graduates?
Kennedy: I think that the data on en
rollment in majors do show some lean
mi: toward the more, as opposed to the
| CSS , marketable majors. But its not a

very large effect, and I think it's still
possible to say that Stanford students
are choosing their fields of concentra
tion more on the basis of their inherent
interests.
There's one thing I'd like to stress
about my own emphasis on the
humanities. I do think that we need to
pay special attention to the improve
ment of the humanities and to those
social sciences that haven't partici
pated as much in the great flowering ot
government support of research over
the past 20 years.
At Stanford we want to he as strong
as possible, equally as strong across the
board. Not ... because I think Stan
ford is weak in those fields, actually I
think we're quite strong. And. not . . .
because 1 think we are as a teaching
institution overbalanced toward the
sciences as compared with the
humanities. But 1 don't think the
strength is quite at parity.
The purpose of the new distribution
requirement is to get students in all
majors to be more conscious of and
aware of what's available outside their
schools.
Here 1 would say that students in the
so-called liberal arts disciplines can be
just as faulted for ignoring the sciences
and technology, as the students in sci
ences and technology for ignoring the
humanities. 1 don't think it's by any
means a one way street.
Q: Will students who are in highly de
manding and stria tared majors, such as
engineering and premedical training, he
highly pressured to he able to fit in these
additional requirements? In majors
where requirements are not so restric
tive, it would seem easier to he able to fit
in the added variety of classes.
Kennedy: Let's put it this way. It has
always been more difficult for students
in majors that call for a number of clas
ses in the major and cognate fields to fit
in extra things. I've studied; the dean of
undergraduate studies (Herant Katch
adourian) has studied; and, the dis
tribution panels have studied the obli
gations that will fall to students under
the new distribution requirements.
And 1 think 1 can say with absolute
assurance that no student who plans
reasonably will find it difficult to meet
those distribution requirements. That's
not to say it won't occasionally be in
convenient; but it won't be difficult.
Q: As an initiator of the Human Biol
ogy program at Stanford / know you are
well aware of the realm of possibilities
of interdepartmental majors. They seem
to work very well in terms of incorporat
ing "packages" of various disciplines.
Has the University considered creat
ing other such majors, or is it still left up
to the individual student to create a
self-designed major. Both the Human
Biology and the International Relations
majors, for example, have grown quite
popular.
Kennedy: The public policy program is
now evolving to major status and I
think there will be others. The question
you ask is whether the University is
also making plans to structure other
interdisciplinary experiences.
There isn't any other major evolv ing
other than the one in public policy; but
there is a greater opportunity to engage
in new packaging through the chal
lenge to produce new course sequences
that will satisfy in a one year sequence
several distribution requirements.
1 think that ought to be one of the
primary challenges to our faculty under
the new distribution requirements. For
instance. 1 know that Jim Adams (as
sociate dean of academic affairs) and
his colleagues in the School of En
gineering are hard at work in the sci-

ence and technology and adjacent
areas. I think there are also real oppor
tunities in what arc coming to be called
the "human sciences."
After all, one of the purposes of cur
riculum reform is to hum the insides of
the cylinders out. to create by restruc
turing an opportunity for generating
some new opportunities. And I'd like
to see that happen.
Q: You vc also discussed as one oj your
other priorities a revamping of the un
dergraduate education system outside
the purely academic classroom setting.

You iv mentioned, for example, exami
nation of the student advisory system
and changes in the residential education
program.
Could you elaborate on those two
areas and others you have considered
Kennedy: Let me respond specifically
to that portion of undergraduate edu
cation at Stanford that imolves life
outside the classroom and off the
Quad. I have the general feeling that
\\c ought to be a little richer here in the
degree to wlnch students carry intellec
tual interests avvav from formal parts of
the academic structures.
I don't think there is any one gim
mick that is going to make that happen,
lint there arc a number of areas where
you might want to look for improve
ment: one of them is in Res. Ed.,
another is in the system of advising.
One Senior Survey after another has
shown that the advisory system is one
of the most criticized aspects of the un
dergraduate experience at Stanford.
I'm going to want to discuss oppor
tunities this next year with a group of
the people who have the best know
ledge of undergraduate education at
Stanford: the deans arfd associate
deans of the schools that do the most
teaching of undergraduates here, the
dean of students affairs (James Lyons),
the dean of undergraduate studies and
his staff, the dean of admissions (Fred
Hargadon). and the registrar (Sally
Mahoney). who will form a kind of un
dergraduate cabinet with which 1 ex
pect to meet quite regularly. 1 also ex
pect to have a lot to say about this
subject to students and I expect they'll
have a lot to say to me.
We're doing rather better than many
places in asking our own students for
information about the quality of teach
ing. the quality of advising, and in con
ducting serious exit interviews. But the
fact is that we are trying hard to learn
more about what can make the under
graduate experience here more com
plete and effective. I can only suggest
possible areas for improvement now;
I'd be foolish to say 1 had any answers.
Q: Have you been pleased with some of
the current alternative learning prog
rams here on campus, such as the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on Polit
ical and Social Issues), SCIRE (Stan
ford Center for Innovation in Research
and Education), ARL.U (Action Re
search Liaison Office) and the UGS
(Undergraduate Specials) programs?
Kennedy: I can't really evaluate those
programs because I don't know much
about them in their present incarna
tions. I served on the ARLO board
before I went back to government (as
commissioner for the Food and Drug
Administration).
In general I think ARLO's direction
of evolution ha.> been quite encourag
ing. There seems to be more firmness,
more review and more quality in that
research program and I think it has de
veloped very impressive connections to
the community outside the University.
I can tell you how 1 feel about the
general idea of having a set of courses
that are placed part way outside the
academic tradition and that involve
particular connections to the so-called
real world. I think they are good and
stimulating.
0: In terms of other non-traditional
learning experiences, I know that the
overseas campuses have grown in popu
larity each year, and that a new campus
in Haifa will be opening September
19X1.
What is your feeling about the over
seas program here?
Kennedy: It represents one of the un
ique virtues and values of this place. It
seems to me that if anything is truly
special about undergraduate Stanford
that has developed over recent years, it
is overseas studies.
Our extensive concern with interna
tional matters ought to be conserved at
all costs. I'd have to think long and hard
before cutting into that activity very
deeply. I think it's very special. I'm
completely persuaded of its value.
(J: Your third priority that you've out
lined is to try to strengthen the affirma
tive action policy here in the hiring of
new faculty, especially of Chicanos and
of women.
What are your plans for attracting
those members of society that you feel
are underrepresented here?
Kennedy: In the affirmative action
area I've indicated considerable con
cern not only about hiring at the faculty
level but also at the senior administra
tive staff levels. I think we can do some
thing good on all fronts. So we singled
out a few areas to go after right away.
When I learned that we had made 72
or so outside appointments at tenured
level over the past three years and only
two of them were (to) women, I felt
that was a dismal record. I appointed
three task forces that have now re
ported to me rosters of available
women that would be qualified for te
nure on this faculty. And we've put in
place a way of making sure that those
opportunities are made available to
departments.
I think we can conspicuously im
prove our attractiveness to women at
that level of appointment. In fact, I
think we will have made several female
appointments at tenure level to this fa
culty as a consequence . . . by this time
next year.
I was also particularly concerned
about the si/e of the Chicano faculty.
When three members happened to
come up for sabbatical leave in the
same year it left just a very small

number to take cure of the multiple
obligations of teaching, research and
the special tasks they have in relation to
the community of Chicano students
here. And so I've said on several occa
sions that I think we ought to be trying
to strengthen the attractiveness of
Stanford to Chicano faculty.
That involves, in part, some place for
Chicano research interests to focus, in
part, making certain Chicano hiring
opportunities are made to depart
ments.
Affirmative action is going to mean
getting some institution-wide
mechanism made for making depart
ments conscious of and taking advan
tage of particular needs and oppor
tunities.
It doesn't mean I'm satisfied with
other areas of affirmative action; I'm
not satisfied with the number of black
faculty we have either, although it
doesn't present quite the crisis situa
tion of the Chicano faculty.
Q: It has been rumored that there have
been problems in attracting new faculty
in general to Stanford because of hous
ing costs, difficulties in obtaining pro
fessorships, and what you've termed the
"provinciality" of California, that
California isn't quite the academic and
arts center of the East Coast.
What are your plans for maintaining
the current quality of the faculty?
Kennedy: The big problem here in fa
culty recruitment is housing costs. And
the second problem is housing costs.
And the third problem is housing costs.
We've got the University into sharing
equity (the coinvestment program).
There are now $3 million in that prog
ram and we'll go back to the trustees
and ask for more because I think that
the program is clearly a success by
market standards. But we may have to
do even more. I'm still getting accounts
of difficulties even with that program.
Certain kinds of people in the
humanities may still be a little harder
for us to attract because of a difference
between the coasts. It's not so much
that the northeast is still the literary
center of the country, but that the or
gans of literary criticism are heavily
concentrated there. The publishing in
dustry. the Broadway stage, and the
primary journals of literary criticism
are heavily focused there and so there
is a sense in which California may seem
a bit provincial to some people.
This we can overcome if we get a
critical mass of people (here) and in
teresting situations for them to interact
in.
0: Are you planning ways to attract
further minority students here and addi
tional programs for them? Or do you
feel that the programs here are sufficient
to stimulate special interests of
minorities and ethnic groups?
Kennedy: Well, there are two areas
where we ought to be looking for im
provement. First, we have an impor
tant obligation to minority students to
show them clear examples of excel
lence on the faculty and on the staff
from their own ethnic background so
that they are surrounded by signals of
success and by people with whom they
can interact at their choice.
The comments 1 just made about fa
culty appointments apply in this con
text also.
Second. 1 think we may have some
work to do in the residential setting,
promoting more understanding bet
ween ethnic groups and the majority at
Stanford. At a number of different uni
versities studies have been done re
cently on race relations. They are al
most uniformly discouraging about the
level of comfort and the level of toler
ance that exist between races.
If there is any place in which we
should address that question success
fully it is here. California is a state that
has an interesting, vital and vivid racial
mix of its own. Stanford isan institution
that I think is characterized by friendli
ness and tolerance. I think we ought to
be able to do very well in that regard
here.
This is an issue I'll be talking over
with the group I mentioned earlier who
are going to give me some policy help
on undergraduate matters.
(): On a different note, even though
Stanford hasn t been involved in the dis
ciplinary actions taken against five
members of the Pac-10 Conference re

garding football, what are your
thoughts about such goings on in col
legiate sports?
Kennedy: Well, I'm disturbed most of
all by the implication made, in some
cases it's much more than an implica
tion it's a clear demonstration of
exploitation, of young people by the
institutions.
I don't think it's a favor to a young
man to get him to come to a university
and give him a free pass through
academic work and let him use up his
eligibility and then not graduate.
At Stanford we've always said it's
possible to play football at the level we
choose to play it in this conference and
yet do it with a group of people who are
bonafide students.
I think the evidence is that we have
succeeded consistently in that effort.
The evidence is in our freedom from
that kind of taint in our graduation
rate. I think it asks a lot of our football
players and I think that, by in large,
they have been capable of delivering it.
We don't have exceptions here; the
people who play are people whom the
best college admissions director in the
country has said belong at Stanford.
That is a matter in which I take pride
and I think our athletes take pride in
too.

Q: Both the fraternity and sorority sys
tems had problems with their rushes (for
new members) last spring and addition
ally there is the question of sororities
being recognized by the University.
What are your thoughts in general on
this system and how it works into the
Stanford system?
Kennedy: Diversity of living arrange
ments has always been characteristic of
this institution. We're much more
committed than many other places to
living groups of about fraternity and
sorority si/.e, even outside the frater
nity and sorority system. It works well
here. We have an enormous advantage
here over some of the highly selective
eastern private universities in that
fraternities and sororities are not such
an overwhelming majority of the cam
pus that there is terrific pressure on
people who choose not to belong and
those who are left out. In many respects

the system here is relatively healthy.
I'm concerned about the degree of
control that the nationals appear to be
intent on making on the sororities at
Stanford and unless that problem gets
resolved, I think we're going to have
real difficulties.
As far as fraternities are concerned, I
think they work rather well in some
cases and in some other cases they have
not worked so well. I worry quite a lot
about houses that seem so closed to
new traditions, to advice from the out
side and to new kinds of interests. The
problems we appear to be having with
some houses are exactly the same as the
problems we had 1 5 years ago. I find it
a little disappointing that some of them
appear to have such difficulty in chang-l
ing.
Q: In your role as president of one of the
major American universities, where
does that place you in your commit
ments and duties on the national level?.:
Kennedy: My main duty on the na
tional level is to be as effective a
spokesman as I can for higher educa
tion and in particular for quality private
education. Since 1 have fairly signific
ant recent experience in government
and know the Washington scene
adequately, if not well, 1 would expect

that some of my chances to contribute
would come there. But, I haven't
worked it out terribly carefully as you
might expect as I've been in office for
only a month.
I hope to keep my other outside
commitments to a rather small
minimum because I think this is a full
time job and a half. I don't know how
one can travel much beyond the fairly
extensive travel commitments . . . for
Stanford.
0: Will you remain at all active in the
Human Biology department? I know
you will be giving the first five hours of
lecture for the (introductory) core this
fall.
Kennedy: I'm certainly going to be a
fan. I doubt whether I'll be able to be a
strong participant. I propose to main
tain an interest there, maybe as a guest
lecturer in an advanced course occa
sionally.



President Donald Kennedy and his wife Jeanne are Stanford's new First Couple.
