# Vice presidents and deans give views on University
## 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
The new decade has begun
with a new University president
and new concerns. Though the
future is characteristically un
predictable, some administrators
have offered their ideas about
where Stanford is going and what
the obstacles will be.
"It's a popular impression"
that there are strings attached to
the money that flows into Stan
lord, said Joel Smith, vice
president for development, and
that they affect the direction of
the institution — but this is not
true. There exists a well
developed agenda of what
money is needed for what pur
pose. If a patron wants to give
money for some other purpose,
Smith said, then they have other
universities to choose from.
There are three themes on the
agenda at this point.
The first is "increased concern
about the imbalance of science
and engineering on one side and
the humanities on the other. This
is not the Stanford Institute of
Technology, it's Stanford Uni
versity. The humanities are of
cardinal importance. For them to
flourish it takes money. We've
got some catching up to do in
stitutionally in terms of fellow
ships, research grants, and pro
fessorships."
The second is that there will be
less money devoted to the con
struction of new buildings than
there has been in the last decade.
Though only broadly defined
at this point, the third theme will
concern improving the quality of
undergraduate education in the
wide sense of the term.
When asked if there is any dif
ficulty in obtaining funds for this.
Smith replied "we will do very
well in getting support for un

dergraduate life."
Aquisition of new professors is
a major problem for the Univer
sity, according to Gerald
Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean for research.
"One of the crucial issues fac
ing us in the next few years is
maintaining a flow of young fa
culty into the University.
"We are a University that
grew dramatically in the '50s and
'60s so retirements are not going
to take place very soon. We are
in a position now where we are
not expanding anymore. We
would like to maintain our same
size and if there is little output
due to retirements how do you
get some inputs if you keep a
constant size?"
"The problem is further
exacerbated by the fact that fed
eral and state laws recently have
changed the age that mandatory
retirement can take place. Until
recently at Stanford it was 65. It
is now 70. That adds five years to
a problem that already existed.
"We can get young people in if
we can find innovative ways by
which faculty would choose to
retire early. We are in the pro
cess of thinking about ways to
make the retirement package
more attractive. Clearly the fa
culty is concerned and they
should be concerned about infla
tion and erosion of their retire
ment income. We're looking for
some ways to alleviate some of
these worries, allowing them to
retire if they so desire."
Lieberman explained that the
crux of the problem is the need
for a constant faculty size. This is
the result of trying to meet the
combined goals of a small stu
dent enrollment and a faculty
small enough to require each
professor to interact with stu
dents. The latter objective, he

said, reflects the belief that the
interaction between teaching
and research is beneficial to
both, that there is a "synergy"
between the two activities.
As much difficulty as there is
in achieving the proper relative
teacher-student population to
generate this synergy. Dean o!
Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian concurs with
Lieberman that it is an essential
part of the school.
"We have an excellent faculty
but whose attention is divided,
understandably, in many ways.
The aim is optimizing the com
plementarity ot research and
scholarship to teaching, which
we feel is very important."
"Here we have our direction:
more and more emphasizing
teaching in the development of a
professor's career starting from
when the person is hired and all
the way up in the ranks. This is
going to remain a focus of con
tinuous attention." Katchadou
rian said.
When asked about any detri
mental effects research has on
teaching and the comparison to
teaching in colleges that do not
conduct research, Katchadou
rian said that the judgement de
pends on what the students want
from their education.
"One can very well under
stand how in a small college the
faculty would spend more time
with students teaching or advis
ing. but then you have to re
member that the students in
those colleges do not have the
same opportunities of working
with people who are on the foref
ront of knowledge.
"And therefore it seems to me
that it's a question of what the
student needs. Some students
will thrive better in a fast paced
research university and may be

able to use the faculty's time,
even it it is less, to a greater ad
vantage because ol who those fa
culty members are. Others may
very much want a different kind
ol atmosphere.
"We like to think that we will
be able to capture more and
more of some of the advantages
ot (a small teaching oriented col
lege). I don't think we should
give up the struggle to have the
students involved with faculty in
a more personal way. Instead of
saying to the faculty member
'Don't do research.' we should
say 'Involve the student in your
research," Katchadourian con
cluded.
J. Myron Atkin, dean of the
education school, said that the
quality of teaching here will be
nefit from consistent student in
put.
"'There have been studies that
showed the material provided by
student evaluations is very use
ful. There are a lot of commonly
held notions about student
evaluations that are not true.
Students rate easy courses high,
not true. Students rate required
courses lower, not true. Teachers
who grade high get better rat
ings, not true.
"A professor who goes into
the evaluation scheme usually
learns a great deal. I am in favor
of confidentiality. A professor
who is reluctant (to be evaluated
publicly) may learn by seeing it
in private and that may improve
instruction," Atkin said.
Concerning Stanford's rela
tions with the nation, Vice-
President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig cited the
government as a source of dif
ficulties.
"It's now clear that what was
thought of as a pretty stable rela
tion of patronage is a lot less sta

ble. The government is respon
sive to other pressures. From
time to time those pressures are
going to be met at the expense ot
universities and colleges.
"We are going to have to find
ways of buffering ourselves from
that instability ()ne ot them that
is already visible is to find new
sources of support. Not to sub
stitute for government money
but the more sources of support
you have the more protected you
are from reductions from your
main patron. Business is the
leading candidate," Rosenzweig
said.
The second area ol problems
with the government is the gen
eral area ol regulation. There the
universities have a difficult task
to perform: distinguishing those
aspects of governmental regula
tion that we are subject to just
because we do business, from
those regulatory aspects that
come to use because we're uni
versities. because we're engaged
in education and research. It's
the latter that seem to me poten
tially the most dangerous.
"When the government moves
closer to the regulation of our
educational and research ac
tivities. then we have a special
case to make and a special re
sponsibility.
"For example, the area ol
human subjects' protection. It's
perfectly reasonable to want to
protect subjects engaged in re
search. but the question is pro
tect them from what, at what
cost, and at what cost of interfer
ing with the conduct ot research.
There are lots ol questions we
are uniquely able to address be
cause the regulations are addres
sed at us uniquely. We fight very
hard on those issues where we
think the government is over
reaching. 1 think we're going to

see a lot more ol that in the years
ahead." Rosenzweig concluded.
On the subject ol changes in
student personality, Associate
Dean lor Residential Hducation
Norm Robinson felt that in
terests have taken a more indi
vidual tone, though with less ad
venturism.
"There seems to be less of an
inclination to sample or experi
ence something that they haven't
known." In the '60s "some saw
an obligation to see worlds diffe
rent from their own, meet people
different from themselves. It's
not an issue to understand
people of different
backgrounds" anymore.
Along the line of alleviating
this, Robinson said, "one of the
things we want to come about in
the next few years is cross cul
tural" education. "It's almost
taboo" to talk about ethnicity
now.
Though there are no mass
movements anymore, he pointed
out. each individual has their
own issue of concern, Headlines
are not being made and the sub
ject interest as a whole is harder
to pin down, but they are in
volved in many ways.
"What people do care about is
individual and personal," such as
tutoring, community mental

health, lab work.
"They are much more in
volved in the University and
that's one of the changes that has
lasted. Students serve on Uni
versity committees and that's
where policy formation is done.
Students have a very real voice
Another change that has per
sisted is coming prepared. Ihe
students who do their homework
on these committees are ver\ el
fective," Robinson noted.
As far as motivations go.
Rosenzweig offered his own
"1 have personal reasons tor
wanting to be involved in an en
terprise of this kind. For my sell,
they haven't changed much over
the years. I believe that the Uni
versity is one of the last hopes tor
the survival of enlightenment in
very difficult circumstances. The
tradition of open dispute over is
sues, the protection of members
rights to speak freely without
fear of punishment, the com
mitment to expand and com
municate knowledge are all ter
ribly important values that don't
find expression in very many
other places in our society Ihe
preservation of those institutions
that still stand for those values is
very important and that's why
it's worth my while to spend my
time here."

with a new University president
and new concerns. Though the
future is characteristically un
predictable, some administrators
have offered their ideas about
where Stanford is going and what
the obstacles will be.
"It's a popular impression"
that there are strings attached to
the money that flows into Stan
lord, said Joel Smith, vice
president for development, and
that they affect the direction of
the institution — but this is not
true. There exists a well
developed agenda of what
money is needed for what pur
pose. If a patron wants to give
money for some other purpose,
Smith said, then they have other
universities to choose from.
There are three themes on the
agenda at this point.
The first is "increased concern
about the imbalance of science
and engineering on one side and
the humanities on the other. This
is not the Stanford Institute of
Technology, it's Stanford Uni
versity. The humanities are of
cardinal importance. For them to
flourish it takes money. We've
got some catching up to do in
stitutionally in terms of fellow
ships, research grants, and pro
fessorships."
The second is that there will be
less money devoted to the con
struction of new buildings than
there has been in the last decade.
Though only broadly defined
at this point, the third theme will
concern improving the quality of
undergraduate education in the
wide sense of the term.
When asked if there is any dif
ficulty in obtaining funds for this.
Smith replied "we will do very
well in getting support for un

dergraduate life."
Aquisition of new professors is
a major problem for the Univer
sity, according to Gerald
Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean for research.
"One of the crucial issues fac
ing us in the next few years is
maintaining a flow of young fa
culty into the University.
"We are a University that
grew dramatically in the '50s and
'60s so retirements are not going
to take place very soon. We are
in a position now where we are
not expanding anymore. We
would like to maintain our same
size and if there is little output
due to retirements how do you
get some inputs if you keep a
constant size?"
"The problem is further
exacerbated by the fact that fed
eral and state laws recently have
changed the age that mandatory
retirement can take place. Until
recently at Stanford it was 65. It
is now 70. That adds five years to
a problem that already existed.
"We can get young people in if
we can find innovative ways by
which faculty would choose to
retire early. We are in the pro
cess of thinking about ways to
make the retirement package
more attractive. Clearly the fa
culty is concerned and they
should be concerned about infla
tion and erosion of their retire
ment income. We're looking for
some ways to alleviate some of
these worries, allowing them to
retire if they so desire."
Lieberman explained that the
crux of the problem is the need
for a constant faculty size. This is
the result of trying to meet the
combined goals of a small stu
dent enrollment and a faculty
small enough to require each
professor to interact with stu
dents. The latter objective, he

said, reflects the belief that the
interaction between teaching
and research is beneficial to
both, that there is a "synergy"
between the two activities.
As much difficulty as there is
in achieving the proper relative
teacher-student population to
generate this synergy. Dean o!
Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian concurs with
Lieberman that it is an essential
part of the school.
"We have an excellent faculty
but whose attention is divided,
understandably, in many ways.
The aim is optimizing the com
plementarity ot research and
scholarship to teaching, which
we feel is very important."
"Here we have our direction:
more and more emphasizing
teaching in the development of a
professor's career starting from
when the person is hired and all
the way up in the ranks. This is
going to remain a focus of con
tinuous attention." Katchadou
rian said.
When asked about any detri
mental effects research has on
teaching and the comparison to
teaching in colleges that do not
conduct research, Katchadou
rian said that the judgement de
pends on what the students want
from their education.
"One can very well under
stand how in a small college the
faculty would spend more time
with students teaching or advis
ing. but then you have to re
member that the students in
those colleges do not have the
same opportunities of working
with people who are on the foref
ront of knowledge.
"And therefore it seems to me
that it's a question of what the
student needs. Some students
will thrive better in a fast paced
research university and may be

able to use the faculty's time,
even it it is less, to a greater ad
vantage because ol who those fa
culty members are. Others may
very much want a different kind
ol atmosphere.
"We like to think that we will
be able to capture more and
more of some of the advantages
ot (a small teaching oriented col
lege). I don't think we should
give up the struggle to have the
students involved with faculty in
a more personal way. Instead of
saying to the faculty member
'Don't do research.' we should
say 'Involve the student in your
research," Katchadourian con
cluded.
J. Myron Atkin, dean of the
education school, said that the
quality of teaching here will be
nefit from consistent student in
put.
"'There have been studies that
showed the material provided by
student evaluations is very use
ful. There are a lot of commonly
held notions about student
evaluations that are not true.
Students rate easy courses high,
not true. Students rate required
courses lower, not true. Teachers
who grade high get better rat
ings, not true.
"A professor who goes into
the evaluation scheme usually
learns a great deal. I am in favor
of confidentiality. A professor
who is reluctant (to be evaluated
publicly) may learn by seeing it
in private and that may improve
instruction," Atkin said.
Concerning Stanford's rela
tions with the nation, Vice-
President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig cited the
government as a source of dif
ficulties.
"It's now clear that what was
thought of as a pretty stable rela
tion of patronage is a lot less sta

ble. The government is respon
sive to other pressures. From
time to time those pressures are
going to be met at the expense ot
universities and colleges.
"We are going to have to find
ways of buffering ourselves from
that instability ()ne ot them that
is already visible is to find new
sources of support. Not to sub
stitute for government money
but the more sources of support
you have the more protected you
are from reductions from your
main patron. Business is the
leading candidate," Rosenzweig
said.
The second area ol problems
with the government is the gen
eral area ol regulation. There the
universities have a difficult task
to perform: distinguishing those
aspects of governmental regula
tion that we are subject to just
because we do business, from
those regulatory aspects that
come to use because we're uni
versities. because we're engaged
in education and research. It's
the latter that seem to me poten
tially the most dangerous.
"When the government moves
closer to the regulation of our
educational and research ac
tivities. then we have a special
case to make and a special re
sponsibility.
"For example, the area ol
human subjects' protection. It's
perfectly reasonable to want to
protect subjects engaged in re
search. but the question is pro
tect them from what, at what
cost, and at what cost of interfer
ing with the conduct ot research.
There are lots ol questions we
are uniquely able to address be
cause the regulations are addres
sed at us uniquely. We fight very
hard on those issues where we
think the government is over
reaching. 1 think we're going to

see a lot more ol that in the years
ahead." Rosenzweig concluded.
On the subject ol changes in
student personality, Associate
Dean lor Residential Hducation
Norm Robinson felt that in
terests have taken a more indi
vidual tone, though with less ad
venturism.
"There seems to be less of an
inclination to sample or experi
ence something that they haven't
known." In the '60s "some saw
an obligation to see worlds diffe
rent from their own, meet people
different from themselves. It's
not an issue to understand
people of different
backgrounds" anymore.
Along the line of alleviating
this, Robinson said, "one of the
things we want to come about in
the next few years is cross cul
tural" education. "It's almost
taboo" to talk about ethnicity
now.
Though there are no mass
movements anymore, he pointed
out. each individual has their
own issue of concern, Headlines
are not being made and the sub
ject interest as a whole is harder
to pin down, but they are in
volved in many ways.
"What people do care about is
individual and personal," such as
tutoring, community mental

health, lab work.
"They are much more in
volved in the University and
that's one of the changes that has
lasted. Students serve on Uni
versity committees and that's
where policy formation is done.
Students have a very real voice
Another change that has per
sisted is coming prepared. Ihe
students who do their homework
on these committees are ver\ el
fective," Robinson noted.
As far as motivations go.
Rosenzweig offered his own
"1 have personal reasons tor
wanting to be involved in an en
terprise of this kind. For my sell,
they haven't changed much over
the years. I believe that the Uni
versity is one of the last hopes tor
the survival of enlightenment in
very difficult circumstances. The
tradition of open dispute over is
sues, the protection of members
rights to speak freely without
fear of punishment, the com
mitment to expand and com
municate knowledge are all ter
ribly important values that don't
find expression in very many
other places in our society Ihe
preservation of those institutions
that still stand for those values is
very important and that's why
it's worth my while to spend my
time here."

predictable, some administrators
have offered their ideas about
where Stanford is going and what
the obstacles will be.
"It's a popular impression"
that there are strings attached to
the money that flows into Stan
lord, said Joel Smith, vice
president for development, and
that they affect the direction of
the institution — but this is not
true. There exists a well
developed agenda of what
money is needed for what pur
pose. If a patron wants to give
money for some other purpose,
Smith said, then they have other
universities to choose from.
There are three themes on the
agenda at this point.
The first is "increased concern
about the imbalance of science
and engineering on one side and
the humanities on the other. This
is not the Stanford Institute of
Technology, it's Stanford Uni
versity. The humanities are of
cardinal importance. For them to
flourish it takes money. We've
got some catching up to do in
stitutionally in terms of fellow
ships, research grants, and pro
fessorships."
The second is that there will be
less money devoted to the con
struction of new buildings than
there has been in the last decade.
Though only broadly defined
at this point, the third theme will
concern improving the quality of
undergraduate education in the
wide sense of the term.
When asked if there is any dif
ficulty in obtaining funds for this.
Smith replied "we will do very
well in getting support for un

dergraduate life."
Aquisition of new professors is
a major problem for the Univer
sity, according to Gerald
Lieberman, vice-provost and
dean for research.
"One of the crucial issues fac
ing us in the next few years is
maintaining a flow of young fa
culty into the University.
"We are a University that
grew dramatically in the '50s and
'60s so retirements are not going
to take place very soon. We are
in a position now where we are
not expanding anymore. We
would like to maintain our same
size and if there is little output
due to retirements how do you
get some inputs if you keep a
constant size?"
"The problem is further
exacerbated by the fact that fed
eral and state laws recently have
changed the age that mandatory
retirement can take place. Until
recently at Stanford it was 65. It
is now 70. That adds five years to
a problem that already existed.
"We can get young people in if
we can find innovative ways by
which faculty would choose to
retire early. We are in the pro
cess of thinking about ways to
make the retirement package
more attractive. Clearly the fa
culty is concerned and they
should be concerned about infla
tion and erosion of their retire
ment income. We're looking for
some ways to alleviate some of
these worries, allowing them to
retire if they so desire."
Lieberman explained that the
crux of the problem is the need
for a constant faculty size. This is
the result of trying to meet the
combined goals of a small stu
dent enrollment and a faculty
small enough to require each
professor to interact with stu
dents. The latter objective, he

said, reflects the belief that the
interaction between teaching
and research is beneficial to
both, that there is a "synergy"
between the two activities.
As much difficulty as there is
in achieving the proper relative
teacher-student population to
generate this synergy. Dean o!
Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchadourian concurs with
Lieberman that it is an essential
part of the school.
"We have an excellent faculty
but whose attention is divided,
understandably, in many ways.
The aim is optimizing the com
plementarity ot research and
scholarship to teaching, which
we feel is very important."
"Here we have our direction:
more and more emphasizing
teaching in the development of a
professor's career starting from
when the person is hired and all
the way up in the ranks. This is
going to remain a focus of con
tinuous attention." Katchadou
rian said.
When asked about any detri
mental effects research has on
teaching and the comparison to
teaching in colleges that do not
conduct research, Katchadou
rian said that the judgement de
pends on what the students want
from their education.
"One can very well under
stand how in a small college the
faculty would spend more time
with students teaching or advis
ing. but then you have to re
member that the students in
those colleges do not have the
same opportunities of working
with people who are on the foref
ront of knowledge.
"And therefore it seems to me
that it's a question of what the
student needs. Some students
will thrive better in a fast paced
research university and may be

able to use the faculty's time,
even it it is less, to a greater ad
vantage because ol who those fa
culty members are. Others may
very much want a different kind
ol atmosphere.
"We like to think that we will
be able to capture more and
more of some of the advantages
ot (a small teaching oriented col
lege). I don't think we should
give up the struggle to have the
students involved with faculty in
a more personal way. Instead of
saying to the faculty member
'Don't do research.' we should
say 'Involve the student in your
research," Katchadourian con
cluded.
J. Myron Atkin, dean of the
education school, said that the
quality of teaching here will be
nefit from consistent student in
put.
"'There have been studies that
showed the material provided by
student evaluations is very use
ful. There are a lot of commonly
held notions about student
evaluations that are not true.
Students rate easy courses high,
not true. Students rate required
courses lower, not true. Teachers
who grade high get better rat
ings, not true.
"A professor who goes into
the evaluation scheme usually
learns a great deal. I am in favor
of confidentiality. A professor
who is reluctant (to be evaluated
publicly) may learn by seeing it
in private and that may improve
instruction," Atkin said.
Concerning Stanford's rela
tions with the nation, Vice-
President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig cited the
government as a source of dif
ficulties.
"It's now clear that what was
thought of as a pretty stable rela
tion of patronage is a lot less sta

ble. The government is respon
sive to other pressures. From
time to time those pressures are
going to be met at the expense ot
universities and colleges.
"We are going to have to find
ways of buffering ourselves from
that instability ()ne ot them that
is already visible is to find new
sources of support. Not to sub
stitute for government money
but the more sources of support
you have the more protected you
are from reductions from your
main patron. Business is the
leading candidate," Rosenzweig
said.
The second area ol problems
with the government is the gen
eral area ol regulation. There the
universities have a difficult task
to perform: distinguishing those
aspects of governmental regula
tion that we are subject to just
because we do business, from
those regulatory aspects that
come to use because we're uni
versities. because we're engaged
in education and research. It's
the latter that seem to me poten
tially the most dangerous.
"When the government moves
closer to the regulation of our
educational and research ac
tivities. then we have a special
case to make and a special re
sponsibility.
"For example, the area ol
human subjects' protection. It's
perfectly reasonable to want to
protect subjects engaged in re
search. but the question is pro
tect them from what, at what
cost, and at what cost of interfer
ing with the conduct ot research.
There are lots ol questions we
are uniquely able to address be
cause the regulations are addres
sed at us uniquely. We fight very
hard on those issues where we
think the government is over
reaching. 1 think we're going to

see a lot more ol that in the years
ahead." Rosenzweig concluded.
On the subject ol changes in
student personality, Associate
Dean lor Residential Hducation
Norm Robinson felt that in
terests have taken a more indi
vidual tone, though with less ad
venturism.
"There seems to be less of an
inclination to sample or experi
ence something that they haven't
known." In the '60s "some saw
an obligation to see worlds diffe
rent from their own, meet people
different from themselves. It's
not an issue to understand
people of different
backgrounds" anymore.
Along the line of alleviating
this, Robinson said, "one of the
things we want to come about in
the next few years is cross cul
tural" education. "It's almost
taboo" to talk about ethnicity
now.
Though there are no mass
movements anymore, he pointed
out. each individual has their
own issue of concern, Headlines
are not being made and the sub
ject interest as a whole is harder
to pin down, but they are in
volved in many ways.
"What people do care about is
individual and personal," such as
tutoring, community mental

health, lab work.
"They are much more in
volved in the University and
that's one of the changes that has
lasted. Students serve on Uni
versity committees and that's
where policy formation is done.
Students have a very real voice
Another change that has per
sisted is coming prepared. Ihe
students who do their homework
on these committees are ver\ el
fective," Robinson noted.
As far as motivations go.
Rosenzweig offered his own
"1 have personal reasons tor
wanting to be involved in an en
terprise of this kind. For my sell,
they haven't changed much over
the years. I believe that the Uni
versity is one of the last hopes tor
the survival of enlightenment in
very difficult circumstances. The
tradition of open dispute over is
sues, the protection of members
rights to speak freely without
fear of punishment, the com
mitment to expand and com
municate knowledge are all ter
ribly important values that don't
find expression in very many
other places in our society Ihe
preservation of those institutions
that still stand for those values is
very important and that's why
it's worth my while to spend my
time here."

and new concerns. Though the
