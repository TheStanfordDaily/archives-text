■ The Council of Presidents
■COP) this year is promising a
Blearing house for student activ
ity information and strong rep
resentation in University deci
fsion making.
' Elected last spring by a 73 per
cent majority, Dick Butterfield,
Dayna Goldfine, Nancy
Takahashi and Marc Ventresca
have already organized Harvest
(the main orientation event),
written the first orientation
manual specifically for graduate
students, participated in the sec
ond Pac-10 colleges meeting,
and brought together the 011-
campus groups concerned with
draft counseling.
The COP feels that its strength
as a clearing house lies in its abil
ity to get groups with similar
goals together to communicate
ideas.
As an example, Goldfine
pointed out that "all these
groups (interested in draft coun
seling) were working separately.
We streamlined things and that
produced more quality informa
tion."
A major focus for COP work

tins year will be the improve
ment of Tresidder ;is ;i student
union.
"Presently there is no
adequate student social center
on campus. The lack of a gather
ing spot particularly affects off
campus students. We believe
that the future of a student
gathering center lies in Trcsid
der. If we invest in the future of
I'residder now, it won't be long
before it becomes a real student
union with students managing all
projects and lood services . . .br
inging more benefits to the entire
community" their platform
states.
"There will be a forum in the
tall on I residder Union, compar
ing it with unions at other univer
sities," Butterfield said.
On the political side the COP
plans to ensure that students are
aware of relevant university de
cisions before they are made.
"Because of our relationship
with the University we can get in
early on decision making" so
that student input can be made,
Ventresca said.
"We have a diverse
background in University activ
ity. We can act as a source of

information. We can funnel in
formation out to the right people
and hope that decisions benefi
cial to the students are made,"
Butterfield said.
"We're one of the few (col
leges) in the Pac-10 that have
student representation on Uni
versity committees. We plan to
strengthen what is already a
strong system, but has not been
properly utilized," Ventresca
said.
The COP will do this by mak
ing the link to the students on
these committees stronger than
it has been, giving them a place
to bring their information, as
well as releasing it to the public,
Butterfield explained.
Student services, the "tangible

product" of the ASSU, will also
receive COP attention. In addi
tion to the usual ASSI projects,
the Council's platform includes
work on the continuation of Stu
dents United tor Rape Elimina
tion (SURE). the new ( onsumer
Affairs Bureau, oft campus stu
dent problems, the Graduate-
Student Association, and the
Household Items Exchange pro
ject.
The COP also intends to work
with the California Organization
of Private University Students
(CORPUS) to lobby in Sac
ramento on behalf of the Stan
ford community concerning such
issues as student loans, fair hous
ing laws, and restrictions on the
Educational Testing Service.
