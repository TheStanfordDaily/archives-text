# AIC: answers to academic queries
## 
### 
At some point during the
career of nearly every Stanford
student, he or she has an
academic question that seem
ingly begs an answer.
More often than not. however,
the Academic Information
Center (AIC). located on the
third floor of Old Union, has just
the solution.
The purpose of the AIC is to
help undergraduates define and
achieve their educational goals,
and, toward this end. serve as a
clearinghouse of academic in
formation.
One of the most frequently
used AIC resources, a vast col
lection of literature on other col
leges. universities and graduate
schools, enables students to

make plans for their education in
the summer or after they have
left the University.
The AIC also pro\ ides prepro
fessional counseling, especially
lor those students anticipating a
career in business, law or
medicine.
In all of its preprofessional ad
vising. the AIC encourages stu
dents to consider the career al
ternatives available in every
field.
Last but not least, the center
supervises all undergraduates
who have not declared a major
and all interdepartmental
majors, and it keeps track of the
writing and departmental dis
tribution requirements of all stu
dents.
