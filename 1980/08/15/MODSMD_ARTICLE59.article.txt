# Room coordinators look for varied backgrounds, common interests
## How did I end up with this strange roommate? 
### Jim Mattson Staff Writer 
The process of selecting
freshman roommates isn't as
mysterious as some would have
it. According to Mike O'Reilly,
coordinator of this year's opera
tion. the project is, if anything,
marked by tedium. Matching up
over 1 500 people into dorms and
rooms is a job that can't be per
formed in haste.
Although planning for
freshman housing takes place
year round, the bulk of the work
begins in late April when
freshmen begin to return their
notifications of acceptance.
Anne Coxon, Director of the
Academic Information Center,
and O'Reilly, a Stanford senior
hired in April, make up an
academic and geographic profile
of the new class. Later, when the
actual job of putting freshmen
into dorms begins, this informa
tion will he used to help make the
composition of the interests of
the inhabitants of each dorm ac
curately reflect the makeup of
the new class.
A second freshman coor
dinator. Mark Breier, was hired

in early June. Breier, a former
editor of Approaching Stanford
and an RAin Larkin this past
year, worked with O'Reilly in
charting the actual configuration
of dorm space. Maps were drawn
showing each room in every
dorm, and indicating whether
the dorm is coed hy corridor or
by room.
By late June, the task of as
signing each freshman to a par
ticular dorm begins. The first
students drawn from the pools
are those who indicated that they
wish to participate in a
residentially-based freshman
seminar. They are placqd 111 the
dorm where the seminar meets.
Ten Western culture require
ment classes, each with about 20
students, are also residentiallv

based. Students enrolled in these
classes are assigned to specific
dorms. Another group of stu
dents who requested placement
in a cross-cultural theme house
are placed in the programs they
have requested.
The remainder of the class'is
divided by first choice in hous
ing. The Freshman Coordinators
go through and fill each dorm at
random, using the first choice for
housing freshmen indicated. As
houses fill, the coordinators arc
forced to shift to alternate
choices. They use the academic
and geographic data prepared
for the class to ensure that each
dorm is a microcosm of the rest
of the freshman class. The coor
dinators aim for diversity in
every dorm they fill.

Matching roommates begins
in late July. All information
about roommates is kept confi
dential until the freshmen actu
ally arrive; this ensures that all
students start out on an equal
footing.
Each freshman submits an in
formation card listing academic
and extracurricular interests.
The freshman coordinators use
this information to look for
common interests. But an equal
part of the residential education
experience is living with people
who have varying interests. The
coordinators try to put together
people from different geog
raphic regions and with different
majors. They also try to avoid
potential conflicts from such
heated issues as music prefer

ences and smoking habits.
