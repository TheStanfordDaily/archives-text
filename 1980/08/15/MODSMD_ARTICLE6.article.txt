# Poland faces industrial unrest
## 
### Michael Dobbs The Washington Post 
WARSAW — Industrial un
rest in Poland spread yesterday
to the shipbuilding port of
Gdansk, posing the most serious
challenge to the country's Com
munist authorities since a wave
of strikes began almost seven
weeks ago.
According to dissident
sources, some 15.000 workers
occupied the Lenin shipyard in
Gdansk and issued a list of
sweeping demands including the
disbandment of official trade un
ions. The Communist Party chief
in the region, Tadeusz
I is/bachn. was reported to be
negotiating with the strikers'
representatives.
The fact that unrest has now
spread to the key Baltic ports has
grave implications for Polish
leader Eds ard Gierek. who is be
lieved to be on vacation in the
So\ let Crimea. It was in Gdansk,
nearly 10 years ago, that work
ers' riots toppled the regime of
his predecessor. Wladyslaw
Gomulka. and led to Gierek's

rise to power.
In December 1970, police
tired at workers in an attempt to
disperse the crowds, reportedly
killing at least 55 people. This
time, there has been no sugges
tion that the authorities intend to
use violence, and intensive
negotiations are under way to
find a solution
But even assuming it is settled
peacefully, the new strike in
Gdansk represents a big chal
lenge to Gierek's prestige and
authority. It means that labor
troubles have now spread to
every important industrial center
in the country with the exception
of his own powerbase of Silesia
in the south.
As the strikes continue —
there have been over 150 of
them since meat prices were
raised July 1 —they appear to be
acquiring greater political im
pact. So far Polish officials have
insisted that the unrest is purely
economic.
In addition to the election of
new trade unions, the Gdansk
workers reportedly are asking

tor publication of their demands
in the official press. In a country
where the mass media is subject
to stringent censorship, this is
clearly a sensitive political issue.
So, too, is the demand that fam
ily allowances be raised to the
level enjoyed by the police.
The workers also demanded a
20 percent pay rise of some
20,000 zloties (s6B)and the can
cellation of meat price rises
which originally triggered the
strikes.
In a conciliatory gesture, the
shipyard management has ag
reed to reinstate two workers
who had been dismissed after
they advocated the formation of
free trade unions. They also ag
reed to build a memorial to
workers killed in the 1970 riots.
Last night both Polish state
radio and television devoted rare
commentaries to the labor un
rest. coverage of which has been
very scanty in the official media.
Most Poles have learned about
the strikes by listening to the
Polish-language broadcasts of
Radio Free Europe.
