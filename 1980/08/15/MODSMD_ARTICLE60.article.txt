"Why are Hamlet, Falstaff.
Lear, Juliet and Cleopatra more
alive than you and I?"
1 his question, asked entic
ingly in Approach in t> Stanford, is
answered 111 one of the more than
70 freshman seminars offered
here this year.
the University's freshman
seminar program, now in its 16th
year, is one of a number ot spe
cial programs that the University
otters to new students to make
their academic lives more
stimulating.
Other programs include
Freshman English, Freshman

Advising and SLE.
Since the l'ni\ersit\ intro
duced the seminar program.
John Goheen, professor
emeritus of philosophy and Uni
versity ombudsman, has been as
sociated with it.and he now
heads the program's Dean's Ad
visory Committee.
Not enough courses
Asked recently about this
year's offerings in the program.
Goheen said. "We don't have
enough." Although the Univer
sity. he continued, has tried to

provide enough openings in the
program to satisy the need of all.
"there will be a lot of people who
will be disappointed."
Goheen himself teaches a
freshman seminar, and he be
lieves that it and the others give
students a special chance "to
meet closely with a faculty
member." Thanks to the small
si/e of each seminar, he said, the
students in them have an "un
usual" opportunity for discus
sion and association with other
students and a professor.
"Where the content is success
ful and stimulating," lie added,

the seminar "opens up a whole
new horizon for freshmen."
The course offerings vary from
year to year, though the more
popular seminars— such as Go
heen's "Philosophy in Litera
ture" and kennell Jackson's
"Personal Journals" have be
come or are becoming regular
yearly offerings.
The number one seminar in
1979-80. judging by freshman
demand, was "Shakespeare's Vi
sion of the Human Scene" by
Newell Ford, an emeritus profes

sor in the English Department.
Another popular course offered
last year was "Temperatures
Low and Temperatures High"
taught by Steve St. Lorant. a de
partment head from SI.AC.
This year, for the first time ac
cording to Kathy Thoelecke.
Program Coordinator for
Freshmen/Sophomore Semi
nars. all of the Seminars will
satisfy the writing requirement
for the first time since the prog
ram was started.
The freshmen seminars are
occasionally linked with another
longstanding program.
Freshman English. This prog
ram. however, has been designed
to help students meet the Uni
versity's written composition re
quirement. and. unlike the semi
nar program, it is not intended to
give students another option for
their class schedule.
Still, the program does give
entering students a wide selec
tion of courses from which they
may choose to satisfy the re
quirement.
Yet another program with
which freshmen will quickly be
come familiar is the advising
program, which involves mem
bers of the University's faculty
and staff. Tania Granoff. Infor
mation Services Coordinator for
this year said that about 250 ad
visors will work with the
freshmen and transfer students
and that each advisor will have
about eight new advisees.
The Peer Advising Program,
now in its third year, intro
duces upperclassmen to the ad
vising process by having them
work with specific freshmen ad
visors. Two years ago. the [.earn
ing Assistance Center, coor
dinator of the project, used
Trancos, an all-freshmen dorm,
as a trial case, assigining to it 10
peer advisors.
This year, due to the positive
response to this new program the
range of dorms covered by this
system will be expanded to in
clude a larger percentage of the
Freshmen class.

"Why are Hamlet, Falstaff.
Lear, Juliet and Cleopatra more
alive than you and I?"
1 his question, asked entic
ingly in Approach in t> Stanford, is
answered 111 one of the more than
70 freshman seminars offered
here this year.
the University's freshman
seminar program, now in its 16th
year, is one of a number ot spe
cial programs that the University
otters to new students to make
their academic lives more
stimulating.
Other programs include
Freshman English, Freshman

Advising and SLE.
Since the l'ni\ersit\ intro
duced the seminar program.
John Goheen, professor
emeritus of philosophy and Uni
versity ombudsman, has been as
sociated with it.and he now
heads the program's Dean's Ad
visory Committee.
Not enough courses
Asked recently about this
year's offerings in the program.
Goheen said. "We don't have
enough." Although the Univer
sity. he continued, has tried to

provide enough openings in the
program to satisy the need of all.
"there will be a lot of people who
will be disappointed."
Goheen himself teaches a
freshman seminar, and he be
lieves that it and the others give
students a special chance "to
meet closely with a faculty
member." Thanks to the small
si/e of each seminar, he said, the
students in them have an "un
usual" opportunity for discus
sion and association with other
students and a professor.
"Where the content is success
ful and stimulating," lie added,

the seminar "opens up a whole
new horizon for freshmen."
The course offerings vary from
year to year, though the more
popular seminars— such as Go
heen's "Philosophy in Litera
ture" and kennell Jackson's
"Personal Journals" have be
come or are becoming regular
yearly offerings.
The number one seminar in
1979-80. judging by freshman
demand, was "Shakespeare's Vi
sion of the Human Scene" by
Newell Ford, an emeritus profes

sor in the English Department.
Another popular course offered
last year was "Temperatures
Low and Temperatures High"
taught by Steve St. Lorant. a de
partment head from SI.AC.
This year, for the first time ac
cording to Kathy Thoelecke.
Program Coordinator for
Freshmen/Sophomore Semi
nars. all of the Seminars will
satisfy the writing requirement
for the first time since the prog
ram was started.
The freshmen seminars are
occasionally linked with another
longstanding program.
Freshman English. This prog
ram. however, has been designed
to help students meet the Uni
versity's written composition re
quirement. and. unlike the semi
nar program, it is not intended to
give students another option for
their class schedule.
Still, the program does give
entering students a wide selec
tion of courses from which they
may choose to satisfy the re
quirement.
