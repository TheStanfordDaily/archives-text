# Freshman into Senior — a transition
## 
### 
Freshmen year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder why
you were stupid enough to show
up. You feel outclassed and
ridiculous, standing alone in a
mob of everyone else's friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rackets,
and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played L.ed Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; (b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all), so
you hide in UGLY all day to
avoid embarrassing disaster.
Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the nii>ht

after orientation you start count
ing the days until Christmas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you. You can rattle off
Mem Chu, Hoo Tow, SI.AC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to get
out of bed.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause a) you realize the course is
a lot harder than it's supposed to
be; b) your friends hit the beach
that day; c) you know the
teacher's aide and he'll let you
take the test later it you give him
a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start counting
the hours until the next party.
Somewhere between
"freshmen" and "senior" lies
most of a sampling of up
perclassmen's opinions of Stan
ford learning and lifestyle.

They say they found their first
year on the Farm "full of knocks
and highs," and every year after
"great fordoing what you want."
"You come here expecting to
study and work like hell for
grades," said a pre-med senior.
"They tell you the pressure is
terrific, that only rich, smart kids
go there, so watch out.
"The classes are tough but
there are easy ones too. And
some people are dumber than
you.
"That feeling of awe and wari
ness lasts two months."
By November of freshman
year, most students questioned
said they had hit the pits of study
ing and were ready to realize that
only the hard-core grad
school-bound really have to
worry about grades.
"You decide you can get away
with living a little," said a junior
Communication major. "Stan
ford becomes a great place to
taste the great college life.
"The important thing is to stay
in perspective. You've got to see
that games are great but play
them only when you can. If you
flunk out, you aren't helping
anybody."

Balancing work and play is the
hardest job for freshmen, up
perclassmen said. They called
"figuring what to do with your
self the toughest question of first
quarter."
"You reach a point where you
can become jock, nerd, partieror
whatever," said a senior biology
major." You pick a rut then dig
deep.
"The roles help especially
when you've got to handle emo
tional problems like homesick
ness or pressure to achieve."
Though less than 20 percent of
the upperclassmen questioned
found freshman year "very un
settling emotionally," most said
that they got "the jumps" now
and then.
"You can't reconcile being
where you are with anything,"
explained a junior economics
major. "You want familiarity,
safety, home."
But "in that span from Sep
tember to March you change.
You grow a shell that protects
you from emotional problems. It
you don't, you've got trouble.
"You grow so much that if you
don't grow up," you'll go crazy."

said they had hit the pits of study
ing and were ready to realize that
only the hard-core grad
school-bound really have to
worry about grades.
"You decide you can get away
with living a little," said a junior
Communication major. "Stan
ford becomes a great place to
taste the great college life.
"The important thing is to stay
in perspective. You've got to see
that games are great but play
them only when you can. If you
flunk out, you aren't helping
anybody."

Balancing work and play is the
hardest job for freshmen, up
perclassmen said. They called
"figuring what to do with your
self the toughest question of first
quarter."
"You reach a point where you
can become jock, nerd, partieror
whatever," said a senior biology
major." You pick a rut then dig
deep.
"The roles help especially
when you've got to handle emo

ness or pressure to achieve."
Though less than 20 percent of
the upperclassmen questioned
found freshman year "very un
settling emotionally," most said
that they got "the jumps" now

"You can't reconcile being
where you are with anything,"
explained a junior economics
major. "You want familiarity,
safety, home."
But "in that span from Sep

You grow a shell that protects
you from emotional problems. It

Freshmen year at Stanford.
That first day you wonder why
you were stupid enough to show
up. You feel outclassed and
ridiculous, standing alone in a
mob of everyone else's friends.
You're the only one without
perfect teeth, five tennis rackets,
and 800s on the SAT.
Only you miss your first lec
ture because you can't find the
classroom.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause: a) the folks next door
played L.ed Zeppelin until 4
a.m.; (b) food service spaghetti
gave you indigestion; c) you
didn't study enough (at all), so
you hide in UGLY all day to
avoid embarrassing disaster.
Your room looks like Camp
Pendleton, your roommate like
Albert Einstein and the nii>ht

after orientation you start count
ing the days until Christmas.
Senior year at Stanford.
That first day you check out
the freshmen and wonder who
was crazy enough to let them in.
You are "at home" because
you recognize half the faces
around you. You can rattle off
Mem Chu, Hoo Tow, SI.AC and
Dink as you plan the year's
"mick" classes and practical
jokes.
You miss your first class be
cause you're too hung over to get
out of bed.
You also miss test no. 1 be
cause a) you realize the course is
a lot harder than it's supposed to
be; b) your friends hit the beach
that day; c) you know the
teacher's aide and he'll let you
take the test later it you give him
a stab at a good excuse.
Your room looks like hell,
your roommates are licking the
lint off of the carpet and every
morning after you start counting
the hours until the next party.
Somewhere between
"freshmen" and "senior" lies
most of a sampling of up
perclassmen's opinions of Stan
ford learning and lifestyle.

They say they found their first
year on the Farm "full of knocks
and highs," and every year after
"great fordoing what you want."
"You come here expecting to
study and work like hell for
grades," said a pre-med senior.
"They tell you the pressure is
terrific, that only rich, smart kids
go there, so watch out.
"The classes are tough but
there are easy ones too. And
some people are dumber than
you.
"That feeling of awe and wari
ness lasts two months."
