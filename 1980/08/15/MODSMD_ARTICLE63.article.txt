# ACADEMIA
## Understanding real world focus of innovative study 
### Robin Millington Staff Writer 
"l never let my schooling in
terfere with my education,"
Mark Twain once said.
The writer could not have
been more right, because stu
dents in rigorous academic prog
rams often find that their
classwork shelters them from the
realities and rigors of the "real"
world - and perhaps leads them
to a misunderstanding of it.
The Office of Ex
tradepartmcntal Programs at
tempts to correct this potential
problem with four programs de
signed to round out under
graduates' academic education.
Sponsored by the office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
the programs office (located in
590 A Old Union) offers stu
dents opportunities to conduct
research, to participate in group
or individual student-initiated
projects and to work in the
community.
Student-initiated projects are
offered for academic credit by
the Student Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education
(SCIRE), which has available a
$4000 fund to help finance in
novative projects.
According to Judy Adams,
professional co-director of
SCIRE, "The projects are either
individual or group projects, like
Ram's Head. Individual projects
range from how to run a small
business to Native American
Law."
Student Co-coordinator Ouil
lermo Nordarse noted "the in
novative fund is not used for stu
dent research," but rather is used
for events series, often with cul
tural themes.
SCIRE also sponsors intern
ships within the community and
organizes task forces to evaluate
different aspects of Stanford life.
The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) was initiated by stu
dents in 1969 in an effort to in
volve students in solving urgent
social and political problems. In
the past, SWOPSI workshops
have enabled students to work

with exceptional children, to
study the role of women in local
government and to teach swim
ming to nearby disabled chil
dren.
Student Co-coordinator Linda
Gardner said there "are mini
courses and full quarter courses
as well as residence-based
courses."
She said this year some prog
rams offered are: "Politics of
Energy." "Asian-American Lit
erature," "Conscription." and
"Ethical Issues in Business"
(which will be a mini-course).
SVVOPSI also serves as a re
source center for the develop-

ment by students of public events
and programs of an educational
nature. In addition, though many
of the instructors in SWOPSI
courses are members of the
community, many students are
actively involved as teachers and
are encouraged to work with the
SWOPSI staff.
Both projects have both a
full-time professional coor
dinator and a part- time student
coordinator in order to make the
projects more accessible to stu
dents, according to Laura
Selznick, director for the Under
graduate Special Program.
The Undergraduate Research
Opportunities program offers
students a chance to do profes
sional research for a professor in
any one of a number of fields.
The office fills research jobs in
six general categories: engineer
ing. social science, humanities,
education/psychology, the phys
ical sciences and biology/

medicine. About 100 professors
offer more than 120 research
positions throughout the year.
The office also encourages
students to design their own re
search projects, using the prog
ram office as their resource. Stu
dents in all projects receive cre
dit at the rate of one unit per
three hours academic work per
week, and, according to
Selznick, "about five percent of
the positions are paid."
The Undergraduate Special
Program offers a curriculum that
resembles those provided free by
other universities - except that
Stanford's program enjoys a bit

more legitimacy and support.
This year, the program will
provide courses that encompass
a wide variety of topics, includ
ing for example "Corporation
and Society," "Stock Options,"
"Women and Competence: Re
sponding to Social Change,"
"Practical Speech Communica
tion," "Women's Health," and
"Small Business Management."
Any student who wishes to
teach, or have a course taught,
should contact Selznick at 497-
3828.

Student-initiated projects are
offered for academic credit by
the Student Center for Innova
tion in Research and Education
(SCIRE), which has available a
$4000 fund to help finance in
novative projects.
According to Judy Adams,
professional co-director of
SCIRE, "The projects are either
individual or group projects, like
Ram's Head. Individual projects
range from how to run a small
business to Native American
Law."
Student Co-coordinator Ouil
lermo Nordarse noted "the in
novative fund is not used for stu
dent research," but rather is used
for events series, often with cul
tural themes.
SCIRE also sponsors intern
ships within the community and
organizes task forces to evaluate
different aspects of Stanford life.
The Stanford Workshop on
Political and Social Issues
(SWOPSI) was initiated by stu
dents in 1969 in an effort to in
volve students in solving urgent
social and political problems. In
the past, SWOPSI workshops
have enabled students to work

with exceptional children, to
study the role of women in local
government and to teach swim
ming to nearby disabled chil
dren.
Student Co-coordinator Linda
Gardner said there "are mini
courses and full quarter courses
as well as residence-based
courses."
She said this year some prog
rams offered are: "Politics of
Energy." "Asian-American Lit
erature," "Conscription." and
"Ethical Issues in Business"
(which will be a mini-course).
SVVOPSI also serves as a re
source center for the develop-

ment by students of public events
and programs of an educational
nature. In addition, though many
of the instructors in SWOPSI
courses are members of the
community, many students are
actively involved as teachers and
are encouraged to work with the
SWOPSI staff.
Both projects have both a
full-time professional coor
dinator and a part- time student
coordinator in order to make the
projects more accessible to stu
dents, according to Laura
Selznick, director for the Under
graduate Special Program.
The Undergraduate Research
Opportunities program offers
students a chance to do profes
sional research for a professor in
any one of a number of fields.
The office fills research jobs in
six general categories: engineer
ing. social science, humanities,
education/psychology, the phys
ical sciences and biology/

medicine. About 100 professors
offer more than 120 research
positions throughout the year.
The office also encourages
students to design their own re
search projects, using the prog
ram office as their resource. Stu
dents in all projects receive cre
dit at the rate of one unit per
three hours academic work per
week, and, according to
Selznick, "about five percent of
the positions are paid."
The Undergraduate Special
Program offers a curriculum that
resembles those provided free by
other universities - except that
Stanford's program enjoys a bit

more legitimacy and support.
This year, the program will
provide courses that encompass
a wide variety of topics, includ
ing for example "Corporation
and Society," "Stock Options,"
"Women and Competence: Re
sponding to Social Change,"
"Practical Speech Communica
tion," "Women's Health," and
"Small Business Management."
Any student who wishes to
teach, or have a course taught,
should contact Selznick at 497-
3828.

"l never let my schooling in
terfere with my education,"
Mark Twain once said.
The writer could not have
been more right, because stu
dents in rigorous academic prog
rams often find that their
classwork shelters them from the
realities and rigors of the "real"
world - and perhaps leads them
to a misunderstanding of it.
The Office of Ex
tradepartmcntal Programs at
tempts to correct this potential
problem with four programs de
signed to round out under
graduates' academic education.
Sponsored by the office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
the programs office (located in
590 A Old Union) offers stu
dents opportunities to conduct
research, to participate in group
or individual student-initiated
projects and to work in the
community.
