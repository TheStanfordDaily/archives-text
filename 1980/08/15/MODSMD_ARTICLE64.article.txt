# Class round-up: courses not to miss
## 
### Brad Brockbank Staff Writer 
The most common misconcep
tion among entering students
who have nerd-like tendencies is
that the lreshman class schedule
must consist of such courses as
Math 41. Chemistry 31 and
Physics 21.
While each ol these classes be
ginsa well-attended, informative
series of courses here at Stan
ford. anyone who piles two out of
three on the same study list may
find themselves getting to know
intimately the carrels of Meyer
Library.
If you find yourself with a
roommate who shows signs of
impending nerd-ism, it is up to
you to set that person back on
tin.- road to peace of mind and
time away from the library.
Fortunately, Stanford offers a
number ol popular courses
which avoid the rigorous
problem-set lifestyle of math,
physics and chem.
The following is a list of a
number of courses that many re
turning students have found in
teresting, enjoyable and
thought-provoking. The list is by
no means complete, but it should
aid you in the preparation of a
balanced course schedule.
Survey courses
Survey courses are designed to
give students a broad overview
ol a subject, without the rigorous
detail of upper division courses.
Some of the more popular are:

Economics 1: This course,
taught by the respected John
Gurley, is one of the most
widely-taken courses each fall.
Students are taught the basics of
economic theory and analysis,
and though these might be a bit
tedious at times, they are consi
dered extremely valuable for
students today.
Psychology 1: Taught by Phil
lip Ximbardo, a nationally
renowned expert on shyness
(among other things), this class is
lively and interesting and will not
load you down with work.
History 1: Modern Europe: A
difficult but very rewarding
course. Although the workload
is significant, it is, lor the most
part, enjoyable.
Art 1: The subject matter is
the strong point of this course,
which is billed as "a topical in
troduction to the history and ap
preciation of architecture,
sculpture and painting."
Philosophy 1: God, Sell and
World. Your basic survey course
in a tield that lew have experi
ence with (but many find very
intriguing). Athletics for the
mind.
Lesser known
hut recommended
Besides the survey courses,
there are also a number of
courses that are not as large but
still receive high praise from
those who have taken them.
These include:

Political Science 35: How Na
tions Deal with Each Other. A
good general course for
everyone and especially recom
mended for students who may
wish to continue in history, polit
ical science or international rela
tions.
Political Science 10: Ameri
can Government — everything
you wanted to know about it, and
didn't care to ask. This course
has a significant workload, but
most students have found it very
valuable.

Applied Physics 15: The Na
ture of the Universe. An excel
lent overview of the Big Picture
our universe — covering dis
cussion of all sorts of fascinating
phenomena. The workload is re
latively light and makes a fine
addition to course schedules
which include more intensive
classes.
Humanities 61: Western
Thought and Literature. "The
World of Classical Antiquit\."
taught by Antony Raubitschek,
is popular in part because of the
reputation of this tine instructor.
