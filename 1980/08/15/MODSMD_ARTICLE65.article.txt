# Western Culture again required
## 
### Lynne Dombrowski Monica Gutman Staff Writers 
The Western Culture program
begins its third year here, for the
first time a requirement for the
freshman class.
Instead of merely another
series of electives offered to stu
dents at the University, the
Western Culture program is now
mandatory for the class of '84.
The classes are open to other
students also.
Seven Sequences
Consisting of seven three
quarter sequences of classes, the
program provides its students
"with a sense of origins and con
tinuity," according to Professor
of English Ron Rebholz.
"It's good to prefer something
after contemplating it. after re
flection on it."he said, "rather
than just preferring it because it
is what one has immediately inh
erited from one's folks."
Rebholz is also coordinator of
the program.
Requirement
The faculty senate decided last
fall to institute a Western Cul
ture sequence as a University re
quirement. Stanford has not had
such a requirement since the
Western Civilization classes
were abandoned about ten years
ago.

This year the University will
again offer Western Culture
1,2,3. a series that was intro
duced as a pilot program two
years ago and which emphasizes
"great works of culture from the
ancient world to the earlier 20th
century," said Rebholz.
These classes averaged SO stu
dents per quarter and received a
"very, very favorable response,
both to the course and the
teachers," according to Rebholz.
Expanded
In 1980-81. the Western Cul
ture Program has expanded to
include four relatively new
three-quarter sequences, as well
as the three long-standing and
well-established series that are
popular among students of all
classes.
In addition to Western Cul
ture 1.2.3 is "Ideas in Western
Culture A.8.C." offered
through the departments of
Philosophy and Religious
Studies. These courses study
'"The Birth of Western
Philosophy," "Faith and
Reason," and"The World De
mystified."
The Western Culture program
also includes a sequence of
courses that each quarter study
the development of a different
theme in literature. This series is

offered through the department
of Comparative Literature (21,
22, 23).
A different approach is of
fered through the program in
Values. Technology and Society
(VTS 1,2,3). According to Re
bholz, the professors in these
classes will try to do something
exciting and difficult, which is tit
place technology in its historical
context, to understand the role
of technology in the develop
ment of Western Culture."
The other three options within

the Western Culture program
are the Structured Liberal Edu
cation program (SLE),
Humanities hi, 62, bland His
tory 1,2,3. The latter, said Re
bholz, will have a revised syl
labus, so as to include some
material from the period prior to
the Reformation.
Rebholz also said that open
ings remain in all of the sequ
ences except SLE, and he en
couraged students to give one or
more of them a try.
