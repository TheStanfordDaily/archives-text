# LAC sharpens learning skills
## 
### 
At Stanford, where the aver
age high school grade point av
erage of entering freshmen is
3.8, some of the most popular
classes teach students how to
study.
Offered by the Learning As
sistance Center (LAC), the
courses help students improve
their reading and vocabulary
abilities and sharpen their learn
ing skills.
But unlike learning centers at
many other schools, the LAC is
not primarily a remedial center
â€” though students with
academic problems are certainly
encouraged to take advantage of
the LACs facilities.
The LAC designs its programs
to serve the needs of very bright,
able learners, and thus it not only
helps students learn more effi
ciently, but it also offers nine
classes that teach students the
skills of tutoring and peer coun
seling.

In addition, the center pro
v ides non-credit workshops on
time management, test prepara
tion and test anxiety, and it offers
a full range of reference material
on reading and study skills.
Located in Meyer 123, the
LAC has served more than 1000
students a year since its inception
in 1972. Although the center is
funded by the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies, more
than 10 percent of the student
clients are graduate students.
The center has helped to de
velop tutoring programs in indi
vidual departments, such as the
Physics Reference Frame, the
Chemistry Information Room
and the Math Consulting Center,
and it has also developed courses
and services for faculty and staff.
Students may enroll in credit
courses or the non-credit work
shops, or they may drop in at the
center anytime during the quar
ter for individual help.
