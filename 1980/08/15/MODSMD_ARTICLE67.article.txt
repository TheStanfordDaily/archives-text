# Discovering the libraries
## 
### 
Although origianlly lib
raries may have been in
tended as repositories of
printed knowledge — and no
more — they are now build
ings in which students seeking
knowledge may settle for
protracted periods.
Libraries today thus have a
dual function: they serve as
storehouses of information,
and they offer themselves as
places to commune with that
information.
Stanford's Cecil B. Green
Library is a good example of a
library that is predominantly
storehouse in conception: it
does an excellent job of keep
ing a great many books (al
most a million at last count)

dry and free form the depra
dations of hungry rodents,
and it is relatively non
conducive to serious study
ing.
On the other hand, Meyer,
the undergraduate library,
excels in its function as a tem
ple of communion. Students
may enter Meyer on a Satur
day afternoon and find it fil
led with academic devotees,
all raptly communing, barely
able to tear themselves away
as closing time nears.
Most of the other libraries
on campus fall somewhere
between these extremes. The
Classics Dept. library, for
example, is occasionally an
excellent place to study, be

cause it is quiet and filled with
a sense of erudition. At other
times, however, some of the
department's physical fix
tures — such as its graduate
students — make the library
wholly inhospitable.
Some of the middle-size
libraries, however, strike a
nice balance between the two
functions. Notable in this re
spect is the Art and Architec
ture Library.
The Earth Sciences Library
has comfortable furniture and
study areas well-integrated
among the books — though
the building's large windows
and high ceilings keep the lib
rary's temperatures a bit too
cool.
