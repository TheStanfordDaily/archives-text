MORADABAD. India â€”
Stray pigs desecrating a Mos
lem prayer meeting triggered
riots in which scores of people
were killed, residents of this
northern India city said yes
terday. Police placed the
death toll at 86.
"1 saw the pigs and the
police, who were standing
near them on Wednesday as if
they had nothing to do." said
Mohammad Sharif, a brass
worker who witnessed the
tragedy.
"People began hurling
stones at the animals to drive
them away but the police
thought we were aiming at
them. They fired and our
people fled in panic in all di
rections. Many were tram
pled to death," said Sharif.
40. He said three relatives
were killed.
Pork is taboo for Moslems
and a pig at Islamic prayers
amounts to desecration.
About 60,000 Moslems had
gathered at the Idgah mosque
compound to celebrate ld
01-Fitr, the feast ending
Ramadan, the holy Moslem
month. India, which is pre

dominantly Hindu, has one of
the largest Moslem popula
tions in the world, about 65
million of a total Indian popu
lation of 676 million.
A top police official said
that 86 people died in rioting
when Moslem mohs fought
with police parties and at
tacked Hindu homes and
stores.
However, his version of the
pig incident was that "some
mischief makers" whom he
did not identify had spread
rumors that pigs were driven
into the prayer ground.
Police superintendent D.V.
Mehta told reporters that
mobs also beat to death a top
district official and four police
constables. Five policemen
were still missing, he said.
A curfew was ordered for
the violence-ravaged city but
officials said calm was re
stored only after five hours of
bloody street battles.
Policemen armed with
rilles and cane clubs patrolled
the narrow, deserted streets.
Most stores had closed al
though small groups of
people sat or stood outside
their homes watching the
police.
