# Student Directory under new management
## 
### Mike Hale Staff Writer 
for people tired of wondering
when Springsteen's new album
will come out. Stanford has its
own guessing game. It's called
"When will the Student Direc
tory be ready," and 111 recent
years has driven more than a few
students to drink and worse.
The Directory (full name,
Stanford Student Directory) is a
thin book, traditionally resembl
ing a cheap science fiction
magazine, whose main feature is
a 60-page listing of the names,
addresses and telephone num
bers of Stanford students,
graduate, undergraduate and
professional. This listing is com
piled by the Registrar's Office
from the "address cards" stu
dents fill out at registration (and
you thought they were just an
excuse to get you to sit still for
five minutes).
It can be especially useful for
freshmen, whose innumerable
new friends tend to fade away
without attached telephone
numbers. The Directory also
contains a prefatory section enti
tled "While You Are Here"
which details the many organiza
tions run by and for students at
Stanford, emphasizing those
which accommodate student in
volvement.

So, everyone wants a direc
tory; and anyone can have one,
free of charge. Upon publication
sufficient copies are sent to the
student residences to ensure that
each student gets his own. Fa
culty members and University
offices also receive copies. The
only question is, when?
A bit of history may be in
order here. Through the 1976-
77 issue, the Directory was pro
duced, in its entirety, by the Of
fice of the Registrar. It contained
only the student listings, sold for
75 cents, and regularly appeared
a month or so after registration
(this delay is due to the fact that
registration is not over until
mid-October, after which a
computer run of the listings takes
another two weeks and must be
followed by typesetting and
printing. The directory cannot
appear before mid-November).
The ASSU, spotting a chance
to gainfully employ more stu
dents (and perhaps make some
money in advertising), asked for
and was given permission to pub
lish the Directory. Their first
issue came out when this year's
seniors were freshmen. Their
third, and last, appeared last
year. Or this year, if you'd
rather. In January.
Admittedly, the Directory was
now free, but it would have taken

quite a bit of nerve to charge for
it at the end of Winter quarter.
Most people know where their
friends are by then. The ASSIJ
knew where its best interests lie,
and announced that it was no
longer interested in publishing
the Directory.
The 1980-81 Directory has
evolved into a hybrid produc
tion. It is back under University
control, this time under the au
spices of the Office of Student
Activities (whose more general
functions you can read about in
the Directory). QSA's role, how
ever, is strictly supervisory, and a
small group of students has
toiled through the summer to
give its peers the Directory on
time. And to make it attractive,
informative, and self-supporting
in the bargain.
Jim Mattson and Cici Orem
land are project director and bus
iness manager, respectively, for
this year's issue. They have been
on the job since late June, often
working closely with OSA as
sociate dean Patricia Brandt.
Mattson, who will be a senior this
fall, has overall responsibility for
the publication.
Besides assembling the
" While You Are Here" section,
Mattson's responsibilities have
included designing the cover and
other sections of the book.

negotiating with the Registrar's
Office to ensure the accuracy ol
the student listings, and occa
sionally answering the tele
phones when the OSA secretary
takes a break.
The more public side of the
project has fallen to Oremland,
who will be a junior this fall. Her
job is to ensure that the Direc
tory's SI 2,000 budget is paid for
by advertisers, and not the Uni
versity or its students.
Aiding her in this endeavor
has been a merry band of sales
people, varying in size and
makeup but never exceeding 10
more or less dedicated members.
Roaming the peninsula from
Menlo I'ark to Mountain View.

they have sold space to pizza par
lors, travel agents, churches and
maternity wear shops. Almost
anything a student might want to
spend money on will be adver
tised in the hack of the Directory.
All of these jobs will be open
ing for interested students later
this year.
But the big question remains,
of course, will it be on time? Pro
ject Director Mattson assures us
it will; his target date is
Fhanksgiving week, and barring
a major catastrophe the Direc
tory will be in the dormitories by
then. But one never knows. In
the meantime, write down your
Iricnds' phone numbers.

So, everyone wants a direc
tory; and anyone can have one,
free of charge. Upon publication
sufficient copies are sent to the
student residences to ensure that
each student gets his own. Fa
culty members and University
offices also receive copies. The
only question is, when?
A bit of history may be in
order here. Through the 1976-
77 issue, the Directory was pro
duced, in its entirety, by the Of
fice of the Registrar. It contained
only the student listings, sold for
75 cents, and regularly appeared
a month or so after registration
(this delay is due to the fact that
registration is not over until
mid-October, after which a
computer run of the listings takes
another two weeks and must be
followed by typesetting and
printing. The directory cannot
appear before mid-November).
The ASSU, spotting a chance
to gainfully employ more stu
dents (and perhaps make some
money in advertising), asked for
and was given permission to pub
lish the Directory. Their first
issue came out when this year's
seniors were freshmen. Their
third, and last, appeared last
year. Or this year, if you'd
rather. In January.
Admittedly, the Directory was
now free, but it would have taken

quite a bit of nerve to charge for
it at the end of Winter quarter.
Most people know where their
friends are by then. The ASSIJ
knew where its best interests lie,
and announced that it was no
longer interested in publishing
the Directory.
The 1980-81 Directory has
evolved into a hybrid produc
tion. It is back under University
control, this time under the au
spices of the Office of Student
Activities (whose more general
functions you can read about in
the Directory). QSA's role, how
ever, is strictly supervisory, and a
small group of students has
toiled through the summer to
give its peers the Directory on
time. And to make it attractive,
informative, and self-supporting
in the bargain.
Jim Mattson and Cici Orem
land are project director and bus
iness manager, respectively, for
this year's issue. They have been
on the job since late June, often
working closely with OSA as
sociate dean Patricia Brandt.
Mattson, who will be a senior this
fall, has overall responsibility for
the publication.
Besides assembling the
" While You Are Here" section,
Mattson's responsibilities have
included designing the cover and
other sections of the book.

negotiating with the Registrar's
Office to ensure the accuracy ol
the student listings, and occa
sionally answering the tele
phones when the OSA secretary
takes a break.
The more public side of the
project has fallen to Oremland,
who will be a junior this fall. Her
job is to ensure that the Direc
tory's SI 2,000 budget is paid for
by advertisers, and not the Uni
versity or its students.
Aiding her in this endeavor
has been a merry band of sales
people, varying in size and
makeup but never exceeding 10
more or less dedicated members.

lors, travel agents, churches and
maternity wear shops. Almost
anything a student might want to
spend money on will be adver
tised in the hack of the Directory.
All of these jobs will be open
ing for interested students later
this year.
But the big question remains,
of course, will it be on time? Pro
ject Director Mattson assures us
it will; his target date is
Fhanksgiving week, and barring
a major catastrophe the Direc

when Springsteen's new album

"When will the Student Direc

years has driven more than a few
students to drink and worse.
The Directory (full name,
Stanford Student Directory) is a
thin book, traditionally resembl
ing a cheap science fiction
magazine, whose main feature is
a 60-page listing of the names,
addresses and telephone num
bers of Stanford students,
graduate, undergraduate and
professional. This listing is com
piled by the Registrar's Office
from the "address cards" stu
dents fill out at registration (and
you thought they were just an
excuse to get you to sit still for
five minutes).
It can be especially useful for
freshmen, whose innumerable
new friends tend to fade away
without attached telephone
numbers. The Directory also
contains a prefatory section enti
tled "While You Are Here"
which details the many organiza
tions run by and for students at
Stanford, emphasizing those
which accommodate student in
volvement.
