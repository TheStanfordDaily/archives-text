If and when students think
about what they are going to do
after they leave Stanford, they
might think about visiting the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC). located in White
Plaza next to the bookstore.
As its name indicates, the
CPPC helps students make deci
sions about their careers and find
them jobs after graduation.
The center has done quite well
in meeting these goals; in all but
one of the last 13 years, for
example, the CPPC has in
creased its job placement rate,
while placement centers at other
schools have had increasing dif
ficulty finding jobs for their
graduates.
Ralph Keller, director of the
CPPC, said that he does "not
know of any center (at any other
college) that has a career plan
ning program as extensive as this
one. We help individuals get
their act together so they have as
good a chance as possible" to get
the jobs they want, he said.
Although the CPPC helps
guide students toward possible
careers, it does not. Keller said,
"tell a student what to do. or de
cide for them what their needs
are."
Each year, the center or
ganizes about 100 seminars and
workshops that deal with career
options and opportunities. These
meetings also consider the pros
and cons of job hunting, methods
of resume writing and means to
improve self-assessment.
In addition, the center offers
individual counseling by perma
nent staff members and trained
peer counselors, and it maintains
a library stocked with literature
on career opportunities.

Any student, student spouse
or alumnus may register with the
CPPC and receive a weekly list
of jobs available in different
areas of specialization, such as
liberal arts and teaching.
Those who register may also
establish and maintain at the
CPPC a career file that contains
resumes and letter of recom
mendation. On request, the
center will send copies of the file
to prospective employers and
graduate schools.
"We send over 25,000 files

each year," Keller said. "We
have taken a lot of pride in our
placement files so that when they
go out from here, they look bet
ter than anybody else's."
The CPPC also helps arrange
campus interviews and company
recruiting efforts, making it pos
sible for students to meet with
representatix es of more than 500
companies each year.
Finally, the center operates
the Student Employment Office,
which handles part-time and
temporary employment in the
area.


Standing in line at Maples to pay the quarter's tuition is usually
staggering (how many checks do you write for close to $2000?)
or boring. Yet there's always someone coming up with a new
twist. This student, smartly attired in a suit, showed up with his
tuition in $1 bills. Those in the back of the line weren't thrilled,
hut the registrar accepted it nonetheless.
