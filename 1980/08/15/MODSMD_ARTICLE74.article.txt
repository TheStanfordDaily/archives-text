# ASSU round-up: recycling, t-shirts, flicks and concerts
## 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
All persons registered here are
automatically members ot the
Associated Students ot Stanford
University (ASSU), the stile rep
resentative ot the student body.
Every spring there is a general
election to appoint the Council
of Presidents (COP), a lour per
son executive body, and the
ASSU Senate, a 20-person legis
lative group that has the final

word in the ASSU.
Though spring elections pro
vide more continuity between
years by allowing senators to
prepare for fall quarter, they
prevent new students from being
voting members of the Senate or
COP. To help alleviate this prob
lem there are Senate and COP
associate positions that entail the
same responsibilities, according
to one of last year's ASSU task
force reports.
In addition to the many politi
cal aspects of the ASSU's func
tion, it also provides services to
students which include the

Course Guide, lecture notes,
legal counseling, linen, T-shirts,
recycling, weekly films, profes
sional musical entertainment,
the Restaurant Guide, typeset
ting, speakers and refrigerator
rental.
These projects and services
provide opportunity for student
involvement and a large portion
of the practical benefits of being
a registered student.

Special Events
Grossing more than $650,000
in revenues last year was the
ASSU Special Events. This pro
ject handles a substantial
amount of the professional musi
cal entertainment that comes to
the campus. Some of the 4'5 acts
that were brought here last year
were Stephan Stills, Chick
Corea, The Knack, Poco, Joan
Baez and many other well known
performers.
A show typically involves 100
to 150 students who work on
management, stage crew, sec
urity and concessions.

The programming has diver
sified in the last year and the pro
ject opened up a new facility in
the Tresidder Lounge, a small
room with good visibility and
pleasant atmosphere where stu
dents can see nationally known
acts.
Legal Services
The ASSU also provides free
legal services, primarily consul
tation with practicing attorneys.
Most of the problems handled
concern housing, consumer af
fairs, divorces, guardian matters,
incorporating small businesses,
wills, torts (such as car acci
dents), and criminal charges
(such as shoplifting and trespas
sing).
Manager Bonnie Senko en
courages people to think about
any legal problems as soon as
they come up.
"Students will let the situation
go until it gets critical, like a
week before the court date. The
attorneys are too busy to handle
that," she said.
Although legal representation
is not provided as part of the ser
vice, if a student has pursued all
avenues personally, the attor
neys will occasionally write let
ters on a student's behalf. In ad
dition, phone follow-ups are
common, Senko said.

Recycling
The Recycling Center is a pro
ject that is out to make its fee
assessment unnecessary as it
came within $50 of breaking
even on Spring Quarter's re
venues of $10,000.
Begun in January 1978, this
organization has grown to 20
paid student staffers. About 95
percent of the campus residences

arc supplied with big, green re
cycling bins. The recyclable
items are glass, paper,
cardboard, aluminum, oil and
whole wine bottles.
"It has been recognized as one
of the top campus recycling op
erations. We get inquiries from
other universities about starting
their own," manager Steve
Lautze said.
"It's a chance for people to be
come actively involved in con
servation issues. We also coop
erate with student class pro
jects," Public Awareness Coor
dinator Pat McFadden said.
Speakers Bureau
In the educational vein the
ASSU has the Speakers Bureau
which is dedicated to bringing
speakers to the campus either on
its own or in conjunction with
other student organizations.
"We have a double fee as
sessment and offer a clearing
house for those funds. Any or
ganization that has speakers
open to the public can apply for
funding," said manager Keith
Ogden.
In the past, the Bureau has
brought such people as Eliot
Richardson, Ralph Nader. Jerry
Rubin. Jane Fonda, Barry
Commoner, to name a few.
"We are always looking for
input concerning contacting
speakers. II someone can get a
speaker through personal ties,
we'd like to know about it."
Ogden emphasized.
Underscoring the project's at
tempt to round out the Stanford
learning experience the project's
plug is "for a dollar more you can
complete your education."
Typesetting
The ASSU Typesetting Shop,
located in the Storke Publica
tions Building, offers typeset
ting, paste-up, graphics and
camera services for campus stu
dent publications and for some
other organizations or individu
als issuing printed materials.
Flicks
The ASSU Sunday Flicks arc
just that: quality movies shown
in Memorial Auditorium every
Sunday evening of the quarter.

T-Shirts
The Customized T-Shirt Ser
vice. in the ASSU lobby, pro
vides intramural teams, student
and faculty organizations and in
di\ iduals the opportunity to have
their own distinctive designs put
on a variety of different styles of
t-shirts. Special designs are also
available.
Restaurant Guide
Published annually is the
ASSU Restaurant Guide. This
year almost 80 eating places of
different varieties will be co
vered. For those interested in re
viewing or managing, it is
primarily a summer operation
for release in the fall.
Refrigerators and Linen
Getting down to the basics, the
ASSU also rents small re
frigerators on a quarterly or an
nual basis. Costs for these run
$15 per quarter of $40 per year.

In addition the ASSU runs a
linen service which distributes
linen at points in student resi
dence halls on a weekly basis.
Fees run $21 per quarter to $47
per year.
Course Guide
Since March of 1979 the Uni
versity has required that teach
ing evaluation forms be sent out
to almost every class. The result
for the students is the ASSU
Course Guide.
Though the return and public
release of the forms is not re
quired of the professors, over
220 classes were covered last
year in three issues.

To handle this volume, a trac
tion of the potential, manager
Susan Voorvart says "we can use
people all the time and most pos
itions are paid. Also we'd like to
see some people come forward
for project manager, which
opens up in the spring."
The success of the $10,000
operation relies entirely on the
students' completing the forms
and the professors' returning
them. Voorvart wants to bring
"more legitimacy to the Guide in
the eyes of the students and the
faculty" through increased pro
fessorial responsibility in using
the forms, more class time for
their completion, and pre-dead
week hand out dates.

concern housing, consumer af
fairs, divorces, guardian matters,
incorporating small businesses,
wills, torts (such as car acci
dents), and criminal charges
(such as shoplifting and trespas
sing).
Manager Bonnie Senko en
courages people to think about
any legal problems as soon as
they come up.
"Students will let the situation
go until it gets critical, like a
week before the court date. The
attorneys are too busy to handle
that," she said.
Although legal representation
is not provided as part of the ser
vice, if a student has pursued all
avenues personally, the attor
neys will occasionally write let
ters on a student's behalf. In ad
dition, phone follow-ups are
common, Senko said.

Recycling
The Recycling Center is a pro
ject that is out to make its fee
assessment unnecessary as it
came within $50 of breaking
even on Spring Quarter's re
venues of $10,000.
Begun in January 1978, this
organization has grown to 20
paid student staffers. About 95
percent of the campus residences

arc supplied with big, green re
cycling bins. The recyclable
items are glass, paper,
cardboard, aluminum, oil and
whole wine bottles.
"It has been recognized as one
of the top campus recycling op
erations. We get inquiries from
other universities about starting
their own," manager Steve
Lautze said.
"It's a chance for people to be
come actively involved in con
servation issues. We also coop
erate with student class pro
jects," Public Awareness Coor
dinator Pat McFadden said.
Speakers Bureau
In the educational vein the
ASSU has the Speakers Bureau
which is dedicated to bringing
speakers to the campus either on
its own or in conjunction with
other student organizations.
"We have a double fee as
sessment and offer a clearing
house for those funds. Any or
ganization that has speakers
open to the public can apply for
funding," said manager Keith
Ogden.
In the past, the Bureau has
brought such people as Eliot
Richardson, Ralph Nader. Jerry
Rubin. Jane Fonda, Barry
Commoner, to name a few.
"We are always looking for
input concerning contacting
speakers. II someone can get a
speaker through personal ties,
we'd like to know about it."
Ogden emphasized.
Underscoring the project's at
tempt to round out the Stanford
learning experience the project's
plug is "for a dollar more you can
complete your education."
Typesetting
The ASSU Typesetting Shop,
located in the Storke Publica
tions Building, offers typeset
ting, paste-up, graphics and
camera services for campus stu
dent publications and for some
other organizations or individu
als issuing printed materials.
Flicks
The ASSU Sunday Flicks arc
just that: quality movies shown
in Memorial Auditorium every
Sunday evening of the quarter.

T-Shirts
The Customized T-Shirt Ser
vice. in the ASSU lobby, pro
vides intramural teams, student
and faculty organizations and in
di\ iduals the opportunity to have
their own distinctive designs put
on a variety of different styles of
t-shirts. Special designs are also
available.
Restaurant Guide
Published annually is the
ASSU Restaurant Guide. This
year almost 80 eating places of
different varieties will be co
vered. For those interested in re
viewing or managing, it is
primarily a summer operation
for release in the fall.
Refrigerators and Linen
Getting down to the basics, the
ASSU also rents small re
frigerators on a quarterly or an
nual basis. Costs for these run
$15 per quarter of $40 per year.

In addition the ASSU runs a
linen service which distributes
linen at points in student resi
dence halls on a weekly basis.
Fees run $21 per quarter to $47
per year.
Course Guide
Since March of 1979 the Uni
versity has required that teach
ing evaluation forms be sent out
to almost every class. The result
for the students is the ASSU
Course Guide.
Though the return and public
release of the forms is not re
quired of the professors, over
220 classes were covered last
year in three issues.

To handle this volume, a trac
tion of the potential, manager
Susan Voorvart says "we can use
people all the time and most pos
itions are paid. Also we'd like to
see some people come forward
for project manager, which
opens up in the spring."
The success of the $10,000
operation relies entirely on the
students' completing the forms
and the professors' returning
them. Voorvart wants to bring
"more legitimacy to the Guide in
the eyes of the students and the
faculty" through increased pro
fessorial responsibility in using
the forms, more class time for
their completion, and pre-dead
week hand out dates.

Jefferson Starship was one of the many entertainment acts which ASSU Special Events brought to
campus last year.
All persons registered here are
automatically members ot the
Associated Students ot Stanford
University (ASSU), the stile rep
resentative ot the student body.
Every spring there is a general
election to appoint the Council
of Presidents (COP), a lour per
son executive body, and the
ASSU Senate, a 20-person legis
lative group that has the final

word in the ASSU.
Though spring elections pro
vide more continuity between
years by allowing senators to
prepare for fall quarter, they
prevent new students from being
voting members of the Senate or
COP. To help alleviate this prob
lem there are Senate and COP
associate positions that entail the
same responsibilities, according
to one of last year's ASSU task
force reports.
In addition to the many politi
cal aspects of the ASSU's func
tion, it also provides services to
students which include the

Course Guide, lecture notes,
legal counseling, linen, T-shirts,
recycling, weekly films, profes
sional musical entertainment,
the Restaurant Guide, typeset
ting, speakers and refrigerator
rental.
These projects and services
provide opportunity for student
involvement and a large portion
of the practical benefits of being
a registered student.

Special Events
Grossing more than $650,000
in revenues last year was the
ASSU Special Events. This pro
ject handles a substantial
amount of the professional musi
cal entertainment that comes to
the campus. Some of the 4'5 acts
that were brought here last year
were Stephan Stills, Chick
Corea, The Knack, Poco, Joan
Baez and many other well known
performers.
A show typically involves 100
to 150 students who work on
management, stage crew, sec
urity and concessions.

The programming has diver
sified in the last year and the pro
ject opened up a new facility in
the Tresidder Lounge, a small
room with good visibility and
pleasant atmosphere where stu
dents can see nationally known
acts.
Legal Services
The ASSU also provides free
legal services, primarily consul
tation with practicing attorneys.
Most of the problems handled
concern housing, consumer af
fairs, divorces, guardian matters,
incorporating small businesses,
wills, torts (such as car acci

"We are always looking for
input concerning contacting
speakers. II someone can get a
speaker through personal ties,
we'd like to know about it."
Ogden emphasized.

Restaurant Guide
Published annually is the
ASSU Restaurant Guide. This
year almost 80 eating places of
different varieties will be co
vered. For those interested in re
viewing or managing, it is
primarily a summer operation
for release in the fall.
Refrigerators and Linen
Getting down to the basics, the
ASSU also rents small re
frigerators on a quarterly or an
nual basis. Costs for these run
$15 per quarter of $40 per year.

In addition the ASSU runs a
linen service which distributes
linen at points in student resi
dence halls on a weekly basis.
Fees run $21 per quarter to $47
per year.
Course Guide
Since March of 1979 the Uni
versity has required that teach
ing evaluation forms be sent out
to almost every class. The result
for the students is the ASSU
Course Guide.
Though the return and public
release of the forms is not re
quired of the professors, over
220 classes were covered last
year in three issues.

To handle this volume, a trac
tion of the potential, manager
Susan Voorvart says "we can use
people all the time and most pos
itions are paid. Also we'd like to
see some people come forward
for project manager, which
opens up in the spring."
The success of the $10,000
operation relies entirely on the
students' completing the forms
and the professors' returning
them. Voorvart wants to bring
"more legitimacy to the Guide in
the eyes of the students and the
faculty" through increased pro
fessorial responsibility in using
the forms, more class time for
their completion, and pre-dead
week hand out dates.
