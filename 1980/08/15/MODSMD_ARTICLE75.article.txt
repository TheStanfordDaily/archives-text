# Era of the student bands
## Phi Psi spurred outburst of talent 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
In the Spring of *7 l ) a talent
tilled campus residence called
Phi Psi spawned a rock band of
that name, putting the first color
on what was, as far as student
participation goes, a barren pic
ture of good time rock and roll at
Stanford.
"Phi Psi played music 1 liked
to hear. (Other) bands had got
ten slicker with no depth." said
Jim Ferrell, lead guitarist with
Rooftop Magic, a descendent of
the Phi Psi band.

The Phi Psi band only existed
that one hectic spring quarter but
gathered enough attention and
enthusiasm for the whole idea
that at least six other student and
ex-student bands were formed in
the next year.
"It stirred up a lot of closet
music," said Leslie Moulton. the
original lead vocal for Phi Psi.
now also with Rooftop.
Other bands that have ap
peared since then are Mariah.
Claude Monet. Wildebeest. Bay
Bop and A Little Night Music, all

but Monet having grown inde
pendently of Phi Psi.
"When 1 was a freshman, 1
thought no music was going on
here. I thought Stanford was no
place to come for music," said
Jeff Bell, bassist tor Rooftop.
But now. as Ferrell added,
"Stanford reminds me of a mini
Bay area music scene."
The band members are
unanimous about their main
motivation: more often than not,
it's unmitigated fun.
"We uo out to scream and eet

a big grin on." said Lyle Zim
merman. leader, guitarist and
writer for Claude Monet.
â– "It's more important that we
love it and enjoy it and the audi
ence enjoys it. (It's important)
for me to feel like l'\ e done well
in my own eyes. It's important to
me as a way of expressing my
self." said Mecca Burns, lead
vocalist for Wildebeest.
"The energy of the audience is
as inspiring to us as we are to
them. It's like we ha\e the in
struments hut we're all playing."

said Moulton, a senior here.
"When I was in college, things
like this didn't happen. Audi
ences were sedate; the bands
were commercial. The thingN
that have come from I'hi Psi have
been much more communal with
more feeling." recalled Ferrell, a
medical student here.
"What is really important is
the sound that emerges from the
depths of people," emphasized
Jay Field, guitarist for Wil
debeest. and not the sound of the
"shotgun guitarists" that comes

out of the studios, he added.
The effect of performing on
the players' lifestyles seems to
vary, though the consequences
of being short of time are always
present.
"Being in the band made seri
ous inroads into my free time and
1 seriously liked that." said Missy
Peabody, lead vocalist for
Claude Monet.
"We've arranged our working
life around our music." Field
said of his largely ex-student
band. He teaches at Mid-

Peninsula High, having finished
his master's in education here.
"It can make it hard on rela
tionships. It's hard with friends
who aren't in music. You talk
shop too much," said Jeff Silva,
Mariah keyboard player.
Though Mariah leader and
bassist Harmon Wang said that
"It really fucks up your studies,"
fellow band member Evan Braun
said "not always. It serves as an
outlet. You can work study
around it."
"Sophomore year I was going
nuts. It was a real pre-med year
and when I started with the band
I really enjoyed it." Braun con
tinued.
"It's not so much the time re
hearsing as the time getting ex
cited about things. I've spent
tour hours in Meyer thinking
about the next Friday night,"
Zimmerman said.
"You get some artistic license
in your life. You're a little bit
further from reality when you're
in a band. You can be fairly re
laxed about things. Once a week
you have people screaming at
you and not many people have
that much fun," he continued.
The good experience that the
band members have had gener
ates some hopes for extended
professional careers and some
players are very determined. The
optimism, however, is almost al
ways guarded.
"Everybody wants to make a
record, but each of us, at the
same time, know that there isn't
a good chance because of the
wicked competition. You know
it's just for the moment," Zim
merman said.
"The ones out there (in the
music business) that are starving
are all good. They're talented,
but they didn't get the break.
Everyone keeps that in mind.
That's why we're here (at Stan
ford ) instead of in a conservatory
locked up in a practice room,"
said Wayne Winborne, co-leader
and saxophone player for Bay
Bop.
"It'sgood to say we'll make it,
but we've found out that the
music industry doesn't give a shit
about you." observed Wang.
Despite his pessimism, he con
tinued to sav "We don't have this

hand together to be the next
Doobie Brothers, but we want to
support ourselves."
It should be noted that an
album drawing on the support of
the musicians in the area is being
taped by Larry Good, lead
guitarist for Claude Monet.
Though Mariah has managed
to construct a soundproofed
basement studio, they com
plained of a lack of facilities for
bunds on campus.
"There is very little practice
space for musicians. We used to
float around, play in the lounges.
We couldn't play in the house
because it was too loud." said
sophomore Matt State.
"It's a shame that at ten at
night a practice room is empty
and we're not allowed to use it."
Silva pointed out.
Wang thinks the Stanford ad
ministration doesn't believe rock
bands exist, but with a group
forming this fall called the Wild
Rose Band and at least one other
student joining an off campus
band, the Phi Psi concept that
students can run their own bands
will quickly become hard to ig
nore.

When the popular PhiPsi Rand broke up a few years ago. many of its members continued on with other
musical pursuits. One band which had its genesis in the PhiPsi Band is the Rooftop Magic Band.


Weekends may he "made for Michelob" but the first Friday afternoon of Spring Quarter is made
for many beers (and many kegs) at the ritual event held on the lawn of the Beta Iheta Pi fraternity
house. Just look for the crowd of rabble soaking up the sunshine to the accompaniment of loud
music on the side of Mayfield Avenue as you are about to drive through "that pesky stop sign."
That's a Beta Nooner!
