Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) is in its second
year as the Tresidder Union
organization that sponsors
"most of the programs
around Tresidder: arts, re
creation. lectures, films,
music, art exhibits." accord
ing to Lisa Verhovek,
STARTS program advisor.
The emphasis is on student
participation in the creation
and planning of programs, as
is evidenced by the six con
trolling committees which are
comprised almost entirely of
students. The six committees
consist of Music and Noon
Entertainment; Lectures and
Classes; Visual Arts; Per

forming Arts; Films and
One-Time Events.
Half of thf STARTS coor
dinated Noon Concerts on
the Tresidder front patio are
devoted to student perfor
mers. as well as a majority of
the Coffee House entertain
ment, Verhovek said.
The visual art displays on
the second floor of Tresidder
are contributions from Stan
lord students, staff, faculty
and alumni. There have also
been shows devoted entirely
to student work.
STARTS will also be coor
dinating a large part of Tre
sidder's involvement in Har
vest, a 12-hour orientation
event planned for the first
week in October.
