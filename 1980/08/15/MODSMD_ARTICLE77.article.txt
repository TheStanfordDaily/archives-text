# Alums and students benefit
## Association offers varied services 
### 
Many students believe that
alumni associations do no more
than throw tailgaters before
football games and send out
newsletters begging for money to
support the dear old alma mater.
With the Stanford Alumni As
sociation, however, that is defi
nitely not the case.

The association takes an active
and productive role in the life of
the University, providing ser
vices that facilitate student ac
cess to alumni across the nation.
Aluinni contact service
Perhaps the most valuable
service offered to students is the
Alumni Contact Service,

through which students seeking
information on various career
opportunities may contact
alumni working in the different
professions. The association has
listed in loose-leaf notebooks at
the Bowman Alumni House the
names of participating alumni in
Boston, New York, Los Angeles,
southwestern Washington and
Oregon and the Bay area.
The contact service is not a
placement service, but alumni
who participate do indicate
whether they might have full
time, part-time or summer jobs
available to students.
Washington employers
The Alumni Association also
supports the Stanford-in-
Government (SIG) program,
which helps students find jobs
and internships at all levels of
government — particularly the
federal.
Each spring, SIG sends lob
byists to Washington, D.C., to
contact potential employers and
to find housing in which students
might reside during their
Washington stay.
Brunches
In the winter and spring the
association sponsors senior
brunches, and, in the fall and
spring, individual alumni clubs
sponsor freshmen and senior
parties for students in their cities.
In addition, the association of
fers a number of scholarships, in
cluding the Pierce Memorial
Award, a $750 cash grant pre
sented to a student or group of
students interested in a project

that does not meet normal Uni
versity funding criteria.
Last year, the award went to
Counterpoint, a new women's
singing group on campus.
The J.E. Wallace Sterling
Award, presented for the first
time on Class Day in June 1979,
is given to a student nominated
by members of the senior class
and key administrators and fa
culty members for achievement
in academics, athletics and
community service.
With a membership of 47,000,
the Alumni Association has one
of the highest percentages of
graduates as members of any
alumnus organization — nearly
50 percent, versus about IS per
cent for organizations at com
parable schools.
Independent
The association is totally inde
pendent of the University and
engages in no fund-raising for
Stanford; that function is within
the purview of the University's
Office of Development.
Supported by membership
dues, the association offers many
programs specifically designed
for alumni — including summer
alumni colleges, reunions and
travel-study programs — and it
operates a chalet at Alpine
Meadows and a family lodge at
Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake
Tahoe.
Students interested in one or
more of the association's prog
rams are encouraged to drop by
the association's office at the
Bowman Alumni House.
