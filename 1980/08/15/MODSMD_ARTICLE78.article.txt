# GPU supports varied activities
## 
### Stephen Nash Staff Writer 
Possibly this article should
be subtitled "What is it like to
be gay at Stanford?" Since it
is impossible to interview the
1200 or so gay men and les
bians here, it is difficult to
answer that question. All I
can do is give you one per
son's perceptions of gay life
on and around the campus.
The focus for gay life here
is the Gay People's Union
(GPU), located on the second
floor of the Old Firehouse, on
Santa Theresa Street across
from Tresidder Union. GPU
spends most of its time or
ganizing social events and
handling the political issues of
concern to lesbian and gay
students at Stanford.
In terms of social events,
the most regular is the Wed
nesday night drop-in meet
ing. This is very informal,
with people getting together
to talk, play backgammon,
drink coke, or whatever. The
meeting begins at 8:30 p.m.
and continues until everyone
has left, usually around 1 1:30
p.m. Most Thursdays, some
special activity is scheduled,
such as a guest speaker or
maybe roller-skating.
Usually there are a couple
of other events that are or
ganized during the quarter.
The easiest way to find out
what is going on is to call the
answering tape (497-1488)
and listen to the recorded
message.
Politically, the GPU often
takes an active role. Every
year (usually at the end of
May) there is a Gay Aware
ness Week on campus with a
rally, a series of lectures, and
a number of gay performers
(last year, the San Francisco
Gay Men's Chorus and
Castleberry & Dupree per
formed). On a day to day
level the GPU tries to insure
that gay opinions are taken
into account when decisions
are being made which con
cern gay people on campus.
When cases of anti-gay dis
crimination on campus occur,
the GPU might arrange for
meetings between the people
involved, send letters to ap
propriate officials, publish an
article in the Daily, or, if the
situation seems desperate
enough, even stage a rally.
Much of this work, though, is
done on an ad hoc basis.
The community supports
specialized groups such as the
Women's Collective of GPU
which has its own special
meetings on Tuesday even
ings at 7:30. The first hour is
usually a discussion on some

pre-arranged topic; after
that, it's more informal.
Unfortunately, being gay at
Stanford is not just going to
parties and marching at ral
lies. If you are not out of the
closet, loneliness is probably
a lot more familiar than pride.
Walking up the steps at GPU
for the first time can require a
great deal of courage. It is dif
ficult enough to walk into a
room full of strangers and
strike up a conversation with
out having to worry about
"coming out" as well.
In order to help gay stu
dents deal with the problems
of being gay, the' Gay Coun
seling Group at the Bridge
was organized. On weekdays,
from 4 to 7 p.m., gay and les
bian students are there to lis
ten, be supportive, and if
necessary refer students to
other organizations which can
better serve them. Feel free to
call or drop in — it's some
times pleasant just to have
someone understanding to
talk with. Not long ago, the
group began a library of gay
related books, magazines,
and newspapers. Their collec
tion is growing rapidly, and
they even have a comfy
armchair to curl up in.
Also offered during Fall
Ouarter. a discussion group
for gay men who are new to
the gay community will be
held. It will meet at the
Bridge starting the second
week of the quarter and will
continue for about two
months.
There are a lot of mis
guided opinions about les
bians and gay men floating
around. As Harvey Milk once
said. "If I turned around
every time someone yelled.
'Faggot,' I'd end up walking
backwards." The Gay Speak
ers' Bureau tries to remedy
some of this. Women and
men from the group go into
dorms and classes to talk
about what it's like to be gay
and to let people know what
we look like.
Of course, gay life does not
end at the edge of campus.
San Francisco is our spiritual
home. (Where else could a
lesbian/feminist ice cream
parlor be found?) We have
our own baseball teams, our
own theaters, our own
churches, even our own
neighborhoods. There is a
certain fascination these days
for men with dark hair and
beards. Well, the corner of
Castro and Market has the
greatest concentration of elig
ible beards in the world.

which has its own special
meetings on Tuesday even
ings at 7:30. The first hour is
usually a discussion on some

pre-arranged topic; after
that, it's more informal.
Unfortunately, being gay at
Stanford is not just going to
parties and marching at ral
lies. If you are not out of the
closet, loneliness is probably
a lot more familiar than pride.
Walking up the steps at GPU
for the first time can require a
great deal of courage. It is dif
ficult enough to walk into a
room full of strangers and
strike up a conversation with
out having to worry about
"coming out" as well.
In order to help gay stu
dents deal with the problems
of being gay, the' Gay Coun
seling Group at the Bridge
was organized. On weekdays,
from 4 to 7 p.m., gay and les
bian students are there to lis
ten, be supportive, and if
necessary refer students to
other organizations which can
better serve them. Feel free to
call or drop in — it's some
times pleasant just to have
someone understanding to
talk with. Not long ago, the
group began a library of gay
related books, magazines,
and newspapers. Their collec
tion is growing rapidly, and
they even have a comfy
armchair to curl up in.
Also offered during Fall
Ouarter. a discussion group
for gay men who are new to
the gay community will be
held. It will meet at the
Bridge starting the second
week of the quarter and will
continue for about two
months.
There are a lot of mis
guided opinions about les
bians and gay men floating
around. As Harvey Milk once
said. "If I turned around
every time someone yelled.
'Faggot,' I'd end up walking
backwards." The Gay Speak
ers' Bureau tries to remedy
some of this. Women and
men from the group go into
dorms and classes to talk
about what it's like to be gay
and to let people know what
we look like.
Of course, gay life does not
end at the edge of campus.
San Francisco is our spiritual
home. (Where else could a
lesbian/feminist ice cream
parlor be found?) We have
our own baseball teams, our
own theaters, our own
churches, even our own
neighborhoods. There is a
certain fascination these days
for men with dark hair and
beards. Well, the corner of
Castro and Market has the
greatest concentration of elig
ible beards in the world.
Possibly this article should
be subtitled "What is it like to
be gay at Stanford?" Since it
is impossible to interview the
1200 or so gay men and les
bians here, it is difficult to
answer that question. All I
can do is give you one per
son's perceptions of gay life
on and around the campus.
The focus for gay life here
is the Gay People's Union
(GPU), located on the second
floor of the Old Firehouse, on
Santa Theresa Street across
from Tresidder Union. GPU
spends most of its time or
ganizing social events and
handling the political issues of
concern to lesbian and gay
students at Stanford.
In terms of social events,
the most regular is the Wed
nesday night drop-in meet
ing. This is very informal,
with people getting together
to talk, play backgammon,
drink coke, or whatever. The
meeting begins at 8:30 p.m.
and continues until everyone
has left, usually around 1 1:30
p.m. Most Thursdays, some
special activity is scheduled,
such as a guest speaker or
maybe roller-skating.
Usually there are a couple
of other events that are or
ganized during the quarter.
The easiest way to find out
what is going on is to call the
answering tape (497-1488)
and listen to the recorded
message.
Politically, the GPU often
takes an active role. Every
year (usually at the end of
May) there is a Gay Aware
ness Week on campus with a
rally, a series of lectures, and
a number of gay performers
(last year, the San Francisco
Gay Men's Chorus and
Castleberry & Dupree per
formed). On a day to day
level the GPU tries to insure
that gay opinions are taken
into account when decisions
are being made which con
cern gay people on campus.
When cases of anti-gay dis
crimination on campus occur,
the GPU might arrange for
meetings between the people
involved, send letters to ap
propriate officials, publish an
article in the Daily, or, if the
situation seems desperate
enough, even stage a rally.
Much of this work, though, is
done on an ad hoc basis.
The community supports
specialized groups such as the
Women's Collective of GPU
which has its own special
meetings on Tuesday even
ings at 7:30. The first hour is
usually a discussion on some

pre-arranged topic; after
