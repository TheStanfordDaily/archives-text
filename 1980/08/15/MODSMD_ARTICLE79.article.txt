# PAC-10 suspensions diminishes competition for post-season play
## 
### Ivan Maisel Staff Writer 
August 1 1 is not a day that
Rose Bowl officials care to re
member. After all. what it you
were giving a party and half the
guests were grounded?
Though only one Pacific-10
Conference school actually
makes the trip to Pasadena on
New Year's Da>. the elimination
of five league schools from the
running was not a pretty sight to
Rose Bowl officials. One of
those schools. USC. has been to
Pasadena more in the last two
decades than any dozen little old
ladies.
Nor was NBC-TV o\erjoved.
It seems the Rose Bowl network
can sell more beer and razor
blades when the Trojans play,
rather than one of the other
Pac-1 0 schools, like Washington
or Stanford.
Nevertheless, the league pres
idents and chancellors have pur
ported to punish L'SC. UCLA,
Oregon. Oregon State and
Arizona State by barring the
schools from any postseason
competition.
The two I.os Angeles schools
as well as Oregon State were
sidelined by transcript ir
regularities. Arizona State was
hit with these too. as well as re
ports of a slush fund.

Oregon, however, was hit the
hardest, both by the Pac-10 and
the NCAA. Several players who
received free airplane tickets
were sidelined, one for one game
and the others for a year by the
NCAA. The Pac-10 also took
awav three scholarships from the
Ducks.
Ouarterhack Reggie Ogburn.
who ran through the Stanford
defense last year like it was a
freeway, was the player sidelined
for one game. That one game
was Sept. 6 against the Cards,
and Stanford won 35-25. You
can only imagine what the Duck
offense would ha\ e been like had
Ogburn been there.
Now let's go over this business
of "getting tough."
1 irst of all. barring Oregon
State from postseason competi
tion is like barring Harold Stas
sen from running for president.
Why go to the trouble?
The four other schools did
have a legitimate shot at making,
it not the Rose Bowl, one of the
others that have sprouted lately
like so many weeds in college
football's garden.
On the surface, therefore, the
Pac-10 hierarchy has deprived
itself of hundreds of thousands ot
dollars in revenue. But take a
look at what they did not take
away.

I iist of all. there are I \ ap
pearances. Chough there is a lot
of money to be made from the
bowls, they are a one-shot deal.
NCAA rules state that teams
may be televised on ABC- I'Y's
Saturday meccas as many as five
times in two years.
That is also millions of dollars
which the Pac-10 will be receiv
ing. It the conference presidents
wanted to show that tin-* be
havior will not be tolerated, they
should have hit themselves in
their collective pocketbooks and
barred those schools from I \
appearances.
Though they cannot go to a
bowl, all five schools are eligible
for the my thical national champ
ionship as determined by the AP
and UPI polls. The only people
who can eliminate these schools
from consideration are the
NCAA enforcement office. And
they only have jurisdiction over
the I PI board of coaches poll at
that.
The value of being ranked
cannot be underestimated. It is
free publicity, it is a stamp ot
quality on a team and it looks
awful good tti those high school
seniors vv ho are the key to a team
getting on top or staying there.
There is a real possibility that
I 'SCcould go undefeated, not go
to the Rose Bowl, yet still finish

No. I.
That's some punishment.
I'rojan head coach John
Robinson recently was asked il
he felt the sanction doled out tr
his football team was too harsh.
"I don't feel in any way we were
treated unfairlyßobinson said.
"We accepted the mandate of
our conference. We have alwavs
used the Rose Bowl as our goal
and now that goal has been de
nied. Still, we have 1 I football
games to play, and that certainly
is exciting."
As is the possibility of coming
out on top without having to
prove it against whatever patsv
the Big 10 sends out to Pasadena
on Jan. 1.
All of the Pac-10 games count
in the conference standings, ev en
it both teams are ineligible for
the league title. This means there
will be no letting up b> those
schools who can't go to the Rose
Bowl. After all. when you can't
be the giant, being the giant kil
ler is the next best thing.
Then again, there is the more
ominous possibility, the possibil
ity that is keeping the Rose Bowl
committee awake at night and
rooting for Washington. Stan
ford and Cal.
Suppose the five eligible
schools finish behind those
schools who are on probation. A

sixth place Pac-10 school could
represent the conference in
Pasadena against the best from
the Big-10.
Knowing the Big-10, the game
would still he a tossup.
I or football purists, there is a
positive aspect to the sanctions.
I here are those fans who hate to
see teams put on probation be
cause it cheapens the outcome of
the game.

VVill the Cards play in Pasadena (his year? Due to disqualification of
five Pac-10 teams from post-season play, optimism runs high for a
Rose Bowl bid. With major rivals USCand UCLA out of the picture,
the Big Came against Berkeley could be the key game in the Cards
post-season hid.
August 1 1 is not a day that
Rose Bowl officials care to re
member. After all. what it you
were giving a party and half the
guests were grounded?
Though only one Pacific-10
Conference school actually
makes the trip to Pasadena on
New Year's Da>. the elimination
of five league schools from the
running was not a pretty sight to
Rose Bowl officials. One of
those schools. USC. has been to
Pasadena more in the last two
decades than any dozen little old
ladies.
Nor was NBC-TV o\erjoved.
It seems the Rose Bowl network
can sell more beer and razor
blades when the Trojans play,
rather than one of the other
Pac-1 0 schools, like Washington
or Stanford.
Nevertheless, the league pres
idents and chancellors have pur
ported to punish L'SC. UCLA,
Oregon. Oregon State and
Arizona State by barring the
schools from any postseason
competition.
The two I.os Angeles schools
as well as Oregon State were
sidelined by transcript ir
regularities. Arizona State was
hit with these too. as well as re
ports of a slush fund.

Oregon, however, was hit the
hardest, both by the Pac-10 and
the NCAA. Several players who
received free airplane tickets
were sidelined, one for one game
and the others for a year by the
NCAA. The Pac-10 also took
awav three scholarships from the
Ducks.
Ouarterhack Reggie Ogburn.
who ran through the Stanford
defense last year like it was a
freeway, was the player sidelined
for one game. That one game
was Sept. 6 against the Cards,
and Stanford won 35-25. You
can only imagine what the Duck
offense would ha\ e been like had
Ogburn been there.
Now let's go over this business
of "getting tough."
1 irst of all. barring Oregon
State from postseason competi
tion is like barring Harold Stas
sen from running for president.
Why go to the trouble?
The four other schools did
have a legitimate shot at making,
it not the Rose Bowl, one of the
others that have sprouted lately
like so many weeds in college
football's garden.
On the surface, therefore, the
Pac-10 hierarchy has deprived
itself of hundreds of thousands ot
dollars in revenue. But take a
look at what they did not take
away.

I iist of all. there are I \ ap
pearances. Chough there is a lot
of money to be made from the
bowls, they are a one-shot deal.
NCAA rules state that teams
may be televised on ABC- I'Y's
Saturday meccas as many as five
times in two years.
That is also millions of dollars
which the Pac-10 will be receiv
ing. It the conference presidents
wanted to show that tin-* be
havior will not be tolerated, they
should have hit themselves in
their collective pocketbooks and
barred those schools from I \
appearances.
Though they cannot go to a
bowl, all five schools are eligible
for the my thical national champ
ionship as determined by the AP
