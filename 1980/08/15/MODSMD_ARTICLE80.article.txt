# IM's provide sporting fun

So, you were all-league in high
school, but can't make the var
sity at Stanford. That leaves you
two options: a) nerd out 1 6 hours
a day, eating and sleeping away
the rest of the time, or b) partici
pate in the numerous non-varsity
athletic and recreational ac
tivities pursued on campus.
Varsity sports are but a small
part of the athletic world at Stan
ford.-intramural and club sports,
physical education classes and
recreational facilities all await
the athletic Stanford student.
The intramural progam,
headed by former Stanford bas
ketball coach Howie Dallmar,
offers 33 All-University sports,
21 all-women sports. The Ac
tivities change quarterly, with
sports ranging from such stan
dards as football, basketball, and
Softball, to such novelties as ul
timate frisbee, foosball, and
inner tube water polo.
A complete list of autumn
sports, as well as scheduling and
sign-up information, will appear
in the Daily. The intramural of
fice, located in Encina Gym, will
answer any questions about the
program.
Club sports provide intercol
legiate competition in several
sports which do not have varsity
status at Stanford. The list of
club sports includes rugby, bad
minton, bowling, skiing and ice
hockey. The athletic department
will provide further information
about the program.
Physical education classes are
extremely popular at Stanford,
and consequently, one cannot
always get the classes desired.
Hundreds of courses, for all
levels of ability, are offered in
sports, dancing, and aquatic ac
tivities, as well as instructional
classes in athletic theories and
techniques. Classes are held
teaching the nuances of tennis,
golf, basketball, soccer and
swimming, for example. A com
plete list of courses, times, and
meeting places will appear in the
Autumn Quarter Time
Schedule, and sign-ups are held
at registration in Maples Pavil
ion.
Those athletes interested in
less structured activities can start
their own games at the numerous
on-campus recreational facilities
open to students.
The deGuerre Pools will be
available Monday through Fri
day from noon to 2 p.m. and
from noon to 4 p.m. on
weekends, except for Saturdays
of home, football games, when
they will glose. Roble Pool will
be open noon to 4:45 p.m. on
Tuesday and Thursday, and
noon to 1 and 3:15 to 4:15 p.m.
on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday. Student I.D.'s will be
checked at both pools.

(Listed open hours for all
facilities are subject to change
because of special events, class
changes and intramural schedul
ing. Check individual facilities
for possible time changes.)
The handball and squash
courts at the deGuerre complex
will be open 1 1 a.m. through 11
p.m. on weekdays, 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. on Saturday, and noon to 5
p.m. Sunday. Stanford I.D. is re
quired, and the courts get
crowded so make reservations a
day in advance either by phone
or at the facility.
Maples Pavilion will have re
creational basketball Monday
through Friday from noon to 1
p.m. while Roble Gym will be
open for basketball Saturday af
ternoons from 1 to 5 and Sun
days from 3 to 5. Identification is
required at Maples, but not at
Roble. Outdoor basketball en
thusiasts can often find a good
game at the courts located bet
ween Wilbur and Stern Halls.
The weight room at Encina
Gym will be open Monday
through Thursday from noon to
2 and 3 to 6, Fridays from 4 to 6
p.m. and Saturdays from 10 to
noon. The weight room will be
closed Sundays. Students must
show I.D. to use the facility.
Tennis players can choose
from three sites on campus. The
Roble, Encina and Varsity
courts all have sign-up sheets
posted weekday mornings and
on Friday mornings for the
weekends, but P.E. classes limit
available court space. Netters
who would rather play at night
must venture to Palo Alto High
School or Rinconada Park on
Embarcadero Road, since none
of the campus courts have lights.
Students who prefer spikes to
overheads can play volleyball at
Encina Monday through Thurs
day from noon to 1 p.m. and Fri
day through Sunday 1 p.m. until
dark. There are also several
courts located near the dor
mitories throughout the campus.
Golfers can delight in the chal
lenging layout and bargain deals

offered at Stanford's course.
Golf Digest has rated the course
one of the 100 best in the coun
try. while green fees for students
are a paltry $3.75. In addition,
students can purchase a card
good for 10 rounds for $16.50.
The pro shop will answer ques
tions about the best times to get
on the course. The driving range,
located next to the golf course, is
also available to students.
Jogging has probably become
the most popular sporting activ
ity at Stanford in recent years.
For those who enjoy running on a
track, Angell Field is always av
ailable, and the tartan track at
the football stadium is open oc
casionally. For those who prefer
a scenic run, myriad trails in the
foothills provide some tremend
ous views of the Bay Area.

For those who enjoy simply
romping around in the grass with
a football or frisbee. many fields
on campus await your feet. Wil
bur, Roble and Florence Moore
Halls all have accomodating
fields nearby, and the intramural
fields near Stanford Stadium are
available whenever 1M games
aren't being played.
Students who feel like shower
ing when they are through work
ing out can use the facilities at
Roble or Encina. Roble stays
open Monday through Thursday
until 1 0 p.m., Friday until 7 p.m.
and weekends until 5 p.m. En
cina closes at 9 p.m. during the
week and at 5 p.m. on Saturday
and Sunday. Students can obtain
a locker at both places, and the
University runs a towel service at
Encina.
