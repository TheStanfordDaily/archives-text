# Wiggin’s leadership, Nelson’s return, Pac-10 shake-down raise football hopes
## Season might be 'coming up roses' for Cards 
### Chris Haft Staff Writer 
In some ways, nothing has
changed for Stanford's football
team. Both Paul Wiggin, a two
time All-America defensive
tackle, and Darrin Nelson, the
man who combines excitement
and excellence like nobody else
on a football field, again roam
Stanford Stadium. Once more an
impeccably strong-armed quar
terback leads the offense, and
once more the team's defense
provokes more questions than an
Agatha Christie novel.
Yet everything has changed
for the Cardinals. Wiggin no
longer crouches in a three-point
stance, but instead stalks the
sidelines as Stanford's head
coach — a coach who has re
freshed the team's spirits after
last year's disappointing 5-5-1
performance.
Nelson returns, after missing
the entire 1979 season with an
injury, to give Stanford's
already-effective offense more
power than a Russian Army
stockade and more variety than
the Ed Sullivan Show. John El
way, the strong-armed quarter
back. is a sophomore beginning a
promising three-year reign, un
like his two predecessors, who
were each seniors enjoying only
one brief season in the spotlight.
Even the defense, which usually
provides a semi-interesting di
version for fans while the offense
rests, shows signs of revitaliza
tion under the nourishment ol
Wiggin and new defensive coor
dinator Jack Harbaugh.
Wiggin's presence, not the
disqualification of li\ e Pacific-10
Conference schools from post
season play this season, will have
the most direct positive effect on
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
Though the crew-cut 45-
year-old is coaching college
football for the first time after 23
years in the professional ranks as
a player and coach. Wiggin feels
comfortable with the Cards —
and the Cards feel comfortable
with him.
"I really enjoy these people,"
Wiggin says of his players.
"They're bright. When you put
in (a play), you know they've got
it. If they don't, they ask ques
tions."
The team's attitude last year
under head coach Rod
Dowhower was quietly but defi
nitely uneasy. Not many players
mourned when Dowhower res
igned in January to become the
Denver Broncos' offensive
coordinator.
Wiggin's relationship with his
players, however, apparently in
corporates a genuine, mutual
admiration.
"He's a fun guy to be around."
says flanker Ken Margerum of
Wiggin. "For example, you re

ally don't want to be late lor bed
check — you don't want to bum
the guy out because he's such a
nice guy."
Coaching at Stanford repre
sents a homecoming for Wiggin,
a right tackle tor the Cards from
1954 to 1956 and an All-
America selection his last two
seasons.
"When I was a player here, I
had a great deal of respect for
Chuck Taylor (then head coach),
and 1 loved this university,"
Wiggin affirmed. "In terms ot
college football, Stanford is all I
know."
One more fact Wiggin and
other Stanford partisans know is
that the Cards will certainly be
strengthened by Nelson's return
to the backfield.
Ihe 5-foot-9, 17 7-1 b. halfback
is the only player in the I 10-year
history of college football to rush
tor 1000 yards and catch 50 pas
ses in the same season. What's
more. Nelson did it twice —
1 069 yards and 50 receptions as
a freshman in 1977, 1061 yards
and 50 catches as a sophomore
the next year.
On March 31, 1979. Nelson
ruptured the biceps tendon of his
left leg while long jumping in a
track and field meet at UCLA.
Aftertrying to practice for a little
more than a week in the fall. Nel
son decided that his leg wasn't
strong enough to withstand the
rigors of a full campaign and sat
out last season.
Vincent White and Mike Dot
terer. Nelson's 1979 replace
ments at halfback, did a credita
ble job — White gained 475
yards, and Dotterer scored eight
touchdowns, breaking Nelson's
freshman record of six. Neither
of them, though, represented the
dancing, multiple threat to op
posing defenses that Nelson did.
But the mercurial Nelson has
evidently regained his talents, as
evidenced by the 4.1-second
40-yard dash he reportedly ran
on Stanford Stadium's track the
day before fall practice began.

"I detinitely don't go around
running over people," Nelson
says. "But I am stronger I
weigh 12 pounds more — and
two steps faster (Nelson clocked
a 10.35 in the 100 meters this
past spring, down from 10.55)."
Margerum welcomes Nelson's
return — and well he should, lor
the attention Nelson attracts
from the defense will leave
Margerum more available for
passes.
"I'm sure it'll be a lot better
now (with Darrin back). The
linebackers won't be able to fly
out of there and cover the
downficld throws because they'll
have to worry about Darrin's 50
catches this year," Margerum
states.
Whether Nelson or Margerum
is the target, opposing defenses
will be risking laser burns this
year while trying to stop Elway's
passing. The 6-4, 202-lb.
signal-caller, the most highly
sought-after high school football
player in 1979, throws with al
most unparalleled velocity and
beauty.
Elway's considerable talents
were never more evident than on
Oct. 6, 1979. In a remarkable
display of passing not likely to be
soon forgotten by the 70,205 in
attendance at Stanford Stadium.
Elway completed 16 of 23 tosses
tor 178 yards and a touchdown
while leading the Cards to a
27-24 triumph over UCL.A.
Elway electrified the huge crowd
and mesmerized UCL.A in the
second quarter by moving Stan
ford 59 yards in eight plays with a
no-huddle offense before the
Bruins roused themselves to call
time out.
Elway split time almost evenly
with starter Turk Schonert early
in the season before the fifth
year senior righted himself to
claim the 1979 NCAA passing
championship. Meanwhile,
Elway finished the year with 50
completions in 96 attempts for
544 yards, six touchdowns and a
lot of respect.

Indeed, Elway's leadership
qualities well-compliment Ins
immense natural talent.
"He gained a hell ot a lot ol
respect last year. Margerum af
firms. "When he stepped into the
UCLA game he wasn't nervous
at all. He's tremendously mature
for his age and for his year."
"When he gets in the huddle,
you want to be there with him
and that's a great quarterback,"
praises Wiggin.
Ol the men who are lucky
enough to join Elway in the hud
dle, Margerum and split-end
Andre I yler rank as the quarter
back's top two targets.
Margerum, who drops a pass
about as often as 11 all e \ s ( oniet
appears, caught 41 passes lor
733 yards and 10 touchdowns
last year to become consensus
All-America — the Inst junior to
do so since Bill McColi in 1950.

honors, one might expect Tyler

snatching 45 passes for 652 yards
and five touchdowns.
Though a senior, Tyler has two

seasons ol athletic eligibility re
maining. "The scouts were sick
when they found out he had
another year." Wiggin chortles.
Sophomores Rob Moore and
(ireg Hooper should share most
ol the action at fullback. Hooper
started the last live games there
in 1979, while Moore missed
most ol the season with a neck
injury.
Seniors Brian Holloway, Mike
Neill and John Macauley form an
experienced, competent nucleus
in the offensive line. By contrast,
at least in terms of experience,
right guard C hris Rose was con
verted there from tight end, and
right tackle Jim Dykstra played
only 13 minutes as a junior last
year after seeing no action his
lirst two seasons. Chris Dressel
should start at tight end, with
impressive freshman Jim Clymer
also receiving playing time.
Playing time is something the
Cards tried to prevent their de
fense from having last year.
Though Stanford's defenders en
joyed several bright moments in
1979 — most notably shutting
out USC in the second half of a
21-21 tie — they slumped more
often than they stiffened, allow
ing nearly 22 points per game.
Wiggin. who became a defen
sive scholar through 1 1 years as a
star defensive end with the
Cleveland Browns and 12 years
as an Ni l coach, is counted on

to work his wizardry.
Helping Wiggin considerably
is Harbaugh. defensive backtield
coach at Michigan from 1973 to
1979. His Wolverine teams
gained a national reputation lor
staunch defense.
At Stanford, Harbaugh has al
ready gained a reputation for er
ratic behavior: screaming, ges
ticulating wildly, wearing his cap
sideways.
"You know those cameras on
top of the practice field towers'.'
Wiggin asks a group of reporters.
"Only one of them is actually a
camera. The other one is a tran
quilizer gun we keep pointed at
Harbaugh."

As for his players, Wiggin fo
cuses his attention on what he
calls the "inside triangle" of
Stanford's 3-4 defense — the
nose guard and the two inside
linebackers.
"In a three-man front, the in
side people are so critical. Wig
gin savs. "It a center can block
your nose guard all by himself,

As far as Cardinal 112 ootball fans are concerned, 31 is a more important
number than that on the winning Irish Sweepstakes ticket. Darrin
Nelson, back after he red-shirted last year because of an injury, will
be wearing jersey 31 as he heads for yardage, touchdowns, and
perhaps even a trip to Pasadena on January 1.

As far as Cardinal 112 ootball fans are concerned, 31 is a more important
number than that on the winning Irish Sweepstakes ticket. Darrin
Nelson, back after he red-shirted last year because of an injury, will
be wearing jersey 31 as he heads for yardage, touchdowns, and
perhaps even a trip to Pasadena on January 1.
In some ways, nothing has
changed for Stanford's football
team. Both Paul Wiggin, a two
time All-America defensive
tackle, and Darrin Nelson, the
man who combines excitement
and excellence like nobody else
on a football field, again roam
Stanford Stadium. Once more an
impeccably strong-armed quar
terback leads the offense, and
once more the team's defense
provokes more questions than an
Agatha Christie novel.
Yet everything has changed
for the Cardinals. Wiggin no
longer crouches in a three-point
stance, but instead stalks the
sidelines as Stanford's head
coach — a coach who has re
freshed the team's spirits after
last year's disappointing 5-5-1
performance.
Nelson returns, after missing
the entire 1979 season with an
injury, to give Stanford's
already-effective offense more
power than a Russian Army
stockade and more variety than
the Ed Sullivan Show. John El
way, the strong-armed quarter
back. is a sophomore beginning a
promising three-year reign, un
like his two predecessors, who
were each seniors enjoying only
one brief season in the spotlight.
Even the defense, which usually
provides a semi-interesting di
version for fans while the offense
rests, shows signs of revitaliza
tion under the nourishment ol
Wiggin and new defensive coor
dinator Jack Harbaugh.
Wiggin's presence, not the
disqualification of li\ e Pacific-10
Conference schools from post
season play this season, will have
the most direct positive effect on
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
Though the crew-cut 45-
year-old is coaching college
football for the first time after 23
years in the professional ranks as
a player and coach. Wiggin feels
comfortable with the Cards —
and the Cards feel comfortable
with him.
"I really enjoy these people,"
Wiggin says of his players.
"They're bright. When you put
in (a play), you know they've got
it. If they don't, they ask ques
tions."
The team's attitude last year
under head coach Rod
Dowhower was quietly but defi
nitely uneasy. Not many players
mourned when Dowhower res
igned in January to become the
Denver Broncos' offensive
coordinator.
Wiggin's relationship with his
players, however, apparently in
corporates a genuine, mutual
admiration.
"He's a fun guy to be around."
says flanker Ken Margerum of
Wiggin. "For example, you re

ally don't want to be late lor bed
check — you don't want to bum
the guy out because he's such a
nice guy."
Coaching at Stanford repre
sents a homecoming for Wiggin,
a right tackle tor the Cards from
1954 to 1956 and an All-
America selection his last two
seasons.
"When I was a player here, I
had a great deal of respect for
Chuck Taylor (then head coach),
and 1 loved this university,"
Wiggin affirmed. "In terms ot
college football, Stanford is all I
know."
One more fact Wiggin and
other Stanford partisans know is
that the Cards will certainly be
strengthened by Nelson's return
to the backfield.
Ihe 5-foot-9, 17 7-1 b. halfback
is the only player in the I 10-year
history of college football to rush
tor 1000 yards and catch 50 pas
ses in the same season. What's
more. Nelson did it twice —
1 069 yards and 50 receptions as
a freshman in 1977, 1061 yards
and 50 catches as a sophomore
the next year.
On March 31, 1979. Nelson
ruptured the biceps tendon of his
left leg while long jumping in a
track and field meet at UCLA.
Aftertrying to practice for a little
more than a week in the fall. Nel
son decided that his leg wasn't
strong enough to withstand the
rigors of a full campaign and sat
out last season.
Vincent White and Mike Dot
terer. Nelson's 1979 replace
ments at halfback, did a credita
ble job — White gained 475
yards, and Dotterer scored eight
touchdowns, breaking Nelson's
freshman record of six. Neither
of them, though, represented the
dancing, multiple threat to op
posing defenses that Nelson did.
But the mercurial Nelson has
evidently regained his talents, as
evidenced by the 4.1-second
40-yard dash he reportedly ran
on Stanford Stadium's track the
day before fall practice began.

"I detinitely don't go around
running over people," Nelson
says. "But I am stronger I
weigh 12 pounds more — and
two steps faster (Nelson clocked
a 10.35 in the 100 meters this
past spring, down from 10.55)."
Margerum welcomes Nelson's
return — and well he should, lor
the attention Nelson attracts
from the defense will leave
Margerum more available for
passes.
"I'm sure it'll be a lot better
now (with Darrin back). The
linebackers won't be able to fly
out of there and cover the
downficld throws because they'll
have to worry about Darrin's 50
catches this year," Margerum
states.
Whether Nelson or Margerum
is the target, opposing defenses
will be risking laser burns this
year while trying to stop Elway's
passing. The 6-4, 202-lb.
signal-caller, the most highly
sought-after high school football
player in 1979, throws with al
most unparalleled velocity and
beauty.
Elway's considerable talents
were never more evident than on
Oct. 6, 1979. In a remarkable
display of passing not likely to be
soon forgotten by the 70,205 in
attendance at Stanford Stadium.
Elway completed 16 of 23 tosses
tor 178 yards and a touchdown
while leading the Cards to a
27-24 triumph over UCL.A.
Elway electrified the huge crowd
and mesmerized UCL.A in the
second quarter by moving Stan
ford 59 yards in eight plays with a
no-huddle offense before the
Bruins roused themselves to call
time out.
Elway split time almost evenly
with starter Turk Schonert early
in the season before the fifth
year senior righted himself to
claim the 1979 NCAA passing
championship. Meanwhile,
Elway finished the year with 50
completions in 96 attempts for
544 yards, six touchdowns and a
lot of respect.

Indeed, Elway's leadership
qualities well-compliment Ins
immense natural talent.
"He gained a hell ot a lot ol
respect last year. Margerum af
firms. "When he stepped into the
UCLA game he wasn't nervous
at all. He's tremendously mature
for his age and for his year."
"When he gets in the huddle,
you want to be there with him
and that's a great quarterback,"
praises Wiggin.
Ol the men who are lucky
enough to join Elway in the hud
dle, Margerum and split-end
Andre I yler rank as the quarter
back's top two targets.
Margerum, who drops a pass
about as often as 11 all e \ s ( oniet
appears, caught 41 passes lor
733 yards and 10 touchdowns
last year to become consensus
All-America — the Inst junior to
do so since Bill McColi in 1950.

As far as Cardinal 112 ootball fans are concerned, 31 is a more important
number than that on the winning Irish Sweepstakes ticket. Darrin
Nelson, back after he red-shirted last year because of an injury, will
be wearing jersey 31 as he heads for yardage, touchdowns, and
perhaps even a trip to Pasadena on January 1.
In some ways, nothing has
changed for Stanford's football
team. Both Paul Wiggin, a two
time All-America defensive
tackle, and Darrin Nelson, the
man who combines excitement
and excellence like nobody else
on a football field, again roam
Stanford Stadium. Once more an
impeccably strong-armed quar
terback leads the offense, and
once more the team's defense
provokes more questions than an
Agatha Christie novel.
Yet everything has changed
for the Cardinals. Wiggin no
longer crouches in a three-point
stance, but instead stalks the
sidelines as Stanford's head
coach — a coach who has re
freshed the team's spirits after
last year's disappointing 5-5-1
performance.
Nelson returns, after missing
the entire 1979 season with an
injury, to give Stanford's
already-effective offense more
power than a Russian Army
stockade and more variety than
the Ed Sullivan Show. John El
way, the strong-armed quarter
back. is a sophomore beginning a
promising three-year reign, un
like his two predecessors, who
were each seniors enjoying only
one brief season in the spotlight.
Even the defense, which usually
provides a semi-interesting di
version for fans while the offense
rests, shows signs of revitaliza
tion under the nourishment ol
Wiggin and new defensive coor
dinator Jack Harbaugh.
Wiggin's presence, not the
disqualification of li\ e Pacific-10
Conference schools from post
season play this season, will have
the most direct positive effect on
Stanford's Rose Bowl chances.
Though the crew-cut 45-
year-old is coaching college
football for the first time after 23
years in the professional ranks as
a player and coach. Wiggin feels
comfortable with the Cards —
and the Cards feel comfortable
with him.
"I really enjoy these people,"
Wiggin says of his players.
"They're bright. When you put
in (a play), you know they've got
it. If they don't, they ask ques
tions."
The team's attitude last year
under head coach Rod
Dowhower was quietly but defi
nitely uneasy. Not many players
mourned when Dowhower res
igned in January to become the
Denver Broncos' offensive
coordinator.
Wiggin's relationship with his
players, however, apparently in
corporates a genuine, mutual
admiration.
"He's a fun guy to be around."
says flanker Ken Margerum of
Wiggin. "For example, you re

ally don't want to be late lor bed
check — you don't want to bum
the guy out because he's such a
nice guy."
Coaching at Stanford repre
sents a homecoming for Wiggin,
a right tackle tor the Cards from
1954 to 1956 and an All-
America selection his last two
seasons.
"When I was a player here, I
had a great deal of respect for
Chuck Taylor (then head coach),
and 1 loved this university,"
Wiggin affirmed. "In terms ot
college football, Stanford is all I
know."
One more fact Wiggin and
other Stanford partisans know is
that the Cards will certainly be
strengthened by Nelson's return
to the backfield.
Ihe 5-foot-9, 17 7-1 b. halfback
is the only player in the I 10-year
history of college football to rush
tor 1000 yards and catch 50 pas
ses in the same season. What's
more. Nelson did it twice —
1 069 yards and 50 receptions as
a freshman in 1977, 1061 yards
and 50 catches as a sophomore
the next year.
On March 31, 1979. Nelson
ruptured the biceps tendon of his
left leg while long jumping in a
track and field meet at UCLA.
Aftertrying to practice for a little
more than a week in the fall. Nel
son decided that his leg wasn't
strong enough to withstand the
rigors of a full campaign and sat
out last season.
Vincent White and Mike Dot
terer. Nelson's 1979 replace
ments at halfback, did a credita
ble job — White gained 475
yards, and Dotterer scored eight
touchdowns, breaking Nelson's
freshman record of six. Neither
of them, though, represented the
dancing, multiple threat to op
posing defenses that Nelson did.
But the mercurial Nelson has
evidently regained his talents, as
evidenced by the 4.1-second
40-yard dash he reportedly ran
on Stanford Stadium's track the
day before fall practice began.

"I detinitely don't go around
running over people," Nelson
says. "But I am stronger I
weigh 12 pounds more — and
two steps faster (Nelson clocked
a 10.35 in the 100 meters this
past spring, down from 10.55)."
Margerum welcomes Nelson's
return — and well he should, lor
the attention Nelson attracts
from the defense will leave
Margerum more available for
passes.
"I'm sure it'll be a lot better
now (with Darrin back). The
linebackers won't be able to fly
out of there and cover the
downficld throws because they'll
have to worry about Darrin's 50
catches this year," Margerum
states.
Whether Nelson or Margerum
is the target, opposing defenses
will be risking laser burns this
year while trying to stop Elway's
passing. The 6-4, 202-lb.
signal-caller, the most highly
sought-after high school football
player in 1979, throws with al
most unparalleled velocity and
beauty.
Elway's considerable talents
were never more evident than on
Oct. 6, 1979. In a remarkable

history of college football to rush
tor 1000 yards and catch 50 pas
ses in the same season. What's
more. Nelson did it twice —
1 069 yards and 50 receptions as
a freshman in 1977, 1061 yards
and 50 catches as a sophomore
the next year.
On March 31, 1979. Nelson
ruptured the biceps tendon of his
left leg while long jumping in a
track and field meet at UCLA.
Aftertrying to practice for a little
more than a week in the fall. Nel
son decided that his leg wasn't
strong enough to withstand the
rigors of a full campaign and sat
out last season.
Vincent White and Mike Dot
terer. Nelson's 1979 replace
ments at halfback, did a credita
ble job — White gained 475
yards, and Dotterer scored eight
touchdowns, breaking Nelson's
freshman record of six. Neither
of them, though, represented the
dancing, multiple threat to op
posing defenses that Nelson did.
But the mercurial Nelson has
evidently regained his talents, as
evidenced by the 4.1-second
40-yard dash he reportedly ran
on Stanford Stadium's track the
day before fall practice began.

"I detinitely don't go around
running over people," Nelson
says. "But I am stronger I
weigh 12 pounds more — and
two steps faster (Nelson clocked
a 10.35 in the 100 meters this
past spring, down from 10.55)."
Margerum welcomes Nelson's
return — and well he should, lor
the attention Nelson attracts
from the defense will leave
Margerum more available for
passes.
"I'm sure it'll be a lot better
now (with Darrin back). The
linebackers won't be able to fly
out of there and cover the
downficld throws because they'll
have to worry about Darrin's 50
catches this year," Margerum
states.
Whether Nelson or Margerum
is the target, opposing defenses
will be risking laser burns this
year while trying to stop Elway's
passing. The 6-4, 202-lb.
signal-caller, the most highly
sought-after high school football
player in 1979, throws with al
most unparalleled velocity and
beauty.
Elway's considerable talents
were never more evident than on
Oct. 6, 1979. In a remarkable
display of passing not likely to be
soon forgotten by the 70,205 in
attendance at Stanford Stadium.
Elway completed 16 of 23 tosses
tor 178 yards and a touchdown
while leading the Cards to a
27-24 triumph over UCL.A.
Elway electrified the huge crowd
and mesmerized UCL.A in the
second quarter by moving Stan
ford 59 yards in eight plays with a
no-huddle offense before the
Bruins roused themselves to call
time out.
Elway split time almost evenly
with starter Turk Schonert early
in the season before the fifth
year senior righted himself to
claim the 1979 NCAA passing
championship. Meanwhile,
Elway finished the year with 50
completions in 96 attempts for
544 yards, six touchdowns and a
lot of respect.

Indeed, Elway's leadership
qualities well-compliment Ins
immense natural talent.
"He gained a hell ot a lot ol
respect last year. Margerum af
firms. "When he stepped into the
UCLA game he wasn't nervous
at all. He's tremendously mature
for his age and for his year."
"When he gets in the huddle,
you want to be there with him
and that's a great quarterback,"
praises Wiggin.
Ol the men who are lucky
enough to join Elway in the hud
dle, Margerum and split-end
Andre I yler rank as the quarter
back's top two targets.
Margerum, who drops a pass
about as often as 11 all e \ s ( oniet
appears, caught 41 passes lor
733 yards and 10 touchdowns
last year to become consensus
All-America — the Inst junior to
do so since Bill McColi in 1950.
Ihe 6-1, 175-lb. speedster was
named first team by UPI, AP,
Eastman-Kodak, The Sporting
News, Football News, the News
paper Enterprise Association
and the Walter Camp Founda
tion.
In the face of Margerum's
honors, one might expect Tyler
to be the Cards' Rodney Danger
field. Instead, he proved to be
Really Dangerous in 1979.
snatching 45 passes for 652 yards
and five touchdowns.
Though a senior, Tyler has two

seasons ol athletic eligibility re
maining. "The scouts were sick
when they found out he had
another year." Wiggin chortles.
Sophomores Rob Moore and
(ireg Hooper should share most
ol the action at fullback. Hooper
started the last live games there
in 1979, while Moore missed
most ol the season with a neck
injury.
Seniors Brian Holloway, Mike
Neill and John Macauley form an
experienced, competent nucleus
in the offensive line. By contrast,
at least in terms of experience,
right guard C hris Rose was con
verted there from tight end, and
right tackle Jim Dykstra played
only 13 minutes as a junior last
year after seeing no action his
lirst two seasons. Chris Dressel
should start at tight end, with
impressive freshman Jim Clymer
also receiving playing time.
Playing time is something the
Cards tried to prevent their de
fense from having last year.
Though Stanford's defenders en
joyed several bright moments in
1979 — most notably shutting
out USC in the second half of a
21-21 tie — they slumped more
often than they stiffened, allow
ing nearly 22 points per game.
Wiggin. who became a defen
sive scholar through 1 1 years as a
star defensive end with the
Cleveland Browns and 12 years
as an Ni l coach, is counted on

to work his wizardry.
Helping Wiggin considerably
is Harbaugh. defensive backtield
coach at Michigan from 1973 to
1979. His Wolverine teams
gained a national reputation lor
staunch defense.
At Stanford, Harbaugh has al
ready gained a reputation for er
ratic behavior: screaming, ges
ticulating wildly, wearing his cap
sideways.
"You know those cameras on
top of the practice field towers'.'
Wiggin asks a group of reporters.
"Only one of them is actually a
camera. The other one is a tran
quilizer gun we keep pointed at
Harbaugh."

As for his players, Wiggin fo
cuses his attention on what he
calls the "inside triangle" of
Stanford's 3-4 defense — the
nose guard and the two inside
linebackers.
"In a three-man front, the in
side people are so critical. Wig
gin savs. "It a center can block
your nose guard all by himself,
then vou don't have a defense

As far as Cardinal 112 ootball fans are concerned, 31 is a more important
number than that on the winning Irish Sweepstakes ticket. Darrin
Nelson, back after he red-shirted last year because of an injury, will
be wearing jersey 31 as he heads for yardage, touchdowns, and
perhaps even a trip to Pasadena on January 1.
