It' you feel that academic
achie\omcnt is the soul purpose
of your stay here at Stanford. or
that a life ol sincerity, solemnity
and sobriety is the basis ot your
existence, it is recommended
that you discontinue readme tins
article immediately I'hrow it
awa\ or burn it or tear it up into

tiny little pieces and say a short
prayer for our collective soul. If.
on the other hand, you feel that
authority should be questioned,
it you believe that education
exists outside the narrow sphere
of pure academia. it you lose to
have fun. laugh hysterically and
do things you'll ne\er he able to
te'' vout mothet about, we invite
voi: to read on and enjov.

This is the Orientation Issue of
the Stanford Daily. It will orient
you. By now, you have probably
met your R.A. Fins person will
orient you. Tours of the campus,
tours of the libraries, house
meetings. Resident Fellows,
upper classmen and Donald
Kennedy will orient you.
We will disorient vou.

We can undo the damage the
others have done. We can show
you the true value of a Higher
Education. We are the I.eland
Stanford Junior (pause) Univer
sity Marching Band.
A Brief History :
Boxer shorts, as we call them
today, have a long and baggy, if
not colorful, history . . .cavemen
w rapped the fur of local wildlife
around themselves as a means ot
keeping the temperature sensi
tise areas of the body warm. As
man became more and more
technologically advanced, he de
veloped more sophisticated and
stylistic clothing, but the under
garment remained basically the
same, acting as an additional
temperature insulation, as well
as protecting the external fabrics
from the effects of natural bodily
secretions, such as sweat.
Somewhere along the line, a

cultural taboo developed around
undergarments, and they were
considered unworthy of public
display.
This was true up until the early
l l >7(>«, when a cousin of the brief
family, known as "surfer's jams"
were displayed on national tele
\ ision b> about a hundred mem
bers of the Stanford University
Marching Band.
Ah. but the perpetrators of
this revolutionary action were
not alwa> s so apt to set such pre
cedents. Up until 1963, they
looked ama/ingly like the
'Weenies across the Bay." How
ever, it was ordained by the
Great Bird of the Galaxy that
such a unique University must
ha\e a unique Band.
And so, from the loins of the
students' creativity spranu a
beast called the LSJUMB. The
LSJUMB is a large beast which

roams the countryside and takes
to the airways, spreading
mayhem and mischief through
all that it touches. This danger
ous, but loveable creature re
sides in a run down pistol range
in an obscure corner of the Ice
land Stanford Junior Country
Club.
The LSJUMB is mostly noc
turnal, and there is a good
chance that you may find it on
your doorstep, very late at night,
bellowing for liquid refreshment.
(More on its diet later.) It often
makes a very similar bellowing
sound while in its lair, and, for
short periods of time on Satur
day afternoons, in football
stadiums (the only daytime ven
ture it makes with any kind of
regularity).
It is also capable of other cries,
under certain circumstances, like
the one often heard in interna
tional airports, which sounds
much like the human words,
"paging Edward Martin Bo,"
and the one heard on rented
buses, which sounds more like
"more beer, less Pether."
The diet of the LSJUMB is
amazingly simple, but it is obvi
ous that it has extremely diffe
rent nutritional needs than the
average human being. The staple
of the diet appears to be a hops
and barley derived liquid, some
times accompanied with pizza or
doughnuts. There are a few other
dietary suppliments, but they do
not compare with anything we
have on the open market today.
While feeding, it has also been
observed gathering artifacts for
no apparent reason other than to

decorate its lair. This fact has led
some experts to theorize that the
LSJUMB does indeed possess
some degree of artistic taste, or
cultural ethics, hut this is just
speculation at this point, as these
traits are in no way shown in pub
lic.
Ihe only known natural
enemies of this animal are the
Calweenie - annual - orange -
throwers - society, the Arizona
State Athletic Department, and
a horrible tribe of neo-fascist
Red Skirts found in the smoggy
jungles of Southern California.
I here may be other menacing
foes around, but they have (intel
ligently) stayed out of the way of
the animal.
When provoked, it has been
known to hinder presidential
campaigns, downgrade energy
sources and even, when truly an
gry. display a person's innermost
secrets in front of 50,000 scream
ing fans.
So, what is the LSJUMB?
What makes it work? It is a
group of individual parasites in
harmonic symbiosis with each
other, and with a vast array of
brass, brass compounds, and
synthetic brass reproductions. It
(we) will be into many new,
twisted (perverse and reverse)
ideas this year. Exploration be
gins at 12:30 on September 25 at
the Band Shack. We invite you to
get confused.
We hope that you can play (for
Fall that is) Trumpet, F Horn,
Drums, Sax, Mellophonium,
Trombone, Tuba, or last and
least. Pic or Clarinet; and that
you are the person for us.
Be seeing vou.

This is the Orientation Issue of
the Stanford Daily. It will orient
you. By now, you have probably
met your R.A. Fins person will
orient you. Tours of the campus,
tours of the libraries, house

upper classmen and Donald
Kennedy will orient you.
We will disorient vou.

We can undo the damage the

A Brief History :
Boxer shorts, as we call them
today, have a long and baggy, if
not colorful, history . . .cavemen
w rapped the fur of local wildlife
around themselves as a means ot
keeping the temperature sensi
tise areas of the body warm. As
man became more and more
technologically advanced, he de
veloped more sophisticated and
stylistic clothing, but the under
garment remained basically the
same, acting as an additional
temperature insulation, as well
as protecting the external fabrics
from the effects of natural bodily
secretions, such as sweat.
Somewhere along the line, a

cultural taboo developed around
undergarments, and they were
considered unworthy of public
display.
This was true up until the early
l l >7(>«, when a cousin of the brief
family, known as "surfer's jams"
were displayed on national tele
\ ision b> about a hundred mem
bers of the Stanford University
Marching Band.
Ah. but the perpetrators of
this revolutionary action were
not alwa> s so apt to set such pre
cedents. Up until 1963, they
looked ama/ingly like the
'Weenies across the Bay." How
ever, it was ordained by the
Great Bird of the Galaxy that
such a unique University must
ha\e a unique Band.
And so, from the loins of the
students' creativity spranu a
beast called the LSJUMB. The
LSJUMB is a large beast which

roams the countryside and takes
to the airways, spreading
mayhem and mischief through
all that it touches. This danger
ous, but loveable creature re
sides in a run down pistol range
in an obscure corner of the Ice
land Stanford Junior Country
Club.
The LSJUMB is mostly noc
turnal, and there is a good
chance that you may find it on
your doorstep, very late at night,
bellowing for liquid refreshment.
(More on its diet later.) It often
makes a very similar bellowing
sound while in its lair, and, for
short periods of time on Satur
day afternoons, in football
stadiums (the only daytime ven
ture it makes with any kind of
regularity).
It is also capable of other cries,
under certain circumstances, like
the one often heard in interna
tional airports, which sounds
much like the human words,
"paging Edward Martin Bo,"
and the one heard on rented
buses, which sounds more like
"more beer, less Pether."
The diet of the LSJUMB is
amazingly simple, but it is obvi
ous that it has extremely diffe
rent nutritional needs than the
average human being. The staple
of the diet appears to be a hops
and barley derived liquid, some
times accompanied with pizza or
doughnuts. There are a few other
dietary suppliments, but they do
not compare with anything we
have on the open market today.
While feeding, it has also been
observed gathering artifacts for
no apparent reason other than to

decorate its lair. This fact has led
some experts to theorize that the
LSJUMB does indeed possess
some degree of artistic taste, or
cultural ethics, hut this is just
speculation at this point, as these
traits are in no way shown in pub
lic.
Ihe only known natural
enemies of this animal are the
Calweenie - annual - orange -
throwers - society, the Arizona
State Athletic Department, and
a horrible tribe of neo-fascist
Red Skirts found in the smoggy
jungles of Southern California.
I here may be other menacing
foes around, but they have (intel
ligently) stayed out of the way of
the animal.
When provoked, it has been
known to hinder presidential
campaigns, downgrade energy
sources and even, when truly an
gry. display a person's innermost
secrets in front of 50,000 scream
ing fans.
So, what is the LSJUMB?
What makes it work? It is a
group of individual parasites in
harmonic symbiosis with each
other, and with a vast array of
brass, brass compounds, and
synthetic brass reproductions. It
(we) will be into many new,
twisted (perverse and reverse)
ideas this year. Exploration be
gins at 12:30 on September 25 at
the Band Shack. We invite you to
get confused.
We hope that you can play (for
Fall that is) Trumpet, F Horn,
Drums, Sax, Mellophonium,
Trombone, Tuba, or last and
least. Pic or Clarinet; and that
you are the person for us.
Be seeing vou.
