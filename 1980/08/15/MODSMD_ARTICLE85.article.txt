SUNDRY
FLICKS

For most, the problem is not so
much finding time for the mov ie,
but finding the best time. The
classicdilemma; whether'tis bet
ter to go to the early show and
finish reading those chapters af
terwards. or to study double
time before the picture and then
blow off the rest of the night. . . .
Financed with student funds.
Memorial Auditorium was orig
inally built as a theater for stu
dent use. and. soon after its com
pletion. the first film series
started on October 31, 1937.
The Flick: All Quiet on the
Western Front. Admission: 15
cents.
The next year, the price was
raised to 20 cents, and seven
films were scheduled through the

winter and spring of 193K-39. It
was during this year that the
series was first called the Sunday
Night Movies.
Today, the Sunday Flicks av
erages I 1 films per quarter, and
in 1979-80 a total of 40 movies
were shown.
According to John Backus,
this year's manager of the ASSU
Sunday Flicks, 2000 students at
tend the two shows on a good
night.
"The hardest part of my job is
picking a schedule that the entire
community will like overall.
Maybe a person won't like a film
or two, but hopefully like the
overall schedule," Backus said.
Backus added that this year,
the Flicks were leaning away
from the "campus classics" like
Clockwork Orange, Catch-22
and Paper Chase, and were
leaning towards "quality,
blockbuster hits."
The Flicks usually pays the
film distributor a percentage or a
guaranteed rate, whichever is
greater, of the show's take. The
guarantee is much lower on the
older "classics." making them a
treat for the Flick's budget, as
well as for old film buffs.
"I'm getting the best films av
ailable on the market at the time
regardless of the cost." Backus
said. "If you have a quality line
up with recent good films, it will
be possible to keep the price
down to a dollar by attracting a
large audience."
Along with the low costs, the
Flicks also offers a group dis
count plan which cuts the cost for

subscribers to 60 cents. This
plan, implemented last Winter,
entitles large groups ot students
to buy a season pass with a group
of friends. You get in first and get
the best seats, said Backus.
This Fall, the line-up will open
Sept. 2<S with North Dalia s Forty.
The fall Sunday line-up will
continue with offerings such as:
Breaking Away, I.e Cage Aux
Folles, The Electric Horseman,
Hair, The Good-bye Carl, Coal
nuners Daughter, Dr. /hi v a go.

Kramer v.v. Kramer, The Inlaws,
"10" and this quarter the inevit
able Woody Allen flick is
Sleeper.
The following two quarters
will offer recent hit movies such
as A m eri can Giggolo,
Apocalypse Now, All That Jazz
and The Shining.
The Flicks is an entrenched
and popular campus tradition,
and, in the immortal words of
Mr. Backus "the Flicks provides
lor healthy campus entertain
ment."


The Coffee House located in Tresidder Union offers students a place to relax and listen to good
live music on man\ nights, or to challenge a friend to a game of chess. Deli.style sandwiches and a
large variety of hot and cold drinks (including beer and wine) are served throughout the day.
