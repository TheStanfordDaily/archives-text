# From symphony to jazz: Bach to rock the music dept. is all-encompassing
## 
### Rick Altman Staff Writer 
For those who find the role of
spectator just a little too inhibit
ing, allow the Stanford Music
Department to write your pre
scription. Just about every con
ceivable form of invented music
is practiced one way or another
under the auspices of the rather
all-encompassing music depart
ment.
Fourteen performing organi
zations perform at least once a
quarter. Marcia Tanner, publi
cist for the department, esti
mates that between 130 and 140
formal concerts are presented
each year.
And in addition to those are
the informal musicals that seem
to appear out of nowhere during
noontime in very strategically lo
cated areas.
Low student admission
"There are a lot of oppor
tunities for hearing good music,"
Tanner understates. "We like to
think of ourselves as a gift to the
community. Many of our con
certs are free and when there is
an admission price, we keep it
very low."
By "low," Tanner means very
low. For the concerts that carry
an admission price, the cost for
students is between one and two
dollars.
"We have everything from
Medieval monody to baroque
polyphony, classical symphonies
and romantic tone poems, to the
farthest out contemporary music
and most nostalgic big band
jazz," Tanner added.
Four series
Four series will be presented
by the department beginning this
Fall.
Series A features the outstand
ing Francesco Trio, returning for
its ninth season. A Brahms
mini-series is scheduled for the
three Fall performances.
During the winter, the Trio
will he joined by such performers
as Marie Gibson, singing Shos
takovich's Romance for soprano

and trio, and vocalist John
Graham. Climaxing the season
will be an all-Beethoven concert
in May.
The Stanford Stars is the
theme of Series B. Many of the
finest musical artists in the Bay
area teach music at Stanford and
will be presented to the commun
ity through this series. Margaret
Fabrizioand Alexandra Hawley;
Charles Ferguson and Marie
Gibson are this year's featured
performers.
Series C begins the choral per-

formances — on November 24,
and 25 with Mozart's Mass in C
Minor and Exsultate Jubilate.
Following this on March 1
Handel's Judas Maccabeua will
be performed and on May 29,
the War Requiem' by Benjamin
Britten will close this series.
The Stanford Orchestras ac
count for the performances in
the final series of the four. The
Chamber orchestra will kick-off
with a performance on
November 5 in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
On November 11, the Sym-

phonv Orchestra will make its
debut of the season.
The two groups come together
for a festive celebration of holi
day music on Sunday December
7, followed by three more per
formances during the remaining
two quarters.
In addition to the perfor
mances offered by these series,
the Music Department has
scheduled a number of other of
ferings.
Heading the calendar is a per-

formance on October 1 by Jill
Mueller on the organ in Memo
rial Church. This will be followed
by music from the Center for
Computer Research on October
7.
The performances continue
non-stop through the year, often
with a varied selection of shows
packed into one week.
Participation
But. the emphasis of the Music
Department program is pointed
more toward participation than
spectating. Of course an audi

ence is always nice, but, as the
department is relatively small in
numbers, it thrives on participa
tion by non-majors. For in
stance, about SO percent of the
symphony is comprised of non
majors.
"Naturally we're looking for
audiences," Tanner said, "but
we also want performers! If you
are a bathroom tenor or a closet
bassionist why not come out of
hiding and join one of our
groups?"

There are 10 performing
groups that will he auditioning
on September 29 and 30. They
are: The Chorale/Chorus/Choir,
the Marching Band/Studio
Band/Wind Ensemble, Sym
phony Orchestra/Chamber Or
chestra, Opera Workshop, Piano
& String Chamber Music. Per
cussion Ensemble, Glee Club,
Early Music Singers, Renais
sance Wind Band, and the En
semble For New Music.
Student Music Association
The Student Music Associa
tion (SMA) serves the under
graduate and graduate commun
ity of music students and per
formers and welcomes
everyone's full participation in
their activities.
The SMA has recently opened
a small student lounge, with cof
fee, music and telephone
facilities, and it plans for this
year a series of informal work
shops, recitals and exchanges
with other Bay area universities
— as well as coffee mornings and
brown bag lunches at the de
partment.
Music Department calendars
can be obtained at Tresidder In
formation Desk or at the ticket
office. There are also listings in
the Daily's Bay Area Entertain
ment guide every Thursday.


Shown here is David Abel, violinist of the illustrious Francesco Trio, Stanford's ensemble-in-residence.
The Trio will present three concerts devoted to the Chamber music of Johannes Brahms this fall.

The SMA has recently opened
a small student lounge, with cof
fee, music and telephone
facilities, and it plans for this
year a series of informal work
shops, recitals and exchanges
with other Bay area universities
— as well as coffee mornings and
brown bag lunches at the de
partment.
Music Department calendars
can be obtained at Tresidder In
formation Desk or at the ticket
office. There are also listings in
the Daily's Bay Area Entertain
ment guide every Thursday.

The Department of Music brings many outstanding musical groups to
campus, including the Juillard Trio and the San Francisco Symphony.
For those who find the role of
spectator just a little too inhibit
ing, allow the Stanford Music
Department to write your pre
scription. Just about every con
ceivable form of invented music
is practiced one way or another
under the auspices of the rather
all-encompassing music depart
ment.
Fourteen performing organi
zations perform at least once a
quarter. Marcia Tanner, publi
cist for the department, esti
mates that between 130 and 140
formal concerts are presented
each year.
And in addition to those are
the informal musicals that seem
to appear out of nowhere during
noontime in very strategically lo
cated areas.
Low student admission
"There are a lot of oppor
tunities for hearing good music,"
Tanner understates. "We like to
think of ourselves as a gift to the
community. Many of our con
certs are free and when there is
an admission price, we keep it
very low."
By "low," Tanner means very
low. For the concerts that carry
an admission price, the cost for
students is between one and two
dollars.
"We have everything from
Medieval monody to baroque
polyphony, classical symphonies
and romantic tone poems, to the
farthest out contemporary music
and most nostalgic big band
jazz," Tanner added.
Four series
Four series will be presented
by the department beginning this
Fall.
Series A features the outstand
ing Francesco Trio, returning for
its ninth season. A Brahms
mini-series is scheduled for the
three Fall performances.
During the winter, the Trio
will he joined by such performers
as Marie Gibson, singing Shos
takovich's Romance for soprano

and trio, and vocalist John
Graham. Climaxing the season
will be an all-Beethoven concert
in May.
The Stanford Stars is the
theme of Series B. Many of the
finest musical artists in the Bay
area teach music at Stanford and
will be presented to the commun
ity through this series. Margaret
Fabrizioand Alexandra Hawley;
Charles Ferguson and Marie
Gibson are this year's featured
performers.
Series C begins the choral per-

formances — on November 24,
and 25 with Mozart's Mass in C
Minor and Exsultate Jubilate.
Following this on March 1
Handel's Judas Maccabeua will
be performed and on May 29,
the War Requiem' by Benjamin
Britten will close this series.
The Stanford Orchestras ac
count for the performances in
the final series of the four. The
Chamber orchestra will kick-off
with a performance on
November 5 in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
On November 11, the Sym-

phonv Orchestra will make its
debut of the season.
The two groups come together
for a festive celebration of holi
day music on Sunday December
7, followed by three more per
formances during the remaining
two quarters.
In addition to the perfor
mances offered by these series,
the Music Department has
scheduled a number of other of
ferings.
Heading the calendar is a per-

formance on October 1 by Jill
Mueller on the organ in Memo
rial Church. This will be followed
by music from the Center for
Computer Research on October
7.
The performances continue
non-stop through the year, often
with a varied selection of shows
packed into one week.
Participation
But. the emphasis of the Music
Department program is pointed
more toward participation than
spectating. Of course an audi

ence is always nice, but, as the
department is relatively small in
numbers, it thrives on participa
tion by non-majors. For in
stance, about SO percent of the
symphony is comprised of non
majors.
"Naturally we're looking for
audiences," Tanner said, "but
we also want performers! If you
are a bathroom tenor or a closet
bassionist why not come out of
hiding and join one of our
groups?"

There are 10 performing
groups that will he auditioning
on September 29 and 30. They
are: The Chorale/Chorus/Choir,
the Marching Band/Studio
Band/Wind Ensemble, Sym
phony Orchestra/Chamber Or
chestra, Opera Workshop, Piano
& String Chamber Music. Per
cussion Ensemble, Glee Club,
Early Music Singers, Renais
sance Wind Band, and the En
semble For New Music.

tion (SMA) serves the under
