# Ram's Head quality acting

### Robin Millington Editor 
One of the more intimate per
forming groups on campus goes
by the affectionate name of
Ram's Head.
Ram's Head is a group of very
talented singing, dancing and
acting students who love nothing
more than to put on a good show.
Almost invariably, they do.
The group holds auditions for,
and presents, four large produc
tions each year. Traditionally,
two of these productions are
musicals: Gaieties in the Fall,
and a major Broadway musical
in the Spring.
Gaieties, for new comers to
the campus, is a student written
and produced production,
time-honored in the Stanford
traditions which surfaces annu
ally at Big Game. The point of
Gaieties is often either to parody
life at Stanford, or as has been
done in the past, to parody the
ri\ illr\ between Cal and Stan
ford.
For a number of years Gaieties
was not produced, but the tradi
tion was revived four years ago
and has become a very popular
must do during the pre-Big

Game festivities.
Auditions for this gala event,
which has been in the process of
conceptualization and writing
since last Spring, will be held Oc
tober 7, 8 and 9. Watch for an
nouncements of the time and
place.
The Second major musical
production is the Spring musical.
This year Ram's Head is plan
ning to stage West Side Story, on
April 16. 17 and IK. Auditions
for this show will be held in
January. Past musicals the group
has produced include Fiddler on
the Roof, Music Man and Kiss
Me Kate.
During Winter quarter. Ram's
Head sponsors the Winter
One-Acts, original performances
by anyone who feels like being
original.
Finally, to round-out this
year's bill-of-fare. the group will
present the Ram's Head Revue,
a dancing, singing, minstrell ex
traordinaire.
More information about the
shows and their auditions is av
ailable by calling 497-0801. In
terested students are invited to
visit the Ram's Head offices in
the Old Firehouse.
