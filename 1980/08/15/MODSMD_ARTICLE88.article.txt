# Need a study break?
## Try the campus galleries 
### 
Have you ever thought you'd
like to see the real "Gulden
Spike"? Are you an avid con
chologist or minerologist?
It so, you can find such trea
sures right here on campus.
Listed below are some little
known or often forgotten places
to visit when you feel in need of a
study break or want to do some
near-by exploring.
The Physics Exploramaon the
second floor of the Varian
Physics Lab is a do-it-yourself
physics museum, with experi
ments and changing displays that
invite visitor participation. The
Explorama is open weekdays
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., telephone
497-4233.
The Leland Stanford Jr.
Museum has early American art,
oriental jade. Little Leland's
toys, a fantastic 91-piece exhibit
of Rodin sculpture, and yes, the
actual "Golden Spike," which
Leland Stanford and his fellow
railroad magnates pounded into
the rails at the joining of the
transcontinental railroad. The
museum is open Tuesday
through Friday 10-4:45 p.m.,
and admission is free. Tours are
available Tuesdays at 12:15 p.m.
and Sundays at 2 p.m.
The Art Gallery, located bet
ween Hoover Tower and the
Quad, houses smaller, changing
exhibits. Admission to the Gal
lery, open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Tuesday through Friday, and 1
to 5 p.m. Saturday and Sunday,
also is free.
For a quiet place to stroll or
just to sit and think, you might
visit the Stanford family
mausoleum, or the nearby cactus
gardens, both found in the
northeast section of the Ar

boretum. It's different .. . and
actually quite lovely.
And, perhaps for rainy days,
anyone who's ever combed a
beach will enjoy the conchology
(sea shell) collection tucked up
under the eaves on the third floor
of Geology Corner (in the Quad,
room 34 1). You can stop by from
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through
I riday, except during lunchtime.
Telephone 497-2537.
Another collection — thanks
again to the Geology Dept. —
may be found upstairs in the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Build
ing, right outside the library,
where a display of spectacular
minerals from all over the world
is on view.
In the lobby of the Coffee
House in Tresidder, you can

often find a photograph exhibit
that features the work of loeal
artists. The exhibits usually in
clude landscapes and "human in
terest" candids shot in black and
white.
And the University's Rare
Book Collection is kept in the
Bender Room of the Main Lib
rary — a cluttered, interesting
browsing room filled with an
tiques. The Bender Room is
open Monday through Friday, S
a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday,
a.m. to 5 p.m. 497-4054.
Keep these little "get-aways"
in mind. The next time you need
to stop fidgeting and escape from
the books — but haven't the time
or money to make it farther than
your own "backyard" — they
may be just the thing.

Museum-goers need not fear here — Stanford offers a hit of selection
in this area, starting with the Stanford Museum just oIY Palm Drive.
