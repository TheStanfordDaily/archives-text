Where can I get tickets?
This good question has a good
answer: Tresidder Ticket Office,
a University-subsidized service
to the community.
Located on the second level of
Tresidder Union, next to Wells
Fargo Bank, the ticket service
has ducats for nearly all campus
and Bay area events — and if
they don't have them, they'll try
their best to find out who does.
Campus groups such as The
Lively Arts, Special Events and
the Music and Drama Depart
ments all use Tresidder Ticket
Office as their major ticket out
let — and they often offer
through them some good student
discounts. The Lively Arts, for
example, has student ticket

prices at up to 50 percent off the
general admission.
The Ticket Office itself has the
convenient policy of selling for
campus events two student
priced tickets for every one stu
dent I.D. card presented.
The Ticket Office also has a
Ticketron outlet — a major
computerized ticket agency in
California, which brings most
major Bay area sports events,
shows and concerts within easy
reach of Stanford ticket-buyers.
Ticketron also sells tickets to
tours of Hearst Castle at San Si
meon and campsite reservations
for many California State parks.
As for the San Francisco Sym
phony, Ballet and Opera, as well
as the American Conservatory
I heatre, tickets for all are avail
able through the Ticket Office's
voucher system.
