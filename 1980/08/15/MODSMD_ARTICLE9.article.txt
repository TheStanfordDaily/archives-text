### Kathy Martin The Associated Press 
MIAMI — A National Air
lines DC-10 hound from Miami
to Puerto Rico with 223 people
aboard was hijacked yesterday
night and diverted to Cuba, the
third jetliner hijacked this week.
Federal Aviation Administra
tion officials said.

National Right 872 was com
mandeered at about 7:40 p.m.
EDT after leaving Miami Inter
national Airport at 6:38, FAA
spokesman Jack Barker said in
Atlanta.
*"lt appears there were a total
of five (hijackers) at this point."
he said, adding there was no
word on how the hijackers took

control of the plane. Barker said
the hijackers were Spanish
speaking males. The National
DC-10 jet had 211 passengers
and 12 crew members. Barker
said.
The plane was expected on the
ground at Jose Marti Airport in
Havana at about 8:35 p.m., Na
tional spokesman Walt Kobshaw
said in Miami, but there was no
immediate confirmation that it
had landed.
FAA spokesman Dennis
Feldman said it was not known
whether any of the hijackers
were armed.
It was the third hijacking to
Cuba in a week — an Air Florida
jet was hijacked Wednesday and
another Air Florida jet was
hijacked Sunday — and the
eighth successful hi jacking since
a June 12, 1979, incident.
No one was injured in the two
earlier hi jackings and the hijac
kers were reported detained in
Cuba. The passengers, crew and
planes were safely returned to
the United States.
