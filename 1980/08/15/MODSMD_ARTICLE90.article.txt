# Distinguished performers grace campus stages
## Lively Arts continues tradition of quality 
### Rick Altman Staff Writer 
As The Lively Arts at Stanford
begins its second decade on
campus, one thing it is not is a
misnomer.
Students can enjoy an artistic
extravagan/a in II separate
series, all of which have year-

long calendars.
The schedule of concerts and
performers fluidly blends cam
pus favorites — such as the
Guarneri String Quartet and
Music from Marlboro — with
several artists bringing their
programs to Stanford for the first
time.
The first concert of the year
will feature pianist Jean-Philippe
Collard, October 17, 8 p.m. in
Memorial Auditorium.
Chamber Music
Christened by The Guarneri
on October 29, the Chamber
Music series will present four

concerts through April. Indi
vidual prices are between $7 and
$8.50; the subscription price is
$37.
Duos & Trios
The heading tells all. as six dif
ferent groups will bring a myriad
of musical variety to the campus.

Kalichstein, Laredo, Robinson
will begin the series on
November 23. The Washington
Post described this trio as "near
to perfection as one is ever likely
to encounter."
Purchased individually, the
concerts will cost $44.50; the
subscription price is $35.

For the Young at Art
This series has been created
especially for children from ages
eight to 14. Illusionist Peter
Samelson, storyteller Odessa
Balalaikas, and the Ohio Ballet
will entertain the young folks
and probably the old folks as
well.
Jazz
Dinkelspiel Auditorium will
come alive from November to
April with four exciting jazz per
formances. George Shearing on
jazz piano begins the series on
November 19. A season ticket
costs $26.
Intervals
Six shows, once a month, will
bring piano, guitar, folksinging
and dance to Memorial Au
ditorium. Subscription price is
$39.
Solo Specials
Seven soloists will charm the
campus in Dinkelspiel and
Memorial Auditoriums from Oc
tober until May with violins,
pinaos, oboe and coloratura sop
rano.
Of special interest seems to be
a one-character play entitled:
Gertrude Stein, Gertrude Stein,
Gertrude Stein, starring Pat Car
roll. That little paradox comes
alive on January 30.
A season ticket will cost $51.

Spotlight
"For lovers of theatre and
dance." l our performances from
October through January that
have no correlation . . . except
that they are in the spotlight.
Sunday Chamber
This series will bring three
quartets and one tenor to Din
kelspiel one Sunday per month
from October to February. Fach
performance costs $8.50 or all
four can be purchased for $28.
Special Series
Although it hardly seems hu
manly possible, in addition to
those nine series, there will be
two special series: a film festival
lecture series, and free dance
lecture/demonstrations.
Leonard Feather returns to
Stanford with a film and lecture
series. Feather, the jazz critic,
composer, lecturer, lyricist, disc
jockey. TV producer, script wri
ter and columnist for the Los
Angeles Times has made selec
tions from his collection of rare

films and put them into three
packages: Women in Jazz,
November 17; Jaz/ Immortals,
January 26 and Duke Ellington,
April 13.
Since 1976, the lecture/
demonstrations in dance have
been favorites with Lively Arts
dance audiences. This year,
Lively Arts presents four more
opportunities to further enhance
your appreciation of the dancer's
world.
Dance
Ohio Ballet kicks off the
Dance series on October 24.
"Just when one thinks that the
dance world must surely have
exhausted itself," proclaims the
San Fr an ci sco Chroni cl e,
"something like the bright and
snappy Ohio Ballet comes along
to prove there is still much more
out there to behold."
The Dance series also presents
four performances through Ap
ril, and $6.50 can be saved off
admission prices through the
subscription rate.
