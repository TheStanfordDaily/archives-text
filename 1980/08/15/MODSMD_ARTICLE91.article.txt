# Special Events continues shows, but faces possible cancellation
## 
### Robin Millington Editor 
It should come as no surprise
that college students largely pre
fer contemporary music and con
temporary concerts.
In an effort to meet these pre
ferences an ASSU project was
formed in to help promote
and bring concerts to the Stan
ford campus. Special Events was
an attempt to bring good con
temporary music to the students
so they would not have to drive
all over the Bay area, and an at
tempt to allow students to con
trol and manage a concert prom
otion business.
As of press time, the future of
this 10-year-old campus institu
tion is highly in question.
As a result of financial and
management difficulty over the
last five years, aggravated by a
large loss this past year, the Stu
dent Financial Manager, Steve
Davis, will be making a recom
mendation for closure of the pro
ject to the ASSU Senate this fall.
According to Davis, the
reason for the request stems
from a need to re-evaluate and
study the project - goals, scope,
and operating.
According to Davis the reason
for the cancellation request
stemmed from a need to
reevaluate and study the project.
The study will concentrate on

how the project is organized,
why the project is in financial
trouble and will search for alter
natives and suggestions for the
future to make it financially feas
ible.
"It could be three months, it
could be never before it starts
operation again." Davis said. "I
think the campus will continue to
have concerts, there just may be
a period of time when it will
not."
"My concern is that people be
understanding and let us do our
evaluation and not pressure us to
have concerts. Its going to take
time to explore all the alterna
tives," he added.
Special Events has played an
integral role in campus enter
tainment. Last year Special
Events brought such notables to
campus as Stephen Stills, Joan
Baez, Firefall, the Little River
Band, Southside Johnny and the
Asbury Jukes, Dave Mason,
Poco and Harry Chapin.
In addition, the project spon
sored a benefit concert headlin
ing Jefferson Starship for the
Community Association for the
Retarded and the Stanford Vol
unteers for the Handicapped.
This concert drew approximately
$7500 for these charities.
Another successful program
produced last spring was a Blue
Grass Festival featuring Emmy
Lou Harris.

Pending the outcome of the
senate vote, a number of projects
are tentatively being discussed.
Ihe Blue Grass Festival will
again be scheduled for May, a
jazz festival, originally scheduled
tor October 5 (but since can
celed) will hopefully be
scheduled later this year and,
one of the big names in rock and
roll has contacted Special Events
about the possibility of doing a
benefit for the Stanford Chil
dren's Hospital sometime this
fall.
One of the innovations
brought to campus by the or
ganization last year was creating
the "Tresidder Ballroom,"
which offered an intimate
nightclub-type atmosphere.
Such groups as the Greg Kihn
Band, Spyro Gyra and the Spe
cials performed here to audi
ences of 200 to 300 people.
"There has always been a need
for a small place to hold perfor
mances. We've turned the Tre
sidder Ballroom into a small
concert hall with a very profes
sional atmosphere. The students
got a lot out of it â€” it was a great
project we intend to continue if
we can," said Lenny Lieberman,
project director.
One of the criticisms of Special
Events in the past is that the
power structure, composed of
the director, associate director

and production manager has be
come too "top-heavy."
Associate Director Todd Har
ris said one of the goals of the
organization this year, should it
continue, is "to involve a greater
number of students in the pro
duction and promotion of the
concerts."
Harris said one possibility is to
organize specific projects within
both production and promotion
and assign a project manager for
duties such as hospitality, dis
tribution of flyers and design of a
logo. Thereby responsibility
would be distributed to a greater
number of people.
Lieberman also suggested that
a student committee be formed
to study student tastes and re
commend possible artists or
programs responsive to these
tastes. This would be an attempt
to keep Special Events open to
student suggestions.
Ihe problem Lieberman
pointed to is that few students
have made an effort to get in
volved in the past. "Where are
the students? We have had room
for them all along."
Should Special Events con
tinue, there will be many oppor
tunities available for student in
volvement. For anyone in
terested in the various oppor
tunities call 497-9651 for infor
mation.
