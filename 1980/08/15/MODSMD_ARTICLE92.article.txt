# Amusement Parks in the area
## Fun for the children in all of us 
### 
The San Francisco Bay area
has an abundance of attractions
that are hailed as full days of fun
for kids. But if you don't watch
out, you might find yourself
spending more time at these
places than the kids.
The most publicized and most
frequented amusement center in
the area is Marriott's Great
America in Santa Clara. One
admission price covers all the
rides, shows and attractions con
tained in the 200-acre park,
which features the most thrilling
rides in the area.
The park offers the now
famous Demon roller coaster
and the breathtaking Tidal
Wave.

In the evenings, one of the
bumper car pavillions is trans
formed into a giant disco.
A half hour north of Marriott's
in Redwood City is Marine
World/Africa USA, celebrating
its twelfth anniversary this year.
This park features trained
marine mammals, African ani
mals, and talented humans.
Some of the famous perfor
mances and attractions include
the killer whale show, the lova
ble dolphins, a safari scenic boat
ride, and an incredible water ski
and boat show, starring a human
pyramid on skis.
Perhaps the most popular at
traction in the area for all ages is
the Santa Cruz Beach

Boardwalk. Over 110 years old,
the Beach Boardwalk offers 19
major rides, including the Giant
Dipper, one of the top 10 roller
coasters in the world, six restaur
ants, the famous Coconut Grove
Ballroom, and a mile of beautiful
white beach.
When its time to vent all the
frustrations that rush hour traffic
has given you, visit Malibu
Grand Prix.
You can drive scaled-down
racing cars beyond freeway
speeds, around a professional
track with straights and hairpin
turns. At the end of the lap you
will be given your time, exact to
the hundreth of a second, and an
opportunity to try again.

When you don't have a full day
to spend, nor a wallet full of
money. Grand Prix Racing might
be just what the doctor ordered.
There are many more such
amusement parks which offer
family fun for a complete day or
evening. Youngsters will love
celebrating Christmas year
round at Santa's Village in
Scott's Valley. The Winchester
Mystery House in San Jose will
thrill and chill all visitors that
dare visit, and a full day of fun
and bargains can be found at the
Original San Jose Flea Market.
Take a friend or the kids to
one of the many attractions in
the area, and you just might find
yourself there for awhile.
