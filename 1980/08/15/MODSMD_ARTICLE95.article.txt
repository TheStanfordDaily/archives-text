The Leland Stanford Junior
Museum stands majestically at
the end of Museum Way.
Like any museum, it is lull of
the paintings, sculpture and pot
tery of the past — priceless tes
timony of lost civilizations or
examples of more contemporary
artists.
But the Stanford museum
claims a unique legacy: an entire
room devoted to the history of
the family who founded the Uni
versity.
Leland and Jane Lathrop
Stanford built the museum and
the University as memorials to
their son Leland Jr., who died at
16.
The museum, built in stages
from 1594. was modeled after a
building in Athens. It was origi
nally much larger than it is now,
extending into what is now the
anatomy building. But the 1906
earthquake destroyed the back
section; the remaining front sec
tion survived because it was built
of reinforced concrete. Much of
the pottery and sculpture were
destroyed.
Were it not for the quake, the
museum would have been the
largest private museum in the
world. Today, the Historical As
sociation of American Public
Works considers it one of the
most significant buildings west of
the Mississippi for its structure
and historical content.
The Stanford room, and other
parts of the museum, detail much
of the history of the family, from
its early business ventures to lit
tle Leland's playthings.
Married in I SSO. the couple
moved to Sacramento from the
upper Midwest, where Stanford
purchased his brother's store.
He later helped build, and was
president of, the Southern
Pacific Railroad. At first seen as
a risky financial venture, it later
proved to be a most lucrative in
vestment and helped to support
the University.

As a tribute to Stanford's ven
ture. the museum has a safe dis
playing a gold and silver spike,
symbols of the joining of the
Central and Union Pacific in
Promontory, Utah, which
formed the first transcontinental
line. Stanford was present at the
ceremony.
Among Stanford's other in
terests was the fledgling art of
motion picture photography.
Stanford hired the services of
San Francisco photographer
Edward Muybridge to prove that
when a horse is in motion, all its
hoofs can be off the ground at
once.
Muybridge placed, under a
layer of dirt, a wire connected to
a camera; when the horse ran
over the wire, a photograph was
taken. A series of photographs
was placed on a disc, which when
rotated, looked like a horse in
motion. A sequence of photos,
on display in the Stanford room
show that Stanford was correct.
During the Civil War. Stan
ford kept California on the
Union side and organized the
Republican party for Lincoln,
l ie was governor of California at
the time; after that, in IKSS. he
was elected Senator. His blue
Civil War uniform with gold but
tons and epaulets is preserved
under glass in the room.
'Precious jewel'
The Stanfords had been mar
ried IS years before their only
child. Leland Jr., was born in
IS6S. in Sacramento. Mrs. Stan
ford was 40 at the time of his
birth, and according to museum
docent Glenda Northway. her
son was her "precious jewel."
At 16, Leland Jr. planned to
enter Harvard and learn how to
run museums — they were his
passion. But before he got to
Harvard in ISS4. while with his
parents in Florence, in died of
typhoid fever.
When his son died, Stanford
sank into a coma from the shock.

Legend has it that in his father's
dreams, Leland Jr. appeared and
said, "live for humanity." When
he awoke, Stanford thought,
"California's children shall be
my children." This led to the es
tablishment of Leland Stanford
Junior University. Mrs. Stan
ford, as a memorial to her son
and to carry out his dream, built
the I.eland Stanford Junior
Museum.
Mrs. Stanford also took her
son's death very hard, and her
husband was happy she had a
project to keep her busy. While
the museum was being built,
museum docent and chairman of
the Stanford Family Portfolio
Peg Haneberg relates, Jane
drove the contractors crazv mak
ing changes in the design. The
contractors told Leland the de
sign changes would cost an addi
tion $1 1 .000. I le paid, believing
that "if you get the best first, it
only hurts once when vou get the
bill."
The Stanford room in the
museum is full of Leland Jr.'s
travel mementos and toys. One
can follow the course of his mat
uration through the relics.
His bicycle, with remarkably
well-preserved rubber tires,
dominates much of the room.
Mummified alligator
Leland Jr.'s childhood toys
begin with wooden soldiers.

paint sets, games, wood carvings
and drawings of ships he did at
age 10.
His early travel mementos in
clude lf>th century German
knives and forks, a corner of a
stove from a sixth century Ba\ a
rian castle, and a miniature Bank
of America safe.
He later collected scrolls from
Constantinople, elaborately de
tailed Roman, Florentine and
Venetian mosaics, arrowheads,
jewelry and a mummified hand
and alligator.
In his teens, he enjoyed shoot
ing birds and small animals on
the Palo Alto grounds. The
mounted creatures occupy a
whole section .if cabinet.
Many of the other museum ar
tifacts were collected by Jane. A
favorite is an Egyptian mummy
dated to the sixth century B.C.
She also donated a Cypriote pot
tery collection. Indian weavings
and a set of 1 Ith century Italian
columns, to name a few items.
Another eye-catcher is a paint
ing of the family, entitled "Sun
day Afternoon at Stanford." and
shows the family, friends and re
latives at the Stanford's Palo
Alto home.
The museum has recently ac
quired a permanent collection of
Rodin sculptures, donated by B
Gerald Cantor, a Beverh Hills
investment banker.
