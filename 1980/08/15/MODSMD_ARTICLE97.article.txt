# Bay area makes dreams come true for music fans
## 
### 
Because of San Francisco's
role in the development of rock
music, the Bay area has an ex
tremely good reputation in the
music industry. Bands and artists
of varying si/e and fame usually
include a spot in the area on .their
itineraries.
What follows is a summary of
the main arenas and pavilions in
the area that host touring music

performers:

purpose auditorium that features
performers likely to draw crowds
of more than I(),()()(). Capacity:
about 13,000. Geneva and San
tos, San Francisco (off Bayshore

acoustics. Hegenberger Rd. and
Highway 17, Oakland.
/.ellerhach Auditorium. Very
nice. An acoustically superb au
ditorium on the UC-Bcrkeley

auditorium tends to have the
more mellow variety of enter
tainers.
