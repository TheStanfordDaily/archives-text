# Beaches, mountains, forests close to campus
## California presents wonders of nature 
### 
There will always he days and
weekends when you'll want to
yet out from under the shadow ot
Hoover Tower. There will also
be moments when you will want
to get away but will only have the
time or means to go a few miles.
Whatever the case, you can get
away from it all at a countless
number of fun. beautiful and in
teresting places in northern
California. Some are just down
the street, while others are across
the state, but almost all have
such enjoyable features that
after a visit to one or more, you
will probably return thinking
that life at Stanford only begins
on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-minute
bike ride away, like the Palo Alto
Baylands, a favorite stop-over
for birds traveling on the Pacific
Flyaway. These birds, including
egrets, willets. ducks and more
ducks, feed closest to the shore at

the ebb of a very high tide. An
interpretive center at the Bay
lands (329-2506) schedules
films and lectures about Bay
ecology, and all visitors are wel
come to take their own tour over
the marshlands on miles of
inter-connecting wooden walk
ways.
"Hie Stanford foothills behind
Lake Lagunita offer good views
of the Bay, a place to go on a
mini-hike and many lovely spots
for picnicking. A number of
stairways over the fence adjacent
to Junipero Serra Blvd. enable
you to pick your own trail.
Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, hut if you can find a
phone bill, or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address, you
can get in to enjoy the open
spaces. Dusk is the time to watch
the small groups of deer that feed
on the watered green grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering trails.
For those who enjoy amuse
ment parks. Marine World-
Africa USA is a 60-acre park
that features performing jungle
and sea animals. It is located

north ol Stanford on Highway
101, in Redwood City (365-
744 ft).
Santa Clara thrills
South of campus, near Santa
Clara, the Marriott Corporation
has its four-year old, mammoth
Great America theme park,
which sports many wild "thrill"
rides tor the strong of stomach
and brave at heart.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mtn. Road in Woodsidc, is
only 30 minutes away from cam
pus by car. Drivers and bicyclists
who want to take a scenic route
to the park should drive out Sand
Hill to Portola Road, turn right
and then continue on Old
County Road to Woodside
Road. Turn right there, and then
left on Kings Mountain. The
park offers nature trails, vol
leyball courts, picnic areas and
other recreational facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches, but
in this area, they arc mainly for
surfing and sunning; even the
best of swimmers should be wary
of the cold waters and strong un
dertown.
Before you head for the ocean,
check the weather report. The
beaches are often foggy, even
when Stanford is roasting. In

mid-winter, however, you can
often enjoy a sunny day on an
uncrowded stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bay and Santa Cruz is dot
ted with spectacular, cliff
bordered beaches; some of the
lavorrte include San Gregorio
and Pomponio. (For those who
prefer to sun without a suit,
there's the public beach at
Bonny Dune, 10 miles north ot
Santa Cruz, and the private
beach one mile north of the state
beach at San Gregorio.)
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent elephant
seals at Ano Nuevo beach, to
which they migrate during the
mating season. And it you simply
must go ocean swimming, the
beaches in the Santa Cruz area
and south are relatively safe —
but still cold.
Hiking nearby
For day trips or longer. Big
Basin, home of fine stands of

California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a halt
away by car, or four to five hours
hy hike. I lead up Page Mill Road
to Skyline Boulevard, then turn
left, keeping your eyes open for
signs to Big Basin and breathtak
ing views of mountains and the
sea. It's a right turn on Highway
9 and then down Highway 236 to
the park headquarters, from
there, hundreds of miles of trails
can lead you to mountain peaks
or down to the ocean.
Or. take four hours hy car to
drive down to Point Lobos Pre
serve, a beautiful seascape area
complete with sea otters, ocean
spray, and hiking trails. Point
Lobos is approximately seven
miles past Carmel. itself a charm
ing place to visit if you like to
shop. In addition, the nearby
town of Monterey is full ot
California history, dating from
the days of Spanish missions and
later. John Steinbeck's novels.

Once the awe and delight of the Stanford campus has subsided,
students can investigate the rest of California. A common favorite is
the coastline, starting just 17 miles west of campus.

Once the awe and delight of the Stanford campus has subsided,
students can investigate the rest of California. A common favorite is
the coastline, starting just 17 miles west of campus.
There will always he days and
weekends when you'll want to
yet out from under the shadow ot
Hoover Tower. There will also
be moments when you will want
to get away but will only have the
time or means to go a few miles.
Whatever the case, you can get
away from it all at a countless
number of fun. beautiful and in
teresting places in northern
California. Some are just down
the street, while others are across
the state, but almost all have
such enjoyable features that
after a visit to one or more, you
will probably return thinking
that life at Stanford only begins
on the Farm.
For the birds
At the foot of Embarcadero
Road, no more than a 30-minute
bike ride away, like the Palo Alto
Baylands, a favorite stop-over
for birds traveling on the Pacific
Flyaway. These birds, including
egrets, willets. ducks and more
ducks, feed closest to the shore at

the ebb of a very high tide. An
interpretive center at the Bay
lands (329-2506) schedules
films and lectures about Bay
ecology, and all visitors are wel
come to take their own tour over
the marshlands on miles of
inter-connecting wooden walk
ways.
"Hie Stanford foothills behind
Lake Lagunita offer good views
of the Bay, a place to go on a
mini-hike and many lovely spots
for picnicking. A number of
stairways over the fence adjacent
to Junipero Serra Blvd. enable
you to pick your own trail.
Foothills Park, up Page Mill
Road, is only open to Palo Alto
residents, hut if you can find a
phone bill, or something else
bearing a Palo Alto address, you
can get in to enjoy the open
spaces. Dusk is the time to watch
the small groups of deer that feed
on the watered green grass.
Rock climbers meet at Castle
Rock State Park on Skyline
Boulevard for bouldering, and
botanists, bird watchers, and
hikers enjoy its wandering trails.
For those who enjoy amuse
ment parks. Marine World-
Africa USA is a 60-acre park
that features performing jungle
and sea animals. It is located

north ol Stanford on Highway
101, in Redwood City (365-
744 ft).
Santa Clara thrills
South of campus, near Santa
Clara, the Marriott Corporation
has its four-year old, mammoth
Great America theme park,
which sports many wild "thrill"
rides tor the strong of stomach
and brave at heart.
Huddart Park, located on
Kings Mtn. Road in Woodsidc, is
only 30 minutes away from cam
pus by car. Drivers and bicyclists
who want to take a scenic route
to the park should drive out Sand
Hill to Portola Road, turn right
and then continue on Old
County Road to Woodside
Road. Turn right there, and then
left on Kings Mountain. The
park offers nature trails, vol
leyball courts, picnic areas and
other recreational facilities.
In California, of course, one
naturally thinks of beaches, but
in this area, they arc mainly for
surfing and sunning; even the
best of swimmers should be wary
of the cold waters and strong un
dertown.
Before you head for the ocean,
check the weather report. The
beaches are often foggy, even
when Stanford is roasting. In

mid-winter, however, you can
often enjoy a sunny day on an
uncrowded stretch of sand.
Highway 1 between Half
Moon Bay and Santa Cruz is dot
ted with spectacular, cliff
bordered beaches; some of the
lavorrte include San Gregorio
and Pomponio. (For those who
prefer to sun without a suit,
there's the public beach at
Bonny Dune, 10 miles north ot
Santa Cruz, and the private
beach one mile north of the state
beach at San Gregorio.)
In the winter, you can also
usually see magnificent elephant
seals at Ano Nuevo beach, to
which they migrate during the
mating season. And it you simply
must go ocean swimming, the
beaches in the Santa Cruz area
and south are relatively safe —
but still cold.
Hiking nearby
For day trips or longer. Big
Basin, home of fine stands of

California Redwoods and
wildlife, is just an hour and a halt
away by car, or four to five hours
hy hike. I lead up Page Mill Road
to Skyline Boulevard, then turn
left, keeping your eyes open for
signs to Big Basin and breathtak
ing views of mountains and the
sea. It's a right turn on Highway
9 and then down Highway 236 to
the park headquarters, from
there, hundreds of miles of trails
can lead you to mountain peaks
or down to the ocean.
