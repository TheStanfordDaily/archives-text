# Wineries not to be missed
## 
### 
Not that visiting wineries is the
only thing to do in Northern
California, hut there really aren't
too many places that don't has e
at least one winery nearby.
Seems like any little jaunt to the
countryside can include a brief
stop for local conversation and a
few taste treats.
Spring is the most beautiful
time of the year to travel around
the vineyards because the hills
are green, the vines are just start
ing to sprout shoots on their
twisted, gnarled trunks and wild
mustard is everywhere.
Frankly, the whole scene is so
damn romantic that I simply
cannot be held responsible if you
take one of these trips with
someone of the opposite sex and
later find yourself overly in
volved. Discipline and mental
rigidity are difficult to maintain
while frolicking in the Chesbro
Reservoir after an afternoon of
tasting wine in the Hecker Pass.
Several wineries exist within a
few miles of Stanford should
gasoline be a problem. These
places are quite small though and
it would be prudent to call them
ahead of your visit to make sure
that someone will be around.
Usually, these three wineries
are open one weekend each
month. Page Mill Winery (948-
0958) is on Page Mill Road not
far beyond the freeway, Sherrill
Cellars (8.51-1932) is under the
Post office in Woodside and
Woodside Vineyards (851-
7475) is half a mile up Kings Mt.
Road toward Huddart Park.
All three of these wineries re

fleet the family operation ap
proach which is starting to blos
som all over the United States.
They do not make very much
wine and are able to sell it all at
the winery without the added
expense of going through dis
tributors and retailers.
Likewise, they can make wines
the way they like them rather
than trying to please the median
tastes of the mass market. Hence
their wines tend to be very dis
tinctive and thus good examples
from which to learn about the
intricacies of grape growing and
wine making. All three
winemakers are charming,
knowledgeable people who
make visits a real delight.
Most tourists interested in
wine want to visit Napa Valley
because of its widespread repu
tation. Unfortunately, the
crowds drawn by the reputation
make most visits somewhat of an
ordeal.
You won't be invited to taste
the best wines and you won't be
lieve how long it takes to get
back if you have to come across
the Golden Gate Bridge late on a
Sunday afternoon. My sugges
tion for visiting Napa is togodur
ing the week.
A much closer and more hos
pitable trip is to go south and see
the range of wineries operating
in the Santa Clara Valley. Big
ones like Paul Masson and
Mirassou have nice tour prog
rams and elegant tasting rooms.
They make several excellent
wines (mostly from grapes grown
in the Salinas Valley) in addition

to the mass merchandised, rather
pedestrian products which com
prise most of their large volume.
A visit to either of these
facilities provides an interesting
contrast to the tiny, family
wineries of the Meeker Pass:
Technology and corporate capi
tal versus love of the soil and
hands stained red from the pro
duction of an important part of
the family's diet.
Hecker Pass is aobut 45 mi
nutes driving time from Stan
ford. Once there, several
wineries are within walking dis
tance of each other. Picnic areas
are convenient and the gently
rolling hills make bicycle explo
ration of the area very pleasant.
The wineries all have tasting
rooms, but they are not the
tourist spectacles that have
turned Napa into another Dis
neyland.
To get to Hecker Pass, drive
south on Highway 101 and con
tinue into the town of Morgan
Hill rather than taking the left
hand jog that would put you out
on the freeway. Drive through
Morgan Hill and turn right on
Highway 152 toward Watson
ville (there is a mushroom farm
at that corner). Follow that road
all the way around to where it
dead ends in Hecker Pass Road.
At that point you can turn to
your left and visit Live Oak or
Bertero, turn to your right and
visit Hecker Pass or Fortino. or
walk straight ahead and catch the
very entertaining and eccentric
Thomas Kruse.
