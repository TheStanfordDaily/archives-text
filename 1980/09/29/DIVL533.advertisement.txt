be limited to the
classroom.
Most of the students who have passed
through this University will agree that the
spirit and the letter of that statement has
not been ignored by the University, its
professors, nor its students. The
opportunities to expand your
horizons are seemingly limitless. Political
groups, service groups,
consciousness-raising groups,
pre-professional groups, ethnic and
religious groups, academic groups and
especially peer groups all compete for the
time and talents of the members of the
student body.

As Shakespeare once almost said, 'such is
the stuff as the Stanford Experience is
made of/
Your 'Stanford Experience' is what you
choose to make it, and you can make it
almost any way you choose. Don't forsake
the opportunities to extend that Experience
beyond the lecture halls and library walls.
