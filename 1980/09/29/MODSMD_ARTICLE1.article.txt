## Elway accounts for four TDs

Norman, Okla. — Neither cold
nor rain nor the gloom ot not hav
ing Darrin Nelson — arid c ertainly
not the vaunted Oklahoma de
fense — could prevent Stanford
from its appointed touchdowns
Saturday.
The Cardinals shocked the
fourth-ranked Sooners 31-14,
breaking the Sooners' 20-game
winning streak at home and hand
ing them their first loss in nine
games.
Com! Ned with Washington's
34-10 l(\>s to Oregon, the win
again thrust Stanford to the foref
ront of the Rose Bowl picture.
Besides the ultimate irony of
whipping the Sooners in front of
their home folks, Stanford's third
win in four games was full ot
mind-numbing paradoxes.
Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer
said earlier in the week that his
team would have to control the
ball to win the game. Switzer said
he wanted Oklahoma to snap the
ball 90 times and hold the Cardi
nals to 45-50 snaps. Consider the
following:
—Stanford snapped the ball 90
times, Oklahoma 53;
—Stanford's time ot possession
was 40:13, Oklahoma's 19:47;

The ott-maligned Stanford
defense held the Sooners to three
first downs rushing;
—Stanford out-rushed Ok
lahoma 220-1 r > 5 and out-gained
them 457- <4 I;
—And they did it all without
all-everything Nelson, who de
cided |ust before kickoff that the
bruised hip he suffered against
Boston College Sept. 20 had not
healed.
Switzer's charges were shan
ghaied by some incredibly bad
breaks and an offense that never
warmed up. But most ot all, they
were beaten by the 6'4" wunder
kind sophomore who direc ted the
Stanford offense.
|ohn Flway just possibly came of
age Saturday, running and pas
sing a Stanford attack that seem
ingly never left the field.
Elway completed 20 of 34 passes
for 2.37 yards and three
touchdowns. He suffered but one
interception, quite a change from
last week's four, Flway consis
tently eluded a tough Oklahoma
pass rush to complete a pass, or
more often tuck the ball under
and sprint upfield. He gave a
dream performance and was one
three-hour nightmare forSwitzer.
"John Elway put on the greatest

exhibition ot quarterback play
and passing I have ever seen on
this field. He controlled the game
with his short passing game,
Switzer said. "He did exactly what
we wanted to do — control the
ball. We used five or six defensive
backs, but we couldn't stop him.
His ability to scramble and make
big plays kept them moving."
With a grin stretching from here
to Stanford, Flway celebrated in
the locker room. The sophomore
said the rain — a constant drizzle
that began Friday and lasted
through Saturday night was
meant tor Stanford.
"Once we got movement in the
rain, it was advantageous. We
threw under their coverage a lot.
We used the shotgun because we
knew Oklahoma hadn't tac ed a lot
of passing teams. It's easier to see
things from it,"he said of the for
mation.
Stanford offensive coordinator
Denny Green knew the rain
helped the Cards. "They had a
harder time keeping up with us.
We didn't pass sharply,
but their defense was not as fight.
We felt the ball-control passing
game put the rain to our advan
tage."
