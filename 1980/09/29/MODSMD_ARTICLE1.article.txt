# Cardinals bounce back with upset; Boom Sooners 31-14
## Elway accounts for four TDs 
### Ivan Maisel 
Norman, Okla. — Neither cold
nor rain nor the gloom ot not hav
ing Darrin Nelson — arid c ertainly
not the vaunted Oklahoma de
fense — could prevent Stanford
from its appointed touchdowns
Saturday.
The Cardinals shocked the
fourth-ranked Sooners 31-14,
breaking the Sooners' 20-game
winning streak at home and hand
ing them their first loss in nine
games.
Com! Ned with Washington's
34-10 l(\>s to Oregon, the win
again thrust Stanford to the foref
ront of the Rose Bowl picture.
Besides the ultimate irony of
whipping the Sooners in front of
their home folks, Stanford's third
win in four games was full ot
mind-numbing paradoxes.
Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer
said earlier in the week that his
team would have to control the
ball to win the game. Switzer said
he wanted Oklahoma to snap the
ball 90 times and hold the Cardi
nals to 45-50 snaps. Consider the
following:
—Stanford snapped the ball 90
times, Oklahoma 53;
—Stanford's time ot possession
was 40:13, Oklahoma's 19:47;

The ott-maligned Stanford
defense held the Sooners to three
first downs rushing;
—Stanford out-rushed Ok
lahoma 220-1 r > 5 and out-gained
them 457- <4 I;
—And they did it all without
all-everything Nelson, who de
cided |ust before kickoff that the
bruised hip he suffered against
Boston College Sept. 20 had not
healed.
Switzer's charges were shan
ghaied by some incredibly bad
breaks and an offense that never
warmed up. But most ot all, they
were beaten by the 6'4" wunder
kind sophomore who direc ted the
Stanford offense.
|ohn Flway just possibly came of
age Saturday, running and pas
sing a Stanford attack that seem
ingly never left the field.
Elway completed 20 of 34 passes
for 2.37 yards and three
touchdowns. He suffered but one
interception, quite a change from
last week's four, Flway consis
tently eluded a tough Oklahoma
pass rush to complete a pass, or
more often tuck the ball under
and sprint upfield. He gave a
dream performance and was one
three-hour nightmare forSwitzer.
"John Elway put on the greatest

exhibition ot quarterback play
and passing I have ever seen on
this field. He controlled the game
with his short passing game,
Switzer said. "He did exactly what
we wanted to do — control the
ball. We used five or six defensive
backs, but we couldn't stop him.
His ability to scramble and make
big plays kept them moving."
With a grin stretching from here
to Stanford, Flway celebrated in
the locker room. The sophomore
said the rain — a constant drizzle
that began Friday and lasted
through Saturday night was
meant tor Stanford.
"Once we got movement in the
rain, it was advantageous. We
threw under their coverage a lot.
We used the shotgun because we
knew Oklahoma hadn't tac ed a lot
of passing teams. It's easier to see
things from it,"he said of the for
mation.
Stanford offensive coordinator
Denny Green knew the rain
helped the Cards. "They had a
harder time keeping up with us.
We didn't pass sharply,
but their defense was not as fight.
We felt the ball-control passing
game put the rain to our advan
tage."

another touchdown.

Sophomore quarterback John Elway celebrates the
Cards' Oklahoma vie torv Saturday. Elway tompleted 20
of 34 passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns in
The opening surprise of the
game was in Oklahoma's winning
the toss, yet choosing to kick off.
It was probably a bad omen tor the
Sooners.
On the Sooners' first posses
sion it took them only two plays to
lose the ball. Halfback David
Overstreet fumbled at the Sooner
26, and Milt McColl recovered.
Four plays later, Ken Naber's 44-
yard field goal attempt was de
flected at the line of scrimmage
and fell short. It then looked like it
would be a defensive struggle.
However, after a penalty
plagued possession, the Cardi
! nals struck swiftly. Elway moved
| the offense 60 yards in only three
I plays, throwing 11 yards to Ken
jMargerum for the initial
[touchdown with 13:03 left in the
Mirst half.
t Two plays later, Oklahoma
} fumbled once again, and Stanford
5 was in business at the Sooner 44.
C After seven plays and only 3'/2
£ more minutes, the Cards were up
l 14-0. Elway completely fooled the
J Sooner defense, bootlegging it
J around right end from one yard
I out for the score.

Naber's 28-yard field goal made
it 17-0 late in the halt following a
10-play, 73-yard drive highlighted
by the talents of Nelson's substi
tutes, Mike Dotterer and Vincent
White.
Stanford wasted no time in the
second half, taking the kickoff
and using its new-found running
game to move downfield. The
only pass of the drive was the last
one, a 12-yarder from Elway to
Andre Tyler to widen Stanford's
edge. Oklahoma again fumbled
on second down as quarterback
).C. Watts was stripped of the ball
in the open field by linebacker
Craig Zellmer. Jay Summers reco
vered the ball at the Oklahoma 39,
and the Cards put their final
points of the day on the board.
Of the six Elway passes that
went in and out of the hands of
Oklahoma defenders, one was his
final touchdown pass. The nine
yarder rocketed through
linebacker Mike Coast's hands
into the waiting arms of a sur
prised Tyler, with 7:58 left in the
third quarter.
There were other advantages for
Stanford, such as sophomore
halfbacks Dotterer and White.

The pair combined for 121 yards
rushing. Dotterer broke runs of 29
and 30 yards, which were key
plays in two of Stanford's scoring
drives. "We got good blocking
and then we realized we could
run," Dotterer said.
The normally fumble-prone
Sooners lost five of six fumbles on
the slick artificial turf, including
one which might have halted a
possible change in momentum.
Less than two minutes after Ok
lahoma scored its first touchdown
late in the third period, the Soon
ers recovered a )im Brown fumble
near midfield and in two plays
streaked to the Stanford 4.
On an option right, Watts
pitched to halfback Chet Winters
trailing him all alone. But Winters
never got it, tumbling it out of the
end zone and giving Stanford the
ball on a touchback.
"We made some errors, with
fumbles and penalties," Switzer
said. "A wet field like that is not
good for a lateral running game
like ours. But I don't know if we
could have come back even with
that touchdown."
Switzer added: "I just never did
feel we could stop them."
