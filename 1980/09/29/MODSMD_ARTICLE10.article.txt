# Freshman Orientation '80
## Kennedy speaks to entering class Intellectual investment advised 
### Fran Miller 
In his lirst speech to the freshman class
as president of the University, Donald
Kennedy said Thursday Stanford "is de
signed to reward those who invest" and
although it is "possible to survive here
with only modest effort ... it will be an
intellectually sterile time if that is all you
ask ot yourselves and all you ask of Stan
ford."
Kennedy prefaced these remarks with a
response to common complaints ot faculty
inaccessibility at the University. Acknow
ledging the faculty does have a "variety ot
opportunities and even distractions,"
Kennedy expressed hope that students
will gain "from the vigor ot productive
academic activity around here, a definite
impression that thinking is more impor
tant than learning."
Stanford vs. Cal
On a lighter note, Kennedy expounded
on the differences between Stanford's
1980 freshman class and the treshman
class at UC-Berkeley â€” "that superb pub

lic institution across the Bay."
He said, "More of you plan to go on to
advanced degrees, but you and they tend
to select a very similar distribution ot
specialties. More of you plan to get a job to
help finance your education and more of
them plan to join a fraternity or club.
"You jog more than they do," continued
Kennedy, "but you drink more beer."
Adjectives
The president, who was introduced by
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon as a
Harvard graduate who has "overcome the
handicap," gave the freshman a statistical
rundown on the ad|ectives used to de
scribe themselves on their applications for
admission.
"Determined" was the most trequently
used, followed by "ambitious," "curious"
and "enthusiastic." Kennedy said at least
one student chose to describe himself as
"asthmatic," "klutzy" and "gaseous."
Following Kennedy's address, Vice Pro
vost and Dean ot Undergraduate Studies
Herant Katchadourian defended the at

tainment of a "liberal education" in his
speech to the freshmen. Paraphrasing
Alfred North Whitehead, he said it is not
the details which we lea/n but the general
principles of what we learn which sustain
us.
Katchadourian said it is necessary to
make the distinction between a "liberal
education" and"the humanities." A lib
eral education, he said, teaches one how
to use rational inquiry, a method of think
ing which Katchadourian said he i onsiders
essential.
Pressure
He warned "there are enormous pres
sures awaiting those set on a professional
career," and discouraged students from
aiming solely at "getting somewhere
rather than attaining knowledge which
tells you where you are right
now." Katchadourian encouraged seek
ing knowledge "for the hell of it," al
though he said that "if you can't express
yourself well in the language ot the land,
you are a dead duck."
