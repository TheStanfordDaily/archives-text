The Pacific Southwest Airlines strike
didn't keep all 1558 members ot the class
of 1984 from arriving at the Farm last
Thursday to begin orientation activities.
Orientation volunteer Noel Rosales said
that last-minute flight changes did leave
the red-shirted Stanford volunteers
somewhat unprepared. "The treshmen
ran around trying to find us at the airport,"
he said. "They're really spunky," he ad
ded.
Many frosh, upon seeing the campus for
the first time, were impressed with its
beauty, and "tropical" atmosphere.
Freshman Howell Flsiao commented,
"The people are beautiful, and the girls
walk around with tans. But, when the rest
of the school comes, it'll be supreme
chaos," he added.
The long lines for books and phones was
a major freshman complaint. Marisa Ong,
a late dinnerarrival Saturday night, said, "I
always seem to be standing in lines a lot

and missing my meals."
Nome trosh said they were frustrated
aft?r waiting in long phone lines only to
discover they had not brought the 525 de
po-.it required this year. They were re
lieved, however, to learn that Pacific Tele
phone will pay back the $25 with seven
pe.cent interest when students return the
phones.
As usual, freshmen were impressed
when their RAs greeted them by name.
Steve Neumann marvelled, "When I came
up five people said, 'You're Steve. You're
from Madagascar.' "
Cindy Franklin said this made Stanford
seem personal and "like home."
Many frosh said the food was better than
they had anticipated. Spike Young said, "I
cane here expecting the worst (from food
service):"
Dorm activities have been frequent and
vaiied. Several dorms had scavenger
hu "its, and Madera had a New Wave party
Saturday night. "We burned off our

chocolate sundaes dancing," said one
Madera resident, who added, "you know
it's going to be an exciting year when your
tirst night you go swimming in the foun
tain at 1 a.m."
The overall calibre ot their class impre
ssed most trosh. Franklin said, "I thought
it would be really intellectual here, but it's
not. People are smart in a nice way."
Frances Allocca said, "You love it at first,
and you know it's going to continue. The
freshmen are not as sophisticated as I'd
thought they'd be. They're very tun
loving."
She added, "Everyone feels kind of
privileged to be here."
Tracy Kristofterson noted, "The people
are really talented and interesting. It
(orientation) keeps you busy so you don't
get homesick," she said.
The number of bikes on campus amazed
other trosh. Ben Wo exclaimed, "It's big.
You can't get around just walking, but
once I got a bike I felt comfortable here."
