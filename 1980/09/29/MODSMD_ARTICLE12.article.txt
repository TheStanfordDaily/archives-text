# Western Culture program defended

Speaking to memhers of the first class to
face a Western Culture requirement since
that obligation was abolished in 1969, As
sociate Political Science Prof. Nannerl
Keohane defended the sequences by re
futing some hypothetical criticisms of the
program.
Keohane said although Stanford
educators, including herself, continue to
question the validity of the Western Cul
ture requirement and program, "the kind
of sequences we are offering are funda
mentally important to our sense of what it
means to be an educated person."
A skeptic, she said, might ask questions
such as "Why only Western culture, as
opposed to another, equally rich culture?
What counts as 'culture?' Why require it?
How are we going to learn to be critical of
the works we read, given that the authors
were, after all, human beings?"
She said that whether students gain a
sense of their own personal cultural roots
or are simply learning about "the cultural
soup" in which they live — even if only for
the next four years — the traditions and
continuities of the western past provide
new ways of questioning the world.
Keohane •■aid the sequences locus or
"high culture, ' that is, the "classics," both
because ot their "intrinsic excellence" and

because of their "continuity in dialogue."
"Writers from Plato on, read one
another and responded to each other,"
she said.
Women in politics
To the question of critical analysis of the
"great works," Keohane responded with
one specific suggestion from an area in
which she has developed an interest —
women in politics. "If you begin to notice
the way women were treated in Western
culture, it can give you a way to assess the
strengths and weaknesses of the works —
most of which were written by white,
upper-class males."
Keohane added that although it is not
impossible to find writers who were sym
pathetic toward women, heroines often
were described as "being like men." She
gave examples of three kinds of
stereotypes found in the literature
freshmen will be studying which give a
"partial view" of women.
Keohane singled out Aristotle and Sig
mund Freud for their view of women as
solely "domestic functionaries — house
hold machines." She said that not only
were domestic responsibilities described
as less important than duties such as going
to war, writing books, and running the
state, but that these writers "assume that

(hat's all women can do."
Natural monstrosity
Quoting Aristotle, Keohane said, "being
female is a monstrosity that occurs natur
ally." Freud, she said, provides a more
modern example of this dualistic world
view.
The second kind of stereotype found
often in the great works according to
Keohane, is that of "woman as a vessel of
divine grace and diety." Although she is
"the perfect symbol of all that is beauti
ful," as with Dante's Beatrice, she is
merely "the vehicle for Dante's realization
of himself. She's a muse of inspiration for a
man."
Keohane labeled the third kind of
stereotype, "woman as object for roman
tic, sexual love." Although Keohane said
she did not want to downplay this aspect
of women, she warned that they are "de
scribed through male eyes as wonderfully
mysterious and desirable objects" and
that "the mystery is essential" to make the
plots work. Keohane cited Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe and |ohn Keats as
writers who hold this view.
In conclusion, she urged the students to
approach the literature with "skeptical
admiration" and to recognize that while
these writers did produce great works,
they still had, nevertheless, "neuroses,
prejudices, and blind spots."
