A new student at Stanford
may understandably be con
fused by the alphabet soup ot
political organizations on
campus: SAC, SLS, DSOC,
SASA, RANE, SCOPE, RCYB,
etc. A bird's-eye view ot the
political geographv ot Stan
ford, while missing some ot the
subtle shadings and details,
may provide a frame of refer
ence for making some sense
out of this political diversity.
Personally, Stanford can,
like Caul, be divided into three
parts: lettists, libertarians, and
liberal-conservatives.
Stanford's leftists, in turn,
come in two varieties: the
"crazies" and the "soft" lef
tists.
The crazy leftists are
exemplified by the Revolutio
nary Communist Youth
Brigade (RCYB), a group of
self-proclaimed Marxists-
Leninists who enjoy prattling
about their "revolutionary as
pirations."
Even when, on occasion, the
RCYB has an interesting point
to make, they tend to present it
in a shrill, foolish, or obnoxi
ous manner. The "crazies" are
a source of embarrassment to
more intelligent leftists and a
source of amusement for
everyone else.
The "soft" leftists (local soft

leftist personality Marc
S trass man argues that the
proper term is "granola lef
tist' ) are the residue which
remains trom the now-defunct
New Left of the I%o's: a while
back, the soft-leftist Columbae
House actually held a '60s
nostalgia celebration to re
member the good ol' days ot
campus disturbances, race
riots, the war in Vietnam, etc.
Soft leftists favor soft
technology (solar power, re
cycling, no nuclear power),
n on-hierarchical/con sensual
modes of organization, an end
to expansive material growth
and progress, a "gentle"
foreign policy (unilateral dis
armament, anti-draft), etc.
Libertarians share leftist op
position to the draft and to cur
rent U.S. foreign policy; yet,
the basic perspective of liber
tarians is quite distinct. Liber
tarians' recurrent theme is
human rights; they view exist
ing governments as the prim
ary violators of individual
rights; and they argue that
governments must be held ac
countable to the same stan
dards of conduct that apply to
ordinary citizens.
Libertarians oppose all coer
cive restraints on voluntary
economic activity (whether
laissez-taire capitalism, volun

tary communes, or whatever)
and oppose all forms of coer
cive taxation; they oppose all
laws against victimless crimes
(drug use, homosexuality, etc.)
and all restrictions on civil
liberties (treedom of speech,
of the press, of association,
etc.); they oppose the dratt
and U.S. government military
intervention in the affairs of
other nations and favor an in
ternationalist program of free
immigration, free trade, etc.
Since most libertarians have
a temperamental aversion to
meetings, rallies, committees,
etc., their influence at Stanford
may be less than their num
bers. Because libertarians re
ject any attempt to coercively
impose on society a system of
morality or a blueprint for so
cial Utopia, the libertarians are
anathema to the other political
groupsat Stanford
It may seem odd to lump to
gether liberals and conserva
tives into the one grouping of
"liberal-conservatives." How
ever, there has been a substan
tial convergence between lib
erals and conservatives here at
Stanford.
For example, two of the most
outspoken student suporters
of Senator Edward Kennedy
(D-MA) have also been among
the strongest supporters of the
draft, while the most articulate
conservative student at Stan
ford last year was a determined
defender of the welfare state
and held up John Kennedy as a
political model.
This convergence of liberals
and conservatives toward a
common support of the
welfare/warfare state, effec
tively consummated here at
Stanford, is also proceeding,
albeit at a slower pace, on the
national scene. Supposedly
liberal Democrats support
draft registration and in

creased military spending. Re
publican presidential candi
date Ronald Reagan, the sup
posed defender of tree enter
prise, supports the tederal
bailout ot Chrysler Corpora
tion and the Social Security
program.
Beyond the three basic
groupings — leftists, liberta
rians, and liberal-conservatives
— are the mass of Stanford
students, largely apathetic
politically, not clearly commit
ted to any of the three activist
positions, now leaning toward
one then toward another.
In the current presidential
campaign, neither President
jimmy Carter nor Reagan
seems to spark much excite
ment among Stanford stu
dents; only Libertarian Ed
Clark and Independent-
Republican )ohn Anderson
seem to have generated much
enthusiasm.
This brief overview of the
political scene at Stanford is
necessarily'oversimplified and
superficial; doubtless, each ot
the groupings discussed will
feel that its views were in
adequately represented.
Nonetheless, it may serve as a
beginning framework for sort
ing out the political debates
and activities which occur
within the Stanford commun
ity.
