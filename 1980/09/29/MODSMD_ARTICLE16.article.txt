Mem Chu ignored
I notice with some disap
pointment that except for the
advertisement that Mem Chu
bought and paid for, there is
no mention at all of religious
activities at Stanford in the
orientation issue of the Daily.
Why this neglect? Is it delib
erate? Is there a conspiracy at
the Daily to ignore religion at
Stanford? Or does a staff which
is alert enough to include all
the ethnic groups, and give the
CPU a prominent mention,
simply suffer a lapse of con
sciousness when it comes to
religion?
