## Marc Strassman Strassman is 'not boring' 
### 
You may remember me 112 rom my campaign for
Congress in the Democratic primary this spring,
where I advocated an end to the nuclear age, an
energy policy based on renewable
zation and where I opposed reinstitution of the
draft as strongly as I supported an all-out effort
to gain inclusion of the Equal Rights Amend
ment in the Constitution.
Recent events, especially news of elevated
rates of skin cancer among personnel at the
Lawrence Livermore Labs, of nuclear weapons
storage in Concord, of radioactive edible fish
being created off the Farralon Islands from nuc
lear garbage dumped too close to shore, and
above all, of last week's "incident" at the Titan
ICBM silo in Arkansas, have provided alarming
confirmation of my view of earlier during this
campaign year that we must put an end to the
nuclear community before it puts an end to us.
These events, as well as the continued failure
ot other candidates for Congress in our 12th
District to set out a course of action or a program
to deal with the continuing energy/economic
difficulties we are undergoing as a nation, have
convinced me that I should re-enter the race for
Congress in the 12th District. I have, accord
ingly, taken out papers to be certified as an
official write-in candidate in the general elec
tion on Nov. 4.
Another factor in my decision was the deci
sion of the incumbent Republican congressman
to endorse and support his party's candidate for
president. While I think I thoroughly under
stand the reservations, hesitation, and general
lack of enthusiasm behind Congressman
McCloskey's endorsement of former Governor
Ronald Reagan, the fact is that there is now a
unified Republican Party slate in the 12th Dis
trict, and that slate is Reagan/McCloskey. There
are also other presidential/congressional teams
available to the citizens of the District:
Anderson/Olsen, Clark/Evers, and Hall/Fumino.
I hate to say it, but no one running for Con
gress here is supporting the incumbent Democ
ratic President. While there certainly are
reasons not to support him (I myself disagree
with him on nuclear power, energy policy in

general, military registration, the Chrysler bail
out and other points), I do think he ought to be
re-elected, mainly because the future I envision
under a Reagan administration, due to his ig
norance and insensitivity, and the sordid
character of his principal sponsors, is likely to be
brutal and dehumanizing in degree and kind lar
worse than that time when President Richard
Nixon and his minions had control of the Fed
eral apparatus.
I may be wrong, but I teel President jimmy
Carter is less likely to get us involved in a nuclear
war because of his serious study of the matter,
his system of moral principles and his general
methods of operating.
I have much less confidence in Ronald
Reagan's character and judgment. He is, after
all, the man who said of student protestors in
Berkeley, in connection with sending National
Guard troops and tear gas-spraying helicopers
into town to rout gardeners and children in
People's Park: "If they want a bloodbath, we'll
give 'em one."
Reagan must be stopped. He must be stopped
in California. And he must be stopped in the
12th District. I have endorsed Carter's candidacy
for president, and I hope he will hear ot and
endorse mine for Congress.
Also, there has been too little humor, too little
imagination, and too little creativity in this race
since I dropped out in )une, and that's another
reason why I thought I should get back into the
race, along with my memorable campaign slo
gan: "He's not boring," as important an idea as
it was last spring.
We need a Congressional representative who
will work to assure economic viability of our
valley and our country by seeking a national
consensus to convert our economy from its pre
sent war-time footing to a more solid base of
consumer products and space exploration, with
stable expectations for jobs, investment, and
living in general.
(Marc Strassman is running for Congress in the
12th Congressional District. He lost in the
Democratic primary to Kirsten Olsen.)
