# ASSU Financial Manager calls for Special Events shutdown
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
ASSU Special Events, the only
group with the right to promote and
stage contemporary music concerts
on campus, faces probable closure
as a result of a $90,000 delic it incur
red last year, according to ASSU
Financial Manager Steve Davis.
Davis said the student-run program
has created a "substantial drain" on
the ASSU budget. He will recom
mend to the ASSU Senate Finance
Committee, which will meet on Oct.
d, that the entertainment service be
closed.
The senate will vote at its Oct. 15
meeting whether to accept or reject
the recommendation; in the interim,
the project will be inactive and no
shows will be staged.
Until he reports to the senate,
Davis said he will not release any
figures on the specific productions or

circumstances which have led to the
highest deficit in the 10-year-old
program's history. However, he did
acknowledge that last spring's mis
scheduling of the Ffarry Chapin con
cert and the unprovable Knack con
cert were contributing problems.
In May of the year, then-Financial
Manager Bruce Bendix reported to
the ASSU Senate that Special Events
was posting a $20,000 deficit up to
that point.
Mismanagement by the project's
start, the program's structure and the
role of Special Events itself are other
factors the senate will examine in ad
dition to the high deficit, said Doug
Mitchell, senate chair.
"We will also look at whether Spe
cial Events should just try to promote
big concerts or perhaps instead do
smaller shows or even ballets and
symphonies," Mitchell added.

Special Events has been beset by
financial problems since it began in
1971. While Davis estimated the av
erage yearly debt at around $10,000
tormer Special Events personnel said
the figures were more often around
or above $20,000.
The program has only broken c ver
or shown a profit once or twice, said
Davis, although he could not say
which years that occurred.
In the past, the ASSU has been!â– 
to shoulder the financial drain from
Special Events due to the success of
other programs like the now-defunct
travel service, ASSU Lecture Notes
and the T-shirt business.
But this year, "the Association sut
tered an unacceptable deficit
through its continued sponsorship
of the project," according to a state
ment issued by the Council ot Presi
dents to explain the status of the pro

ject.
1 he COP further said a Task Force
will be assembled to evaluate op
tions for on-campus, student-run en
tertainment projects. COP member
Marc Ventresca said a report should
be ready in early December, after the
Task Force has had a chance to hear
from past Special Events directors
and financial managers, entertain
ment industry people, interested
University departments and con
?rned students.
Tension between the financial
manager and Special Events direc
tors, competition with other large
scale Bay Area promoters like Bill
Graham and University scheduling
conflicts are just a few of the prob
lems which have plagued Special
Events, according to several sources.
Two years ago, one concert alone,
featuring the Atlanta Rhythm Sec

tion, recorded a detic it of more than
$10,000, said a former Special Events
staff worker.
Lenny Lieberman, who served as
director of Special Events last sum
mer, said he thinks a re-evaluation ot
the project is a sound idea.
"Basically, it's a business that is los
ing money. It's a unique set-up, as
it's not subsidized by tee assess
ments, and we're trying to compete
with promoters plus inflation, high
production costs at Stanford and ar
tists' rising salaries," said Lieberman.
"The structure must be re
evaluated," he said.
Davis said he hopes students will
try to be understanding and "let us
do our evaluation and not pressure
us to have concerts. It's going to take
some time to explore all the alterna
tives."
The last Special Events program

was the loan Baez concert Sept. 7.
Baez's concerts have become some
thing of an annual event, as have
those ot Willie Nelson and Frank
Zappa, is well as some sort ot jazz
festival or picnic. Davis said the task
torce will probably try to determine
whether special committees can be
set up to handle these popular stu
dent programs.
"The structure as it exists right now
cannot make money. Whether stu
dents belong in the concert business
or not will have to be determined,"
Davis said.
Mitchell stressed that closure, it it
is voted by the senate, "is a hiatus,
not an ending point," and said he
thought the senate would ensure
that the right to promote concerts
here be retained by campus organi
zations.
