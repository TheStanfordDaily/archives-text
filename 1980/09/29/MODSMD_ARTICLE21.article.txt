# Events make headlines this summer down on the Farm
## 
### Julie Kaufmann 
Though most students are
away from the Farm from
June through September,
it's almost business as usual
at the University without
them.
This summer, the Advis
ory Board reaffirmed the
original Franklin decision,
the newly-planted Galvez
Mall was torn up and the Al
bers' Wall was finished and
dedicated. The Immigration
and Naturalization Service
granted a reprieve that will
allow Iranian students here
to remain until they have
completed their courses of
study.
By a unanimous decision
which was accepted by
then-president Richard Ly
man, the Stanford Advisory
Board reaffirmed the dis
missal ot former University
professor Bruce Franklin.
Franklin, who was dismis
sed in 1972 after the board
found him guilty of three
charges of misconduct
stemming from campus Vie
tnam War protests, was the
first tenured professor to be
dismissed from Stanford in
more than 50 years. The

American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) had sup
ported Franklin's appeals,
calling the dismissal "a
gross betrayal of . . .
academic freedom, indi
vidual liberty and funda
mental fairness," and eight
professors here agreed with
the ACLU that the decision
has had "chilling effect" on
academic freedom here.
Leaks in the chilled water
line between Crothers
Memorial Hall and Green
Library forced maintenance
crews to dig a 450-foot long.
16-foot deep trench
through the newly planted
flower beds and grass and
freshly laid asphalt and con
crete in order to replace the
piping.
Albers' Wall
The Stanford Wall, created
by the late sculptor Josef Al
bers, was completed and
dedicated after nearly a de
cade of controversy. Uni
versity President Donald
Kennedy acknowledged the
controversy surrounding
the structure of white brick,
black steel rods, black gra
nite and square stainless
steel rods, "Modern art on a

heroi( scale simply does not
readily vield to consensus."
The Wall is located on
Lomita Mall.
In a quiet policy shift.
President Jimmy Carter re
st inded his order to deport
Iranian students when their
current documents expire.
This move allows more than
70 Iranian students here to
tinish their studies before
returning to Iran.
Also, the University's
plans for construction of a
new dorm west ot Lagunita
Court that will house 800
undergraduates were ac
celerated so that construc
tion can begin as soon as
possible. Parts of the dorm
are scheduled to be ready
for occupancy by fall 1982.
Zetes can stay
Associate Dean for Resi
dential Education Norm
Robinson "held in
abeyance" the recommen
dation of Row Director
Diana Conklin that the /eta
Psi fraternity house lose re
sidential privileges for three
years. The Zetes were
placed under Intertraternity
Council (IFC) jurisdiction
for the academic year 1980-

81. Conklin calltu C Vin
son's decision a "three-way
win' because the Zetes
keep their house, the IFC
gets a chance to prove its
influence, and the Univer
sity does not need to handle
the "day-to-day" difficulties
with the Zetes.
Law prof dies
Associate Law Professor
Yosal Rogat was found dead
at his Palo Alto apartment
|une 10. Recognized among
constitutional scholars tor
his original work on Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Rogat, 51,
had been a University fa
culty member in law and
political science since 1%6.
He taught seminars in civil
liberties, free speech and
jurisprudence.
Wolfe Perry, former Stan
ford basketball standout,
will join the cast of the
weekly television series The
White Shadow. Perry said
he likes to think that he won
the job through his acting
ability and not merely his
athletic prowess. The only
"player" in the cast, he said,
"When they found out I
could dunk, they knew that
I wasn't just another actor."
