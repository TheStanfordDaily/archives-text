## Soaring housing costs reduce mobility 
### 
"llte Los Angeles Times
The cost of housing is significantly changing the
moving pattern of the American family, long noted
tor its mobility.
The impact of inflation has virtually forced immo
bility on those w ho would normally move in the tradi
tional fashion, every five or six years on the average.
The great majority of homeowners are not moving
but are improving their existing homes, making
home improvement a $40 billion a year industry.
Qn the corporate level, the high cost ot housing is
having another material effect, creating major policy
changes in procedures governing transfer and reloca
tion of personnel about the country. Consequently,
fewer of them want transfers.
More money
The net result is that corporations are having to
sweeten the money pot, be more selective of trans
ferees, and reduce long-established programs of giv
ing employees experience in other market sectors of
the nation.
Men ill Lynch Relocation Management Inc., New
York City-based executive relocation service firm,
sponsors an annual survey ot the Fortune 1000 firms
and 50 non-industrial companies' corporate reloca
tion policies to gauge the movement in that strata.
The newly concluded eighth annual (1979) study
conducted by Hagen Marketing Research Inc. for
MLRM shows that the confusing state of the
economy, and the outrageously priced costs of real
estate have caused a decrease among corporate per
sonnel who might seek or want transfers to other
locales, for a career change or new life style or be
cause of company necessity.

To overcome this unprecedented resistance, com
panies are having to liberalize their relocation be
nefits and become more selective about their trans
ferees.
Difficulties
Essentially, 52 percent of the bO7 responding firms
said employees had trouble selling homes; more
than twice as many companies as last year reported
transferees experienced difficulties in financing a
new home; almost a third of the respondents cur
rently offer aid in arranging mortgage financing,
while another 27 percent plan to establish a financing
assistance program within the vear.
Patricia Matteson, MLRM director for marketing,
said companies are now spending more money to
transfer fewer highly selected employees.
Such long-standing, short-term programs ol trans
ferring personnel to other sections of the country tor
experience are being cut back, she added, putting
the cost of such plans to use in the pot-sweetening for
tev\er executives designated by the firm as essential
or critical personnel who must be relocated, at any
cost.
In many cases, she explained, locale of work
("California, for instance") is coming to mean more
to executives than promotions within the company,
suggesting that life style, tor some high-level corpo
rate figures, is far more important than career ad
vancements and opportunities.
Financing problems
The most significant problems faced by transfer
ring employees, the survey found, were selling their
homes and financing new ones. There was a 38 per

cent increase ot those factors compared with the year
before.
The average firm transferred 143 employees, down
by 9 percent from two consetutive-year transfers of
157 persons annually.
For the first time, companies were asked to esti
mate the number of employees refusing transfers lor
any reason; i2 percent could not supply an answer
but the other two-thirds were aware ot at least one
person who refused to be transferred.
Wlnle the average acceptance-refusal ratio was 10
to 1, 11 percent of the firms reported that refusals
were greater than 1 in 4. In i percent of (he firms,
refusals ran as high as 1 in 2.
Funding increased
Many firms are being forced to increase real estate
related reimbursements for their transferred person
nel, the study showed.
"Mortgage rate differential programs can cost a
corporation an additional $2000 to $20,000 tor each
employee transferred," according to C.eorge
Rathman, MLRM president.
Among respondents, 95 percent offered some type
ot aid to help relocating employees sell their homes;
41 percent retained an outside relocation service firm
or bank to buy the home and 4.< percent said the
employee arranged for the home sale but was reim
bursed for some or all of the expenses, such as
brokerage fees, normal closing costs and duplicate
house carrying expenses.
Eleven percent of the firms offered to buy the
employees' homes and only 5 percent offered no aid
to their transferees.

Essentially, 52 percent of the bO7 responding firms
said employees had trouble selling homes; more
than twice as many companies as last year reported
transferees experienced difficulties in financing a
new home; almost a third of the respondents cur
rently offer aid in arranging mortgage financing,
while another 27 percent plan to establish a financing
assistance program within the vear.
Patricia Matteson, MLRM director for marketing,
said companies are now spending more money to
transfer fewer highly selected employees.
Such long-standing, short-term programs ol trans
ferring personnel to other sections of the country tor
experience are being cut back, she added, putting
the cost of such plans to use in the pot-sweetening for
tev\er executives designated by the firm as essential
or critical personnel who must be relocated, at any
cost.
In many cases, she explained, locale of work
("California, for instance") is coming to mean more
to executives than promotions within the company,
suggesting that life style, tor some high-level corpo
rate figures, is far more important than career ad
vancements and opportunities.
Financing problems
The most significant problems faced by transfer
ring employees, the survey found, were selling their
homes and financing new ones. There was a 38 per

cent increase ot those factors compared with the year
before.
The average firm transferred 143 employees, down
by 9 percent from two consetutive-year transfers of
157 persons annually.
For the first time, companies were asked to esti
mate the number of employees refusing transfers lor
any reason; i2 percent could not supply an answer
but the other two-thirds were aware ot at least one
person who refused to be transferred.
Wlnle the average acceptance-refusal ratio was 10
to 1, 11 percent of the firms reported that refusals
were greater than 1 in 4. In i percent of (he firms,
refusals ran as high as 1 in 2.
Funding increased
Many firms are being forced to increase real estate
related reimbursements for their transferred person
nel, the study showed.
"Mortgage rate differential programs can cost a
corporation an additional $2000 to $20,000 tor each
employee transferred," according to C.eorge
Rathman, MLRM president.
Among respondents, 95 percent offered some type
ot aid to help relocating employees sell their homes;
41 percent retained an outside relocation service firm
or bank to buy the home and 4.< percent said the
employee arranged for the home sale but was reim
bursed for some or all of the expenses, such as
brokerage fees, normal closing costs and duplicate
house carrying expenses.
Eleven percent of the firms offered to buy the
employees' homes and only 5 percent offered no aid
to their transferees.
"llte Los Angeles Times
The cost of housing is significantly changing the
moving pattern of the American family, long noted
tor its mobility.
The impact of inflation has virtually forced immo
bility on those w ho would normally move in the tradi
tional fashion, every five or six years on the average.
The great majority of homeowners are not moving
but are improving their existing homes, making
home improvement a $40 billion a year industry.
Qn the corporate level, the high cost ot housing is
having another material effect, creating major policy
changes in procedures governing transfer and reloca
tion of personnel about the country. Consequently,
fewer of them want transfers.
More money
The net result is that corporations are having to
sweeten the money pot, be more selective of trans
ferees, and reduce long-established programs of giv
ing employees experience in other market sectors of
the nation.
Men ill Lynch Relocation Management Inc., New
York City-based executive relocation service firm,
sponsors an annual survey ot the Fortune 1000 firms
and 50 non-industrial companies' corporate reloca
tion policies to gauge the movement in that strata.
The newly concluded eighth annual (1979) study
conducted by Hagen Marketing Research Inc. for
MLRM shows that the confusing state of the
economy, and the outrageously priced costs of real
estate have caused a decrease among corporate per
sonnel who might seek or want transfers to other
locales, for a career change or new life style or be
cause of company necessity.

To overcome this unprecedented resistance, com
panies are having to liberalize their relocation be
nefits and become more selective about their trans
ferees.
