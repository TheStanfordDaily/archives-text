CHICAGO (API — More than 100 lawyers representing
about 7000 Vietnam War \ eterans met Saturday to map out
their strategy in the legal battle against manulac turers ot
the chemical detoliant known as Agent Orange.
Ihe veterans contend exposure to the detoliant has
caused serious health problems, including birth delects in
their children and cam er. The chemical i ompanies named
in the lawsuits, however, deny any c onnec tion between the
chemical and the veterans' health problems.
Used by the Air Force as a detoliant in Vietnam trom I9W
to l i ro, Agent Orange was made up primarily ot two c hem
icals, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-7. Ihe United States slopped using
Agent Orange in Vietnam when scientists warned that it
may have caused birth detects among South Vietnamese
infants.
The plaintiffs lawyers, who claim the action may be the
largest product liability suit in U.S. history, are pooling
their resources and using computers to store information,
including scientific data about dioxin, a component oi
Agent Orange.
"This is the model lor handling litigation involving large
numbers ot plaintiffs" in product liability cases, said Victor
Vannacone, a New York lawyer and an organizer ot the
three-day conference, which ended yesterday.
During a break at Saturday's meeting, Vannacone said
the attorneys have decided to conduct a comprehensive
medical survey oi their clients, including information on
the veterans' children.
Once the study is completed, the lawyers will ask the
Veterans Administration to make a similar survey of 7000
men who were in the military during the war, but not sent to
Vietnam, he said.
