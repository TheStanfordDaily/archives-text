# Transfers 'clue in' to life at Stanford
## Dinner honors students 
### Steve Brown 
Taking the initiative and
"stealing everything intellec
tually that isn't tied down" was
some of the advice offered by
Dean of Admissions Fred Har
gadon at a dinner for transfer
students Friday.
A speech by lames Lyons,
dean of student aflairs, and
performances by the Mendic
ants, Kam's Head Review and
Counterpoint were also in
cluded in the evening's dinner
and program at Tresidder
lounge.
Hargadon apologized for
mailing acceptance letters late
this summer, explaining that
reviewing applications can't
begin until freshman-year
transcripts are mailed to the
admissions office in )une. He
added, "It would be easier for
us to just admit everyone who
has an application in . . . and
then go on vacation."
Transfer applicants are more
frank about theirachievements
than high school applic
ants, according to Hargadon.
"There's less hot air in transfer
applications. Very nicely you
didn't tell us what offices you
held in eighth and ninth
grade."

Instead, Hargadon noted,
the transfer applications read
more like a "Studs Terkel
book."
Hargadon urged students to
stop thinking of themselves as
transfers. "We don't ask you to
wear T-shirts emblazoned with
a scarlet T," he reminded the
receptive audience.
He also encouraged stu
dents to take the initiative in
getting to know faculty mem
bers. The transfers were in
vited to visit him any time at the
admissions office â€” provided
they could get past the sec
retaries hired to weed out rela
tives of applicants.
Hargadon's advice for
choosing courses was to "pick
the best teachers and then take
whatever they teach."
Lyons added a caution of his
own, telling transfers, "The
biggest problem you will face is
how to manage your time."
Transfers, he said, don't
have to be told how many days
one can go without sleep, how
much detergent it takes to do
the wash or how long it takes
for a check to bounce.
"The big question freshmen
are asked and you've already
answered is 'Can I make it

here?' " Lyons told the transfer
students.
Besides the dinner, events
planned for transfer orienta
tion included a slide show,
"Stanford: An Illustrated,
Anecdotal, Humorous Look at
the Past, Present and Future"
which was presented Thursday
by Assistant Archivist Vivian
Sykes in Annenberg Au
ditorium.
The slides followed a
spaghetti dinner that evening
on the Eating Clubs' lawn
which, according to one stu
dent, was "sparsely attended
but a lot of fun."
On Saturday, transfers
boarded buses at Tresidder
parking lot for a day at the
beach. That evening the Coffee
House sponsored a special
musical event for transfers,
and bowling was available next
door at Tresidder Recreation
Center.
Transfers also shared in
many of the freshman orienta
tion events over the weekend.
A welcome by President
Donald Kennedy, field day and
Citizen Kane were all on the
agenda, as well as band rehear
sals, language placement
exams and tours of the cam
pus.
