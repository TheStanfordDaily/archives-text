"We do not hold it against a
student who applies as a
freshman and doesn't get in,"
says Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon. In fact, 64 of this
fall's 159 transfer students had
applied to Stanford before,
and most were not admitted
the first time around.
Although the University re
serves spots for transfer stu
dents, more freshmen ac
cepted offers of admission
than expected, and 20()0 trans
fer applicants were left with 72
fewer places than last year, said
an admissions office spokes
man.
The 159 transfer students
come from 99 different col
leges and universities. Approx
imately 65 percent transferred

from private four-year institu
tions and 25 percent transfer- -
red from four-year public in
stitutions.
Hargadon notes that Stan
ford is the only highly selective
university that sets aside places
each year for transfer students.
This year's transfer class in
cludes 89 men and 70 women,
nearly the same percentage of
each sex as last year.
In comparison, applications
for this year's freshman class
numbered a record 12,731 and
1558 freshmen were enrolled,
57 percent men and 43 percent
women.
Eight percent of transfer
applicants were enrolled thn<>.
year, compared to 12 percent
of freshmen applicants.
