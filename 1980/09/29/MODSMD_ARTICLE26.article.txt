# Zoning changes limit building options near Med Center
## 
### Samuel Howe 
The Palo Alto City Council unani
mously approved a zoning change
last week which will limit the Univer
sity's building options on land near
the Medical Center.
In its Sept. 22 meeting, the council,
at the proposal of the city planning
commission, decided to zone the
site tor multiple-family housing. The
4.2-acre parcel owned by the Univer
sity at 1100 Welch Road had previ
ously been zoned tor office and re
search use.
Because Palo Alto zoning allows
housing to be built under any clas
sification, the University previously
would have been able to use the land
for housing or other purposes such
as medical research. Now the Uni
versity may use it only for housing.
Phil Williams, University director
ot planning, said no final decision
has been made about the land s fu
ture, but Stanford would have pre
ferred that it remain under the old
classification.
"We spoke at the hearings, and
suggested that the land remain vac
ant for two purposes â€” housing or
medical use," Williams said.
The University already plans to

build between 1200 and 1600 units of
housing on 4S acres adjacent to the
Welch road site.
There has been concern that more
housing in this area will worsen an
already significant traffic problem on
Willow Road, which stops abruptly at
the Stanford Shopping Center park
ing lot.
However, Williams said the Uni
versity might extend the road to El
Camino Real, bypassing the shop
ping center, it Stanford builds hous
ing on all the land which is now vac
ant in that region.
It is not clear how the cost ot such
an extension would be divided bet
ween the city and the University, but
]ohn Breedlove, University real es
tate manager, said he would expect
"a fair spread."
The council's action is part ot a re
cent Palo Alto pattern of rezoning
unused industrial and commercial
property tor residential use only.
This approach, the council hopes,
will alle\iate an imbalance between
housing and |obs in the city,
Palo Alto (not including Stanford)
has 68,000 jobs and onlv 24,000 hous
ing units. City projections predict an
increase of as manv as 6000 jobs ad

ding to that imbalance in the coming
decade.
The University has been studying
several potential housing sites on the
borders ot Stantord land.
The two largest sites, measured in
total housing units, have been ap
proved by the City Council tor hous
ing development. The Willow Road
site, bordered by Oak Creek Apart
ments and the Children's Hospital,
will provide up to 1600 housing units.
But the University still must secure
final approval for the 140-unit hous
ing project tor faculty and staff on
Peter Coutts Road, targeted tor com
pletion in early 1982.
The University has also authorized
construction ot 800 units ot under
graduate housing on campus,
scheduled torcompletion in 1983 at a
cost of $34 million.
But tor the present, housing shor
tages plague the University, creating
difficulties tor new taculty and staff,
current University employees and
off-campus students.
The City Council also voted to pre
serve as open space 438 acres of city
propertv adjacent to the southwest
corner of the University, along Page
Mill Road.
The city of Palo Alto's so-called

Arastra property will be added to
neighboring Foothill Park, with the
exception ot 77 acres, which the
counc il is c onsidering tor other uses.
Last February Williams said the
University had been ' testing the
waters" tor possible housing de
velopment in the area, but found it
hot" with opposition. No industry is
planned there.
But on Friday, he said the Univer
sity has never thought of purchasing
the Arastra property, which borders
Stanford land near the Powers
laboratory.
The city purchased the Arastra
property in 1976 for $7.5 million to
settle a lawsuit over open-space or
dinances. The last ot several other
suits against the city over land limita
tions was settled over the summer,
allowing the city to consider the fu
ture of the foothills land.
Monday night's council meeting
saw sharp discussion between con
servationists and those who argued
for more housing in the city.
Former Palo Alto Mayor kirke
Comstock, speaking for the Penin
sula Conservation Center, urged the
council to "give Palo Alto citizens a
piece of the land, by making it a part
of the park." Lou Goldsmith, chair

man ot the Palo Alto Housing Com
mission, proposed moderate de
velopment of the area to pro\ ide the
city with up to SIJ million in profits.
Fie said the profits could help cover
the land's purchase price.
Seven ot the nine members of the
council were present at the meeting.
All concurred on the Arastra deci
sion, while Vice Mayor Byron Slier
abstained from voting in the Welch
Road proposal. Sher is a professor in
the law school here, and said he
abstained because the issue's con
nection to Stanford could have
created a conflict ot interest.
Meanwhile, the University con
tinues to look at several other poten
tial development sites, although Vice
President tor Business and Finance
William Massy said earlier this year
that the University was "getting to
ward the end" of plans to expand the
physical plant here, a task begun in
the 19505.
Recently, he said, the University
has concentrated on the renovation
ot existing structures, such as the
Flistory Corner.
The city council will hold a special
public hearing tonight to consider
amendments to Palo Alto's com
prehensive planning report.
