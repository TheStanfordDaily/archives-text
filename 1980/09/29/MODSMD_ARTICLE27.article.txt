Iraq claims more gains in Iran oil lands
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq said yesterday its forces punched 50
miles inside Iran and were battling tor control of three major
cities in Iran's oil heartland.
Iran denied the Iraqi claims and said the Iranian air force was
attacking "enemy units that have penetrated into our beloved
homeland."
Iraqi President Saddam Flussein, in a broadcast on Baghdad
radio, said Iraq was willing to negotiate directly with Iran or
through a third party for a settlement which would return to
Arab control "every inch of usurped land," including three tiny
islands in the Strait of Hormuz seized by Iran from the United
Arab Emirates in 1971.
Iran says the concessions are unacceptable and is demanding
a total withdrawal ot Iraqi troops as a prerequisite to peace
talks.
Meanwhile Iran's news agency said Pakistani President
Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq, on a peace mission to Tehran and
Baghdad, left for the Iraqi capital after conferring twice with
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr about the border dis
pute. Tehran radio quoted Bani-Sadras saying, "our position is
that we will continue to fight until the last aggressor is driven
from our territory."
The U.N. Security Council met in New York and unanimously
adopted a resolution offered by Mexico calling on Iran and Iraq
to stop the fighting.
Israeli official hints at arms aid for tran
lerusalem — A high Israeli defense official said yesterday
Israel could give Iran enough military aid to enable it to "con
tinue its war against Iraq" — but only if there is a "turning
point" in the Iranian regime.
Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Zippori said in an inter
view with the Tel Aviv Daily Ma'ariv there would have to be a
change ot direction in what he called the "extremist Iranian
regime" before Israel would be willing to help Iran. Later yes
terday, the powerful defense and foreign affairs committee of
the Israeli Knesset voted that Israel should maintain "a low
profile" in relation to the Iraqi-Iranian war.
Aides said Prime Minister Menachem Begin agreed with the
low profile stance. Government officials were at a loss to say
immediately whether Zippori was speaking with the prime
minister's approval.

Since the resignation of Ezer Weizman as defense minister
last May, Zippori has been the highest-ranking Israeli defense
official except for Begin, who is also acting as defense minister.
The two men have recently been in disagreement over the
running ot the Ministry of Defense, and Begin was reportedly
close to asking for the deputy's resignation earlier in the
month.
Pentagon aims to upgrade mobile forces
Washington — Pentagon leaders, apparently stung by criti
cism that the Rapid Deployment Force promises too little too
late for the Persian Gulf, have launched an effort to beef up the
force in a hurry.
The Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps all have been
asked to submit proposals for improving the Rapid Deployment
Force, the umbrella name for a collection of existing military
units earmarked to be rushed to distant trouble spots.
Although Deputy Defense Secretary W. Graham Claytor di
rected the reappraisal before the Iran-Iraq war broke out, the
conflict has added impetus to the effort.
But high-ranking officers are apprehensive about this latest
request from their civilian superiors for ideas about spending
more on the RDF. They fear the money would come from
existing projects, to keep the total Pentagon budget down, and
not be made up later.
There is also a suspicion among many admirals and generals
these days that such sudden interest in spending more money
on defense is politically motivated and will not last.
Railroad strike halted after court order
San Francisco — Southern Pacific Railroad traffic on over 6500
miles of track in seven Western states headed back to normal
yesterday after locomotive engineers, under orders from a
judge, halted a surprise strike in protest of a mandatory sobri
ety test.
The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, representing the
2300 SP engineers who struck the system for 12 hours, re
sponded to a temporary restraining order issued Saturday by
U.S. District Judge William Ingram.
According to SPand other sources, about 40of the engineers
who showed up for work during the week refused to blow into
an "electronic gadget" which gives an instant readout on al
cohol in the blood. They were relieved of their shifts and sent

home, SP said.
The strike halted all of SP's freight and Amtrak service as well
as commuter service on the San Francisco peninsula.
Ingram ordered the disputing parties into his court Oct. 6 tor
a hearing on a permanent injunction.
Reagan criticizes Carter's war remark
Washington — Ronald Reagan says it was "unconscionable"
for President )immy Carter to imply that he would start a war if
elected president, and charges that Carter's "weak, inconsis
tent policies" themselves risk involving the United States in an
unwanted war.
Reagan, the Republican presidential nominee, yesterday re
sponded to Carter's "peace or war" campaign issue against his
challenger in a copyrighted interview in U.S. News & World
Report. In a companion interview with the magazine, the presi
dent defended his first-term record and disagreed with Reagan
on a wide range of issues.
In an apparent attempt to portray Reagan as a warmonger,
Carter last week said the Nov. 4 election "will determine . . .
whether we have peace or war."
Meanwhile, an NBC News Election Unit assessment says
Reagan is leading in 23 states with 191 electoral votes to Presi
dent Carter's lead in 14 states and the District of Columbia with
134 votes.
The assessment released yesterday listed Connecticut,
Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wis
consin as "toss-up states."
A total of 270 electoral votes are needed for election.
Warheads delayed by Dept. of Energy
Washington — "Technical problems" within the Energy De
partment's aging nuclear-weapons-building complex have
caused delays in delivery to the Air Force of a powerful new
warhead for the Minuteman 111 missile and a new bomb for the
B-52.
An advanced nuclear warhead for the Army's Lance missile,
which could be converted to a neutron warhead, also has been
delayed, according to previously secret information delivered
earlier this year to the Senate Armed Services Committee by
Undersecretary of Defense William Perry.
