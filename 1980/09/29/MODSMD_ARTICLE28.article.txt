sive registration campaign hy the

coordinator lor the youth voter re
gistration group, said the goal ot the
organization is to register 4000 mem

election, he or she must re-register.
Also, many students registered in
other counties or states can register
here to be eligible to vote on local
issues.

Parking fees
Inflationary costs and increased
Marguerite shuttle service have
raised this year's fees tor on-campus
parking permits.
The basic "C" permit, which cost
$15 last year, will now cost $20. The
"A" permits have increased from $50
to $75.
Parking permit fees have not been
increased for the past three years.
Alan Waterman, chairman ot the
University Committee on Parking
and Transportation, said the major
cost to the committee was the Mar
guerite service.
"We're looking very seriously at
how to improve it,"he said. "We
may hold a public meeting for ideas.
I'd like to get as much constructive
input as possible."
Waterman said there would be no
further increase in fees this year.
"Actually, it's almost at the level
where you can pay daily at the pay
lots and come out even," he said. "I
don't know it there will be a decrease
in the amount of stickers sold or not,
due to the increased rates."
