# From one level to another

Norman, Okla. — Though Paul
Wiggin has been away tor 25 years, it
took him less than half the season to
re-acquire the essence of Stanford
football: lose the little games and
win the big ones.
Long known for their ability to play
to the level ot their competition, the
Cardinals have proven it again this
year. They lost two Saturdays ago to
Boston College, which dropped a
20-9 decision to Villanova, not to be
contused with the popular ice cream
flavor.
Stanford crushed a supposedly
powerful Oklahoma team Saturday
31-14. The Cards never let speedy
quarterback lulius Caesar Watts un
track his legions of scatbacks
through the Stanford defense. It was
another case ot Julius Caesar biting
the dust.
Et tu, Brute.
Wiggin was hoarse from the ex
citement and the rain, but nonethe
less expressed his happiness with a
win that surely will boost Stanford
back into the Top Twenty.
"I like the way our guys responded
atter Boston College," Wiggin said.
"Before the game we talked about

playing one ot the great offenses in
c ollege football. When the wishbone
comes to mind, Oklahoma is the
standard. But we set the standard tor
out type of offense as well. We do
our thing the best we can do."
Stanford's thing seems to be
shooting down the tough guys of col
lege football. The miracle 21-21 tie
with USC last season cost the Tro|ans
the national championship. Satur
day's win will surely keep Oklahoma
from the top spot for another year.
All-America wide receiver Ken
Margerum poked a little post-game
fun at the Sooners.
"They elected to kick off in the tirst
half and give us the ball twice. When
we scored on the first drive of the
second half, it was a great feeling,"
Margerum said. "This was my
greatest day since I've been at Stan
ford. This and the 21-21 tie with
USC."
Offensive tackle Brian Holloway,
who cleared most of the traffic out of
the way for Mike Dotterer's and Vin
cent White's downfield jaunts,
thought Oklahoma was not prepared
for the Stanford attack.

"They seemed very surprised. We
came out to punish them. We played
super football," Holloway said.
Another ecstatic Card was (Quar
terback John Flway, whose brilliant
performance was truly too much for
the Sooners to handle.
I'm thrilled it happened," Elway

exulted. "It was the biggest thrill ot
my lite."
One of the biggest grins in the
locker room belonged to the man
who did not play. But Darrin Nelson
was as excited as his teammates.
"As long as we win, I don't care
whether I play or not. They (Dotterer
and White) never get to play. It was
their day."
Nelson said he knew on Thursday
he probably would not be able to
play. But tor once, he wasn't missed.
Maybe the most important lesson the
Stanford offense learned Saturday
was that they could win without No.
M. It must give the Cards an extra
shot of confidence.
More confidence must come from
bouncing back so quickly after the
beating the week before. As
linebacker Dave Morze put it, "We
controlled the line of scrimmage.
Last week they (Boston College)
were dictating what we were doing."
The only dictating done this week
was by Stanford. It you don't believe
it, just ask the fallen dictator, Mr.
Watts, Julius Caesar.
Et tu, Brute.

quarterback lulius Caesar Watts un
track his legions of scatbacks
through the Stanford defense. It was
another case ot Julius Caesar biting
the dust.
Et tu, Brute.
Wiggin was hoarse from the ex
citement and the rain, but nonethe
less expressed his happiness with a
win that surely will boost Stanford
back into the Top Twenty.
"I like the way our guys responded
atter Boston College," Wiggin said.
"Before the game we talked about

playing one ot the great offenses in
c ollege football. When the wishbone
comes to mind, Oklahoma is the
standard. But we set the standard tor
out type of offense as well. We do
our thing the best we can do."
Stanford's thing seems to be
shooting down the tough guys of col
lege football. The miracle 21-21 tie
with USC last season cost the Tro|ans
the national championship. Satur
day's win will surely keep Oklahoma
from the top spot for another year.
All-America wide receiver Ken
Margerum poked a little post-game
fun at the Sooners.
"They elected to kick off in the tirst
half and give us the ball twice. When
we scored on the first drive of the
second half, it was a great feeling,"
Margerum said. "This was my
greatest day since I've been at Stan
ford. This and the 21-21 tie with
USC."
Offensive tackle Brian Holloway,
who cleared most of the traffic out of
the way for Mike Dotterer's and Vin
cent White's downfield jaunts,
thought Oklahoma was not prepared
for the Stanford attack.

"They seemed very surprised. We
came out to punish them. We played
super football," Holloway said.
Another ecstatic Card was (Quar
terback John Flway, whose brilliant
performance was truly too much for
the Sooners to handle.
I'm thrilled it happened," Elway

exulted. "It was the biggest thrill ot
my lite."
One of the biggest grins in the
locker room belonged to the man
who did not play. But Darrin Nelson
was as excited as his teammates.
"As long as we win, I don't care
whether I play or not. They (Dotterer
and White) never get to play. It was
their day."
Nelson said he knew on Thursday
he probably would not be able to
play. But tor once, he wasn't missed.
Maybe the most important lesson the
Stanford offense learned Saturday
was that they could win without No.
M. It must give the Cards an extra
shot of confidence.
More confidence must come from
bouncing back so quickly after the
beating the week before. As
linebacker Dave Morze put it, "We
controlled the line of scrimmage.
Last week they (Boston College)
were dictating what we were doing."
The only dictating done this week
was by Stanford. It you don't believe
it, just ask the fallen dictator, Mr.
Watts, Julius Caesar.
Et tu, Brute.
