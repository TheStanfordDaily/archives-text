# The 						first three weeks

### 
Stanford 35, Oregon 25
Opening its season with a crucial
Pacific-10 Conference confrontation,
Stanford built a 21-0 lead with three
second-quarter touchdowns, one
each by )ohn Elway, Ken Margerum
and Darrin Nelson. However Oregon
stormed back late in the half to score
a TD and retained control of the
game heading into the fourth quar
ter. Midway through that period the
host Ducks trailed just 21-17, but
Nelson, playing in his first game
since 1978 after missing last season
with an injury, took a swing pass
from Elway and ran 52 yards to give
the momentum back to Stanford for
good. Nelson finished with 122 yards

rushing and 66 yards receiving — a
typical, vintage performance.
Stanford 19, Tulane 14
Nelson made the difference the
week before, and this time it was
Margerum's turn. The consensus
All-America receiver snatched five
passes for 86 yards and two
touchdowns, including a clutch 24-
yard grab with 38 seconds left to win
the game. Stanford also shone de
fensively. Reserves Jay Summers and
Craig Awbrey came off the bench to
combine for 16 tackles, and their ef
forts were complemented by the
work of inside linebackers Craig
Zellmer (nine tackles) and Dave
Morze (10tackles). The 14 points rep

resented the lowest scoring total by a
Cardinal opponent since last year's
30-10 triumph over Arizona.
Boston College 30, Stanford 13
Lowly-regarded Boston College,
playing before its second-largest
home crowd in history, physically
and emotionally outmatched Stan
ford. Both the Eagles' offensive and
defensive lines enjoyed marked size
advantage over the Cards, and as a
result pushed Stanford all over the
field. No less than 15 different Cards
came home with some sort of injury.
Head coach Paul Wiggin admitted
that Stanford wasn't quite as spirited
as Boston College, and several Eagle
players noted that Stanford indeed
did not appear over-inspired.
