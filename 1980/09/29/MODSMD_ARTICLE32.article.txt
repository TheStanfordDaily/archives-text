# USF and Eastern foes sabotage soccer's start
## 
### Steve Moe 
Using what coach Nelson
Lodge described as "USF
magic," the powerful Univer
sity of San Francisco soccer
team defeated Stanford 5-0
Soccer
Saturday before a large crowd
at Stanford Stadium.
The Dons, ranked number
two in the nation in the latest
issue of Soccer America, estab
lished control early in the game
and kept it throughout, scoring
the first goal four minutes into

the contest and tallying their
final goal with just a couple of
minutes left.
It was the "USF magic" — the
abilitytocapitalizeon thesmal
lest of advantages and exploit
any weaknesses in the opposi
tion's defense — that proved to
be the difference.
Stanford, although playing
well most of the time in mid
field and defense, often made
mistakes near the goal to spoil
good scoring opportunities.
The loss to USF gave Stan
ford a 3-5 record. The Cards

have beaten Brigham Young
(3-1), UC-Davis (1-0) and UOP
(8-0).
The other four losses came
during a six-day road trip that
took Stanford to the East Coast
in mid-September.
During that trip, Stanford
played four of the best teams in
New England — Brown, Con
necticut, Rhode Island and
Yale — losing 5-1, 7-0, 4-2 and
4-1 respectively.
However, these scores can
be misleading as Stanford was
"blown out" only once, to the
fifth-ranked team in the nation,
Connecticut.
Lodge, although obviously
disappointed with the scores,
said about the trip, "Playing
against such good teams has to
benefit us. We learned and
hope to use this knowledge to
help us beat the teams in our
own backyard."
UCLA, Santa Clara, San lose
State and California are some
of the teams in Stanford's
"backyard" that the Cards
hope to beat.
Junior Willie Guicci, leading
scorer last year with 20 goals, is
just now getting untracked
after dislocating his shoulder
the day before the season
opener.
Ted Ratalovich, also a junior,

is coming back strong after an
injury-plagued season last year
to look like the Ratalovich of
1978, the year in which he
scored a Stanford-record 28
goals.
Goalie is a strong position
with the Oregon sophomore
duo of Jeff Jones and Rob Hol
den, both of whom are begin
ning to gain the necessary ex
perience to do well in their
second season.
With an experienced de
fense led by sophomore Doug
Clark, senior Jim Witham and
some outstanding freshmen
such as Walter Kingson and
lorge Tittinger in the midtield,
the Cards definitely have
enough talent to win. In fact,
this year the team possibly has
the most depth of any Stanford
soccer team ever. It remains to
be seen if the talent can mix to

gether well and produce a
winning' team.
Lodge said, "It we win the
rest of our games, there is no
way anyone can keep us out ot
the regionals (the tirst round of
the soccer playoffs at the end
ot the season). Our season be
gins again against Westmont."
The game Saturday was tele
vised by ESPN, the national
cable sports channel. The good
crowd on hand was due in part
to an area youth soccer promo
tion. It was the second game ot
the year at the stadium and a
couple more are being consi
dered for later in the season.
Stanford goes after its fourth
win of the season against
Westmont College, a top
ranked Division II squad Wed
nesday at 2 p.m. at Harry
Malonev Field.

UCLA, Santa Clara, San lose
State and California are some
of the teams in Stanford's
"backyard" that the Cards
hope to beat.
Junior Willie Guicci, leading
scorer last year with 20 goals, is
just now getting untracked
after dislocating his shoulder
the day before the season
opener.
Ted Ratalovich, also a junior,

is coming back strong after an
injury-plagued season last year
to look like the Ratalovich of
1978, the year in which he
scored a Stanford-record 28
goals.
Goalie is a strong position
with the Oregon sophomore
duo of Jeff Jones and Rob Hol
den, both of whom are begin
ning to gain the necessary ex
perience to do well in their
second season.
With an experienced de
fense led by sophomore Doug
Clark, senior Jim Witham and
some outstanding freshmen
such as Walter Kingson and
lorge Tittinger in the midtield,
the Cards definitely have
enough talent to win. In fact,
this year the team possibly has
the most depth of any Stanford
soccer team ever. It remains to
be seen if the talent can mix to

gether well and produce a
winning' team.
Lodge said, "It we win the
rest of our games, there is no
way anyone can keep us out ot
the regionals (the tirst round of
the soccer playoffs at the end
ot the season). Our season be
gins again against Westmont."
The game Saturday was tele
vised by ESPN, the national
cable sports channel. The good
crowd on hand was due in part
to an area youth soccer promo
tion. It was the second game ot
the year at the stadium and a
couple more are being consi
dered for later in the season.
Stanford goes after its fourth
win of the season against
Westmont College, a top
ranked Division II squad Wed
nesday at 2 p.m. at Harry
Malonev Field.
