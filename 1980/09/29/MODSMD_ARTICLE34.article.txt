Cal now 0-3
The Associated Press
The Arizona Wildcats scored three
times in the fourth quarter, climaxing
with a 10-yard touchdown dash by
Hubert Oliver, in a dramatic 31-24
victory over California on Saturday.
The Wildcats, 1-1, turned back a
last-ditch rally by the Golden Bears as
Sam Giangardella recovered a Cal
fumble on the Arizona two yard line
with 1:19 to play.
All four Arizona touchdowns were
the product of turnovers — two in
terceptions of Rich Campbell passes
and two punt attempts by Mike Ahr
that went sour.
Cal took a 24-10 lead into the
fourth quarter, having scored on a
one-yard run by Dave Palmer, a
one-yard run by Campbell, a 13-yard
pass from Campbell to John Tuggle
and field goal by Mick Luckhurst.
Arizona's comeback began early in

the final period when Dave Liggins
grabbed an interception near mid
field. Two plays later, Wildcat quar
terback Mark Fulcher hit Bob Carter
with a 45-yard touchdown pass on
which Carter eluded two defenders
down the right side.
On the next series of plays, Bill
Kedman blocked Ahr's punt deep in
Cal territory, and Gary Gibson
scooped up the ball and went 15
yards to score the tying touchdown.
Arizona safety Reggie Ware
sparked the winning drive with an
interception and 38-yard runback to
the Cal 35. Six plays later, Oliver
bulled his way to the winning
touchdown.
Ducks goose Huskies
The Associated Press
Rich Brooks called it"the most im
portant" victory in his four seasons
as coach at the University of Oregon.

A beaten Don James of
Washington said he "never dreamed
it would be like this."
With quarterback Reggie Ogburn
running for two touchdowns and
passing for another Saturday, the
Ducks upset 13th-ranked
Washington 34-10.
Oregon isn't eligible to go to the
Rose Bowl and Washington —at least
before Saturday's loss — was consi
dered by many, including Brooks, as
the Pac:-10 Rose Bowl contender to
beat.
"Obviously," James said, "we're
not as good as people have been tel
ling us we are. That's the danger
when you start believing what
people tell you."
Ogburn accounted for 193 total
yards — 121 passing and 72 rushing.
Oregon trailed 10-6 at halftime, but
went ahead to stay on an eight-yard
touchdown pass from Ogburn to

Curtis Jackson early in the second
half. Oregon broke the game open
with three touchdowns in the fourth
quarter, two on Ogburn runs of one
and three yards.
Oregon improved its record to
2-1-1 and evened its conference mark
at 1-1. Washington dropped to 2-1 in
its Pac-10 opener.
