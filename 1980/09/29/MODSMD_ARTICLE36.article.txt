The Cards entered the tour
nament undefeated against in
terstate foes Ohio State, Ok
lahoma, Houston, Purdue and
Tennessee, and opened then
season September 14 with a
victory over cross-state oppo
nent UC-Riverside. The team's
overall record is now 10-3. At
this point last year, Stanford
was 7-b.
Fight schools participated in
the two-day tournament, di
vided into tour-team pools. In
the tirst day of competition

UOP took tirst place in its pool,
while Stanford battled to a 2-1
record.
The following day the Cards
earned a spot in the semi-finals
but were defeated there by
Cal-San Luis Obispo in two
straight games.
Stanford's next opponent,
Purdue, dropped two straight,
forcing a rematch against Cal
Poly. This time the Cards came
out on top in two games to pit
them against UOP for the
championship.
Sophomore hitter-blocker
Deanna Boyette garnered all
tournament honors for her
performance in the matches.
"Everybody played well. It
was definitely an outstanding
team performance," remarked
coach Fred Sturm.
This year's relatively young
team includes seven freshmen
and three sophomores on the
15-member roster. Pacing the
team are Boyette, junior setter
Jan Linden, junior setter Chris

Anderson and hitter-blocker
Sandy Harris, the squad s lone
senior.
Linden was named second
team All-Nor-Cal Conference
last year, while Ftarris was
honored as Stanford Athlete of
the Year in 1977.
Sturm pointed out that the
team's freshmen all possess
good backgrounds in funda
mentals, but need to learn
more about Stanford's style of
play.
"They're still in transition
(from high school to college
level), but they're playing re
ally well," he said.
The most heralded new re
cruits include high school Ail-
American Kari Rush of Balboa,
California, 1978 All-American
Margaret Grove of San Pedro
and Kerry Stuhr, an All-Stater
from Evergreen, Colorado.
This year's team faces more
out-of-state competition than
any previous team on the
Farm.

"We're using non
conference matches to look at
different people and combina
tions. To do well in the conter
encewe have to finish high, we
want everyone to plav best tor
the conference matches,"
Sturm noted.
He pointed out that the
mid-west schools are traveling
west in order to play the best
teams available. "It's definitely
good tor the sport ot vol
leyball, it makes the sport more
national. It's good tor the con
terence, it supports the teeling
that the NorCal Conference is
the strongest in the nation," htÂ»
said.
Providing the stiffest com
petition tor the Cards will be
UOP, ranked second in the na
tion; California, ranked in the
top 20 and fresno State, the
coach said.
Stanford was picked to finish
third or fourth in the confer
ence prior to the season.
