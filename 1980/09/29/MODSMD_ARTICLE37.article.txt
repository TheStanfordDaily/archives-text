# Ali-Holmes: who's in trouble?

Lis Vegas, Nev. (AP) —
"You're in trouble," Muham
mad All shouted at Larry
Holmes while the World Box
ing Council heavyweight
champion sparred.
The old master was psyching
another opponent, right?
Well, that's not the way
Holmes sees it.
"They say he's trying to
psych me," Holmes said yes
terday. "But he's trying to
psyche himself. Let me tell you
something: he lost all that
weight, but he ain't hard. He's
still got a lot of flab on him."
Ali chatters constantly about
how he's gotten down from 256
pounds to the low 220s for his
title bid against Holmes Thurs
day night at Caesars Palace —
his first fight in two years.
Some boxing people feel
that although the 38-year-old
Ali has lost weight he might not
be in fighting trim because of
the long layoff.
"That's a big drawback," said
Ken Norton, who fought Ali
three times and Holmes once,
"plus the tact that his fight
against Spinks wasn't that
good. He didn't do that
much."

Ali won the World Boxing
Association title by outpoint
ing Leon Spinks on Sept. 15,
1978.
The 30-year-old Holmes
knows the effect a long layoff

can have on a fighter. Fie dam
aged his right hand in outpoint
ing Roy Williams April 30,1976,
and didn't fight again until Jan.
16, 1977, when he outpointed
Tom Prater.

"When I retire I don't want
people coming up to me," said
Holmes. "I want to fade away.''
But he does not want to fade
away by losing to Ali.
