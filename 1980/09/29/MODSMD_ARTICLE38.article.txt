Receiving outstanding performances Irom
expected sources, both the men's and women's
cross country teams performed well at the
Fresno Invitational Meet last weekend.
For the men, junior Rod Berry paced a
second-place team finish for the Cardinals by
placing fourth individually with a 30:49 clocking
over the 10,000-meter course.
Kim Schnurpfeil, meanwhile, finished second
to nobqdy, winning the women's competition
with a 16:48.0 time over 5000 meters. The Card
women placed fourth overall.
Joining Berry in Stanford's top five were
freshman Jim Smith (31:01, eighth individually),
Tom O'Neal (31:14, 14th), Mike Melendez
(31:26, 17th) and Bill Graham (31:31, 19th).
Cross country
Men's coach Mike Tomasello said that the
runners' overall strong performance reflected
an improved, confident attitude. Only Nevada-
Reno posted a better team score than Stanford.
"We're very concerned with the distance

runners believing in themselves," Tomasello
said. "They seem to have done that very well.''
Berry's effort was hardly surprising. "He defi
nitely can be a strong Pac-10 performer," To
masello said. The coach also looks to rookie
Smith for continued excellence: "He's a 'blue
chipper' who we expect great things from."
Women's coach Laurel Treon noted that her
charges improved on their showing at Fresno
last year, when they placed fifth.
Treon added that Schnurpteil's victory
marked the first time the sophomore had beaten
Cal Poly-SLO's Maggie Keyes, a 1979 standout.
"Kim is believing in her ability now, which
allows her to extend herself that much more,"
Treon said.
Besides Schnurpfeil, Ellen Lions (17:15, sixth)
and Patti Sue Plumer (17:58,16 th) also ran well.
Lions is, in Treon's words, an "aggressive and
gutsy runner." Though she ran off the course at
one point, Lions, who held the lead for the first
I'/2-miles, retained her composure. "Most
people would fold right there," Treon ob
served.
