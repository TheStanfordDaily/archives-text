A man suspected of being the College Terrace rapist
was arrested in Pleasanton Sept. 5 alter nearly lOyears of
police investigation, according to the Palo Alto Police
Department.
Melvin Alfred Carter, a 35-year-old computer en
gineer, has been < harged with three of the cases of rape
committed in the College Terrace area.
According to the Peninsula Times-Tribune, Carter is
also suspected in at least 10 of 11 rapes occurring in the
area since 1970. The statute of limitations has expired on
most of the cases.
College Terrace is the residential neighborhood adja
cent to the south side of the University, along Stanford
Avenue.
The past attacks occurred in the homes of women who
lived alone in the College Terrace area. In all the as
saults, a man would enter in the early morning hours
through an unlocked door or window and shut off the
main electricity. He wore surgical gloves.
Most of the evidence of the investigation, including
statements Carter allegedly made to police following his
arrest, has been sealed from the public and the press.

Physical evidence taken in a Sept. 12 search of his home
and his office at Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical C om
pany is also sealed.
According to Santa Clara County District Attorney
Randy Hey, the seal will remain in effect until the pre
trial hearing on Oct. 12. Carter's attorney, Thomas No
lan, has filed a motion which would prevent all public
and press access to the hearing.
"There has been so much coverage in the media that
most people think he (Carter) is guilty and he hasn t
even had his pre-trial hearing yet," Nolan told the Penin
sula Times-Tribune.
At a pre-trial hearing, the prosecution tirst lays out its
case against the defendant.
Some items found during the searches, including a
Stanford student directory, blood-stained surgical
gloves and a distinctively shaped surgical kmte de
scribed by College Terrace victims, were released by the
Alameda County Superior Court.
Berkeley police have also charged Carter in connec
tion with nine rapes and one attempted rape since l ( ) H.
He will be arraigned there when Palo Alto's ( ase against
him is concluded.
