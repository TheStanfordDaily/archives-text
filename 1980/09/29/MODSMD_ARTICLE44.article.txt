# Freshman Huntington stars
## 
### 
The Stantord field hockey
team's 2-2 record is hardly ex
citing, but one of the squad's
newest players certainly is.
Freshman Patsy Huntington
scored seven goals in two
games Saturday to give the
Cardinals a pair of victories at
the Long Beach Invitational
Tournament.
In a 4-0 victory over
Washington State, Huntington
rammed home all four of Stan
ford's goals.
"It was really an extraordi
nary achievement," coach
Barbara Longstreth com

mented. "It's like a baseball
player hitting tour home runs
in a game.
"She's got a very, very quick
stick," Longstreth continued,
commenting on Huntington's
Field Hockey
style. "She has good ball con
trol in crowded areas — she
can place the ball very well."
Co-captain Kelly Wester
wick, a senior who has started
every game in her Stantord
career, assisted on two ot Hun
tington's goals.

Becky Howell's tally and
another Huntington goal gave
Stantord a 2-2 tie with Arizona
at the end of regulation play in
Saturday's second game. Hun
tington, however, settled mat
ters in overtime with two goals
to win it for the Cards, 4-2.
Claudia Cold contributed to
Stanford's cause with three as
sists.
The Cards began their sea
son with two losses, 5-0 to San
lose State and 2-0 to host Long
Beach State, the AIAVV champ
ions, in the tournament
opener Friday.
