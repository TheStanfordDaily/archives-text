Now 8-1 after a forfeit victory
over San lose State Saturday,
the Stanford water polo team
looks as though it's in for
another outstanding season.
Coming hack from a 23-5-1
Water Polo
showing last year and a third
place finish in the NCAA
championships, the Cards re
turn seven varsity players and
lose only one, Randy Kalbus.
The team started off the 1980
campaign on a promising note
in mid-September, downing a
strong Pepperdine team 7-5. It
was a come-trom-behind vic
tory for the Cards, who were
down 4-1 at the half. Stanford
coach Dante Dettamanti attri
butes the halftime deficit to the
fact that his team had not
played a game yet and that
Pepperdine had already played
five.
Next the team competed in
the UC-lrvine tournament,
held Sept. 19-21. Called "one
of the most prestigious tour
naments in the country" by De
ttamanti, the event featured
most of the top collegiate
water polo teams in the coun
try.
The Cards took second place
in the tournament, losing to
host UC-lrvine 7-3 in the final

game.
In the first match, Stanford
easily handled UC-Davis, win
ning 10-1. In the second game,
the Cards downed Cal State-
Fullerton, 7-4. Then they met
up with Pepperdine again, this
time winning b-5. Ihe Trojans
of USC were the Cards' next
opponent, and they were
dunked to the score of 5-3.

In the finals bracket, the
Cards first met UCLA, whom
they whipped 7-2, to move on
to meet California. The rival
Hears went down to defeat, this
time 7-5.
Then, after only 1 '/j hours
rest, the Cards played, and lost
to, the eventual champions,
UC-lrvine.
"We played the top two

teams in the country back-to
back there," Dettamanti said.
"We were just exhausted.
Looking ahead, Dettamanti
claimed his team has an excel
lent chance to win the NC AA
championship this year.
"Our team will be virtually
the same as last year," he said.
"Except the guys are hungrier
now."
