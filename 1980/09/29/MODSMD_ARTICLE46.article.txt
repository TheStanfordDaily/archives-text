# Carter focuses on energy issues

San |«se — President Jimmy
Carter came here last Tuesday
morning, and he had a good
time.
At least that's what he told a
crowd estimated at about 3500
in front of San Jose City Hall.
Saying that the entire coun
try "must learn from the ex
perience you have given the
nation," Carter praised the
technological innovations de
veloped in the Santa Clara Val
ley which he said will help
achieve a goal of energy inde
pendence for the United
States.
"This area, through the San
lose region, has been in the
forefront of the new
technologies that are so impor
tant to us all and I believe it's
the forerunner of what the rest
of the nation will be doing in
the months and years ahead,"
the president said.
The president spoke after
viewing an alternative energy
and conservation exhibit at city
hall. The remarks to the crowd
outside focused almost en
tirely on energy.
Carter said that fighting bet
ween Iran and Iraq in the oil
rich Persian Gulf region "is a
vivid demonstration ... of the
importance of our developing
alternative energy resources
and being extremely effective
in conserving what energy we
have."
Air Force One arrived at the
San Jose Municipal Airport at
9:14 a.m. The president was
greeted there by San Jose
Mayor Janet Gray Hayes and a

host of local energy executives
and political figures, including
Palo Alto Vice Mayor and Uni
versity Law Prof. Byron Sher.
Warning
The president gave a brief
statement about develop
ments in the Iran-Iraq confron
tation, calling for a prompt and
peaceful solution to the hos
tilities and warning the Soviet
Union not to interfere with the
fighting.
The presidential entourage
proceeded to City Hall, where
Carter met with area leaders in
the solar and alternative
energy fields, then toured the
energy exhibit.
He emerged into the crowd
and spent several minutes smil
ing and shaking hands with
spectators. The president
began his speech, which cited
the progress his administration
had made in battling the
energy problem.
"Industrial change is inevit
able, and it is good. We are an
innovative, pioneer-spirited
people, and we are not afraid
of change," he said.
Savings welcomed
The president did have
praise for Americans' conser
vation efforts, saying that the
country was importing two
million barrels of foreign oil
less per day this year than last.
He also commended the in
crease of domestic gasohol
production, which will be up
from 135 million barrels this
year to a projected figure of 500
million in 1981.
But loudest cheers for the
president were reserved not

for the subject of energy, but
of military preparedness. Prais
ing administration efforts to
keep the nation "strong" and
"at peace," Carter received
loud applause for his assertion
that "as president, I have not
been required, and I pray to
God I will not be required, in
the next five years, to send a
single American soldierto war.
"The best weapons are those
never required in battle, and
the best soldiers are those who
never shed blood on the
battlefield."
Reaction
Carter was greeted by some
picketers, including a small but
vocal number from the

Socialist Workers' Party and a
larger number of people hold
ing aloft "Reagan for Presi
dent" banners. A few held
specifically anti-Carter ban
ners, which included phrases
such as "Lillian says not to lie"
and "Co Home Peanut Man."
Reaction to the speech was
moderate in tone, many calling
it a "decent" but not outstand
ing address. "It's hard to
judge," commented one man.
"His figures about productivity
and employment were impres
sive, but I hardly know if
they're all accurate." Others
called it "campaign rhetoric,"
but said the figures were prob
ably justified.

Many people appeared to
have watched the tirst debate
between Carter's two major
opponents in the November
election, Republican Ronald
Reagan and Independent )ohn
Anderson, and most said that
while they wished Carter had
been present to debate as well,
it probably was "to his political
advantage" to stay away.
The energy exhibit at City
Hall focused on a number of
solar energy projects, includ
ing a display about the Santa
Clara Community Recreation
Center, one of the first build
ings in the nation to be both
heated and cooled by direct
use of solar power.
