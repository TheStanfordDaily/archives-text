# Reagan pushes his economic plans

Sunnyvale â€” Ronald Reagan,
making a campaign swing
through the Santa Clara Valley
last Thursday, lambasted the
Carter administration's
economic record and ottered
proposals to "put the nation
back to work again," reduce in
flation and streamline the fed
eral government.
Reagan's visit to the area,
often called Silicon Valley be
cause of its many high
technology firms, was the sec
ond bya presidential candidate
in a week. President jimmy
Carter made a whistle stop ap
pearance in San Jose Tuesday.
Reagan's campaign received
a boost when U.S. Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park),
who has had sharp policy dis
agreements with Reagan in the
past, formally endorsed the
Reagan-Bush ticket.
In a prepared speech before
30(30 people at Western Electric
Company's regional headquar
ters in Sunnyvale, Reagan
blamed Carter's "failure of vis
ion" in designing programs for
the nation for current high in
flation and unemployment
rates.
Calling productivity one of
the nation's chief concerns,
Reagan called for "predictable
government programs to let
business grow and expand."
He said such programs would
end a six-month downturn in
U.S. productivity.
Reagan called specifically for
a streamlined patent process,
an increase in business in
vestment incentives and a re
duction of federal regulation to

help business.
"Unless productivity is in
creased, he asserted, "|obs
tor semi-skilled and unskilled
workers will vanish or will not
be created at all."
The crowd, sprinkled with
pro-ERA and pro-abortion
placards, responded most en
thusiastically when Reagan
pledged a 10 percent cut in
federal income tax increases in
each of the first three years of
his administration.
To make this tax cut possi
ble, Reagan said his administ
ration would "cut, squeeze
and trim" the federal budget,
reducing expenditures by 2
percent in 1981, 4 percent in
1982 and 5 percent in 1983.
He asserted his economic
program, which he said has
been endorsed by a cross
section of the nation's
economists, will balance the
budget by 1982 while increas
ing defense spending.
Reagan acknowledged his
program would not end tax in
creases, but would only reduce
the increase planned by the
Carter administration.
Reagan responded to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's claim that
large tax cuts would be in
flationary by asking the crowd,
"Why is it not inflationary for
the government to keep and
spend the people's earnings
and it is inflationary to let the
people keep and spend their
earnings?"
The former governor of
California concluded Ameri
cans can solve the problems of
the country if the government
is "kept off their backs."
