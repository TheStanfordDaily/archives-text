# KZSU tightens security in wake of summer assault in station
## 
### Samuel Howe 
An assault on a K/SU staff member
in the offices of the student-operated
radio station late last month appa
rently forced the station to shut
down for the first two weeks of Sep
tember.
Although a shutdown had previ
ously been proposed to facilitate
overdue reorganization, studio work
and security improvements, i; would
not have occurred if the assault had
not taken place, according to K/SU
program director Michael Moroney.
Moroney said the incident, in
which two non-students dealt KZSU
Sports Director Steve Sherman facial
contusions requiring hospital care,
was the "straw that broke the camel's
back" in considerations of the shut
down.
Council ot Presidents member
Dayna Cioldfine, who also attended
the meeting called by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons, said the
shutdown gave K/SU "an excellent
chance to rebuild and repair prob
lems" in its operation.
Goldfine also said the University
will have to "keep tabs" on K/SU
until definite security measures are
taken by the station to prevent
further incidents similar to the as
sault.
lor the time being, said Moroney,
non-students will not be allowed in
the offices of K/SU unless they hold
"extremely important positions" at
the station. A small number have
been cleared through Lyons and the
COP on this basis, he said.
In addition, new locks were instal
led at K/SU three (fays after the as
sault to prevent entry by those who
held keys over the summer.
Appointment approval
Until a permanent policy is
adopted, any K/SU appointment ot a
non-student must be approved
through the COP and Lyons. It ap
pears probable K/SU will create a
board of directors, with specified ac
countability to the University, to
make appointments in the future.
Sin h decisions have traditionally
been made by a vote of the entire
radio staff.

According to Sherman, K/SU has
attempted to broadcast 24 hours a
day, "around the calendar year," tor
the past five years.
During the school year, with many
students staffing the station, very few
non-students work at the station,
Sherman said. However, during the
summer, more non-students work at
K/SU to fill the station's needs.
Vulnerable
Sherman and Moroney admitted
this practice makes the station more
vulnerable to security violations dur
ing the summer.
According to Sherman, the chain
of events leading to the assault on
the night of Aug. 26, began with a
verbal disagreement at the station
between himself and a man who
worked as a disc jockey over the
summer.
The man, who went by a radio
name of Roscoe T. Peabody, was in
the office when two friends entered
the station looking for him. Sherman
said he was not aware Peabody had
worked for the station that summer.
Because it appeared the three had
"no work to do or official business in
the station at that time," he asked
them to leave.
"I was trying to get a newscast on
the air, and they were making them
selves a nuisance," Sherman said.
The three refused to leave, and
Sherman called University Police
Services.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of Police Services, "three of
ficers came, talked to both parties,
determined who was supposed to be
there and asked the other folks to
leave."
Two charged
In the course of their visit, the of
ficers determined there was a war
rant on the vehicles of the two men
with Peabody. 1 hey were taken to jail
and charged, while one of the offic
ers remained until Peabody was
picked up by another friend.
About 30 minutes later, according
to police reports and Sherman's ac
count, two other men entered the
K/SU offices. These men "had never
been into K/SU before, to my know

ledge," said Sherman. "I noted the
fact that they were in the station,
then went back to work."
Although there is no evidence,
both Sherman and Moroney conjec
tured the men entered with a key
borrowed from somebody on the
KZSU staff.
This was 10 minutes before Sher
man was scheduled to go on the air
with a 10 p.m. newscast. The two
men walked into the newsroom, and
engaged in what Sherman called "i
dle chatter."
In the middle of the conversation,
one of the two men hit Sherman in
the nose. The assault continued for
about 30 seconds, according to
Sherman.
By 10 p.m., station members had
called for an ambulance. Paramedics
and a police officer arrived shortly
thereafter, and Sherman was taken
to Stanford Hospital, where he was
treated and released five hours later.
No new leads
Herrington said there are no new
leads on the identification of the as
sailants. Two men matching a de
scription given by Sherman were
picked up the same night in Menlo
Park, but later released for insuffi
cient evidence, Herrington said.
Moroney said he reached Peabody
on the phone after the incident, and
that "Peabody apologized for the
conduct of two of his friends" and for
the trouble it had caused KZSU.
Moroney also said Peabody claimed
"what had happened was not sup
posed to happen."
K/SU Production Manager Daryl
Davis, who was present at the station
at the time of the incident, said "as a
witness, I would say it stretches
beyond the bounds of credibility to
say that two guys came in at andom
and beat up (Sherman)."
Peabody was unavailable tor
comment. His actual name or ad
dress were not available from K/SU,
Lyons' office, or police services.

his office following the in( ident. but
that Peabody had been out when he

ing the summer.
According to Sherman, the chain
of events leading to the assault on
the night of Aug. 26, began with a
verbal disagreement at the station
between himself and a man who
worked as a disc jockey over the
summer.
The man, who went by a radio
name of Roscoe T. Peabody, was in
the office when two friends entered
the station looking for him. Sherman
said he was not aware Peabody had
worked for the station that summer.
Because it appeared the three had
"no work to do or official business in
the station at that time," he asked
them to leave.
"I was trying to get a newscast on
the air, and they were making them
selves a nuisance," Sherman said.
The three refused to leave, and
Sherman called University Police
Services.
According to Marvin Herrington,
director of Police Services, "three of
ficers came, talked to both parties,
determined who was supposed to be
there and asked the other folks to
leave."
Two charged
In the course of their visit, the of
ficers determined there was a war
rant on the vehicles of the two men
with Peabody. 1 hey were taken to jail
and charged, while one of the offic
ers remained until Peabody was
picked up by another friend.
About 30 minutes later, according
to police reports and Sherman's ac
count, two other men entered the
K/SU offices. These men "had never
been into K/SU before, to my know

ledge," said Sherman. "I noted the
fact that they were in the station,
then went back to work."
Although there is no evidence,
both Sherman and Moroney conjec
tured the men entered with a key
borrowed from somebody on the
KZSU staff.
This was 10 minutes before Sher
man was scheduled to go on the air
with a 10 p.m. newscast. The two
men walked into the newsroom, and
engaged in what Sherman called "i
dle chatter."
In the middle of the conversation,
one of the two men hit Sherman in
the nose. The assault continued for
about 30 seconds, according to
Sherman.
By 10 p.m., station members had
called for an ambulance. Paramedics
and a police officer arrived shortly
thereafter, and Sherman was taken
to Stanford Hospital, where he was
treated and released five hours later.
No new leads
Herrington said there are no new
leads on the identification of the as
sailants. Two men matching a de
scription given by Sherman were
picked up the same night in Menlo
Park, but later released for insuffi
cient evidence, Herrington said.
Moroney said he reached Peabody
on the phone after the incident, and
that "Peabody apologized for the
conduct of two of his friends" and for
the trouble it had caused KZSU.
Moroney also said Peabody claimed
"what had happened was not sup
posed to happen."
K/SU Production Manager Daryl
Davis, who was present at the station
at the time of the incident, said "as a
witness, I would say it stretches
beyond the bounds of credibility to
say that two guys came in at andom
and beat up (Sherman)."
Peabody was unavailable tor
comment. His actual name or ad
dress were not available from K/SU,
Lyons' office, or police services.

his office following the in( ident. but

An assault on a K/SU staff member
in the offices of the student-operated
radio station late last month appa
rently forced the station to shut
down for the first two weeks of Sep
tember.
Although a shutdown had previ
ously been proposed to facilitate
overdue reorganization, studio work
and security improvements, i; would
not have occurred if the assault had
not taken place, according to K/SU
program director Michael Moroney.
Moroney said the incident, in
which two non-students dealt KZSU
Sports Director Steve Sherman facial
contusions requiring hospital care,
was the "straw that broke the camel's
back" in considerations of the shut
down.
Council ot Presidents member
Dayna Cioldfine, who also attended
the meeting called by Dean of Stu
dent Affairs lames Lyons, said the
shutdown gave K/SU "an excellent
chance to rebuild and repair prob
lems" in its operation.
Goldfine also said the University
will have to "keep tabs" on K/SU
until definite security measures are
taken by the station to prevent
further incidents similar to the as
sault.
lor the time being, said Moroney,
non-students will not be allowed in
the offices of K/SU unless they hold
"extremely important positions" at
the station. A small number have
been cleared through Lyons and the
COP on this basis, he said.
In addition, new locks were instal
led at K/SU three (fays after the as
sault to prevent entry by those who
held keys over the summer.
Appointment approval
Until a permanent policy is
adopted, any K/SU appointment ot a
non-student must be approved
through the COP and Lyons. It ap
pears probable K/SU will create a
board of directors, with specified ac
countability to the University, to
make appointments in the future.
Sin h decisions have traditionally
been made by a vote of the entire
radio staff.

According to Sherman, K/SU has
attempted to broadcast 24 hours a
day, "around the calendar year," tor
the past five years.
During the school year, with many
students staffing the station, very few
non-students work at the station,
Sherman said. However, during the
summer, more non-students work at
K/SU to fill the station's needs.
