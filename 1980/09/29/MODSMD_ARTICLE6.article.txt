## Profs and students here dispute Soviet role in war 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
As Iran and Iraq enter a second week of fight
ing today, the conflict of opinions about the war
is just getting under way at Stantord.
Three weeks of border skirmishes erupted
into a war last Monday as Iraq laid claim to Shatt
al Arab, a disputed waterway dividing the two
Persian Gulf states. Iran's main oil refinery
at Abadan was closed by rocket fire and the
nearby village of khorramshahr is under seige
by ground and air forces. Although most of the
fighting has been on Iranian soil, the Iranians did
strike a retaliatory blow by bombing Iraq's oil
refinery at Basra.
Experts here agree more about the causes of
the war and about the military strengths of each
country than they do about the possible results
ot the conflict. In particular, they dispute what
role the Soviet Union will play in the war.
Peter Duignan, director of the Africa and
Middle East programs at the Hoover Institution,
said Friday that three motives exist for the Iraqi
push into Shatt al Arab.
"First, they want to rectify what they perceive
as a bad treaty in which they were forced to give
up half of Shatt al Arab to a then-stronger Iran
under the shah," he said.
Second, he said, Iraq seeks to attain a domin
ant position in the Persian Gulf region and"it
has a very good chance with Iran out of the
way."
Finally, the Iraqi government, under the lead
ership of Saddam Hussein and a Sunni Moslem
elite, seeks to "counter any potential Shiite re
bellion in Iraq." Duignan said Shiite Moslems
account for more than half of Iraq's population.
In recent weeks, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the Shiite leader of Iran's revolution, has called
on Iraqi Shiites to rebel.
Duignan said the Soviet Union will be the real
victor of the war, with Iraq slated to win any
conflict with its superior military forces. The
Iraqis used Soviet-made MiG-25 jets and other
sophisticated equipment in fighting the Iranians
last week. "The Soviets are going to get an ally,"
Duignan said.
Hubert Marshall, professor of political sci
ence, disagreed. "I don't think the Russians au

tomatically win anything if Iraq gain>> the land,'
he said.
Marshall cited the reaction by the Soviet
Union late last week ot Iraqi pleas tor more
armaments. He said that the Iraqis are proof that
what a country says is often not the same as what
it does. Although Iraq is a radical Marxist state
supporting the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and is a vocal opponent of United States
policies, it still sells its oil to the West "because
that's where the market is," he said.
Duignan and Marshall agree, however, on at
least three points:
—That Iraq holds superior military strength,
especially now that Iran's forces are suffering
from desertions and a scarcity of supplies and
technicians to operate sophisticated armor
purchased from the United States when the
shah still ruled Iran.
—That the war is likely to be a short one last
ing no more than two or three weeks. "Modern
warfare consumes armor at a very fast rate,"
Duignan said.
—That the United States cannot and should
not play a role in the conflict.
President limmy Carter endorsed this view
last week calling on all countries to stay outside
the conflict.
Iranian students here claim that this en
dorsement does not reflect the true interests or
intent of the American government.
"The United States wants a separate oil state
in Kuzhistan (the disputed area)," said one Ira
nian student. Sitting outside Tresidder Union
for a noontime lunch, Iranian students discus
sed the latest crisis to beset their homeland.
They declined to give their names.
"It's really cold between Iraq and the Soviet
Union," another said. "Iraq hanged all its com
munists three years ago."
The Iranians claimed that although Iraq
purchased its armaments from the Soviets, the
United States is responsible for the war by giving
the Iraqis "moral support."
They said that despite Iraqi military strength,
Iran will not be defeated. "You can't break
people when they have a good cause," said one.

for a noontime lunch, Iranian students discus
sed the latest crisis to beset their homeland.
They declined to give their names.
"It's really cold between Iraq and the Soviet
Union," another said. "Iraq hanged all its com
munists three years ago."
The Iranians claimed that although Iraq
purchased its armaments from the Soviets, the
United States is responsible for the war by giving
the Iraqis "moral support."
They said that despite Iraqi military strength,
Iran will not be defeated. "You can't break
people when they have a good cause," said one.
As Iran and Iraq enter a second week of fight
ing today, the conflict of opinions about the war
is just getting under way at Stantord.
Three weeks of border skirmishes erupted
into a war last Monday as Iraq laid claim to Shatt
al Arab, a disputed waterway dividing the two
Persian Gulf states. Iran's main oil refinery
at Abadan was closed by rocket fire and the
nearby village of khorramshahr is under seige
by ground and air forces. Although most of the
fighting has been on Iranian soil, the Iranians did
strike a retaliatory blow by bombing Iraq's oil
refinery at Basra.
Experts here agree more about the causes of
the war and about the military strengths of each
country than they do about the possible results
ot the conflict. In particular, they dispute what
role the Soviet Union will play in the war.
Peter Duignan, director of the Africa and
Middle East programs at the Hoover Institution,
said Friday that three motives exist for the Iraqi
push into Shatt al Arab.
"First, they want to rectify what they perceive
as a bad treaty in which they were forced to give
up half of Shatt al Arab to a then-stronger Iran
under the shah," he said.
Second, he said, Iraq seeks to attain a domin
ant position in the Persian Gulf region and"it
has a very good chance with Iran out of the
way."
Finally, the Iraqi government, under the lead
ership of Saddam Hussein and a Sunni Moslem
elite, seeks to "counter any potential Shiite re
bellion in Iraq." Duignan said Shiite Moslems
account for more than half of Iraq's population.
In recent weeks, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
the Shiite leader of Iran's revolution, has called
on Iraqi Shiites to rebel.
Duignan said the Soviet Union will be the real
victor of the war, with Iraq slated to win any
conflict with its superior military forces. The
Iraqis used Soviet-made MiG-25 jets and other
sophisticated equipment in fighting the Iranians
last week. "The Soviets are going to get an ally,"
Duignan said.
Hubert Marshall, professor of political sci
ence, disagreed. "I don't think the Russians au

tomatically win anything if Iraq gain>> the land,'
he said.
Marshall cited the reaction by the Soviet
Union late last week ot Iraqi pleas tor more
armaments. He said that the Iraqis are proof that
what a country says is often not the same as what
it does. Although Iraq is a radical Marxist state
supporting the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and is a vocal opponent of United States
policies, it still sells its oil to the West "because
that's where the market is," he said.
Duignan and Marshall agree, however, on at
least three points:
—That Iraq holds superior military strength,
especially now that Iran's forces are suffering
from desertions and a scarcity of supplies and
technicians to operate sophisticated armor
purchased from the United States when the
shah still ruled Iran.
—That the war is likely to be a short one last
ing no more than two or three weeks. "Modern
warfare consumes armor at a very fast rate,"
Duignan said.
—That the United States cannot and should
not play a role in the conflict.
President limmy Carter endorsed this view
last week calling on all countries to stay outside
the conflict.
Iranian students here claim that this en
dorsement does not reflect the true interests or
intent of the American government.
"The United States wants a separate oil state
in Kuzhistan (the disputed area)," said one Ira
nian student. Sitting outside Tresidder Union
