# Communist party gains strength
## Italian coalition government falls 
### 
Rome (Agence France-Presse) â€” Italy's
40th government since World War II fell
Saturday at a time of mounting tension.
Sporadic terrorist attacks continue and
the bombing of the Bologna railroad sta
tion that killed 84 on Aug. 2 is not yet
solved. Inflation is runningat2opercent. A
general strike has been called for Oct. 2 to
protest Fiat Motor Company's plan to lay
off 15,000 workers because of the
economic crisis.
The resignation of Premier Francesco
Cossiga marked a setback in the effort to
govern without the cooperation of the big
Italian Communist Party.
Cossiga's five-month-old coalition of
Christian Democrats, Socialists and Re
publicans had been trying vainly for three
months to get Parliament to adopt an
emergency law to fight inflation and stimu
late industry.
In a first move to cool the crisis, Fiat, the
automobile manufacturer which is the
largest enterprise in Italy, postponed
plans to dismiss almost 15,000 workers, a
move that had brought a militant response
from the nation's Communists in challeng
ing the dismissals and supporting the
workers.
The defeat was a stunning surprise for
the government, voted into power last
April in a move that re-established an al
liance between the dominant Christian

Democratic Party and the Socialists, the
No. 3 party of the nation.
Cossiga had survived an earlier vote
Saturday, but defeat came when a call was
made for a secret ballot, and at least 30
deputies from the parties of the coalition
government deserted the ranks. The gov
ernment needed two votes to reverse the
negative position. But two deputies with
those votes entered Parliament just as the
voting was closed. The final tally was 298
against the government, 297 in favor.
The desertion of party members on the
ballot was taken as an indication of the
relative weakness of the coalition.
The reforms that fell in the vote had
been hailed by Italy's European Common
Market partners last July as important
steps in the struggle to control inflation,
and reanimate the flagging economv.
The Communist Party, No. 2 in the na
tion with 30 percent of Parliament, now
will move again to seek entry into the gov
ernment and to block any moves that
might increase the already high national
unemployment.
President Sandro Pertini was in Hong
Kong, after a visit to China, when the vote
came in Parliament. He immediately can
celed plans for a visit to Jordan, to the
evident relief of staff members who were
concerned about his safety in that area on
the fringe of the Iran-Iraq war. Pertini re

turned here yesterday to open negotia
tions for a new government, the 41st since
World War 11.
The government that fell was the second
led by Cossiga. The first had survived
seven months, more than a month longer
than the second.
There was jubilation on the floor of the
Assembly among Communists, and other
toes of the government, when the unex
pected vote results were read by Nilde
Jotti, the Communist who is president of
the Assembly. She found it futile to ring
the bell for order as the demonstration
continued.
The outlook in democratic Italy's 40th
cabinet crisis is confused. The only new
element is that the Social Democrats,
backed by 3.8 percent of voters in the last
election, have hinted they might leave the
opposition and join the weak left-of
center coalition that was toppled Satur
day.
Benedetto Craxi, head of the Socialist
Party, who had been an architect of the
new coalition combining Christian Demo
crats, Socialists and the tiny Republican
Party, was harsh in his criticism of those
whom he said stooped to the "worst pos
sible parliamentary maneuver" to "raise
the spirit of factions" in Parliament just
when real progress in economic reform
was being made.
