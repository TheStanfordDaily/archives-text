# 'Gang of Four' radicals to be tried
## 
### 
Beijing (Agence France-
Presse) — The "Gang of Four"
radicals led by Jiang Qing,
widow of the late Mao Zedong,
will be publicly prosecuted
soon along with other
"counter-revolutionaries" by
the Chinese Supreme People's
Procuratorate, the New China
News Agency (NCNA) re
ported Saturday.
The annoucement made by
Chief Procurator of the Sup
reme People's Procuratorate
Huang Hoqing was seen as the
first official acknowledgement
that the trial of the disgraced
"Gang of Four" is imminent.
Jiang Qing, arrested in Oc
tober 1976 after the death of

Party Chairman Mao Zedong,
and her "Gang of Four" as
sociates 7hang Chunqiao, Yao
Wenyuan and Wang Hon
gwen, were reported to be
among the 10 main defendants
at the upcoming trial.
Huang said prosecution
would be directed against the
"revolutionary cliques" of
former Defense Minister Lin
Biao and Jiang Qing.
The other defendants were
identified as Chen Boda,
Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian,
Lt. Zuopeng, Qiu Huizuo and
)ang Tengjiao.
NCNA gave no date for the
trial nor did it specify whether
all the accused would be tried
by the same court.
Of the six figures to go on
trial with the "Gang of Four,"
Chen Boda is Mao Zedong's
former secretary while the
other five are all former gener
als.
The chief prosecutor's an
nouncement of the imminent
trial was made before the
standing committee of the Na
tional People's Congress,
NCNA said.
Huang proposed that a spe
cial court and a special pro

curatorate be set up to handle
the case in view of its serious
ness. Besides the 10, he said
the other accused in the case
would be tried separately — an
indication observers said im
plied Mao's nephew, Mao
Yuanxin, and other figures
who disappeared following the
"great helmsman's" death.
Implicitly confirming that
these figures were all living, he
said that legal proceedings
would not be instituted against
former leaders who are now
dead.
This clarification specifically
points to Lin Biao who is be
lieved to have died in a plane
crash while trying to flee to the
Soviet Union after an abortive
plot against Mao on September
13, 1971, according to the offi
cial accounts.
On October 7 it will be four
years since the main associates
of Jiang Qing, 66, were put be
hind bars after Chairman Hua
Guofeng— Mao's successor —
moved against them.
The Gang is charged with
having plotted to seize power
and oust its opponents.

It was a year ago that Chair
man Hua announced the
"Gang of Four" would be tried.
He stressed at the time that
they would not be sentenced
to death.
Unofficial Chinese sources
indicated that the trial was de
layed recently because of Jiang
Qing's alleged refusal to con
fess the charges against her.
The trial is likely to question
the historic role of Mao him
self, especially during the Cul
tural Revolution, observers
said. His nephew, Mao Yuan
xin, arrested in the crackdown
on the Gang's followers in
1976, also should be listed
among the defendants in the
other trials announced by
Huang.
Vice Chairman Deng Xiaop
ing, who became the most
powerful man in post-Mao
China, has carefully and re
lentlessly orchestrated the so
called "demaoisation" of the
regime.
Deng has made it clear that
foreign journalists would not
be allowed to attend the trial in
view of the state secrets which
might be divulged.
