Salisbury (Agence France-Presse) — A white
woman shot and killed a black former guerrilla
Friday night in Zimbabwe's Goromonzi area,
northeast of Salisbury, where roaming ex
insurgents have been attacking white-owned
farms since they left camp earlier in the week.
It was the second death of the week at
Goromonzi, and the first slaying of a former
guerrilla by a civilian since the end of the Rhode
sian war nine months ago. On Thursday, Christ
opher lohnson, 26, a white farmer, was gunned
down by five men believed to be ex-guerrillas
loyal to Prime Minister Robert Mugabe.
A police spokesman said two white women
were alone in a Goromonzi farmhouse Friday
night when they saw armed men inside the sec
urity fence. The intruders fired, the spokesman
said, and the women returned fire, hitting one
of the men as they fled. Police followed a trail of
blood to the body, the spokesman said.
Mugabe has promised Goromonzi farmers

that an estimated 2000 guerrillas camped on two
area farms, owned by his Zimbabwe African Na
tional Union-Patriotic Front, will be removed to
military bases. He also has ordered that they be
disarmed.
Reports from Goromonzi say that most of the
former guerrillas have returned to the farms but
about3oformerarmed insurgents are still on the
loose.
Whites at Goromonzi, who had put down
their weapons after the war, are again arming
themselves. But a farmer's wife said she was
warned by insurgents not to carry her pistol
because she ran the risk of being "taken out."
Most of the 32,000 former guerrillas who are
left in the assembly places, followers of either
Mugabe or Home Affairs Minister Joshua
Nkomo in the war against white-minority rule,
are soon to be moved to black townships on the
outskirts of Salisbury and Bulawayo, Zim
babwe's leading cities.
