"No lecture on 'What is it like to be a teacher' can begin to compare with
actually getting out and teaching. Alumni with whom I talk cannot believe
that I am getting the opportunity to teach and find out before (rather than
after) graduate school whether it is right for me. 1 just wish that there were
comparable 'experience' programs in other fields. Then college would truly
be the place where one is prepared for the real world.''
The "experience' program this student is describing is U.P.S.E., the UNDERGRADUATE
PROGRAM IN THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION.
The School of Education at Stanford University is a graduate school. As a professional school
it has consistently been ranked by outside judges as foremost in this nation in its research and
graduate training. Now it is possible for undergraduates who are interested in questions of
educational policy and practice to test their ideas and talents in a variety of educational
opportunities within neighboring institutions and local schools while earning Stanford University
credit for supervised teaching, tutoring, projects and internships.
Through U.P.S.E. students:
• taught a brain-damaged 13-year-old how to add, subtract, multiply and divide
• helped terminal patients with art therapy at Stanford Children's Hospital
• taught a 10-year-old Spanish-speaking boy to read (he had never attended a school)
• worked as teacher aides in a junior high school in a low-income neighborhood
In addition, undergraduates did sponsored research on a number of educational subjects.
