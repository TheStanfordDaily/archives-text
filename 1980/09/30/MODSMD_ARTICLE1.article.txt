# No compromise seen in Mideast conflict
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
All along the West Bank of the
Shatt al Arab River, across a desert of
salt mines and wild donkeys, Iraq
moved men, missiles and artillery
yesterday, setting up for new battles
with the stubborn Iranian defenders
of the oil center of Abadan.
In Iraq's main port of Basra, two of
Iran's U.S.-made Phantom jets
sc reamed in for a high-noon bomb
ing run on a strategic bridge. They
missed, but one of the four 250-
pound bombs they dropped de
stroyed an Iraqi ship moored at Sin
bad Island, according to legend the
home port of Sinbad, the storied
Arab sailor of the medieval seas.
And 50 miles to the north, around
the Iranian industrial city of Ahwaz,
Iraqi and Iranian artillery batteries
dueled for the town —which neither
fully controlled.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said yesterday that his army "has
reached its goals." But on the
ground, his claim looked hollow,
and there was no sign of a halt in the
fighting.
The Iraqis have inflicted punishing
blows on the Iranians. They have de
stroyed iarge parts of Iran's vital oil
installations and advanced almost 50
miles into Iranian territory, to the
outskirts of Ahwaz.
Flaming ruins
With its major oil installations in
flaming rums, Iran's alreadv faltering
economy may have been dealt a
crippling blow in its eight-day war
with Iraq.
Oil experts in Bahrain said Iran will
find it difficult if not impossible to
rebuild its major bombed refineries
and export facilities near the Persian

Gulf — reported yesterday to still be
in flames and under attack by Iraqi
planes and artillery — with at least
half of Iran's foreign reserves
blocked by a U.S. freeze and no oil
revenues to provide the ready cash.
Moreover, the trade embargo im
posed by the United States and some
Western European nations, in an at
tempt to force Iran's Islamic re
volutionary government to release 52
American hostages held since stu
dents seized the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran almost 11 months ago, is seen
here as likely to prevent Iran from
getting the sophisticated equipment
it will need to put its oil facilities back
in operation.
Some specialists here suggest that
Iran will also have trouble getting the
expert help it will need because of its
internal instability and the increas
ingly anti-Western attitude of the
government.
Resolution
The Iraqi government said yester
day that it was prepared to accept the
U.N. Security Council resolution cal
ling for an end to the week-old con
flict.
But the Baghdad government con
tinued to lay down terms for a set
tlement that would be unacceptable
to the regime in Tehran, according to
reports in Beirut Lebanon.
"I accept direct or indirect talks
with Iran, but only from a position of
strength/' Hussein said. "We are the
swords of the Arab nation. The time
is over when Iran was policeman of
the gulf."
Battlefield
On the battlefield, both sides
claimed additional victories in fight
ing on land, sea and air. And there

were conflicting reports as to
whether Iranian cities had been cap
tured by Iraqi forces.
The Iranian high command said
that their forces had struck at the
Iraqi oil loading terminals at Al Fawat
the head of the gulf. A correspon
dent for the British Broadcasting
Corporation who visited the port
said that the two deep-water loading
terminals that moved much of Iraq's
oil had been put out of commission
and might take months to repair.
Reporters banned
Yesterday, western reporters in
Iraq were banned from crossing the
frontier from Basra into Iran to ob
serve the progress of the fighting.
Also visiting Baghdad was |orda
nian Crown Prince Hassan, repor
tedly bearing a message from King
Hussein that supported Iraqi Presi
dent Hussein's attack on Iran, which
was launched last Monday.
As part of his peace terms, Presi
dent Hussein has demanded that
Iraq be granted full control of the
Shatt al Arab waterway, as well as
other disputed border areas.
And in Tehran, Ahmad Khomeini,

the son of the Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, commented:
"We are not fighting Iraq but
America. What matters to us is saying
no to superpowers and no to force
and oppression.
"There can be no compromise be
tween an Islamic regime and a Satan
ic regime."
In Moscow, the Iranian ambas
sador to the Soviet Union, Moham
med Mokri, declared at a press con
ference that Iran should agree to a
cease-fire only if President Hussein
resigned in Baghdad.
In Turkey, the pipeline that runs
from the oil fields in northern Iraq to
the Mediterranean was reportedly
being repaired after it was damaged
by saboteurs two days ago. Officials
said that it should be repaired by to
morrow.
Iran and Iraq had together ex
ported more than 3 million barrels of
crude oil a day to the non-
Communist world. That production
has been completely shut down by
the hostilities.
