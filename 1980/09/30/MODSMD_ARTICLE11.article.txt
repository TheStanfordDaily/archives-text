# Carter presses war as an issue
## 
### 
Washington (LAT/WP) — The
last has not been heard from
President )immy Carter on the
subject of Republican presi
dential candidate Ronald
Reagan and the risk of war.
"It's a legitimate issue,"
White House press secretary
jody Powell said last week after
the controversy over Carter's
assertion that the November
election "will determine . . .
whether we have peace or
war."
In fact, Carter political
strategists view "war and
peace" not just as a legitimate
issue but as "the issue" of the
campaign. Carter is likely to re
turn to it repeatedly between
now and election day no mat
ter how much criticism he re
ceives for waging a "mean"
and "low-road" campaign
against his Republican oppo
nent.
"You don't relent, you don't
stop, you don't get scared be
cause a bunch of editorial writ
ers say jimmy Carter is being
mean again," one Carter
strategist said.
There are at least two risks to
this strategy. One is that in the
process of trying to portray
Reagan as a "warmonger,"
Carter will indulge his habit of
overstatement, seriously
damaging what is generally
considered his greatest politi
cal strength — his reputation as
a decent man.
Moreover, raising the "war
and peace" issue has given
Reagan and the Republicans
the opportunity to counter
with attacks on the president's
"weak and vacillating" foreign
policy and to charge that this
and what they say has been a
decline in American military
power under Carter pose the
more serious threat to peace.
Thus last week, with the
fighting between Iran and Iraq
forming the backdrop, Carter
urged calm and evenhanded
ness while Reagan asserted
that the administration was at
least partially responsible for

the conflict because of its
policies toward the former
shah of Iran.
Single premise
The president is willing to
risk criticism of his campaign
tactics because his drive for
reelection is based on a single
premise — that if public doubts
about Reagan's personal qual
ifications for the presidency
can be reinforced, the GOP
nominee is a sure loser on
November 4.
Patrick Caddell, the Carter
campaign pollster, calls this
the "acceptability barrier" that
must be overcome by any chal
lenger to an incumbent presi
dent. The challenger's first
task, Caddell argues, is to
make the public comfortable
with the idea of him sitting in
the Oval Office.
In 1976, Carter, a one-term
governor of a Deep South state
whose constant talk of "love"
and religion made large seg
ments of the electorate un
comfortable, barely cleared
that barrier in his race against
former President Gerald Ford.
The Carter strategists' view is
that Reagan's problems in mak
ing it over the same hurdle are
even more serious.
Decent, likeable
According to Caddell and
others, Reagan is viewed as de
cent and likeable.
Beneath that "nice guy" im
age, a Carter strategist said,
there are doubts about
whether the Californian is "too
old, with no depth, not smart
enough and not hard working
enough" to be president.
Operating on the assump
tion that these findings, pro
duced from Caddell's polling
data, are accurate, the Carter
campaign has sought to exploit
them in the area where they
could be expected to cut
deepest in political terms —
the question of war and peace.
The president, at times, has
appeared literally to be trying
to frighten the American
people out of voting for his

opponent.
In his acceptance speech at
the Democratic National Con
vention last month, Carter
said, "the life of every human
being on earth can depend on
the experience and judgement
and vigilance of the person in
the Oval Office. The presi
dent's power for building and
his power for destruction are
awesome. And the power is
greatest exactly where the
stakes are highest — in matters
of war and peace."
Opening his campaign on
Labor Day in Tuscumbia, Ala.,
the president blended an ap
peal to southern chauvinism
with the same "war and peace"
issue. . . In all our nation's
wars, young men from the
South have led the rolls of vol
unteers and also the rolls of
casualties. We southerners be
lieve in the nobility of courage

on the battlefield. And because
we understand the costs of
war, we also believe in the no
bility of peace."
The next day, at a "town
meeting" in Independence,
Missouri, Carter accused
Reagan of planning to set off "a
massive nuclear arms race
against the Soviet Union" that
would pose a "serious threat"
to the "safety and the security
and the peace of our nation
and of the world."
Peace or war
Then last Monday, in a
speech to the California AFL
CIO, Carter took the issue one
final step. He dropped all qual
ifying language to say the elec
tion will determine "whether
we have peace or war."
Reagan called Carter's asser
tion "beneath decency," and
Powell conceded it had been
an "overstatement."

strategists view "war and
peace" not just as a legitimate
issue but as "the issue" of the
campaign. Carter is likely to re
turn to it repeatedly between
now and election day no mat
ter how much criticism he re
ceives for waging a "mean"
and "low-road" campaign
against his Republican oppo
nent.
"You don't relent, you don't
stop, you don't get scared be
cause a bunch of editorial writ
ers say jimmy Carter is being
mean again," one Carter
strategist said.
There are at least two risks to
this strategy. One is that in the
process of trying to portray
Reagan as a "warmonger,"
Carter will indulge his habit of
overstatement, seriously
damaging what is generally
considered his greatest politi
cal strength — his reputation as
a decent man.
Moreover, raising the "war
and peace" issue has given
Reagan and the Republicans
the opportunity to counter
with attacks on the president's
"weak and vacillating" foreign
policy and to charge that this
and what they say has been a
decline in American military
power under Carter pose the
more serious threat to peace.
Thus last week, with the
fighting between Iran and Iraq
forming the backdrop, Carter
urged calm and evenhanded
ness while Reagan asserted
that the administration was at
least partially responsible for

the conflict because of its
policies toward the former
shah of Iran.
Single premise
The president is willing to
risk criticism of his campaign
tactics because his drive for
reelection is based on a single
premise — that if public doubts
about Reagan's personal qual
ifications for the presidency
can be reinforced, the GOP
nominee is a sure loser on
November 4.
Patrick Caddell, the Carter
campaign pollster, calls this
the "acceptability barrier" that
must be overcome by any chal
lenger to an incumbent presi
dent. The challenger's first
task, Caddell argues, is to
make the public comfortable
with the idea of him sitting in
the Oval Office.
In 1976, Carter, a one-term
governor of a Deep South state
whose constant talk of "love"
and religion made large seg
ments of the electorate un
comfortable, barely cleared
that barrier in his race against
former President Gerald Ford.
The Carter strategists' view is
that Reagan's problems in mak
ing it over the same hurdle are
even more serious.
Decent, likeable
According to Caddell and
others, Reagan is viewed as de
cent and likeable.
Beneath that "nice guy" im
age, a Carter strategist said,
there are doubts about
whether the Californian is "too
old, with no depth, not smart
enough and not hard working
enough" to be president.
Operating on the assump
tion that these findings, pro
duced from Caddell's polling
data, are accurate, the Carter
campaign has sought to exploit
them in the area where they
could be expected to cut
deepest in political terms —
the question of war and peace.
The president, at times, has
appeared literally to be trying
to frighten the American
people out of voting for his

opponent.
In his acceptance speech at
the Democratic National Con
vention last month, Carter
said, "the life of every human
being on earth can depend on
the experience and judgement
and vigilance of the person in
the Oval Office. The presi
dent's power for building and
his power for destruction are
awesome. And the power is
greatest exactly where the
stakes are highest — in matters
of war and peace."
Opening his campaign on
Labor Day in Tuscumbia, Ala.,
the president blended an ap
peal to southern chauvinism
with the same "war and peace"
issue. . . In all our nation's
wars, young men from the
South have led the rolls of vol
unteers and also the rolls of
casualties. We southerners be
lieve in the nobility of courage

on the battlefield. And because
we understand the costs of
war, we also believe in the no
bility of peace."
The next day, at a "town
meeting" in Independence,
Missouri, Carter accused
Reagan of planning to set off "a
massive nuclear arms race
against the Soviet Union" that
would pose a "serious threat"
to the "safety and the security
and the peace of our nation
and of the world."
Peace or war
Then last Monday, in a
speech to the California AFL
CIO, Carter took the issue one
final step. He dropped all qual
ifying language to say the elec
tion will determine "whether
we have peace or war."
Reagan called Carter's asser
tion "beneath decency," and
Powell conceded it had been
an "overstatement."

Washington (LAT/WP) — The
last has not been heard from
President )immy Carter on the
subject of Republican presi
dential candidate Ronald
Reagan and the risk of war.
"It's a legitimate issue,"
White House press secretary
jody Powell said last week after
the controversy over Carter's
assertion that the November
election "will determine . . .
whether we have peace or
war."
