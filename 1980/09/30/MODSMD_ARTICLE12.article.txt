# Law school minority enrollment up
## 
### Carol Rose 
Minority enrollment at the
Stanford Law School has hit a
record high for the second year
in a row. This autumn's enter
ing class of 169 includes 20
blacks, 15 Chicanos and three
Puerto Ricans, 22 percent of all
first-year students.
Four Asian Americans also
are enrolled, another record
high.
Law Dean Charles Meyers
credits the increase in minority
enrollment to "the continuing
hard work" of Assistant Dean
LaDoris Cordell.
"Historically only 30 percent
of those that we accepted en
rolled," said Cordell. "The key
is follow-up. You must have in
tensive contact with the stu
dents once they are accepted."
As a result of Cordell's re
cruitment efforts, nearly half of
the 80 accepted minority stu
dents actually enrolled in the
law school.

Many other law schools have
much less success in attracting
minority students. Out of 175
in Vale's entering class, 23 are
minority students. Duke has
only 12 minority students in its
class of 1% this year.
"The other schools do not
take risks," said Cordell. "The
scores may not be as high, but
the potential of these students
is great. They have often come
from a background where they
have had to overcome many
obstacles.
"The number of minorities
enrolled (in other law schools)
is just ridiculous. For example,
Chicago last year had only five
minority students admitted,
and two enrolled," she said.
Cordell's follow-up includes
arranging meetings on the East
Coast and in the South bet
ween alumni and prospective
black students. Alumni also
make contact on the East Coast
with Puerto Rican applicants,
and in the Southwest and West
with Chicano students.
In addition, Cordell asked
law school faculty to personally
telephone those accepted tor
admission.
Furthermore, one alumnus
donated funds to bring the 10
top candidates to the campus.
Six of these students are now
enrolled.
Students respond
Bridgette Berry, a first-year
black student, said the re
cruitment effort played a sig
nificant role in her decision to
attend Stanford.
"It is the main reason why I
came here. I felt that Stanford
really wanted me to make an
informed choice," she said.
John Trasvino, a Chicano
student, planned on going to
Harvard or Boalt Law School at
UC-Berkeley before he heard
from Cordell, he said.
"Compared to the other
schools, it showed that Stan
ford was interested in me. The
level of personal interest made
the difference," he said.
Both Cordell and lack Frie
denthal, chairman of the law

school's admissions commit
tee, said LSAT scores and grade
point averages of minority en
rollees were slightly lower than
those of non-minorities.
Neither would say how much
lower.
"To say better' scores for
Caucasians is misleading," said
Friedenthal. "The minorities
do not necessarily have the
best scores or grades all of the
time, but the nature of the
courses and activities of all the
students is also reviewed.
"Our policy, in general, is to
pick all students on diverse
criteria. We have no raw statis
tics alone, and no cutoff point
for scores. Ours is a diversity
program and it touches the di
versity of the Caucasians as
well," he said.
"If no minorities were qual
ified to be here, there would
be an all-white class at Stan
ford," said Cordell.
The law school considers
four groups as minorities when
reviewing applications:
Chicanos, blacks, Puerto Ri
cans and native Americans.
Asian Americans are not consi
dered a minority group by the
law school.
Recruitment policies
"The one complaint that I
have about the recruitment
policy," said Trasvino, "is that
Stanford should recognize
Asian Americans as
minorities."
"The Asian American en
rollment is at an all-time high,
whi ;h s'iows that it has really
been pitiful in the past few
years," said Cordell.
"The reason that the number
of Asian American students is
so low is that there is really no
concerted drive to get these
students," said Friedenthal.
"I thought Asians wouldn't
be considered a minority be
cause there would be so many
out here," said Clarence Koo,
an Asian American first year
student. "I was really surprised
there were so few Asians at
Stanford, especially since I be
lieve Boalt Hall considers

Asians as a minority," he said.
Boalt Law School at UC-
Berkeley is one of the tew law
schools that tops Stanford in its
minority enrollment. More
than 26 percent of its incoming
class are minority students.
Beth Cobb O'Neil, director
of admissions at Boalt, said
nine percent of the students
are black, nine percent are
Chicano, seven percent are
Asian, two percent are Latino,
and 1.5 percent are native
American.
"Educational opportunities
for Asian Americans have been
considered better in the past,"
said Friedenthal. "For the most
part they went to better high
schools and colleges.
"This is not true for all of
them, or all Caucasians, but
the same conditions do not
prevail for Asian Americans
that do for the minorities for
the most part," he added.
Suburban minorities favored
Nevertheless, Friedenthal
said, the minority enrollment
program tends to favor the
suburban minorities.
"All of the students here
come from exceptional
families, and it is true, we don't
have many students from the
ghettos," he said, "but if we
find them we will grab them."
Koosaid he would liketosee
affirmative action programs
based on need rather than
race. Economic need is not
considered in the admissions
process, according to Cordell.
Super lawyers
"We don't look into need
until after they are admitted,
but almost every minority stu
dent is on financial aid â€” as are
many Caucasians," she said.
"These students are un
ique," said Friedenthal. "There
is not much reason to exist if
we only turn out journeymen
attorneys.
"We must turn out super
lawyers, who will have a diffe
rent kind of success. We get a
lot of pluses for our personal
approach," he said.
