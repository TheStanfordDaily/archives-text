# The
						Stanford Daily
## 
### 
. . . is an independent, student-run
corporation.
Nearly 20 editors — all students —
direct an editorial and business staff
of over 100. A large advertising
budget and a student fee assessment
keep the presses rolling Monday
through Friday.
... is expanding.
In just a few years, the Daily has
deepened its national and world
news coverage. The number of pages
per issue and the number of special
issues published have both
increased. Our monthly magazine
will continue to probe more deeply
into current issues, events and the
people who make them.
. .. is a valuable educational
experience.
Workshops will acquaint less
experienced staffers with basic
journalistic principles and the
elements of Daily style. Editors will
provide constructive feedback on
staffers' work, in order to sharpen
journalistic skills and improve the
final product.

. . . is a respected pre-professional
publication.
Daily alumni are currently working
for the New York Times, The Wall
Street Journal, The Washington Post,
The Los Angeles Times, and other
prominent publications. Our
newly-installed Video Display
Terminals (VDTs) will help prepare
aspiring journalists for the
increasingly computerized
professional news media.
... is more than just a newspaper.
Parties, banquets, and guest speakers
from professional newspapers are all
a part of working for the Daily.
Faculty and ASSU Softball teams suck
turf at the hands of the omnipotent
Daily longballers.
... needs your help!
We need reporters, editors,
photographers, proofreaders,
reviewers, columnists and anyone
who is interested in finding out what
it's like to publish a newspaper.
Experience is welcomed but by no
means required. Find out how easy,
and fun, it can be to be involved with
the Daily.
