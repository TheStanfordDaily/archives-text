# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Vance Mason Senior nostalgia strikes 
### 
Plunking down Dad's tuition
check, I was suddenly seized
byasinkingfeeling. Inspection
of the gray, freshly stamped ID
card confirmed my suspicions.
"Am I a Senior already? Oh
shit!"
Not that I didn't know it was
coming. I can still remember
Mom comforting Dad as he
sobbed into the morning mail,
clutching my Stanford accep
tance letter in one hand;
"There, there, |oe, it's only for
tour years. We can do without
food."
But four years seemed like
eternity to an 18-year
old. I kept waking up the night
before the plane trip west,
choreographing Beach Boy
tunes and wishing they all
could be California girls. I
memorized Approaching Stan
ford and Courses and Degrees,
and packed plenty of suntan lo
tion.
I wasn't disappointed. Stan
ford has been worth every
penny, even though my dog
Dixie did mysteriously disap
pear one week when Mom ran
low on stew meat. Where else
would I get to rub elbows with
Ralph Nader, or take physics
from a Nobel prize-winner, or
meet Iranians for less than 255
days?
I cherish memories of
Chinese New Year in
"Everyone's Favorite City,"
and family-size Togo's
sandwiches. I tried to have a
lack's taco bronzed, but there
was too much grease for it to
stick. I'll also remember all my

college firsts: first sex, first
drugs, first violence. (Thank
Cod for the Stanford Band.)
Seriously, I've done a lot of
growing up here.
I love Stanford. In nine
months, it'll be time to split, or
else go to work as one of those
men in go-karts who ticket cars
in the parking lots.
Think of all the painstakingly
acquired knowledge that will
be wasted: how to beat the
lines at Registration, the free
Xerox machine, the proper
tone to use when pleading for
an extension on a paper, the
good study rooms in Terman
and how to open locked Ter
man doors, the cheapest Mar
garita spot in Palo Alto (Casa
Maria happy hour, 4-6 every
day, free munchies.)
This information will be clut
tering my brain, no longer of
any use, while freshmen bang
into brick walls for the lack of
it. There ought to be some way
to pass it on, like blood trans
fusion or the old Frankenstein
brain swap (shades of
Shockley).
Stanford has been a special
place for me. Sure, it's shel
tered and isolated. That's one
good reason for leaving and
not becoming a fifth, then
sixth, then tenth-year Senior.
But the real world being the
fast, nasty place it is, it's good
to be sheltered for a while.
It's fun getting crazy at foot
ball games, swimming naked in
Deguerre pool at midnight and
having food fights. If you ha
ven't noticed, these activities

are frowned upon in adults, to
lerated in students.
For four years, I'll have lived
in an idyllic community of to
lerant, mostly open-minded,
enthusiastic people. So hey!
Geronimo! Let's see if I can't
find some of that in the real
world, too.
Four years isn't eternity,
after all.
Anyway, I still have 25 per
cent of my Stanford sojourn
left. And there are good points
to being a Senior.
See you in the Quad at
moonrise.

it. There ought to be some way
to pass it on, like blood trans
fusion or the old Frankenstein
brain swap (shades of
Shockley).
Stanford has been a special
place for me. Sure, it's shel
tered and isolated. That's one
good reason for leaving and
not becoming a fifth, then
sixth, then tenth-year Senior.
But the real world being the
fast, nasty place it is, it's good
to be sheltered for a while.
It's fun getting crazy at foot
ball games, swimming naked in
Deguerre pool at midnight and
having food fights. If you ha
ven't noticed, these activities

are frowned upon in adults, to
lerated in students.
For four years, I'll have lived
in an idyllic community of to
lerant, mostly open-minded,
enthusiastic people. So hey!
Geronimo! Let's see if I can't
find some of that in the real
world, too.
Four years isn't eternity,
after all.
Anyway, I still have 25 per
cent of my Stanford sojourn
left. And there are good points
to being a Senior.
See you in the Quad at
moonrise.
