## Stop decline in youth vote 
### 
Nine years have passed since
the voting age was reduced to
18, yet in this time the much
heralded "youth vote," which
was supposed to cause elec
toral upheaval and shake the
American political system to its
very roots, has been all but for
gotten.
There is some justification
for forgetting about the youth
vote. It is true that the total
voter turnout has been steadily
decreasing for some time now,
dropping 14 percent from 63
percent in 1962 t049 percent in
1976. The drop in turnout in the
18-24 year-old category is more
severe, dropping 24 percent in
just seven years, from 49.5 per
cent in 1972 to just under 25
percent in 1978.
Within that cohort, the re
sults from the 18-20 category
are even worse, averaging
seven percent fewer voters
than their 21-24 year-old coun
terparts over the same time
span. Only 21 percent of 18-20
year-olds voted in 1978.
It is evident that the youth
vote has declined in impor
tance. There are several
reasons for this. Many people
assert that there are no overrid
ing issues which motivate stu
dents to register and vote, such
as were found in the early
1970'5.
A second argument states
that political involvement
comes with the acquisition of
goods, in having some material
stake in the government's role
as provider or assessor. People
paying property taxes, working
full-time, and sending their
kids to school will naturally be
more interested in local elec
tions than full-time students.
Finally, there are many who
trace the decline of the youth
vote to frustration with the
political system. Watergate,
Koreagate, and Abscam lead a
list of political scandals and
tragedies which have led many
prospective voters to a "what's
the difference" attitude. Polls
show that fewer people than
ever before in the history of
polling believe that political
participation can actually effect
change within the political sys
tem.
A better understanding of
the impact of many current
electoral issues, coupled with a
realization of the potential
power of the student/youth

vote, will help to refute these
arguments.
The notion that there are no
issues that can draw students
together and that we have no
stake in the political process is
ridiculous. Prop. 13 definitely
impacted the job market for
graduates. State and federal
aid to students is dependent
upon the good will of state and
federal legislators, who are
elected by the voters. Fair
rents, an issues that is critical to
all members of our commun
ity, were preserved this spring
through the defeat of Prop. 10.
Human rights? Civil liber
ties? Take your pick of a hand
ful of issues. Then think of the
four or five Supreme Court ap
pointments the President and
the Senate will make over the
next administration. The prob
lem is not a lack of important
issues, but rather a lack of
awareness of the causal con
nection between those issues
and the ballot box.
The assumption that the in
dividual student, or for that
matter an entire cohort of
student-age people, cannot
exert a positive influence
through voting is also absurd.
It must be remembered that

the political process is de
signed to repond to an active
voluntary electorate; that is,
they listen to votes, not
people.
In California alone, 15 of the
43 Congressional elections in
1978 had margins of victory
which were smaller than the
number of college students in
the district. While this assumes
that students vote as a bloc (far
from historical fact) it also
clearly indicates a potential for
student political power. If the
energy wasted on frustration
was manifested instead as
voter registration, education,
and get-out-the vote, perhaps
this potential power could be
realized.
Reviving the youth vote is
not the final answer to the
problems that we face, but it is
an important first step. The
cure for democracy's ills is
complex indeed, but it in
volves more democracy, not
less.

Nine years have passed since
the voting age was reduced to
18, yet in this time the much
heralded "youth vote," which
was supposed to cause elec
toral upheaval and shake the
American political system to its
very roots, has been all but for
gotten.
There is some justification
for forgetting about the youth
vote. It is true that the total
voter turnout has been steadily
decreasing for some time now,
dropping 14 percent from 63
percent in 1962 t049 percent in
1976. The drop in turnout in the
18-24 year-old category is more
severe, dropping 24 percent in
just seven years, from 49.5 per
cent in 1972 to just under 25
percent in 1978.
Within that cohort, the re
sults from the 18-20 category
are even worse, averaging
seven percent fewer voters
than their 21-24 year-old coun
terparts over the same time
span. Only 21 percent of 18-20
year-olds voted in 1978.
It is evident that the youth
vote has declined in impor
tance. There are several
reasons for this. Many people
assert that there are no overrid
ing issues which motivate stu
dents to register and vote, such
as were found in the early
1970'5.
A second argument states
that political involvement
comes with the acquisition of
goods, in having some material
stake in the government's role
as provider or assessor. People
paying property taxes, working
full-time, and sending their
kids to school will naturally be
more interested in local elec
tions than full-time students.
Finally, there are many who
trace the decline of the youth
vote to frustration with the
political system. Watergate,
Koreagate, and Abscam lead a
list of political scandals and
tragedies which have led many
prospective voters to a "what's
the difference" attitude. Polls
show that fewer people than
ever before in the history of
polling believe that political
participation can actually effect
change within the political sys
tem.
A better understanding of
the impact of many current
electoral issues, coupled with a
realization of the potential
power of the student/youth

vote, will help to refute these
arguments.
The notion that there are no
issues that can draw students
together and that we have no
stake in the political process is
ridiculous. Prop. 13 definitely
impacted the job market for
graduates. State and federal
aid to students is dependent
upon the good will of state and
federal legislators, who are
elected by the voters. Fair
rents, an issues that is critical to
all members of our commun
ity, were preserved this spring
through the defeat of Prop. 10.
Human rights? Civil liber
ties? Take your pick of a hand
ful of issues. Then think of the
four or five Supreme Court ap
pointments the President and
the Senate will make over the
next administration. The prob
lem is not a lack of important
issues, but rather a lack of
awareness of the causal con
nection between those issues
and the ballot box.
The assumption that the in
dividual student, or for that
matter an entire cohort of
student-age people, cannot
exert a positive influence
through voting is also absurd.
It must be remembered that

the political process is de
signed to repond to an active
voluntary electorate; that is,
they listen to votes, not
people.
In California alone, 15 of the
43 Congressional elections in
1978 had margins of victory
which were smaller than the
number of college students in
the district. While this assumes
that students vote as a bloc (far
from historical fact) it also
clearly indicates a potential for
student political power. If the
energy wasted on frustration
was manifested instead as
voter registration, education,
and get-out-the vote, perhaps
this potential power could be
realized.
Reviving the youth vote is
not the final answer to the
problems that we face, but it is
an important first step. The
cure for democracy's ills is
complex indeed, but it in
volves more democracy, not
less.
