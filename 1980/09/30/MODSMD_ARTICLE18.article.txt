# Auschwitz life seen in TV special
## 
### 
Hollywood (LAT) — Nothing
on TV has adequately exposed
the dark heart and grizzly in
humanity of Hitlerism.
No drama has suggested the
stench of Auschwitz that was
said to contaminate the sur
rounding countryside or the
red sky above the death plant
that could be seen at night for
miles. Until now.
Playing For Time (tonight on
CBS) may not be the best TV of
the 1980-81 season, but it will
do until something else comes
along.
Part of its mastery is its ex

pression of so much through
the experiences of so few. It
glimpses the monstrous im
pact of the Holocaust largely
through the eyes of Auschwitz
survivor Fania Fenelon, who
was reprieved from being gas
sed when she was recruited to
be a member of the pitiful
female camp orchestra forced
to play principally for the SS.
The work on the screen is all
the more amazing considering
it resulted from two directors,
Joseph Sargent, who left mid
way through the production,
and Daniel Mann, who re

placed him.
There are variances here
from the Fenelon memoir
upon which Playing For Time is
based. Arthur Miller's fine
script fills a wider track, one
that translates one woman's
story into a metaphor for a soc
iety of victims.
The central figure of Playing
For Time remains Fenelon, and
Vanessa Redgrave's rendering
of her is symphonic, head sha
ven, eyes sunken, a perfor
mance especially stunning in
light of the distracting emo
tional environment in which it

was conceived.
Redgrave's opposition to Is
rael and support of the Pales
tine Liberation Organization
have earned her many
enemies, particularly among
Jews, and it remains to be seen
whether attempts to organize a
boycott of the program will be
effective. Among Redgrave's
fiercest critics has been Fene
lon herself, a tiny half-Jewish
Parisian repelled by Redgrave's
radical politics, and convinced
that she is also physically unfit
for the role.
The turmoil did not deter
Redgrave from giving a per
formance in which she totally
submerges her larger-than-life
persona to the point where all
the controversy vanishes from
your mind as Playing For Time
begins to unfold.
One of the most compelling
scenes in the whole three
hours shows Redgrave getting
her hair sheared upon arrival at
Auschwitz, shock and humilia
tion coloring her face.
"My heart beats," she says
much later as a despairing
Fenelon, "but I'm filling up
with dust." Showing us suffer
ing on the outside is the stuff of
good acting; showing us that
dust within is even higher art.
