A series of 21 symposia, aimed at
pinpointing key issues facing each
region of the world, will be held here
during autumn and winter quarters.
Entitled "A World in Crisis: The
U.S. Faces the Future," the program
will focus on key countries around
the world, and will deal specifically
with the relations between those
countries, the Soviet Union and the
United States.
The sessions will be held in the
Forum Room of Meyer Library at 4:15
p.m. Wednesdays. The public is in

Hilton, director of the California
Institute of International Studies,
which is sponsoring the symposia,
will chair the organizing committee.
"I am disturbed by the lack of in
terest in international affairs in the
United States," he says. "For exam
ple, in the Anderson-Reagan debate,
foreign policy issues were not men
tioned.
"We (the institute) have a great

deal of information, and it simply
does not appear in the press," he
adds.
The institute is a 15-year-old non
profit organization comprised of
Stanford faculty and faculty from the
University of California who "feel
that the structure of the University
does not encourage serious study of
international affairs," Hilton says.
By educating students and mem
bers of the surrounding community,
Hilton says he hopes to make the
University a center for serious study
of international issues.
Each symposium will be led by four
well-known specialists in the discus

involving the Soviet Union and East
ern Europe. Keynote speakers will be

the Soviet attitude toward the Wed
nesday symposium issue. The Tues
day meetings will be held at 7:30
p.m. in Meyer Forum Room, begin
ning today.
Hilton emphasizes the importance
of comparing the U.S. and Soviet
viewpoints.
"Polarization between the United
States and the Soviet Union is an in
evitable ingredient in international

relations — it is what this is all ab
out," he says.
On Oct. 8, the forum will focus on
Great Britain and Ireland; and on
Oct. 15, it will focus on France and
Benelux.
The series will continue weekly
