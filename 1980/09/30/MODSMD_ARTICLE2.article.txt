# World issues symposia to be presented here
## 
### Carol Rose 
A series of 21 symposia, aimed at
pinpointing key issues facing each
region of the world, will be held here
during autumn and winter quarters.
Entitled "A World in Crisis: The
U.S. Faces the Future," the program
will focus on key countries around
the world, and will deal specifically
with the relations between those
countries, the Soviet Union and the
United States.
The sessions will be held in the
Forum Room of Meyer Library at 4:15
p.m. Wednesdays. The public is in
vited to attend free of charge.
According to Emeritus Prof, of
Spanish and Portuguese Ronald Hil
ton, the purpose of the program is to
educate the public about interna
tional issues generally not covered
by the mass media.
Hilton, director of the California
Institute of International Studies,
which is sponsoring the symposia,
will chair the organizing committee.
"I am disturbed by the lack of in
terest in international affairs in the
United States," he says. "For exam
ple, in the Anderson-Reagan debate,
foreign policy issues were not men
tioned.
"We (the institute) have a great

deal of information, and it simply
does not appear in the press," he
adds.
The institute is a 15-year-old non
profit organization comprised of
Stanford faculty and faculty from the
University of California who "feel
that the structure of the University
does not encourage serious study of
international affairs," Hilton says.
By educating students and mem
bers of the surrounding community,
Hilton says he hopes to make the
University a center for serious study
of international issues.
Each symposium will be led by four
well-known specialists in the discus
sion topic. The first meeting,
tomorrow, will cover issues
involving the Soviet Union and East
ern Europe. Keynote speakers will be
Andrew Janos of the University of
California at Berkeley; Larry Caldwell
of Occidental College and Robert
Wesson from the University of
California at Santa Barbara.
In addition to the Wednesday
meetings, Hilton will conduct pre
symposium programs on Tuesday
evenings to provide background on
the Soviet attitude toward the Wed
