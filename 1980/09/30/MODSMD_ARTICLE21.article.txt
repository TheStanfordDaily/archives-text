# Five things you can do with the Daily (besides reading it):
## 
### 
1. Wallpaper your room. The Daily makes an attractive wall design for students
on a low budget;
2. Trade it for a used Osmonds record;
3. Cut out words from the headlines and send fake ransom notes to your
roommate's parents;
4. Wear it on your head as a shield from cosmic rays;
5. Write for it.
It's easy. Just come to one of our new staffer meetings this week, today at 11 a.m.
and 2 p.m., tomorrow at 12 noon and 3 p.m., Thursday at 11 a.m. or Friday at 1
p.m., and talk to us about working for the Daily. You don't have to have any
newspaper experience and you don't have to devote 30 hours a week to the job.
And there are lots of other interesting things you can do besides writing. Layout,
for instance. Or photography. Reviews. Opinions. Cartoons. Sports. And more.
