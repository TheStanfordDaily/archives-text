# Lame duck session planned
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — The House will decide the
fate of a convicted lawmaker and the Senate is
due to get a report on Billy Carter as Congress
prepares to recess until after the Nov. 4 election.
In the House, a tloor vote is expected this
week on an ethics committee recommendation
that Rep. Michael Myers (D-Pa.), be expelled
because of his conviction tor taking a $50,000
bribe from undercover FBI agents.
Libyan links?
A special Senate subcommittee, meanwhile,
is putting finishing touches on its investigation
and preparing a report on the links between
President |immy Carter's brother Billy and the
Libyan government.
Both houses plan to recess on Thursday and
return on Nov. 12 for the first post-election ses
sion since 1974 and the first one in a presidential
election year since 1948.
Myers, a 37-year-old former longshoreman
serving his first term in Congress, was convicted
by a federal jury in Brooklyn of taking the cash
payment after promising to introduce a bill to
help a supposed Arab "sheik" enter the coun
try.
'No crime'
He told the House ethics committee last week
that he committed no crime because he did not
intend to introduce the bill. He said he would

resign from Congress it his appeal from his con
viction were denied.
Speaker of the House Thomas O'Neill (D-
Mass.) told reporters later that many members
thought expulsion would be an unduly severe
penalty under the circumstances.
By the time the Billy Carter subcommittee
makes its report to the Senate, the Senate may
no longer be in session. In establishing the spe
cial panel, the Senate directed it to report by
Oct. 4, the expected date of adjournment.
Early recess
Since then, Congress decided to recess a
couple of days before that and come back tor its
"lame-duck" session.
Philip Tone, special counsel for the subcom
mittee, said it hoped to complete its report be
fore Oct. 4, which is Saturday, but might not be
able to do so.
The investigation was ordered after Billy Car
ter registered as an agent of the Libyan govern
ment and disclosed that he had received
$220,000 in payments from that government. He
said the payments were advances on a loan.
The panel is trying to find out whether Billy
Carter influenced government policy and
whether he received any special treatment from
the government. Both he and administration of
ficials have said neither is true.
