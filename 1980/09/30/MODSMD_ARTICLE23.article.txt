# Car won't start? Listen!

Providence, R.I. (AP) — Un
derstanding how your car
"talks" when it won't start may
help you avoid improper or
unneeded repairs, says the
technical services manager of
an auto parts manufacturing
company.
Dave Bowman, of Fram
Corp., advises motorists to lis
ten for these common sounds
of trouble:
— If your car makes no noise
when you turn the ignition key,
electricity is probably not
going to the starter. The cause
may be a loose or corroded
battery terminal, loose or bro
ken wire, or dead battery.

— If the car goes "click
click-click," there's enough
electricity to activate the sol
enoid, but not enough to turn
the starter over. This may mean
corroded battery terminals, a
defective starter, or battery in
need of recharging.
— If the engine sounds slug
gish, you're not getting
enough voltage to the starter.
Probable causes are a weak or
worn battery, loose or worn
fan belt, faulty alternator or
regulator, or excessive resis
tance in the starter or starter
circuits. "Lazy" turnover may
also be caused by engine oil
too heavy for prevailing temp

eratures — a common winter
ailment.
— If the engine cranks slowly
but won't start, usually the bat
tery is weak — but a defective
starter may also be to blame. If
it cranks briskly but won't start,
there probably is no spark, or
fuel isn't getting to the car
buretor. This may be caused by
moisture, dirty or broken
breaker points, dirt or other
restriction in the fuel system, a
failed ballast resistor — or an
empty fuel tank.
— If the engine turns over
but stalls as soon as you release
the key, you may have a defec
tive ignition switch
