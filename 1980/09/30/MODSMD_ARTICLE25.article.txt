# Street gold thefts rising
## 
### 
New York (LAT/WP) — The
gold-snatcher, part of New
York's newest crime wave, is
only 16, a Brooklyn street kid
dressed in bright new clothes
and the requisite sneakers.
He's an expert in what he
does, because he's been
snatching gold necklaces in the
streets and subways for nearly
two years, ever since the price
of gold went up.
He can't help but brag that
when he was in the business
(the police have recently re
tired him) he'd "never
snatched gold-filled, only
gold."
He knows the stations and
the subways least protected by
police, and he knows the best
areas of Manhattan. "Midtown
. . . that big hotel over by
Grand Central . . . rich white
people with a lot of gold."
Rings? Too difficult to grab,
he said. He'd never bother un
less they had diamonds. Gold
wedding bands? Certainly not
worth the fuss. As for the an
tique silver bracelet a visitor is
wearing, he gives it only the
most disdainful look. He'd
never snatch it if he saw it in the
street.
"Ain't gold," he says. "Don't
cost as much as gold."
The boy, who prefers to be
known only as Joe, is one of a
legion of criminals who is in
volved in what is New York Ci
ty's most recent growing
crime: the snatching of gold
jewelry, particularly necklaces.
It's a crime, according to
Transit Authority officials, that
accounts for 35 to4o percent of
the felonies on the subway.
According to subway statistics,
it resulted in 2000 reported
thefts in the first eight months

of this year.
But it is not merely a subway
crime. It's taking place, police
say, more and more often on
the streets, often in daylight,
and it often ends in brutal in
juries or death.
Police officer Alan Ber
kowitz, an undercover
member of the 30-member
mobile task force of the city's
Transit Authority, says that
serious neck wounds and torn
ear lobes are not uncommon.
He credits the problem, as do
police spokesmen, to the high
price of gold and the easy re
sale of gold items. There are
shops around New York, he
says, not necessarily jewelry
shops, that have signs in the
window: "We buy gold, no
questions asked."
Berkowitz says that the
crime, which usually occurs in
warm weather when jewelry is
both accessible and visible, is a
young man's crime.
"These kids know that if
they're 16 or over, they'll end
up in criminal court,"he says.
"So they'll work with the
younger kids, the ones who'll
end up in Family Court, where
the sentences for non-violent
crimes are nothing.
That was the case with the

young gold-snatcher called
Joe, whom the police have now
recruited as an informer.
Picked up at 15 for snatching,
he was sent to Family Court,
where the case was dismissed.
"I didn't have no gold on me,
so they throwed it out," he
says. He is aware of the law and
is careful. For example, he'll
break the chain cleanly — "You
don't want to drag 'em, 'cause
ifyoudrag'em it'srobberyplus
assault." He is alsoawareof the
quality of the gold he sees.
"Me, I read up on it myself,"
he says. "Got some books in
school — so I know gold is the
softest metal there is. I know
how to test it . . . and my ma
wears a lot of gold, so I take
some of that, and I take a fake
and if you look at it a long time,
you're able to see the differ
ence. . .
The morality of snatching
jewelry does not concern him
— though he does take offense
when he is asked if he ever has
time for school. Of course he
goes to school, he says. Why
do you think he snatched that
gold? To get the money for
clothes.
"Nobody wants to go to
school lookin' like a bum," he
says.
