# Flood closes tower, Hoover library OK
## 
### Karen Springen 
New students will have to
wait to go to the top of 285-
foot Hoover Tower this
year.
A 12-inch water main out
side the building broke
Sept. 19, flooding the
elevator shaft and filling the
basement with two inches
of water. The elevator was
closed as a safety precau
tion.
According to Robert Beth,
director of risk manage
ment here, total damage is
estimated at $40,000.
The pipe broke when a
workman from Fairley Con
struction Company hit a
concrete block, causing the
pipe to shift.
"Our opinion is that it's
the contractor's fault," said
Beth. Fairley received
copies of pipe locations in
advance, he added.
Dennis Spellmire, assis
tant director of the Hoover
Institution, said all the elec
trical equipment in the pas

senger elevator that shorted
out must be rewired. All
carpet and tile in the
flooded areas must also be
replaced.
Other damage expenses
include $10,000 for an elec
trical transformer outside
the building, cleanup ex
penses and a temporary au
xiliary power supply for the
adjacent Art Department.
The University will take
legal action it the contractor
does not pay the bills, said
Beth.
Books, periodicals and
newspapers in the Hoover
Library were not damaged.
As a flood precaution, these
collections are always kept
six inches off the ground
and valuable books are
placed on upper shelves.
Unrelated floods have
occurred in Meyer, Green
and the law school libraries
since November 1978.

Two inches of water in the Hoover Institution basement forced
Assistant Director Dennis Spellmire to get his feet wet. Flooding,
the result of a broken water pipe, dumped water and silt both
inside and outside the building.
