# Canada debates new 'Bill of Rights'
## 
### 
Ottawa (LAT/WP) — Premier
Allan Blakeney ot Saskatche
wan Province is a socialist, a
Rhodes scholar, and the head
of government in a region that
has introduced some of Cana
da's most progressive social
legislation. An outsider might
expect a Canadian like
Blakeney to be one ot the most
fervent advocates of a constitu
tional bill of rights for his coun
try.
But Blakeney, like many
other Canadians, is suspicious
of the idea of putting written
guarantees of freedoms, like
those in the U.S. Constitution,
into a new national charter.
"I go down to visit my people
in the United States,"
Blakeney, who has American
relatives, told the ill-fated
Canadian constitutional con
ference last week, "and I see all
the stores open on Christmas
day, and I don't like to see the
stores open, but theyareopen,
and the Americans call it free
dom of religion."
Privately, Blakeney said later
that he might compromise on
the issue, but his spirited at
tack on Prime Minister Pierre
Elliott Trudeau's proposed bill
of rights, along with even more
spirited attacks by most of the
premiers of Canada's nine
other provinces, helped en
sure failure forthe conference.
It may seem surprising that
thoughtful Canadians could
oppose a democratic idea that
most Americans take for
granted, but that opposition
reflects a conservatism, and a
British tradition of parliamen
tary protection of rights that
run deep in Canadian society.
Citing the U.S. Constitution as

a bad example tor Canada,
Premier Sterling Lyon of Man
itoba said, "Their way ot gov
ernment, their way ot protect
ing rights, is not our way. Their
way is not our tradition."
In the end, Trudeau may
prevail in his long campaign to
bring a constitutional bill ot
rights to Canada. His govern
ment has announced it will
soon call Parliament into ses
sion to consider constitutional
change perhaps including es
tablishment of a bill ot rights.
Canada already has a law that
is called "the Bill ot Rights" and
includes many ot the guaran
tees like freedom of religion,
speech, assembly and the
press and the right to justice
that are included in the U.S.
Bill of Rights.
As a practical matter, how
ever, the Canadian bill has not
had much of an impact on
Canadians. Unlike the Ameri
can Bill of Rights, the Canadian
version, passed in 1960, is not
part of the Constitution but
only a simple federal law that
can be changed at any timebya
majority vote of Parliament. If it
were part of the Constitution,
like the American Bill of Rights,
it could be changed only
through a cumbersome
amendment process. That
would, as Trudeau puts it, "en
trench" the rights.
The present Canadian Bill of
Rights also does not bind the
nation's 10 provinces into
guaranteeing liberties. The
Supreme Court of Canada, for
example, has ruled that the
legislation cannot prevent a
province from censoring
movies.

Trudeau wants to insert a bill
ot rights in the Canadian Con
stitution and, most important,
guarantee every Canadian the
right to an education and to
government services in either
French or English. He insists
that only these language rights
would fulfill his pledge last
spring to his fellow Quebecers
— that he would change the
Canadian constitution to their
benefit if they rejected
separatism in the Quebec re
ferendum, which they did.
There are several reasons,
some related, why Trudeau is
running into a good deal of
opposition.
The first is a strong conser
vatism in Canadian society that
trusts authority and the general
will of the majority and fails to
become impassioned over the
loss of rights by a few individu
als. An American newcomer to
Canada is quickly surprised to

find educated and thoughtful
Canadians defending censor
boards, libel legislation that
severely restricts what jour
nalists can say about public fi
gures, and the withholding of
information by government
agencies.
In a recent book, appro
priately titled, Deference to
Authority, Edgar 112 riedenberg,
a U.S. professor of education
who moved to Canada 10 years
ago in protest against the Viet
nam War, wrote, "What is
clearly absent from Canadian
political consciousness ... is
the conviction that the state
and its apparatus are the
natural enemies of freedom."
The book angered several
Canadian reviewers who ac
cused Friedenberg of failing to
understand that it is possible
for Canadians to maintain their
freedom without American in
stitutions.
