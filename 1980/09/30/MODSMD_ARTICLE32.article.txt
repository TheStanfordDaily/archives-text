## 'Rude Boy' sloppy at best

"We're an American band"
— Grand Funk Railroad
"We're a garage band"
— The Clash
The Clash, when they first
began playing together in 1976,
were the antithesis of slick
American bands like Grand
Funk: anything but commer
cial and as emphatically English
as a bombed-out pub or the
setting sun. But those were the
days of Gerald Ford and Harold
Wilson; these are . . not the
same days, and the Clash is not
the same Clash, having been
both canonized by Kasey
Kasem and drawn to Rock-a
billy, that primordial white
American rock and roll.
We now have a Clash with a
top-40 single and an outlook
increasingly across the Atlan
tic, "I'm So Bored With the
USA" notwithstanding. The
movie Rude Boy is in part a
documentation of that green
ing of the Clash, but it's also
the story of RayGangethe rude
boy, a young drunken Lon
doner who's on the dole and
who's a part-time worker in a
narrow hallway of a porn shop.
He's a friend of the Clash,
and in a modern version of the
old "42nd Street" story, helps
out during a concert power fai
lure, wins a job as a roadie,
loses his job, and, in a modern
version of the old "A Star is
Born" story, declines into

further drunkenness while the
Clash continues its rise to fancy
light shows and an impending
American tour. So the Clash is
only rock and roll and Ray
Gange is but a slovenly succes
sion of Hollywood musicals.
What makes Rude Boy in
teresting, and gives it what
power it has, is the tact that Ray
Gange is played by Ray Gange
who is a young drunken Lon
doner, who's on the dole, and
who works part-time in a porn
shop ar.d roadied briefly for
the Clash. Even Woodv Allen
cannot compete with Ray's
ability to portray himselt on sc
reen.
The plot is negligible and the
filmmakers, jack Hazam and
David Mingay, have seemingly
been content to just let the
cameras roll and make sure
that things are somewhat
chronological while Ray re
creates his life. It's an odd
blend of both docudrama and
cinema verite as the filming
takes place on actual Clash
tours, atactual Clash recording
sessions, and in actual porno
shops,all of which leads toalot
of mental doubletracking.
Perhaps the oddest scene
occurs at London's Rock
Against Racism concert: after
the Clash leaves the stage, Ray
loses control and leads the au
dience in encore cheers until
the more sedate leftist or

ganizers of the concert drag
him off-stage and then push
the film crew's cameras over
with a flabby palm that covers
the entire screen as the film
goes black.
The casualness and objectiv
ity of Rude Boy are helpful, in
theory at least, because they
allow the audience to form its
own judgements instead of be
manipulated in the way that
more conventional filmmakers
tend toward; the approach is
perfect for what is basically a
feature-length documentary.
But what are missing are large
chunks of background and
explanation.
In one segment the Clash are
shown in concert and then the
film cuts directly to the band
exiting from a magistrate's of
fice. At times Hazam and Min
gay seem to have deliberately
chosen to eliminate the transi
tions, but more often the con
fusion results because of the
poor quality of the sound
track: the honest-to-God
working class British accents of
the film are hard enough for
the American ear to decipher,
and even harder when over
whelmed by street noise; the
audience, thanks to Dolby, is
treated to stereo renditions of
lorry engines that utterly an
nihilate the dialogue.
Most inexcusably, the tech

nical sloppiness of Rude Boy
extends to the concert scenes
themselves, where the sound
is both muddled and poorly
mixed, a very unfortunate oc
currence as music is what most
of the audience will attend for.
At least there are some good
close-ups of lead singer Joe
Strummer's mangled teeth and
voluminous spittle.
For all their faults, and Rude
Boy is, in parts, an incredibly
dull and confusing film, Hazam
and Mingay must be given cre
dit for producing an original
movie about a difficult subject
(the decaying Ray apparently
had to be wheedled and
cajoled into completing the
film). And the Clash ought to
be admired for allowing them
selves to be put under the
scrutiny that Rude Boy pro
vides. The movie, more than
anything else, attempts to por
tray the depressed proletariat
milieu that produced Ray, the
Clash, and the Clash's politics
— for the Clash is a very politi
cal band.
But like the numerous cam
paign posters shown in close
up throughout the film, the

Clash's message is short,
clever, and essentially shallow.
The band believes in what they
sing — these are no media
sharpies taking advantage of
working class anger — but
while they express that anger,
the Clash does little or nothing
with it.
In one scene their music in
spires a meaty, head-banging

orgy, but that's as tar as the
music goes; the Clash ends up
being somewhat impotent,
unable to stop the frenzy or to
channel it into something
more productive. Is this kind of
working class rage — the
Clash's and their audience's —
really any different than Beatle
— and/or Monkee — mania?
And while the Clash sings of

oppression, Ray wastes his life,
receiving no help even when
he turns to the band.
Of course it's hard to distin
guish the fact from the fiction
in a movie like Rude Boy, but
one is left wondering if maybe
the more successful and slicker
Clash is an improvement on
the old garage band, and
perhaps a more honest one.
