# 'Ordinary' extraordinary film

### Perry Tribolet 
Robert Redford is a very intelligent
filmmaker. His recent movie, Ordinary
People, demonstrates his full talent better
than any of his previous work.
Redford presciently purchased the
rights to Ordinary People long before it
became a best-selling novel. The decision
to make the film his directorial debut was
also extremely prudent. And as casting
overseer, his judgment was inspired.
Ordinary People is a sincere, honest film
which considers a middle-class family with
first-class emotional problems. It suc
ceeds marvelously as an entertaining, en
grossing and enlightening film that almost
everyone will enjoy.
The story is set and beautifully photo
graphed in peaceful Lake Forest, Illinois.
Life is fairly smooth for Conrad (a teenage
boy) and his family until his older brother,
Buck, drowns in a boating accident. Buck
was the pride of the family, being a good
student and a fantastic athlete. And his
mother worshipped him.
Conrad's mother spends all of her love
on Buck and leaves little affection for her

younger son. Conrad's father feels that
Conrad can take life on his own and gives
little attention to his younger son's prob
lems. Unfortunately, Conrad needs quite
a bit of attention; since the accident he has
learned to blame himself for Buck's un
timely death.
Guilt is rarely dealt with in film, largely
because the subject is such a difficult one.
Nonetheless it is an important part of our
culture, and it is very exciting to see it
handled so well in a movie. Early in child
hood, some of us learn to accept more
than our share of responsibility for what
goes wrong in life. Others learn to avoid
accepting responsibility at all. Both of
these types of people are unhealthy and
usually feed on each other. Ordinary
People examined ordinary people such as
these.
Redford's film also touches on the ques
tion, what is personal strength? The
cinematic answer is, the ability to face up
to reality, for only those who face life as it
really is can deal with it adequately. The
trick is that this requires a substantial de
gree of flexibility, because reality is not

always the way we wish things to be. The
paradox, of course, is that anyone who
wants to be truly strong must be weak
enough to accept life's shortcomings.
Redford's first attempt at directing could
hardly be better. His flaws are few: awk
ward low shots near the beginning and a
short scene with foreground/background
focusing problems. The director proves
that he understands drama well, and does
a superb job overall.
The acting is exceptional. Mary Tyler
Moore makes the transition from comedy
to drama easily and Donald Sutherland
rises to the occasion in one of his best
roles. The younger actors, Elizabeth
McCovern and Timothy Hutton (son of )im
Hutton), make startling debuts themselves
in flawless performances.
Ordinary People is an ambitious project
that works. It is a sensitive film that in
volves the moviegoer in the tremendous
problems its main characters have to deal
with. It is satisfying to watch because, dur
ing the course of the film, Conrad's family
comes far in learning more about itself.
Co see it.
