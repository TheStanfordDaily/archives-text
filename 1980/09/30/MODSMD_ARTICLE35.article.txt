## Experimental art on campus 
### 
Symmetrical, restrained and
precise, Matt Kahn's paintings
share a formality which the ar
tist attributes to his many visits
to Italy — he has taught at Stan
ford's Italian campus on five
different occasions. Recent
paintings by Kahn, professorof
art at Stanford, will be on view
in the Stanford Art Gallery from
Sept. 30 to Nov. 30. The exhibi
tion will include some 40 ac
rylic paintings on shaped can
vas.
In 1976, Kahn's work was
exhibited at the Galleria Gior
gio in Florence. In a critique of
that exhibition, Alfred Fran
kenstein observed that
"Kahn's common theme is
synthesis. Synthesis of struc
ture and illusion, of idea and
feeling, of figurative and
abstract. He has invented an art
balanced perfectly on the edge
between painting and design."
Circular or oval in form, the
pieces are composed of finely
drawn parallel lines set against
mists of graded color. Several
pieces comprise more than
one canvas; these are either
bolted together or hung as a
group.
Many of the works have
been constructed with enough
depth to form conical cavities
which the artist has exploited
to imply an energy within. In
all, Kahn's paintings play with
real and implied space while at
the same time displaying an
expressive range that is both
humorous, as in the painting
Orang, and reflective, as in

Menorah V.
Born in New York City in
1928, Professor Kahn began his
art education at Manhattan's
High School of Music and Art,
and continued it at Cranbrook
Academy in Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan. He has been teach
ing in the Art Department here
since 1949.
His work has been exhibited
widely, including one-man
shows at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, Syn
tex Gallery in Palo Alto, and the
Van Doren Gallery in San Fran
cisco.
He is also well-known as a
designer of relief tapestries
and, in collaboration with Lyda
Kahn, of public interior spaces
in medical, recreational, and
community centers. Kahn sees
his three professional iden
tities of painting, designing
and teaching as compatible

expressions of a common set
of values.
On view at the University
Museum of Art from Sept. 30
through Nov. 2 is an exhibition
of designs by the Italian
Futurist Giacomo Balla for the
Diaghilev-Stravinsky ballet
Fireworks.
Balla (1871-1958), a figure of
pivotal importance to the Ita
lian avant-garde, sought to
create a revolutionary and
"universal" art which would
help restore spirituality to a
world dominated by technol
ogy. In conception and execu
tion Balla's art was highly ex
perimental, as can be seen in
his designs for Fireworks.
In 1917 Serge Diaghilev
staged a ballet to a short com
position by Stravinsky and
asked Balla to design the pro

duction, to "do something
with Futurist methods, colors,
dance and costumes." For this
plotless ballet which had no
human dancers, Balla created
free-standing geometric forms
covered in colored canvas
which were placed in front of
an austere black back-drop.
Across these abstract
shapes, shafts of light and
color played, both in rhythm
and in counterpoint to the
music. Diaghilev himself di
rected the flow of light from a
keyboard in the prompter's
box. The revolutionary ballet
of light and color lasted for
four minutes.
Balla's designs have recently
been exhibited at the Spoleto
Festival in Charleston and after
their showing here will travel
to New York.

His work has been exhibited
widely, including one-man
shows at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, Syn
tex Gallery in Palo Alto, and the
Van Doren Gallery in San Fran
cisco.
He is also well-known as a
designer of relief tapestries
and, in collaboration with Lyda
Kahn, of public interior spaces
in medical, recreational, and
community centers. Kahn sees
his three professional iden
tities of painting, designing
and teaching as compatible

expressions of a common set
of values.
On view at the University
Museum of Art from Sept. 30
through Nov. 2 is an exhibition
of designs by the Italian
Futurist Giacomo Balla for the
Diaghilev-Stravinsky ballet
Fireworks.
Balla (1871-1958), a figure of
pivotal importance to the Ita
lian avant-garde, sought to
create a revolutionary and
"universal" art which would
help restore spirituality to a
world dominated by technol
ogy. In conception and execu
tion Balla's art was highly ex
perimental, as can be seen in
his designs for Fireworks.
In 1917 Serge Diaghilev
staged a ballet to a short com
position by Stravinsky and
asked Balla to design the pro

duction, to "do something
with Futurist methods, colors,
dance and costumes." For this
plotless ballet which had no
human dancers, Balla created
free-standing geometric forms
covered in colored canvas
which were placed in front of
an austere black back-drop.
Across these abstract
shapes, shafts of light and
color played, both in rhythm
and in counterpoint to the
music. Diaghilev himself di
rected the flow of light from a
keyboard in the prompter's
box. The revolutionary ballet
of light and color lasted for
four minutes.
Balla's designs have recently
been exhibited at the Spoleto
Festival in Charleston and after
their showing here will travel
to New York.
