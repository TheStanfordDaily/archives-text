Carter seeks U.S. aid to Saudis
Washington — President Jimmy Carter sum
moned congressional leaders to the White House
late yesterday amid indications he will soon dis
patch U.S. Air Force airborne warning and control
aircraft to Saudi Arabia to aid the air defense of the
Persian Gulf.
Lawmakers who took part in the special 1 '/2-hour
briefing by the president and his senior advisers
forecast an announcement soon of new U.S. ef
forts in the Iraq-Iran crisis.
Defense officials said the deployment of the
U.S. air-defense aircraft to Saudi Arabia is highly
likely, but that a final decision awaits the approval
of an announcement acceptable to both coun
tries.
It was unclear last night whether the Saudis re
quested the deployment or whether it was a U.S.
initiative.
Yesterday afternoon's White House meeting —
involving Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, Sec
retary of Detense Harold Brown, CIA Director
Stansfield Turner, Presidential Assistant Zbigniew
Brzezinski and other top officials in addition to
Carter — was the latest of a series of top-level
conclaves over the past two days regarding the
continuing war in the Persian Gulf.
U.S. consideration of the military deployment
followed increasingly explicit threats by Iran to
take action against any Persian Gulf countries
cooperating with the military forces of its enemy,
Iraq. These statements have generated concern in
several small Persian Gulf oil sheikdoms, as well as
in Saudi Arabia, that Iran might bomb their oil
tields, refineries or other facilities in a new exten
sion of the Iraq-Iran war.
The Air Force planes called AWACS are mod
itied versions of the Boeing 707 jetliner and carry
sophisticated radars that can see electronically
about 250 miles in all directions. Thus, stationed
over Saudi territory, they could detect any
warplanes approaching the west side of the Per
sian Gulf and could assist in directing their inter
ception by defensive forces.
Oakland water supply menaced
Stockton — With millions of dollars in crops al
ready destroyed, another 45,000 acres and Oak
land's main water supply were threatened yester
day by river delta waters flooding through a levee
break believed caused by a too-busy beaver.
The break Friday night chased 200 island families
of Lower Jones Tract to high ground. Flooding
waters ruined their homes and destroyed some $5
million of ready-to-harvest corn, tomatoes, beets,
asparagus, potatoes and millet.
By Sunday, the below-sea-level island was under
25 feet of water. The weekend found residents
ranged on levee roads with whatever furniture and
personal belongings they could rescue from their
houses. Hundreds of seasonal workers ready to
harvest crops were without jobs.
Only a fragile levee protecting a 5 1 2-mile strip of
Santa Fe Railroad track stood between the rolling,
muddy waters of the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta and another 45,000 acres of flooding,
officials say.
The track is all that protects three aqueducts of
the East Bay Municipal Utilities District 40 yards
away. They supply drinking water to more than a
million residents of Contra Costa and Alameda
counties, east of San Francisco.
The emergency site is 40 miles east of San Fran
cisco. The Delta is a San Francisco Bay tributary
system comprising about 1000 miles of rivers, cuts,
sloughs and basins flushed by tidal action through
the Golden Gate.

FDA seeks warning on tampons
Washington — The Food and Drug Administra
tion said yesterday it has asked five major tampon
manufacturers to put warning labels voluntarily on
all boxes and brands of tampons.
The agency reiterated its plans to propose a rule
requiring a label warning women that tampons
pose a risk of the rare but deadly disease called
toxic shock syndrome.
In the meantime, it has sent telegrams to the
manufacturers "strongly recommending" that
they add the warning now "as a responsible con
sumer protection step on your part."
The agency suggested this wording:
"Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but seri
ous disease that can occur in menstruating wo
men. TSS can cause death. The disease has been
associated with the use of tampons. You may
therefore want to consider not using tampons or
alternating tampons with napkins.
"If you develop high fever and vomiting or
diarrhea during your menstrual period, you
should remove your tampon immediately and talk
to a physician."
FDA spokesman Wayne Pines said the telegrams
went out over the weekend to the heads of Inter
national Playtex, maker of Playtex tampon; Tarn
pax, maker of Tampax; Kimberly-Clark, Kotex;
Johnson & Johnson, OB; Campana, Pursettes.
A sixth manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, re
cently recalled all of its Rely tampons and is prepar
ing to launch a major advertising campaign to tell
women not to use them.
Studies indicated Rely was used by an unusually
high percentage of women who got the disease.
But the syndrome has also been found in women
who used other brands and in some men.
It said the Center for Disease Control has
learned of more than 300 of the cases since
January, with 28 of them ending in death.
"Although the studies identified Rely as the
tampon most associated with TSS, all brands of
tampons seem also to be associated with TSS," it
said.
U.S. too dependent on oil imports
Washington — The United States is no more pre
pared fora disruption in foreign oil supplies than it
was in 1979 when the Iranian revolution slowed
imports, accordingto a new congressional report.
The report, released yesterday by the Govern
ment Operations subcommittee on energy and
the environment, said emergency energy plan
ning in the United States is "woefully inadequate
at all levels of government."
Rep. Toby Moffett (D-Conn.), chairman of the
subcommittee, noted that the study was prepared
before the outbreak of war between Iran and Iraq.
But he said the war creates exactly the kind of
conditions that the report warns about.
The report says that well over a year after the
Iranian revolution brought about long lines at ser
vice stations and sent prices soaring, planning for
energy emergencies is still low on the nation's list
of priorities.
Moffett said the subcommittee investigation de
termined that only one state, Nebraska, has drawn
up a formal energy conservation plan. Other states
are preparing plans but need technical guidance
and federal money to complete them, he said.
The report said U.S. dependency on oil imports
means the nation, "faces the constant threat of a
major supply disruption." The report said, "The
United States is not prepared to respond to an
energy emergency in a timely and coordinated
manner."
The subcommittee headed by Moffett is to

begin hearings today on the effect the Iran-Iraq
war could have on U.S. energy supplies.
League cancels veep debate
Washington — The proposed debate between
the three vice presidential candidates was can
celed by the League of Women Voters yesterday
when only Patrick Lucey agreed to show up for the
encounter in Louisville, Ky., Thursday.
Some political observers had hoped that even if
there was no three-way debate among the presi
dential contenders, there still might be a session
with the No. 2 candidates: Vice President Walter
Mondale, Republican George Bush and Lucey, the
running mate of independent John Anderson.
But the proposed Louisville debate fell victim to
the continuing dispute over the format of any
further presidential meetings — if there are to be
any.
"Although we proposed the vice presidential
debate as part of our debate series, acceptance
was not tied to an agreement by the presidential
candidates to debate," said Ruther Hinerfeld, di
rector of the league's education fund, which
proposed holding the debates.
"However, representatives of the Carter-
Mondale campaign committee and those of the
Reagan-Bush campaign committee linked their ac
ceptance of our invitatjon ot a vice presidential
debate to their acceptance of a presidential debate
package," she said.
In the latest episode of this political soap opera,
President Jimmy Carter agreed to debate Reagan
one-on-one followed by a three-way meeting with
Reagan and Anderson. Reagan refused, saying that
Anderson should be included in any presidential
debate.
The dates on the league's calendar, if not on
those of the candidates, are Oct. 13 in Portland,
Ore., and Oct. 27 in Cleveland. The only debate so
far was between Anderson and Reagan in Balti
more on Sept. 21.
Vaccine found to fight hepatitis
New York — Hospital workers, kidney patients,
drug abusers and people who are sexually promis
cuous are among the diverse group of Americans
expected to benefit from an experimental new
vaccine against hepatitis B.
Results of the first large-sc.le study of the vac
cine, released Sunday, show it virtually eliminates
the risk of the viral liver disease that may afflict
200,000 Americans a year.
In the two-year study, which was directed by Dr.
Wolf Szmuness of New York Blood Center,
hepatitis was reduced by 92 percent among vacci
nated members of a group of 1083 homosexual
volunteers.
Hepatitis B can be sexually transmitted and is a
hazard to both homosexuals and heterosexuals
who have many sex partners, doctors said.
Continued success with the vaccine may lead to
routine immunization of doctors, nurses, hospital
employees, kidney patients and others consi
dered likely to get the disease, said Dr. Donald
Francis of the national Center for Disease Con
trol's hepatitis group in Phoenix, Ariz.
Mideast war plummets market
New York — The stock market recorded sharp
losses yesterday, the third straight day of declines,
and traders attributed the slump to rising interest
rates and strife in the Middle East.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
plunged 18.17 points to 921.93, the largest tumble
since the blue-chip average dropped 19.71 on
March 24.
