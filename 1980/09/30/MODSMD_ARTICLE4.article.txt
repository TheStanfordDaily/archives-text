# Management 'union busting' blasted at meeting
## Cowell nurses discuss labor grievances 
### 
By Mike Vaska
Registered nurses at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and the University's
Cowell Student Health Center, work
ing without a contract since )an. 31,
met yesterday to discuss options av
ailable to them in their contract dis
pute with the clinic's management.
The nurses, who say they are frus
trated by management's refusal to
bargain with their new union, are
considering various options includ
ing a strike or a drop of their affilia
tion with the national union in their
efforts to bring speedy resolve to the
labor dispute, according to Helen
Lamathe, union spokesperson and
registered nurse at the clinic.
A National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) administrative law judge's
decision earlier this month ordered
the clinic to negotiate with the
nurses. The clinic has opted to ap
peal the decision instead, according
to Bert Rose, spokesperson for the
clinic.
Nurses have accused the clinic of
using delaying tactics and the ser
vices of "union busting" legal rep
resentation in an effort to sever their
new affiliation with the Federation of
Nurses and Health Professionals
(FNHP).
"I am convinced that (Arthur)
Mendelson (managementcounsel) is
trying to break our union," Lamathe
said. He is using delaying tactics in
court to "drag things out so our
members become frustrated and dis
illusioned," she said.
Union busting?
The law firm retained by the clinic
to handle labor negotiations, Littler,
Mendelson, Fastiff and Tichy, has
been blacklisted by the Alameda
County Labor Council for "their
union-busting tactics," according to
a press release written by Kathy
North of the Registered Nurses
Council.

Clinic counsel Mendelson denied
charges that either his firm or man
agement is trying to break the union,
but he admitted the appeal process
may take more than a year to com
plete.
The nurses say they fear that man
agement may use economic coer
cion to force them to abandon their
national affiliation, jan Lahr, union
spokesperson and Cowell nurse
said.
The clinic is still honoring the ex
pired contract which grants pay in
creases based on time at the job, ac
cording to Rose. However, the
nurses at the top of the scale have not
received a raise since 1979, Lahr said.
Non-union employees received an
percent cost of living raise in July,
a raise denied the members of the
RNC.
Nurses have filed an unfair labor
practices suit with the NLRB because
of this action, according to Lahr.
Dispute
The dispute began last year when
nurses at the clinic and Cowell, who
were members of the Registered
Nurses Council, voted to affilitate
themselves with the Federation of
Nurses and Health Professionals of
the American Federation of
Teachers, AFL-CIO.
Management contends that all
members of the bargaining unit were
not included in the vote, and thus
management's obligation to
negotiate with the RNC ended when
the nurses affiliated with the FNHP,
Rose said.
"The dispute is not an open and
shut legal matter by any means," said
Mendelson. There are legal prece
dents in other courts around which
indicated management would be
correct in its assertion, he added.
The majority of the registered
nurses at Cowell and the clinic are
dues paying members and a majority

voted for the union, Lamathe said.
"Clinic management is trying to
deny us our right to choose our
union affiliation," she said. "They
had no qualms about our leadership
when it was local and ineffective,"
Lamathe said. The nurses formerly
were unaffiliated with a national un
ion, and felt they didn't have the re
sources to bargain effectively with
the clinic, she said.
Nurses feel they are underpaid for
jobs they perform, Lahr said. Stan
ford University Hospital registered
nurses are paid 21 percent more than
RNC members, she said.
"We want to be paid at rates com
parable to the community," Lahr
said. "Some nurses have very large
responsibilities," she added. The
night staff at Cowell, for instance,
works without doctors in the center,

Lahr said.
The nurses generally are paid
commensurate with their abilities;
however, it is not clear whether they
now are paid adequately because
they haven't received a raise since
last year, Rose said.
Tension at clinic
There is a tremendous amount of
tension at the clinic because of the
uncertain situation, Lamathe said, al
though it is not affecting patient care.
If a strike were to be called, the
absence of the RNC's 57 nurses from
Cowell and the Clinic would be a
hardship on both, Rose said.
Nurses are not planning to strike in
the immediate future, but will con
tinue to hold informational meet
ings, Lamathe said.
The meeting yesterday attracted 27
RNC members, she said.

The dispute began last year when
nurses at the clinic and Cowell, who
were members of the Registered
Nurses Council, voted to affilitate
themselves with the Federation of
Nurses and Health Professionals of
the American Federation of
Teachers, AFL-CIO.
Management contends that all
members of the bargaining unit were
not included in the vote, and thus
management's obligation to
negotiate with the RNC ended when
the nurses affiliated with the FNHP,
Rose said.
"The dispute is not an open and
shut legal matter by any means," said
Mendelson. There are legal prece
dents in other courts around which
indicated management would be
correct in its assertion, he added.
The majority of the registered
nurses at Cowell and the clinic are
dues paying members and a majority

voted for the union, Lamathe said.
"Clinic management is trying to
deny us our right to choose our
union affiliation," she said. "They
had no qualms about our leadership
when it was local and ineffective,"
Lamathe said. The nurses formerly
were unaffiliated with a national un
ion, and felt they didn't have the re
sources to bargain effectively with
the clinic, she said.
Nurses feel they are underpaid for
jobs they perform, Lahr said. Stan
ford University Hospital registered
nurses are paid 21 percent more than
RNC members, she said.
"We want to be paid at rates com
parable to the community," Lahr
said. "Some nurses have very large
responsibilities," she added. The
night staff at Cowell, for instance,
works without doctors in the center,

Lahr said.
The nurses generally are paid
commensurate with their abilities;
however, it is not clear whether they
now are paid adequately because
they haven't received a raise since
last year, Rose said.
Tension at clinic
There is a tremendous amount of
tension at the clinic because of the
uncertain situation, Lamathe said, al
though it is not affecting patient care.
If a strike were to be called, the
absence of the RNC's 57 nurses from
Cowell and the Clinic would be a
hardship on both, Rose said.
Nurses are not planning to strike in
the immediate future, but will con
tinue to hold informational meet
ings, Lamathe said.
The meeting yesterday attracted 27
RNC members, she said.

Registered nurses at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and the University's
Cowell Student Health Center, work
ing without a contract since )an. 31,
met yesterday to discuss options av
ailable to them in their contract dis
pute with the clinic's management.
The nurses, who say they are frus
trated by management's refusal to
bargain with their new union, are
considering various options includ
ing a strike or a drop of their affilia
tion with the national union in their
efforts to bring speedy resolve to the
labor dispute, according to Helen
Lamathe, union spokesperson and
registered nurse at the clinic.
A National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) administrative law judge's
decision earlier this month ordered
the clinic to negotiate with the
nurses. The clinic has opted to ap
peal the decision instead, according
to Bert Rose, spokesperson for the
clinic.
Nurses have accused the clinic of
using delaying tactics and the ser
vices of "union busting" legal rep
resentation in an effort to sever their
new affiliation with the Federation of
Nurses and Health Professionals
(FNHP).
"I am convinced that (Arthur)
Mendelson (managementcounsel) is
trying to break our union," Lamathe
said. He is using delaying tactics in
court to "drag things out so our
members become frustrated and dis
illusioned," she said.
Union busting?
The law firm retained by the clinic
to handle labor negotiations, Littler,
Mendelson, Fastiff and Tichy, has
been blacklisted by the Alameda
County Labor Council for "their
union-busting tactics," according to
a press release written by Kathy
North of the Registered Nurses
Council.

Clinic counsel Mendelson denied
charges that either his firm or man
agement is trying to break the union,
but he admitted the appeal process
may take more than a year to com
plete.
The nurses say they fear that man
agement may use economic coer
cion to force them to abandon their
national affiliation, jan Lahr, union
spokesperson and Cowell nurse
said.
The clinic is still honoring the ex
pired contract which grants pay in
creases based on time at the job, ac
cording to Rose. However, the
nurses at the top of the scale have not
received a raise since 1979, Lahr said.
Non-union employees received an
percent cost of living raise in July,
a raise denied the members of the
RNC.
Nurses have filed an unfair labor
practices suit with the NLRB because
of this action, according to Lahr.
