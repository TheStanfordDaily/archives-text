# Coffee House changes bring new look, profits
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Although the Coftee House has
long been considered a haven for
bohemians, turkey & avocado on
whole-wheat sandwich lovers, and
students merely interested in a lively
place to meet friends, it was only
since last May 1 that the Coffee
House became what it was originally
— a student-run enterprise.
And it was only as recently as Au
gust that the student-run Coffee
House began to show a profit.
When the ASSU won control of the
Coffee House last spring after several
years of outside management, the
leaders of the corporation promised
lower prices, larger meat portions on
sandwiches, a greater variety of en

tertainment and food, a liquor
license, and a cozier decor.
They appear to have made good on
their promises.
According to Council of Presidents
member Dick Butterfield, president
of the 10-member Coffee House
board of directors, the physical lay
out of the interior has been and will
continue to undergo revision to help
speed up the lines in the serving
area.
Hanging plants adorn the walls.
Countertops have been lacquered to
ease cleanup. A microwave oven was
purchased to heat up pastries and to
provide hot meal service.
Soups and juice
Juice machines, a daily choice oi
soups and a new line of specialty cof
fees are some of the innovations stu
dents can look forward to in the
months to come, Butterfield said.
As for finances, after a more than
$2000 deficit in May, June and July,
the Coffee House turned an almost
$300 profit in August, according to
Steve Weiss, the Coffee House's
full-time manager.
Weiss said he is hopeful "we'll
continuously run in the black.
However, he insists "we're not trying
to make lots of money — we're trying
to break even."
According to Butterfield, "we'll lie
happy in our first year to teeter the
line between red and black."
Business experience
And unlike the old Coffee House,
whose finances were managed by
outside contractors, the ASSU Cof
fee House offers students an oppor
tunity for hands-on business experi
ence. As an example, Butterfield
cited the appointment of recent
Stanford graduate Scott Sanford to
the post of business manager.
Clientele
Clientele response to the new Cot
fee House has been largely favora
ble.
"The concept of a student-run Cot
fee House is a good thing," said Don
Caughey, Asst. Dean of Memorial
Church and Coffee House fre
quenter. "It gives students some
ownership of the action."
Caughey said he was especially
impressed by the "greater line ot
quality beers," but said he would b«'
much happier if alcoholic beverages
were allowed outside the Coffee
