# Renovation set to begin this week
## Storey House: ashes to ashes to a livable dorm? 
### Monika Guttman 
The first steps toward the re
construction of Storey House
begin this week as construction of
a protective roof gets underway.
According to Philip Leighton,
project manager of facilities and
properties for the University, dur
ing the next five to six weeks there
will be work progressing on
Storey House to protect it from
winter rains.
First, the fire-damaged remains
above the third floor will be de
molished and then a simple frame
will be constructed, over which a
tarpulin roof will be installed.
The project will cost $20,000.
Leighton said schematic plans
for reconstruction of the house
will be submitted to the Board of
Trustees in October.
"Storey House will be recon
structed in the shell that was not
totally lost as a result of fire or
water damage," he said. "It will
have the feeling of what it was."
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson said that if the
plans are approved by the Board,
construction would begin in
January. The goal would be to use
Storey House for student resi
dence by next September.
Leighton estimated total recon

struction cost at $1.5 million.
Plans for the new Storey House
include co-ed facilities such as
two bathrooms on each floor.
"If you're putting this much
money into the house, you have
to keep the options open," said
Director of the Row Diana Con
klin. "No discussion has been
made on the issue of whether or
not Storey House would house all
women again."
Robinson said he hadn't really
given the question any thought.
"Before I make a recommenda
tion I'd look at the housing de
mands and at the draw results for
the past few years," said Conklin.
"I think the cutoff draw number
for Roth House (the only other
all-women's dorm on campus)
was pretty high."
The plans for the new Storey
House will facilitate five more
people in the house, Leighton
said. It will now house 44 stu
dents, whereas previously 39
could live there.
Half the funds for the new
building will come from Univer
sity insurance reserves and the
other half from a bond issue
which the Board of Trustees has
already approved, according to
Leighton.


Reconstruction of Storey House on the Row is planned to
begin this week, University planners say. The house,

which was damaged by fire in March, is supposed to be
ready for next year's housing draw.
