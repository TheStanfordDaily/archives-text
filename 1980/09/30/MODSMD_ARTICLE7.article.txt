## Stalemate predicted in Gulf conflict 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut — The week-long con
flict between Iraq and Iran may
be tar more difficult to resolve
than at first envisioned, Middle
East diplomatic and military
analysts said Saturday.
Attheendof thefirstweekof
the undeclared war, neither
side seems capable of a deci
sive victory — leading most
diplomats here to fear a kind of
stalemate involving intermit
tent hostilities between the
two Persian Gulf nations that
would affect the continuing
stability of the Middle East —
and its oil flow to the non-
Communist world.
The reason expressed here
for the lack of optimism for an
early settlement to the conflict
is Iraq's failure to strike deci
sively against Iranian strategic
targets and capture them.
At the weekend, the Iraqis
claimed to have pressed into
Iran for some 50 miles, out
flanking the key cities of Khor
ramshahr and Abadan on the
critical Shatt al Arab waterway
that separates the countries.
But Iran claims that in a
week's heavy fighting Iraq has
still failed to capture Khorram
shahr, the chief port of Iran in
the northern end of the Persian
Gulf.
It is the Iraqis' apparent fai
lure to take the port that has
led some observers to specu
late that the vaunted Iraqi
military machine has not per
formed as well on the ground
as expected.
And there is some question
raised here, too, as to just what
strategic goals the Baghdad

government of President Sad
dam Hussein has in mind.
Whatever those goals, they
have not apparently been at
tained so far, military analysts
here say. And further, the Ira
nian defense has put up a
much more stubborn fight
than the Iraqis had bargained
on.
Then, too, the Iranian air
force is still active in the skies.
And far from being knocked
out in the first days of fighting
or grounded through lack of
skilled technicians and spare
parts, Iranian F-4 Phantoms
continue to carry out daily
bombing missions over Iraqi
cities, striking the capital of
Baghdad, and oil installations
at Basra in the south and Kirkuk
in the north.
Those raids, in fact, have
done so much damage to Iraqi
oil-producing and transmis
sion facilities that the Iraqi
government announced Friday
it is no longer exporting oil by
pipeline until the hostilities
have ended. Shipments by sea
were halted earlier in the
week.
At the beginning of the war,
the Iraqi military scenario
seemed to call for a lightning
ground assault led by Soviet
made tanks across the flat
ground near the Shatt al Arab
to capture Khorramshahr and
Abadan, where the world's
fourth largest refinery is lo
cated. It produces half of Iran's
domestic gasoline and
kerosene.
The armored thrust, in addi
tion to securing the east side of
the Shatt al Arab waterway, was

also intended to demoralize
the Tehran government, lead
ing to the overthrow of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
diplomatic sources said.
Though each side on paper
was fairly evenly matched on
the ground, the Iranian army
was thought to have been
eviscerated by the revolution
— with much of the officer
corps executed or cashiered,
and the sophisticated equip
ment rusting for lack of
maintenance and spare parts.
The Iraqis, on the other
hand, were thought to be effi
ciently led, with modern Soviet
equipment manned by troops
with high morale.
But despite initial successes,
the Iraqi army does not yet
seem to have occupied the key
cities in Iran, although reliable
information from the
battlefield is still sketchy.
The failure of the Iraqis to
achieve all-out victory in the
first week has encouraged the
regime in Tehran to hang
tough and reject any peace
overtures by the United Na
tions or other mediators that
do not ensure the immediate
return of all occupied Iranian
territory.
In many ways, Iran, a nation
of about 35 million to 40million
people, is in a better position
to face a protracted war than
Iraq, with only 12 million.
Conversely, Iraq has more to
lose, because the country de
pends heavily on its pet
rochemical industries.
So the leaders in Baghdad
would like a quick resolution
of the war, diplomatic sources

agreed, while the Iranian offi
cials have no interest in sur
rendering any territory in
negotiations.
It is possible, sources here
say, that the Iraqi forces may
yet decisively defeat the Ira
nian army, and even force the
overthrow of the Khomeini re
gime.
But even if the Iraqis occupy
much of the oil territory in
Khuzistan province they must
still win the support of the
ethnic Arab Iranians or face a
difficult and costly occupation
in the long run, the sources
concluded.

stability of the Middle East —
and its oil flow to the non-
Communist world.
The reason expressed here
for the lack of optimism for an
early settlement to the conflict
is Iraq's failure to strike deci
sively against Iranian strategic
targets and capture them.
At the weekend, the Iraqis
claimed to have pressed into
Iran for some 50 miles, out
flanking the key cities of Khor
ramshahr and Abadan on the
critical Shatt al Arab waterway
that separates the countries.
But Iran claims that in a
week's heavy fighting Iraq has
still failed to capture Khorram
shahr, the chief port of Iran in
the northern end of the Persian
Gulf.
It is the Iraqis' apparent fai
lure to take the port that has
led some observers to specu
late that the vaunted Iraqi
military machine has not per
formed as well on the ground
as expected.
And there is some question
raised here, too, as to just what
strategic goals the Baghdad

government of President Sad
dam Hussein has in mind.
Whatever those goals, they
have not apparently been at
tained so far, military analysts
here say. And further, the Ira
nian defense has put up a
much more stubborn fight
than the Iraqis had bargained
on.
Then, too, the Iranian air
force is still active in the skies.
And far from being knocked
out in the first days of fighting
or grounded through lack of
skilled technicians and spare
parts, Iranian F-4 Phantoms
continue to carry out daily
bombing missions over Iraqi
cities, striking the capital of
Baghdad, and oil installations
at Basra in the south and Kirkuk
in the north.
Those raids, in fact, have
done so much damage to Iraqi
oil-producing and transmis
sion facilities that the Iraqi
government announced Friday
it is no longer exporting oil by
pipeline until the hostilities
have ended. Shipments by sea
were halted earlier in the
week.
At the beginning of the war,
the Iraqi military scenario
seemed to call for a lightning
ground assault led by Soviet
made tanks across the flat
ground near the Shatt al Arab
to capture Khorramshahr and
Abadan, where the world's
fourth largest refinery is lo
cated. It produces half of Iran's
domestic gasoline and
kerosene.
The armored thrust, in addi
tion to securing the east side of
the Shatt al Arab waterway, was

also intended to demoralize
the Tehran government, lead
ing to the overthrow of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
diplomatic sources said.
Though each side on paper
was fairly evenly matched on
the ground, the Iranian army
was thought to have been
eviscerated by the revolution
— with much of the officer
corps executed or cashiered,
and the sophisticated equip
ment rusting for lack of
maintenance and spare parts.
The Iraqis, on the other
hand, were thought to be effi
ciently led, with modern Soviet
equipment manned by troops
with high morale.
But despite initial successes,
the Iraqi army does not yet
seem to have occupied the key
cities in Iran, although reliable
information from the
battlefield is still sketchy.
The failure of the Iraqis to
achieve all-out victory in the
first week has encouraged the
regime in Tehran to hang
tough and reject any peace
overtures by the United Na
tions or other mediators that
do not ensure the immediate
return of all occupied Iranian
territory.
In many ways, Iran, a nation
of about 35 million to 40million
people, is in a better position
to face a protracted war than
Iraq, with only 12 million.
Conversely, Iraq has more to
lose, because the country de
pends heavily on its pet
rochemical industries.
So the leaders in Baghdad
would like a quick resolution
of the war, diplomatic sources

agreed, while the Iranian offi
cials have no interest in sur
rendering any territory in
negotiations.
It is possible, sources here
say, that the Iraqi forces may
yet decisively defeat the Ira
nian army, and even force the
overthrow of the Khomeini re
gime.
But even if the Iraqis occupy
much of the oil territory in
Khuzistan province they must
still win the support of the
ethnic Arab Iranians or face a
difficult and costly occupation
in the long run, the sources
concluded.
