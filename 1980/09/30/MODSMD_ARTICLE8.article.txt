# Aid relieves food crisis
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bangkok — The Cambodian food crisis ap
pears to be over, thanks mainly to a massive
international aid effort, which for all its
shortcomings, averted mass starvation and gave
the battered country a new lease on life.
Western relief agencies have been careful not
to emphasize the improvement for fear it will be
taken out of context, and that aid-giving nations
will shut off their donations. The relief agencies
warn that Cambodia will need more aid next
year.
But the situation has improved so dramatically
in the last two months that a senior Western
analyst who has been consistently pessimistic
was moved to say:
'There's no doubt about it. Things are better,
so much so that I'm feeling a little uppy. But I
won't uncross my fingers until December, when
the rice harvest is in."
Relief to relocate
Some of the smaller voluntary relief agencies
have moved on to other, more critical areas,
mainly in Africa. The International Committee of
the Red Cross, which with the United Nations
Children's Fund has shared the emergency re
lief burden, has indicated that it will quit the
food distribution business here and go back to
its traditional medical role.
At the same time, the Red Cross has reduced
its medical staff in refugee camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border, from 250 last spring to
142.
At one refugee camp hospital last week there
were five Red Cross doctors and only 20 pa
tients.
Studies by relief agencies have shown that
villages in Western Cambodia are as well-fed as
the average Thai village acrpss the border.
Fewer leaving
The most dramatic change is the sharp drop in
the number of Cambodians flocking to the Thai
border. This floating population has declined
from a peak of 500,000 to an estimated 100,000.
After dropping to zero when fighting broke
out between Vietnamese and Thai soldiers in
June, the number of oxcart arrivals at border rice
distribution stations has increased sharply in the
last two weeks.
But this is not a sign of hunger. Instead, offi
cials say, it reflects a desire for rice.
"Although there is enough secondary food
available, rice still is in short supply," one re
fugee worker said, "and to the Cambodians rice
is as necessary as bread to an American."
"There's a world of difference in the appear
ance of the people who come to the border,"
another source said. "In contrast to six or eight

months ago, they look well-fed and healthy.
Another thing is that you don't see so many
obviously malnourished children."
Starting this month, food distribution at the
border was placed on a twice-montly basis. A
few days ago, 5,700 oxcart drivers showed up at
Nong Chan, the majorfeeding station, to collect
200-pound bags of rice.
Black market
Refugee officials are aware that much of this
rice is sold and resold on what amounts to a
black market, but they reckon that what counts
is that rice is getting to Cambodians.
"If you shut down rice distribution and
clamped down on the black market trade across
the border, the entire population would melt
away into Cambodia," a Western offical ob
served.
"The sense of urgency is gone," an official
with long experience on the border said. "It's a
little difficult to-keep the juices up when you see
so many Cambodian refugees leaving the bor
der bent under the weight of cartons of cigaret
tes, bolts of cloth and even perfume."
He paused, then added thoughtfully, "It's
time for me to move on."
One senior official predicted that relief opera
tions on the border will be down to a bare
minimum by the end of the year.
Diplomatic sources said here last week that
the United Nations Children's Fund and the Red
Cross will officially announce their decision to
withdraw from cross-border food relief
operations at a Cambodian aid donors meeting
in New York City on Nov. 19.
No decision made
"Incorrect," said Knud Christensen,
Bangkok-based head of UNICEF's Cambodian
emergency relief group. Despite the dramatic
improvement in the food situation inside Cam
bodia, no final decision will be made until after
the current rice crop is harvested in December,
Christensen said.
"We are always reviewing the situation in
Cambodia but we would be very surprised if a
decision was made so soon," Aymon Frank, a
Red Cross spokesman, said.
Both officials said such a decision would de
pend on the findings of a United Nations Food
and Agriculture team that is scheduled to enter
Cambodia tomorrow for a month's study of the
situation.
Observers credit the natural resilience of the
Cambodian people for much of the recovery.
But they also give credit to the Vietnam-backed
Heng Samrin government in Phnom Penh for
becoming more cooperative in its relations with
relief organizations operating inside Cambodia.

minimum by the end of the year.
Diplomatic sources said here last week that
the United Nations Children's Fund and the Red
Cross will officially announce their decision to
withdraw from cross-border food relief
operations at a Cambodian aid donors meeting
in New York City on Nov. 19.
No decision made
"Incorrect," said Knud Christensen,
Bangkok-based head of UNICEF's Cambodian
emergency relief group. Despite the dramatic
improvement in the food situation inside Cam
bodia, no final decision will be made until after
the current rice crop is harvested in December,
Christensen said.
"We are always reviewing the situation in
Cambodia but we would be very surprised if a
decision was made so soon," Aymon Frank, a
Red Cross spokesman, said.
Both officials said such a decision would de
pend on the findings of a United Nations Food
and Agriculture team that is scheduled to enter
Cambodia tomorrow for a month's study of the
situation.
Observers credit the natural resilience of the
Cambodian people for much of the recovery.
But they also give credit to the Vietnam-backed
Heng Samrin government in Phnom Penh for
becoming more cooperative in its relations with
relief organizations operating inside Cambodia.
Bangkok — The Cambodian food crisis ap
pears to be over, thanks mainly to a massive
international aid effort, which for all its
shortcomings, averted mass starvation and gave
the battered country a new lease on life.
Western relief agencies have been careful not
to emphasize the improvement for fear it will be
taken out of context, and that aid-giving nations
will shut off their donations. The relief agencies
warn that Cambodia will need more aid next
year.
But the situation has improved so dramatically
in the last two months that a senior Western
analyst who has been consistently pessimistic
was moved to say:
'There's no doubt about it. Things are better,
so much so that I'm feeling a little uppy. But I
won't uncross my fingers until December, when
the rice harvest is in."
Relief to relocate
Some of the smaller voluntary relief agencies
have moved on to other, more critical areas,
mainly in Africa. The International Committee of
the Red Cross, which with the United Nations
Children's Fund has shared the emergency re
lief burden, has indicated that it will quit the
food distribution business here and go back to
its traditional medical role.
At the same time, the Red Cross has reduced
its medical staff in refugee camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border, from 250 last spring to
142.
At one refugee camp hospital last week there
were five Red Cross doctors and only 20 pa
tients.
Studies by relief agencies have shown that
villages in Western Cambodia are as well-fed as
the average Thai village acrpss the border.
Fewer leaving
The most dramatic change is the sharp drop in
the number of Cambodians flocking to the Thai
border. This floating population has declined
from a peak of 500,000 to an estimated 100,000.
After dropping to zero when fighting broke
out between Vietnamese and Thai soldiers in
June, the number of oxcart arrivals at border rice
distribution stations has increased sharply in the
last two weeks.
But this is not a sign of hunger. Instead, offi
cials say, it reflects a desire for rice.
"Although there is enough secondary food
available, rice still is in short supply," one re
fugee worker said, "and to the Cambodians rice
is as necessary as bread to an American."
"There's a world of difference in the appear
ance of the people who come to the border,"
another source said. "In contrast to six or eight

months ago, they look well-fed and healthy.
Another thing is that you don't see so many
obviously malnourished children."
Starting this month, food distribution at the
border was placed on a twice-montly basis. A
few days ago, 5,700 oxcart drivers showed up at
Nong Chan, the majorfeeding station, to collect
200-pound bags of rice.
Black market
Refugee officials are aware that much of this
rice is sold and resold on what amounts to a
black market, but they reckon that what counts
is that rice is getting to Cambodians.
"If you shut down rice distribution and
clamped down on the black market trade across
the border, the entire population would melt
away into Cambodia," a Western offical ob
served.
"The sense of urgency is gone," an official
with long experience on the border said. "It's a
little difficult to-keep the juices up when you see
so many Cambodian refugees leaving the bor
der bent under the weight of cartons of cigaret
tes, bolts of cloth and even perfume."
He paused, then added thoughtfully, "It's
time for me to move on."
