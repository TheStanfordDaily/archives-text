# IMF rejects Third World proposal
## 
### Washington Post 
The policy-making body of the Interna
tional Monetary Fund Sundayflatly turned
down as inflationary a demand by the
IMF's poorer members that the world's
monetary reserves be boosted next year
by an additional $7.8 billion.
Representatives of the Third World had
presented a series of demands to the so
called Interim Committee of the IMF — the
board that makes the key decisions — in
cluding a call for a supplementary alloca
tion of six billion Special Drawing Rights
(SDRs) in 1981. The Interim Committee
meeting was preliminary to the formal
convening this morning of the annual joint
session of the IMF and World Bank.
SDRs, each worth about $1.31, are a
paper monetary asset created by the IMF
for its 140 members, who share in the
money-creation according to their relative
economic status. For the three-year period
1979-81, an annual issue of four billion
SDRs, or about $5.2 billion annually, had
been created.

In their communique, issued Sunday
after a day-long Saturday session, the
Group of 24, a panel of finance ministers
representing the poor nations, had called
for a total SDR issue of 10 billion for 1981,
and continuing at that rate for the five-year
period beginning in 1982.
When asked if the group did not fear a
battle with those nations considering the
proposal inflationary, its chairman, S.M.
Essang, minister of finance for Nigeria,
told a reporter: "We're not judging issues,
it's just our duty to press our case."
Outlook 'Grim'
There was no disagreement among the
rich and poor nations that the world
economy has taken a turn for the worse
this year. The IMF officially labeled the
outlok as "grim." On all sides, financial
officials said they expected continued
high inflation, sluggish economic perfor
mance and uncertainty about energy
supplies and prices.
The rich nations stressed their willing
ness to expand and improve the lending

and aid functions of the two institutions
and outlined in a communique several
steps in that direction.
In essense, the response of the poor
nations was that even more help was
needed — and the creation of additional
reserves through SDRs was one element of
an elaborate series of proposals.
SDRs, available only to official govern
ments, are easily exchangeable through
central banks for actual hard currencies.
Basically, the argument advanced for an
increased flow of SDRs and other aid from
the rich nations was that the economic
situation had deteriorated sharply since
the end of 1978 — mostly as a result of oil
price increases, and that all countries, but
especially the poor ones, need the addi
tional liquid funds that SDRs can provide.
The industrial nations that control the
IMF, although sympathetic to some boost
in the four bill'on SDR rate beginning in
1982, were not ready to go so quickly to
issuing 10 billion SDR, which is equal to
about $13 billion annually.
