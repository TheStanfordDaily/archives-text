American Microsystems is an exciting place to work. It you're an Electronics
Engineer, Solid State Physicist, Chemical Engineer or Computer Scientist
with a BS/MS/PhD, we have a variety of positions in design, testing, process and
product applications, and computer-aided design available right now. Your
future is here.
We were the first company to manufacture MOS/LSI, and we're the leader in
state-of-the-art custom design. We're also deeply involved in communications,
microprocessor and related semi-conductor technology.
But we're not one of those vast and impersonal companies where you can
easily get lost in the shuffle. At AMI, your contribution will be recognized
and well rewarded.
So why wait for the future when you can help build it at AMI.
