Texas Instruments is looking for unique home computer
programs. If you have some, we can help you turn them
into profit makers.To begin with-you could win up to 5 3,000.
You'll still own the programs...we may help you sell them.
One of the most exciting things about the
home computer revolution is discovering
the many ways a computer can he used.
If you've been working with small com
puters for a while, chances are you've de
veloped some innovative application
programs. This is your chance to put
them to work — for a profit.
Texas Instruments is looking for qual
ity programs. We've created an Author
Incentive Program t»» make it worth your
while. The award for the top program
will be $3,000. And there are five $1,000
awards, plus twenty $500 awards. All
winners will be recognized with national
publicity. Even if you don't receive one of
these monetary awards, we mav see
enough market potential for your pro
gram to help you develop it and sell it.
We want programs that offer real util
ity and lasting value. Programs that are
self-teaching, that communicate on hu
man terms. After all, the TI Home Com
puter was designed to be the first home
computer the whole family can use.
TI is interested in education, personal
finance and technical or managerial pro
grams for professionals. Home manage
ment programs, hobby and simulation
programs. We prefer that your submis
sions exclude entertainment packages.
Your entry can be a program you've
created for use on the TI W 1 or other
microcomputers — in any high-level lan
guage. from Pascal and BASIC to FOR
-1 RAN or ( OBOL — or even assembly
language. All the way up to IHK RAM.
Keep in mind that programs for the TI
Home Computer can incorporate high
quality color graphics, music and sound
effects, and Tl's remarkably-human syn
thesized speech.

number below. We'll send you an entry
submission form plus full details. Please
