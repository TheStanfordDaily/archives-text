# UNESCO seeks news reform
## 
### 
Belgrade (AP) — A militant in pin stripes —that
is how one colleague describes Senegal's
Hmadou Nahtar M'Bow, the newly re-elected
director general ot the United National Educa
tional, Scientific and Cultural Organization —
UNESCO.
Others say he also is an articulate voice for his
native Africa and the developing world, deeply
devoted to Islam, an energetic administrator, a
tough negotiator — but hypersensitive to the
news media.
So secure is the allegiance given M'Bow by
UNESCO's Third World majority that he was
unanimously re-elected last Saturday by the or
ganization's General Conference here without a
single other candidate being seriously consi
dered.
Colonial domination
Still, M'Bow's first six years at the helm of the
Paris-based organization were anything but
trouble-free.
While under his leadership, UNESCO has be
come the launching pad for a multi-faceted and
very controversial campaign against what the
organization's communist and Third World
majority claims is the West's "colonialist"

domination ot global communications and in
ternational news. This contention has been dis
puted all along by Western news groups and
executives. They maintain some of the propos
als before UNESCO would lead to control of the
news by governments and restrict the reporting
of foreign and domestic correspondents.
Accelerated program
The campaign for a so-called "New World In
formation Order" is expected to accelerate in
M'Bow's next seven years as director general.
"He has always insisted on the principle of
democratization of the mass media," says
Tunisia's Mustapha Nasmoudi a proponent of
the new information order. "He understands
the need to enlarge the concept of liberty of
information."
UNESCO officials frequently maintain that
most of the press, in its coverage of UNESCO,
has been paying attention over the past three
years to the media issues, while overlooking
other UNESCO programs — such as a campaign
against illiteracy, the development of alternative
energy sources and the protection of historical
monuments.
