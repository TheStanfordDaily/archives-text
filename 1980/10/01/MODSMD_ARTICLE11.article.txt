# Arabs unite behind Iraq
## 
### Washington Post 
Amman — With each passing day of the war
between Iraq and Iran, Iraqi strongman Saddam
Hussein is consolidating the regional leadership
he has coveted tor decades and is moving closer
to his dream of becoming the dominant figure
throughout the Middle East as well as the Per
sian Gulf.
He has done so, remarkably, with the willing
acquiescence — indeed, the enthusiastic sup
port — of conservative Middle East monarchies
that so long ago viewed his radical Baathist re
gime with no small measure of veiled suspicion,
stemming in part from Iraq's client relationship
with the Soviet Union.
As Iraqi armed forces penetrate deeper into
neighboring Iran, venting Arab-Persian enmity
that reaches back for centuries, conservative
Arab states are rallying behind Saddam Hussein
with surprising vigor.
And the roll call is steadily growing: Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Morocco, Qatar, Kuwait, United
Arab Emirates, North Yemen and more. All of
them have gone along, with varying degrees of
backing, with Hussein's successful efforts to as
sumea larger role notonly in the Middle East but
among the>vorld's nonaligned nations as well.
But among Hussein's backers in the now
week-old Iraqi-Iranian war, none have been as
strident as Jordan's King Hussein, who himself
has long cherished a role in engineering the
kind of Arab unity that has eluded such efforts
since the days of the colorful T.E. Lawrence and
before.
Rallying support
Seemingly at the expense of his own ambi
tions, King Hussein has been rallying support
for Saddam Hussein like a political convention
floor manager, feverishly enlisting commit
ments from potential supporters and carefullly
reaffirming pledges made before.
A Jordanian official who has always gone to
great lengths to magnify the king's emerging
leadership position among conservative Arab
states practically beamed with pride for Saddam
Hussein when he said, "He will come out defi
nitely as a stronger figure in (Arab) national
leadership If he wins this war, it will be the first
time in 50 years that there was a successful Arab
(military) operation."
Unity threatened
Telephone calls and other efforts by the king,
such as sending his prime minister and top
ministers to Baghdad on a supportive mission,
clearly reflect the monarch's concern over the
war's threat to Arab unity, which traditionally
has been more rhetorical than real.
When fighting between Iran and Iraq broke
out, there was something less than unanimity
over whom to support, and some conservative

Arab states showed signs ot fence-sitting, partly
out ot tear that taking sides would spread insta
bility, and partly because some of the states,
particularly in the gulf, have large populations of
Shiite Moslems, as does Iran.
But King Hussein took up the cause of Arab
unity with a vengeance and in a highly public
fashion after the war broke out.
State-controlled television, for example, has
been carrying long propagandistic defenses of
Iraq's position in the Shatt-al-Arab waterway
dispute and the Arabic press here has been
praising the king's role in drumming up support
for Sadddam Hussein.
Jordanian officials reject the notion that the
monarch is doing this at the expense of his own
regional role, with one official saying, "The king
plays his cards as theycome, and he always
them correctly. He never wanted to assume (re
gional) leadership. He has led in accordance
with the limits of lordan's wealth."
Teaching a lesson
When asked why the king, whose moderation
has long contrasted sharply with Saddam Hus
sein's rule, took it upon himself to muster the
conservative monarchies behind Iraq, an official
said, "First, he felt Iraq was right and that Arab
land was at stake. Second, he believes all of this
will teach Israel a lesson, that if the Arab world
gives up on trying to negotiate a peace settle
ment, we can put together a united military
stand. It is an illustration. If the Arabs can unite
against the Persians, they can unite against Israel."
Then, perhaps getting closer to the point, the
aide added, "Also, the king has proved, at least
to the Iraqis, that we were the first and the
strongest supporters of Iraq, and Iraq will not
forget it for a long time."
Dependency
With its shaky economy, Jordan is heavily de
pendent on foreign aid to keep it from ban
kruptcy, receiving two-third of its annual $1.6
billion budget in aid. It gets $1.25 billion alone a
year from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Qatar and Kuwait.
Of that, Iraq contributes more than 12 per
cent, and in addition picks up shares pledged,
but never paid, by Libya and Algeria.
King Hussein thus has good reason to be be
holden to Saddam Husesin, one of Jordan's
major benefactors, and the kind of backing he
has shown Iraq in the lastweek undoubtedly will
put Jordan in good stead when Iraq begins
budgeting foreign aid again.
At the same time, Jordanian officials believe,
the King is not sacrificing any regional political
advantage he may have gained when Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat became a black sheep in
the Middle East by signing a peace treaty with
Israel.
