# Economic growth vs. democracy
## Free enterprise is tested in Chile 
### Los Angeles Times 
Santiago — Chile is well down the road
to ridding itself of a kind of Marxist
statism, which took a terrible toll, and re
placing it with a kind of free enterprise, the
cost of which is still being calculated.
For the moment at least, Chile seems to
be on the way to improving the well-being
of many, if not most, of its 11.5 million
people.
There has been a dramatic drop in the
rate of inflation, from more than 700 per
cent in 1975 to less than 30 percent today; a
surplus in the balance of payments as
measured by the value of goods sold
against those purchased abroad; a ba
lanced budget, lowered interest rates,
growth in the number of people working
— in short, one of the world's fastest
expanding economies.
All of this is supposedly the result of
applying the ideas of the so-called Chicago
school of economics as elaborated by Mil
ton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning
economist and opponent of government
interference in the business world.
But there are problems, and those, like
the successes that are evident in the
streets, can also be heard and seen and
sensed in the streets.
The seemingly endless number of candy
vendors and street musicians, including a
man who plays Bach and Beethoven on a

plastic flute — all in the same key — are
evidence of a high rate of unemployment,
currently 12 percent, and an even higher
but undetermined rate of underemploy
ment.
From 1970-73 Marxist Piesident Salvador
Allende Gossens tried to create a statist
socialist economy. Allende's policies
combined with violent resistance from the
middle class and the still-powerful old
families to create political and economic
chaos that ended in a bloody coup led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Allende's Marxist philosophy may not
have been entirely responsible for the
•chaos fo the early 19705, but his policies
are widely blamed for making a bad situa
tion considerably worse.
By 1973, inflation was running at nearly
800 percent a year; in one month it
reached an annual rate of 1,000 percent.
Not all of this was due directly to Al
lende's economic policies. The United
States, for example, was involved in a
covert effort to subvert his government.
By September 1973, Chile no longer had
an economic system. There was sheer
pandemonium. Then Pinochet seized
power and brought in"The Chicago
Boys."
For the economic planners, there were
dual objectives, first to control inflation
and then to create a rapidly and constantly

growing economy. To reach these goals,
they ordered a drastic cutback in govern
ment spending, particularlyin education,
health and housing.
Price restrictions were ended, strikes
and labor unions banned; subsidies were
eliminated and many government-owned
industries and businesses were returned
to private ownership.
The results have been dramatic. Infla
tion immediately plunged by half within
the first year, then dropped every month
until reaching the current level. Official
projections call for it to fall to American
levels in one or two years.
The economy expanded rapidly and is
now growing at an average rate of eight
percent a year, one of the highest in the
world. This has created new jobs and the
number of people working is climbing
steadily.
But there is a question about the value of
the Chilean system as a model for others.
In other words, is the price for economic
growth and stability a loss of democracy?
Cast, head of the planning ministry, and
the "Chicago Boys" have been able to
adopt severe measures, probably unac
ceptable to most democratic societies,
where opponents would have fought
them.

Price restrictions were ended, strikes
and labor unions banned; subsidies were
eliminated and many government-owned
industries and businesses were returned
to private ownership.

until reaching the current level. Official
projections call for it to fall to American
levels in one or two years.

the Chilean system as a model for others.

Santiago — Chile is well down the road
to ridding itself of a kind of Marxist
statism, which took a terrible toll, and re
placing it with a kind of free enterprise, the
cost of which is still being calculated.
For the moment at least, Chile seems to
be on the way to improving the well-being
of many, if not most, of its 11.5 million
people.
There has been a dramatic drop in the
rate of inflation, from more than 700 per
cent in 1975 to less than 30 percent today; a
surplus in the balance of payments as
measured by the value of goods sold
against those purchased abroad; a ba
lanced budget, lowered interest rates,
growth in the number of people working
— in short, one of the world's fastest
expanding economies.
All of this is supposedly the result of
applying the ideas of the so-called Chicago
school of economics as elaborated by Mil
ton Friedman, the Nobel Prize-winning
economist and opponent of government
interference in the business world.
But there are problems, and those, like
the successes that are evident in the
streets, can also be heard and seen and
sensed in the streets.
The seemingly endless number of candy
vendors and street musicians, including a
man who plays Bach and Beethoven on a

plastic flute — all in the same key — are
evidence of a high rate of unemployment,
currently 12 percent, and an even higher
but undetermined rate of underemploy
ment.
From 1970-73 Marxist Piesident Salvador
Allende Gossens tried to create a statist
socialist economy. Allende's policies
combined with violent resistance from the
middle class and the still-powerful old
families to create political and economic
chaos that ended in a bloody coup led by
Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Allende's Marxist philosophy may not
have been entirely responsible for the
•chaos fo the early 19705, but his policies
are widely blamed for making a bad situa
tion considerably worse.
By 1973, inflation was running at nearly
800 percent a year; in one month it
reached an annual rate of 1,000 percent.
Not all of this was due directly to Al
lende's economic policies. The United
States, for example, was involved in a
covert effort to subvert his government.
By September 1973, Chile no longer had
an economic system. There was sheer
pandemonium. Then Pinochet seized
power and brought in"The Chicago
Boys."
For the economic planners, there were
dual objectives, first to control inflation
and then to create a rapidly and constantly

growing economy. To reach these goals,
they ordered a drastic cutback in govern
ment spending, particularlyin education,
health and housing.
Price restrictions were ended, strikes
and labor unions banned; subsidies were
eliminated and many government-owned
industries and businesses were returned
to private ownership.
