# Law school prof, McCloskey hosted at Common Cause celebration
## Rally speakers voice protest against special interest groups 
### Chris Rogers 
Ten years ago, John Gard
ner, a Stanford alumnus who
is now a member of the Board
of Trustees, launched the or
ganization Common Cause,
calling it "a citizen's lobby
concerned not with the ad
vancement of special interests
but with the well-being of the
nation."
Last Sunday this theme was
restated by Stanford Law Pro
fessor Richard Gerard, Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R. â€” Menlo
Park) and other speakers at the
Jordan Middle School, Palo
Alto, as more than 120 Com
mon Cause supporters
gathered to celebrate a de
cade's work.
Gerard, the first speaker of
the afternoon, immediately
picked up on the "broad base
coalition" theme. "When the
movement (Common Cause)
started," he said, "it was
believed that there was a
serious imbalance in lobbying
at Sacramento and in
Washington." Special in
terests were unduly strong
and officials were making de
cisions on issues in which they
held a conflict of interest, he
said.
Gerard cited the passage of
Proposition 9 which requires
disclosure of campaign fi
nances in all California elec
tions as an example of Com
mon Cause's work on behalf
of the entire electorate.
Gerard, who drafted the
propostion, said Prop. 9 is
"good and wholesome" for all
Californians. He said that now
candidates for public office
must not only disclose their
sources of funds but also cases
in which their financing may
affect their legislative deci
sions. Candidates can then not
participate in those areas of
conflicting interest.
Gerard said the goal of
Common Cause should be to
help enact laws requiring, fair
public financing of campaigns.
"The present system of private

financing has become dis
criminatory, inequitable and
basically corrupt/' he said. For
this reason the poor cannot
campaign and special interest
group contributions become
batons of power, Gerard said.
He cited McCloskey's first
campaign for a seat in Con
gress as an example of the
forces working against candi
dates withoug public funds. In
that campaign, McCloskey had
to overcome the "celebrity
status" of his opponent, Shir
ley Temple-Black, he said.
Gerard's speech gave
McCloskey a gold baton for
McCloskey's own address in
the marathon of speeches;
which followed.
McCloskey opened his
speech wih an attack on
apathy within the Common
Cause movement. "After 10
years much of the steam has
gone out of the group," he
said.
The idealism and the incen
tive for Common Cause have
dissipated, McCloskey said,
and the group needs a cause
"akin to the Vietnam War"
dispute around which it can
rally. This would inject re
newed sentiment into the
movement, according to this
congressman.
McCloskey said that with
political apathy so high and
voter participation so low it is
not surprising that a special in
terest group accounting for
only five percent of the popu
lation increases its real elec
toral weight by twice that
amount. And, he said, "legis
lators in close-run races dare
not offend that 10 percent
special interest vote."
McCloskey cited the fact
that 70 percent of Californians
support gun control but that
the bloated importance of
those against laws requiring
registration of hand guns pre
vents the motion from being
passed.
"The biggest enemy of hon

est government is apathy,"
said McCloskey.
The congressman then
talked about Common Cause's
push for public financing of
campaigns. "No truly honest
person will run for office when
such large sums of money are
needed to finance campaigns.
What honorable person can
ask his friends for money or

ask them to raise such tunds
for him?" he asked.
McCloskey called on Com
mon Cause members to
mobilize in support of legisla
tion in favor of public, not pri
vate or individual, financing of
campaigns.
"What we want is people
who are elected and are not
going to put themselves into

bondage to money," he said.
Under current law and prac
tice he said he found that a
congressman is "much safer if
(he) has been elected without
mass individual contribu
tions."
But McCloskey did not fault
the two-party system. He said
that, despite its faults, the
two-party system in the United
States is preferable to multi

party or other systems.
This statement was in sharp
contrast to Gerard's claim that
the present system has "re
ndered the parties in Calitor
nia to just shells" with no con
trol over office holders or
nominees.
The tenth anniversary celeb
ration, which opened to the
tunes of the Calliope Duo
(though billed as a trio), con
tinued with more speeches.
Derwood Baker, chairman of
the meeting, introduced As
semblyman Victor Calvo.
Calvo, who seved for six
years in Sacramento, talked
about the work of Common
Cause from a legislator's point
of view. Although he favors
election funding reforms,
Calvo said in reality Prop. 9
was being circumvented and
abused. Reports on campaign
financing under the new laws
prompted by Prop. 9 are not
released until after election
day, he said. "The public does
not seem that interested in the
control of special interest
groups," he claimed.
Calvo repeated the call for
limitations on individual con
tributions to public cam
paigns. Calvo claimed that he
and Assemblyman Gary Hart
had presented legislation to
that effect only to have it re
vised and given a short, 30-
minute hearing.

Calvo accused incumbents
of maneuvering to protect
their positions.
Assemblyman Robert
Naylor, the next speaker to
take the podium, returned to
the theme of Common Cause
as a necessary advocate of a
broad base coalition. Naylor
said the full-time Common
Cause lobbyist in Sacramento
creates "a balance" because
most lobbyists "have an axe to
grind." The Common Cause
lobbyists, he said, present
reasoned judgments on the
logic of legislation under con
sideration.
Naylor also called on Com
mon Cause to lead its 40,000
California members in the
fight for public campaign
financing. He then em
phasized the need to re
examine the Reapportionment
Bill. Naylor explained that
when districts are redrawn ac
cording to the latest census, it
is crucial that Common Cause
insure that no potentially un
fair deals be made, and then
forced on the electorate.
But, it was Gerard who had
given the celebration its unify
ing theme. Reading from a
passage from Doctor Seuss,
the children's novelist, he
said: "Unless someone like
you cares a whole awful lot,
nothing is going to get better
. . . It's not."
