## US unable to act in Iran 
### 
The image we've long feared has now become
fact. As the greatest threat to our national sec
urity in perhaps two decades plays itself out in
the war between Iran and Iraq, here sits the
United States, the helpless giant, wringing its
hands but unable to act.
President jimmy Carter would have us believe
that his policy is one of studied neutrality. He
calls on the United Nationstostep in, and on the
Soviets to stay out. He speaks of cooperative
actions with our allies to keep the Straits of
Hormuz open and the flow of oil continuing to
the West. After all, he is no warmonger.
But the truth is that Carter must take a neutral
stand because he has no choice. His own waver
ing policies have left him without either military
or diplomatic options. As a result, the entire
Western way of life stands threatened.
At first glance, Carter's apparent lack of con
cern may seem justified. Together, Iran and Iraq
have recently supplied only 10 percent of the oil
used by the noncommunist world. The United
States has lately used little oil from either coun
try.
Moreover, world oil inventories now stand at
more than five billion barrels, equal to more
than 100 days of current oil demand.
Facts misleading
But these facts are misleading. Oil experts
point out that 76 days of that 100-day supply are
required just to keep the pipelines filled and the
system running. Of the remaining 24 days, 16
days have traditionally been considered "nor
mal" additional stocks. That leaves only about
eight days of "excess" inventories.
More important, the real threat of the current
war is not just the loss of oil from Iran and Iraq,
but the likely disruption of political systems in,
and thus oil supplies from, all the countries in
the Persian Gulf.
Iraq's military is now clearly the most power
ful in the region. Iraq seeks to lead the Arab
world against Israel and the West. The almost
defenseless Saudis have already taken the side
of Iraq, presumably to be seen as having joined
the winner early, and the Kuwaitis, long haras
sed by Iraq, now fear for their security.
Soviet threat
The gravest threat of all, however, comes
from the Soviet Union. Although they supply
most of their own oil now, they clearly have their
eyes on the Persian Gulf. Before long, they will
need that oil too. The current disruption may
allow them to take the oil for themselves, while
leaving the West at their mercy.

Militarily, the Soviets are well-prepared to
move into Iraq and Iran it the need or opportun
ityarises. Besides supplying Iraq with mostot its
weapons, the Soviets have their own troops
positioned along the Iranian border. According
to the Pentagon, these forces amount to a dozen
divisions, fully armed and ready to fight.
Diplomatically, the Soviets also have the best
position. Neither Iraq nor Iran really wants
Soviet domination. But the Soviets, with their
military power, stand as the brokers of peace in
the region, able to put pressure on both sides to
affect a settlement. This could simply freeze out
American influence, much as we froze out the
Soviets in the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1973. It
would achieve the same end for the Soviets
without their joining in the current fighting.
Carter's Position
In the face of this crisis, where does Carter
stand?
When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, Carter
declared that the United States would defend
the nations that supply oil to the West. But he
has no way to do this. Only about 1800 Marines
and 170 warplanes, stationed on ships in the
Indian Ocean, are close enough to get to the
fighting quickly. Even the most generous esti
mates allow for only 20,000 to 25,000 lightly
armed men to reach the area within two weeks.
Clearly, the President has failed to make his
words credible.
Diplomatically, our position is even worse.
Who are we going to defend? Iran and Iraq
compete to show theii contempt for us; they
don't want our help. When the shah was in
power, at least he kept the region stable, and
enforced the agreement over the disputed bor
der with Iraq. Carter is now feeling the effects of
having abandoned our only reliable friend in
that crucial part of the world.
Hope for the future
So Carter is left to hand-wringing and blind
hope. But perhapsthere is hope for the future. If
he does win re-election, we can hope that he
now sees the need for a strong conventional
military force, and the need to support our
foreign friends, even if we don't entirely agree
with their internal policies.
If Iran survives this war intact, we can hope
that it will realize that its interests do lie with the
West. Foremost, we can hope that this country,
its people and government, will take seriously
the need to be less dependent on foreign oil.
But this is a lot to ask of mere hope.

to the Pentagon, these forces amount to a dozen
divisions, fully armed and ready to fight.
Diplomatically, the Soviets also have the best
position. Neither Iraq nor Iran really wants
Soviet domination. But the Soviets, with their
military power, stand as the brokers of peace in
the region, able to put pressure on both sides to
affect a settlement. This could simply freeze out
American influence, much as we froze out the
Soviets in the Arab-Israeli conflict of 1973. It
would achieve the same end for the Soviets
without their joining in the current fighting.
Carter's Position
In the face of this crisis, where does Carter
stand?
When the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, Carter
declared that the United States would defend
the nations that supply oil to the West. But he
has no way to do this. Only about 1800 Marines
and 170 warplanes, stationed on ships in the
Indian Ocean, are close enough to get to the
fighting quickly. Even the most generous esti
mates allow for only 20,000 to 25,000 lightly
armed men to reach the area within two weeks.
Clearly, the President has failed to make his
words credible.
Diplomatically, our position is even worse.
Who are we going to defend? Iran and Iraq
compete to show theii contempt for us; they
don't want our help. When the shah was in
power, at least he kept the region stable, and
enforced the agreement over the disputed bor
der with Iraq. Carter is now feeling the effects of
having abandoned our only reliable friend in
that crucial part of the world.
Hope for the future
So Carter is left to hand-wringing and blind
hope. But perhapsthere is hope for the future. If
he does win re-election, we can hope that he
now sees the need for a strong conventional
military force, and the need to support our
foreign friends, even if we don't entirely agree
with their internal policies.
If Iran survives this war intact, we can hope
that it will realize that its interests do lie with the
West. Foremost, we can hope that this country,
its people and government, will take seriously
the need to be less dependent on foreign oil.
But this is a lot to ask of mere hope.
(Scott Richter is a third-year ID-MBA student.)
The image we've long feared has now become
fact. As the greatest threat to our national sec
urity in perhaps two decades plays itself out in
the war between Iran and Iraq, here sits the
United States, the helpless giant, wringing its
hands but unable to act.
President jimmy Carter would have us believe
that his policy is one of studied neutrality. He
calls on the United Nationstostep in, and on the
Soviets to stay out. He speaks of cooperative
actions with our allies to keep the Straits of
Hormuz open and the flow of oil continuing to
the West. After all, he is no warmonger.
But the truth is that Carter must take a neutral
stand because he has no choice. His own waver
ing policies have left him without either military
or diplomatic options. As a result, the entire
Western way of life stands threatened.
At first glance, Carter's apparent lack of con
cern may seem justified. Together, Iran and Iraq
have recently supplied only 10 percent of the oil
used by the noncommunist world. The United
States has lately used little oil from either coun
try.
Moreover, world oil inventories now stand at
more than five billion barrels, equal to more
than 100 days of current oil demand.
Facts misleading
But these facts are misleading. Oil experts
point out that 76 days of that 100-day supply are
required just to keep the pipelines filled and the
system running. Of the remaining 24 days, 16
days have traditionally been considered "nor
mal" additional stocks. That leaves only about
eight days of "excess" inventories.
More important, the real threat of the current
war is not just the loss of oil from Iran and Iraq,
but the likely disruption of political systems in,
and thus oil supplies from, all the countries in
the Persian Gulf.
Iraq's military is now clearly the most power
ful in the region. Iraq seeks to lead the Arab
world against Israel and the West. The almost
defenseless Saudis have already taken the side
of Iraq, presumably to be seen as having joined
the winner early, and the Kuwaitis, long haras
sed by Iraq, now fear for their security.
Soviet threat
The gravest threat of all, however, comes
from the Soviet Union. Although they supply
most of their own oil now, they clearly have their
eyes on the Persian Gulf. Before long, they will
need that oil too. The current disruption may
allow them to take the oil for themselves, while
leaving the West at their mercy.

Militarily, the Soviets are well-prepared to
move into Iraq and Iran it the need or opportun
ityarises. Besides supplying Iraq with mostot its
weapons, the Soviets have their own troops
positioned along the Iranian border. According
to the Pentagon, these forces amount to a dozen
divisions, fully armed and ready to fight.
