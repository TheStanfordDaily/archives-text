# THE STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## John David Halamka Frosh face "registration zone" 
### 
I submit for your approval, a
solitary Stanford Freshman,
groping for reality in a world
without compassion: Registra
tion. A light, a flash, and reality
fades in the distance. He is
forever lost. But how long is
the line out of The Registration

Zone?
To the left, to the right, it is
an episode of futility. Lines,
lines, and lines to stand in.
Walled in, a fumbling figure
clutches through a crowd, but
unknown to him, there is no
exit.
Plunging into his Time
Schedule in search of an ans
wer, he gazes at blank pages,
until he finds it — at last. His
freshman seminar, he finds his
freshman seminar: Line Stand
ing 180 units: Staff. Whew, he
still has identity.
He searches in vain, his
karma never to be granted
Permission to Register. Forever
a prisoner of Privacy forms, he
remains a shadow of a man,
anonymous in a world of
struggling Yahoos.
Melting into a line he fades
into infinity.
At last, carried home by a
sweet chariot, fie reaches a
door: free at last — or so he
suspects.

Down, Down, Down,
deeper into the First Ring of
Registration he plunges, only
to be tormented by a vision of
Inferno, a crypt of paper.
Buried in 33 tons of Reg Pack,
he melts into a ditto minded
delusion. He joins 457 organi
zations and at last is set free
into the Second Circle.
Accompanied by Donald
Dante, a sage from the Ad
ministration, the now sun
baked figure reaches Fig Leaf
Auditorium, a Garden of Eden
now haven to a thousand ser
pents tempting passerbys with
MONEY BOOKS that will lead
to a destiny with God.
A thousand serpents crush
his unadorned body in a
myriad of coupon confusion.
"Buy, buy, buy," they chant.
"Just takeonecoupon, the first
one's always free."
He succumbs to the inces
sant chanting and is caught in
the whirlwind of the fourth cir
cle, lost forever in 590 restaur

ants eating two tor one spe
cials.
Forgiven and entering the
fifth circle he passes Cerebus
and 987 talking tables. He
reaches his destiny, judgment
at the "Cashier of Life."
When asked to sell his soul,
he grovels in repentence and
is, until Armageddon, defer
red.
He forgets to pass go, he
doesn't collect 200 forms.
Tripping into the sixth ring
he is confronted by the stam
pers. His body is covered; ink
pad after ink pad, stamp after
stamp touch his now swelter
ing flesh, until he is at last, offi
cial.
Finally a chilled breath on his
shoulder directs him to The.
Final Step. His soul crushed,
his spirit doused, his body
emaciated, he steps. A swim in
the Bay was never more re
freshing.

declared freshman.)
