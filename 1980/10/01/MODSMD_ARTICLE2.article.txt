A 20-month search for a new vice president for medi
cal affairs has led to the appointment of Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, the man who has filled the position since the
previous vice president resigned in 1978.
The appointment, announced by President Donald
Kennedy on Aug. 19, marks the first step in a reorgani
zation of the Medical Center administration. This is the
first time that the roles ot vice president and dean of
the medical school (both held by Crowley in acting
status) have been separated.
The appointment is subject to Board of Trustees ap
proval, expected when the board next meets Oct. 13.
Crowley is in his new position responsible not only
for academics at the Med Center but also for patient
care at Stanford University Hospital, according to Ken
nedy.
Both the dean of the Med School, now the subject of
a new search, and the executive director of the hospi
tal, Peter Levin, will report to Crowley, said Kennedy.
"The vice president for medical affairs is the leader of
the entire Medical Center. The dean is the chief
academic officer of the Medical School, while the
executive director of the hospital is the chief operating
officer," said Crowley.
Crowley said his major goal is to "continue the for
ward progress of the Med Center over the last decade."
This involves modernization of the hospital itself with
new equipment and facilities as well as completing im
provements of academic programs," he said.
"The real challenge, and I think it's one that Larry has
met, is to integrate effectively the medical education
and research as well as patient care," said Kennedy.
Search committee chairman Dr. Thomas Merigan
cited this specific need of the Med Center as one of the
major considerations in evaluating candidates.
Another consideration cited by Kennedy is the fact

that unlike many medical schools, the one here is right
on campus and therefore has stronger ties to the rest of
the University.
More than 130 candidates were nominated for com
mittee consideration, with about a dozen extensively
evaluated, explained Merigan. Some of the candidates
were interviewed in their home cities and others were
brought to Stanford, he said.
Crowley's appointment is "not in any sense a result
of disappointment on the outside," said Kennedy.
"I think it was very healthy for the University to go
through a search," said Joshua Praeger, one of two
student members of the search committee. "It's better
for the University and for (Crowley's) vice-presidency
that it was done that way.
"Sure everyone knew (Crowley) was already here,
but sometimes you just can't make a confident choice
from inside without making an exhaustive search of all
outside candidates," he said.
A graduate of Yale University and the School of
Medicine there, Crowley first served as a professor of
surgery at the Medical School here from 1964 to 1974.
After three years as a dean at the University of Wiscon
sin in Madison, he returned to Stanford as professor
and deputy dean in 1977.
He assumed the role of acting vice president and
dean upon the resignation of Dr. Clayton Rich, who
had held both positions. Crowley remains acting dean
until a new permanent dean can be found.
"What's really impressive is the rate at which Larry
and his staff has been able to reach their goals while
still in acting status," said Kennedy.
"We're in a very much better situation now than we
were 20 months ago as far as quality of planning, the
financial condition of the Med Center, and the effi
ciency of administrative work.
"I certainly think that selecting an insider helps keep
the continuity," added Kennedy.
