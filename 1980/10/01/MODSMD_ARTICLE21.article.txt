## Lantos seeks campus aid in 11th district race 
### 
Most of us at Stanford think of San
Mateo County only as a number of
freeway exits you have to pass on the
way to the City. But an important con
gressional battle is being waged in San
Mateo County's 11th district that fea
tures an exceptional candidate who
I'm sure will interest the Stanford
community.
The race is between ultra
conservative Republican incumbent
Bill Royer, and a progressive Democra
tic economist Tom Lantos. Here at
Stanford, a group to support Lantos is
being formed, and your help is ur
gently needed.
Tom Lantos came to the United
States from his native Hungary on an
academic scholarship. As a teenager in
Budapest, he joined the underground
resistance to Nazi occupation. He was
captured and placed in a forced labor
camp, from which he eventually es
caped. In 1953 he earned his Ph.D. in
economics from UC-Berkeley.
Today Tom Lantos is an international
economist with an impressive
background that well qualifies him to
serve in Congress. Currently he is on
leave from his post as senior professor
of economics at San Francisco State
University, where he has been on the
faculty since 1950. While at SF State, he
established and directed the overseas

studies program tor the California
State University system. Tom has also
had experience in Washington, where
he was chief economic and foreign
policy advisor to United States
Senators Frank Church, Joseph Biden
and others.
The differences between the two
candidates on the issues could not be

"Tom Lantos strongly supports the ERA and civil
rights, energy conservation, nuclear arms
limitation, and aid to education. In contrast,
Royer's record is one of neglect of human
needs .. "

more vivid. Tom Lantos strongly sup
ports the ERA and civil rights, energy
conservation, nuclear arms limitation,
and aid to education. He opposed re
stricting a woman's choice to have an
abortion. He has devised a unique plan
to help young people enter the hous
ing market. Tom has been endorsed by
the National Organization for Women,
the Sierra Club and major labor groups
as well as by Senator Alan Cranston.
In contrast, Royer's record is one of

neglect of human needs and service to
the oil companies and other special in
terests that have provided much of his
campaign warchest. This is illustrated
by the evaluations of Royer's votes in
Congress by various public-interest
organizaitons:
Sierra Club: no correct votes.

Consumer Federation of America:
four percent correct votes.
League of Women Voters: 10 per
cent correct votes.
Leadership Conference on Crvil
Rights: no correct votes.
However, some groups are happy
with Royer's performance. A far-right
evangelical group caled "Moral Major
ity" gave Royer a 100 percent rating on
their "morality" scale. These ratings
give you an idea where Royer stands.
The Lantos-Royer race is considered

one of the pivotal elections nationally.
Tom Lantos has been selected by the
national Democratic congressional
Campaign Committee as one of the six
key Democrats in the country — the
only one in the West. While the Royer
campaign has received major financial
support from large corporate interests,
Tom Lantos has relied mostly on indi
vidual donors and a strong grassroots
organization.
I am sure all of this evidence will
convince you that Tom Lantos de
serves our active support. Although
the 11th district does not include most
Stanford students (it goes from Red
wood City north), Stanford students
were traditionally active in supporting
the late Leo Ryan, who represented the
district until his assasination in
Guyana. A number of Stanford stu
dents have already committed them
selves to helping cover precincts for a
few hours on weekends. The polls
show a close election, and our help
can make the difference.
Tom Lantos is a candidate we can
feel good working for, who shares our
values and concerns, and needs our
help.

vidual donors and a strong grassroots
organization.
I am sure all of this evidence will
convince you that Tom Lantos de
serves our active support. Although
the 11th district does not include most
Stanford students (it goes from Red
wood City north), Stanford students
were traditionally active in supporting
the late Leo Ryan, who represented the
district until his assasination in
Guyana. A number of Stanford stu
dents have already committed them
selves to helping cover precincts for a
few hours on weekends. The polls
show a close election, and our help
can make the difference.
Tom Lantos is a candidate we can
feel good working for, who shares our
values and concerns, and needs our
help.

Most of us at Stanford think of San
Mateo County only as a number of
freeway exits you have to pass on the
way to the City. But an important con
gressional battle is being waged in San
Mateo County's 11th district that fea
tures an exceptional candidate who
I'm sure will interest the Stanford
community.
The race is between ultra
conservative Republican incumbent
Bill Royer, and a progressive Democra
tic economist Tom Lantos. Here at
Stanford, a group to support Lantos is
being formed, and your help is ur
gently needed.
Tom Lantos came to the United
States from his native Hungary on an
academic scholarship. As a teenager in
Budapest, he joined the underground
resistance to Nazi occupation. He was
captured and placed in a forced labor
camp, from which he eventually es
caped. In 1953 he earned his Ph.D. in
economics from UC-Berkeley.
Today Tom Lantos is an international
economist with an impressive
background that well qualifies him to
serve in Congress. Currently he is on
leave from his post as senior professor
of economics at San Francisco State
University, where he has been on the
faculty since 1950. While at SF State, he
established and directed the overseas

studies program tor the California
State University system. Tom has also
had experience in Washington, where
he was chief economic and foreign
policy advisor to United States
Senators Frank Church, Joseph Biden
and others.
The differences between the two
candidates on the issues could not be

"Tom Lantos strongly supports the ERA and civil
rights, energy conservation, nuclear arms
limitation, and aid to education. In contrast,
Royer's record is one of neglect of human
needs .. "

more vivid. Tom Lantos strongly sup
ports the ERA and civil rights, energy
conservation, nuclear arms limitation,
and aid to education. He opposed re
stricting a woman's choice to have an
abortion. He has devised a unique plan
to help young people enter the hous
ing market. Tom has been endorsed by
the National Organization for Women,
the Sierra Club and major labor groups
as well as by Senator Alan Cranston.
In contrast, Royer's record is one of

neglect of human needs and service to
the oil companies and other special in
terests that have provided much of his
campaign warchest. This is illustrated
by the evaluations of Royer's votes in
Congress by various public-interest
organizaitons:
Sierra Club: no correct votes.

Consumer Federation of America:
four percent correct votes.
League of Women Voters: 10 per
cent correct votes.
Leadership Conference on Crvil
Rights: no correct votes.
However, some groups are happy
with Royer's performance. A far-right
evangelical group caled "Moral Major
ity" gave Royer a 100 percent rating on
their "morality" scale. These ratings
give you an idea where Royer stands.
The Lantos-Royer race is considered

one of the pivotal elections nationally.
Tom Lantos has been selected by the
national Democratic congressional
Campaign Committee as one of the six
key Democrats in the country — the
only one in the West. While the Royer
campaign has received major financial
support from large corporate interests,
Tom Lantos has relied mostly on indi
vidual donors and a strong grassroots
organization.
I am sure all of this evidence will
convince you that Tom Lantos de
serves our active support. Although
