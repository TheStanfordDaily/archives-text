# Statisticians predict fewer researchers

Washington (LAT/WP) —
One little-noticed foreign in
vasion is in American science
education.
The United States produces
only about 1000 Ph.D. physi
cists every year, and about 320
of those are foreigners. In en
gineering, foreigners make up
more than 33 percent of the
Ph.D. graduates.
Although three-quarters of
the foreigners will take the
degrees and return home, the
number who stay here to get
full-time jobs is growing and
the total is between five per
cent and 10 percent higher
than it was a decade ago.
The influx of foreign stu
dents into graduate science
studies in America has two
Q|fief causes — first, more
ipreigners can afford to send
children here to get an educa
ti£>{i because the American
dollar has declined in value.
Second, American students
have been turning away from
some basic sciences especially
at the graduate level, for the
past decade. As a result, shor
tages of students have de
veloped and chairmen of
physics departments have fil
led the gaps with foreigners,
according to Susanne Ellis,
statistician for the American
Institute of Physics.
Thus some statisticians say
the United States may face a
shortage of scientists in

physics and chemistry both in
basic research and in industry
in the next decade.
The number of graduate
physics students has dropped
in 10 years from 15,000 to
10,000 per year, according to
Ellis.
In chemistry, the number of
students in graduate school
has dropped about 20 percent,
from 2200 a decade ago to 1540
this year, according to Robert
Newman of the American
Chemical Society.
Students began to turn away
from physics and chemistry in
1970, when economic condi
tions forced cuts in research
funds, and when space and
nuclear research programs
began to narrow. The number
of jobs in universities stopped
growing, and science and en
gineering jobs available in in
dustry dropped to the lowest
mark since Deutsch, Shea and
Evans Inc. began keeping an
index in 1961.
Through the 19605, the de
mand for physicists exceeded
the American supply, and the
United States imported physi
cists from other countries and
other disciplines, according to
Lee Grodzins, a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology
specialist in science man
power.
