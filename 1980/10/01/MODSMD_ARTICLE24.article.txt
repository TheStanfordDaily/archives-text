## More doubts raised about safe' radiation levels 
### Pacific News Service 
Until recently, one simple fact cast
doubt on all claims about the health
effects of nuclear radiation: nobody
really knew what constituted a "safe"
level of exposure.
Because the atomic age has been
with us only since World War 11, and
the latency period for many forms ot
cancer and other potential radiation
hazards may be 30 years, scientists
could just guess — no more than that
— how much nuclear radiation a
human being might safely absorb.
But with the passage of time, resear
chers have looked to the medical re
cords of the nation's atomic workers to
find more dependable answers. Those
answers are now flooding in, and they
are highly distressing.
"It is evident there can be no safe
level," concludes Dr. Karl Morgan, a
wo rid-renowned governmental re
searcher widely regarded as the foun
der of health physics. "A so-called safe
level is one in which the expected be
nefits will exceed the harm that may
result."
Federal radiation standards, ob

serves Sen. Gary Hart (D-Colo.), "are
ultimately based on an arbitrary
bureaucratic decision about how many
adverse health effects, a euphemism
for deaths, we will put up with — the
so-called 'acceptable costs.' "
The first facility in the world to pro
duce enough plutonium for an atomic
bomb, the Hantord Nuclear Reserva
tion in eastern Washington, is a com
prehensive case in point. The home of
a massive wartime effort to produce
plutonium on a large scale, Hantord
has employed a sizeable and
carefully-monitored nuclear workforce
since 1944.
In 1965, the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission assigned Dr. Thomas
Mancuso, professor of occupational
medicine at the University of
Pittsburgh and a pioneer in industrial
cancer research, to conduct an exhaus
tive study on the health of Hantord's
nuclear workers.
Cancers
After a dozen years of assessing the
health records of 35.000 employees at
the sprawling atomic plant over three

decades, Mancuso's study found sev
eral tyes of cancer to be unusually pre
valent. The research concluded that
cancers of the lung, pancreas and
bone marrow had been caused by
low-level radiation. Overall, between
five and six percent of the cancer
deaths among Hantord workers were
attributed, by the studv, to low-dose
radiation exposure.
Implications of the findings were
shattering, especially since they may
only represent the tip of an iceberg.
Incubation periods for radiation-linked
cancers are not yet completed for
many Hantord workers, and meticul
ously kept official statistics show that
Hantord employees were exposed to
radiation levels no more than one
tenth of the "safe" exposure limits cur
rently allowed by government regula
tions.
"For decades, the atomic energy in
dustry and government supporting
agencies were saying that the nuclear
industry was extremely safe," Man
cuso said. But until his project, "no
study had ever been done of all the

employees of an atomic energy facility
to determine the cancer effects on all
those who had been exposed to radia
tion, and then left the company and
subsequently died.''
The unprecedented scope and
thoroughness of Mancuso's study gave
somber weight to its conclusions: low
levels of ionizing radiation cause
cancer; current governmental radia
tion standards for industrial workers
are not safe at all.
Workers upset
Among those most concerned about
Mancuso's findings — and most out
raged when Mancuso's federal funding
was cut off — are members of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers
(OCAW) union, which represents
more than 10,000 employees within the
nuclear industry.
"These workers are dependent on
the future viability of that industry for
their jobs and their livelihoods," says
Steven Wodka, international represen
tative of OCAW and a specialist in
health and safety.
