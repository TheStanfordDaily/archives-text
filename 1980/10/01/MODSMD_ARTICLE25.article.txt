### 
Washington (AP) — Pre
dicting a surplus of 70,(K)0
doctors by 1990, a panel ot
medical experts yesterday
urged that medical schools
limit enrollments and en
courage new doctors to
forgo glamorous surgical
specialties in favor of gen
eral practice.
The Graduate Medical
Education National Advis
ory Committee also re
commended extra federal
financial rewards for prac
tice in areas with a shortage
of doctors.
The voluminous report,
to Secretary of Health and
Human Services Patricia
Harris, was released at a
news conference yesterday
by Dr. Alvin Tarlov, a Uni
versity of Chicago medical
school professor who
chaired the panel.
"There will be too many
physicians in 1990. There
will be substantial imba
lances in some specialties,"
the panel predicted. "There

will continue to be a
marked unevenness in the
geographic distribution of
physicians."
But by 1990, it forecast,
there will be 536,000, a
surplus ot 70,000. And at
the turn of the century, the
number will grow to
643,000, or 145,000 more
than needed, the report
said.
The ratio of physicians to
population, which was 171
per 100,000 in 1978, will
jump to 220 per 100,000 in
1990 and 297 per 100,000 in
2000, it said.
With 67,000 students now
in the nation's 126 medical
schools, the report said no
new schools should be
opened. And it recom
mended that by 1984 the
schools cut new enroll
ments at least 10 percent
from the 1978-79 class or 17
percent from this fall's
class.
