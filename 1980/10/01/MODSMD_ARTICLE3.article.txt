# House probation is unprecedented
## Zetes start new era under IFC control 
### Mac Funk 
In an experimental move that may portend
fundamental changes in University polity toward
the fraternity system, Zeta Psi fraternity will re
main on campus this year under the jurisdiction
of the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
Last spring the Zetes were faced with the possi
bility of expulsion and the loss of on-campus
privileges.
Under the terms of the new arrangement, the
IFC will own the Zete house and oversee all ac
tivities carried on by the house, according to Row
Director Diana Conklin. The IFC is composed of
representatives from all University fraternities.
"The IFC can do anything it decides is neces
sary to turn the house around," Conklin said.
The Zetes have been placed on social probation
for the time being, according to IFC President
Richard David. This means the fraternity may hold
no social functions and can not collect social dues
from its members.
"I anticipate that the social probation will be
over at the end of fall quarter," David said. The
probation will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.
David said the IFC has also taken over financial
responsibilities for the house.
Ffe stressed that although it is not an official
action of the IFC, former IFC President John Kin
ney will be a resident adviser in the Zete house
this year.
The Zetes came under fire from University offi
cials last year due to a variety of alleged viola
tions. It was estimated last May that damages to
the Zete house totalled about $5000 during spring
quarter. In addition, several fraternity pledges
were apprehended by the police for stealing palm

fronds and other goods worth about $800.
Late last spring, Conklin recommended that the
Zetes be denied their residential privileges for the
next three years.
It seemed the Zetes were following in the his
torical path of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
which was "kicked off" campus twice during the
last eight years.
But, according to David and Dean of Residen
tial Education Norm Robinson, the IFC intervened
with the suggestion that the council be given the
chance to curtail the Zetes' problems.
The fundamental reason for the current ar
rangement, said Robinson, was "the strong lead
ership of the IFC during the last couple of years.
"The decision came from a desire to see if it's
possible to change things, rather than just get rid
of the problem," said Robinson. He added that
suspension of residential privileges is still an op
tion if the experimental arrangement does not
succeed.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons echoed
Robinson's view, noting that University officials
were "impressed by the vigor of the IFC's argu
ment."
Lyons said he could not predict the IFC's effec
tiveness in "dealing with the issues that have got
ten the Zetes into trouble over the last couple of
years.
"The IFC argued they will be in a better posi
tion to influence the Zetes," said Lyons. "We're
willing to give it a try, since we always like to
encourage groups on campus who want to take
responsibility for their own affairs."
Zete House President Scott Peterson em
phasized the current arrangement is "better than

getting kicked off," though he also said the
fraternity "does mind being overseen by the
IFC."
Peterson reiterated the opinion, widely expres
sed last spring, that the University was unfair in its
treatment of the problem.
"I think the University came down too hard on
us," Peterson said. "I think they (University offi
cials) are wrong in a lot of conceptions of what
the house is really like."
Although Peterson asserted the damages to the
house last spring were "a lot less" than the Uni
versity alleged, he said the fraternity did initiate a
new rule last spring that anyone who "maliciously
damages" the house will be evicted.
When asked about possible Zete resentment of
IFC rule, David asserted, "The Zetes are on cam
pus due to the intervention of the IFC.
"They have no right to feel resentment," said
David. "We will be trying to let them know that
this is a serious situation."
Last spring, Conklin called the decision to put
the fraternity under IFC jurisdiction "a three-way
win.
"The Zetes get to keep their house, the IFC has
a chance to show its influence and the University
doesn't have to deal with the day-to-day prob
lems of the house," she noted.
David agreed the IFC has something to gain
from the situation. "The arrangement fits with a
feeling the IFC has had for a long time — that all
fraternity problems should be dealt with within
the system.
"This arrangement is a move toward that idea,"
David said.

Under the terms of the new arrangement, the
IFC will own the Zete house and oversee all ac
tivities carried on by the house, according to Row
Director Diana Conklin. The IFC is composed of
representatives from all University fraternities.
"The IFC can do anything it decides is neces
sary to turn the house around," Conklin said.
The Zetes have been placed on social probation
for the time being, according to IFC President
Richard David. This means the fraternity may hold
no social functions and can not collect social dues
from its members.
"I anticipate that the social probation will be
over at the end of fall quarter," David said. The
probation will be reviewed on a quarterly basis.
David said the IFC has also taken over financial
responsibilities for the house.
Ffe stressed that although it is not an official
action of the IFC, former IFC President John Kin
ney will be a resident adviser in the Zete house
this year.
The Zetes came under fire from University offi
cials last year due to a variety of alleged viola
tions. It was estimated last May that damages to
the Zete house totalled about $5000 during spring
quarter. In addition, several fraternity pledges
were apprehended by the police for stealing palm

fronds and other goods worth about $800.
Late last spring, Conklin recommended that the
Zetes be denied their residential privileges for the
next three years.
It seemed the Zetes were following in the his
torical path of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
which was "kicked off" campus twice during the
last eight years.
But, according to David and Dean of Residen
tial Education Norm Robinson, the IFC intervened
with the suggestion that the council be given the
chance to curtail the Zetes' problems.
The fundamental reason for the current ar
rangement, said Robinson, was "the strong lead
ership of the IFC during the last couple of years.
"The decision came from a desire to see if it's
possible to change things, rather than just get rid
of the problem," said Robinson. He added that
suspension of residential privileges is still an op
tion if the experimental arrangement does not
succeed.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons echoed
Robinson's view, noting that University officials
were "impressed by the vigor of the IFC's argu
ment."
Lyons said he could not predict the IFC's effec
tiveness in "dealing with the issues that have got
ten the Zetes into trouble over the last couple of
years.
"The IFC argued they will be in a better posi
tion to influence the Zetes," said Lyons. "We're
willing to give it a try, since we always like to
encourage groups on campus who want to take
responsibility for their own affairs."
Zete House President Scott Peterson em
phasized the current arrangement is "better than

getting kicked off," though he also said the
fraternity "does mind being overseen by the
IFC."
Peterson reiterated the opinion, widely expres
sed last spring, that the University was unfair in its
treatment of the problem.
"I think the University came down too hard on
us," Peterson said. "I think they (University offi
cials) are wrong in a lot of conceptions of what
the house is really like."
Although Peterson asserted the damages to the
house last spring were "a lot less" than the Uni
versity alleged, he said the fraternity did initiate a
new rule last spring that anyone who "maliciously
damages" the house will be evicted.
When asked about possible Zete resentment of
IFC rule, David asserted, "The Zetes are on cam
pus due to the intervention of the IFC.
"They have no right to feel resentment," said
David. "We will be trying to let them know that
this is a serious situation."
Last spring, Conklin called the decision to put
the fraternity under IFC jurisdiction "a three-way
win.
"The Zetes get to keep their house, the IFC has
a chance to show its influence and the University
doesn't have to deal with the day-to-day prob
lems of the house," she noted.
David agreed the IFC has something to gain
from the situation. "The arrangement fits with a
feeling the IFC has had for a long time — that all
fraternity problems should be dealt with within
the system.
"This arrangement is a move toward that idea,"
David said.
In an experimental move that may portend
fundamental changes in University polity toward
the fraternity system, Zeta Psi fraternity will re
main on campus this year under the jurisdiction
of the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
Last spring the Zetes were faced with the possi
bility of expulsion and the loss of on-campus
privileges.
