# Computers replace secretaries
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
One of the bottlenecks in American in
dustry, according to a story in the paper
the other day, is the old-fashioned prac
tice of writing letters instead of dictating
them to secretaries, or better yet,
machines.
Office automation has made the secret
ary unnecessary, it seems, though certain
old dogs still like to have them around
"just for the status."
However, an executive who has learned
how to dictate to a machine can dictate
twice as fast as he can to a secretary, we
are told, and four to six times faster than
he can write by hand. I can see that dictat
ing to a machine would be faster than
writing by hand, but I'm not convinced it
would be faster than dictating to a good
secretary.
Few executives can dictate a sensible
letter faster than a good secretary can
take it in shorthand, and at the same time
the secretary would be leaving out the
uh's and expletives, and putting commas
in the right places, which a machine
wouldn't (as far as I know).
I do see the problem. It does not make
sense tor a man who is being paid
$250,000 a year plus stock options to
spend half an hour hunched over a yellow
pad scratching out a couple of hundred
words that will result in a million-dollar
deal when he could dictate six letters in
the same time and make six million-dollar
deals before sending out for a sandwich.
(Bv the way, whom does he send out for

the sandwich?)
The old boss-secretary symbiosis has
been made obsolete by the women's
movement, and the office automaters
have merely come along at the right time
with a machine to take its place. It may be
some time before executives realize just
how much they have lost by the replace
ment of intelligent secretaries with
robots, but that is one of the unintended
side effects that all reforms bring.
One hardly dares argue with the au
tomaters these days, for tear of not being
plugged in when they take over. But I'm
not sure about something one of them
said in that story the other day. He said:
"Anything that is written can be dic
tated." Dictated work may then be sent to
a "word processing department," which
will return a "rough draft that the author
can "edit and correct."
There's the rub. It is the editing and
correcting that takes the time.
For some reason the first thing that
comes to mind is Elizabeth Barrett Brown
ing's Sonnets from the Portuguese. I can t
see those sonnets being dictated. I have
an idea that Elizabeth wrote them verv
painstakingly, scratching out a lot of
words in favor of better ones, and crumpl
ing up dozens of rough drafts, and drop
ping them in her wastebasket before she
was satisfied. I doubt very much that she
simply started out with:
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways . . .
If we could find and uncrumple her first

draft it would probably go like this:
How much do I love you?
At which point the poor lovesick
woman uttered some Victorian oath,
crumpled up her paper and began again:
How many ways do I love thee>
And so on.
Of course, business letters are not son
nets. But it is even more important tor
them to be clear. An ambiguity can have
graver consequences in a business letter
than it can in a love letter. At least a mis
understanding caused by an ambiguity in
a love letter is easier to repair, with no
harm done worse than a tew tears and a
broken engagement. In business it can
cost money.
We are told that the justices of the U.S.
Supreme Court write their opinions. Is it
possible that the great dissenters Oliver
Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis
could have dictated such lucid, graceful
and closely reasoned masterpieces into a
machine and then sent them off to the
word processing department?
I wish that I could say that the love
letter itself, the last preserve of creative
letter writing, with its pain and ecstasy,
has not gone electronic. But with handy
tape recorders in everyone's possession,
and cassettes easily sent through the mail,
no doubt love affairs are now sustained or
ended by that means.
Alas, I'm afraid this generation's grand
children will find no bundle of tear
stained letters in their grandmothers' attic
trunks.

ment of intelligent secretaries with
robots, but that is one of the unintended
side effects that all reforms bring.
One hardly dares argue with the au
tomaters these days, for tear of not being
plugged in when they take over. But I'm
not sure about something one of them
said in that story the other day. He said:
"Anything that is written can be dic
tated." Dictated work may then be sent to
a "word processing department," which
will return a "rough draft that the author
can "edit and correct."
There's the rub. It is the editing and
correcting that takes the time.
For some reason the first thing that
comes to mind is Elizabeth Barrett Brown
ing's Sonnets from the Portuguese. I can t
see those sonnets being dictated. I have
an idea that Elizabeth wrote them verv
painstakingly, scratching out a lot of
words in favor of better ones, and crumpl
ing up dozens of rough drafts, and drop
ping them in her wastebasket before she
was satisfied. I doubt very much that she
simply started out with:
How do I love thee?
Let me count the ways . . .
If we could find and uncrumple her first

draft it would probably go like this:
How much do I love you?
At which point the poor lovesick
woman uttered some Victorian oath,
crumpled up her paper and began again:
How many ways do I love thee>
And so on.
Of course, business letters are not son
nets. But it is even more important tor
them to be clear. An ambiguity can have
graver consequences in a business letter
than it can in a love letter. At least a mis
understanding caused by an ambiguity in
a love letter is easier to repair, with no
harm done worse than a tew tears and a
broken engagement. In business it can
cost money.
We are told that the justices of the U.S.
Supreme Court write their opinions. Is it
possible that the great dissenters Oliver
Wendell Holmes and Louis Brandeis
could have dictated such lucid, graceful
and closely reasoned masterpieces into a
machine and then sent them off to the
word processing department?
I wish that I could say that the love
letter itself, the last preserve of creative
letter writing, with its pain and ecstasy,
has not gone electronic. But with handy
tape recorders in everyone's possession,
and cassettes easily sent through the mail,
no doubt love affairs are now sustained or
ended by that means.
Alas, I'm afraid this generation's grand
children will find no bundle of tear
stained letters in their grandmothers' attic
trunks.
One of the bottlenecks in American in
dustry, according to a story in the paper
the other day, is the old-fashioned prac
tice of writing letters instead of dictating
them to secretaries, or better yet,
machines.
Office automation has made the secret
ary unnecessary, it seems, though certain
old dogs still like to have them around
"just for the status."
However, an executive who has learned
how to dictate to a machine can dictate
twice as fast as he can to a secretary, we
are told, and four to six times faster than
he can write by hand. I can see that dictat
ing to a machine would be faster than
writing by hand, but I'm not convinced it
would be faster than dictating to a good
secretary.
Few executives can dictate a sensible
letter faster than a good secretary can
take it in shorthand, and at the same time
the secretary would be leaving out the
uh's and expletives, and putting commas
in the right places, which a machine
wouldn't (as far as I know).
I do see the problem. It does not make
sense tor a man who is being paid
$250,000 a year plus stock options to
spend half an hour hunched over a yellow
pad scratching out a couple of hundred
words that will result in a million-dollar
deal when he could dictate six letters in
the same time and make six million-dollar
deals before sending out for a sandwich.
(Bv the way, whom does he send out for

the sandwich?)
The old boss-secretary symbiosis has
been made obsolete by the women's
movement, and the office automaters
have merely come along at the right time
with a machine to take its place. It may be
some time before executives realize just
how much they have lost by the replace
ment of intelligent secretaries with
robots, but that is one of the unintended
side effects that all reforms bring.
