## The victory isn't always everything
### 
In an essay titled "Intellec
tuals and Ballplayers/' Roger
Kahn theorizes on a fascinat
ing arid unhappy paradox,
which he calls the "tragedy of
fulfillment." Despite their
physical gifts and material re
wards, Kahn says, professional
athletes frequently remain un
satisfied with their lives. Their
eminence burdens them more
than it blesses them — fame is
bothersome, fans are intrusive
and a family becomes distant.
Tim Mayotte has no such
problems. As a junior at Stan
ford, his concerns are the
same as most other students.
As a top member of the varsity
tennis team, he is subject to
pressure, but he faces none of
the dilemmas a professional
athlete often endures.
Recently, however, Mayotte
did what few pro tennis
players ever do — he defeated
Jimmy Connors, the world's
third-ranked performer be
hind Bjorn Borg and John
McEnroe, last Tuesday in the
Transamerica Open at San
Francisco's Cow Palace.
One would expect Mayotte
to deliriously exult over his de
feat of Chris Evert Lloyd's
former paramour. After all,
amateurs don't defeat world
class stars every day.
Vet Mayotte reflects on his
conquest almost with regret.
Like the pro ballplayers whose
feats fail to bring them happi
ness, Mayotte believes that his
rare achievement has more
negative than positive aspects.
"I think it was traumatic to
win the match, just because I

hadn't beaten anybody like
that before and people look at
me differently now," Mayotte
says.
Mayotte affirmed that when
he said "traumatic," he meant
to imply "negative connota
tions. It's just like any transi
tion," Mayotte explained.
"Any change is difficult for
anybody.
"To all of a sudden jump
into beating somebody that
big — that's why I think it was
so traumatic. It would have
been nicer if it had been a
slower transition," he elabo
rated. Because most of his
previous victories came
against players with rankings
around No. 100, unseating a
king such as Connors can in
deed be considered an abrupt
rise to the top.
This is not to say that the
consequences of Mayotte's
victory were totally unfortu
nate. He felt some beneficial
effects the next night when he
defeated Trey Waltke, the
world's 41st-ranked player.
Mayotte said that he felt
considerably self-assured in
the wake of the Connors
match, thus preventing a let
down.
"I was tired (against
Waltke), but I guess you just
have a lot of confidence after
beating a player like Con
nors," he said.
Mayotte's tone grew res
igned when he mentioned the
other changes in his life he has
noticed since Sept. 23.
"The players themselves
treat you differently — they

give you more respect . . .
there are more reporters, and
agents waiting for you to turn
pro."
Even before his status al
tered, Mayotte was touted as
one of the more impressive
collegiate performers. Playing
mostly No. 3 singles on the
Cardinals' NCAA Champion
ship team last season, Mayotte
won 19 straight matches at one
point.
Mayotte isn't sure how the
Connors victory will influence
his 1981 season. "That remains
to be seen — it depends on
how much people play it up."
He realized, however, that
most opponents will probably

regard him the same way most
NFL teams regard the
Pittsburgh Steelers — they will
try extra-hard to beat him. "I
think that win will stick with
me tor a while," Mayotte ad
mitted.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
thinks that Mayotte, who in
tends to turn pro after he
graduates, will duplicate the
Connors feat in the future.
"This is just the tip of the
iceberg for him," Gould said.
"Tim can definitely be a
world-class player."
Yet as Kahn points out,
being world-class sometimes
isn't enough. Tim Mayotte is
lucky to be learning that now.
