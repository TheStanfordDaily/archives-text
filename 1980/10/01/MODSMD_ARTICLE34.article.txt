# Sturm calls four-set victory 'best performance ever'
## 
### Val Vaden 
In what head coach Fred
Sturm called "the best per
formance ever for a Stanford
women's volleyball te,im," the
Cardinal women served the
University of Hawau-Hilo its
first defeat of this season, 15-7,
10-15, 16-14, 16-14. The match
was every bit as close and ex
citing as the scores indicate.
"We played well in every
phase of the game," said
Sturm, "and we played as a
team. I really can't single out
one player. But if I do single
out one thing, it would be the
crowd. They were as much of a
factor in our comeback as any
thing."
Sturm was referring to a
foot-stomping, hand-clapping
bunch of Stanford partisans
who offered their encourage
ment during the critical final
moments of the third and
fourth game.
"We played well most of the
time," she explained, "but this
was only our third game of the
season and our inexperience
really showed. Too often we
could've won tonight but we
made mistakes which cost us."
Atter handily winning the
first game 15-7, capitalizing on
a slow start by the Vulcan wo
men, Stanford found itself
subject to some strategic er
rors which allowed Hawaii to
do some of its own capitaliz
ing.
The two teams played fairly
evenly through most of the
game and traded serves seven
times with Hawaii leading
12-10.
But in a flurry of cross-court
spikes and quick-sets, the Vul

cans soon led 14-10. One of
the Stanford setters then car
ried the ball to give Hawaii the
final point.
The third game, punctuated
by missed spikes on both
sides, was tied four times dur
ing the game, at 5-5, 10-10,
13-13 and 14-14. The Stanford
women, urged on by the fans,
finally scored the final two
points on a booming spike by
Chris Anderson and an ace by
Deanna Boyette.
Early on in the fourth game,
it looked as if Stanford would
run away with the match as

they stored seven straight
points under the direction and
solid performance of play cal
ler )an Linden.
However, the Hawaii
women battled back to an
11-11 tie before jumping ahead
14-12 after two spikes by Vul
can standout Glennie Adams.
But then the Stanford crowd
came alive, cheering the
women to score the next four
points, the final two coming
from a quick-set spike by
Sandy Harris that was over al
most before it was hit, and
another solid shot by Ander
son.
