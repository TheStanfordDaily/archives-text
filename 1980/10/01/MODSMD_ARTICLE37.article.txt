# Card ruggers on upswing
## 
### David Zaro 
Last year signaled a new be
ginning tor Stanford rugby.
Since 1974 when rugby lost its
varsity status it has struggled
to compete as a club sport.
Having lost its status, coaches
and funding, rugby struggled
to compete against the power
ful Bay Area university and
club sides. The 1979-80 season
saw the return of quality rubgy
to the Farm.
After two early losses
against the most powerful of
the Bay Area clubs, the XO's
and the Bats, the ruggers hit
stride with victories over every
collegiate side on the West
Coast. Included in their string
were victories over UCLA (11-
0), Santa Clara (56-0), and UC
Davis (27-6). The regular sea
son was highlighted by the
rugger's victory over Califor
nia, in which Stanford retained
the sacred Scrum Axe. Cal
eventually went on to win the
Collegiate National Title.
The Cards ended their sea
son with a 4-1 record at the
Monterey National Champ
ionships. Its only loss was to
the winner of the national ti
tle, lames Bay Athletic Club.
During this tournament the
Cards avenged an early season
loss to the XO's in a nationally
televised contest.
The ruggers' expanded
schedule this year will include
competition in the Interna
tional Collegiate Conference,
pitting the Cards against the
University of British Columbia,
University of Victoria, UCLA,
Long Beach State, and Cal.
Stanford will again host its an
nual 10-A-Side tournament on
Dec. 6. The tournament marks
the unofficial start of the
Northern California Rugby
Season,with over 45 teams
competing in men's and wo
men's divisions.
Coach Rod Sears returns
this year to a head coaching

staff of Rich Cortez, Sam Hals
ted, and Tom O'Grady. Sears
faces a formidable task of re
building a Stanford squad
which lost 11 out of 15 starters.
Nevertheless, Sears feels that
the depth of last year's squad
coupled with a strong turnout
of new players will provide a
strong nucleus for this year's
team. Returning standouts in
clude Frank Hicks, inside
center, John Walecka, lock
and Jamie Turner, fullback.
An end-of-the-year tour of
Europe provides an extra in
centive for this year's squad.
This three-week tour will
begin in England with matches

against Oxford and Cam
bridge. The squad then travels
to France to play several Paris
University sides ending the
tour with a match against the
University of Monte Carlo.
The club's philosophy as al
ways will be that everyone
who comes to practice will
play. Team camaraderie and
continuous kegs provide as
much fun off the field as on.
An organizational meeting will
be held on Oct. 9 at the D.U.
House and an informal train
ing session will be on Satur
day, Oct. 4, at 9:30 A.M. on
Maloney Field. All students are
welcome.
