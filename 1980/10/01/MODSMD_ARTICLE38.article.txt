## Kim Belton axed by Phoenix 
### 
Stanford all-time leading
scorer and rebounder Kim
berly Belton was cut Monday
night by the Phoenix Suns of
the National Basketball As
sociation.
Belton, a second-round
draft choice and the first of the
draft by Phoenix, "just
couldn't do inside there what
he did in the Pac-10," said his
agent, Palo Alto attorney
Stephen Blick. Though his
6-foot-7, 220-pound build was
big enough to punish oppos
ing players, Belton was just
another small forward in the
NBA.
"He had a good opportun
ity. The Suns lived up to their
word," Blick said. "Jerry Col
angelo told me last week that
they were pleased, that Kim
was giving just a super effort.
"Kim felt he did an outstand
ing job of putting forth his
best. Looking back, he gave
his best and if that wasn't good
enough, then there was no
thing he could do," Blick ad
ded.
Belton will return to the Bay
Area today or tomorrow and
then decide whether his fu
ture lies on the court or in the
business world.
