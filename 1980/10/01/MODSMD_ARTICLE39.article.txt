# Holmes, Ali ready to fight

Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) â€”
"I'm in bad shape. You
guys are bad luck," Larry
Holmes told reporters yes
terday while getting away
from the training grind by
doing some gambling.
"Have you guys ever had
a press conference at a dice
table in your life?" the
World Boxing Council
heavyweight champion,
who fights Muhammad Ali
tomorrow night, asked re
porters who sought him out
to inquire about his eye.
"You want to see the
eye," Holmes asked, re
moving tinted glasses. "I
got thumbed, big deal."
Holmes said he got
thumbed in the left eye
while sparring Sunday with
Wendell Bailey. The eye did
not appear bloodshot nor
was there any swelling
around it.
Holmes appeared on na
tional television Monday
night wearing the glasses,
which caused some specu
lation that he might be try
ing to hide something. But
they are prescription glas

ses that he has used for
some time.
The unbeaten 30-year-old
champion was irritated by
rumors of other physical
problems. "They said
something is wrong with
my left arm and somebody
wrote I had a sore throat.
"The only thing wrong
with me," said Holmes,
who talked while shooting
craps at Caesar's Palace, "Is
I have no arms and legs. I 'm
going to have to fight this
guy handicapped. That
makes the fight even. He's
an old man."
The 38-year-old Ali stayed
away from the gym yester
day and Holmes did, too,
for the second straight day.
"Hey, man, I had 210
rounds of boxing," said
Holmes. "Would you work?
I'm at 210 pounds and want
to go in at 213. This is the
fourth fight this year. I've
been very active and I'm
good."
The weigh-in is
scheduled for 11 a.m. to
day, and figures to be a
showcase for Ali who al

ways holds center stage at
such functions.
Ali, who has not fought
since beating Leon Spinks
Sept. 15, 1978, saw his
weight balloon into the
2505. Now it is down to
about 220, and Ali has said,
"This is my first miracle."
The second, he says, will be
his becoming heavyweight
champion for the fourth
time.
"I didn't intend to come
back," said Ali. "Then I saw
Weaver (Mike Weaver, the
World Boxing Association
champion). I saw Holmes
and I said, 'Hey, man, I can
win the title a fourth time."
The bout, which will be
shown on closed-circuit
television in about 300 loca
tions in the United States
and Canada, will start at
about 7:30 p.m., PDT #
Ali is getting $8 million,
Holmes $3.5 million plus a
percentage of the ancillary
income.
The bout also will be
seen live and on a delayed
basis in 40 to 50 other coun
tries.
