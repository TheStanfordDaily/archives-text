# Iraqi nuclear facility bombed; Iranians dig in to halt invasion
## 
### 
Beirut, Lebanon (LAT/WP) — Ira
nian U.S.-made Phantom fighter
bombers attacked the Iraqi nuclear
research center on the outskirts of
Baghdad yesterday but the nuclear
reactors were reportedly undam
aged.
It was the first bombing raid by
the Iranian air force on the sensitive
multimillion-dollar nuclear research
facility, set up by the French to assist
the Iraqis.
The Iranian fighter-bombers also
pounded the city's power station,
killing or wounding dozens of
Iraqis.
In Khuzestan, Iraqi troops were
locked in battle with Iranian defen
ders six miles south of the provincial
capital of Ahwaz, AP correspondent
Jeffrey Ulrich reported from the
scene. Ahwaz, 50 miles inside Iran,
is believed to be a key target of the
Iraqi offensive.
Seven miles south of Ahwaz,
hardpressed Iranians were reported
still holding off Iraqi troops at the
port of Khorramshahr and the refin
ery city of Abadan, both across the
Shatt al-Arab estuary from Iraq.
The U.S. and Soviet Union step
ped up international efforts to end
the war.
The attack came during a day
when diplomatic peacekeeping ef
forts seemed to be fruitless, and
when Iraqi ground forces appeared
to be concentrating for a final attack
on Iranian cities in the oil-producing
province of Khuzistan.
Meanwhile, the United States an
nounced that it was sending four
Boeing-707 AWACS Air Force planes
— with a radar-seeking capability of
about 250 miles — to Saudi Arabia to
help monitor events in the Persian
Gulf.
In Tehran, the Majlis (Parliament)
appointed a seven-man commission
to study the question of the 52
American hostages, but disagreed
over what to do next.
In other developments, Egypt of
fered to defend any of the smaller
Gulf states that might be attacked by
their larger neighbors. This was seen
as a way to insure that the sheik
doms were not drawn into the con
flict by either side.
In Baghdad, the U.N. peacekeep
ing mission headed by President Zia
ul-Haq of Pakistan met again yester
day with Iraqi President Hussein.
Hussein reiterated his response to
the U.N. Security Council resolution
calling for a rapid cease-fire. Accord
ing to the official Baath Party news
paper, he said:
"Iraq once again affirmed its high
responsibility when it announced
acceptance of the United Nations
Security Council resolution for a
cease-fire with Iran."
Earlier yesterday, Iranian jets
struck a large oil-fueled power plant
southwest of Baghdad, setting fire to
oil storage tanks.
Eyewitnesses said two or three
Iranian warplanes were downed by
the Soviet-made surface-to-air anti
aircraft missiles.
But later in the day, the Iranian air
force returned to strike the vast

Osirak nuclear testing center near
Baghdad.
The suspicion grows, at least on
'he Ahwaz front, that the Iranian
Army pulled back quick!/ and effi
ciently to the fulls around the city as
soon as the Iraqis began to advance.
The Iranians may have thus con
ceded to Iraq almost 1000 square
miles of territory — but it is 1000
square miles of worthless, unde
fendable wastes.
The evidence ot the past few days
is not only that Iraq's advance into
Iran has halted, but that the Iranians
have moved more artillery up to
their newly dug-in front — perhaps
even in preparation for a counterat
tack.
In the air, the Iranian Air Force is

not fielding massive numbers of
planes, but on this southern front it
is fielding more than the Iraqis.
lournalists visiting Iraq's positions
just north of Khorramshahr came
under heavy shellfire yesterday;
previously, the Iranians did not ap
pear to have the capability to deliver
artillery barrages against those Iraqi
positions.
As a result, Iraq's advance into
Khorramshahr, which had already
bogged down in the first few streets
of the city, appeared stymied.
The Iraqi invasion, which eight
days ago appeared likely to sweep
through large parts of southwestern
Iran, has clearly been halted short of
every target of real strategic value.

paper, he said:
"Iraq once again affirmed its high
responsibility when it announced
acceptance of the United Nations
Security Council resolution for a
cease-fire with Iran."
Earlier yesterday, Iranian jets
struck a large oil-fueled power plant
southwest of Baghdad, setting fire to
oil storage tanks.
Eyewitnesses said two or three
Iranian warplanes were downed by
the Soviet-made surface-to-air anti
aircraft missiles.
But later in the day, the Iranian air
force returned to strike the vast

Osirak nuclear testing center near
Baghdad.
The suspicion grows, at least on
'he Ahwaz front, that the Iranian
Army pulled back quick!/ and effi
ciently to the fulls around the city as
soon as the Iraqis began to advance.
The Iranians may have thus con
ceded to Iraq almost 1000 square
miles of territory — but it is 1000
square miles of worthless, unde
fendable wastes.
The evidence ot the past few days
is not only that Iraq's advance into
Iran has halted, but that the Iranians
have moved more artillery up to
their newly dug-in front — perhaps
even in preparation for a counterat
tack.
In the air, the Iranian Air Force is

not fielding massive numbers of
planes, but on this southern front it
is fielding more than the Iraqis.
lournalists visiting Iraq's positions
just north of Khorramshahr came
under heavy shellfire yesterday;
previously, the Iranians did not ap
pear to have the capability to deliver
artillery barrages against those Iraqi
positions.
As a result, Iraq's advance into
Khorramshahr, which had already
bogged down in the first few streets
of the city, appeared stymied.
The Iraqi invasion, which eight
days ago appeared likely to sweep
through large parts of southwestern
Iran, has clearly been halted short of
every target of real strategic value.
Beirut, Lebanon (LAT/WP) — Ira
nian U.S.-made Phantom fighter
bombers attacked the Iraqi nuclear
research center on the outskirts of
Baghdad yesterday but the nuclear
reactors were reportedly undam
aged.
It was the first bombing raid by
the Iranian air force on the sensitive
multimillion-dollar nuclear research
facility, set up by the French to assist
the Iraqis.
The Iranian fighter-bombers also
pounded the city's power station,
killing or wounding dozens of
Iraqis.
In Khuzestan, Iraqi troops were
locked in battle with Iranian defen
ders six miles south of the provincial
capital of Ahwaz, AP correspondent
Jeffrey Ulrich reported from the
scene. Ahwaz, 50 miles inside Iran,
is believed to be a key target of the
Iraqi offensive.
Seven miles south of Ahwaz,
hardpressed Iranians were reported
still holding off Iraqi troops at the
port of Khorramshahr and the refin
ery city of Abadan, both across the
Shatt al-Arab estuary from Iraq.
The U.S. and Soviet Union step
ped up international efforts to end
the war.
The attack came during a day
when diplomatic peacekeeping ef
forts seemed to be fruitless, and
when Iraqi ground forces appeared
to be concentrating for a final attack
on Iranian cities in the oil-producing
province of Khuzistan.
Meanwhile, the United States an
nounced that it was sending four
Boeing-707 AWACS Air Force planes
— with a radar-seeking capability of
about 250 miles — to Saudi Arabia to
help monitor events in the Persian
Gulf.
In Tehran, the Majlis (Parliament)
appointed a seven-man commission
to study the question of the 52
American hostages, but disagreed
over what to do next.
In other developments, Egypt of
fered to defend any of the smaller
Gulf states that might be attacked by
their larger neighbors. This was seen
as a way to insure that the sheik
doms were not drawn into the con
flict by either side.
In Baghdad, the U.N. peacekeep
ing mission headed by President Zia
ul-Haq of Pakistan met again yester
day with Iraqi President Hussein.
Hussein reiterated his response to
the U.N. Security Council resolution
calling for a rapid cease-fire. Accord
