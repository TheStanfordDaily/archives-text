Polish trade unions reject pay policy
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government's newly
announced pay policy was denounced yesterday by the
country's new independent trade unions as "disinfor
mation," and a union spokesman said that one-hour
walkouts at selected sites were still planned for Friday.
Further delay in implementing agreements reached
with striking workers across the country in the last
month would bring a general strike on Oct. 20, the
spokesman for the new union confederation called Sol
idarity reiterated.
"If the prime minister or deputy prime minister went
on the air or said on the television and said our de
mands would be met by a definite period of time, we
would call off the strikes," the spokesman said.
The dispute over implementing the massive wage
increases is just half of the continuing struggle between
the government and the rapidly growing free trade
union movement.
In addition, the new unions are complaining that
local officials continue to interfere with their organizing
moves, as they take members away from the traditional
labor organizations dominated by the ruling Com
munist Party.
The government said that its new wage program
would go into effect in October, but the Solidarity
spokesman disputed that.
"Our people visit the plants and the directors say
they (the pay raises) will take place later or next year,"
the spokesman said. "It (the government statement) is
disinformation."
Union sources said that workers in the V.I. Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk, leaders of the original strike last
month, have been given their promised wage increase
in full. But other enterprises have been given propor
tionately smaller shares of the promised increases, with
some workers getting only 30 percent or 40 percent of
what they were promised.
Government spokesman warned last week that the
country could scarcely afford the agreed-upon wage
increases unless there was a big increase in work pro
ductivity. The wage agreement will cost the govern
ment the equivalent of an estimated 53.5 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the gross national product is in decline
and there is rising inflation.
Flood threatens railbed, land
Stockton — Cracks showed yesterday in a narrow,
fragile railbed holding back swirling delta floodwaters
from aqueducts and thousands of acres of crops, spur
ring the addition of another 100 men and women to
shore up the embankment.
"We want to get the job done right away as extra
insurance," said California Conservation Corps
spokesman Richard Steffen. He said the added crews,

paid by state and tederal funds, were requested ur
gently by the state's water resources officials.
The new workers bring to 160 the CCC crews bolster
ing 5Vj miles of the Santa Fe Railroad mainline route
between Stockton and San Francisco. The rocks are
coming from a railroad quarry in Arizona.
Santa Fe spokeswoman Susan Saltzer said the rail line
under assault was being watched "hour by hour" with
the possibility it would be closed down it serious un
dermining occurs.
If the line goes, she said, Santa Fe would reroute to
the Bay Area on Southern Pacific tracks.
The rail line is the only thing holding back 5700 acres
of floodwaters drowning the Lower )ones Tract from
another 45,000 acres of harvest-ready farms and the
main aqueducts serving a million residents of Oakland
and other East Bay cities. Even if the 4'/2-foot diameter
pipelines do break, the East Bay has some six months of
water in reservoirs.
Warning planes for Saudi Arabia
Washington — The United States is rushing four spe
cial earlv warning radar planes to Saudi Arabia to help
strengthen the oil-rich country's air defenses against a
possible spread ot the war between Iraq and Iran, the
Pentagon announced yesterday.
In announcing the shipment of the highly sophisti
cated planes, U.S. officials said the deployment is tem
porary and stressed that the move does not mean the
U.S. is taking sides in the Iran-Iraq war.
"This deployment is purely for defensive purposes. It
is designed to track aircraft for the purpose of provid
ing additional warning for Saudi Arabian defenses,"
said Pentagon spokesman Thomas Ross.
Saudi Arabia has indicated its support for Iraq in the
fighting with Iran. However, U.S. defense officials said
they have no reason to believe the Saudis will be relay
ing to Iraq any military data provided by the American
radar planes, known as AYVACS.
Ross told a Pentagon press briefing the decision to
deploy the aircraft was made "in response to a request
from the government of Saudi Arabia."
Greece may be forced out of NATO
Washington — Greece will be forced to withdraw
from NATO "finally and irrevocably" and to take over
American military bases there if a new formula for
Creek membership in the alliance is not found "within
the next few weeks," Foreign Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis said in an interview. "But Greece must re
turn to the alliance or it must withdraw its application
for a return before the Creek elections next year."
Mitsotakis' remarks were the first explicit statement
that his center-right coalition, headed by President
Constantine Karamanlis, cannot afford politically to go

into elections with the NATO question unresolved and
American bases still on Greek soil. The elections must
be held by the autumn of 1981.
His comments also provided an extended public air
ing ot private warnings that the Greeks have been send
ing to the Carter administration since june. These warn
ings appear to have intensified in the wake of last
month's military coup in Turkey.
Mitsotakis said that he had conveyed the warning
again this week in a discussion here with Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie. Both men are attending the U.N.
General Assembly's fall session.
The United States risks losing four major military
installations in Greece, including a strategically impor
tant naval base and a regional electronic surveillance
center that tracks Soviet movements in the eastern
Mediterranean. Both facilities are located on the island
of Crete.
Greece and Turkey are deadlocked over Greek insis
tence that its reentry into the alliance include opera
tional control of sea and air lanes as part of NATO's
detense planning. Turkey's refusal to agree has blocked
the unanimous decision needed from NATO members
to readmit Greece.
White House pushes steel agreement
Washington — The steel industry agreement an
nounced by President |immy Carter yesterday is more a
truce than a final settlement of the long-running con
frontation between the steel producers and the federal
government.
The negotiations that produced the steel tripartite
agreement represented an experiment in a different
way of balancing the conflicting goals of companies,
unions and consumers.
The Carter White House, which pushed hard for a
consensus, sees the steel industry as the prime exam
ple of a new approach to solving the most .serious,
stubborn domestic policy impasses.
"We will have to rely more on cooperation between
the private sector and government," Carter's chief
domestic adviser, Stuart Eizenstat, told reporters yes
terday. "We think this is an important process, and we
need this cooperation to solve the problems of the
1980s."
Despite the agreement to ask Congress to grant
companies more time to meet the next round of
pollution-control deadlines, Big Steel is unlikely to
abandon plans for a tough lobbying campaign next year
to soften the clean-air and water regulations, some
steel officials said.
And, despite the agreement, the Environmental Pro
tection Agency will continue to use court-imposed
deadlines to enforce compliance with existing
pollution-control schedules.

Reagan opposes grain embargo
New York — From the cornfields ot lowa to the con
crete canyons ot Manhattan, Ronald Reagan searched
tor votes yesterday by emphasizing that he had
changed his views on two issues — the grain embargo
against Russia, and tinancial aid to New York.
Standing in the shade of a tree on a farm 45 miles
northeast of Des Moines, the Republican presidential
nominee assured a crowd of about 200 persons that he
is against the grain embargo.
When President jimmy Carter tirst imposed the ban
last Jan. 4, Reagan endorsed it.
Reagan issued a statement over the weekend oppos
ing a move in Congress to lessen the availability of
federal funds tor the city. Since the days he once said
he prayed that New York would not get federal aid,
Reagan has slowly moved from opposition to neutrality,
and now to support for legislation to continue bail out
funds for the city.
Cereal 'monopoly' costs consumers
Washington — A monopoly among the nation's major
producers of ready-to-eat cereals cost the nation's con
sumers more than $1.2 billion in higher grocery store
prices between 1958 and 1972, overcharges that add 15
percent to every dollar spent for the cereal products,
the staff of the Federal Trade Commission charged yes
terday.
Release ot the new data and the charges about al
leged industry monopoly practices is the final commis
sion staff volley in the eight-year legal battle surround
ing the FTC's controversial cereals case.
The FTC staff also said yesterday the companies that
are the targets of a landmark FTC antitrust case and the
three major players in the industry — Kellogg Co.,
General Mills Inc. and General Foods Corp. — com
piled overcharges of more than $420 million tor the
five-year period ending with 1970 and are responsible
for about $1 billion of the 15-year excessive consumer
prices.
Dow Jones average rebounds
New York — The stock market gained ground today,
rallying after the steep decline of the last three ses
sions.
The Dow jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen more than 43 points since last Wednesday, re
bounded 6.91 to 928.84 by 2 p.m. Gainers outnumbered
losers by close to a 2-1 margin among New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues.
The NYSE's composite index rose .67 to 71.93. At the
American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
up 3.72 at 328.10. Volume on the Big Board totaled 28
million shares with two hours to go.

under assault was being watched "hour by hour" with
the possibility it would be closed down it serious un
dermining occurs.
If the line goes, she said, Santa Fe would reroute to
the Bay Area on Southern Pacific tracks.
The rail line is the only thing holding back 5700 acres
of floodwaters drowning the Lower )ones Tract from
another 45,000 acres of harvest-ready farms and the
main aqueducts serving a million residents of Oakland
and other East Bay cities. Even if the 4'/2-foot diameter

Warning planes for Saudi Arabia
Washington — The United States is rushing four spe
cial earlv warning radar planes to Saudi Arabia to help
strengthen the oil-rich country's air defenses against a
possible spread ot the war between Iraq and Iran, the
Pentagon announced yesterday.
In announcing the shipment of the highly sophisti
cated planes, U.S. officials said the deployment is tem
porary and stressed that the move does not mean the
U.S. is taking sides in the Iran-Iraq war.
"This deployment is purely for defensive purposes. It
is designed to track aircraft for the purpose of provid
ing additional warning for Saudi Arabian defenses,"
said Pentagon spokesman Thomas Ross.
Saudi Arabia has indicated its support for Iraq in the
fighting with Iran. However, U.S. defense officials said
they have no reason to believe the Saudis will be relay
ing to Iraq any military data provided by the American
radar planes, known as AYVACS.
Ross told a Pentagon press briefing the decision to
deploy the aircraft was made "in response to a request
from the government of Saudi Arabia."
Greece may be forced out of NATO
Washington — Greece will be forced to withdraw
from NATO "finally and irrevocably" and to take over
American military bases there if a new formula for
Creek membership in the alliance is not found "within
the next few weeks," Foreign Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis said in an interview. "But Greece must re
turn to the alliance or it must withdraw its application
for a return before the Creek elections next year."
Mitsotakis' remarks were the first explicit statement
that his center-right coalition, headed by President
Constantine Karamanlis, cannot afford politically to go

into elections with the NATO question unresolved and
American bases still on Greek soil. The elections must
be held by the autumn of 1981.
His comments also provided an extended public air
ing ot private warnings that the Greeks have been send
ing to the Carter administration since june. These warn
ings appear to have intensified in the wake of last
month's military coup in Turkey.
Mitsotakis said that he had conveyed the warning
again this week in a discussion here with Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie. Both men are attending the U.N.
General Assembly's fall session.
The United States risks losing four major military
installations in Greece, including a strategically impor
tant naval base and a regional electronic surveillance
center that tracks Soviet movements in the eastern
Mediterranean. Both facilities are located on the island
of Crete.
Greece and Turkey are deadlocked over Greek insis
tence that its reentry into the alliance include opera
tional control of sea and air lanes as part of NATO's
detense planning. Turkey's refusal to agree has blocked
the unanimous decision needed from NATO members
to readmit Greece.
White House pushes steel agreement
Washington — The steel industry agreement an
nounced by President |immy Carter yesterday is more a
truce than a final settlement of the long-running con
frontation between the steel producers and the federal
government.
The negotiations that produced the steel tripartite
agreement represented an experiment in a different
way of balancing the conflicting goals of companies,
unions and consumers.
The Carter White House, which pushed hard for a
consensus, sees the steel industry as the prime exam
ple of a new approach to solving the most .serious,
stubborn domestic policy impasses.
"We will have to rely more on cooperation between
the private sector and government," Carter's chief
domestic adviser, Stuart Eizenstat, told reporters yes
terday. "We think this is an important process, and we
need this cooperation to solve the problems of the
1980s."
Despite the agreement to ask Congress to grant
companies more time to meet the next round of
pollution-control deadlines, Big Steel is unlikely to
abandon plans for a tough lobbying campaign next year
to soften the clean-air and water regulations, some
steel officials said.
And, despite the agreement, the Environmental Pro
tection Agency will continue to use court-imposed
deadlines to enforce compliance with existing
pollution-control schedules.

Reagan opposes grain embargo
New York — From the cornfields ot lowa to the con
crete canyons ot Manhattan, Ronald Reagan searched
tor votes yesterday by emphasizing that he had
changed his views on two issues — the grain embargo
against Russia, and tinancial aid to New York.
Standing in the shade of a tree on a farm 45 miles
northeast of Des Moines, the Republican presidential
nominee assured a crowd of about 200 persons that he
is against the grain embargo.
When President jimmy Carter tirst imposed the ban
last Jan. 4, Reagan endorsed it.
Reagan issued a statement over the weekend oppos
ing a move in Congress to lessen the availability of
federal funds tor the city. Since the days he once said
he prayed that New York would not get federal aid,
Reagan has slowly moved from opposition to neutrality,
and now to support for legislation to continue bail out
funds for the city.
Cereal 'monopoly' costs consumers
Washington — A monopoly among the nation's major
producers of ready-to-eat cereals cost the nation's con

prices between 1958 and 1972, overcharges that add 15
percent to every dollar spent for the cereal products,
the staff of the Federal Trade Commission charged yes
terday.
Release ot the new data and the charges about al
leged industry monopoly practices is the final commis
sion staff volley in the eight-year legal battle surround
ing the FTC's controversial cereals case.
The FTC staff also said yesterday the companies that
are the targets of a landmark FTC antitrust case and the
three major players in the industry — Kellogg Co.,
General Mills Inc. and General Foods Corp. — com
piled overcharges of more than $420 million tor the
five-year period ending with 1970 and are responsible
for about $1 billion of the 15-year excessive consumer
prices.

Polish trade unions reject pay policy
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government's newly
announced pay policy was denounced yesterday by the
country's new independent trade unions as "disinfor
mation," and a union spokesman said that one-hour
walkouts at selected sites were still planned for Friday.
Further delay in implementing agreements reached
with striking workers across the country in the last
month would bring a general strike on Oct. 20, the
spokesman for the new union confederation called Sol
idarity reiterated.
"If the prime minister or deputy prime minister went
on the air or said on the television and said our de
mands would be met by a definite period of time, we
would call off the strikes," the spokesman said.
The dispute over implementing the massive wage
increases is just half of the continuing struggle between
the government and the rapidly growing free trade
union movement.
In addition, the new unions are complaining that
local officials continue to interfere with their organizing
moves, as they take members away from the traditional
labor organizations dominated by the ruling Com
munist Party.
The government said that its new wage program
would go into effect in October, but the Solidarity
spokesman disputed that.
"Our people visit the plants and the directors say
they (the pay raises) will take place later or next year,"
the spokesman said. "It (the government statement) is
disinformation."
Union sources said that workers in the V.I. Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk, leaders of the original strike last
month, have been given their promised wage increase
in full. But other enterprises have been given propor
tionately smaller shares of the promised increases, with
some workers getting only 30 percent or 40 percent of
what they were promised.
Government spokesman warned last week that the
country could scarcely afford the agreed-upon wage
increases unless there was a big increase in work pro
ductivity. The wage agreement will cost the govern
ment the equivalent of an estimated 53.5 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the gross national product is in decline
and there is rising inflation.
Flood threatens railbed, land
Stockton — Cracks showed yesterday in a narrow,
fragile railbed holding back swirling delta floodwaters
from aqueducts and thousands of acres of crops, spur
ring the addition of another 100 men and women to
shore up the embankment.
"We want to get the job done right away as extra
insurance," said California Conservation Corps
spokesman Richard Steffen. He said the added crews,

paid by state and tederal funds, were requested ur
gently by the state's water resources officials.
The new workers bring to 160 the CCC crews bolster
ing 5Vj miles of the Santa Fe Railroad mainline route
between Stockton and San Francisco. The rocks are
coming from a railroad quarry in Arizona.

White House pushes steel agreement
Washington — The steel industry agreement an
nounced by President |immy Carter yesterday is more a
truce than a final settlement of the long-running con
frontation between the steel producers and the federal
government.
The negotiations that produced the steel tripartite
agreement represented an experiment in a different
way of balancing the conflicting goals of companies,
unions and consumers.
The Carter White House, which pushed hard for a
consensus, sees the steel industry as the prime exam
ple of a new approach to solving the most .serious,
stubborn domestic policy impasses.
"We will have to rely more on cooperation between
the private sector and government," Carter's chief
domestic adviser, Stuart Eizenstat, told reporters yes
terday. "We think this is an important process, and we
need this cooperation to solve the problems of the
1980s."
Despite the agreement to ask Congress to grant
companies more time to meet the next round of
pollution-control deadlines, Big Steel is unlikely to
abandon plans for a tough lobbying campaign next year
to soften the clean-air and water regulations, some
steel officials said.
And, despite the agreement, the Environmental Pro
tection Agency will continue to use court-imposed
deadlines to enforce compliance with existing
pollution-control schedules.

Reagan opposes grain embargo
New York — From the cornfields ot lowa to the con

tor votes yesterday by emphasizing that he had
changed his views on two issues — the grain embargo
against Russia, and tinancial aid to New York.
Standing in the shade of a tree on a farm 45 miles
northeast of Des Moines, the Republican presidential
nominee assured a crowd of about 200 persons that he
is against the grain embargo.
When President jimmy Carter tirst imposed the ban
last Jan. 4, Reagan endorsed it.
Reagan issued a statement over the weekend oppos
ing a move in Congress to lessen the availability of
federal funds tor the city. Since the days he once said
he prayed that New York would not get federal aid,
Reagan has slowly moved from opposition to neutrality,
and now to support for legislation to continue bail out
funds for the city.
Cereal 'monopoly' costs consumers
Washington — A monopoly among the nation's major
producers of ready-to-eat cereals cost the nation's con
sumers more than $1.2 billion in higher grocery store
prices between 1958 and 1972, overcharges that add 15
percent to every dollar spent for the cereal products,
the staff of the Federal Trade Commission charged yes
terday.
Release ot the new data and the charges about al
leged industry monopoly practices is the final commis
sion staff volley in the eight-year legal battle surround
ing the FTC's controversial cereals case.
The FTC staff also said yesterday the companies that
are the targets of a landmark FTC antitrust case and the
three major players in the industry — Kellogg Co.,
General Mills Inc. and General Foods Corp. — com
piled overcharges of more than $420 million tor the
five-year period ending with 1970 and are responsible
for about $1 billion of the 15-year excessive consumer
prices.

Polish trade unions reject pay policy
Warsaw, Poland — The Polish government's newly
announced pay policy was denounced yesterday by the
country's new independent trade unions as "disinfor
mation," and a union spokesman said that one-hour
walkouts at selected sites were still planned for Friday.
Further delay in implementing agreements reached
with striking workers across the country in the last
month would bring a general strike on Oct. 20, the
spokesman for the new union confederation called Sol
idarity reiterated.
"If the prime minister or deputy prime minister went
on the air or said on the television and said our de
mands would be met by a definite period of time, we
would call off the strikes," the spokesman said.
The dispute over implementing the massive wage
increases is just half of the continuing struggle between
the government and the rapidly growing free trade
union movement.
In addition, the new unions are complaining that
local officials continue to interfere with their organizing
moves, as they take members away from the traditional
labor organizations dominated by the ruling Com
munist Party.
The government said that its new wage program
would go into effect in October, but the Solidarity
spokesman disputed that.
"Our people visit the plants and the directors say
they (the pay raises) will take place later or next year,"
the spokesman said. "It (the government statement) is
disinformation."
Union sources said that workers in the V.I. Lenin
Shipyard in Gdansk, leaders of the original strike last
month, have been given their promised wage increase
in full. But other enterprises have been given propor
tionately smaller shares of the promised increases, with
some workers getting only 30 percent or 40 percent of
what they were promised.
Government spokesman warned last week that the
country could scarcely afford the agreed-upon wage
increases unless there was a big increase in work pro
ductivity. The wage agreement will cost the govern
ment the equivalent of an estimated 53.5 billion a year.
Meanwhile, the gross national product is in decline
and there is rising inflation.
Flood threatens railbed, land
Stockton — Cracks showed yesterday in a narrow,
fragile railbed holding back swirling delta floodwaters
from aqueducts and thousands of acres of crops, spur
ring the addition of another 100 men and women to
shore up the embankment.
"We want to get the job done right away as extra
insurance," said California Conservation Corps
spokesman Richard Steffen. He said the added crews,

paid by state and tederal funds, were requested ur
gently by the state's water resources officials.
The new workers bring to 160 the CCC crews bolster
ing 5Vj miles of the Santa Fe Railroad mainline route
between Stockton and San Francisco. The rocks are
coming from a railroad quarry in Arizona.
Santa Fe spokeswoman Susan Saltzer said the rail line
under assault was being watched "hour by hour" with
the possibility it would be closed down it serious un
dermining occurs.
If the line goes, she said, Santa Fe would reroute to
the Bay Area on Southern Pacific tracks.
The rail line is the only thing holding back 5700 acres
of floodwaters drowning the Lower )ones Tract from
another 45,000 acres of harvest-ready farms and the
main aqueducts serving a million residents of Oakland
and other East Bay cities. Even if the 4'/2-foot diameter
pipelines do break, the East Bay has some six months of
water in reservoirs.
Warning planes for Saudi Arabia
Washington — The United States is rushing four spe
cial earlv warning radar planes to Saudi Arabia to help
strengthen the oil-rich country's air defenses against a
possible spread ot the war between Iraq and Iran, the
Pentagon announced yesterday.
In announcing the shipment of the highly sophisti
cated planes, U.S. officials said the deployment is tem
porary and stressed that the move does not mean the
U.S. is taking sides in the Iran-Iraq war.
"This deployment is purely for defensive purposes. It
is designed to track aircraft for the purpose of provid
ing additional warning for Saudi Arabian defenses,"
said Pentagon spokesman Thomas Ross.
Saudi Arabia has indicated its support for Iraq in the
fighting with Iran. However, U.S. defense officials said
they have no reason to believe the Saudis will be relay
ing to Iraq any military data provided by the American
radar planes, known as AYVACS.
Ross told a Pentagon press briefing the decision to
deploy the aircraft was made "in response to a request
from the government of Saudi Arabia."
Greece may be forced out of NATO
Washington — Greece will be forced to withdraw
from NATO "finally and irrevocably" and to take over
American military bases there if a new formula for
Creek membership in the alliance is not found "within
the next few weeks," Foreign Minister Constantine
Mitsotakis said in an interview. "But Greece must re
turn to the alliance or it must withdraw its application
for a return before the Creek elections next year."
Mitsotakis' remarks were the first explicit statement
that his center-right coalition, headed by President
Constantine Karamanlis, cannot afford politically to go

into elections with the NATO question unresolved and
American bases still on Greek soil. The elections must
be held by the autumn of 1981.
His comments also provided an extended public air
ing ot private warnings that the Greeks have been send
ing to the Carter administration since june. These warn
ings appear to have intensified in the wake of last
month's military coup in Turkey.
Mitsotakis said that he had conveyed the warning
again this week in a discussion here with Secretary of
State Edmund Muskie. Both men are attending the U.N.
General Assembly's fall session.
