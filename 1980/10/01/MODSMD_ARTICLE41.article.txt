# Pottery workshop plagued by vandals
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Vandals slowed construction of
the Stanford Pottery Workshop's
new kiln by stealing specially de
signed gas guages, valves and, most
recently, shelves from the structure.
The six-foot cube in back of Bran
ner Hall was struck twice last month
in the space of two weeks. Objects
worth more than $270 were taken,
according to the directors of the
workshop.
Carol Hall, workshop treasurer,
noticed on Sept. 19 that the tar
paulin covering the heat tempered
shelves was sagging.
"I lifted up the tarp and found that
16 of the 24 shelves were missing,"
she said yesterday. Hall described
the shelves as square, 18-inch
boards of an off-white color. Each
weighs about 20 pounds.
"They're nice enough looking for

someone to use for shelving a stereo
or books," said Wayne Horiuchi, di
rector of the workshop. Horiuchi
said the shelves possibly were taken
inadvertently by someone looking
for a way to beautify their room.
Horiuchi said it would cost more
than $200 to buy new shelves and
that he hopes they will be returned
before replacement becomes a
necessity.
Just two weeks before the shelves
were discovered missing, the kiln's
builders discovered that vandals had
chipped away bricks from the top of
the structure. At that time, Hall said,
gas guages worth $56 were found
missing. Also missing was a special
valve and two hacksaws. "I imagine
they're sitting on someone's man
telpiece somewhere," she said.
The Stanford Pottery Workshop, a
non-profit student organization

which has provided workspace for
ceramicists, sculptors and potters
for a decade on this campus, began
collecting funds for the new kiln ap
proximately nine months ago.
"Our original kiln was con
demned by the fire department,"
said Horiuchi. He said the workshop
then went hunting for funds to build
a new kiln. Although some money
was acquired through sales at cam
pus craft shows like the Spring Faire,
"the people who came through
were at Residential Education,"
Horiuchi said.
Using a $3500 grant from the Resi
dential Education Office, the work
shop arranged for construction of
the kiln but did not anticipate prob
lems with vandals. Horiuchi said the
old kiln had never been broken into.
Robert Mibach of the Residential
Education Managers Office said yes

terday that his office is putting out a
bid now for a fence around the kiln.
Mibach has worked closely with the
workshop staff to arrange for fire
and construction permits. He said
he could not give an exact cost esti
mate, but that the fence will proba
bly be expensive.
Horiuchi summarized the feelings
of the workshop staff in the word
"frustrated." He said it would be dif
ficult to get any replacements for the
shelves from the Thorley Company
which designs them.
The workshop currently offers
two beginning pottery classes and is
used by advanced potters. Horiuchi
said guest potters and artisans, in
cluding David Best, a sculptor, and
Sandra Johnson, a ceramicist from
Los Altos, were invited to the work
shop last year to demonstrate their
talents.

Horiuchi summarized the feelings
of the workshop staff in the word
"frustrated." He said it would be dif
ficult to get any replacements for the
shelves from the Thorley Company
which designs them.
The workshop currently offers
two beginning pottery classes and is
used by advanced potters. Horiuchi
said guest potters and artisans, in
cluding David Best, a sculptor, and
Sandra Johnson, a ceramicist from
Los Altos, were invited to the work
shop last year to demonstrate their
talents.
