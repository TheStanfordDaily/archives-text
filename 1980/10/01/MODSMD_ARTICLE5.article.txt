# Standoff in Congress may halt government

### 
Washington (LAT/WP) â€” Senate
and House negotiators seeking ag
reement on an emergency appropri
ation to prevent the federal gov
ernment from running out of money
today broke up in angry disagree
ment last night over proposed new
restrictions on abortions.
But with both the House and Se
nate standing by in hopes of acting
on the emergency bill before mid
night, the conferees agreed to make
another try later last night.

The emergency bill, a stopgap
measure, was needed to keep the
government from exhausting its
spending authority with the advent
of the 1981 fiscal year at 12:01 a.m.
today.
Without the bill, the government
would be out of money because
Congress has completed action on
only one of the 14 regular appropria
tion measures, and even that one
has not been signed by the presi
dent.
Because of a recent ruling by At
torney General Benjamin Civiletti
that federal officials could not incur
any expenses without congressional
authority, the White House has di
rected all agencies to prepare to

close down operations except "th
ose necessary to protect human life
and property."
There was some question, how
ever about how extensive a shut
down would be it, indeed, one oc
curs. For instance, the Office of Per
sonnel Management, the successor
of the old Civil Service Commission,
directed federal employees to re
port to work today.
Betore the deadlock developed
over the contentious abortion issue,
the Senate-House conferees had
reached agreement on all other dis
putes related to the emergency
stopgap money bill.
But the conference broke up in
angry shouting over abortions, an
issue that has caused a running teud
between the House and Senate for
years.
The Senate, in a compromise ef
fort Monday, agreed to allow the
states to set tougher restrictions
than the federal government's for
financing the Medicaid abortions for
poor women. But it insisted on re
taining provisions in current law that
permit funding of abortions where
the mother's life is in danger or in
cases of rape or incest.
But the House had voted earlier to
delete rape and incest from allowa
ble abortions, and House conferees
said that they were standing firm on
the House position.
"We've capitulated to you for the
last time," shouted Senate Minority
Whip Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). "I've
never seen such a callous disregard
for the rights of people."
Stevens threatened to block ac
tion on the emergency bill unless
the House side retreated, and the
Senate conferees voted 10 to 6 to
stand by the Senate position. House
conferees in turn voted 9 to 4 to
stand firm on theirs.
On another issue, the conferees
accepted the $1.8 billion fuel assis
tance bill voted by the House, in
stead of the $2 billion previously
voted by the Senate. The funds
