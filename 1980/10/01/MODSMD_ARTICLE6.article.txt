Washington (AP) — The Senate,
voting to soften a proposed restric
tion on federally funded abortions,
blocked final action early this morn
ing on an emergency-funding bill
needed to keep the government
running.
By voice vote, the Senate adopted
an amendment revising a House
proposal that would sharply restrict
the number of times that Medicaid
payments could be made for poor
women's abortions in cases of rape
and incest.
Because the House had adjourned
when the Senate made the change,
the bill was effectively delayed until
later today when the two bodies are
scheduled to return.
