In one incident yesterday, two
students playing racquetball at the
deGuerre Courts had their wallets
stolen. The wallets had been left in
backpacks outside the court before
they entered to play.
Patrick Bitter, the court attendant,
had noticed a man "hanging
around" the courts and when the
students reported the theft, he cal
led campus police.
As Bitter began to describe the
suspect to the operator, the suspect
returned to the main entrance, but
ran off when the attendant asked for
his identification.
Following a chase by one of the
students around DeGuerre pool and
through Palo Alto High School
grounds, the suspect was stopped
and later apprehended by the cam
pus police.
The students' wallets were found

Diamond, minus a small amount of
cash.
Incidents like these are not rare,
according to one police officer, and
students should also be careful
about keeping their rooms locked
and bikes secured.
Chris Greene of the Public Safety
Department said more than 30
crimes, including stolen bikes, resi
dence burglaries and automobile

they just can't go off and leave their
bikes unlocked or walk down the
hall with their rooms wide open
she said.

storage were also reported, includ
ing a television set from Toyon's
