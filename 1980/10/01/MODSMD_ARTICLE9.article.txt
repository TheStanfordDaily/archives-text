# S. Africa reverses fraud conviction
## 
### Washington Post 
lohannesburg â€” An appeals
court Monday overturned the
fraud conviction and six-year
jail sentence of Eschel
Rhoodie, whose management
of a multi-million dollar clan
destine propaganda effort for
South Africa eventually led to
this country's worst-ever polit
ical scandal.
Rhoodie, former director of
South Africa's information ser
vices, and mastermind of the
covert campaign to influence
Western decision-makers and
public opinion more favorably
to South Africa, was the only
person criminally charged as a
result of the scandal that
forced a prime minister, a
powerful minister and the
country's top intelligence chief
to resign.
Government investigators
found that close to $72 million
had been illegally diverted
over several years for the sec
ret campaign. But the govern
ment has failed to show any
obvious improvement in its re
lations with the rest of the
world as a result of the effort.
"Muldergate"
There was little immediate
reaction to Rhoodie's success
ful appeal from either the gov

ernment or the public, both ot
whom lost a great deal of in
terst in the scandal thatcameto
be known as "Muldergate"
after Cornelius Mulder, the
former minister of information
for whom Rhoodie worked.
Under the covert program
run bv Rhoodie with the know
ledge of Mulder, former prime
minister Jon Vorster and
former spy chief Hendrick Van
Den Bergh, all of whom res
igned from office, the state
secretly tunneled more than
$32 million into an English
language newspaper that
pushed the cause of the
Afrikaner-dominated govern
ment and its policy of racial
segregation.
The clandestine activities of
the government included
more than 100 projects, most
of which have remai ned secret.
Among those revealed was the
attempt to buy the then finan
cially ailing Washington Star
newspaper through Michigan
publisher John McGoff in 1974.
Other projects involved the
secret purchase by the South
African government of shares
in an overseas television news
company and publishing com
panies.
There were reports also of

bribery of Western and African
government officials and pay
ments to the campaign coffers
of former President Gerald
Ford and President Jimmy Car
ter. None of those reports,
however, has been verified.
Forced resignation
The most impoitant result of
the scandal was the resignation
of Vorster, which opened the
way for Pieter Botha to replace
him in September 1978. Politi
cal pressures on the new Botha
administration to call someone
to task for the most flagrant
misappropriations of state
money centered on Rhoodie.
Protesting his innocence of
any wrongdoing, Rhoodie fled
South Africa and settled in Fr
ance. After charging him with
fraud and theft, the govern
ment extradited him from Fr
ance in August 1979.
He was found guilty Oct. 8 of
misappropriating $76,000 of
the secret 524 million slush
fund he controlled and using it
for personal real estate deals
including the purchase of a
seaside apartment.
Judge Charl Theron did not
believe Rhoodie's defense
that the money put into his
own account was actually
reimbursements to himself for

payments he had made out of
his own pocket to "anonymous
collaborators" working in
"highly sensitive operations"
with and for the South African
government.
Secret projects
In its judgment Monday,
however, the appeals court
said that discrepancies in
Rhoodie's testimony were not
of crucial importance, and that
in light of the evidence his exp
lanations were at least possibly
true. The state had therefore
not proven him guilty of lar
ceny and fraud, the court
found.
The government says it still
runs more than 60 of the 100
secret projects that were being
conducted at the time of the
"Muldergate" scandal. There
is speculation some of them
involve secret arms purchases.
