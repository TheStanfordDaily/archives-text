The 1 IP 34C s Sol vi* and Integrate func
tions put an end to laborious computations
and the trial and error approach for deter
mining the roots of an equation or comput
ing definite integrals of a function. Now.
a single keystroke gives you the answer.
This means real time-savings for vou math,
engineering, and science majors who will
be performing these calculus operations
over and over again.
Solve and Integrate are but two examples
of the problem-solving power of the
lIP VIC advanced programmable. Dyna
mic memorv allocation automatically
converts the 21 data registers, as needed,
to provide up to 210 program lines. And
remembers these allocations so you don't
have to. Up to 3 keystroke instructions are
automatically merged into one program
line expanding memory to make the
I IP 34C comparable to calculators having
as many as program lines. And editing
is a snap. The I IP-34C"s editing keys let
vou review your programs and insert or
delete instructions as needed.
The I IP VIC also features Continuous
Memory that retains your data and pro
grams even after the calculator has been
turned off. Retrieve them as often as
needed, without the bother and lost time
of reentering.
