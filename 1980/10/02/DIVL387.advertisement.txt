GREAT
ONE!!!
Although these wmmmmu+mi
speaker systems are rather large for
the average room, their beautiful
walnut grain color blends well with
any decor.
These speaker systems are one of Marantz's
newest models. [So new that most stores don't
even have this new series in stock.] The fine
quality makes for great listening. The strong
durable vinyl veneer protective coating helps
protect against scratches and scuff marks. This
new model is an incredible speaker system.
SO POWERFUL THEY CAN BE USED WITH THE
MAJORITY OF RECEIVERS ON THE MARKET.
