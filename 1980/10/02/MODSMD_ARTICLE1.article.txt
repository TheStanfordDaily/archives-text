# Congress approves temporary funding bill

From Daily wire services
Washington — Congress yesterday
resolved its latest abortion dispute
and approved temporary financing
tor the federal government, al
though the bureaucracy had to mud
dle through a da\ without anv spend
ing authority.
Within minutes after convening,
the House, without debate or a re
corded vote, accepted a Senate
compromise on abortion lunding
and whisked the huge stop-gap
spending resolution off to President
jimmy Carter, who signed it later in
the day.
The resolution will mean the gov
ernment can continue to spend
money at current or slightly higher
rates through Dec. 15, when Con
gress presumably will have acted on
regular appropriations bills that are
currently in a pre-election deep
freeze. In the meantime. Congress
can go home and campaign
By failing to adopt the measure be
fore yesterdays start of the new fiscal
year, Congress technically left the
bureaucracy with its money spigots
turned off. But it was basically
business-as-usual downtown.
Financial wringers
Noting that Congress had put the
bureaucracy through similar tinan
cial wringers in the past, although
never such a big one, House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.) ob
served betore the House vote that
someone "always blinks and the
government proceeds."
Although almost every year some
federal agencies are threatened with
a shutdown over money difficulties,
such a predicament has never betore
confronted virtually the entire gov
ernment.
When the new fiscal year started
yesterday without a single regular
appropriations bill enacted, some
agencies went into neutral — carry
ing out only activities needed to pro
tect life and propertv — while others
operated normally.
Anti-abortion plank
The hangup on the emergency
spending bill came early yesterday
morning when the Senate balked at
stringent, new anti-abortion lan
guage that the House sought to in
sert into the legislation.
The House wanted to permit
Medicaid-tunded abortions for poor
women in cases of rape and incest
only if the incident were reported
within 48 hours of occurrence.
While comments from agency offi
cials indicated some work interrup
tions and long coffee breaks, the
government's day in limbo seemed
to have no serious effect on impor
tant operations. Managers from sev
eral departments did, however,
spend the day planning to call travel
ing bureaucrats back home and
compiling lists ot people who would
have to be furloughed.
