# World Traveler Takes a Look:
## Tibet moves into the 20th century 
### Bee Canterbury Lavery The Los Angeles Times 
Tibet, nominally a part of China tor
the past 30 years — but actually an au
tonomous region, like four others in
China — is slowly but deliberately mov
ing into the 20th Century from a feudal
system that as recently as 1959 included
slavery and serfdom.
This progress was apparent to me as
part of the first American tour delega
tion to visit that high, mystical, exotic
land known as the "root of the world"
at the invitation of the Chinese gov
ernment, through the sponsorship of
the U.S. China People's Friendship As
sociation.
We found Tibet beginning to
prosper. Religion was practiced open
ly. Tibet's two palaces and the monas
teries were in good condition. In Lhasa,
the capital, we visited the Potala Palace,
former home of the Dalai Lama, his
summer palace, the Norbu Linka; and
the three major monasteries. The
Potala and the monasteries are at
tended by monks who neither aban
doned the monasteries nor accom
panied the Dalai Lama to India in 1959.
Restoration of the murals, paintings
and tapestries is being accomplished by
Tibetan artisans under the sponsorship
of China's central government.
Under Lamanism, 25 percent of the
male population entered the monas
teries, usually as children. Our guide,
Mei Jiangzhorng, a Han Chinese (the
main ethnic group of China), told us
that the government is once again con
sidering encouraging some young men

to enter the monasteries — not to per
petuate Buddhism but to become
caretakers of the beautiful buildings
and the priceless art.
We saw hundreds of worshipers in
the holiest of all Tibetan monasteries,
the )okang, which houses the original
)o, or Buddha, brought to Tibet in A.D.
641 by Princess Wen Cheng when she
married Tibetan King Srontsan Campo.
Our guide reminded us that, al
though the government of China is
atheist, the people have the right to
practice religion as well as the right to
not piactice religion.
There are signs that the Dalai Lama
may soon return. Only weeks before
our delegation arrived, his brother,
Tubten Norbu, a professor at the Uni
versity of Indiana, visited Tibet to view
conditions at first hand. The Chinese
government has made it clear that the
Dalai Lama is welcome to return, but
only under certain, as yet unspecified,
conditions. When the Dalai Lama was in
Los Angeles last year he said that he
would do whatever his people wished.
Tibet never was the idyllic Shangri-La
of lames Hilton's "Lost Horizon" fable.
Slavery and serfdom were part of the
feudal system under which most of the
Tibetan population lived. They were
ruled by the Dalai Lama, the Panchen
Lama (who now lives in Peking) and
some 200 Tibetan noble families. These
favored few, who comprised five per
cent of the population, owned all the
cultivated land and pastures in Tibet,
and almost all the livestock.
The People's Liberation Army

marched into Tibet in 1951 after the
signing of the 17-article Peaceful Libera
tion Agreement. Although the ruling
class gave lip service to reforms, every
action that the central government un
dertook had to be accomplished
through the local feudal authorities,
who frustrated much reform. When the
serfs rebelled in 1959, the Dalai Lama
left for India.
There is no doubt that the Tibetan
people are better off since 1959. Slavery
and serfdom have ended, new agricul
tural methods are being taught, new
crops flourish and the education of
children is assured through primary
school. Health measures have im
proved greatly, with modern Chinese
medicine now being practiced
alongside traditional Tibetan medicine.
Now Tibet is being opened for
tourism, to bring in foreign currency to
help economic growth. Already some
travel agencies are advertising tours to
Tibet. There are no hotels or restaur
ants, though; delegations stay in gov
ernment guest houses. It is anyone's
guess what will happen to the Tibetan
people when more tourists come to
photograph, explore and barter for
their handcrafted jewelry, knives and
woolen products.
With the opening of this remote reg
ion, the possible return of the Dalai
Lama and the modern economic re
forms sweeping all China, the Western
world will have an opportunity for the
first time in 30 years to witness how
China deals with an autonomous reg
ion.
