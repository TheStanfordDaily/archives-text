# Life in a loft — a step above
## 
### Alex Locke 
Ever wonder if that loft you're thinking of
buying is legal?...or safe? Ever wonder how to
build a better one? Ever wonder why some
one would risk rolling over in their sleep and
falling six feet to a rude awakening on the
floor? It's all for the love of lofts.
Lofts provide "the maximum use of space
in cramped University housing," as one stu
dent put it. Usually a sort of "bed-on-stilts,"
they provide extra floor space to do yoga, or
for that furnniture treasure you bought last
year at Quality Mart.
Lofts provide extra storage space above a
closet or doorway, but they can also be
finely-crafted pieces of furniture, adding a
touch of class to your modest accomoda
tions. "Lofts are fun...they're great,"say stu
dents who own them.
Lofts haven't always been this popular. In
the early '70's, student lofts were virtually
unheard of. Then, around 1975, a few were
built in Toyon. Their numbers kept doubling
every year. Now, an estimated 75 to 80 per
cent of Toyon residents own lofts.
Inflation has also hit the loft market. In one
extreme case a student who sold his modest
loft four years ago for a reasonable $75 was
offered the same loft this year for $180. The
going price for the average Toyon loft is
around $170, a figure slightly inflated by
higher wood costs.
What kind of person would own a loft? Just
about anyone, according to Allison Stone, RA
(House associate) in Toyon.
Toyon is not the only dorm with lofts. Al
most any dorm with high ceilings qualifies,
and if you're short or don't mind stooping,
the range of alternatives is even greater.
There are many lofts in Cowell houses, as
well as fraternities and row houses, several in
Wilbur and Stern and even one in Crothers
Memorial.
Lofts come in all shapes and sizes: single
lofts for one bed, double lofts for two, "L
-shaped" lofts with a mezzanine for studying
and reading, split level lofts, and lofts with
built-in bars, staircases and even waterbeds.
If you don't want to spend the money to
buy a ready-made loft, it's not that difficult to
build one yourself. Lumber and tools are av
ailable from local merchants, and tools like
power saws and drills can be rented.
Before you plunge headlong into the world
of loft ownership, you should know the Uni
versity safety regulations concerning lofts, or
you may end up doing a nose-dive.
According to Robert Mibach, residence
hall facilities manager, student lofts should
be:
— free-standing
— easily dismantled
— supported by at least 4x4 uprights
— built of lumber that conforms to uniform
types and code (Douglas Fir of grade one or
better)
— braced to prevent sway
— topped with at least V« inch plywood.
Hal Wilson, universiy health officer adds,
"The law requires 'adequate ventilation' for
rooms based on occupancy and room size.

When the liveable area in a room increases,
or when lofts block off access to windows,
they become a health hazard."
Peter Irish, deputy county fire marshal says
lofts are a "gray area" as far as his office is
concerned.
He has no jurisdiction in private rooms,
provided that lofts do not obstruct the sprink
ler pattern. "Lofts built up into the attic are
clearly illegal," he says, "because they break
the separation between two stories, under
mining code regulations for fire-retardant
attic walls." For his purposes, lofts are "really
only elaborate furniture."
Authorities all agreed that any sort of elec
trical alteration is out. Students should not
try to wire in ceiling light switches or tamper
with electrical boxes. One instance 5 years
ago where students had wired an attic room
resulted in a fire. Even an electrical contrac
tor cannot alter dorm wiring without Univer
sity approval.
Also, students should not bolt their lofts
into the wall. Doing so makes the loft a per
manent structure requiring a building per
mit and compliance with the Uniform Build
ing Code's requirement that ceiling height in
Santa Clara County be a minimum of 7Vi feet.
According to Mibach, the resident man
ager's office (RMO) policy is that "If a loft is to
be constructed within the residence halls, a
plan or drawing must be submitted for review
to RMO so it can be reviewed as to its struc
tural integrity."
"Students are more than welcome to come
by the Resident Manager's Office in Crothers
Memorial Hall room 308 for building assis
tance." he said.
"So how do I build a loft?" The basic ingre
dients of a one-story, single bed loft are:
— a 4xB sheet of plywood '/a inch thick or
thicker (fibre board is heavy and cumber
some)
— 4x4 posts cut to the desired height
— 2x4 or 2x6 boards to support the
plywood, Ix 4 or 2x4 boards to use as cross
bracing to prevent sway
— joist hangers
— nails (or wood screws) and lag bolts
— carpet to finish off the platform
The first thing to build is the frame to sup
port the platform.
There are two basic frames to choose from:
(A) a frame of 2x4's with outside dimensions
of 4xB ft or (B) a 2x6 or 2xB outer frame with
inside dimensions 4xB ft.
The advantage to B is that the plywood may
be set inside the outer frame, leaving a rim
around the platform which not only keeps
the mattress from sliding off but precludes
the use of nails to anchor the plywood to the
frame. This saves set-up and tear-down time.
For both frames (A and B), cut the corners
so the shorter 2x4's fit inside the long ones.
The nicest and easiest way to secure the out
side corners, though slightly more expensive
is to use lag bolts (not bolts from Lagunita
Court-ask at a hardware store for a descrip
tion).
