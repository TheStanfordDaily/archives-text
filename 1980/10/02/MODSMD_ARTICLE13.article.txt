## Minority vote is needed 
### 
The evident concern in both the Republican
and Democratic presidential campaigns over
the outcome of this year's black and Hispanic
vote is a telling reminder that Jimmy Carter's
1976 victory was incontestably a "minority" vic
tory. The president's huge margin among Third
World voters was the one clear factor that sent
him to the White House.
This year it is equally incontestable that a
wholesale minority turn-off on election day
could send the president packing back to Geor
gia. So could a significant minority shift to the
Republican column, a possibility that cannot be
ruled out, given the demonstrated appeal of
Ronald Reagan's positions on such issues as
family and economic revitalization among black
and Hispanic voters.
But the growing clout of minority voters ap
pears to have changed focus this year. More
than ever before, say leaders in the minority
communities, voters from those communities
will be drawn to the poll booth on election day
not by the presidential candidates, but by their
own self-interest in local issues and local minor
ity candidates.
"There are enough blacks on the ballot to pull
our community into the voting booths," said the
popular San Francisco state legislator, Willie
Brown. "They'll vote for us. And then they'll
reach up and cast a vote at the top of the ticket.
That's how the minority vote is going to go this
year."
If Brown is right, then the dilemma tor Carter
and Reagan is not how to get minority voters to
turn out on election day, but how to position
themselves on the coattails of black and His
panic city counselors, state legislators and
school board candidates. It is an historic topsy
turvy in traditional voting patterns.
Though it is too early to project voter turnout,
there are already some signs that the minorities
will not sit out this election, as some experts
have predicted. In heavily Hispanic Los Angeles,
registrar Leonard Panish notes that a "normal"
100,000 new registrations have occurred since
)une, "not a big growth, but not a decline,
either."
Since any growth normally tends to favor the
Democratic Party, this fact alone could be cru
cially important to Jimmy Carter, who lost
California, for instance, by a mere one percent
in 1976.
In fact, 10 states with a total of 139 electoral
votes were in Republican columns in 1976 by
margins of less than two percent of the state
vote. Another seven states, including such key
blocs as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, were in
the Democraticcolumn by equally slim margins.
Since the New York Liberal Party's endorse
ment of John Anderson threatens to put that key
state into Republican columns this year, Presi
dent Carter is concentrating on the South, the
Southwest and the West to find support —

especially California's 45 electoral votes. The
Democratic vote huntersare keenly aware of the
17 million legally eligible blacks and 11 million
Hispanics. And so, of course, are the Republi
cans.
Consequently, both parties are expending
tremendous effort toward getting their man
aboard the increasingly independent minority
bandwagons.
In California, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has
promised a visit on behalt of the president, and
Gov. Jerry Brown, who is still "numero uno"
among his state's Hispanic voters, has commit
ted his own political aides to work directly in the
vote rallying effort. Gov. Brown has appointed
417 Hispanics to state posts, and Wally
McQuire, a recent Brown aide, is mustering
Brown supporters among the minorities to set
up a strong volunteer corps for election day.
These operatives are certainly aware of the
traditionally lower voter turnout among His
panics (some 68 percent did not vote in 1976,
according to the Census Bureau). But they are
also aware that Hispanics are emerging this year
into cohesive political forces, organized along
partisan lines.
The Hispanic Republican Assembly, though it
organized back in the Nixon era, is suddenly
getting strong support from the Republican Na
tional Committee in a major drive to expand. It
includes virtually e\ ery Hispanic who held office
prior to the Carter era, and is out to double its
present 4,000 members this year.
Led by Los Angeles businessman Fernando
Oaxaca, who served in the Ford Administration,
its vitality can be judged by the tact that three
out of the seven new Hispanic candidates for the
California legislature are Republicans.
The Democratic counterforce is called His
panic American Democrats (HAD), which now
has chapters in 22 states. Its clout is de
monstrated by the number of Hispanics chosen
as delegates to the Democratic Convention this
year. Fouryears ago they numbered 0n1y46; this
year there were 310.
Said HAD leader David Lizarraga, a Los
Angeles community developer, "We realized
political power would not be given to us, so we
set out to penetrate the Democratic Party sys
tem. We are organizing, block by block, in city
districts, legislative districts and congressional
districts, to make ourselves felt. We will get His
panics to the polls this year."
California remains an uphill battle for the
president, and it is states like California and
Texas, with their growing Hispanic voices, that
will probably call this election. That fact, if
clearly demonstrated on Nov. 4, should serve an
important lesson to the next president of the
United States.

will probably call this election. That fact, if
clearly demonstrated on Nov. 4, should serve an
important lesson to the next president of the
United States.

The evident concern in both the Republican
and Democratic presidential campaigns over
the outcome of this year's black and Hispanic
vote is a telling reminder that Jimmy Carter's
1976 victory was incontestably a "minority" vic
tory. The president's huge margin among Third
World voters was the one clear factor that sent
him to the White House.
This year it is equally incontestable that a
wholesale minority turn-off on election day
could send the president packing back to Geor
gia. So could a significant minority shift to the
Republican column, a possibility that cannot be
ruled out, given the demonstrated appeal of
Ronald Reagan's positions on such issues as
family and economic revitalization among black
and Hispanic voters.
But the growing clout of minority voters ap
pears to have changed focus this year. More
than ever before, say leaders in the minority
communities, voters from those communities
will be drawn to the poll booth on election day
not by the presidential candidates, but by their
own self-interest in local issues and local minor
ity candidates.
"There are enough blacks on the ballot to pull
our community into the voting booths," said the
popular San Francisco state legislator, Willie
Brown. "They'll vote for us. And then they'll
reach up and cast a vote at the top of the ticket.
That's how the minority vote is going to go this
year."
If Brown is right, then the dilemma tor Carter
and Reagan is not how to get minority voters to
turn out on election day, but how to position
themselves on the coattails of black and His
panic city counselors, state legislators and
school board candidates. It is an historic topsy
turvy in traditional voting patterns.
Though it is too early to project voter turnout,
there are already some signs that the minorities
will not sit out this election, as some experts
have predicted. In heavily Hispanic Los Angeles,
registrar Leonard Panish notes that a "normal"
100,000 new registrations have occurred since
)une, "not a big growth, but not a decline,
either."
Since any growth normally tends to favor the
Democratic Party, this fact alone could be cru
cially important to Jimmy Carter, who lost
California, for instance, by a mere one percent
in 1976.
In fact, 10 states with a total of 139 electoral
votes were in Republican columns in 1976 by
margins of less than two percent of the state
vote. Another seven states, including such key
blocs as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas, were in
the Democraticcolumn by equally slim margins.
Since the New York Liberal Party's endorse
ment of John Anderson threatens to put that key
state into Republican columns this year, Presi
dent Carter is concentrating on the South, the
Southwest and the West to find support —

especially California's 45 electoral votes. The
Democratic vote huntersare keenly aware of the
17 million legally eligible blacks and 11 million
Hispanics. And so, of course, are the Republi
cans.
Consequently, both parties are expending
tremendous effort toward getting their man
aboard the increasingly independent minority
bandwagons.
In California, Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has
promised a visit on behalt of the president, and
Gov. Jerry Brown, who is still "numero uno"
among his state's Hispanic voters, has commit
ted his own political aides to work directly in the
vote rallying effort. Gov. Brown has appointed
417 Hispanics to state posts, and Wally
McQuire, a recent Brown aide, is mustering
Brown supporters among the minorities to set
up a strong volunteer corps for election day.
These operatives are certainly aware of the
traditionally lower voter turnout among His
panics (some 68 percent did not vote in 1976,
according to the Census Bureau). But they are
also aware that Hispanics are emerging this year
into cohesive political forces, organized along
partisan lines.
The Hispanic Republican Assembly, though it
organized back in the Nixon era, is suddenly
getting strong support from the Republican Na
tional Committee in a major drive to expand. It
includes virtually e\ ery Hispanic who held office
prior to the Carter era, and is out to double its
present 4,000 members this year.
Led by Los Angeles businessman Fernando
Oaxaca, who served in the Ford Administration,
its vitality can be judged by the tact that three
out of the seven new Hispanic candidates for the
California legislature are Republicans.
The Democratic counterforce is called His
panic American Democrats (HAD), which now
has chapters in 22 states. Its clout is de
monstrated by the number of Hispanics chosen
as delegates to the Democratic Convention this
year. Fouryears ago they numbered 0n1y46; this
year there were 310.
Said HAD leader David Lizarraga, a Los
Angeles community developer, "We realized
political power would not be given to us, so we
set out to penetrate the Democratic Party sys
tem. We are organizing, block by block, in city
districts, legislative districts and congressional
districts, to make ourselves felt. We will get His
panics to the polls this year."
California remains an uphill battle for the
president, and it is states like California and
Texas, with their growing Hispanic voices, that
will probably call this election. That fact, if
clearly demonstrated on Nov. 4, should serve an
important lesson to the next president of the
United States.
