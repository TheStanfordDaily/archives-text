Keohane surprising
Those of us who took an ac
tive interest in the reinstate
ment ot Western Civilization as
a requirement — encouraged
by the fact that almost 90 per
cent of alumni regarded it as
the best course they had had at
Stanford — expected that it
would be presented to the new
students with a certain en
thusiasm. Hence it was rather
startling to read the Ddily ac
count (Sept. 29) of Assoc. Politi
cal Science Prof. Nannerl
Keohane's "welcoming" ad
dress to the freshmen.
It is wrong to be so apologe
tic and condescending about
including Aristotle, Dante,
Goethe, Keats, Freud in a
course. Naturally, they had

their human flaws, their blind
spots about women, their
many prejudices, partly ger
mane to their era (one dares to
predict that Professor Keohane
and her listeners will one day
be seen to be less than perfect
in their assumptions and
biases). But it is misguided to
emphasize these flaws in a first
presentation, given the
enormous creative power of
those tigures, the amount of
sheer gold amid the dross.
It is particularly questionable
to do this with young people
who are already inclined to be
anti-intellectual in our time,
anti-traditional, and the like.
This smacks of pandering to
popular taste, a sort of
academic demagoguery one
has seen all too much of.

Moreover, one suspects that
even the students, certainly
the more alert ones, no longer
welcome that kind of flattery of
values which have proven to be
shoddy in the long run.
To put so much emphasis on
her own jteminist perspective
in approaching these complex
and fully human figures is just
as trivializing as any other ten
dentious "approach." It is de
meaning.
Not that we should be blind
worshippers, uncritical of the
great, but it is a question of
proportion, timing, taste,
tone. Orarethosethingsoutof
fashion now at Stanford?
