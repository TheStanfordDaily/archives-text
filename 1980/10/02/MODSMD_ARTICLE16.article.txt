## OPINIONS David Sartoris What is wrong with the U.S.? 
### 
The 300 th day of captivity for
the American hostages in Iran
has come and gone, despite
persistent diplomatic attempts
to end the senseless stalemate.
While the world engaged in
perhaps the only constructive
form of international competi
tion — the Olympic Games —
America stayed home like a
pouting child, hurting none
but its own citizen-athletes.
The American economic situa
tion continues its downward
spiral, while innocent people
are incessantly victimized by
criminal acts in American
cities.
Despite dwindling faith in
government over the past two
decades, the American elec
toral system now threatens to
bring a former Hollywood
actor to the White House.
An obvious rhetorical ques
tion is raised by these facts:
what is wrong with America?
Somewhere over the past 200
years, we as a nation appear to
have lost the spirit, pride,
brotherhood, and unity which
led our ancestors to succeed in
its formation and growth.
Over-emphasis on the impor
tance of capitalistic gain and
material wealth has caused
many citizens to lose sight of
the truly important aspects of
life in a democratic society.
The American public has an
undeniable tendency to blame
our currently dismal state of af
fairs on political leaders, big
business enterprises, or
ganized crime, or other some
what nebulous, poorly
understood entities. The tide
will begin to turn only whenwe
realize and act upon the fact
thatin some capacity, weareall
at fault.
Comparison with life in the
world at large quickly reveals
that the American people are
the most spoiled society on
earth. For the most part, our

basic needs of food and shelter
are met. We waste tons of
food, clean water, and natural
resources daily, and consume
precious energy for the opera
tion of such needless articles as
electric knives, automatic gar
age door openers, and es
calators. We enjoy purchasing
food and other articles in
pretty packages, contributing
to trash mountains, and prefer
to discard and repurchase
items rather than repair them.
Indeed, therearecommunities
of people across the globe
whose standard of living would
be raised immensely if only
they had our garbage.
However, our crime as a na
tion is not the fact that we have
such a lifestyle, but rather our
apparent failure to respect how
fortunate we are. The fruits of
the present symbolize the de
dication and hard work of pre
vious generations of Ameri
cans — those who fought and
died at war, starved through
the Great Depression, or spent
their lives doing constructive
work for the good of society as
a whole.
Today, however, there ap
pears to be an increasing
number of Americans who live
for weekends. They approach
Mondays as a funeral, Tues
days as a chore, Wednesdays
as an unwelcome necessity,
Thursdays with a faint glimmer
of hope, and Fridays with scant
suggestion of awakening from
their dull stupor of the previ
ous four days. Relatively few
individuals claim to enjoy their
work; sincere smiles are sel
dom seen in the modern
American workplace, and a
paucity of employees expend
the personal effort to make
their jobs seem more enjoy
able.
There was a time when
people generally took pride in
their work and found extreme
self-satisfaction in a job well
done. Industrialization has led
to depersonalization of the
working experience, and
employees have increasingly
come to question the signifi
cance and importance of what
they are paid to do.
Tragically, to many Ameri
cans, a job now means nothing
more than an income, rather
than an experience to be en
joyed as any other in life. The
disillusionment bred by this
fact contributes greatly to cur
rent paucity of positive spirit
and attitude in this country.
A second important factor
relates to what might approp
riately be termed "maldistribu
tion of progress." American
technology in science,
medicine, engineering, and
other fields continues to ad
vance at a rapid rate, yet has
positive impact on an increas
ingly smaller percentage of our
total population. We appear to
be improving the quality of life
for a small minority, and leav
ing everybody else further and
further behind.

One familiar example: for
every heart transplant per
formed at Stanford Hospital,
ten innocent infants die of
malnutrition or other causes of
neglect in East Oakland. Unfor
tunately, this strategy is like
building a skyscraper on a
weak foundation — the higher
it goes, the more susceptible it
is to a catastrophic fall.
Unless we have the foresight
to bring about a change in this
trend, our chances of future
existence as a nation seem min
imal. People would not per
form such acts of theft, mur
der, or suicide if they were
contented with their own lives.
Such crimes are ominous signs
to the satisfied minority, and it
is time to start looking down
before looking ahead.
Our current conception of
democracy needs to be
changed. It is no longer
enough to do as one pleases,
provided no other citizen is
harmed in the process. Part of
our responsibility as Ameri
cans should be to bring posi
tive feelings into the lives and
occupations of others, through
friendliness, conversation, en
couragement, and good will.

As long as one is doing these
things with sincerity, no indi
vidual should feel insignificant
or negative about his place in
society, for it represents ser
vice to the country.
As children, we all learned
such patriotic pieces as the
Pledge of Allegiance and the
Star-Spangled Bannerand their
meanings seemed so wonder
ful. As adults, however, we are
guilty of failure to put them
into practice. Instead of comp
laining about what we do not
have or cannot afford, we need
to be proud of what we do
have, and improve upon it as a
team.
Remembering that one's
own personal gain is someone
else's loss, and keeping "The
Golden Rule" at the forefront
of our consciousness will as
suredly lead to a reversal of our
present national slump. This
basic solution depends not on
economists, political leaders,
religious activists, or others to
whom we often turn for
answers — it depends only on
you.
