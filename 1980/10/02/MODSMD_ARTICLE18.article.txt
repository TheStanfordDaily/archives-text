# Band tours East Coast
## 
### 
While most Stanford students were prepar
ing to arrive at the Farm, a dedicated group of
musicians were readying themselves tor a
road trip across the continent. To he specific,
the incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band treated itself to a
six-day tour of the East Coast, with the focus
of activities- in Boston, Massachusetts.
The members only knew that they were
going to perform at the Boston College/
Stanford football game. As usual, only the
band manager and the members of SMUT
(Stanford Marching Unit Thinkers) knew the
full plans of the trip, which included perfor
mances in towns along the way and activities
around the East.
By Sept. 10, most of the band members had
departed by bus and a mobile home for an
action-packed five-day drive that included
concerts in Omaha, Nebraska and Chicago,
lllinios (also stopping regularly to replenish
their "liquid" supply.) In Omaha, local
alumni treated the band to a steak dinner,
and in Chicago, the band performed at a high
school soccer game.
Upon arrival in Boston, the band took up
quarters in the Boston College ice hockey
rink, which had a few advantages over the
usual hotel or motel accomodations. Band
member Dave Rosenthal said, "Being in a
motel with tour to a room kind of isolates the
band members. This way we could stay to
gether and have fun."
Once settled, some of the members re
freshed themselves by playing in a local
tavern in exchange for beer and other liba
tions.
Soon the band journeyed to New Haven,
Connecticut, where they challenged their
counterparts at Yale for a "Battle of the
Bands." Meeting at night on a dimly-lit field
amid a throng of spectators, the two bands of
warriors had it out. Most of the Yalies re
treated in awe and others were content
merely to listen.

Yale's problem, said LSJUMB manager
Bruce Heiman, was a lack of noise and a weak
musical selection.
"We just blew them away," he said.
Noting that the performance occurred at a
time when many students might be trying to
sleep, one member said, "Heck, we were on
vacation!"
With that the victors returned to Boston for
another attack, this one against the Harvard
Band. Stanford members conceded that their
opponents had a better flank attack, a larger
selection of music and in general performed
better the Yale group, but were still not a
match for the bolder, louder and better or
ganized Stanford invaders.
After these "warmup exercises," the
"Other Half" (it the football squad arranged
for the necessary refreshments, took a deep
collective breath and entered the Boston Col
lege stadium to give their usual dazzling,
rockin' and rollin' display of fine music, to
the enjoyment of such illustrious personages
as University President Donald Kennedy.
Their repertoire was a takeoff on the an
ticipated theme of the Boston band's show
which honored the 350 th year of Boston's
existence. The LSJUMB instead celebrated
"350 Years of American violence, " with
songs as "Tell Mama," "She's Not There," "It
Don't Come Easy" (dedicated to Mas
sachusetts' strict gun laws) and a medley of
"Uptight" and "Satisfaction."
The next day the LSJUMB marched in Bos
ton's Jubilee 350 parade; the band was fol
lowed by a car topped by a hot tub bearing
two band members waving Perrier bottles.
Some members occasionally ran off into the
crowd, taking along a line of marchers and
causing the mass confusion prevalent at
LSJUMB functions. During the hot humid
parade, some members also scrounged
among the spectators for beer, shook hands
and kissed c heeks for the pure sake of being
the wild n' wooly group they portend to be.

"We just blew them away," he said.
Noting that the performance occurred at a
time when many students might be trying to
sleep, one member said, "Heck, we were on
vacation!"
With that the victors returned to Boston for
another attack, this one against the Harvard
Band. Stanford members conceded that their
opponents had a better flank attack, a larger
selection of music and in general performed
better the Yale group, but were still not a
match for the bolder, louder and better or
ganized Stanford invaders.
After these "warmup exercises," the
"Other Half" (it the football squad arranged
for the necessary refreshments, took a deep
collective breath and entered the Boston Col
lege stadium to give their usual dazzling,
rockin' and rollin' display of fine music, to
the enjoyment of such illustrious personages
as University President Donald Kennedy.
Their repertoire was a takeoff on the an
ticipated theme of the Boston band's show
which honored the 350 th year of Boston's
existence. The LSJUMB instead celebrated
"350 Years of American violence, " with
songs as "Tell Mama," "She's Not There," "It
Don't Come Easy" (dedicated to Mas
sachusetts' strict gun laws) and a medley of
"Uptight" and "Satisfaction."
The next day the LSJUMB marched in Bos
ton's Jubilee 350 parade; the band was fol
lowed by a car topped by a hot tub bearing
two band members waving Perrier bottles.
Some members occasionally ran off into the
crowd, taking along a line of marchers and
causing the mass confusion prevalent at
LSJUMB functions. During the hot humid
parade, some members also scrounged
among the spectators for beer, shook hands
and kissed c heeks for the pure sake of being
the wild n' wooly group they portend to be.
While most Stanford students were prepar
ing to arrive at the Farm, a dedicated group of
musicians were readying themselves tor a
road trip across the continent. To he specific,
the incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band treated itself to a
six-day tour of the East Coast, with the focus
of activities- in Boston, Massachusetts.
The members only knew that they were
going to perform at the Boston College/
Stanford football game. As usual, only the
band manager and the members of SMUT
(Stanford Marching Unit Thinkers) knew the
full plans of the trip, which included perfor
mances in towns along the way and activities
around the East.
By Sept. 10, most of the band members had
departed by bus and a mobile home for an
action-packed five-day drive that included
concerts in Omaha, Nebraska and Chicago,
lllinios (also stopping regularly to replenish
their "liquid" supply.) In Omaha, local
alumni treated the band to a steak dinner,
and in Chicago, the band performed at a high
school soccer game.
Upon arrival in Boston, the band took up
quarters in the Boston College ice hockey
rink, which had a few advantages over the
usual hotel or motel accomodations. Band
member Dave Rosenthal said, "Being in a
motel with tour to a room kind of isolates the
band members. This way we could stay to
gether and have fun."
Once settled, some of the members re
freshed themselves by playing in a local
tavern in exchange for beer and other liba
tions.
Soon the band journeyed to New Haven,
Connecticut, where they challenged their
counterparts at Yale for a "Battle of the
Bands." Meeting at night on a dimly-lit field
amid a throng of spectators, the two bands of
warriors had it out. Most of the Yalies re
treated in awe and others were content
merely to listen.

Yale's problem, said LSJUMB manager
Bruce Heiman, was a lack of noise and a weak
musical selection.
"We just blew them away," he said.
