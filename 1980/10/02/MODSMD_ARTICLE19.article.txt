# Reagan to scrap SALT II, renegotiate
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Ronald Reagan says
that as president he would scrap the
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II)
without allowing a Senate vote on it, then
toughen the U.S. negotiating stance and
seek new weapons talks with the Soviet
Union.
He said he would strengthen American
military forces to put more pressure on
Moscow by raising "the possibility of an
arms race."
The SAIT II treaty negotiated and signed
by President Jimmy Carter is "fatally
flawed" and"it isn't arms limitation,"
Reagan said. The purpose of an arms ac
cord with the Soviets, Reagan said, is to
insure that "neither one of us can threaten
the other." He insisted Carter's treaty
doesn't meet the test.
Reagan said he would withdraw the tre
aty that has been awaiting Senate approval
for more than 14 months. SALT II already is
on the back burner. It faced an uncertain
vote in the Senate before Carter asked that
it be withheld due to the Soviet interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Arms buildup
In an interview Tuesday with the As
sociated Press, Reagan said a new U.S.
arms buildup would put pressure on the
Russians to strikean acceptable bargain on
Salt 11.
"The one card that's been missing in
these negotiations has been the possibility
of an arms race," Reagan said. "Now, the
Soviets have been racing, but with no
competition. ... He (the Soviets) will be
far more inclined to negotiate in good faith
if he knows that the United States is en
gaged in building up its military."
Reagan dealt.cautiously, likea leaderde
termined to avoid any misstep, with most
other issues raised in the interview. On
the war between Iran and Iraq, for exam
ple, he deferred detailed comment until
he's had an administration briefing on the
situation and has "access to more facts
than I have now."
In any event, he said, it is irrelevant to
discuss use .of U.S. forces to keep the Per

sian Gulf open because "we really don't
have the facility to do very much."
Accuses Carter
Reagan again accused Carter of due king
a (ampaign debate — noting he'd debated
six times this year and Carter not once —
and lie said he suspects the American hos
tages in Iran may be treed betore the Nov.
4 election in an "October surprise" de
signed to blunt his campaign.
Reagan also said that he'll consider issu
ing an executive order to abolish dratt re
gistration, and will "look very closely" at
legislation to eliminate the Departments
of Energy and Fducation.
While he sharply criticized Carter's so
called windfall profits tax on domestically
produced oil, Reagan said a repeal would
not be a high priority with him.
"I don't know that I could do the other
things I've said and immediately eliminate
that, but it is one that I think you could
look to as you progressed, to phasing
out," Reagan said.
The tax is expected to produce $227 bill
ion over the next decade. Reagan said "it
isn't a windfall profits tax, it's a sales tax,"
one that will discourage U.S. oil produc
tion and cost millions ot barrels a day. But
he conceded it would take a while to undo
it because the revenues are "so gigantic,
and already committed in programs."
Blasts treaty
Reagan made his sharpest comments in
blasting Carter's SALT II treaty. He said tlatly
and tirmly that he would withdraw the tre
aty from the Senate, where it is stalled at
Carter's request. It would takea two-thirds
Senate vote to approve the pact.
Carter asked Senate leaders on Jan. 3 to
delay ratification because ot the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan. Six months earlier,
hours after signing the treaty in Vienna,
Austria, he had urged ratification as a mat
ter of common sense for the United States.
In asking for the delay, Carter said he
was not withdrawing the treaty from Se

nate consideration. Asked it he would do
so, Reagan said, "Yes. But at the same time
I did I would make it plain that I was pre
pared to sit down with the Russians tor as
long as it might take to negotiate a legiti
mate arms limitation agreement.
"My objection to SALT II is it is not arms
limitation; it legitimizes arms rate; it he
gins by letting the Soviet Union build KXX)
more warheads, then we can build some
to catch up, only we can't catch up until
1990."
All-out arms race
Carter has accused Reagan ot "abandon
ing arms control policies which have been
supported by every Democratic president
since Harry Truman and every Republican
president since Dwight Eisenhower." He
said new Republican leaders seek "to
launch an all-out nuclear arms race."
Reagan said his SALT negotiations would
have a different tone than that employed
by Carter or his Republican predecessors.
"We have been unilaterally disarming at
the same time we're negotiating . . . with
the other fellow, where all he has to do is
sit there and not give up anything and his
superiority increases," Reagan said. "He
will be tar "more inclined to negotiate in
good faith if he knows that the United
States is engaged in building up its milit
ary," he added.
Reagan said his negotiating stance
would end Soviet confusion about U.S.
goals and determination. "I think some
times they'd feel better ... if they knew
what the game is and who the players are,"
Reagan said.
The former California governor acc used
Carter of trying to divert attention from
administration failures by asserting that a
new GOP administration might lead the
nation toward war.
Reagan said his is not "a warlike or ag
gressive nature; I don't itch to get my
thumb on the button. ..."

it because the revenues are "so gigantic,
and already committed in programs."
Blasts treaty
Reagan made his sharpest comments in
blasting Carter's SALT II treaty. He said tlatly
and tirmly that he would withdraw the tre
aty from the Senate, where it is stalled at
Carter's request. It would takea two-thirds
Senate vote to approve the pact.
Carter asked Senate leaders on Jan. 3 to
delay ratification because ot the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan. Six months earlier,
hours after signing the treaty in Vienna,
Austria, he had urged ratification as a mat
ter of common sense for the United States.
In asking for the delay, Carter said he
was not withdrawing the treaty from Se

nate consideration. Asked it he would do
so, Reagan said, "Yes. But at the same time
I did I would make it plain that I was pre
pared to sit down with the Russians tor as
long as it might take to negotiate a legiti
mate arms limitation agreement.
"My objection to SALT II is it is not arms
limitation; it legitimizes arms rate; it he
gins by letting the Soviet Union build KXX)
more warheads, then we can build some
to catch up, only we can't catch up until
1990."
All-out arms race
Carter has accused Reagan ot "abandon
ing arms control policies which have been
supported by every Democratic president
since Harry Truman and every Republican
president since Dwight Eisenhower." He
said new Republican leaders seek "to
launch an all-out nuclear arms race."
Reagan said his SALT negotiations would
have a different tone than that employed
by Carter or his Republican predecessors.
"We have been unilaterally disarming at
the same time we're negotiating . . . with
the other fellow, where all he has to do is
sit there and not give up anything and his
superiority increases," Reagan said. "He
will be tar "more inclined to negotiate in
good faith if he knows that the United
States is engaged in building up its milit
ary," he added.
Reagan said his negotiating stance
would end Soviet confusion about U.S.
goals and determination. "I think some
times they'd feel better ... if they knew
what the game is and who the players are,"
Reagan said.
The former California governor acc used
Carter of trying to divert attention from
administration failures by asserting that a
new GOP administration might lead the
nation toward war.
Reagan said his is not "a warlike or ag
gressive nature; I don't itch to get my
thumb on the button. ..."
New York (AP) — Ronald Reagan says
that as president he would scrap the
Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT II)
without allowing a Senate vote on it, then
toughen the U.S. negotiating stance and
seek new weapons talks with the Soviet
Union.
He said he would strengthen American
military forces to put more pressure on
Moscow by raising "the possibility of an
arms race."
The SAIT II treaty negotiated and signed
by President Jimmy Carter is "fatally
flawed" and"it isn't arms limitation,"
Reagan said. The purpose of an arms ac
cord with the Soviets, Reagan said, is to
insure that "neither one of us can threaten
the other." He insisted Carter's treaty
doesn't meet the test.
Reagan said he would withdraw the tre
aty that has been awaiting Senate approval
for more than 14 months. SALT II already is
on the back burner. It faced an uncertain
vote in the Senate before Carter asked that
it be withheld due to the Soviet interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Arms buildup
In an interview Tuesday with the As
sociated Press, Reagan said a new U.S.
arms buildup would put pressure on the
Russians to strikean acceptable bargain on
Salt 11.
"The one card that's been missing in
these negotiations has been the possibility
of an arms race," Reagan said. "Now, the
Soviets have been racing, but with no
competition. ... He (the Soviets) will be
far more inclined to negotiate in good faith
if he knows that the United States is en
gaged in building up its military."
Reagan dealt.cautiously, likea leaderde
termined to avoid any misstep, with most
other issues raised in the interview. On
the war between Iran and Iraq, for exam
ple, he deferred detailed comment until
he's had an administration briefing on the
situation and has "access to more facts
than I have now."
In any event, he said, it is irrelevant to
discuss use .of U.S. forces to keep the Per

sian Gulf open because "we really don't
have the facility to do very much."
Accuses Carter
Reagan again accused Carter of due king
a (ampaign debate — noting he'd debated
six times this year and Carter not once —
and lie said he suspects the American hos
tages in Iran may be treed betore the Nov.
4 election in an "October surprise" de
signed to blunt his campaign.
Reagan also said that he'll consider issu
ing an executive order to abolish dratt re
gistration, and will "look very closely" at
legislation to eliminate the Departments
of Energy and Fducation.
While he sharply criticized Carter's so
called windfall profits tax on domestically
produced oil, Reagan said a repeal would
not be a high priority with him.
"I don't know that I could do the other
things I've said and immediately eliminate
that, but it is one that I think you could
look to as you progressed, to phasing
out," Reagan said.
The tax is expected to produce $227 bill
ion over the next decade. Reagan said "it
isn't a windfall profits tax, it's a sales tax,"
one that will discourage U.S. oil produc
tion and cost millions ot barrels a day. But
he conceded it would take a while to undo
it because the revenues are "so gigantic,
and already committed in programs."
