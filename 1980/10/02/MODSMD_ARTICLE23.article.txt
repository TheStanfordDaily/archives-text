# Equal pay? Not in Congress
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Six out of 10 women employees
on Capitol Hill lag behind their male counter
parts in pay levels and quality ot assignments,
according to a study issued Tuesday.
The study by the Capitol Hill Women's Politi
cal Caucus noted that Congress has exempted
itself from the Civil Rights Act, Equal Pay Act, the
Equal Opportunity Act and other employee pro
tection laws.
As a result, the study tound, in both the House
and the Senate there are tew women in top-level
jobs and a wide gap in pay scales between
women and men in nearly every job category.
"Despite the tact that Congress has passed
numerous civil rights laws which apply to the
private sec tor, such protections do not exist tor
congressional employees," said )enniter Dorn,
chairman ot the caucus.
The caucus, an organization ot women con
gressional employees, surveyed employment
statistics on 8909 Senate and House employees,
finding that among Senate staff, women earn 67
percent of the average man's salary, and in the
Elouse, 74 percent.
The study found that in the Elouse, women
legislative assistants earn an average of $19,182,
while their male equivalents earn $21,015. The
greatest difference is in the category of field
manager, where women earn an average of
$18,785 compared with $28,041 for men, accord
ing to the caucus report.

In the Senate, the study found, women legis
lative assistants earn an average ot $22,553,
compared with $26, l H)b earned by men. One of
the largest differences in the Senate is among
press assistants, a category in which women
earn an average ot $19,358 and men an average
of $31,204.
Iris Mitgang, chairman of the National Wo
men's Political caucus, said that the results ot
the Capitol Hill Caucus study clearly point to the
lack of women in key positions in the legislative
branch of the national government.
"The problem is one of representation for
those members of society called women. The
number of women in key, critical, decision
making positions is still low, and the impact
which women can have upon decisions is crucial
to their existence," said Mitgang, a California
attorney.
Only about 15 percent of the female congres
sional staffers are in policy-making jobs, while
nearly half of the male employees hold such
positions, the report said. According to the
study, 37 percent of the women hold clerical
jobs, in contrast to only 7 percent of the men.
The Capitol Hill caucus urged Congress to
establish a Fair Employment Relations Board that
could decide employee grievances over such
matters as pay and advancement.
Caucus leaders also said that many women
staffers fear that if they speak up about their
inferior pay or job status, they might be fired.
