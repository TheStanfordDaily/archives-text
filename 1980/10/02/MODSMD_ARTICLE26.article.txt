## The 						Cars Panorama: New pix, old lix 
### lay Martel 
In their two previous albums, The Cars
have mixed a modern sound with
bubblegum sensibilities to tally hit atter hit
on both AM and FM frequencies. Often re
ferred to as "New Wave," a label that grows
increasingly nebulous as more bands cash in
on it, this Boston-based band will undoub
tedly prove to be one ot the most popular
American music machines of the Eighties.
The Cars new album, Panorama , uses their
commercially time-tested tormulas with
enough innovation to keep them interesting.
For those of you who drooled over the
lippy lass gushing on the opaque steering
wheel ot The Cars' first record, and bought
their second album for the Vargas pin-up,
don't be discouraged by the relatively sterile
checkered flag that this latest disc seeths with
ample "Best Friend's Girl'' adolescence,
along with the musical hooks that are de
stined to catch several schools of KYA clones.
"Touch and Go," the second cut on the
first side, epitomizes this album's salute to

its commercially successful predeccesors.
The song begins with an eerie, almost dis
sonant tune, but eventually launches into a
good ol' oom-pa-pa chorus which seems to
say: "Don't worry-were pop" atter having
created initial doubts.
The lyrics in Panorama's songs will pose
no suprises for Cars fans. The often cliche,
retried romantic rantings are saved from
total inanity by the wonderful poutiness of
the Benjamin Orr/Ric Ocasek vocals.
But despite the rehashing of old ideas,
which is inevitably the fate of all popular
groups with a distinctive sound, The Cars
manage to cover some new ground in
Panorama .

Roy Thomas Baker, Ihr Cars producer,
creates an underproduced sound through
crafty overproduction, giving a glossy, mod
ern sheen to the album, Ocasek, who wrote
all of Panorama's songs proves his expertise
at creating strongly crafted music, which
resounds pleasingly when flattered by
Thomas' production. "You Wear Those
Eyes, on the second side, captivates the
listener in a beautifully haunting jungle of
space sounds.
Panorama isn't an experimental record,
nor is it an ambitiously innovative one. But in
the tongue-and-cheek unprefentiousness of
its songs, and the Hashes of simple elegante
in its sound, Panorama is definitely fun. .
