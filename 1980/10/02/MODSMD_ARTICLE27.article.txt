Everybody's siik ot the tirst B-52 s album.
Too many parties and the grooves have been
worn away, etched only into the mist\
neurologic tabrii our memories — and
etched very deeply. Everybody's sick ot it.
Why, everybody was able to name all 52 girls
by last November and they certainly had the
16 dances dov\ n by Christmas. Some albums
are overplayed.
But "Suhpriise," yells lead singer Fred
Schneider to the accompaniment of break
ing glass and the tirst notes ot Part\ out of
Bounds," the lead-off cut on the B-52's new
album, Wild Planet They're back, and look
ing for a good time like a bunch of tat kv kids
from Georgia. Which is what they are. \nd in
fact, if the B-52 s are to be recognized as

unique, it must be for their ability to be both
from the South and at the same time not to
be the Allman Brothers, certainly a large
contribution to the annals of rock and roll, as
is the tact that no one ever waved a Confed
erate flag during a B-52's concert.
But it you didn't care for them the first
time around, they haven't changed: Wild
Planet is unmistakably a B-52's album. Yet
while the sound is much the same as it was
on The B-52's (although the Walkie-Talkie
beeper is gone) the group has avoided re
writing their old songs so that the actual
tunes, what you hum, are quite original.
Dirtv Back Road' and "Give Me Back My
Man" are what were called "Haunting
Melodies" back in the '50s (it's hard to write
a really "haunting" rock and roll song) and

literallya// the songs are at least catchy, it not
emminently danceable.
Depending upon whether or not you're
familiar with the B- C i 2's, it would be either
redundant, or next-to-impossible, to de
scribe this group's ambience. One quote,
from "Quiche Lorraine," will suffice:
(Quiche LaPoodle is her name.
Having a good time on a crummy day is our
game.
It's a song about a dog.
What it comes down to is: if you like the
B-52's, you'll think Wild Planet is one of the
best albums of the year — and if you don't,
you'll be sick of it before everybody else is.
