# Mortal Immortal Bachelor

### Mike Lopez 
The Immortal Bachelor is one
of those films where you say,
"It was pretty good, but not as
good as La Cage Aux Folles."
But all comparisons aside, The
Immortal Bachelor does not
live up to its potential.
To begin, the plot is cen
tered around the murder trial
of an attractive and hard
working cleaning woman
(Monica Vitti) who apparently
has killed her husband, Cino
(Giancarlo Ciannini). Amid the
trial testimony of wifebeating,
passionate caresses, and
extra-marital liaisons, a woman
juror (Claudia Cardinale) be
gins to examine her marital
situation. Anyway, the ele
ments of the plot are well de
veloped around these two
themes and eventually become
one.
Despite this somber and
serious scenario, it is hard to
tell whether the film was in
tended to be a drama or com
edy. And it is for this reason

that the film does not achieve
its full potential.
Initially, the dubbing of voi
ces is beautifully in synch with
the lip movement (or at least it
appeared to be), but only to
lose its effect by a poor choice
in voices. Giancarlo Ciannini
sounds like Tom Waits with a
sore throat and Monica Vitti
you would think is from New
York City.
In addition, character
stereotypes are carried out to
an occasional over
exaggeration. Claudia Car
dinale's husband (Vittorio
Cassman) is similar to Diane
Keaton's husband in Play It
Again, Sam. He is all work,
constantly on the phone, and a
general business grunt. Gian
carlo Giannini portrays an ir
responsible, womanizing rogue
who seduces and woos Monica
Vitti into marriage with all the
tact of a forklift. Agreed, the
role demands a character in
this style, but it is still too much
for this reviewer. Even the bit

parts were a little on the over
done side. Enough of the bad,
now to the good.
The plot line flows well with
the trial defendant narrating
pivotal scenes while she is re
living them in her memory.
Claudia Cardinale is an integ
rating character for the movie
and her role superbly high
lights the key elements and
events of the film.
The screen play is well writ
ten with the characters' sub
plots all tying together in the
end. Unlike The Empire Strikes
Back, there are no loose ends
or the feeling of wondering
whether the movie is over or
not. And, of course, the film
does not finish without a
moral: one gets the feeling that
love will conquer all and devo
tion will heal the wounds that
c?n be carelessly inflicted by
or 's mate. (We still do not
know whether this is true in
real life.)
(The Immortal Bachelor is
playing at the Aquarius Twin in
downtown Palo Alto.)
