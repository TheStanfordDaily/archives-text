# Charles and Lucie
## Funny French oldsters 
### Mike Lopez 
It is the ironies in life that
people find to be the tunniest.
Charles and Lucie (Charles et
Lucie) is one of the most ironi
cally funny and deceptively
humorous films to he released
this year.
Charles and lucie are a
couple living in the general vk -
inity of Paris. They are both old
and living a modest and not
so-comfortable lifestyle. Lucie
is clearly the dominant
member of the pair and is only
won over to Charles' opinions
and ideas when he pretends to
have overactive stomach ul
cers. They both desire a better
way of life, but cannot achieve
their mutual wish on his street
vending and her house clean
ing. Charles is constantly trying
to sell their household articles
and is always stopped by
Lucie's abrupt objections.
But as soon as you are lulled

into their way ot lite, Charles
and Lucie become be
neficiaries to an unknown rela
tive's will and are bequeathed
an estate on the Mediterranean
c oast of Franee. The only c ate h
is that they have to [jay the at
torney's fees before they can
collect. Reluctantly, they sell
all of their belongings, includ
ing Lucie's heirloom dresser,
to pay the fee.
As it turns out, they are given
a stolen car and their estate
turns out to be a shack on a
beach access road, which they
do not own either. At this
point, bad luck shows its head
and showers our wayward
couple with numerous misfor
tunes.
As the movie forges on, each
new encounter becomes more
bizarre and more discomfort
ing. Even though there is no
physical harm or extreme vio
lence, it is sometimes difficult
to think that the film is a com

edy. But believe me, you will
come out of the theatre smil
mg.
Not to leaveyou totally hang
ing, the plot takes an interest
ing and unexpected turn and
reverses the wrongs that have
perpetrated themselves on
the not-so-dynamic duo.
Though not nearly as spec
tacular, Charles et Lucie is
much in the same style as
Cousin Cousme and similar
films. There is a light
headedness that can make you
empathize with the pro
tagonists as well as a few sober
ing issues that remove the fan
tasy sugar coating. In the end,
you realize that one grows
through experiences rather
than material affluence.
Charles and lucie is a film that
you can see more than once.
(Charles and Lucie is playing
at the Bijou Theatre in Palo
Alto.)
