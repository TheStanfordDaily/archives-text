# As war moves into stalemate
## Iraq offers four-day truce 
### 
From Daily wire services
Baghdad, Iraq â€” Iraq declared it
will stop fighting Iran for four days
starting Sunday, but will return any
Iranian tire. The new Iraqi truce offer
Followed Iran's rejection of a U.N.
ease-fire call and renewed air at
tacks by both sides at the battletront.
The Iraqi announcement was
made yesterday at the United Na
tions. Iraqi spokesman Salah al-
Nukhtar said the dates Oct. 5 to R
were chosen to allow time tor con
sultatrons with Iran by the United Na
tions and by an Islamic peace mission
headed by President Mohammed Zia
ul-Haq of Pakistan. Al-Mukhtar said
that during the four-day period, "if
military action is taken against us we
will return the fire."
There was no immediate reaction
from Tehran to the Iraqi declaration,
which came at a time when the war
seemed to be moving into a stale
mate caused by unexpectedly stiff
Iranian resistance to Iraqi forces.
Discussions useless
The Iraqi move followed President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's rejection of a
U.N. Sec urity Council call for an end
to the war "so long as I raq is in viola
tion of our territorial sovereignty." In
a message to U.N. Secretary-General
kurt Waldheim, Bani-Sadr said appe
als tor a c ease-tire "cannot be consi
dered by our government" and there
is "no use in any discussion, directly
or indirectly."
In Tehran, Prime Minister
Mohammad Ali Ra|ai was reported
studying a new U.S. letter on the 52
American hostages. But in
Washington. State Department
spokesman lack Cannon said it was
the same letter the United States
publicly acknowledged a week ago

and was designed to assure Iran of
U.S. neutrality in the Iran-Iraq crisis.
The American hostages began their
334 th day of captivity this morning.
Iran pledged yesterday to keep
open the vital Strait of Hormuz,
which c arries 40 percent of the non
communist world's oil supply. The
pledge came in response to increas
ing concern from its Persian Cult
coast neighbors that the Tehran gov
ernment might launch a desperation
raid against the Arab states' oil tields.
Fueled fears
The fears were fueled by con
tinued warnings from Iran that the
gull states tace retaliation it they help
Iraq in ihe bitter 10-day-old unde
clared war between the Arabian and

the Persian giants of the region.
The Iranian announcement, issued
through the office of Prime Minister
Ra|ai, appeared to observers here to
be a move to forestall any interna
tional action to keep the strait open.
The statement accused other na
tions of considering "interterence in
the region ot the gulf" under the
guise of keeping shipping moving in
the 40-mile-wide strait that runs bet
ween Iran and Oman and carries oil
from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other
gulf states to the rest of the world.
Continued fighting
While Iran and Iraq traded
rhetoric, fighting continued bet
ween the two nations.
Iraq said Iranian warplanes
launched seven "savage" strikes in
live Iraqi provinces and c laimed that
Iraqi jets hammered oil depots and
concentrations of Iranian tanks in
wide-ranging attacks.
After a day of tank and infantry hat
ties, Bani-Sadr announced recapture
of the Iranian border city of Mehran
and the Iranian news agency said the
city welcomed Iranian troops that
"lifted the siege by Iraqi forces."
No compromise
Iran also said it pushed Iraq: invad
ers out of the oil port of Khorram
shahr a day after Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini re
jected an early cease-fire and said
Iran "will not compromise" until
Iraqi forces are driven from Iranian
soil.
An Iraqi military communique said
Iraq's |ets hit oil depots in Ahwaz, the
capital of Iran's Khuzestan oil pro
vince, destroyed rail facilities, a
bridge and an ammunition dump in
De/tul and hit Iranian tank concent
rations near Ahwaz and Abadan.
Iraq said Iranian warplanes at
tacked seven Iraqi cities, including
Basra and Umm Wasr port in the
south and kirkuk and Mosul in the
north. Baghdad reported 12 Iraqi civi
lians were killed and four injured in
the Iranian raids. Iraq said the "sav
age strikes" were retaliation for de
teats conceded by the Iranian forces
on the battlefront."
Meanwhile, experts in
Washington said the Iraqi nuclear re
search reactor bombed by Iranian
warplanes on Tuesday contained no
atomic fuel, but that an accurate hit
on an operating facility could spread
radioactive material into the atmos
phere.
A small Russian-built test facility
nearby is operational, but also was
not struck in the Iranian raid.
