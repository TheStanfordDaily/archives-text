The Second Western Front,
an underground music and arts
festival held annually, will take
place October 17th through
the 26th, Independent or
alternative-minded musicians,
filmmakers, performers and
writers, as well as video, per
formance and graphic artists
will come from all parts of the
United States and several
foreign countries to participate
in the 10-day festival in San
Francisco.
More than 65 rock and
new music bands, and a large
number of artists, |oined
with thousands of tans in a
highly successful festival last
year. The organizers, most ot
whom are important Bay Area
New Wave music and arts bac
kers, have planned tor this
year's festival to be even bet
ter, with upwards ot eighty
bands participating. Featured
from the UK will be Young
Marble Giants, Cabaret Vol
taire, and Stitt Little Fingers.
From West Coast cities such as
L.A., Seattle, and Vancouver
will come D.0.A., X, Black

Flag, Blackouts, and Ceza X.
Our Daughter's Wedding, and
possibly lames Chance, will
come from New York. Xnd ot
course, our venerable San
Francisco bands including
Mutants, Crime, Eye Protec
tion, and SVT, will be perform
ing. Reggae will include The
Rastafarians and Axum. Fea
tured among the arts will be a
tree show of street posters of
punk and underground
graphics. The events will be
held in various venues, gal
leries, and lofts in the City, and
some will take place at the
Keystone F'alo Alto.
This will be an ideal oppor
tunity tor Stanford students to
hear and see some of the best
local and international under
ground culture. Last year's
Western Front was very excit
ing and open-minded. Em
phasis on alternatives has this
year brought about the stipula
tion that three-fourths ot the
bands must be unsigned to
major labels. In addition, all
venues will have to give clear
justification as to why minors
may not be admitted.
