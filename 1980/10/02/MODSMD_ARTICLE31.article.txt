# Auditions to be held for Gaieties
## 
### 
Auditions will be held on Oc
tober 7,8, and 9 lor the 1480
edition of Gaieties, the tradi
tional Big Game revue. The
show is being, as always, pro
duced by Ram's Head, the
student-run theatrical organi
zation. The cast and crew of
Gaieties, from producer and
star on down to prop person
and walk-ons, will consist en
tirely ot students. The script
was written by Rick Clyne with
music by Andy Fehrenbach.
Although every edition of
Gaieties is entirely original, the
show is an old Stanford tradi
tion, perhaps the lone survivor
of the days of the Plug-Ugly
and the Pajamarino. Performed
at the end of Big Game Week,
Gaieties both satirizes campus
life and whips Cardinal guys
and gals into a frenzy of hatred
for the loathsome Cal
"Weenies." The climax of the
show occurs during Dean Fred
Hargadon's annual cameo ap
pearance; this year Hargadon
will be portraying Mr. Mitchell
from the popular Dennis the
Menace comic strip.
Performance dates are
November 13 and 14.
