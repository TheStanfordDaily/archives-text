House to vote on Myer's expulsion
Washington — The House ot Representatives will undertake
something this morning it hasn't done in nearly 120 years —
expelling one ot its own members. And the member in ques
tion, Rep. Michael "Ozzie Mvers (D-Pa.) expects to be thrown
out.
The House Ethics Committee has recommended Myers' ous
ter, and if the full House agrees — by a two-thirds majority — he
will be the first member expelled since three border state
congressmen were banished during the Civil War on charges
they committed treason bv |oining the Contederacy.
On July 13, 1861, tor example, the House voted, 94 to 45 —
barely over the required two-thirds margin — to expel Rep.
John Clark ot Missouri tor "taking up arms' against the gov
ernment in a battle at Boonville, Mo., the month before.
On Dec. 2 of the same vear, Rep. lohn Reid ot Missouri was
expelled by a voice vote, also tor fighting tor the Confederate
torces. And the next day Rep. Henry Burnett ot Kentucky was
similarly sacked tor taking part in a revolutionary convention
allegedly designed to carry his state out ot the Union.
In 1921. the House tried to expel Rep. Thomas Blanton tor
inserting an obscenity-tilled speech in the Congressional Re
cord but couldn't get the two-thirds margin necessary and
ended up censuring him instead.
The Ethics Committee report said expulsion tor Myers is the
only sanction that fits his crimes — taking a $50,000 bribe from
an undercover FBI agent in the Abscam investigation.
Mvers said he still plan* to campaign toi re-election in his
south Philadelphia district. It he wins on Nov. 4, after being
expelled, the House would be faced with the question of
whether to seat him in the new Congress. Mvers has said he will
resign when all his court appeals are exhausted.
Bill limits state power over church
Sacramento — A bill signed by the governor that limits the
state s authority over churches places lawsuits against Synanon
and the Worldwide Church ot God in "serious jeopardy, At
torney General George Deukmejian said yesterday.
Deukmejian's comments came in response to Gov. Edmund
Brown's announcement that he had signed 581493 by Sen.
Nicholas Petns (D-Oakland).
The Democratic governor also signed bills immediately end
ing his widely ignored odd-even gasoline sales program and
increasing the emphasis on teaching English to the 288 000
students in the bilingual education program.
He vetoed 42 bills, manv of them spending measures, and
said the action was in keeping with "a policy of fiscal pru
dence."
Among the non-fiscal bills vetoed was another church
related measure, SBl632bvSen. H.L. Richardson iR-Arcadia). It
would have protected the tax-exempt status ot any church that
made political statements, ranging trom sermons to candidate
endorsements, in line with its religious principles.
"This bill would violate the First Amendment principle of
separation of church and state by authorizing political action
for religious organizations but not tor other nonprofit corpora
tions," Brown said in his veto message.
Richardson called the veto "a pagan assault against the
churches of California "
China enters World Bank and IMF
Washington — China took its place as a member ot the World
Bank and International Monetary' Fund yesterday with a speech
by Finance Minister Wang Bingqian, who pledged that the
Socialist nation would give "tull play to the positive aspects ot
market economy."
Stressing that China had not vet recovered trom "a decade of
chaos" that ended in 197b, Wangsaid, "We aregoing to give the
enterprises a greater say in running their own affairs, and we
will apply the economic leverage exercised through fixing
prices, setting taxes and interest rates, and having recourse to
bank credits under the overall guidance ot state planning."
He also promised that China would try to develop foreign
trade, import foreign capital and expand economic coopera
tion with other countries. Because some American companies
reportedly have been discouraged about the prospects for
doing business in China after the abandonment ot a projected
5250 million foreign trade center, Wang said:
"This (cooperative policy) is not a makeshitt measure, but a
long-term policy that we will be following."
He noted that China has now established correspondent
relationships with 975 banks in 144 countries and is in the
process of drafting "relevant economic legislation to guarantee
the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors and col
laborators."
But having made his bow to the free-market oriented leaders
ot the IMF and World Bank, Wang promptly lined China up with
the Third World bloc pressing tor major changes in both institu
tions.
"The international monetary system established %t Bretton

Woods (N.H.)can no longer meet the needs ot our new condi
tions and must be performed so as to bring about the early
establishment ot a new, equitable and rational international
monetary system."
Emergency declared in flood area
Stockton — Gov Jerry Brown declared a state ot emergency
yesterday as 2bo young people shored up a fragile railbed pro
tecting Oakland's main water supply and 45,000 acres ot prime
farmland trom Sacramento delta floodwaters.
The governor's action paved the way tor a possible presiden
tial declaration ot emergency tor I ower Jones Tract The tract is
part ot the rich Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta which is a
San Francisco Bay tributary network ot some 1000 miles of
rivers, canals and other waterways washed by tidal waters
through the Golden Gate.
Don Irwin, chief ot the federal emergency management divi
sion ot the state Office ot fmergency Services, said Brown's
signature also "allows state agencies to provide assistance,
although most of those people were already on the scene."
The 2b() young California Conservation Corps workers were
trying to reinforce the 5'.--mile Santa Fe Railroad right of way,
which is holding back the swirling water that rushed through a
levee breach last Friday.
Aqueducts that carry 90 percent ot the water supply for Oak
land and other communities are |ust 100 yards on the dry side of
the railbed.
Officials guiding the battle to save the railbed said a predic
tion ot balmy weather over the next five days was welcome
because strong tide or wind-whipped wave action could wash
out the railbed.
Sweden searches for prowler sub
Stockholm — Sweden's navy searched with growing anger
Tuesday for a stubborn, mystery submarine — believed to be
Soviet — that has prowled Swedish territorial waters tor at least
12 days.
Naval sea and air torces, with depth charges at the ready,
were engaged in a round-the-clock hunt tor the submarine,
which has ignored 19 warning depth charges fired so tar from a
sate distance in an effort to make it surface.
However, naval sources said the navy now intended to fire
the next depth charges as close as 50 teet, in the hope of
bombing it to the surface — despite the risk that charges at such
close range could sink the submarine.
But first the neutral Swedes, whose navy has not been to war
in 171 years, will have to find the submarine. The last contact by
sonar soundings was on Sunday, before the submarine disap
peared in a frustrating game ot hide-and-seek.
Navy spokesman Wvn Enqvist refused to comment on re
ports published here identifying the mystery vessel as Soviet
made Whisky-class sub with two diesel and two electric engines
— a type used by the Soviet and Polish navies.
In London, Western naval sources said all submarines ot the
Westerr NATO alliance were accounted for. They said there
was little doubt the vessel in Swedish waters belonged to a
Warsaw Pact nation, probably the Soviet Union.
Arab bank to gain federal charter
Washington — The National Bank of Abu Dhabi has received
tentative approval trom federal regulators to establish a branch
in Washington that the Arab sheikdom plans to use as a major
vehicle tor recycling its oil money throughout the Western
Hemisphere.
The Abu Dhabi International Bank is completing require
ments tor a charter set by the U.S. Comptroller ot the Currency
and is scheduled to open for business later this year, said a
representative ot the bank regulatory agency.
The Washington bank will be a wholly owned subsidiary ot
the National Bank ot Abu Dhabi, which has assets ot $4.5 billion
and is the fitth-largest financial institution in the Middle East.
Abu Dhabi is already among the most aggressive Arab nations
in investing in the United States, and the Washington otfice is
expected to lead to further participation in American financial
markets.
"They want to establish a base in Washington for their in
vestments in the Western Hemisphere," said David Toufic Miz
rahi, publisher ot Mid East Report, an international newsletter
on Middle Eastern finance. "Their investments in the United
States and South America will be channeled through this
bank."
Banks increased prime lending rate
New York — The cost of business borrowing jumped another
notch yesterday as most commercial banks raised their prime
lending rates to 13.5 percent. Some Wall Street analysts expect
the rate to climb even higher, delaying recovery from the cur
rent recession.
The boost ot one-half percentage point was spurred by in

creases in the banks' cost ot tunds and brought the key lending
rate to its highest point in tour months.
Chase Manhattan Bank, otten a trendsetter lor the prime, led
the latest rate increase. Other major banks across the country
quickly followed suit, marking the seventh rate jump in as many
weeks. The prime is nov\ at its highest point since late May,
when it stood at 14 percent.
Among the other major banks to raise their rates were Bank
ot America in San Francisco, First National Bank of Chicago, and
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Chemical Bank in New York.
The prime is the rate banks charge on short-term loans to
their best-risk corporate customers. Smaller and less credit
worthy businesses usually pay at least one percentage point
above the prime tor their loans.
The prime does not apply to consumer loans, but its recent
increases have paralleled rises in home mortgage rates and
auto loan rates. Some economists say those increases are delay
ing the economy's recovery trom recession.
AP survey shows food costs rising
Supermarket shoppers got a break trom rising prices last
month, but an Associated Press (AP) marketbasket survey
shows grocery bills during the first three-quarters ot 1980 went
up much taster than thev did in the same period ot 1979.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, predicts
that food prices will jump sharply during the rest ot this year
and will rise at a double-digit rate next year
The AP drew up a random list of 15 commonly purchased
tood and nonfood items, checked the price at one supermarket
in each ot 13 cities on March 1, 1973 and has rechecked on or
about the start of each succeeding month.
Among the highlights of the latest survey:
— The marketbasket bill increased at the checklist store in
eight cities last month, up an average of 1.4 percent. The bill
decreased at the checklist store in five cities, down an average
ot 2.2 percent. The increases and decreases canceled each
other out, leaving the overall, average bill unchanged during
the month. During August, the overall bill was up by 2.9 per
cent.
— Comparing prices today with those at the start ot the year,
the AP tound the average marketbasket bill at the checklist
store rose an average of 10.1 percent in nine months. During
the same period last year, the* marketbasket bill was up an
average of 6.1 percent.
— The Department ot Agriculture says that prices during the
last quarter of the year will rise at an annual rate of 13 to 15
percent. Next year's increase, the department says, will be
about 10 to 15 percent.
Carter responds to debate issue
Washington — President Jimmv Carter took the offensive
against Ronald Reagan on the debate issue Tuesday night and
strongly appealed to Democratic Party contributors to help him
turn back what he said is the "relatively dismal future" Reagan's
election would mean for the country.
Speaking to about 800 people at a $1000-a-plate Democratic
National Committee fund-raising dinner here. Carter poked
tun at Reagan's Hollywood background and chided the Repub
lican nominee over the negotiations to arrange a debate bet
ween the two major party presidential candidates.
"It's a travesty to know that it has not been possible to
arrange it (a Carter-Reagan debate) when it is needed," the
president said.
Carter refused to participate in a three-way debate with
Reagan and independent presidential candidate John Ander
son in Baltimore Sept. 21. But Reagan has refused several invita
tions to debate alone with the president, and his latest rejection
of such an invitation from the League of Women Voters has
given the Carter campaign the chance to seize the initiative on
the issue.
Carter spoke briet'lv at the end of the fund-raising dinner and
there was little emotion in his voice. But the basis of his appeal
was emotional as he reminded the Democrats of the 1968 elec
tion. He said the late Hubert Humphrey was defeated by former
President Richard Nixon in that election because not enough
Democrats worked tor a Humphrey victory.
He suggested indirectly that a Reagan victory could mean
"the alienation of black from white, Christian trom Jew, rich
from poor and North from South," and said he needed the
active support of Democrats in a number of the states where
the race between Reagan and himself is close
