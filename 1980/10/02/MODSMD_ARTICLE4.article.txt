## 
### Brad Crystal 
A preliminary hearing is scheduled
for Oct. 6 in Redwood City tor three
Stanlord students charged with con
spiracy to manufacture illicit drugs.
The hearing is expected to deter
mine whether the three students,
Warren Dean, )ohn Mack and Daryl
Singh, will have to face trial in San
Mateo County Superior Court.
Narcotics agents arrested the three
students last February and March
after equipment used to make
methamphetamines (speed) was
seized at their residences.
If convicted, the students' sen
tences could range from probation

io four years in jail, according to San
Mateo County Deputy District Attor
ney Chuck Smith.
Pre-trial sift
Belore the case can go to trial a
judge must sift through the evidence
and decide whether a "strong suspi
cion" of guilt exists, Smith said.
The case will reach trial only it the
judge is convinced of probable
cause, said Smith.
However, the defense has moved
that the charges be dismissed on the
grounds that the D.A.'s office failed
to comply with a "discovery motion"
calling for full disclosure of state files
relating to the case, Smith said.

defense was a Feb. 6 transcript of a

Elsberg of the California Department
of Justice.
The sales reports linked the stu
dents names to purchases of chemi
cals commonly used in making
speed, Elsberg said.

police prepared an affidavit for a
search warrant.
Upon inspection of their premises,
narcotics agents tound glassware
and other effects used in making
speed, as well as residue of the drug,
Elsberg said.
He added that no finished am
phetamines were found.
Mack and Singh were arrested in
early February, while Dean surren
dered to police March 5.
All three pleaded not guilty.
To supplement the state's physical
evidence, Elsberg said agents will
