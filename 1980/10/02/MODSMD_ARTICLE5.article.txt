# 'Friends' push for reinstatement of Indian
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Although University President Donald Kennedy
has issued a statement insisting that the Indian wi!i
not return as mascot here, supporters ot Timm
Williams (Chief Lighttoot), the man who per
sonified the Indian mascot betore it was
abolished, are once again pushing tor its return.
It has now been eight years since a group 01
native American students appealed to tormer Pres
ident Richard Lyman to abolish the Indian as Stan
ford s symbol, on the grounds that it was degrad
ing for a human being to be used as a mascot.
Last vear a group headed by Larry Ziebell, a Palo
Alto insurance executive, initiated a movement to
"Bring Chief Lighttoot Back to the farm," con
ducted through the sale ot T-shirts and newspaper
advertisements.
Now Ziebell and an unknown number of sup
porters have re-emerged, this time under the
name ot "Friends of the Stanford Indian," and are
sponsoring a rally in White Plaza tomorrow atter
noon.
Tribal petition
Ziebell said Williams will produce a petition he
said was signed bv 77 elected representatives of
California's Indian tribes which calls for the return
of the Indian as a Stantord svmbol. Ziebell would
not say which tribes were represented, nor to
whom the petition would be shown.
He also claimed Williams will explain a "mis
take" made in 1972 which led to the striking of the
Indian mascot and Chief Lighttoot.

"He's going to clarity th< whole situation," said
Ziebell. "I don't know what he'll do with it. I don't
knov\ it he'll it aroundouh I will be available."
Registered group
Ziebell c laimed the "Friends 01 the Stantord In
dian' is a registered non-profit organization with
over 1(X) members. An ad printed in Wednesday's
Daily said contributions could be made to the or
ganization and listed a post office box.
Ziebell also said Jack Lindel, Stanford Class of
'30, was the treasurer. Lindel. however, later de
nied he was the treasurer and said the money was
controlled by a loose-knit group.
Ziebell. who admitted to spending much time
and money conducting this campaign, said neither
he nor Williams ever received any money from the
group's tund. However, Lindel said Williams' ex
penses were paid from the tund during his trips in
the area promoting the Indian as Stanford's sym
bol.
Student recognition
The "friends of the Stanford Indian' was re
cently registered with the ASSU as a student
group.
Kennedy's statement, which appeared in yes
terday's Campus Report, said, "A mascot which is
offensive or demeaning to a group of people
should quite simply not be permitted. That princi
ple is not subject to ad|udication bv referendum,
any more than any lundamental human right is."
Kennedy also is quoted as saying he supports
the ASSU relerendum dratted last April which calls
for a binding vote on a non-human mascot. That

referendum, explained ASSU Co-president Marc
Ventresca, would provide the University with a
mascot it a b() percent majority can be achieved in
the spring election.
Not just yes or no
"What's important is tor students to stop look
ing at this as a yes-or-no issue on the Indian," said
Nancy Takahashi of the COP. "What we have to
start doing is getting behind the griffin or working
to unify the school around some viable mascot."
Ventresca added. "What bothers me about
Ziebell and his supporters is that every year they
try to indoctrinate the freshmen with the idea that
this is still a controversy. It is not. We will never
have the Indian and as soon as we can vote a
mascot the problem will disappear in three years.
"It's just like the Western Culture require
ment," he continued. "In three years nobody will
think it is unique at all."
Follow-up sessions
The COP is planning some informational ses
sions to follow Williams' Friday rally, to which
most of the Bay Area media have been invited.
Ziebell said Williams will appear at Saturday's
football game against San Jose State, although
probably not on the field.
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said the campus
police have been notified not to allow Williams on
the field during the game, and he also said he sent
Williams a letter saying his presence was not wel
come there.
Williams,whom Zimbell said was on his way to
Stanford, could not be reached for comment.
