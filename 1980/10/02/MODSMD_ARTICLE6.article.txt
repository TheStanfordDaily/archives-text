# Amid predictions that the big one is coming
## University buys $60 million earthquake insurance policy 
### Steve Moe 
Most Californians are worried about predictions of
a ma|or earthquake occurring in the near future, but
few are doing anything about it. The University, how
ever, has taken precautionary measures by once
again purchasing earthquake insurance.
According to Robert Beth, risk manager tor the
University, the purchase earlier this year makes Stan
ford the only University in the nation to hold such a
policy.
The $60 million policy with $3 million deductible
covers damage to buildings and their contents owned
by the University, the Medical Center and the Stan
ford Shopping Center. Those three entities share an
annual premium of approximately $480,000.
The University carried earthquake insurance from
1923 to 1970, at which time a higher deductible and
premium made it uneconomical and the policy was
dropped, said Beth.
Improved market
He said the University bought the new policy this
year bee ause of improvements in the earthquake in
surance market, as well as the new earthquake pre
dictions.
He explained that the same policy last year would
have had a premium of $1 million a year and a deduc
tible of $10 million.
"Each year we must compare the cost to the be
nefits since the market is constantly fluctuating,' he
said.
This year it was a buyer's market. Next year, who
knows? If it's not worth the cost, we'll discontinue the
policy," he said.

Predictions that a major earthquake will occur soon
have been made by Civil Engineering Profs, lames
Gere and Haresh Shah and Geology Prof. Richard
Jahns. They estimate a 50 percent chance that
California will experience a mapr quake within the
next decade.
In another studv done last year, three engineering
students predic ted that the University would lose $50
million due to earthquakes in the next 20 years.
According to Beth, current replacement costs for
buildings on campus, the Medical Center and Stan
ford Shopping Center total $600 million and their
contents are valued at $250 million. Past studies have
shown that a major earthquake would damage no
more than 10 percent of all buildings.
10 percent of c ost
The $60 million policy represents 10 percent of
the replacement costs of the buildings.
Beth noted in his study of the San Francisco ear
thquake of 1906 that although 22 percent of the cam
pus foundations were destroyed, very few ot the con
tents were damaged.
However, because ot the high cost ot today's re
search and computing tacilities, damage to building
contents is also covered by the policy.
The University also recently purchased additional
insurance covering employee death or injury to sup
plement the liability insurance the University already
carries. Students and their property, however, are
not covered by the policy because such insurance
would duplicate conventional policies already owned
by most students or their families, said Beth.

quake, and as a result, the University, has purchased a
$f>0 million insurance policy to cover potential losses.
