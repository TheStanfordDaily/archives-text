## Schmidt clashes with church 
### 
The Washington Post
Bonn — A clash between
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
and the Catholic Church has
managed to add a spark to the
lackluster West German elec
tion campaign, now entering
its final stretch.
The quarrel has focused on
Bonn's growing debt — a
somewhat complicated subject
but one with significance tor
West Germany's social and
economic policy.
Its emergence as a central
campaign theme is a victory of
sorts tor the opposition Christ
ian Democratic and Christian
Social Union parties, which
have been attacking excessive
government spending. For the
first time in what has been an
uphill run for challenger Franz
losef Strauss, Schmidt has ap
peared on the defensive.
The episode also has pro
duced some rather odd twists
with Schmidt having taken to
quoting papal encyclicals dur
ing campaign speeches and
West German bishops preach
ing political slogans from the
pulpit.
The church fired the first
shot. In a strategically timed
letter read in churches last
Sunday, the West German
bishops warned against the
state's expanding roles in daily
life and pointed critically to
Bonn's increased level of inde
btedness and the expansion ot
government for liberalizing
abortion and divorce laws so
that "love is destroyed and
peace endangered.''
Such use of the pulpit tor
politicking rankled Schmidt,
once a national elder of the
Lutheran Church. "I don't see
anything about state inde
btedness in either the Old or
New Testaments," he re
sponded. "Nor was I aware
that there was a theological in
stitute specializing in financial
affairs." There was also talk,
though unsupported in Bonn,

that the government might
consider stopping its service of
collecting taxes tor the church.
Traditional rift
In another church statement
last week, the bishops reas
serted their right to comment
on political issues, calling it
their duty to speak out no
matter whether it is political,
useful or troublesome." To
remain silent, thev said, would
be a retreat to the past.
As for the threat to stop the
tax collection, the bishops said
this practice has not been a
favor but a business deal, for
which the church pays the state
more than $73 million a year.
The current row threatens to
revive a traditional rift between
the Catholic Church and the
largely Protestant Social
Democratic Party. The rift
dates back to 1931 when a
papal encyclical said it was im
possible to be both a good
Catholic and a real socialist.
This attitude softened in the
mid-1960s as a result both of
the Second Vatican Council
ruling that Catholics were free
to differ in their political opin
ions and the formation in West
Germany of a Social Democra
tic Christian Democratic coali
tion. A new tolerance took
hold in the Catholic's regard
for Social Democrats.
Tolerance eroded
Now the tolerance appears
to have eroded. This may be a
reflection of the move by the
Vatican itself into a new con
servative, and at the same time
politically active, mood, since
the accession of Pope )ohn
Paul 11. In the Social Democ
rats' view, the decisive factor
behind the surprising politici
zation of the church in West
Germany is the drift of the
Catholic voters away from the
Christian Democratic Union
since Strauss was chosen as
rival to Schmidt.
Though the conflict has en
livened the national campaign,

tew expect it to have a decisive
effect on the outcome. All the
same, the irritation the church
letter caused in Schmidt is evi
dent in his campaign speeches.
When talking about family
and work issues, the chancel
lor had begun to drop in a re
ference to the fact that he has
discussed social policy with
two popes over the years. To
justify state involvement in the
economy, he has been quoting
from the "Mater et Magistra"
encyclical of Pope John XXIII.
Indebtedness
West Germany's strong
economy, he said in speeches
last week, is due not to church
policy but to the policies of his
partv during its eleven years in
power.
Even so, the issue of Bonn's
indebtedness is not likely to go
away after the election Oct. 5.
It is part of a larger debate in
the country about the role ot
the state, public sector borrow
ing and inflation, and the elec
tion has simply served as a
catalyst.
On the surface, the West
German economy still looks
quite healthy, with an inflation
rate this year averaging 5.5 per
cent, unemployment under 4
percent and a growth rate over
two percent.
But the fear of excessive debt
strikes a sensitive chord in
West Germany, where the pub
lic debt amassed between two
world wars led to financial col
lapse and currency devaluation
that dissipated family savings
overnight. One result has been
a great emphasis placed on sav
ing. Today, the average West
German saves about 13 percent
of his income, compared with
the four percent saved by
Americans.
Borrowing small
Total borrowing by Bonn is
small in comparison with debt
levels in other developed
countries. It accounts for only
28 percent of gross national

product, compared with 52
percent in the United States
and 61 percent in Britain.
But what the opposition has
been complaining most loudly
about is how fast Bonn's debt is
growing. The volume tripled in
the 1970s to $232 billion, climb
ing almost as sharply in the last
4Vi years as in the previous 26
years since the republic was
founded. Experts predict it will
rise to $255 billion by the end ot
this year.
Much of the growth is attri
buted to spending programs
initiated by Schmidt's govern
ment after the 1973-74 oil crisis
to stimulate the slowing
economy. Other credit moves
were encouraged on West
Germany by leading industrial
countries at the Western
economic summit in Bonn in
1978.
The recent weakening of
the economy — marked by tht
appearance of deficits in cur
rent accounting and trade tor
the first time in 15 years and a
slowdown in production — has
heightened sensitivity among
West Germans to economic
concerns. However, Schmidt
and his Social Democrat
partners can and do confi
dently point to the valued West
German mark as a sign of over
all economic stability.

about is how fast Bonn's debt is
growing. The volume tripled in
the 1970s to $232 billion, climb
ing almost as sharply in the last
4Vi years as in the previous 26
years since the republic was
founded. Experts predict it will
rise to $255 billion by the end ot
this year.
Much of the growth is attri
buted to spending programs
initiated by Schmidt's govern
ment after the 1973-74 oil crisis
to stimulate the slowing
economy. Other credit moves
were encouraged on West
Germany by leading industrial
countries at the Western
economic summit in Bonn in
1978.
The recent weakening of
the economy — marked by tht
appearance of deficits in cur
rent accounting and trade tor
the first time in 15 years and a
slowdown in production — has
heightened sensitivity among
West Germans to economic
concerns. However, Schmidt
and his Social Democrat
partners can and do confi
dently point to the valued West
German mark as a sign of over
all economic stability.

The Washington Post
Bonn — A clash between
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt
and the Catholic Church has
managed to add a spark to the
lackluster West German elec
tion campaign, now entering
its final stretch.
The quarrel has focused on
Bonn's growing debt — a
somewhat complicated subject
but one with significance tor
West Germany's social and
economic policy.
Its emergence as a central
campaign theme is a victory of
sorts tor the opposition Christ
ian Democratic and Christian
Social Union parties, which
have been attacking excessive
government spending. For the
first time in what has been an
uphill run for challenger Franz
losef Strauss, Schmidt has ap
peared on the defensive.
The episode also has pro
duced some rather odd twists
with Schmidt having taken to
quoting papal encyclicals dur
ing campaign speeches and
West German bishops preach
ing political slogans from the
pulpit.
The church fired the first
shot. In a strategically timed
letter read in churches last
Sunday, the West German
bishops warned against the
state's expanding roles in daily
life and pointed critically to
Bonn's increased level of inde
btedness and the expansion ot
government for liberalizing
abortion and divorce laws so
that "love is destroyed and
peace endangered.''
Such use of the pulpit tor
politicking rankled Schmidt,
once a national elder of the
Lutheran Church. "I don't see
anything about state inde
btedness in either the Old or
New Testaments," he re
sponded. "Nor was I aware
that there was a theological in
stitute specializing in financial
affairs." There was also talk,
though unsupported in Bonn,

that the government might
consider stopping its service of
collecting taxes tor the church.
Traditional rift
In another church statement
last week, the bishops reas
serted their right to comment
on political issues, calling it
their duty to speak out no
matter whether it is political,
useful or troublesome." To
remain silent, thev said, would
be a retreat to the past.
As for the threat to stop the
tax collection, the bishops said
this practice has not been a
favor but a business deal, for
which the church pays the state
more than $73 million a year.
The current row threatens to
revive a traditional rift between
the Catholic Church and the
largely Protestant Social
Democratic Party. The rift
dates back to 1931 when a
papal encyclical said it was im
possible to be both a good
Catholic and a real socialist.
This attitude softened in the
mid-1960s as a result both of
the Second Vatican Council
ruling that Catholics were free
to differ in their political opin
ions and the formation in West
Germany of a Social Democra
tic Christian Democratic coali
tion. A new tolerance took
hold in the Catholic's regard
for Social Democrats.
Tolerance eroded
Now the tolerance appears
to have eroded. This may be a
reflection of the move by the
Vatican itself into a new con
servative, and at the same time
politically active, mood, since
the accession of Pope )ohn
Paul 11. In the Social Democ
rats' view, the decisive factor
behind the surprising politici
zation of the church in West
Germany is the drift of the
Catholic voters away from the
Christian Democratic Union
since Strauss was chosen as
rival to Schmidt.
Though the conflict has en
livened the national campaign,

tew expect it to have a decisive
effect on the outcome. All the
same, the irritation the church
letter caused in Schmidt is evi
dent in his campaign speeches.
When talking about family
and work issues, the chancel
lor had begun to drop in a re
ference to the fact that he has
discussed social policy with
two popes over the years. To
justify state involvement in the
economy, he has been quoting
from the "Mater et Magistra"
encyclical of Pope John XXIII.
Indebtedness
West Germany's strong
economy, he said in speeches
last week, is due not to church
policy but to the policies of his
partv during its eleven years in
power.
Even so, the issue of Bonn's
indebtedness is not likely to go
away after the election Oct. 5.
It is part of a larger debate in
the country about the role ot
the state, public sector borrow
ing and inflation, and the elec
tion has simply served as a
catalyst.
On the surface, the West
German economy still looks
quite healthy, with an inflation
rate this year averaging 5.5 per
cent, unemployment under 4
percent and a growth rate over
two percent.
But the fear of excessive debt
strikes a sensitive chord in
West Germany, where the pub
lic debt amassed between two
world wars led to financial col
lapse and currency devaluation
that dissipated family savings
overnight. One result has been
a great emphasis placed on sav
ing. Today, the average West
German saves about 13 percent
of his income, compared with
the four percent saved by
Americans.
Borrowing small
Total borrowing by Bonn is
small in comparison with debt
levels in other developed
countries. It accounts for only
28 percent of gross national

product, compared with 52
percent in the United States
and 61 percent in Britain.
But what the opposition has
been complaining most loudly
about is how fast Bonn's debt is
growing. The volume tripled in
the 1970s to $232 billion, climb

power.
Even so, the issue of Bonn's
indebtedness is not likely to go
away after the election Oct. 5.
It is part of a larger debate in
the country about the role ot
the state, public sector borrow
ing and inflation, and the elec
tion has simply served as a
catalyst.
On the surface, the West
German economy still looks
quite healthy, with an inflation
rate this year averaging 5.5 per
cent, unemployment under 4
percent and a growth rate over
two percent.
But the fear of excessive debt
strikes a sensitive chord in
West Germany, where the pub
lic debt amassed between two
world wars led to financial col
lapse and currency devaluation
that dissipated family savings
overnight. One result has been
a great emphasis placed on sav
ing. Today, the average West
German saves about 13 percent
of his income, compared with
the four percent saved by
Americans.
Borrowing small
Total borrowing by Bonn is
small in comparison with debt
levels in other developed
countries. It accounts for only
28 percent of gross national

product, compared with 52
percent in the United States
and 61 percent in Britain.
But what the opposition has
been complaining most loudly
about is how fast Bonn's debt is
growing. The volume tripled in
the 1970s to $232 billion, climb
ing almost as sharply in the last
4Vi years as in the previous 26
years since the republic was
founded. Experts predict it will
rise to $255 billion by the end ot
this year.
Much of the growth is attri
buted to spending programs
initiated by Schmidt's govern
ment after the 1973-74 oil crisis
to stimulate the slowing
economy. Other credit moves
were encouraged on West
Germany by leading industrial
countries at the Western
economic summit in Bonn in
1978.
The recent weakening of
the economy — marked by tht
appearance of deficits in cur
rent accounting and trade tor
the first time in 15 years and a
slowdown in production — has
heightened sensitivity among
West Germans to economic
concerns. However, Schmidt
and his Social Democrat
partners can and do confi
dently point to the valued West
German mark as a sign of over
all economic stability.
