# Brezhnev blasts U.S. gulf policy

### Washington Post 
Moscow â€” Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev sharply con
demned the United States
Tuesday night for encouraging
the Persian Gulf war, but of
fered no Soviet initiatives to
end it, nor threats to intervene
if it is not.
In a Kremlin speech, the 73-
year-old Communist Party
chief, without ever naming the
United States, declared:
"Some people are obviously

trying to turn this conflict to
their profit. They are those
who want to establish their
control over Middle East oil,
who again dream of turning
Iran into a military base and
gendarme post of im
perialism."
Brezhnev's remarks, in a
toast at a state dinner for Indian
President N.S. Reddy, closely
followed official propaganda,
which has been hammering
away at Washington for al
legedly fomenting the conflict
with Communist Chinese con
nivance. "Neither Iraq nor Iran
will gain anything from mutual
destruction, bloodshed and
undermining each other's
economy," he asserted.
He reiterated the Kremlin's

call to both sides to cease hos
tilities and negotiate. How
ever, he suggested no forum or
formula for this and made no
mention of the 1972 friendship
treaty under which the Soviets
supply arms to Iraq. Iran has
sought unsuccessfully to have
Moscow cease its arms ship
ments and condemn Iraq as the
aggressor.
Brezhnev's toast was made
apparently a short time before
the Carter administration an
nounced that four U.S.
early-warning control aircraft
are being dispatched to Saudi
Arabia to help protect the Mid
dle East's largest oil producer
from possible attack by Iranian
jets. Tehran has threatened at
tacks against any Arab state

supporting Iraq.
Instead, he said U.S. naval
forces in the Indian Ocean
"hang permanently like a
sword of Damocles over the
independent states of the Per
sian Gulf and Red Sea Basin,"
saying this is the principal
source of "dangerous tension
in the world today." Many ob
servers here believe that the
longer the war goes, the more
the Kremlin will gain because
of disruptions in oil supplies to
the capitalist countries. So far,
Iraqi battlefield gains have de
monstrated the potency of
Soviet arms when used by a
well-supplied force, according
to these sources, a lesson the
Kremlin is eager to make clear
to onlooking capitals in the
Middle East and elsewhere.
