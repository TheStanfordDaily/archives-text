# Israelis march in Jerusalem
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — Tens of
thousands of Israelis marched
through jerusalem Tuesday in
a holiday demonstration of af
fection for the city they call
their eternal capital.
A tradition that began as a
sporting event — decades ago
it involved a four-day hike and
camp-out across the hills lead
ing to jerusalem — assumed
political overtones amid wide
spread condemnation abroad
of Israel's proclamation this
summer of its soveriegnty over
Jerusalem.
"Israel is not alone," read
signs carried by immigrant
groups and visitors from ab
road. Israeli Defense Forces
Chief of Staff Raphael Eitan,
watching from a reviewing
stand, said:
"This march is an expression
of the connection of the Jewish
people to its capital, a connec
tion that many nations in the
world do not recognize."
Thousands of Israelis lined
the route of the parade, which
is a feature of the week-lons
harvest-time holiday of Succot.
Israel closes its businesses
soon after noon to celebrate in
the sparkling fall weather that

always precedes the first rains.
The army organized the
march, and some 23,000 sol
diers, sailors and air force per
sonnel took part this year — at
cost estimated at one million
dollars.
Unmilitary march
Although the military played
a large role, it was a rather un
military parade. There were no
tanks or vehicles. Close-order
drill is not an Israeli specialty,
and few units managed to keep
in step. Armored corps units
passed down Jerusalem's Jaffa
Road at more a saunter than a
march. Some organizations
were led by their commanding
officers, whose children, in
shorts and sneakers, walked
along at their side.
About 20,000 civilians took
part in the march, many of
them foot-sore and sun
burned from a long day's 16-
mile hike into the city. But still
they sang and clapped their
hands as they paraded. They
gave the parade a flavor of Is
rael, in the same way Norman
Rockwell paintings portray
Americana.
Support from abroad
There were kibbutzniks in
shorts and caps, and, marching

with one group, a kibbutz cow.
The Keep Israel Beautiful Soci
ety, clad in white, pushed litter
cans on wheels. Druse, a Mos
lem offshoot, marched in tradi
tional black robes and stove
pipe white hats. From Yamit,
the Sinai Peninsula beach city
destined to be given up to
Egypt in 1982, a band of mar
chers carried the grim sign
"Yamit Now, Jerusalem Later"
— and drew spontaneous
cheers from Israeli soldiers in
units marching in the opposite
direction.
Joining the parade were
many delegations of Israeli
supporters from abroad, in
cluding one Japanese contin
gent and representatives of a
group of Christian fundamen
talists from 20 nations, which
this week opened an "Interna
tional Christian Embassy" in
Jerusalem to show their sol
idarity with Israel.
The last unit in the parade
was a military band, and as it
passed, playing traditional Is
raeli marches, thousands of
watchers broke through the
police barricades along the
sidewalk and followed the
parade down Jaffa Road to its
end.
