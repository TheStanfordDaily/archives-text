# Left-wing gains in Labor party
## 
### 
By The Washington Post
London — Britain's deeply
divided opposition Labor Party
was thrown into further disar
ray Wednesday when its an
nual party conference voted by
narrow majorities to change
the way the party's leader and
candidates for Parliament are
to be chosen in the future.
The changes would give a
much greater voice in both
selection processes to left
wing insurgents who have
taken over many grassroots
constituency groups and the
party's national executive.
They want the next labor leader
and its members of Parliament
to offer a more militantly
socialist alternative to the
free-market policies of Con
servative Party Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.

Wednesday's votes at the
party's conference at
Blackpool were a major victory
tor former Energy Minister An
thony Wedgewood-Benn, the
outspoken leader of the left
wing insurgents, who seek to
expand Britain's welfare state,
nationalize more of its indus
try, abolish all private schools
and health care, take Britain
out of the European Common
Market and ban NATO nuclear
weapons from British-soil.
The decisions were a setback
for the party's current leader,
former Prime Minister James
Callaghan, who has tried to
keep the party on a more cen
trist course, working for a
mixed economy, continued
British participation in both the
Common Market and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation,''and nuclear disarma
ment only by multilateral
East-West agreement.
Callaghan, a 68-year-old pat
riarchal figure, had been ex
pected to retire later this year.
The front-runner to be chosen
his successor by the Labor Par
ty's elected members of Parli
ament was expected to be
former Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey, an ag
gressive, sometimes abrasive
defender of these centrist
policies from the party's right
wing.
But one of the party confer
ence votes won by the left
wing insurgents at Blackpool
Wednesday would remove the
selection of the next leader
from the labor members of Par
liament acting alone to an elec

toral college that also would
include representatives of the
party's grassroots constituency
groups and the iabor unions
that provide most of the party's
financial support. This would
likely lead to the selection of
someone more acceptable to
both' the left and right wings
than Healey.
However, the party was un
able to agree on the precise
proportional makeup of an
electoral college to choose a
new leader. If it fails to do so
before the conference ends
this week, the leadership
selection would be left to the
members of Parliament long
enough for Healey to succeed
Callaghan, if he retires.
Healey also suggested after
Wednesday's votes that Labor
members of Parliament could
continue to choose their own
leader anyway since he or she
must be a member of Parlia
ment to become prime minis
ter if Labor were to return to
power. That could leave Labor
with both a parliamentary
leader and a separate party
leader.
Although this could be un
precedented in Britain, Healey
pointed out that it is done in
many European countries. But it
is not what Wedgewood-Benn
and his supporters had in
tended.
The left wing also won a nar
row party conference vote
Wednesday to force all Labor
members of Parliament to face
periodic mandatory re
selection by their local consti
tuency parties to be certain the

members continued to reflect
their views in Parliament.
They narrowly lost a third
vote, however, to allow the
party's national executive, now
controlled by the left wing, to
take away from the parliamen
tary leadership the final say
over the contents of the plat
form future Labor govern
ments would be pledged to
carry out.
Wedgewood-Benn and
other representatives of the
party's left wing, including
some national union leaders,
argued that changes were
necessary to make the party
more democratic by returning
control of its policies from the
parliamentary leadership to
the grassroots.
Other former Labor gov
ernment ministers and union
leaders answered that the lett
wing was being undemocratic
by trying to force the party and
its members of Parliament to
adopt the left wing's uncom
promisingly radical socialist
policies. The most outspoken
of Wedgewood-Benn's oppo
nents from the right wing of the
party, former Education Minis
ter Shirley Williams, publicly
warned of "a fascism of the
left."
She and others from Labor's
right wing have threatened to
leave it and create a new party
if the left wing succeeded in
committing Labor to policies
they could not support. They
fear that Labor would lose the
swing voters it would need to
ever return to power.

many European countries. But it
is not what Wedgewood-Benn
and his supporters had in
tended.
The left wing also won a nar
row party conference vote
Wednesday to force all Labor
members of Parliament to face
periodic mandatory re
selection by their local consti
tuency parties to be certain the

members continued to reflect
their views in Parliament.
They narrowly lost a third
vote, however, to allow the
party's national executive, now
controlled by the left wing, to
take away from the parliamen
tary leadership the final say
over the contents of the plat
form future Labor govern
ments would be pledged to
carry out.
Wedgewood-Benn and
other representatives of the
party's left wing, including
some national union leaders,
argued that changes were
necessary to make the party
more democratic by returning
control of its policies from the
parliamentary leadership to
the grassroots.
Other former Labor gov
ernment ministers and union
leaders answered that the lett
wing was being undemocratic
by trying to force the party and
its members of Parliament to
adopt the left wing's uncom
promisingly radical socialist
policies. The most outspoken
of Wedgewood-Benn's oppo
nents from the right wing of the
party, former Education Minis
ter Shirley Williams, publicly
warned of "a fascism of the
left."
She and others from Labor's
right wing have threatened to
leave it and create a new party
if the left wing succeeded in
committing Labor to policies
they could not support. They
fear that Labor would lose the
swing voters it would need to
ever return to power.
By The Washington Post
London — Britain's deeply
divided opposition Labor Party
was thrown into further disar
ray Wednesday when its an
nual party conference voted by
narrow majorities to change
the way the party's leader and
candidates for Parliament are
to be chosen in the future.
The changes would give a
much greater voice in both
selection processes to left
wing insurgents who have
taken over many grassroots
constituency groups and the
party's national executive.
They want the next labor leader
and its members of Parliament
to offer a more militantly
socialist alternative to the
free-market policies of Con
servative Party Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.

Wednesday's votes at the
party's conference at
Blackpool were a major victory
tor former Energy Minister An
thony Wedgewood-Benn, the
outspoken leader of the left
wing insurgents, who seek to
expand Britain's welfare state,
nationalize more of its indus
try, abolish all private schools
and health care, take Britain
out of the European Common
Market and ban NATO nuclear
weapons from British-soil.
The decisions were a setback
for the party's current leader,
former Prime Minister James
Callaghan, who has tried to
keep the party on a more cen
trist course, working for a
mixed economy, continued
British participation in both the
Common Market and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation,''and nuclear disarma
ment only by multilateral
East-West agreement.
Callaghan, a 68-year-old pat
riarchal figure, had been ex
pected to retire later this year.
The front-runner to be chosen
his successor by the Labor Par
ty's elected members of Parli
ament was expected to be
former Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Denis Healey, an ag
gressive, sometimes abrasive
defender of these centrist
policies from the party's right
wing.
But one of the party confer
ence votes won by the left
wing insurgents at Blackpool
Wednesday would remove the
selection of the next leader
from the labor members of Par
liament acting alone to an elec

toral college that also would
include representatives of the
party's grassroots constituency
groups and the iabor unions
that provide most of the party's
financial support. This would
likely lead to the selection of
someone more acceptable to
both' the left and right wings
than Healey.
However, the party was un
able to agree on the precise
proportional makeup of an
electoral college to choose a
new leader. If it fails to do so
before the conference ends
this week, the leadership
selection would be left to the
members of Parliament long
enough for Healey to succeed
Callaghan, if he retires.
Healey also suggested after
Wednesday's votes that Labor
members of Parliament could
continue to choose their own
leader anyway since he or she
must be a member of Parlia
ment to become prime minis
ter if Labor were to return to
power. That could leave Labor
with both a parliamentary
leader and a separate party
leader.
Although this could be un
precedented in Britain, Healey
pointed out that it is done in
many European countries. But it
is not what Wedgewood-Benn
and his supporters had in
tended.
