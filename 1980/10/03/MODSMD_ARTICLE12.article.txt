# Biracial couples across U.S. face discrimination, threats
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — On June ffe,
Arthur Smothers, 22, and Kath
leen Mikula, 16, were taking a
noontime stroll in downtown
Johnstown, Pa., when they
were shot and killed by a
sniper. Police still are search
ing for a truck driver who re
portedly bragged about shoot
ing them.
Melissa Fiedler and Rufus
Bosticks, both 13, who have
been friends since early child
hood, were seen holding
hands at a Christmas party at
their private church school in
Woodbridge, Va. Melissa was
expelled from her school and
the family ostracized in the
community.
In Milwaukee, Beth
Kraweicki, 24, and her boy
friend, Joe Villa, 28, said they
had little trouble finding
apartments over the tele
phone. But when they ap
peared together to view the
dwellings, they said, landlords
repeatedly refused to rent to
them, even though they didn't
plan to live together.
These three couples in
widely separated parts of the
United States had one thing in
common — they were biracial.
Discrimination against bira
cial couples has subsided in re
cent years, according to Rev.
Tyronne Pitts, racial justice di
rector for the National Council
of Churches, but still is "a real
threat to the civil rights of indi
viduals."
"It is part of the white domi
nation theory that has been
prevalent historically," Pitts
said.
The clergyman cited what he
called a "milder form of vio
lence — it happens when
people choose to mix outside
their race and sometimes have
to give up family ties, then
there's always the crisis the
children of mixed couples
face."
Statistics on violence against
mixed couples are rare, and
one reason cited by Dr. James
Otis Smith, chairman of the
sociology department at the
University of Wisconsin, Mil
waukee, is that such couples
are reluctant to report attacks
on them to authorities.
"Most biracial couples are
reluctant to speak out in fear of
retaliation," Smith said. "They
worry about harassment on the
job and from the community

they live in."
However, Smith, a white
who is married to a latino, said
he believes that society has
moderated its views toward bi
racial couples.
"There is an initial shock, but
it tends to mellow," he said.
"Most people in a given com
munity tend to whitewash it in
their own way."
Not everyone in Wood
bridge, Va., where the hand
holding incident of Melissa
Fiedler and Rufus Bosticks is
still an issue, would agree.
For one thing, Alec Lee Bled
soe, principal of the Marumsco
Baptist Church school and pas
tor of the parent congregation,
has ruled that interracial
romantic relations are against
the tenets of the church.
In addition, Vic Clasberg, an
attorney representing the Fie
dler family in a suit against the
school, said that the family was
driven from its neighborhood
by threats and other incidents.
"This all cameabout because
Melissa and her black friend,
Rufus, were sitting next to each
other at a party holding
hands," Glasberg said. "A lot
of kids were doing the same,
sitting in a circle of alternating
boys and girls."
When the Fielders contacted
the NAACP, Glasberg said, the
school principal retaliated by
expelling Melissa's 11-year-old
sister.
"She had nothing to do with
it," Glasberg said. "This is just
plain racism and if this case
reaches the Supreme Court it
could mean a monumental de
cision."
The case is now being ap
pealed to the U.S. 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals after a lower
court judge ruled against the
Fiedlers and in favor of the
school.
Discrimination against bira
cial relationships cuts across
regional lines.
"It's certainly an ongoing
problem," said Richard Larson
of the New York City chapter of
the American Civil Liberties
Unions (ACLU). "I'm a white
man and a number of my col
leagues are black women.
When we socialize we experi
ence covert discrimination —
you know, looks of disgust, ra
cial slurs. It's a reality."
The 1968 Fair Housing Act
barring discrimination in hous

ing sales and rentals, which
was recently toughened by
Congress, has given minorities
entrance to once segregated
communities.
Vet, according to the ACLU
and fair housing boards across
the nation, discrimination
against biracial couples seek
ing housing still exists. A Los
Angeles Times canvass of 10
major U.S. cities determined
that a majority of the com
plaints filed by biracial couples
were housing related.
Beth Kraweicki and her
latino boyfriend, Joe Villa,
found that problems with their
biracial relationship mounted
when they were searching for
an apartment for him in Mil
waukee.
"I wasn't going to live with
him," she said. "He was going
to live with his daughter and
his mother. People on Mil
waukee's South side are clan
nish and Polish like myself —
and some of them are very
biased and bigoted.'
Although the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop
ment doesn't keep figures on
biracial complaints, spokeman
Alan Gasparage said that the
department does receive let
ters complaining of a refusal to
rent or sell housing to biracial
couples.

The 1968 Fair Housing Act

Vet, according to the ACLU
and fair housing boards across
the nation, discrimination

major U.S. cities determined
that a majority of the com
plaints filed by biracial couples
were housing related.
Beth Kraweicki and her
latino boyfriend, Joe Villa,
found that problems with their
biracial relationship mounted
when they were searching for
an apartment for him in Mil
waukee.
"I wasn't going to live with
him," she said. "He was going
to live with his daughter and
his mother. People on Mil
waukee's South side are clan
nish and Polish like myself —
and some of them are very
biased and bigoted.'
Although the Department of
Housing and Urban Develop

biracial complaints, spokeman
Alan Gasparage said that the
department does receive let
ters complaining of a refusal to
rent or sell housing to biracial
couples.
Washington — On June ffe,
Arthur Smothers, 22, and Kath
leen Mikula, 16, were taking a
noontime stroll in downtown
Johnstown, Pa., when they
were shot and killed by a
sniper. Police still are search
ing for a truck driver who re
portedly bragged about shoot
ing them.
Melissa Fiedler and Rufus
Bosticks, both 13, who have
been friends since early child
hood, were seen holding
hands at a Christmas party at
their private church school in
Woodbridge, Va. Melissa was
expelled from her school and
the family ostracized in the
community.
In Milwaukee, Beth
Kraweicki, 24, and her boy
friend, Joe Villa, 28, said they
had little trouble finding
apartments over the tele
phone. But when they ap
peared together to view the
dwellings, they said, landlords
repeatedly refused to rent to
them, even though they didn't
plan to live together.
These three couples in
widely separated parts of the
United States had one thing in
common — they were biracial.
Discrimination against bira
cial couples has subsided in re
cent years, according to Rev.
Tyronne Pitts, racial justice di
rector for the National Council
of Churches, but still is "a real
threat to the civil rights of indi
viduals."
"It is part of the white domi
nation theory that has been
prevalent historically," Pitts
said.
The clergyman cited what he
called a "milder form of vio
lence — it happens when
people choose to mix outside
their race and sometimes have
to give up family ties, then
there's always the crisis the
children of mixed couples
face."
Statistics on violence against
mixed couples are rare, and
one reason cited by Dr. James
Otis Smith, chairman of the
sociology department at the
University of Wisconsin, Mil
waukee, is that such couples
are reluctant to report attacks
on them to authorities.
"Most biracial couples are
reluctant to speak out in fear of
retaliation," Smith said. "They
worry about harassment on the
job and from the community

they live in."
However, Smith, a white
who is married to a latino, said
he believes that society has
moderated its views toward bi
racial couples.
"There is an initial shock, but
it tends to mellow," he said.
"Most people in a given com
munity tend to whitewash it in
their own way."
Not everyone in Wood
bridge, Va., where the hand
holding incident of Melissa
Fiedler and Rufus Bosticks is
still an issue, would agree.
For one thing, Alec Lee Bled
soe, principal of the Marumsco
Baptist Church school and pas
tor of the parent congregation,
has ruled that interracial
romantic relations are against
the tenets of the church.
In addition, Vic Clasberg, an
attorney representing the Fie
dler family in a suit against the
school, said that the family was
driven from its neighborhood
by threats and other incidents.
"This all cameabout because
Melissa and her black friend,
Rufus, were sitting next to each
other at a party holding
hands," Glasberg said. "A lot
of kids were doing the same,
sitting in a circle of alternating
boys and girls."
When the Fielders contacted
the NAACP, Glasberg said, the
school principal retaliated by
expelling Melissa's 11-year-old
sister.
"She had nothing to do with
it," Glasberg said. "This is just
plain racism and if this case
reaches the Supreme Court it
could mean a monumental de
cision."
The case is now being ap
pealed to the U.S. 4th Circuit
Court of Appeals after a lower
court judge ruled against the
Fiedlers and in favor of the
school.
Discrimination against bira
cial relationships cuts across
regional lines.

problem," said Richard Larson
