# High school thesis becomes book
## 
### Cici Oremland 
At the height of this pres
idential election year, Stan
ford junior Peter Pierce has
published a biography of
the Republican presidential
nominee Ronald Reagan.
The book, The Presiden
tial journey of Ronald Wil
son Reagan: A Young Man's
Perspective, began as a high
school academic thesis in
1976. The assignment was to
profile one individual who
had had a positive impact on
society.
With a deadline exten
sion, the paper was finally
finished before Pierce's
graduation in 1978. The pro
ject, which had become a
major undertaking, took 18
months to complete.
Pierce was able to inter
view Reagan in the candi
date's Pacific Palisades, Ca.,
home for 90 minutes in
1977.
"That was pretty exciting
. . . I don't think I'll ever
forget it,"he said. Pierce
became deeply involved in
his research project, and his
manuscript turned into a
work of over 100 pages.
"I sent a copy of it to Mr.
Reagan. He edited it and
approved it," said Pierce.
Then, while waiting for
news of a job at Reagan
headquarters this past
summer, Pierce updated

the book. Scholl Publishing
Company, a Southern
California operation, a
greed to publish the book,
which still totals over 100
print pages.
It was not until this tall
that Pierce got a job actively
campaigning for Reagan
and George Bush, Reagan's
running mate. Pierce has
stopped out of school this
quarter and is currently the
state youth coordinator for
Orange, San Bernardino
and Riverside counties.
Pierce said he was drawn
to the Reagan ticket by the
record of the former
California governor and by
his personal integrity. He
said Reagan balanced the
California state budget, was
an efficient administrator
and maintained important
state programs during his
term in office.
"He's not the reactionary
he's always painted to be â€”
and there is no better
domestic training ground
(for the presidency) than
the governorships of
California and New York;
those states are like mini
countries themselves," said
Pierce.
Pierce himself said he has
political leanings. He is an
international relations
major who aspires to work
in the State Department.
