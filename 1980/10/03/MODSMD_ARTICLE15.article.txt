## Registration crucial 
### 
Registering to vote may not seem like
a major issue.
In fact, it one were to choose a topic
that most people would agree on, an
issue that is fundamental to the nation's
political system, it would probably be
each citizen's inalienable right to vote.
Vet in a year of overwhelming political
campaign rhetoric, amid a general feel
ing of only minimal control over issues
like inflation and energy, it becomes
easy to forget to register, to assume that
voting doesn't really matter.
But it does.
Whether you want to change things or
keep them the same, whether you vote
for the president of the country or funds
for a local park, you are making a state
ment. You are becoming active instead
of passive, taking control instead of let
ting events take control of you.
By taking a few minutes to fill out the

postcard with your name, address and
party preference before the deadline
Monday, you are making it possible to
participate. Registration tables are set
up at various points around campus to
make the process even easier.
Voting doesn't guarantee that gov
ernment will become more responsive
to your needs. Nor does it mean that an
issue which is important to you will be
important to others.
But to use these as excuses for not
voting is, in effect, to resign yourself to
the idea that you don't make a differ
ence. And if you believe that, then you
probably never will make a difference.
By registering to vote and then actu
ally voting, you can start to have an ef
fect. The more elected officials see that
people are concerned, the more they
will have to become more responsive to
voter issues. And then you can make a
difference.
