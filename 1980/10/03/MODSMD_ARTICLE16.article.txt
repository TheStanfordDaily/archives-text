# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Barbara Honegger Have our justices forgotten us?

The hostages are home, in
the United States.They are the
50 states ot the union, whose
rights have been systematically
eroded by decisions ot the
Supreme Court. These areyour
rights, and you ought to know
about them.
The most timely example ot
the erosion ot states' rights
through unconstitutional deci
sions of the Supreme Court is
the dratt. In all the arguments
about whether the president
should or shouldn't conscript
young people, no one bothers
to mention the detail that the
direct draft that's being talked
about is unconstitutional.
That's right. The draft is un
constitutional. The bare tact is
that the Constitution empow
ers the federal government to
raise and support an army by
calling on the highest authority
of the several states, the gov
ernors, to authorize their state
militiamen (now National

Guard units) in case ot a na
tional emergency. It the gov
ernor says no, the Constitution
makes it clear that any man
then part ot his state's military
doesn't budge.
This, of course, is above and
beyond the fact that the Con
stitution clearly intends that
the president's power to ask
governors for their state
militiamen be restricted to the
case ot declared war, making
the peacetime conscription
that just ended in 1973 flag
rantly unconstitutional.
This states-as-intermediaries
mechanism for creating a na
tional force was designed by
the t'ramers of our Constitution
with the clear intent of check
ing arbitrary federal authority.
They had just come out the
other side ot a life and death
struggle with centralized au
thority and knew what they
were doing. Our justices seem

to have forgotten.
In its 1918 decision uphold
ing the Conscription Act ot
1917, the high court again ig
nored the Constitution and
states' rights. To support that
decision, it had to cite histori
cal instead of constitutional ar
guments and argue that the
14th Amendment provides tor
precedence of federal over
state citizenship, which it ex
presssly does not. The framers
of the Constitution went out ot
their way to stipulate explicit
controls on the power of the
federal government to usurp
states', and thereby citizens',
rights. This was particularly
true tor personal freedoms.
Because the Constitution
does allow for a direct draft of
male citizens not actively par
ticipating in one of the state
militias at the time of a call,
there is an obvious way anyone
interested today in avoiding

the draft can do that legally.
That is to join your state's Na
tional Guard, the equivalent
today of the Constitution's
"state militias," and convince
your governor, or better your
state legislature through state
law, to keep the Guard at
home, where it belongs, even
in case of a national emergency
or declared war.
If you are still drafted, you
can refuse to go and take your
case to court arguing uncon
stitutionality. Vou may at first
lose, but in the process, espe
cially if enough of you do it,
you will clean up the system
not irrevocably destroyed by
the Supreme Court.
