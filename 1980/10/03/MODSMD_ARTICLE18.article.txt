Mascot alternative
I can't understand how an
institution insisting it has a
superior degree of intellect
among its inhabitants can be so
stupid in selecting an athletic
mascot. Every suggestion I've
heard — Cardinals, Trees, In
dians, Robber Barons — causes
some segment of the popula
tion to take offense. Why not
select something most people
agree on and minimize the
campus discord?
Give the unofficial symbol of
Stanford University official
status at last — The Stanford
'Gators. The only opposition I
can see would come from the

Bookstore regarding the de
crease in sales of Stanford ap
parel, since everybody already
owns a full wardrobe of the
Stanford Gator.

Groups singled out
Dean Hammerton-Kelly's
letter regarding the lack of
mention of religious activities
in your Orientation Issue
seems somewhat mean
spirited. A simple statement of
disappointment at being neg
lected by the Daily is quite ac
ceptable, and I personally
share that disappointment.

Hammerton-Kelly, however, in
his fear of "conspiracy" ap
proaches a slur of ethnic
groups and the CPU. Why is it
necessary to single out those
groups as the objects of the
Daily staff's "alertness" when
in fact the Orientation Issue
covers many groups, issues,
and activities?
The attitude expressed in
Hammerton-Kelly's letteris not
orve that welcomes ethnic
groups or the GPU or others,
and Mem Chu may find itself
relying on paid ads for quite
awhile.
