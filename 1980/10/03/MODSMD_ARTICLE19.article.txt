## Make concessions in November 
### 
It's especially frustrating to
novice voters that the presi
dential prospects this
November seem so bleak. To
those politically conscious
students, like myselt, who
otten feel thwarted that there
seems no worthy cause over
which to unleash our political
energies, the choice, at first in
spection, seems hardly worth
making. Though we earnestly
want to exercise our hallowed
right to vote, we see no real
choice or course ot action av
ailable to further our political
aims.
Vet being a resourceful pat
riot, and avif) Democrat, I have
finally resolved to my own
satisfaction the presidential di
lemma; that is, I have recog
nized a satisfactory rationale
for voting.

Considering only the best in
terests of the Democratic
Party, I sought to give my sup
port to the candidate who
would become the most inf
luential tigure tor implement
ing our ideals. While, of the
options, Carter may seem the
most essentially Democratic, I
question whether his presi
dency would most effectively
promote our party's interests.
Instead, it seems to me, that
viewing the situation in a
broader historical sense and
being willing to re-evaluate our
strategy, we can perhaps make
the most long-term progress
by submitting to some tempor
ary concessions. If we can see
beyond the fleeting security of
a potentially Pyrrhic victory this
November, the choice comes
to this: Do we, the Democratic
party, really want to take credit
for the next four years? Or do
we want to pass the buck?
I don't mean to be pessimis
tic, but why not just blow it off?
Vote Reagan and just consider
it a strategic retreat. Let's put
the Republicans on the defen
sive for a while.
We shouldn't forget the
example set by Stanford's own
Herbert Hoover, who we have
to thank for delivering us with

twenty crucial and progressive
years of Democratic reign. The
coming years could be | list as
pivotal as a result of growing
international and domestic
strife, wherein even greater
inroads into democratic ideals
might be made and it is impor
tant that America not be disil
lusioned any more than neces
sary.
Why should we democrats
take the rap for this whole
mess anyhow? Only by submit
ting to a Reagan presidency can
we make discontent and unrest
exist in our best interests. Infla
tion, the energy crisis, and Iran
can actually work for us as the
media scathingly scrutinizes
presidential policy.
Let the press have a crack at
Reagan, that's what I say. It's
one thing for some progressive
journalists to scoff at his die
hard platform and campaign
tact(less)ics, but quite another
to hold his integrity, leader
ship, and judgment, as well as
family life and hometown up
for scrutiny before the public
eye, as is customary once he
becomes president.
I say these next tour years
could be very formative, unify
ing, as more Americans come
to realize what they don't want.
Perhaps in this time new lead

ers may emerge to refresh and
tlic party. As long as
they remember not to vacation
in Africa with rock stars and
keep in the good graces of cer
tain brilliant but savage car
toonists, some promising fi
gures could appear in time tor
the H4 campaign.
Meanwhile, it all goes well,
and nothing goes well,
Reagan's blunders in office
could effectively curtail the en
tire neo-rightist movement in
this country. On the other
hand, anything is possible.
Anderson, for instance, hav
ing alienated both parties and
providing he tails to comman
deer the majority of voters this
time around, may tound and
head a new "independent"
party, for those who fancy
themselves as "independent."
It's time we Democrats take
time to recover, reorganize
and condemn. If we're
really convinced Reagan will
make a worse president than
Carter, we've only this one
chance to prove it. Then, it
things actually get better over
the next four years, well
. . .what will we have to
complain about. And it they get
worse, at least we can gloat.

the Republicans on the defen
sive for a while.
We shouldn't forget the
example set by Stanford's own
Herbert Hoover, who we have
to thank for delivering us with

twenty crucial and progressive
years of Democratic reign. The
coming years could be | list as
pivotal as a result of growing
international and domestic
strife, wherein even greater
inroads into democratic ideals
might be made and it is impor
tant that America not be disil
lusioned any more than neces
sary.
Why should we democrats
take the rap for this whole
mess anyhow? Only by submit
ting to a Reagan presidency can
we make discontent and unrest
exist in our best interests. Infla
tion, the energy crisis, and Iran
can actually work for us as the
media scathingly scrutinizes
presidential policy.
Let the press have a crack at
Reagan, that's what I say. It's
one thing for some progressive
journalists to scoff at his die
hard platform and campaign
tact(less)ics, but quite another
to hold his integrity, leader
ship, and judgment, as well as
family life and hometown up
for scrutiny before the public
eye, as is customary once he
becomes president.
I say these next tour years
could be very formative, unify
ing, as more Americans come
to realize what they don't want.
Perhaps in this time new lead

ers may emerge to refresh and
tlic party. As long as
they remember not to vacation
in Africa with rock stars and
keep in the good graces of cer
tain brilliant but savage car
toonists, some promising fi
gures could appear in time tor
the H4 campaign.
Meanwhile, it all goes well,
and nothing goes well,
Reagan's blunders in office
could effectively curtail the en
tire neo-rightist movement in
this country. On the other
hand, anything is possible.
Anderson, for instance, hav
ing alienated both parties and
providing he tails to comman
deer the majority of voters this
time around, may tound and
head a new "independent"
party, for those who fancy
themselves as "independent."
It's time we Democrats take
time to recover, reorganize
and condemn. If we're
really convinced Reagan will
make a worse president than
Carter, we've only this one
chance to prove it. Then, it
things actually get better over
the next four years, well
. . .what will we have to
complain about. And it they get
worse, at least we can gloat.

It's especially frustrating to
novice voters that the presi
dential prospects this
November seem so bleak. To
those politically conscious
students, like myselt, who
otten feel thwarted that there
seems no worthy cause over
which to unleash our political
energies, the choice, at first in
spection, seems hardly worth
making. Though we earnestly
want to exercise our hallowed
right to vote, we see no real
choice or course ot action av
ailable to further our political
aims.
Vet being a resourceful pat
riot, and avif) Democrat, I have
finally resolved to my own
satisfaction the presidential di
lemma; that is, I have recog
nized a satisfactory rationale
for voting.

Considering only the best in
terests of the Democratic
Party, I sought to give my sup
port to the candidate who
would become the most inf
luential tigure tor implement
ing our ideals. While, of the
options, Carter may seem the
most essentially Democratic, I
question whether his presi
dency would most effectively
promote our party's interests.
Instead, it seems to me, that
viewing the situation in a
broader historical sense and
being willing to re-evaluate our
strategy, we can perhaps make
the most long-term progress
by submitting to some tempor
ary concessions. If we can see
beyond the fleeting security of
a potentially Pyrrhic victory this
November, the choice comes
to this: Do we, the Democratic
party, really want to take credit
for the next four years? Or do
we want to pass the buck?
I don't mean to be pessimis
tic, but why not just blow it off?
Vote Reagan and just consider
it a strategic retreat. Let's put
the Republicans on the defen
sive for a while.
