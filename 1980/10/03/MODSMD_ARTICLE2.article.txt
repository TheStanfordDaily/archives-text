# Iranians slow Iraqi advance; begin drive to retake border
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut, Lebanon — Iran and Iraq
appeared yesterday to be heading for
a climactic battle that would decide
the fate of the port city of Khorram
shahr and the huge retinery complex
at Abadan.
The Iraqi army was reported to be
moving up troops for what its officers
said would be the final assault on the
city, just across the border from Iraq,
that has been holding out since the
war began 11 days ago.
In a speech broadcast to the na
tion, Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr declared, "The heroic
struggle goes on. Inhabitants of the
Khuzistan : the time has come for you
to take part in an heroic battle
through general mobilization and
general participation in order to pro
tect your honor and your religion."
The Iranian president added that
the air force and paratroops had
been moved to support the defen
ders of Khorramshahr.
Bani-Sadr said "enemy-crushing"

operations were underway in the
city, and a Khorramshahr radio sta
tion warned residents to stay off the
streets and spend the night in
trenches. "The murderous
executioners may keep shelling
Khorramshahr throughout the night
to avenge their defeat today," the
broadcast said, adding that residents
"should capture all Iraqis who are
wandering in all corners of the city."
Bani-Sadr also claimed that Iranian
troops routed Iraqi forces from
Susangerd, 10() miles to the north,
and that the Iraqis were in retreat
toward the border. Iran claimed it
captured 150 Iraqi tanks and armored
personnel carriers and "large num
bers of Iraqi soldiers."
If the Iranian claim to have recap
tured Susangerd is true, it would in
dicate that Iranian forces have driven
a wedge into the middle of Iraq's ad
vance that penetrated up to 50 miles
along the front.
On its side, Baghdad said yester
day that its troops were engaged in a
fresh assault against the Revolutio
nary Guard defenders of Khorram
shahr.
An official announcement de
clared: "Savage battles are raging
from house to house and street to
street to complete the liberation of
Khorramshahr."
The Baghdad high command also
said its troops were about to capture
Dezful, a key communications
center about 50 miles east of the bor
der in northern Khuzistan.
The Iraqis said that Iranian planes
had again bombed the port cities of
Basra and Um Qasr in the south, and
the oil-producing center of Kirkuk in
the north, but that the defenders had
shot down two planes.
There is no front, rather a series of
incursions punched into Iran with
wide territorial gaps separating
them. There are no accurate figures
on how many troops are involved on
either side.
In the crucial southern theater
where Iran has major oil facilities, the
Khuzistan province cities of Ahwaz,
Khorramshahr and Abadan have
stubbornly refused to give way to the
Iraqi onslaught.
Iraq claims to have entered parts of
Ahwaz, capital of Khuzistan, but no
journalist has been able to travel
closer than 15 miles from the city and
army officers acknowledge they still

are meeting stiff resistance to the
south.
Although Iraq has seized hundreds
of square miles of Iranian territory, it
has failed to capture any major city or
achieve any decisive victory at its var
ious points of incursion.
At sea, observers reported
stepped-up activity around the
Iranian-held islands of Abu Musa,
and the Greater and lesser Tunbs,
near the mouth of the Persian Cult.
An Iranian warship was reported to
be circling the islands, while helicop
ter flights were observed on the is
land.
Iraq as part of its goals in the war
has demanded that the islands —
which were occupied by Iran in 1971
