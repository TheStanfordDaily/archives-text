## Etiquette for the freshman 
### 
So now you're at Stanford.
You've unpacked, and your
phone finally works. And that's
good. Nowit'stimetolearnthe
basic rules for survival here at
the farm, or become the butt of
a vicious "frosh" joke like this
one:
Fifteen-hundred freshmen
walk into the.Oasis for a beer.
The bartender says, "O.K. you,
let's see some identification."
As the freshmen start digging
into their wallets and handbags
for their driver's licences, the
bartender says "Say, we don't
often get 1500 freshmen in
here." And the freshmen say,
"With a 21-year-old drinking
age, you're not likely to get
many more."
Don't be a fool at school.
Stay cool, and follow these
rules:
1. Declare as many majors as
you can, as fast as you can.
There's nothing a professor
likes more than to give special
grading consideration to a stu
dent in his own department.
Extra points for getting your
professor as an advisor.
2. If you're looking for The
Bridge, don't go to the lake.
And if you're looking for the
lake, don't go to the lake.
3. Don't pay your tuition —
save it. In four years, you'll
have enough money to buy a
Ferrari — and isn't that why
you're at school in the first
place?
4. If you want to find out
where you stand on the Stan
ford ladder, remember that
you were assigned to your
freshman dorm according to
your SAT scores. If you live in
Branner, don't forget to put it
on your resume. Scores de
cline across campus, and resi
dents of Paloma should note
that the only reason they are
here is because 59 people de
cided at the last minute that
they wanted to go to a real Ivy
League school, and one Pakis
tani had visa problems.
5. Yes: Psych 1, Beginning
Posture, Effective Reading 006,
the Communication Depart
ment.
No: Intermediate Swahili
191, Probalistic Analysis 221,
Stochastic Processes In
Aeronautics 225, Wave Propa

gation in The lonosphere 352,
Deutsche Geistesgeschichte I.
Don't be fooled: Basic Elec
tronics, Simple Set Theory,
Physics for Poets.
6. Don't yodel in the library.
It ju'st makes things worse.
7. In your first letter home,
tell your folks that Linus Paul
ing teaches here. It doesn't
matter that you'll never see
him, or take a chemistry
course, or know where Seely
G. Mudd is, or even that Linus
Pauling really doesn't teach
here. It gives them something
to throw around at cocktail par
ties, and it gives you filler for
the letter whose sole purpose
is to ask for an advance on next
year's tuition.
8. Behind the smilmg face of
your R.A. lurks the reason for
his confinement in a single

room.
9. It you must buy cocaine
trom a professor, make' sure
he's in liberal arts. You don't
know what goes on in those
science labs, and (he business
professors cut it so many times
that it's worthless.
10. There are two guidelines
to follow when buying clothes,
a) Don't buy "Stanford is for
Lovers" T-shirts at the Stan
ford bookstore. They're at least
two dollars cheaper
everywhere else, b) Don't buy
"Stanford is for Lovers"
T-shirts.
11. Don't wonder aloud.
And tor God's sake, always
carry an extra pen.
