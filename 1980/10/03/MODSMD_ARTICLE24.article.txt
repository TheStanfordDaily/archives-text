## Attacks growing more shrill, angry Anderson steps up pressure on Carter 
### Los Angeles Times 
Denver — As the election draws nearer, |ohn An
derson's attacks against President Jimmy Carter are
growing more and more bitter, and close Anderson
aides think that he is becoming less and less con
cerned about dashing Carter's chances for re
election.
The independent presidential candidate never
mentions it, but one top aide perceives a visceral
anger welling in Anderson against the president. The
perception seems to be borne out by the increasing
frequency and escalating severity of Anderson s criti
cism.
On Wednesday, Anderson used the words desp
erate," "hysterical" and "undemocratic' to charac
terize Carter's campaign.
The day before, he had called Carter "afraid.
Three days ago, he accused Carter's political handlers
of spreading "a virus that seems to infect people to
the point where they lose what ought to be their
political judgment.
One victim of the disease, Anderson said, is
George Ball, a former undersecretary of state who
had been a chief Anderson adviser on foreign and
economic affairs. Ball defected to Carter last
weekend, saying that he was appalled by the prospect

fhat Republican candidate Ronald Reagan might be
come president.
That could happen, Carter aides fear, if Anderson
siphons enough votes away from the president.
Anderson dismissed Ball with scorn — as a "sum
mer soldier and sunshine patriot."
The Republican congressman from Illinois has not
spared Reagan from his tart tongue, but his accusa
tions against the former California governor have
seemed less acerbic.
Du ring a campaign stop here Wednesday morning,
Anderson indicated why.
He ticked oft Carter's efforts to keep him off the
ballot in a number ot states; attempts by the presi
dent and his campaign chairman, Robert Strauss, to
bar him from nationally televised debates and a Car
ter campaign memo questioning the security and leg
ality of any loans to his campaign — "leaked into print
so bankers would read it."
"I would say," Anderson declared, "that I haven't
had that hostility from the other traditional party can
didate."
Strauss, on the other hand, is trying "to deliver a
fatal blow to my campaign," Anderson said. He cited
the disclosure by Carter's chairman that he is now

running new anti-Anderson radio ads in New York,
Connecticut, New lersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio — and
may run them in California, "it we can scrape up the
money."
The ads suggest that a vote tor Anderson is a vote
tor Reagan.
That issue, which Anderson calls "the spoiler ques
tion," rankles him deeply. Anderson says this ques
tion — whether he can win in his own right and do
more than simply spoil Carter's chances — is his
biggest problem. It angers him when Strauss, or any
one else, brings it up.
Besides resenting what they call Carter's "mean
ness of spirit," Anderson aides say the congressman
also is angered by Carter's campaign technique of
assuming that Anderson does not exist and his cam
paign has no political legitimacy.
Finally, the aides see a combination of anger and
impatience in Anderson's reactions to Carter's "con
tusion and his ineptitude."
Now, these aides think, Anderson regards Reagan
as "kind of an amiable fool — and not so much of a
danger." And they perceive him to be less troubled
now about contributing to Carter's demise.
Even if it means Reagan in the White House?
"That's all it can mean," one aide said.

so bankers would read it."
"I would say," Anderson declared, "that I haven't
had that hostility from the other traditional party can
didate."
Strauss, on the other hand, is trying "to deliver a
fatal blow to my campaign," Anderson said. He cited
the disclosure by Carter's chairman that he is now

running new anti-Anderson radio ads in New York,
Connecticut, New lersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio — and
may run them in California, "it we can scrape up the
money."
The ads suggest that a vote tor Anderson is a vote
tor Reagan.
That issue, which Anderson calls "the spoiler ques
tion," rankles him deeply. Anderson says this ques
tion — whether he can win in his own right and do
more than simply spoil Carter's chances — is his
biggest problem. It angers him when Strauss, or any
one else, brings it up.
Besides resenting what they call Carter's "mean
ness of spirit," Anderson aides say the congressman
also is angered by Carter's campaign technique of
assuming that Anderson does not exist and his cam
paign has no political legitimacy.
Finally, the aides see a combination of anger and
impatience in Anderson's reactions to Carter's "con
tusion and his ineptitude."
Now, these aides think, Anderson regards Reagan
as "kind of an amiable fool — and not so much of a
danger." And they perceive him to be less troubled
now about contributing to Carter's demise.
Even if it means Reagan in the White House?
"That's all it can mean," one aide said.
