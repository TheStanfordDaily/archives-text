# Faculty housing, grading policy also discussed
## Kennedy addresses Faculty Senate meeting

Speeches by new President
Don,ild Kennedy and Acting Provost
Albert Hastorf yesterday highlighted
this year's first meeting of the
Academic Senate.
The senate meeting was chaired by
Nannerl Keohane, associate profes
sor of political science. Keohane is
the first woman in the history of the
senate to hold that responsibility.
The senate also acted to establish a
new Academic Council Committee
on Information Technology and ap
proved a proposed addition to the
End-Quarter Grading Policy.
Kennedy began by confirming that
the University recently purchased
earthquake insurance.
"Everybody seems to agree that in

the next 10 years or so some event
will occur, and we will need financial
protection," he said. The policy will
also provide coverage for death or
injury to employees.
Kennedy commended the more
than-400 returning students who par
ticipated in freshman and transfer
orientation programs last week for
their "extraordinary planning effort
and rather astonishing show of dedi
cation to a community."
Commenting on Pacific-10 Con
ference rulings handed down over
the summer in which five universities
lost their post-season football eligi
bility for this year, Kennedy said the
decisions were appropriate and have
not resulted in a serious split within
the conference.

"If anything, they have probably
strengthened it,"he said.
In his speech, Acting Provost Al
bert Hastort mentioned faculty hous
ing as, "an overwhelmingly signific
ant issue to the campus."
Earlier this year trustees obtained
S2 million in co-investment funding.
They will be asking for an additional
$1 million in the hope of "generating
a different, more helpful program for
the future," said Hastorf.
On another note, Hastorf later re
marked, "This institution expends
considerable energy and is going to
have to expend more in maintaining
its autonomy."
He added the struggle "will be a
mighty one" and has "no magic solu
tions."
The senate voted unanimously to
approve the new Committee on
Computing and Information
Technology proposed by the Com
mittee on Committees. The group
will formulate policy and exercise
general responsibility for the Univer
sity's major computing and informa
tion systems.
Kennedy said this will "prove to be
a more expert device and will make
the computing environment here
better in the long run."
The senate also passed an addition
to the existing policy statement on
the revision of end-quarter grades.
The addition holds that if a student
wishes to submit a piece of work for
regrading, based on the feeling that a
specific part of the work has been
misgraded or overlooked, the pro
fessor has the right to regrade the
entire work and re-evaluate the stu
dent's grade appropriately.
Civil Engineering Professor lames
Gere, chairman of the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (C-AAA), explained it was "the
committee's feeling that an instruc
tor is undertaking a considerable re
sponsibility when grading an exam,
and is not grading piece by piece.
"The instructor should indeed
look at the whole test in fairness to
other members of the class," he said.
C-AAA also proposed a small
change in the Pass Option Policy
Statement. However, the senate
failed to approve the item, sending it
back to the committee for further

consideration.
The present policy statement
holds that students wishing to take
courses on a Pass/No Credit basis
must make arrangements to do so by
a specific date in the quarter, though
an individual instructor may set an
earlier deadline.
For a number of years, the
Mathematics Department as a whole
has set and publicized an earlier
deadline for choosing the Pass/No
Credit option. Gere argued that the
right of a department such as
Mathematics to set the earlier dead
line should be formally added to the
policy, since the right is guaranteed
to individual professors.
Other senate members rejected
the proposedc hange.
Mathematics Prof. Ralph Phillips
addressed the senate concerning
student-teacher evaluation policy.
He proposed the evaluations be dis
continued, saying, "The administra
tion takes them very seriously â€”
which leads to disturbing consequ
ences."
