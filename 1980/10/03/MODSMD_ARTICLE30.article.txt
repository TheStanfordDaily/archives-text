# Bookstore to offer cash rebates
## 
### Lisa Adler 
Did you save your receipts for the books
which you no doubt just purchased at the
Stanford Bookstore? If they are not in one
of the rebate envelopes available from
bookstore cashiers, it might prove wise
and even lucrative to search through
messy desks and trash cans to locate them.
According to Eldon Speed, general
manager of the Stanford Bookstore, a re
bate offer is available on all books —
textbooks and paperbacks included —
purchased between Sept. I,l9Boand April
30, 1981.
Instructions on the rebate envelopes
explain the rebates will be available after
May 18, 1981, and will be in cash or as a
merchandise voucher, depending on the
consumer's preference.
The exact amount or percentage of book
purchases which ultimately will be re
funded, explained Speed, will depend on
the profitability of the bookstore. "Actu
ally, the more people buy, the more they'll
receive in the end," he said.
According to Jack Friedenthal, law
school professor and president of the
board of directors at the Stanford
Bookstore, one-fourth of the surplus left

over at the end of the bookstore's fiscal
year will be allocated to an employee per
capita profit-sharing fund, and the other
three-fourths will be set aside tor the re
bate.
"All monies going back to the commun
ity will be based on a percentage of a per
son's book purchases for the year," Speed
noted.
Speed predicted the rebates will be
somewhere in the vicinity of five to 10 per
cent of book purchases. Friedenthal con
curred, pinpointing a target figure of
around eight percent.
The board of directors of the bookstore
will meet in the spring and determine the
percentage.
The Stanford Bookstore is, according to
Friedenthal, a "service organization"
which exists solely for the benefit of the
Stanford community.
"Since the bookstore is a non-profit
corporation with no vested interest," con
tinued Speed, "its profits are either re
tained for the development of the store or
distributed to the community."
Peter Stansky, history professor and vice
president of the bookstore's board of di
rectors, said that the rebate was reinsti

tuted last spring by the bookstore's
seven-member board of directors.
A rebate offer is not an innovation to the
bookstore. Originally, there used to be
some type of rebate ranging from tax
exemption to monies based on percen
tages of purchases.
The rebate was terminated in the early
1970s in order to accurpmulate funds for a
$3 million bookstore expansion, said
Speed. The project was completed in 1979.
Because the bookstore is still paying off
loans used to build the rear half of the
store, surpluses accrued during the last
few years have been channeled into ex
pansion projects. Speed estimated last
year's surplus was between $300,000 to
$400,000.
"The problems with giving a rebate
emanate from the basic question: where
and on what should the rebates be given?"
explained Friedenthal. "We (the board of
directors of the bookstore) debated the
question for a long time; finally, we opted
for all books."
"This rebate plan will affect nearly every
member of the Stanford community —
students, faculty and staff members in
cluded," Speed said.
