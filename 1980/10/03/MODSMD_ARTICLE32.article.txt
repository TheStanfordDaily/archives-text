## The 						legend ends: Holmes beats Ali 
### 
Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) — Larry
Holmes ruined Muhammad
Ali's bid tor a fourth
heavyweight championship
when he battered Ali into sub
mission atter 10 rounds last
night at the Caesars Palace
sports arena.
It was a mismatch.
The end came with Ali sitting
on his stool between the 10th
and 11th rounds after Holmes
had battered him detenseless
in the ninth and 10th.
Cornerman Angelo Dundee
signalled to reteree Richard
Green that Ali had had enough,
although some ot Ali's cor
nermen seemed to want the
tight to continue.
Dundee told the reteree:
"The ballgame is over. I'm the
chief second and I'm stopping
the tight."
lose Sulaiman, the VVBC
'president, said the tight would
go into the books as an 11th
round knockout.
The action gave Holmes his
eighth consecutive knockout
in defense ot the World Boxing
Council title.
Ali had said in the days lead
ing up to the tight that he was
going to be a miracle worker,

but on this night, he was just a
38-year-old man whose skills
were memories.
The former three-time
champion, who had retired in
June of 1979, also had said be
fore the tight that he was a
"master of illusion." Once the
bell rang, Holmes stripped that
illusion away.
Ali had performed what he
said was his first miracle by get
ting his weight down from the
250s to 217 Vi, but he could not
bring back his magic or flash
ing skills that had made him
one of the great and most excit
ing pertormers in any sport for
many years.
In the ninth round, Holmes,
who remained unbeaten with
his 36th victory, had Ali wobbl
ing along the ropes with seven
head punches. It seemed Ali
might fall, but his lion heart
that had carried him through
so many battles, kept him up.
Holmes shook Ali with three
more head punches, then
landed four or five more to the
almost defenseless former
champion. Before the round
ended, Holmes had landed
four or five rights to the head in
a neutral corner, then battered
Ali at will in Ali's corner.
Ali didn't throw a legitimate
punch in the ninth round, and
he didn't in the 10th either, as
Holmes shook him with a right
cross, followed by a right up
percut. Before the round was
out, he pinned Ali in his corner
and hit him with five jabs, mis
sed a right, and then hit him
with seven more jabs and a
left-right to the head.
It was sad to watch the end to
what had been a legendary
career. Ali earned $8 million
plus a percentage of the ancil
lary revenue and, on this night
in 89-degree heat, he earned
every penny of it. It turned out
to be one of the easiest fights in
the career of Holmes, who
weighed 211'j, and it got the
Ali monkey off the Easton, Pa.,
fighter's back.
Holmes, who helped Ali
prepare for many title bouts in
the early 1970s as a sparring
partner, has lived in Ali's
shadow tor several years. Ali
fans called him a phony champ
ion because he had never

beaten his one-time master in
the ring.
Ali himself said that Holmes
had beaten him several times
in the gym, but it would be a
ditterent story when money
and glory were on the line. It
wasn't. It was pathetic.
Atter the right was stopped,
Ali sat tor several minutes on

his stool. his tace badly marked
below both eyes and those
eyes glazed — as it in a dream,
a bad dream.
•Mi was able to leave the ring
and walk away under his own
power. And he almost certainly
walked into permanent retire
ment.

in the gym, but it would be a
ditterent story when money
and glory were on the line. It
wasn't. It was pathetic.
Atter the right was stopped,
Ali sat tor several minutes on

his stool. his tace badly marked

eyes glazed — as it in a dream,

Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) — Larry
Holmes ruined Muhammad
Ali's bid tor a fourth
heavyweight championship
when he battered Ali into sub
mission atter 10 rounds last
night at the Caesars Palace
sports arena.
It was a mismatch.
The end came with Ali sitting
on his stool between the 10th
and 11th rounds after Holmes
had battered him detenseless
in the ninth and 10th.
Cornerman Angelo Dundee
signalled to reteree Richard
Green that Ali had had enough,
although some ot Ali's cor
nermen seemed to want the
tight to continue.
Dundee told the reteree:
"The ballgame is over. I'm the
chief second and I'm stopping
the tight."
lose Sulaiman, the VVBC
'president, said the tight would
go into the books as an 11th
round knockout.
The action gave Holmes his
eighth consecutive knockout
in defense ot the World Boxing
Council title.
Ali had said in the days lead
ing up to the tight that he was
going to be a miracle worker,

but on this night, he was just a
38-year-old man whose skills
were memories.
The former three-time
champion, who had retired in
June of 1979, also had said be
fore the tight that he was a
"master of illusion." Once the
bell rang, Holmes stripped that
illusion away.
Ali had performed what he
said was his first miracle by get
ting his weight down from the
250s to 217 Vi, but he could not
bring back his magic or flash
ing skills that had made him
one of the great and most excit
ing pertormers in any sport for
many years.
In the ninth round, Holmes,
who remained unbeaten with
his 36th victory, had Ali wobbl
ing along the ropes with seven
head punches. It seemed Ali
might fall, but his lion heart
that had carried him through
so many battles, kept him up.
Holmes shook Ali with three
more head punches, then
landed four or five more to the
almost defenseless former
champion. Before the round
ended, Holmes had landed
four or five rights to the head in
a neutral corner, then battered
Ali at will in Ali's corner.
Ali didn't throw a legitimate
punch in the ninth round, and
he didn't in the 10th either, as
Holmes shook him with a right
cross, followed by a right up
percut. Before the round was
out, he pinned Ali in his corner
and hit him with five jabs, mis
sed a right, and then hit him
with seven more jabs and a
left-right to the head.
It was sad to watch the end to
what had been a legendary
career. Ali earned $8 million
plus a percentage of the ancil
lary revenue and, on this night
in 89-degree heat, he earned
every penny of it. It turned out
to be one of the easiest fights in
the career of Holmes, who
weighed 211'j, and it got the
Ali monkey off the Easton, Pa.,
fighter's back.
Holmes, who helped Ali
prepare for many title bouts in
the early 1970s as a sparring
partner, has lived in Ali's
shadow tor several years. Ali
fans called him a phony champ
ion because he had never

beaten his one-time master in
the ring.
Ali himself said that Holmes
had beaten him several times
in the gym, but it would be a
ditterent story when money
and glory were on the line. It
wasn't. It was pathetic.

Ali sat tor several minutes on
