## The
						legend ends: Holmes beats Ali 
### 
Las Vegas, Nev. (AP) â€” Larry
Holmes ruined Muhammad
Ali's bid tor a fourth
heavyweight championship
when he battered Ali into sub
mission atter 10 rounds last
night at the Caesars Palace
sports arena.
It was a mismatch.
The end came with Ali sitting
