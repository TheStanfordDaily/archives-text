# The 						Friday Interview
## Andre Tyler: Stanford's best-kept secret 
### 
(Editors note - Andre Tyler is
one ot the best receivers in col
lege football today. He proved
it last week against Oklahoma
when he snagged six passes for
78 yards and two touchdowns.
Many regard ken Margerum as
the best. Both came to Stanford
three years ago and have since
combined to form an NCAA re
ceiving tandem rivalling the
Pittsburgh Steelers Lynn
Swann and lohn Stallworth in
the pros. And. not unlike their
counterparts in Pittsburgh, one
recener in the Stanford duo
catches most of the accolades.
It isn't Tyler. In this Friday In
terview with Mike Oneal. Tyler
talks about playing second fid
dle behind All-America
Margerum and gi\ es his impre
ssions of the 1980 Cardinal
campaign thus far.)
Daily: You Ve played at Stan
ford since you were a
freshman. You ended up as
one ot the best recen ers in col
lege football last season.
You re leading the league so far
this year and vou were a major
factor in the victory over Ok
lahoma. But still it seems
you're walking in Ken
Margerum's shadow. Why?
Tvler: First ot all it's not a prob
lem — I don't look at it like
that. But kennv got oft to a fast
start. We both came here at the
same time and he was ready to
play about a year earlier than I
was. His sophomore year I
think was his best year so tar.
He got off to a good start and
that's where it started. Last year
was the first year that I really
started to come around.
Right now I still would prob
ably have to say that Kenny is
the best receiver on the team. I
have opportunities tocatch the
ball and when those oppor
tunities come I try to make the
best of them. But I've seen

Kenny do some outrageous
things. Right now he's having
some trouble because of dou
ble coverage. Everybody
knows who he is. But all the
recognition and credit Kenny
gets, he deserves. I really be
lieve that.
Daily: Do you think you de
serve more?
Tyler: There was a point in time
when I wondered it I was get
ting enough credit or my just
dues and then I looked around
and I see a lot ot other guys on
the offensive line or on the de
tense who are going all out, all
the time and no one really rec
ognizes that. My name comes
up in the paper every now and
then and I can really appreciate
that. Sometimes I line up ac
ross from a guy in practice and I
see he's working hard and play
ing well in games and not get
ting any credit at all. When I
look at it that way, I feel like I'm
getting more than enough.
Daily: Is there any rivalry bet
ween you and Margerum?
Tyler: I played against him in
high school and before I got to
Stanford my coaches said,
"Watch out for this Margerum.
He's supposed to be good." So
when I did get here I didn't
think we'd get along at all be
cause of all the competition.
But he showed me things and
I'd show him things and we
party together and take classes
together. We're just good
friends so there's no rivalry at
all. If he scores a touchdown
I'll be the first one there to
congratulate him and likewise
if I score one. We get along just
fine.
Daily: Does this kind of one
on-one relationship affect your
play at all?
Tvler: It's good to have compet
ition. I mean we do compete.
In practice if he makes a catch,

I try to go out and make one
that's |ust as good. That makes
us push ourselves and it's mak
ing us better.
Competition is what I think
makes the world go around.
Businesses get better when
they c ompete and it's the same
thing with me and Kenny. It's
not a rivalry-type thing, we
compete to get better.
Daily: How much does having
the fine corps of receivers like

Stanford has going out on each
play help you?
Tyler: I'm only as good as the
next 10 guys on the offense and
a defense definitely can't
watch me as closely when we
have guys like Darrin (Nelson)
and Kenny going out too be
cause both are dangerous.
Without those guys I probably
wouldn't have had as much
success as I've had. I think I'm
definitelyas good as they are —
they make me betterand hope
fully I'm helping them out too.
A defense can't take away ev
erything.

Daily: You 've said that double
teaming i<s a problem lot
Margerum. How olten do you
get double-teamed?
Tyler: The only time I get dou
bled is near the goal-line. I
guess right now, my main in
centive is to get that respect. I
mean when I start getting dou
ble coverage I should actually
be happy.
Daily: How do you evaluate the
peak-and-valley season Stan
ford has had so tart
Tyler: That's really tough. I
could see that in the Oklahoma
game we knew we had nothing
to lose. No one gave us a
chapce in the world. The gen
eral feeling was that I'm gonna
go out and play lull speed
every play because I have no
thing to lose — no one expects
us to win. We telt that it we
made mistakes, at least we
would be making them while
goingall-out. That'stheway we
played against Oklahoma but I
don't think we played that way
against Boston College.
Daily: Why?
Tyler: I hate to say that Boston
College is not the caliber ot
Oklahoma, but it's true. We
didn't have as much respect tor
B.C. as we should have and I
think that was a problem.
That's the problem in those
games — we think we should
win but don't. It's hard to say
how we get keyed tor the big
games but last Saturday, every
thing tell into place.
Daily: Is this year's team better
than last year's?
Tvler: I don t think last year's
record was a very good indi
cator ol the talent we had —we
didn't play up to our potential.
But we have more talent this
year. We have people coming
back with a year's experience
and maybe more talent at each
position and we're stronger at

eat h spot. We're a better team
than last year.
Daily: What's made the differ
ence?
Tyler: Attitude. I hat comes
from coach Paul Wiggin and
the coaching statt. Our whole
attitude is incredible. I mean
right now it's KM) degrees out
and I'm looking lorward to
going to practice — I really am.
I'm just enjoying football
again.
Daily: In what way is Wiggin
helping?
Tyler: 1 here's a relaxed attitude
because everything is struc
tured. Betore practice we
know what we're getting into.
We get the work done but
when he says practice is going
to be over at 5:20, you go hard
and push hard until 5:20 anci
that's it. l ast year we'd be out
there until quarter ot six or 6
and instead ot the practices
getting better, they got worse
and worse. There's no tension
out there this year. It's just tun.
Daily: How does a
defensively-minded Wiggin re
late to the ot tense this year?
Tyler: Well, when they hired
him, I knew they were looking
tor an offensive mind and
when they hired coach Wiggin
I thought 'whoa wait a minute,
is the emphasis gonna
change?' It hasn't. The em
phasis is still offense but
whereas there was never any
emphasis on defense, we have
that now and I think you could
see that last week against Ok
lahoma.
Wiggin knows he doesn't
have the offensive mind and I
guess he could call the plays if
he wanted to but (offensive
coordinator) Denny Green
calls them. He's put his com
plete trust in Denny and Denny
has the offense.
