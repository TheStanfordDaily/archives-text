# Guest Creek Hargadon tries to pick winners
## 
### 
(Editors' note - not only was Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon the Daily's
original guest pigskin prognosticator in
1977, but Hargadon also claims that he in
vented the title of our weekly feature,
"Guest Creek of the Week." Whether this
is true or not, we do know that Dean Har
gadon is No. 1 when it comes to pickin'
'em. Below, the Allah of Admissions joins
the Daily's sports editors in making
choices for this weekend's games involv
ing Pacitic-W Conference teams:)
Egad! The manager of the Daily is obvi
ously trying to outwit everyone by letting
his cleanup hitter lead off. So be it.
Arizona at Iowa: Beating the Cal weenies
is no big deal, as Arizona will find out
when it arrives in lowa City.
Arizona St. at USC: If they don't get run

over by that damn horse on the way into
the Coliseum, Arizona St. will get run over
by the two-legged kind when they meet
USC.
California at Michigan: Cal, untortu
nately, will be the way Bo (Michigan head
coach Schembechler) makes up to 106,000
screaming home fans for the Blues' first
two losses. Glenn Dickey's hatchet job on
Roger Theder will keep Cal high and eager
for a while, but Michigan gets seven points
just for the way they enter the stadium.
UCLA at Ohio St.: This should be a good
game. If the Bruins are smart enough to let
Darrin's little brother play again this week
and if Schlichter has an off day, and given
UCLA is up for its third victory over a Big
Ten team this season, oh hell. . .an upset.
Washington at Oklahoma St.: The gover

nor of Oklahoma informed Oklahoma St.
that if another T"»c-10 (5) team gets any
where near the state border, to cream
them. Won't work: Washington in a fight
one.
UOP at Washington St.: For a lot of
reasons, I would like Grayson Rogers
(Doug's brother) to win this one for UOP,
but Washington St. is bound to have a
greater numljer of top athletes.
San Jose St. at Stanford: Now the big one
— Stanford and San Jose will throw so
many footballs so many times, it will look
like one ot those electronic games. I don't
normally like doing things on a Pass-Fail
basis, but if our defensive secondary con
tinues to go for some interceptions (which
I think they're doing more of this year),
we'll do what we're supposed to do.
