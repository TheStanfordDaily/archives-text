						'fighting spirit' results in victory

The Stanford soccer team may finally have found the "fighting
spirit" that has been lacking thus far this season. After losing four
consecutive games on its recent eastern road trip, the Cards
showed that the humbling experience may have paid off with a
tight 1-0 victory over Westmont College Wednesday.
During a team meeting held immediately prior to the game, it
was generally agreed upon by the players that their problems
have not been the result of lack of talent but a lack of aggressive
ness and an inability to "finish the goal," or in other words, to
score.
Although the only Cardinal goal came on a crossing shot by
Willie Cuicci that was inadvertently tapped in by the Westmont
goalie, the team showed a steadiness that has yet to be seen this
year.
Goal tender Rob Holden felt that the score could have been
much more lopsided. "We, once again, did not capitalize on a lot
of opportunities, but we showed good hustle, good defense, and
we built a good offensive attack," said the sophomore goalie.
"For the first time in a while there were no big lapses in concent
ration or communication."
Holden, like many of the players, felt that the trip east was a
painful, yet valuable experience lesson for the team. "It was a lot
like on-the-job training," said Holden. "We are the only team on
the West Coast to travel to the other coast. It we want to become
nationally ranked, we have to beat those eastern teams," he said.
The East Coast games included, the Cards are 4-5. They are 4-!
against West Coast opponents.
