# San Jose State visits Farm
## Cards try to avoid letdown vs. Spartans 
### Ivan Maisel 
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
would like to warn all those
who feel last week's Jl-M
drubbing of Oklahoma means
the Cardinals are ready to wait/
to the Kose Bowl. The warning
is courtesy of Wiggin s coach
during his playing days at the
Cleveland Browns.
"Paul Brown used to say
when you think you've arrived,
you're in trouble," Wiggin
Swid. In other words, don't buy
those airline tickets to
Pasadena — yet.
Actually, there are plenty of
things this week to keep Stan
ford's feet on the ground after
the ecstasy of their upset of the
Sooners. There is the begin
ning of school. There is the
oppressive swelter and smog
of the summer's last gasp. But
most of all, there is San lose
State.
The 15th-ranked Cards host
the Spartans tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. at Stanford Stadium.
Wiggin said there has been
plenty of guard against a men
tal letdown following last
week's big win.
"I think there might have
been a problem il we had won

two of those in a row," the
coach said. "But having seen
the Boston College game j ust
before 'Stanford lost, 30-15)
every time we get excited
about Oklahoma, Boston pops
up."
Nonetheless, Wiggin
realizes that part ot the poten
tial letdown is inherent in the
aftermath of the upset.
"I've talked to three or four
people and asked them, 'Com
ing off a win like Oklahoma,
what do you do?' " Wiggin
said. "The big thing is to keep it
positive. All you need is some
one saying 'We can't have a
letdown.' That's like a big neon
sign flashing 'Letdown — Let
down.' "
There can be no letdowns
tomorrow, for despite the
generous 18'4-point spread,
San lose State is a formidable
opponent. They have a ball
control passing game like Stan
ford's, but have been able to
complete the big plays that can
demoralize a defense. They
can also score quickly, as evi
denced in their 31-26 come
trom-behind opening win
against Washington State.
"They are a well-conceived

team," Wiggin said. "Jack
Llway has an outstanding toot
ball approach. They are not at
raid to live by the pass. The
running game keeps what they
do alive."
Elway might be the tirst head
( oach to be responsible tor de
veloping both starting quar
terbacks. While his son John
has become one of the premier
quarterbacks in the country,
his player, sophomore Steve
Clarkson, has been the driving
force in the Spartan offense.
Wiggin calls Clarkson "an in
telligent player." Though he
has completed only 44.9 per
cent of his passes, he has tos
sed six touchdowns and is av
eraging 13 yards per comple
tion. All these numbers are in a
class with Elway's, and he has
thrown only two interceptions,
four less than the Stanford star
ter.
Like Stanford, San lose State
uses their running backs as re
ceivers a great deal. Their lead
ing receiver, Cerald Willhite, is
also their leading rusher. The
junior tailback has gained 121
yards on the ground in the

Spartans' three games and has
c aught 18 passes tor 111 yards.
Should he continue that pace,
Willhite will become the sec
ond member ot the 1000-yard,
50-reception club which was
chartered by Darrin Nelson
three years ago.
Other standouts on offense
tor the Spartans include wide
receiver Stacey Bailey and
Mark Nichols and fullback
Steve Bradford, ot whom Wig
gin is especially wary.
Being a highly knowledge
able defensive man, Wiggin
shouldn't be too wary ot the
San lose State defense. This is a
better version of the defense
which gave up 95 points in its
opening two games last sea
son.
There will be two aspe< ts oi
the Stanford offense unseen
last weekend which will prob
ably make themselves known
tomorrow.
One is the long pass. Though
Llway generally passed at will
last week in Oklahoma, often
he was throwing underneath
an Oklahoma defense that
was, tor all intents, backed up

against its goal line. San lost*
State uses a lot of man-to-man
t overage in its defense, so look
tor Stantord to take advantage
ot their outstanding receivers
as well as Elvvay's pri/ed right
arm.
The other asset untouched
last week was Damn Nelson.
Nelson took the week off be
( ause ot a hruised hip, hut has
been [>ra( tic ing all week and is
ready tor tomorrow's game.
The Card defense, however,
needs a little touching up due
to injurv. Linebacker Kevin
Bates remains out tor the game
because of a hip pointer and
will be replaced by Jay Sum
mers. Though Ke\, in Mac Mi I lan
will suit up tor the game, he
will not start, in part because of
the line game Steve Lemon
turned in against Oklahoma.
Ihere is one other in|ury,
one about which coaches can
not complain too loudly. Cor
nerback Rodney Gilmore sut
fered a game-disabling injury
last week against Oklahoma.
He was lumping up and down
on the sidelines in celebration
when he pulled a groin muscle.

Clarkson, has been the driving
force in the Spartan offense.
Wiggin calls Clarkson "an in
telligent player." Though he
has completed only 44.9 per
cent of his passes, he has tos
sed six touchdowns and is av
eraging 13 yards per comple
tion. All these numbers are in a
class with Elway's, and he has
thrown only two interceptions,
four less than the Stanford star
ter.
Like Stanford, San lose State
uses their running backs as re
ceivers a great deal. Their lead
ing receiver, Cerald Willhite, is
also their leading rusher. The
junior tailback has gained 121
yards on the ground in the

Spartans' three games and has
c aught 18 passes tor 111 yards.
Should he continue that pace,
Willhite will become the sec
ond member ot the 1000-yard,
50-reception club which was
chartered by Darrin Nelson
three years ago.
Other standouts on offense
tor the Spartans include wide
receiver Stacey Bailey and
Mark Nichols and fullback
Steve Bradford, ot whom Wig
gin is especially wary.
Being a highly knowledge
able defensive man, Wiggin
shouldn't be too wary ot the
San lose State defense. This is a
better version of the defense
which gave up 95 points in its
opening two games last sea
son.
There will be two aspe< ts oi
the Stanford offense unseen
last weekend which will prob
ably make themselves known
tomorrow.
One is the long pass. Though
Llway generally passed at will
last week in Oklahoma, often
he was throwing underneath
an Oklahoma defense that
was, tor all intents, backed up

against its goal line. San lost*
State uses a lot of man-to-man
t overage in its defense, so look
tor Stantord to take advantage
ot their outstanding receivers
as well as Elvvay's pri/ed right
arm.
The other asset untouched
last week was Damn Nelson.
Nelson took the week off be
( ause ot a hruised hip, hut has
been [>ra( tic ing all week and is
ready tor tomorrow's game.
The Card defense, however,
needs a little touching up due
to injurv. Linebacker Kevin
Bates remains out tor the game
because of a hip pointer and
will be replaced by Jay Sum
mers. Though Ke\, in Mac Mi I lan
will suit up tor the game, he
will not start, in part because of
the line game Steve Lemon
turned in against Oklahoma.
Ihere is one other in|ury,
one about which coaches can
not complain too loudly. Cor
nerback Rodney Gilmore sut
fered a game-disabling injury
last week against Oklahoma.
He was lumping up and down
on the sidelines in celebration
when he pulled a groin muscle.

Willie Guicci, here maneuvering against USF, scored the Cardinals'
lone goal in a 1-0 triumph Wednesday over Westmont College.
Stanford coach Paul Wiggin
would like to warn all those
who feel last week's Jl-M
drubbing of Oklahoma means
the Cardinals are ready to wait/
to the Kose Bowl. The warning
is courtesy of Wiggin s coach
during his playing days at the
Cleveland Browns.
"Paul Brown used to say
when you think you've arrived,
you're in trouble," Wiggin
Swid. In other words, don't buy
those airline tickets to
Pasadena — yet.
Actually, there are plenty of
things this week to keep Stan
ford's feet on the ground after
the ecstasy of their upset of the
Sooners. There is the begin
ning of school. There is the
oppressive swelter and smog
of the summer's last gasp. But
most of all, there is San lose
State.
The 15th-ranked Cards host
the Spartans tomorrow at 1:30
p.m. at Stanford Stadium.
Wiggin said there has been
plenty of guard against a men
tal letdown following last
week's big win.
"I think there might have
been a problem il we had won

two of those in a row," the
coach said. "But having seen
the Boston College game j ust
before 'Stanford lost, 30-15)
every time we get excited
about Oklahoma, Boston pops
up."
Nonetheless, Wiggin
realizes that part ot the poten
tial letdown is inherent in the
aftermath of the upset.
"I've talked to three or four
people and asked them, 'Com
ing off a win like Oklahoma,
what do you do?' " Wiggin
said. "The big thing is to keep it
positive. All you need is some
one saying 'We can't have a
letdown.' That's like a big neon
sign flashing 'Letdown — Let
down.' "
There can be no letdowns
tomorrow, for despite the
generous 18'4-point spread,
San lose State is a formidable
opponent. They have a ball
control passing game like Stan
ford's, but have been able to
complete the big plays that can
demoralize a defense. They
can also score quickly, as evi
denced in their 31-26 come
trom-behind opening win
against Washington State.
"They are a well-conceived

team," Wiggin said. "Jack
Llway has an outstanding toot
ball approach. They are not at
raid to live by the pass. The
running game keeps what they
do alive."
Elway might be the tirst head
( oach to be responsible tor de
veloping both starting quar
terbacks. While his son John
has become one of the premier
quarterbacks in the country,
his player, sophomore Steve
Clarkson, has been the driving
force in the Spartan offense.
Wiggin calls Clarkson "an in
