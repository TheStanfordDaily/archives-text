Washington (AP) â€” Michael "Oz
zie" Myers, convicted of accepting a
bribe in the FBl's Abscam under
cover operation, was expelled from
the House of Representatives yes
terday, the first congressman ousted
by his colleagues since the outbreak
of the Civil War.
The vote to remove Myers was
376-30, easily more than the two
thirds majority required.
Myers, the first congressman con
victed in the FBl's Abscam bribery
investigation in which six other
members of Congress have been im
plicated, protested his expulsion to
the end.
"I know now what it feels like to sit
on death row. As you go to the voting
machine, keep in mind when you hit
that button, that it will have the same
effect of hitting the button if I were
strapped into an electric chair,"
Myers told House members prior to
the vote. Myers, calling the assem
bled House members "a lynching
mob," also said his expulsion was
being considered too soon after his
conviction in August.
He compared his case to that of
former Rep. Charles Diggs (D-Mich.)
who was ( ensured in the House last
year alter his conviction on charges
of mail fraud and misusing congres
sional funds.
"Nine and a half months after the
jury's verdict, the House ethics
committee recommended censure
in the Diggs case," Myers said. "My
timetable goes back to Aug. 30 and
by Sept. 4 the committee opened its
preliminary inquiry and soon after
called for my expulsion."
After the expulsion, Myers filed
suit in U.S. District Court here that
contended the House action violated
his constitutional rights and House
rules.
The Philadelphia Democrat, ad
dressing the entire House for the first
time in his two terms, said before the
vote that he didn't "have a China
man's chance" of avoiding expul
sion.
"How can any member justify this
severe action without any considera
tion for the due process argument is
beyond me," said Myers, whose ap
peal on his bribery and conspiracy
conviction is pending.
Myers' remarks came after the
House voted 332-75 to defeat a resol
ution that would have delayed action
on expulsion until Congress returns

from its election recess in
November.
That vote followed two hours of
debate on the propriety of punishing
Myers under election campaign
pressures and before exhaustion of
his legal appeals.
"This decision is too important to
make in the pre-election atmosphere
in this chamber," Rep. Lee Hamilton
(D-lnd.) told House members
scheduled to leave for a recess this
weekend and return Nov. 12.
"There are no good reasons to
rush to judgment. There are two
good reasons to delay. First, mem
bers will have the evidence and the
time when they return. Second,
members can decide this case in an
atmosphere not charged with elec
tion year concerns," Hamilton said.
Opponents of delay argued that
Myers need only be judged guilty by
Congress, regardless of legal proce
dures.
"This is an issue of ethical conduct
separate from any conviction," said
Rep. Wyche Fowler (D-Ga.), a
member of the House ethics commit
tee. "The conviction only triggered
our proceedings."
