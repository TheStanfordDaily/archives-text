THE NATURAL
GOURMET RESTAURANT
340 University Ave.
Palo Alto
328-5693
The Natural Gourmet is a de
finite must for quiche and
omelette lovers.
Located near the far end of
Liddicoat's Mall in downtown
Palo Alto, the restaurant has
been in operation for about

three years. It is presently
being expanded by the addi
tion of a factory downstairs.
This will increase the produc
tion ot a large variety of
quiches.
The menu, which consists of
mainly natural foods, offers
spinach salads, fresh vegeta
bles, guacamole and the
yummy magic mushroom
sandwich. These are all under
three dollars.

Beverages range from fresh
juices and teas to refreshing
fruit protein drinks made with
yogurt, honey, ice, egg and
protein powder.
The velvety smooth Quiche
Lori, named after the owner, is
an absolutely mouth-watering
find at $1.87 a portion. It is a
marvelous blend of cheeses,
onions, mushrooms, spinach
and yogurt.

The omelettes are equally
delectable. They come with a
variety of goodies inside such
as cheese, spinach, olives and
avocados. Again, they are all
priced under three dollars.
At the Natural Gourmet the
service is quick, and best of all,
the prices are low compared to
many other natural food re
staurants.
