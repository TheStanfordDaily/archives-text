THE COUNTRY SUN CAFE
440 California Ave.
Palo Alto

Healthy food, hanging
plants, rustic decor and folk
music combine to give the
Country Sun Cafe a refreshing
natural charm.
The cafe places emphasis on
preparing a variety of delicious
foods that also offer nutrition
and visual appeal. Manager
Cathi Lerch said, "We're trying
to develop tasty foods that just
happen to be natural foods."
She said the phrase "natural
foods" scares many people.
The large menu features
quiche, soup, salads,
sandwiches, frozen vogurt,
smoothies and deli items.
We selected onion soup,
shrimp salad, a cheddar and
muenster cheese sandwich
and two smoothies at the
"juice bar."
The entrees, placed in wicker
baskets, were brought
promptly to our table.
The steaming cup of onion
soup, a bargain at 75 cents, was
filled with mozzarella cheese,
sauteed onions and crusty
bread. A piping hot corn muf
fin completed the appetizer.
The sandwich, reasonably
priced at $1.85, was stuffed
with two '/4-inch slabs of ched
dar and muenster cheese, in
addition to a generous supply
of bean sprouts and tomatoes.
This was all placed between
two pieces of branola bread,
juicy orange wedges garnished
the basket.
Romaine lettuce, mush
rooms, tomatoes, cucumbers,
and lemon herb dressing
formed the base of the shrimp
salad. An ample portion of
small shrimp were placed on

top, making the dish well
worth the three dollar cost.
Our smoothies were thick
blends of fresh fruit. They were
warm but delicious.
The cafe also offers numer
ous deli items. These include
fruit salad, pickles, potato
salad, marinated mushrooms,
cole slaw and macaroni salad.
Maple custard, zucchini

cake and kitchen sink cookies
are but a few dessert choices.
The casual atmosphere of
the cafe allows tor a variety of
diners. We saw dress ranging
from business suits to shorts to
rollerskates.
Nine tables are available,
and guests can stay or carry
out.
We came on the wrong day,

but the cate features live folk
music tor Friday lunch and
Sunday brunch.
I his satisfying food is availa
ble from 10:00 to 6:00 Monday
through Friday and from 10:00
to 5:00 on weekends.
So next time you are about to
go out tor pi?za again, try the
Country Sun Cafe instead.
