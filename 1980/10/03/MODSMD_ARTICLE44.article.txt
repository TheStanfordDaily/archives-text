Borel's, a lunch and dinner restaurant with a
bar upstairs tor drinks, live music and conversa
tion, stands atop a hill overlooking the South
Bay, just as Mt. Diablo crests the distant shore.
With this lovely vista as a beginning, the creators
of this restaurant demonstrated admirable intel
lect in collaboration with aesthetic sensibility
and skilled craftsmanship. The laudable result of
these orchestrated efforts, the ambiance, earns
pride for its creators, and for us, offers a strong
motivation for dining at Borel's.
The major visual themes begin immediately in
the entryway. A waiting table of sculpted red
wood set amidst redwood beams in long lines
sweeping from the ground to the tip of the ceil
ing is the first of many redwood sculptures and
dining tables throughout the restaurant. The
greenery of abundant hanging plants gives
Borel's an earthy, California appeal. The look is
given grace and elegance, but never pretense,
through the design of the lights.
Modern, yet reminiscent of stately English
street lamps, lanterns send light to the room
from sets of long, blowing flames encased in
glass. The use of glass continues in forming the
wall of the dining room that lines the Bay. This
gives patrons the magic of a classic Bay Area vista
and of lights playing off glass and sea. Thus,
what emerges from the main dining room

where only the carpet seems neglected by the
talented designers, is a smorgasbord of visual
delights. Appreciative patrons often gaze con
tentedly at the various elements.
While the forte of Borel's certainly is its decor,
the service recommends this restaurant also.
Both lunch and dinner menus offer plentiful
variety, including quiche, sandwich creations,
salads, seafood, poultry and meat entrees.
Our meal began with its best foot forward.
Our waiter, whose grace and manner reaffirmed
the surrounding decor,was affable and attentive
to our curiosities. The almost non-stop train of
excellence was followed by the tastiest dish of
the evening, the New England Clam Chowder. It
is among the best I have encountered in the
Northeast or West Coast.
The theme of careful visual presentation
coursed throughout the meal and was
exemplitied in the arrival of monumental look
ingand tasting Alaskan King Crab Legs. The taste
is always above average. All things considered,
including the prices, the offerings are worthy of
your attention.
The cost of a complete dinner of salad; fresh,
warm bread; seasonal vegetables and entree
runs from $8.25 lor baked filet of sole with
shrimp and crabmeat stuffing, to $10.95 for
Prime Rib, to $15.50 tor Alaskan King Crab Legs.
Borel's gets our strong recommendation tor
good food along with a sumptuous visual ex
perience.
