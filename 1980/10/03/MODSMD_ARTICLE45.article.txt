A good restaurant is ex
pected to stimulate all
your senses, especially
taste, 112 rom the moment
you enter King Chuan,
gaze at the pleasing decor,
smell the aroma watting
through the air and hear
the crisp sound of sizzling
rice soup, your senses
tingle. The food certainly
provides no disappoint
ment. King Chuan is a
comfortable place where
the emphasis is on food.

Located in a nook in
Town and Country Village,
King Chuan specializes in
a delightful combination
ot northern and western

Chinese cuisine. To
Chinese, the name itself
signifies that it features the
cuisine of Peking (' Man-
ofSzechuanin
westernmost China.
From across the seas,
Mr. Chen, the owner,

brings us his special Szec
huan style recipes, noted
tor their hot and spicy
flavor. For those with mil
der tastes, he also pre-

pares classic dishes in Pek
ing style.
The menu is well or
ganized and offers a wide
variety. King Chuan pro
\ ides dinners for groups in
either the Peking or Szec
huan style. And, of course,

you cart create your own
dinner by mixing the two.
We settled down and
enjoyed the hot sizzling
rice soup, served with
mushrooms, shrimp,
chicken and water
chestnuts. It did sizzle,
and it tasted delicious.
We then savored the
Mo-Shu pork, which we
agreed was the best we
had tasted.
Next was King Chuan's
version of sweet and sour
pork — succulent morsels
marinated in a natural
cherry sauce. The dish' is a
rara avis on the peninsula,
so we definitely recom
mend you try it.
Two more entrees top
ped the meal: Ta-Chien
chicken and Kung Pao
beef, both szechuan style.
To help wash down the
spices, we recommend
the hot sake or the piquant
Tsing Tao beer.
Finally, dessert arrived,
and did it ever! Flaming
glazed apples were
paraded before us, then
quickly doused in a bowl
of cold water. This sweet
yet light treat was a dessert
that cannot be missed.
If you are in the mood,
as we were, to relax and
have an excellent meal at a
restaurant that is close to
campus, try King Chuan. It
was our good fortune to
have gone there, for we
found just what we were
looking for. It'll be your
good fortune, too — with
out costing one.
