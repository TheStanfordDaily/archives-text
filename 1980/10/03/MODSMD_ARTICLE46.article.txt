LYLY CHINESE
RESTAURANT
406 California Ave.
Palo Alto
328-8489
A charming oriental atmos
phere, great food, reasonable
prices and a location close to
campus make Lyly Chinese Re
staurant ideal tor a pleasant
meal.
The food at Lyly's is excel
lent. My dinner special in
cluded wonton soup, chicken
almond, sweet and sour pork,
shrimp-fried rice and tea.
No prepared food was used
in any of the courses. The
homemade noodles in the
wonton soilp were delicious,
and the chicken almond also
lived up to my highest expecta
tions. At Lyly's, chicken and
almonds far outnumber filler
vegetables.
The sweet and sour pork was
the best I have ever tasted. The
sauce was a savory delight —
not too sweet, sour or floury.
Shrimp-fried rice followed
and tasted as fresh as the chic
ken almond. And Lyly's is
generous with the shrimp.
All meals are cooked in the
true Cantonese style with
crisp, flavorful vegetables.
They are not overcooked or
pretrozen.
Owner Wiley Leon stressed
that his food is not overly hot
or spicy like most oriental
cooking. He also pointed out
the number of daily luncheon
and weekend specials in his
menu. Leon is also happy to
prepare any requested meal
with a call beforehand.
Prices are generally low, and
the portions are huge. Entrees
range from $1.95 for pork with
bean curd to $5.50 for abalone
with oyster sauce.

Numerous specialties are
available, and the menu offers
about 100 items in all.
The restaurant was small, but
there were quite a tew people
tor the late luncheon crowd.
The crystal-clean dining area
can hold over 60 people, and
large parties are welcome and
are easily accommodated. A
take-out service is also availa
ble.

Business hours are 11:00
a.m. to H : 30 p.m. and Saturday
hours are 3:00 p.m. to H:3O
p.m.
The service was pleasant and
prompt, reflecting the polish
Lyly's has acquired in its four
and a halt year history. A visit to
Lyly's would make a great
quick lunch or start to a nice
evening.
