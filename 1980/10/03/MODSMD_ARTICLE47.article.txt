The Henl Yearn of Our Liven
***★
Monday, Kresge Auditorium
What Coming Home is to the
Vietman War, The Best Years of
Our Lives is to World War II This
was the first major film to deal not
with the war itself but with how
the war affected the lives of those
who came home again Best
Years is a striking social docu
ment—there is something aching
ly familiar about watching these
characters trying to survive in a
"peaceful" world, an uncertain
economy, and a changing social
structure.
Greg Toland, who photographed
Citizen Kane, is responsible for
the beautiful use of deep-focus
photography found here. William
Wyler directed. Myrna Loy,
Fredric March, and Harold Rus
sell, an armless veteran who won
an Academy Award for playing
just that, star

Urban Con buy's main charac
ter is Gilley's, a redneck bar in
Houston Gilley's is a harbor for
macho dreams, a haven for the
lonely and unlucky in love.
The film's human characters
aren't so richly presented. The
film's narrative is so dry and so re
strained that we never get an idea
of what drives the people in the
film; we can feel the bar's smoky
allure, but we never feel what
drives John Travolta and Debra
Winger into, and out of. love.

Hair
Sequoia Fox, Redwood City
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip Director
Milos Forman (One Fleu Over the
Cuckoo's Nest) works in a reck
less, giddy fashion; he perfectly
captures the timeless, rock'n'roll,
rebellious spirit of the '60s, and
makes it live again It's a fantasy
vision of America, but even in
those terms, Hair might just be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo, and Treat Williams.
Flays tonight and tomorrow
night.

Seven Heautie» **
New Varsity, Palo Alto
This is writer-director Lina
Wertmuller's most studied,
careful movie, and that helps to
somewhat obscure her repugnant
social attitudes, but you still leave
the theater with a sick feeling in
your stomach The only time
Wertrnuller gives the movie any
resonance is when she's depicting
the degradation of the concentra
tion camp—just like Cecil B De-
Mille, Wertrnuller finds her
greatest delight in shQwing hu
mans at their groveling worst, rev
eling in sin. Giancarlo Giannini's
earnest performance fails to pro
vide the film with the balance nec
essary to make it truly compell
ing.

Bananas ★ * ★
Friday, Kresge
One of Woody Allen's first mov
ies. Bananas deals haphazardly
(as one should i with a Latin Amer
ican revolution This movie is very
sloppily constructed, very uneven
ly paced, and insanely funny An
archy has never looked so good

The Immortal
Aquarius, Palo Alto
An impressive cast— Giancarlo
Giannini, Monica Vitti, Claudia
Cardinale, Vittorio Gassman—is
led astray by this movie's turgid
direction, bad jokes and limp plot.
The dubbing sounds as if it was
looped from reruns of The
Flintstones, and the dialogue con
firms this suspicion. Instant late
show fare—for insomniacs.

Breaking I way **★
Sunday. Mem Aud
A movie this good-natured is
sure to cause cancer if seen too
often or praised too highly. But, in
small doses. Breaking Away can
be invigorating—once in a while
its nice to be persuaded that eve
rything can turn out all right in the
end.
Dennis Christopher plays a
young man who attempts to bi
cycle his way out of the middle
class His is a curiously aimless—
and strikingly American—quest:
escape, and nothing more, is his
goal. While we're watching this
movie, at least, that may be all the
goal that anyone needs

Sequoia Fox. Hedwood City
Howard Hawks directed this
version of the Raymond Chandler
novel. Chandler and William
Faulkner (yes. the William
Faulkner) worked on the script
The story is wonderfully confus
ing, but the way Bogart and
Lauren Racall spew out double en
tendres over drinks and cigarettes
plugs up any gaps in logic. One of
the great American movies

One of the better concert films
I've seen, but I still can't quite get
into ninety minutes of less-than
live entertainment without a plot.
Bette Midler shakes her boobs,
performs illicit sexual acts with
her microphone, and even sings a

Peter Sellers is hilarious in this,

The (.rent Snntini * *
Aquarius. Palo Alto
An interesting movie run
aground bv an ending that renders
meaningless everything that goes
before Robert Duvall plays a
Marine colonel who accuses his
wife of mollycoddling his sons He
abuses his family in what he thinks
is their best interest, and risks al
ienating all of them in the process.
So much so good but then those
lousy last five minutes go and
screw everything up. You might
want to consider going out for pop
corn when it becomes apparent
that the film is drawing to a close.

Old Mill. Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor. Every
thing has become deadly serious
bigger, splashier, but dull.
All the old performers are back,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned Muppet
creature that, for an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending—
jeepers, George, couldn'tyou have
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work?

William Powell and Myrna Loy
play Nick and Nora Charles, a cou
ple who enjoy socializing, drink
ing, and solving murder cases.
Like all of the films of this series
based loosely on the Dashiell Ham
mett story, this one is witty, ur
bane, and highly enjoyable. The
Charles were a rare breed in the
movies of this period—they were a
married couple who seemed to ac
tually enjoy relating to each other
on a more-or-less intellectual
level. Asta the dog is also featured.
Plays through Wednesday with
