Some students at Stanford elect to live off
campus. Others are torciblv ejected from the
security of the University housing svstem bv
unguaranteed status and poor draw numbers
In the spring, the designation unassig" is a
distant worry. But as autumn quarter and the
beginning of school approach, what was for
merly an inconvenience becomes a crisis.
Where do students find off-campus housing?
There are approximately "200 on-campus
housing spaces available to graduates and un
dergraduates on campus, and around 12,500
students enrolled in the University, according
to statistics from the Office ot Residential Edu
cation and the Registrar's Office. Allowing tor
people who have gone overseas, that means
there are roughly 5000 students each year look
ing tor off-campus housing.
In an effort to help out these students, the
University operates the Office ot Rental Hous
ing, also known as the Clearinghouse.
The office, which acts in conjunction with
Residential Education, is located on the third
tloor ot Old Union. It operates year-round arid
provides listings of houses, apartments and

rooms available to Stanford students, facultv
and staff.
September is the busiest time tor the ottice.
Approximately 1500 people took advantage ot
the services ottered during the month, accord
ing to supervisor lune Becker.
Though there is no tee for the services, users
must be affiliated with the University. The
Clearinghouse obtains its listings through ad
vertising in local papers and contacts with area
realtors.
As a result there are often more listings av
ailable to students and staff through the Rental
Ottice than they would be able to find on their
own. In tact, according to Becker, some people
list only through the University.
One student who used the Clearinghouse
noticed this advantage. "I'd been looking on
mv own all summer and getting nowhere," she
said. "There's a lot more available through the
Rental Housing Ottice and it was really help
ful."
Other users added that working through the
University also eliminates a lot of the problems
faced bv students in obtaining housing, "be
cause you don't have to hassle with people who

don't want to rent to students."
During the September housing crunch, the
office provides tree phones, information on car
and furniture rentals and maps of the area. It
also operates the Clearinghouse Hotel out of
Stern Hall, which provides students with a
low-cost place to stay during their search.
To alleviate this particular agony, the rental
office uses money paid by listers to provide
some "extras," to make looking for a place to
live a little more enjoyable.
"During the Clearinghouse, we offer wine
and cheese, movies and other things," said
Becker. "We organize trips to the beach and
San Francisco for people who are staying at the
hotel and have pizza and beer. Different mer
chants in the area donated items to the Clearin
ghouse for this purpose."
There is not quite this range of services dur
ing the rest ot the year, but the office is con
stantly updating its listings to keep its offerings
current. The office is open from 9a.m. to noon
and I to 5 p.m. during the week in room 315 of
Old Union.
