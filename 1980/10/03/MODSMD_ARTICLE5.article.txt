# What's in a bollard?
## Confusion, necessity, change 
### David Frank 
Constantly changing emergency
routes onto the Stanford campus are
frustrating local firefighters in their
efforts to be prepared for fires such
as the one that occurred at Storey
House last spring.
A campus-wide system of bollards
— three-foot-high, closely-spaced
posts — is used to separate the inner
campus, where most class buildings,
pedestrian and bicycle traffic are
found, from automobile traffic.
But some bollards are movable, to
allow emergency vehicles to reach
the inner campus if necessary. The
mystery often is, which of the bol
lards are truly permanent, and which
are vulnerable.
"The bollards on campus change a
lot because they are always getting
damaged and then replaced," said
Palo Alto firefighter Lee Caudill, who
estimated he was delayed two mi
nutes in reaching the March 3 blaze
because of confusion about the bol

lard system.
"It's hard for us (the firefighters) to
keep up on the changes," he said,
adding he spends "at least" one hour
each shift driving around campus to
check for changes in the bollards.
"If the word gets to the
firefighters," Caudill said, "it doesn't
seem to get to me fast enough. It's
frustrating."
Until about two years ago, the bol
lard system was unmistakeable.
Nearly all the bollards on campus
were metal, and immovable.
However, according to lohn Lerry,
a facilities engineer for the Univer
sity, matter often accumulated in the
holes in which the bollards were
placed, making the bollards difficult
to remove.
Furthermore, maintenance of the
metal bollards was expensive, as the
metal required frequent repainting,
he said.
Lerry said the University has spent
$90,000 over the last two years replac

ing metal bollards with other, non
metallic types. Although many metal
barriers still have not been replaced,
students have seen the addition of
three new types of bollards.
The first is non-removable and
built of stone. The other two types
are removable and made of wood.
However, each wood type is re
moved in a different manner, and
this has led to confusion for some
firefighters who often don't learn of
bollard changes until they drive
around campus.
One type of wood bollard is called
a "breakaway" bollard, since it is de
signed to be knocked over by
emergency vehicles. The breakaways
became unpopular, Lerry said, after
they damaged some firetrucks and
emergency vehicles.
In addition, Lerry said the breaka
ways were difficult to replace since
they had to be cemented in the
ground.
