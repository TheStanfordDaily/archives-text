# What's in a bollard?
## Confusion, necessity, change 
### David Frank 
Constantly changing emergency
routes onto the Stanford campus are
frustrating local firefighters in their
efforts to be prepared for fires such
as the one that occurred at Storey
House last spring.
A campus-wide system of bollards
— three-foot-high, closely-spaced
posts — is used to separate the inner
campus, where most class buildings,
pedestrian and bicycle traffic are
found, from automobile traffic.
But some bollards are movable, to
allow emergency vehicles to reach
the inner campus if necessary. The
mystery often is, which of the bol
lards are truly permanent, and which
are vulnerable.
"The bollards on campus change a
lot because they are always getting
damaged and then replaced," said
Palo Alto firefighter Lee Caudill, who
estimated he was delayed two mi
nutes in reaching the March 3 blaze
because of confusion about the bol

lard system.
"It's hard for us (the firefighters) to
keep up on the changes," he said,
adding he spends "at least" one hour
each shift driving around campus to
check for changes in the bollards.
"If the word gets to the
firefighters," Caudill said, "it doesn't
seem to get to me fast enough. It's
frustrating."
Until about two years ago, the bol
lard system was unmistakeable.
Nearly all the bollards on campus
were metal, and immovable.
However, according to lohn Lerry,
a facilities engineer for the Univer
sity, matter often accumulated in the
holes in which the bollards were
placed, making the bollards difficult
to remove.
Furthermore, maintenance of the
metal bollards was expensive, as the
metal required frequent repainting,
he said.
Lerry said the University has spent
$90,000 over the last two years replac

ing metal bollards with other, non
metallic types. Although many metal
barriers still have not been replaced,
students have seen the addition of
three new types of bollards.
The first is non-removable and
built of stone. The other two types
are removable and made of wood.
However, each wood type is re
moved in a different manner, and
this has led to confusion for some
firefighters who often don't learn of
bollard changes until they drive
around campus.
One type of wood bollard is called
a "breakaway" bollard, since it is de
signed to be knocked over by
emergency vehicles. The breakaways
became unpopular, Lerry said, after
they damaged some firetrucks and
emergency vehicles.
In addition, Lerry said the breaka
ways were difficult to replace since
they had to be cemented in the
ground.
Consequently. he added the Uni
versity has been installing wood bol
lards sec ured to the ground bv metal
plates. The plates have locks that
firefighters and other emergency
employees i an open.
The principle goal of the im
provements is to improve safety by
c reating more tightlv controlled, ott
limits areas for automobiles, Lerry
said.
Some $25,000 has been alloted in
this year's budget lor c ontinuing the
bollard installations, Lerrv said.
According to Palo Alto Fire C hief
Bill kortt, information on replace
ment of damaged bollards takes time
to pass from the campus mainte
nance workers — who replace dam
aged barriers — to the University's
Department of Public Safety and
then more time for the department
to relay the information to the Palo
Alto Fire Department.
The public safety department in
forms the fire department of the
c hanges Fn providing maps showing
what types of bollards occupy wFnc h
areas of campus.
While acknowledging that this
procedure exists, Kortt said prob
lems tor his men occur not when the
new bollards are first installed, Fnit
when new bollards are damaged and
then replaced.
Kortf also acknowledged time gaps
in relaying the information, but he
called the lapses "inevitable."
Furthermore, said Kortt, an ab
sence of bollards on campus could
cause firefighters even greater delays
than were experienced by
firefighters on the way to the Storey
lire. Without the barriers, he said,
private vehicles would jam streets for
parking, obstructing the emergency
access routes.
The contusion in which Caudill
said he lost time while hurrying to
reach Storey House began when he

tried to turn from Serra St. onto I a
suen Mall (near the History C orner,
building 2(H)) and approat h Storey by
traversing the Mall and White I'la/a
There were new wood bollards at
the Serra-I asuen junt ture. I hadn t
seen them (the new bollards) before,
and I didn't want to stop and mess
with them to see how to remove
them," I audill said.
Instead, he took a small detour,
driving the lire engine into White
Plaza alter jumping a curb behind
Meyer Library.
If took about 2' i hours for the first
engine company and the II
emergency units that arrived to ton
fa in the tire The blaze c aused $ I mill
ion damage to the building, accord
ing to Norm Robinson, dean of resi
dential edut ation.
None of the s') female residents of
the house were injured.

found, from automobile traffic.
But some bollards are movable, to
allow emergency vehicles to reach
the inner campus if necessary. The
mystery often is, which of the bol
lards are truly permanent, and which
are vulnerable.
"The bollards on campus change a
lot because they are always getting
damaged and then replaced," said
Palo Alto firefighter Lee Caudill, who
estimated he was delayed two mi
nutes in reaching the March 3 blaze
because of confusion about the bol

lard system.
"It's hard for us (the firefighters) to
keep up on the changes," he said,
adding he spends "at least" one hour
each shift driving around campus to
check for changes in the bollards.
"If the word gets to the
firefighters," Caudill said, "it doesn't
seem to get to me fast enough. It's
frustrating."
Until about two years ago, the bol
lard system was unmistakeable.
Nearly all the bollards on campus
were metal, and immovable.
However, according to lohn Lerry,
a facilities engineer for the Univer
sity, matter often accumulated in the
holes in which the bollards were
placed, making the bollards difficult
to remove.
Furthermore, maintenance of the
metal bollards was expensive, as the
metal required frequent repainting,
he said.
Lerry said the University has spent
$90,000 over the last two years replac

ing metal bollards with other, non
metallic types. Although many metal
barriers still have not been replaced,
students have seen the addition of
three new types of bollards.
The first is non-removable and
built of stone. The other two types
are removable and made of wood.
However, each wood type is re
moved in a different manner, and
this has led to confusion for some
firefighters who often don't learn of
bollard changes until they drive
around campus.
One type of wood bollard is called
a "breakaway" bollard, since it is de
signed to be knocked over by
emergency vehicles. The breakaways
became unpopular, Lerry said, after
they damaged some firetrucks and
emergency vehicles.
In addition, Lerry said the breaka
ways were difficult to replace since
they had to be cemented in the
ground.
Consequently. he added the Uni
versity has been installing wood bol
lards sec ured to the ground bv metal
plates. The plates have locks that
firefighters and other emergency
employees i an open.
The principle goal of the im
provements is to improve safety by
c reating more tightlv controlled, ott
limits areas for automobiles, Lerry
said.
Some $25,000 has been alloted in
this year's budget lor c ontinuing the
bollard installations, Lerrv said.
According to Palo Alto Fire C hief
Bill kortt, information on replace
ment of damaged bollards takes time
to pass from the campus mainte
nance workers — who replace dam
aged barriers — to the University's
Department of Public Safety and
then more time for the department
to relay the information to the Palo
Alto Fire Department.
The public safety department in
forms the fire department of the
c hanges Fn providing maps showing
what types of bollards occupy wFnc h
areas of campus.
While acknowledging that this
procedure exists, Kortt said prob
lems tor his men occur not when the
new bollards are first installed, Fnit
when new bollards are damaged and
then replaced.
Kortf also acknowledged time gaps
in relaying the information, but he
called the lapses "inevitable."
Furthermore, said Kortt, an ab
sence of bollards on campus could
cause firefighters even greater delays
than were experienced by
firefighters on the way to the Storey
lire. Without the barriers, he said,
private vehicles would jam streets for
parking, obstructing the emergency
access routes.
The contusion in which Caudill
said he lost time while hurrying to
reach Storey House began when he

tried to turn from Serra St. onto I a

building 2(H)) and approat h Storey by
traversing the Mall and White I'la/a
