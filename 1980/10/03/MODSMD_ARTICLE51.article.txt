WELCOME!

On more than one hundred miles
of shelving, in over twelve acres of
space, the Libraries of Stanford
University house the eighth largest
academic library collection in the

United States. On these shelves
are some 4Vz million volumes, plus
sizable holdings of manuscripts,
maps, microforms, sound record
ings, and photographs, in addition
to miscellaneous other traditional
and non-traditional library mate
rials.
The following pages offer an over
view of the myriad resources, set-

vices, and facilities ot the libraries
at Stanford. A series of printed bro
chures, Guides to the Stunford Uni
versity Libraries, available in li
braries throughout campus, con
tain more details. Staff in the vari
ous libraries are happy to provide
further information as needed or to
assist in locating library materials
w hether available here at Stanford
or elsewhere.
