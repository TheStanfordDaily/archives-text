Some Facts and Figures

The complex of libraries at Stanford is divided
administratively between the University Li
braries and the coordinate libraries. The former is
adminstered through the Provost's Office and
comprises the Cecil H. Green Library, the J.
Henry Meyer Memorial (Undergraduate) Li
brary, ten research branches (seven of them in
the sciences), and several smaller working branch
libraries.
The coordinate libraries — Business, Law,
Medicine, Food Research, Hoover, and SLAC —
report directly to the school or institution of
which they are a part and, like the University
Libraries, are open to all members of the Stanford
campus community.
Together, the University Libraries and the six
coordinate libraries add to their collective re
sources at the rate of more than 100,000 volumes
annually. Fifty percent of the combined staff of
nearly five hundred librarians and support staff
work in the Green Library; eighty or so work in
Meyer and the research branches, while the re
mainder are distributed among the coordinate
libraries.

The present Green Library is actually the third
physical location of the central humanities and
social science collections. Stanford's first library,
which had 3,000 volumes was located in what is
now the President's Office from 1891-1900.
When the Outer Quad was finished late in the
year 1900, the Thomas Welton Stanford Library,
as it was then called, was moved to Building 170.
The collection, by then, included 50,000 vol
umes.
Plans were underway to move the rapidly
growing collections into a new building on the
site of the present Graudate School of Business,
when the Great Earthquake struck on April 18,
1906, and the building was destroyed. Not until
1919 was the present West Wing of the Green
Library building completed and occupied. The
East Wing of the Green Library was just recently
completed and opened in January of 1980.
Other campus libraries have been established
and housed as needed. Notable events of this kind
included transfer of the Lane Medical Library
from San Francisco to Stanford in 1959 and the
opening of the Meyer Library for undergraduates
in 1966.

Moving Ahead

In January of 1980, the Green Library collec
tions and public service departments expanded
into a new East Wing, nearly doubling the shelv
ing capacity and providing growth space for many
years to come. The expanded facility can seat
more than 1000 users at one time, in a variety of
seating arrangements — carrels, lounge areas,
tables, individual studies, and group study rooms.
Typing rooms are available on each of the three
new stack floors. Communication rooms on each
floor contain photocopy machines, and each has
the capacity for future installation of computer
terminals for direct users asccess to the libraries'
on-line catalog. There are also courtesy phones in
the communication rooms and pay telephones in
the rooms on the lower level and the second floor.
The new facilities throughout the building
have increased the ease of access to the catalogs,
the reference collections, and circulation ser
vices. Newspapers and microtexts are housed in
an attractive and functional area designed to
facilitate the use of materials in these formats.
The former Meyer Basement stack area has been
connected to the Lower Level of the East Wing,
thereby creating one huge stack floor and thus
greatly improving access to all of the Green
Library collections.
During this year, the West Wing of the Green
Library is being renovated. The Department of
Special Collections will be moving to the
Rotunda area and the Government Documents
Department will be moving to their new facility
oft the East Wing lobby. The Stanford University
Archives will be moving to the Bender Room.
Details of these renovations will be announced
in the Stanford Daily and Campus Report during
the year.
Managing the Growth of
Library Collections
As academic programs at Stanford change and
grow, so too must the Libraries' collections. To
support the teaching and research functions of
the Stanford community, the collections must

anticipate the needs of scholars present and future
with materials published today and yesterday.
Many more books are published each year in
the United States alone than any one library can
or should acquire. Additionally, the library must
increasingly acquire and provide access to data
files and other non-book material to serve the
changing information needs of our primary user
group: the faculty and students of Stanford Uni
versity. The task thus becomes one of planning,
building, evaluating and pruning the collections
with the aim of meeting these varied needs. Parti
cipation in cooperative collection development
and resource sharing arrangements with Berkeley
and the Research Libraries Group is one strategy
designed to accomplish this task.
More than 30 language and subject area spe
cialists take part in the Collection Development
Program (CDP) at Stanford. Some work full time
for CDP, with broad language area responsibili
ties serving the needs of several academic depart
ment, for example, Latin American and Iberian,
Russian and Eastern European, Romance, and
Germanic language materials.
Others may spend 10% to 40% of their time
directly on collection development activities
while also managing a branch library or working
in a department or division in the Green Library.
Their collection development responsibilities are
generally subject related: English and American
literature, music, physics, chemistry, anthropol
ogy, psychology, etc.
Regardless of the amount of time spent, all staff
with CDP responsibilities are involved in a vari
ety of collection-related tasks. Assisted by grad
uate student bibliographers, they evaluate indi
vidual areas of the collections for quality and
utility. They familiarize themselves with course
offerings and related programs. They respond to
faculty and student requests for individual items
not yet in the collections. All provide reference
assistance in their particular area(s) of expertise,
either formally, i.e. at a reference desk, or infor
mally, in their offices or elsewhere.
A complete list of CDP bibliographers, indicat
ing language or subject specialty, office location,
and phone number, is available at library public
service desks.

The collection, by then, included 50,000 vol
umes.
Plans were underway to move the rapidly
growing collections into a new building on the
site of the present Graudate School of Business,
when the Great Earthquake struck on April 18,
1906, and the building was destroyed. Not until
1919 was the present West Wing of the Green
Library building completed and occupied. The
East Wing of the Green Library was just recently
completed and opened in January of 1980.
Other campus libraries have been established
and housed as needed. Notable events of this kind
included transfer of the Lane Medical Library
from San Francisco to Stanford in 1959 and the
opening of the Meyer Library for undergraduates
in 1966.

Moving Ahead

In January of 1980, the Green Library collec
tions and public service departments expanded
into a new East Wing, nearly doubling the shelv
ing capacity and providing growth space for many
years to come. The expanded facility can seat
more than 1000 users at one time, in a variety of
seating arrangements — carrels, lounge areas,
tables, individual studies, and group study rooms.
Typing rooms are available on each of the three
new stack floors. Communication rooms on each
floor contain photocopy machines, and each has
the capacity for future installation of computer
terminals for direct users asccess to the libraries'
on-line catalog. There are also courtesy phones in
the communication rooms and pay telephones in
the rooms on the lower level and the second floor.
The new facilities throughout the building
have increased the ease of access to the catalogs,
the reference collections, and circulation ser
vices. Newspapers and microtexts are housed in
an attractive and functional area designed to
facilitate the use of materials in these formats.
The former Meyer Basement stack area has been
connected to the Lower Level of the East Wing,
thereby creating one huge stack floor and thus
greatly improving access to all of the Green
Library collections.
During this year, the West Wing of the Green
Library is being renovated. The Department of
Special Collections will be moving to the
Rotunda area and the Government Documents
Department will be moving to their new facility
oft the East Wing lobby. The Stanford University
Archives will be moving to the Bender Room.
Details of these renovations will be announced
in the Stanford Daily and Campus Report during
the year.
Managing the Growth of
Library Collections
As academic programs at Stanford change and
grow, so too must the Libraries' collections. To
support the teaching and research functions of
the Stanford community, the collections must

anticipate the needs of scholars present and future
with materials published today and yesterday.
Many more books are published each year in
the United States alone than any one library can
or should acquire. Additionally, the library must
increasingly acquire and provide access to data
files and other non-book material to serve the
changing information needs of our primary user
group: the faculty and students of Stanford Uni
versity. The task thus becomes one of planning,
building, evaluating and pruning the collections
with the aim of meeting these varied needs. Parti
cipation in cooperative collection development
and resource sharing arrangements with Berkeley
and the Research Libraries Group is one strategy
designed to accomplish this task.
More than 30 language and subject area spe
cialists take part in the Collection Development
Program (CDP) at Stanford. Some work full time
for CDP, with broad language area responsibili
ties serving the needs of several academic depart
ment, for example, Latin American and Iberian,
Russian and Eastern European, Romance, and
Germanic language materials.
Others may spend 10% to 40% of their time
directly on collection development activities
while also managing a branch library or working
in a department or division in the Green Library.
Their collection development responsibilities are
generally subject related: English and American
literature, music, physics, chemistry, anthropol
ogy, psychology, etc.
Regardless of the amount of time spent, all staff
with CDP responsibilities are involved in a vari
ety of collection-related tasks. Assisted by grad
uate student bibliographers, they evaluate indi
vidual areas of the collections for quality and
utility. They familiarize themselves with course
offerings and related programs. They respond to
faculty and student requests for individual items
not yet in the collections. All provide reference
assistance in their particular area(s) of expertise,
either formally, i.e. at a reference desk, or infor
mally, in their offices or elsewhere.
A complete list of CDP bibliographers, indicat
ing language or subject specialty, office location,
and phone number, is available at library public
service desks.

Some Facts and Figures

The complex of libraries at Stanford is divided
administratively between the University Li
braries and the coordinate libraries. The former is
adminstered through the Provost's Office and
comprises the Cecil H. Green Library, the J.
Henry Meyer Memorial (Undergraduate) Li
brary, ten research branches (seven of them in
the sciences), and several smaller working branch
libraries.
The coordinate libraries — Business, Law,
Medicine, Food Research, Hoover, and SLAC —
report directly to the school or institution of
which they are a part and, like the University
Libraries, are open to all members of the Stanford
campus community.
Together, the University Libraries and the six
coordinate libraries add to their collective re
sources at the rate of more than 100,000 volumes
annually. Fifty percent of the combined staff of
nearly five hundred librarians and support staff
work in the Green Library; eighty or so work in
Meyer and the research branches, while the re
mainder are distributed among the coordinate
libraries.

The present Green Library is actually the third
physical location of the central humanities and
social science collections. Stanford's first library,
which had 3,000 volumes was located in what is
now the President's Office from 1891-1900.
