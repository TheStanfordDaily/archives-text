"What famous painter was associated with Flora
Tristan. 7 "
"Did Macßeth ever leave Scotland and if so where
and when did he go?
"What were the numbers of employed and unem
ployed workers, and the average wage rates, during
the period of the British General Strike?"
For quick answers to questions like these or
bibliographic assistance for advanced doctoral or
faculty research — or for a variety of information
needs in between — the staff of the General
Reference Department provide expert help to
library users. Located on the main floor of the
Green Library East, the Department responds to
in-person requests, telephone calls, and letters
from inquirers on campus, elsewhere in Cal
ifornia, throughout the United States, and over
seas.
To assist in providing these information ser
vices, the staff rely on 30,000 volumes, which, in
addition to works of a general nature, contain
specialized material in the humanities and social
sciences, especially in those disciplines for which
no branch or coordinate library exists.
Among the variety of materials housed in the
General Reference Room are atlases, catalogs of
specialized collections in other major libraries,
dictionaries and directories of all kinds, encyclo
pedias, guides to important microfilm collections,
indexes and abstracts of journal literature, na
tional and trade bibliographies, newspaper in
dexes, research guides, specialized subject guides,
and union lists of serials, Stanford's as well as
others. Some appreciation of the scope of the
collection may be gained by consulting the Guide
to Selected Reference Materials, available at the
Reference Desk.
Library users are encouraged to consult the staff
at the Reference Desk or Information Desk for
assistance in using the Library's catalogs or any of
the materials listed above. General Reference
staff will also check RLIN* to determine the
status of a book on order or place a msh cataloging
request for a book received but not yet on the
shelves.

University Archives

The "collective memory" of Stanford Uni
versity was established in 1965 by the Board of
Trustees to preserve and make available the his
torical record of the University and the Stanford
community.
In the Timothy Hopkins Room (3rd floor,
West Wing, Green Library), the reader will find,
among other things, papers of Stanford faculty
members and presidents, records of campus of
fices and student organizations, Stanford family
scrapbooks and photo albums, publications of all
kinds produced on or about Stanford, theses and
dissertations, photos and slides, maps, prints, and
posters, student letters, diaries, and scrapbooks,
et cetera.
A rich and wonderful store of information and

research materials, the University Archives is
open to scholars, students, authors, and other
interested persons regardless of academic affili
ation.

Current Periodicals and
Micro texts Room

The Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room, located on the lower level of Green Li
brary's East Wing, houses periodicals, news
papers, and a diverse collection of microforms.
The periodicals collection consists of the most
recent issues of 3,500 selected academic journals
and popular magazines. Current issues of other
journals may he found with their hound hack files
in the Stack or in other libraries on campus. The
Stanford Union List of SenaLs (SULS), issued quar
terly on microfiche, provides location and hold
ings information for serials held in the University
Libraries and in several coordinate libraries.
Current issues of fifty domestic and foreign
newspapers can be found in the newspaper collec
tion, as well as back issues in newsprint and in
microform of over 800 newspaper titles, some
dating back to the early nineteenth century. Al
though these newspapers are not listed in the
main card catalog or in SULS, card files are main
tained in the Current Periodicals and Microtexts

Room to provide titles, city of origin and holdings
records. Indexes for a number of newspapers, in
cluding the Nen' York Times, may be found in the
Reference Room.
The microtexts collections reflect the variety
and diversity of research interests at Stanford. A
small sampling of the collections includes: Presi
dential Papers, the History of Women collection,
Early American Imprints, the anthropological
documents contained in the Human Relations
Area File, AEC Technical Reports, British Par
liamentary Papers, Census reports dating back to
1790, and the collection of Three Centuries of
American and British Drama. These large micro
publishing projects were designed to make a great
body of historical material easily accessible to
scholars.
The individual titles included in most of these
omnibus collections are not listed separately in
the card catalog. However, guides to the indi
vidual collections are available in both the Cur
rent Periodicals and Microtexts Rcxmi. Readers
interested in material that may be contained in
the microform collections should inquire at the
Reference Desk or the Current Periodicals and
Microtexts Reference Desk.
In addition to microform readers, machines
which produce paper copies from microfilm and
microfiche are available in the Microtexts Read
ing Room. There are also portable microfilm
readers available for ten day loan.

Central Circulation

The Central Circulation Department is re
sponsible for providing access to, maintaining
and circulating the more than IV2 million vol
umes which comprise the main research collec
tion of the University Libraries, as well as ad
ministering all study spaces located within the
Green Library.

Upon entering the Green Library everyone is
asked by a member of the Portal Unit to show a
Stanford University identification card. Access
to Library services is available to all Stanford
University faculty, staff, students and affiliates.
The Privileges Division staff is happy to answer
any questions regarding access to Green as well as
general information about the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries. Loctaed on the first floor of the East
Wing of the Library, the Privileges Desk is also
the place to direct questions concerning Library
study space (including Faculty Studies, Disserta
tion Rooms and Group Studies); branch library
hours and locations; the UCB/Stanford Research
Library Cooperative Program; and public trans
portation in the Bay Area and the various com
muter services which serve the Stanford com
munity.
Most humanities and social sciences materials
which constitute the main research collection are
located in the Green Library Stack, comprised of
the East (E), West (W) and South (S) stacks.
Some older materials are located in Auxiliary
Storage and must be paged from the Loan Desk.
All of these materials are designated 'STACK' or
'STK' in the card catalog and in SULS. Stack
Directories are posted throughout the Library in
dicating location of materials by stack (E, W,S) or
other symbol. Loan Desk staff members will be
glad to help readers determine in which of the
locations material they are looking for is housed
and arrange to have material paged if necessary.
In addition to charging materials for circula
tion (including checking out Green Library books
and the Green Library Self-Guided Tour Cassette
Tapes), Loan Desk staff offer information regard
ing borrowing policies as well as general Library
information; handle Graduate Reserves; take
paging requests for items needed from the Aux
iliary Stack; recall materials needed for other
readers; search for items not found on Library
shelves; assess fines for overdue, lost or other
problem materials, and provide a review and ap
peals service regarding such fines. Questions re-

"Topographic maps of the Malay Peninsula...an
ethno-linguistic map of the USSR, a street map of
Chicago; maps...of old mining sites in California
...information about satellite mapping—these
are but a few of the many useful items to be
found in the Central Map Collection..."

garding Lost and Found may also be directed to
Loan Desk staff members. Materials borrowed
through Interlibrary Loan or UCB's Baker Ser
vice may be picked up at the Loan Desk, located
on the first floor of the East Wing.
With more than 25 miles of book shelves to
maintain, the Stack staff is kept busy reshelving
hundreds of books daily as well as organizing
shelves so that books are in their proper locations
when needed. In addition, members of the Stack
staff administer lockers located throughout the
East Stack; page books for the handicapped; keep
study space for library users clear of extraneous
materials; report building problems; keep holders
throughout the Library full of blank charge cards
and Stanford University Library (SUL) Guides;
and empty Library book returns located outside of
the Library. Questions may be directed to mem
bers of the Stack staff in the Lower Level Stack
Sort Room (Rm 42A).
Upon leaving the Library, everyone is asked by
a member of the Portal Unit to open all bags and
briefcases for inspection of Library materials. This
is to insure against uncharged materials leaving
the Library.
All Central Circulation Department staff are
happy to answer any questions regarding services
offered by the Department or general informa
tional questions about the Library.

Central Map Collection
Topographic maps of Nigeria, a wall map of the
Roman Empire, an ethnolinguistic map of the
USSR, a street map of Beijing, maps showing
population distribution in Kenya, or the natural
vegetation of California, gazetteers of place
names — these are but a few of the many useful
items to be found in the central Map Collection,
located in the Shainwald Room on the second
floor of Green Library West.
A map specialist provides assistance in the use
of the map card catalog, gazetteers and indexes.
She will help a patron find appropriate carto
graphic reference works, or locate and retrieve
needed materials from the map cases.
When necessary, the user will be referred to
other campus locations for maps and related in
formation; for example, the Branner Earth Sci
ences Library, which contains a large collection
of geological maps, or the Physics Library where
astronomical maps, such as the Palomar Sky
Atlas, are housed.
Hours for the Central Map Collection are
Monday through Friday, 1 p.m.—s p.m. or by
appointment. Tours are offered on the second
and third Thursdays of the Autumn and Spring
quarters from 3—3:30 p.m. Additional tours may
be arranged with the Map Specialist.

Government Documents

Question: What do a list of plants "native" to
California, the text of the SALT 11 treaty, a picture of
the moon's surface, gas mileage ratings for American
and foreign cars, and a recipe for cabbage rolls have in
common?
Answer: All are found in government docu
ments.
Documents provide primary sources for re
search, a better understanding of the events be
hind today's headlines, and information essential
to being an informed consumer, voter, or citizen.
Temporarily located in the Green Library's
West Wing, the Government Documents De
partment houses about 250,000 government pub
lications, or roughly half of Stanford's total docu
ments holdings. In the Department proper, users
will find the depository collections for U.S. Fed
eral, California State, and United Nations publi
cations; exceptional holdings of British Parlia
mentary papers; and selected documents from in
ternational agencies and from U.S. state and
local governments. The reference collection is
particularly strong in statistical materials and
should be regarded as the place to begin whenever
statistics are needed.
Many documents are also acquired by the De
partment and listed in the card catalog, but
shelved in other locations. These include the
publications of foreign governments as well as
documents from local, national, or international
agencies germane to the subject collections of
branch libraries.
Most documents are listed neither in the main
catalog nor in SULS, but only in the card catalog
in the Documents Department. Records are
maintained there for all government documents
in the University Libraries, including those in the
Green Library stack and the branch libraries, but
excluding those in the Coordinate Libraries.
Documents reference staff are available during
all hours the Department is open to provide able
assistance in finding documents information.
Further information about Government Docu
ments is available directly from the staff of the
department in the Library Guide: How to Find
Government Documents.

Special Collections

Too often viewed only as treasures to he ap
preciated from afar rather than used, the rare
books and manuscripts housed in the Department
of Special Collections are an important resource
for all members of the Stanford community. Any
one with a scholarly need may consult Special
Collections and visitors are always welcome to
view the exhibits in the Bender Room.
Special collections materials do not circulate,
but may be used in the Bender Room, on the top
floor front of the Green Library, West Wing.
Of interest not only to Stanford but also to
scholars at large are the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Collection of 19th and 20th century English and
American literature, the Morgan A. and Aline
D. Gunst Collection on the history of printing
and the book arts, the Memorial Library of Music,
the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought,
the Theater Collection (containing books as well
as theater ephemera) and the Stanford Collection
of German, Swiss, and Austrian Culture. The
general Rare B(X)k Collection contains anti
quarian and valuable books in all subject areas
except those covered by the "special" collections
just listed.
The Manuscript Division within the Depart
ment collects a variety of unique, original mate
rial, ranging from Greek papyrus to medieval
manuscripts and contemporary letters and manu
scripts of such writers as John Steinbeck, W.B.
Yeats and D.H. Lawrence. Present holdings are
also strong in material on the Civil War period
and the early 20th century Progressive Movement
in California Farm Labor, and Chicano papers.
Each year the Department sponsors several
major exhibits in which some portion of its hold
ings are displayed. During 1979-80 these exhibits
focused on Somerset Maugham, the new Alma
den mine, and Discovery and Learning in the
18th century.
Another activity which may be of interest to
some is a Student Book Collecting Contest spon
sored jointly with the Associates of the Stanford
University Libraries. For details, students should
contact the librarians in Special Collections.

"Too often viewed only
as treasures to be
appreciated from afar
rather than used, the
many materials housed
in the Department of
Special Collections are
an important resource for
all members of the
Stanford community."
