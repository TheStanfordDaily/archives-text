Data Services I:
Computerized
Literature
Searching
Most libraries in the Stanford University
campus provide online computerized literature
searches of various commercially available data
bases that are produced by learned societies, as
sociations, government agencies, and other or
ganizations. The Libraries have access to over 100
data bases of national or international scope
through contracts with three companies: 1) Bib
liographic Retrieval Services, 2) Lockheed Infor
mation Systems, and 3) System Development
Corporation. Online searches usually yield a
computer-generated list of bibliographic cita
tions, often with abstracts, to journal articles,
books, dissertations, technical reports, govern
ment publications, or other material on your re
search interests. Biographical information and
statistical compilations can be retrieved from
searches of some data bases. In some cases,
searches establish that little or no material exists
on a specific question in one or more data bases.
This is often valuable information for those indi
viduals seeking to verify that they are not
duplicating prior research. In addition to single
retrospective searches, current awareness profiles
can be established on several data bases to provide
researchers with automatic monthly searches.
These online searches are conducted on a fee
basis for current faculty, students and staff of
Stanford University by library staff experienced in
effectively utilizing the high levels of speed and
flexibility which characterize this process. Key
words, chosen during the client interview to ex
press the topic under investigation, can often be
searched in titles, abstracts, and assigned subject
terms of material that constitutes the data base.
Two or more concepts of related keywords can be
quickly matched to complete the inquiry process.
When necessary, and based on intermediate
search results (i.e., titles of articles) displayed at
the computer terminal, strategy can be modified
to better express the question being searched.
The client's review of selected titles during the
process mentioned above aids the search analyst's
efforts to more effectively tailor search strategy.
Printouts from most searches are generated at a
re.note computer facility (i.e., offline) and made
available to the client within three to four busi
ness days of the search. Search results can be
printed on the Library's computer printer, usually
at a higher cost than offline printing.
Client charges are based on the number of
computer connect minutes required for the search
plus the cost of offline printouts. A retrospective
search, yielding fifty citations, might range from
an average cost of $10 for the ERIC database to
$30 for BIOSIS Previews, Psychological Ab
stracts, and Management Contents, to $s>o for
the Smithsonian Science Information Exchange.
Charges for current awareness profiles, yielding a
monthly average of fifteeen citations, consist of
the initial cost to search the data base in esta
blishing the profile as well as a monthly charge
which averages $5 to $ 10.

Computerized literature searches are con
ducted in various subject disciplines, including:
the applied and biological sciences, technology,
business, the social sciences, and the humanities.
Those interested in additional information
should contact either Green Library Reference
Department or the appropriate branch or coordi
nate library on campus.

Data Services II:
Social Science Data Files

A wealth of non-bibliographic information,
available on computer tapes may he accessed
through the Stanford University Libraries and the
Stanford Center for Information Technology
(CIT). These data tapes are acquired primarily
from the Inter-University Consortium for Politi
cal and Social Research (ICPSR) in Ann Arbor,
Michigan and report on attitudes and social ex
periences in the United States, Europe, and other
selected countries. They include studies in such
disciplines as political science, sociology, eco
nomics, social psychology, and education.
Data tapes are also acquired from private re
searchers, the Roper Public Opinion Research
Center, the University of Wisconsin and other
selected data archives. The Roper Center tapes
contain public opinion surveys from the United
States, and over 80 other countries, on various
public policy and consumer issues. A typical
search of such a file would yield a list of questions
asked on a specific topic and a tabulation of ans
wers by various characteristics such as age or geo
graphic location. Searches of these offline data
tapes are charged to CIT accounts. Green Library
collects the codebooks for these tapes and updates
the Data File Directory. This directory lists files
(data tapes) acquired by the University Libraries
and is available in a printed format in any campus
library or online through SPIRES.
Additional information about the data tapes is
available from subject bibliographers in the Uni
versity Libraries or from Karen Wittenborg, Gen
eral Reference Department, Green Library (497-
1811).

FASTBOOK, a service unit of the General
Reference Department, provides library to library
delivery of library materials and photocopy for
faculty, staff, and graduate students. Requests
may be called in, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, by
phoning the FASTBOOK coordinating unit in
the Green Library at 7-FAST (7-3278). The re
quester need not know if or where the material is
located on campus; FASTBOOK staff will search
to see if Stanford owns it and arrange for its
delivery to the desired location. Requesters are
notified whether or not the item is found, or if it is
found but cannot circulate.
Registered participants in the U.C. Berkeley/
Stanford Research Library Cooperative Program
(see "Sharing Library Resources") may also re
quest that FASTBOOK search for and retrieve
the item from the Berkeley library collections if it
is unavailable at Stanford.

Interlibrary Loan

No single university library, even one as large and
comprehensive as Stanford's, can contain in its
collections all of the recorded information needed
by its faculty and graduate students to pursue their
research. National and even international inter
library agreements, long established for the
mutual support of exceptional research needs,
continue to be relied upon to supplement even
the most comprehensive research collections.
Located in Room 15 1 on the first floor of the
East Wing of the Green Library, the University
Libraries' Interlibrary Loan staff processes re
quests for needed material not available on
campus. Faculty, registered students and staff may
submit requests, in person only, on forms avail
able at most public service desks. (Students in
law, business, and medicine are encouraged to
make ILL requests at their respective coordinate
library.)
Interested users should be aware that most
libraries will not lend certain types of material,
such as rare, fragile, or expensive items; basic
reference or heavily-used books; or genealogical
material, newspapers, periodicals, and many
American dissertations. Many of these non
lendable items are, however, available on micro
film.
Requests may take from 2 or 3 days to 2 or 3
months to fill, depending on whether the mate
rial is available from another library in the Bay
Area or from somewhere else much farther afield.
All materials borrowed through Interlibrary
Loan must be picked up and returned to the Loan
Desk on the first floor of the Green Library, East
Wing.

Sharing Library Resources

In addition to providing traditional interlibrary
loan services, Stanford participates in several spe
cialized cooperative arrangements which facil
itate access and which broaden considerably the
range of research materials available to its
scholars.
The U.C. Berkeley/Stanford Research Library
Cooperative Program is a cooperative effort (be
gun in 1977 and grant-Rinded through 1980)
which affects many aspects of both libraries' op
erations. One of the Program's principal objec
tives is to facilitate bibliographic and physical
access to the collections of each for the faculty,
academic staff and graduate students of both in
stitutions. It also provides for cooperative deci
sion-making in the acquisition of expensive and
little-used materials.
At present, the Program provides registered
participants with reciprocal borrowing privileges
at the "other" campus, campus-to-campus deliv
ery of library materials, intercampus shuttle ser
vice and, through RLIN, immediate access to one
another's bibliographic records. Copies of
Berkeley's Serials Union Lit, and a joint keyword
index to both it and SULS, are located in library
locations throughout campus. Further informa
tion is available in a brochure entitled "More
Than the Library Next Door" or by calling 7-
1491.
