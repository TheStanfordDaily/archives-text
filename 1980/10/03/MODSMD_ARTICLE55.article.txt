Art and Architecture

The history of painting, sculpture, the graphic
arts, the decorative arts, architecture, and classi
cal archaeology are all within the scope of the Art
and Architecture Library. Located in the Cum
mings Art Building, the 105,000 volume non
circulating collection is designed primarily to sup
port graduate art research. It includes cata
logs of the work of important artists, surveys of
the art of various regions, exhibition catalogs
from the U.S. and foriegn art museums, inven
tories of architectural monuments, Festschriften,
archaeological excavation reports and museum
collection catalogs, in addition to art reference
works of all kinds.
Notable among the Library's special collec
tions are the Rowlandson Collection and the J. D.
Ch'en Collection of material on Chinese art. The
Rowlandson Collection contains fine copies of
almost all of the novels and humorous treatises
illustrated by the British artist Thomas Rowland
son (1756-1827).
Reference books and the latest issues of jour
nals are found in the Reading Room. The rest of
the collection is shelved on three stack levels
open to faculty, staff and graduate students. For
undergraduates and non-Stanford users, material
is paged from the stacks on request. Course re
serve materials for undergraduate and graduate
students are available at the front desk.

Cubberley

Located on the second floor of the Education
Building, the Cubberley Education Library
houses over 150,000 volumes which support
faculty and graduate research in the School of
Education. A staff of six, including three libra
rians, provides assistance in use of the collection
as well as advanced bibliographic advice. Auto
mated literature searching is available by appoint
ment and an RLIN terminal enables Library staff
to (1) provide bibliographic access to the holdings
of other libraries both on and off campus, (2)
determine the status of material "in-process," and
(3) provide subject and title keyword searches of
the data base.
Orientation tours and classroom bibliographic
lectures are available upon request.
The Library's collections support a wide variety
of research including the sociology, economics,
politics and anthropology of education, counsel
ing, and childhood development. The collection
consequently includes not only education mate
rial but also a substantial number of titles in the
social sciences. Specialized collections include an
extensive collection of contemporary and histor
ic college catalogs, the complete ERIC micro
fiche collection, 19th century textbooks, and a
large collection of U.S. state and local, foreign,
and international documents pertaining to edu
cation. The Library's stacks are open and a list of
recent acquisitions is published monthly.

Music

The Music Library, on the second floor of The
Knoll, houses the major collections for music
teaching, research, and performance. Holdings
include books, scores, journals, sound recordings,
microforms, and parts for chamber music ensem
ble. The Music Library is also an important source
of information for schedules and reviews of musi
cal events in the Bay Area and beyond.
The card catalog in the Music Library includes
all music books and journals regardless of their
location on campus. It is also the only catalog for
scores and recordings, since they are not listed in
the main card catalog in the Green Library. Lis
tening facilities are available in the Music
Library, as are microfilm readers and a photocopy

machine.

Downstairs, on the first floor of The Knoll, is
the Archive of Recorded Sound whose general
collections comprise classical, popular and folk
music, and spoken word recordings. Included in
the collection are tapes, discs, and cylinders from
the early 1900's to the present. Special collec
tions within the Archive include concerts and
recitals by members of the Department of Music,
public addresses given on the Stanford campus,
Project South (interviews with participants in the
civil rights movement), and early World War II
newscasts.
