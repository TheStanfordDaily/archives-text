# SCIENCE BRANCH LIBARIES
## 
### 
The bulk of the University Libraries' collections in science and engineering are
assembled in the seven major branch libraries described below. The library of the
Hopkins Marine Station is located in Pacific Grove, two hours south of the
Stanford campus; the remainder are all located on campus and range in size from
25,000 to 75,000 volumes. The combined collections comprise nearly one third of
a million volumes, and include books, journals, technical reports, theses, and other
research materials. In addition, the Frederick E. Brasch Collection on Sir Isaac
Newton and the History of Scientific Thought, housed and maintained by the
Department of Special Collections, contains 4,000 volumes for the study of the
history of science.
In each of the science branch libraries, a reference librarian is available to
provide information and bibliographic assistance in the use of the collections. Each
branch has photocopy facilities and terminals for access to the RLIN data base.
Since the summer of 1978, computerized literature searching has been available to
the Stanford scientific community. Data files such as Chemical Abstracts, Physics
Abstracts, Electrical and Electronic Abstracts, Biological Abstracts, the Engineer
ing Index, Science Citation Index, etc., are accessible through this service. Both
current awareness and retrospective searching is possible. Interested persons should
ask the librarian in any of the science branches or contact Harry Llull (7-4672) in
the Mathematical and Computer Science Library for more information.
