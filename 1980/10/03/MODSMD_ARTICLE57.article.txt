# Technical Reports
## 
### 
Not all of the technical reports owned
by Stanford are listed in the main card
catalog. Some are, but references may
also be found in SULS, the Government
Documents Department, and appropri
ate branch and coordinate libraries. Each
library maintains a record of the cata
loged and uncataloged technical reports
it receives.
Much important information tends to
be buried in the large number of techni
cal reports with are included in the col
lections of many of the science branch
libraries on campus. A technical report
may be a scientific paper, article, or
translation, often issued as part of a
series. Because of their large numbers,
they are often not cataloged or are cata
loged by series title only. However, the
Mathematical and Computer Sciences
and the Engineering libraries do have
complete holdings of all Stanford reports
produced by their respective groups (i.e.
Math and Computer Science depart
ments and the School of Engineering).
Among the branch libraries on campus
which collect technical reports in spe
cific subjects are the Engineering Depart
ment, the Government Documents De
partment, Branner Earth Sciences
Library, the Heffner Memorial Library,
the Jackson Library of Business, the
Mathematical and Computer Sciences
Library, the Physics Library, and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
Library. Each of these libraries collects
technical reports which relate directly to
the subject specialty of that library. Also,
the Current Periodicals and Microtexts
Room in the Green Library has a large
collection of energy reports on micro
fiche. Users of technical reports may wish
to consult the Directory of Technical
Reports at Stanford which lists the major
technical report series and collections
currently received at Stanford. Copies
are available at the Reference Desk in the
Green Library and in appropriate branch
and coordinate libraries.
