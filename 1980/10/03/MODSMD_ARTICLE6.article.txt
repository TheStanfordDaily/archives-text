# Iraqis store warplanes in Arab states
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington Most planes of the
Iraqi air force — inc luding almost all
ot its Soviet-made bombers and
fighter-bombers — have been dis
persed among friendly Arab states in
the Middle East to prevent their de
struction in raids by Iran's longer
range U.S. aircraft, analysts and offi
cials disclosed here yesterday.
This dispersal explains the puzzl
ing absence of close air support for
Iraqi troops, air officials agreed, as
well as Iranian warnings to its Arab
neighbors not to help Iraq in the war.
More significantly, the unused re
serve force of more than 200 aircraft
gives the Iraqis "a trump card to
play," it they choose, in the continu
ing war, one official said. The Iraqi air
force totaled }40 combat aircratt be
fore the war, of which about 250 are
reported to be at foreign bases.
Haven for the Iraqi planes has
been provided at airfields in Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and )ordan,
the otticials said. When four sophis
ticated U.S. radar early-warning air
cratt arrived this week in Saudi
Arabia, the Iraqi planes had been
moved from the fields the U.S.
planes would use to avoid any ap
pearance of collusion, the officials
said.
The Iv policv is one of strict
neutrality in the Iraq-Iran war Some
U.S. analv sts said the dispersal of the
planes, which also included trans
ports and some interceptors, began
about a week before the outbreak of
war on Sept 22, and was preceded by
diplomatic exchanges between
Baghdad and (lie receptive states.
The analvsts said that the United
States knew of those moves Irom
their start. Other sources insisted,
however, that the planes were dis
persed only after the fighting started
and that the administration "was very
much taken off guard, again."
