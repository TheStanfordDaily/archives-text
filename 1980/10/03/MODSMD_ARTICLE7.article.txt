# Loans improve, scholarships increase
## Financial aid possibilities good 
### J. Raymond Mills 
Recent improvements in the av
ailability of federal student loans, as
well as an almost-$1 million increase
in the amount of scholarship money
the University will award this year,
are presenting a fairly optimistic out
look to financial aids recipients here
â€” despite spiraling tuition costs.
All financial aid at Stanford falls
into two general categories: gift aid
and self-help. Gift aid includes scho
larships and grants which require no
repayment. Self-help includes loans
and student employment.
According to Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon, 800 entering stu
dents, or 51 percent of the freshman
class, will receive some kind of fi
nancial aid.
This represents an increase of only
one percent from last year, but tui
tion increases are making it neces

sary for students on financial aid to
require more assistance to meet the
higher costs.
In 1980-81, Stanford students will
receive more than $7.4 million in
University gift aid, a 14 percent in
crease over the $6.5 million granted
in scholarships last year.
According to Stanford's Operating
Budget Guidelines for 1980-81, stu
dent aid in the form of scholarships
and grants will demand a full 5 per
cent of the University's total operat
ing budget.
Some additional relief in rising
educational costs came when the
Middle Income Student Assistance
Act of 1978 was signed into law.
This bill removed parental income
from the criteria in applying for a
Federally Insured Student Loan,
making it possible for any enrolled
student to receive these loans.
The interest rate on this type of
loan is 7 percent, but the interest is
paid by the federal government as
long as the recipient is at least a half
time student. Repayment does not
have to begin until 9 months after
graduation.
Since this bill went into effect, the
number of Stanford student applica
tions for loans under the HSL prog
ram has increased significantly each
year.
In 1978-79, 1744 graduate and un
dergraduate students obtained loans
totaling $3.5 million dollars. The
number of students granted a loan
through the FISL program in 1979-80
nearly doubled, with 3327 applicants
receiving upwards of $8.3 million in
these long-term loans.
Financial aids officials here predict
this figure will continue to rise as
more students and their families
begin to feel the effects of inflated
tuition costs.
In addition to federally insured
loans, self-help in the form of Na
tional Direct Student Loans is availa
ble to students who meet certain
demonstrated need criteria.
Repayment of these loans must
also begin within nine months atter
graduation. The loans carry no in
terest fees while the recipient is en

rolled as a graduate or undergrad,
and the interest charged is only 3
percent once repayment begins.
Dr. Robert Fluff, director of finan
cial aids at Stanford and former pres
ident of the National Association of
Student Financial Aid administrators,
indicated legislation now awaiting
President Jimmy Carter's signature
would extend the FISL program
which is due to expire shortly.
The only significant change in the
conditions of the loans will be that
the interest rates will jump from 7 to 9
percent. The NDSL program, whose
future was the subject of hot debate
in the House of Representatives and
Senate, will also be extended under
the same bill. Interest rates in this
loan program, currently at 3 percent,
will be increased to 4 percent.
Moreover, the default rate on
these types of loans has decreased
markedly from around 20 percent
several years ago to the current 10
percent default rate as a result of the
federal government's decision to
begin taking some responsibility for
the collection of federally-sponsored
loans.
Although loan funds will be readily
available under these initiatives
through private lending institutions
and Stanford's Financial Aids Office,
Linda Bradford, a University financial
aids counselor, cautions increased
paper tlow is causing banks par
ticipating in the program to impose
strict deadlines in an effort to expe
dite the loan process.
Huff suggested Stanford students
are fortunate that the University is
still able to meet 100 percent of calcu
lated financial aid needs, an
achievement few schools have been
able to duplicate.
He also asserted there has been no
change in the University's
philosophy that every student
should have the chance to select a
school based on academic rather
than financial considerations, and
that schools should select their stu
dents on the basis of academic and
personal promise, not the ability to
pay.
