## Soviets fail to unify Afghanistan Party feud incites attacks 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi — When the only movie house in
Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, was
fire-bombed one night last month, some people
blamed it on guerrilla insurgents.
But Atghans were convinced that the incident
was part of a vicious feud within the ruling
People's Democratic Party.
The party teud, like the guerrilla insurgency,
continues to escalate despite Soviet attempts to
bring it under control.
Combined membership in the party's two tac -
tions accounts for less than 0.5 percent of Af
ghanistan's 17 million people, but the split
poses a major problem for the Soviets who are
trying to put together a government with some
degree of public support.
Political observers familiar with the dispute
believe that the teud will get worse no matter
what the Soviets do. In tact, these sources cite
the Soviets' persistence in trying to bring the
rival factions together as a measure ot just how
badly they have misjudged the situation.
Many argue that since the Soviets invaded the
country last December and installed Babrak
Karmal as president, some in the party's so
called khalqi faction have moved closer to the
guerrilla resistance movement than toward re
conciliation with karmal's Parcham taction.
Marxism as a vehicle
The numerically dominant khalqis — 30,000 as
opposed to about 2,(X)0 Parchamites, according
to a recent assessment — in many ways repre
sent a rural-based, egalitarian movement whose
prime goals are to raise the level of Pushtun
culture and to destroy the corrupt, feudal lead
ership that has long ruled Afghanistan's villages.
Its ranks are dominated by unsophisticated,
partially educated nationalistic young men who
accepted and understood Marxism more as a
vehicle tor achieving their own goals than as
separate ideology.
International order
The better educated, more refined, urban
based Parchamites see their ideology in terms ot
a march toward an international socialist order.
They view their khalqi comrades contemptu
ously as ham-fisted and crude.
The contempt is reciprocal. The aristocratic
background of many Parchamites has prompted
the khalqis todub Karmal and his followers "The
Royal Communist Party."
The founders of the two groups mirror their
tollowings. The late Nur Mohammed Taraki, a
largely self-educated teacher-cum-poet, came
from a poor, rural family, karmal, an articulate
former member of Parliament, is the son of a
general who served in the former king's army.
When Taraki came to power in 1978, one ot his
principal tasks was to convert the business ot
government to Pushtu. State-controlled news

papers and ministerial speeches for the first
time emphasized Pushtu. The number of
Pushto-speaking Cabinet ministers and deputy
Cabinet ministers rose from 25 to 50 under
Taraki while Dari-speaking Pushtuns ot similar
rank dropped from 30 to 6.
Parchamites, who look upon the khalqi desire
to spread Pushtu as fascist, quickly reversed the
process after coming to power last December.
karmal led his Parchamites out ot the party
and set up a parallel group that, with its more
progressive, international outlook, quickly
earned a reputation as being pro-Moscow.
Alliance falls
Three years ago, opposition to the rule ot
President Mohammed Daoud and their quest
tor power brought the khalqi and Parcham fac
tions back into a shaky alliance, but it quickly tell
apart alter the military ousted Daoud the follow
ing year.
Taraki was installed as president and Hatizul
lah Amin as his first minister. Then the khalqis
began a purge ot the Parchamites.
karmal. who was at first Taraki's deputy prime
minister was exiled as ambassador to Prague.
Other Parchamite leaders were given similar as
signments. Lesser figures were imprisoned and
tortured.
Soviet force backfires
Ruthless khalqi reprisals generated the
nationwide grassroots revolt that eventually
brought on the Soviet intervention.
The Soviet recipe tor stability in Afghanistan,
based on party unity under the more conciliat
ory karmal, seemed logical at first. But the move
quickly backfired.
Popularity gains achieved by halting radical
programs were offset many times over by kar
mal's new image as the man who brought in the
Soviets.
Attempts at forcing party unity tailed. The in
herent Afghan desire to settle personal scores
prevailed over the logic of unity against a com
mon enemy. At the Cabinet level, within the
bureaucracy and on the streets, khalqis began
working against the Parchamites.
Purge ineffective
Six months after karmal was installed to re
concile the nation and the party, the Soviets
apparently gave up on the unity efforts and un
leashed karmal to rid his government of the
most troublesome khalqis.
But the purge at the top has failed to stop
terrorism at lower levels.
There have even been some reports ot contact
between khalqis and rebel leaders, exploring a
possible alliance against the karmal regime.
Most political observers view such an alliance
as highly unlikely, but any permanent patching
up of differences between the party's two fac
tions seems even less likely.

They view their khalqi comrades contemptu
ously as ham-fisted and crude.
The contempt is reciprocal. The aristocratic
background of many Parchamites has prompted
the khalqis todub Karmal and his followers "The
Royal Communist Party."
The founders of the two groups mirror their
tollowings. The late Nur Mohammed Taraki, a
largely self-educated teacher-cum-poet, came
from a poor, rural family, karmal, an articulate
former member of Parliament, is the son of a
general who served in the former king's army.
When Taraki came to power in 1978, one ot his
principal tasks was to convert the business ot
government to Pushtu. State-controlled news

papers and ministerial speeches for the first
time emphasized Pushtu. The number of
Pushto-speaking Cabinet ministers and deputy
Cabinet ministers rose from 25 to 50 under
Taraki while Dari-speaking Pushtuns ot similar
rank dropped from 30 to 6.
Parchamites, who look upon the khalqi desire
to spread Pushtu as fascist, quickly reversed the
process after coming to power last December.
karmal led his Parchamites out ot the party
and set up a parallel group that, with its more
progressive, international outlook, quickly
earned a reputation as being pro-Moscow.
Alliance falls
Three years ago, opposition to the rule ot
President Mohammed Daoud and their quest
tor power brought the khalqi and Parcham fac
tions back into a shaky alliance, but it quickly tell
apart alter the military ousted Daoud the follow
ing year.
Taraki was installed as president and Hatizul
lah Amin as his first minister. Then the khalqis
began a purge ot the Parchamites.
karmal. who was at first Taraki's deputy prime
minister was exiled as ambassador to Prague.
Other Parchamite leaders were given similar as
signments. Lesser figures were imprisoned and
tortured.
Soviet force backfires
Ruthless khalqi reprisals generated the
nationwide grassroots revolt that eventually
brought on the Soviet intervention.
The Soviet recipe tor stability in Afghanistan,
based on party unity under the more conciliat
ory karmal, seemed logical at first. But the move
quickly backfired.
Popularity gains achieved by halting radical
programs were offset many times over by kar
mal's new image as the man who brought in the
Soviets.
Attempts at forcing party unity tailed. The in
herent Afghan desire to settle personal scores
prevailed over the logic of unity against a com
mon enemy. At the Cabinet level, within the
bureaucracy and on the streets, khalqis began
working against the Parchamites.
Purge ineffective
Six months after karmal was installed to re
concile the nation and the party, the Soviets
apparently gave up on the unity efforts and un
leashed karmal to rid his government of the
most troublesome khalqis.
But the purge at the top has failed to stop
terrorism at lower levels.
There have even been some reports ot contact
between khalqis and rebel leaders, exploring a
possible alliance against the karmal regime.
Most political observers view such an alliance
as highly unlikely, but any permanent patching
up of differences between the party's two fac
tions seems even less likely.
New Delhi — When the only movie house in
Kandahar, Afghanistan's second-largest city, was
fire-bombed one night last month, some people
blamed it on guerrilla insurgents.
But Atghans were convinced that the incident
was part of a vicious feud within the ruling
People's Democratic Party.
The party teud, like the guerrilla insurgency,
continues to escalate despite Soviet attempts to
bring it under control.
Combined membership in the party's two tac -
tions accounts for less than 0.5 percent of Af
ghanistan's 17 million people, but the split
poses a major problem for the Soviets who are
trying to put together a government with some
degree of public support.
Political observers familiar with the dispute
believe that the teud will get worse no matter
what the Soviets do. In tact, these sources cite
the Soviets' persistence in trying to bring the
rival factions together as a measure ot just how
badly they have misjudged the situation.
Many argue that since the Soviets invaded the
country last December and installed Babrak
Karmal as president, some in the party's so
called khalqi faction have moved closer to the
guerrilla resistance movement than toward re
conciliation with karmal's Parcham taction.
Marxism as a vehicle
The numerically dominant khalqis — 30,000 as
opposed to about 2,(X)0 Parchamites, according
to a recent assessment — in many ways repre
sent a rural-based, egalitarian movement whose
prime goals are to raise the level of Pushtun
culture and to destroy the corrupt, feudal lead
ership that has long ruled Afghanistan's villages.
Its ranks are dominated by unsophisticated,
partially educated nationalistic young men who
accepted and understood Marxism more as a
vehicle tor achieving their own goals than as
separate ideology.
International order
The better educated, more refined, urban
based Parchamites see their ideology in terms ot
a march toward an international socialist order.
They view their khalqi comrades contemptu
ously as ham-fisted and crude.
