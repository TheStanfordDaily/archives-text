# U.S. was unprepared for Gulf conflict

### Agence France-Presse 
Washington — The war between Iraq and
Iran has shown up the weakness of U.S.
Intelligence services in the Gull region,
sources linked to the field said here.
When fighting between Iranian and
Iraqi forces erupted on a large scale last
week, military experts here gave the im
pression of being surprised by the turn of
events.
' t 'Our intelligence-gathering abilities are
not any more what they used be," a high
ranking Pentagon official said.
In certain cases, sources said here, U.S.
officials got their first intormation on fight
ing and air raids from the press many
hours before receiving confirmation trom
their own services.

U.S. military experts' analyses of the
Iranian army's capacities also were shown
to be at least partly false. Believing that
Tehran's forces had been undermined by
mass desertions, purges and the U.S. em
bargo on spare parts, they were suprised
by the Iranians' capacity to resist the invad
ing Iraqis.
The experts had not expected the Ira
nian air force to be capable of hitting
targets deep inside Iraq as they have been
doing. It appears that at least half of Iran's
190F-4andlso F-5 tighter-bombers are still
operational.
The weakness of its intelligence services
explains in part Washington's discretion
regarding the outbreak of full-scale hos
tilities in the Gulf area.

U.S. officials apparently lacked reliable
intormation on the two armies' logistics
capacities and the morale of their troops
and hesitated to make any predictions.
Because of linguistic and cultural dif
ficulties, many years are required to pre
pare agents to work in the Gulf region.
"We are weak in the bazaars, on the
campuses, in the streets, where the life ot a
nation takes place," a high-ranking ad
ministration official admitted.
Certain experts have already suggested
that the lack of U.S. operatives in the area
was probably one of the causes of the fai
lure of the military raid conducted by the
Pentagon in April to tree U.S. diplomats
held hostage in Tehran.
