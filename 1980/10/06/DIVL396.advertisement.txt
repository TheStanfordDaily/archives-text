"9/10 of the girls in California are
beautiful, and the 10th one goes
to Stanford."
The real beauty at the Stanford
women's Center is the opportunity
forgrowth and community-building
there, women of all kinds
cooperatively decide what to do and
how to do it, and this fall volunteer
or workstudy students are needed
at once to organize, publicize, and '
budget programs, gather .
resources, network, and coordinate 1, 1 >
rape prevention education on
campus. Starting pay for workstudy
is $3.50, but the richest benefits for
undergrads are personal and
political satisfaction of changing
Stanford university and maybe the
world.
For information call 497-0545 or
the Office of Student Activities at
497-3542. Applications now
available.
