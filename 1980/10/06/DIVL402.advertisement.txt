Where does science fiction end and
reality begin? It's all in the mind's eye.
Be it the creative imagination used to
produce Star Wars, The Black Hole, and
The Empire Strikes Back, or the more
scientific approach of hypothesis test
ing and experimentation, the distant
galaxies of science fiction coalesce into
reality with the advanced technology
now being developed at a company
called TRW.
It was the Defense and Space Systems
Group of TRW who made possible the
Viking Lander biological experiment
which looked for life on Mars and the
High Energy Astronomical Observatory
which looks for quasars, pulsars and
black holes in deep space. Profession
als at TRW-DSSG are now involved in
such impressive technologies as high
energy lasers, communications systems,
plus other future projects still consider
ed science fiction.
A company called TRW will be on
campus...
