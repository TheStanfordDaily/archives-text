or
For years you've been
proving to your pro
fessors just how good
you are. Now it's time
to prove it to yourself.
With a higher
challenge. With
Tfexas Instruments.
Prove yourself where innovation's
the rule, not the exception.
As a matter of corporate policy, TI has
built-in budgets for new, innovative ideas. If
you have a revolutionary concept that
deserves to be put to the test, the money's
there.
That's just part of the TI challenge.
Prove yourself in the world's "hot"
technologies.
No technology is hotter, or more fan
tastic, tham microelectronics. And no com
pany is hotter in it than TI.
Example: The TI 59 handheld calculator
has more than twice the primary memory
capacity of the three-ton computers of the
19505.
And look at these credentials. TI is:
• The world's leading supplier of
semiconductors.
The patent holder for
the single-chip
microcomputer and
the handheld elec
tronic calculator.
The designer and
producer of the most
complex MOS chip
and the most popular microcomputer.
• The inventor of solid-state voice synthesis.
• The largest producer of microelectronic
memory products.
• The world leader in Very Large Scale
Integration.
• The primary supplier of airborne radars to
the U.S. defense program.
• The leading developer and producer of in
frared and laser systems.
• The world's foremost geophysical survey
company.
Prove to yourself where you have
the freedom to grow.
Because TI is like many companies in
one, you have the opportunity to move
laterally from one specialty to another as
well as move up. Without changing jobs.
Tl's advanced
system for lateral
career mobility lets you
move up faster.
Because the freedom
to move sideways is
the best way to com-
® pare technologies and
define career goals early on.
The frequently published TI Job Oppor
tunity Bulletin lists openings at all TI
facilities and gives TI people first crack
at them.
Prove yourself where it counts.
TI has been acclaimed as one of
America's best-managed companies be
cause we've stayed young and vital while
growing big.
One major reason for our high energy is
our move-up environment. New people don't
get buried at the bottom of a pecking order,
because there isn't one. So if you get a good
idea your first week on the job, it gets
heard. And you get rewarded.
At TI, you get
every chance to show
what you can do. And
prove what you deserve.
Prove yourself in
an international
company.
TI has hometowns in 19 countries on six
continents. You'll find manufacturing in
Singapore. Dallas. Tbkyo. Nice. Buenos Aires.
And many other cities around the globe.
TI has hometowns to match your
lifestyle. No matter where you call home.
From New England to Ifexas to California.

For years you've been
proving to your pro
fessors just how good
you are. Now it's time
to prove it to yourself.
With a higher
challenge. With
Tfexas Instruments.
Prove yourself where innovation's
the rule, not the exception.
As a matter of corporate policy, TI has
built-in budgets for new, innovative ideas. If
you have a revolutionary concept that
deserves to be put to the test, the money's
there.
That's just part of the TI challenge.
Prove yourself in the world's "hot"
technologies.
No technology is hotter, or more fan
tastic, tham microelectronics. And no com
pany is hotter in it than TI.
Example: The TI 59 handheld calculator
has more than twice the primary memory
capacity of the three-ton computers of the
19505.
And look at these credentials. TI is:
• The world's leading supplier of
semiconductors.
The patent holder for
the single-chip
microcomputer and
the handheld elec
tronic calculator.
The designer and
producer of the most
complex MOS chip
and the most popular microcomputer.
• The inventor of solid-state voice synthesis.
• The largest producer of microelectronic
memory products.
• The world leader in Very Large Scale
Integration.
• The primary supplier of airborne radars to
the U.S. defense program.
• The leading developer and producer of in
frared and laser systems.
• The world's foremost geophysical survey
company.
Prove to yourself where you have
the freedom to grow.
Because TI is like many companies in
one, you have the opportunity to move
laterally from one specialty to another as
well as move up. Without changing jobs.
Tl's advanced
system for lateral
career mobility lets you
move up faster.
Because the freedom
to move sideways is
the best way to com-
® pare technologies and
define career goals early on.
The frequently published TI Job Oppor
tunity Bulletin lists openings at all TI
facilities and gives TI people first crack
at them.
Prove yourself where it counts.
TI has been acclaimed as one of
America's best-managed companies be
cause we've stayed young and vital while
growing big.
One major reason for our high energy is
our move-up environment. New people don't
get buried at the bottom of a pecking order,
because there isn't one. So if you get a good
idea your first week on the job, it gets
heard. And you get rewarded.
At TI, you get
every chance to show
what you can do. And
prove what you deserve.
Prove yourself in
an international
company.
TI has hometowns in 19 countries on six
continents. You'll find manufacturing in
Singapore. Dallas. Tbkyo. Nice. Buenos Aires.
And many other cities around the globe.
TI has hometowns to match your
lifestyle. No matter where you call home.
From New England to Ifexas to California.
