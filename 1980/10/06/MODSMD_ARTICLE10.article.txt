# Pension rights granted in Nigeria
## 
### Washington Post 
Lagos, Nigeria — In a clear effort to heal
the still festering wounds of the decade
old Nigerian civil war, President Saehu
Shagari Wednesday granted federal pen
sion rights previously denied to thousands
of civil service servants in the old rebel
state of Biafra.
As Nigeria's first civilian president after
13 years of military government, Shagari
made his surprise announcement as part
of efforts to strengthen the formerly
frayed political fabric of this most power
ful of black African nations.
Shagari, in his characteristic low-key
style, has consistently avoided the con
frontation politics of post-independence
that led to violent civil turbulence, military
rule and, finally, a bitterly fought civil war.
Nigeria today, as a major exporter of oil,
is one of his continent's richest countries.
It is also the most populous, with more
than 90 million people divided into some
250 contentious ethnic groups, a condi
tion that Shagari alluded to Wednesday.
Shagari's speech was characterized by
Nigerian observers as the strongest yet de
livered by the soft-spoken, generally
cautious 55-year-old politician. Wednes
day was the first anniversary of Shagari's
civilian government and Nigeria's 20th an
niversary of independence.
Resistance to change
Besides the olive branch offered to
Nigeria's eastern population of the former
Biafran rebel state, Shagari issued a sec
ond appeal in less than a year for the end
of "political victimization" by "Fanatics"

that has led to an unknown number of
killings. He admonished the civil service,
often described as inert, that those resist
ing his policy directives will be fired.
"The government is Nigeria's principal
employer. Shagari has encountered resis
tance to change on the part of high-level
civil servants carried over from past milit
ary governments. This problem is compli
cated by the divided ethnic, regional and
political loyalties.
Other than the Ibos of former Biafra, the
other two major ethnic groups are the
northern Hausa-Fulani and the western
Vorubas. The three groups comprise 60
percent of the population.
Self-sufficiency
The country's oil revenues have more
than doubled in the past two years, to an
estimated $25 billion for this year, and
Shagari's government has embarked on an
ambitious program of agricultural self
sufficiency and industrialization
Since independence from Britain in
1960, Nigeria has been tenuously held to
gether despite three military coups, one
bloody attempted coup and the 2'/2-year
civil war that cost an estimated million
lives when the eastern Ibos tried to sec
ede. The war ended with Biafra's defeat in
1970.
The army, which took power amidst
political turbulence in 1966, voluntarily
handed over to Shagari's elected govern
ment one year ago.
Shagari, in his speech broadcast early
Wednesday morning, said he was restor
ing pension rights to the thousands of

rebel civil servants "cut off in the former
eastern regions during the period of the
civil war."
Rehabilitation efforts
These civil servants, continued Shagari,
"though subsequently re-absorbed into
the service, were told that the period dur
ing which they were cut off was to be
counted as lost for purposes of pension
entitlements. I have now given a new di
rective that this period should be regarded
as leave without pay on grounds of public
policy and therefore pensionable,"
Shagari added.
Two state governors of the former Biaf
ran heartland, Jim Nwobodo and Samuel
Moakwe of Awambra and Imo states re
spectively, have been vociferously critical
over the past year of what they say has
been a lack of rehabilitation efforts for the
formerly war-torn region both on the part
of the former military government and
Shagari's.
His government, Shagari added, has
"succeeded in diffusing tension, preserv
ing peace, stability and national unity in
spite of seemingly insurmountable odds."
At its inception, both Western and Nige
rian political observers said they would be
surprised if political turbulence did not
revive within the first year. It has not.
Shagari leaves Nigeria Thursday for New
York and Washington on his first official
trip outside Africa since taking office. He
will address the United Nations General
Assembly and visit with President limmy
Carter during his week-long stay in the
United States.

often described as inert, that those resist

"The government is Nigeria's principal
employer. Shagari has encountered resis
tance to change on the part of high-level
civil servants carried over from past milit
ary governments. This problem is compli
cated by the divided ethnic, regional and
political loyalties.
Other than the Ibos of former Biafra, the
other two major ethnic groups are the
northern Hausa-Fulani and the western
Vorubas. The three groups comprise 60
percent of the population.
Self-sufficiency
The country's oil revenues have more
than doubled in the past two years, to an
estimated $25 billion for this year, and
Shagari's government has embarked on an
ambitious program of agricultural self
sufficiency and industrialization
Since independence from Britain in
1960, Nigeria has been tenuously held to
gether despite three military coups, one
bloody attempted coup and the 2'/2-year
civil war that cost an estimated million
lives when the eastern Ibos tried to sec
ede. The war ended with Biafra's defeat in
1970.
The army, which took power amidst
political turbulence in 1966, voluntarily
handed over to Shagari's elected govern
ment one year ago.
Shagari, in his speech broadcast early
Wednesday morning, said he was restor
ing pension rights to the thousands of

rebel civil servants "cut off in the former
eastern regions during the period of the
civil war."
Rehabilitation efforts
These civil servants, continued Shagari,
"though subsequently re-absorbed into
the service, were told that the period dur
ing which they were cut off was to be
counted as lost for purposes of pension
entitlements. I have now given a new di
rective that this period should be regarded
as leave without pay on grounds of public
policy and therefore pensionable,"
Shagari added.
Two state governors of the former Biaf
ran heartland, Jim Nwobodo and Samuel
Moakwe of Awambra and Imo states re
spectively, have been vociferously critical
over the past year of what they say has
been a lack of rehabilitation efforts for the
formerly war-torn region both on the part
of the former military government and
Shagari's.
His government, Shagari added, has
"succeeded in diffusing tension, preserv
ing peace, stability and national unity in
spite of seemingly insurmountable odds."
At its inception, both Western and Nige
rian political observers said they would be
surprised if political turbulence did not
revive within the first year. It has not.
Shagari leaves Nigeria Thursday for New
York and Washington on his first official
trip outside Africa since taking office. He
will address the United Nations General
Assembly and visit with President limmy
Carter during his week-long stay in the
United States.
Lagos, Nigeria — In a clear effort to heal
the still festering wounds of the decade
old Nigerian civil war, President Saehu
Shagari Wednesday granted federal pen
sion rights previously denied to thousands
of civil service servants in the old rebel
state of Biafra.
As Nigeria's first civilian president after
13 years of military government, Shagari
made his surprise announcement as part
of efforts to strengthen the formerly
frayed political fabric of this most power
ful of black African nations.
Shagari, in his characteristic low-key
style, has consistently avoided the con
frontation politics of post-independence
that led to violent civil turbulence, military
rule and, finally, a bitterly fought civil war.
Nigeria today, as a major exporter of oil,
is one of his continent's richest countries.
It is also the most populous, with more
than 90 million people divided into some
250 contentious ethnic groups, a condi
tion that Shagari alluded to Wednesday.
Shagari's speech was characterized by
Nigerian observers as the strongest yet de
livered by the soft-spoken, generally
cautious 55-year-old politician. Wednes
day was the first anniversary of Shagari's
civilian government and Nigeria's 20th an
niversary of independence.
Resistance to change
Besides the olive branch offered to
Nigeria's eastern population of the former
Biafran rebel state, Shagari issued a sec
ond appeal in less than a year for the end
of "political victimization" by "Fanatics"

that has led to an unknown number of
killings. He admonished the civil service,
often described as inert, that those resist
ing his policy directives will be fired.
