# ARLO provides research, job opportunities
## 
### Sally Newman 
The vast majority of students newand
not so new to the Farm often seem to
feel it is possible —even probable— to
spend all four undergraduate years
without gaining experience in the "real
world," that uncharted land beyond
the eucalyptus trees. The Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO) aims to
reverse this attitude.
ARLO enables students to volunteer
part-time with a non-profit organiza
tion whose purpose is generally related
to social action. In an era of diminishing
material resources, programs dealing
with energy and the environment have
proved most popular since ARLO's in
ception in 1974.
Dr. Cissie Rafferty, campus ARLO
coordinator, emphasized that the posi
tions offered are no ordinary part-time
student intern jobs. "The positions are
always responsible; no one merely
works in an office," she explained.
Getting involved in an ARLO project
is a multi-step, though relatively sim
ple, process. After choosing a program
from among the offerings in the catalog
students may arrange for an interview
with the project director.
About half of the projects are actually
undertaken, with the interview serving

to clarify the scope of the student's
proposed involvement.
Once an agreement has been
reached, students need only confirm
the details with Rafferty and procure
faculty sponsorship of the project.
"Sometimes we really have to dig to
find a professor who will serve as spon
sor, but I don't remember ever not
being able to find someone," said Raf
ferty.
All projects are undertaken for one to
five academic units per quarter, the
program requires "something substan
tive," such as writing an instruction
manual or formulating policy decisions
for completion.
To a large extent, the student must
decide the best way to research and
handle the task. The sponsoring group
is available at all times however, to pro
vide necessary advice and aid.
Offering positions with a diversity of
organizations such as Mid Peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the Herbert
Hoover Boys's Club, and the Palo Alto
Planning Department, ARLO sponsors
fieldwork from San Francisco to San
Jose and beyond.
However ARLO draws primarily
from groups in the Palo Alto area, which

is more accessible to students, several
project sites are on campus.
Over 170 ARLO projects are available
this year to any interested student. In
most cases, no special skills are
needed, nor is prior experience a factor
in selection. "You may have a little
more experience when you're older,"
commented Marci Thiel, a junior, "but
you learn as you go."
Thiel, a human biology major two
years ago worked with the San jose
Juvenile Department in the Substance
Abuse Program, which deals with nar
cotics first offenders. While working
with the young people, she saw a need
for a booklet addressing the issue from
their view.
"Everything published then was
either too scanty or overtechnical,"
said Thiel. The pamphlet she wrote is
now used throughout the San Jose Un
ified School District, and plans are
being made to use it elsewhere in the
state.
ARLO projects frequently lead stu
dents to an increased interest in a major
or career goal and provide oppor
tunities to work full-time for several
months at a project.
After earning credit for teaching at
the Marine Ecological Institute in a sci

ence enrichment program for children,
senior Graham Billingham stopped out
for spring quarter 1978 to work on his
program. Scripps Oceanography Insti
tuted San Diego, has sinceoffered him
a full-time teaching job.
Participants often get tangible results
when their work includes policy forma
tion. Projects may lead to other slightly
different projects.
A graduate in environmental en
gineering, Bob Wenzlau began by
working to promote water conserva
tion. A study of municipal composting
in Palo Alto followed. Today, the
curbside recycling system which he
implemented as coordinator of the ci
ty's recycling program has cut residen
tial solid waste by 22 percent. It is now
being studied for possible adoption
nationwide.
"If one is always learning some
abstract theory or concept but not ap
plying it to real life,"says David Aber
nethy, associate dean of undergraduate
studies and one of four faculty mem
bers on ARLO's policy board, "in some
sense you haven't learned the con
cepts."
ARLO was created six years ago to fill
a need perceived by both students and
faculty.

proposed involvement.
Once an agreement has been
reached, students need only confirm
the details with Rafferty and procure
faculty sponsorship of the project.
"Sometimes we really have to dig to
find a professor who will serve as spon
sor, but I don't remember ever not
being able to find someone," said Raf
ferty.
All projects are undertaken for one to
five academic units per quarter, the
program requires "something substan
tive," such as writing an instruction
manual or formulating policy decisions
for completion.
To a large extent, the student must
decide the best way to research and
handle the task. The sponsoring group
is available at all times however, to pro

Offering positions with a diversity of
organizations such as Mid Peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the Herbert
Hoover Boys's Club, and the Palo Alto
Planning Department, ARLO sponsors
fieldwork from San Francisco to San
Jose and beyond.
However ARLO draws primarily
from groups in the Palo Alto area, which

is more accessible to students, several
project sites are on campus.
Over 170 ARLO projects are available
this year to any interested student. In
most cases, no special skills are
needed, nor is prior experience a factor
in selection. "You may have a little
more experience when you're older,"
commented Marci Thiel, a junior, "but
you learn as you go."
Thiel, a human biology major two
years ago worked with the San jose
Juvenile Department in the Substance
Abuse Program, which deals with nar
cotics first offenders. While working
with the young people, she saw a need
for a booklet addressing the issue from
their view.
"Everything published then was
either too scanty or overtechnical,"
said Thiel. The pamphlet she wrote is
now used throughout the San Jose Un
ified School District, and plans are
being made to use it elsewhere in the
state.
ARLO projects frequently lead stu
dents to an increased interest in a major
or career goal and provide oppor
tunities to work full-time for several
months at a project.
After earning credit for teaching at
the Marine Ecological Institute in a sci

ence enrichment program for children,
senior Graham Billingham stopped out
for spring quarter 1978 to work on his
program. Scripps Oceanography Insti
tuted San Diego, has sinceoffered him
a full-time teaching job.
Participants often get tangible results
when their work includes policy forma
tion. Projects may lead to other slightly
different projects.
A graduate in environmental en
gineering, Bob Wenzlau began by
working to promote water conserva
tion. A study of municipal composting
in Palo Alto followed. Today, the
curbside recycling system which he
implemented as coordinator of the ci
ty's recycling program has cut residen
tial solid waste by 22 percent. It is now
being studied for possible adoption
nationwide.
"If one is always learning some
abstract theory or concept but not ap
plying it to real life,"says David Aber
nethy, associate dean of undergraduate
studies and one of four faculty mem
bers on ARLO's policy board, "in some
sense you haven't learned the con
cepts."
ARLO was created six years ago to fill
a need perceived by both students and
faculty.
The vast majority of students newand
not so new to the Farm often seem to
feel it is possible —even probable— to
spend all four undergraduate years
without gaining experience in the "real
world," that uncharted land beyond
the eucalyptus trees. The Action Re
search Liaison Office (ARLO) aims to
reverse this attitude.
ARLO enables students to volunteer
part-time with a non-profit organiza
tion whose purpose is generally related
to social action. In an era of diminishing
material resources, programs dealing
with energy and the environment have
proved most popular since ARLO's in
ception in 1974.
Dr. Cissie Rafferty, campus ARLO
coordinator, emphasized that the posi
tions offered are no ordinary part-time
student intern jobs. "The positions are
always responsible; no one merely
works in an office," she explained.
Getting involved in an ARLO project
is a multi-step, though relatively sim
ple, process. After choosing a program
from among the offerings in the catalog
students may arrange for an interview
with the project director.
About half of the projects are actually
undertaken, with the interview serving

to clarify the scope of the student's
proposed involvement.
Once an agreement has been
reached, students need only confirm
the details with Rafferty and procure
faculty sponsorship of the project.
