# Carpools bring parking freedom
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
For students with cars who
are living off campus and do
not want to pay $20 for a cam
pus parking permit, a carpool
may be the answer. Students,
as well as faculy and staff, can
form carpools and receive free
parking permits.
A carpool of two will be
given a "C" parking permitand
a carpool of three or more will
receive an "A" permit. Carpool
permits are issued at the Stan
ford Police Department. Each
member of the carpool must
bring proot of car ownership
and will then be issued a "P"
bumper sticker, indicating
carpool membership.
The group will receive one
permit card to be displayed on
the dashboard of whichever
car is driven. If more than one
member of the carpool needs
his car on campus, he can al
ways park the extra car in any of
the 50cent pay lots on campus.
According to Marvin Her
rington, director of police ser
vices, the car
pool program has been offered
for at least four years. When it
was started, the program com
plied with the state model re
quiring at least three persons

per carpool. But, for some stu
dents it was hard to find three
people whose schedules were
similar. Two years ago the prog
ram was modified so that a
two-person carpool could be
tormed. The first year the prog
ram was in effect, there were
under 20 ca'rpools. Last year
that number had increased to
over 100, said Herrington.
Carpools may reduce the
demand for parking, but Her
rington denied that there is a
parking "problem" on cam
pus. He said parking space is
always available somewhere.
The "problem" he said is that
students usually want to park
just outside their classroom
door, and this is not always
possible.
Herrington said the Margu
erite is intended to allow
people to park in the lots on
the perimeter of campus and
take the free shuttle to their
destinations. But, he said this
service has not been very
popular with students.
If students have already
purchased a permit and wish to
form a carpool they will be
given a refund for the time re
maining before their permit
expires, Herrington added.
