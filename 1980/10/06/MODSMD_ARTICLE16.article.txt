Since the heady days of Prop. 13 fever have given way to the
setback of Jams 11, there are signs that the tax cut rebellion has
reached a political dead end. The Kemp-Roth tax cut, once the
centerpiece of the Republican platform, has been progressively
toned down, as opinion polls reveal increased public mistrust of
its possible inflationary impact.
Nor is this fear unfounded. Until the political will is found to cut
government spending — and it has not been to date — there is
ample reason to expect that reduced tax revenues will only be
made up with deficit spending, thus increasing pressure for infla
tion.
Whether even Ronald Reagan has the will to achieve reduced
spending is highly dubious. Certainly there is nothing in his
record as governor to suggest this. In fact, Reagan has yet to
advance a single concrete proposal for reducing spending, al
though he has proposed numerous expensive weapons projects.
(Of course, it is just barely possible that Arthur Laffer is correct,
and that reducing taxes will actually generate increased govern
ment revenues. However, since the economists who have em
braced Lafferism are all well-known opponents of government
spending as well, it seems somehow difficult to credit their
theory.)
The problem with tax cuts seems therefore likely to remain,
namely the inability of our political system to decide what public
services to cut. In fact, the scope of the public sector has grown to
include so many important services that there is hardly any of us
who would not miss at least a few of them.
While some of these, such as roads and water projects, might
be made to pay for themselves through user charges alone, many
others are public goods, the benefits of which are at least in part
diffuse throughout society, or do not directly accrue to those
paying for them. These include defense, welfare, basic research,
certain aspects of the environment, education, etc. Attacking
government spending through tax cuts appears to threaten the
financing of these public goods, to the extent that voluntary
contributions do not make up the difference. Furthermore, even
where tax cuts are ostensibly aimed only at the "bad" or "waste
ful" programs, experience shows that legislatures do not neces
sarily carry out the voters' mandate, and that public officials
responsible for budget allocations may prefer to protect their
own jobs at the expense of more vital services.
The solution to these problems is to give the taxpayers direct
control over how their taxes are spent by granting a 100 percent
dollar-for-dollar tax credit or rebate on all contributions to char
ity, social services, sciences, the arts, education, parks, or what
ever public good, provided only that it is not of direct personal
benefit to the donor. Ideally, the sum of these credits would be
deducted from the federal budget in such a way that every addi
tional dollar contributed, say, to Stanford, would be one less
dollar available to the Department of Education. Such a system
would go far beyond the current system of tax-deductible
charities, which is useful only to the 30 percent of all taxpayers
who itemize deductions, and then only to the partial extent of the

tax on the contributed income.
The advantages of a full tax credit system would be enormous.
Charity, the arts, education and science would flourish without
the drawbacks of government control. Government agencies
would also be eligible for contributions, so taxpayers might allo
cate more or less of their money to whatever they liked — NASA,
urban development, or even the MX missile. Of course, the
difference would be that all government programs would hence
forth be open to competition. The Department of Health and
Human Services would not have a monopoly on anti-poverty
programs: other organizations could compete for taxpayers' dol
lars with more innovative, stimulating, and less wasteful anti
poverty activities than Congress is likely to pass.
The tax credit system would also help mitigate conflict over
sociallydivisiveissues. Contributions could be made toabortions
for welfare mothers without everyone having to pay. Ultimately,
even the nation's defense and foreign affairs could be de
monopolized: wars could be fought without forcing pacifists to
pay-
There are obviously many serious and complex issues to be
resolved before a full tax credit system can be implemented. It
would doubtless have to be phased in over a period of time.
Particularly serious thought must be given to the best mechanism
for adjusting government expenditures to the expected tax re
venues less credits. Means must also be established for determin
ing the overall level of public expenditures, that is, tax liabilities
before credits. Many will argue that no tax credit scheme can
permit taxpayers to write off 100 percent of their taxes; however,
given the will to embark on popular control of taxation, there is
no telling how far it might lead.
