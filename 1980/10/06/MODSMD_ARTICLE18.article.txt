## Everyone is given a label 
### 
On the desk sat 63 plain glass
jars, devoid of labels, undistin
guished, anonymous. Each
placidly entombed some vari
ety of pickled creature, a wing,
veined toot, gill or feathered
antennae pressed firmly against
the glass. Some of the contents
rather reminded me of ar
tichoke hearts for sale along
supermarket aisles.
These were the prey. We
were the entranced, yet re
volted hunters.
"You are searching," en
toned the introductory biology
teacher. "Youaresearchingfor
an identity. You will peerat the
nooks and crannies and colors
and shapes and feathered tea
tures and you will give these
creatures a name. You will
characterize," he urged.
"Characterization is the heart
of science! Once an organism
is given a label, a place, a fam
ily, it can become an old
friend."
Yet I doubted the plausibility
of friendship with an artichoke
heart.
The human inclination to
characterize is one of the most
pervasive in our lives. Like it or
not, labels are applied to us
from birth. Simply from exter
nal features, each of us is put
into a category such as male or
female, black or white, large or
small. The legacy of our
families determines whether
we are wealthy or poor, fam
ous or infamous. Although we
come into the world theoreti
cally with a blank slate, we
soon learn that with each of
these labels that have been so
rapidly applied comes a whole
standard of behavior and ex
pectations that are inseparably
associated with the characteri
zation.
Children learn early that a
label is something which
adheres more firmly that
Krazy-glue. They learn to oper
ate within their labels. Exter
nally imposed labels help toes

tablish the intellectual stratum
in the schools: in this corner,
the reading Butterflys will
meet, however, all you pokey
Bunnies should hop on over to
the right.
It is hardly surprising that
children soon become adept
manipulators of the categoriza
tion system. They find it ideal
for establishing identity; a
reading butterfly finds that her
appellation is something of
which to be proud, something
about which Mom may call
Grandma. Inevitably, too,
children discover that
categorization is an extremely
effective exclusionary tool.
From such seemingly harmless
identities as "the big kids'
playground," to more paintul
examples of selective exclu
sion by race or reputation
("She's bad, my mom won't let
me play with her"), the nature
of categorization lends itself
well to its role as a factor of
discrimination.
Speaking from the position
of a new Stanford student,
phylum "freshmanite," I am
aware that a new opportunity
now exists for me to start out a
time at school with a slate of
reputation that is blank. I am
coming to this school with
perhaps no more pre-fixed
catagories attached to me than
those that are attached upon
birth, the simple, physical
labels.
My first inclination is delight,
and resolve never to become
too tightly tangled in the string
of labels which has intrinsically
bonded my prior life. Yet, as I
watch and participate in the
process of meeting people in
my dorm, settling in, becom
ing involved in school, I am se
eing a surprisingly strong
grappling for categorization
taking place.
People grope for a handle
with which to confront this in
credible experience of being a
single, unidentified individual
among thousands of uniden

tified others. So we begin to
test out each other, search for
what prior labels we can —
"Where are you from? East
Coaster or West?" or finding
new areas of categorization —
"What's your mapr?" The
dorm soon establishes the
"rowdies" and the "book
worms," the school itself sup
ports further fractioning by
cultural identity, providing
places and organizations to
which someone of a minority
categorization may bond.
We progressively find ourse
lves succumbing to the need to
categorize, whether it is by the
organizations we join or the
classes we take.
Thus I tind myself, far from
rebelling against such
categorization, searching it out
with strivant intensity. Frankly,
the sight of bi blank glass jars
whose contents I could judge
only by looks, totally terrifies
me. I found the science
teacher was correct in suppos
ing that we would soon adopt
his enthusiasm for giving each
organism its place. We wanted
them to be "old friends."
Categorization, I think, is in
this way not such a totally con
demnable phenomenon. The
key seems to lie in manipulat
ing a label properly. If used to
give identity rather than to
exclude either others or your
self from an unlike group,
categorization can lend sec
urity and a sense of belonging.
It can warn you that the thing to
eat is the artichoke heart and
not the octopus. It can strip
awaythe imposing nature of so
many physically transparent
but internally oblique "glass
jars."
With care, the tool disco
vered so early in childhood to
be a useful instrument in deal
ing with life, can be maturely
guided to help establish an
identity in so large and diverse
a place as Stanford.

It can warn you that the thing to

I Rebecca Fox is an undeclared

On the desk sat 63 plain glass
jars, devoid of labels, undistin
guished, anonymous. Each
placidly entombed some vari
ety of pickled creature, a wing,
veined toot, gill or feathered
antennae pressed firmly against
the glass. Some of the contents
rather reminded me of ar
tichoke hearts for sale along
supermarket aisles.
These were the prey. We
were the entranced, yet re
volted hunters.
"You are searching," en
toned the introductory biology
teacher. "Youaresearchingfor
an identity. You will peerat the
nooks and crannies and colors
and shapes and feathered tea
tures and you will give these
creatures a name. You will
characterize," he urged.
"Characterization is the heart
of science! Once an organism
is given a label, a place, a fam
ily, it can become an old
friend."
Yet I doubted the plausibility
of friendship with an artichoke
heart.
The human inclination to
characterize is one of the most
pervasive in our lives. Like it or
not, labels are applied to us
from birth. Simply from exter
nal features, each of us is put
into a category such as male or
female, black or white, large or
small. The legacy of our
families determines whether
we are wealthy or poor, fam
ous or infamous. Although we
come into the world theoreti
cally with a blank slate, we
soon learn that with each of
these labels that have been so
rapidly applied comes a whole
standard of behavior and ex
pectations that are inseparably
associated with the characteri
zation.
Children learn early that a
label is something which
adheres more firmly that
Krazy-glue. They learn to oper
ate within their labels. Exter
nally imposed labels help toes

tablish the intellectual stratum
in the schools: in this corner,
the reading Butterflys will
meet, however, all you pokey
Bunnies should hop on over to
the right.
It is hardly surprising that
children soon become adept
manipulators of the categoriza
tion system. They find it ideal
for establishing identity; a
reading butterfly finds that her
appellation is something of
which to be proud, something
about which Mom may call
Grandma. Inevitably, too,
children discover that
categorization is an extremely
effective exclusionary tool.
From such seemingly harmless
identities as "the big kids'
playground," to more paintul
examples of selective exclu
sion by race or reputation
("She's bad, my mom won't let
me play with her"), the nature
of categorization lends itself
well to its role as a factor of
discrimination.
Speaking from the position
of a new Stanford student,
phylum "freshmanite," I am
aware that a new opportunity
now exists for me to start out a
time at school with a slate of
reputation that is blank. I am
coming to this school with
perhaps no more pre-fixed
catagories attached to me than
those that are attached upon
birth, the simple, physical
labels.
My first inclination is delight,
and resolve never to become
too tightly tangled in the string
of labels which has intrinsically
bonded my prior life. Yet, as I
watch and participate in the
process of meeting people in
my dorm, settling in, becom
ing involved in school, I am se
eing a surprisingly strong
grappling for categorization
taking place.
People grope for a handle
with which to confront this in
credible experience of being a
single, unidentified individual
among thousands of uniden

tified others. So we begin to
test out each other, search for
what prior labels we can —
"Where are you from? East
Coaster or West?" or finding
new areas of categorization —
"What's your mapr?" The
dorm soon establishes the
"rowdies" and the "book
worms," the school itself sup
ports further fractioning by
cultural identity, providing
places and organizations to
which someone of a minority
categorization may bond.
We progressively find ourse
lves succumbing to the need to
categorize, whether it is by the
organizations we join or the
classes we take.
Thus I tind myself, far from
rebelling against such
categorization, searching it out
with strivant intensity. Frankly,
the sight of bi blank glass jars
whose contents I could judge
only by looks, totally terrifies
me. I found the science
teacher was correct in suppos
ing that we would soon adopt
his enthusiasm for giving each
organism its place. We wanted
them to be "old friends."
Categorization, I think, is in
this way not such a totally con
demnable phenomenon. The
key seems to lie in manipulat
ing a label properly. If used to
give identity rather than to
exclude either others or your
self from an unlike group,
categorization can lend sec
urity and a sense of belonging.
