## Western Culture raises complex questions 
### 
I wish to report here to my
colleagues — both those who
teach in the Western Culture
Program and those whose
schedules have as yet kept
them from so doing — that I
have read, but have failed to
understand, the report (the
Daily , Sept. 29) of the remarks
lately made by our colleague
Professor Nannerl Keohane
about the Program.
She makes charges about the
culture of the West, the culture
she teaches, which I find in
supportable. Because I wonder
if I am alone in thinking this
way, I would like to take this
public space to pose to her
some questions:
1. "If you begin to notice the
way women were treated in
Western culture, it can give
you a way to assess the
strengths and weakness of the
works — most of which were
written by white, upper-class
males." Is she right? Could she
be right? I concede (if that's the
correct term) the whiteness of
the authors; most of them
were that way. But were they
upperclass? Was, for instance,
John Keats? He is soundly
drubbed by Professor
Keohane, but that is but the
least, and the latest, of his
many problems. The son of a
livery-stable keeper, he rose
little in his life, died young in
agony, and had only other
writers as his friends. Was Wil
liam Blake upper-class? The
evidence says no. Working en
gravers might aspire to
middle-class status, but fail to
arrive even there. How about
Shakespeare? The social status
of playwrights was that en
joyed in Elizabethan times by
other entertainers, both licit
and illicit: low. I urge Professor
Keohane to read Shakes
peare's will; it is an enumera
tion of modest items: domes
tic, few, and homely.
And is it even remotely sen
sible to speak of the social class
of, say, Boethius? What does

"class" (a term useful, I should
think, only in relatively mod
ern periods) mean when
applied to, say, Homer? To the
several authors of the Gospels?
2. Let us suppose that Pro
fessor Keohane is right,
though. Let us say that we have
successfully determined a wri
ter's "class." Why should we
then assume that he or she
would preach the values of that
class? People like me who are
stuck with teaching literature
have long noted that writers
are a notoriously irresponsible
lot. They rebel, behave deplor
ably, become iconoclasts, and
can rarely be counted on to do
the things that others (like
members of their "class") ex

pect them to do. So the rela
tionship between their "class"
and the "strengths and weak
nesses" of their works is com
plicated, elusive and indeter
minate. At least to me.
3. Now let us return to poor
John Keats. I wonder what the
charges made against him by
Professor Keohane are all ab
out. It seems that Keats'
women are "described
through male eyes as wonder
fully mysterious and desirable
objects," and that "the mystery
is essential." So be it. This is
essentially a correct, if shallow,
reading of Keats' powerfully
erotic vision, in which women
are seen sometimes as seduc
tive, sometimes as destructive,

sometimes as passive, some
times promising life and at
other times death. But if Pro
fessor Keohane were to re-read
"Lamia" or "La belle dame sans
merci," I believeshe would see
that as the female changes, she
is also changed in the mind of
the male observer. Men don't
always see what women truly
are: that's what poor Keats,
who had genius, knew.
4. Professor Keohane urges
the freshmen to come to the
authors they are to study this
year with skepticism. Fair
enough. But skepticism is one
thing; condescension is
another. I wonder if it has oc
curred to her that the authors
she teaches are not as much on
trial as is the culture that sur

rounds her, and as are the mis
conceptions she and all of us
now labor under.
Professor Keohane and I are
both members of the Western
Culture Program Committee.
She has one vision of that cul
ture, and has now conveyed it
to Stanford freshmen. I differ
with her, suspecting her vision
to be at once undiscriminating
and reductive. That I differ as
strongly as I do with her is one
small piece of evidence that
"culture" is complex. The
simplifications which Profes
sor Keohane zealously applies
to it are, I believe, inapprop
riate.
