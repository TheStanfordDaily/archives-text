## Hastorf minds provost's duties

"I didn't sit day-dreaming about
doing this," said newly appointed
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf.
But when Donald Kennedy left his
position as provost last summer to
become president of the University,
Hastorf, a psychology professor
here, became his temporary succes
sor.
Hastorf said he will "pitch in"and
serve as provost, the chief academic
officer of the University, tor a year.
"They needed someone with
enough administrative experience
around here to do it until a real
search could be done," he said.
"I did not expect to think of myself
doing this," he added, "(but)
everyone wanted to do a careful
search for provost."
Will teach again
Hastorf will return to his position
as professor in the psychology de
partment after completing his term.
"I see myself as a professor al
though it's obvious I've engaged in l
some administrative activity," he
said. "I like teaching, I like re
search."
Hastorf, a social psychologist, said
he and Kennedy share many con
cerns.
"Major goals include evaluating af
firmative action and various aspects
of undergraduate education here.
"I'd like to see more movement in
the direction of undergraduate prog

rams," he said. This would encour
age departments to work together
rather than as separate bodies.
Humanities series
"I would hope these programs
(such as the humanities series)
would also apply to graduate stu
dents," he said.
He affirmed this would not make a
humanities series required for
graduate students but would merely
"open up possibilities."
For example, he said, graduate
students should be given increased
opportunity to take courses from fa
culty in more than one department.
In a specialty such as medieval his
tory, students should not be "boxed
in,"he said.
Hastorf also cited room for change
in the advising system, particularly in

terms of increased information on
academic program and career
choices.
Affirmative action
His affirmauveaction ideas include
an aggressive, stepped-up search tor
female administrators.
According to Hastorf, he will par
ticularly encourage "active searches
when faculty positions are open for
qualified members of minorities.'
As chief academic officer of the
University, Hastorf's primary deal-
