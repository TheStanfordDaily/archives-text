## Hastorf minds provost's duties

"I didn't sit day-dreaming about
doing this," said newly appointed
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf.
But when Donald Kennedy left his
position as provost last summer to
become president of the University,
Hastorf, a psychology professor
here, became his temporary succes
sor.
Hastorf said he will "pitch in"and
serve as provost, the chief academic
officer of the University, tor a year.
"They needed someone with
enough administrative experience
around here to do it until a real
search could be done," he said.
"I did not expect to think of myself
doing this," he added, "(but)
everyone wanted to do a careful
search for provost."
Will teach again
Hastorf will return to his position
as professor in the psychology de
partment after completing his term.
"I see myself as a professor al
though it's obvious I've engaged in l
some administrative activity," he
said. "I like teaching, I like re
search."
Hastorf, a social psychologist, said
he and Kennedy share many con
cerns.
"Major goals include evaluating af
firmative action and various aspects
of undergraduate education here.
"I'd like to see more movement in
the direction of undergraduate prog

rams," he said. This would encour
age departments to work together
rather than as separate bodies.
Humanities series
"I would hope these programs
(such as the humanities series)
would also apply to graduate stu
dents," he said.
He affirmed this would not make a
humanities series required for
graduate students but would merely
"open up possibilities."
For example, he said, graduate
students should be given increased
opportunity to take courses from fa
culty in more than one department.
In a specialty such as medieval his
tory, students should not be "boxed
in,"he said.
Hastorf also cited room for change
in the advising system, particularly in

terms of increased information on
academic program and career
choices.
Affirmative action
His affirmauveaction ideas include
an aggressive, stepped-up search tor
female administrators.
According to Hastorf, he will par
ticularly encourage "active searches
when faculty positions are open for
qualified members of minorities.'
As chief academic officer of the
University, Hastorf's primary deal-


Albert Hastorf
ings are with deans of the schools.
His domain includes faculty ap
pointments, new academic direc
tions and the budget.
"There is a finite amount of
money. With inflation driving things,
there are vast areas of cost that are
extremely difficult to control," he
said.
"As outside forces drive up these
costs, our struggle is to keep some
room forautonomous decisions," he
added. "We need autonomy for
self-direction."
A major concern of Hastorf is
maintaining flexibility for the institu
tion.
Government regulations
According to Hastorf, he is "ever
alert in regard to government regula
tions that can bind us in."
But the government also provides
much-needed substantial support to
research projects, he added.
Inflation poses another major
monetary problem. In particular, the
increased tuition it inevitably brings
must be met by increased scholar
ships.
Hastorf now operates his day
based on a set schedule. "The presi
dent's and my calendars are deter
mined by a set of institutional de
mands," he said.
Hastorf is also writing a social
psychology book with a colleague
from the University of Maryland.
"I've always had a good, full day,"
he said.
Hastorf was chairman of the
psychology department from 1962 to
1969. He then served as dean of
humanities and sciences from 1969t0
1973. Thefollowing year he becamea
psychology professor again.
He directed the Boys Town Center
from 1975 to 1980.

"I see myself as a professor al
though it's obvious I've engaged in l
some administrative activity," he
said. "I like teaching, I like re
search."
Hastorf, a social psychologist, said
he and Kennedy share many con
cerns.
"Major goals include evaluating af
firmative action and various aspects
of undergraduate education here.
"I'd like to see more movement in
the direction of undergraduate prog

rams," he said. This would encour
age departments to work together
rather than as separate bodies.
Humanities series
"I would hope these programs
(such as the humanities series)
would also apply to graduate stu
dents," he said.
He affirmed this would not make a
humanities series required for
graduate students but would merely
"open up possibilities."
For example, he said, graduate
students should be given increased
opportunity to take courses from fa
culty in more than one department.
In a specialty such as medieval his
tory, students should not be "boxed
in,"he said.
Hastorf also cited room for change
in the advising system, particularly in

terms of increased information on
academic program and career
choices.
Affirmative action
His affirmauveaction ideas include
an aggressive, stepped-up search tor
female administrators.
According to Hastorf, he will par
ticularly encourage "active searches
when faculty positions are open for
qualified members of minorities.'
As chief academic officer of the
University, Hastorf's primary deal-


Albert Hastorf
ings are with deans of the schools.
His domain includes faculty ap
pointments, new academic direc
tions and the budget.
"There is a finite amount of
money. With inflation driving things,
there are vast areas of cost that are
extremely difficult to control," he
said.
"As outside forces drive up these
costs, our struggle is to keep some
room forautonomous decisions," he
added. "We need autonomy for
self-direction."
A major concern of Hastorf is
maintaining flexibility for the institu
tion.
Government regulations
According to Hastorf, he is "ever
alert in regard to government regula
tions that can bind us in."
But the government also provides
much-needed substantial support to
research projects, he added.
Inflation poses another major
monetary problem. In particular, the
increased tuition it inevitably brings
must be met by increased scholar
ships.
Hastorf now operates his day
based on a set schedule. "The presi
dent's and my calendars are deter
mined by a set of institutional de
mands," he said.
Hastorf is also writing a social
psychology book with a colleague
from the University of Maryland.
"I've always had a good, full day,"
he said.
Hastorf was chairman of the
psychology department from 1962 to
1969. He then served as dean of
humanities and sciences from 1969t0
1973. Thefollowing year he becamea
psychology professor again.
He directed the Boys Town Center
from 1975 to 1980.
"I didn't sit day-dreaming about
doing this," said newly appointed
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf.
But when Donald Kennedy left his
position as provost last summer to
become president of the University,
Hastorf, a psychology professor
here, became his temporary succes
sor.
Hastorf said he will "pitch in"and
serve as provost, the chief academic
officer of the University, tor a year.
"They needed someone with
enough administrative experience
around here to do it until a real
search could be done," he said.
"I did not expect to think of myself
doing this," he added, "(but)
everyone wanted to do a careful
search for provost."
Will teach again
Hastorf will return to his position
as professor in the psychology de
partment after completing his term.
"I see myself as a professor al
though it's obvious I've engaged in l
some administrative activity," he
said. "I like teaching, I like re
search."
