## No more disasters like Goldwater and Nixon Reagan campaigns against GOP's past 
### Washington Post 
Springfield, 111. — For Ronald Reagan this fall, the
presidential race pits him against more than President
Jimmy Carter and the Democrats. In some respects,
his most difficult opponents are phantoms arising out
of his own party's past.
Reagan must run against the legacy of the Republi
can right wing and the memories of the disasters that
befell Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon. It is a for
midable task, full of political ironies, for the Republi
can right that has totally captured the GOP in recent
years remains Reagan's most ardent bloc of suppor
ters. And ideologically he represents almost the per
fect spokesman to emerge from their ranks. At the
same time, to win he must convince voters that he
stands for something broader.
After nearly a month on the road talking to voters it
is clear that Reagan has not yet succeeded in allaying
those doubts. Reagan's candidacy offers the best
chance for a true political conservative to win the
presidency in more than half a century. But one of his
biggest problems continues to be the belief that he is
too much in the mold of the conservatives that pro
duced Goldwater and Nixon.
In the 1964 race, when the GOP cry was that at last it
was offering the country an ideological conservative

choice instead of an echo of liberal Democratic posi
tions, support for Goldwater was vocal and emo
tional. There was nothingeasygoingabout it; manyof
the Goldwater people spoke of their candidate in
fervent, zealous tones.
The shock of the crushing defeat in 1%4 lasted long
beyond the election. Nixon in his two victorious
presidential races, never stirred the emotions that
were so memorable a part of the Goldwater cam
paign. But Nixon's fall dealt an even greater blow to
Republican conservatives. It is one from which they
have not entirely recovered.
Now you hear concerns about Reagan from Repub
licans. They are worried that Reagan has been too
identified with narrow interests. To employ the
great cliche of this particular campaign, they are fear
ful Reagan is "perceived" as being too far on the right
to attract the kinds of support he must have to be
elected on Nov. 4.
Some of their expressed doubts go beyond unease
about superficial public impressions of their party's
candidate, of course. They do not like the "Moral
Majority" types who are so outspoken in their views
on such single issues as abortion and who are lined
up so solidly behind Reagan. To them, that associa
tion recalls the true believers of the Goldwater days.

There is, however, an important difference bet
ween the Reagan supporters of today and those who
clamored for Coldwater. Some of the most dedicated
Reagan followers take pains to point out that Reagan
himself is no right-wing radical. They remember the
reasons for defeat in th'e past, and are anxious that
Reagan be disassociated from the extremists in their
party. And so it seems, from the way he is campaign
ing, does Reagan.
Reagan and his running mate, George Bush, are not
making the ideological mistakes of the Coldwater
campaign. By courting blacks, blue-collar workers
and urban dwellers they are trying to persuade voters
they are not out to turn back the clock and undo
progress. Bush, for instance, is stumping the country,
calling the GOP "the new party of hope, the new
party of compassion." He goes before city planners
and says Democrat-inspired charges that a Reagan
administration would cut off aid to the cities and
eliminate existing federal unemployment and social
welfare programs are "outrageous allegations that
are not true." Reagan offers more of the same during
his public appearances.
But unfair or not, the old doubts persist. Reagan
has not yet been able to exorcise the GOP ghosts.

Springfield, 111. — For Ronald Reagan this fall, the
presidential race pits him against more than President
Jimmy Carter and the Democrats. In some respects,
his most difficult opponents are phantoms arising out
of his own party's past.
Reagan must run against the legacy of the Republi
can right wing and the memories of the disasters that
befell Barry Goldwater and Richard Nixon. It is a for
midable task, full of political ironies, for the Republi
can right that has totally captured the GOP in recent
years remains Reagan's most ardent bloc of suppor
ters. And ideologically he represents almost the per
fect spokesman to emerge from their ranks. At the
same time, to win he must convince voters that he
stands for something broader.
After nearly a month on the road talking to voters it
is clear that Reagan has not yet succeeded in allaying
those doubts. Reagan's candidacy offers the best
chance for a true political conservative to win the
presidency in more than half a century. But one of his
biggest problems continues to be the belief that he is
too much in the mold of the conservatives that pro
duced Goldwater and Nixon.
In the 1964 race, when the GOP cry was that at last it
was offering the country an ideological conservative

choice instead of an echo of liberal Democratic posi
tions, support for Goldwater was vocal and emo
tional. There was nothingeasygoingabout it; manyof
the Goldwater people spoke of their candidate in
fervent, zealous tones.
The shock of the crushing defeat in 1%4 lasted long
beyond the election. Nixon in his two victorious
presidential races, never stirred the emotions that
were so memorable a part of the Goldwater cam
paign. But Nixon's fall dealt an even greater blow to
Republican conservatives. It is one from which they
have not entirely recovered.
Now you hear concerns about Reagan from Repub
licans. They are worried that Reagan has been too
identified with narrow interests. To employ the
great cliche of this particular campaign, they are fear
ful Reagan is "perceived" as being too far on the right
to attract the kinds of support he must have to be
elected on Nov. 4.
Some of their expressed doubts go beyond unease
about superficial public impressions of their party's
candidate, of course. They do not like the "Moral
Majority" types who are so outspoken in their views
on such single issues as abortion and who are lined
up so solidly behind Reagan. To them, that associa
tion recalls the true believers of the Goldwater days.

There is, however, an important difference bet
ween the Reagan supporters of today and those who
clamored for Coldwater. Some of the most dedicated
Reagan followers take pains to point out that Reagan
himself is no right-wing radical. They remember the
reasons for defeat in th'e past, and are anxious that
Reagan be disassociated from the extremists in their
party. And so it seems, from the way he is campaign
ing, does Reagan.
Reagan and his running mate, George Bush, are not
making the ideological mistakes of the Coldwater
campaign. By courting blacks, blue-collar workers
and urban dwellers they are trying to persuade voters
they are not out to turn back the clock and undo
progress. Bush, for instance, is stumping the country,
calling the GOP "the new party of hope, the new
party of compassion." He goes before city planners
and says Democrat-inspired charges that a Reagan
administration would cut off aid to the cities and
eliminate existing federal unemployment and social
welfare programs are "outrageous allegations that
are not true." Reagan offers more of the same during
his public appearances.
But unfair or not, the old doubts persist. Reagan
has not yet been able to exorcise the GOP ghosts.
