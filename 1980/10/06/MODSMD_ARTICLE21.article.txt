# Indoor air pollution
## New buildings pose health hazards 
### Pacific News Service 
San Francisco — Indoor air pollution,
especially in new energy-efficient homes
and offices, is making many Americans
sick and posing a health hazard to count
less others.
The hazard is growing more serious with
the growing use of manmade building
materials? some of which emit harmful
vapors, and with energy conservation
measures that reduce ventilation.
"Buildings today — new buildings in
particular — are causing people to get
sick," said Assemblyman Floyd Mori,
chairman of a joint legislative subcommit
tee holding hearings on the subject in
California this fall.
"Most of us spend most of our life in
doors," he said. "Indoor air pollution is

one of the major problems we will face in
the future."
Problem is literal headache
The problem has become something of
a headache itself for citizens who have dis
covered that no official agency is in charge
and no standards exist.
The Environmental Protection Agency is
responsible for outdoor air quality. The
National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health and the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration monitor air in
industrial workplaces. But nobody has re
sponsibility for air in homes, offices, vehi
cles (including school buses), retail stores
and other indoor environments where air
pollution problems exist.
The most serious problems so far have
been reported in new and remodeled of

fice buildings and homes with energy
saving features, and in mobile homes.
Most involve formaldehyde in construc
tion materials, such as particle board and
indoor plywood, and in urea formal
dehyde foam insulation.
Formaldehyde vapors leak into the air
when the temperature rises and they
combine with other contaminants into a
mix that can cause headaches, respiratory
irritations, watery eyes, skin irritations,
nausea, diarrhea and heart problems.
Other contaminants include nitrogen
oxide and carbon monoxide, which have
been found in the air of some offices and
homes ai higher concentrations than what
is permissible by the Clean Air Act for the
outdoors.
