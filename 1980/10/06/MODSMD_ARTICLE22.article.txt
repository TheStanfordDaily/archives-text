# Supreme Court to rule on draft
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” The issue
everyone will be watching
as the Supreme Court
opens its 1980 term today is
whether women must be
included in the military draft
registration program.
The justices are being
asked to decide whether
President Jimmy Carter's
draft registration program is
unconstitutionally dis
criminatory because it
excludes women.
A three-judge panel in
Philadelphia held last sum
mer that it illegally discrimi
nated between men and
women, stigmatizing
women by excluding them.
The judges left the govern
ment with the choice of re
gistering both sexes, or re
gistering no one at all. The
order stemming from that
decision has been held up
pending the Supreme Court
consideration.
In many respects, the
draft case pits the Supreme

Court against itself. The
federal |udges in Philadel
phia based their decision in
part on Burger court actions
elevating women to a pro
tected legal status despite
the absence of an Equal
Rights Amendment. Before
the court's decisions over
the last decade on sex
equality, a government
needed little justification
for making legal distinc
tions based on gender. Al
most any excuse would suf
fice. Now, courts require
the showing of a substantial
reason.
The government thinks it
has one. The dratt registra
tion program, it argues, was
intended to ready the na
tion for an emergency
mobilization of combat
troops. The reason for
excluding women is that
they do not fight in wars.
The judges in Philadel
phia found that justification
insubstantial.
