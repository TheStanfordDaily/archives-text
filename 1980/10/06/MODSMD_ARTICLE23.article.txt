# Presidential inauguration hosts campus community
## 
### Theresa Simons 
Eighteen departmental coat
of arms have been emblazoned
onto majestic shields.
A unique presidential robe
of cardinal red silk taille with
white watered silk facing has
been specially designed.
Approximately 13,000 invita
tions have been dis
tributed.
These and numerous other
preparations tor Donald Ken
nedy's inauguration as presi
dent of the University will
come to fruition Sunday, Oc
tober 12, at 2:30 p.m. in Frost
Amphitheater. All students, fa
culty and staff have been in
vited to the ceremony.
Unlike most university pres
idential inaugurations, Ken
nedy's ceremony will be a
campus event, planned primar
ily for the students and staff of
the University rather than the

national academic community.
Only a few prominent mem
bers of other universities have
been invited including Harvard
President Derek Bok, a Stan
ford alumnus.
The inauguration promises
enough pomp and cir
cumstance to make it a theatri
cal event. Four baroque trum
peteers will fanfare a colorful
academic procession of about
500 senior officers and faculty
including emeritus Richard
Lyman.
The highlight of the cere
mony will be when Chairman
of the Board of trustees, Peter
Bing, invests Kennedy by re
moving the new president's
Harvard robe and replacing if
with the special Stanford pres
idential robe. Kennedy's inau
gural address, a discussion of
his views of the University and
his goals as president will fol

low the investiture.
After the ceremony, stu
dents and staff are invited to a
reception which will be held in
the elaborately decorated
Inner Ouad.
Students received their invi
tations in their registration pac
kets last week and can obtain
their tickets at no cost by pre
senting their Stanford identifi
cation cards and invitations at
the Tresidder ticket office. The
deadline tor picking up tickets
is this Wednesday at 5 p.m.
The University has not had a
presidential inaugural cere
mony since President Kenneth
Pitzer's inaugural in 1967.
Lyman did not have an
inaugural ceremony because
"the campus situation was not
conducive at the time due to
much unrest," according to
lohn Hughes, director of Pub
lic Events at the University.
