### Susan Blaine 
Rallying behind the slogan, "If your vote
doesn't count then whose vote are they count
ing?", the ASSU and Frontlash, a non-partisan

The original goal, to register 2000 persons,
was achieved last Thursday, and the two groups
now hope to register 2500 by this afternoon.
"Youth awareness may becomingintoits own
now," commented Dick Butterfield, Council of
Presidents member. "There's a lot more interest
in what's going on politically."
Although ASSU representatives say they be
lieve political interest on campus is higher than
in previous years, the Santa Clara County Regis
trar of Voters reported Thursday that the
number of registered voters in the Palo Alto area
totaled only 35,949, as opposed to 37,311 in the
1976 general election.

"We are attempting to get students involved,
to get the campus vote to be more effective and
to hopefully make students a valuable part ot the
political process," said Butterfield.
Between 20 and 30 volunteers from the ASSU
Senate, the Council and the student body have
manned booths at Tresidder, the Sunday
Flicks and the post office. According to COP
member Marc Ventresca,6oo people were regis
tered to vote in one day at Maples Pavillion dur
ing fall class quarter registration.
Costs have been kept at a minimal, said Ven
tresca, and were paid for by Frontlash and the
COP Discretionary Fund. Vantresca said
former COP member Andrew Goldenkranz has
contributed his expertise to the effort.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau is planning de
bates on campus between local candidates to
increase students awareness of political issues.
"A lot of people have the misconception that
if they don't live in Sant Clara County, they're
not eligible to vote, while that is not the case,"
said Butterfield.
