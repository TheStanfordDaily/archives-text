# Cards prove a win is a win by overcoming Spartans
## 
### Chris Haft 
Both San Jose State and Stan
ford failed to hold on to the
football very well Saturday at
Stanford Stadium. The Cardi
nals, however, managed to
hold on to the lead, which
made the difference in their
35-21 victory.
Inelegance was the rule for
both squads. The Spartans
committed five fumbles — los
ing four of them — and threw
three interceptions. Stanford
wasn't much better, losing four
outofan atrocious sixfumbles.
Ultimately, of course, San
lose's miscues proved more
costly and gave the Cards their
fourth triumph in five games.
In the first half, scene of sev
eral Spartan transgressions,
San Jose drove into Stanford
territory six times. But Steve
Lemon, Dave Morze and Kevin
Baird intercepted passes to kill
three of the drives, Spartan
tight end Tracy Franz fumbled
to end another surge and a fake
punt-and-run came up short to
halt one more march.
The Spartans outgained
Stanford 267-163 in the first
half, ran 44 plays to Stanford's
24, amassed 13 first downs to
Stanford's seven, possessed
the ball for almost 19 of the ini
tial 30 minutes — and trailed
14-7 for all their efforts.
"Without their turnovers, I
don't know what the score
might have been. I shudder to
think about it," Card head
coach Paul Wiggin admitted.
"We really didn't stop them in
the first half; they stopped
themselves."
"If they didn't turn the ball
over, they could have had 14 or
21 points," Stanford defensive
tackle Doug Rogers said.
Spartan head coach Jack

Elway echoed Rogers' senti
ments. "Realistically, we
should have had 14 points in
the first half," he said. "It's the
third game in a row where
we've had mishaps in the open
ing moments."
Elway was referring to the
opening kickoff, which San
Jose's Tim Kearse caught at the
4-yard line and returned to the
20 before Todd Wasik knocked
the ball loose. Mike Dotterer
pounced on the fumble, and
two plays later, coach Elway
watched Stanford score its first
touchdown on son John El
way's 13-yard strike to Andre
Tyler.
From then on until intermis
sion, however, Stanford hardly
sparkled. On three sub
sequent possessions the Cards
couldn't maintain a substantial
offensive march. "We were
unable to sustain anything with
any consistency," Wiggin said.
The Cards' offensive
machine briefly ran smoothly
in the second quarter when it
moved from Stanford's 31 to
San Jose's 13. But the machine
stalled abruptly with just under
eight minutes left in the half
when Elway, scrambling from a
host of bloodthirsty defenders,
fumbled after being hit by de
fensive end Bob Overly.
"I had Darrin (Nelson) open,
and I was just about ready to
throw, and then the guy hit
me," Elway said. "That was
seven points right there . . .
that was the mistake of the
year," he then groaned, strik
ing a thigh pad in disgust with
his right fist.
If Elway was self-critical,
Stanford's defense should
have been more so. Spartan
tailback Gerald Willhite (who
rushed for 138 yards, 64 in the

first half) gave the Cards fits
with his consistent bursts
through the line and quarter
back Steve Clarkson (who had
184 yards passing by halftime)
gave the Cards palpitations
with his accurate tosses to wide
receiver Stacey Bailey.
"Losing containment, over
running the ball, not aggres
sive enough on tackles," said
Rogers, enumerating the
Cards' first-half defensive
faults. "If one guy breaksdown
in the defensive scheme we
have, that's it."

What saved the Cards from
further first-half embarrass
ment was Vincent White's
dazzling 57-yard touchdown
run on a misdirection play 4:50
before the break. On second
and-one from Stanford's 43,
White took a handoff, started
up the middle, then turned left
to the outside of the field and
outdistanced the entire Spar
tan defense on his way to the
goal line.
It was the longest run by a
Card player since 1978, when
Nelson chugged 59 yards

against Washington, but it
wasn't White's longest career
jaunt. "In high school I had
some 985," the 5-foot-8, 170-
pound sophomore recalled.
The Cards essentially won it
with their two third-quarter
touchdowns, one on Nelson's
1-yard stroll that culminated a
76-yard, 16-play drive, and the
other on Rob Moore's 11-yard
pass from Elway, who threw a
remarkable strike despite
being cornered by tackle Rod
Traylor and end Ken Wood
burn.

Yet Wiggin felt that the suc
cessful 76-yard drive was
tainted with inadequacy.
Twice, he pointed out, Stan
ford faced fourth-down situa
tions. "You don't even get into
(those) if you're really moving
the ball," the coach said.
Quarterback Elway, the man
who is usually most responsi
ble for moving the ball, per
formed decently. He com
pleted 19 of 25 passes tor 164

yards and three touchdowns.
The talented sophomore now
has 11 scoring passes this sea
son, a Pacific-10 Conference
leading figure.
It must be noted, however,
that Elway labored under con
siderable strain. Being Jack El
way's son, he faced the unen
viable task of competing
against his father, a man he
deeply respects and admires.

Vincent White heads downfield on his 57-yard touchdown run in the second quarter of Saturday's 35-21
win over San Jose State.
Being Stanford's quarterback,
he felt the pressure of prevent
ing a "letdown" following last
week's 31-14 conquest of Ok
lahoma.
"This is by far the most in
tense week I ever had. I didn't
stop getting nervous until the
first half was over," Elway re
vealed. "I was twice as nervous
as I was for the Oklahoma
game— I wanted to make sure
we didn't let down."
Regardless of all the fussing

and fretting, it was a victory,
and victories have their happy
moments. For example,
fullback-turned-tight end
Wasik scored Stanford's final
touchdown — the first of his
Card career.
Wasik began to tell a repor
ter that his six-pointer felt
"great," but offensive tackle
Brian Holloway, overhearing
the conversation as he passed
from the shower to the locker
room, bellowed in mock
anger, "It wasn't great! It was
FANTASTIC! Write THAT

down!"
NOTES: Flanker Ken
Margerum, who caught four
passes for 49 yards, has now
snagged at least one pass in 28
consecutive games . . . Nel
son's touchdown was the 19th
of his Stanford career, third
best in Card annals behind
Margerum (23)and Phil Moffett
(20) .. . Clarkson, who

finished with 213 yards passing
on a 17-for-27 day, will miss San
lose's next four games with a
broken left clavicle he suffered
in the fourth quarter . . . The
crowd of 61,127 was the largest
ever to witness a Stanford-San
lose State contest. The 1976
contest, which attracted
51,000, was the previous top
draw.
