# Taylor's clutch tallies give Stanford a tie

### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford tied California 5-5
in the closing seconds of the
NorCal Invitational Water Polo
Tournament Championship
match on Saturday afternoon.
The University division of the
tournament, held at deCuerre
swimming complex, included
teams from UC-Santa Barbara,
and, of course, Cal, probably
the stiffest competition Stan
ford can expect all season. The
championship match was the
second meeting of the two
teams (Stanford defeated Cal at
UC-lrvine, 6-4). Stanford met
UCSB at noon Friday expecting
a win, but not the 12-4 rout that
ensued.
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti said, "I thought we
would win, because UCSB lost
some of their top players at the
end of last season. I didn't ex
pect to beat them as badly as
we did because they beat
UCLA earlier this season; they
have a good strong young
team."
As Dettamanti's comments
might indicate, the score was
not totally representative of
the action in the game. UCSB
held its own throughout the
first half, going into the third

quarter down by only three go
als, 6-3.
The opening of the second
half was characterized by
UCSB's particularly tenacious
defensive play as well as evi
dence of an awakening offense
when they scored on their first
possession.
Stanford, however, im
mediately retaliated with a
score of its own when hole
man Jody Campbell hit with a
bullet from the outside in less
than half the time it took UCSB
to put its own goal on the
board. Stanford remained in
vulnerable for the rest of the
game.
The highlight of the tourna
ment was, of course, the
championship match between
Cal and Stanford at noon on
Saturday. Flyers advertising the
match were spotted around
campus as early as Thursday.
Dettamanti characterized it as
one of the lowest-scoring
Stanford-Cal games he had
ever seen. Itwas reminiscentin
scoring and action of the same
tournament championship a
year ago, which Stanford won
5-4.
Cal performed its usual im
itation of the gang fight scene

in West Side Story. On the first
play of the game Stanford
fieldman Chris Kelsey was
penalized with a 35-second
ejection for a personal foul
while attempting to keep his
head above water as a Cal
player tap-danced on his mid
section. Thus was the pace of
the game set.
Both teams quickly settled
into a pattern of trading six
on-five-man advantages as
players were constantly
penalized with ejections. But
while Cal was able to capitalize
with goals on three of those
advantage situations, Stanford
seemed almost ineffective,
scoring only one goal in the
first half. Part of Stanford's
inability to score may have
been caused by the mass mug
ging Campbell seemed to run
into on every offensive at
tempt.
The second half opened with
a much faster pace as each team
alternated turning the ball
over. It appeared that the Car
dinals were prepared to take
control of the game when they
scored two successive goals
late in the third quarter to tie
the game at 3-3. Campbell
scored with 3:30 left, and less

than a minute later had a hand
in another score when he pas
sed the ball to Greg Lambert,
who was able to feed the ball to
Steve Smith on the inside. Cal
retaliated immediately how
ever, when Campbell was
penalized with 35-second ejec
tion.
The fourth quarter opened
with Stanford in foul trouble;
Campbell had one personal
foul, Bill Taylor, substituting
for injured lames Bergeson,
had one, and playmaker Kelsey
was out of the game for good

with three.
Neither team was able to
score until later in the quarter
when Cal once again took ad
vantage of a six-on-five situa
tion, making the score 5-3 with
a little over two minutes left to
play.
Stanford was unable to score
until Campbell once again
found a crack in the Cal de
fense and passed to Taylor,
who scored from the inside
with 57 seconds remaining.

scoring when goalie John Gan
sel hauled down a lob shot and
called a time out with 16 sec
onds remaining.
The Campbell-Taylor com
bination came through once
again almost immediately after
play resumed, when Campbell
fed the ball to Taylor inside
near the left hand corner of the
goal. Taylor tossed the ball un
derneath the arm of Cal goalie
with 10 seconds remaining,
and the game was called a tie

after Cal missed on a despera
tion shot.
According to Dettamanti,
Stanford's greatest strength
throughout the tournament
was the performance of the
bench, particularly the play of
sophomore Taylor. The ab
sence of Bergeson, one of the
team's leading scorers, could
very well have cost Stanford the
game. Although he has worked
with the team in practice,
Bergeson has missed two
weeks of play with an elbow
injury.

UCSB at noon Friday expecting
a win, but not the 12-4 rout that
ensued.
Stanford coach Dante De
ttamanti said, "I thought we
would win, because UCSB lost
some of their top players at the
end of last season. I didn't ex
pect to beat them as badly as
we did because they beat
UCLA earlier this season; they
have a good strong young
team."
As Dettamanti's comments
might indicate, the score was
not totally representative of
the action in the game. UCSB
held its own throughout the
first half, going into the third

quarter down by only three go
als, 6-3.
The opening of the second
half was characterized by
UCSB's particularly tenacious
defensive play as well as evi
dence of an awakening offense
when they scored on their first
possession.
Stanford, however, im
mediately retaliated with a
score of its own when hole
man Jody Campbell hit with a
bullet from the outside in less
than half the time it took UCSB
to put its own goal on the
board. Stanford remained in
vulnerable for the rest of the
game.
The highlight of the tourna
ment was, of course, the
championship match between
Cal and Stanford at noon on
Saturday. Flyers advertising the
match were spotted around
campus as early as Thursday.
Dettamanti characterized it as
one of the lowest-scoring
Stanford-Cal games he had
ever seen. Itwas reminiscentin
scoring and action of the same
tournament championship a
year ago, which Stanford won
5-4.
Cal performed its usual im
itation of the gang fight scene

in West Side Story. On the first
play of the game Stanford
fieldman Chris Kelsey was
penalized with a 35-second
ejection for a personal foul
while attempting to keep his
head above water as a Cal
player tap-danced on his mid
section. Thus was the pace of
the game set.
Both teams quickly settled
into a pattern of trading six
on-five-man advantages as
players were constantly
penalized with ejections. But
while Cal was able to capitalize
with goals on three of those
advantage situations, Stanford
seemed almost ineffective,
scoring only one goal in the
first half. Part of Stanford's
inability to score may have
been caused by the mass mug
ging Campbell seemed to run
into on every offensive at
tempt.
The second half opened with
a much faster pace as each team
alternated turning the ball
over. It appeared that the Car
dinals were prepared to take
control of the game when they
scored two successive goals
late in the third quarter to tie
the game at 3-3. Campbell
scored with 3:30 left, and less

than a minute later had a hand
in another score when he pas
sed the ball to Greg Lambert,
who was able to feed the ball to
Steve Smith on the inside. Cal
retaliated immediately how
ever, when Campbell was
penalized with 35-second ejec
tion.
The fourth quarter opened
with Stanford in foul trouble;
Campbell had one personal
foul, Bill Taylor, substituting
for injured lames Bergeson,
had one, and playmaker Kelsey
was out of the game for good

with three.
Neither team was able to
score until later in the quarter
when Cal once again took ad
vantage of a six-on-five situa
tion, making the score 5-3 with
a little over two minutes left to
play.
Stanford was unable to score
until Campbell once again
found a crack in the Cal de
fense and passed to Taylor,
who scored from the inside
with 57 seconds remaining.

scoring when goalie John Gan
sel hauled down a lob shot and
called a time out with 16 sec
onds remaining.
The Campbell-Taylor com
bination came through once
again almost immediately after
play resumed, when Campbell
fed the ball to Taylor inside
near the left hand corner of the
goal. Taylor tossed the ball un
derneath the arm of Cal goalie
with 10 seconds remaining,
and the game was called a tie

after Cal missed on a despera
tion shot.
According to Dettamanti,
Stanford's greatest strength
throughout the tournament
was the performance of the
bench, particularly the play of
sophomore Taylor. The ab
sence of Bergeson, one of the
team's leading scorers, could
very well have cost Stanford the
game. Although he has worked
with the team in practice,
Bergeson has missed two
weeks of play with an elbow
injury.

in the closing seconds of the
NorCal Invitational Water Polo
Tournament Championship
match on Saturday afternoon.
The University division of the
tournament, held at deCuerre
swimming complex, included
teams from UC-Santa Barbara,
and, of course, Cal, probably
the stiffest competition Stan
ford can expect all season. The
championship match was the
second meeting of the two
teams (Stanford defeated Cal at
