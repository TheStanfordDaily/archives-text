From the Daily wire services
Baghdad, Iraq â€” Iranian jets at
tacked Baghdad and other Iraqi cities
at dawn yesterday, breaking an Iraqi
cease-tire moments atter it went into
effect. The Iraqi high command an
nounced the war would go on into a
third week.
In Tehran, the Iranian parliament
which had been scheduled to take up
the issue of the 52 American hostages
in their 337 th day of captivity yester
day, canceled a public session.
The Baghdad government de
clared late yesterday that Iraqi
"troops will continue their march to
inflict further defeats on the Persian
enemy in view of its non-response to
Iraq's unilateral cease-fire." It said
that despite the cease-fire, Iranian
"ground forces waged assaults on
our forces, their warplanes raided
our civil areas inside the Iraqi ter
ritories and their naval forces com
mitted similar acts against us in the
sea."
Iraq, saying it had achieved its
main goals in the conflict, an
nounced last week that it planned a
unilateral cease-fire for four days,
starting at dawn yesterday. But Iran
pledged to fight on until Iraqi forces
were driven out of its territory and
the cease-fire ended almost as soon
as it started.
The Iraqis said yesterday that their
artillery had resumed shelling the
key port city ot Khorramshahr, which
after 14 days of siege still remained in
Iranian hands.
For its part, the Iranian high com
mand declared in a radio broadcast
that Iranian troops would "continue
their fight against the aggressor
the Iraqi mercenaries."
During the morning, reporters
along the Shatt al Arab said that the
contested waterway separating the
two countries was relatively quiet.
But incoming Iranian artillery and
mortar fire prompted the Iraqis to
n sumo their artillery barrage just be
fore noon against Khorramshahr,
and the huge refinery city of Abadan,
a few miles down the Shatt al Arab.
Later in the day, the Iraqis said that
the Iranians launched two separate
air attacks against the capital of
Baghdad, but no major damage was
reported.
And Tehran reported that a

Soviet-built Iraqi plane dropped a
bomb on the capital's MehrabacJ air
port, then was shot down.
Tehran also said that its guerrilla
forces had carried out a successful
attack inside Iraq, but it gave no de
tails of the raid other than to say that
some tanks were destroyed. It was
the first time that the Tehran gov
ernment had claimed its forces had
operated inside Iraq.
Although the Iraqis have been
shelling Abadan, they still have not
been able to capture the city. The
Abadan refinery, one of the world's
largest, supplies much of Iran's
domestic gasoline, jet fuel and oil
products.
During the day, the Iraqi defense
minister Gen. Adnan Khairallah, was
forced to admit to the press that Iraqi
forces had not yet captured the
major Iranian cities i n the ethnic Arab
oil-producing province of Khuzistan.
In Baghdad the war of words con
tinued when Defense Minister

Khairallah said that a high aide to the
commander of the Iranian air force
had embarked on a trip to Europe
with "millions ot dollars" to purch
ase spare parts for the Iranian air
force.
He denied that there are any
Cuban advisers in the Iraqi armed
tore es, although admitting "We have
a number ot Cuban doctors.
The defense minister did admit
that the Iraqi armv is using Soviet and
French arms experts as advisers, be
cause those countries supply most of
Iraq's weapons.
In Tehran, the official government
radio said yesterday that the Soviet
ambassador to Iran, Yladimir Vinog
radov, had offered to resupply the
Iranians with military supplies.
In another development, King
Hussein ot Jordan returned to
Amman yesterday after a secret, 24-
hour visit to Baghdad.
