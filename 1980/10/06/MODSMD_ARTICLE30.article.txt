## Wiggin hopes for even-keeled team 
### Sally Jenkins 
There is a strange breeze
blowing across the Stanford
Cardinals' playing field, and a
new taste in their mouths. It's
called Winning Big.
The Cardinals are 4-1, they
intend to be fully prepared for
UCLA, and they finally beat a
team they were supposed to
beat, by fourteen points no
less. Why, then, was there an
undercurrent of dissatisfaction
among Paul Wiggin and his
players after Saturday's victory
over San jose State?
They are behaving justa little
bit like Barry Switzer and his
Oklahoma Sooners did after
their 29-7 victory over Ken
tucky three weeks ago. Switzer
was very upset about such a
measly little win. He was appa
rently still pouting about it
when Stanford demolished his
team 31-14 last week.
It seems that the Cardinals
have begun a search tor the
something that has been singu
larly lacking in their past at
tempts to win the Pacitic—lo
Conference; call it emotional
stability.
The Cardinals'primary worry
about their performance
Saturday is that they felt
drained at the start of the
game.
According to Wiggin, emo
tional consistency produces
championship teams.
Wiggin cited ex-Oklahoma
coach Bud Wilkinson's teams
as emotionally consistent, as
far as such a thing can be ac
complished. "He controlled
the lows and highs of the foot
ball teams so that the lows
were good enough to win
football games," Wiggin said.
With those thoughts in
mind, the San Jose State victory
becomes a two sided one,
half-good and half-bad. The
Cardinals were not emotion
ally prepared to play against a
team as dangerous as jack El
way's Spartans. According to
Coach Wiggin, "We should've
lost the game, the way we
played in the first half. We
knew that where we were at
halftime was not your typical
seven-point lead," which indi

cates that the Cardinals
seven-point lead was depen
dent on the mistakes of the
Spartans, not inspired play.
On the other hand, it is en
couraging to know that the
Cardinals can win a game when
they are not mentally prepared
to do so. The second half of the
game indicated that perhaps
they have reached a level
where they can overcome
emotional flatness with execu
tion.
Running back Vincent White
was probably the most positive
of the players and coaches. "I
wouldn't say we were flat re
ally; we did put 35 points on
the board. I think we moved
the ball when we had to," he
said.
But the point is that a Stan
ford team may be developing
that moves the ball when it
, doesn't have to, scores points
when it doesn't have to, and
likes it. Is a new trend forming
in which Stanford doesn't let
down, wins games comforta
bly, and saves miracle plays for
UCLA and USC?
Andre Tyler thought he saw a
glimpse of sdch a trend before
the Spartan game. "We haven't
played really poorly yet. I really
thought I saw it coming, but
there were too many fumbles
against San Jose."
Tyler is not alone in seeing
such a progression. Darrin Nel
son is slightly more positive
about the team's performance
against the Spartans as a whole.
"We didn't play the way we
should have in the first half, but I
think we played fairly well in the
second half."
It is evident that if such a
trend is developing it is barely
beginning. Even with scores of
31-14 and 35-21, there is no
Stanford fan who does not sit
in the stands waiting for disas
ter to strike.
A volatile and thrilling team
with a large degree of emo
tional consistency at the same
time may very well be impossi
ble at Stanford.
It is probably unfair for Stan
ford fans to expect it.
But oh, what we've got ain't
bad.

son is slightly more positive
about the team's performance
against the Spartans as a whole.
"We didn't play the way we
should have in the first half, but I
think we played fairly well in the
second half."
It is evident that if such a
trend is developing it is barely
beginning. Even with scores of
31-14 and 35-21, there is no
Stanford fan who does not sit
in the stands waiting for disas
ter to strike.
A volatile and thrilling team
with a large degree of emo
tional consistency at the same
time may very well be impossi
ble at Stanford.
It is probably unfair for Stan
ford fans to expect it.
But oh, what we've got ain't
bad.
There is a strange breeze
blowing across the Stanford
Cardinals' playing field, and a
new taste in their mouths. It's
called Winning Big.
The Cardinals are 4-1, they
intend to be fully prepared for
UCLA, and they finally beat a
team they were supposed to
beat, by fourteen points no
less. Why, then, was there an
undercurrent of dissatisfaction
among Paul Wiggin and his
players after Saturday's victory
over San jose State?
They are behaving justa little
bit like Barry Switzer and his
Oklahoma Sooners did after
their 29-7 victory over Ken
tucky three weeks ago. Switzer
was very upset about such a
measly little win. He was appa
rently still pouting about it
when Stanford demolished his
team 31-14 last week.
It seems that the Cardinals
have begun a search tor the
something that has been singu
larly lacking in their past at
tempts to win the Pacitic—lo
Conference; call it emotional
stability.
The Cardinals'primary worry
about their performance
Saturday is that they felt
drained at the start of the
game.
According to Wiggin, emo
tional consistency produces
championship teams.
Wiggin cited ex-Oklahoma
coach Bud Wilkinson's teams
as emotionally consistent, as
far as such a thing can be ac
complished. "He controlled
the lows and highs of the foot
ball teams so that the lows
were good enough to win
football games," Wiggin said.
With those thoughts in
mind, the San Jose State victory
becomes a two sided one,
half-good and half-bad. The
Cardinals were not emotion
ally prepared to play against a
team as dangerous as jack El
way's Spartans. According to
Coach Wiggin, "We should've
lost the game, the way we
played in the first half. We
knew that where we were at
halftime was not your typical
seven-point lead," which indi

cates that the Cardinals
seven-point lead was depen
dent on the mistakes of the
Spartans, not inspired play.
On the other hand, it is en
couraging to know that the
Cardinals can win a game when
they are not mentally prepared
to do so. The second half of the
game indicated that perhaps
they have reached a level
where they can overcome
emotional flatness with execu
tion.
Running back Vincent White
was probably the most positive
of the players and coaches. "I
wouldn't say we were flat re
ally; we did put 35 points on
the board. I think we moved
the ball when we had to," he
said.
But the point is that a Stan
ford team may be developing
that moves the ball when it
, doesn't have to, scores points
when it doesn't have to, and
likes it. Is a new trend forming
in which Stanford doesn't let
down, wins games comforta
bly, and saves miracle plays for
UCLA and USC?
Andre Tyler thought he saw a
glimpse of sdch a trend before
the Spartan game. "We haven't
played really poorly yet. I really
thought I saw it coming, but
there were too many fumbles
against San Jose."
Tyler is not alone in seeing
such a progression. Darrin Nel
son is slightly more positive
about the team's performance
against the Spartans as a whole.
"We didn't play the way we
should have in the first half, but I
think we played fairly well in the
second half."
