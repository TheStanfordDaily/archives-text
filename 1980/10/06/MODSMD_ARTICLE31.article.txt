# Cey's HR forces Dodgers-Astros playoff
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — The Los
Angeles Dodgers got just what
they deserved yesterday — a
curtain call.
In the season that refuses to
end, the Dodgers asked them
selves back for an encore, a tit
ting tribute tothe madness that
has taken grip of Dodger
Stadium.
Unlike Muhammad Ali's,
theirs was a comeback that
took With yesterday's 4-3 de
cision, the Dodgers beat Hous
ton a third straight time to tie
•the Astros for the National
League West title and force a
one-game playoff today at 1
p.m. at Dodger Stadium.
In the Dodger clubhouse,
there seemed to be a winner
already. There were hugs,
wrist-shattering high fives. Ev
erything but champagne, a
magnum or two of which rests
unopened near the Astro
clubhouse.
. "I wouldn't mind sleeping
here tonight," offered Davey
Lopes. "Better than that, let's
play the last game right now.
Let's do it while we're hot."
Both teams have already
played 162 games and both
teams are 92-70.
I And after those 162 games,
the Astros are forced to spend
the longest weekend of their
iives in the smog and fog and

bedlam that is Los Angeles.
To conclude the regularly
scheduled portion of the sea
son of the comeback, the Dod
gers came back Sunday as well,
Ron Cey's two-run homer in
the eighth erasing a 3-2 deficit
and sending a frenzied mob of
52,339 into varying degrees of
ecstacy.
Suddenly the Dodgers — all
but out of it three days ago —
were all even.
The winner of today's one
game playoff heads to
Philadelphia for the National
League playoffs.
Should the Dodgers get
there, and no one is now wil
lingtotell them theycan't, they
would risk the danger of antic
limax. But it's a risk they'll
gladly take.
Topping yesterday's game,
its excitement and drama,
would be as improbable as the
Dodgers tying the Astros.
— Ron Cey hit his homer
playing on a bad leg, after foul
ing a ball off his ankle, after
missing two bunt attempts,
after fouling off three 3-2
pitches from Frank LaCorte.
— Don Sutton, the win
ningest pitcher in Dodger his
tory who beat the Astros Friday
night in what many figured to
be his last game as a Dodger,
made his fourth relief appear
ance in 11 years to get one bat

ter and one very big save.
— Manny Mota, the ageless
wonder, the one they used to
call Papa and now call Coach,
delivered a crucial pinch hit
that put the Dodgers on the
precipice of victory.
— There was even a reported
dugout scuffle when Dodger
manager Tom Lasorda al
legedly attempted to remove
lay lohnstone from the game in
the ninth. Reportedly, they had
to be pulled apart by several
players. Johnstone proceeded
to make a catch tumbling into
the right field seats and a near
diving catch of a ninth-inning
single to right.
And what the Dodgers and
Astros couldn't deliver on the
field, the tans did off it. There
was an electricity in the air that
all the Dodgers wanted to cre
dit as an important catalyst for
victory.
"It's contagious," said Der
rel Thomas, one of the many
contributors to the Dodger
win. "We hear the fans.
They've put us over the top."
Actually, the Dodgers are
not over the top. It's a spot they
share, after three wins in three
days, with the Astros. Dave
Goltz, for whom the Dodgers
paid $3 million as a free agent,
will pitch against Joe Niekro in
the season finale plus one.
"I'm excited," Goltz said.

"I've never been through any
thing like this."
By game's end, every
Dodger had to say the same.
Rookie Steve Howe, the
third Dodger reliever of the
day, was trying to protect the
Dodgers' slim lead. But with
one out, Gary Wood singled to
right and an out later Enos
Cabell singled to left.
Lasorda went to the mound,
and the fans, for the first time,
began to boo, until they saw it
was Sutton coming out of the
bullpen.

He threw one strike to
pinch-hitter Denny Walling
and then induced him to hit a
grounder to second, a ground
ball that Lopes surrounded and
then threw to first.
"I didn't know what Tommy
was doing," Lopes said. "But
then I saw Sutton come in."
"I knew I wasn't going to
throwthe ball byanyone," said
Sutton, who had just been
summoned to warm up. "But
after 15 years, I think I ought to
be able to finesse one batter."

but out of it three days ago —
were all even.
The winner of today's one
game playoff heads to
Philadelphia for the National
League playoffs.
Should the Dodgers get
there, and no one is now wil
lingtotell them theycan't, they
would risk the danger of antic
limax. But it's a risk they'll
gladly take.
Topping yesterday's game,
its excitement and drama,
would be as improbable as the
Dodgers tying the Astros.
— Ron Cey hit his homer
playing on a bad leg, after foul
ing a ball off his ankle, after
missing two bunt attempts,
after fouling off three 3-2
pitches from Frank LaCorte.
— Don Sutton, the win
ningest pitcher in Dodger his
tory who beat the Astros Friday
night in what many figured to
be his last game as a Dodger,
made his fourth relief appear
ance in 11 years to get one bat

ter and one very big save.
— Manny Mota, the ageless
wonder, the one they used to
call Papa and now call Coach,
delivered a crucial pinch hit
that put the Dodgers on the
precipice of victory.
— There was even a reported
dugout scuffle when Dodger
manager Tom Lasorda al
legedly attempted to remove
lay lohnstone from the game in
the ninth. Reportedly, they had
to be pulled apart by several
players. Johnstone proceeded
to make a catch tumbling into
the right field seats and a near
diving catch of a ninth-inning
single to right.
And what the Dodgers and
Astros couldn't deliver on the
field, the tans did off it. There
was an electricity in the air that
all the Dodgers wanted to cre
dit as an important catalyst for
victory.
"It's contagious," said Der
rel Thomas, one of the many
contributors to the Dodger
win. "We hear the fans.
They've put us over the top."
Actually, the Dodgers are
not over the top. It's a spot they
share, after three wins in three
days, with the Astros. Dave
Goltz, for whom the Dodgers
paid $3 million as a free agent,
will pitch against Joe Niekro in
the season finale plus one.
"I'm excited," Goltz said.

"I've never been through any
thing like this."
By game's end, every
Dodger had to say the same.
Rookie Steve Howe, the
third Dodger reliever of the
day, was trying to protect the
Dodgers' slim lead. But with
one out, Gary Wood singled to
right and an out later Enos
Cabell singled to left.
Lasorda went to the mound,
and the fans, for the first time,
began to boo, until they saw it
was Sutton coming out of the
bullpen.

He threw one strike to
pinch-hitter Denny Walling
and then induced him to hit a
grounder to second, a ground
ball that Lopes surrounded and
then threw to first.
"I didn't know what Tommy
was doing," Lopes said. "But
then I saw Sutton come in."
"I knew I wasn't going to
throwthe ball byanyone," said
Sutton, who had just been
summoned to warm up. "But
after 15 years, I think I ought to
be able to finesse one batter."
Los Angeles — The Los
Angeles Dodgers got just what
they deserved yesterday — a
curtain call.
In the season that refuses to
end, the Dodgers asked them
selves back for an encore, a tit
ting tribute tothe madness that
has taken grip of Dodger
Stadium.
Unlike Muhammad Ali's,
theirs was a comeback that
took With yesterday's 4-3 de
cision, the Dodgers beat Hous
ton a third straight time to tie
•the Astros for the National
League West title and force a
one-game playoff today at 1
p.m. at Dodger Stadium.
In the Dodger clubhouse,
there seemed to be a winner
already. There were hugs,
wrist-shattering high fives. Ev
erything but champagne, a
magnum or two of which rests
unopened near the Astro
clubhouse.
. "I wouldn't mind sleeping
here tonight," offered Davey
Lopes. "Better than that, let's
play the last game right now.
Let's do it while we're hot."
Both teams have already
played 162 games and both
teams are 92-70.
I And after those 162 games,
the Astros are forced to spend
the longest weekend of their
iives in the smog and fog and

bedlam that is Los Angeles.
To conclude the regularly
scheduled portion of the sea
son of the comeback, the Dod
gers came back Sunday as well,
Ron Cey's two-run homer in
the eighth erasing a 3-2 deficit
and sending a frenzied mob of
52,339 into varying degrees of
ecstacy.
Suddenly the Dodgers — all
but out of it three days ago —
were all even.
