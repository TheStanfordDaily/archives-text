Although they finished fifth
in a field of 10 teams, Stantord
women's cross country coach
Laurel Treon claimed her team
"had a pretty good day" Satur
day, competing in the Wo
men's Invitational at Berkeley.
The reason: "This is really
one of the top meets," Treon
said. "Of those teams that par
ticipated, I believe three were
in the top 10 in the nation last
year."
Host California won the
meet with a score of 51 points.
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo was
second, Wisconsin third and
Washington took fourth.
"To be fifth out of 10 teams
(like these) is not too bad,"

Treon said.
Overall, Stanford's Kim
Schnurpfeil continued to be
impressive, finishing in third
place at 17:52.6. Cal's Maggie
Keyes won the competition
with a time of 17:44.4. It was
the second meeting of the year
for Schnurpfeil and Keyes.
Schnurpfeil won their last time
out.
Cardinal Ellen Lyons finished
fourth overall, coming in at
17:59.6.
"This could be an indication
of good things to come,"
Treon said. "Our challenge
now is to put together a total
performance and we're getting
closer."
