# Cards lose twice on Northwest trip
## 
### Richard Martinez 
The Stantord men's soccer team's chances of gaining a
berth into the regional playoffs were all but booted away
this weekend as the squad suffered losses to both the
universities of Portland and Washington by identical margins
ot 3-1.
Travelling to the Northwest to battle two of that region's
toughest clubs, the Cardinals hoped to come away with at
least a split and maintain their playofl aspirations. Stanford
had to adjust to playing on the unfamiliar artificial turf, but,
more importantly, the hooters found themselves compet
ing against another factor — scoring deficits.
The Cardinals spotted Portland two first-halt goals during
Saturday's game and outdid that bit of generosity by giving
Washington a three-goal lead during the initial period of
yesterday's contest. And, as with Portland, the unleashed
Huskies could afford the luxury of sitting on their lead for
their duration of the game.
Unless you are the Los Angeles Dodgers, the success
factor for come-from-behind victories is slim at best. Stan
ford lacks both the luck and experience ot the Smogville
Sluggers and thus came away on the short end of the score
despite good second-half performances.
Coach Nelson Lodge said the difference between the
teams was their ability to capitalize on mistakes by oppo
nents. Both Northwestern clubs immediately took advan
tage of Cardinal errors and converted them to tallies. Likea
fighter who wears down his opponent but lacks that
knockout punch, Stantord seems to lack that capability for
fully exploiting an opposing team's blunder.
"We had opportunities — and good opportunities,"
Lodge said, "but we didn't jump on them. We can't make
any excuses, however. They were better. We're still
young."
"We have flashes of brilliance," added goalie Rob Hol
den, "but we don't have the consistency right now to put
them all together. It's frustrating only because we know we
have such potential. But don't count us out yet."
