# A 						sad, grotesque nightmare for Ali
## 
### John Kosner 
The picture on the huge television screen at the San lose
Convention Center was a nightmare come predictably
true. Muhammad Ali sat slumped in his corner, exhausted.
Nasty cuts marked the lower lids of his puffy eyes. His nose
was badly swollen-probably broken. Dried blood covered
much of his upper lip.
Muhammad Ali had finally gone beyond himself. For the
first time in his unparalleled boxing career, Ali could not
answer the bell. After ten sorry rounds, Ali's invisible chal
lenge of heavyweight champion Larry Holmes was merci
fully over. Holmes, the proud and worthy champion, raised
his arms aloft. Through glazed eyes, Ali peered out into ring
center. His body could no longer go where his mind in
sisted it go.

Commentary

The scene was not a surprising one. But it was sad so
heartbreakingly sad. In his once endless prime, Ali was the
greatest prizefighter ever. Never has there been such a
devastating mixof athletic ability , brains, will, courage, and
character in one boxer.
And yet, Ali in the 1960 sand the 1970 s was so much more
than boxing. He was vibrant, quick with words, funny
important-a world figure, a man whose striking features,
strirring spirit, and indisputable class made him a hero to
millions. And when he "retired" shortly after defeating
Leon Spinks to become the first three-time heavyweight
champ (Sept. 1978), his people knew the time was right.
But last Thursday night was Oct. 2nd, 198 U. Ali-his hair
graying, his speech slowing, his steps now taken off the
backs of his feet, his immense pride damaged by failures as
an actor and as a diplomat-had made a terrible decision.
He was coming back to the ring.
That his opponent, Larry Holmes, was eight years
younger and clearly too strong for him probably didn't faze

Ali much. Despite his tired pronouncements, AM was not
coming back to win the title for a record fourth time. In
stead, he was coming back to be the center of attention
again-and to collect $8 million.
Willing to play the whore at a dangerously old age for a
boxer (38), Ali put more than just the respect and adoration
of his fans and peers on the line when he agreed to take on
Holmes. His body, his mind, his soul-all these were sud
denly in jeopardy as well.
Nevertheless, if Ali was in any potential danger in his
meeting with Holmes, his fans weren't aware of it. At the
San Jose Convention Center, Ali fans arrived early (paying
$25 a head), bet heavily, and chanted loudly. As a whole
they probably tried harder than Ali did.
The Holmes-Ali skirmish was a grotesque mismatch.
Ali-his reflexes gone and his body weakened by too much
weight loss in too short a time-was little more than a body.
Larry Holmes, a quick, big man with fast hands and a blud
geoning left jab, did as he pleased. In ten rounds, Ali threw
maybe 20 punches-about three of which had any effect.
Whenever Ali tried to be aggressive, Holmes simply par
ried the weaker man's punches and followed with blister
ing counters of his own. Ali spent almost all of the fight on
the ropes, where he received a dreadful beating. In the
ninth and tenth rounds, Ali was practically helpless.
Despite the pattern of the fight, few Ali fans knew how
much trouble their idol was in until the debacle was just
about complete. They saw Ali joke from time to time and
they assumed all was fine. In truth, Ali's humor was all he
had left.
By the end of the tenth round, however, everyone knew
the count. Ali was finished. His fans were glassy-eyed. A
few women wept. Most of the men starred into space. One
got up and yelled, "Holmes was nothin' Ali. Nothin' but a
name." The irony stayed in my head.
I stared at Ali as he sagged in his corner. Was his beating
worth $8 million? Of course not. As I left, I looked closely at
Ali one more time. Under his damaged eyes, I could have
sworn I saw the tears of a clown.
