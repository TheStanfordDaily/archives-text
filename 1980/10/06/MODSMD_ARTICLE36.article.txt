team faces today.
Long Beach State, last year's
AIAW champions, invade
Roble Field today for a 3 p.m.
match against Stanford. The
Cardinals, 3-2 this season, lost
2-0 to the 49ers last week in

thing very sharply and at top
speed," she said. "If you hesi

this, you're done for."

only a 1-0 loss to San lose State
