U.S. to send Saudis equipment
Washington — The United States is sending a
mobile ground radar station, more communica
tions equipment and another % airmen to Saudi
Arabia to bolster further that country's air de
fenses and help back up the four big radar early
warning planes and 300 U.S. airmen sent last
week.
This latest U.S. action to strengthen the ability of
this country's largest oil supplierto ward off any air
attack should the war between Iraq and Iran widen
was revealed in general terms yesterday by De
fense Secretary Harold Brown on ABC's Issues and
Answers.
Though Brown only mentioned "possibly"
sending ground radars to the Saudis, other de
fense officials said privately that the first
planeloads of equipment left trom Holloman Air
Force Base in New Mexico on Saturday and that
the airlift, involving at least one giant C-5A trans
port and several slightly smaller C-141 jet trans
ports, would continue for a few days, with the new
station set to be in operation by Wednesday.
Brown sought to downplay the prospect that the
U.S. planes, airmen or equipment might wind up
being attacked in the fighting and that these ship
ments,as some havecautioned, might escalate the
chances of the United States becoming involved in
the war.
The defense chief said, "It depends on whether
you believe an attack is deterred by military capa
bility or by the absence of military capability."
Brown said he believed that by making the U.S.
committment clear, the chances of the conflict
spreading is reduced.
Schmidt's party keeps power
Bonn, West Germany — Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt's ruling Social Democratic-Free Democ
ratic coalition was returned to power yesterday in
a parliamentary election that reflected widespread
voter preference for moderation in domestic and
international affairs.
"I am very satisfied with the outcome," Schmidt
said in a victory statement. "It will be easy to gov
ern. And we will continue to deal with understand
ing our neighbors and allies."
Yet the big winner was the small, liberal Free
Democratic Party, which had suffered serious de
feats in two state elections earlier this year, raising
widespread speculation that it would be unable to
meet the minimum 5 percent of the national vote
required to be represented in the 518-seat parlia
ment.
The Social Democrats — despite the immense
personal popularity of the chancellor — made only
modest gains, and the conservative opposition
Christian Democratic-Christian Socialist parties
lost heavily. But they remained the biggest single
party in Germany, a position it has held since
World War 11.
The vote, however, was a stunning setback for
the CDU-CSU standard bearer, Franz Josef
Strauss, the controversial state premier of Bavaria.

Oil states to increase exports
Bahrain — Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Sheikh
Ahmad Zaki Yamani, said here yesterday that
major oil producing states in the Persian Cult have
agreed with his country to boost their exports to
offset losses caused by the Iraqi-Irani war.
Interviewed here at the end of a two-day swing
through the oil-rich Gulf region, Sheikh Yamani
said the world's third largest oil producer, the
United Arab Emirates, along with Qatar and Bah
rain agreed to support the Saudi plan to increase
production. Indonesia, another major oil pro
ducer, has also agreed to increase exports.
The one question mark among the major Gulf
states is Kuwait, the No. 3 exporter in the region,
which is not expected to go along with the Saudis.
But Kuwait, where Yamani visited yesterday, will
not oppose the Saudi plan by decreasing its own
production, according to sources here.
Sheikh Yamani refused to say how much Saudi
Arabia would increase production, which is al
ready running one million barrels a day above its
preferred ceiling. He said the amount of the in
crease depends on how severely the world market
isattected by the absence of oil from Iraq and Iran.
"We will play it by ear," he said in one interview
in Abu Dhabi, where he stopped Saturday night.
He also visited Dohaa, the capital of Qatar, yester
day morning and returned from here to Saudi
Arabia yesterday afternoon.
Bomb kills three near Tel Aviv
lerusalem — A bomb exploded in a post office
near Tel Aviv yesterday, killing three persons as
the Israeli Cabinet was drafting a condemnation of
the Friday night bombing of a synagogue in Paris.
The post office attack in Israel came at 8: 20 a.m.,
soon after the office had opened for business and
only 10 persons were present. Two were killed
outright, a third died at a nearby hospital, and the
seven others were injured, two of them critically.
Police believe that the explosion came from a
package left at the post office. It was the greatest
death toll from a bomb in Israel since three per
sons were killed in an explosion at a bus stop in
another Tel Aviv suburb, Petah Tikva, on May 23,
1979.
The Palestine Liberation Organization claimed
responsibility for yesterday's explosion at
Civatayim,a Tel Aviv suburb. French neo-Nazis are
believed to have planted the Paris bomb, which
claims its fourth victim with the death of an injured
man yesterday.
In Beirut a spokesman for the PLO said, "The
Abu Hasan Salameh group entered the occupied
lands and went to the position they were assigned
to and placed a time bomb in a post office in
Givatayim. All our revolutionaries returned faith
fully to their base."
The Cabinet of Prime Minister Menachem Begin
made no mention of the Israeli bomb incident but
issued a statement expressing its deep shock over
the attack in Paris.

Search for survivors continues
(uneau, Alaska — The abandoned cruise liner
Prinsendam was left burning 120 miles oft the rug
ged Alaskan coast yesterday as the Coast Guard
hunted the stormy waters tor possible stragglers
among the more than 500 passengers and crew
members forced to jump ship.
More than 13 hours atter the call to abandon
ship was sounded and the passengers and crew
took to lifeboats, liferafts and helicopters, the
Coast Guard said everyone had been plucked to
safety.
"But when we took a head count, we realized
that we were about 18 people short, and the Air
Force said it could not account for two paramedics
who had been lowered to one liferaft," Coast
Guard spokesman Phillip Franklin said yesterday.
He said a Coast Guard C-130 search plane and
the Coast Guard cutter Boutwell found the missing
liferaft early yesterday and the 20 passengers were
taken aboard the cutter.
"We feel now that we have everyone, but until
we can get everybody on dry land, line them up
and count heads we are going to keep search units
on scene," Franklin said.
About 40 crewmen who had remained behind to
fight the fire also were taken off the Prinsendam
late Saturday.
A Coast Guard C-130 and two cutters continued
the search, with seas running 12 to 14 feet high and
winds gusting to 40 miles per hour in the area.
NOW vows to picket Reagan
San Antonio, Texas — Denouncing what it called
Ronald Reagan's "medieval stance on women's
issues," the National Organization for Women
voted yesterday to picket Reagan and running
mate George Bush wherever they appear between
now and the Nov. 4 election.
The 125,000 member NOW, the nation's largest
feminist organization, also endorsed the Democ
ratic Party platform as it pertains to women's rights
but did not endorse President Jimmy Carter's re
lection bid.
It did, however, soften its anti-Carter position at
its annual convention here by withdrawing a re
solution passed in December that stated NOW's
opposition to Carter no matter who opposed him.
There was some sentiment among the 1100 de
legates for an endorsement of John Anderson,
who has embraced feminist issues, but the major
ity believed a vote for the independent candidate
would be a vote for Reagan.
Condemnation of Reagan by acclamation set off
a floor demonstration with delegates clapping and
chanting, "ERA, here to stay. Ronald Reagan, no
way."
Unacceptable to NOW were Reagan's anti
abortion and anti-Equal Rights Amendment
stands. The anti-Reagan resolution called him a
"captive of the radical right" and said he wants to
"return women to the 19th century."
