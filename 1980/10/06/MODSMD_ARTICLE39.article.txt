# Bad check writing on the rise
## 
### Mary Viv Lawson 
The circulation of invalid checks on campus has
been increasing over the last three years, accord
ing to University Bursar Joseph Jed.
He said in the 1977-78 academic year a monthly
average of $36,000 passed his office in the form of
invalid checks. However, the amount of money
delayed or lost within the University was $69,000 a
month over the past academic year. Attempts to
track the debtors are made throughout the year,
but at the end of this last summer quarter $383,000
in bad checks remained outstanding.
Often innocent mistake
Of course many times the offender has made an
innocent mistake and payment is prompt and ac
companied by profuse apologies. According to
Jed, such errors often occur when the bank has
not processed enough funds for the student to
register. These students merely pay the standard
five dollar charge for returned checks and the ap

propriate deferment charges.
The real problem lies with students who do not
answer the telegrams and calls of the controller.
Registration is held on students who have incurred
debts, but if the student has no money, holds can
only ensure that no further debts are incurred.
Jed said many student offenders fail to realize
the severity of the crime they are committing. He
said, under the California Penal Code, intent to
defraud, in the form of writing a check that the
offender knows is not backed by sufficient funds,
is a felony and punishable by up to 14 years im
prisonment.
This problem also brings up the question of
whether the offense violates the Fundamental
Standard. Jed said under these circumstances the
Stanford Judicial Council can take no action since
most of the offenders are no longer students. The
only alternative is to call the local sheriff's office.
The University has contacted the authorities in
some cases, but it has never as yet, taken a case to

court.
Jed stressed that his objective is not to catch
"crooks," but rather to collect that money due the
University and prevent honest students from tak
ing the burden of the loss. He also noted that
although the figures sound high, they are small
when judged in relation to the millions of dollars
the University handles.
Not just students
When a local department store was contacted,
the spokeswoman cited no unusual growth in the
number of invalid checks from Stanford students.
She noted, however, a general increase in the
problem from all customers, and the students are
representative of the same phenomenon.
She also cited the increased problem as the exp
lanation for tighter credit guidelines in the form of
a requirement of two forms of identification to
write a check. And many stores require that the
check be from a local bank. Stores will now often
phone the bank and clear the check before cash
ing it.
