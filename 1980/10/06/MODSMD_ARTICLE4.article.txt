# Tresidder committee to map union's future
## 
### Mac Funk 
In an effort to examine issues fac
ing Tresidder Union in the next de
cade and to elicit student input on
those issues, the new Tresidder
Union Board, comprised of students,
faculty and staff members, will meet
for the first time tomorrow night.
The inception of the board, ac
cording to Ellie Oppenheim, director
of Tresidder Union, represents a
change in focus for Tresidder.
During the late '60s and early 70s,
the union lost large amounts of
money due to inefficient programs
and retail services. Oppenheim said.
The worst year was 1971-72, when the
union lost more than $300,000.
Financial woes faced
However, during the last decade
the union stabilized 11nancially under
the leadership of tormer director
Dan Williams, said Oppenheim.
"We've reached a period of finan
cial stability. Now we can go beyond
the basics in being more responsive

to the Stanford community."
The proposal to establish a union
hoard, written by Williams in Oc
tober 1979, said the last decade was a
time to "correct the serious financial
problems which plagued the various
retail services."
"In large part that objective has
been achieved," the proposal said.
"It is nov. time to turn attention to
the union's future â€” the direction
that should be taken with regard to
programs, activities and services.
Initially the board was set to con
vene last spring, said Oppenheim,
but that was postponed by a series of
events, including the resignation of
Williams and the renegotiation of all
ot the union's tood contracts.
Board's role vague
The exact role ot the union board is
still "a gray area," according to Mark
Ventresca, who will represent the
Council of Presidents as an ex officio
member of the union board.
"We will start somewhere bet
ween being an advisory board and a
policy-setting board," said Ven
tresca. "We can't be sure right now
how much authority we will be given
at the start.
"It will be a long year," he said.
We are starting an organization
which will eventually have a lot of
responsibility. The job must be done
well and thoroughly."
"The great thing," said Doug
Mitchell, ASSU senate chairperson
and a member of the board, "is that
everyone is looking forward. Tresid
der is right on the verge of becoming
a real student union."
Members of board
The board consists of five stu
dents, two faculty members, two
statf members and five non-voting or
ex officio members.
