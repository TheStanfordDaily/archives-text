# Finds little support on campus
## Williams urges 'Indian's'return 
### Mike Vaska 
Facing strong opposition to his
cause, Timm Williams (Chief light
foot), the man who personified the
Indian mascot at Stanford tor two de
cades, spoke in White Plaza Friday
afternoon to call for the return of the
Indian.
Williams spoke to a sparse crowd
of ICK) persons, many of whom wore
yellow armbands supplied bv the
ASSU Council of Presidents to signify
their disapproval ot the? Indian mas
cot.
"Eliminating the Indian symbol

helps no Indian at all," Williams said.
He asserted that since the Indian
mascot has disappeared from the
Stanford scene, little has been done
to help native American students
here.
Native Americans need all the help
society can give them, Williams said.
"We don't need people shutting us
out and forgetting about us," he
said.
"An American Indian would rather
be kicked than forgotten," he said.
In the eight years since former
University President Richard Lyman

eliminated the Indian mascot from
Stanford, there has been a "great
backlash in America by those op
posed to Indians' attempts to move
forward in society," said Williams.
To illustrate this backlash, he cited
congressional attempts to take away
native American fishing rights and
the possibility that coal reserves
under native American land may be
taken as well.
Williams said he never intended to
use the Indian mascot in a derogat
ory way.
"I tried to portray the Indian to
exemplify courage and integrity and
to educate fans on Indian heritage,"
he said.
Williams said he was proud to be a
native American, and he will con
tinue to fight for the rights of native
Americans and to seek support for
them wherever he can find it.
After the rally, sophomore Tony
Kahn, a native American, said all Wil
liams' facts were true, but he added,
when people see an Indian mascot
on the field they do not receive a true
representation of native Americans.
Two committees are being formed
to involve students and any other
groups such as the Athletic Depart
ment and the band in the selection
and design process fora new mascot,
COP member Mark Ventresca said.
COP member Dick Butterfield said
simply, "there will be no Indian mas
cot."
He said the COP is tired of having
the issue forced on the students by
Williams and Larry Ziebell, head of a
group working to reinstate the In
dian mascot.
Ziebell has also pressured the
Stanford band on the mascot issue,
according to Band Manager Bruce
Heiman.
"Ziebell hinted at offering sums of
money recently to remove the Stan
ford tree from the field," he said.
Heiman called this action a "covert
bribe" and said he was tired of deal
ing with Ziebell.
