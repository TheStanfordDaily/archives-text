## Williams urges 'Indian's'return 
### Mike Vaska 
Facing strong opposition to his
cause, Timm Williams (Chief light
foot), the man who personified the
Indian mascot at Stanford tor two de
cades, spoke in White Plaza Friday
afternoon to call for the return of the
Indian.
Williams spoke to a sparse crowd
of ICK) persons, many of whom wore
yellow armbands supplied bv the
ASSU Council of Presidents to signify
their disapproval ot the? Indian mas
cot.
"Eliminating the Indian symbol

helps no Indian at all," Williams said.
He asserted that since the Indian
mascot has disappeared from the
Stanford scene, little has been done
to help native American students
here.
Native Americans need all the help
society can give them, Williams said.
"We don't need people shutting us
out and forgetting about us," he
said.
"An American Indian would rather
be kicked than forgotten," he said.
In the eight years since former
University President Richard Lyman

eliminated the Indian mascot from
Stanford, there has been a "great
backlash in America by those op
posed to Indians' attempts to move
forward in society," said Williams.
To illustrate this backlash, he cited
congressional attempts to take away
native American fishing rights and
the possibility that coal reserves
under native American land may be
taken as well.
Williams said he never intended to
use the Indian mascot in a derogat
ory way.
