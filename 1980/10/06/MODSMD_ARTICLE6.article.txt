# Congress passes legislation to prohibit police raids on journalists
## Response to Stanford Daily case, bill does not protect other innocent parties 
### Dan Fiduccia 
In April 1971, Palo Alto police officers raided the
offices ot the Stanford Daily. That search led to a
landmark 1978 Supreme Court decision and to the
passage of legislation in the U.S. Congress last week.
After police searched the Daily's offices for non
existent photographs of a riot in which Daily staffers
were not involved, the Daily sued local law enforce
ment officials.
Although two federal courts sided with the Daily,
the Supreme Court reversed those rulings and said
neither the 112 irst nor Fourth Amendments prohibit
police from using search warrants against non
suspect journalists or other persons.
The Daily argued to the high court that police
should use subpoenas, which provide both side l the
opportunity to argue their case in court before mcte
rial is turned over, instead of no-notice search w. r
rants against third-parties (persons not suspected o! a
crime).
The Supreme Court's decision caused an uproar
among civil liberties advocates. In response, more
than two dozen bills were introduced in Congress in
the last two years. The bills differed as to if they would
protect only journalists or all third-parties, and if they
would prohibit the actions of federal agents only or
all federal, state and local law enforcement officials.
The Senate approved a bill protecting journalists
on Aug. 4, and on Sept. 22 the House of Representa
tives followed suit with a slightly different version. A

joint committee worked out the differences and the
House approved the final bill last Wednesday.
That bill will protect journalists and all those engag
ing in "First Amendment research," including scho
lars, from raids conducted by federal, state and local
law enforcement agencies.
The bill is similar to one proposed last year by
President jimmy Carter and a White House spokes
man said last week the president looks forward to
signing the bill.

Karen Christensen, legislative counsel for the
American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said
"despite the fact that the third-party provisions are
merely guidelines, the ACLU regards (this legislation)
as a major civil liberties victory in the 96th Congress.
However, the bill contains exceptions for when
police may use search warrants against journalists:
— When there is reason to believe that the evi
dence would be concealed, destroyed or tampered
with if police used a subpoena instead of a search
warrant;
— When there is reason to believe that the person
possessing the materials has committed or is commit
ting a criminal act. Mere possession of the materials
would not be considered a criminal act;
— When the material is classified or pertains to

national security. However, Congress has said its in
tent is such that "national security" searches will be
permitted only against persons determined to be
working for a foreign government or against the in
terests of the United States;
— When there is reason to believe that immediate
seizure is necessary to prevent death or serious bod
ily injury to someone;
— When the material has not been produced after
it was subpoenaed, and delay would "threaten the
interests of justice."
Persons who file suit and are found to have been
illegally searched will receive actual damages of at
least $1000 plus attorney fees. A section to allow for
punitive damages was deleted from the bill.
Since 1971, when the Daily was the first newspaper
to be searched in American history, to the Sup
reme Court ruling, 14 news medial organizations
were raided. Since 1978, three more such searches
have been conducted.
In addition, the bill does not protect non-suspects
who are not journalists. Police have raided the offices
of doctors and lawyers — whose confidentiality is
protected by law — 12 times since 1971. Ten ot those
raids came in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling.
Law enforcement groups have lobbied against any
restrictions on searches of doctors, lawyers and other
citizens. So far, Congress has refused to put any re
strictions on state and local police.
Nevertheless, the bill requires the U.S. Attorney
General to draw up guidelines for federal agents who
» — ■ ■ ■*»»»»»» ■■■■■■

conduct searches, although less than 10 percent of all
raids against non-suspects have been conducted by
federal officials.
Those guidelines are expected to require that fed
eral agents use a subpoena when possible, that they
show special considerations for those with privileges
(such as lawyers and doctors), that federal agents
who misuse this process will be subject to administra
tive sanctions, and that all raids of this type will be
reported.
"The guidelines are an improvement over current
law and we hope for fuller protection in another
Congress," said Christensen.
The Carter administration's position on the matter
has been unclear. The lustice Department first op
posed the Daily before the Supreme Court. Then,
days after the ruling, Justice Department officials said
they would seek legislation overturning the decision.
Last summer they reneged on a promise to provide
guidelines for third party searches, provoking pro
tests from several U.S. Senators.
The White House, which last year told the Daily it
would also write legislation to protect lawyers and
doctors, has yet to do so.
At the state level, California, Oregon and Wiscon
sin and others have passed legislation since the Stan
ford Daily ruling. California has one law which abso
lutely protects journalists from these searches and
another which permits searches against doctors and
lawyers to be conducted in a fashion different from
other searches.

passage of legislation in the U.S. Congress last week.
After police searched the Daily's offices for non
existent photographs of a riot in which Daily staffers
were not involved, the Daily sued local law enforce
ment officials.
Although two federal courts sided with the Daily,
the Supreme Court reversed those rulings and said
neither the 112 irst nor Fourth Amendments prohibit
police from using search warrants against non
suspect journalists or other persons.
The Daily argued to the high court that police
should use subpoenas, which provide both side l the
opportunity to argue their case in court before mcte
rial is turned over, instead of no-notice search w. r
rants against third-parties (persons not suspected o! a
crime).
The Supreme Court's decision caused an uproar
among civil liberties advocates. In response, more
than two dozen bills were introduced in Congress in
the last two years. The bills differed as to if they would
protect only journalists or all third-parties, and if they
would prohibit the actions of federal agents only or
all federal, state and local law enforcement officials.
The Senate approved a bill protecting journalists
on Aug. 4, and on Sept. 22 the House of Representa
tives followed suit with a slightly different version. A

joint committee worked out the differences and the
House approved the final bill last Wednesday.
That bill will protect journalists and all those engag
ing in "First Amendment research," including scho
lars, from raids conducted by federal, state and local
law enforcement agencies.
The bill is similar to one proposed last year by
President jimmy Carter and a White House spokes
man said last week the president looks forward to
signing the bill.

Karen Christensen, legislative counsel for the
American Civil Liberties Union in Washington, said
"despite the fact that the third-party provisions are
merely guidelines, the ACLU regards (this legislation)
as a major civil liberties victory in the 96th Congress.
However, the bill contains exceptions for when
police may use search warrants against journalists:
— When there is reason to believe that the evi
dence would be concealed, destroyed or tampered
with if police used a subpoena instead of a search
warrant;
— When there is reason to believe that the person
possessing the materials has committed or is commit
ting a criminal act. Mere possession of the materials
would not be considered a criminal act;
— When the material is classified or pertains to

national security. However, Congress has said its in
tent is such that "national security" searches will be
permitted only against persons determined to be
working for a foreign government or against the in
terests of the United States;
— When there is reason to believe that immediate
seizure is necessary to prevent death or serious bod
ily injury to someone;
— When the material has not been produced after
it was subpoenaed, and delay would "threaten the
interests of justice."
Persons who file suit and are found to have been
illegally searched will receive actual damages of at
least $1000 plus attorney fees. A section to allow for
punitive damages was deleted from the bill.
Since 1971, when the Daily was the first newspaper
to be searched in American history, to the Sup
reme Court ruling, 14 news medial organizations
were raided. Since 1978, three more such searches
have been conducted.
In addition, the bill does not protect non-suspects
who are not journalists. Police have raided the offices
of doctors and lawyers — whose confidentiality is
protected by law — 12 times since 1971. Ten ot those
raids came in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling.
Law enforcement groups have lobbied against any
restrictions on searches of doctors, lawyers and other
citizens. So far, Congress has refused to put any re
strictions on state and local police.
Nevertheless, the bill requires the U.S. Attorney
General to draw up guidelines for federal agents who
» — ■ ■ ■*»»»»»» ■■■■■■

conduct searches, although less than 10 percent of all
raids against non-suspects have been conducted by
federal officials.
Those guidelines are expected to require that fed
eral agents use a subpoena when possible, that they
show special considerations for those with privileges
(such as lawyers and doctors), that federal agents
who misuse this process will be subject to administra
tive sanctions, and that all raids of this type will be
reported.
"The guidelines are an improvement over current
law and we hope for fuller protection in another
Congress," said Christensen.
The Carter administration's position on the matter
has been unclear. The lustice Department first op
posed the Daily before the Supreme Court. Then,
days after the ruling, Justice Department officials said
they would seek legislation overturning the decision.
Last summer they reneged on a promise to provide
guidelines for third party searches, provoking pro
tests from several U.S. Senators.
The White House, which last year told the Daily it
would also write legislation to protect lawyers and
doctors, has yet to do so.
At the state level, California, Oregon and Wiscon
sin and others have passed legislation since the Stan
ford Daily ruling. California has one law which abso
lutely protects journalists from these searches and
another which permits searches against doctors and
lawyers to be conducted in a fashion different from
other searches.
