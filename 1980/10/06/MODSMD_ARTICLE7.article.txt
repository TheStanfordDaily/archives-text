## Bomb explodes in Paris Anti-Semitic violence continuing 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Paris — Another bomb exp
losion rocked Paris yesterday
as French police, faced with
the discovery of fascists within
their own ranks, questioned
right-wing militants about a re
cent wave of anti-Semitic vio
lence and a deadly explosion at
a synagogue.
Police said a female Dutch
tourist was seriously injured
when a bomb ripped apart her
car, parked on Boulevard St.
Germaine in the Latin Quarter.
They said Carmelia Van Pusse
len, 33, of Brunssum, may lose
both legs.
Her husband told police his
family had driven to Paris from
the Netherlands for a weekend
holiday to celebrate his birth
day and that they were not
Jewish.
An anonymous telephone
caller told the French news
agency Agence France-Presse
the bombing was the work of

the Revolutionary Nationalist
Movement, an extreme
rightist group whose leader
was one of 13 people arrested
after Friday night's explosion in
front of a Paris synagogue.
Tel Aviv killings
The death toll from that blast
rose to four yesterday when a
4C-year-old man died from his
injuries. He, like the other
three victims, had been pas
sing by the synagogue when
the bomb went off.
Police said the Revolutionary
Nationalist Movement was well
known to them and had about
50 members, most of whom
were students. They said the
organization's leader, Jean-
Gilles Nalliarakis, had been
questioned and released.
No charges filed
Most of the other 12 right
wing militants also were re
leased with no charges filed
against them, police said. Nor
did they expect charges to be

filed against the militants still in
custody.
The wave of anti-Semitic vio
lence has prompted calls foran
investigation of the police
force itself.
The head of a police inspec
tors union disclosed Saturday
that Interior Minister Christian
Bonnet had a list of 150 names
of members of a banned fascist
organization and, "unfortu
nately for the profession," 30
of them were policemen.
French Jewish organizations
have called for a parliamentary
committee to investigate the
police, and for the resignation
of Bonnet, whose ministry is in
charge of law enforcement.
The synagogue bombing,
which occurred while Sabbath
services were drawing to an
end within the temple, was the
sixth anti-Semitic attack in Paris
within a week and the first to
cause casualties.
Alarmed by the violence,

Jews and their supporters
staged massive demonstra
tions Saturday night that drew
as many as 20,000 people into
the streets of Paris around the
broad, tree-lined Champs Elys
ses, the Interior Ministry and
the ornate opera house.
Israel yesterday expressed
its outrage at the fatal Paris
synagogue bombing and the
Cabinet called on French Jews
to organize their own self de
fense.


Munich, Germany. Waitresses, normally busy carrying the beersteins
to thirsty customers, read the Munich papers in an empty beer tent of
reports on the bombing blast that took 12 lives and injured 141 near
the grounds of the "Oktoberfest" beer festival on September 26.
