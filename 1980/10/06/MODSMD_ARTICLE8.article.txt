# Press liberalized in China

From the Daily wire services
Beijing — The People's Republic of China
celebrated its 31st birthday Wednesday with the
bulk of Chinese apparently convinced, finally,
that Deng Xiaoping's liberal policies are here to
stay.
Indeed, the public mood seemed almost
euphoric on the national day after a year of
steady gains over the vice chairman's ideologi
cal and bureaucratic foes. Pay and production
are up, consumer goods and groceries fill the
stores, and the old revolutionary slogans have
vanished — even the sayings of Chairman Mao.
It certainly was not this way a year ago. On the
30th anniversary of Mao Zedong's proclama
tion of the People's Republic, portraits of the
late chairman still adorned most public build
ings, and many Chinese worried that his radical
ideology might stage a comeback at any mo
ment. Deng still faced opposition in the Polit
buro while nervous officials at every level drag
ged their feet on modernization.
Deng swept away the last vestiges of opposi
tion — in public, at least — earlier last month at

the two week annual session of China's parlia
ment, the National People's Congress. The NPC
installed the 76-year-old vice chairman's pro
tege, Zhao Ziyang, 61, in the premier's post pre
viously held by party chairman HuaGuotengand
Deng himself confidently stepped down trom
the vice premiership.
On the eve of the national day the Beijing
Daily, official Communist Party organ in the cap
ital, asked rhetorically, "Will the Democratic
breeze of spring continue on in the newspap
ers?" The answer of its deputy editor-in-chief
Zhang Dazhong read like a national newspaper
week editorial in the United States: "In princi
ple, the people are the masters of the country.
How is it possible for them to be the masters if
they do not know the actual situation of the
country ?"
Zhang concluded, "There are piles of old
problems and new problems are emerging con
stantly. Our papers should praise the successes
in accordance with the line of policy of the party
— and at the same time criticize the old dogmas,
the old ideology."
