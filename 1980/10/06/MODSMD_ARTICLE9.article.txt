# Best weapon: zealous youths
## Iranian army 'fearless' 
### Los Angeles Times 
Al Paw, Iraq — On moonlit nights, thevillagers
here say, before Iraq's war with Iran, fanatic
young followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini often came down to the Iranian side of the
al Arab waterway, stood on the muddy
bank, and howled.
Draped in white burial shrouds, the Shia Mos
lem symbol of readiness to die for the faith, and
shining in the light of the moon, the young men
bared their chests, chanted slogans and prayers,
and dared Iraqi soldiers to shoot them down.
"It was crazy," said Abdul Razzak, the ad
ministrator of an oil storage depot in this town
on the west bank of the Shatt. "But there they
were."
Now, Iraq's army is going into battle against
the young men around Khorramshahr, Iran's oil
port and the first great strategic prize in the
Persian Gulf war.
That may be Iraq's greatest problem. For the
Revolutionary Guards of Iran, while ill-trained
and ill-organized, are also zealous, fearless, and
ready to die. Under Iranian Shia belief, any man
who dies fighting the infidel goes directly to
heaven —and infidel is precisely what Khomeini
calls Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Regrouping
The battle for Khorramshahr is only begin
ning. The Iraqis, halted at the gates of the city for
more than a week, then moved new tanks and
infantry to their front lines on the east bank of
the Shatt al Arab, about two miles north of Khor
ramshahr's outskirts.
From the west bank of the river, directly ac
ross from the port, they are pumping in artillery
fire most of the day. On Thursday, they scored at
least nine hits on Iranian oil installations, send
ing new columns of black smoke boiling into the
sky behind the green date palm plantations on
the opposite shore.
But the Iranians, too, are reinforcing. For the
first time Thursday, Iranian artillery was consis
tently hitting the Iraqi batteries on the west
bank. Reports from Iran indicated that Tehran's
army may finally be regrouping, bringing in
troops and weapons from the vast interior to
help turn back the Iraqi invaders.
Rejection good strategy
There has not yet been a true, large-scale bat
tle in this war. The Iraqis have been holding
miles of desert which they appear to have taken
easily when the Iranians fell back. But there has
been no real test of the Iranian army under close
fire.

Already, however, it is clear that the Iranians
are resisting with more tenacity than the Iraqis,
or the rest of the world, expected. On Wednes
day, Tehran Radio claimed that Iranian forces
drove the Iraqis about three miles back from
Khorramshahr, and reports from that front, offi
cially closed to reporters, seemed to support the
claim.
Thus Iran's rejection of Iraq's call for a cease
fire in place may be good strategy as well as plain
Iranian stubbornness.
Constant fighting
Iran's forces are not limited to militant teena
gers in tennis shoes and burial shrouds. The
other element in the defense of Khorramshahr is
the regular army, which has been fighting al
most steadily since Khomeini's rise to power last
year — against Kurdish rebels and other domes
tic insurgents. Western military attaches in
Tehran say the army is not in good shape, but it
is far from the collapse that was often predicted
after Khomeini fired or executed virtually all its
senior officers.
If thearmy'scampaign against the Kurds is any
indication, the regular Iranian armed forces
should be able to hold off the Iraqis, but proba
bly will not be able to push them back out of
Iranian territory.
At Khorramshahr, the Iranians have already
turned back several Iraqi probes into the city,
according to both Iranian and Iraqi sources, and
the Iraqis have returned to shelling Iranian posi
tions from long distance.
Across the river in Al-Faw, and in the string of
little date palm farming villages lining the Iraqi
side of the river, the artillery duels are there to
watch like a display of lethal fireworks.
The villages are half empty now. Outside one
of them, Sihan, a national police station lay
abandoned in the sun, with only a stray white
kitten walking its halls and green vines already
growing over its windows in the river's sticky
humidity. From behind, the dull thump of out
going Iraqi artillery kept up rhythmically. The
whistle of the Iranian shells coming in overhead
was not as regular.
In front of the river, with half a dozen small
freighters from different countries still tied up
where their crews abandoned them on the first
day of the fighting.
And beyond, about 400 yards across the wa
ter, is Iran — a jungle of dark green palm fronds
with the silver tanks and tubes of oil installations
rising from the forest here and there, usually
burning.

is far from the collapse that was often predicted
after Khomeini fired or executed virtually all its
senior officers.
If thearmy'scampaign against the Kurds is any
indication, the regular Iranian armed forces
should be able to hold off the Iraqis, but proba
bly will not be able to push them back out of
Iranian territory.
At Khorramshahr, the Iranians have already
turned back several Iraqi probes into the city,
according to both Iranian and Iraqi sources, and
the Iraqis have returned to shelling Iranian posi
tions from long distance.
Across the river in Al-Faw, and in the string of
little date palm farming villages lining the Iraqi
side of the river, the artillery duels are there to
watch like a display of lethal fireworks.
The villages are half empty now. Outside one
of them, Sihan, a national police station lay
abandoned in the sun, with only a stray white
kitten walking its halls and green vines already
growing over its windows in the river's sticky
humidity. From behind, the dull thump of out
going Iraqi artillery kept up rhythmically. The
whistle of the Iranian shells coming in overhead
was not as regular.
In front of the river, with half a dozen small
freighters from different countries still tied up
where their crews abandoned them on the first
day of the fighting.
And beyond, about 400 yards across the wa
ter, is Iran — a jungle of dark green palm fronds
with the silver tanks and tubes of oil installations
rising from the forest here and there, usually
burning.
Al Paw, Iraq — On moonlit nights, thevillagers
here say, before Iraq's war with Iran, fanatic
young followers of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini often came down to the Iranian side of the
al Arab waterway, stood on the muddy
bank, and howled.
Draped in white burial shrouds, the Shia Mos
lem symbol of readiness to die for the faith, and
shining in the light of the moon, the young men
bared their chests, chanted slogans and prayers,
and dared Iraqi soldiers to shoot them down.
"It was crazy," said Abdul Razzak, the ad
ministrator of an oil storage depot in this town
on the west bank of the Shatt. "But there they
were."
Now, Iraq's army is going into battle against
the young men around Khorramshahr, Iran's oil
port and the first great strategic prize in the
Persian Gulf war.
That may be Iraq's greatest problem. For the
Revolutionary Guards of Iran, while ill-trained
and ill-organized, are also zealous, fearless, and
ready to die. Under Iranian Shia belief, any man
who dies fighting the infidel goes directly to
heaven —and infidel is precisely what Khomeini
calls Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Regrouping
The battle for Khorramshahr is only begin
ning. The Iraqis, halted at the gates of the city for
more than a week, then moved new tanks and
infantry to their front lines on the east bank of
the Shatt al Arab, about two miles north of Khor
ramshahr's outskirts.
From the west bank of the river, directly ac
ross from the port, they are pumping in artillery
fire most of the day. On Thursday, they scored at
least nine hits on Iranian oil installations, send
ing new columns of black smoke boiling into the
sky behind the green date palm plantations on
the opposite shore.
But the Iranians, too, are reinforcing. For the
first time Thursday, Iranian artillery was consis
tently hitting the Iraqi batteries on the west
bank. Reports from Iran indicated that Tehran's
army may finally be regrouping, bringing in
troops and weapons from the vast interior to
help turn back the Iraqi invaders.
Rejection good strategy
There has not yet been a true, large-scale bat
tle in this war. The Iraqis have been holding
miles of desert which they appear to have taken
easily when the Iranians fell back. But there has
been no real test of the Iranian army under close
fire.

Already, however, it is clear that the Iranians
are resisting with more tenacity than the Iraqis,
or the rest of the world, expected. On Wednes
day, Tehran Radio claimed that Iranian forces
drove the Iraqis about three miles back from
Khorramshahr, and reports from that front, offi
cially closed to reporters, seemed to support the
claim.
Thus Iran's rejection of Iraq's call for a cease
fire in place may be good strategy as well as plain
Iranian stubbornness.
Constant fighting
Iran's forces are not limited to militant teena
gers in tennis shoes and burial shrouds. The
other element in the defense of Khorramshahr is
the regular army, which has been fighting al
most steadily since Khomeini's rise to power last
year — against Kurdish rebels and other domes
tic insurgents. Western military attaches in
Tehran say the army is not in good shape, but it
is far from the collapse that was often predicted
after Khomeini fired or executed virtually all its
