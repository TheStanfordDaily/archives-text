From the Daily wire services
Washington — In his bid for re
election, President Jimmy Carter is
offering a $27.6 billion tax-cut pac
kage that represents a dramatic de
parture from Democratic Party tradi
tion.
Basic ally, Carter's plan would have
the effect of shitting more of the fed
eral tax burden away from business
and onto individuals.
Ever since Franklin D. Roosevelt's
New Deal tax measures aimed at halt
ing the Great Depression nearly 50
years ago, Democratic chief execu
tives have tried to spur the economy
by trimming personal income taxes
to increase consumer buying power.
Modernization
However, Carter has accepted the
current consensus in Congress that
American industry, struggling to
modernize its plants to meet foreign
competition, deserves the bulk of
the benefits from tax reduction in
1981 and beyond.
"It's very heavily weighted toward
business," a labor union economist
lamented privately about Carter's
plan. "In fact, 55 percent of the be
nefits would go to business next year
and that percentage would rise to 65
percent by 1985."
In the past, even Republican pres
idents have proposed reductions for
individuals that were twice or three
times as great as those recom
mended for business.
But Carter has tried to provide
some tax break for almost everyone
in the campaign-oriented plan he
announced just before the start of
the fall election season.
Here are the plan's highlights:

— A Sl2-billion reduction in fed
eral income taxes, designed to offset
most of the scheduled increase in
Social Security taxes next year.
Under his plan, both employers and
employees would receive an income
tax credit equal to 8 percent of Social
Security taxes. Business, along with a
few state governments and non
profit institutions, would get $6-
billion worth of benefits.
— A $6.3-billion reduction in busi
ness taxes through faster tax write
offs of new equipment. Overall, the
plan would reduce by 40 percent the
time it now takes to get full deprecia
tion for tax purposes.
— The third-biggest tax cut in Car
ter's package would reduce the so
called "marriage penalty," now paid
by 16 million or more couples by $4.7
billion. It would lower the taxes of
married working couples, especially
those with combined incomes of
more than $30,000 a year.
— On the low-income side, Carter
proposes a bigger grant under the
earned-income credit program for
the so-called "working poor" who
make $11,000 a year or less and are
heads of families. He advocates an
increase in the maximum federal
payment to such persons to $840
from $500 at an additional cost of
$900 million a year.
— In a controversial business-tax
cut suggestion, Carter asked Con
gress to approve cash payments,
equal to 30 percent of the conven
tional investment tax credit, to firms
that owe no taxes because they have
lost money or their earnings are low.
