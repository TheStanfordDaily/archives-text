# High rents hit Hong Kong
## 
### Associated Press 
Hong Kong — If you're looking for a million
dollar house, don't come to Hong Kong until
you've saved some more money.
For a million dollars, you might find a very
small house or a large apartment, but spacious
one-family homes are so scarce in this tiny,
overcrowded British colony that sale prices are
now closer to $2 million if you can find one.
According to the latest Department of Hous
ing figure, there were 3 300 houses in Hong
Kong at the end of 1979, including 300 built be
fore World War II and several hundred farm
houses in the New Territories near the Chinese
border.
A modern, Western-style home with about
eight rooms is an equally expensive luxury to
rent — with prices averaging more than $7 000
U.S. per month and soaring as high as $12,000
U.S. per month.
In 1978, China launched its modernization
drive and Hong Kong ended a 12-year
moratorium and allowed foreign banks to set up
full-service branches in the colony. The influxof
foreign bankers and businessmen trying to take
advantage of these two events increased the
demand for housing and contributed to soaring

rents and sale prices.
Local property speculators trying to take ad
vantage of the increased demand tor housing
sent the rent spiral even higher.
A survey last March by Business International,
an independent business information or
ganization, found that housing costs in Hong
Kong at the top end of the market are now the
highest in Asia — exceeding even those in Tokyo
— and close to the highest in the world.
In an effort to clamp down on skyrocketing
rents, the Hong Kong government last February
imposed a ceiling on rent increases for all old
leases, but new leases are not affected.
Despite the high prices, there are no signs
that the demand for executive housing is going
to diminish.
China trade is increasing and many interna
tional companies are using Hong Kong as a
gateway to Beijing. International oil companies
are expected to bid for offshore drilling rights in
China shortly and once those contracts are
awarded, a large influxofworkers and oil execu
tives is expected here.
With a land area of only 1 055 square kilomet
ers for more than five million people, space is at
a premium in Hong Kong — which accounts for
the tiny number of houses here.
