# Check cashing simplified
## 
### David Frank 
Having an out-of-state driver's license
need not precipitate an identity crisis every
time you try to cash a check outside Stan
ford's immediate area.
Stanford students from out of state fre
quently encounter check-writing difficulty
off the Farm because many businesses re
quire a California driver's license to verify
identification.
However, the California Department of
Motor Vehicles (DMV) offers non-
Californians the chance to end anonymity
and make check writing easier by selling a
California Identification card.
According to DMV officials, the card is as
valid as a driver's license in establishing per
sonal identity.
In fact, it closely resembles California
d r iver's license, bearing the same personal
information and full-face photograph.
DMV offices issue the card for $3.25, and
require a birth certificate, driver's license or
naturalization papers. The nearest office to
campus is located in Mountain View at 595
Showers Drive.
According to a DMV clerk, a temporary ID
is issued — withouta photograph — until the
finished identification can be mailed in 60 to
90 days.
Joyce Tremewan, branch manager of the
campus branch of Wells Fargo Bank, praised
the idea of a California ID card for out-of

state students. "A picture ID from California
definitely facilitates check-cashing and writ
ing," she said.
In general, Tremewan added, students
won't find many problems cashing checks at
the campus branch of Wells Fargo. Although
photo identification and a student identifica
tion are preferred, she said, the bank cashes
checks with either one or the other.
"We try to be as accommodating as we can
to Stanford students," she noted, adding that
other Wells Fargo branches and off-campus
banks usually are not as cooperative.
The campus bank also cashes out-of-state
personal checks up to $50 as long as the stu
dent has a Stanford identification card, Tre
mewan said.
Richard Miller, controller of the Stanford
Bookstore, also supported the DMV's
California Identification card, but noted the
bookstore's check cashing policies are le
nient.
"The bookstore will cash a check using just
about any two legitimate ID's as long as one
has a photograph or a signature on it,"he
said.
Miller added the bookstore will cash
checks of up to $10 over the amount of
purchase. To accommodate weekend spend
ing needs, he said, a cashier on the second
floor of the bookstore will cash checks of up
to $25 for a 10-cent fee, on Saturday only.
