# Astros dash Dodger dream
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Champagne puddled up in the low spots of
the floor in the Houston clubhouse and when
the Astros had poured all they had stored so
faithfully, they went to the cheaper stuff — beer,
orange juice, anything that flowed.
You might say the Houston Astros, now
champions of the National League West, were a
little on the happy side. They were also relieved
enough to admit that losing three straight to the
Dodgers was a little frightening, that they had
begun to entertain thoughts that weren't com
pletely positive.
"I'd be a liar if I said there weren't any
doubts," said Art Howe, the first baseman who
nailed a two-run homer in the third inning and
circled the bases with his first finger upraised,
the wildest gesture he'd ever made in a five-year
major league career. "But I knew I was gonna
come out and do the best I could."
The Astros scored twice in the first inning,
twice in the third and three times in the fourth to
beat the Dodgers, 7-1, and break the deadlock in
the West. Joe Niekro held the Dodgers to six hits
and few thrills.
"They jumped us early," said a weary Dusty
Baker, who may have played his last game as a
Dodger. "They jumped us and we never could
get back up."
The Dodgers had begun this series three
games behind the Astros with three games to
play. With three wins, crafted by a team that
seemed in the end to have more pluck than
luck, they forced yesterday's pre-playoff
playoff.
"No one," Joe Morgan said Friday, "can beat
us four straight games." He turned out to be
right, if only by the seam of a Niekro knuckle
ball.
"Only one team could go to Philadelphia,"

said a despondent Tom Lasorda. "It was Hous
ton. That means this can't be a good season. It
was exciting. The fans were excited and that
excited us. But I don't like to finish second."
This evening, when the Astros face the Phillies
and Steve Carlton in the first game of the Na
tional League playoffs, they just might wish to
themselves that it had happened another way.
The Phillies have Carlton rested and in position
to pitch a second time if the playoff goes five
games. Carlton was 2-0 against the Astros this
season and shut them out once.
The Astros will have no one on the roster
rested. They flew out of Los Angeles last night,
scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia at dawn to
day. The pitchers scheduled to start the first two
games, Ken Forsch and Nolan Ryan, have both
been moved up and will be working on three
days' rest.
It is a measure of the Astro staff that after three
of the most important games in the history of the
franchise, Astros Manager Bill Virdon still had
Niekro, a 19-game winner, rested for a playoff.
Niekro, a veteran of a lot of meaningless starts,
was just happy it was his turn. "I'd been looking
forward to this game for a 14-year career," he
said.
By game's end, the Astros were happy enough
to forgive Dodger catcher Joe Ferguson for kne
eing over Astro catcher Alan Ashby aftera play at
the plate, and the fans in the left field stands for
pelting Cruz with ice, fruit and toilet paper.
"It was a fun year, an exciting year," Don
Sutton said. "These past four games have been
the most exciting I've ever been associated
with."
It came to last-minute heroics because the
Dodgers had begun the season slowly, because
they had been riddled by injuries, because
Houston doesn't have a bad ball club.

Sutton said. "These past four games have been
the most exciting I've ever been associated
with."
It came to last-minute heroics because the
Dodgers had begun the season slowly, because
they had been riddled by injuries, because
Houston doesn't have a bad ball club.
Champagne puddled up in the low spots of
the floor in the Houston clubhouse and when
the Astros had poured all they had stored so
faithfully, they went to the cheaper stuff — beer,
orange juice, anything that flowed.
You might say the Houston Astros, now
champions of the National League West, were a
little on the happy side. They were also relieved
enough to admit that losing three straight to the
Dodgers was a little frightening, that they had
begun to entertain thoughts that weren't com
pletely positive.
"I'd be a liar if I said there weren't any
doubts," said Art Howe, the first baseman who
nailed a two-run homer in the third inning and
circled the bases with his first finger upraised,
the wildest gesture he'd ever made in a five-year
major league career. "But I knew I was gonna
come out and do the best I could."
The Astros scored twice in the first inning,
twice in the third and three times in the fourth to
beat the Dodgers, 7-1, and break the deadlock in
the West. Joe Niekro held the Dodgers to six hits
and few thrills.
"They jumped us early," said a weary Dusty
Baker, who may have played his last game as a
Dodger. "They jumped us and we never could
get back up."
The Dodgers had begun this series three
games behind the Astros with three games to
play. With three wins, crafted by a team that
seemed in the end to have more pluck than
luck, they forced yesterday's pre-playoff
playoff.
"No one," Joe Morgan said Friday, "can beat
us four straight games." He turned out to be
right, if only by the seam of a Niekro knuckle
ball.
"Only one team could go to Philadelphia,"

said a despondent Tom Lasorda. "It was Hous
ton. That means this can't be a good season. It
was exciting. The fans were excited and that
excited us. But I don't like to finish second."
This evening, when the Astros face the Phillies
and Steve Carlton in the first game of the Na
tional League playoffs, they just might wish to
themselves that it had happened another way.
The Phillies have Carlton rested and in position
to pitch a second time if the playoff goes five
games. Carlton was 2-0 against the Astros this
season and shut them out once.
The Astros will have no one on the roster
rested. They flew out of Los Angeles last night,
scheduled to arrive in Philadelphia at dawn to
day. The pitchers scheduled to start the first two
games, Ken Forsch and Nolan Ryan, have both
been moved up and will be working on three
days' rest.
It is a measure of the Astro staff that after three
of the most important games in the history of the
franchise, Astros Manager Bill Virdon still had
Niekro, a 19-game winner, rested for a playoff.
Niekro, a veteran of a lot of meaningless starts,
was just happy it was his turn. "I'd been looking
forward to this game for a 14-year career," he
said.
By game's end, the Astros were happy enough
to forgive Dodger catcher Joe Ferguson for kne
eing over Astro catcher Alan Ashby aftera play at
the plate, and the fans in the left field stands for
pelting Cruz with ice, fruit and toilet paper.
"It was a fun year, an exciting year," Don
Sutton said. "These past four games have been
the most exciting I've ever been associated
with."
It came to last-minute heroics because the
Dodgers had begun the season slowly, because
they had been riddled by injuries, because
Houston doesn't have a bad ball club.
