### Pamela Johnson 
"HARVEST — Opportunities
on the Farm" was a revrmpand
revision of the ASSU Council of
Presidents' traditional con
tribution to freshman orienta
tion, according to HARVEST
coordinator and COP member
Dayna Goldfine.
The event, held last Thurs
day, was the product of the
combined efforts of the ASSU,
Tresidder Student Union and
several other campus organiza
tions.
"In the past we've had
Orientation Night, Orientation
Activities Night and last year
Orientivities," said Goldfine.
These events tell short of
HARVEST in their value be
cause they ignored returning
students and focused only on
freshmen and transfer stu
dents, added Goldfine.
This year's activities lasted
from noon to midnight with a
2Vi hour pause from 4 to 6:30
p.m.
During the afternoon por
tion of HARVEST, booths for
nearly 100 students or
student-affiliated groups lined
the pathway from the tip of the
grassy area near Tresidder
down to the Post Office and

along the walkway in front of
the bookstore.
"It's inspiring for us to have
so much strong support," said
Beth Johnson, a dance instruc
tor here ano member of the
Dance Quorum. . *
Free exposure
Johnson's sentiments were
echoed by nvny groups which
welcomed the opportunity for
free exposure.
Some student members gave
live demonstrations of their
organizations' activities. Mike
Miiitello and David Wright, ice
hockey team members, swat
ted a roll of masking tape to
each other w th hockey sticks
to rouse interest in their sport.
The sole entertainer for the
first half of HARVEST was a stu
dent group — Bay Bop.
The second half of HARVEST,
however, was devoted entirely
to entertainment.
The Stanford Band, arriving
an hour earlier than
scheduled, shortened the gap
between the day and evening,
kicking off the evening fes
tivities.
The evening entertainment
was plentiful, as student
groups performed in an up
stairs room in Tresidder, silent

movies rolled in the Coffee
House and a mime troupe per
formed in front of Tresidder.
Free bowling was offered at
the Recreation Center and free
sundaes were available at the
Transition in Tresidder.
Students unaware
Although HARVEST activities
were numerous, some stu
dents revealed they did not
know anything unusual was
taking place.
"I didn't know what was
happening," said junior Or
lando Mays. "I saw a lot of
booths and people passing
through but I dfdn't really pay
attention."
When freshman Becky Wil
liams was told about HARVEST,
she said, "It's a neat idea to
have it but I didn't realize what
was going on until just now."
Several students com
mented HARVEST was a repeat
of registration day, while.one
student described it as "a re
gistration packet come to life.'.'
Other" students said HAR
VEST came too early or was
under-publicized.
Goldfine addressed these
complaints by saying HARVEST
sponsors wanted to extend
orientation and welcome re

turning students at the same
time.
"People get inundated with
so much advertising that un
less it's a tradition, people
often don't know something's
going on," Goldfine said.
Compliments for event
Fourth year medical student
Dave Adams, who spent his
undergraduate days here,
complimented the committee.
"They used to have a
freshman dance, which didn't
involve the upperclassmen at
all. With the freshman dance
the blind were with the blind.
This is great because it involves
everyone."
Goldfine said HARVEST is
the result of several years of
modifications in one' basic
idea. Although she would
change a few things, she said
she was very pleased with the
turnout.
"I'd like to see the name
stick," she said.-"I think we
have the makings ot a tradi
tion.".
A special noon meeting will
be held this Thursday in the
ASSU offices tp get feedback
from the student groups who
participated in the event..
