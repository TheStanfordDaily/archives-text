# New X-ray aids in cancer detection
## 
### Washington Post 
What promises to be the ul
timate X-ray machine, one that
could find tiny cancers or heart
defects long before they cause
trouble, is now being built at
the giant Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn.
The machine, a $5 million,
17-ton, doughnut-like device,
will whirl 28 X-ray machines
around a patient to make
thousands of images a second.
The images will be fed to a
computer to reconstruct any
part of the body.
In a period of a few seconds,
with no more X-ray exposure
than a few chest X-rays, the
machine will electronically
slice open any part of the body

or any organ in any direction,
transfer a series of images to
magnetic tape and display
them on a TV-like screen for
immediate or leisurely exami
nation.
The picture will show the
organ in three dimensions, al
most as if a surgeon had re
moved it. The machine can also
display the organ's interior, as
if the surgeon had then cut it
open.
Such organs as the heart,
blood vessels and lungs will be
seen at work with blood and
oxygen flowing through them.
Officials of the National In
stitutes of Health will join
Mayo scientists today to exp
lain progress so far on this

wondrous tool that NIH has al
ready called "revolutionary" in
its potential impact.
NlH's Division of Research
Resources and National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute has
provided $3 million so far to
supply four X-ray machines —
the Mayo scientists call them
"X-ray guns" — that let the de
vice's designers start tests this
year on animals and a tew
human beings.
At this point, however, NIH
officials don't know whether
this will be primarily a research

tool or a necessary one in
major medical centers. But Dr.
Earl Wood, a clinic scientist,
says,""l'd be very surprised if a
more compact version didn't
become commonplace. It may
even be a device someday for
masS-screening healthy people
to look for disease."
Whether or not this new
body reconstructor becomes a
standard tool, it is certain to
yield new knowledge of heart,
and blood vessel and other
physiological action.
