## The 						great white-haired hope 
### 
American liberalism, which
has lost much of its drive and
credibility in recent years, has
been dealt a telling blow by the
inept and confused presiden
tial campaign of independent
candidate John Anderson.
He began his campaign with
the announced intention of
providing an alternative to two
candidates deemed unaccept
able by many of the American
people. Over the summer his
strategy mellowed from a real
attempt to win the election to
providing a focal point for a
mere protest vote, despite the
fact that no recent presidential
campaign has seen such
generalised disaffection with
the candidates proferred by
the two major political parties.
The need for a viable liberal
alternative to President Jimmy
Carter's incompetence and
Ronald Reagan's corporate
machismo provided a golden
opportunity for both a victory
for liberal principles and a
meaningful challenge to the
American electoral system.
With the election less than a
month away and running mate
Pat Lucey (best known as Car
ter's "ugly American" ambas
sador to Mexico because he
spoke no Spanish) conceding
the impossibility of victory, the
Anderson candidacy has failed
to come close to either of these
goals.
The result of this shift in tac
tics is the strengthening of the
two-party system, whose
proponents will now be able to
point to its success and resili
ence in the face of yet another
challenge, and a weakening of
the liberal strain in American
politics, which has once again
failed to provide the American
people with a colorable per
formance.
While it was hopeless for
Anderson to win a majority of

the popular vote, a scenario for
his victory in the Electoral Col
lege was not beyond specula
tion. Anderson's liberal appeal
is most likely to strike a re
sponsive chord in just those
populous urban-industrial
states that control a majority of
the electoral vote.
His 50-cent-per-gallon gas tax
proposal, however unpalata
ble in places like Wyoming
where people have to drive 25
miles to go to the grocery
store, is at least credible to
people in places like New York
and Chicago. If Anderson was
really serious about winning
the election, he would have
concentrated on the cities and
big states (with even some
chance in occasionally liberal
California) and let born-again
Christians Reagan and Carter
fight it out for the South and
the Farm Belt states. In such a
scenario, an Anderson victory
would, for the first time in his
tory, place the major parties at
odds with an Electoral College
system that has always served
so well to protect them against
any new challengers.
Coupled with the resent
ment of the states Anderson
could not hope to carry (which
are not populous enough to
elect a president but which are
numerous enough to amend
the Constitution), this might
be enough to abolish the Elec
toral College once and for all.
Much of the country outside
the Northeast would feel that it
was protecting itself against
the oppressive encroachments
of urban liberalism, but the net
result might be a more diffuse
political system on the national
level once the chilling effect of
the winner-take-all electoral
system was removed from
candidates who aspired to ob
tain support from major por
tions a direct national electo

rate.
Instead, Anderson has cho
sen to aftect his "alternative"
by pouring his resources into
defeating obsolete state elec
tion laws and getting on the
ballot in all 50 states. How
ever worthwhile this goal, it
has not advanced Anderson's
chances of victory in
November. By diverting scarce
and badly-needed resources,
the ballot campaign has kept
him from waging vigorous
races in the states he needs to
win.
However important a prece
dent his ballot efforts set for
future independent cam
paigns, it is hard to imagine
Anderson, who declined to
form a new party, as a repeat
contender and future be
neficiary. More importantly,
the original and essential pre
mise of Anderson's candidacy
— to provide a real and mean
ingful chance to unseat Carter
and Reagan from acceding to
an office that demands com
passion as well as resolve —
seems to have been aban
doned.

The Anderson candidacy was
compelled by the political
exigencies of this election
year. Failing to take advantage
of those exigencies, the candi
dacy became less a political
campaign than a philosophical
statement. A vote for Anderson
at this point is less an attempt
to elect a candidate than it is a
statement.
However personally satisfy
ing this may be for candidate
and voter, it is a grave disser
vice to the American people,
who have essentially been
robbed of a choice. While los
ing battles in the states, the
two-party system has won the
war by "proving" once again
that an independent candidate
"can't" win a national election.
And American liberals must
endure at least four more years
of incompetence, conser
vatism, or both before having
another chance to provide the
American people with a credi
ble candidate.

month away and running mate
Pat Lucey (best known as Car
ter's "ugly American" ambas
sador to Mexico because he
spoke no Spanish) conceding
the impossibility of victory, the
Anderson candidacy has failed
to come close to either of these
goals.
The result of this shift in tac
tics is the strengthening of the
two-party system, whose
proponents will now be able to
point to its success and resili
ence in the face of yet another
challenge, and a weakening of
the liberal strain in American
politics, which has once again
failed to provide the American
people with a colorable per
formance.
While it was hopeless for
Anderson to win a majority of

the popular vote, a scenario for
his victory in the Electoral Col
lege was not beyond specula
tion. Anderson's liberal appeal
is most likely to strike a re
sponsive chord in just those
populous urban-industrial
states that control a majority of
the electoral vote.
His 50-cent-per-gallon gas tax
proposal, however unpalata
ble in places like Wyoming
where people have to drive 25
miles to go to the grocery
store, is at least credible to
people in places like New York
and Chicago. If Anderson was
really serious about winning
the election, he would have
concentrated on the cities and
big states (with even some
chance in occasionally liberal
California) and let born-again
Christians Reagan and Carter
fight it out for the South and
the Farm Belt states. In such a
scenario, an Anderson victory
would, for the first time in his
tory, place the major parties at
odds with an Electoral College
system that has always served
so well to protect them against
any new challengers.
Coupled with the resent
ment of the states Anderson
could not hope to carry (which
are not populous enough to
elect a president but which are
numerous enough to amend
the Constitution), this might
be enough to abolish the Elec
toral College once and for all.
Much of the country outside
the Northeast would feel that it
was protecting itself against
the oppressive encroachments
of urban liberalism, but the net
result might be a more diffuse
political system on the national
level once the chilling effect of
the winner-take-all electoral
system was removed from
candidates who aspired to ob
tain support from major por
tions a direct national electo

rate.
Instead, Anderson has cho
sen to aftect his "alternative"
by pouring his resources into
defeating obsolete state elec
tion laws and getting on the
ballot in all 50 states. How
ever worthwhile this goal, it
has not advanced Anderson's
chances of victory in
November. By diverting scarce
and badly-needed resources,
the ballot campaign has kept
him from waging vigorous
races in the states he needs to
win.
However important a prece
dent his ballot efforts set for
future independent cam
paigns, it is hard to imagine
Anderson, who declined to
form a new party, as a repeat
contender and future be
neficiary. More importantly,
the original and essential pre
mise of Anderson's candidacy
— to provide a real and mean
ingful chance to unseat Carter
and Reagan from acceding to
an office that demands com
passion as well as resolve —
seems to have been aban
doned.

The Anderson candidacy was
compelled by the political
exigencies of this election
year. Failing to take advantage
of those exigencies, the candi
dacy became less a political
campaign than a philosophical
statement. A vote for Anderson
at this point is less an attempt
to elect a candidate than it is a
statement.
However personally satisfy
ing this may be for candidate
and voter, it is a grave disser
vice to the American people,
who have essentially been
robbed of a choice. While los
ing battles in the states, the
two-party system has won the
war by "proving" once again
that an independent candidate
"can't" win a national election.
And American liberals must
endure at least four more years
of incompetence, conser
vatism, or both before having
another chance to provide the
American people with a credi
ble candidate.

the law school.)
American liberalism, which
has lost much of its drive and
credibility in recent years, has
been dealt a telling blow by the
inept and confused presiden
tial campaign of independent
candidate John Anderson.
He began his campaign with
the announced intention of
providing an alternative to two
candidates deemed unaccept
able by many of the American
people. Over the summer his
strategy mellowed from a real
attempt to win the election to
providing a focal point for a
mere protest vote, despite the
fact that no recent presidential
campaign has seen such
generalised disaffection with
the candidates proferred by
the two major political parties.
The need for a viable liberal
alternative to President Jimmy
Carter's incompetence and
Ronald Reagan's corporate
machismo provided a golden
opportunity for both a victory
for liberal principles and a
meaningful challenge to the
American electoral system.
