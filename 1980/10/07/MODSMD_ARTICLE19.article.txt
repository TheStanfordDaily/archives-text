Story misplaced
The Daily has always faith
fully reported world news,
local reports and campus
events which concern most of
us. Good show! But bad news
my friends! Your recent article
entitled "Student drug case" is
an abomination. In your Oc
tober 2 issue the AP line was
highlighted by a story on Iraq,
but because you had no "hot"
local story you dug up the stu
dent drug case and made it
front page news. Is this re
sponsible journalism?
In the past, the Daily edito
rial policy has been one con
cerned with sensitivity,
perhaps this policy should
apply tofront page news items.
What is your commitment to
your fellow students? Are you
so professional that you can
neglect their well-being? The
Peninsula Times Tribune didn't
even cover the story, and you
made it front page news. This
editorial decision is in poor
taste, and hurts your reputa
tion as well as those involved.
Perhaps in the future the quan
tity of news should not deter
mine journalism.

Shogun revisited
Last night my roommate at
tacked me with a doub
lehanded sword. Screaming
something about death and
honor he sliced the air just
above my head and then leapt
out of an open window — just
another Shogun burnout!
Few of us could have av
oided seeing at least part of the
NBC maxiseries — the buildup
to it was collossal, it being
hailed as the second-coming of
Roots. Afterwards I am left
wondering what all the fuss
was about. Certainly the series
was interesting and often in

formative (I always used to
think that the Shogun was an
exclusive Japanese restaurant
on El Camino), but was it really
that good ? The fact that over 40
percent of viewers watched
NBC in preference to all other
channels is a sad comment on
the trash that other stations
were broadcasting, rather than
the merits of the maxiseries.
Yet, in all fairness, how can
we expect stations to screen
higher quality programs if so
many people are willing to sit
through what they are already
showing. I think it is time for us
to stop acting like sheep and
make our feelings felt — don't
compromise for the best of a
bad bunch, use the'off'switch.
