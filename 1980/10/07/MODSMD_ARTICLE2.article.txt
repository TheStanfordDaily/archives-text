# Researcher finds old founding grant
## 
### Carol Shapiro 
While doing research for his re
cently published book, Peter Allen,
University editor emeritus, disco
vered the original copy of Stanford
University's founding grant.
As a University editor, Allen dealt
with various University publications
such as the annual report and publi
cations for alumni. In his first book,
From the Foothills to the Ray, which
was released Oct. 1, Allen presents
an informal history of Stanford.
At the University archives, Allen's
research included looking through
scrapbooks belonging to the Leland
Stanford family. Among the books,
he discovered an old newspaper
clipping which dealt with an elabo
rately written charter used at the first
board of trustees meeting.
According to the article, this par
ticular copy of the charter was ex
tremely impressive. After talking
with University Archivist Roxanne Ni
lan, Allen wondered where the char
ter had been placed.
Nilan looked through files of the
founding grant and found a memo
which showed the grant had been
deposited in a safety deposit box at
the Wells Fargo bank in Palo Alto.
Two signatures from a long list of

names were required to gain access
to the box. According to Al'en,
"Some of the people had died and
others no longer worked for the Uni
versity."
Two signatures, however, were fi
nally obtained. Kenneth Creighton,
University controller, and Kenneth
Cuthbertson, former vice-president
of development, gave permission to
open the box.
Allen stated, "I wasn't positive that
the box contained what Iwas looking
for." When the box was opened,
however, along with several old land
leases, the grant was found.
"The pages are about 10 by 13 in
ches in size," said Allen. "The cover
sheet and title page are elaborately
written."
Allen commented the existence of
the document was probably forgot
ten because no one particularly
needed it.
Many other versions of the charter
have been on file since the founding
of the University. A number of
copies, including several legal ver
sions, were made at the same time
this ceremonial document was writ
ten. The significance of the discovery
was that this particular ceremonial
copy has historical importance.
