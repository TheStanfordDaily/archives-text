## A
						candidate to believe in 
### 
"In times of crisis, history throws up great
men, but now history's just throwing up,"
shouted Senator T.J.R. Shmoe while kicking his
Presidential campaign into full swing yesterday.
The Senator, a right wing leftist at heart an
nounced his candidacy in an exclusive penetrat
ing interview with the Daily. Often labeled "the
ultimate candidate," Senator Shmoe has re
mained out of the limelight in his conquest for
the presidency, commenting, "When it comes
to a Grecian Formula commercial, the nation
and The League of Women Voters already have a
Before,' 'During,' and After.'
The Daily: Senator Shmoe, the people of the
United States have focused on the economy as
the most pressing problem. Do you have a solu
tion?
Senator Shmoe: To me, the economy is simple:
Please all the people, all the time, with all the
taxes, that all the people never want to pay. I
plan to double Social Security benefits, triple
welfare spending, cut taxes 50 percent,
nationalize health care, add 50,000 Federal
employees to the Federal Bureau of Bureauc
racy, and, most importantly, balance the
budget.
The Daily: But how do you plan to dole out more
by collecting less?
Senator Shmoe: Creative accounting.
The Daily: but no matter how you slice it, two
plus two is . .
Senator Shmoe: That's right, two plus two is
whatever Congress wants it to be. It's a trick I've
used for years and even now a USC economist
backs my theory that less is more. In fact, I've
got wage and price guidelines, credit controls,
oil taxes, and a Big Surprise, all forthe economy.
The Daily: A Big Surprise you say?
Senator Shmoe: Yup, from now on, I'm turning
the economy over to the Defense Department
Computer and whenever the economy fails I'll
blame it on the Russians!
The Daily: Masterful!
Senator Shmoe: You don't really think that
balancing the budget, tightening wage and price
controls, and squeezing credit does anything
for the economy; it just makes me look like I'm
doing something for the constituency. I'll never
admit that a thousand meaningless days of tin
kering does less for the economy than the
American people deciding to save instead of
spend.
The Daily: Fantastic! You've got everything the
people want from an election year: less taxes,
more spending, more benefits, and less work.
You're batting a thousand. Aside from the
economy, what do you see as your first great
foreign policy task?
Senator Shmoe: Sticking OPEC. Have you
noticed that whenever an OPEC price hike is
announced, pump prices skyrocket, even
though the higher priced oil won't reach the
pumps for months? If the people, Washington,

and even Chevrolet are going to blame OPEC,
I've got to do something r^sh.
The Daily: What could you possibly do?
Senator Shmoe: Well, it's evil, it's devastating,
it's inhuman.
The Daily: The Neutron Bomb? The plague? Jane
Fonda?
Senator Shmoe: Nope, I'm giving the GE oil
eating bacteria to the Israelis. Once they plop it
into Saudi Arabia, bye, bye, OPEC.
The Daily: Shrewd planning! Speaking of
foreign policy, what's your outlook for defense?
Senator Shmoe: I've got that covered too, I'm
proud to announce. I plan to grant a major de
fense contractor $64 billion to develop the Win
nebago missile system. Just think — ten
thousand Winnebagoes, and hiding behind the
kids, dogs, ice chests, and sleeping bags are
10,000 recreational ballistic missiles, aimed right
at the Russkis. Trying to track all those
Winebago s will scare the Russians right out of
their bearskins.
The Daily: But who could outfit such an awe
some regatta?
Senator Shmoe: Well, the Pentagon has worked
out a scheme to outfit the entire fleet with Billy
Carter clones. Forget the arms race, who needs
MX, we have RV!
The Daily: Sharp, very sharp. What about the
ever tense Taiwan issue that the other candi
dates have resurrected?
Senator Shmoe: I've already outdone them all. I
plan to recognize Japan as a third China and that
way no one can complain about a two China
policy!"
The Daily: Smashing! The draft is probably on
the minds of 19- and 20-year-olds. Would you
care to comment?
Senator Shmoe: The solution is so simple. I'll
introduce an amended selective servce bill re
quiring peacetime registration for 19-year-olds
•and all the members of Congress. It'll fail with
out debate!
The Daily: Beautiful. If Congress wants kids to
kill themselves, let Congress join 'em. But what
it by some fluke it passes?
SenatorShmoe: I'll win anyway. So the Russians
wipe us out. We'll tell 'em: 'so you beat a bunch
of overweight undertrained bureaucrats. You
must really thinkyou're tough. I mean the key is
to embarrass the Russians, isn't it.?"
The Daily: Will you be elected to the Presidency
in November?
Senator Shmoe: I think so. Judging by the last
two Presidential elections, I'm confident that
the majority of Americans will do the latest
American thing.
The Daily: What's that?
Senator Shmoe: Forget to vote.
The Daily: Thank you Mr. Shmoe, you are a true
asset to the 1980 political arena. You've finally
given us a candidate we can believe in.
