## No option in nuclear war 
### 
One of the big issues of the
1980 election is national de
fense. Both major presidential
candidates advocate building
up our nuclear arsenal (i.e. MX
missile system) to deter the
Soviet threat. It's simply a mat
ter of safety through strength.
Right?
Look at WW 11. If Europe had
built up its armed forces, Ger
many wouldn't have dared to
touch it. The same goes for Iran
today. Iran showed a little
weakness and Iraq moved right
in. They say the same thing
could happen to the U.S if we
don't build up our strength.
The Soviet Union could possi
bly beat us in a war. Right?
If just one of those bombs
being dropped on Baghdad
were nuclear, instead of con
ventional, you could say with
certainty that Iraq wasn't win
ning anything. Iraq is winning
because they are playing with
conventional weapons. In a
conventional war you don't
have to immediately and totally
incapacitate the opposition.
Iraq can live with the fact that
Baghdad and some of its major
oil refineries have been hit.
They are confident that they
can survive a limited retaliation
and eventually force Iran to
succumb to their demands.
In a nuclear war between the

United States and Russia, how
ever, the idea of withstanding
limited retaliation is ridiculous.
Limited retaliation in a nuclear
war does not mean limited
damage.
If the Soviets launched a
sneak attack, the U.S. sup
posedly has the ability to sight
their missiles and launch our
own from land, sea and air be
fore they hit. If, although it is un
likely, we were able to launch
all of our missiles, both sides
would be wiped out. This is
supposedly the ability that the
presidential candidates want
the U.S. to have.
Suppose, however, the
Soviets are able to hit every re
taliatory weapon we have be
fore they are launched (while
you're at it you can also sup
pose that Cal is going to the
Rose Bowl this year). The Soviet
Union could not possibly stop
every missile, every B-52, and
every submarine. We are
bound to get a few off.
In a nuclear war stopping
most of them is not an alter
native if you plan on coming out
with anything worthwhile. Just
one MIRVed missile has the
ability to wipe out four or five
targets. The U.S. has over 1500
land based missiles. If only
one-tenth of them are MIRVed
that means over 2 200

warheads have a conceivable
chance of hitting Russia. This
does not include the U.S.
submarine missilecapabilityor
the air-based attack from the
B-52's.
Are the Soviets willing to
allow 30 to 40 warheads to land
on their motherland? Are they
willing to practically concede
Moscow, Leningrad and other
cities to nuclear destruction?
Would you be willing to give
up Washington D.C., San
Francisco, Los Angeles and
New York (well, maybe New
York) to annihilate Russia? I
don't think even Zbigniew
Brzezinski would be happy
winning that kind of war.
It seems to me that the only
reason the Soviets would
launch a first strike is if they
believed the U.S. was going to
launch one first. Building the
MX will not do much to al
leviate their fears. Escalating
the arms race is not an answer,
only an addition to the prob
lem. A nuclear war between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is like
a baseball game that must be a
shutout or both teams lose.
The U.S. already has some
heavy hitters. We don't need
any more.

conventional weapons. In a
conventional war you don't
have to immediately and totally
incapacitate the opposition.
Iraq can live with the fact that
Baghdad and some of its major
oil refineries have been hit.
They are confident that they
can survive a limited retaliation
and eventually force Iran to
succumb to their demands.
In a nuclear war between the

United States and Russia, how
ever, the idea of withstanding
limited retaliation is ridiculous.
Limited retaliation in a nuclear
war does not mean limited
damage.
If the Soviets launched a
sneak attack, the U.S. sup
posedly has the ability to sight
their missiles and launch our
own from land, sea and air be
fore they hit. If, although it is un
likely, we were able to launch
all of our missiles, both sides
would be wiped out. This is
supposedly the ability that the
presidential candidates want
the U.S. to have.
Suppose, however, the
Soviets are able to hit every re
taliatory weapon we have be
fore they are launched (while
you're at it you can also sup
pose that Cal is going to the
Rose Bowl this year). The Soviet
Union could not possibly stop
every missile, every B-52, and
every submarine. We are
bound to get a few off.
In a nuclear war stopping
most of them is not an alter
native if you plan on coming out
with anything worthwhile. Just
one MIRVed missile has the
ability to wipe out four or five
targets. The U.S. has over 1500
land based missiles. If only
one-tenth of them are MIRVed
that means over 2 200

warheads have a conceivable
chance of hitting Russia. This
does not include the U.S.
submarine missilecapabilityor
the air-based attack from the
B-52's.
Are the Soviets willing to
allow 30 to 40 warheads to land
on their motherland? Are they
willing to practically concede
Moscow, Leningrad and other
cities to nuclear destruction?
Would you be willing to give
up Washington D.C., San
Francisco, Los Angeles and
New York (well, maybe New
York) to annihilate Russia? I
don't think even Zbigniew
Brzezinski would be happy
winning that kind of war.
It seems to me that the only
reason the Soviets would
launch a first strike is if they
believed the U.S. was going to
launch one first. Building the
MX will not do much to al
leviate their fears. Escalating
the arms race is not an answer,
only an addition to the prob
lem. A nuclear war between
the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. is like
a baseball game that must be a
shutout or both teams lose.
The U.S. already has some
heavy hitters. We don't need
any more.

One of the big issues of the
1980 election is national de
fense. Both major presidential
candidates advocate building
up our nuclear arsenal (i.e. MX
missile system) to deter the
Soviet threat. It's simply a mat
ter of safety through strength.
Right?
Look at WW 11. If Europe had
built up its armed forces, Ger
many wouldn't have dared to
touch it. The same goes for Iran
today. Iran showed a little
weakness and Iraq moved right
in. They say the same thing
could happen to the U.S if we
don't build up our strength.
The Soviet Union could possi
bly beat us in a war. Right?
If just one of those bombs
being dropped on Baghdad
were nuclear, instead of con
ventional, you could say with
certainty that Iraq wasn't win
ning anything. Iraq is winning
because they are playing with
conventional weapons. In a
conventional war you don't
have to immediately and totally
incapacitate the opposition.
