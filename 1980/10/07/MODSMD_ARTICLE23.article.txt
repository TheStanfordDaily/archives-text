### Los Angeles Times 
Just a few nights before al
legedly attempting a "copy
cat" strangling in Bellingham,
Washington, Veronica Com
pton was trying to convince
Gov. Jerry Brown to help con
fessed Hillside Strangler Ken
neth Bianchi.
The encounter between the
24-year-old actress
screenwriter and Brown occur
red at a restaurant in L.A.
Brown and Compton had
gone separately to the restaur
ant — Lucy's El Adobe cafe —
from a September political
fund raising event at which
Compton's father, Armando
Compero, was one of the
hosts.
Compero is an artist and also
the political cartoonist for La
Opinion, a Los Angeles
Spanish-language newspaper.
Compton, in an exclusive in
terview, said Sunday she told
Brown that she had evidence
that Bianchi was not involved
with his cousin, Angelo Buono,
in the 10 Hillside Stranger slay
ings — despite Bianchi's con
fessions to those crimes.
Earlier, in discussions with
British journalist Mike
Housego, Compton claimed
that Bianchi could not have
taken part in the murders be
cause he was "in bed with her"

on every night that each victim
was killed in the string of stran
gulations stretching from Oc
tober 1977 to February 1978.
During the Sunday interview
at a Los Angeles County wo
men's prison, she said of her
meeting with Brown: "He said
I should really be talking to the
homicide department or the
D.A.'s office to discuss it, but
he said I could call him at his
office. I didn't do that, in fact."
Brown could not im
mediately be reached for
comment. But Frank Casado,
who operates the restaurant
with his wife, Lucy, recalled
Compton.
"I remember her well be
cause she was dressed in all
white and had this low-cut
dress," Casado said. "Some
one took her over to the side
where the governor was sitting
but I don't know how long she
might talked to him."
Compton maintained that
she first met Bianchi in 1977
and that they became engaged
2Vi months ago during one of
her several visits to him at the
Los Angeles County Jail.
Roger Kelly, a Los Angeles
County deputy district attor
ney who was the prosecutor in
the Strangler case, disputed
Compton's claim about meet
ing Bianchi three years ago,
saying: "There is evidence she

did not even introduce herself
to Bianchi until January of this
year via mail and that she did
not actually meet him until
going to the jail in July."
But Compton countered that
this would appear to be so be
cause she "coded" her letters
and diary to disguise their prior
relationship.
