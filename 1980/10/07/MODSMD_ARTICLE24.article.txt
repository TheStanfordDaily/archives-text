# Downturn in economy predicted
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
It sounds like standard fare at an ice
cream shop. But when economists men
tion the words "double dip," they usually
have something very different in mind.
Just as the economy appears to be re
bounding from last spring's recession, the
experts are growing increasingly worried
that rising interest rates could send the
economy plunging again. Thus there is the
possibility of a double dip recession — a
sharp downturn followed by a brief re
bound, and then another precipitous
drop.
Economists have reached nothing close
to a consensus on whether another slump
is imminent. Many still contend that in
terest rates could rise another percentage
point or two without inflicting serious
damage. Even so, more economists in and
out of government now consider a new
downturn a serious possibility.
"I'd say there is about 40 percent chance
we will see the double dip in November
and December," said Robert Weintraub, a
monetary economist with the House Bank
ing Committee.
"If we have a condition of interest rates
rising; it's difficult to envision a recovery in
any ongoing sense," warned Kathryn
Eichoff, executive vice president of
Townsend-Creenspan Inc., New York, a
leading economic consulting firm. "The
two areas we expected to be strong in the
fourth quarter were housing and autos,"
she added, "but now there is a serious
question about how strong these sectors
will be."
Estimates sharply revised
Indeed, many forecasters, who earlier
had predicted a strong economic showing
in the last months of 1980 now are revising
their estimates sharply downward.
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at

Bear Stearns & Co., a New York brokerage
house, is among the most pessimistic.
Short-term interest rates, he believes, will
continue to rise until year end, "resulting
in a serious recession in 1981 in which un
employment rises to about 9 percent from
its current 7.6 percent level."
Moreover, some economists argue that
inflationary expectations have become so
embedded in the economy that a reces
sive relapse probably will do little to mod
erate wage and price increases this year.
They say the economy has become so sen
sitive to even hints of change that we can
expect gyrations in interest rates and other
markets to continue.
At the moment, one thing seems cer
tain: the economy is at a crossroads, dis
playing evidence of both recovery and
continued stagnation. In August, the level
of industrial production rose for the first
time in six months, and the unemploy
ment rate declined from July's level.
Meanwhile, retail sales surged 1.5 percent
during August, and new housing starts
rose for the fourth consecutive month.
Economy strong
The economy has appeared so strong in
fact that the Department of Commerce's
chief economist, Courtenay Slater, de
clared recently that the downturn proba
bly ended in August.
Now, however, many economists be
lieve those positive developments may
have been temporary — set in motion after
the Carter administration lifted its credit
controls last summer and interest rates
began to tumble. Moreover, skeptics
point out that certain key economic indi
cators such as personal income and the
personal savings rate have-been weak all
along. They also note that companies con
tinue to build inventories — an omen of
possible future production cutbacks and

worker layoffs.
"The economy has caught its breath, but
I'm almost certain the improvements
won't continue," argued Robert Dedrick,
chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago. "A new downturn could be as
deep as last summer's," he said, "al
though I doubt that it would be any
worse."
The new outbreak of pessimism stems
mainly from a fear that rapidly rising in
terest rates will quash an expected recov
ery in the housing and auto markets and
also stifle corporate plans to borrow for
new investments. After falling nearly 10
percentage points during the late spring
and early summer, the prime rate on bank
loans, for example, has been rising for
seven straight weeks to a current level of
14 percent. Many analysts believe the
prime — which is the rate banks charge
their best corporate customers, and a
barometer for trends in most other in
terest rates — will continue to climb in the
weeks ahead.
Interest rates up
Most other interest rates have been
climbing as well. For example, rates on
three-month certificates of deposit have
jumped to nearly 13 percent from 8.5 per
cent in just three months. And, rates on
three-month U.S. Treasury bills have in
creased to 11.5 percent from below 7 per
cent last June. Home mortgage rates at
many savings and loan associations now
stand above 14 percent.
Economists are divided over who or
what deserves blame for resurging interest
rates. Some say the rise is simply due to
the economy's generally improved health
which has boosted business and con
sumer loan demand. A larger number
of experts point accusing fingers at the
Federal Reserve Board.
