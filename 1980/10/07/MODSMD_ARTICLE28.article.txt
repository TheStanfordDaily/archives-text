## Mose Allison's flinty grey blues 
### Leo Dawber 
Mose Allison, the blues
singer, composer and pianist,
performed last Thursday night
at Keystone Palo Alto. Al
though he looked gaunt and
unhealthy, he played two sets
with spirit and virtuosity, rush
ing from each song into the
next with barely a nod to the
applause.
Allison is unlike any other
blues singer. His voice is flat,
with a Southern accent, ex
pressive in phrasing and inten
sity, but lacking resonance or
range. Not gravelly, it is more
like fine sandpaper. The influ
ence of traditional blues on his
sound is unmistakable; one
might describe the result as a
blues shout talked.
And yet his voice is the per
fect vehicle for his own bit
tersweet lyrics and his in
terpretations of the standards.
Hearing his songs in quick suc
cession gives the sense of a
single narrator behind them:
accepting, resigned, amused,
cynical. He mocks his future —
"I don't worry 'bout a thing/
Because I know/ that nothing is

going to be all right" — and
fumes at an irksome lover,
"Your mind is on vacation/ But
your mouth is working over
time." Though the tempos
change, it's all sung in the same
deadpan tone. Allison's blues
aren't blue; they're flinty grey.
This narrator is sometimes
humorous and often moody,
but always with poignant ef
fect. Though he surely rejects
prettiness or sentimentality,
his lyrics invite a certain em
pathy. In one song he tells a
past love that he accepts her
having left him, that he ex
pected no better. Yet "Every
now and then I wonder/ Who's
loving you tonight."
Allison was accompanied by
Mel Graves on acoustic bass
and Lee Charleston on drums;
they formed a trio unique
among blues bands. Each set
opened with a lengthy instru
mental composition which al
ternated standard blues struc
ture with free-form improvisa

tion much closer to avant
garde jazz. Grave's excellent
tone and rhythmic sense mixed
beautifully with Allison's pas
sionate, rushing chords; he
also provided some fine solos.
Charleston played loudly, with
intensity and drive. He em
phasized the cymbals, drawing
on their tonal differences for
subtle effects.
They rendered the standards
in almost unrecognizable
form, but the alterations had
fascinating effects, accentuat
ing the contrast between tradi
tional jazz and individual ex
perimentation. Imagine "You
Are My Sunshine" played in a
minor key at the pace of a
dirge. By rearranging the
rhythm and emphasis of "Do
Nothing 'Til You Hear From
Me," Allison seemed to expose
the hypocrisy of the lyrics,
often hidden by a more mellif
luous singer.
It's a shame that few people
turned out tor this show. Mose
Allison's fans are a devoted

cadre, but it is clear that he can
appeal to a much broader au
dience. It is obvious, for exam
ple, that the early Randy New
man borrowed much of his
•>tyle from Allison and Newman
fans might find some pleasant
surprises in Allison's work.
The opening act on Thursday
was "The Ensemble," a fusion
R&B band with its roots in the
Average White Band, the
Brecker Brothers Band and
(occasionally) SpyroGyra. Al
though all the band members
were technically competent,
they were remarkably unin
spired. Too much percussion
and too little real improvisation
gave redundant, unexciting ef
fects.
The Keystone often mis
matches its lead and opening
acts at jazz and blue shows. A
local blues band or jazz combo
would make a much better in
troduction to someone like Al
lison. Or would Keystone pre
fer that its nine-to-eleven
crowd be sipping coffee at
nearby Printer's Inc.?
