# Elvis sinks Lowe on new album
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
Elvis Costello is just plain bitchin'.
Sorry if that's unprofessional and all that
bull, but I'll risk it. With the recent release
of Taking Liberties, we now have available
five (count 'em) albums from Elvis. If
you have any pretentions about having a
"cool" record collection, you'd better
own every one of them.
For a guy who's only been on the music
scene since 1977, Elvis' discography has
been an impressive one. His first release,
the unpretentious and simple My Aim Is
True, won him instant acclaim, vaulting
him into the forefront of the British New
Wave invasion. The second album, This
Year's Model, was equally successful and
hinted at the maturity that flowered in his
third effort, Armed Forces.
This last was hailed by critics and fans as
a unique achievement, for, unlike his pre
vious LPs, Elvis demonstrated deep social
and political concerns in his lyrics. Songs
such as "Two Little Hitlers," "Oliver's
Army," "Chemistry Class" and "What's So
Funny About Peace, Loveand Understand
ing" are classic examples of the social
criticism and moral revulsion of contem
porary society that has been a prerequisite
for credibility among rock purists since the
'60s.
Having made his political statement in
no uncertain terms, Elvis followed Armed
Forces with Get Happy, an unparalleled
landmark in rock album production.
Twenty songs, all vintage Elvis, grace the
album, proving that the man is not only
prolific, but believes in giving you more

than your money's worth. These days, in
tegrity has been almost a non-sequitur
among the hordes of greedy record com
pany and all-flash-no-substance,
pre-fab rock groups. The best of punk and
New Wave has been, in part, a rejection of
this. Get Happy has only been the most
vivid example.
All of which brings us (finally) to Taking
Liberties. And, surprise! Twenty more
songs on a single album. Most of them
have been previously released on the
other side of the Atlantic as the "B" sides
of various singles, EPs, etc. A few of them
have found their way onto the airwaves of
progressive FM stations such as our be
loved KZSU.
But for most people, Taking Liberties is
another unique excursion into the world
of Britain's answer to Neil Young.
The overriding features of this album are
twofold: first, it contains a majority of
songs produced by Elvis himself, instead
of Nick Lowe. Lowe's productive genius,
which deserves a great deal of credit for
Elvis' current stature, is clearly evident in
the more pop-oriented cuts on the album.
Now for the first time on an Elvis album; we
finally get a clear sense of Elvis himself,
without Lowe's "midas touch." The result
is a diverse compilation of hits with styles
ranging from the gentle "My Funny Valen
tine" produced by Elvis, to the more slick,
fine-tuned "Radio Sweetheart" which
bears Lowe's unmistakeable marks.
The other noticeable feature of Taking
Liberties is the way in which it showcases
Elvis' considerable versatility as a songwri

ter. With the exception of an excellent
cover of Van McCoy's "Getting Mighty
Crowded,'' all the songs on the album are
— as usual — written by Elvis. But whereas
past Elvis albums have tended to maintain
a certain internal consistency in songwrit
ing styles, this is clearly not the case on
Liberties. Styles range from the hard
driving rock tempo of "(I Don't Want To
Go To) Chelsea" to the melodious,
country-western feel of "Stranger In The
House" to the iron-hand-in-velvet-glove
approach of "Hoover Factory."
This diversity even cross-cuts the differ
ences imbued in the album by the dual
production of Lowe and Costello, in some
cases even clouding the distinction. Songs
such as "Crawling to the U.S.A." and
"Ghost Train," though produced by Elvis,
have a smoothness and polish reminiscent
of Lowe's productive hand.
But where songs such as the Rockpile
esque "Clean Money" bespeak the depth
of the Lowe-Costeilo marriage, there are
also moments that are purely Elvis. If you
thought "downtime Is Over" and "Black
And White World" on Get Happy weren't
slow or gutsy enough, then you'll proba
bly enjoy the versions on Liberties which
are free from Lowe's pop-oriented accel
eration.
On the whole, Taking Liberties is
another excellent, well-balanced album
which is likely to only intensify the debate
among Costello-philes as to which of the
five albums is the best.

driving rock tempo of "(I Don't Want To
Go To) Chelsea" to the melodious,
country-western feel of "Stranger In The
House" to the iron-hand-in-velvet-glove
approach of "Hoover Factory."
This diversity even cross-cuts the differ
ences imbued in the album by the dual
production of Lowe and Costello, in some
cases even clouding the distinction. Songs
such as "Crawling to the U.S.A." and
"Ghost Train," though produced by Elvis,
have a smoothness and polish reminiscent
of Lowe's productive hand.
But where songs such as the Rockpile
esque "Clean Money" bespeak the depth
of the Lowe-Costeilo marriage, there are
also moments that are purely Elvis. If you
thought "downtime Is Over" and "Black
And White World" on Get Happy weren't
slow or gutsy enough, then you'll proba
bly enjoy the versions on Liberties which
are free from Lowe's pop-oriented accel
eration.
On the whole, Taking Liberties is
another excellent, well-balanced album
which is likely to only intensify the debate
among Costello-philes as to which of the
five albums is the best.
Which do I like the best?
What side of the bed did I get up on this
morning?
Elvis Costello is just plain bitchin'.
Sorry if that's unprofessional and all that
bull, but I'll risk it. With the recent release
of Taking Liberties, we now have available
five (count 'em) albums from Elvis. If
you have any pretentions about having a
"cool" record collection, you'd better
own every one of them.
For a guy who's only been on the music
scene since 1977, Elvis' discography has
been an impressive one. His first release,
the unpretentious and simple My Aim Is
True, won him instant acclaim, vaulting
him into the forefront of the British New
Wave invasion. The second album, This
Year's Model, was equally successful and
hinted at the maturity that flowered in his
third effort, Armed Forces.
This last was hailed by critics and fans as
a unique achievement, for, unlike his pre
vious LPs, Elvis demonstrated deep social
and political concerns in his lyrics. Songs
such as "Two Little Hitlers," "Oliver's
Army," "Chemistry Class" and "What's So
Funny About Peace, Loveand Understand
ing" are classic examples of the social
criticism and moral revulsion of contem
porary society that has been a prerequisite
for credibility among rock purists since the
'60s.
Having made his political statement in
no uncertain terms, Elvis followed Armed
Forces with Get Happy, an unparalleled
landmark in rock album production.
Twenty songs, all vintage Elvis, grace the
album, proving that the man is not only
prolific, but believes in giving you more

than your money's worth. These days, in
tegrity has been almost a non-sequitur
among the hordes of greedy record com
pany and all-flash-no-substance,
pre-fab rock groups. The best of punk and
New Wave has been, in part, a rejection of
this. Get Happy has only been the most
vivid example.
All of which brings us (finally) to Taking
Liberties. And, surprise! Twenty more
songs on a single album. Most of them
have been previously released on the
other side of the Atlantic as the "B" sides
of various singles, EPs, etc. A few of them
have found their way onto the airwaves of
progressive FM stations such as our be
loved KZSU.
But for most people, Taking Liberties is
another unique excursion into the world
of Britain's answer to Neil Young.
The overriding features of this album are
twofold: first, it contains a majority of
songs produced by Elvis himself, instead
of Nick Lowe. Lowe's productive genius,
which deserves a great deal of credit for
Elvis' current stature, is clearly evident in
the more pop-oriented cuts on the album.
Now for the first time on an Elvis album; we
finally get a clear sense of Elvis himself,
without Lowe's "midas touch." The result
is a diverse compilation of hits with styles
ranging from the gentle "My Funny Valen
tine" produced by Elvis, to the more slick,
fine-tuned "Radio Sweetheart" which
bears Lowe's unmistakeable marks.
The other noticeable feature of Taking
Liberties is the way in which it showcases
Elvis' considerable versatility as a songwri

ter. With the exception of an excellent
cover of Van McCoy's "Getting Mighty
Crowded,'' all the songs on the album are
— as usual — written by Elvis. But whereas
past Elvis albums have tended to maintain
a certain internal consistency in songwrit
ing styles, this is clearly not the case on
Liberties. Styles range from the hard
driving rock tempo of "(I Don't Want To
Go To) Chelsea" to the melodious,
country-western feel of "Stranger In The
House" to the iron-hand-in-velvet-glove
approach of "Hoover Factory."
