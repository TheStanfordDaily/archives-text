# An Australian tragedy
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
The title of the new Australian film, The
Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, suggests both
its tragic tone and its connection to ritual; a
chant is a ballad and also a verse repeated in a
ceremony. Set in Australia at the turn of the
century, the film is the story of a young half
white, half-aborigine whose tragedy is his in
ability to fit in either world; his training; by a
sympathetic minister and his wife, has taught
him to reject tribal ritual as dumb supersti
tion and to seek honest employment, and a
wife, among the whites so that he can ad
vance himself. But Jimmie'sexperiences with
whites brutalize rather than refine him. He is
cheated by those who hire him to build their
fences; as a deputy cop, he is seduced into
betraying another black; he marries a pre
gnant white girl, Gilda, and the child she
gives birth to is not his, but that of a white
man; when he allows his half-brother and
uncle to live with him on a farm where he is
employed, his boss, feeling threatened, tries
to starve them out. In the film's emotional
climax — a bold, brilliantly sustained ope.atic
sequence — Jimmie's anger at these com
i pounded injustices erupts. He slaughters the
women and children in Newby's, his
employer's, home.
The director, Fred Schepisi, has adapted a
fine 1972 novel by Thomas Keneally that is
virtually unknown in this country. Keneally
writes in a style that is dense yet terse; the
book is practically poetry and the imagery is
so unusual that it has a hypnotic effect on the
reader. In the film, Schepisi uses a visual
shorthand that is the perfect equivalent of
Keneally's prose. The opening shots of jim
mie undergoing the traditional aboriginal
rites of passage are intercut with a conversa
tion between the minister, Mr. Neville, and
his wife in which they discuss the boy's po
tential for growth in white society. In a
few minutes the division in Jimmie, sym
bolized by his half-caste, is defined for us.

The bond between Jimmie and his half
brother Mort is expressed in a scene in which
they chop wood, their strokes alternating in
musical rhythm. The way in which Schepisi is
able to convey the emotional tone of a scene
just by the grouping of actors is reminiscent
of the Robert Altman of McCabe and Mrs.
Miller and Thieves Like Us, or of the great
Indian director Satyajit Ray. When the
women in Newby's house urge Cilda to take
her child and leave Jimmie, their fire-warmed
fleshiness seems overwhelming beside her
clumsy, emaciated form and we can sense
the power in them and understand why it is
these white women, and not the men, that
Jimmie is moved to destroy.
Schepisi is not coarse in his treatment of
the white characters in the movie. Except for
the cop, a drunken monster who sodomizes
his prisoners, the whites are not depicted as
stock villains. The bigotry of the Nevilles and
the Newbys is their heritage; Schepisi does
not appear to blame them for it and he is
compassionate enough to shoot a beautiful
sequence of the Newby men mourning their
women straight on, without undercutting
their loss in any way. No one in this picture is
denied his sorrow. Cilda is not guilty of
maliciously trapping Jimmie into marriage;
she is unimaginative and a bit silly, but she
shows affection for Jimmie, and Schepisi
gives her one scene — her first frightened
glimpse of the shack to which her new hus
band brings her to live — that wins our sym
pathy. Schepisi is aided by a nearly impecca
ble cast, headed by Tommy Lewis as Jimmie,
Angela Punch as Cilda and Freddy Reynolds,
who gives a glorious performance as Mou.
Like the mixed blood in him, Jimmie's life is
beyond his control; his explosion is inevita
ble, his cry of protest against his fate — futile
but noble, like Oedipus' scream as he tears
out his eyes. The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith
is a film of Sophoclean power — a master
piece.

Like the mixed blood in him, Jimmie's life is
beyond his control; his explosion is inevita
ble, his cry of protest against his fate — futile
but noble, like Oedipus' scream as he tears
out his eyes. The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith
is a film of Sophoclean power — a master
piece.
The title of the new Australian film, The
Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith, suggests both
its tragic tone and its connection to ritual; a
chant is a ballad and also a verse repeated in a
ceremony. Set in Australia at the turn of the
century, the film is the story of a young half
white, half-aborigine whose tragedy is his in
ability to fit in either world; his training; by a
sympathetic minister and his wife, has taught
him to reject tribal ritual as dumb supersti
tion and to seek honest employment, and a
wife, among the whites so that he can ad
vance himself. But Jimmie'sexperiences with
whites brutalize rather than refine him. He is
cheated by those who hire him to build their
fences; as a deputy cop, he is seduced into
betraying another black; he marries a pre
gnant white girl, Gilda, and the child she
gives birth to is not his, but that of a white
man; when he allows his half-brother and
uncle to live with him on a farm where he is
employed, his boss, feeling threatened, tries
to starve them out. In the film's emotional
climax — a bold, brilliantly sustained ope.atic
sequence — Jimmie's anger at these com
i pounded injustices erupts. He slaughters the
women and children in Newby's, his
employer's, home.
The director, Fred Schepisi, has adapted a
fine 1972 novel by Thomas Keneally that is
virtually unknown in this country. Keneally
writes in a style that is dense yet terse; the
book is practically poetry and the imagery is
so unusual that it has a hypnotic effect on the
reader. In the film, Schepisi uses a visual
shorthand that is the perfect equivalent of
Keneally's prose. The opening shots of jim
mie undergoing the traditional aboriginal
rites of passage are intercut with a conversa
tion between the minister, Mr. Neville, and
his wife in which they discuss the boy's po
tential for growth in white society. In a
few minutes the division in Jimmie, sym
bolized by his half-caste, is defined for us.

The bond between Jimmie and his half
brother Mort is expressed in a scene in which
they chop wood, their strokes alternating in
musical rhythm. The way in which Schepisi is
able to convey the emotional tone of a scene
just by the grouping of actors is reminiscent
of the Robert Altman of McCabe and Mrs.
Miller and Thieves Like Us, or of the great
Indian director Satyajit Ray. When the
women in Newby's house urge Cilda to take
her child and leave Jimmie, their fire-warmed
fleshiness seems overwhelming beside her
clumsy, emaciated form and we can sense
the power in them and understand why it is
these white women, and not the men, that
Jimmie is moved to destroy.
Schepisi is not coarse in his treatment of
the white characters in the movie. Except for
the cop, a drunken monster who sodomizes
his prisoners, the whites are not depicted as
stock villains. The bigotry of the Nevilles and
the Newbys is their heritage; Schepisi does
not appear to blame them for it and he is
compassionate enough to shoot a beautiful
sequence of the Newby men mourning their
women straight on, without undercutting
their loss in any way. No one in this picture is
denied his sorrow. Cilda is not guilty of
maliciously trapping Jimmie into marriage;
she is unimaginative and a bit silly, but she
shows affection for Jimmie, and Schepisi
gives her one scene — her first frightened
glimpse of the shack to which her new hus
band brings her to live — that wins our sym
pathy. Schepisi is aided by a nearly impecca
ble cast, headed by Tommy Lewis as Jimmie,
Angela Punch as Cilda and Freddy Reynolds,
who gives a glorious performance as Mou.

beyond his control; his explosion is inevita
ble, his cry of protest against his fate — futile
but noble, like Oedipus' scream as he tears
