# Forever After happily good
## 
### Stephen Nash 
Theater Rhinoceros has opened its 1980-81
season with Forever After by Doric Wilson. Doric
Wilson was one of the early participants in the
off-off-Broadway movement; his first play, And
Mow She Dances, opened at New York's Cafte
Cino in 1961 .His later plays have dealt with vari
ous aspects of Greenwich Village life, the most
famous of which are The West Street Gang and A
Perfect Relationship. These two plays rely on
stereotypical characters and abrupt reversals of
expectations for their effect. They are quite
witty, but sometimes cynical and facile.
In many ways, Forever After continues in this
same style. Certainly much of the humor is gen
erated by the recognition and mocking of
stereotypes. In this play, though, the
stereotypes are much more essential to the
structure of the play and they lead to a rather
novel style of character development. In that
sense, Forever After is more unified and signific
ant than Wilson's earlier plays.
The play begins with a 30-ish couple, David
and Tom (played by Curt Crider and Alan Her
man), finishing off their first anniversary celeb
ration in their West Village apartment. Both are
dressed in the current urban gay uniform —
plaid shirts, Levis, workboots, etc. The scene
compresses the familiar boy-gets-, loses-, gets
boy story by having David and Tom hint at past
arguments they have had. They soon call a truce,
though, and tell each other how wonderful they
are, embrace passionately, and live happily ever
after.
Sort of. At the front of the stage is an elabo
rately decorated proscenium. Seated in it, stage
left and right, are Thalia and Melpomene, the
muses of Comedy and Tragedy (played in drag
by Martin Xero and Duane Cropper). Through
out this scene, Comedy has been making cynical
asides about the inanity of the situation and the
dialogue, and urging Tom and David to hurry up
and get the happy ending over with. When fi
nally they say, "Forever after," she even directs
the light man to black out the stage. Tom and
David have been oblivious to these comments
— lovers drowning in their own affection.
At this point, Tragedy finally speaks up, order
ing the lights (including the house lights) turned
up. She is determined to give the play an un
happy, and hence "more realistic," ending.
Although Comedy's comments had given the
evening a surrealistic quality already, the tradi
tional theatrical illusions now really begin to
fracture as Wilson points out more and more
clearly how many points of view the audience
can have towards the people on stage.
Wilson first points out that we are not just
watching David and Tom on stage, but also ac
tors playing these roles. We are told details of
the "actors' " lives — Comedy is a second rate
night-club singer, Tom exploits the "casting
sling" of the author, and Tragedy does intermis
sion acts at a porno theater.

Wilson goes on to point out the distinction
between the roles of Tom and David within the
play and outside the play by having them com
ment on their actions during the opening scene
in the apartment.
Many plays and films (A// That jazz is a recent
example) have debunked stock expectations by
pointing out what is going on behind the
scenes. This doesn't seem to be Wilson's main
goal. He adds intrigue to the play by having the
audience have several points ot view simultane
ously. For example, Comedy and Tragedy con
tinue to have magical powers, even though we
have been told that they are not really muses.
And the audience still cares about Tom and
David's relationship even though we acknow
ledge that actors are just following a script. There
is a certain cosmic battle going on between the
two muses over the ultimate fate of this couple.
There does not seem to be any implied criti
cism ot the stereotypes in the play. This play in
tact relies on cliches and stereotypes tor much
ot its structure and humor. In this play, being a
"Christopher Street Clone" is comparable to
being "jealous." Characters are made more
realistic not by showing their many distinctive
personality traits, but more by showing the dif
ferent roles that they act out. In a sense, in a
traditional play the character is rotated in front
ot the audience in order to show off its many
facets, but in "Forever After" the audience is
forced to look at the character trom many diffe
rent points of view.
At the end of the play, after the audience has
been dragged in and out of perspectives more
times than it can remember, neither Comedy
nor Tragedy wins. Tom and David don't live
happily forever after, but neither do they break
up irrevocably and commit suicide. They end up
together, but acknowledging that their relation
ship is not perfect, needs work, and could break
up at any time. Somehow, acknowledging many
extreme points of view has given them a realistic
view of their relationship. As thev say to each
other at the end, "Fuck forever after." '
Doric Wilson is a very witty writer, and in
between "Forever after" and "Fuck forever af
ter" he exploits many of the roles and cliches
brought up in the play. There are jokes about
the audience, about gay actors pretending to be
straight, about gay life ("gay men can't form
lasting relationships") and about being butch
(Tom won't put coffee beans in his Sambuka, for
example). And of course, the play itself is an
extended joke about the theatre.
I should add that there is no need to have a
high-brow view on altered perspectives of
character development to appreciate this play.
Wilson's humor and ingenuity are easily enough
to keep it buoyant.

between the roles of Tom and David within the
play and outside the play by having them com
ment on their actions during the opening scene
in the apartment.
Many plays and films (A// That jazz is a recent
example) have debunked stock expectations by
pointing out what is going on behind the
scenes. This doesn't seem to be Wilson's main
goal. He adds intrigue to the play by having the
audience have several points ot view simultane
ously. For example, Comedy and Tragedy con
tinue to have magical powers, even though we
have been told that they are not really muses.
And the audience still cares about Tom and
David's relationship even though we acknow
ledge that actors are just following a script. There
is a certain cosmic battle going on between the
two muses over the ultimate fate of this couple.
There does not seem to be any implied criti
cism ot the stereotypes in the play. This play in
tact relies on cliches and stereotypes tor much
ot its structure and humor. In this play, being a
"Christopher Street Clone" is comparable to
being "jealous." Characters are made more
realistic not by showing their many distinctive
personality traits, but more by showing the dif
ferent roles that they act out. In a sense, in a
traditional play the character is rotated in front
ot the audience in order to show off its many
facets, but in "Forever After" the audience is
forced to look at the character trom many diffe
rent points of view.
At the end of the play, after the audience has
been dragged in and out of perspectives more
times than it can remember, neither Comedy
nor Tragedy wins. Tom and David don't live
happily forever after, but neither do they break
up irrevocably and commit suicide. They end up
together, but acknowledging that their relation
ship is not perfect, needs work, and could break
up at any time. Somehow, acknowledging many
extreme points of view has given them a realistic
view of their relationship. As thev say to each
other at the end, "Fuck forever after." '
Doric Wilson is a very witty writer, and in
between "Forever after" and "Fuck forever af
ter" he exploits many of the roles and cliches
brought up in the play. There are jokes about
the audience, about gay actors pretending to be
straight, about gay life ("gay men can't form
lasting relationships") and about being butch
(Tom won't put coffee beans in his Sambuka, for
example). And of course, the play itself is an
extended joke about the theatre.
I should add that there is no need to have a
high-brow view on altered perspectives of
character development to appreciate this play.
Wilson's humor and ingenuity are easily enough
to keep it buoyant.

Theater Rhinoceros has opened its 1980-81
season with Forever After by Doric Wilson. Doric
Wilson was one of the early participants in the
off-off-Broadway movement; his first play, And
Mow She Dances, opened at New York's Cafte
Cino in 1961 .His later plays have dealt with vari
ous aspects of Greenwich Village life, the most
famous of which are The West Street Gang and A
Perfect Relationship. These two plays rely on
stereotypical characters and abrupt reversals of
expectations for their effect. They are quite
witty, but sometimes cynical and facile.
In many ways, Forever After continues in this
same style. Certainly much of the humor is gen
erated by the recognition and mocking of
stereotypes. In this play, though, the
stereotypes are much more essential to the
structure of the play and they lead to a rather
novel style of character development. In that
sense, Forever After is more unified and signific
ant than Wilson's earlier plays.
The play begins with a 30-ish couple, David
and Tom (played by Curt Crider and Alan Her
man), finishing off their first anniversary celeb
ration in their West Village apartment. Both are
dressed in the current urban gay uniform —
plaid shirts, Levis, workboots, etc. The scene
compresses the familiar boy-gets-, loses-, gets
boy story by having David and Tom hint at past
arguments they have had. They soon call a truce,
though, and tell each other how wonderful they
are, embrace passionately, and live happily ever
after.
Sort of. At the front of the stage is an elabo
rately decorated proscenium. Seated in it, stage
left and right, are Thalia and Melpomene, the
muses of Comedy and Tragedy (played in drag
by Martin Xero and Duane Cropper). Through
out this scene, Comedy has been making cynical
asides about the inanity of the situation and the
dialogue, and urging Tom and David to hurry up
and get the happy ending over with. When fi
nally they say, "Forever after," she even directs
the light man to black out the stage. Tom and
David have been oblivious to these comments
— lovers drowning in their own affection.
At this point, Tragedy finally speaks up, order
ing the lights (including the house lights) turned
up. She is determined to give the play an un
happy, and hence "more realistic," ending.
Although Comedy's comments had given the
evening a surrealistic quality already, the tradi
tional theatrical illusions now really begin to
fracture as Wilson points out more and more
clearly how many points of view the audience
can have towards the people on stage.
Wilson first points out that we are not just
watching David and Tom on stage, but also ac
tors playing these roles. We are told details of
the "actors' " lives — Comedy is a second rate
night-club singer, Tom exploits the "casting
sling" of the author, and Tragedy does intermis
sion acts at a porno theater.
