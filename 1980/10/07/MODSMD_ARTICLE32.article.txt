# Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane bombs big

Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane is not
quite a guano. I guess I would give it a
guano plus. The psycho-drama, written
and directed by William Peter Blatty
from his book The Ninth Configura
tion, has interesting potentials for de
velopment.
It attempts human horror amid hilar
ity; or is it hilarity amid horror? I could
not quite tell. Needless to say, I think
the movie falls far short of either. It
leaves the plot loosely tied and makes
only a superficially done attempt at study
ing the minds of the mentally sick.
The scene is set in an old medieval
looking castle where it always seems to
be a dark and rainy night (a good setting
for the horror part of the plot). Colonel
Kane, Stacy Keach, is an ex-Vietnam
psychotic war killer posing as a
psychiatrist in a mental health hospital
for U.S. servicemen.
The various inmates, who seem to be
let loose to do as they please, include a
man directingan all canine cast of Ham
let, a man who likes to dress like
Superman, and another man who is
convinced that he is a nun and tries to
pray drinks out of a soft drink machine
(these bring in the humor part of the

story).
While some of the antics of the in
mates are laughably funny, the
dialogues get tedious through their ab
surdity and the unreality of their oc
currences. It is easy to question who is
actually in control, the doctors or the
inmates.
The leading inmate, Captain Cutshaw
(Scott Wilson) is a famous astronaut
with grave doubts about the existence
of Cod and the goodness of man. His
quest for the divine truth leads him to
believe that the moon is made of
roquefort and to believe that all men
are evil.
The crux of the movie is Capt. Cut
shaw's search, and his relations with
Col. Kane who tries to help him and
show him that goodness does still exist
in the world, an intriguing dilemma for
a mass killer.
Both men struggle with these ques
tions and there are many scenes of
flashbacks of their lives and their
dreams. At this point melodrama was
having a heyday. There were many
quietly shed tears out rainy windows.
Unfortunately none of the crying actors
were capable of making me feel their

"deep" emotions.
Despite all the heavv conversations,
where would a movie be without vio
lence. This subject is, of course, fully
covered in a very bloody barroom
brawl.
The idea of exploring the minds of
mentally sick servicemen, many of
whom had been in Vietnam, could have
led to both a moving and a fascinating
movie. But the acting overall seemed
plastic and the story line superficial. I
had real problems believing the plot,
especially as the whole story unfolded.
The humor that I suppose was set to
lighten up the story, seemed isolatedly
funny, but on the whole served only to
confuse the audience. Not just a few
viewers got up and walked out in the
middle.
The end is kind of a deus ex machina
where Capt. Cutshaw finds out God
exists and that men can be good, willing
to sacrifice themselves for others.
In case you are still planning to see
the movie, I will not spoil the end.
Twinkle, Twinkle Killer Kane is playing
at the Old Mill. I would recommend
the twilight show; it is cheaper.
