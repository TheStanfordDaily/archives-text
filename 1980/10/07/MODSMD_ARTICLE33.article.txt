# Can't teach an old comic new schticks
## 
### Mike Wilkins 
Mort Sahl's autobiography is
sold at Skagg's Drug Store in
Boulder Colorado for $1.98.
Mort Sahl appears at Enrico
Banducci's The Entertainers
nightclub for eight dollars a
ticket. Ten dollars for a book
and a show isn't bad, but that
doesn't figure in the cost of gas
to Boulder. Come to think of it,
it was worth the money to see a
living legend perform. But in
many ways it was like paying to
see Muhammad Ali get the shit
beat out of him. Or following
Arnold Palmer around waiting
for his fading health to
penalize him a final stroke.
Mort Sahl is still funny, but he
is no longer the champ, and
hasn't really been a contender
for 15 years.
He relies heavily on ring
sawy and reputation; he still
wears sweaters and holds a
newspaper, and he still quotes
from Adlai Stevenson . . . the
dead one.
To be fair, a lot of his material
deals with current events,
political happenings that Sahl

feels are largely ignored by the
"young comic." But although
the events are current, his out
look is not. Which is nothing to
be ashamed of, and it added to
the charm of the evening.
The club itself is nice
enough, sedate, much like
Sahl, much like the audience.
Sedate, mature humor for se
date mature people. No grop
ing for the big laugh with an
arrow through the head, no
funny voices, no outlandish
props. Just a paunchy guy in a
sweater, a guy who looks more
and more like Morey Amster
dam, telling stories about guys
he knew who used to be alive,
about how screwed politics are
. . . complain, complain, com
plain. For Chrissakes Mort,
hurry up and retire already.
Then I can take the eight dol
lars I would normally spend on
you (because you're entertain
ing, you big galoot) and go ac
ross the street to the hungry i,
where it started 20-odd years
ago, and pay to see two disgust
ing people have intimate sex
ual relations.
