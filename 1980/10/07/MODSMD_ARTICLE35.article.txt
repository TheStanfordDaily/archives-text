# Beating a Dead horse

### Charles Buckley 
Though a Grateful Dead
show in the Bay Area is about as
common as fog hanging over
the Golden Gate Bridge, the
current set of Dead shows at
the Warfield Theatre have
taken on a special meaning.
The Warfield seats no more
than 2000 people, and it is not
often that Grateful Dead fans
get to see the band in such an
intimate atmosphere. Add to
this the fact that it is the band's
15th anniversary, and it be
comes clear that it was neces
sary to raffle the tickets, de
spite the fact that there are
three weeks' worth of perfor
mances.
Though the Dead generally
do two sets, both electric, they
have surprised and delighted
the Warfield crowds by open
ing each show acoustically,
something which they have not
done since the early seventies,
and then following with the
two electric.
It was a little past two in the
morning when the Grateful
Dead ended last Saturday
night's show, the eighth in the
series of fifteen. The show had
begun five and a half hours ear
lier, with Jerry Garcia singing
"Debellum Blues," a song
from the far gone past which
drew blank stares from many of
the recently converted teenage
Dead-Heads (some of whom
appeared to be younger than
the groups's 15 years), but eli
cited pleasant howls from
those Dead-Heads from way
back when. The rest of the
acoustic set consisted mostly
of older material as well, such
as the songs "Dark Hollow"
and "Ripple." By the time the
set had ended, one could only
regret the fact that the group
has spent the last few years

playing strictly electric.
The dearth of new material in
the first set was quickly made
up for when the band began
the second set with "Alabama
Getaway," a song from their
most recent album, Go to
Heaven. By the time the group
finished the set with "Weather
Report Suite" leading into
"The Deal," it was near mid
night, and the Dead had per
formed what to most bands
would be considered a full
evening of music.
What was to follow, how
ever, was one of those magical
closing sets in which the Dead
played straight through for
about 90 minutes without ever
really stopping between songs.
Opening with "Feel Like a
Stranger," another song from
the new album, the group be
came highly improvisational,
going on to play such songs as
"Franklin's Tower," "Esti
mated Prophet," and "Eyes of
the World." It was not more
than 10 minutes into the set
that the Dead had the Warfield
audience under a spell, the
combination of Garcia's leads
and Phil Lesh's bass lines com
ing through amazingly clear
due to a very fine mix at the
soundboard. By the time the
set ended with Bob Weir
screaming Chuck Berry's
"Johnny B. Goode," the aisles

which the ushers has been try
ing to keep clear throughout
the night had become oc
cupied with dancing bodies,
and the crowd of 2000 sounded
more like a crowd of 20,000.
The Grateful Dead having
given what they had given, it
was almost unjust for the audi
ence to demand more, but be
fore long the group was on
stage again, encoring with two
old classics, "Uncle lohn's
Band" and "One More Satur
day Night."
As the houselights went on
and another Saturday night
with the Grateful Dead came to
an end, it was clear recent ac
cusations about the group be
coming lazy and apathetic have
obviously been coming from
the mouths of people who only
listen to Dead records without
seeing the group's concerts.
Rather than doing three weeks'
worth at a small theatre, the
group could well have chosen
to celebrate their fifteenth an
niversary by doing one big
outdoor show, a move which
certainly would have been a lot
easier on the band members as
well as a great deal more lucra
tive. The Grateful Dead still
enjoy playing music and they
still give a damn about the
music they play; as long as they
continue to do so, they'll
surely be around foranotherls.

the first set was quickly made
up for when the band began
the second set with "Alabama
Getaway," a song from their
most recent album, Go to
Heaven. By the time the group
finished the set with "Weather
Report Suite" leading into
"The Deal," it was near mid
night, and the Dead had per
formed what to most bands
would be considered a full
evening of music.
What was to follow, how
ever, was one of those magical
closing sets in which the Dead
played straight through for
about 90 minutes without ever
really stopping between songs.
Opening with "Feel Like a
Stranger," another song from
the new album, the group be
came highly improvisational,
going on to play such songs as
"Franklin's Tower," "Esti
mated Prophet," and "Eyes of
the World." It was not more
than 10 minutes into the set
that the Dead had the Warfield
audience under a spell, the
combination of Garcia's leads
and Phil Lesh's bass lines com
ing through amazingly clear
due to a very fine mix at the
soundboard. By the time the
set ended with Bob Weir
screaming Chuck Berry's
"Johnny B. Goode," the aisles

which the ushers has been try
ing to keep clear throughout
the night had become oc
cupied with dancing bodies,
and the crowd of 2000 sounded
more like a crowd of 20,000.
The Grateful Dead having
given what they had given, it
was almost unjust for the audi
ence to demand more, but be
fore long the group was on
stage again, encoring with two
old classics, "Uncle lohn's
Band" and "One More Satur
day Night."
As the houselights went on
and another Saturday night
with the Grateful Dead came to
an end, it was clear recent ac
cusations about the group be
coming lazy and apathetic have
obviously been coming from
the mouths of people who only
listen to Dead records without
seeing the group's concerts.
Rather than doing three weeks'
worth at a small theatre, the
group could well have chosen
to celebrate their fifteenth an
niversary by doing one big
outdoor show, a move which
certainly would have been a lot
easier on the band members as
well as a great deal more lucra
tive. The Grateful Dead still
enjoy playing music and they
still give a damn about the
music they play; as long as they
continue to do so, they'll
surely be around foranotherls.


The Grateful Dead: still around
Though a Grateful Dead
show in the Bay Area is about as
common as fog hanging over
the Golden Gate Bridge, the
current set of Dead shows at
the Warfield Theatre have
taken on a special meaning.
The Warfield seats no more
than 2000 people, and it is not
often that Grateful Dead fans
get to see the band in such an
intimate atmosphere. Add to
this the fact that it is the band's
15th anniversary, and it be
comes clear that it was neces
sary to raffle the tickets, de
spite the fact that there are
three weeks' worth of perfor
mances.
Though the Dead generally
do two sets, both electric, they
have surprised and delighted
the Warfield crowds by open
ing each show acoustically,
something which they have not
done since the early seventies,
and then following with the
two electric.
It was a little past two in the
morning when the Grateful
Dead ended last Saturday
night's show, the eighth in the
series of fifteen. The show had
begun five and a half hours ear
lier, with Jerry Garcia singing
"Debellum Blues," a song
from the far gone past which
drew blank stares from many of
the recently converted teenage
Dead-Heads (some of whom
appeared to be younger than
the groups's 15 years), but eli
cited pleasant howls from
those Dead-Heads from way
back when. The rest of the
acoustic set consisted mostly
of older material as well, such
as the songs "Dark Hollow"
and "Ripple." By the time the
set had ended, one could only
regret the fact that the group
has spent the last few years

playing strictly electric.
The dearth of new material in
the first set was quickly made
up for when the band began
the second set with "Alabama
Getaway," a song from their
most recent album, Go to
Heaven. By the time the group
finished the set with "Weather
