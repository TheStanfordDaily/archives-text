Soviet gunmen cross Chinese border
Beijing — Four armed Soviet intruders crossed into Chinese
Mongolia, killed a herdsman and then began a firelight with
Chinese border guards in which one of the Soviets was killed,
the Chinese Foreign Ministry said yesterday. It was the tirst
China-Soviet border incident reported in more than a year.
China lodged a "strong protest" with the Soviet Union over
Sunday's incident, which Beijing said began when the intruders
crossed the Argun River into Inner Mongolia and tried to ab
duct a Chinese herdsman. The herdsman, identitied as Li
Zhong, resisted and was killed and the Soviets opened tire on
Chinese frontier guards who had rushed to the scene, the
protest note said.
It said the Chinese tired back in self-defense, killing one
Soviet intruder inside China, and the three others escaped in
their motorboat back to Soviet territory.
The Chinese protest, delivered to interim Soviet Charge d'At
faires G.V. Kireev, declared, "In disregard of the repeated
warnings of the Chinese side, the Soviet authorities now have
created another incident of bloodshed along the Sino-Soviet
border, killing a Chinese and encroaching on China's territorial
sovereignty.
"It must be pointed out that the Soviet side is doomed to
failure in its attempt to profit from creating border tension and
that it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences
arising therefrom," the note continued.
It demanded that Moscow "punish the culprits of this inci
dent and stop all armed provocations along the Sino-Soviet
border."
The last reported border incident between the communist
giants came in July 1979, when Beijing alleged that Soviet sol
diers killed one Chinese and wounded another in a cross
border ambush along the Sinkiang Province frontier.
That came as the two sides were preparing to begin talks on
improving relations strained during the last two decades amid
Chinese charges of Soviet "imperialism."
Syria, U.S.S.R. to sign security treaty
Paris — Syria is expected to sign a security treaty with the
Soviet Union this week that Moscow has been trying to press on
the Syrian government for nearly a decade, according to au
thoritative diplomatic sources here.
Syrian President Hafez Assad is scheduled to start a visit to
Moscow tomorrow, and the treaty is set for signature during
the visit, the sources said.
This symbolically important breakthrough in Syria's relations
with the Soviet Union comes at a delicate moment for the
Kremlin as it attempts to balance its conflicting interests in
warring Iran and Iraq, Syria's immediate neighbor and arch
rival in the Arab world.
Syria, which traditionally has had good relations with Iran in
part because they had common interests against Iraq, is the
Arab country that has remained thefriendliest to Tehran during
the war at the head of the Persian Gulf. From the Soviet view
point, a treaty with the Syrians also may serve as a reminder to
Iraq not to forget who its friends have been.
Iraq already has a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union
under which the Iraqis have received the bulk of their arsenal.
"Instead of being called a friendly treaty, our treaty with Iraq
should maybe just be called a technical assistance treaty," said
one Russian, who noted that the Iraqi government only follows
those clauses that are in Baghdad's interest. The Soviet source

noted the Iraqis have been making great efforts to diversify
their relationships, not only by turning to France, but also to
Italy, Yugoslavia, West Germany and others.
Despite the extreme delicacy of the Soviet attempt to be
allied with Iraq and Syria, attentive Western observers do not
think that the Soviets will wind up having to choose between
the two countries.
Svria and Iraq have an interest in preserving their links with
the Soviets and, because ot Washington's pro-Israel policy,
neither is in a position to turn to the United States as its alterna
tive superpower patron.
Polish communists purge party leaders
Warsaw, Poland — The Central Committee of the Polish
Communist Party purged eight top officials yesterday and ag
reed to ration meat in the months ahead, but took a go-slow
attitude toward other proposed reforms.
At the close of a session that lasted more than 21 hours and
ended near dawn, the party leaders approved plans proposed
by the Politburo and the new party first secretary, Stanislaw
Kania.
They purged six members accused of mismanaging the
economy over the last decade and two leaders charged with
financial and moral corruption.
And they confirmed that to complete the process of over
hauling the national leadership and regaining public confi
dence — after three months of unprecedented labor unrest —
thev would have to call a special party congress, less than a year
after the last one.
Defending the committee's action against complaints that
the party was moving too slowly to reform the country's
economic and political management, Jozef Klasa, the party s
new propaganda chief, said:
This is the beginning of a process. The party has to first put
its own house in order. The discussions this weekend concern
mostly internal matters."
Although the two days of meetings were private, published
speeches indicated that much of the long debate was devoted
to criticism of the regime of former party leader Edward Gierek,
who suffered a heart attack and was removed from office on
Sept. 5.
Some of the incumbent members argued against carrying out
the full, historic agreement reached with strikers on Aug. 31. It
granted them, among other things, the right to form unions
free of party control, a right uncommon in the rest of Eastern
Europe.
Kania won approval to implement the deal with the workers,
but the committee agreed only to study many of the other
reform proposals.
Supreme Court allows pro-ERA boycotts
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday allowed a
feminist-inspired boycott to continue against those states that
have not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.
The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Mis
souri officials that the National Organization for Women viol
ated federal antitrust laws by encouraging other groups to
withhold business from non-ratifying states.
"We feel vindicated," NOW President Ellie Smeal said from
her organization's national convention in San Antonio, Texas.
"The courts now to the highest level have said . . . the ERA
boycott is a form of political expression and that we are totally

justified.
Beginning their 1980-81 term by issuing orders in over 900
cases — possibly the busiest day in the court's 190-year history
r the justices also took these actions:
— Lett intact a ruling that allows a county-run health center in
Lansing, Mich., to distribute contraceptives to teenagers with
out notifying parents.
— Agreed to decide if a new federal standard for worker
exposure to cotton dust should be struck down as economi
cally unreasonable.
— Said they will study the Carter administration's attempt to
revoke former CIA agent Philip Agee's passport. Agee, who
lives in West Germany, has written two books critical of the spy
agency.
— Left intact a Florida Supreme Court ruling outlawing the
religious use of marijuana. The justices refused to hear argu
ments by the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church that smoking the
drug at services at a Miami Beach home was constitutionally
protected.
— Cleared the way for the prosecution of a Jewish Defense
League leader who offered a $500 reward to anyone killing or
seriously injuring an American Nazi Party member. Irving David
Rubin must stand trial in California on charges of soliciting
another to commit murder.
Court to hear Calif, appeal on canal permit
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to hear
California's appeal of court rulings requiring federal approval
for the proposed Peripheral Canal and another state water
facility.
The decision was a setback for the Sierra Club and other
environmental groups, which want to give the federal govern
ment a voice in the operation of much of the State Water
Project.
Fifteen Western states had joined California in asking the
high court to review two decisions by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals last year that had the potential for substantially
expanding the federal role in state water planning.
The appeals court ruled that the state needed a permit from
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build the Peripheral Canal
and conduct certain operations at a major pumping plant near
Tracy.
The pumping plant, which lifts water from the Clifton Court
Forebay into the first section of the California Aqueduct, is the
hub of the State Water Project, which ships Northern California
water to vast areas in thecentral and southern parts of the state.
The Sierra Club said an 1899 law required federal approval for
any pumping of water out of navigable waterways, such as the
Sacramento-San loaquin Delta.
State Water Resources Department spokesman Dean
Thompson said the first ruling in the case, by a federal district
court, might have shut the pumping plant down without a
federal permit, which could take months or even years to get.

New York — The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
15.02 to 965.70 for its largest one-day gain in more than two

Court to hear Calif, appeal on canal permit
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to hear
California's appeal of court rulings requiring federal approval
for the proposed Peripheral Canal and another state water
facility.
The decision was a setback for the Sierra Club and other
environmental groups, which want to give the federal govern
ment a voice in the operation of much of the State Water
Project.
Fifteen Western states had joined California in asking the
high court to review two decisions by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals last year that had the potential for substantially
expanding the federal role in state water planning.
The appeals court ruled that the state needed a permit from
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build the Peripheral Canal
and conduct certain operations at a major pumping plant near
Tracy.
The pumping plant, which lifts water from the Clifton Court
Forebay into the first section of the California Aqueduct, is the
hub of the State Water Project, which ships Northern California
water to vast areas in thecentral and southern parts of the state.
The Sierra Club said an 1899 law required federal approval for
any pumping of water out of navigable waterways, such as the
Sacramento-San loaquin Delta.
State Water Resources Department spokesman Dean
Thompson said the first ruling in the case, by a federal district
court, might have shut the pumping plant down without a
federal permit, which could take months or even years to get.

Soviet gunmen cross Chinese border
Beijing — Four armed Soviet intruders crossed into Chinese
Mongolia, killed a herdsman and then began a firelight with
Chinese border guards in which one of the Soviets was killed,
the Chinese Foreign Ministry said yesterday. It was the tirst
China-Soviet border incident reported in more than a year.
China lodged a "strong protest" with the Soviet Union over
Sunday's incident, which Beijing said began when the intruders
crossed the Argun River into Inner Mongolia and tried to ab
duct a Chinese herdsman. The herdsman, identitied as Li
Zhong, resisted and was killed and the Soviets opened tire on
Chinese frontier guards who had rushed to the scene, the
protest note said.
It said the Chinese tired back in self-defense, killing one
Soviet intruder inside China, and the three others escaped in
their motorboat back to Soviet territory.
The Chinese protest, delivered to interim Soviet Charge d'At
faires G.V. Kireev, declared, "In disregard of the repeated
warnings of the Chinese side, the Soviet authorities now have
created another incident of bloodshed along the Sino-Soviet
border, killing a Chinese and encroaching on China's territorial
sovereignty.
"It must be pointed out that the Soviet side is doomed to
failure in its attempt to profit from creating border tension and
that it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences
arising therefrom," the note continued.
It demanded that Moscow "punish the culprits of this inci
dent and stop all armed provocations along the Sino-Soviet
border."
The last reported border incident between the communist
giants came in July 1979, when Beijing alleged that Soviet sol
diers killed one Chinese and wounded another in a cross
border ambush along the Sinkiang Province frontier.
That came as the two sides were preparing to begin talks on
improving relations strained during the last two decades amid
Chinese charges of Soviet "imperialism."
Syria, U.S.S.R. to sign security treaty
Paris — Syria is expected to sign a security treaty with the
Soviet Union this week that Moscow has been trying to press on
the Syrian government for nearly a decade, according to au
thoritative diplomatic sources here.
Syrian President Hafez Assad is scheduled to start a visit to
Moscow tomorrow, and the treaty is set for signature during
the visit, the sources said.
This symbolically important breakthrough in Syria's relations
with the Soviet Union comes at a delicate moment for the
Kremlin as it attempts to balance its conflicting interests in
warring Iran and Iraq, Syria's immediate neighbor and arch
rival in the Arab world.
Syria, which traditionally has had good relations with Iran in
part because they had common interests against Iraq, is the
Arab country that has remained thefriendliest to Tehran during
the war at the head of the Persian Gulf. From the Soviet view
point, a treaty with the Syrians also may serve as a reminder to
Iraq not to forget who its friends have been.
Iraq already has a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union
under which the Iraqis have received the bulk of their arsenal.
"Instead of being called a friendly treaty, our treaty with Iraq
should maybe just be called a technical assistance treaty," said
one Russian, who noted that the Iraqi government only follows
those clauses that are in Baghdad's interest. The Soviet source

noted the Iraqis have been making great efforts to diversify
their relationships, not only by turning to France, but also to
Italy, Yugoslavia, West Germany and others.
Despite the extreme delicacy of the Soviet attempt to be
allied with Iraq and Syria, attentive Western observers do not
think that the Soviets will wind up having to choose between
the two countries.
Svria and Iraq have an interest in preserving their links with
the Soviets and, because ot Washington's pro-Israel policy,
neither is in a position to turn to the United States as its alterna
tive superpower patron.
Polish communists purge party leaders
Warsaw, Poland — The Central Committee of the Polish
Communist Party purged eight top officials yesterday and ag
reed to ration meat in the months ahead, but took a go-slow
attitude toward other proposed reforms.
At the close of a session that lasted more than 21 hours and
ended near dawn, the party leaders approved plans proposed
by the Politburo and the new party first secretary, Stanislaw
Kania.
They purged six members accused of mismanaging the
economy over the last decade and two leaders charged with
financial and moral corruption.
And they confirmed that to complete the process of over
hauling the national leadership and regaining public confi
dence — after three months of unprecedented labor unrest —
thev would have to call a special party congress, less than a year
after the last one.
Defending the committee's action against complaints that
the party was moving too slowly to reform the country's
economic and political management, Jozef Klasa, the party s
new propaganda chief, said:
This is the beginning of a process. The party has to first put
its own house in order. The discussions this weekend concern
mostly internal matters."
Although the two days of meetings were private, published
speeches indicated that much of the long debate was devoted
to criticism of the regime of former party leader Edward Gierek,
who suffered a heart attack and was removed from office on
Sept. 5.
Some of the incumbent members argued against carrying out
the full, historic agreement reached with strikers on Aug. 31. It
granted them, among other things, the right to form unions
free of party control, a right uncommon in the rest of Eastern
Europe.
Kania won approval to implement the deal with the workers,
but the committee agreed only to study many of the other
reform proposals.

Polish communists purge party leaders
Warsaw, Poland — The Central Committee of the Polish
Communist Party purged eight top officials yesterday and ag
reed to ration meat in the months ahead, but took a go-slow
attitude toward other proposed reforms.
At the close of a session that lasted more than 21 hours and
ended near dawn, the party leaders approved plans proposed
by the Politburo and the new party first secretary, Stanislaw
Kania.
They purged six members accused of mismanaging the
economy over the last decade and two leaders charged with
financial and moral corruption.
And they confirmed that to complete the process of over
hauling the national leadership and regaining public confi
dence — after three months of unprecedented labor unrest —
thev would have to call a special party congress, less than a year
after the last one.
Defending the committee's action against complaints that
the party was moving too slowly to reform the country's
economic and political management, Jozef Klasa, the party s
new propaganda chief, said:
This is the beginning of a process. The party has to first put
its own house in order. The discussions this weekend concern
mostly internal matters."
Although the two days of meetings were private, published
speeches indicated that much of the long debate was devoted
to criticism of the regime of former party leader Edward Gierek,
who suffered a heart attack and was removed from office on
Sept. 5.
Some of the incumbent members argued against carrying out
the full, historic agreement reached with strikers on Aug. 31. It
granted them, among other things, the right to form unions
free of party control, a right uncommon in the rest of Eastern
Europe.
Kania won approval to implement the deal with the workers,
but the committee agreed only to study many of the other
reform proposals.
Supreme Court allows pro-ERA boycotts
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday allowed a
feminist-inspired boycott to continue against those states that
have not yet ratified the Equal Rights Amendment.
The court, without comment, rejected arguments by Mis

ated federal antitrust laws by encouraging other groups to
withhold business from non-ratifying states.
"We feel vindicated," NOW President Ellie Smeal said from
her organization's national convention in San Antonio, Texas.
"The courts now to the highest level have said . . . the ERA
boycott is a form of political expression and that we are totally

justified.

Court to hear Calif, appeal on canal permit
Washington — The Supreme Court agreed yesterday to hear
California's appeal of court rulings requiring federal approval
for the proposed Peripheral Canal and another state water
facility.
The decision was a setback for the Sierra Club and other
environmental groups, which want to give the federal govern
ment a voice in the operation of much of the State Water
Project.
Fifteen Western states had joined California in asking the
high court to review two decisions by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals last year that had the potential for substantially
expanding the federal role in state water planning.
The appeals court ruled that the state needed a permit from
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build the Peripheral Canal
and conduct certain operations at a major pumping plant near
Tracy.
The pumping plant, which lifts water from the Clifton Court
Forebay into the first section of the California Aqueduct, is the
hub of the State Water Project, which ships Northern California
water to vast areas in thecentral and southern parts of the state.
The Sierra Club said an 1899 law required federal approval for
any pumping of water out of navigable waterways, such as the
Sacramento-San loaquin Delta.
State Water Resources Department spokesman Dean
Thompson said the first ruling in the case, by a federal district
court, might have shut the pumping plant down without a
federal permit, which could take months or even years to get.

Soviet gunmen cross Chinese border
Beijing — Four armed Soviet intruders crossed into Chinese
Mongolia, killed a herdsman and then began a firelight with
Chinese border guards in which one of the Soviets was killed,
the Chinese Foreign Ministry said yesterday. It was the tirst
China-Soviet border incident reported in more than a year.
China lodged a "strong protest" with the Soviet Union over
Sunday's incident, which Beijing said began when the intruders
crossed the Argun River into Inner Mongolia and tried to ab
duct a Chinese herdsman. The herdsman, identitied as Li
Zhong, resisted and was killed and the Soviets opened tire on
Chinese frontier guards who had rushed to the scene, the
protest note said.
It said the Chinese tired back in self-defense, killing one
Soviet intruder inside China, and the three others escaped in
their motorboat back to Soviet territory.
The Chinese protest, delivered to interim Soviet Charge d'At
faires G.V. Kireev, declared, "In disregard of the repeated
warnings of the Chinese side, the Soviet authorities now have
created another incident of bloodshed along the Sino-Soviet
border, killing a Chinese and encroaching on China's territorial
sovereignty.
"It must be pointed out that the Soviet side is doomed to
failure in its attempt to profit from creating border tension and
that it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences
arising therefrom," the note continued.
It demanded that Moscow "punish the culprits of this inci
dent and stop all armed provocations along the Sino-Soviet
border."
The last reported border incident between the communist
giants came in July 1979, when Beijing alleged that Soviet sol
diers killed one Chinese and wounded another in a cross
border ambush along the Sinkiang Province frontier.
That came as the two sides were preparing to begin talks on
improving relations strained during the last two decades amid
Chinese charges of Soviet "imperialism."
Syria, U.S.S.R. to sign security treaty
Paris — Syria is expected to sign a security treaty with the
Soviet Union this week that Moscow has been trying to press on
the Syrian government for nearly a decade, according to au
thoritative diplomatic sources here.
Syrian President Hafez Assad is scheduled to start a visit to
Moscow tomorrow, and the treaty is set for signature during
the visit, the sources said.
This symbolically important breakthrough in Syria's relations
with the Soviet Union comes at a delicate moment for the
Kremlin as it attempts to balance its conflicting interests in
warring Iran and Iraq, Syria's immediate neighbor and arch
rival in the Arab world.
Syria, which traditionally has had good relations with Iran in
part because they had common interests against Iraq, is the
Arab country that has remained thefriendliest to Tehran during
the war at the head of the Persian Gulf. From the Soviet view
point, a treaty with the Syrians also may serve as a reminder to
Iraq not to forget who its friends have been.
Iraq already has a friendship treaty with the Soviet Union
under which the Iraqis have received the bulk of their arsenal.
"Instead of being called a friendly treaty, our treaty with Iraq
should maybe just be called a technical assistance treaty," said
one Russian, who noted that the Iraqi government only follows
those clauses that are in Baghdad's interest. The Soviet source

noted the Iraqis have been making great efforts to diversify
their relationships, not only by turning to France, but also to
Italy, Yugoslavia, West Germany and others.
Despite the extreme delicacy of the Soviet attempt to be
allied with Iraq and Syria, attentive Western observers do not
think that the Soviets will wind up having to choose between
the two countries.
Svria and Iraq have an interest in preserving their links with
the Soviets and, because ot Washington's pro-Israel policy,
neither is in a position to turn to the United States as its alterna
tive superpower patron.
