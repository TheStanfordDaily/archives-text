# Study finds 'too many A grades' here
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Too many Stanford under
graduates receive too many "A"
grades, according to the annual re
port of the Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement (C-AAA).
The report, accepted last week by
the Faculty Senate, stated 60 percent
of all grades given by teachers here
are either A's or B's.
However, the C-AAA also said
"grade inflation" since 196f5 has been
very slight.
The report recommends faculty
members award grades according to
their literal definition — that is, jn A
for exceptional work, a B for superior
performance and a C for satisfactory
work. This would reduce the high
number of A's given to students, the
report concludes.
Grades climbing
"There's been a perception that
grades have been climbing in recent
years," said Civil Engineering Prof,
james Gere, chairman of the C-AAA.

News analysis

Gere said the intent of the report
was to give the Faculty Senate some
figures on the percentages of diffe
rent grades awarded here. The
C-AAA did not intend to suggest
specific grading guidelines because
"there are so many different teach
ing situations," he said.
Using graphs, the report shows the
proportion of A's rising to 36 percent
in the School of Humanities and Sci
ences and falling to 31 percent in the
School of Engineering since 1968.
Gere said in his own classes he has
used similar grading policies and
habits for "the last 10 years.
"But I think it is safe to say that I

give more A's and B's than I did in the
'505," said Gere, who has taught at
Stanford since 1954.
He said in the 1950s an unofficial
grading "curve" was used by many
professors which forced them to be
more rigid, and added, "I think any
type of curve today would be most
unsatisfactory."
Detrimental
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman of
Law School admissions, Friday said
too many high grade point averages
can be detrimental to a school's
reputation. This in turn adversely af
fects a student's chance of getting
into law schools or other profes
sional schools, he said.

"Stanford has the highest grade
average of any major institution in
the United States," Friedenthal said.
Friedenthal said a 3.38 grade point
average is about average among
Stanford undergraduat.es. Those ap
plying to law school maintained a

3.79 grade point average. "This is
substantially higher than any other
school," he said.
Friedenthal said he wrote to the
C-AAA "to announce my discomfi
ture with Stanford's grading level
which hurts undergraduates."
Wider distribution
"If some poor guy happens to get
two C's because he didn't play the
game right, his average drops way
down," said Friedenthal, asserting a
more selective use of grades and a
wider distribution of scores would
alleviate the problem.
,"l wish to hell that we could have
some more leeway," Friedenthal
said. He would like to see averages

| drop "at least to around 3.20 for
those students taking the LSAT's."
That is about the average for students
from Harvard and Yale, he said.
Registrar Sally Mahoney pointed
out "one does not find many institu
tions using the same type of grading

system." Stanford does not use "his
torical grading" — no F grade is given
— while other universities do. This,
she said, makes comparisons dif
ficult.
"There may be cause to look at the
pattern of grading but the data show
no recent inflation," she said.
Mahoney is a member of the
C-AAA and her office supplied the
statistics used in the committee's re
port.
It is not clear yet what effect, if any,
the report will have on grading
habits, as C-AAA members noted the
debate over "grade inflation" is
likely to continue.
Professors outside the C-AAA vie-

wed the report in a similar manner,
stating teaching situations are so var
ied, no particular grading policy
could or should take hold.
"Roughly, I have an idea that pas
sing grades ought to be equally dis-

tributed," said Halsey Royden, dean
ot the School of Humanities and Sci
ences, about jading in the math
courses he teaches. But, lie added,
grades always depend on the intelli
gence of his students.
George Duca, a visiting scholar at
the Hoover Institution, said, "It
would be unnecessary and pretenti
ous that I should be severe in my
grading." A teacher's primary goal is
to help students learn, he said. Duca
conducts a seminar on relations bet
ween China, the Soviet Union and
the United States.
Gere said the C-AAA believes any
attempt to alter grading practices
would be difficult or foolish. "I see
the University in a much larger
light," he said, "and I recognize the
great diversity of our classes and
modes of instruction."
