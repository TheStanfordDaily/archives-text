# Scientists use Antarctic to verify Stanford theory of sun pulsation
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Scientists working at the South
Pole have confirmed the Stanford
Solar Observatory's controversial
report that the sun pulses every
two hours and 40 minutes. The
confirmation, if it continues to
withstand scientific observations,
will force major revisions in scien
tists' models of the solar interior..
The attempt to confirm the sun
pulses began shortly after three
Soviet scientists in the Crimean
noted a slight bulge in the surface
of the sun every 160 minutes. Dr.
Philip Sherrer, a senior research
associate at the Stanford Obser
vatory, said this observation
meant the sun was expanding and
contracting very slightly.
Findings confirmed
Sherrer and john Wilcox, ad
junct professor of applied physics
and director of the observatory,
decided to replicate the Crimean
experiments. After 700 hours of
observation at the Stanford facil
ity, the Russian findings were con
firmed.
Stanford's confirmation, how
ever, does not settle the matter.
Because the 160 minute pulsa
tion threatens existing solar mod

els, the observations of both the
Crimean and Stanford scientists
have been challenged by a group
of French scientists at the Univer
sity of Nice. The French scientists,
headed by E. Fossat and C. Crec,
failed to find the pulsations.
Due to the importance of the
dispute, the French, Soviet and
American scientists eventually
decided to collaborate. They
traveled to an observatory in the
Antarctic where they joined
forces with the Bartol Research
Foundation of Philadelphia's
Franklin Institute.
No fluctuation
Wilcox pointed out the advan
tages of working in the Antarctic.
"There is no 24-hour fluctuation,
they see the sun for 24 hours," he
said. In five days, the group was
able to collect almost as much
data as the Stanford and Soviet
scientists had gathered in an en
tire year.
The data was then analyzed in
the Crimean by the French scien
tists.
"A couple of weeks ago we got a
telegram from them," Wilcox
said. "It read: '160-minute oscilla
tion is present in South Pole data.

The amplitude is 33 centimeters
per second and phase is in perfect
agreement with yours."
The amplitude, or motion, is
very small in relation to the size of
the sun. Thirty-three centimeters
is equal to about one foot.
Considering the sun is 864,000
miles in diameter, the whole
bulge is too small to measure ex
cept by the most delicate instru
ments.
Sherrer said he was encouraged
by the Antarctic confirmation. He
said the discovery brings them
closer to learning more about the
interior of the sun.
"Everytirne we can measure
something at the surface we know
more about the interior," said
Sherrer.
Several serious questions re
main to be answered. If the pulsa
tions occur at exactly 160-minute
intervals, the theory would have
to be doubted by the scientists
because 160 minutes is exactly
one-ninth of a terrestrial day.
"If the oscillations are exactly
one-ninth of a day, I don't think
we'd ever believe it was real," said
Sherrer. "The sun doesn't know
