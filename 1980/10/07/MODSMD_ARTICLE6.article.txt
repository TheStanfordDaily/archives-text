# Iraqis bomb Tehran, control port

### 
From the Dally wire services
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq mounted a massive new attack
into the Iranian port city of Khorramshahr yesterday and
pushed Iranian forces back an estimated two miles but
still failed to drive the remaining Iranian defenders from
the town, while an Iraqi air attack on Tehran reportedly
killed three and wounded 65.
The Iraqi army took American and British television
crews on a tour through the dockyards of Khorramshahr
to demonstrate their control of the port. But the televi
sion reporters said that Iranian snipers were still firing
sporadically into the area. Artillery fire from both sides
rained on the city's southern district, and there was no
sign yet that the Iraqis had succeeded in seizing the
center of the city.
Both Tehran radio and the Iranian News Agency Pars
denied reports that Iraqi forces had gained control of
Khorramshahr, an important port north of Abadan on
the disputed Shatt al-Arab border waterway. British
Broadcasting Corp. correspondent Christopher Morris
reported Iraqis drove Iranian defenders from their posi
tions in fierce house-to-house fighting. He said there
still was sporadic shelling and firing on the southern
outskirts of the town.
Iraq's strategy, in keeping with the Soviet training and
style of its huge army, appeared to be to wear the Ira
nians down slowly with superior fire power and secure
supply lines.
The Iraqis attacked before dawn yesterday, their offic
ers said, their tanks and artillery driving farther inside
Khorramshahr while busloads of fresh infantry moved
up from the rear.
But Iran's U.S. trained special forces and its militant
Islamic revolutionary guards still held several
strongpoints within the city, a key transportation, ship
ping and communications center that blocks the Iraqi
army's push to the oil center of Abadan.
Iran denied several premature reports that Khorram

shahr had fallen and claimed that its forces had forced
the Iraqis to withdraw. Iraq, which has claimed victory in
Khorramshahr several times before, cautiously issued
no military communique on the battle yesterday.
It was clear, however, that Iraq had launched a major
new offensive in the area after an embarrassing week
long stalemate in which the Iranians not only held off the
Iraqi forces, but harassed them with repeated counterat
tacks.
Iraq's news agency said Iraqi planes raided Tehran in
retaliation for Iranian raids on civilian targets in Iraq.
Baghdad radio said Iranian jets bombed civilian targets
near the cities of Kirkuk, Hajomran, Amara and Iftikhar.
Iran denied its bombers raided civilian areas of Iraq.
In an alarming new turn in their war, Iran and Iraq have
begun sending jet bombers against each other's oil in
stallations, the most sensitive areas of their economies.
The extent of damage cannot be determined precisely,
but Iraq has strengthened the defenses around some of
its oilfields.
Iraq has reinforced anti-aircraft defenses around the
northern oilfields in Kirkuk and the southern storage
and shipping installations on the disputed Shatt al-Arab
border waterway, informants said yesterday.
They said Iraq's oil output was down to one million
barrels a day as a result of damage caused by raiding
Iranian jets.
Until the war broke out, Iraq was the world's second
largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. Iraq's
production had been 3.6 million barrels a day, with 3.2
million exported through the Persian Gulf and 300,000
through pipelines across Turkey and Syria to Mediterra
nean terminals.
Before the war, Iran's daily average production of
crude oil stood at 1.5 million barrels, of which some
500,000 barrels were exported through the gulf waters.
Now, Iran produces just enough oil to meet its own
needs, the same source said.

Before the war, Iran's daily average production of
crude oil stood at 1.5 million barrels, of which some
500,000 barrels were exported through the gulf waters.
Now, Iran produces just enough oil to meet its own
needs, the same source said.
From the Dally wire services
Baghdad, Iraq — Iraq mounted a massive new attack
into the Iranian port city of Khorramshahr yesterday and
pushed Iranian forces back an estimated two miles but
still failed to drive the remaining Iranian defenders from
the town, while an Iraqi air attack on Tehran reportedly
killed three and wounded 65.
The Iraqi army took American and British television
crews on a tour through the dockyards of Khorramshahr
to demonstrate their control of the port. But the televi
sion reporters said that Iranian snipers were still firing
sporadically into the area. Artillery fire from both sides
rained on the city's southern district, and there was no
sign yet that the Iraqis had succeeded in seizing the
center of the city.
Both Tehran radio and the Iranian News Agency Pars
denied reports that Iraqi forces had gained control of
Khorramshahr, an important port north of Abadan on
the disputed Shatt al-Arab border waterway. British
Broadcasting Corp. correspondent Christopher Morris
reported Iraqis drove Iranian defenders from their posi
tions in fierce house-to-house fighting. He said there
still was sporadic shelling and firing on the southern
outskirts of the town.
Iraq's strategy, in keeping with the Soviet training and
style of its huge army, appeared to be to wear the Ira
nians down slowly with superior fire power and secure
supply lines.
The Iraqis attacked before dawn yesterday, their offic
ers said, their tanks and artillery driving farther inside
Khorramshahr while busloads of fresh infantry moved
up from the rear.
But Iran's U.S. trained special forces and its militant
Islamic revolutionary guards still held several
strongpoints within the city, a key transportation, ship
ping and communications center that blocks the Iraqi
army's push to the oil center of Abadan.
Iran denied several premature reports that Khorram

shahr had fallen and claimed that its forces had forced
the Iraqis to withdraw. Iraq, which has claimed victory in
Khorramshahr several times before, cautiously issued
no military communique on the battle yesterday.
It was clear, however, that Iraq had launched a major
new offensive in the area after an embarrassing week
long stalemate in which the Iranians not only held off the
Iraqi forces, but harassed them with repeated counterat
tacks.
Iraq's news agency said Iraqi planes raided Tehran in
retaliation for Iranian raids on civilian targets in Iraq.
Baghdad radio said Iranian jets bombed civilian targets
near the cities of Kirkuk, Hajomran, Amara and Iftikhar.
Iran denied its bombers raided civilian areas of Iraq.
In an alarming new turn in their war, Iran and Iraq have
begun sending jet bombers against each other's oil in
stallations, the most sensitive areas of their economies.
The extent of damage cannot be determined precisely,
but Iraq has strengthened the defenses around some of
its oilfields.
Iraq has reinforced anti-aircraft defenses around the
northern oilfields in Kirkuk and the southern storage
and shipping installations on the disputed Shatt al-Arab
border waterway, informants said yesterday.
They said Iraq's oil output was down to one million
barrels a day as a result of damage caused by raiding
Iranian jets.
Until the war broke out, Iraq was the world's second
largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. Iraq's
production had been 3.6 million barrels a day, with 3.2
million exported through the Persian Gulf and 300,000
through pipelines across Turkey and Syria to Mediterra
nean terminals.
Before the war, Iran's daily average production of
crude oil stood at 1.5 million barrels, of which some
500,000 barrels were exported through the gulf waters.
Now, Iran produces just enough oil to meet its own
needs, the same source said.
