## War will be long-term 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Soon after the start of the Iraq-
Iran war, both the hoped-for early settlement
and the air of immediate crisis have receded.
There is growing belief among U.S. officials and
private experts that it may be a long-term, low
level war, a throbbing new headache painful for
the participants and damaging to the interna
tional economy over many months.
Despite Iraq's reported offer of a temporary
ceasefire beginning Sunday, there is no sign that
the basis for settling the conflict — or negotia
tions to explore such a settlement — are in sight.
In a variety of expressions, close followers of
military and diplomatic reports seem to be ap
proaching a broad consensus that an early break
is unlikely but that continuation of status quo
will be dangerous as well as debilitating.
"This may become a war of attrition, though
not at the same level of fighting we have seen in
recent days . . Both sides are going to feel pain
but neither side is willing to give in," said an
official monitoring the situation.
Chips are down
Another official foresaw "a protracted situa
tion in which the chips are down . . .a prot
racted stalemate, with the chance always re
maining for a flareup bringing greater instability
and the threat of wider involvement of outside
countries."
In the first rush of war news from the Persian
Gulf early last week, the predominant official
view was that Iraq's aims as well as its likely
military operations were carefully limited, and
that both Iraq and Iran had too much to lose to
spread the fighting to petroleum facilities, the
source of both nations'principal tangibleassets.
This view was shattered when first Iran, then
Iraq, bombed oil refineries and other facilities.
Moreover, Iraq moved slowly but steadily on the
ground into the Iranian oil province of Khuzis
tan, beyond the area of active territorial claims
on the border. Clearly, Iraq was after the bigger
game.
Official thinking next concentrated on the
possibility of sharp escalation which could bring
a catastrophe or crisis of worldwide repercus
sions. The most vivid scenarios were despera
tion measures by Iran: mining, bombing or
other action to shut off the international flow of
oil at the world's foremost petroleum
chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz, or air attacks
against Persian Cult oil sheikdoms alleged to be
helping or favoring Iraq, such as Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates and even Saudi Arabia.
While these possibilities remain — especially
if Iran should come to feel hard-pressed and
without other cards to play — the sense of im
minent danger felt here late last week has re
ceded.
In case of a threat to the strategic oil lanes, the
expectation in official circles was that very
strong diplomatic pressures from Gulf states as

well as Western Europe and even non-aligned
nations would be applied to Tehran. Only after
this had been tried in vain would the much
discussed international flotilla be dispatched to
take military action to protect the oil flow.
Iran's publjc statement Wednesday that it
does not intend to threaten the strait may reflect
some of those diplomatic pressures, applied on
a preemptive basis, as well as reflecting the talk
of collective military action. The statement has
been taken as a good sign, though the possibil
ity of an eventual Iranian move against the strait
— estimated by some officials earlier this week
at 30 to 35 percent — has not been written off.
The threat of an Iranian strike against Saudi
Arabia or other non-combatant Gulf states was
never considered as great in the eyes of
Washington. The Saudis, however, displayed
grave concern.
The Saudi request for help in bolstering East
ern Province air defenses, conveyed in Riyadh
last Saturday through Ambassador lohn West
and Gen. David jones, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, led to urgent and unannounced
meetings at the White House Sunday on a pro
posal to dispatch Air Force airborne warning and
command planes. Other requests — and other
positive U.S. responses — for building Saudi air
defenses mav be forthcoming.
Reports from the war zone indicate that Iraq is
nearing — and by some accounts has already
achieved — a position in Khuzistan from which it
can interrupt transportation, including rail and
pipeline oil traffic, between Tehran and Iran's
major oilfields along the Persian Gulf. Even if
Iraqi forces do notadvance much deeper, such a
stranglehold is likely to be intolerable to Iran
economically as well as politically.
Iran, in this situation, may be unable to expel
the Iraqi forces militarily and unwilling to
negotiate a deal, which is certain to involve con
cessions, to bring about their elimination
through political means. There is little expecta
tion that Iran will accept a ceasefire that leaves
Iraqi forces well inside its long-established ter
ritory.
No withdrawal
Nor are outside forces — whether the United
States, Soviet Union or the Arab lands across the
Gulf — exerting pressure on Iraq to withdraw its
forces from occupied Iran. In fact, at this point
the word "withdrawal" has been hardly heard
from any quarter as the Iraqis continue their
slow advance into Iran along a broad front.
Unless Iraq is willing to retreatfrom Khuzistan
of its own volition, which seems unlikely at the
moment, the prospect is for protracted strug
gles, both military and political. It will not be a
stable situation but a highly unstable one involv
ing air and ground attacks, sabotage, inflamed
hatreds and the ever-present possibility of new
escalation or extension of the war.
