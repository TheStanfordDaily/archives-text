# Polish Politburo debates reforms
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw — Members of the
Polish Communist Party Cent
ral Committee were locked in
bitter debate Sunday night
over proposals for political and
economic reforms and
changes in the leadership.
At least two members of the
Politburo identified closely
with Edward Gierek, the party
chief who was deposed just a
month ago, were battling to
hold their posts as apparently
were other members of the rul
ing inner circle.
The official Polish news
agency, PAP, reported only in
general terms about the un
usual second day of the meet

ing. Most of the details re
leased were about 50 speeches
made on the first day while it
appeared the session might ex
tend into an unprecedented
third day.
Some speakers expressed
dissatisfaction with the prop
osals for reform offered at the
opening of the meeting by
Stanislaw Kania, who replaced
Gierek.
The meeting of about 250 full
members and non-voting can
didates is the first to discuss
new public policy since the
government signed a historic
agreement with Polish workers
permitting them to form trade
unions free of party domina
tion for the first time in com
munist East Europe.
Party sources have admitted
that the leadership is badly
split between those who want
to fulfill the full terms of the
agreement signed on Aug. 31,

and bring major changes in the
management of the Polish
economy and those who want
to reduce the scope of the ag
reement.
In addition, some members
of the committee want incum
bents who are accused of
specific crimes such as bribe
taking and diverting public
money to be named, removed
from office and punished
more.
Taduesz Fiszbach, party
leader from Gdansk where the
free trade unions have made
their biggest gains, called for
deep party reforms.
"It is not the party but
specific persons known by
names who should prostrate
themselves before the party
and entire working class,"
Stanislaw Miskiewicz, party
leader from Szczecin, one of
the major strike centers, said.
Taduesz Grabski, a recently

named party secretary, criticized
party and government officials
who have denied guilt for pre
vious errors and now "have
ready advice and proscriptions
on how to lead the party and
country out of the biggest
political crisis in our history."
One target for criticism,
Jerzy Lukaszewicz, who was
fired as chief of party prop
aganda six weeks ago, admit
ted making errors as a Polit
buro member, and in his
specific responsibility for di
recting press, cultural and
educational policies.
But, he added, "The ac
complishments of the country
are too big, and the program of
the Polish communists too well
tested in the life of the Polish
nation and the state to debase
ourselves before the attacks on
socialism, party and the
cadres."
