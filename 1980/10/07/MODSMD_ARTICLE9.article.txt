# Panama successful with its canal
## 
### Washington Post 
Panama City — A year ago Wednesday,
the red, white and blue flag of Panama was
raised for the first time over the Panama
Canal.
There were major fears at the time and
there have been minor frictions since, but
the first 12 months of the 20-year transition
from United States to Panamanian control
over the waterway suggest that the Carter
administration decision to turn over the
canal may be one of the most successful
diplomatic moves made here since Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt built the water
way nearly 70 years ago.
As a potential blasting cap in the explo
sive world of U.S-Latin American relations
the canal as an issue has been almost to
tally defused, and as a functioning path
between the seas it now is operating as
smoothly as at any time in its history.
During the negotiations for the canal
treaties that were signed Sept. 7,1977, and
the lengthy fight to ratify them in the U.S.
Senate — where they passed by a single
vote — there were persistent worries that
the regime of Gen. Omar Torrijos had
moved to close to Cuba and socialism for
the United States to risk placing such a
strategic waterway in Panama's hands.
But over the last year many U.S. analysts
have concluded what some believed all
along, that Torrijos was mainly interested in
using the Cuban threat as a lever to get the
treaties he wanted. Now that he has them,

the analysts say, the "real" relationship
between Panama and the United States is
coming into tocus.
Torrijos and the government of his pro
tege, President Aristides Royo, havs. put
considerable distance between them
selves and the leftist activities they once
Since the ratification of the treaties, Tor
rijos has openly opposed initiatives of
Cuban President Fidel Castro within the
non-aligned movement.
The Panamanian strongman has con
tinued to support Nicaragua's Sandinista
regime, but so does the United States.
When Washington desperately needed a
place to send the shah of Iran in De
cember, Panama was virtually the only
country in the world both willing and able
to accept him. Torrinos denounced the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and boycot
ted the Moscow Olympics this summer.
"Before the treaties," said one experi
enced U.S. official, "Torrijos could never
have done anything like that. But the word
went out from on high that the Americans
weren't the bad guys anymore."
Businessmen here have noted, mean
whiles decided growth of support for the
private sector by the Panamanian govern
ment.
A key question a year ago was whether
the canal could continue functioning at all
during the complex period of transition
from U.S. to Panamanian control.
Perhaps as reflection of this lack of con

fidence on the part of the world shipping
industry, traffic through the canal de
clined dramatically through December.
Since the first of the year, however, as its
operations continued to prove efficient,
the canal has handled more ships on the
average and received more revenues than
it has at any other point in its history.
But there are problems.
Many are related to the implementation
legislation passed by the U.S. Congress
just before the canal was turned over last
year.
President Royo has called some of the
stipulations violations of the treaty. U.S.
officials acknowledge that they have
caused some difficulty but say that techni
cally the terms of the legislation do not in
fact breach the original agreement.
TheU.S. law gavethe new Panama Canal
Commission with is five U.S. and four
Panamanian members less budgetary flex
ibility and less autonomous power over
the canal than had been anticipated dur
ing the treaty negotiations.
In effect, as the Panamanians see it, the
U.S. president still has virtually complete
control over the commission until 1990.
While this has not been a problem for
Panama under the Carter administration,
Panamanian officials are worried that a
hostile U.S. president could greatly com
promise what thus far has been a smooth
transition.

While this has not been a problem for
Panama under the Carter administration,
Panamanian officials are worried that a
hostile U.S. president could greatly com
promise what thus far has been a smooth
transition.
Panama City — A year ago Wednesday,
the red, white and blue flag of Panama was
raised for the first time over the Panama
Canal.
There were major fears at the time and
there have been minor frictions since, but
the first 12 months of the 20-year transition
from United States to Panamanian control
over the waterway suggest that the Carter
administration decision to turn over the
canal may be one of the most successful
diplomatic moves made here since Presi
dent Theodore Roosevelt built the water
way nearly 70 years ago.
As a potential blasting cap in the explo
sive world of U.S-Latin American relations
the canal as an issue has been almost to
tally defused, and as a functioning path
between the seas it now is operating as
smoothly as at any time in its history.
During the negotiations for the canal
treaties that were signed Sept. 7,1977, and
the lengthy fight to ratify them in the U.S.
Senate — where they passed by a single
vote — there were persistent worries that
the regime of Gen. Omar Torrijos had
moved to close to Cuba and socialism for
the United States to risk placing such a
strategic waterway in Panama's hands.
But over the last year many U.S. analysts
have concluded what some believed all
along, that Torrijos was mainly interested in
using the Cuban threat as a lever to get the
treaties he wanted. Now that he has them,

the analysts say, the "real" relationship
between Panama and the United States is
coming into tocus.
Torrijos and the government of his pro
tege, President Aristides Royo, havs. put
considerable distance between them
selves and the leftist activities they once
Since the ratification of the treaties, Tor
rijos has openly opposed initiatives of
Cuban President Fidel Castro within the
non-aligned movement.
The Panamanian strongman has con
tinued to support Nicaragua's Sandinista
regime, but so does the United States.
When Washington desperately needed a
place to send the shah of Iran in De
cember, Panama was virtually the only
country in the world both willing and able
to accept him. Torrinos denounced the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and boycot
ted the Moscow Olympics this summer.
"Before the treaties," said one experi
enced U.S. official, "Torrijos could never
have done anything like that. But the word
went out from on high that the Americans
weren't the bad guys anymore."
Businessmen here have noted, mean
whiles decided growth of support for the
private sector by the Panamanian govern
ment.
A key question a year ago was whether
the canal could continue functioning at all
during the complex period of transition
from U.S. to Panamanian control.
Perhaps as reflection of this lack of con

fidence on the part of the world shipping
industry, traffic through the canal de
clined dramatically through December.
Since the first of the year, however, as its
operations continued to prove efficient,
the canal has handled more ships on the
average and received more revenues than
it has at any other point in its history.
But there are problems.
Many are related to the implementation
legislation passed by the U.S. Congress
just before the canal was turned over last
year.
President Royo has called some of the
stipulations violations of the treaty. U.S.
officials acknowledge that they have
caused some difficulty but say that techni
cally the terms of the legislation do not in
fact breach the original agreement.
TheU.S. law gavethe new Panama Canal
Commission with is five U.S. and four
Panamanian members less budgetary flex
ibility and less autonomous power over
the canal than had been anticipated dur
ing the treaty negotiations.
In effect, as the Panamanians see it, the
U.S. president still has virtually complete
control over the commission until 1990.
While this has not been a problem for
Panama under the Carter administration,
Panamanian officials are worried that a
hostile U.S. president could greatly com
