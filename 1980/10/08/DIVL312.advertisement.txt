Demands of grades, careers or social life, or general stress
may result in BURNOUT. When we put out more energy than
we allow ourselves to take in. Burnout manifests as fatigue,
irritability, nervousness, poor concentration or poor
performance.
Topics include:
* How to listen to your body — recognizing signs of burnout
* How to change belief about perfectionism and high
achievement which may cause overdoing without decreasing
performance
* Giving yourself time for self renewal
* Ways to increase energy — deep relaxation and optimal
nutrition
* Pacing — the art of doing just enough
* Guided imagery and unstructured time to get into your right
brain
Instruction will be through deep relaxation training, group discussion,
goal setting and brief lecturettes. Instructor — Al Scopp, Ph D
