# Thailand and Vietnam begin talks
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Thailand and Vietnam, in
a new phase ot diplomatic jockeying over
the future of Cambodia, held their first
face-to-face talks in months on that sub
ject last week at the United Nations. The
exchange ended in sharp disagreement,
but the mere tact that talks were held was
regarded as significant.
Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila,
who was in Washington Monday for meet
ings with Carter administration officials,
said his two-hour conference last Wed
nesday with Vietnamese Foreign Minister
Nguyen Co Thach produced no move
ment toward agreement on a way to obtain
the withdrawal of the 200,000 Vietnamese
troops in Cambodia. However, Siddhi re
ported that he and Thach agreed in princi
ple to meet again, though the time and
place are not agreed.
Last week's meeting was sponsored and
arranged by U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim, who has been trying to gener
ate a dialogue between Vietnam and its
Asian neighbors as a means of defusing
and eventually resolving the Cambodian
problem. Waldheim attended the first tew
minutes of the meeting, which was held in
a U.N. conference room, before leaving
the discussion to the two foreign minis

ters.
According to Siddhi, the Vietnamese of
ficial repeated Hanoi's previous position
that a demilitarized zone should be
created at the Thailand-Cambodian bor
der to prevent the conflict from spilling
over into Thai territory and facilitate stabil
ity in Cambodia that can bring about even
tual Vietnamese withdrawal. As in several
recent conference, Thach suggested that
Vietnam might withdraw a limited number
of troops from Cambodia if "peace, sec
urity and stability" are established at the
Thai-Cambodian border.
Thach previously has refused to say how
many troops might be withdrawn under
such circumstances, and he did not
specify a number in last week's talks. Sid
dhi 3aid he had learned trom a senior U.N.
official that Thach spoke of the possible
withdrawal ot 10,000 Vietnamese troops in
a talk with Waldheim. Vietnamese sources
would not confirm Monday that such a
figure had been cited.
Whatever the figure, it is of more rhetor
ical than ac tual significance at this point.
Siddhi reiterated Thailand's refusal to ac
cept the Vietnamese-sponsored de
militarized zone, part of which would be
on Thai territory. And U.S. officials said a

token Vietnamese withdrawal would be
meaningless without a system of verifica
tion to make sure it is carried out.
On behalf of Thailand and its allies in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Siddhi presented Thach with a
proposal for an international conference
to resolve the Cambodia problem through
Vietnamese withdrawal "within a
specified time-frame" under U.N. super
vision. The plan also calls tor U.N.-
supervised elections in Cambodia and
"guarantees that an independent and
sovereign Kampuchea (Cambodia) will not
be a threat to any of its neighbors."
Siddhi said the People's Republic of
China, which Vietnam considers its main
enemy, has indicated through diplomatic
channels that it would be willing to pro
vide sue h guarantees to Vietnam as part ol
a Cambodian settlement. China has also
aroused diplomatic interest by taking the
position in recent talks — including those
at the U.N. between Secretary ot State
Edmund Muskie and Foreign Minister
Huang Hua — that it will be willing to dis
tuss the Cambodian problem with Viet
nam before the withdrawal ot Hanoi's
troops from that country.

ate a dialogue between Vietnam and its
Asian neighbors as a means of defusing
and eventually resolving the Cambodian
problem. Waldheim attended the first tew
minutes of the meeting, which was held in
a U.N. conference room, before leaving
the discussion to the two foreign minis

ters.
According to Siddhi, the Vietnamese of
ficial repeated Hanoi's previous position
that a demilitarized zone should be
created at the Thailand-Cambodian bor
der to prevent the conflict from spilling
over into Thai territory and facilitate stabil
ity in Cambodia that can bring about even
tual Vietnamese withdrawal. As in several
recent conference, Thach suggested that
Vietnam might withdraw a limited number
of troops from Cambodia if "peace, sec
urity and stability" are established at the
Thai-Cambodian border.
Thach previously has refused to say how
many troops might be withdrawn under
such circumstances, and he did not
specify a number in last week's talks. Sid
dhi 3aid he had learned trom a senior U.N.
official that Thach spoke of the possible
withdrawal ot 10,000 Vietnamese troops in
a talk with Waldheim. Vietnamese sources
would not confirm Monday that such a
figure had been cited.
Whatever the figure, it is of more rhetor
ical than ac tual significance at this point.
Siddhi reiterated Thailand's refusal to ac
cept the Vietnamese-sponsored de
militarized zone, part of which would be
on Thai territory. And U.S. officials said a

token Vietnamese withdrawal would be
meaningless without a system of verifica
tion to make sure it is carried out.
On behalf of Thailand and its allies in the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), Siddhi presented Thach with a
proposal for an international conference
to resolve the Cambodia problem through
Vietnamese withdrawal "within a
specified time-frame" under U.N. super
vision. The plan also calls tor U.N.-
supervised elections in Cambodia and
"guarantees that an independent and
sovereign Kampuchea (Cambodia) will not
be a threat to any of its neighbors."
Siddhi said the People's Republic of
China, which Vietnam considers its main
enemy, has indicated through diplomatic
channels that it would be willing to pro
vide sue h guarantees to Vietnam as part ol
a Cambodian settlement. China has also
aroused diplomatic interest by taking the
position in recent talks — including those
at the U.N. between Secretary ot State
Edmund Muskie and Foreign Minister
Huang Hua — that it will be willing to dis
tuss the Cambodian problem with Viet
nam before the withdrawal ot Hanoi's
troops from that country.
