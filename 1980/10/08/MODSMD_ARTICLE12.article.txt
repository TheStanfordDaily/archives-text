# Visiting artist gains grant
## 
### Ann Krovoza 
New York sculptor Bar
bara Ross Greenberg has
been named the Pamela
Djerassi Visiting Artist for
1980-81 by a panel of rep
resentatives from the Stan
ford Art and English de
partments, the Center for
Research on Women and
the local art community.
Nest-like sculptures of
tree saplings, copper and
rags and woven forms are
Greenberg's forte. Rising to
heights of about 12 feet, her
sculptures have been dis
played both inside and out
doors. Greenberg describes

her works as a type of "ur
ban landscape"suited to
large empty spaces such as
plazas.
At present she has no
specific plans for new pro
jects, but will continue
works already underway.
Greenberg will be living
and working in the house of
the late Pamela Djerassi, in
the Santa Cruz mountains
near Stanford. She will be
provided with a stipend of
$12,000 plus additional
funds for travel, materials
and equipment. The funds
come from a grant of the
Djerassi Foundation.

The Djerassi grant is in
tended for women artists
with demonstrated profes
sional abilities. In addition,
the Djerassi Foundation
seeks to encourage intellec
tual exchange and col
lea gueship between the ar
tist and the University fa
culty and students.
Every two months, begin
ning in late October or early
November, she will hold an
"open studio"for interested
students, faculty and mem
bers of the community.
Born in Montana, Green
berg received a bachelor's
degree in literature from
Bennington College in
Vermont. She worked and
studied in Poland for
three-and-a-half years on a
stipend from the Polish
government. Recently she
exhibited her sculptures in a
group show in New York
and a solo show in
Copenhagen.
Katerine Porter, an
abstract expressionist
painter from Lincolnville,
Maine, and Susan Gussow,
who teaches drawing, paint
ing and sculptor at Cooper
Union, New York University
and Columbia University,
were recently selected to
serve a Pamela Djerassi Vis
iting Artist for the two years
after Greenberg.
