# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Nannerl Keohane Redress the imbalances 
### 
I am happy to respond to the
questions posed bv Fnglish
Prot. William Chace about my
remarks on Western Culture to
some members of the entering
class (Daily, Sept. 29 and Oct.
6). His article and the earlier
letter by French Prot. R(»bert
Cohn make it apparent that
certain parts ot my talk may
have been misconstrued, de
spite the generally accurate
story in the Daily. On other
more important matters we
have a fundamental disagree
ment.
The purpose of the talk,
which got rat Fie r lost in the re
sponses (it my colleagues, was
to defend the Western Culture
requirement against some ot
the criticisms expressed at
Stanford when the program
was being developed.
I thought it well to share with
incoming students our reason
ing on such issues as: "Why
Western culture? Why a re
quirement? And what counts
as culture anyway?" Cohn was
upset that I gave a hearing to
the skeptics, it only to rebut
their points Yet accepting his
advice to deter criticism would
reduce the initial discussion of
Western Culture to hagiog
raphy.
I am aware that not all those
who have written "great
works' in Western culture
were "upper class" by any
standard, as Professor Chace
points out. But it is undoub
tedly true that the majority ot
the authors of "high culture"
that we read today were
privileged men, well
edmated, blessed with more
leisure than most of their con
temporaries.
That there were signiticant
exceptions (and John Keats is a
strong counter-example) does
not undermine the basic point.
I recognize that "class" is an
unwieldy and often misleading
term. In this response, how

ever, I want to focus on the
issue that was more central to
my talk: the treatment ot
women in Western culture.
In the second half ot my lec
ture, I noted that almost all ot
the authors of works we now
recognize as "classics" were
male. I drew attention to the
tact that this lias led to a perva
sive bias in these works. Ft ho
ing Virginia Wool! in A Room oI
Ones Own, I mused about
how authoritatively men have
written about the experiences
and characters ot women, even
though they have been able to
observe only a part of women's
lives and minds.
Men have seen women in
c ertain roles and not in others.
They describe women in the
kitchen, the nursery, the bed
room.
They ignore the depth ot
temale friendships, the solitary
creativity of a woman poet, the
vivid experiences of pregnancy
and childbirth. Great male
writers have expressed them
selves beautitully and persua
sively about women, as on
many other topics.
Thus it is easy to torget that
they wrote from a highly selec
tive, even distorted, perspec
tive. We no longer accept their
dictates on slavery, or their ra
cial prejudices, without com
ment or explanation. We do
not yet realize that the same
detachment is called lor when
we read many of their pro
nouncements about women.
Male authors, seeing women
only from a particular point of
view, have produced
stereotypes of temale nature
and accomplishment that have
powertully attected how other
men, and women too, under
stand the character ot women.
These writers have also
tended to value the activities ot
men much more highly than
the activities of women, and
have therefore contributed to

the sense that women are sys
tematically less capable ot
worthwhile activity than men.
And in their attempts to deal
with one of the most intriguing
questions in social theory
why has the situation of men
and women been so different,
in so many places, tor so long?
the> have sometimes (alien
back on descriptions ot
women as imperfect or muti
lated males. Aristotle and
Freud, tor instance, make un
warranted and illogical leaps
trom anatomy to social struc
ture and c haracter.
Pointing this out does not
entail supposing that we are
ourselves tree trom blindnes
ses and misconceptions. It
means, instead, noticing dit
t ic ii I ties in ev en the greatest of
past works, which is a service
we should expect our succes
sors to pertorm as they read
whatever we produce today.
In his article, Professor
Chace made one of my argu
ments more succinctly than I
had myselt: Men don't always
see what women truly are."
That is the basic point. From
this I argued that we must be
careful to notice systematic
bias and distortion when we
read what men have written
about women, cor vice versa. In
dealing with one ot the most
wonderful dimensions of
human experience — erotic
passion and romantic love
men such as Keats have told us
what this teels like trorii a male
point of view.
Since women have been
more silent, we know less
about the female erotic experi
ence. It is easy to tall into the
trap of thinking that women
experience sexuality and ro
mance as the mysterious ob
jects ot male desire, rather
than as human persons with
desires and needs of their own.
These are the kinds of traps we
all do better to avoid.
In the good society we
dream about, communication
between men and women will
be fuller and more sympathetic
on both sides. More women
will write about their experi
ences and redress the imba
lances I have been discussing.
We will all know more about
the other sex, and be more
likely to respect the necessity
ot silence when there is some
thing we feel we cannot under
stand.
To note that the men who 1
wrote great works of Western
culture have rarely taken this
approach, but instead have
often perpetuated prejudice
about women, is not to reduce
or trivialize their accomplish
ments.
And it is surely not to "con
descend" to them. Condes
cension in this context would
imply not taking them seri
ously, tipding their works un
worthy of careful critical atten
tion.
It is precisely because I take
these authors very seriously,
and recognize the profound
impact they have had on the
lives ancJ thoughts of us all, that
I regard it as essential to see
their flaws as well as their mag
nificence, and not contuse the
two.

I am happy to respond to the
questions posed bv Fnglish
Prot. William Chace about my
remarks on Western Culture to
some members of the entering
class (Daily, Sept. 29 and Oct.
6). His article and the earlier
letter by French Prot. R(»bert
Cohn make it apparent that
certain parts ot my talk may
have been misconstrued, de
spite the generally accurate
story in the Daily. On other
more important matters we
have a fundamental disagree
ment.
The purpose of the talk,
which got rat Fie r lost in the re
sponses (it my colleagues, was
to defend the Western Culture
requirement against some ot
the criticisms expressed at
Stanford when the program
was being developed.
I thought it well to share with
incoming students our reason
ing on such issues as: "Why
Western culture? Why a re
quirement? And what counts
as culture anyway?" Cohn was
upset that I gave a hearing to
the skeptics, it only to rebut
their points Yet accepting his
advice to deter criticism would
reduce the initial discussion of
Western Culture to hagiog
raphy.
I am aware that not all those
who have written "great
works' in Western culture
were "upper class" by any
standard, as Professor Chace
points out. But it is undoub
tedly true that the majority ot
the authors of "high culture"
that we read today were
privileged men, well
edmated, blessed with more
leisure than most of their con
temporaries.
That there were signiticant
exceptions (and John Keats is a
strong counter-example) does
not undermine the basic point.
I recognize that "class" is an
unwieldy and often misleading
term. In this response, how

ever, I want to focus on the
issue that was more central to
my talk: the treatment ot
women in Western culture.
In the second half ot my lec
ture, I noted that almost all ot
the authors of works we now
recognize as "classics" were
male. I drew attention to the
tact that this lias led to a perva
sive bias in these works. Ft ho
ing Virginia Wool! in A Room oI
Ones Own, I mused about
how authoritatively men have
written about the experiences
and characters ot women, even
though they have been able to
observe only a part of women's
lives and minds.
Men have seen women in
c ertain roles and not in others.
They describe women in the
kitchen, the nursery, the bed
room.
They ignore the depth ot
temale friendships, the solitary
creativity of a woman poet, the
vivid experiences of pregnancy
and childbirth. Great male
writers have expressed them
selves beautitully and persua
sively about women, as on
many other topics.
Thus it is easy to torget that
they wrote from a highly selec
tive, even distorted, perspec
tive. We no longer accept their
dictates on slavery, or their ra
cial prejudices, without com
ment or explanation. We do
not yet realize that the same
detachment is called lor when
we read many of their pro
nouncements about women.
Male authors, seeing women
only from a particular point of
view, have produced
stereotypes of temale nature
and accomplishment that have
powertully attected how other
men, and women too, under
stand the character ot women.
These writers have also
tended to value the activities ot
men much more highly than
the activities of women, and
have therefore contributed to

the sense that women are sys
tematically less capable ot
worthwhile activity than men.
And in their attempts to deal
with one of the most intriguing
questions in social theory
why has the situation of men
and women been so different,
in so many places, tor so long?
the> have sometimes (alien
back on descriptions ot
women as imperfect or muti
lated males. Aristotle and
Freud, tor instance, make un
warranted and illogical leaps
trom anatomy to social struc
ture and c haracter.
Pointing this out does not
entail supposing that we are
ourselves tree trom blindnes
ses and misconceptions. It
means, instead, noticing dit
t ic ii I ties in ev en the greatest of
past works, which is a service
we should expect our succes
sors to pertorm as they read
whatever we produce today.
In his article, Professor
Chace made one of my argu
ments more succinctly than I
had myselt: Men don't always
see what women truly are."
That is the basic point. From
this I argued that we must be
careful to notice systematic
bias and distortion when we
read what men have written
about women, cor vice versa. In
dealing with one ot the most
wonderful dimensions of
human experience — erotic
passion and romantic love
men such as Keats have told us
what this teels like trorii a male
point of view.
Since women have been
more silent, we know less
about the female erotic experi
ence. It is easy to tall into the
trap of thinking that women
experience sexuality and ro
mance as the mysterious ob
jects ot male desire, rather
than as human persons with
desires and needs of their own.
These are the kinds of traps we
all do better to avoid.
In the good society we
dream about, communication
between men and women will
be fuller and more sympathetic
on both sides. More women
will write about their experi
ences and redress the imba
lances I have been discussing.
We will all know more about
the other sex, and be more
likely to respect the necessity
ot silence when there is some
thing we feel we cannot under
stand.
To note that the men who 1
wrote great works of Western

men such as Keats have told us
what this teels like trorii a male
point of view.
Since women have been
more silent, we know less
about the female erotic experi
ence. It is easy to tall into the
trap of thinking that women
experience sexuality and ro
mance as the mysterious ob
jects ot male desire, rather
than as human persons with
desires and needs of their own.
These are the kinds of traps we
all do better to avoid.
In the good society we
dream about, communication
between men and women will
be fuller and more sympathetic
on both sides. More women
will write about their experi
ences and redress the imba
lances I have been discussing.
We will all know more about
the other sex, and be more
likely to respect the necessity
ot silence when there is some
thing we feel we cannot under
stand.
To note that the men who 1
wrote great works of Western
culture have rarely taken this
approach, but instead have
often perpetuated prejudice
about women, is not to reduce
or trivialize their accomplish
ments.
And it is surely not to "con
descend" to them. Condes
cension in this context would
imply not taking them seri
ously, tipding their works un
worthy of careful critical atten
tion.
It is precisely because I take
these authors very seriously,
and recognize the profound
impact they have had on the
lives ancJ thoughts of us all, that
I regard it as essential to see
their flaws as well as their mag
nificence, and not contuse the
two.
