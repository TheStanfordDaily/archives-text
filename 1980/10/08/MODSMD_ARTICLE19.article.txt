## Is there a safer alternative to Reagan? 
### 
A recent column in the Daily
suggested that a Reagan victory
might he a good thing because
the next tour years would he so
bad that the country would
surely elect a better president
in 1%4. This is the kind of gam
ble most of us would re!use,
yet liberals who hope tomake a
statement by voting for John
Anderson or Barry Commoner
are taking an equal risk by bet
ting that four years of Ronald
Reagan won't do as much dam
age as the re-election of |immy
Carter.
Anderson would undoub
tedly be a wiser and more ef
fective president than Carter.
But at this point he has no
chance to win. Since the real
choice is between Carter and
Reagan, the question is
whether one should support
Anderson even it this helps to
assure a Reagan vk tory. I think
the answer should be no.
Reagan's economic policies
are unlikely to solve our basic
problems. His advisors favor a
balanced budget and reliance
on tree market forces to com
bat inflation, yet he recently
promised to limit imports of
lapanese c ars and steel â€” a
move that would increase the
price of both ot these basic
commodities.
He has promised to c ut gov
ernment spending but under
the present system of elec ting
members of Congress, neither
Reagan nor any other presi
dent can successfully do away
with subsidies for corporate

farmers and other privileged
groups, or eliminate tax breaks
and pork barrel projects.
Reagan's election would mean
a bonanza in federal contracts
tor the arms industry.
In order to fulfill his prom
ises Reagan will have to re
duce government services to
the poor and the otherwise
handicapped. As governor of
California he urged the adop
tion of a 19-page form for wel
fare applicants, to be filled out
once a month.
He retused to obey a court
order to raise weltare benefits
in accordance with federal
regulations, and used his veto
to eliminate unemployment
benefits for farm workers and
funds for school lunch prog
rams, child care, and minority
education.
Abroad
Reagan may do even greater
damage to the welfare of
people abroad. Carter's
foreign policy has been vacil
lating and ineffective, but he
did support the Panama Canal
treaty (which Reagan vehe
mently opposed), gave at least
nominal aid to Nicaragua, re
tused to use American power
to keep the shah of Iran from
being driven out of office, and
exerted pressure to guarantee
democratic elections in
Bolivia.
When the country was taken
over by a brutal military dic
tatorship an Argentine news
paper fomented that the new
Bolivian regime was counting

on a change in the American
presidency, presumably in the
hope of receiving future U.S.
support.
Battleground
Reagan has indicated that he
sees the world as a battle
ground between the U.S. and
the Russians. He 1 would scrap
SALT II and has urged that the
Soviet Union be expelled from
the U.N. He shows almost no
awareness of the complex
economic, religious, or politi
cal problems that affect the
behavior of other nations.
More importantly, he seems
totally insensitive to the aspira
tions ot Third World people to
be independent of both
superpowers.
Under Reagan we may once
again see U.S. military power
used to keep oppressive re
gimes from being ousted by
popular movements
perhaps in Guatemala or Fl Sal
vador. He has referred to the
shah -as a "loyal ally." His sup

porters worked to the bitter
end to eliminate sanctions
against the white-dominated
government o! Rhodesia (an
effort Carter resisted) and he
still believes that we dropped
seven million tons ot bombs on
Indochina in "a noble cause."
Most ot us will be able to
survive tour years ot a Reagan
presidency. But civil liberties in
this country will be affected for
years to come it, as could hap
pen, Reagan appoints four jus
tices to the Supreme Court.
Those who must rely on the
government for minimal stan
dards of subsistence will sut
ler. The poor and powerless in
Atrica, Asia, and Latin America
will suffereven more. And with
the unlimited arms race his
military policies virtually as
sure, the state of the world in
1984 does not look promising,
limmy Carter arouses little en
thusiasm in many of us, but he
is a tar safer alternative.
