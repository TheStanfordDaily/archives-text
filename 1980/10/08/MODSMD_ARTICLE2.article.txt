# Farallon waste 'not harmful' but key records missing
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco— Past dumping of
nuclear waste near the Farallon Is
lands in the Pacific Ocean west of San
Francisco poses no present threat to
human health, a variety of scientists
told a congressional subcommittee
hearing here yesterday.
But the testimony, tar from settling
the controversy, raised many ques
tions to be answered in the future.
The most troubling issue raised at
the hearing was the admission by
government officials that they do not
know the full extent of nuclear
wastes dumped near the Pacific, At
lantic: and Gulf coasts from 1946 to
1970, when the practice was stopped.
Although dumping under license
by the old Atomic Energy Commis
sion was somewhat documented, no
records or possible military dumping
have come to light, witnesses told
the House Subcommittee on Envi
ronment, Energy and Natural Re
sources.
The Farallon Islands site, one of
three along thePacific Coast, received
47,500 barrels of so-called low-level
nuclear waste containing abut 15,000
curies of radiation.
The other two sites, both off the
Southern California coast, together
received 7400 barrels of waste con

taining 142 curies, government re
cords indicate.
The spark for yesterday's hearing
was the failure of the U.S. Environ
mental Protection Agency to release
results of a 1977 study of the Farallon
site until pressured by state and local
governments.
When the study was released, an
analysis of it by a University of
California professor Jackson Davis,
concluded that the EPA data showed
that radiation had contaminated
food fish and that the EPA was hiding
the fact.
A portion of yesterday's hearing
turned out to be a debate over the
validity of Davis' research, with sev
eral scientists challenging him and
Davis being given the opportunity to
defend himself.
The differences of opinion became
muted somewhat when a consensus
developed that food fish from the
Fa ra I lons, a commercial fishing
ground, do not presently pose a
radiation danger to the public.
Even Davis admitted, "I still eat
fish."
But there still remain a difference
of opinion over whether the hazard
would grow as the barrels of radioac

tive waste corrode in the future and
spill their contents into the ocean.
David Hawkins, an EPA assistant
administrator, told the subcommit
tee that the agency's scientists be
lieved that the worst of the hazard
had passed, but he admitted that the
data upon which that conclusion was
based is limited.
Beverlee Myers, director of the
California Department of Health Ser
vices which has done its own analysis
of the EPA study, told the subcom
mittee that there was too little infor
mation to "make any reasonable as
sumptions."
The subcommittee, headed by
Rep. Toby Moffett, (D-Conn.) told
the EPA to work out an agreement
with the National Oceanic and At
mospheric Administration to
monitor the radioactivity of the Faral
lon Island site.
