Photos misleading
We all know that a pic ture is
worth ,1 million words, and as a
responsible news publication
llw Stanford D.nly should be
most aware of this. However, I
was dismayed to tind in yester
day's (Oct. 6) Daily what I feel
to be the misuse of two photo
graphs.
As a member of the ASSU
Counc il of Presidents, I was ex
tremely thrilled that the Daily
has given so much attention to
voter registration. They have
included an editorial article, a
Daily editorial, an announce
ment in Briefly, and more.
Therefore, it was with great

dismay that I turned to yester
day's story of the COP/
Frontlash non partisan voter
registration drive and found a
pic ture of the republican pres
idential candidate. Neither the
COP nor the Frontlash organi
zation seek to affiliate ourse
lves with any candidate, politi
cal party or issue during this
registration period. But the
photo tells a different story (a
photo ol the Reagan/Bush sup
porters table at Harvest).
I he Daily also ran a story on
Timm Williams' visit to campus
seeking student/faculty sup
port lor his cause. In this case,
the reader should expect to
find a picture which effectively

portrays the event. But instead
the Daily photo pictures Light
toot and two supporters (two
of about nine). To top it off,
these two supporters are not,
to my knowledge, members ot
the Stanford community.
The photograph is extremely
powerful in shaping our in
terpretations of news and
events, and I am confident the
D.uly constantly strives to be
responsible with its use of the
photo. The task is difficult,
especially when you have to
crank out a daily newspaper.
When mistakes or misrep
resentations occur, therefore,
it is up to the reader to clear up
the misunderstanding. In any

c ast>, who would have believed
you? (Butterfield tor Reagan??)

No more mascot
Must we continue to hear
about the Indian mascot year
after year? It seems to me that
this issue was settled long ago,
when it betame apparent that
neither the administration nor
many students were interested
in discussing the matter
further. Perhaps if we ignore
Mr. Williams (Chief Lightfoot)
he will take his racial
stereotypes elsewhere.
