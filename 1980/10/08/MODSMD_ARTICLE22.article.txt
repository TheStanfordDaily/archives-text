## Anderson: one man's political evolution 
### Washington Post 
Washington— On the stump,
|ohn Anderson quotes John
Kennedy, Adlai Stevenson and
Franklin Roosevelt He warns
against the dangers of nuc lear
power. He talks about rebuild
ing American cities, and of
providing jobs for black teena
gers. He praises the new De
partment of Education, and the
glories of the Equal Rights
Amendment.
Vet, the same )ohn Anderson
once said, "There can be little
question that Herbert Hoover
was one of our country's
greatest presidents." He once
suggested |ohn Kennedy bor
rowed the idea for a Depart
ment of Housing and Urban
Development from the 1960
Socialist Party platform.
And he once placed a letter
in the Congressional Record
that said, in part, "Culturally
and educationally the South
ern Negro is 50 to 100 years be
hind the white community and
with rare exceptions almost to
tally unprepared for equality."
To be fair, the quotations,
reported by Steven Brill in the
American Lawyer, all date back
to 1965 or before, a time when
one national political colum
nist affectionately described
Anderson as "an articulate
right winger."
Anderson is no longer a right
winger, if he ever was. But a
review of his congressional re
cord over the last 20 years of
fers little evidence that he is
the liberal some of his suppor

ters would have people be
lieve.
The New Republican
magazine, which regards itself
as the voice of informed
liberalism, recently endorsed
Anderson with this'wishful de
scription of his leftward jour
ney:
"Anderson lias been think
ing about and voting on na
tional issues for 18 years. He
started out as a rock-ribbed
Republican from an Illinois
backwater and — with no ul
terior motive until very re
cently — gradually became
more liberal. . .We would like
to think this is a natural process
foran intelligent but cloistered
mind as it opens itself to the
facts of modern life."
In the meantime, the Illinois
congressman voted against
almost every one of lyndon
lohnson's Great Society prog
rams, consistently supported
increased military spending
throughout the Vietnam War
and, as a member of the Re
publican leadership, most
often supported the social and
economic policies of Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford. He
has, within the last five years,
voted against food stamps for
strikers, for neutron weapons,
against modest cuts in military
spending, for virtually every
nuc lear measure that has come
up, and against common sites
picketing and creation of the
Office of Consumer Protec
tion.
He has opposed the

Humphrey-Hawkins full
employment bill, which he
now supports. He has sup
ported the Kemp-Roth H per
cent tax cut bill, which he now
opposes. He has opposed a
20-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax,
yet he's now made a 50-cent
a-gallon gas tax the center of
his energy program.
It is, of course, always risky
to single out a few specific
votes in a congressional career
that spans two decades. One
can prove, or disprove almost
anything.
So let's look at Anderson's
record another way, one fa
vored by liberals and conserva
tives alike — the annual judg
ing of a politician's ideological
purity by studying votes on a
series of selected issues each
year, then making ratings for
left or right approval.
By this standard, Anderson is
clearly a moderate. Perhaps
some people's version of a
thinking man's moderate, a
conservative on economic is
sues, a liberal on civil rights
and some social issues. But no
more. No less.
Move to center
His rating by the liberal
Americans for Democratic Ac
tion, for example, went above
40 percent only five times in 20
years — 1972 (44 percent), 1974
(43 percent), 1975 (58 percent),
1976 (50 percent), and 1978 (55
percent). On another liberal
scorecard, kept by the AFL
CIO, Anderson voted "wrong"
on 136 issues supported by or

gani/ed labor and only
52 times.
By contrast, his ratings by
Americans for Constitutional
Action, a major conservative
group, went above 40 percent
15 times during the same
period, ranging trom 95 per
cent in 1960, Anderson's first
year in Congress, to 44 percent
in 1978.
His approach to the
economy is close to what used
to be considered Republican
dogma, though it now is re
jected by the 1480 GOP plat
form . Anderson opposes tax
cuts advocated by Ronald
Reagan and Carter as inflation
ary. Anderson supports a ba
lanced budget. His proposals
to rebuild American industry
rely on tax breaks for business.
What all these figures indi
cate is not the move from right
to left that some Anderson fol

lowers would have people be
lieve. Rather, it is a movement
to the center of the nation's
political spectrum - a place
not drastic ally distant trom that
oc( upied by Carter.
Anderson, of course, never
has explicitly claimed to em
brace what might be called
"the liberal agenda." He has
pointedly, for example, disa
agreed with his vice presiden
tial running mate, Patrick
Lucey, a liberal Democ rat, over
national health insurance,
which Lucey supports and An
derson opposes. And, in the
past, Anderson has opposed
such liberal articles of faith as
Medicare, repeal of the oil de
pletion allowance, and public
service jobs.
"I'm not a liberal. I'm not a
conservative," Anderson says.
"I'm an independent."

to think this is a natural process
foran intelligent but cloistered
mind as it opens itself to the
facts of modern life."
In the meantime, the Illinois
congressman voted against
almost every one of lyndon
lohnson's Great Society prog
rams, consistently supported
increased military spending
throughout the Vietnam War
and, as a member of the Re
publican leadership, most
often supported the social and
economic policies of Richard
Nixon and Gerald Ford. He
has, within the last five years,
voted against food stamps for
strikers, for neutron weapons,
against modest cuts in military
spending, for virtually every
nuc lear measure that has come
up, and against common sites
picketing and creation of the
Office of Consumer Protec
tion.
He has opposed the

Humphrey-Hawkins full
employment bill, which he
now supports. He has sup
ported the Kemp-Roth H per
cent tax cut bill, which he now
opposes. He has opposed a
20-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax,
yet he's now made a 50-cent
a-gallon gas tax the center of
his energy program.
It is, of course, always risky
to single out a few specific
votes in a congressional career
that spans two decades. One
can prove, or disprove almost
anything.
So let's look at Anderson's
record another way, one fa
vored by liberals and conserva
tives alike — the annual judg
ing of a politician's ideological
purity by studying votes on a
series of selected issues each
year, then making ratings for
left or right approval.
By this standard, Anderson is
clearly a moderate. Perhaps
some people's version of a
thinking man's moderate, a
conservative on economic is
sues, a liberal on civil rights
and some social issues. But no
more. No less.
Move to center
His rating by the liberal
Americans for Democratic Ac
tion, for example, went above
40 percent only five times in 20
years — 1972 (44 percent), 1974
(43 percent), 1975 (58 percent),
1976 (50 percent), and 1978 (55
percent). On another liberal
scorecard, kept by the AFL
CIO, Anderson voted "wrong"
on 136 issues supported by or

gani/ed labor and only
52 times.
By contrast, his ratings by
Americans for Constitutional
Action, a major conservative
group, went above 40 percent
15 times during the same
period, ranging trom 95 per
cent in 1960, Anderson's first
year in Congress, to 44 percent
in 1978.
His approach to the
economy is close to what used
to be considered Republican
dogma, though it now is re
jected by the 1480 GOP plat
form . Anderson opposes tax
cuts advocated by Ronald
Reagan and Carter as inflation
ary. Anderson supports a ba
lanced budget. His proposals
to rebuild American industry
rely on tax breaks for business.
What all these figures indi
cate is not the move from right
to left that some Anderson fol

lowers would have people be
lieve. Rather, it is a movement
to the center of the nation's
political spectrum - a place
not drastic ally distant trom that
oc( upied by Carter.
Anderson, of course, never
has explicitly claimed to em
brace what might be called
"the liberal agenda." He has
pointedly, for example, disa
agreed with his vice presiden
tial running mate, Patrick
Lucey, a liberal Democ rat, over
national health insurance,
which Lucey supports and An
derson opposes. And, in the
past, Anderson has opposed
such liberal articles of faith as
Medicare, repeal of the oil de
pletion allowance, and public
service jobs.
"I'm not a liberal. I'm not a
conservative," Anderson says.
"I'm an independent."
