# Representatives drop out
## 
### 
Washington (AP>— With a $60,662 annual salary,
no prior experience required and lots of fringe
benefits, the job sounds like good work it you
can get it. So why are more than JO people giving
it up?
"I want to tind out if there's life after Con
gress," said Rep. Charles Vanik, D-Ohio, one of
the more senior members of the 1980 class of
congressional dropouts.
Vanik, 25 of his House colleagues and five
senators are sitting out the 1980 congressional
elections — by choice.
They didn't quit to run for higher office as
another eight House members are doing. And
they haven't been forced to resign by voters,
who have already "retired" nine members of
Congress in primary elections.
"I found the lifestyle incompatible with the
desire to spend more time with my family," said
Rep. John Cavanaugh, R-Neb., who is quitting
after just four years in Congress.
The 37-year-old father of four is going back to
Omaha to practice law. "I want to feel the cool

breezes blowing across the plains instead of the
hot air that fills the halls of Congress," he said.
The dropouts continue a trend begun around
the time of the Watergate scandals — a high,
steady turnover of congressional seats, by res
ignation, by retirement and by voter action.
The result, expecially in the House, has been a
dramatic change in the c hamber's makeup since
the 1974 "Watergate election." By January 1981,
well over a half of the 435-member House of
Representatives will be members who weren't
in Congress in 1974.
The changeover from a House dominated by
old timers to one controlled by relatively junior
members has taken its toll on committee chair
manships — traditionally the real source of
power in the House.
In 1978, five committee chairmen stepped
down or were defeated in their re-election bids.
This year, another five House committee chair
men have already announced their retirement.
Thus, of the House's 21 major committees, 10
have seen new chairmen in just four years.
