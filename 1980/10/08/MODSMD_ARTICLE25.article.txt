# Angry West goes Republican— again
## 
### Washington Post 
Helena, Mont. — Volumes have been
written in the past few years about the
angry West — about sagebrush rebellions,
about an alienated region on the verge of
becoming as Republican as the Old South
was Democratic, about a new Mason-
Dixon Line beingdrawn north-south atthe
hundredth meridian that stretches down
through the western Dakotas and into
Texas.
All of this is easily reinforced by a quick
glance at the electoral map of 1976. Jimmy
Carter's narrow victory that year included
Texas, but from there the map turned sol
idly Republican all the way out to the little
Democratic outpost of Hawaii with its four
electoral votes.
While the rebellion stories are relatively
new, however, the electoral story is not.
Excluding the aberration of Lyndon
Johnson's landslide, the Republican
stranglehold on the West reaches back 28
years — and its magnitude rivals the Solid
South in its totality. With the exception of
Texas, which has swung back and forth,
the 18 other Western states have yielded a
total of only 27 electoral votes to Democra
tic candidates in six of the last seven elec
tions. This is an average of 4.5 votes out of

the 128 these growing states now hold.
California, the West's presidential
bonanza, with 45 electoral votes, has re
mained out of reach of every Democrat
except Johnson for the past 28 years.
Washington state, a labor stronghold with
two Democratic senators, a Democratic
governor and six Democratic con
gressmen out of its seven-person total,
went to Johnson and Hubert Humphrey
but has steered clear of all other Democ
rats except Harry Truman.
The reasons behind the emergence of
this modern Republican monolith are not
always easy to fathom.
Two-thirds of the western states' gover
nors are Democrats. So are the mayors of
most of its major cities. And the region
continues to send more than its share of
powerful Democratic leaders back to
Congress, although many of those leaders
— Magnuson and Foley of Washington,
Church of Idaho, Ullman of Oregon, Udall
of Arizona, among others — are unusually
nervous this year.
And the West is anything but
monolithic. The Northwest is a green gar
den that uses its congressional clout to
protect its abundant water— the lifehlood

of the West — from its parched neighbors.
California is a playpen with a value system
almost as alien to Montana as the values
handed down by distant Washington,
D.C.
In 1980, the West is a dry water hole for
|immy Carter — a desert so forbidding and
empty ot hope he is campaigning as if he
doesn't govern it and can't touch it.
"People don't travel through the West,
they tly over it,"says Phil Burgess, director
of the Western Governors' Policy Office in
Denver. "Now the president is doing the
same thing and it reinforces everything
westerners teel about Carter and, perhaps
more importantly, about the federal gov
ernment.
"This kind of tly-over campaign —
treating us like colonists and not too be
nevolently at that — has a lingering effect
that could last long beyond the election."
Here, in the not-always-so-splendid iso
lation of Montana's state capital, Democ
ratic Gov. Thomas Judge believes it is
this hostility toward Washington, more
than a hostility toward Democrats, that
holds the diverse West together in presi
dential elections.
