## Is Theder on the way out? 
### 
Roger Theder is a trou
bled man. The c ireles under
his eyes are a little darker.
The eyes themselves are a
little more bloodshot.
Those are the eyes ot a wor
ried man. And don't kid
yourselt: Roger Theder is a
worried man.
T heder is like the guy who
bought stock in Chrysler a
year ago. It this were the
silver market. Theder would
be the Hunt Brothers. It it
were 1929, he would be a
stockbroker. The year is
1980 and Roger Theder is
head coach ot the Titanic.
The Titanic and the Cal
Bears must have had the
same press agent. It anyone
were leading a sinking
oceanliner, it is Theder. His
"unsinkable"football team,
the same team with Heis
man Trophy candidate Rich
Campbell leading the of
fense and preseason Ail-
American Pat Graham on
defense, is 0-4.
This is the same team who
everyone thought would
challenge Washington and
Stanford for the Pac-5 title
and a trip to the Rose Bowl.
This is the same team who
everyone thought would
burst into the meat of their
conference schedule this
week as a legitimate top 20
team.
"It's certainly not tun to
be 0-4," Theder said, and
the way Cal has gone about
it is no fun at all. The Bears
were blown out of their

opener at Florida, mes
merized by Army, then
came home to blow an 18-
point lead against Arizona
betore they were overpo
wered bv Michiiidn last

weekend. Instead of the top
20, Cal finds itselt perched
atop the Bottom 10.
"That was as good a
ballgame as we've played,"
Theder said of Saturday's
loss. You know you're in
trouble when that best per
formance is the losing end
of a 38-13 score.
Lately Theder has been
saddled with a "can't win"
tag because of comments
like this. It you can find
something nice to say about
a 38-13 loss, how do you

motivate your team to drag
themselves out ot the dregs
and win?
Alter all, athletics is no
thing it not competition,
which often leaves very little
room for being nice. Leo
Du roc her made a lifetime in
baseball out ot not being
nic e and there are plenty ol
people who think being a
nice guy is Theder's prob
lem.
One of those people is
the San Francisco writer
who hung Theder in jour
nalism effigy last week,
heightening the tension
concerning the non
performance of the Bears
and Theder's role in the
problems.
"Oh, sure it has an ef
fect," the coach said of the
controversy. "But I can't
worrry about it. The column
got our tootball team upset
and drew us a little closer."
In that sense, the hubbub
may not be all bad. Com
ments about the listlessness
of the Bears have been seep
ing out of Berkeley all sea
son, and Theder has not
denied them. In fact, the
coach benched Graham for
one game because he
thought the defense star
needed a little shaking up.
Graham responded last
week against Michigan, and
Theder admits the benching
did the trick. "Sometimes it
takes hard knocks to learn
lessons. Pat will play and
play good football from now

on," he said.
The question in the minds
ot Clal rooters now is whether
the football team needs lli.it
kind of shaking up. i.e., re
placing Theder. H<>v\ last
they forget. Was it riot List
year that Cal won the Big
Game and earned ,1 howl
trip; 1 Was it not last year that
athletic director Dave Mag
gard signed Theder to ,i
three-year contract! 1 Kest
assured that he did not give
him the new pact because
Theder is such a nice guy.
Unfortunately tor Theder,
this week's opponent will
not be much easier than last
week's. The Oregon Ducks
have lost only their season
opener, to Stanford 35-25.
Ihey have since whipped
Washington 34-10. It's a
good bet that Cal will lose
this one too and drop to 0-5.
Through it all, Theder
sees the light. "Last year
Terry Donahue at UCLA
went through the same
thing. I felt sorry for him.
They were 2-4 when we
played them and we had
them down 21-3 at the half
before they won. Terry bat
lied back and we're gonna
do the same."
The same Terry Donahue
hosts the Stanford Cardinals
Saturday. The same Terry
Donahue's team is 4-0 and
ranked fifth in the country.
Give Roger Theder a
chance.
