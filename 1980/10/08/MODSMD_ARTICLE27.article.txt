### 
Philadelphia (AP) — Greg
Luzinski, battling a near
season-long slump, hammered
a two-run homer that carried
the Philadelphia Phillies to a 3-1
victory over Houston in last
night's opening game of the
1980 National League Champ
ionship series.
Luzinski's sixth-inning shot

off Ken Forsch erased a 1-0
Astro lead and set off fireworks
over Veterans' Stadium as a
playoff-record crowd ot 65,277
howled.
The second game in the
best-of-five series will be
played tonight in Philadelphia.
Forsch had been locked in a
tight duel with Steve Carlton,

ace of the Phillies' staff, but
after Luzinski's homer gave
Philadelphia the lead, it fell to
relief ace Tug McGraw to nail
down the victory.
Carlton struggled through
the Astros' seventh, allowing
two hits. A neat pickotf throw
by catcher Bob Boone short
circuited the Houston rally and
then, in the bottom of the
seventh, Phillies Manager Dal
las Green lifted his top starter
for a pinch-hitter.
It was a bold move that paid
off when Greg Gross stroked
an RBI single to left, giving

Philadelphia a 3-1 lead.
The rest was up to McCraw,
and the veteran left-hander
preserved the victory, retiring
the last three Houston batters
in order after walking leadoff
man Luis Pujols in the ninth.
Carlton, carrying Cy Young
credentials that include 24
regular-season victories and a
major league-leading 28b
strikeouts, was shaky early in
the game.
Houston left two runners on
base in each of the first two
innings and then nicked
Carlton for a run in the third.
