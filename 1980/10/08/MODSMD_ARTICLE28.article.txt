nation's fourth-ranked team,
Stanford's women's volleyball
squad finished second in this
past weekend's UC-Berkeley
Invitational Tournament.

Because the lightly-regarded
Cardinals were seeded eighth
in the double-elimination
tourney, they had to play top
seeded and nationally-ranked
No. 4 San Diego State in the
opening round Friday. Predict
ably, Stanford lost the match in
four games, but the loss
primed coach Fred Sturm's

spikers for their next match.
Understandably inspired to
meet their traditional rivals,
the Cards knocked off the
nationally-ranked No. 13
Bears. This triumph thrust
Stanford into the finals to face
San Diego State again that
night, and the results were the
same as the previous day's.
The Cards, now 15-5, placed
Chris Anderson and jan Linden
on the all-tourney team. Stan

Friday evening at 8 at San lose
