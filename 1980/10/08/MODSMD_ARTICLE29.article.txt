# No. 1 49ers edge Cards
## 
### Dee Pak Bangalore 
Stanford's field hockey team
went in Monday afternoon to
play the Long Beach State49ers
and lost 3-2.
That, however, is not the
whole story.
Or even a part of it.
For one thing, the Cards
were definitely the underdogs
playing against the nations'
top-ranked team. The Cards
went in with a 3-2 record, while
the 49ers were 4-1. Another
factor was that the Cards are
building a totally revamped
system of play under coach
Barbara Longstreth.

Field hockey

So far the players have had to
cope with a lot of new tactical
problems because of this
change. Some have had to
overcome inexperience in
their new positions. But the
advantages of this new ap
proach were exhibited in
Monday's game when the
Cards not only built tremend
ous pressure and momentum
in the beginning but main
tained it all through the game.

Against the 49ers, this in it
self is an achievement.
The Cards got off to a very
good start with Patsy Hun
tington scoring off a Lynn
keyser assist and Becky Howell
[Hitting one in off a Kelly Wes
terwick assist. By the end ot the
first half, however, the 49ers
had come back to level the
score at 2-2. Most of the sec
ond half was a see-saw strug
gle. The teams defensed each
other so well that neither could
take advantage of the other
and score.
It seems almost incidental
that the 49ers finally defeated
the Cards especially since- it
was scored in the last minute.
Both teams came out more or
less even in planning and
execution.
The Cards' defense centered
around goalie Francecca Frec
cero and sweep Jeannine Val
adez, who is also the co
captain of the team. Howell
was outstanding â€” an aggressive
force on the forward line who
engineered many of the passes
and played an important part in
retaining possession of the
ball. Freshman Patsy Hun
tington has definitely added a

new dimension to tlie Stanford
attack, complementing the
forward line.
As Longstreth put it, "Gener
ally, there has been a continual
growth in the team perfor
mance. Our defense is mu< h
more solid. We have a poten
tially explosive attack so the
ability to store has greatly in
creased and our game form is
at the top now."
This should be exhibited in
today's game with U.C. Davis.
Valadez felt that Stanford's
in-depth line of defense was
paying off, as was the endur
ance training in practice. She
said that the team was physi
cally pertect and needed just a
little extra pep mentally to
handle situations with long
periods of high pressure, as in
the Monday game.
So Stanford's 3-3 loss against
Long Beach State is not the
story. Rather, as co-captain
Westerwick put it, "Today's
game has shown beyond doubt
that we have put it all together
now offense, defense . . . ev
erything."
