ronment Competition with the big
boys. All are synonymous with ASSU
Special [vents.
ASSU Financial Manager Steve
Davis will report tonight to the ASSU
Senate T inance Committee and try to
explain a $90,000 defic it in the Spe< ial
Events project budget. He will re
commend that the project be closed,
leaving the Stanford community with
no on-campus concerts tor at least
three months, "when a task force will
report on the project. The senate will
vote on his recommendation next
week.
The COP is forming a task force to
evaluate the project and will make its
report in early December. Members

o! the task force include representa
tives of the Dean of Student Affairs
Office, the COP and Student Arts at
Stanford.
How did Special Events lose so
much money? Why didn t the ASSU
call a stop to the projet t before it
went so tar into the red?
These are questions which stu
dents are asking themselves these
days, both the students who used to

News analysis

enjoy the concerts and the students
who worked to promote them.
There doesn't seem to be one
answer, although there are a lot of
theories. Several sources involved
with Special Events have named

competition with established prom
oters, scheduling problems, an
iner-worked underpaid statt, lac kof
ottice space arid telephones, and a
constantly changing administrative
statt, as causes ot the failure.
Part ot the problem, Davis added,
is that it is very difficult to train a new
group ot students every year.
I ormer Spec lal Events' stalt workers
have also claimed that money was set
aside tor the personal use of staffers
and that the program was run by a very
closed, top-heavy group.
Special Events lost $20,000 to
$.10,000 per year trom 1970 to 1974,
and at that time existed through fee
assessments. \ttc-r making $55,000 in
1974, Spec ial Events tell back into the
red, losing as muc has $27,(XX) in 1978
before last year s deficit.
Last year the project lost $90,000,
the biggest deficit in its 10-year his
tory.
But last year was also the year Spe
cial Events reached what assistant
director Lenny Lieberman called its
"peak of credibility" in the enter
tainment industry — a business
which is built on reputations. And it
was the year the project presented
over 40 shows, more than had ever
been presented before.
Both Lieberman and last year's di
rector John Harris denied there was
any misuse ot funds by Spec ial Events
that there was no skimming of tic
ket money for personal use or the
altering of financial records. Lieber
man said all expenditures were re
corded in detail and are present in
the ASSU books.
Harris said last year served as a
growing experience for the program
because new approaches were tried.
Council of Presidents member Marc
Ventresca pointed out, "the music
business is a very volatile industry.
Groups go up and down very quickly
and it's hard to predict which group
can be successful in concert."
One concert presented by Special
Events last spring — The Knack — ac
counted tor the niggest loss the prog
ram taced.
"I was sure that I could sell out The
Knack," said Harris. "In fact they
were signed to play the Cow Palace
and through some problems we got
them for Maples (Pavilion). The first
day we sold 1600 tickets but after that
sales just dropped off. It's something
you just can't plan tor; in fact, prom
oters all up and down the West Coast
lost fortunes on that group," he said.
Neither Harris nor Davis
was willing to release the actual fi
gures tor The Knack concert, al
though Harris said the loss was above
$ 10,000. Davis explained that he will
not even release an exact accounting
