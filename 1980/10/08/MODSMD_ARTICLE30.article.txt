Iraq reinforces military position
Beirut, Lebanon — The Iraqi army appeared to be rein
forcing its positions in and around the Iranian port of
Khorramshahr yesterday, but officials in Tehran still de
nied that the city on the Shatt al Arab waterway had been
taken.
The Iraqis also seemed to be settling in for an artillery
bombardment of the battered oil refinery town of Aba
dan, about 12 miles below Khorramshahr, before at
tempting to take that objective.
Western reporters said that Iraqi forces appeared to
be moving up additional troops, armament and bridging
equipment that could be used for an all-out assault
against Abadan.
An Iranian military communique said that Iranian air
borne troops "moved in Monday to attack Iraqi rein
forcements" and said that about 30 tanks and armored
vehicles were destroyed.
(In Khorramshahr, Los Angeles Times correspondent
Doyle McManus reported that despite the Iraqi claims ot
taking most of the city, all they appear to hold securely
are the western outskirts and the newer, western third of
the harbor. The rest, McManus reported, including a
thick forest of date palms just outside the dock yards, is
still in the hands of Iran's regular army and Islamic Re
volutionary Guards. McManus also reported that to
move on to Abadan, the Iraqis would have to push
through the center of Khorramshahr, which is still sol
idly Iranian.)
In the air, the Tehran regime admitted that five Iraqi
planes attacked the capital yesterday, hitting a service
area of Mehrzbad Airport, a small petrochemical plant,
and the large automobile assembly plant on Tehran's
outskirts.
French march against anti-semitism
Paris — New attacks against Jews were reported in
France yesterday as thousands ot people marched in
Paris to express outrage over a resurgence of anti-
Semitism.
Police reported a dozen attacks against Jewish homes
orbusinesses in the southern French cityot Montpellier.
They said a fire bomb was thrown at a Jewish-owned
grocery store in Grenoble, in central France, and there
were incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism in several smal
ler cities. No injuries were reported.
Crowds estimated as high as 100,000 took to the
streets of Paris for a march and a two-hour strike protest
ing the bombing that killed four people outside a
synagogue Friday and other attacks on Jewish institu
tions in Paris.
The march marked the first time since 1945 that rep
resentatives from all of France's four major political par
ties jointly participated in a demonstration.
The last such gathering was to celebrate the defeat of
the Nazi regime.
Nuclear arms budget increase urged
Washington — The Carter administration estimates it
will take nearly $25 billion over the next five years, or
nearly twice as much as the government is spending
now, to finance the currently planned expansion ot U.S.
nuclear weapons production.
The bulk of the new funds needed will be used to pay
for increased production of nuclear weapons materials,
such as plutonium and tritium.
The administration has determined that long-term
nuclear weapons needs cannot be met by the current
output of the three production reactors now in opera
tion at Savannah River, S.C.

lo meet the costs of this increased production of
special nuclear materials and the costs of additional
workers at the seven facilities that make up the weapons
production complex, Energy Department officials are
projecting the need for an additional $2 billion a year for
the next five years, sources said.
Jordan actively supporting Iraq
Washington — The United States, concerned that Jor
dan now is accepting supplies intended to help
neighboring Iraq tight Iran, cautioned yesterday that
such lack of neutrality could cause the Iran-Iraq war to
spread to other countries.
Prompting the U.S. concern was Jordanian King Hus
sein's decision to permit ships that cannot enter Iraqi
ports because of the fighting to discharge their cargos at
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba. The supplies apparently
then are to be transshipped across Jordan to Iraq.
State Department sources said U.S. objections to
Hussein's helping Iraq in this manner have been com
municated to Jordan "clearly and emphatically" but with
no effect. But, the sources added, the level of Jordanian
involvement in the conflict appears to be relatively low
at this point, and thev stressed that the Carter administ
ration has not threatened to take any action against
lordan if it persists in helping Iraq.
Carter sharpens attack on Reagan
Chicago — President Jimmy Carter, toughening his
alreadv tough rhetoric against Ronald Reagan, is charg
ing that the Republican's election could tear the United
States into tactions by race, by religion and by region.
In the Nov. 4 election, Carter told Chicago Democrats
on Monday, "You'll determine whetherthis Americawill
be unified or, if I lose the election, whether Americans
might be separated black from white, Jew from Christ
ian, North from South, rural from urban."
The statement came one day after five major news
organizations released surveys showing Reagan well
ahead in the electoral college vote that will actually de
cide the election.
Reagan condemns Carter's claims
Trevose, Pa. — Ronald Reagan called President Jimmy
Carter "a badly misinformed and prejudiced man" yes
terday tor suggesting that the election of Reagan would
divide the United States along racial, religious and reg
ional lines.
"I just have to say on this that I can't be angry, I'm
saddened that anyone and particularly that someone
who holds that position would intimate such a thing,"
Reagan said. "I'm not asking any apology from him, I
know who I have to account to for my actions. But I think
he owes the country an apology."
Asked if he expected Carter to continue "this level of
campaigning" until the Nov. 4 election, Reagan said,
"That's going to be up to him, but certainly he's reached
a point of hysteria that's hard to understand."
Dow Jones down 5.03; volume heavy
New York — Stock prices turned lower yesterday as
the Federal Reserve provided more evidence the
economy is recovering. Trading was relatively heavy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues, after
rising 43.77 points in the five previous sessions, fell by
5.03 to 960.67 as declines outnumbered advances by an
8-7 margin among New York Stock Exchange issues.
Volume on the Big Board came to 50.31 million shares,

forcing its positions in and around the Iranian port of
Khorramshahr yesterday, but officials in Tehran still de
nied that the city on the Shatt al Arab waterway had been
taken.
The Iraqis also seemed to be settling in for an artillery
bombardment of the battered oil refinery town of Aba
dan, about 12 miles below Khorramshahr, before at
tempting to take that objective.
Western reporters said that Iraqi forces appeared to
be moving up additional troops, armament and bridging
equipment that could be used for an all-out assault
against Abadan.
An Iranian military communique said that Iranian air
borne troops "moved in Monday to attack Iraqi rein
forcements" and said that about 30 tanks and armored
vehicles were destroyed.
(In Khorramshahr, Los Angeles Times correspondent
Doyle McManus reported that despite the Iraqi claims ot
taking most of the city, all they appear to hold securely
are the western outskirts and the newer, western third of
the harbor. The rest, McManus reported, including a
thick forest of date palms just outside the dock yards, is
still in the hands of Iran's regular army and Islamic Re
volutionary Guards. McManus also reported that to
move on to Abadan, the Iraqis would have to push
through the center of Khorramshahr, which is still sol
idly Iranian.)
In the air, the Tehran regime admitted that five Iraqi
planes attacked the capital yesterday, hitting a service
area of Mehrzbad Airport, a small petrochemical plant,
and the large automobile assembly plant on Tehran's
outskirts.
French march against anti-semitism
Paris — New attacks against Jews were reported in
France yesterday as thousands ot people marched in
Paris to express outrage over a resurgence of anti-
Semitism.
Police reported a dozen attacks against Jewish homes
orbusinesses in the southern French cityot Montpellier.
They said a fire bomb was thrown at a Jewish-owned
grocery store in Grenoble, in central France, and there
were incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism in several smal
ler cities. No injuries were reported.
Crowds estimated as high as 100,000 took to the
streets of Paris for a march and a two-hour strike protest
ing the bombing that killed four people outside a
synagogue Friday and other attacks on Jewish institu
tions in Paris.
The march marked the first time since 1945 that rep
resentatives from all of France's four major political par
ties jointly participated in a demonstration.
The last such gathering was to celebrate the defeat of
the Nazi regime.
Nuclear arms budget increase urged
Washington — The Carter administration estimates it
will take nearly $25 billion over the next five years, or
nearly twice as much as the government is spending
now, to finance the currently planned expansion ot U.S.
nuclear weapons production.
The bulk of the new funds needed will be used to pay
for increased production of nuclear weapons materials,
such as plutonium and tritium.
The administration has determined that long-term
nuclear weapons needs cannot be met by the current
output of the three production reactors now in opera
tion at Savannah River, S.C.

lo meet the costs of this increased production of
special nuclear materials and the costs of additional
workers at the seven facilities that make up the weapons
production complex, Energy Department officials are
projecting the need for an additional $2 billion a year for
the next five years, sources said.
Jordan actively supporting Iraq
Washington — The United States, concerned that Jor
dan now is accepting supplies intended to help
neighboring Iraq tight Iran, cautioned yesterday that
such lack of neutrality could cause the Iran-Iraq war to
spread to other countries.
Prompting the U.S. concern was Jordanian King Hus
sein's decision to permit ships that cannot enter Iraqi
ports because of the fighting to discharge their cargos at
Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba. The supplies apparently
then are to be transshipped across Jordan to Iraq.
State Department sources said U.S. objections to
Hussein's helping Iraq in this manner have been com
municated to Jordan "clearly and emphatically" but with
no effect. But, the sources added, the level of Jordanian
involvement in the conflict appears to be relatively low
at this point, and thev stressed that the Carter administ
ration has not threatened to take any action against
lordan if it persists in helping Iraq.
Carter sharpens attack on Reagan
Chicago — President Jimmy Carter, toughening his
alreadv tough rhetoric against Ronald Reagan, is charg

States into tactions by race, by religion and by region.

on Monday, "You'll determine whetherthis Americawill
be unified or, if I lose the election, whether Americans
might be separated black from white, Jew from Christ
ian, North from South, rural from urban."
The statement came one day after five major news
organizations released surveys showing Reagan well
ahead in the electoral college vote that will actually de
cide the election.
Reagan condemns Carter's claims
Trevose, Pa. — Ronald Reagan called President Jimmy
Carter "a badly misinformed and prejudiced man" yes
terday tor suggesting that the election of Reagan would
divide the United States along racial, religious and reg
ional lines.
"I just have to say on this that I can't be angry, I'm
saddened that anyone and particularly that someone
who holds that position would intimate such a thing,"
Reagan said. "I'm not asking any apology from him, I
know who I have to account to for my actions. But I think
he owes the country an apology."
Asked if he expected Carter to continue "this level of
campaigning" until the Nov. 4 election, Reagan said,
"That's going to be up to him, but certainly he's reached
a point of hysteria that's hard to understand."
