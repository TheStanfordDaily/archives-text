Palo Alto (AP) — The mystery of
three recent |ewelry store robberies
which netted nearly $2 million in
gems may have been broken yester
day with the arrest of three Palo Alto
residents, police said.
But only a small amount of money
and jewelry was discovered during
the arrests, and one of the suspects
claimed he was following the direc
tions of a mastermind who collected
most of the loot, police said.
A frightened woman called the
Palo Alto Police Department early
yesterday and told officers, "They're
going to kill me."
When police went to the home of
Mary Dimich, they said they found
gems taken at each of the three rob
beries.
San Francisco police said all three
suspects admitted holding up Jewels
by Jeffrey last week, a heist which
netted $500,000 in merchandise.
