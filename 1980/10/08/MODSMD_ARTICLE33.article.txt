Pressures from college, social or
business environments may com
bine to "burnout" a person, accord
ing to a local clinical psychologist.
Dr. Al Scopp says the "hallmarks of
burnout"are fatigue, irritability,
nervousness, and depression. Poor
concentration is also a result of
burnout, he says.
Scopp will teach a course here en
titled "Burnout: a self-help approach
to renewal" beginning tonight.
Sponsored by the Student Arts
at Stanford (STARTS), this six-week
course is designed to help students
and employees recognize what
causes burnout. Scopp says he will
show his students ways to "burn out
burnout."

Scopp compares burnout to a type
c* checking account when a person
makes more withdrawals than de
posits, he says, they overdraw on
their account and suffer burnout.
People can withstand only a certain
amount of stress, Scopp says.
The aim of the course is to teach
students how to keep track of their
"energetic checking balances." This
will enable them to maintain a high
level of intellectual and physical per
formance. At the same time, those
who learn the technique will be able
to constantly renew their stamina, he
says.
By setting "self-renewal" goals at
work, recreation and artistic ac
tivities students begin to cope with

burnout. Relaxation and breathing
techniques are taught to students.
Also, the importance of proper nutri
tion and vitamins is emphasized in
the course, Scopp says.
Scopp, who practices locally in
Mountain View and Santa Clara, has
taught self-help courses at UC-
Santa Cruz and several community
colleges. His courses thus far have
dealt with such topics as depression,
integrative health and headaches. He
says he has had "very gratifying re
sults and good feedback."
Scopp says that burnout, like most
stress-related problems, is overcome
by "a self-responsibility con
cept."The individual must choose
how he or she will react, he says.
