# Overseas Studies expands to Israel

The Overseas Studies Office
upped its total number of foreign
programs to 12 today as it announced
plans for its newest campus in the
port city of Haifa, Israel.
The program, which begins in July
1%1, will last for 11 months and will
include 20 Stanford undergraduate
and graduate students. The students
will attend classes at the University of
Haifa (offered in English and Heb
rew) and will be housed with Israeli
roommates in one of the university's
dormitories.
"This is both a new and excitingly
different kind ot program for us,"
said Mark Mane all, director of Over
seas Studies and professor of his
tory. "It opens up a new part of the
world to the overseas program
here."
One of the great advantages ot the
new program is the interaction it
should provide between Stanford
students and members ol the Israeli
and Arab cultures, explained Assis
tant Director of Overseas Studies
Peggy Blumenthal.
According to Blumenthal, the stu
dents will take a preliminary 10-week
intensive Hebrew course starting in
July and then will complete a semes
ter at the university. During the
semester break the students will
spend 5 to 6 weeks on a kibbutz, an
agricultural commune, in Nazareth.
"Our students will work in the
commune with the members (ot the
kibbutz), doing agricultural work
and sitting in on meetings," Blu
menthal said. "They'll be living in the
dorms and participating in the social

life of the kibbutz as well."
Then, Blumenthal explained the
students may choose to continue
with a second semester in Haifa, or
stay on with the kibbutz.
Another alternative is open to
technical students. They may also
take courses at the Israeli Institute of
Technology (Technion), which is lo
cated in Haifa and considered to be
one of the top tec hnological schools
in the world.
"If students are particularly in
terested in the Technion, we'll get
tapes of lectures sent here so they
can familiarize themselves with the
technical language," Blumenthal ad
ded.
Rabbi Mark Cartun, director of the
Stanford Hillel, said he was "glad it's
happening" and called Haifa an "in
teresting city." It's different than
Jerusalem, he added.
"They have the nicest dorms that
I've seen in Israel," he continued. "A
lot of Israelis live in the dorms.
They're not flooded with Americans
like in Jerusalem."
The noticable lac k of Americans in
Haifa also figured in its selection by
the Overseas office.
"At Haifa, they (Stanford students)
will have more Arab-Israeli interac
tion," Blumenthal said. "Jerusalem
has so much international tourism,
and a lot of study programs. Haifa has
the same high-quality with more of a
cultural mix."
This campus will be much like the
ones Stanford lias in Paris, Sao Paulo
and Nairobi in the sense that the stu
dents study directly in a foreign uni-
