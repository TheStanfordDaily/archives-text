# Jenrette convicted in ABSCAM trial
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Rep. John Jen
rette was convicted last night of ac
cepting a bribe from an FBI under
cover agent in the Abscam political
corruption investigation.
The South Carolina Democrat, the
second congressman convicted in
the Abscam investigation, was
charged with accepting the money
from the agent who was posing as a
representative of wealthy Arabs
needing special immigration legisla
tion.
Rep. Michael Myers (D-Pa.) was
convicted Aug. 30 in the first Abscam
trial and on Oct. 2, he was expelled
from the House by a vote of 376-30.
The U.S. District Court jury also
convicted John Stone, a Richmond,
Va., businessman, who was charged
with aiding and abetting Jenrette in
the bribery scheme.
The jury of eight women and four
men returned their verdicts in U.S.
District Court after some four hours
of deliberations that began just after
lunch.
After the jury foreman, Sylvia
Parker, announced the verdicts, Jen
rette, sitting at the defense table,
bowed his head and sobbed into his
hands. Stowe sat impassively as he
had during most of the five-week
trial.
Defense attorneys asked that the
jury be polled on the verdicts, and
each juror responded, "guilty," on

each charge.
Jenrette was convicted of one
count of conspiracy to commit brib
ery and two counts of bribery. Stowe
was convicted of one count of con
spiracy and two counts of aiding and
abetting bribery.
Each man could face a maximum 35
years in prison and thousands of dol
lars in fines. Sentencing will be
scheduled later.
After leaving the courtroom, Jen
rette sobbed on the shoulder of his
wife, Rita, for nearly a half hour.
He told reporters he was "very
much in shock."
"Regardless of what those (Ff3l
audio and video) tapes said, I didn't
take any money. I haven't done any
thing to sell the office," said the 44-
year-old, third-term congressman.
The jury spent more than a month
listening to witnesses and watching
FBI videotapes, as the government
tried to show that Jenrette and Stowe
split a $50,000 payoff from an under
cover agent posing as a representa
tive of wealthy Arabs.
Jenrette testified last week, deny
ing he accepted the bribe. He admits
holding bribery discussions with the
agents — discussions captured on
video and audio tape. But he con
tends the FBI has persecuted him for
six years and lured him into the talks
at a time he suffered from a severe
drinking problem.
