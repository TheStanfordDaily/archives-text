# Pictorial history a forerunner
## Alumnus writes first Stanford 'biography' 
### Samuel Howe 
Peter Allen has been writing about
Stanford for most of his life. But now,
with the release last week of a full
sized Univeristy history, Stanford is
writing about him.
Stanford! from the 112 oothills to the
Bay is a 240-page collection of Uni
versity lore and photographs, many
in color, of campus life. Allen,who
holds the title of University editor
emeritus, wrote the text, and the art
direction was done be James
Stockton, Stanford '55. Publication
marks the culmination of a project
which was envisioned at least as long
ago as the founding of the Stanford
Historical Society in 1975, said Allen.
The book is unique in its focus,
according to Allen.
"There have been interesting pub
lications, historical pictorials and
books to commemerate events" on
other college campuses around the
country, he said. "But to my know
ledge, there is no su( h book as this
elsewhere.
"This is the informal history of the
University, profusely illustrated with
just as much color as we possibly
could include."
With the publication of a picture
book format history of the school,
Stanford may be setting a publishing
trend. Other universities have con
tacted the school for more informa
tion about the project, according to
Delia van Heyst, associate director of
the Bowman Alumni House and
editor in chief of the book.
Allen said that while he enjoys tel
ling what the book is he is careful
also to say what the book is not.
It is not a critical or detailed history
of the University, although that is a
project which he said he hopes
someone will tackle, possibly in two
or three volumes' length, in time for

the University's centennial in 1981.
"I don't feel that this kind of a story
bears down on adverse aspects, just
as Sierra Club Books don't show beer
cans in the Stanislaus," the author
said wryly. "This book does show the
beauties and achievements of the
University."
At the same time he was quick to
point out that he did try to cover all
the significant events in the life of the
University.
Included are student uprisings in
the early 1900s over Mrs. Stanford's
tiring of a liberal and "anti-capitalist"
professor and in the 1960s and early
1970s over the Vietnam war.
Although he has done much in the
way of publications work for the Uni
versity, a project of this magnitude
"was not in the cards until recently,"
he said. Stanford from the foothills
to the Bay is Allen's first book. He
began work on the preliminary pros
pectus in May of 1978, and actually
started writing in january of 1979.
Owing to a "journalist's
background," Allen said, he tended
to research and write a chapter at a
time rather than do all his research at
the beginning.
One who has spent as much time
as he learning about the Univeristy
could be expected to have made at
least a few conclusions abut the na
ture and the history of the school.
To begin with, Allen surmised that
if Senator and Mrs. Stanford could
emerge from their present confines
in the Stanford Mausoleum, a stu
dent sherry hour with the couple
would be "not purely social, for they
would have interested things to dis
cuss."
Ihe senator was "an important
businessman," and would want to
know what students were doing to
provide for, as Stanford was known
to say "direct usefulness in life."

Mrs. Stanford, on the other hand,
was less outgoing and more formal
and was greatly interested in social
causes. She was very active in early
feminism, and was a close friend of
suffragette Susan Anthony. At one
time, Mrs. Stanford arranged a free
pass for Anthony on tfie railroad
which her husband's money had
helped to build.
Stanford's location was and still is
an important factor in its national
prominence. "Geography had a
great deal to do with the develop
ment of Stanford," Allen said. The
school, being in the West, has always
been infused with a c ertain "pioneer
ing spirit," and "instead of looking to
Europe, where everything was set,
we were looking the other way, "ac
cording to the author.
Also, since Stanford was one of the
few schools ol great stature in tins
part of the country, it tended to re
ceive a disproportionate amount of
grants and research funds. Individu
als and corporations could always
choose among several schools in the

Fast, "but when they got out here,
they always chose Stanford."
Likewise, the University has had
great fortune in picking "the right
president at the right time," Allen
said. Describing each of the seven
predecessors to the current presi
dent, he listed qualities which made
them particularly well-suited to the
challenges they faced.
In President Donald Kennedy,
Allen said, he sees a person "ex
tremely good in interpersonal rela
tionships with students and faculty
and eminent in professional work,"
He added that he expec ted the qual
ity of academics to be a primary con
cern of Kennedy's.
And about the student body, the
author said he found a group from
which the University "develops a lot
ot loyalty." The residence-oriented
school, the informality of relations
with faculty and the "self-sufficiency
in entertaining ourselves make for a
strong concept of 'the Stanford fam
ily,' " he said.
"We really have a small city going
on here...everything but taxing
power," he smiled.
Allen graduated from Stanford in
I ( H() and served in various publishing
( apacities for the University. He was
editor of the Stanford Alumni Review,
director of the News and Publica
tions Service, and University editor,
a post from which he retired with
emeritus standing in 197 112.
He was a founding member of the
Stanford Historical Society, which
< o-published the book along with the
Stanford Alumni Association.
Some 20,(KM) copies of the hook
have been printed. Although the
publishers have not estimated a total
i ost tor the work, the prepublic ation
sale of some 7000 c opies (at $ V2. each)
is known to have brought the book
very close to the break-even point.
