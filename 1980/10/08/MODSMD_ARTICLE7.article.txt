Arat> oil nations in the Persian
Cult are concerned that the
Iran-Iraq war could spread to
their shores and touch ott a
superpower confrontation in
the Middle East.
"The conflict has gone on
longer than is sate, said one
Arab diplomat in the third
week ot the Iran-Iraq war.
Though lew countries have
publicly taken sides in the c on
11ict, many tend to sympathize
with the Arab Iraqis, locked in
struggle with a Persian coun
try. Since the Islamic revolu
tion in Iran, many nations have

been |itter> about repeated
calls from Tehran lor export
ot the revolution.
Saudi Arabia, worried about
its vulnerability to attack
should the war spread asked
lor and received tour sophisti
cated American planes that c an
provide early warning ot air at

Beirut diplomats sa\ both
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ha\e
strengthened their oil field de
fenses, a precaution against
Iranian threats to unleash
warplanes all along the Persian

or it the regime ot Ayatullah

Ruhollah Khomeini is
threatened by deteat.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
share borders with Iraq and are

Beirut say both countries look
to the United States and other
Western countries lor protec

the Soviet Union decides to
move into the oil-rich area.
Although they are not Arabs,
Iranians are Moslems of the
Shiite set t and their revolution
lias aroused the ambitions of
Shiites in many gull states
ruled bv Sunni Moslems. A

case in point is Iraq, ruled by
Sunnis but with 60 percent ot
the population Shiite.
Tliat is why the war has re
ligious overtones and why tin'
Shiite leadership in Tehran
calls the Sunni regime ot Presi
dent Saddam Hussein in
Baghdad "infidel" and brands
Hussein a "corruptor" and
blasphemer."
Iran has repeatedly accused

ships to seek haven in gult
ports and, in the case ot jor
dan, allowing airfields to be
used by Iraqi planes and, on
Monday, mobilizing all trans
port vehicles to carry'food and
supplies to the Iraqi army.
The move, which came alter
King Hussein visited Baghdad
over the weekend, appeared to
be drawing Jordan closer to
all-out involvement in the con
flict.
"The area cannot sustain an
escalation for much longer,"
said one Arab diplomat, noting
that the Soviet Union may feel
compelled to intervene should
the Soviet-equipped Iraqi army
show signs of (altering.
"We are against the interfer
ence of superpowers and we
have said that we can and want
the gult area to detend itself,"
said another Arab diplomat.
"But we have to be helped in
doing so. After all, it is not only
our interests that are involved,
but also those of the Western
oil importers."
