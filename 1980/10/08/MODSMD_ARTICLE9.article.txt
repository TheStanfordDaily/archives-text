# Right victorious in Portugal
## 
### Washington Post 
Lisbon â€” The right wing in Portugal has
scored a landslide general election victory
that will profoundly alter the political tace of
Europe's most backward nation, nearly com
plete results showed Monday.
Six years alter a coup by young otticers
propelled the lett to power, the victorious
rightist Democratic Alliance (AD/ coalition
won a comfortable majority tor a tour-year
term and an undisputed mandate to turn the
clock back on the April 1974 "revolution ot
the tlowers."
With almost all the returns ot Sunday's
high, 85 percent, poll accounted tor, provi
sional results showed that the AD had in
creased its majority in the 250-seat assembly
to 136 seats against the 128 it won in elections
last December, raising its percentage of the
total vote from 41 percent to 47 percent. The
Socialists, despite a vigorous campaign,
dropped one seat to hold 73 and the Com
munists slumped trom December's 47 seats
to 40. The extreme lett retained control ot
one seat.
As celebration tireworks exploded during
the night and jubilant supporters honked
their way through Lisbon in endless noisy,
flagwaving motorcades, the sweeping victory
marked an undoubted personal triumph for
the alliance's leader. Prime Minister Fran
cisco Sa Carneiro and a potentially deadly
blow to the Socialist-backed sitting presi
dent, Gen. Antonio Ramalno Eanes.
President Eanes, a bitter political opponent
ot the prime minister, remains the last obsta
cle in the way of Sa Carneiro's program to
radically overhaul the revolutionary Por
tuguese constitution. Framed in the heady
days of 1975, the constitution pledges Por
tugal to tarrying out "the transition to
socialism by creating the conditions tor the
democratic exercise of power by the working
classes."
Possible defeat
With the support ot the lett, Eanes is seek
ing re-election to a second term in a presi
dential poll due in December. But a confi
dent Sa Carneiro predicted at a dawn press
conference that the president would be de
feated by AD's candidate, the conservative
and largely unknown Gen. Antonio Soares
Carneiro (no relation to the prime minister).
"These elections are the tirst round of the
presidential elections and they mark a defeat
for Eanes, who identitied with the Socialists,'"
Sa Carneiro said.
The unexpected winner of a mid-term snap
election last December with a six-seat major
ity, Sa Carneiro, 46, ran into the opposition ot

both Eanes and the military Council of the
Revolution when he attempted to put his
pragmatic rightist policies into action. Both
the president and the council, a leftover of
the revolution that acts as a constitutional
watchdog, blocked attempts to denationalize
key sectors ot the economy such as banking
and insurance.
The renewed swing to the right in Sunday's
vote, which according to AD officials surpas
sed their expectations, appeared to under
score the protound disenchantment ot the
seven-million Portuguese electorate with the
lettist and revolutionary experiments of the
recent past. Since April 1974, Portugal has
consolidated its unenviable position as West
ern Euorpe's poorest nation as average real
wages slumped by an estimated 20 percent.
Short-lived governments
Largely rural, strongly influenced by the
Catholic Church and with an illiteracy rate of
nearly 30 percent, the Portuguese voters
have an illiteracy rate ot nearlv 30 percent,
the Portuguese voters have opted twice in
less than a year tor a stable conservative
majority in Parliament and chosen un
abashedly right-wing options. There have
been 12 governments over the past six years
that have ranged trom military juntas backed
by the communists to shaky Socialist-led co
alitions and short-lived governments headed
by independents handpicked by Eanes in his
bid to remain the broker of the Portuguese
political scene.
Eanes, c redited with ridding the revolution
ot its worst excesses after he came to power
as a virtually unopposed compromise candi
date in 1976, appears to be the principal loser
in Sunday's vote. But socialist leader Mario
Soares, a former prime ministerand a leading
post-revolutionary political heavyweight,
looks certain to tace increasing unrest within
his own rank and tile, who from now on may
legitimately view him jis a consistent loser.
Difficulties would also appear to lie ahead tor
the hardline leader of the pro-Soviet Por
tuguese Communist Party, the veteran Alvaro
Cunhal.
Last January, Portugal froze its relations
with Moscow after the Afghanistan invasion,
a move that it followed up by boycotting the 1
Olympics and being the first NATO ally to
impose economic sanctions against Iran.
During this year there have been preliminary
bilateral disc ussions aimed at ceding the U.S.
Navy an aircraft carrier base in mainland Por
tugal, granting facilities at an airbase south ot
Lisbon and increasing the U.S. presence at
the Lajes base on the Atlantic Portuguese is
land in the Azores.
