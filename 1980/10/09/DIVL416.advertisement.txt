Stop
excusing
your
life
away.
Everyone has an
excuse for not seeing
their doctor about
colorectal cancer.
However, every year
52,000 men and
women die of colorectal
cancer in this country
alone. Two out of three
of these people might
be saved by early
detection and treat
ment. Two out of three.
So what is your •
excuse? Today you
have a new, simple,
practical way of
providing your doctor
with a stool specimen
on which he can per
form the guaiac test.
This can detect signs of
colorectal cancer in its
early stages before
symptoms appear.
While two out of three
people can be saved.
Ask your doctor about
a guaiac test, and stop
excusing your life
away.
