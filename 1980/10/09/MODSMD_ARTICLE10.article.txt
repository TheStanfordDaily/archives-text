# Diplomacy averts gulf war escalation
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Carter ad
ministration officials have
claimed that prompt diploma
tic action by the United States,
Britain and some Persian Gulf
countries last weekend averted
a dangerous Iraqi escalation of
its war with Iran which could
have spread hostilities to other
countries.
Without providing any milit
ary details, these officials

suggested that "ominous de
ployments" of Iraqi forces had
indicated that Baghdad might
have been planning to launch
attacks from other countries
on the three tiny Iranian is
lands in the vital Strait of Hor
muz or on the nearby port city
of Bandar Abbas.
There was no way to confirm
this American version of last
weekend's events with Iraqi
sources.
Iraq, according to other offi
cials, had moved troop
carrying helicopters into
Oman, directly across the vital
Persian Gulf waterway from the
islands, and had dispersed
numbers of its transport planes
and attack jets to six countries
throughout the region.
The concern here and in
some other gulf capitals, in
cluding Saudi Arabia, was that
if Iraqi forces struck from diffe
rent directions and othercoun
tries across the gulf, Iran might
retaliate against oil installa
tions in Saudi Arabia or other
countries harboring the raid
ers, thus not only widening the
war but potenially imperiling
western oil supplies and sup
ply routes.
Alarm bells set off
The Iraqi aircraft had been dis
patched to Kuwait, North
Yemen, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Oman and the United Arab
Emirates. Military officials,

however, say that some of this
movement was done before
the major fighting began.
Officials say Oman and the
UAE were the intended launch
ing pads and that it was the
movement of the helicopters
and "otherequipment," which
must have stopped in other
countries en route to Oman,
that set off alarm bells here and
in the gulf.
Military officials, while agre
eing that President Carter and
U.S. allies can take credit for
dampening down the war by
pressing Oman and the United
Arab Emirates to keep Iraq
from using their countries as a
staging base, stressed that the
Iraqi planes were dispersed ini
tially for defensive reasons.
Change in mind
Either before the war started
or in its early stages, one know
ledgeable source recounted,
Iraq asked Saudi Arabia, for
example, to let its planes land
there to escape any attempt by
Iran to destroy them on the
ground.
The Saudi government
quickly agreed, the source
said, and then had second
thoughts as it saw the character
of the Iran-Iraq air war change.
Both sides, after first bombing
and rocketing military targets,
went after each other's oil
facilities.

It was this bombing of oil
targets, sources said, that
made the Saudis nervous
about letting Iraqi planes stay
on their territory. The Saudis
feared this would give Iran an
excuse to bomb their oil fields.
Fears communicated
Saudi fears were communi
cated to both Baghdad and
Washington, leading the Iraqis
to withdraw their planes and
the United States to send in
four AWACS warning planes.
Government officials said
Washington did not force the
Saudis to require removal of
the Iraqi planes as a condition
for getting the AWACS planes.
The two events.were not linked
in that way, they said, though
presence of the Iraqi jets in
Saudi Arabia while the AWACS
planes were there could have
looked as though the United
States was siding with Iraq in
the conflict.
Both U.S. and Saudi officials
said Friday that there are no
Iraqi planes in Saudi Arabia
now and that they would not
be welcome in the foreseeable
future as the Saudis try to keep
out of the war.
Other military officials said,
however, that the planes leav
ing Saudi Arabia appear to be
going to other countries, and
planes previously scattered to
other Middle Eastern countries
are still there.

Oman, directly across the vital
Persian Gulf waterway from the
islands, and had dispersed
numbers of its transport planes
and attack jets to six countries
throughout the region.
The concern here and in
some other gulf capitals, in
cluding Saudi Arabia, was that
if Iraqi forces struck from diffe
rent directions and othercoun
tries across the gulf, Iran might
retaliate against oil installa
tions in Saudi Arabia or other
countries harboring the raid
ers, thus not only widening the
war but potenially imperiling
western oil supplies and sup
ply routes.
Alarm bells set off
The Iraqi aircraft had been dis
patched to Kuwait, North
Yemen, Jordan, Saudi Arabia,
Oman and the United Arab
Emirates. Military officials,

however, say that some of this
movement was done before
the major fighting began.
Officials say Oman and the
UAE were the intended launch
ing pads and that it was the
movement of the helicopters
and "otherequipment," which
must have stopped in other
countries en route to Oman,
that set off alarm bells here and
in the gulf.
Military officials, while agre
eing that President Carter and
U.S. allies can take credit for
dampening down the war by
pressing Oman and the United
Arab Emirates to keep Iraq
from using their countries as a
staging base, stressed that the
Iraqi planes were dispersed ini
tially for defensive reasons.
Change in mind
Either before the war started
or in its early stages, one know
ledgeable source recounted,
Iraq asked Saudi Arabia, for
example, to let its planes land
there to escape any attempt by
Iran to destroy them on the
ground.
The Saudi government
quickly agreed, the source
said, and then had second
thoughts as it saw the character
of the Iran-Iraq air war change.
Both sides, after first bombing
and rocketing military targets,
went after each other's oil
facilities.

It was this bombing of oil
targets, sources said, that
made the Saudis nervous
about letting Iraqi planes stay
on their territory. The Saudis
feared this would give Iran an
excuse to bomb their oil fields.
Fears communicated
Saudi fears were communi
cated to both Baghdad and
Washington, leading the Iraqis
to withdraw their planes and
the United States to send in
four AWACS warning planes.
Government officials said
Washington did not force the
Saudis to require removal of
the Iraqi planes as a condition
for getting the AWACS planes.
The two events.were not linked
in that way, they said, though
presence of the Iraqi jets in
Saudi Arabia while the AWACS
planes were there could have
looked as though the United
States was siding with Iraq in
the conflict.
Both U.S. and Saudi officials
said Friday that there are no
Iraqi planes in Saudi Arabia
now and that they would not
be welcome in the foreseeable
future as the Saudis try to keep
out of the war.
Other military officials said,
however, that the planes leav
ing Saudi Arabia appear to be
going to other countries, and
planes previously scattered to
other Middle Eastern countries
are still there.
Washington — Carter ad
ministration officials have
claimed that prompt diploma
tic action by the United States,
Britain and some Persian Gulf
countries last weekend averted
a dangerous Iraqi escalation of
its war with Iran which could
have spread hostilities to other
countries.
Without providing any milit
ary details, these officials

suggested that "ominous de
ployments" of Iraqi forces had
indicated that Baghdad might
have been planning to launch
attacks from other countries
on the three tiny Iranian is
lands in the vital Strait of Hor
muz or on the nearby port city
of Bandar Abbas.
There was no way to confirm
this American version of last
weekend's events with Iraqi
sources.
Iraq, according to other offi
cials, had moved troop
carrying helicopters into
Oman, directly across the vital
Persian Gulf waterway from the
islands, and had dispersed
numbers of its transport planes
and attack jets to six countries
throughout the region.
The concern here and in
