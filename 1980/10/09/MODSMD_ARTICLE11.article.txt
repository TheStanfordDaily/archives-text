# Dome spurs imagination
## 
### Brian Sprague 
Hidden away on the fifth floor of the Terman
Engineering Building, stands an awe-inspiring
creation of Stanford's Mechanical Engineering
Department, a 16-foot diameter geodesic dome.
This unique conglomeration of cardboard,
rivets and glue is affectionately called "the im
aginarium" by its creator and caretakers.
The bright-red dome, slightly resembling a
large golf ball, was "designed to acquaint
people with their power of imagination," says
Gayle Curtis, a graduate in product design and
one of the two present caretakers of the im
aginarium. Curtis explains that often "the tradi
tional educational system tends to block the im
aginative process of the individual," who is
taught to memorize formulas, not to utilize
human creative processes.
People use the dome much like a
planetarium, watching images projected on its
inner surface and absorbing the other stimuli
the dome provides, Curtis said.
"People become less willing to use their im
agination. It's a mode of thinking that many
people are uncomfortable with," says Rickson
Sun, caretaker of the dome and former graduate
student.
To deal with this aspect of education, the im
aginarium was built to "make people more com
fortable with their imagination," adds Sun.
Aid for students
One of the imaginarium's purposes is to aid
students in Mechanical Engineering 101 (Visual
Thinking), according to Curtis. He explains that
students are given assignments to solve specific
problems in a creative fashion. The imaginarium
was created as an aid for these students, says
Curtis, to give "access to more problem solving
tools."
Sun points out, however, that hurdling the
barriers that restrict the use of the imagination is
only the initial objective of the imaginarium. He
says that whether the imaginarium is used by
Mechanical Engineering majors or not, its major
purpose is to "develop your sense of imagina
tion as a tool for designing, the same way you
use mathematics as a tool and drawing as a
tool." Sun says that each additional tool
simplifies the task of problem solving.
According to Curtis, Mechanical Engineering
Professor Robert McKim developed the im
aginarium idea in 1972 after seeing a similar
dome in use at California State University at San

lose for audio-visual experimentation.
McKim chose the design of the dome,
gathered the necessary funds for its creation
and wrote the entire text for the imaginarium
experience, said Curtis, who added that McKim
also wrote the text for the visual thinking class
he teaches.
To use the imaginarium, Curtis says, groups of
12 to 13 people are ushered inside and are asked
to arrange themselves comfortably on the raised
carpeted platform. They lie down with their
bodies pointing outward so that their heads can
rest on the doughnut-shaped pillow in the
center.
Tension relieved
Relaxation is essential in the imaginarium,
Curtis explains, and several exercises are used
to relieve participants' tension.
The only visible working part of the im
aginarium is the spherical lens in the center of
the pillow which projects images from several
projectors below the platform onto the ceiling,
much like at a planetarium.
But, says Curtis, the imaginarium experience
is different from its planetarium counterpart be
cause "it involves all the human senses."
Through the use of extensive audio-visual
equipment, an air conditioning system that in
jects desired scents into the dome at specific
intervals and the experience of actually eating
an apple while inside the imaginarium, each of
the five senses becomes stimulated, according
to Curtis.
Senses all engaged
The theory behind the imaginarium, he says,
is that the body becomes more receptive to its
imaginative abilities if all its senses are engaged
in the process. "It's one of the basic objectives
of the imaginarium," states Curtis.
Although participants' reactions vary widely
from "It's really neat" to "I fell asleep halfway
through it," most people concerned with the
project deem it not merely an alternative to the
Sunday Night Flicks, but a device with definite
positive results.
Sun comments, "It works, in that it makes
people less fearful of their imagination. They
become more willing to use it."
Whether or not the imaginarium spurs the
minds of its participants depends upon the indi
vidual. One participant comments on his ex
perience, "If it does nothing else, it helps you to
relax."

experience, said Curtis, who added that McKim
also wrote the text for the visual thinking class
he teaches.
To use the imaginarium, Curtis says, groups of
12 to 13 people are ushered inside and are asked
to arrange themselves comfortably on the raised
carpeted platform. They lie down with their
bodies pointing outward so that their heads can
rest on the doughnut-shaped pillow in the
center.
Tension relieved
Relaxation is essential in the imaginarium,
Curtis explains, and several exercises are used
to relieve participants' tension.
The only visible working part of the im
aginarium is the spherical lens in the center of
the pillow which projects images from several
projectors below the platform onto the ceiling,
much like at a planetarium.
But, says Curtis, the imaginarium experience
is different from its planetarium counterpart be
cause "it involves all the human senses."
Through the use of extensive audio-visual
equipment, an air conditioning system that in
jects desired scents into the dome at specific
intervals and the experience of actually eating
an apple while inside the imaginarium, each of
the five senses becomes stimulated, according
to Curtis.
Senses all engaged
The theory behind the imaginarium, he says,
is that the body becomes more receptive to its
imaginative abilities if all its senses are engaged
in the process. "It's one of the basic objectives
of the imaginarium," states Curtis.
Although participants' reactions vary widely
from "It's really neat" to "I fell asleep halfway
through it," most people concerned with the
project deem it not merely an alternative to the
Sunday Night Flicks, but a device with definite
positive results.
Sun comments, "It works, in that it makes
people less fearful of their imagination. They
become more willing to use it."
Whether or not the imaginarium spurs the
minds of its participants depends upon the indi
vidual. One participant comments on his ex
perience, "If it does nothing else, it helps you to
relax."
Hidden away on the fifth floor of the Terman
Engineering Building, stands an awe-inspiring
creation of Stanford's Mechanical Engineering
Department, a 16-foot diameter geodesic dome.
This unique conglomeration of cardboard,
rivets and glue is affectionately called "the im
aginarium" by its creator and caretakers.
The bright-red dome, slightly resembling a
large golf ball, was "designed to acquaint
people with their power of imagination," says
Gayle Curtis, a graduate in product design and
one of the two present caretakers of the im
aginarium. Curtis explains that often "the tradi
tional educational system tends to block the im
aginative process of the individual," who is
taught to memorize formulas, not to utilize
human creative processes.
People use the dome much like a
planetarium, watching images projected on its
inner surface and absorbing the other stimuli
the dome provides, Curtis said.
"People become less willing to use their im
agination. It's a mode of thinking that many
people are uncomfortable with," says Rickson
Sun, caretaker of the dome and former graduate
student.
To deal with this aspect of education, the im
aginarium was built to "make people more com
fortable with their imagination," adds Sun.
Aid for students
One of the imaginarium's purposes is to aid
students in Mechanical Engineering 101 (Visual
Thinking), according to Curtis. He explains that
students are given assignments to solve specific
problems in a creative fashion. The imaginarium
was created as an aid for these students, says
Curtis, to give "access to more problem solving
tools."
Sun points out, however, that hurdling the
barriers that restrict the use of the imagination is
only the initial objective of the imaginarium. He
says that whether the imaginarium is used by
Mechanical Engineering majors or not, its major
purpose is to "develop your sense of imagina
tion as a tool for designing, the same way you
use mathematics as a tool and drawing as a
tool." Sun says that each additional tool
simplifies the task of problem solving.
According to Curtis, Mechanical Engineering
Professor Robert McKim developed the im
aginarium idea in 1972 after seeing a similar
dome in use at California State University at San

lose for audio-visual experimentation.
McKim chose the design of the dome,
gathered the necessary funds for its creation
and wrote the entire text for the imaginarium
experience, said Curtis, who added that McKim
also wrote the text for the visual thinking class
he teaches.
