# Children's books banned from shelves
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Francisco — Not long
ago, a San Francisco woman
went to the public library to
check out a copy of Mary Pop
pins, the fanciful book about
an English nanny that has de
lighted children for years. But
she discovered that the book is
banned from the shelves.
Mary Poppins, as it turned
out, had long since been re
viewed by a committee of libra

rians here and found unsuita
ble for children.
"The book treats minorities
in ways that are derogatory,"
said Joan Dillon, the library's
director of children's services.
"It's written from the old En
glish view of the 'white man's
burden.' "
Dillon denies that the library
is giving in to censorship.
"Committee decisions are
madeonly afterverycareful de

liberations," she says. "This is
not done in some arbitrary
fashion."
Startling as it may seem, San
Francisco's treatment of Mary
Poppins is not all that unusual
these days, according to pub
lishers and librarians. Even in
this tolerant era — and in this
a tolerant city— there is still
pressure to keep some chil
dren's books out of the public
library.
The American Library As
sociation says that censorship
controversies persist around
the nation. Some works such
as J.D. Salinger's Catcher in the
Rye — remain the center of
disputes after literally decades
of controversy. And the associ
ation suspects that considera
ble censorship these days is
practiced quietly so as not to
attract attention — for exam
ple, when a library removes a
book from the shelves in what
it merely calls a "re
evaluation."
"It's scary," says ludith Krug,
director of the library associa
tion's Office of Intellectual
Freedom. "Everyone wants to
protect the children. The prob

lem is, they're going to be so
protected they won't be able to
function in the year 2000."
Mary Poppins is not the only
children's book to encounter
such criticism in recent years.
For example, Huckleberry
Finn, Tom Sawyer, Little Black
Sambo, Five Chinese Brothers
and some early Nancy Drew
mysteries have all been cited
on various occasions as per
petuating racial stereotypes,
authorities say.
The Poppins book, written
by P.L. Travers and first pub
lished in 1934, first came under
criticism some years ago, ac
cording to Anna Bier, a senior
editor for its publisher, Har
court Brace jovanovich, Inc.
"Mrs. Travers was very upset,"
recalls Pier. "She had written
the stories years and years ago,
with no intention of any racial
slurs."
Travers made c hanges in the
book.
The changes have been in
print since 1977, according to
the publisher. But the changes
have not satisfied critics, who
still object to the tone and con
tent of the book.
