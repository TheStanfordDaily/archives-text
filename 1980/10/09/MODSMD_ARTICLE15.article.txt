## Carter's stealth poses problems 
### 
In 1976 Jimmy Carter was
elected on a promise to never
lie to the American people.
That was the first time he bent
the truth and us backwards
overa barrel. Fouryears later it
seems he's severed the tendrils
of truth from his promises al
together.
Few remember that the pres
ident promised reduced de
fense expenditures in 1976. As
recently as 1978 he and Secret
ary of Defense Harold Brown
boasted of accomplishing re
duced defense spending.
Among other things a new nuc
lear aircraft carrier and the B-1
bomber were junked. The MX
missile system was initially op
posed and deployment of the
Cruise missile delayed as the
number of unemployed in the
defense industry increased.
Then came the aftermath of
Iran and Afghanistan. Political
tashions changed. So did Car
ter's promises. Now the Cruise
missile was not being "de
layed," but proposed as the vi
able alternative to the B-1
bomber Carter rejected.
That bomber, Carter says, is
obsolete in comparison to the
new "Stealth" bomber. Quite a
stealthy bomber until the Pres
ident's re-election campaign
got underway. And still
enough of a secret to remain
the Pentagon's greatest paper
airplane. Thus far it has evaded
all Soviet radar but gotten no

farther than the B-I's guided
course to the White House
waste paper basket. But no
doubt the Stealth on paper is
good enough to fool a few vot
ers.
Unfortunately the Stealth
won't be operational for years
to come — and costs are grow
ing. Still, this poses no unsolv
able problem for a stealthy in
cumbent. Simply promise
three out of four economic
planks to Senator Kennedy in
exchange for votes on the MX
missile system. (Never mind
that Democratic leadership in
Congress will ignore these
anti-recessionary party
planks.) The MX will fill the gap
until the Stealth's deployment.
Or rather it would if we had the
warheads to fit the missile
with. Incidentally, we don't.
But who will count, right?
That's about all a stealthy in
cumbent should do to fulfill a
new promise (increased de
fense spending) and break an
old one (decreased defense
spending). Almost all.
Every sweet needs a topping
or two — something extra to
entice. So throw in Presidential
Directive 59. This statement
"promises" additional direc
tion of nuclear warheads to
wards military targets. This
supposedly equips us with a
more selective deterrent.
However, not enough
warheads exist to do this.

What's more, in the event of a
Soviet first strike so few of our
missiles (some estimate fewer
than 20 percent) would survive
as to render implementation of
this policy impossible. Unless,
of course, Carter fires first.
One would think this a good
place for a stealthy incumbent
to stop. Yet the implausibility
of Presidential Directive 59
hasn't prevented Carter's re
vealing another paper dragon
— the "rapid deployment
force." Here (on paper) is a
practically self-sufficient milit
ary force tailored for crisis situ
ations in areas like the Mid-
East. Never mind that the force
didn't even have a headquar

ters when our hostages were
seized in Iran. Carter has prom
ised it. And that promise is
good until he decides to
change it.
What is at stake here is the
truth — or more specifically
the credibility of the president
of our United States. The re
cord shows quite convinc
ingly: For a president elected
on a promise of openness and
sincerity, Jimmy Carter has re
ceived an A-plus for his stealth
and deception of the American
people.
