## Orientation time well-spent? 
### 
A confused eighteen-year
old walks off Eastern's flight
723, New York to San Fran
cisco, typewriter case and
camera in hand, wondering
where he will find the "red
shirted volunteers" so plainly
described in Approaching
Stanford. Much to his surprise,
ten volunteers have formed a
pyramid at the gate, and are
chanting, "Stanford, Stan
ford!" That is how many of this
year's frosh, including myself,

began their orientation
weekend.
Even after freshmen orienta
tion is over, many freshmen
are still voicing their feelings
and especially their concerns
about that first weekend.
Though my concerns may not
be shared by all freshmen, I
feel they are by no means un
reasonable. Even though I
found orientation fun and in
formative, I felt there were
many ways it could be im
proved in the future.
One point that bothered me
was that I was scheduled to
meet with my advisor the day
after I received Courses and
Degrees. In that same day, I
had to get my phone, post of
fice box key, meal card, and
other items. I would rather
have had Courses and Degrees
during the summer. Marty
Koenigs, student freshmen
orientation coordinator, felt
that students would only be
guessing blindly at courses if
they had had the book earlier.
Even though it was possible to
plan a program in a day or two,
I feel that having more time to
think things over would have
made me more confident of my
course selections.
I was greatly disturbed by the
seemingly unavoidable lines at

the phone center, the post of
fice, the meal card office, and
other places. Much time was
taken away from planning
programs. At times I won
dered, "Whycouldn'tall of this
be done by mail?"
Another complaint I had was
in regard to field day. I felt
there was not enough time to
participate in all of the ac
tivities, or better yet, a longer
field day. Koenigs agreed that
there was not enough time to
participate in more than one or
two things. In any case, swim
ming with the LSJUMB, in
struments and all, in the De
guerre pool, was the highlight
of many people's field day.
I felt the nicest part of the
orientation program occurred
upon my arrival on campus. I
was surprised by a crowd of
people greeting me by name.
My first thought was, "Do I
know these people? Should I
know these people?" They
made me feel very comfortable
on that first, hectic day. Most
freshmen had similar reactions
to their RA's.
Overall, freshmen orienta
tion is unique. By far my most
serious complaint was that it
ended, and classes had to start.
