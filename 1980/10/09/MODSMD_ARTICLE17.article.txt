Harvest thanks
Harvest: Opportunities on
the Farm provided a wonderful
opportunity for several univer
sity departments to combine
their efforts for the benefit of
students. Thus, members of
the Stanford community who
participated in any aspect of
HARVEST have not only the
ASSU to thank, but also the Of
fice of Student Activities, Resi
dential Education, the Lively
Arts at Stanford, and most im
portantly, Tresidder Union —
with a special thanks to the
members of STARTS.
Too often in the aftermath of
a big event, someone or some
organization that played a key
role is forgotten. Untortunat
ley, exactly this happened in
relation to HARVEST. Despite
statements in the Daily which
indicated sole sponsorship by
the ASSU Council of Presi
dents, HARVEST could never
have occurred without the as
sistance, enthusiasm and
energy offered to the project
by Tresidder.
It was exciting to see such a
large HARVEST turnout which
in turn sets a precedent for
more co-sponsored events,
and further development of a
cohesive spirit within the Stan
ford community. For those in
terested in providing feedback
for next year's HARVEST, there
will be an open evaluation
meeting today at noon in the
ASSU Office.
Thank you again Tresidder
for all your help — and here's
to all the HARVESTS of the fu
ture!
