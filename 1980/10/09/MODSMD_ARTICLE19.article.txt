# THE 						STAN FORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Lane Webster The 						price of aspirations 
### 
No one seemed to pay much
attention to it, but I, for one,
was disturbed recently by kim
berly Belton's unsuccessful at
tempt to make an N.B.A. team.
Belton was the indisputable
star of the Stanford basketball
program over the last few
years, shooting and dribbling
down the Maples Pavilion floor
and easily catching the eye of
the Phoenix Suns, who drafted
him in the second round.
But now, after tryouts, the
decisions have been made and
kimberley Belton, a rare Stan
ford pro basketball prospect,
did not make the cut.
Belton may rebound, so to
speak, but whether he does or
not, I would think the some
times airy pride of Stanford
might be a little flatter after this
turn of events.
Because every Stanford stu
dent knows what it's like to
make the cut, to be one of
eight chosen by the brains in
the Admission Office, it is easy
for us to imagine ourselves at
the top of the world.
But as Belton's demise
points up, the intractable logic
of Darwinism never ceases to
apply no matter what stage an
individual is at, no matter what
apparent pinnacle he or she
has reached.
The experiences of other
Stanford graduates testify to
this: the Phi Betta Kappas, who
failed to make the cut of the
Rhodes and Marshall Scholar
ship committees; the M.B.A.s
who never become chief
executive officers, and turn to
middle management or real es
tate; the student body leaders,
like David Harris, who have yet
to win the seats in Congress to

which they aspire. More power
to them, if that is what they
seek.
There's nothing wrong with
aspiration, without it none of
us succeed, but along with
academic preparation for suc
cess, we may need, in our col
lege years, spiritual prepara
tion for failure. Or if not for
failure, at least for mediocrity.
According to Dean Harga
don, most of the members of
the freshman class when asked
to describe themselves with a
single adjective chose two
words more often than others:
ambitious and determined.
Well and good, but the rest of
us were too, Belton on down.
So were the two brothers in
the class of '49 memorialized
by thÂ» sculpture we call "The
Claw." One brother was killed
in World War 11, the other in an
accident. " The sculptor Aris

titides Demetrios tried to con
vey the tragedy of the brothers'
lives by making the sculpture
suggestive of many things in
cluding fish and fire, and by in
corporating jets of water which
would be altered by the wind,"
the Stanford catalog descrip
tion reads.
The irony of that sculpture
representing unfulfilled possi
bility being situated at the epi
center of student activity, so
full of possibility, should not
be lost to us. Whether you are
just entering or preparing to
leave Stanford, the idea may be
to pursue, along with all the
other things, something for
which no one competes, which
no one can beat you out of,
which even death cannot inter
rupt, something transcendant
and eternal.
