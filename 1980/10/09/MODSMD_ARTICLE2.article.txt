# New report reveals concerns of 'non-faculty teachers'
## Lecturer-position status considered inferior 
### Todd Pickett 
Inferior status, undefined work
and salary scales, and job insecurity
are among the problems facing Stan
ford lecturers, according to a new
report by the Committee on the Edu
cation and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
"Lecturers tend to be overworked
and have little chance for promo
tion," the CEEW said, adding, "They
may be employed on a very tempor
ary and intermittent schedule."
There are more than 250 lecturers
— 150 men and 102 women — who
teach everything from music to
biological science at the University
and its overseas campuses, but, un
like professors, are not members of
the Academic Council.
Sixty-two percent of the women
and 22 percent of the men claimed
their lecturing position is either their
only source of income or is
supplemented by part-time jobs out
side the University. The remaining
lecturers, the report found, hold
full-time jobs outside the University
in fields like engineering, computer
science, law and business.
At the root of each problem is the
lecturer's undefined teaching role,
the CEEW said.
13 years experience
While some lecturers are hired for
a short term of one quarter to a year,
others have lectured for as long as 13
years. This is especially true of the
language departments in which a
large percentage of the actual teach
ing is done by lecturers.
Although a few of the lecturers
have acquired two- to three-year
contracts, many are employed on a
year-to-year basis. This is not condu
cive to a sense of job security, the
study found.
Two criteria — the departmental
need for the lecturer's class based on
its popularity and the lecturer's "ex
cellence in teaching'' — are the only
specifications which determine a lec
turer's reappointment.
Large load
Another repercussion of their un
clear status is the unusually large
teaching load which many of the lec
turers carry.
While an assistant professor — a
notch above lecturer in teaching
status — may teach five to six courses
throughout the year, itis not unusual
for a lecturer to have eight classes
yearly, according to Senior Italian
Dept. Lecturer Annamaria
Napolitano.
Also, benefits for lecturers are un
clear, causing confusion in the case
of a sabbatical. Standardized salary
scales for lecturers have not been
published, leaving each lecturer to
negotiate his own earnings with a
department.
Second-class citizens
According to the report, as a result
of the undefined status of the lec
turer position, many lecturers said
they feel as if they are treated as in
feriors by the academic community
here — what one lecturer called
"second-class citizenship." The re
port cited their low status as a reason

why only a smal I percentage of assis
tant professorships are awarded to
lecturers, although many have said
they felt qualified.
In addition, many lecturers have
found little opportunity for greater
involvement in the academic affairs
of the University.
The CEEW report contains several
recommendations.
Work description
Among them is the request for a
work description for lecturers in
each University department. This
would include guidelines for the
selection, reappointment and prom
otion of lecturers.
Because of the need for general
information about salaries, and the
feeling that lecturer earnings are
somewhat lower than those at other
educational institutions, a published
list of salary information was re
quested. Also, the CEEW recom
mended that all new lecturers should
be informed of the benefits available
to them.
With a view to the limited voice of
lecturers in academic decisions,
more interaction between faculty
and lecturer was encouraged with a
possible enstatement of a lecturer
observer in the Academic Senate.
Career path urged
Finally, the CEEW suggested that
potential opportunities for promo
tion be explored, especially for those
lecturers who h.:!d advanced de
grees.

The CEEW's report is not the first
action that has been taken in an at
tempt to improve the status of the
lecturer. In 1975, the Senate of the
Academic Council met to pass a re
solution concerning the reappoint
ment of lecturers for longer terms.
Designed to create greater job
security, the resolution stipulated
that lecturers hired on a half-time
basis for a term of one year or less
should continue teaching only under
a two- or three-year contract. Addi
tionally, the resolution stated that
lecturers serving for five years or
more, after "appropriate review,"
would be given the title of senior lec
turer.
No difference
The senior lecturer would be re
hired continuously if performance
was "satisfactory and programmatic
needs continue." All other factors —
salary, teaching load, benefits, etc.
— would not necessarily differ from
the regular position of lecturer.
However, it soon became clear
that the resolution did not provide
enough job security. Lecturers ex
perienced a reduction in appoint
ments to less than half-time, and
many were not granted an additional
contract of three years. The contract
requirement was stricken from the
resolution, although departments
were encouraged to grant contracts
where possible.
In 1978, in another attempt to al
leviate their problems, a group of

lecturers met with a committee
headed by Bliss Carnochan, then
graduate dean. Many of the same
concerns regarding a working defini
tion for lecturers, salaries, represen
tation in decision making, benefits
• tnd job security were discussed. Al
though many recommendations
were made by the Carnochan com
mittee, few were implemented.
The CEEVV report completed this
summer is a reiteration of those same
grievances.
Not all of the lecturers appear to
favor steps being taken toward a
more defined outline of the lec
turer's position. Some enjoy the flex
ibility the position allows for per
sonal writing, research, or a part
time interests or hobbies, the study
found.

department.
Second-class citizens
According to the report, as a result
of the undefined status of the lec
turer position, many lecturers said
they feel as if they are treated as in
feriors by the academic community
here — what one lecturer called
"second-class citizenship." The re
port cited their low status as a reason

why only a smal I percentage of assis
tant professorships are awarded to
lecturers, although many have said
they felt qualified.
In addition, many lecturers have
found little opportunity for greater
involvement in the academic affairs
of the University.
The CEEW report contains several
recommendations.
Work description
Among them is the request for a
work description for lecturers in
each University department. This
would include guidelines for the
selection, reappointment and prom
otion of lecturers.
Because of the need for general
information about salaries, and the
feeling that lecturer earnings are
somewhat lower than those at other
educational institutions, a published
list of salary information was re
quested. Also, the CEEW recom
mended that all new lecturers should
be informed of the benefits available
to them.
With a view to the limited voice of
lecturers in academic decisions,
more interaction between faculty
and lecturer was encouraged with a
possible enstatement of a lecturer
observer in the Academic Senate.
Career path urged
Finally, the CEEW suggested that
potential opportunities for promo
tion be explored, especially for those
lecturers who h.:!d advanced de
grees.

The CEEW's report is not the first
action that has been taken in an at
tempt to improve the status of the
lecturer. In 1975, the Senate of the
Academic Council met to pass a re
solution concerning the reappoint
ment of lecturers for longer terms.
Designed to create greater job
security, the resolution stipulated
that lecturers hired on a half-time
basis for a term of one year or less
should continue teaching only under
a two- or three-year contract. Addi
tionally, the resolution stated that
lecturers serving for five years or
more, after "appropriate review,"
would be given the title of senior lec
turer.
No difference
The senior lecturer would be re
hired continuously if performance
was "satisfactory and programmatic
needs continue." All other factors —
salary, teaching load, benefits, etc.
— would not necessarily differ from
the regular position of lecturer.
However, it soon became clear
that the resolution did not provide
enough job security. Lecturers ex
perienced a reduction in appoint
ments to less than half-time, and
many were not granted an additional
contract of three years. The contract
requirement was stricken from the
resolution, although departments
were encouraged to grant contracts
where possible.
In 1978, in another attempt to al
leviate their problems, a group of

lecturers met with a committee
headed by Bliss Carnochan, then
graduate dean. Many of the same
concerns regarding a working defini
tion for lecturers, salaries, represen
tation in decision making, benefits
• tnd job security were discussed. Al
though many recommendations
were made by the Carnochan com
mittee, few were implemented.
The CEEVV report completed this
summer is a reiteration of those same
grievances.
Not all of the lecturers appear to
favor steps being taken toward a
more defined outline of the lec
turer's position. Some enjoy the flex
ibility the position allows for per
sonal writing, research, or a part
time interests or hobbies, the study
found.
Inferior status, undefined work
and salary scales, and job insecurity
are among the problems facing Stan
ford lecturers, according to a new
report by the Committee on the Edu
cation and Employment of Women
(CEEW).
"Lecturers tend to be overworked
and have little chance for promo
tion," the CEEW said, adding, "They
may be employed on a very tempor
ary and intermittent schedule."
There are more than 250 lecturers
— 150 men and 102 women — who
teach everything from music to
biological science at the University
and its overseas campuses, but, un
like professors, are not members of
the Academic Council.
Sixty-two percent of the women
and 22 percent of the men claimed
their lecturing position is either their
only source of income or is
supplemented by part-time jobs out
side the University. The remaining
lecturers, the report found, hold
full-time jobs outside the University
in fields like engineering, computer
science, law and business.
At the root of each problem is the
lecturer's undefined teaching role,
the CEEW said.
13 years experience
While some lecturers are hired for
a short term of one quarter to a year,
others have lectured for as long as 13
years. This is especially true of the
language departments in which a
large percentage of the actual teach
ing is done by lecturers.
Although a few of the lecturers
have acquired two- to three-year
contracts, many are employed on a
year-to-year basis. This is not condu
cive to a sense of job security, the
study found.
Two criteria — the departmental
need for the lecturer's class based on
its popularity and the lecturer's "ex
cellence in teaching'' — are the only
specifications which determine a lec
turer's reappointment.
Large load
Another repercussion of their un
clear status is the unusually large
teaching load which many of the lec
turers carry.
While an assistant professor — a
notch above lecturer in teaching
status — may teach five to six courses
throughout the year, itis not unusual
for a lecturer to have eight classes
yearly, according to Senior Italian
Dept. Lecturer Annamaria
Napolitano.
Also, benefits for lecturers are un
clear, causing confusion in the case
of a sabbatical. Standardized salary
scales for lecturers have not been
published, leaving each lecturer to
negotiate his own earnings with a
department.
