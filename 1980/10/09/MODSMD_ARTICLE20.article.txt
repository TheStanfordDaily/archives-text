The American people are being effectively persuaded to accept
the building of a nuclear time bomb on American soil. The pre
sence of that time bomb, if it becomes a part of the eco-system,
can only result in severe and long-lasting environmental devasta
tion.
One must consider the sheer order of magnitude of the toxicity
of the by-products of nuclear fission reactors. Dr. )ohn Gofman,
professoremeritus of medical physics at UC-Berkeley, estimates
that there are about 21 billion potential doses of lung cancerper
pound in the plutonium produced by these reactors, if it is finely
divided and all the small particles were to find their way to human
lungs.
In one year of operation a large nuclear plant generates fission
products such as Plutonium, Uranium 232, Cesium 137and Stron
tium 90 in a quantity equal to what is produced by the explosions
of 23 megatons of hydrogen bombs, or more than a thousand
bombs of the Hiroshima size. That is only one plant. The Depart
ment of Energy would like to see America covered with hundreds
of them.
These toxins are extraordinarily long-lived; Plutonium 239, for
instance, has a half-life of 24,400 years.
One is forced to predict the impossibility of successful con
tainment of these poisons. Burps, spills, leaks and unplanned
catastrophes large and small have plagued the nuclear industry
from the very beginning. Barrels rust and start to leak. Valves
malfunction. A geological formation assumed to be stable may
turn out not to be.
For instance, burial in salt mines is one idea that was tried,
disregarding the fact that under certain conditions of tempera
ture and pressure salt becomes a liquid. What about our drinking
water for the next 25,000 years?
One ought to point to the lack of any real public regulation of
the nuclear industry. The nuclear industry, in a sort of reverse
Catch-22, is largely responsible for regulating itself. It measures
its own levels of radioactive fallout; despite the fact that it has an
obvious vested interest in minimizing the measurements made
available to public knowledge. It exercises censorship upon sci
entific research which would tend to arouse the scrutiny of
American citizens.
In this context, Dr. Thomas Mancuso's longitudinal study of
workers at the Hanford atomic plant showed that they were dying
of cancer in suspiciously high numbers while working exposed to
levels of radiation falsely advertised as safe by the standard-set
ting bodies. Upon publishing this data, he found that his research
funds were cut off and the project transferred to Oak Ridge
Laboratory, where presumably the DOE can arrange to get the
answers it prefers to the real ones.
We do not need to use nuclear power to satisfy our energy
needs. We have not even begun to exercise a policy of responsi
ble conservation, developing solar, geo-thermal, windmill, and a
cleaned up coal industry as sources of power. Once these alter
native sources of energy are viewed as the real answer, and
American ingenuity is turned loose, supported by research and
funding, we may find that we can develop new technologies
which satisfy our energy needs without doing damage to the
environment and to ourselves.
If the American public is numbed into acquiescence by the
reassuring pronouncements of government scientists, it may
awaken one day to find that we have created an environmental
Auschwitz from which there is no escape. Consenting to the
building of nuclear power plants with present technology is play
ing dice with the future of humanity. It is a game we are almost
sure to lose.

tainment of these poisons. Burps, spills, leaks and unplanned
catastrophes large and small have plagued the nuclear industry
from the very beginning. Barrels rust and start to leak. Valves
malfunction. A geological formation assumed to be stable may
turn out not to be.
For instance, burial in salt mines is one idea that was tried,
disregarding the fact that under certain conditions of tempera
ture and pressure salt becomes a liquid. What about our drinking
water for the next 25,000 years?
One ought to point to the lack of any real public regulation of
the nuclear industry. The nuclear industry, in a sort of reverse
Catch-22, is largely responsible for regulating itself. It measures
its own levels of radioactive fallout; despite the fact that it has an
obvious vested interest in minimizing the measurements made
available to public knowledge. It exercises censorship upon sci
entific research which would tend to arouse the scrutiny of
American citizens.
In this context, Dr. Thomas Mancuso's longitudinal study of
workers at the Hanford atomic plant showed that they were dying
of cancer in suspiciously high numbers while working exposed to
levels of radiation falsely advertised as safe by the standard-set
ting bodies. Upon publishing this data, he found that his research
funds were cut off and the project transferred to Oak Ridge
Laboratory, where presumably the DOE can arrange to get the
answers it prefers to the real ones.
We do not need to use nuclear power to satisfy our energy
needs. We have not even begun to exercise a policy of responsi
ble conservation, developing solar, geo-thermal, windmill, and a
cleaned up coal industry as sources of power. Once these alter
native sources of energy are viewed as the real answer, and
American ingenuity is turned loose, supported by research and
funding, we may find that we can develop new technologies
which satisfy our energy needs without doing damage to the
environment and to ourselves.
If the American public is numbed into acquiescence by the
reassuring pronouncements of government scientists, it may
awaken one day to find that we have created an environmental
Auschwitz from which there is no escape. Consenting to the
building of nuclear power plants with present technology is play
ing dice with the future of humanity. It is a game we are almost
sure to lose.
