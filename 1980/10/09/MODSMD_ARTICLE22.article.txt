# Economics group founded

### Patrick O'Reilly 
Economics students at last have a group of
their own to help share their fun and frustra
tion â€” ASSUME, the Association of Students
of Stanford University Majoring in
Economics, is now on campus.
According to senior Wendy Wallner, co
president of ASSUME, the goals of the or
ganization are twofold. ASSUME plans to im
prove students' understanding of the popu
lar economics major and to strengthen the
Economics Department.
Wallner cites the need for more coopera
tion between economics majors and profes
sors. In particular, she mentions the chal
lenge many seniors face in obtaining recom
mendations for graduate school.
Activities planned so far include a peer
counseling program, a tutorial system, a
faculty/student brown-bag lunch and a celeb
ration after the Graduate Management Ad
missions Test.

ASSUME has already established a Stanford
chapter of the National Economics Honor
Society.
Wallner says ASSUME hopes to sponsor a
panel discussion on the economic issues in
the 1980 presidential election and the impli
cations of the economic programs proposed
by the presidential candidates.
Wallner expresses optimism about the or
ganization. So far, she says, the faculty has
shown enthusiastic support and approxi
mately 15 initial members have joined in or
ganizing the group.
Senior Greg Chabolla, an economics
major, says he thinks ASSUME will help
students "feel more comfortable with the
profs."
Prof. Richard Muth, director of under
graduate studies in economics, commends
the "live wires" who started the organiza
tion. Describing himself as "terribly optimis
tic" about ASSUME, Muth stated that "such
associations can really be invaluable."
