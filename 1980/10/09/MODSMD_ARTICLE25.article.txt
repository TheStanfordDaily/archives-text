# Genes inserted in patients' cells

Loft Angeles (AP) â€” Genetic engineering
was used on humans for the first time, as
far as is known, by a UCLA doctor who
tried to cure a fatal inherited blood disease
by adding a new gene to the living cells of
two patients, university officials said yes
terday.
The historic and controversial proce
dure was carried out in Israel and Italy by
Dr. Martin Cline.
The results of the procedure were re
portedly inconclusive. After three months
there was no indication that the new
genes, inserted into defective cells of the
patients' bone marrow, were producing
normal blood cells.
Both patients were reported alive and
doing well, although the treatment appa
rently had no effect on the disease, called
beta thalassemia major. Victims are unable
to produce normal hemoglobin, a blood
molecule that carries the oxygen needed
by all tissues.
UCLA's human subjects committee on
July 22 rejected Cline's proposal to try the
treatment on campus with victims of sickle

cell anemia, an inherited blood disorder
that primarily affects blacks.
The rejection "was not because of risk/'
said Albert Barber, UCLA vice chancellor
for research. "It was because the commit
tee felt there was a need for doing a bit
more (animal research for) validation of
the scientific basis of the experiment."
Barber and others, although concerned
that the human work may have come a bit
too soon, stressed the experimental pro
cedure's tremendous potential for treat
ing currently incurable genetic diseases.
"I feel the possibilities for alleviating
human suffering by these techniques,
when they are worked out, is enormous,"
Barber said.
Cline said he went to Hadassah Hospital
in jerusalem and University Poly Clinic in
Naples not to avoid strict U.S. guidelines,
but to find patients. Although rare in this
country, the disease is relatively common
in the Mediterranean area.
The procedure was carried out before
the UCLA committee rejected Cline's ap
plication. A 21-year-old woman was

treated July 10 in Jerusalem and a 16-year
old girl on July 15 in Naples.
Cline won acclaim last spring when he
and his UCLA colleagues successfully
transferred new genes into bone marrow
cells of living mice. He said then, "I would
say clinical (human) trials could begin in
three years."
The two patients were treated about
three months later.
The procedure, as developed in animal
research, involves rem ; ng a small
amount of bone marrow from the patient.
An appropriate gene is snipped from cells
from another source.
Using a process developed by Richard
Axel of Columbia University, the marrow
cells and the genes are mixed and some
cells are supposed to accept the genes into
their genetic make-up.
The changed cells are theoretically cap
able of doing something they had been
unable to do before, such as make normal
hemoglobin. The marrow cells are then
injected back into the patient, where they
should produce more changed cells.
