# Smog siege chokes Los Angeles
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — The worst Oc
tober smog siege in nine years
and the most widespread in at
least a decade yesterday sent
scores of persons to hospitals
for treatment of respiratory
problems.
Not just persons suffering
from asthma, bronchitis and
emphysema are seeking medi
cal aid, one hospital spokes
man noted, but otherwise
healthy persons who have
never before been affected by
severe smog symptoms.
Second-stage episodes oc
curred in the Basin on five days
last week, and Tuesday and
yesterday of this week, Jim
Birakos, deputy executive of
ficer for the South Coast Air
Quality Management District,
said.
A second-stage episode is
logged when the ozone count
reaches .35 parts per million
parts of air and continues for at
least an hour.
Healthy feel symptoms
"In this stage," Birakos
explained, "even the normal
healthy individual can feel
symptoms. Industry must cur
tail its activities and companies

employing 100 or more per
sons put car-pooling programs
into effect."
There were no second-stage
episodes at all during October
from 1972 through 1977.
A broader area of the Basin
has been hit by second-stage
episodes this month than in
the equally smoggy October of
1971, Birakos said. But the
readings for this October and
October 1971 are far below the
record smog experienced here
in the summer of 1955, when
the ozone count passed the .50
mark on 15 days for an average
of 59 minutes each time.
Caused by weather
Birakos blamed the current
smog siege on unusual
weather conditions — high
pressure that is keeping a lid of
warm air over the Basin and
keeping the cooler, polluted
air below from rising and dis
persing.
Under this lid, he went on,
automobile exhaust, sulfur
dioxide emissions from indus
try and clouds and fog are
trapped. Then the sun breaks
through and begins to cook the
mixture, manufacturing smog.
During a prolonged inver

sion period, such as now, the
ingredients that generate smog
slosh back and forth over the
Basin from day to day, building
up the smog to progressively
higher levels.
Winds help
Winds can be a great help in
dispersing the pollutants, but
they have been light during the
current siege.
Birakos said first-stage
episodes occur when the
ozone reaches .20 for an hour
and that third-stages require a
reading of .50 for an hour.
There has never been a third
stage episode in the Basin.
If it ever appeared that
third-stage episodes were
likely to occur, a holiday would
be proclaimed for the Los
Angeles Basin, Birakos said.
Business and industry would
be shut down and residents
would be urged to stay in their
homes.
Worldwide interest
Los Angeles smog sieges are
widely reported around the
world. During the current one,
Birakos said, his office is av
eraging 2000 telephone calls a
day from people all over the
country and from such foreign

nations as Australia and the
British Isles.
The callers ask for instruc
tions on what they should do if
their cities should be hit by
smog and offer suggestions as
to what Los Angeles should do
to solve the problem.
One Minneapolis caller even
offered to send Birakos a tank
of oxygen.
