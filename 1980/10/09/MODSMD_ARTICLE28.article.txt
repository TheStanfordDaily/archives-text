# Electronic mail speeds inter-office memos here

What do riding a bicycle and operating the
new computer "terminals for managers"
(TFM's) have in common?
According to Edward Shaw, director of Stan
ford's Center for Information Technology
(CIT), they are both difficult to learn the first
day but easily become second nature.
University President Donald Kennedy and
nearly 80 other top administrative personnel
here began this year to send inter-office memos
through computer terminals at their desks. The
electronic mail system, a one-year experiment,
provides an alternative to conventional mail and
telephones.
Managers type messages into their units.
These are recorded on the University's large
computer system and sent to the addressee's
terminal. The messages are waiting when the
addressees log on. They can answer them or
save the messages until later.
According to Shaw, an electronic message has
the impact of a phone call and the clarity of a
written memo. It is also more time-efficient.
Shaw said he can read through 70 messages in
about half an hour.
Some of the 80 terminals have been in opera
tion since the first week in August, and the rest
should be installed by mid-October. The first
few weeks of the pilot project indicate "an awful
lot of traffic," said Shaw.
Franklin Riddle, associate controller, said he
responds more quickly to inquiries now. "On
the telephone, you spend a lot of time missing
each other," he said. Riddle now reads his mail
on the terminal three or four times a day.
Common complaints of TFM users include
lack of person-to-person contact, a resistance to
learning to type again and general skepticism
concerning failure within the system.

According to Bob Hamrdla, assistant to the
president, the system is not "the savior tor ev
erything that goes wrong in communication."
For example, he said, "the exercise ot writing
something on paper and getting it right is an
exercise this system doesn't do."
Hamrdla, who called himself a computer
skeptic, said the system has not saved him time
yet. "I haven't decided in the long run whether
it's going to be a good thing tor us or not," he
said.
Some "modest reserve money" is currently
being used to finance the one-year experiment,
said Shaw. Each terminal costs less than $10() a
month to lease and may eventually be purch
ased for approximately $1200.
"We're trying to figure out how much it ought
to cost,"he said.
According to a recent report to the task force
on computing, the University now spends over
$35 million annually in typing, filing and retriev
ing stored text. If the system could make possi
ble a 50 percent decline in thecurrent 4.5 percent
annual growth of clerical personnel, the Univer
sity would save more than $11 million in five
years.
The TFM concept is not a new technology.
"We're just taking what we've had around here
for a lot of years and applying it in a new way,"
said Shaw.
Shaw emphasized that computing was previ
ously not broadly used because it was difficult to
understand.
But computers are growing quickly. "There
will be a time when your telephone and your
computer terminal are one and the same thing,"
said Shaw.
CIT staff members train managers to use the
terminals and provide operation manuals.

According to a recent report to the task force
on computing, the University now spends over

"We're just taking what we've had around here

understand.
But computers are growing quickly. "There
will be a time when your telephone and your
computer terminal are one and the same thing,"
said Shaw.
CIT staff members train managers to use the
