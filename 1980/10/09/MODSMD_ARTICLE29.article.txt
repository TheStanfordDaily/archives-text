## Yes as good as ever 
### Richard Martinez 
After fooling nearly every one of the near
capacity Cow Palace c rowd by their entry for
Monday evening's performance, the members
of Yes also surprised those in attendance who
expected a mediocre concert because of the
loss of the band's two premiere performers.
As the house lights dimmed for the com
mencement of the show, spot lights led the au
dience to expect the band's entrance from a side
entry on the floor. The crowd became frenzied
as Yes appeared from behind a circular, satin
curtain on the elevated portion of its patented
"theatre in the round" stage. The effect was
most successful and it added to the brilliance of
the evening's opening n'umber, setting the stage
for an inspired performance.
Highlighting the songs from its latest album,
Drama, the band also blended in its classic
pieces of the past during the 13-song, two-hour
set.
Under the close scrutiny of perennial Yes
supporters were the two new additions to the
quintet, lead vocalist Trevor Horn and keyboar
dist Geoff Downes. Formerly of the British band,
The Buggies, Horn and Downes replaced Yes's
masterful singer, Jon Anderson, and virtuoso
keyboardist, Rick Wakeman.
Their performances were at least solid, and
even reached heights of brilliance. This integra
tion and transition may be the most successful
of any band since drummer Phil Collins took
over the vocal responsibilities for Genesis after
Peter Gabriel's departure. And while it is dif
ficult to recreate the performances of such mus
ical legends as Anderson and Wakeman, Horn
and Downes satisfied me beyond expectation
and seem destined for even greater improve
ment with time and experience.
Horn possesses a vocal tone and style that is
almost alarmingly similar to those familiar st
rains of Anderson, and Downes showed great
signs of classical ability and discipline that place
the delicate yet intricate synthesized sounds of
Yes under worthy proprietorship.
The undisputed stars of the show, however,
were the veteran members of the group —
guitarist Steve Howe and bassist Chris Squire.

Perhaps, singularly, the tinest masters of their
respective instruments, and, together, undoub
tedly the tinest tandem in the business, Howe
and Squire kept the audience under almost a
constant state ot mesmerized awe at their musi
cal and physical presence.
During Howe's solo performance of "The
Clap," I wondered how people like Ace Frehley
and Peter Frampton could possibly have the au
dacity to call themselves guitarists. The apparent
ease with which Howe handled the complex and
fast licks during "Yours Is No Disgrace" and
"Starship Trooper" made me sorry that he
hasn't pursued a solo career to a greater extent.
Directly across from Howe on the circular
stage stood the ominous figure of bassist Chris
Squire. He stood a head taller than the band's
other members and, adroitly wielding his mas
sive Rickenbacher bass, he provided more than
adequate musical foundation for Yes' melodies.
In fact, Squire's most impressive moments oc
curred not during his famous solo performance
of "The Fish," but during the songs that com
plement his virtuosity best — "Does It Really
Happen?" and "Machine Messiah" — both
tracks off the latest album.
The repertoire consisted of five of Drama's six
cuts, two unreleased numbers, and the old favo
rites "Yours Is No Disgrace," "And You and I,"
"The Fish," "Starship Trooper" and the encore
"Roundabout." Thus, the tempo of the concert
was predominantly upbeat. The one slower
piece, "And You and I," found Horn's voice to
be particularly sweet while the harmonies bet
ween Howe's pedal steel guitar and Downe's
synthesizer created perhaps the most beautiful
sounds I've ever heard in concert.
America's favorite food may be hamburgers
but once one tastes caviar nothing else will do.
Coors may be no downstream beer but a lover of
Chivas Regal wouldn 't be satisfied even if it were
brewed from heavenly waters. Similarly, once
one comes to appreciate the musical realm that
is Yes, the Electric Light Orchestra simply won't
suffice anymore. It may be bourgeois, it may be
snobbish, but Yes fans simply can't help them
selves. You see, there is no substitute once one
has experienced one of the finer things in life.


es bassist Chris Squire dominates the stage before a near-capacity the loss of Rick Wakeman and Jon Anderson, Yes is still the best in the
ow Palace crowd. Yes' Monday night concert showed that despite business.
