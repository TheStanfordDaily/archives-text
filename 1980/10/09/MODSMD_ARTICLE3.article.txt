# 20 former Donnerites fleece frat
## Rush results imperil Theta Xi 
### David Frank 
The Theta Xi fraternity faces possi
ble withdrawal from the University
fraternity system because it failed to
meet required pledge quotas in re
cent rushes, according to Diana
Conklin, director of the Row, frater
nities and special priority houses.
Theta Xi members claim they mis
sed their 1980 pledge quota because
the frat was fleeced by a large group
of freshmen last spring. They claim
the group agreed to pledge and then
changed its mind at the last minute.
Surprisingly, this year the frater
nity boasts its largest membership in
two decades.
Under University housing regula
tions, a fraternity that fails to pledge
its required share for three out of
four consecutive years may be with
drawn from the fraternity system and
placed in the University housing
draw system.
According to Conklin, Theta Xi
failed to meet its quotas in the 1977
and 1978 rushes. Earlier this week,
she and fraternity members said the
house probably will miss its 1980 rush
quota.
Problems with spring rush
But because of the problems Theta
Xi encountered with rush pledges
last spring, Conklin indicated the
house wouldn't be placed in the Uni
versity housing draw during spring
1981.
"But they (Theta Xi) will have to
make their quota this spring or they

will face the possibility of going into
the University housing system in au
tumn quarter 1981," she said.
"We're not trying to put the house
in the draw," Conklin said. "But
when a fraternity house can't meet its
housing obligation, we have to ques
tion whether the house is being used
to its best advantage in the housing
system," she added.
Quota missed
The incident Theta "Xi members
said prevented the fraternity from
achieving this year's pledge quota
occurred during last spring's rush
when about 20 Donner freshmen
said they would pledge to the frater
nity as a group.
According to Tom Hempel, Theta

Xi rush chairman, the Donner group
gave Theta Xi a "for sure" list, nam
ing the persons who would "defi
nitely" pledge to the fraternity if they
received pledge bids. "Then we
made an oral bargain that we would
give them the bids," Hempel said.
Theta Xi was taking a big chance in
issuing so many bids to one group
because that precluded their issuing
bids to several other prospective
pledges, Hempel noted. But, he said,
the fraternity was convinced that
"they (the Donner group) wouldn't
back down on us at the last minute."
The "for sure" persons reneged,
however.
Hempel said the fraternity re-
ceived "warning signs" of trouble
when some members of the Donner
group said they would pledge "only
if" the entire group pledged.
Nevertheless, in the first week of
May, Theta Xi issued the bids and
held its first pledge party.
Virtually all of the Donner group
came to the party, Hempel said.
About 10 of the Donnerites signed
fraternity housingcards, thusaccept
ing their bids, Hempel said. The
other half of the group didn't sign,
saying they wanted to "think about
it, he said. "Then the whole group
began vacillating," he added.
One Donner pledge
By the end of May, Hempel
explained, only one of the Donner
frosh had pledged fully to Theta Xi.
There were three other pledges. The
total of four pledges still left the
fraternity far short of its required
quota and with little time left in the
school year to recruit pledges.
Sophomore Howard Gebb, the
only pledging member of the Don
ner group, corroborated what Hem
pel told the Daily. He added: "The
guys who were doing this just we
ren't sure they wanted to join. It
came down to 10 people who wanted
to join, but only if the others would
join."
Since the Donner "deal" fell
through last May, Theta Xi has found
nine additional pledges, making a
total of 13 new pledges. But because
the nine pledged after the second
round of last spring's University
housing draw, Theta Xi failed to meet
its quota.
Highest membership
There are now 33 members in
Theta Xi — the highest number
"since the mid '605," according to
Hempel. Although the house is de
signed for 27 occupants, 30 persons
are now living in it."The house is as
packed as you can make it," Hempel

said.
The apparent contradiction bet
ween the missed pledge quota and
the surplus of people stems from in
tricacies of Stanford's housing draw
regulations.
Briefly:
Theta Xi had "11 points" to make in
the 1980 fraternity rush. "One point"
is equivalent to a student with two
more years of guaranteed on
campus housing. For example, one
who rushed any Stanford fraternity in
the spring of his sophomore year —
with only one of his next two guaran
teed on-campus housing years re
maining — would be worth a half
point.
Insistent rules
University rules insist that by the
deadline of entering round two, a
student must use any guaranteed
years in the draw, transfer them to
the fraternity system, or relinquish
the guarantee.
Thus, the nine Theta Xi pledges
who pledged after the s-econd round,
lost some or all of their guaranteed
status. And this meant a loss for
Theta Xi in making its required
pledge "point" total.
Assistant Row Director Michael
Jackson said he consulted with Theta
Xi members on next spring's draw.
He praised theirattitude, saying he is
"very, very optimistic" that the
house will make its quota next
spring.
Theta Xi is one of two Stanford
fraternities that own its house — the
other is Sigma Chi. The University
owns the two 112 rats' land as well as the
land of all other campus fraternities.
All fraternities are subject to Univer
sity rules, whether they own their
houses or not, Jackson said.
