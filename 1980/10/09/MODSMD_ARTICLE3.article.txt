# 20 former Donnerites fleece frat
## Rush results imperil Theta Xi 
### David Frank 
The Theta Xi fraternity faces possi
ble withdrawal from the University
fraternity system because it failed to
meet required pledge quotas in re
cent rushes, according to Diana
Conklin, director of the Row, frater
nities and special priority houses.
Theta Xi members claim they mis
sed their 1980 pledge quota because
the frat was fleeced by a large group
of freshmen last spring. They claim
the group agreed to pledge and then
changed its mind at the last minute.
Surprisingly, this year the frater
nity boasts its largest membership in
two decades.
Under University housing regula
tions, a fraternity that fails to pledge
its required share for three out of
four consecutive years may be with
drawn from the fraternity system and
placed in the University housing
draw system.
According to Conklin, Theta Xi
failed to meet its quotas in the 1977
and 1978 rushes. Earlier this week,
she and fraternity members said the
house probably will miss its 1980 rush
quota.
Problems with spring rush
But because of the problems Theta
Xi encountered with rush pledges
last spring, Conklin indicated the
house wouldn't be placed in the Uni
versity housing draw during spring
1981.
"But they (Theta Xi) will have to
make their quota this spring or they

will face the possibility of going into
the University housing system in au
tumn quarter 1981," she said.
"We're not trying to put the house
in the draw," Conklin said. "But
when a fraternity house can't meet its
housing obligation, we have to ques
tion whether the house is being used
to its best advantage in the housing
system," she added.
Quota missed
The incident Theta "Xi members
said prevented the fraternity from
achieving this year's pledge quota
occurred during last spring's rush
when about 20 Donner freshmen
said they would pledge to the frater
nity as a group.
According to Tom Hempel, Theta

Xi rush chairman, the Donner group
gave Theta Xi a "for sure" list, nam
ing the persons who would "defi
nitely" pledge to the fraternity if they
received pledge bids. "Then we
made an oral bargain that we would
give them the bids," Hempel said.
Theta Xi was taking a big chance in
issuing so many bids to one group
because that precluded their issuing
bids to several other prospective
pledges, Hempel noted. But, he said,
the fraternity was convinced that
"they (the Donner group) wouldn't
back down on us at the last minute."
The "for sure" persons reneged,
however.
Hempel said the fraternity re-
