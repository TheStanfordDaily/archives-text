# Electric Bread and Roses: more power, less warmth
## 
### Tom Casciato 
Something's been lost. What used to be
known as the Bread and Roses Festival of
Acoustic Music took place last weekend at
Berkeley's Greek Theatre under the title
Bread and Roses Festival of Music. No
acoustic.
Each of the three preceding festivals had
been a unique event. Traditionally, artists
were limited to using non-electric instru
ments in their performances: guitars,
pianos, violins, mandolins, dobros, up
right basses, horns, etc. An acoustic festi
val provided an atmosphere of challenge
and risk, as performers were forced to sing
with softer, less complicated, accompani
ment. Vocals had to be excellent; if a
singer was flat, everyone knew.
Along with risk came an air of spon
taneity. Stars and non-stars played to
gether in pick-up bands. Audiences got to
hear unusual versions of songs. Set
changes were quick because there were no
amps or drum sets to move. Everyone was
loose, the setting was intimate, and each
act seemed like an extraordinary occasion.
But this year Bread and Roses went elec

tric and Friday night's show, at least, was a
major disappointment.
Rather than extraordinary, each of the
early acts seemed nothing more than a
warm-up for the headliner, Neil Young.
Passanger, a nondescript fusion band,
opened with some nondescript fusion
music, then converted to a nondescript a
capella choir to back up Jennifer Warnes,
then to a nondescript rock band to back up
Leonard Cohen. Cohen played but two
songs before leaving the stage, the second
of which was an acoustic solo. This got an
enthusiastic audience response, but rather
than continue on acoustic guitar, he en
cored with an ironic, '50s-style rock song
about wantingto see some woman's naked
body.
Next came a second rate country band
featuring sagging background vocals and
colorless solos. It was led by Bobby Bare,
who sang (with no trace of irony) about
whiskey, TV, quaaludes, pizza, Bo Derek,
that old red wine, and how fun it was to be
drunk and crazy. What a witty guy.
Kris Kristofferson and band followed
with a pleasant but uninspired set of coun

try ballads, and even Kristofterson seemed
to recognize that it was Young's evening,
entreating the audience as he left to "Keep
it warm for Neil Young."
Young was tremendous, but for only 40
minutes. Though this is standard length for
a Bread and Roses set, it seemed particu
larly short because 1) J.D. Souther, one of
the scheduled acts, had canceled; 2)
Young's performance was preceded by a
40-minute set change and 3) this wasn't
standard Bread and Roses.
Nonetheless, Young and his Hawks and
Doves band provided the only real excite
ment of the evening. Dropping his Rust
Never Sleeps I'm-just-a-slave-to-rock
and-roll persona in favor of this American
Stars and Bars I m-just-a-good-old-boy per
sona, he came out pounding the piano on
"Are You Ready for the Country" and fol
lowed with a series of new country songs
flavored with steel guitar and fiddle.
He closed with upbeat versions of
"Homegrown," "Four Strong Winds" and
a reprise of "Are You Ready for the Coun
try" because, as Young put it, "We don't
know many songs."

Of course as everyone knows, Neil
Young knows a hell of a lot of songs. But,
he chose to play only with his band. Ac
cording to Bread and Roses director Mimi
Farina, Young had planned to play acoustic
until his manager heard that electric in
struments were to be allowed at the Festi
val this year.-
Why did the festival go electric? In an
interview last week, Farina blamed the
economy. She said that many artists asked
to participate felt they simply couldn't af
ford to do benefits, and others, whom she
didn't name, said they would play only if
they could bring their bands. Farina said,
"In America you just can't get away with
guitar and voice anymore. People want to
go out on the road sounding like their al
bums." She said that musicians and mana
gers today are afraid that if concerts don't
sound like albums, the albums won't sell.
Farina herself didn't want to allow elec
tric music, because she feared Bread and
Roses would lose its unique quality.
But Farina's main interest was in raising
money for the organization, which pro

vides free live entertainment in hospitals,
prisons and other institutions in Marin
County. Atter three cancellation meetings,
it was decided that "the only way we could
make it work was to allow (electric)
bands."
There's certainly nothing wrong with
electric music. Nor is there anything wrong
with performers getting some promotional
benefit while donating their time. Furth
ermore, Bobby Bare would have been just
as obnoxious with an acoustic guitar, and
Neil Young may have been less exuberant.
But even though it may be unfair to
blame what was essentially a mediocre
concert on the introduction of electric in
struments, it must be said that the fresh
ness, the warmth, the intimacy that the
acoustic format virtually ensured, were
missing.
Admittedly, this is a review of a single
show, only one third of the weekend festi
val. But opening night made the Bread and
Roses benefit seem like any other country
or rock festival in the country. Fortunately,
the money was raised. But something's
been lost.

County. Atter three cancellation meetings,
it was decided that "the only way we could
make it work was to allow (electric)
bands."
There's certainly nothing wrong with
electric music. Nor is there anything wrong
with performers getting some promotional
benefit while donating their time. Furth
ermore, Bobby Bare would have been just
as obnoxious with an acoustic guitar, and
Neil Young may have been less exuberant.
But even though it may be unfair to
blame what was essentially a mediocre
concert on the introduction of electric in
struments, it must be said that the fresh
ness, the warmth, the intimacy that the
acoustic format virtually ensured, were
missing.
Admittedly, this is a review of a single
show, only one third of the weekend festi
val. But opening night made the Bread and
Roses benefit seem like any other country
or rock festival in the country. Fortunately,
the money was raised. But something's
been lost.
Something's been lost. What used to be
known as the Bread and Roses Festival of
Acoustic Music took place last weekend at
Berkeley's Greek Theatre under the title
Bread and Roses Festival of Music. No
acoustic.
Each of the three preceding festivals had
been a unique event. Traditionally, artists
were limited to using non-electric instru
ments in their performances: guitars,
pianos, violins, mandolins, dobros, up
right basses, horns, etc. An acoustic festi
val provided an atmosphere of challenge
and risk, as performers were forced to sing
with softer, less complicated, accompani
ment. Vocals had to be excellent; if a
singer was flat, everyone knew.
Along with risk came an air of spon
taneity. Stars and non-stars played to
gether in pick-up bands. Audiences got to
hear unusual versions of songs. Set
changes were quick because there were no
amps or drum sets to move. Everyone was
loose, the setting was intimate, and each
act seemed like an extraordinary occasion.
But this year Bread and Roses went elec

tric and Friday night's show, at least, was a
major disappointment.
Rather than extraordinary, each of the
early acts seemed nothing more than a
warm-up for the headliner, Neil Young.
Passanger, a nondescript fusion band,
opened with some nondescript fusion
music, then converted to a nondescript a
capella choir to back up Jennifer Warnes,
then to a nondescript rock band to back up
Leonard Cohen. Cohen played but two
songs before leaving the stage, the second
of which was an acoustic solo. This got an
enthusiastic audience response, but rather
than continue on acoustic guitar, he en
cored with an ironic, '50s-style rock song
about wantingto see some woman's naked
body.
Next came a second rate country band
featuring sagging background vocals and
colorless solos. It was led by Bobby Bare,
who sang (with no trace of irony) about
whiskey, TV, quaaludes, pizza, Bo Derek,
that old red wine, and how fun it was to be
drunk and crazy. What a witty guy.
Kris Kristofferson and band followed
with a pleasant but uninspired set of coun

try ballads, and even Kristofterson seemed
to recognize that it was Young's evening,
entreating the audience as he left to "Keep
it warm for Neil Young."
Young was tremendous, but for only 40
minutes. Though this is standard length for
a Bread and Roses set, it seemed particu
larly short because 1) J.D. Souther, one of
the scheduled acts, had canceled; 2)
Young's performance was preceded by a
40-minute set change and 3) this wasn't
standard Bread and Roses.
Nonetheless, Young and his Hawks and
Doves band provided the only real excite
ment of the evening. Dropping his Rust
Never Sleeps I'm-just-a-slave-to-rock
and-roll persona in favor of this American
Stars and Bars I m-just-a-good-old-boy per
sona, he came out pounding the piano on
"Are You Ready for the Country" and fol
lowed with a series of new country songs
flavored with steel guitar and fiddle.
He closed with upbeat versions of
"Homegrown," "Four Strong Winds" and
a reprise of "Are You Ready for the Coun
try" because, as Young put it, "We don't
know many songs."

Of course as everyone knows, Neil
Young knows a hell of a lot of songs. But,
he chose to play only with his band. Ac
cording to Bread and Roses director Mimi
Farina, Young had planned to play acoustic
until his manager heard that electric in
struments were to be allowed at the Festi
val this year.-
Why did the festival go electric? In an
interview last week, Farina blamed the
economy. She said that many artists asked
to participate felt they simply couldn't af
ford to do benefits, and others, whom she
didn't name, said they would play only if
they could bring their bands. Farina said,
"In America you just can't get away with
guitar and voice anymore. People want to
go out on the road sounding like their al
bums." She said that musicians and mana
gers today are afraid that if concerts don't
sound like albums, the albums won't sell.
Farina herself didn't want to allow elec
tric music, because she feared Bread and
Roses would lose its unique quality.
But Farina's main interest was in raising
money for the organization, which pro

vides free live entertainment in hospitals,
prisons and other institutions in Marin
County. Atter three cancellation meetings,
it was decided that "the only way we could
make it work was to allow (electric)
