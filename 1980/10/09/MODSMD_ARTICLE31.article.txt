# Duvall lovable as ever
## 
### Mindy Mayer 
The pre'ude to The Great Santini goes some
thing like this: Colonel Bull Meecham, a
fighter-pilot about to leave Spain, stows an
opened can of mushroom soup in his marine
jacket, stumbles drunkenly into a formal Navy
dinner party, and then "throws up," emptying
the soup can onto the feet of a string quartet.
"Chow down on me!" he yells across the re
staurant to his marine buddies.They rush up
eagerly with spoons in their hands, and, much
to the horror of the Navy dignitaries, proceed to
lap up the white soup.
Yup. Robert Duvall is back, playing a fanatical
military leader again — this time a peace-time
Marine whose crazy antics and pig-headedness
run his career and his family into the ground.
He's a bully, an alcoholic, and a baby, and he
treats his wife and four kids like troops, looking
over their heads instead of at their needs. But
he's also irresistible, and pathetic — and an
incredibly good actor.
The setting is Beaufort, North Carolina, an
ugly military town with ugly racial prejudices.
The time is 1962 — an indisputable 1962, lovingly
recreated with crew cuts, prom queens, pimply
high school trumpet players, and a deep con
cern over Cuba. There is even a gasoline sign
swinging in the breeze, whose price — 39 cents
— elicited groans from the audience.
The situation is this: Bull Meecham, alias "The
Great Santini," has just returned from Spain. He
is in disfavor, due to the mushroom soup scene,
but he's been given a new command post any
how, because he's "the best damn fighter-pl Tot
in the business." His mission is to move his wife
Lillian (Blythe Danner) and his four children to
Beaufort, andthere to recoversome kind of fam
ily life.
He is greeted at the airport by an adoring and
almost worshipful family. He, in turn, treats
them the only way he knows how: like a squad
ron, jokingly calling them "hogs" and
"sportstans," and generally training them for the
Big Fight, life. "As of 15:30, there will be no more
bellyaching," he announces to his lined-up kids
after they complain about Beaufort. "Meechams
are tough. They can chew nails while other kids
suck. . ." he looks at the row of

innocents. . ."cotton-candy. Dismissed!"
What makes this particular stop on the
Meecham military circuit different is that Bull's
son Ben has grown up since he last saw him.
Played by Michael O'Conner, Ben is the most
engaging gee-whiz kid to hit the movies in years
— he actually makes innocence look like fun,
and you can't help liking him for it. You also
can't help sympathizing with him when he de
cides to challenge his father's egotistical bully
ing of his mother and sibings. What follows is a
battle between an aging father and his son —
sound familiar? — in the midst of racial turbu
lence.
And it's the racial turbulence where The Great
Santini finally falls down. I thought the days of
fat and cheerful Mammies, Porgy and Bess, and
stereotyped Poor White Trash were over. But
they've all been resurrected here.
Arabella, the Meecham's maid, is the epitome
of Mammy-dom. Her son, Toomer, is a dead
ringer for Porgy— he ridesaround inamulecart
all day, singing, selling flowers and honey, and
being taunted for his stuttering by the local Poor
White Trash. Characters like that can't last for
long, because they make everyone else look too
petty. And sure enough, when Arabella com
ments to Mrs. Meecham that "Seems like chil
lun' are the only perfect people in this worl',"
Toomer's fate is sealed — he's going to become
the first victim of racial prejudice — Hol
lywood's racial prejudice.
The only other bothersome thing about The
Great Santini is the ending. As the movie shifts
towards a bittersweet ending, the camera moves
slower and slower and slower, until you think
you're either going to be trapped in Beaufort
forever, or, worse yet, caught sobbing at cel
luloid when the lights come up. It's manipula
tive. The Taps scene was especially awful — I
distinctly heard sniffles to my left and right, and
throughout the theater a near avalanche of
Kleenex rustlings. Obviously, "Love means
never having to say. .
Despite all that, The Great Santini is still a
lovable movie, sometimes very funny and
touching, and always well acted. SO CO SEE IT,
HOGS! Dismissed.


Having escaped from the circus where he was exhibited as a sideshow freak, John Hurt arrives at
London's Liverpool Street Station in The Elephant Man.

they've all been resurrected here.
Arabella, the Meecham's maid, is the epitome
of Mammy-dom. Her son, Toomer, is a dead
ringer for Porgy— he ridesaround inamulecart
all day, singing, selling flowers and honey, and
being taunted for his stuttering by the local Poor
White Trash. Characters like that can't last for
long, because they make everyone else look too
petty. And sure enough, when Arabella com
ments to Mrs. Meecham that "Seems like chil
lun' are the only perfect people in this worl',"
Toomer's fate is sealed — he's going to become
the first victim of racial prejudice — Hol
lywood's racial prejudice.
The only other bothersome thing about The
Great Santini is the ending. As the movie shifts
towards a bittersweet ending, the camera moves
slower and slower and slower, until you think
you're either going to be trapped in Beaufort
forever, or, worse yet, caught sobbing at cel
luloid when the lights come up. It's manipula
tive. The Taps scene was especially awful — I
distinctly heard sniffles to my left and right, and
throughout the theater a near avalanche of
Kleenex rustlings. Obviously, "Love means
never having to say. .
Despite all that, The Great Santini is still a
lovable movie, sometimes very funny and
touching, and always well acted. SO CO SEE IT,
HOGS! Dismissed.


Having escaped from the circus where he was exhibited as a sideshow freak, John Hurt arrives at
London's Liverpool Street Station in The Elephant Man.
The pre'ude to The Great Santini goes some
thing like this: Colonel Bull Meecham, a
fighter-pilot about to leave Spain, stows an
opened can of mushroom soup in his marine
jacket, stumbles drunkenly into a formal Navy
dinner party, and then "throws up," emptying
the soup can onto the feet of a string quartet.
"Chow down on me!" he yells across the re
staurant to his marine buddies.They rush up
eagerly with spoons in their hands, and, much
to the horror of the Navy dignitaries, proceed to
lap up the white soup.
Yup. Robert Duvall is back, playing a fanatical
military leader again — this time a peace-time
Marine whose crazy antics and pig-headedness
run his career and his family into the ground.
He's a bully, an alcoholic, and a baby, and he
treats his wife and four kids like troops, looking
over their heads instead of at their needs. But
he's also irresistible, and pathetic — and an
incredibly good actor.
The setting is Beaufort, North Carolina, an
ugly military town with ugly racial prejudices.
The time is 1962 — an indisputable 1962, lovingly
recreated with crew cuts, prom queens, pimply
high school trumpet players, and a deep con
cern over Cuba. There is even a gasoline sign
swinging in the breeze, whose price — 39 cents
— elicited groans from the audience.
The situation is this: Bull Meecham, alias "The
Great Santini," has just returned from Spain. He
is in disfavor, due to the mushroom soup scene,
but he's been given a new command post any
how, because he's "the best damn fighter-pl Tot
in the business." His mission is to move his wife
Lillian (Blythe Danner) and his four children to
Beaufort, andthere to recoversome kind of fam
ily life.
He is greeted at the airport by an adoring and
almost worshipful family. He, in turn, treats
them the only way he knows how: like a squad
ron, jokingly calling them "hogs" and
"sportstans," and generally training them for the
Big Fight, life. "As of 15:30, there will be no more
bellyaching," he announces to his lined-up kids
after they complain about Beaufort. "Meechams
are tough. They can chew nails while other kids
suck. . ." he looks at the row of

innocents. . ."cotton-candy. Dismissed!"
What makes this particular stop on the
Meecham military circuit different is that Bull's
son Ben has grown up since he last saw him.
Played by Michael O'Conner, Ben is the most
engaging gee-whiz kid to hit the movies in years
— he actually makes innocence look like fun,
and you can't help liking him for it. You also
can't help sympathizing with him when he de
cides to challenge his father's egotistical bully
ing of his mother and sibings. What follows is a
battle between an aging father and his son —
sound familiar? — in the midst of racial turbu
lence.
And it's the racial turbulence where The Great
Santini finally falls down. I thought the days of
fat and cheerful Mammies, Porgy and Bess, and
stereotyped Poor White Trash were over. But
they've all been resurrected here.
