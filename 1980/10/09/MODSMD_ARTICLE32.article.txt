# A 						special person, special film

### Tom Taylor 
. A moving and thoroughly engaging film,
The Elephant Man, opened Friday at the
Royal Theater in San Franc isco. It is a love*
story, demonstrating that human ( ompas
sion can overcome man's fear ot the un
known and grotesque. The film further
r'*s the dignity of a man possessed of
jjjliness as to prompt authorities to
close the very freak show in which he must
appear to earn a livelihood.
in Victorian Fn -land, the movie
chronicles the true story ot John Merrick, a
man so hideously deformed he is con
demned to life in a freak show as "The
Elephant Man." Condemned, that is, until
a brilliant surgeon, Frederick Treves, bor
rows Merrick from his "owner" to study
the deformities.
Soon Treves is exhibiting Merrick to
the Royal College of Surgeons. Has the
Elephant Man's situation improved or is he
now merely a freak in a somewhat nobler
sideshow?
Treves assumes that Merrick is an imbe
cile, incapable of speech or rational
thought. He admits him to London Hospi
tal and identifies an incurable disease as
the cause of Merrick's disfigurement.
About to return Merrick to his owner,
Bytes, Treves discovers that Merrick can
indeed talk.
Treves' interest shifts from the medical
to the realm of genuine compassion.
Though he can't cure the Elephant Man,
the doctor will care for him. As it turns out,
Merrick is a rather charming fellow, and

soon it is the rage of London society to
have taken tea in his hospital room.
Bytes learns the { urrent whereabouts of
the former source of his livelihood from
the society pages of the London Times. FHe
kidnaps Merric kin the night and takes him
to Belgium. Once again, Merric k is touted
as L homme elephant. So badly treated is
he that other freaks in the show collect
money for his train fare and assist in Mer
rick's escape back to London. What trans
pires thereafter will have to wait until you
see the movie.
Several things combine to make this a
very special film. )ohn Hurt is absolutely
believable in the role of The Elephant Man.
The minute he opens his mouth he en
dears himself to his listeners. One knows
him and begins to care for him im
mediately. This lends credibility to the
seemingly absurd attention focused upon
him by London's upper crust. It charac
terises the dignity with which he is able to
comport himsell in spite of his overwhelm
ing grotesqueness.
David Lynch proves to be a masterful
director in his first major motion picture.
His only previous film was Eraserhead,
which he wrote, directed, and produced.
Lynch avoids many temptations a lesser
director would not have resisted. FHe re
fuses to use Merrick's deformities for
shock value. To that effect, and for
heightened drama, the film was shot in
black and white. He also resists develop
ing characters along single dimensions,
preferring to explore the ambiguity of

hum,in motives. He employs humor with
perfect timing, avoiding the abuse of
comic relief.
Lynch makes a very powerful statement
with this tilm. Vet he does so subtly, so that
one is not aware one is watching a "mes
sage" film.
Antho v Hopkins plays the demanding
role Oi t reves, who at one e hopes to save
the Elephant Man trom exploitation by his
"owner," and yet recognizes that he, too,
may be using Merric k to advance his own
career.
Anne Bancrott, Sir John Gielgud, and
Dame Wendy Hiller c ontribute a great deal
to the tilm in their supporting roles.
To be sure, the lilm has some minor
flaws. There are some awkward montage
sequences at the beginning and end of the
film where we are led to believe that Mer
rick's mother was struck down and/or
raped by an elephant in the fourth month
ot her pregnancy. And there is no explana
tion of how Merric k emerges trom all his
years ot maltreatment under Bytes, psyche
unscathed, to beeome the c harming toast
of the town that he does. However, such
flaws detract little trom the otherwise ex
cellent production.
At the climax ot the movie, the Elephant
Man cries to a frightened and hostile
crowd surrounding him: "I am not an
animal! I am a human being!" Lest there
be any uncertain (and hostile?) readers of
this review, let me state that The Elephant
Man is not a horror tilm! It is a very, very
good story ot love and human dignity.

Anne Bancrott, Sir John Gielgud, and
Dame Wendy Hiller c ontribute a great deal
to the tilm in their supporting roles.
To be sure, the lilm has some minor
flaws. There are some awkward montage
sequences at the beginning and end of the
film where we are led to believe that Mer
rick's mother was struck down and/or
raped by an elephant in the fourth month
ot her pregnancy. And there is no explana
tion of how Merric k emerges trom all his
years ot maltreatment under Bytes, psyche
unscathed, to beeome the c harming toast
of the town that he does. However, such
flaws detract little trom the otherwise ex
cellent production.
At the climax ot the movie, the Elephant
Man cries to a frightened and hostile
crowd surrounding him: "I am not an
animal! I am a human being!" Lest there
be any uncertain (and hostile?) readers of
this review, let me state that The Elephant
Man is not a horror tilm! It is a very, very
good story ot love and human dignity.


Francesco Trio guest
Violinist Paul Hersh joins the Francesco Trio — violinist David
Abel, cellist Bonnie Hampton, and pianist Nathan Schwartz — in
the first of the Trio's "Three Times Brahms" chamber music series

at 8 p.m. Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, presented by the
Department of Music.
. A moving and thoroughly engaging film,
The Elephant Man, opened Friday at the
Royal Theater in San Franc isco. It is a love*
story, demonstrating that human ( ompas
sion can overcome man's fear ot the un
known and grotesque. The film further
r'*s the dignity of a man possessed of
jjjliness as to prompt authorities to
close the very freak show in which he must
appear to earn a livelihood.
in Victorian Fn -land, the movie
chronicles the true story ot John Merrick, a
man so hideously deformed he is con
demned to life in a freak show as "The
Elephant Man." Condemned, that is, until
a brilliant surgeon, Frederick Treves, bor
rows Merrick from his "owner" to study
the deformities.
Soon Treves is exhibiting Merrick to
the Royal College of Surgeons. Has the
Elephant Man's situation improved or is he
now merely a freak in a somewhat nobler
sideshow?
Treves assumes that Merrick is an imbe
cile, incapable of speech or rational
thought. He admits him to London Hospi
tal and identifies an incurable disease as
the cause of Merrick's disfigurement.
About to return Merrick to his owner,
Bytes, Treves discovers that Merrick can
indeed talk.
Treves' interest shifts from the medical
to the realm of genuine compassion.
Though he can't cure the Elephant Man,
the doctor will care for him. As it turns out,
Merrick is a rather charming fellow, and

soon it is the rage of London society to
have taken tea in his hospital room.
Bytes learns the { urrent whereabouts of
the former source of his livelihood from
the society pages of the London Times. FHe
kidnaps Merric kin the night and takes him
to Belgium. Once again, Merric k is touted
as L homme elephant. So badly treated is
he that other freaks in the show collect
money for his train fare and assist in Mer
rick's escape back to London. What trans
pires thereafter will have to wait until you
see the movie.
Several things combine to make this a
very special film. )ohn Hurt is absolutely
believable in the role of The Elephant Man.
The minute he opens his mouth he en
dears himself to his listeners. One knows
him and begins to care for him im
mediately. This lends credibility to the
seemingly absurd attention focused upon
him by London's upper crust. It charac
terises the dignity with which he is able to
comport himsell in spite of his overwhelm
ing grotesqueness.
David Lynch proves to be a masterful
director in his first major motion picture.
His only previous film was Eraserhead,
which he wrote, directed, and produced.
Lynch avoids many temptations a lesser
director would not have resisted. FHe re
fuses to use Merrick's deformities for
shock value. To that effect, and for
heightened drama, the film was shot in
black and white. He also resists develop
ing characters along single dimensions,
preferring to explore the ambiguity of

hum,in motives. He employs humor with
perfect timing, avoiding the abuse of
comic relief.
Lynch makes a very powerful statement
with this tilm. Vet he does so subtly, so that
one is not aware one is watching a "mes
sage" film.
Antho v Hopkins plays the demanding
role Oi t reves, who at one e hopes to save
the Elephant Man trom exploitation by his
"owner," and yet recognizes that he, too,
may be using Merric k to advance his own
career.
