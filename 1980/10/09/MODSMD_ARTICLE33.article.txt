# Woody Allen at the turning point
## 
### Jim Mattson 
In interviews he gave after the premiere of
Manhattan, Woody Allen maintained that his
next film would be a comedy without jokes.
There are jokes in Stardust Memories — some
great ones — but Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust Memories is a
drama without a storyline. It is also the year's
best movie.
With Stardust Memories, Allen reevaluates
the films that have come before. The film's start
ing point is a festival of the films of Sandy Bates,
a director who, like Allen, has been producing
increasingly disturbing comedies.
Seeing as this is a film about the past — Allen's
past — some history may be in order. Allen's
earliest films, like Bananas and Take the Money
and Run rejected a linear narrative in favor of
stream-ot-i onsciousness compilations of
blackout sketches.
Starting with Sleeper and moving through In
teriors and Manhattan, the jokes became more
and more subservient to the storyline. Interiors
had no jokes at all, unless you want to include
the film's witty, almost subliminal use of color to
underline characters' moods. Manhattan
reinstated some of the humor while expressing
a \ ision of lite even darker than the one found in
Interiors.
As the storylines became stronger, the explo
ration ot themes became more striking. The
stick-figures of Love and Death became the lov
ers in Annie Hall: the cloned nose of Sleeper
became Manhattan's dachshund-as-metaphor.
Manhattan was as stunning for its sense of a
society-wide breakdown in communication as
for its sense of humor.
Stardust Memories retains this gloomy vision
of human relationships. Sandy Bates sees a
world populated by grotesques: Stardust
Memories' film-within-a-film opening finds him
trapped in a Pullman car watching the good life
pass by on another train.
But Stardust Memories abandons (or maybe
just sets aside) Allen's recent obsession with

storyline. Its structure is closer to Take the
Money and Run than to Manhattan. It has a
dreamy, fluid form: we're never certain where
the film's reality ends and where something en
tirely different begins.
Where the later films relied increasingly heav
ily on narrative for their impact, Stardust
Memories draws on the shifting quality of mem
ory itself. Bates' memory delimits the film's uni
verse. He can summon up a scene from child
hood— himself as a child playing Superman, say
— and convert it into a movie-made image of
himself — the boy zooming up from the ground
and into the sky.
Unhappy with the world, Bates fantasizes
about ways to change it. His hostility escapes,
and stalks, gorilla-like, the people who irritate
him. A childhood disappointment about never
having received an elephant as a gift is amended
when one looms magically on the horizon.
Ultimately, the only thing Bates/Allen can
trust is the art of filmmaking itself. Stardust
Memories is a celebration of the rejuvenating
qualities of cinema. When things do not work
out in life, they can be undone and changed on
film.
It was inevitable that Allen would make the
story of himself-as-filmmaker: his gift for filmed
autobiography has long been clear. The imagery
of Stardust Memories eloquently defends Al
len's right to tell us about himself.
That the defense is so funny seems Allen's
method for driving his point home. "I especially
liked your earlier, funnier films," one character
after another tells Bates. The banality of the line
shows — as Allen must have intended — the
idiocy of demanding that an artist produce only
one type of work.
This is a turning point in Allen's filmmaking.
Stardust Memories is a return to zero in order to
begin anew. I'll be surprised if Allen ever makes
another Bananas; I'll be surprised if he ever
makes another Annie Hall.
Stardust Memories documents Allen's decla
ration of independence as a flimmaker.

trapped in a Pullman car watching the good life
pass by on another train.
But Stardust Memories abandons (or maybe
just sets aside) Allen's recent obsession with

storyline. Its structure is closer to Take the
Money and Run than to Manhattan. It has a
dreamy, fluid form: we're never certain where
the film's reality ends and where something en
tirely different begins.
Where the later films relied increasingly heav
ily on narrative for their impact, Stardust
Memories draws on the shifting quality of mem
ory itself. Bates' memory delimits the film's uni
verse. He can summon up a scene from child
hood— himself as a child playing Superman, say
— and convert it into a movie-made image of
himself — the boy zooming up from the ground
and into the sky.
Unhappy with the world, Bates fantasizes
about ways to change it. His hostility escapes,
and stalks, gorilla-like, the people who irritate
him. A childhood disappointment about never
having received an elephant as a gift is amended
when one looms magically on the horizon.
Ultimately, the only thing Bates/Allen can
trust is the art of filmmaking itself. Stardust
Memories is a celebration of the rejuvenating
qualities of cinema. When things do not work
out in life, they can be undone and changed on
film.
It was inevitable that Allen would make the
story of himself-as-filmmaker: his gift for filmed
autobiography has long been clear. The imagery
of Stardust Memories eloquently defends Al
len's right to tell us about himself.
That the defense is so funny seems Allen's
method for driving his point home. "I especially
liked your earlier, funnier films," one character
after another tells Bates. The banality of the line
shows — as Allen must have intended — the
idiocy of demanding that an artist produce only
one type of work.
This is a turning point in Allen's filmmaking.
Stardust Memories is a return to zero in order to
begin anew. I'll be surprised if Allen ever makes
another Bananas; I'll be surprised if he ever
makes another Annie Hall.
Stardust Memories documents Allen's decla
ration of independence as a flimmaker.


Woody Allen
In interviews he gave after the premiere of
Manhattan, Woody Allen maintained that his
next film would be a comedy without jokes.
There are jokes in Stardust Memories — some
great ones — but Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust Memories is a
drama without a storyline. It is also the year's
best movie.
With Stardust Memories, Allen reevaluates
the films that have come before. The film's start
ing point is a festival of the films of Sandy Bates,
a director who, like Allen, has been producing
increasingly disturbing comedies.
Seeing as this is a film about the past — Allen's
past — some history may be in order. Allen's
earliest films, like Bananas and Take the Money
and Run rejected a linear narrative in favor of
stream-ot-i onsciousness compilations of
blackout sketches.
Starting with Sleeper and moving through In
teriors and Manhattan, the jokes became more
and more subservient to the storyline. Interiors
had no jokes at all, unless you want to include
the film's witty, almost subliminal use of color to
underline characters' moods. Manhattan
reinstated some of the humor while expressing
a \ ision of lite even darker than the one found in
Interiors.
As the storylines became stronger, the explo
ration ot themes became more striking. The
stick-figures of Love and Death became the lov
ers in Annie Hall: the cloned nose of Sleeper
became Manhattan's dachshund-as-metaphor.
Manhattan was as stunning for its sense of a
society-wide breakdown in communication as
for its sense of humor.
Stardust Memories retains this gloomy vision
of human relationships. Sandy Bates sees a
world populated by grotesques: Stardust
Memories' film-within-a-film opening finds him
trapped in a Pullman car watching the good life
pass by on another train.
But Stardust Memories abandons (or maybe
just sets aside) Allen's recent obsession with
