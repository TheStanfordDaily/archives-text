# Committee calls for Special Events' end
## 
### Peter Finch 
The ASSU Special Events program
came one step closer to a total shut
down last night as the ASSU Fince
Committee voted unanimously to
recommend its permanent closure.
The Finance Committee will take
its recommendation before the
ASSU Senate next week. Plans in
clude a task force designed to
thoroughly investigate the possibility
of a new contemporary entertain
ment program here.
The committee's recommendation
is expected to pass easily.
Speaking at last night's meeting
was ASSU Financial Manager Steve
Davis who recommended the clo
sure of Special Events, calling atten
tion to last year's $92,000 net loss as a
possible detriment to other prog
rams and as a dangerous risk to
ASSU.
There is no clear-cut answer why
Special Events ran up such a deficit,
Davis explained, citing the reces
sion, lack of management con
tinuity, competition, scheduling
problems and poor planning as pos
sible explanations.
'We lost'
Only one quarter of the revenue
generation shows showed a profit
last year, according to Davis.
"How come we continued when
we were losing money?" Davis asked
rhetorically. "We had a strategy â€” in
order to make money, we thought
we needed larger acts. . . . We were
willing to wait until spring to get a

return on our investment. We took a
risk and we lost," he explained.
Former Assistant Director of Spe
cial Events Lenny Lieberman also
spoke at the meeting and argued that
closing Special Events would reduce
the possibility of starting another
similar program in the future be
cause Stanford as a whole would suf
fer a loss of credibility.
"To close it officially now will hurt
somewhere down the line," Lieber
man said. "Until after the evaluation
is finished and we realize that we
don't want it, we should keep it
open."
No trust
"If you are a new name, they (ar
tists) will say 'you're new, why
should we trust you?' " he said.
Council of Presidents member
Dick Buttertieid argued that the im
plications of the program's closure
have already been felt in the com
munity.
The only reason to keep Special
Events open, he explained, would be
to have a staff and put on some
shows. ' But we have no money, so
we're closed."
New and lasting
"People will have more confi
dence in a student body that has ac
tively taken interest in trying to revise
(its contemporary entertainment
program) and in doing that came up
with something that would be new
and lasting," remarked committee
Chairman Carv Reiff, summing ud
the feelings of most committee
members.
By closing the Special Events prog
ram, Reift' continued, the task force
will be able to work with a "blank
slate." If they decide that a new prog
ram is feasible, they will give it a new
name and an entirely new set of by
laws, he said.
The task force, officially titled the
Student Task Force on Contempor
ary Campus Entertainment, will be
comprised of two ASSU Senators, a
COP member, a student-at-large and
representatives from the Dean of
Student Affairs Office and Student
Arts at Stanford (STARTS).
They will meet for the first time on
Monday and will make their final re
port to the senate in December.
