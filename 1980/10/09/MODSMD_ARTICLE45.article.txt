Iraq reports gains, shelves summit
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq claimed fresh victories
against the Iranians yesterday, while Tehran said
that it was mounting a large counteroffensive de
signed to recapture its lost territory in the Persian
Gulf war.
An offficial communique issued in Baghdad said
that Iraqi forces had shot down 10 Iranian helicop
ters, knocked out nine tanks and killed 40 Iranian
soldiers in the day's fighting.
Iraqi tanks were reportedly moving south to
ward Basra to reinforce the Baghdad forces fight
ing for control of the Shatt al Arab waterway bet
ween the two countries.
The Baghdad high command admitted that
seven of its own soldiers were killed, 49wounded,
three tanks destroyed and two MiGs lost to Iranian
jets.
At the same time, the Iraqi government an
nounced that the scheduled summit meeting of
the Organization ot Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries, scheduled to be held in Baghdad next
month, would be indefinitely postponed.
For the first time, the ruler of Kuwait issued an
urgent appeal tor the two warring neighbors at the
head of the Persian Gulf toend their hostilities and
begin negotiating a peace settlement.
U.S. offers gulf surveillance data
Washington — The United States has offered to
provide surveillance information to friendly coun
tries in the Persian Gulf region to lessen the threat
of air attacks resulting trom the war between Iraq
and Iran.
The State Department said yesterday the data
being made available to the neutral countries is
being gathered by four airborne radar command
planes sent to Saudi Arabia last week to protect
oilfields and other installations from any spillover
from the war.
These planes, known as AWACs, have a surveil
lance range of 250 to 350 miles and can monitor
much of the strategic Persian Gulf region from
Saudi Arabian or international airspace.
Their principal function is to spot flights of at
tack planes heading for neutral countries in the
region before they reach their targets.
It was learned that the countries involved in the
offer are Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emi
rates. Both Kuwait and the sheikdoms comprising
the UAE are major oil producers.
Behind the decision to deploy the surveillance
planes and support crews to Saudi Arabia was a
concern within the Carter administration that Iran
might launch a desperation attack against Gulf oil
fields if Iraq appears at the point of victory.
Reagan restates pollution theme
Youngstown, Ohio — Declaring that air pollution
"has been substantially controlled," Ronald
Reagan yesterday called for rewriting the Clean Air
Act, which he blamed for causing factory shut
downs and unemployment.
In a broadside attack on the environmental
movement, the Republican presidential nominee
vigorously defended an earlier suggestion he had
made that trees and other vegetation are worse
polluters than automobiles.
Reagan said he suspected that the eruption of
Mount St. Helens had released more sulfur
dioxide into the air in the past several months
"than has been released in the last 10 years of
automobile driving or things of that kind that
people are so concerned about."
"I know Teddy Kennedy had fun at the Democ
ratic Convention, when he said that I had said that
trees and vegetation cause 80 percent of the air
pollution in this country," Reagan said. "Well,

now he was a little wrong about what I said. First of
all, I didn't say 80 percent, I said 92 percent —
pardon me, 93 percent.
"And I didn't say air pollution, I said oxides of
nitrogen. And I am right. Growing and decaying
vegetation in this land are responsible for 93 per
cent of the oxides of nitrogen."
Experts at the Environmental Protection Agency
said that Reagan apparently had mixed up chemi
cal terms. "Nitrogen dioxide comes only from
man-made sources," one said. "Plants and trees
produce most of the nitrous oxide in the atmos
phere and that is harmless to mankind."
Douglas Costle, EPA administrator, said: "If he
meant to compare the volcano with power plants/
both of which do emit sultur oxides, he was still
wrong. Mount Saint Helens emits approximately
1000 tons a day. Power plants emit 40 times that
much."
Polish purge in wake of strike
Warsaw, Poland — Premier Jozet Pinkowski an
nounced yesterday that six government ministers
had been dismissed and named two new vice
premiers in Poland's second political shakeup this
week.
Pinkowski reseated the government shuffle to
the Sejm, or parliament, two days after the Com
munist Party juggled its Central Committee lead
ership. It purged nine top officials whose policies
were blamed by party spokesmen tor fostering the
summer's nationwide strike wave.
No immediate reasons were announced for the
dismissals. In August and September, Poland's
miners and steelworkers joined shipyard workers
in striking for the right to form independent trade
unions, revised censorship laws and church ac
cess to the media, among other demands.
Israel vows defense of status quo
Jerusalem — Israel issued a veiled warning yes
terday against any troop movements that would
"change the status quo" in Jordan, which sources
here said was providing massive logistical aid to
Iraq.
This country was apparently concerned that
Iraqi troops might move into Jordan under the
guise ot assisting the shipment of supplies, or that
Svria and Jordan — each taking a different side in
the Iraq-Iran war — might get involved in a con
frontation of their own.
The Israeli concern was expressed in a message
to the State Department which, presumably, the
United States would pass on to Jordan.
In 1970, when Syrian armored forces moved into
northern Jordan in a vain effort to aid Palestine
Liberation Organization forces being ousted by
Jordan, Israel made the same statement — and
followed it up by moving army units to the Israeli
occupied Golan Heights in a position threatening
the flank of the Syrian invaders.
Underattack by Jordanian tanks and aircraft, the
Syrians withdrew three days later — but most dip
lomatic sources believed that the Israeli threat
played a large role in the Syrian retreat.
There were no hints, however, as to what Israel
would do about changes in the status quo. A gov
ernment spokesman said, "we are considering the
situation as in the past," apparently a reference to
1970. "We are watching. We are opposed to the
presence of entry of foreign military forces into
Jordan, and we have made our concern known."
New house sales, prices slumping
Washington — Sales of new, one-family homes
declined by4.9percent in August, the government
reported yesterday. The drop reflected a new

round of increases in mortgage rates.
A survey bv the departments ot Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development estimated
new-home sales during the month at a seasonally
adjusted rate ot 623,000 a year. That compares with
a revised annual rate in July of 655,000 and is 16
percent below the August 1979 level of 738,000
units.
Actual sales totaled 58,000 in August, compared
with 55,000 in July. But because past records indi
cate August sales should have been considerably
more, the seasonal adjustment results in a decline.
During the first eight months of the year, the
report said, 367,000 new homes were sold, down
29 percent from the same period of 1979.
The weakness in the housing market also was
demonstrated by a decline in the median sales
price of new homes, from $64,300 in July to $63,900
in August.
A more closely watched statistic, new housing
starts, showed improvement in lune, July and Au
gust after dropping to depression levels earlier in
the year, but analysts have cautioned that another
round of rising mortgage rates could kill the hous
ing recovery. Housing-start figures for September
are to be released later this month.
Feds view suit to recoup bribes
— The justice Department is con
templating suing members of Congress convicted
in the Abscam cases to recover government bribe
money taken from undercover FBI agents.
Irvin Nathan, the deputy assistant attorney gen
eral who supervised the investigation, said yester
day the department's civil division is "actively con
sidering" suits against Rep. lohn jenrette (D-S.C.)
and former Rep. Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.).
lenrette, with a co-defendant, was convicted
Tuesday of bribery and conspiracy. Myers, con
victed on similar charges in August, was expelled
from the House of Representatives last week.
Four House members still face bribery trials in
the Abscam investigation.
Nathan said the contemplated civil suits should
not be viewed as harassment of those convicted.
"We simply want the return of the money," he
said. "In the Myers case, there's no dispute that he
and his co-defendants split $50,000. In Jenrette,
there's no dispute that co-defendant John Stowe
left the building with $50,000. Flow they divided it
up doesn't matter."
Attorneys for Jenrette and Myers said yesterday
they considered the possibility of the civil suits
"outrageous." Kenneth Robinson, Jenrette's
lawyer, said, "They gave the money away to get the
people to commit the crime." Neil lokelson of
Philadelphia, who has filed suits for Myers chal
lenging his expulsion from Congress, said he re
called Myers had said he would repay his $15,000
share of the bribe money if the trial judge ordered
it.
Royals, Astros win in playoffs
Kansas City Royals 7, New York Yankees 2. (Royals
lead the best-of-tive series 1-0.)
Houston Astros 7, Philadelphia Phillies 4, 10 in
nings. (Best-of-five series tied at 1-1.)
Dow Jones rises slightly
New York — Hopes that interest rates will not
rise any further helped the stock market move up
today even as a government report showed rising
mortgage rates have helped to slow house sales.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
3.32 to 963.99.
Advances outnumbered declines by a 4-3 mar
gin on the New York Stock Exchange.
Big Board volume totaled 46.58 million shares,
against 50.31 million in the previous session.

oilfields and other installations from any spillover
from the war.
These planes, known as AWACs, have a surveil
lance range of 250 to 350 miles and can monitor
much of the strategic Persian Gulf region from
Saudi Arabian or international airspace.
Their principal function is to spot flights of at
tack planes heading for neutral countries in the
region before they reach their targets.
It was learned that the countries involved in the
offer are Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emi
rates. Both Kuwait and the sheikdoms comprising
the UAE are major oil producers.
Behind the decision to deploy the surveillance
planes and support crews to Saudi Arabia was a
concern within the Carter administration that Iran
might launch a desperation attack against Gulf oil
fields if Iraq appears at the point of victory.
Reagan restates pollution theme
Youngstown, Ohio — Declaring that air pollution
"has been substantially controlled," Ronald
Reagan yesterday called for rewriting the Clean Air
Act, which he blamed for causing factory shut
downs and unemployment.
In a broadside attack on the environmental
movement, the Republican presidential nominee
vigorously defended an earlier suggestion he had
made that trees and other vegetation are worse
polluters than automobiles.
Reagan said he suspected that the eruption of
Mount St. Helens had released more sulfur
dioxide into the air in the past several months
"than has been released in the last 10 years of
automobile driving or things of that kind that
people are so concerned about."
"I know Teddy Kennedy had fun at the Democ
ratic Convention, when he said that I had said that
trees and vegetation cause 80 percent of the air
pollution in this country," Reagan said. "Well,

now he was a little wrong about what I said. First of
all, I didn't say 80 percent, I said 92 percent —
pardon me, 93 percent.
"And I didn't say air pollution, I said oxides of
nitrogen. And I am right. Growing and decaying
vegetation in this land are responsible for 93 per
cent of the oxides of nitrogen."
Experts at the Environmental Protection Agency
said that Reagan apparently had mixed up chemi
cal terms. "Nitrogen dioxide comes only from
man-made sources," one said. "Plants and trees
produce most of the nitrous oxide in the atmos
phere and that is harmless to mankind."
Douglas Costle, EPA administrator, said: "If he
meant to compare the volcano with power plants/
both of which do emit sultur oxides, he was still
wrong. Mount Saint Helens emits approximately
1000 tons a day. Power plants emit 40 times that
much."
Polish purge in wake of strike
Warsaw, Poland — Premier Jozet Pinkowski an
nounced yesterday that six government ministers
had been dismissed and named two new vice
premiers in Poland's second political shakeup this
week.
Pinkowski reseated the government shuffle to
the Sejm, or parliament, two days after the Com
munist Party juggled its Central Committee lead
ership. It purged nine top officials whose policies
were blamed by party spokesmen tor fostering the
summer's nationwide strike wave.
No immediate reasons were announced for the
dismissals. In August and September, Poland's
miners and steelworkers joined shipyard workers
in striking for the right to form independent trade
unions, revised censorship laws and church ac
cess to the media, among other demands.
Israel vows defense of status quo
Jerusalem — Israel issued a veiled warning yes
terday against any troop movements that would
"change the status quo" in Jordan, which sources
here said was providing massive logistical aid to
Iraq.
This country was apparently concerned that
Iraqi troops might move into Jordan under the
guise ot assisting the shipment of supplies, or that
Svria and Jordan — each taking a different side in
the Iraq-Iran war — might get involved in a con
frontation of their own.
The Israeli concern was expressed in a message
to the State Department which, presumably, the
United States would pass on to Jordan.
In 1970, when Syrian armored forces moved into
northern Jordan in a vain effort to aid Palestine
Liberation Organization forces being ousted by
Jordan, Israel made the same statement — and
followed it up by moving army units to the Israeli
occupied Golan Heights in a position threatening
the flank of the Syrian invaders.
Underattack by Jordanian tanks and aircraft, the
Syrians withdrew three days later — but most dip
lomatic sources believed that the Israeli threat
played a large role in the Syrian retreat.
There were no hints, however, as to what Israel
would do about changes in the status quo. A gov
ernment spokesman said, "we are considering the
situation as in the past," apparently a reference to
1970. "We are watching. We are opposed to the
presence of entry of foreign military forces into
Jordan, and we have made our concern known."
New house sales, prices slumping
Washington — Sales of new, one-family homes
declined by4.9percent in August, the government
reported yesterday. The drop reflected a new

round of increases in mortgage rates.
A survey bv the departments ot Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development estimated
new-home sales during the month at a seasonally
adjusted rate ot 623,000 a year. That compares with
a revised annual rate in July of 655,000 and is 16
percent below the August 1979 level of 738,000
units.
Actual sales totaled 58,000 in August, compared
with 55,000 in July. But because past records indi
cate August sales should have been considerably
more, the seasonal adjustment results in a decline.
During the first eight months of the year, the
report said, 367,000 new homes were sold, down
29 percent from the same period of 1979.
The weakness in the housing market also was
demonstrated by a decline in the median sales
price of new homes, from $64,300 in July to $63,900
in August.
A more closely watched statistic, new housing
starts, showed improvement in lune, July and Au
gust after dropping to depression levels earlier in
the year, but analysts have cautioned that another
round of rising mortgage rates could kill the hous
ing recovery. Housing-start figures for September
are to be released later this month.
Feds view suit to recoup bribes
— The justice Department is con
templating suing members of Congress convicted
in the Abscam cases to recover government bribe
money taken from undercover FBI agents.
Irvin Nathan, the deputy assistant attorney gen
eral who supervised the investigation, said yester
day the department's civil division is "actively con
sidering" suits against Rep. lohn jenrette (D-S.C.)
and former Rep. Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.).
lenrette, with a co-defendant, was convicted
Tuesday of bribery and conspiracy. Myers, con
victed on similar charges in August, was expelled
from the House of Representatives last week.
Four House members still face bribery trials in
the Abscam investigation.
Nathan said the contemplated civil suits should
not be viewed as harassment of those convicted.
"We simply want the return of the money," he
said. "In the Myers case, there's no dispute that he
and his co-defendants split $50,000. In Jenrette,
there's no dispute that co-defendant John Stowe
left the building with $50,000. Flow they divided it
up doesn't matter."
Attorneys for Jenrette and Myers said yesterday
they considered the possibility of the civil suits
"outrageous." Kenneth Robinson, Jenrette's
lawyer, said, "They gave the money away to get the
people to commit the crime." Neil lokelson of
Philadelphia, who has filed suits for Myers chal
lenging his expulsion from Congress, said he re
called Myers had said he would repay his $15,000
share of the bribe money if the trial judge ordered
it.

Iraq reports gains, shelves summit
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq claimed fresh victories
against the Iranians yesterday, while Tehran said
that it was mounting a large counteroffensive de
signed to recapture its lost territory in the Persian
Gulf war.
An offficial communique issued in Baghdad said
that Iraqi forces had shot down 10 Iranian helicop
ters, knocked out nine tanks and killed 40 Iranian
soldiers in the day's fighting.
Iraqi tanks were reportedly moving south to
ward Basra to reinforce the Baghdad forces fight
ing for control of the Shatt al Arab waterway bet
ween the two countries.
The Baghdad high command admitted that
seven of its own soldiers were killed, 49wounded,
three tanks destroyed and two MiGs lost to Iranian
jets.
At the same time, the Iraqi government an
nounced that the scheduled summit meeting of
the Organization ot Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries, scheduled to be held in Baghdad next
month, would be indefinitely postponed.
For the first time, the ruler of Kuwait issued an
urgent appeal tor the two warring neighbors at the
head of the Persian Gulf toend their hostilities and
begin negotiating a peace settlement.

now he was a little wrong about what I said. First of
all, I didn't say 80 percent, I said 92 percent —
pardon me, 93 percent.
"And I didn't say air pollution, I said oxides of
nitrogen. And I am right. Growing and decaying
vegetation in this land are responsible for 93 per
cent of the oxides of nitrogen."
Experts at the Environmental Protection Agency
said that Reagan apparently had mixed up chemi
cal terms. "Nitrogen dioxide comes only from
man-made sources," one said. "Plants and trees
produce most of the nitrous oxide in the atmos
phere and that is harmless to mankind."
Douglas Costle, EPA administrator, said: "If he
meant to compare the volcano with power plants/
both of which do emit sultur oxides, he was still
wrong. Mount Saint Helens emits approximately
1000 tons a day. Power plants emit 40 times that
much."
Polish purge in wake of strike
Warsaw, Poland — Premier Jozet Pinkowski an
nounced yesterday that six government ministers
had been dismissed and named two new vice
premiers in Poland's second political shakeup this
week.
Pinkowski reseated the government shuffle to
the Sejm, or parliament, two days after the Com
munist Party juggled its Central Committee lead
ership. It purged nine top officials whose policies
were blamed by party spokesmen tor fostering the
summer's nationwide strike wave.
No immediate reasons were announced for the
dismissals. In August and September, Poland's
miners and steelworkers joined shipyard workers
in striking for the right to form independent trade
unions, revised censorship laws and church ac
cess to the media, among other demands.
Israel vows defense of status quo
Jerusalem — Israel issued a veiled warning yes
terday against any troop movements that would
"change the status quo" in Jordan, which sources
here said was providing massive logistical aid to
Iraq.
This country was apparently concerned that
Iraqi troops might move into Jordan under the
guise ot assisting the shipment of supplies, or that
Svria and Jordan — each taking a different side in
the Iraq-Iran war — might get involved in a con
frontation of their own.
The Israeli concern was expressed in a message
to the State Department which, presumably, the
United States would pass on to Jordan.
In 1970, when Syrian armored forces moved into
northern Jordan in a vain effort to aid Palestine
Liberation Organization forces being ousted by
Jordan, Israel made the same statement — and
followed it up by moving army units to the Israeli
occupied Golan Heights in a position threatening
the flank of the Syrian invaders.
Underattack by Jordanian tanks and aircraft, the
Syrians withdrew three days later — but most dip
lomatic sources believed that the Israeli threat
played a large role in the Syrian retreat.
There were no hints, however, as to what Israel
would do about changes in the status quo. A gov
ernment spokesman said, "we are considering the
situation as in the past," apparently a reference to
1970. "We are watching. We are opposed to the
presence of entry of foreign military forces into
Jordan, and we have made our concern known."
New house sales, prices slumping
Washington — Sales of new, one-family homes
declined by4.9percent in August, the government
reported yesterday. The drop reflected a new

round of increases in mortgage rates.
A survey bv the departments ot Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development estimated
new-home sales during the month at a seasonally
adjusted rate ot 623,000 a year. That compares with
a revised annual rate in July of 655,000 and is 16
percent below the August 1979 level of 738,000
units.
Actual sales totaled 58,000 in August, compared
with 55,000 in July. But because past records indi
cate August sales should have been considerably
more, the seasonal adjustment results in a decline.
During the first eight months of the year, the
report said, 367,000 new homes were sold, down
29 percent from the same period of 1979.
The weakness in the housing market also was
demonstrated by a decline in the median sales
price of new homes, from $64,300 in July to $63,900
in August.
A more closely watched statistic, new housing
starts, showed improvement in lune, July and Au
gust after dropping to depression levels earlier in
the year, but analysts have cautioned that another
round of rising mortgage rates could kill the hous
ing recovery. Housing-start figures for September
are to be released later this month.
Feds view suit to recoup bribes
— The justice Department is con
templating suing members of Congress convicted
in the Abscam cases to recover government bribe
money taken from undercover FBI agents.
Irvin Nathan, the deputy assistant attorney gen
eral who supervised the investigation, said yester
day the department's civil division is "actively con
sidering" suits against Rep. lohn jenrette (D-S.C.)
and former Rep. Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.).
lenrette, with a co-defendant, was convicted
Tuesday of bribery and conspiracy. Myers, con
victed on similar charges in August, was expelled
from the House of Representatives last week.
Four House members still face bribery trials in
the Abscam investigation.
Nathan said the contemplated civil suits should
not be viewed as harassment of those convicted.
"We simply want the return of the money," he
said. "In the Myers case, there's no dispute that he
and his co-defendants split $50,000. In Jenrette,
there's no dispute that co-defendant John Stowe
left the building with $50,000. Flow they divided it
up doesn't matter."
Attorneys for Jenrette and Myers said yesterday
they considered the possibility of the civil suits
"outrageous." Kenneth Robinson, Jenrette's
lawyer, said, "They gave the money away to get the
people to commit the crime." Neil lokelson of
Philadelphia, who has filed suits for Myers chal
lenging his expulsion from Congress, said he re
called Myers had said he would repay his $15,000
share of the bribe money if the trial judge ordered
it.

Iraq reports gains, shelves summit
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq claimed fresh victories
against the Iranians yesterday, while Tehran said
that it was mounting a large counteroffensive de
signed to recapture its lost territory in the Persian
Gulf war.
An offficial communique issued in Baghdad said
that Iraqi forces had shot down 10 Iranian helicop
ters, knocked out nine tanks and killed 40 Iranian
soldiers in the day's fighting.
Iraqi tanks were reportedly moving south to
ward Basra to reinforce the Baghdad forces fight
ing for control of the Shatt al Arab waterway bet
ween the two countries.
The Baghdad high command admitted that
seven of its own soldiers were killed, 49wounded,
three tanks destroyed and two MiGs lost to Iranian
jets.
At the same time, the Iraqi government an
nounced that the scheduled summit meeting of
the Organization ot Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries, scheduled to be held in Baghdad next
month, would be indefinitely postponed.
For the first time, the ruler of Kuwait issued an
urgent appeal tor the two warring neighbors at the
head of the Persian Gulf toend their hostilities and
begin negotiating a peace settlement.
U.S. offers gulf surveillance data
Washington — The United States has offered to
provide surveillance information to friendly coun
tries in the Persian Gulf region to lessen the threat
of air attacks resulting trom the war between Iraq
and Iran.
The State Department said yesterday the data
being made available to the neutral countries is
being gathered by four airborne radar command
planes sent to Saudi Arabia last week to protect
oilfields and other installations from any spillover
from the war.
These planes, known as AWACs, have a surveil
lance range of 250 to 350 miles and can monitor
much of the strategic Persian Gulf region from
Saudi Arabian or international airspace.
Their principal function is to spot flights of at
tack planes heading for neutral countries in the
region before they reach their targets.
It was learned that the countries involved in the
offer are Kuwait, Oman and the United Arab Emi
rates. Both Kuwait and the sheikdoms comprising
the UAE are major oil producers.
Behind the decision to deploy the surveillance
planes and support crews to Saudi Arabia was a
concern within the Carter administration that Iran
might launch a desperation attack against Gulf oil
fields if Iraq appears at the point of victory.
Reagan restates pollution theme
Youngstown, Ohio — Declaring that air pollution
"has been substantially controlled," Ronald
Reagan yesterday called for rewriting the Clean Air
Act, which he blamed for causing factory shut
downs and unemployment.
In a broadside attack on the environmental
movement, the Republican presidential nominee
vigorously defended an earlier suggestion he had
made that trees and other vegetation are worse
polluters than automobiles.
Reagan said he suspected that the eruption of
Mount St. Helens had released more sulfur
dioxide into the air in the past several months
"than has been released in the last 10 years of
automobile driving or things of that kind that
people are so concerned about."
"I know Teddy Kennedy had fun at the Democ
ratic Convention, when he said that I had said that
trees and vegetation cause 80 percent of the air
pollution in this country," Reagan said. "Well,

now he was a little wrong about what I said. First of

Israel vows defense of status quo
Jerusalem — Israel issued a veiled warning yes
terday against any troop movements that would
"change the status quo" in Jordan, which sources
here said was providing massive logistical aid to
Iraq.
This country was apparently concerned that
Iraqi troops might move into Jordan under the
guise ot assisting the shipment of supplies, or that
Svria and Jordan — each taking a different side in
the Iraq-Iran war — might get involved in a con
frontation of their own.
The Israeli concern was expressed in a message
to the State Department which, presumably, the
United States would pass on to Jordan.
In 1970, when Syrian armored forces moved into
northern Jordan in a vain effort to aid Palestine
Liberation Organization forces being ousted by
Jordan, Israel made the same statement — and
followed it up by moving army units to the Israeli
occupied Golan Heights in a position threatening
the flank of the Syrian invaders.
Underattack by Jordanian tanks and aircraft, the
Syrians withdrew three days later — but most dip
lomatic sources believed that the Israeli threat
played a large role in the Syrian retreat.
There were no hints, however, as to what Israel
would do about changes in the status quo. A gov
ernment spokesman said, "we are considering the
situation as in the past," apparently a reference to
1970. "We are watching. We are opposed to the
presence of entry of foreign military forces into
Jordan, and we have made our concern known."
New house sales, prices slumping
Washington — Sales of new, one-family homes
declined by4.9percent in August, the government
reported yesterday. The drop reflected a new

round of increases in mortgage rates.
A survey bv the departments ot Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development estimated
new-home sales during the month at a seasonally
adjusted rate ot 623,000 a year. That compares with
a revised annual rate in July of 655,000 and is 16
percent below the August 1979 level of 738,000
units.
Actual sales totaled 58,000 in August, compared
with 55,000 in July. But because past records indi
cate August sales should have been considerably
more, the seasonal adjustment results in a decline.
During the first eight months of the year, the
report said, 367,000 new homes were sold, down
29 percent from the same period of 1979.
The weakness in the housing market also was
demonstrated by a decline in the median sales
price of new homes, from $64,300 in July to $63,900
in August.
A more closely watched statistic, new housing
starts, showed improvement in lune, July and Au
gust after dropping to depression levels earlier in
the year, but analysts have cautioned that another
round of rising mortgage rates could kill the hous
ing recovery. Housing-start figures for September
are to be released later this month.
Feds view suit to recoup bribes
— The justice Department is con
templating suing members of Congress convicted
in the Abscam cases to recover government bribe
money taken from undercover FBI agents.
Irvin Nathan, the deputy assistant attorney gen
eral who supervised the investigation, said yester
day the department's civil division is "actively con
sidering" suits against Rep. lohn jenrette (D-S.C.)
and former Rep. Michael "Ozzie" Myers (D-Pa.).
lenrette, with a co-defendant, was convicted
Tuesday of bribery and conspiracy. Myers, con
victed on similar charges in August, was expelled
from the House of Representatives last week.
Four House members still face bribery trials in
the Abscam investigation.
Nathan said the contemplated civil suits should
not be viewed as harassment of those convicted.
"We simply want the return of the money," he
said. "In the Myers case, there's no dispute that he
and his co-defendants split $50,000. In Jenrette,
there's no dispute that co-defendant John Stowe
left the building with $50,000. Flow they divided it
up doesn't matter."
Attorneys for Jenrette and Myers said yesterday
they considered the possibility of the civil suits
"outrageous." Kenneth Robinson, Jenrette's
lawyer, said, "They gave the money away to get the
people to commit the crime." Neil lokelson of
Philadelphia, who has filed suits for Myers chal
lenging his expulsion from Congress, said he re
called Myers had said he would repay his $15,000
share of the bribe money if the trial judge ordered
it.
