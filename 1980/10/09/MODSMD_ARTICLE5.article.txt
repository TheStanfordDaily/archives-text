# NLRB to hear local RNs' charges
## 
### Mike Vaska 
An unfair labor practices charge
brought by registered nurses at the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic (PAMC) and
Stanford's Cowell Student Health
Center against clinic management
will receive a hearing next spring, ac
cording to Kathy North, spokesper
son for the nurses.
The charge, to be heard by the Na
tional Labor Relations Board (NLRB),
is just anotherelement in the escalat
ing dispute between members of the

Registered Nurses Council (RNC)
and management over union affilia
tion. According to North, nurses will
take the first of two steps on Oct. 20
that may lead to a strike at the two
health centers.
Cowell is run by PAMC under a
contract with the University.
A meeting will be held that day fo
determine if there is support within
the RNC for a strike, she said. If
members seem to favorone, a formal

strike vote will he taken a short time
thereafter, North said.
The latest complaint filed by the
RNC asserts that PAMC management
is attempting to discourage union
membership by withholding cost
of-living pay increases which have
been granted to non-union person
nel. Non-union workers received an
B'/2 percent cost-of-living raise in
July.
Union affilation
The dispute began earlier this year
when the nurses voted to affiliate
with the Federation of Nurses and
Health Professionals of the American
Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.
PAMC management refused to
negotiate with the RNC under their
new affiliation. A decision by an
NLRB administrative judge last
month ordered management to rec
ognize the RNC and its affiliation
with the FNHP, but the clinic has
opted to appeal the decision to
another NLRB court in Washington,
D.C.
Nurses, who have been working
without a contract since last Jan. 31,
say they are frustrated by manage
ment's refusal to sit down at the bar
gaining table.
'Union busting'
In addition, they accuse the clinic
of using "union busting" legal coun
sels and delay tactics in an effort to
sever their relationship with the na
tional union. Management has de
nied these charges.
There has been a tremendous
amount of tension at the clinic be
cause of the uncertain situation, ac
cording to nurse Helen Lamathe.
However, there has been no reduc
tion in the quality of patient care, she
added.
If the nurses do take strike action,
the quality of patient care at Cowell
and PAMC will not diminish, accord
ing to clinic spokesperson Bert Rose.
However, the two clinics may have
difficulty handling normal patient
loads with the nurses on he picket
lines, he added.
Striking nurses would in the most
part be replaced with unlicensed
nurses, Rose said.
