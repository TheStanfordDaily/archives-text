# Soviets, Syrians sign cooperation accord
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — In a major reassertion of Soviet influ
ence in the Mideast, the Kremlin and Syria signed a
20-year treaty of friendship and cooperation last
night that binds the countries to close military and
economic ties.
The treaty calls for continued "cooperation in
the military field," the official Tass press agency
said, language virtually identical to similar treaties
the Soviets have signed over the years with Iraq,
Afghanistan and with key Third World capitals.
The pact also calls for mutual consultations on
threats to each other's security, or violations of
peace and security "in the whole world," a clause
never seen before in such a document, according
to some observers here. The two capitals are to
"coordinate their positions and (cooperate) in
order to remove the threat and restore peace."
Although heavily dependent on the Soviet
Union for massive military and economic assis
tance already, Syrian President Hafez Assad up to
now had avoided binding his country to a formal
pact with the Soviets and in recent years pursued a
course that frequently caused friction with Mos
cow. For this reason, the treaty is sure to arouse
concern in Washington, where fears of expanded
Soviet influence because of the Iraq-Iran war are
already running high.
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev restated Mos
cow's neutrality in a toast honoring Assad, his tre
aty co-signer, saying: "We are not going to inter
vene in the conflict between Iran and Iraq. We
stand for its earliest political settlement by the
efforts of the two sides."
But, reflecting both Kremlin confidence and its
own vital interests in the region, he asserted an
implicit warning to the Carter administration: "We
resolutely say to others: hands off these events."
With increasing bitterness, the Soviets have ac

cused the United States and its allies of preparing
military action to intervene in the conflict. Two
U.S. carrier task forces are operating in the vicinity
of the Persian Gulf and the United States has of
fered defensive aid to any country in the region
fearing for its own oil supplies or security. Only
Saudi Arabia has so far accepted the U.S. offer.
Assad's toast, backed up by the new treaty, im
plies that the Syrian leader is firmly back in the
Soviet fold despite recent differences with Mos
cow and cooperation with Israel in Lebanon. Al
though Syria showed fealty to Moscow by declin
ing to join other Islamic nations in condemning
the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, it
also abstained from opposing a similar U.N. vote
on condemnation, a move that at the time re
flected Damascus' strained relations with Mos
cow.
Although the pact outlines various economic
and technical cooperations, it is the military and
mutual security clauses which have proven most
potent in the volatile, shifting world of Mideast
and Gulf region power shifts. The Soviets cited the
mutual security clause when intervening in Af
ghanistan last December, and Moscow continues
to supply arms to Iraq in its war with Iran under the
1972 Moscow-Baghdad pact.
Other treaties
Similar friendship and cooperation treaties have
been signed by Moscow with India, Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Egypt and
Somalia canceled their friendship treaties after
sharp differences with the Kremlin. Egypt, which
signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel,
has become a firm U.S. ally, ostracized by other
Arab states. Somalia and Washington are seeking
closer ties, in part because of U.S. interest in naval
bases in the Horn of Africa.
The treaty underlines Moscow's new influence

in Damascus, asserting the capitals will "develop
and broaden" their consultations, "above all on
the problems of the Middle East."
Brezhnev said, "Soviet-Syrian relations are de
veloping steadily, are growing broader and
deeper," and the pact raises relations "to a new,
higher level." Assad has regularly made autumn
visits here in recent years, but always in the past
left without agreeing to a friendship pact despite
receiving new Soviet arms and economic assis
tance.
Internal unrest
Last night, Brezhnev implied that the treaty was
instigated by Assad, who faces internal unrest
from fundamentalist Islamic factions inside Syria.
The Soviet leader declared, "We highly value the
initiative displayed by the Syrian side and you per
sonally, comrade president."
Brezhnev accused the United States anew of
"collusion of plunder, aggression . . .blackmail,"
and said, "no one has the right to meddle from
outside" in the affairs of Persian Gulf nations. He
condemned Israel anew, saying all "lands seized
from the Arabs by Israel in 1967, including the
eastern part of Jerusalem, should be uncondition
ally returned to them" so a lasting regional peace
could be achieved.
"It is impossible to insure the security of some
people by trampling the rights of others," he said.
The treaty signing opens a spurt of Soviet dip
lomatic activity in coming days. Afghan Marxist
leader Babrak Karmal is expected here soon, his
first trip from Kabul since he was installed as presi
dent there by Soviet froops last December. The
Kremlin also anticipates a trip here by lordan's
King Hussein, who is sure to be both wary of the
implications of the new treaty and to be interested
in pursuing his increasingly activist role as an Arab
spokesman and possible Islamic mediator.

implicit warning to the Carter administration: "We
resolutely say to others: hands off these events."
With increasing bitterness, the Soviets have ac

cused the United States and its allies of preparing
military action to intervene in the conflict. Two
U.S. carrier task forces are operating in the vicinity
of the Persian Gulf and the United States has of
fered defensive aid to any country in the region
fearing for its own oil supplies or security. Only
Saudi Arabia has so far accepted the U.S. offer.
Assad's toast, backed up by the new treaty, im
plies that the Syrian leader is firmly back in the
Soviet fold despite recent differences with Mos
cow and cooperation with Israel in Lebanon. Al
though Syria showed fealty to Moscow by declin
ing to join other Islamic nations in condemning
the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan, it
also abstained from opposing a similar U.N. vote
on condemnation, a move that at the time re
flected Damascus' strained relations with Mos
cow.
Although the pact outlines various economic
and technical cooperations, it is the military and
mutual security clauses which have proven most
potent in the volatile, shifting world of Mideast
and Gulf region power shifts. The Soviets cited the
mutual security clause when intervening in Af
ghanistan last December, and Moscow continues
to supply arms to Iraq in its war with Iran under the
1972 Moscow-Baghdad pact.
Other treaties
Similar friendship and cooperation treaties have
been signed by Moscow with India, Angola,
Mozambique, Ethiopia and Vietnam. Egypt and
Somalia canceled their friendship treaties after
sharp differences with the Kremlin. Egypt, which
signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel,
has become a firm U.S. ally, ostracized by other
Arab states. Somalia and Washington are seeking
closer ties, in part because of U.S. interest in naval
bases in the Horn of Africa.
The treaty underlines Moscow's new influence

in Damascus, asserting the capitals will "develop
and broaden" their consultations, "above all on
the problems of the Middle East."
Brezhnev said, "Soviet-Syrian relations are de
veloping steadily, are growing broader and
deeper," and the pact raises relations "to a new,
higher level." Assad has regularly made autumn
visits here in recent years, but always in the past
left without agreeing to a friendship pact despite
receiving new Soviet arms and economic assis
tance.
Internal unrest
Last night, Brezhnev implied that the treaty was
instigated by Assad, who faces internal unrest
from fundamentalist Islamic factions inside Syria.
The Soviet leader declared, "We highly value the
initiative displayed by the Syrian side and you per
sonally, comrade president."
Brezhnev accused the United States anew of
"collusion of plunder, aggression . . .blackmail,"
and said, "no one has the right to meddle from
outside" in the affairs of Persian Gulf nations. He
condemned Israel anew, saying all "lands seized
from the Arabs by Israel in 1967, including the
eastern part of Jerusalem, should be uncondition
ally returned to them" so a lasting regional peace
could be achieved.
"It is impossible to insure the security of some
people by trampling the rights of others," he said.
The treaty signing opens a spurt of Soviet dip
lomatic activity in coming days. Afghan Marxist
leader Babrak Karmal is expected here soon, his
first trip from Kabul since he was installed as presi
dent there by Soviet froops last December. The
Kremlin also anticipates a trip here by lordan's
King Hussein, who is sure to be both wary of the
implications of the new treaty and to be interested
in pursuing his increasingly activist role as an Arab
spokesman and possible Islamic mediator.
Moscow — In a major reassertion of Soviet influ
ence in the Mideast, the Kremlin and Syria signed a
20-year treaty of friendship and cooperation last
night that binds the countries to close military and
economic ties.
The treaty calls for continued "cooperation in
the military field," the official Tass press agency
said, language virtually identical to similar treaties
the Soviets have signed over the years with Iraq,
Afghanistan and with key Third World capitals.
The pact also calls for mutual consultations on
threats to each other's security, or violations of
peace and security "in the whole world," a clause
never seen before in such a document, according
to some observers here. The two capitals are to
"coordinate their positions and (cooperate) in
order to remove the threat and restore peace."
Although heavily dependent on the Soviet
Union for massive military and economic assis
tance already, Syrian President Hafez Assad up to
now had avoided binding his country to a formal
pact with the Soviets and in recent years pursued a
course that frequently caused friction with Mos
cow. For this reason, the treaty is sure to arouse
concern in Washington, where fears of expanded
Soviet influence because of the Iraq-Iran war are
already running high.
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev restated Mos
cow's neutrality in a toast honoring Assad, his tre
aty co-signer, saying: "We are not going to inter
vene in the conflict between Iran and Iraq. We
stand for its earliest political settlement by the
efforts of the two sides."
