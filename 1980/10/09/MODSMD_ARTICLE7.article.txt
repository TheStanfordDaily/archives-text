## Ban on contraceptives debated Catholic church divided 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — Roman Catholic bishops
discussing family issues here are sharply divided
over the need for a reappraisal of the church's
stand on birth control, posing a potential di
lemma for Pope lohn Paul 11.
Some cardinals and bishops from Western
and Third World countries have asked Pope
John Paul's first synod to examine the problem
of the Catholics who do not accept the church
ban on contraception.
In most cases, the bishops made it clear that
they are not pressing for any specific change in
the church doctrine and that they accept Pope
Paul Vl's 1968 encyclical "Humanae Vitae"
which reiterated the church's opposition to all
forms of birth control except the rhythm
method of sexual abstinence.
But they are pressing for greater "pastoral
concern" and a more sympathetic approach by
the Church to couples using banned birth con
trol methods. As one Vatican analyst put it.the
bishops want the Church to consider the use of
contraceptives as "a minor, pardonable offense
and not a major crime."
Archbishop )ohn Quinn, calling for "a
completely honest examination" ot the issue,
cited studies showing 76.3 percent of American
Catholic women are using birth control and that
29 percent of American Catholic priests believe
contraception is immoral.

The prelates favoring a reappraisal, described
by Pakistani Cardinal Joseph Cordeiro as being a
minority in the more than 200 bishops, have run
into a strong opposition led by conservative Ita
lian cardinals in the Curia, or the Vatican's cent
ral administration.
After Quinn spoke, Italian Cardinal Pericle
Felki, prefect of the Vatican's Supreme Tri
bunal, told the bishops: "There is no need of
rediscussing it, no need to pay attention to
statistics because statistics don't signify any
thing. The encyclical is closed."
The sharp division poses a difficult choice for
the Polish-born pontiff who has criticized con
traception, but has not addressed himself to the
need of finding pastoral guidelines for dealing
with Catholics who ignore the church ban, said a
Vatican-based prelate who asked that his name
not be used.
He said the best result the bishops seeking a
reappraisal could hope for is a church admission
of a "schism between the doctrine and the real
ity" and a call for a more sympathetic pastoral
program.
The bishops, who broke into groups for de
tailed discussion, will be voting on all major
issues of contention in the final phase of the
synod. The pope may accept it and publish it as
the synod document, rewrite any part of it or
reject the document and not publish it.

Pope John Paul II is under increasing tire from some Catholic church officials because of his refusal to
review the church ban on birth control. The Polish-born Pope has criticized contraception, but has not
addressed himself to the need of finding pastoral guidelines for dealing with Catholics who ignore the
church's ban. Despite his statements twelve years ago of the need to review his encyclical, the Pope has
refused to so thus far.
