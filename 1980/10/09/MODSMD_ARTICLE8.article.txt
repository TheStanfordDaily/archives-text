# Neo-fascist revival feared in Europe
## 
### 
London (AP) — Bombings blamed on
ultra-rightists in Italy, West Germany and
France have taken 101 lives and kindled
fears of a fascist revival in Western Europe.
Even so, officials believe that, 35 years
after the defeat of Adolf Hitler's Nazis and
Benito Mussolini's fascists, there is no sig
nificant threat to democracy from ex
tremist organizations.
None of the rightist groups in a half
dozen European countries has any politi
cal power, sizable popular support or,
outside Italy, publicly elected representa
tives.
However, 84 people were killed in a
Bologna railroad station blast in August, 13
died in an explosion at Munich's Oktober
fest Sept. 26 and four died last Friday in a
bomb blast outside a Paris synagogue. Au
thorities have blamed all three attacks on
ultra-rightists.
Officials say there are links among the
most active extremist groups, and in some

countries, particularly France and Spain,
they suspect rightists can be found in law
enforcement agencies.
lose Delthorn, General Secretary of Fr
ance's biggest police union, said last
week that 30 policemen were among 150
suspected members of the ultra-rightist
Fasceaux Nationalistes Europeens, or FNE.
The Council of Europe's political com
mittee warned of a fascist revival in a re
port severe! weeks ago and noted increas
ing connections among known neo-Nazi
organizations.
Anti-fascist monitoring organizations
claim there are at least two contact net
works centered in Belgium and Italy.
The monitors believe most of the mem
bers of these organizations belong to a
new generation of militants who view the
neo-Nazi revival as the answer to leftist
revolutionary violence that scarred West
ern Europe in the last decade.
Observers also blame sagging national

economies in the rightist rise. Some 300
Belgian neo-Nazis armed with clubs and
chains marched through Antwerp Sunday
protesting the presence of 900,000 foreign
workers in the country.
The neo-Nazi revival centers in West
Germany and Italy, countries ruled by to
talitarian regimes less than a generation
ago.
The worst attack blamed on rightists was
in Bologna, Italy, on Aug. 2 when 84 per
sons were killed and hundreds wounded
in a bomb explosion at the city's crowded
railroad terminal. It was the worst terrorist
atrocity in Europe since World War 11.
Last month, 13 persons were killed and
more than 200 wounded in a bombing at
Munich's Oktoberfest beer festival.
In the Paris synagogue bombing that
claimed four lives, FNE claimed responsi
bility and boasted it also had carried out
five other recent attacks against )ewish es
tablishments in Paris.
