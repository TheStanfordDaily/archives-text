# Meat shortage hits Soviet Union
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — Soviet consumers, whose
starchy diet includes less meat than most
Eastern Europeans eat, will have even less
meat on the table this year than in 1979,
according to Western and Soviet sources.
The U.S. grain embargo, however, is
only partly responsible tor an overall de
cline in Soviet meat production that may
reach five percent for the year.
In the view ot most foreign agricultural
experts here, the impact of the grain em
bargo, imposed after the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan last December, is almost
impossible to separate from the effects of
poor weather, and a welter of home
grown problems afflicting the nation's ag
ricultural system.
This marks the third straight year of sta
tic or shrinking meat output in the Soviet
Union.
With the Soviet population growing
about one percent a year, and with little
chance of expanding meat imports much
beyond last year's record 611,000 tons, the
end result will probably be a small but
measurable drop in per capita consump
tion of meat — an important indicator of
consumer well-being — rather than a rise,
as the political leadership has promised.
Embargo hurt a little
"I think the embargo has hurt a little,
made it (the decline in meat output) a little
sharper," one Western agricultural analyst
said, acknowledging that even without the
U.S. grain embargo Soviet meat output
would have shrunk slightly this year.
In that view, the embargo has proved to
be an inconvenience and even, in some re
spects, a disruption, but in ways percepti
ble mainly to political leaders and
economic planners. They had to scramble
for alternative grain markets, pay undis
closed premiums for grain of lower nutri
tional value than the United States would
have sold, and they had to rework parts of
the new five-year economic plan that is to
be approved at the Soviet Communist
Party Congress next February.
But for the average Soviet consumer,
who may be only dimly aware that the Un
ited States once sold millions of tons of
corn and wheat to fatten Soviet cattle, pigs

and chickens — and doesn't anymore —
the outlook is simply more of the same
adequate but generally bleak diet.
US-Soviet comparison
Moscow, where per capita meat con
sumption may approach that of the United
States at 112 kilograms (246 pounds) a year,
is far from representative. Soviet figures
show nationwide meat consumption as 57
kilograms (125 pounds) per person in 1979,
about half the U.S. level and well below
the 70 to 80 kilograms consumed in Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East
Germany.
Stagnating Soviet meat production
marks a gloomy turn in a 15-year effort
under President and party chief Leonid
Brezhnev to vitalize Soviet agriculture,
which still suffers from decades of neglect
and exploitation during the Stalinist
period.
During that period, the Soviet govern
ment has pumped more than 400 billion
rubles ($622 billion at current rates) into
agriculture to mechanize farms and pro
vide state and collective farmers with a
living wage.
Increased vulnerability
Bad weather is the most immediate
cause of this year's meat supply problems,
in the view of foreign analysts. A cold, wet
spring followed by a cold, wet summer has
reduced nutrients in pasture grasses and
hampered grain harvesting in broad areas
of the European part of the Soviet Union
and northern Kazakhstan.
The opposite problem — hot, dry winds
— made for a mediocre grain harvest in the
lower Volga region.
Foreign analysts now think that this
year's grain harvest will come in a little
below 210 million tons — enough, with
imports, to avoid distress slaughtering of
livestock but probably not enough to re
build grain reserves from a poor 1979 har
vest. Estimates here are that the Soviet
Union managed to buy a record 31 million
tons of grain on the world market, but that
fell between three and nine million tons
short of the amount it would have bought
had the U.S. embargo not been imposed.
One implication is that the Soviet Union
may be more vulnerable to a grain em

bargo next year it it again reaps a mediocre
or poor grain harvest.
No rebellion
There might have been no shortage at
all, if Soviet farm workers were more care
ful in harvesting and transporting grain. As
much as 27 million tons of the Soviet har
vest is believed to be moisture, dirt and
chaff. Soviet newspapers tell stories of
200,000-ton lots of damp grain sprouting
for want of drying machinery. Huge quan
tities are also spilled from trucks and rail
road cars.
For all those troubles, there is no evi
dence that the Soviet consumer is likely to
rebel over his dismal meat supply.
For one thing, price seems more impor
tant than availability. Scattered civil dis
turbances broke out the last time a price
rise was imposed in state stores some 20
years ago. With state production costs
running one or two rubles higher than the
selling price per kilogram, the govern
ment now pays the equivalent of about $20
billion in meat-price subsidies.
Consumer improvements
Soviet consumers, moreover, may be
among the world's wiliest in the face ot
scarcity.
"Everyone has ways of getting things," a
Moscow resident said. ''Let's say leather
boots cost 80 rubles and I have a way ot
getting them for less. And I have a friend
who can get meat. So we make an ar
rangement and we're both happy."
And even if the food situation has de
teriorated in the last few years, Soviet citi
zens perceive-countervailing improve
ments. Televisions, refrigerators, washing
machines, even cars are becoming more
accessible. And housing, though it re
mains one of the Soviet Union's biggest
social problems, is widely thought to be
improving.
Ten years ago, a Moscow intellectual re
called, he and his wife and son lived in a
cramped, one-room apartment with a
shared bathroom and kitchen. Today they
have their own four-room apartment. "I'd
rather have a four-room apartment than
eat meat every day,"he said.

In that view, the embargo has proved to
be an inconvenience and even, in some re
spects, a disruption, but in ways percepti
ble mainly to political leaders and
economic planners. They had to scramble
for alternative grain markets, pay undis
closed premiums for grain of lower nutri
tional value than the United States would
have sold, and they had to rework parts of
the new five-year economic plan that is to
be approved at the Soviet Communist
Party Congress next February.
But for the average Soviet consumer,
who may be only dimly aware that the Un
ited States once sold millions of tons of
corn and wheat to fatten Soviet cattle, pigs

and chickens — and doesn't anymore —
the outlook is simply more of the same
adequate but generally bleak diet.
US-Soviet comparison
Moscow, where per capita meat con
sumption may approach that of the United
States at 112 kilograms (246 pounds) a year,
is far from representative. Soviet figures
show nationwide meat consumption as 57
kilograms (125 pounds) per person in 1979,
about half the U.S. level and well below
the 70 to 80 kilograms consumed in Po
land, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East
Germany.
Stagnating Soviet meat production
marks a gloomy turn in a 15-year effort
under President and party chief Leonid
Brezhnev to vitalize Soviet agriculture,
which still suffers from decades of neglect
and exploitation during the Stalinist
period.
During that period, the Soviet govern
ment has pumped more than 400 billion
rubles ($622 billion at current rates) into
agriculture to mechanize farms and pro
vide state and collective farmers with a
living wage.
Increased vulnerability
Bad weather is the most immediate
cause of this year's meat supply problems,
in the view of foreign analysts. A cold, wet
spring followed by a cold, wet summer has
reduced nutrients in pasture grasses and
hampered grain harvesting in broad areas
of the European part of the Soviet Union
and northern Kazakhstan.
The opposite problem — hot, dry winds
— made for a mediocre grain harvest in the
lower Volga region.
Foreign analysts now think that this
year's grain harvest will come in a little
below 210 million tons — enough, with
imports, to avoid distress slaughtering of
livestock but probably not enough to re
build grain reserves from a poor 1979 har
vest. Estimates here are that the Soviet
Union managed to buy a record 31 million
tons of grain on the world market, but that
fell between three and nine million tons
short of the amount it would have bought
had the U.S. embargo not been imposed.
One implication is that the Soviet Union
may be more vulnerable to a grain em

bargo next year it it again reaps a mediocre
or poor grain harvest.
No rebellion
There might have been no shortage at
all, if Soviet farm workers were more care
ful in harvesting and transporting grain. As
much as 27 million tons of the Soviet har
vest is believed to be moisture, dirt and
chaff. Soviet newspapers tell stories of
200,000-ton lots of damp grain sprouting
for want of drying machinery. Huge quan
tities are also spilled from trucks and rail
road cars.
For all those troubles, there is no evi
dence that the Soviet consumer is likely to
rebel over his dismal meat supply.
For one thing, price seems more impor
tant than availability. Scattered civil dis
turbances broke out the last time a price
rise was imposed in state stores some 20
years ago. With state production costs
running one or two rubles higher than the
selling price per kilogram, the govern
ment now pays the equivalent of about $20
billion in meat-price subsidies.
Consumer improvements
Soviet consumers, moreover, may be
among the world's wiliest in the face ot
scarcity.
"Everyone has ways of getting things," a
Moscow resident said. ''Let's say leather
boots cost 80 rubles and I have a way ot
getting them for less. And I have a friend
who can get meat. So we make an ar
rangement and we're both happy."
And even if the food situation has de
teriorated in the last few years, Soviet citi
zens perceive-countervailing improve
ments. Televisions, refrigerators, washing
machines, even cars are becoming more
accessible. And housing, though it re
mains one of the Soviet Union's biggest
social problems, is widely thought to be
improving.
Ten years ago, a Moscow intellectual re
called, he and his wife and son lived in a
cramped, one-room apartment with a
shared bathroom and kitchen. Today they
have their own four-room apartment. "I'd
rather have a four-room apartment than
eat meat every day,"he said.
Moscow — Soviet consumers, whose
starchy diet includes less meat than most
Eastern Europeans eat, will have even less
meat on the table this year than in 1979,
according to Western and Soviet sources.
The U.S. grain embargo, however, is
only partly responsible tor an overall de
cline in Soviet meat production that may
reach five percent for the year.
In the view ot most foreign agricultural
experts here, the impact of the grain em
bargo, imposed after the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan last December, is almost
impossible to separate from the effects of
poor weather, and a welter of home
grown problems afflicting the nation's ag
ricultural system.
This marks the third straight year of sta
tic or shrinking meat output in the Soviet
Union.
With the Soviet population growing
about one percent a year, and with little
chance of expanding meat imports much
beyond last year's record 611,000 tons, the
end result will probably be a small but
measurable drop in per capita consump
tion of meat — an important indicator of
consumer well-being — rather than a rise,
as the political leadership has promised.
Embargo hurt a little
"I think the embargo has hurt a little,
made it (the decline in meat output) a little
sharper," one Western agricultural analyst
said, acknowledging that even without the
U.S. grain embargo Soviet meat output
would have shrunk slightly this year.
