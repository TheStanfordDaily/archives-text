# Return of missing soldiers unlikely

### Washington Post 
Bangkok â€” Seven years of cautious
cooperation between Vietnam and the Un
ited States on some 2500 Americans listed
as missing during the Indochina War ap
pears threatened by Vietnam's conflict
with China.
Two officers from the Joint Casualty Re
solution Center, the U.S. military group in
charge of missing-in-action cases, were
told in Hanoi last week that mobilization
against China had drawn manpower and
funds away from the search for graves and
aircraft crash sites, Bangkok sources re
ported.
Popular anger over the United States'
close ties with China had made many Viet
namese reluctant to assist tracing efforts,
officials from Hanoi's Office for Seeking
Missing Personnel were quoted as saying.
China and Vietnam fought a month-long
borderwar in thespringof 1979. Hanoi has
often accused the United States, which
several months earlier had normalized re
lations with Peking, of complicity in Chi
na's attack. Vietnam and the United States
have no diplomatic ties.
A statement issued by the U.S. mission
in Bangkok after the Americans left Hanoi
said the Vietnamese had provided no new
information on MIA cases and declined
requests for regular meetings. "We would
hope that they will reconsider," the state

ment said.
Cooperation
Vietnamese officials did request further
information on four specific cases and dis
closed details of their tracing procedure.
These were considered the only positive
results of the meeting, by the American
side, Bangkok sources said.
Cooperation between Vietnam and the
United States concerning MIAs began in
1973, when the Paris peace accords were
signed and American combat forces with
drew from Indochina. At that time 2600
U.S. servicemen and civilians were listed
as missing or killed but not recovered.
Since then, Vietnam has returned the
remains of 71 Americans and Laos the re
mains of two. An additional 23 sets of re
mains were recovered by casualty center
teams in South Vietnam before Com
munist troops captured Saigon in 1975.
Little hope
Seven years after the search began, the
center maintains a staff of 15 at its head
quarters in Hawaii. Three more personnel
stationed in Bangkok spend much of their
time interviewing refugees newly arrived
from Indochina.
With little serious hope remaining that
some MIAs may still be alive, they seek
details on how specific Americans died or
where they are buried. Passage of time has
led the military to reclassify as presumed

dead all hut about 30 of the 2500 unresol
ved cases.
Vietnamese officials argue that their
government has devoted considerable
time and resources to the MIA search. De
tails of the exhumation of the body of one
U.S. Air Force flyer, Maj. Arthur Mearns,
were published in a white paper on MIAs
in April
Vietnamese denials
U.S. documents showed him as having
disappeared over Quang Minh province in
1966, when in fact he went down in Ha Bac
province, where local villagers hastily
buried his body.
Ten years later, a Vietnamese team from
Hanoi was unable to locate the site until it
brought one of the men who had dug the
grave from his new home 250 miles away.
Six men searched with hand tools for five
days but found nothing. Finally a
bulldozer was brought in and eventually
uncovered the grave.
Despite efforts like these, Vietnamese
officials say, the United States continues
to make political capital by charging that
Flanoi is withholding information and re
mains.
Hanoi has denied with unusual energy
recent claims from an unidentified re
fugee that the remains of 400 Americans
were being stored in a mortuary on Ly Nam
De Street in Hanoi.
