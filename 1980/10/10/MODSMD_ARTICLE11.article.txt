# Cobuds: hotline to Cowell
## 
### Cici Oremland 
The Cowell Cobuds, a new "co
ombudsperson" group ot students and
Cowell stmt, has been formed to serve as a
neutral liaison between the students and the
Cowell stall.
The group will hear suggestions, com
plaints and questions about the student
health care system on campus. The focus ol
the group is not to defend Cowell, but to give
students and Cowell stall information about
Cowell policies and procedures.
Through their combined student/staff op
eration, Cobuds will provide "more con
tinuity with Cowell than just a consumer ad
vocate group," said Valerie Herman, one of
the Cobuds tounders.
Cobuds deals with individual c ase prob
lems, as well as c one erns ot the student body
as a whole," she said.
In addition to a llier providing intormation
about Cowell, the Cobuds service holds reg
ular office hours Monday through Thursday
12 p.m. to 2 p.m., and provides a 24-hour
hotline, 497-9141.
So far as the group lias had little vocal re
sponse, but they have received many written
ideas in their suggestion box in the health
care center. A second box will soon be plac ed
in the ASSU office.
"It (Cobuds) has potential. Whether it will
work or not, and (whether) students will use

it, we'll have to wait and see," said Dr. lames
McClenahan, director ot student health ser
vices.
Cowell has tried such suggestion services
in the past with little sue cess. But Madelaine
Smith, a Cowell stall member ol the group,
said Cobuds is more organized and has done
more advertising than similar services in the
past.
"We've just made a better avenue lor
communication . . . even it one person uses
it, it'll be great," she said.
Cobuds is a pilot project at Cowell that
developed out ot a research paper for a
Human Biology health policy class last year.
The c lass assignment allowed students to de
vise a solution to a problem in the area ol
health policy. Unlike many other student
project assignments, this one was actually
implemented.
Three ol the live program developers are
temporarily serving on the Cobuds staff until
the ASSU Nominations Committee can select
one undergraduate and one graduate stu
dent for the positions.
Herman admits there are problems with
student service at Cowell, but she is optimis
tic about the future. She said, "Stanford stu
dents are educated and expect a lot, maybe
too much. But the people at Cowell have
really been helpful. They really do care."
