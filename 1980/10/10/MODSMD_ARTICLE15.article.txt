## The 						boot drops in Turkey 
### 
On Sept. 12, 19H0, the tele
types of press agencies were
clic king with news ot a "blood
less" predawn coup in Turkey,
a "reluctant" and "last resort"
move ot the top ranking gener
als promising to "wipe out
growing extremist violence,
restore political stability and
eventually give way to civilian
rule."
The National Security Coun
cil —as the six-man junta i hose
to call themselves — alter an
immediate pledge to continue
the previous government s
pro-Western foreign policy
and especially Turkey's com
mitments as a "key member"
ot the NATO, abolished the
constitution, dissolved the par
liament, closed all the political
parties, trade unions and pro
fessional organizations, ban
ned all forms ot political activ
ity, imposed censorship on
news and started rounding up
"suspected terrorists.
University professors, lead
ers ot most ot the trade unions
and professional organizations
including the president of the
bar association were among
those arrested. In an attempt to
■counter questions about U.S.
involvement, the State De
partment disclosed that a
senior Turkish officer had tele
phoned the head ot the Ameri
can military assistance group in
Ankara 75 minutes before the
coup and had given assur
ances.
As some ot the initially
"overlooked" details began to
emerge, it was learned that the
Turkish Air Force commander
had returned last Thursday
evening from a visit with top
military officers in the U.S., in
time to assume his position in
the junta.
Despite its blatantly anti
democratic nature, the coup
was extremely well-received, it
not welcomed, bv the apologe
tic western press and the capi
tals of the "free-World" that
championed the cause ot the
Polish workers demanding tree
trade-unions. The media began
to preach the inevitability of the
coup by laboriously document
ing the impotence of the
democratically elected politi
cians in the face of the urban
violence assuming proportions
of a mini civil war, and the most
severe economic crisis of the

last halt century.
As an editorial in the New
York Times pointed out, "The
American stake in Ankara can
hardly be minimized es'pec lally
alter the Iran c risis. Not only is
Turkey a butter between
Europe and the Middle List, it
is NATO's southeast sentinel,
sharing a frontier with the
Soviet Union and tacing Iran.
Washington's interests go well
beyond the restoration ot Tur
kish democracy and the con
valescence ot a sick Turkish
economy."
The economy is at a virtual
standstill in the midst ot one ot
the deepest foreign exchange
crises anywhere in the Third
World with an inflation rate ot
150 percent and an un
employment rate exceeding 20
percent. The political stale
mate at large reflected the ina
bility ot the capitalist claSs to
establish its hegemony.
Due to the tailure ot the
torces ot the lett to unify and
lead a powerful opposition,
the political power vacuum
was gradually tilled by the
growing fascist movement,
which utilized sentiments as
sociated wih religious and
ethnic identities to transfer po
tential hostilities from class
disparities, to differences with
and antagonisms toward other
ethnic and religious groups.
Right-wing commando units
known as "Grey Wolves"
spearheaded the fascist terror
under the protection ot the
neo-fascist National Move
ment Party (NMP), which en
joyed the tacit backing of the
government and boasted of
helping the torces ot the state
in combating international
communism.
On July 27 two right-wing
terrorists sentenced to death
tor mass murder escaped from
the top security military prison
in Ankara, amid claims of im
partiality by the armed torces.
On the day of the coup the
leader ot NMP, ex-colonel Al
parslan Turkes, evaded the
pre-dawn roundup of leading
political figures thankstoa leak
from high-ranking officers.
While Turkes obeyed the
surrender order to join 52
members of the parliament al
ready under custody (includ
ing nine of his own followers,

live Moslem fundamentalists
belonging to the National "sal
vation Party (NSP), and 26 so
cial democrats belonging to
the People's Republican Partv
led by Bulent Fc ev it), the junta
has been tar trom evenhanded
during its 11rst tew davs in
power. Their true motives
were brought to light Sept. lb
when troops, in a crackdown
on lettist intellectuals and pro
fessionals, swept through
every major technical associa
tion and some state institutu
tions in the capital, arresting
workers and carrying away re
cords.
One thousand seven
h un d red de moc ra tica 11 y
elected mayors were replaced
by army officers. These ac tions
were followed by the mass ar
rests in the working class dis
tricts. Left-leaning officials in
municipal offices ot the pro
vince centers were ousted and
striking workers were ordered
to go back to their jobs with a
70 percent raise in wages, with
the inflation hovering at an an
nual U0 percent. By retaining
the chief economic adviser as
well as the ministry secretary
generals ot the ousted gov
ernment of Suleyman Demirel,
the generals indicated that
they intended to continue the
economic policies outlined in
an International Monetary Fund
report and the general thrust of
conservative politics of the
right-wing justice Partv (JP) of
Mr. Demirel.
A new "civilian'' cabinet was
announced on Sept. 21, under
the leadership of Bulent Ulusu,
recently retired chief of the
naval forces and tormer army
officers holding five key minis
teries. lust after the coup the
western world did not hesitate
to assure the generals of con
tinuing economic and military
aid. On the other hand, U-2
planes were allowed to operate
from Turkish bases to gather
intelligence over the U.S.S.R.
We, the Association of Stu
dents from Turkey at Stanford
University, urge you to keep a
critical eye on the develop
ments in Turkey and invite you
to join forces with us in oppos
ing any form of repression.

On Sept. 12, 19H0, the tele
types of press agencies were
clic king with news ot a "blood
less" predawn coup in Turkey,
a "reluctant" and "last resort"
move ot the top ranking gener
als promising to "wipe out
growing extremist violence,
restore political stability and
eventually give way to civilian
rule."
The National Security Coun
cil —as the six-man junta i hose
to call themselves — alter an
immediate pledge to continue
the previous government s
pro-Western foreign policy
and especially Turkey's com
mitments as a "key member"
ot the NATO, abolished the
constitution, dissolved the par
liament, closed all the political
parties, trade unions and pro
fessional organizations, ban
ned all forms ot political activ
ity, imposed censorship on
news and started rounding up
"suspected terrorists.
University professors, lead
ers ot most ot the trade unions
and professional organizations
including the president of the
bar association were among
those arrested. In an attempt to
■counter questions about U.S.
involvement, the State De
partment disclosed that a
senior Turkish officer had tele
phoned the head ot the Ameri
can military assistance group in
Ankara 75 minutes before the
coup and had given assur
ances.
As some ot the initially
"overlooked" details began to
emerge, it was learned that the
Turkish Air Force commander
had returned last Thursday
evening from a visit with top
military officers in the U.S., in
time to assume his position in
the junta.
Despite its blatantly anti
democratic nature, the coup
was extremely well-received, it
not welcomed, bv the apologe
tic western press and the capi
tals of the "free-World" that
championed the cause ot the
Polish workers demanding tree
trade-unions. The media began
to preach the inevitability of the
coup by laboriously document
ing the impotence of the
democratically elected politi
cians in the face of the urban
violence assuming proportions
of a mini civil war, and the most
severe economic crisis of the

last halt century.
As an editorial in the New
York Times pointed out, "The
American stake in Ankara can
hardly be minimized es'pec lally
alter the Iran c risis. Not only is
Turkey a butter between
Europe and the Middle List, it
is NATO's southeast sentinel,
sharing a frontier with the
Soviet Union and tacing Iran.
Washington's interests go well
beyond the restoration ot Tur
kish democracy and the con
valescence ot a sick Turkish
economy."
The economy is at a virtual
standstill in the midst ot one ot
the deepest foreign exchange
crises anywhere in the Third
World with an inflation rate ot
150 percent and an un
employment rate exceeding 20
percent. The political stale
mate at large reflected the ina
bility ot the capitalist claSs to
establish its hegemony.
Due to the tailure ot the
torces ot the lett to unify and
lead a powerful opposition,
the political power vacuum
was gradually tilled by the
growing fascist movement,
which utilized sentiments as
sociated wih religious and
ethnic identities to transfer po
tential hostilities from class
disparities, to differences with
and antagonisms toward other
ethnic and religious groups.
Right-wing commando units
known as "Grey Wolves"
spearheaded the fascist terror
under the protection ot the
neo-fascist National Move
ment Party (NMP), which en
joyed the tacit backing of the
government and boasted of
helping the torces ot the state
in combating international
communism.
On July 27 two right-wing
terrorists sentenced to death
tor mass murder escaped from
the top security military prison
in Ankara, amid claims of im
partiality by the armed torces.
On the day of the coup the
leader ot NMP, ex-colonel Al
parslan Turkes, evaded the
pre-dawn roundup of leading
political figures thankstoa leak
from high-ranking officers.
While Turkes obeyed the
surrender order to join 52
members of the parliament al
ready under custody (includ
ing nine of his own followers,

live Moslem fundamentalists
belonging to the National "sal
vation Party (NSP), and 26 so
cial democrats belonging to
the People's Republican Partv
led by Bulent Fc ev it), the junta
has been tar trom evenhanded
during its 11rst tew davs in
power. Their true motives
were brought to light Sept. lb
when troops, in a crackdown
on lettist intellectuals and pro
fessionals, swept through
every major technical associa
tion and some state institutu
tions in the capital, arresting
workers and carrying away re
cords.
One thousand seven
h un d red de moc ra tica 11 y
elected mayors were replaced
by army officers. These ac tions
were followed by the mass ar
rests in the working class dis
tricts. Left-leaning officials in
municipal offices ot the pro
vince centers were ousted and
striking workers were ordered
to go back to their jobs with a
70 percent raise in wages, with
the inflation hovering at an an
nual U0 percent. By retaining
the chief economic adviser as
well as the ministry secretary
generals ot the ousted gov
ernment of Suleyman Demirel,
the generals indicated that
they intended to continue the
economic policies outlined in
an International Monetary Fund
report and the general thrust of
conservative politics of the
right-wing justice Partv (JP) of
Mr. Demirel.
A new "civilian'' cabinet was
announced on Sept. 21, under
the leadership of Bulent Ulusu,
recently retired chief of the
naval forces and tormer army
officers holding five key minis
teries. lust after the coup the
western world did not hesitate
to assure the generals of con
tinuing economic and military
aid. On the other hand, U-2
planes were allowed to operate
from Turkish bases to gather
intelligence over the U.S.S.R.
