Recruit minorities
Two years ago, a small
number of people in the black
community at Stanford expres
sed some concern about the
dissolution of the Minority
Admissions Committee in the
Medical School. More specifi
cally, the concern was that this
dissolution would have a nega
tive impact on black enroll
ment there. The concern is a
real one.
Although the Medical
School reports that it admitted
23 black applicants this year,
the fact that only six matricu
lated cannot go unnoticed. The
welcoming attitude of the

school's faculty toward women
and minorities is commenda
ble. Nevertheless, an obvious
precondition of any welcome
is the actual presence of
women and minorities in the
classrooms of the Medical
School.
The Law School represents
an interesting contrast. Largely
due to the great effort of Assis
tant Dean La Doris Cordell,
black enrollment is at a record
high, and so in the enrollment
of minorities in general. The
Law School's strategy is clear
evidence that to admit is not
enough; to recruit is a neces
sity.
In that the Law School is only

a half-mile from the Medical
School, the Law School's en
rollment performance dis
putes the Medical School's
thesis that "Black students may
prefer medical schools in
urban centers with higher
black populations. . There
fore, there has to be a reason,
other than geographic, foronly
a one-fourth yield.
The Medical School should
re-examine its recruiting prog
ram. There are a number of
blacks who would be willing to
assist in encouraging blacks to
accept admission to Stanford.

Not just a spoiler
The 1980 presidential elec
tion is more than a race bet
ween two men. It is an oppor
tunity for the people of the Un
ited States to voice their opin
ion about the quality of their
government and of the people
running for office in that gov
ernment.
As a recently registered vo
ter, I am disgusted with both
and I am following the only al
ternative course open to me. I
am supporting |ohn Anderson.
A recent column in the Daily
stated that although Anderson
would "undoubtedly be a
wiser and more effective pres
ident than (Jimmy) Carter," he
has no chance to win. This is
not true. A recent poll of the
state of California showed An
derson leading the field with 36
percent of the vote while
Reagan and Carter trailed with
31 percent and 29 percent, re

spectively.
In other states, Anderson is
very close behind Carter and
Reagan, with a sizable portion
of the population still unde
cided. In many states Ander
son is running a close second
to either Carter or Reagan. An
derson has a chance to win the
presidency â€” a very good
chance.
The assertion that Anderson
is just a "spoiler" candidate is
one ot a scared Carter White
House. Carter's fear of Ander
son has already been made
evident by his refusal to take
part in the debates sponsored
by the League of Women Vot
ers.
Anderson's status as *n in
dependent candidate does not
make him a "spoiler" but,
rather, an alternative. It is
ridiculous not to vote for the
superior candidate merely be
cause his opponents say that
he cannot win.
The appearance of an inde
pendent candidate is not a step
backward, but rather a sign of
progress. The existence of an
able politician who is willing to
fight the two established par
ties shows that the American
political system is still capable
of producing determined and
courageous leaders.
Voters should not turn away
from Anderson because of the
cries of his opponents. In
stead, they should redouble
their support and vote accord
ing to their consciences.
