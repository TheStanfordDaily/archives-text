# Hundreds of civilians killed
## Iraqi missiles hit Iranian cities 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut, Lebanon â€” Iraqi long-range
rockets hit Iranian cities tor the first
time yesterday, inflicting the highest
casualties in any day's fighting in the
Persian Gulf war.
The surface-to-surface missiles
were launched against cities in
Khuzistan Province, and Iranian
military sources said that about 200
persons were killed and hundreds
wounded. More than TOO civilians
were killed in the communications
and military center of Dezful alone,
the sources said.
The long-range rocket attack rep
resented a significant escalation in
the nature of the fighting. Iranian
headquarters said the missiles were
launched from inside the Iraqi bor
der. ... .
The Iraqis have among their ar
mament Frog missiles with a range of
up to 45 miles, and the Scud rocket,
whose range is 185 miles.
The missiles are Soviet-made.
In Tehran yesterday, Prime Minis
ter Mohammed Ali Rajai called the
rocket attack "another insane ac
tion" by Iraqi President Saddam Hus
sein.
Iranian President Abolhassan

Bani-Sadr declared, meanwhile, that
the 19-day-old war was entering its
"final stages."
Bani-Sadr said that Tehran's armed
forces were launching counterat
tacks along a 25-mile front against the
Iraqi invaders, and that the military
picture had improved considerably
in the past 24 hours.
The president's remark came as
Tehran dispatched several envoys to
sympathetic "revolutionary and
Moslem" nations to explain Iran's
position.
Rajai seemed to spurn any interna
tional attempt to effect a truce bet
ween the warring Gulf neighbors
when he declared that the various
calls for a cease-fire came from na
tions "who pay not the slightest at
tention to Iran."
Iraq, whose army crossed the bor
der into Iran Sept. 22, declared a un
ilateral cease-fire to go into effect at
sunrise last Sunday, but it lasted only
a few hours.
Baghdad, too, announced yester
day that it had dispatched emissaries
to more than two dozen countries in
Europe, Asia and Africa to present its
case before the governments of the
world.

The Iraqi Embassy in London said
that the diplomats were carrying Ira
qi's terms for an end to the invasion:
control of the Shatt al Arab waterway
that leads from the port of Basra to
the Persian Gulf, readjustment of
some border territories in favor of
Iraq, and a pledge by Iran not to
meddle in other countries' affairs.
Such terms have been flatly re
jected by the Tehran government.
Tehran has said there would be no
cease-fire until all Iraqi troops with
draw from Iranian territory.

In Ankara, reports said that Iraqi
Youth Minister Karim Mahmud Hus
sein al Molla met with new Turkish
Prime Minister Bulent Ulusu and
asked the Turks to mediate in the
war.
The report was not immediately of
ficially confirmed, but if true, it
would be an indication that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein must be
having serious second thoughts
about his invasion of Iran.
Diplomatic sources believe that
