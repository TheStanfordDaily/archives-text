## A 						mood of cautious hope 
### 
Jirrfmy Carter's foreign pol
icy has never brought him
much praise. In fact, experts
describe it as occasionally
clownish, often unpredictable,
and almost always dangerous,
terms I've always thought ap
propriate for a Barnum and
Bailey circus.
I recently heard a political
analyst describe the Presi
dent's approach as "pray and
pass the ammunition." Writing
an apology fo,r such a perfor
mance would be difficult so I'll
leave it to some more en
thusiastic supporter of the
president like Robert Strauss,
or perhaps Lane Kirkland.
Vet, even granting the
shortcomings, something sig
nificant has happened to U.S.
foreign policy in the past four
years, something that might be
a very positive development in
our global relations. That
something is a commitment to
human rights around the
world.
The administration decided
early that four important objec
tives were necessary for a suc
cessful human rights policy:
the restoration of America's
confidence in the moral integ
rity of its foreign policy; the
redemption of the ideological
offensive against worldwide
communism; the opening up
of channels of communication
with opposition leaders in au
thoritarian countries like
Brazil; and the protection of
thousands of victims of human
rights violations.
Clearly, good progress has

been made in all four areas. If
you believe polls, public con
fidence in the integrity of our
foreign policy has climbed sig
nificantly. The Third World un
deniably views us in a softer
light. We have lost a good deal
of our decades-old image as
the abettor of oppression. As a
result, the U.S. is holding its
own with Moscow on the
ideological front.
Perhaps most important, the
administration has opened re
lations with both official gov
ernments and opposition
groups, using these channels
to lobby for democratic reform
and the release of political
prisoners.
Nowhere have these succes
ses been more evident than in
Latin America. Forthe firsttime
thousands of political prison
ers have been freed in Chile,
Cuba, Paraguay, and Haiti,
with most of these liberations
the direct or indirect result of
U.S. pressure.
Argentina, Uraguay, and
Chil-e have released lists of
political prisoners, and reports
of torture in the region have
decreased, both (according to
many Latin Americans) as a re
sult of insistent U.S. efforts. '
Time magazine recently did a
piece on America's newactivist
ambassadors in Latin America.
El Salvador's Robert White was
reported to have denounced
the powerful Salvadoran
Chamber of Commerce, accus
ing its wealthy members of
"resisting reform and condon

ing repression." Said he,
"When you're trying to stop
torture, you have to get your
hands dirty."
Even with these gains, Car
ter's policies have come under
severe attack in Congress and
in the foreign relations
bureaucracy. Many have
labeled them naive, and others
have even argued that they are
counter-productive. Because
of this the impact of the new
emphasis on human rights has
been greatly reduced, and its
future, particularly with a pos
sible Reagan presidency on the
horizon, looks bleak.
But credit is due where cre
dit is deserved. I'll allow Ab
raham Lowenthal, director of
the Latin America program of
the Smithsonian's Woodrow
Wilson Center, to summarize
for me.
"A mood of cautious hope
has begun to permeate Central
and South America. Local
popular leadership has
emerged in many cases en
couraged by signs that brutal
repression is no longer
legitimized by Washington, or
even New York. . .Perhaps
most impressively, U.S. influ
ence under Carter has helped
advance the process of restor
ing representative government
to the hemisphere, and has
strengthened democratic gov
ernments where they take
hold.",
