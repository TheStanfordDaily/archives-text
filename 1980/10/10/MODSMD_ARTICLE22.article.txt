## Carter, Reagan differ on peace policy 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The rhetorical dust thrown up by this
tail's presidential campaign may hide the tact, hut
Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan actually do hold
profoundly different views of this country's proper
role in the world.
They are classic American views, retlec ting the am
bivalence Americans have always brought to their
dealings with the outside world. But they diverge on
many other points and are contradic tory on others.
Reagan is a believer in simple truths — most basi
cally that, to achieve the protection of its interna
tional interests, the United States must pursue them
forcefully and without equivocation.
jimmy Carter draws on another strain of the na
tional character. In his vision of the world, America is
lirst of all a moral beacon, a nation whose power
comes from the force of its example as much as the
power of its army or its economic strength. Carter has
had great difficulty converting that vision into consis
tent, effective policies, but he has stuck by it.
Public opinion polls available to both candidates
show that Americans tend to be fervent if inconsis
tent supporters of both a tough line and the ardent
pursuit of peace, a potential contradiction that prob
ably explains the two candidates' desires to becloud
the national security issues this fall. But if one looks
beyond the campaign rhetoric to the formation of

Carter's and Reagan's basic reflexes on foreign policy
issues, the ditterences between them become much
clearer.
Where Reagan lias always seen the world primarily
in terms ot the Soviet-American contest, the early
Carter insisted that this was a mistake.

could move beyond the* confining competition with
the Soviet Union lias been altered by events. Fhe

defense spending, sanctions against the So\ iet Union
and a harder line, generally.
Whatever the changes Afghanistan has caused in
Carter's thinking, though, he anci Reagan still disag
ree significantly on the central issues ot Soviet-
American relations — the military balance and SALT.
In both cases, the two candidates seem to be follow
ing their traditional instincts.
Reagan says he would withdraw the SALT treaty
from the Senate and tell the Soviets that they will have
to negotiate a new one more favorable to the United
States and-or more clearly directed at actual arms
reductions, rather than the controlled expansion of
nuclear arsenals that SALT II would permit. This inv i
