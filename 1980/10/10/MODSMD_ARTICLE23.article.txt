# Auto industry wants fewer imports
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Can General Motors
Ford and Chrysler make a comeback, or
will the 1980s belong to Toyota, Datsun
and Honda?
That question, involving the struggle for
the hearts and checkbooks of American
car buyers, came up Wednesday in the
Department ot Justice's Great Hall, a
high-ceilinged auditorium when three
men and two women will sit m k' nent
on the future of the $90 billion-a-year
domestic car market.
The five members of the International
Trade Commission will decide whether
Japanese imports have grievously dam
aged the American auto industry.
Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto
Workers Union have asked the commis
sion for a dramatic 50-percent cutback in

Japanese imports, to give U.S. companies
a five-year breathing space in which to
build the small cars demanded by many
Americans in the new era of gasoline scar
city.
Cut the imports back to 1976 levels, Ford
has told the ommission in a brief, and the
domestic industry will prosper, with $8
billion in additional earnings, 5.4 million
more tors nd trucks sold, and 240,000
workers back on the job.
Significant harm
To win, Ford and the UAW must con
vince a majority of the commissioners that
Japanese imports were a significant cause
of harm to the domestic industry, equal to
any other cause. If the commissioners de
cide, for example, that the price of
gasoline and the recession played a bigger
role in the damage, they would reject the

petition for help.
The Trade Commission, a relatively
obscure independent agency, fell heir to
the automobile controversy after the U.S.
industry and the UAW filed to persuade
the Japanese to hold back their exports
voluntarily. Congress also refused to pro
vide relief for the Americans.
Under the 1974 Trade Act, the commis
sion will recommend a remedy to the pres
ident if injury is found. He then may accept
a relief plan, put his own program into
effect, or do nothing. Congress, in turn,
may override any action by the president.
Japanese automakers send 20 percent of
their production to the United States. If
Ford and the UAW win their case, the im
pact could be devastating economically
and damaging politically to U.S.-Japanese
relations.
