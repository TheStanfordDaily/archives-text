# Stanford meets No. 5 UCLA
## Expect a real barnburner at the Coliseum 
### Chris Haft 
It is hardly a classic confrontation — it
tails to approach the magnitude of the
Big Game, tor example. It cannot e\en
be considered climactic, for this is only
the middle of the season.
Vet when Stantord plays UCLA to
morrow atternoon at 1:30 in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, it should be one hell
of a football game.
Stanford pits its 4-1 rei ord and No. 16
ranking against UCLA's 4-0 mark and
No. 5 status. Stanford puts its reputa
tion ot playing well against the good
teams and poorly against the mediocre
ones on the line against UCLA, a good
team that leads the Pacific-10 Confer
ence in scoring (32.8 points per game)
and in preventing scoring (".0 points
allowed a contest). Stantord can crow
about its $1-14 triumph over pow
erhouse Oklahoma two weeks ago, and
UCLA can brag about its 1~-0 upset (if
pre\ lously No. 2-ranked Ohio State last
Saturday.
Moreover, both teams share a
three-year history ot playing games that
belong in ever\ tans' mental scrap
book. The 19" (Stanford, 32-28), the 78
(UCLA. 27-26) and 79 (Stantord, 27-24,
on Ken Naber's last-second 56-yard
field goal) games transcended excite
ment.
"They've just been the wildest games
I've ever coached in," Bruin headcoach
Terrv Donahue s.iid ot the Cardinal-

UCLA battles. "You |ust want to say,
'Let's forget the first 58 minutes and
play the last tvvo.'"
This season, however, the Bruins
have been quite adept during all 60 mi
nutes. Despite being one ot the teams
stowed in the Pac-10brig from confer
ence championship and bowl game
eligibility, UCLA has played with tervor.
Donahue downplayed the negative
ettect that the Bruins one-year suspen
sion might have. His players, the coach
said, "are not people you have to
dangle a carrot in tront of. They're
motivated from within . . . we've got 11
games, and we have to take advantage
ot all 11.
What the Bruins take advantage of
best are the remarkable talents of safety
Kenny Las lev. The two-time consensus
All-America bruised his right knee so
badlv Monday that doctors found it im
possible to take \-ravs. However, Eas
ley has been practicing lightly this
week, and should extend his streak ot
playing in 3" consecutive games. He
threw a prettv good scare into us," said
Donahue.
Usually Easlev throws pretty good
scares into opposing offenses. The
6-toot-3, 206-pounder roams farther
and wider on the field than probably
any defensive back can. Easley is as li
able to tackle a ballcarrier in the
backtield tor a loss as he is to snatch an

end-zone interception. Most people
call Easley a tree-lancer. Wiggin calls
him UCL-Xs key guy," a potential
Heisman Tropin winner.
In the blocking scheme, its \ ery dit
tic ult to account tor Easley because you
never know where he's going to be,
Wiggin said.
LJnlike Easley, UCLA's other top
player tailback Freeman McNeil is
easy to find. He'll always be at the back
ot the Bruins' l-tormation offense
and he II usually be the man the Bruins
give the ball to.
McNeil rushed tor 147 yards on 36
carries last year against the Cards, and
he has piled up 346 yards in three
games. When McNeil suffered a knee
in|ur\ and had to miss the Wisconsin
game freshman ke\in Nelson stepped
in and gained 123 yards. It the name
Nelson sounds familiar to you, it should
— ke\ in is the younger brother of Card
star Damn Nelson.
With McNeil in the backtield, the
Bruins don't need to pass very often.
But when they do, they don't have too
much trouble. UCLA quarterback Tom
Ramsey ranks as the Pac-10's leading
passer, mainly because he hasn't
thrown an interception in 45 attempts.
"San lose State did a great job of pas
sing and keeping their offense alive
with the run; UCLA does a great job ot
running the football and keeping its of
fense ali\ e with the pass," Wiggin said.

Donahue thinks that Stanford does a
great job v\ ith its ottense, period. I hey
just have too many weapons not to be
ranked in the top 10," he said ot the
Cards. "They're electrifying offen
sively. We really don't know how you
would stop them. Vou could say Boston
College stopped them, and they didn t
score 8H points against San lose State,
but that's in the Stanford tradition —
they'll play to the level of their oppo
nent."
The Bruin coach practically drools
when the subject turns to John Elway.
The Card quarterback leads the Pac-10
in touchdown passes with 11, but
Donahue obviously remembers last
year, when Elway completed 16 of 23
passes tor 178 yards against the Bruins.
"Before he's out of school, Elway will
definitely be a Heisman Trophy winner.
He can't miss," he said earlier this week
in the Los Angeles Times.
One is less assured, however, about
Stanford's defense. The Cards followed
a superior effort against Oklahoma with
a lackluster one last week against San
Jose State, and Wiggin said that a vic
tory over the Bruins will require the
type of performance the defense had
against the Sooners. "The big test will
be on our defense this week," Wiggin
affirmed.
It will be exciting to see which team
passes the test.

Moreover, both teams share a
three-year history ot playing games that

"They've just been the wildest games
I've ever coached in," Bruin headcoach
Terrv Donahue s.iid ot the Cardinal-

UCLA battles. "You |ust want to say,
'Let's forget the first 58 minutes and
play the last tvvo.'"
This season, however, the Bruins
have been quite adept during all 60 mi
nutes. Despite being one ot the teams
stowed in the Pac-10brig from confer
ence championship and bowl game
eligibility, UCLA has played with tervor.
Donahue downplayed the negative
ettect that the Bruins one-year suspen
sion might have. His players, the coach
said, "are not people you have to
dangle a carrot in tront of. They're
motivated from within . . . we've got 11
games, and we have to take advantage
ot all 11.
What the Bruins take advantage of
best are the remarkable talents of safety
Kenny Las lev. The two-time consensus
All-America bruised his right knee so
badlv Monday that doctors found it im
possible to take \-ravs. However, Eas
ley has been practicing lightly this
week, and should extend his streak ot
playing in 3" consecutive games. He
threw a prettv good scare into us," said
Donahue.
Usually Easlev throws pretty good
scares into opposing offenses. The
6-toot-3, 206-pounder roams farther
and wider on the field than probably
any defensive back can. Easley is as li
able to tackle a ballcarrier in the
backtield tor a loss as he is to snatch an

end-zone interception. Most people
call Easley a tree-lancer. Wiggin calls
him UCL-Xs key guy," a potential
Heisman Tropin winner.
In the blocking scheme, its \ ery dit
tic ult to account tor Easley because you
never know where he's going to be,
Wiggin said.
LJnlike Easley, UCLA's other top
player tailback Freeman McNeil is
easy to find. He'll always be at the back
ot the Bruins' l-tormation offense
and he II usually be the man the Bruins
give the ball to.
McNeil rushed tor 147 yards on 36
carries last year against the Cards, and
he has piled up 346 yards in three
games. When McNeil suffered a knee
in|ur\ and had to miss the Wisconsin
game freshman ke\in Nelson stepped
in and gained 123 yards. It the name
Nelson sounds familiar to you, it should
— ke\ in is the younger brother of Card
star Damn Nelson.
With McNeil in the backtield, the
Bruins don't need to pass very often.
But when they do, they don't have too
much trouble. UCLA quarterback Tom
Ramsey ranks as the Pac-10's leading
passer, mainly because he hasn't
thrown an interception in 45 attempts.
"San lose State did a great job of pas
sing and keeping their offense alive
with the run; UCLA does a great job ot
running the football and keeping its of
fense ali\ e with the pass," Wiggin said.

Donahue thinks that Stanford does a
great job v\ ith its ottense, period. I hey
just have too many weapons not to be
ranked in the top 10," he said ot the
Cards. "They're electrifying offen
sively. We really don't know how you
would stop them. Vou could say Boston
College stopped them, and they didn t
score 8H points against San lose State,
but that's in the Stanford tradition —
they'll play to the level of their oppo
nent."
The Bruin coach practically drools
when the subject turns to John Elway.
The Card quarterback leads the Pac-10
in touchdown passes with 11, but
Donahue obviously remembers last
year, when Elway completed 16 of 23
passes tor 178 yards against the Bruins.
"Before he's out of school, Elway will
definitely be a Heisman Trophy winner.
He can't miss," he said earlier this week
in the Los Angeles Times.
One is less assured, however, about
Stanford's defense. The Cards followed
a superior effort against Oklahoma with
a lackluster one last week against San
Jose State, and Wiggin said that a vic
tory over the Bruins will require the
type of performance the defense had
against the Sooners. "The big test will
be on our defense this week," Wiggin
affirmed.
It will be exciting to see which team
passes the test.
