# From a bum to number one: Terry Donahue's seen it all
## 
### 
(Lditor's note: Terry Donahue's
UCLA team finished 5-6 and
seventh in the Pac-10 last year.
They were not expected to do a
whole lot better this time
around. Surprise! The Uclan,
now 4-0, has roared to national
prominence this season in the
wake of an upset over highly
touted Ohio State last week.
They're rated sth in the country
this week and finally Donahue
can breath easily again as he
drives by unemployment of
fices. Everything is rosy again in
Westwood as UCLA psyches up
for Stanford. In this Friday In
terview with Mike Oneal, the
Bruin mentor discusses, in his
coach's tongue, this year's
team, the perils of coaching
and the Pac-10 suspension.)
Daily: What has happened to
the UCLA football squad this
year to bring it from a 5-6 team
to a 4-0 team?
Donahue:There are several
things. First ot all, we lost a lot
of players due to academic and
disciplinary problems. We've

had a very, very difficult year in
terms of that. But even though
we've lost some quality players
in terms of athletic ability, I
think we've improved the
overall attitude of our football
program. We've made sure
everyone here in the program
want to be here, and wants to
dedicate himself to doing the
things that we wanted to do.
Daily:VViis that a big problem
last year?
Donahue:l wouldn't say we had
a bad attitude last year. But I
would say we had some players
who put themselves ahead of
the team. That always hurts in a
team game like football.
The second thing that's
helped this year has been the
improved play of our quarter
back Tom Ramsey. He's a year
older and that makes a big dif
ference.
DailyrVou said in an interview
with the Associated Press this
week that no one on your team
wouldCQnsider UCLA a "great"
team. Do you think you're No. 5
national ranking this week is

warranted?
Donahue:Well, that brings up
the philosophical question
about the polls...The polls are

of real interest to the fans and
to the players somewhat. But
they don't have real credibility
until the end of the year.
Daily Are there only four teams

better than UCLA?
Donahue:l'd say in the United
States there are 44 teams that
could beat us. I really mean
that. I think the rest of us are in
a big pool-on any given day
anybody could beat us. That
includes Ohio State.
DaWy.Last year a lot of people
were calling for your job. This
year, with the team's improve
ment, people are kow-towing
to you. How has that made you
feel over the last couple of
weeks?
Donahue:Bad. I feel very sad
about that. I feel sad that athle
tics are like that but it's a fact of
life. You have to accept that,
which is why coaches become
cynical people and at times be
come isolationists. It's very dif
ficult because as Eisenhower
said, victory has 1000 fathers
but defeat is always an orphan.
Everybody is involved when
you win and no one will stand
up and get involved when you
lose. I mean, have I changed a
lot since last year? I don't think
so. So you become cynical

about that kind of thing it you
coach tor very long. Some
people do stay behind you, but
they're hard to identify.
Daily: Has the UCLA administ
ration stood behind you?
Donahue The administration
here has been very, very sup
portive.
Daily; How is the team reacting
to the Pac-10 suspension levied
against UCLA this year?
Donahue:l don't think any of
the Pac-10 teams that were
sanctioned by the conference
will fail to compete on any
given Saturday. They're not
rabbits that you have to dangle
a carrot in front of them to get
them to perform. They've
grown up in competitive sys
tems and they're used to com
petition. They'll do their very,
very best regardless of the fact
they can't go to the Rose Bowl
or any other bowl. It was a se
vere penalty, a very severe
penalty. It hurts a lot. But it
won't take off the competitive
edge. You can't legislate

against competition.
Daily: Did the suspension make
you re-evaluate your job as a
major college football coach?
Donahue: I haven't changed my
beliefs or philosophies at all.
What we did was accept the
penalty. Our transgression of

the rules occured in 1977, be
fore most of this team was
here. The hardest thing is to try
to explain to them that they
have to bear the burden ot that
penalty. That's difficult for an
athlete to understand-he can't
rationalize it very well.
