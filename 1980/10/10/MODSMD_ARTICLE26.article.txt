# Cavalli's choices are a Gym (Store) dandy
## 
### 
Anybody who spends much
time around Enema Gym has
doubtlessly encountered John
Cavalli. The ebullient Cym
Store manager has provided
Stanford folk with T-shirts,
shorts and other sporting
haberdashery for six years.
Cavalli, who bills himself as the
No. 1 Stanford sports fan - "Ar
dent. fanatical. It gets me sick, I
tell you," he said - was over
joyed to participate as today's
Guest Greek of the Week.
(JSC at Arizona: Arizona has

no quarterback, though I'd
love to pick them — I'm cer
tainly not a Southern Cal roo
ter. But being that the Arizona
quarterback will be tripping
over himself, I really believe
that USC will win.
Washington St. at Arizona St.:
That'stough. ASU is coming off
a psychological win, a — what
do you call that? A "moral vic
tory" — they want to prove
themselves in front of the
home crowd. It'll be a wide
open, wild-scoring game.

Oregon at California: My
heart tells me that Oregon will
kill them. But Cal's losing all
those games; they're gonna
win one someday. But there's
no way I'm going to pick Cal.
Oregon should beat them
pretty handily. Because of
Campbell — he's a good quar
terback — we'll give Cal 20
points.
Washington at Oregon State:
Poor Oregon State. And I
shouldn't say that because they
really beat us last year. They're

both "mudders," and I think
Washington is the better mud
der.
Stanford at UCLA: Stanford is
not going to lose another game
this year. That's including the
Rose Bowl. I thought from the
beginning that this would be
our toughest Pac-10 game. I'm
scared as hell of Easley, but
outside of Freeman McNeil,
they don't have too much of
fense, though I would like to
see Darrin's little brother do
well.
