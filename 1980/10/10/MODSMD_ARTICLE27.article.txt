## Cards begin league race at USC, UCLA 
### 
By Sally (enkins
Coach Dante Dettamanti and his Stanford water polo team
head south this weekend for what is traditionally the toughest
road trip of the season. The Cards open their Pacitic-10 Confer
ence schedule today against USC in Long Beach, then travel to
UCLA tomorrow morning to face the Bruins.
Stanford defeated both teams in preseason games at the UC-
Irvine Invitational, edging USC by two goals and beating UCLA by
five. Dettamanti describes his immediate goals as "First, to win
our league games, and also to get the number one seed in the
Nationals. If you don't win these games (UCLA and USC) you
don't go to the national championships."

It is difficult to tell which of the two teams presents the greatest
clanger to Stanford at this point. The preseason contest between
Stanford and UCLA was not the best of indicators because both
teams were missing a starter as a result of injuries.
However, "UCLA did upset us last year," Dettamanti said.
"They seem to save their psyche for league games." The UCLA
team apparently went so far as to shave their bodies before last
season's encounter.
Although USC had a comparatively poor preseason — they tied
Cal, and lost to Stanford and UC-lrvine — they seem to be a force
to reckon with, at least in their own minds. Six of their seven
players are returning seniors, so they are possibly justified in
expecting a successful season.
"They will be tough. This is their big year and they will be going
for it," Dettamanti said. "They have been talking about having a
great season for three years. If they don't do it now they won't
because they will have a very young team next season."
One of Stanford's main advantages seems to be their reputa
tion as a team that scores well from the outside, which could
open up opportunities on the inside for post man Jody Campbell
and gunner lames Bergeson. Bergeson will make his first appear
ance in two weeks (he injured an elbow in preseason); De
ttamanti considers him to be about 85 percent recovered. Though
he has been working with the team in practice, Bergeson is not
yet shooting the ball at full strength.
