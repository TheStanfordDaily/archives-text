Kansas City (AP) — The Kan
sas City Royals strung together
tour straight tuts in the third
inning, including Willie Wil
son's two-run triple and an KB I
double by U.l . Washington,
and held on to edge the New
York Yankees i-2 last night for
a commanding 2-0 lead in the
best-ot-five American League
Championship Series.
Dennis Leonard, Kansas Ci
ty's only 20-game winner, scat
tered seven hits before giving
way to Dan Quisenberry, top
reliever in the AL this year, fol
lowing Reggie Jackson's
leadoff single in the ninth.
Leonard, a hard-throwing
29-year-old right-hander who
was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., re
tired the Yankees in order in

live innings.
He yielded a pair ot harmless
singles in the second. He set
tled down to retire eight bat
ters in a row alter the Yankees
scored twice in the fifth inning
on Graig Nettles' inside-the
park home run, Leonard's only
walk ot the game and Willie

AL playoffs

Randolph's RBI double.
The Yankees had the poten
tial tying run thrown out at the
pi ate tor the final out of the
eighth inning thanks to some
quick Kansas City fielding.
Randolph singled with one
out. Alter Bobby Murcer struck
out, Bob Watson ripped a drive

that bounced oil the base of
the lett field wall.
Randolph, one ot New
York's tastest runners, was on
the move with two out, but left
fielder Wilson, the speediest
man in baseball, retrieved the
ball quickly and fired it to third
baseman George Brett. Brett's
relay to catcher Darrell Porter
was in time to nail Randolph.
Jackson opened the top of
the ninth with a single, c basing
Leonard. Quisenberry, whose
submarine delivery enabled
him to tie for the league lead
with 33 saves, retired Oscar
Gamble on a soft pop fly, but
Rick Cerone lined a single over
short, moving Jackson to sec
ond. However, Nettles rapped
the first pitch sharply to second

baseman Frank White. He jug
gled it for a split second, but
tired to shortstop Washington
tor one out, and tirst baseman
Willie Mays Aikens dug
Washington's relay out ot the
dirt.
With one out in the third,
Porter lined a single to right
field, and White's grounder
skipped through the right side
on the artitic ial turf for another

single as Porter stopped at sec •
ond.
Wilson, who doubled home
the tinal two runs in the Royals'
7-2 opening-game victory,
laced an opposite-tield smash
down the tirst base line, and
Porter and White scored as the
fleet Wilson easily made it to
third. He scored the decisive
run when Washington laced a
double.
