# Voters to decide on gay rights ordinance
## 
### Samuel Howe 
After a night of often emotional
public testimony the Palo Alto City
Council decided Monday to put a
controversial gay rights ordinance on
the ballot next March, rather than
voting on it themselves.
The proposed ordinance would
make illegal discrimination in hous
ing and employment on the basis of
"sexual orientation.".
Palo Alto voters will thus vote on a
measure resembling a law struck
down by Santa Clara County voters in
June. That measure lost in Palo Alto
by less than 300 votes.
The council also decided to halt a
recent surge of attempted con
dominium conversions in the city
until the council receives recom
mendations from the city attorney on
how to plug various loopholes in
existing laws.
The current ordinance allows con
versions only if there is a 3 per
cent or higher vacancy rate in the
city's apartments or it two-thirds or
more of a building's tenants agree to
the conversion.
The city's vacancy rate is less than I
percent and has not been more than
1.6 percent since 1974.
Meanwhile, a council committee
rejected on Tuesday night another
proposal to annex Stanford, because
the move would represent a net loss
for the city. The committee's re
commendation will go to the full
council Nov. 3.
Gays, opponents testify
The council heard three hours of
testimony on the gay rights proposal
from local residents, most of whom
spoke in favor of the ordinance. Sev
eral said they should not be forced to
suffer because of their sexual prefer
ences.
"I'm tired of living a lie," a man
told the crowd of 150. "Why should I
be penalized, not to havea means for
earning a living, for coming out."
Others said discrimination was
clearly present in area housing and
that the ordinance is needed to re

lieve it.
Those who opposed the ordinance
said it might further single out a spe
cial class, ultimately hurting rather
than helping their group. And some
said they feared a large influx of
homosexuals into the community.
The council decided by a 6-2 mar
gin to put the vote to the public.
Mayor Alan Henderson criticized
other council members for not tak
ing a stand on the issue. "I don't be
lieve we should sit here to protect
our political lives," said Henderson.
Condo-conversion ban
The ban on condominium conver
sion is not likely to have any serious
affect on the University, which is not
currently engaged in any major plans
at conversion of University-owned
apartments, according to Phil Wil
liams, director of planning for the
University.
The council also exempted from
the moratorium the Oak Creek
Apartments, which are on Stanford
land but not owned by the University
until |uly 1981. Council members de
cided to refrain from interfering with
conversion projects if notices have
already been sent to tenants, as the
owners of Oak Creek have done.
However, if plans have not been im
plemented by next July, the
moratorium will go into effect there.
Annexation issue
If the city was to make a serious
attempt at annexation of University
lands, a large political controversy
would probably develop on campus.
However, it does appear likely that
such an attempt will be made. City
Manager William Zaner has said that
annexation of a residential area such
as Stanford would be costly. "There
is no question it will be a net
economic loss," according to Zaner.
And council member Gary Fazzino
chairman of the policy and proce
dures committee, said that he has
"not seen a great groundswell of
support from residents on the is
sue."

would probably develop on campus.
However, it does appear likely that
such an attempt will be made. City
Manager William Zaner has said that
annexation of a residential area such
as Stanford would be costly. "There
is no question it will be a net
economic loss," according to Zaner.
And council member Gary Fazzino
chairman of the policy and proce
dures committee, said that he has
"not seen a great groundswell of
support from residents on the is
sue."
After a night of often emotional
public testimony the Palo Alto City
Council decided Monday to put a
controversial gay rights ordinance on
the ballot next March, rather than
voting on it themselves.
The proposed ordinance would
make illegal discrimination in hous
ing and employment on the basis of
"sexual orientation.".
Palo Alto voters will thus vote on a
measure resembling a law struck
down by Santa Clara County voters in
June. That measure lost in Palo Alto
by less than 300 votes.
The council also decided to halt a
recent surge of attempted con
dominium conversions in the city
until the council receives recom
mendations from the city attorney on
how to plug various loopholes in
existing laws.
The current ordinance allows con
versions only if there is a 3 per
cent or higher vacancy rate in the
city's apartments or it two-thirds or
more of a building's tenants agree to
the conversion.
The city's vacancy rate is less than I
percent and has not been more than
1.6 percent since 1974.
Meanwhile, a council committee
rejected on Tuesday night another
proposal to annex Stanford, because
the move would represent a net loss
for the city. The committee's re
commendation will go to the full
council Nov. 3.
Gays, opponents testify
The council heard three hours of
testimony on the gay rights proposal
from local residents, most of whom
spoke in favor of the ordinance. Sev
eral said they should not be forced to
suffer because of their sexual prefer
ences.
"I'm tired of living a lie," a man
told the crowd of 150. "Why should I
be penalized, not to havea means for
earning a living, for coming out."
Others said discrimination was
clearly present in area housing and
that the ordinance is needed to re

lieve it.
Those who opposed the ordinance
said it might further single out a spe
cial class, ultimately hurting rather
than helping their group. And some
said they feared a large influx of
homosexuals into the community.
The council decided by a 6-2 mar
gin to put the vote to the public.
Mayor Alan Henderson criticized
other council members for not tak
ing a stand on the issue. "I don't be
lieve we should sit here to protect
our political lives," said Henderson.
Condo-conversion ban
The ban on condominium conver
sion is not likely to have any serious
affect on the University, which is not
currently engaged in any major plans
at conversion of University-owned
apartments, according to Phil Wil
liams, director of planning for the
University.
The council also exempted from
the moratorium the Oak Creek
Apartments, which are on Stanford
land but not owned by the University
until |uly 1981. Council members de
cided to refrain from interfering with
conversion projects if notices have
already been sent to tenants, as the
owners of Oak Creek have done.
However, if plans have not been im
plemented by next July, the
moratorium will go into effect there.
Annexation issue
If the city was to make a serious
attempt at annexation of University
lands, a large political controversy
would probably develop on campus.
However, it does appear likely that
such an attempt will be made. City
Manager William Zaner has said that
annexation of a residential area such
as Stanford would be costly. "There
is no question it will be a net
economic loss," according to Zaner.
And council member Gary Fazzino
chairman of the policy and proce
dures committee, said that he has
"not seen a great groundswell of
support from residents on the is
sue."
