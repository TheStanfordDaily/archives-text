Houston (AP) — The National
League Championship Series
switched artificial surfaces ves
terday, moving trom Philadel
phia s Veteran s Stadium to the
Houston Astrodome a house
ot horrors tor \ isiting c lubs this
season.
It's a pleasure to be going
home/' said Houston Manager
Hill Yirdon, whose Astros split
the first two games in this
best-ot-tive pennant plavott at
Philadelphia.

NL playoffs

It should be a pleasure. The
Astros were awesome at home
this season, compiling a 55-2b
record under the dome, com
pared to 38-44 on the road.
That doesn't scare the Phil

lies though. They won 21 ot
their last 28 games on the road
to finish 42-}') away trom
home, their best road record
since 197b.
We've played down there
before, you know,'' snapped
Philadelphia Manager Dallas
Green. "It's not as it we're
doing something completely
new. We're 9-} tor the year
against the Astros. We must
have won some down there."
In tact, the Phillies have won
tour ot six under the dome in
each of the past two seasons.
More important than playing
indoors is the state ot mind the
Phillies will bring with them tor
Came Three ot this series to
day. They lost a game they
should have won Wednesday
night, leaving 14 runners on

base, 10ot them in the last lour
innings. They had the bases
loaded with one out in the
seventh and did not score and
the bases loaded with one out
in the ninth and did not score.
The 7-4, 10-inning loss in
Came Two can stay with a
team, but the Phillies insist it
will not stay with them.
"We gotta forget about tins
and just play like nothing hap
pened, said shortstop Larry
Bowa.
"We just didn't do it," said
slugger Mike Schmidt, who
was the tying run at the plate
when he flied to right ending
the game. "We can't worry
about opportunities getting
away. We just did not get the
job done, that's all."
Schmidt said Wednesday's

failures will be torgotten by to
day.
I don t believein a lot ot talk
about pressure and momen
tum,'' he said. "It's no factor
onee you walk out on the field.
What's [last is past, that's all."
Pitcher 1 ugMcGrawand tirst
baseman Pete Rose, lull oi
pleasantries in the otten grim
Phillies' dressing room which
has been described by some
visitors as a demilitarized /one,
tried to lighten the load ot the
painful loss.
"We just don't want our tans
to get overconfident, that's
all," offered McGraw. "It we
had won (Wednesday), the
third game would have been an
anti-climax. We wanted to
build the suspense, you see."
