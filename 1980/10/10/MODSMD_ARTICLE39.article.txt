Falling in Place

342 pp. $10.95

Ann Beattie completed Fal
ling in Place in just seven
weeks — and says she despises
novel writing. "It's backbreak
ing work. I don't know how to
do it. It takes too long."
In the past several years,
Beattie has been quite success
ful with her short stories, many
of which have appeared in the
New Yorker.
Still, what has worked so
well in the short story can be
far less effective in the novel.
While Beattie's eye for detail
is excellent, details tend to ac
cumulate in her novel without
accomplishing anything. We
know every object on a charac
ter's bookshelf, for instance,
but her emotional core re
mains elusive.
Some of the chapter transi
tions are awkward; quick shifts
that move her stories along are

often jerky and out of place
and the episodic form be
comes haphazard.
Beattie also has an excep
tional ear for dialogue; yet at
times her overtondness for
non-sequiturs makes conver
sations hard to follow and
character distinctions vague,
since everyone seems to think
and speak in the same dis
jointed, unpredictable way.
"If a woman goes to the air
port and no one knows she's
there, does she still exist at the
airport?"
This query, found in the
middle of a banal phone con
versation might give the reader
insight into the speaker's
character, except for the tact
that someone else in the novel
might have said something
similar.
The omniscient point of view
becomes befuddling rather
than enlightening; we move in
and out of so many conscious
nesses so rapidly that at times
we forget who is thinking or
speaking, and their in
scrutabililty leaves the reader

distant and contused.
Beattie's characters are often
referred to as "survivors ot the
'60s drifting through the 705,"
unwilling or unable to take
control of their lives. The
people in Falling in Place are
aimless and apathetic, loosely
connected by relationships
that are characterized by frust
ration, untulfillment and a lack
of understanding.
The story, set in New York
and suburban Connecticut, re
volves around the Knapp fam
ily and assorted others — lov
ers, friends, summer school
teachers. Like a collection of
uncharged molecules, they
bounce around, colliding or
brushing past each other but
never quite bonding together.
John Knapp wants to marry
his young lover Nina but can't
seem to initiate the breakup ol
his unhappy marriage. His wife
Louise, meanwhile, is deter
mined to remain bitter, sarcas
tic and miserable, resolving
only that, "she would find out
what was going on with John
when he left her."

Their two older children hate
each other, and although the
youngest child lives with his
grandmother, we don't really
know why. "It was argued
about for a year, and then they
stopped arguing. For the last
two years, they hadn't talked
much."
All of the characters are dis
satisfied with their lives for one
reason or another — they hate
their jobs, they're in love with
their best friends lover — but
still they wait for changes to
happen by themselves.
Beattie has been accused of

portraying bizarre, eccentric
characters — a 12-year-old
pokes a hole in his mother's
diaphragm — yet Falling in
Place seems to have
homogenized itself; gathering
the eccentrics together makes
their mutual idiosyncracies
seem less unique.
As a chronicler of the pre
sent, however, Beattie offers
some subtle yet serious social
comments on the irony of con
temporary freedoms. Falling in
Place seems to illustrate quite
vividly how oppressive the

freedom of self-expression can
be when people can say what
ever they happen to be think
ing or feeling and still be com
pletely misunderstood, and
when people can persistently
call each other on the tele
phone and still be unable to
communicate.
A few ot the characters in Fal
ling in Place tinally do land in
the 'right' places. As for the
others, they are lett floating —
still waiting for gravity or
chance to make them fall into
place too.

"If a woman goes to the air
port and no one knows she's
there, does she still exist at the
airport?"
This query, found in the
middle of a banal phone con
versation might give the reader
insight into the speaker's
character, except for the tact
that someone else in the novel
might have said something
similar.
The omniscient point of view
becomes befuddling rather
than enlightening; we move in
and out of so many conscious
nesses so rapidly that at times
we forget who is thinking or
speaking, and their in
scrutabililty leaves the reader

distant and contused.
Beattie's characters are often
referred to as "survivors ot the
'60s drifting through the 705,"
unwilling or unable to take
control of their lives. The
people in Falling in Place are
aimless and apathetic, loosely
connected by relationships
that are characterized by frust
ration, untulfillment and a lack
of understanding.
The story, set in New York
and suburban Connecticut, re
volves around the Knapp fam
ily and assorted others — lov
ers, friends, summer school
teachers. Like a collection of
uncharged molecules, they
bounce around, colliding or
brushing past each other but
never quite bonding together.
John Knapp wants to marry
his young lover Nina but can't
seem to initiate the breakup ol
his unhappy marriage. His wife
Louise, meanwhile, is deter
mined to remain bitter, sarcas
tic and miserable, resolving
only that, "she would find out
what was going on with John
when he left her."

Their two older children hate
each other, and although the
youngest child lives with his
grandmother, we don't really
know why. "It was argued
about for a year, and then they
stopped arguing. For the last
two years, they hadn't talked
much."
All of the characters are dis
satisfied with their lives for one
reason or another — they hate
their jobs, they're in love with
their best friends lover — but
still they wait for changes to
happen by themselves.
Beattie has been accused of

portraying bizarre, eccentric
characters — a 12-year-old
pokes a hole in his mother's
diaphragm — yet Falling in
Place seems to have
homogenized itself; gathering
the eccentrics together makes
their mutual idiosyncracies
seem less unique.
As a chronicler of the pre
sent, however, Beattie offers
some subtle yet serious social
comments on the irony of con
temporary freedoms. Falling in
Place seems to illustrate quite
vividly how oppressive the

freedom of self-expression can
be when people can say what
ever they happen to be think
ing or feeling and still be com
pletely misunderstood, and
when people can persistently
call each other on the tele
phone and still be unable to
communicate.
A few ot the characters in Fal
ling in Place tinally do land in
the 'right' places. As for the
others, they are lett floating —
still waiting for gravity or
chance to make them fall into
place too.
Falling in Place
Ann Beattie

342 pp. $10.95

Ann Beattie completed Fal
ling in Place in just seven
weeks — and says she despises
novel writing. "It's backbreak
ing work. I don't know how to
do it. It takes too long."
In the past several years,
Beattie has been quite success
ful with her short stories, many
of which have appeared in the
New Yorker.
Still, what has worked so
well in the short story can be
far less effective in the novel.
While Beattie's eye for detail
is excellent, details tend to ac
cumulate in her novel without
accomplishing anything. We
know every object on a charac
ter's bookshelf, for instance,
but her emotional core re
mains elusive.
Some of the chapter transi
tions are awkward; quick shifts
that move her stories along are

often jerky and out of place
and the episodic form be
comes haphazard.
Beattie also has an excep
tional ear for dialogue; yet at
times her overtondness for
non-sequiturs makes conver
sations hard to follow and
character distinctions vague,
since everyone seems to think
and speak in the same dis
jointed, unpredictable way.
