## 
### Joan O'Connell 
Despite its own $40,000 detic it, the
University's Office of Public Events
has offered to contract with the ASSU
to provide contemporary musical
concerts here, according to Public
Events Director Vicky Holt.
Holt, following a meeting with
University officials two weeks ago,
submitted a sketchy proposal to the
Council ot Presidents (COP) stating
that her office might consider taking
over the production and promotion
of some concerts if there was strong
student desire tor them.
Public Events already presents
classical music concerts, dance and
theater programs here through the
Lively Arts at Stanford program.
At the time the proposal was made,
the future of ASSU Special Events —
the student-run concert promoting
group — was doubtful, following
ASSU Financial Manager Steve Davis'
disclosure that the project had re
corded a $90,000 deficit. Wednesday
evening, the ASSU finance commit
tee voted unanimously to close the
project and the full senate is ex
pected to accept the committee's re
commendation at its Oct. 15 meet
ing.
"Not only are we equipped to as
sume the promoting of contempor
ary concerts, but we are professional
arts management people," Holt said
yesterday.
However, she also admitted that
Public Events has experienced finan
cial difficulties of its own this year
which have created a $40,000 deficit
in its program budget.
John hiughes, associate director
tor the program, said although the
deficit in the office's approximately
$500,000 annual budget was substan
tial, it was no cause for alarm.
"It's a recurrent phenomenon in a

cyclical economy," Hughes said.
Holt said low ticket sales tor sum
mer programs, which she attributed
to the recession, leci to the deficit.
She also noted that the office, which
produces the travel film series,
commencement and the endowed
lecture series in addition to the Lively
Arts, experienced some personnel
changes which attec ted the budget.
Ellie Oppenheim, director of Tre
sidder Union, stressed that the offer
was on an "interim" basis until the
ASSU decides on a course of action.
Oppenheim, along with Dean of
Student Attairs lames Lyons, Asst.
Dean of Student Attairs Thomas Mas
sey, Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Freelen, and Holt
have been involved in the discus
ions.
COP members Marc Ventresca
and Dayna Goldfine said yesterday
Holt's proposal "looks like a good
option but it's only one of several
good options."
The task force, made up of rep
resentatives from the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs office, STARTS, the ASSU
Senate, the COP, a student commit
tee member from Public Events and
an af-large student, will meet for the
first time tonight and should report
its findings no later than December,
Goldfine said.
Holt also said there may be some
way lor a new project to take advan
tage ot the more professional advice
and accounting available in the Of
fice of Public Events.
As for the Public Events deficit,
Holt said future deficits will be pre
vented through an increased fun
draising effort by the office to estab
lish a reserve fund. This effort will
lead to more foundation and
corporation-sponsored programs
she added.

sey, Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Freelen, and Holt
have been involved in the discus
ions.
COP members Marc Ventresca
and Dayna Goldfine said yesterday
Holt's proposal "looks like a good
option but it's only one of several
good options."
The task force, made up of rep
resentatives from the Dean of Stu
dent Affairs office, STARTS, the ASSU
Senate, the COP, a student commit
tee member from Public Events and
an af-large student, will meet for the
first time tonight and should report
its findings no later than December,
Goldfine said.
Holt also said there may be some
way lor a new project to take advan
tage ot the more professional advice
and accounting available in the Of
fice of Public Events.
As for the Public Events deficit,
Holt said future deficits will be pre
vented through an increased fun
draising effort by the office to estab
lish a reserve fund. This effort will
lead to more foundation and
corporation-sponsored programs
she added.
