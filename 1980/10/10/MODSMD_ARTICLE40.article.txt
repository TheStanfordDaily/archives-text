Alvin Tottler is, tirst and
foremost, a writer and an
eloquent one at that. Howe\ er,
Tottler is also a brilliant thinker
with considerable integrative
abilities.
Both ot these qualities are
clearly expressed in Tottler s
latest book, The Ihird Wave.
The Third Wave is a book
both about the past and about
the future. But in a deeper
sense, it is mostly a book about
the present.
It is also a book I would re
commend unhesitatingly to
every man, woman and child
(well, ok, skip the kids) on the
planet, for it puts some ot to
day's most pressing world
problems in a perspective
which is not only compellinglv
accurate, but demands further
study and examination it we
are to have any hope ot per
ceiving the tuture optimisti

cally.
The "wave" referred to in
the title is a c omplex set ot new
technologies, values, ideas
and behaviors which is slowly
emerging in modern industrial
societies. These technologies,
\ allies, ideas and behaviors
may have enough impact on
society to provide the genesis
lor a radically new t\pe ot
civilization, a civilization the
likes of which may seem in
conceivable to us today.
Before I go any further, a dis
claimer is necessary. Tottler
makes\ery plain at the tirst that
he is not looking into any c rys
tal ball and making predic
tions. To distinguish good fu
tures literature from bad. one
must make the distinction be
tween prediction and forecast
ing. Futurists, like Herman
kahn, who espouse
technological optimism to its
limits and beyond, do more
predicting than forecasting.
To forecast possible futures,
as Tottler and other respected
futurists do, is a serious
academic attempt to address

important issues which have
relevance for tuture policy de
cisions, not just a prettv sci
ence fiction storv about what
the tuture will be like if this or
thai critical trend continues.
Tottler looks at trends going
far beyond the kind ot simplis
tic analysis which is the
dow ntall ot too much ot the lit
erature on the tuture. The
Third Wave is not a whimsical
adventure; it is a serious sys
tematic piece of soc lal forecast
ing supported bv massive evi
dence, well researched and
thoroughly examined. Tottler s
bibliography is a compendium
ot over t(X) \ olumes on a broad
range ot topics.
The Thud Wave weaves to
gether the essential threads ot
modern society, producing a
tightly integrated, internally
consistent model ot the most
revolutionary stages ot man's
development.
Now, back to the wave
metaphor. The choice ot a
wave as a metaphor tor this

emerging society is a good
one. lor it is in this context
the c ollision ot vvav es — thai
Tot tier's prov ides a glimmer ot
meaning and order to the
seemingly c haotic nature ot
world events todav.
The natural question at this
point is: what is the Third
Wave? or, to go further, what
were the first and Second
Waves? Answer: Io Toftler, the
first Wave was the first great
revolution in human civiliza
tion the Agricultural Revolu
tion, which transformed a
world of mobile bands of
hunter-gatherers into primarily
sedentary, centrally-organized
communities, giving rise to a
plethora of new technologies,
values and institutions.
Society was irreversibly
changed in many ways and
these changes still influenced
peoples' conceptions of reality
until the next great upheaval
occurred. This was the Indust
rial Revolution, Tottler's Sec
ond Wave.
Like the First Wave before it,

the Second Wave altered the
nature ot civili/ation, radically
c hanging our \ lew ot the world
and the way we lived in it. But
this long process ot industriali
zation — and all it's related
components — did not come
easily, for example, the Civil
War, in Tottler's view, was
more than |ust a battle over the
moral issue ot slavery or the
economic one ot taritts. It was
(ought over a much larger is
sue: would a rich, new conti
nent be ruled by farmers or in
dustrialists? Before an answer
was finally reached, a country
had been ripped apart at the
seams.
And that, it nothing else, is
the greatest raison d'etre tor
reading Tottler's book. Not
that he puts a new light on the
Civil War, tor that view is not
new. But rather, Toffler's book
is essential tor bringing to light
issues which we must resolve
and resolve quickly.
Industrial society, argues
Tottler, with its emphasis on
mass production, mass educa
tion, concentration and cen
tralization of wealth, power
and resources, based around
the de-humanizing institution
of the factory, is dying. Its en
gine has run out of fuel, or
nearly so. Meanwhile, the pro
cesses and principles which
perpetuated "indust-rea//fy"
are crumbling under the

weight of new trends decen
tralized media and energv
sources, new notions ol c ausa
tion, and most important, new
technologies sue h as are c reat
ing revolutions in computers,
c ommunic at ions, space explo
ration, biological engineering,
and a host of others.
This emerging c iv ilization
demands a whole new set of
values, institutions and lifes
tyles, many clashing violently

with the last vestiges ol indust
rial civilization.
Whether we survive the next
several decades will, in large
part, depend on how effec
tively and how soon we begin
dealing with these issues and

(ontlifts. Vw 1 lurii U.n e gives
us ,ii ontext in whit h to resok e
these issues, hopelulh lor the
good oi more than a handiul oi
powerlul elites.
Alter reading the hook, I
guarantee you will never \ leu
the world in quite the same
way (unless you totally denv
what Tottler is really saying,
whit h I douhtl. Newspaper ar
ticles will take on nev\ meaning
in the context ol Folder's vis
ion. Political issues, economic
decisions and a view ol our
place in the world will all re
lied new sets oi tonterns,
once one sees how to break
out ol the view ol reality that
has been drilled into us since
birth.
The book, written in a lively
yet not overpowering style, is
lairly long. Take your time and
read it carefully. Not since
Marx has there been such a
stunning work of sot ial evalua
tion and t ritique.
Today we speak of the in
dustrial world as "developed"
and the Third World as "de
veloping."
Doesn't it seem a bit odd to
think that we in the industrial
nations have "developed," as
11 we have no further to go^
