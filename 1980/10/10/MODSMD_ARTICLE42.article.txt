Allegro ISon Troppo ****
Saturday, Cubberley
Bruno Bozzetto directed this
parody of Disney's Fantasia It's
more than "just" a parody, how
ever— A llegro Non Troppo can
stand on its own as a masterful
work of animation Like the Dis
ney film, Allegro is an anthology
of animation inspired by classical
music. But Bozetto's work has a
wit and bite to it that the Disney
film, for all of its technical profi
ciency, lacks
The film's highlight is an outline
of evolution set to Ravel's Bolero.
All life on earth begins from a few
drops of primordial slime spilled
from a coke bottle: it may be the
most effective retelling of the
story of creation ever filmed

Cleo from Five to Seven ***
Thursday, Stanford Women's Cen
ter
One of the cinema's rare ex
plorations into "real-time." The
two-hour running length of the film
documents two hours in the life of
Cleo, a woman who thinks she is
dying. Agnes Varda directed so
that we can feel the world as this
woman feels it: we leave the thea
ter feeling that we have shared
two hours of another person's life.
Corinne Marchand plays Cleo.
Plays with Health Caring and
The Yellow Wallpaper.

North By Northwest ★★★★
Fox Theater, Redwood City
This superb Hitchcock thriller
finds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual—
the working title was not North by
Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln 's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi

nessman forced into flight after he
is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties, plays a woman of uncer
tain loyalties who finds her life
thrown into the same "alphabet
soup" (the FBI. the CIA .) as
Grant's.
Everything gels—the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehmann's
dialogue is polished and witty, and
Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant
Plays Tuesday and Wednesday
with another Hitchcock classic.
To Catch a Thief.

Yojimbo
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Pauline Kael calls Yojimbo the
"first great shaggy-man movie."
The shaggy man in question is
Toshiro Mifune, playing a samurai
warrior who wanders into town
ready to be hired by whoever will
pay him most. It's a switch on the
standard western format, where
the hired gun represents either the
good or the bad; here both sides
are bad, and the samurai is happy
to assist them in wiping each other
out. The pace is set by the film's
first scene, where a dog comes out
carrying a human hand instead of
a bone.
The very great Akira Kurosawa
directed. Plays Tuesday and
Wednesday, with Sanjuro.

Somewhere in Time
Old Mill, Mountain View
A timeless tale of romantic
love, Somewhere in Time goes
beyond time and beyond taste. Al
though not quite in the Xanadu

class of wretched movies, this one
comes close
Christopher (Superman) Reeve
stars as a playwright who becomes
infatuated with Jane Seymour;
trouble is. she s been dead for
eight years. Director Jeannot
(Jaws 2) Szwarc avoids the
necrophilia issue by having his
hero go back in time to retrieve the
object of his affections
Watch for the sequel: The Love
that Wouldn 't Die

One Heu- Over the Cuckoo'*
Nest
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey may not like it. but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed. Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Hatched battl
ing and, aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with.
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and Nich
olson's portrayal of a man with a
kooky (because he's too sane?)
fire burning within him power this
most basic and kinetic conflicts.
Starts Thursday.

My Brilliant Career **★
Fox. Redwood City
Judy Davis gives a fine per
formance as a young Australian
woman with literary ambitions
forced to choose between a rich
husband and life on a rather
squalid sheep ranch. Her choice is
more difficult than one might

think, though, because it is dic
tated by nothing less than service
to art The movie suffers a little
from its own good intentions—in
trying not to be feminist," it
leaves the motives underlying her
decision anything but clear
Davis's portrayal of a woman far
ahead of her time, and much
gorgeous Australian scenery, hap
pily drive considerations of plot
from our minds Plays with
Cousin, Cousine Sunday and Mon
day only.

La Cage Aux Folles
Sunday, Mem Aud
When your future
is the undersecretary of public mo
rality, how do you explain the six
foot dildo in the living room'' Or
the fishnet stockings on the butler?
Or your mother's beard?
A Guess Who's Comity to Din
ner for the '70s, but much funnier
and much less offensive, Ugo
Tagnazzi and Michel Serrault star.
For those who find Sunday a bad
night. La Cage aux Falien con
tinues its long run at the Fine* Arts

Stardust Memories
Palo Alto Square
In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbingas In
teriors ; the' structure is as loose as
Bananas The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.

After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes There are jokes in Stardust
Memories-— some great ones—but
Allen s prediction captures the
feel of his latest film Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline Its also among the
year's best films

The Elephant Mart *"***
Royal Theater. San Francisco
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
fflm. another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shod* value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
M«rrick comports himself despite
ms grotescjueness. Not a horror
Story, but a moving tale of human
' love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown

The Great Santini ** \
Aquarius, Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by;an ending
that renders pointless everything
that went before. Robert Duval
plays at Marine colonel who .ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much so good but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up You

might want to consider going out
for popcorn when it becomes ap
parent that the movie s drawingto
a close F

The Empire Striken Hack **
Old Mill Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most ol its sense of humor. Every
thing has become deadly serious
bigger. brighter, splashier, and
dull
All the old performers are hack,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned muppet
creature that, for an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending -
jeepers. George, couldn't you have
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work''

" The first of the James Bond
mojrt€s—at about a tenth of the
cmt of the latest, Moonraker. But
Connery more than makes up
for toy possible deficiencies with
a typically suave performance in
this slyly well-made thriller. In
contrast to the latest Bond movies.
Dp No can at least claim to be wit
ty. Like all of the good Bond pic
tures, this one's a helluva lot of
fun. Plays tonight and tomorrow
night at midnight
