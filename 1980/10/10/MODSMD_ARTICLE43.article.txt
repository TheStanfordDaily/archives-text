Begin decries Soviet-Syrian treaty
lerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Meruchem Begin
said yesterday that the "friendship and cooperation tre
aty" signed this week between Syria and the Soviet
Union includes a secret military agreement.
The treaty, Begin said, "is a very dangerous develop
ment which is directed first against Israel — but also
concerns the whole tree world.
The prime minister did not c ite his source tor informa
tion about the military pact. Such reports, however,
have also been emanating from sources within the Sy
rian government in Damascus.
Israel radio, which is government-owned but inde
pendently operated, said that the reports of the new
treaty "will no doubt strengthen Begin s view that Israel
must retain security control of the occupied West Bank
and must not give up the Golan Heights.' The Golan
Heights, formerly owned by Syria, and the West Bank of
the Jordan River were occupied by Israel in 1%7.
Begin made his comments at an impromptu meeting
with newsmen outside his office and repeated them last
night at a dinner meeting of United Jewish Appeal (UJA)
fund-raisers visiting lerusalem.
He said he would consult with the United States about
the treaty next month.
"We can say with certainty that there is a secret pact,"
Begin told the UJA meeting.
Carter softens his attacks on Reagan
President )immy Carter went public with his softer,
toned-down attack on Ronald Reagan yesterday, but
independent John Anderson declared, "It's too late,"
and insisted the president's chances ot holding on to the
White House are fading.
Carter's rhetoric was milder as he began a two-day
Southern campaign swing in Tennessee, while Reagan,
in St. Louis, declared that, "I am an environmen
talist. ... I am for clean air." But the Republican candi
date renewed his attack on the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, which he said sometimes insists on "un
reasonable and many times untried standards' to clean
up the air.
Reagan also turned down an invitation by a Tampa,
Fla., television station tora "joint appearance" with Car
ter while both men are in Florida today. Carter accepted
the proposal, in which he and Reagan would answer
questions from different locations, but Reagan's
spokesman said there'd be no deal unless Anderson is
included.
The independent candidate campaigned in New York,

where he told a news conference that Carter apparently
had concluded that his "base and almost desperate at
tacks" on his rivals are not succeeding, so he is changing
his tune.
Anderson blasted Reagan tor making "an obvious and
calculated effort to move toward the center by aban
doning long-held, far-right positions.
Carter's new, gentler campaign style was apparent as
soon as he landed at Bristol, Tenn.
Absent was his previous assertion that Reagan's elec
tion could split the nation along racial, regional and
religious lines.
L.A. suffers 'worst smog of decade'
Los Angeles — Medical authorities reported an in
crease yesterday in the number ot people troubled by
respiratory ailments as smog and tog choked the Los
Angeles basin for the 11th consecutive day in the area's
worst siege of air pollution in 10 years.
But forecasters said there could be "significant im
provement" in the next tew days because of changing
weather patterns that are expected to blow the smog
away.
Forecasts tor today called for eight first-stage health
alerts in the four-countvarea, compared to 24 such alerts
yesterday, according to the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
The good news came as hospitals reported a sharp
influx ot respiratory complaints and the state Air Re
sources Board announced a new effort to impose
statewide smog inspections on automobiles.
The number of smog sufterers seeking medical help
the past 1 1 j weeks has been about triple the normal rate
at Hawthorne Community Hospital, according to
emergency room nurse Sharon Romero.
Dr. Kevin Lake, a lung specialist in Pasadena, said,
"For most people, the usual complaints during heavy
smog are more eye irritation. But the greatest effect
seems to be on people who already have respiratory
problems, such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
"We also see a lot of latent asthmatics, people who
develop shortness of breath when they exercise," Lake
said. "We've also noticed that the last few days a lot of
our patients with serious lung problems have canceled
theirafternoon appointments. They don't want togo out
of their homes or exert themselves in any way while the
air is this bad."
Berkeley prof, earns a Nobel prize
"I'm a very private person, and I don't want to be

famous, said C/eslaw Milosz yesterday morning,
blearv-eyed and dressed in bathrobe and slippers.
But it was already too late. The b9-year-old poet, critic
and novelist who teaches Slav ic languages and literature
at the Urnversitv ot California Berkeley, was awarded
the Nobel prize tor literature yesterday — the third
American to win the prize in the last live years.
Born in Lithuania, Milos/ writes in Polish and is rela
tively unknown in the West, where he has liv ed tor three
decades. In t astern I urope, w here he was once a hero of
the anti-Na/i resistance, he is now treated as a non
person because ot his opposition to communism.
He sought asylum in the West in 1951 while serving as
cultural affairs attache at the Polish embassy in Paris.
Milosz refused a recall to communist Poland, saying that
he was remaining in France "because I knew perfectly
well that my country was becoming the province of an
empire.
"I have rejected the Stalinists' new faith," he said,
"because the practice of lying is one of its principal
commandments. The Soviet religion is only another
name for lying."
His best-known work, The Captive Mind (1953) —
which analyzes the effects of communism on tour im
aginary writers — is now out of print in the United States.
His collected verse and prose is being published in
seven volumes by Nowa, an underground, dissident
publisher in Warsaw, where the underground published
his anthology of anti-Nazi poems, Invincible Song, dur
ing World War 11.
Reagan defends environmental stand
Birmingham, Ala. — Ronald Reagan contradicted him
self twice yesterday as he attempted to work free from a
potentially embarrassing claim that air pollution has
been "substantially controlled."
The Republican presidential candidate saw his Wed
nesday pronouncement on pollution control turn into a
political tar baby as reporters asked him repeatedly how
his statement squares with the 10-day-old smog crisis in
Los Angeles.
Reagan flies to Los Angeles today for what will be his
first encounter with the latest smog crisis in the state he
governed for eight years and is favored to carry on Nov.
4.
The air pollution controversy was, for Reagan, an un
pleasant sideshow to an otherwise successful campaign
day.
He picked up his second labor endorsement in two
days, winning a warm reception from the National

Maritime Union convention in St. loins. He was en
dorsed by the Teamsters on Wednesday.
Indictment returned in Ryan killing
San Francisco — A secret indictment was returned
yesterday by a tederal grand jury investigating the al
leged Peoples Temple assassination ot Rep. Leo Ryan
(D-Calit.) who died in a hail ot gunfire at a Guyana
airstrip in 197 H.

planned to charge tormer Temple cultist Larry Layton
with conspiring to kill Ryan. The U.S. attorney's office
declined all comment.
The grand |ury returned the indictment betore U.S.
District Judge Samuel Conti, whose courtroom windows
were covered with paper and doors locked.
Layton, Yi, was released from a Guyana prison and
flown today to New York, where he will be arraigned
tomorrow in Brooklyn tederal court. He will then be
flown to San Francisco, authorities said.
Layton, who was expelled from Guyana, was cleared
there of murder charges and attempted murder charges
in connection with the airstrip shootings.
Two FBI agents reportedly accompanied him on the
flight trom Guyana.
The San Francisco indictment was handed over to a
clerk of the court who then went through a process
which automatically assigns a judge to the case. Chiet
Judge Robert Peckham was selected, and it will be up to
him when the indictment is unsealed.
Ryan, three journalists and a woman seeking to leave
the troubled cult headed by Rev. Jim Jones, were killed
and two others wounded in the ambush.
Several hours later Jones and more than 900 followers

laden soft drinks and in some cases gunshots.

may be restraining trading, although the stock market

to 960.58. Losing issues outnumbered gainers by about
4-to-3 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Milosz refused a recall to communist Poland, saying that
he was remaining in France "because I knew perfectly

self twice yesterday as he attempted to work free from a
potentially embarrassing claim that air pollution has
been "substantially controlled."

nesday pronouncement on pollution control turn into a
political tar baby as reporters asked him repeatedly how
his statement squares with the 10-day-old smog crisis in
Los Angeles.
Reagan flies to Los Angeles today for what will be his
first encounter with the latest smog crisis in the state he
governed for eight years and is favored to carry on Nov.

Maritime Union convention in St. loins. He was en
dorsed by the Teamsters on Wednesday.

Begin decries Soviet-Syrian treaty
lerusalem — Israeli Prime Minister Meruchem Begin
said yesterday that the "friendship and cooperation tre
aty" signed this week between Syria and the Soviet
Union includes a secret military agreement.
The treaty, Begin said, "is a very dangerous develop
ment which is directed first against Israel — but also
concerns the whole tree world.
The prime minister did not c ite his source tor informa
tion about the military pact. Such reports, however,
have also been emanating from sources within the Sy
rian government in Damascus.
Israel radio, which is government-owned but inde
pendently operated, said that the reports of the new
treaty "will no doubt strengthen Begin s view that Israel
must retain security control of the occupied West Bank
and must not give up the Golan Heights.' The Golan
Heights, formerly owned by Syria, and the West Bank of
the Jordan River were occupied by Israel in 1%7.
Begin made his comments at an impromptu meeting
with newsmen outside his office and repeated them last
night at a dinner meeting of United Jewish Appeal (UJA)
fund-raisers visiting lerusalem.
He said he would consult with the United States about
the treaty next month.
"We can say with certainty that there is a secret pact,"
Begin told the UJA meeting.
Carter softens his attacks on Reagan
President )immy Carter went public with his softer,
toned-down attack on Ronald Reagan yesterday, but
independent John Anderson declared, "It's too late,"
and insisted the president's chances ot holding on to the
White House are fading.
Carter's rhetoric was milder as he began a two-day
Southern campaign swing in Tennessee, while Reagan,
in St. Louis, declared that, "I am an environmen
talist. ... I am for clean air." But the Republican candi
date renewed his attack on the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, which he said sometimes insists on "un
reasonable and many times untried standards' to clean
up the air.
Reagan also turned down an invitation by a Tampa,
Fla., television station tora "joint appearance" with Car
ter while both men are in Florida today. Carter accepted
the proposal, in which he and Reagan would answer
questions from different locations, but Reagan's
spokesman said there'd be no deal unless Anderson is
included.
The independent candidate campaigned in New York,

where he told a news conference that Carter apparently
had concluded that his "base and almost desperate at
tacks" on his rivals are not succeeding, so he is changing
his tune.
Anderson blasted Reagan tor making "an obvious and
calculated effort to move toward the center by aban
doning long-held, far-right positions.
Carter's new, gentler campaign style was apparent as
soon as he landed at Bristol, Tenn.
Absent was his previous assertion that Reagan's elec
tion could split the nation along racial, regional and
religious lines.
L.A. suffers 'worst smog of decade'
Los Angeles — Medical authorities reported an in
crease yesterday in the number ot people troubled by
respiratory ailments as smog and tog choked the Los
Angeles basin for the 11th consecutive day in the area's
worst siege of air pollution in 10 years.
But forecasters said there could be "significant im
provement" in the next tew days because of changing
weather patterns that are expected to blow the smog
away.
Forecasts tor today called for eight first-stage health
alerts in the four-countvarea, compared to 24 such alerts
yesterday, according to the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
The good news came as hospitals reported a sharp
influx ot respiratory complaints and the state Air Re
sources Board announced a new effort to impose
statewide smog inspections on automobiles.
The number of smog sufterers seeking medical help
the past 1 1 j weeks has been about triple the normal rate
at Hawthorne Community Hospital, according to
emergency room nurse Sharon Romero.
Dr. Kevin Lake, a lung specialist in Pasadena, said,
"For most people, the usual complaints during heavy
smog are more eye irritation. But the greatest effect
seems to be on people who already have respiratory
problems, such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
"We also see a lot of latent asthmatics, people who
develop shortness of breath when they exercise," Lake
said. "We've also noticed that the last few days a lot of
our patients with serious lung problems have canceled
theirafternoon appointments. They don't want togo out
of their homes or exert themselves in any way while the
air is this bad."

aty" signed this week between Syria and the Soviet
Union includes a secret military agreement.
The treaty, Begin said, "is a very dangerous develop
ment which is directed first against Israel — but also
concerns the whole tree world.
The prime minister did not c ite his source tor informa
tion about the military pact. Such reports, however,
have also been emanating from sources within the Sy
rian government in Damascus.
Israel radio, which is government-owned but inde
pendently operated, said that the reports of the new
treaty "will no doubt strengthen Begin s view that Israel
must retain security control of the occupied West Bank
and must not give up the Golan Heights.' The Golan
Heights, formerly owned by Syria, and the West Bank of
the Jordan River were occupied by Israel in 1%7.
Begin made his comments at an impromptu meeting
with newsmen outside his office and repeated them last
night at a dinner meeting of United Jewish Appeal (UJA)
fund-raisers visiting lerusalem.
He said he would consult with the United States about
the treaty next month.
"We can say with certainty that there is a secret pact,"
Begin told the UJA meeting.
Carter softens his attacks on Reagan
President )immy Carter went public with his softer,
toned-down attack on Ronald Reagan yesterday, but
independent John Anderson declared, "It's too late,"
and insisted the president's chances ot holding on to the
White House are fading.
Carter's rhetoric was milder as he began a two-day
Southern campaign swing in Tennessee, while Reagan,
in St. Louis, declared that, "I am an environmen
talist. ... I am for clean air." But the Republican candi
date renewed his attack on the Environmental Protec
tion Agency, which he said sometimes insists on "un
reasonable and many times untried standards' to clean
up the air.
Reagan also turned down an invitation by a Tampa,
Fla., television station tora "joint appearance" with Car
ter while both men are in Florida today. Carter accepted
the proposal, in which he and Reagan would answer
questions from different locations, but Reagan's
spokesman said there'd be no deal unless Anderson is
included.
The independent candidate campaigned in New York,

where he told a news conference that Carter apparently
had concluded that his "base and almost desperate at
tacks" on his rivals are not succeeding, so he is changing
his tune.
Anderson blasted Reagan tor making "an obvious and
calculated effort to move toward the center by aban
doning long-held, far-right positions.
Carter's new, gentler campaign style was apparent as
soon as he landed at Bristol, Tenn.
Absent was his previous assertion that Reagan's elec
tion could split the nation along racial, regional and
religious lines.
L.A. suffers 'worst smog of decade'
Los Angeles — Medical authorities reported an in
crease yesterday in the number ot people troubled by
respiratory ailments as smog and tog choked the Los
Angeles basin for the 11th consecutive day in the area's
worst siege of air pollution in 10 years.
But forecasters said there could be "significant im
provement" in the next tew days because of changing
weather patterns that are expected to blow the smog
away.
Forecasts tor today called for eight first-stage health
alerts in the four-countvarea, compared to 24 such alerts
yesterday, according to the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
The good news came as hospitals reported a sharp
influx ot respiratory complaints and the state Air Re
sources Board announced a new effort to impose
statewide smog inspections on automobiles.
The number of smog sufterers seeking medical help
the past 1 1 j weeks has been about triple the normal rate
at Hawthorne Community Hospital, according to
emergency room nurse Sharon Romero.
Dr. Kevin Lake, a lung specialist in Pasadena, said,
"For most people, the usual complaints during heavy
smog are more eye irritation. But the greatest effect
seems to be on people who already have respiratory
problems, such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
"We also see a lot of latent asthmatics, people who
develop shortness of breath when they exercise," Lake
said. "We've also noticed that the last few days a lot of
our patients with serious lung problems have canceled
theirafternoon appointments. They don't want togo out
of their homes or exert themselves in any way while the
air is this bad."
Berkeley prof, earns a Nobel prize
"I'm a very private person, and I don't want to be

famous, said C/eslaw Milosz yesterday morning,
blearv-eyed and dressed in bathrobe and slippers.
But it was already too late. The b9-year-old poet, critic
and novelist who teaches Slav ic languages and literature
at the Urnversitv ot California Berkeley, was awarded
the Nobel prize tor literature yesterday — the third
American to win the prize in the last live years.
Born in Lithuania, Milos/ writes in Polish and is rela
tively unknown in the West, where he has liv ed tor three
decades. In t astern I urope, w here he was once a hero of
the anti-Na/i resistance, he is now treated as a non
person because ot his opposition to communism.
He sought asylum in the West in 1951 while serving as
cultural affairs attache at the Polish embassy in Paris.
Milosz refused a recall to communist Poland, saying that
he was remaining in France "because I knew perfectly
well that my country was becoming the province of an
empire.
"I have rejected the Stalinists' new faith," he said,
"because the practice of lying is one of its principal
commandments. The Soviet religion is only another
name for lying."
His best-known work, The Captive Mind (1953) —
which analyzes the effects of communism on tour im
aginary writers — is now out of print in the United States.
His collected verse and prose is being published in
seven volumes by Nowa, an underground, dissident
publisher in Warsaw, where the underground published
his anthology of anti-Nazi poems, Invincible Song, dur
ing World War 11.
Reagan defends environmental stand
Birmingham, Ala. — Ronald Reagan contradicted him
self twice yesterday as he attempted to work free from a
potentially embarrassing claim that air pollution has
been "substantially controlled."
The Republican presidential candidate saw his Wed
nesday pronouncement on pollution control turn into a
political tar baby as reporters asked him repeatedly how
his statement squares with the 10-day-old smog crisis in
Los Angeles.
Reagan flies to Los Angeles today for what will be his
first encounter with the latest smog crisis in the state he
governed for eight years and is favored to carry on Nov.
4.
The air pollution controversy was, for Reagan, an un
pleasant sideshow to an otherwise successful campaign
day.
He picked up his second labor endorsement in two
days, winning a warm reception from the National

Maritime Union convention in St. loins. He was en
dorsed by the Teamsters on Wednesday.

in connection with the airstrip shootings.
Two FBI agents reportedly accompanied him on the
flight trom Guyana.

clerk of the court who then went through a process
which automatically assigns a judge to the case. Chiet
