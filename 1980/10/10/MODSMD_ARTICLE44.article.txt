# Marguerite acquires new buses
## 
### Doug Jehl 
Stanford's Marguerite bus shuttle system is now
using two new buses equipped with wheelchair lifts
to assist the physically limited.
The buses were remodeled last July in order to
comply with federal regulations requiring public
facilities be made accessible to the physically limited.
In addition, a sub-committee ot the Committee on
Parking and Transportation is currently evaluating the
entire Marguerite system.
According to John Pipkin, University traffic manager
and the head ot Marguerite operation, when the Uni
versity recognized the need to provide wheelchair
access, it ascertained it could either purchase new
buses itself, or it could instruct its vendor, the Penin
sula Charter Company, to buy the buses.
Safety, needs, economy
The latter option was chosen. Pipkin said, "In
selecting the buses and lifts, we were concerned with

three important things: safety, the needs of the phys
ically limited, and economy."
With these factors in mind, the charter company
purchased the two buses for $55,000 each and instal
led wheelchair lifts designed by Transportation De
sign and Technology, a San Diego based company.
Duringthe process, Pipkin and thecommitteecon
sulted Nick Zirpolo, chairman of the Stanford Advis
ory Croup on Transportation for the Physically Li
mited. Zirpolo and other members of the group
tested and approved the lifts and assisted in planning
the deployment of the special buses.
Schedules
Between 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. weekdays, two buses
run every ten minutes on the Tresidder route and two
on the Serra route. (System maps were distributed in
registration packets). It was agreed that one lift
equipped bus should be on each route at all times;
thus, the special buses run every 20 minutes.
