# University to examine faculty housing
## 
### Phil Fernandez 
The Board of Trustees will decide at its October 14
meeting whether to continue funding an innova
tive University program that provides low-cost
second mortgage loans to new faculty and senior
staff members.
Still in its pilot stage, Stanford's COIN (for
"coinvestment") program allows eligible particip
ants to obtain a second mortgage covering up to
two-thirds of a home's purchase price at effective
interest rates as low as 5 percent .Funds for the
loans are provided directly by the University,
which later getsa shareof any gain in the value of
the house.
All faculty and senior staff members who have
been with the University for less than three years
are eligible to participate.
According to Robert Summers, manager of
faculty/staff housing, interest payments are cur
rently computed at a 16 percent rate, but the home
buyer under the loan program pays only a portion
of the amount. The difference is added to the
balance due on the house.
A fair return
When the house is sold, the University takes
two-thirds of the increase in value of the house, up
to a computed maximum, and the remainder goes
to the homeowner. When the house gains in

value, the University is able to gain a fair return on
its money.
With COIN financing, a professor's house pay
ments can be as little as half of what they would be
with a conventional mortgage. Summers said a
buyer able to afford only a $50,000 house with
conventional financing would be able to purch
ase a $150,000 house with COIN financing.
Because single family homes in the Palo Alto
area sell in the $150,000 range, and homes on cam
pus start at over $200,000, COIN is the only way
many staff members can afford to own a home.
Under the program, monthly payments gradually
increase as the buyer's earnings power goes up,
until they are equivalent to payments undera con
ventional loan.
Launched in February
COIN was launched by a Feb. 12 vote of the
Board of Trustees which provided an initial $2 mill
ion for the program, and last lune, another $1
million. On October 14, the Trustees will be asked
to continue the program with an additional $4 mill
ion.
To date, 43 homeowners have obtained financ
ing through COIN, and an additional 20 faculty
and staff members are on a waiting list for the
program.
Housing is often described as the greatest obs

tacle to recruitment of new (acuity and staff. Al
though there are sufficient homes currently for
sale, mostareoutof theprice range of new faculty.
Acting University Provost Al Hastort has called
COIN "absolutely crucial" in new faculty recruit
ment.
Recruitment Helped
According to Summers, the COIN program has
"definitely" aided in recruiting. Several new pro
fessors agree.
"There is no way I could have afforded a house
in the area (without COIN)," said Dave Larue, as
sistant professor of geology. And while Asst.
History Prof. lake Rakove has not yet par
ticipated in COIN, he said, "COIN will be instru
mental in my being able to stay."
Summers said he is hopeful that the successful
pilot program will be continued and made perma
nent, perhaps in conjunction with other Univer
sity programs to ease the housing situation.
Construction will begin early next year on the
Peter Coutts Hill faculty housing project. When
completed, the project will provide 140 new two,
three and four bedroom homes in the $150,000
price range. Summers said he is hopeful that a
similar program which he dubs "son of COIN" will
provide financing for Peter Coutts buyers.

History Prof. lake Rakove has not yet par
ticipated in COIN, he said, "COIN will be instru
mental in my being able to stay."
Summers said he is hopeful that the successful
pilot program will be continued and made perma
nent, perhaps in conjunction with other Univer
sity programs to ease the housing situation.
Construction will begin early next year on the
Peter Coutts Hill faculty housing project. When
completed, the project will provide 140 new two,
three and four bedroom homes in the $150,000
price range. Summers said he is hopeful that a
similar program which he dubs "son of COIN" will
provide financing for Peter Coutts buyers.
The Board of Trustees will decide at its October 14
meeting whether to continue funding an innova
tive University program that provides low-cost
second mortgage loans to new faculty and senior
staff members.
Still in its pilot stage, Stanford's COIN (for
"coinvestment") program allows eligible particip
ants to obtain a second mortgage covering up to
two-thirds of a home's purchase price at effective
interest rates as low as 5 percent .Funds for the
loans are provided directly by the University,
which later getsa shareof any gain in the value of
the house.
All faculty and senior staff members who have
been with the University for less than three years
are eligible to participate.
According to Robert Summers, manager of
faculty/staff housing, interest payments are cur
rently computed at a 16 percent rate, but the home
buyer under the loan program pays only a portion
of the amount. The difference is added to the
balance due on the house.
A fair return
When the house is sold, the University takes
two-thirds of the increase in value of the house, up
to a computed maximum, and the remainder goes
to the homeowner. When the house gains in

value, the University is able to gain a fair return on
its money.
With COIN financing, a professor's house pay
ments can be as little as half of what they would be
with a conventional mortgage. Summers said a
buyer able to afford only a $50,000 house with
conventional financing would be able to purch
ase a $150,000 house with COIN financing.
Because single family homes in the Palo Alto
area sell in the $150,000 range, and homes on cam
pus start at over $200,000, COIN is the only way
many staff members can afford to own a home.
Under the program, monthly payments gradually
increase as the buyer's earnings power goes up,
until they are equivalent to payments undera con
ventional loan.
Launched in February
COIN was launched by a Feb. 12 vote of the
Board of Trustees which provided an initial $2 mill
ion for the program, and last lune, another $1
million. On October 14, the Trustees will be asked
to continue the program with an additional $4 mill
ion.
To date, 43 homeowners have obtained financ
ing through COIN, and an additional 20 faculty
and staff members are on a waiting list for the
program.
Housing is often described as the greatest obs

tacle to recruitment of new (acuity and staff. Al
though there are sufficient homes currently for
sale, mostareoutof theprice range of new faculty.
Acting University Provost Al Hastort has called
COIN "absolutely crucial" in new faculty recruit
ment.
Recruitment Helped
According to Summers, the COIN program has
"definitely" aided in recruiting. Several new pro
fessors agree.
"There is no way I could have afforded a house
in the area (without COIN)," said Dave Larue, as
sistant professor of geology. And while Asst.
History Prof. lake Rakove has not yet par
ticipated in COIN, he said, "COIN will be instru
mental in my being able to stay."
Summers said he is hopeful that the successful
pilot program will be continued and made perma
