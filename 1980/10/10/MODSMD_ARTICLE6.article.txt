# Number of bike thefts increase on campus

Bicycles are the favorite target for thieves on
Stanford's campus,, according to Police Detec
tive Carl Gielitz. And he said the problem is
getting worse.
He estimates that almost 500 bikes will be
stolen in 1%0, costing students up to $75,000.
"I've talked to the officers on the street,"
Gielitz said, "and they say the word is out that
Stanford is easy pickin's."
In 1979 fewer bikes were stolen than in previ
ous years but Gielitz said he expects the theft
rate to go up in 1980. Students reported 10 bikes
missing the last week of September, he said.
"Right at the beginning we get hit awful
hard," Cielitz said. "People have a tendency to
be thinking about other things."
Two early victums
Freshmen Richard Kylberg and Paul Gutjahr
are two such early victums. Kylberg's $300 and
Gutjahr's $500 Peugeot were stolen 24 hours
after the two friends arrived at the Farm.
"I've had to go around on roller skates," Kyl
berg said, "it's ridiculous."
He called their story "a real tear-jerker."
After driving from Denver, Colorado, they ar
rived one day before Freshman Orientation.
Kylberg said he wanted to get a headstart, so he
registered his bike at 2 p. m. at Tresidder Union.
Kylberg locked his bike with Gutjahr's at a
bike rack in front of Zapata House.
The next day at 2 p.m. they found the cable
cut and the bikes gone.
"My bike probably wouldn't have been sto
len if it hadn't have been chained to his 12-
speed race," Kylberg said.
They reported the theft to the Stanford
Police. "But the police lady we talked to said
there's no way we'll ever get them back," Kyl

berg said.
Nevertheless, Detective Gielitz urged that
once a student discovers his bike is missing, he
should report it to the police.
To curb Stanford's high rate of bike theft,
Gielitz called for a "cooperative effort among
students, not only in bikes, but in all phases of
security." He cited three specific ways students
can discourage bike theft:
— Register bikes with the police.
— Lock bikes securely in well trafficked
areas.
— Report any suspicious activities to the
police.
The California Vehicle Code requires that all
bikes be registered. Students can register bikes
at the Tresidder Recreation Center on Tuesdays
4:00 - 6:00 p.m.
Registering a bike improves the chances that
a stolen bike will be returned to its owner,
Gielitz said. "We recover more registered bikes
than we recover unregistered bikes."
Furthermore, Gielitz blames the low recov
ery rate on the low registration rate.
'Prove it's yours'
"I've got 179 bikes that have been abandoned
on campus last year...about 30 of them are re
gistered and the rest of them are going to be
dumped because we don't know who they be
long to," Gielitz said. "I can't give a frame back
to a guy just because he says it's his. This is the
law. If you lose something or it's stolen, you've
got to prove that it's yours.
Secure locking helps prevent bike thefts,
Gielitz said. "There's an awful lot of cheap
cable locks on the market," he said. The Police
Departments "Bicycle Security Information"

sheet offers the following advice:
— The best locks are made of hardened alloy
steel. Combination locks are vulnerable to
hammer blows.
— Chains should be at least '/« inches thick
and six feet long.
— Cables should be '/2-inch thick and six feet
long.
— Both the lock and the bike should be in
sured.
—Position lock high off the ground.
— Anchor both wheels and frame to a bike
rack in a weel-trafficked area.
Suspicious visitors
"The first line of defense should be the stu
dents themselves," said Gielitz. "When you see
that person walking down the hall, you should
check and find out who he is, what he wants,
and where he's going."
It anyone looks out of context with his sur
rounding because of his age or dress, Gielitz
said students should call the police. "We'd
rather check out a hundred guys who have
legitimate business there, than to let one guy in
there who'll rip you off," fie said.
No one , however, called the police about
suspicious activity around Stern Hall on Sept.
24 when Kylberg's and Gutjahr's bikes were
stolen.
They say this is going to be tho funnest four
years of your life," Kylberg said, "and here it
was the first day and someone steals my bike."
Insurance will cover Kylberg's loss, hut Cut
jahr, like many other students here, has no
insurance on his hike. "Thats the way it goes,"
Kylberg said.
