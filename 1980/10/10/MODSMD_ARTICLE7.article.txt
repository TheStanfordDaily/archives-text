## Every citizen a soldier for life Swiss policy; 'forward defense' 
### Los Angeles Times 
Berne — "The Swiss do not
have an army, they are the
army."
Tins comment in a govern
ment publication sums up
Switzerland's novel national
detense program that makes
virtually every male citizen a
soldier as well as a civilian tor
much ot his life.
The army is not really an
army. It is a national militia in
which civilian pursuits are in
extricably intermingled with
the military duties that the
Swiss, virtually without excep
tion, insist are vital to preserve
the nation's independence and
neutrality.
The aim is to mobilize as
large an army as possible as
quickly as possible. Strategy is
based on dissuasion — an et
tort to convince any potential
enemy that it would be too
costly to invade the country.
Switzerland has abandoned
the redoubt theory ot World
War II, when it tound itself sur
rounded by the fascist
controlled countries. That
theory called for a military
pullback in the event of an in
vasion, abandoning the low ly
ing, most populous areas to
the enemy, and makinga stand

in the rugged interior regions.
Now, the Swiss are deter
mined to tight tor every inch ot
their country from the moment
an enemy sets toot on it.
The Swiss torces would be
used tor small-scale lighting at
close range and tor hit-and-run
attacks designed to ottset the
expected superiority in men
and weapons ot any aggressor.
"Whenever possible," a
government study says, "close
contact with the aggressor will
be sought so that he will not be
able to use his weapons with
out endangering his own
force."
The strategy ot dissuasion
and the concept of a "forward
defense" are seen as Switzer
land's best insurance against
attack by conventional torces.
Such an attack, the Swiss be
lieve, despite their tradition ot
strict neutrality, would come
only from the Soviet Bloc, and
that would lead to general war
with the Western nuclear pow
ers on Switzerland's side.
Citizen's army
Yet its determination to de
tend itself has hardly turned
Switzerland into a nation ot
militarists.
The armed forces have no

commander-in-chiet. They are
ruled by civilians — in most
cases they are also militia otlic
ers — under Switzerland's
committee form of govern
ment.
The military establishment is
part of the civil service, and
consists of about 800 otticers
and an equal number of non
commissioned officers v\hose
primary tunction is to teach
military skills. The standing
forces, excluding those in re
cruit training, number' about
3000 at any time.
Vet the militia is capable ot
lielding an army ot roughly
640,000 men — about 10 per
cent ot the population — in lit
tle more than 48 hours.
Speed is key
Fully mobilized, Switzerland
would have the equivalent of
15 servicemen tor every square
kilometer ot national territory,
the highest concentration ot
military manpower in Europe.
Speed in mobilization is due
in part to the practice of having
every soldier keep his personal
military gear close at hand. His
swiss-made automatic rifle, 50
rounds of ammunition, un
iform and knapsack are kept at
home, ready for instant use.
The equipment is his to keep.

and many households have
become tiny arsenals ot
weapons lett by generations ot
men.
Men are eligible lor military
service lor 30 to 35 years, then
join civilian defense agencies
lor as long as they are able to
serve. They are on active dutv
lor relatively short periods dur
ing that time, ranging from a
total of 329 days tor privates to
up to 5 1 i years tor colonels on
the general stall.
The tigures can be mislead
ing, however, for military
duties are often linked to a
militiaman's civilian occupa
tion and are sharpened in a var
iety ot ways, often on the man's
own time and at his own ex
pense.
Such oft-duty work saves the
country about $500,000 a year
in military expenditures, which
total about $2 billion a year.
Military spending accounts for
only 1.9 percent of the gross
national product, about halt of
the figure in neighboring Fr
ance.

Switzerland into a nation ot

Fully mobilized, Switzerland
would have the equivalent of

kilometer ot national territory,
the highest concentration ot
military manpower in Europe.
Speed in mobilization is due
in part to the practice of having
every soldier keep his personal
military gear close at hand. His
swiss-made automatic rifle, 50
rounds of ammunition, un
iform and knapsack are kept at
home, ready for instant use.
