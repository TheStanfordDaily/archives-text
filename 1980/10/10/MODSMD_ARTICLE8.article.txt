## Soviets dying in Afghanistan 
### Los Angeles Times 
New Delhi — At least 20 to 25 Soviet war dead
are shipped home for burial each week from a
major hospital in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan,
an Afghan nurse who worked there said Wed
nesday.
Nili Panjshiri, 26, a student nurse for three
years and tor the past year a staff nurse at the
Armed Forces Medical Sciences Academy Hos
pital in Kabul, said she saw the bodies of Soviet
soldiers during the course of her duties there.
"There may have been more, those are what I
saw myself," she said through an interpreter
during an interview here Wednesday. She,
along with 13 other relatives, left Afghanistan
last month.
Overcrowding
According to Panjshiri, the military hospital
which had a rated capacity of 400 beds, was
severely overcrowded at the time of her depar
ture on Sept. 24. "My service was meant for 25
patients, but there were never less than 100 to
150 there," she said.

While the hospital handled mainly Afghan
army casualties, a 100 to 150-bed so-called lux
ury wing was reserved tor Soviet soldiers when a
larger general garrison military hospital for Rus
sian casualties in the city was full.
However, because the academy hosptial had
the city's largest morgue, all coffins containing
Soviet dead were staged there prior to being
shipped home, she explained.
Fighting avoided
She said the number of Afghan dead far ex
ceed those of the Soviets. She said the nature of
the wounds varied, but that many of those com
ing in from the Panjshir valley had suffered muti
lation. A majorbattlewas fought between Soviet
forces and local tribesmen for control of the
strategically important valley late this summer.
By most accounts it ended inconclusively with
heavy casualties on both sides.
While many of the Soviet soldiers brought to
the hospital were seriously wounded, a number
complained of minor ailments apparently to
avoid fighting, Panjshiri claimed.
