"I APPLIED MYSELF AND GOT
FEDERAL STUDY MONEY."
â€” Robin Clark
"My parents help pay my college tuition, and I also work part-time. But
last year I realized I might not have enough money to continue my education.
"Then I found out about the Middle Income Student Assistance Act.
It provides more aid than ever before for education after high school.
"I applied and found out that I was eligible for a Basic Educational Oppor
tunity Grant (BEOG). You should also apply to see if you qualify for BEOG
or one of the other programs available to almost all
students enrolled in colleges or technical schools.
"If you'd like to get more education and
need study money, do what I did. Write to
Box 84, Washington, D.C. 20044 and ask
for a free booklet. It's called "A Student
Consumer's Guide to Six Federal Finan
cial Aid Programs!' Then get in touch
with the counselor or financial aid admin
istrator in the school of your choice for
help in applying. (And be sure to com
plete the forms carefully so you will be
eligible for the help you need!)
"Remember: If you want education
after high school and need financial
assistance to get it,"IT'S TIME TO
V APPLY YOURSELF."
