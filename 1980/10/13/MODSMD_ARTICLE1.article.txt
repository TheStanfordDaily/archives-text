# Kennedy urges faculty to be more involved with students

In an elaborate and colorful cere
mony held yesterday, Donald Ken
nedy was inaugurated as Stanford's
eighth president.
In his inaugural address before a
gathering of 6000 in Frost Am
phitheatre, Kennedy traced the tradi
tions of the University, highlighted
the challenges Stanford would face
in the coming years, and offered
proposals for meeting these chal
lenges.
Kennedy called for the rejuvena
tion of the study of humanities, avast
improvement in undergraduate edu
cation and a renewed emphasis on
residential education and the advis
ing program.
He announced a new Stanford
Humanities Center will be created this
year and that a $1.25 million grant
from the Andrew W. Mellon Founda
tion will provide for junior faculty
appointments in the humanities.
Stanford's eighth president urged
faculty to become more involved in
student life outside the classroom.
Improving undergraduate education
will be difficult until the University
"can evaporate the aftermath of mis
trust that has hung over us for so
long" as a result of the anti-war pro
tests and violence of the late 60s and
early 70s, Kennedy said.
He also pledged to be a strong
leader in the tradition of past presi
dents such as Richard Lyman and ).E.

Wallace Sterling.
The event was billed as an oppor
tunity to renew and rededicate Stan
ford's purpose, and much of Ken
nedy's speech and the events sur
rounding the inauguration echoed
this theme.
Over 500 faculty members, dres
sed in robes of black, cardinal red,
silver and gold, marched in a proces
sional to their seats on and in front of
the stage. They were preceded by the
heraldic banners for the schools of
the University.
In attendence were former presi
dents Richard Lyman and Wallace
Sterling, and thecurrent president of
Harvard University, Derek Bok, a
Stanford alumnus.
Kennedy stressed Stantord's his
torical roots anci the "transcendent"
characteristics that have survived
throughout the years.
Stanford has a "distinctively West
ern and distinctively self
sufficient"characteristic that de
veloped because of its location far
from the learning centers of the East
Coast, Kennedy said.
Sciences vs. Humanities
There has always been a strong at
tachment to the natural and practical
sciences here, Kennedy said. Recent
growth in the physical sciences, the
biomedical sciences and the infor
mation sciences, requiring massive
expenditures forpure research, have
diverted the energy of the faculty

away from students, Kennedy said.
In addition, "there is a disparity of
emphasis — not overwhelming to be
sure, but still there — between the
sciences and the humanities," Ken
nedy asserted.
Stanford "must add to the faculty
strength...and create new institu
tional opportunities for...scholars in
humanistic studies," he said.
The University has committed re
sources necessary for the tirst phase
of developing the Stanford
Humanities Center, Kennedy said.
Prof. Ian Watt, former chairman of
the English Dept., will be the first
director of the program.
Stanford will also attempt the "re
formation of undergraduate educa
tion," Kennedy asserted.
Lingering problems
Two tactors have helped to erode
the quality of undergraduate educa
tion here, he said.
The student unrest of the late 60s
and early 70s produced "profoundly
alienating differences" between pro
fessors and students, Kennedy said.
It became very difficult for a "40-
year-old professor to sit down com
fortably with a group of 20-vear olds
at a luncheon table," he said.
Secondly, an increase in spon
sored projects and post-doctoral
work became an "attractive avenue
of faculty withdrawal," Kennedy as
serted. These helped to siphon fa-

culty energies away trom teaching,
he said.
The administration has been told
by students, faculty and other critics
that it is failing to meet the individual
needs of students in areas such as
academic advising, thoughtful criti
cism of ideas, counseling and the
rendering of editorial judgment,
Kennedy said.
Call for new interaction
Kennedy asserted faculty must get
involved with student lite "outside
the Quad." Stanford is a residential
institution and there is a "close lin
kage between what goes on in the
classroom and what goes on in the
lives students lead outside the clas
sroom," Kennedy said.
Faculty must not refuse to get in
volved with students "merely be
cause once, a long time ago, stu
dents may have told us that they
didn't expect us to be their parents."
Faculty members should act as
"mentors" to students, but not pa
rents in absence, Kennedy said.
He asserted there is a "disparity
between the readiness ot students
and of faculty to deal with the prob
lem, because the students who took
part in the anti-war movement have
graduated, but the memory remains
with the professors who have
stayed."
'The way is open'
Kennedy challenged faculty to
work to overcome their attitudes of
the past. "The way is open; the walls
that were put up a decade ago have
crumbled around us. All we need to
do is take a few bold steps away from
the wreckage,"he said.
The continual use of a cabinet on
undergraduate education consisting
of deans, administrators, chairs of
faculty committees and student rep
resentatives will be an integral part of
the plan to improve undergraduate
education, Kennedy said.
Kennedy concluded his speech
with a promise fora "period in which
we (the University) will be aggre
sively ambitious."
