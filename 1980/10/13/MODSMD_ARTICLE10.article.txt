# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Tyler Bridges Sher presents voters with choice 
### 
Rarely do we vote for a political candidate today because we
really want to; too often, we are left with little or no choice. This
year, however, an outstanding Stanford faculty member is run
ning for public office, and offers us a choice. On Nov. 4,
thousands of people will vote for Stanford law professor Byron
Sher, 21st District Assembly nominee, not because he's the lesser
of two evils, but because they want to elect him.
For those who have grown disillusioned with political candi
dates, Sher comes across as a breath of tresh air. An honorable,
intelligent, humane man, Byron Sher is simply California's best
qualified assembly candidate. No one can match his record.
How many candidates for political office today speak out un
equivocally on the important issues? How many candidates tor
political office today are deeply concerned with helping consum
ers, not special interests ? (And how many candidates for political
office today have a beard?) Each example describes Sher.
Sher has accumulated a distinguished record of achievement
and service in public affairs and at Stanford. Sher has served the
community as a member of Palo Alto's City Council for over nine
years, including two terms as mayor. He is presently Palo Alto's
vice mayor having been overwhelmingly re-elected to the council
in 1977.
Having taught Consumer Protection Law in the Law School for
23 years, Sher has been an integral part of the Stanford commun
ity. He understands extremely well the campus' needs and con
cerns. Ten years ago Sherchaired theHuman Relations Commis
sion, earning tremendous respect from his colleagues who
elected him as chairman of the Faculty Senate four years ago. His
colleagues are now strongly supporting his candidacy. Re
peatedly, Sher has been voted by his students as one of the most
popular and effective professors in the Law School.

Sher is chairman of the Santa Clara County petition drive to
repeal the Peripheral Canal legislation. A $5 billion taxpayer rip
off, the Peripheral Canal entails the construction of a 4 i-mile long
canal that would divert Northern California rivers south to the
vast corporate farms in Kern County.
While Shell Oil, Union Oil, Southern Pacific RR and other
special interests will profit enormously, receiving the subsidized
water virtually tree, consumers statewide will pay heavily, both in
the north and in the south. Worse is the potential environmental
damage from the exportation of the fresh water which helps
maintain the health of the Delta and the San Francisco Bay.
In addition to his opposition to the Peripheral Canal, Sher is
concentrating his campaign on three issues: the environment,
energy and housing. As a Palo Alto city councilman, Sher has
continually fought to protect the quality of life on the mid-
Peninsula. He has worked to protect the baylands as a commis
sioner ot the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development
Commission, and has helped ensure that the foothills remain
open.
Energy is an important issue in Sher's campaign. Sher opposes
the continued licensing of nuclear power plants until safe dis
posal methods can be guaranteed. In the meantime he is working
to provide viable alternatives — conservation and other energy
forms — that will eliminate the need for nuclear power.
Sher is a board member of the California Solar Utility De
velopment Authority where he has helped encourage the de
velopment of solar and other alternative forms of energy. As a
Palo Alto city councilman, he has strongly pushed the city munic
ipal utility to help finance solar conversion and energy conserva
tion. As a member of the Santa Clara County Transportation
Commission, he has worked to expand bus service and to en
courage car pooling.
Had trouble finding a place to live off-campus? Sher has
worked actively to secure additional as well as affordable housing
in Palo Alto. He helped draft a city ordinance that established
renters' rights. Favoring more rental units, Sher is working to
prevent apartments from being converted into condominiums.
He is a strong advocate of below-market value housing and has
worked for a "no eviction without just cause" ordinance in Palo
Alto.
Sher has received donations from hundreds of individuals. He
has spent the campaign walking precincts and speaking before
any group interested to hear the issues. He has spoken on cam
pus at Florence Moore and Lagunita dorms, and at Synergy House
and will be speaking elsewhere in the immediate future. He is
seeking the support of Stanford students to work on his cam
paign.
The Stanford community has the opportunity to elect one of its
own — Byron Sher — to the State Assembly. This opportunity is as
rare as is the opportunity to vote for someone you really want to.
Byron Sher presents the opportunity to fulfill both goals.

of Stanford Students for Byron Sher.)
