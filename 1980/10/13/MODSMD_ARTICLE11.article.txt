## Join the search 
### 
This year, we the students of
Stanford University have a un
ique opportunity to both solve
a lingering problem and move
forward with the selection of
a new mascot/symbol. The year
is unique, and the time is ripe.
In President Donald Ken
nedy's first reference to the
mascot issue, he made it per
fectly clear that the Indian will
never return. Bring back the
Indian is no longer an issue,
and we appreciate Kennedy's
strong statement. He, too,
realizes that it is time to take a
positive step in finding a new
mascot, and he has proposed
the formation of a mascot
committee, made up of rep
resentatives throughout the
University, which will facilitate
the search.
The culmination of the
search will be a referendum in
the spring, at which time the
student body will choose our
new mascot.
We need to takethe initiative
to 1) Identify new options - pol
ling the dorms, polling the
Stanford athletes, hitting the
history books, talking to
alumni, faculty and staff,
checking out mascots from
other schools.
2) Give the options character —
research their history, solicit
sketches from graphic artists
which make the mascot look
fierce, proud, cuddly, cute,
mug-size, T-shirt size, helmet
size.
3) Narrow the field — do polls
of mascot options at sporting
events, special events, dorm
meetings and more.
The search will be led by the
ASSU, its senators and the
Council of Presidents, with the
support of concerned campus
groups. And as a preview of
this year's activities, here are a
few of the past and future favo
rites:
The griffin - a majestic,
winged lion of legendary

times. The Griffin has enjoyed
support from many student
athletes and others, but it will
have to be made more cuddly it
it is to gain support.
The tree - A great favorite of
the Incomparable Leland Stan
ford Junior University March
ing Band. Some people would
be more receptivetotheTreeif
it had a name — Sequoia,
maybe. One major draw
back. . .we all know what Hus
kies do to Trees.
The robber baron - In honor
of our founding father, that
king of the railroads. . .but it
may be a little representative of
the guilt we all feel . . .or
should.
Cardinal — Our present
symbol is Cardinal Red — not
the bird. Alabama's Crimson
Tide does just fine with a color.
The pacers — Leland Sr. built
a stock farm on the campus for
the sole purpose of raising race
horses, namely Pacers. But
some folks feel this alternative
would be too closely related to
the failing American auto in
dustry.
These are just a few of the
options. But there are many
more to be unearthed during
the search. We need everyone
in the community to contribute
ideas and get involved in the
resolution of the mascot di
lemma. Already, one student
has come by the ASSU office
with the idea of using the
Bucks. . .Stanford Bucks. We
asked her how she felt about
antlers on football helmets.
"Not antlers, the bucks I am
talking about are the bucks

Stanford University have a un
ique opportunity to both solve
a lingering problem and move
forward with the selection of
a new mascot/symbol. The year
is unique, and the time is ripe.
In President Donald Ken
nedy's first reference to the
mascot issue, he made it per
fectly clear that the Indian will
never return. Bring back the
Indian is no longer an issue,
and we appreciate Kennedy's
strong statement. He, too,
realizes that it is time to take a
positive step in finding a new
mascot, and he has proposed
the formation of a mascot
committee, made up of rep
resentatives throughout the
University, which will facilitate
the search.
The culmination of the
search will be a referendum in
the spring, at which time the
student body will choose our
new mascot.
We need to takethe initiative
to 1) Identify new options - pol
ling the dorms, polling the
Stanford athletes, hitting the
history books, talking to
alumni, faculty and staff,
checking out mascots from
other schools.
2) Give the options character —
research their history, solicit
sketches from graphic artists
which make the mascot look
fierce, proud, cuddly, cute,
mug-size, T-shirt size, helmet
size.
3) Narrow the field — do polls
of mascot options at sporting
events, special events, dorm
meetings and more.
The search will be led by the
ASSU, its senators and the
Council of Presidents, with the
support of concerned campus
groups. And as a preview of
this year's activities, here are a
few of the past and future favo
rites:
The griffin - a majestic,
winged lion of legendary

times. The Griffin has enjoyed
support from many student
athletes and others, but it will
have to be made more cuddly it
it is to gain support.
The tree - A great favorite of
the Incomparable Leland Stan
ford Junior University March
ing Band. Some people would
be more receptivetotheTreeif
it had a name — Sequoia,
maybe. One major draw
back. . .we all know what Hus
kies do to Trees.
The robber baron - In honor
of our founding father, that
king of the railroads. . .but it
may be a little representative of
the guilt we all feel . . .or
should.
Cardinal — Our present
symbol is Cardinal Red — not
the bird. Alabama's Crimson
Tide does just fine with a color.
The pacers — Leland Sr. built
a stock farm on the campus for
the sole purpose of raising race
horses, namely Pacers. But
some folks feel this alternative
would be too closely related to
the failing American auto in
dustry.
These are just a few of the
options. But there are many
more to be unearthed during
the search. We need everyone
in the community to contribute
ideas and get involved in the
resolution of the mascot di
lemma. Already, one student
has come by the ASSU office
with the idea of using the
Bucks. . .Stanford Bucks. We
asked her how she felt about
antlers on football helmets.
"Not antlers, the bucks I am
talking about are the bucks
everyone else around here
thinks of — THE BIG BUCKSS
JOIN US IN the search!
