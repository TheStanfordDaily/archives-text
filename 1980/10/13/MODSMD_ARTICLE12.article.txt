## Beware the election of fear 
### 
— John Anderson
— Ronald Reagan
— Jimmy Carter 29
Those figures represent the most recent per
centages trom Mervin Field's California poll,
112 ield asked Calitornians who they wanted in the
White House, and a strong plurality said, "John
Anderson Still many voters insist that John
Anderson is not a \ lable presidential (andidate.
So some ot them will cast their votes lor Car
ter, hoping that Reagan won't lie elected, while
others will cast their votes tor Reagan with the
expressed intent ot sending limmy Carter back
to Plains, Georgia. As a result, many votes will he
canceling each other's votes out, and many
votes that could have put John Anderson in the
White House will be wasted.
This year's presidential election has become
an election ot tear, jimmy Carter has skillfully
exploited this tear, though not always to his
advantage. He has used the antipathy that An
derson voters and liberals in general have to
ward Ronald Reagan to frighten potential An
derson supporters into the Carter column.
To a lesser extent, Republican leaders have
tried to convince their followers that a vote for
Anderson would be tantamount to re-electing
the man they fear — Jimmy Carter. Fear of Car
ter, fear of Reagan, feelings that should have
sent voters into the Anderson camp in droves,
have people afraid to vote for Anderson. Fear
has also generated apathy; reporters covering
this year's election often remark on the lack of
enthusiasm that voters have for Carter and
Reagan.
Actually, voterapathy has increased in inverse
proportion to John Anderson's standing in the
polls. Anyone who remembers John Anderson's
appearance at Stanford last April remembers the
electrifying effect that his abortive primary cam
paign had on Stanford students. But enthusiasm
has given way to resignation as reluctant voters
try to decide whether Carter or Reagan is the
lesser of two evils. They have been bludgeoned
into believing that Anderson doesn't have a
chance by Jimmy Carter, the media, and a mul
titude of conflicting polls.
But polls can be manipulated to anyone's ad
vantage. Pollsters try hard to get respondents to
indicate a preference for one candidate or
another and they don't check to see how many
of the people who respond will actually come
out to vote. Lou Harris tries to get responses that
reflect the opinions of people who intend to
vote, and consequently John Anderson shows
up at 15 to 20 percent in the Harris polls. Harris
and Mervin Field also ask voters who thev would

prefer to have as president, and John Anderson
invariably shows up tirst or a strong second So
who do you believe, the people or the polls?
It you believe the polls and surveys ot the past
two weeks, then get ready tor President Ronald
Reagan. Most sur\eys show him with a sizable
electoral lead, and others show Reagan beating
Carter even in a two-man race. Polls also show
Carter's chances ot beating Reagan one-on-one
in California to be zero. And Carter doesn't
look terribly strong anywhere else west ol the
Mississippi. Polls show him vulnerable in his
native South, the industrial Midwest, and even
in the Northeast.
But the polls have consistently shown other
things, too. They indicate that the Anderson
vote plus the undecided vote nationwide is bet
ween 20 and 30 percent. Neither Carter nor
Reagan has managed to maintain a strong lead,
and neither has polled more than 40 percent ot
the vote in any survey. A majority ot Americans
dissatisfied with a choice between Carter and
Reagan are hoping tor a viable Anderson candi
dacy.
So what makes Anderson viable? How about
the Mervin Field poll that shows Anderson win
ning California it voters think he has a chance to
win on Nov. 4? Look at a recent survey ot Michi
gan votes that shows Reagan with 29 percent ol
the vote, Carter with 27 percent ot the vote,
Anderson with 17 percent ot the vote and 27
percent undecided.
Or listen to some of Ronald Reagan's
pollsters who recently conceded to the Atlantic
Monthly that lohn Anderson was the trontrun
ner in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New
Jersey. Take a look at polls in Washington and
Oregon that show John Anderson running sec
ond with as many as a third ot the voters unde
cided, and examine polls in New York that show
Anderson running a close third.
You can quote polls and surveys until you are
blue in the face. But they still show that it's a
three man race for the presidency in the impor
tant states, and that either Carter, Reagan or
Anderson could become president. The choice
is up to you. You can vote against Carter or
Reagan and get Carter or Reagan, or you can
vote for Anderson and get Anderson. If you
need more convincing that John Anderson is a
winner, conduct a survey of bumperstickers on
the Stanford campus. You'll find John Anderson
comfortably in the lead.

vote, and consequently John Anderson shows
up at 15 to 20 percent in the Harris polls. Harris
and Mervin Field also ask voters who thev would

prefer to have as president, and John Anderson
invariably shows up tirst or a strong second So
who do you believe, the people or the polls?
It you believe the polls and surveys ot the past
two weeks, then get ready tor President Ronald
Reagan. Most sur\eys show him with a sizable
electoral lead, and others show Reagan beating
Carter even in a two-man race. Polls also show
Carter's chances ot beating Reagan one-on-one
in California to be zero. And Carter doesn't
look terribly strong anywhere else west ol the
Mississippi. Polls show him vulnerable in his
native South, the industrial Midwest, and even
in the Northeast.
But the polls have consistently shown other
things, too. They indicate that the Anderson
vote plus the undecided vote nationwide is bet
ween 20 and 30 percent. Neither Carter nor
Reagan has managed to maintain a strong lead,
and neither has polled more than 40 percent ot
the vote in any survey. A majority ot Americans
dissatisfied with a choice between Carter and
Reagan are hoping tor a viable Anderson candi
dacy.
So what makes Anderson viable? How about
the Mervin Field poll that shows Anderson win
ning California it voters think he has a chance to
win on Nov. 4? Look at a recent survey ot Michi
gan votes that shows Reagan with 29 percent ol
the vote, Carter with 27 percent ot the vote,
Anderson with 17 percent ot the vote and 27
percent undecided.
Or listen to some of Ronald Reagan's
pollsters who recently conceded to the Atlantic
Monthly that lohn Anderson was the trontrun
ner in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New
Jersey. Take a look at polls in Washington and
Oregon that show John Anderson running sec
ond with as many as a third ot the voters unde
cided, and examine polls in New York that show
Anderson running a close third.
You can quote polls and surveys until you are
blue in the face. But they still show that it's a
three man race for the presidency in the impor
tant states, and that either Carter, Reagan or
Anderson could become president. The choice
is up to you. You can vote against Carter or
Reagan and get Carter or Reagan, or you can
vote for Anderson and get Anderson. If you
need more convincing that John Anderson is a
winner, conduct a survey of bumperstickers on
the Stanford campus. You'll find John Anderson
comfortably in the lead.

Those figures represent the most recent per
centages trom Mervin Field's California poll,
112 ield asked Calitornians who they wanted in the
White House, and a strong plurality said, "John
Anderson Still many voters insist that John
Anderson is not a \ lable presidential (andidate.

others will cast their votes tor Reagan with the
expressed intent ot sending limmy Carter back

canceling each other's votes out, and many
votes that could have put John Anderson in the
White House will be wasted.
This year's presidential election has become
an election ot tear, jimmy Carter has skillfully
exploited this tear, though not always to his
advantage. He has used the antipathy that An
derson voters and liberals in general have to
ward Ronald Reagan to frighten potential An
derson supporters into the Carter column.
To a lesser extent, Republican leaders have
tried to convince their followers that a vote for
Anderson would be tantamount to re-electing
the man they fear — Jimmy Carter. Fear of Car
ter, fear of Reagan, feelings that should have
sent voters into the Anderson camp in droves,
have people afraid to vote for Anderson. Fear
has also generated apathy; reporters covering
this year's election often remark on the lack of
enthusiasm that voters have for Carter and
Reagan.
Actually, voterapathy has increased in inverse
proportion to John Anderson's standing in the
polls. Anyone who remembers John Anderson's
appearance at Stanford last April remembers the
electrifying effect that his abortive primary cam
paign had on Stanford students. But enthusiasm
has given way to resignation as reluctant voters
try to decide whether Carter or Reagan is the
lesser of two evils. They have been bludgeoned
into believing that Anderson doesn't have a
chance by Jimmy Carter, the media, and a mul
titude of conflicting polls.
But polls can be manipulated to anyone's ad
vantage. Pollsters try hard to get respondents to
indicate a preference for one candidate or
another and they don't check to see how many
of the people who respond will actually come
out to vote. Lou Harris tries to get responses that
reflect the opinions of people who intend to
vote, and consequently John Anderson shows
