## Preserve the memory of a sacred alumnus 
### 
Last August, when Ted Ken
nedy delivered that much
celebrated address to the
Democratic National Conven
tion, he pompously bellowed,
"And we will not allow the
party of which Herbert Hoover
was a a member to use the hal
lowed name of our own
Franklin Delano Roosevelt to
its advantage." That boorish,
little statement elicited a
deafening cheer from the face
less sea of conventioneers, in
terspersed with loud snicker
ings of, "Herbert Hoover, Ha!
What a marshmallow." The
next day, President Jimmy Car
ter made similar disparaging
remarks against our beloved
alumnus.
We, the Stanford students,
must put an end to this cruel
debauchery. We must prevent
double H's sacred name from
being maligned. And the only
way to accomplish this all im
portant task is to establish the
Herbert Clark Hoover anti
defamation league and fan
club. The league would peti
tion both political parties, de
manding amendments to their

platforms stating: "We're sorry
for ranking on Herbert
Hoover, he was not a mar
shmallow, he was actually a
pretty swell guy."
And it won't stop there.
Every city will have a Herbert
Hoover Memorial Academy of
Beauty, a Herbert Hoover
Shopping Plaza, and a Herbert
Hoover Sewage Treatment
Plant. Soon his name will beon
the tip of every tongue in every
city in every state in the coun
try. Then we can all put to
gether a Broadway show called
"Hoovermania," complete
with a slide show of happy-go
lucky people standing in
breadlines, living in "Hoover
villes," or trying to find some
one who thinks that buying a
rotten apple for a dime is a
good deal. Oh, it would be
great.
Some of you may be a little
confused. "Why laud the man
who brought us the Great De
pression?" you might wonder.
Well, first off, none of us is
without faults. Carter is not
doing such a hot job. Reagan is
a fascist, Ford was incompe

tent, and Nixon. . .
Secondly, Herb (pro
nounced "Erb") did much that
sets him head and shoulders
above any president since: He
graduated from Stanford Uni
versity in 1895; he was the
chairman of the Boy's Club of
America, and what is really
amazing, he was once the rep
resentative for the United
States of America to the

World's Fair. Need I say more?
I bring this plan to you, the
Stanford student body, be
cause we can make a mint off
this guy. We can sell souvenir
scale models of Hoover Tower,
the largest phallic symbol de
dicated to a man since the
Washington monument. We
can charter trips to visit the
great dam that bears his name.

And what is truly exciting, we
can produce an entire line of
Hoover household appliances:
Hoover washing machines,
Hoover dishwashers, Hoover
trash compactors, even
Hoover vacuum cleaners!
Okay, skip the vacuum
cleaners.
