Tampon danger
Toxic shock syndrome is
word mechanics. Toxic shock
syndrome is the murderand at
tempted murder of women by
big business. To this date and
and even after the surfacing of
many statistics connected with
this national disgrace, leading
groups are hedging the fence,
warning against the use of the
"super absorbent" variety of
tampon.
Proctor and Gamble has re
moved Rely tampons from the
shelf. Small, slow moves to halt
the use of tampons are taking
place when at this late date
there should be concentrated
war against the use of all tam
pons.
The tampon giants are also
the producers and manufac
turers of sanitary napkins, baby
disposable diapers and a host
of other consumer products,
which are not under stringent
guidelines in the manufactur
ing process. Scary? Sure it is.
Let's get scared enough to do
something about it.
Toxic shock syndrome is not
a female problem: it is a human
problem. A whole generation
of women have been brain
washed into using tampons in
stead of other alternatives due
to mass advertising, clothing
designs, and many other hooks
into the female consumer.
I appeal to every man and
woman who is capable of pick
ing up a pen and expressing
your views to demand a halt to
the manufacture and sale of
any tampon. Women of
menstrual age, who are ignor
ant as to other options availa
ble to them should contact
their local women's health cen
ters. Women engaged in
sports, which call for scantier
clothing, e.g. swimming, can

resort to the use of a diap
hragm while engaged in these
activities.
All concerned individuals
should write to their legis
lators, congressmen, and de
mand laws which will result in
(he ban of tampons. By re
education and reprogramming
of males and females, the open
discussions necessary to eradi
cate this blight will result.

Toxic shock is ban the tam
pon time. A boycott will bring
some results, but do not doubt
the power of the people in an
election year. Now is the time
to do it. Remember, the life
you save may be your
own ... or your loved ones
. . . wife, lover, mother, sister
or daughter.
