## Low readiness plagues army 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Fort Benning, Ga. — The early morning sun was hardly above
the horizon, but the Georgia countryside already was steeped in
heat as members of the Ist Infantry Training Brigade went
through physical training one day last spring at this sprawling
military base.
Col. H .C. Van Meter, commander of the9o()o-member brigade,
was running with the tatigue-clad trainees when he spotted one
man starting to falter. "Cojne on, soldier," the lean, 44-year-old
officer snapped, grabbing the trainee's arm.
Tired, hot and unhappy, the huffing trainee did not respond
well to his commander's encouragement. He wheeled and, with
out a word, slammed Van Meter with a roundhouse righthand
punch.
"Everyone was shocked — the colonel most of all. He just stood
stock still and stared," recalled an officer who was nearby.
Accounts of similar incidents abound at other bases, where
there is growing concern, expressed openly by many drill instruc
tors and some training-company commanders, about loose dis
cipline and, more important, the low quality of recruits now
joining the all-volunteer Army.
An army of losers?
"We are turning into an army of losers," observed a drill
sergeant at Fort Dix. N.J., referring to the low educational level
and economic status of many recruits. "We get the dropouts, the
quitters, the ones who can't get decent jobs. They can't makeit in
outside society, so they join the Army."
But the quality and discipline of recruits are only two of the
many problems plaguing the U.S. military, whose ability to fight
has come under increasing scrutiny as international tensions
have heightened.
Other difficulties, all serious, range from shortages of skilled
personnel and soaring costs to aging equipment and inadequate
supply capabilities.
The stateside situation was summed up by a recent Pentagon
report declaring that, as of December, six of the Army's 10 com
bat divisions in the United States were "not combat-ready." That
low rating, which remains applicable, supports testimony by
Gen. Edward Meyer, Army chief of staff who has warned Con
gress about relying on a "hollow army."
"If a war broke out tomorrow," Sgt. Michael Jackson said, "I'd
head in the other direction. Not because I'm scared or unpatrio
tic, but because I train these troops. I know that when they leave
this place, they're not ready to fight. Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding himself."
Has American military muscle turned soft?
Positive assessments
Many old-timers, like Fort Benning's Maj. Gen. David Grange,
question the validity of those low readiness ratings. Having
served with the Rangers, Airborne and Special Forces, Grange
drew upon nearly four decades' military experience to put them
in different perspective.
"In the past, we sent into action a lot of divisions that, by
today's standards, probably would have been judged not ready,"
he said. "But they didn't know they weren't ready, and nobody
told them, and in the end they did pretty damn well. We're going
overboard these days with our computers and statistics and rating
systems. I think these soldiers are as good as any that ever wore
the American uniform."
Agreeing with Grange was a top-echelon officer of the Seventh
Division. "I've been hearing the same bitching and the same
bad-mouthing of U.S. soldiers since I entered the service after
World War II," said the officer, who requested anonymity.

through physical training one day last spring at this sprawling
military base.
Col. H .C. Van Meter, commander of the9o()o-member brigade,
was running with the tatigue-clad trainees when he spotted one
man starting to falter. "Cojne on, soldier," the lean, 44-year-old
officer snapped, grabbing the trainee's arm.
Tired, hot and unhappy, the huffing trainee did not respond
well to his commander's encouragement. He wheeled and, with
out a word, slammed Van Meter with a roundhouse righthand
punch.
"Everyone was shocked — the colonel most of all. He just stood
stock still and stared," recalled an officer who was nearby.
Accounts of similar incidents abound at other bases, where
there is growing concern, expressed openly by many drill instruc
tors and some training-company commanders, about loose dis
cipline and, more important, the low quality of recruits now
joining the all-volunteer Army.
An army of losers?
"We are turning into an army of losers," observed a drill
sergeant at Fort Dix. N.J., referring to the low educational level
and economic status of many recruits. "We get the dropouts, the
quitters, the ones who can't get decent jobs. They can't makeit in
outside society, so they join the Army."
But the quality and discipline of recruits are only two of the
many problems plaguing the U.S. military, whose ability to fight
has come under increasing scrutiny as international tensions
have heightened.
Other difficulties, all serious, range from shortages of skilled
personnel and soaring costs to aging equipment and inadequate
supply capabilities.
The stateside situation was summed up by a recent Pentagon
report declaring that, as of December, six of the Army's 10 com
bat divisions in the United States were "not combat-ready." That
low rating, which remains applicable, supports testimony by
Gen. Edward Meyer, Army chief of staff who has warned Con
gress about relying on a "hollow army."
"If a war broke out tomorrow," Sgt. Michael Jackson said, "I'd
head in the other direction. Not because I'm scared or unpatrio
tic, but because I train these troops. I know that when they leave
this place, they're not ready to fight. Anyone who says otherwise
is kidding himself."
Has American military muscle turned soft?
Positive assessments
Many old-timers, like Fort Benning's Maj. Gen. David Grange,
question the validity of those low readiness ratings. Having
served with the Rangers, Airborne and Special Forces, Grange
drew upon nearly four decades' military experience to put them
in different perspective.
"In the past, we sent into action a lot of divisions that, by
today's standards, probably would have been judged not ready,"
he said. "But they didn't know they weren't ready, and nobody
told them, and in the end they did pretty damn well. We're going
overboard these days with our computers and statistics and rating
systems. I think these soldiers are as good as any that ever wore
the American uniform."
Agreeing with Grange was a top-echelon officer of the Seventh
Division. "I've been hearing the same bitching and the same
bad-mouthing of U.S. soldiers since I entered the service after
World War II," said the officer, who requested anonymity.
