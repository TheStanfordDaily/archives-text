# Kickbacks to union alleged
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
New York — Attorneys for the Department of
Justice have run into a stone wall of Caribbean
bank secrecy in pursuing allegations that hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks have
been paid to officials of the Teamsters Union's
Central States Pension Fund.
Federal court records show that two Cayman
Islands corporations are suspected of having
laundered the kickbacks from the recipient of a
$4.5 million pension tund loan.
A federal judge has ruled that he lacks the
power to force a Cayman Islands bank to pro
duce records that the Department of Justice is
seeking to help settle the issue.
Bank secrecy laws
But Judge Eugene Nickerson said that Con
gress could resolve the problem by requiring
"pertinent information" from foreign corpora
tions "trarismitting funds to this country."
The kickback case is reachinga conclusion ata
time when Senate investigators are checking
into activities of the Teamster pension tund and
how the government has monitored these ac
tivities.
The case highlights the frustrations encoun
tered by federal sleuths when they confront the
strict bank secrecy laws of most Caribbean na

tions.
James Harmon, the government attorney
heading the case, told Nickerson in court papers
that "billions of dollars of funds obtained from
illegal sources disappear into Cayman banks'
each year.
Alleged kickbacks
Not all the government's evidence in this case
is revealed in the court filings. However, in
flated loans that are not backed up by sufficient
collateral have been granted by pension fund
trustees in other instances. A common theory of
federal investigators is that part of the loan pro
ceeds are kicked back to the lenders in such
cases.
An affidavit by Harmon said the suspected
funnels for the kickbacks were two Cayman
corporations associated with Arawak Trust Co.
— Christine Ltd. and Sea Houses Ltd. The iden
tity of the alleged recipients was not disclosed.
lhe judge in his ruling suggested that Con
gress might "require any foreign corporation
transmitting funds to this country to provide . . .
pertinent information held outside of the coun
try to a grand jury, on pain of having those assets
proceeded against if the corporation fails to
comply."
