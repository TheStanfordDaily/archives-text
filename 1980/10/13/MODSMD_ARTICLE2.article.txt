# Commission recommends consideration of humanities
## Humanities report notes its importance throughout education 
### Mac Funk 
Stating that "the humanities are a social good and
their well-being is in the national interest," a report of
the Commission on the Humanities released last week
called for a "reconsideration of the purposes oi the
humanities in education and public life, and a mobiliza
tion of resources in their behalf."
The basic premise of the report, stated the commis
sion, was that "the humanities are widely undervalued
and often poorly understood."
The commission was composed of 32 members, half
of them educators and the rest representatives from
foundations, business, politics and the arts. It was spon
sored by the Rockefeller Foundation.
The report, representing the first comprehensive as
sessment of education in the humanities in America
since 1964, outlined several "major needs for American
education and cultural life in the 1980'5."
"The highest priority is to improve the quality of edu
cation in our elementary and secondary schools," the

report stated. This improvement will be accomplished
by reemphasizing the study of humanities, the report
asserted, because through the humanities, "one ac
quires not only literacy but conceptual, critical and
aesthetic capacities as basic as literacy itself."
Among the scholars serving on the committee which
met five times over the last two years, was Assoc. Politi
cal Science Prof. Nannerl Keohane.
Keohane said the commission decided in its early
stages that the study of humanities was tending to "fall
between the cracks" in today's school systems, and that
this was an issue in "urgent need of attention."
"Liberal arts education is designed to prepare indi
viduals for the next step," said Keohane. "But that edu
cation also needs the component of the humanities,
because the humanities provide the critical ability to
help each person become a fuller individual."
The report detailed two specific areas of concern in
current educational systems.
In the first place, asserted the report, the current

"back to basics" movement is resulting in educational
goals only as ambitious as high quantitative testing re
sults.
"Whenever academic achievement is reduced to what
<an be measured by standardized testing, the
liiiMnanities are likely to be misunderstood as expenda
ble trills," the report stated.
Secondly, the report questioned the wisdom of em
phasizing vocational education as an insurance against
times of economic uncertainty, at the expense of the
study of the humanities.
The humanities contain the spirit to "search for solu
tions to human problems" and to "go beyond what has
been thought, said and done before," the commission
asserted. During times of economic challenge "we can
ill afford to starve that spirit."
In the same vein, the report urged professional
schools that train students in law, medicine and busi
ness to require applicants to those schools to have "sub
stantial background in the humanities."

"Students who pass over the liberal arts in a prema
ture quest for expertise are not likely to be better profes
sionals, the report said. "Indeed, they will probably be
less capable."
Especially in the realm of science and technology, the
report stated, it is becoming dangerous for the
humanities to be overlooked.
"Urgent ethical and social questions are being raised
in the behavioral sciences and in areas of biomedicine,"
the report declares. In addition, questions about pollu
tion and about constraints on growth are "essentially
ethical and aesthetic."
"Today the feeling is stronger than ever before that the
construction of technological devices cannot be jus
tified without regard for the consequences," the com
mission stated.
"People can use the humanities to reach judgements
about questions that may seem to be chiefly scientific or
technical but really depend for answers on ethics, tradi
tions, sensibilities, and values."
