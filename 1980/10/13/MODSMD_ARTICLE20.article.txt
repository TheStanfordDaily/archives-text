# Third 'no-growth' budget in a row
## Budget deficit shrinks 
### 
By The Washington Post
Washington — Federal de
partments are submitting
spending requests for'fiscal
1982 far beyond the administra
tion's tentative budget
guidelines, apparently on the
theory that President limmv
Carter is too vulnerable politi
cally this year to turn them
down.
If not repulsed, the budget
ary onslaught, which involves
both Pentagon and domestic
spending programs, would
push the deficit for fiscal 1982
well above the $45 billion red
ink figure projected for fiscal
1981 — and possibly near the
fiscal 1980s estimated deficit of
$61 billion.
White House officials con
cede they will have to slash
these initial budget requests

sharply to hold the growth ot
the budget to an acceptable
level. The president still hopes
to pare spending enough to
bring the budget into balance
by tisc al 198 5, if he is re-elec ted
next month.
Given the tax cut Carter has
proposed tor next year,
analysts say that to hit his
target, the president will have
to limit the overall spending
increase in fiscal 19H2 to only
what is needed to cover intla
tion, making this his third es
sentially "no-growth" budget
in a row.
The administration con
ceded in August that the 11 s c a I
1982 deficit would run at least
as high as $ib.l billion. That as
sumed no spending boosts
beyond those needed to keep
pace with inflation. An in
crease of even a few tenths ot a
percentage point could add
billions more.
The fiscal 1982 budget, to be
sent to Congress next January,
will essentially decide federal
spending no matter who wins
the election. Because of the
way the budget timetable
works, Republican presidential
candidate Ronald Reagan
would be able to make only
minimal changes if elected.
Carter was bound by the
same constraints in his fiscal
1977 budget, but he still man
aged to propose a tax cut for
calendar 1977.
Officials say the major ditti
culty is in the military budget,
where Pentagon planners al
ready have served notice that
they plan to request several
billion dollars more in detense
spending than the White
House had tentatively targeted
for fiscal 1982.
Under pressure from Senate
conservatives, Carter already
had agreed to allow the de
fense budget to grow 5 to 6
percent beyond what is

needed to (over inflation,
rather than tht• i percent real
growth he proposed last
January. However, initial Pen
tagon estimates would exceed
that goal.
There is little expectation,
either in or outside the Penta
gon, that the Defense Depart
ment will get everything it is
asking tor. "They're shooting
tor the moon," a White House
official said. He noted that ini
tial detense requests tradition
ally overreach their targets.
However, insiders say the
same sort of "go-tor-broke
mentality" is evident in re
quests from other key depart
ments and agencies, including
many that involve major
domestic "entitlement" prog
rams — those with open
ended financing obligations
tied to caseloads or population
growth.
Some otticials speculated
that those agencies, whose
budgets have been held down
for the last two fiscal years, are
trying to catch up at a time they
believe the president might be
receptive.
Normally the budget is
pretty tar along by this time in
the year, but insiders say Car
ter intentionally has retrained
from becoming involved in this
January's budgetmaking until
after the November election.
The informal fiscal 1982
budget request submitted by
the Pentagon translates into
about $11 billion over previous
guidelines in terms ot so-called
"total obligational authority"
to spend in 1982 and in future
years.
White House sources stres
sed that all of the budget
request figures — including
those from the Pentagon —are
prelim inary, informal and
highly tentative. Formal re
quests are not due in until
November.

official said. He noted that ini

However, insiders say the

mentality" is evident in re
quests from other key depart

many that involve major
domestic "entitlement" prog
rams — those with open
ended financing obligations
tied to caseloads or population
growth.
Some otticials speculated

The informal fiscal 1982
budget request submitted by
the Pentagon translates into
about $11 billion over previous
guidelines in terms ot so-called
"total obligational authority"
to spend in 1982 and in future
years.
White House sources stres
sed that all of the budget
request figures — including
those from the Pentagon —are
prelim inary, informal and
highly tentative. Formal re
quests are not due in until
November.
By The Washington Post
Washington — Federal de
partments are submitting
spending requests for'fiscal
1982 far beyond the administra
tion's tentative budget
guidelines, apparently on the
theory that President limmv
Carter is too vulnerable politi
cally this year to turn them
down.
If not repulsed, the budget
ary onslaught, which involves
both Pentagon and domestic
spending programs, would
push the deficit for fiscal 1982
well above the $45 billion red
ink figure projected for fiscal
1981 — and possibly near the
fiscal 1980s estimated deficit of
$61 billion.
White House officials con
cede they will have to slash
these initial budget requests

sharply to hold the growth ot
the budget to an acceptable
level. The president still hopes
to pare spending enough to
bring the budget into balance
by tisc al 198 5, if he is re-elec ted
next month.
Given the tax cut Carter has
proposed tor next year,
analysts say that to hit his
target, the president will have
to limit the overall spending
increase in fiscal 19H2 to only
what is needed to cover intla
tion, making this his third es
sentially "no-growth" budget
in a row.
The administration con
ceded in August that the 11 s c a I
1982 deficit would run at least
as high as $ib.l billion. That as
sumed no spending boosts
beyond those needed to keep
pace with inflation. An in
crease of even a few tenths ot a
percentage point could add
billions more.
The fiscal 1982 budget, to be
sent to Congress next January,
will essentially decide federal
spending no matter who wins
the election. Because of the
way the budget timetable
works, Republican presidential
candidate Ronald Reagan
would be able to make only
minimal changes if elected.
Carter was bound by the
same constraints in his fiscal
1977 budget, but he still man
aged to propose a tax cut for
calendar 1977.
Officials say the major ditti
culty is in the military budget,
where Pentagon planners al
ready have served notice that
they plan to request several
billion dollars more in detense
spending than the White
House had tentatively targeted
for fiscal 1982.
Under pressure from Senate
conservatives, Carter already
had agreed to allow the de
fense budget to grow 5 to 6
percent beyond what is

needed to (over inflation,
rather than tht• i percent real
growth he proposed last
January. However, initial Pen
tagon estimates would exceed
that goal.
