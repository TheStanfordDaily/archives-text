# People's Teahouse offers unique study break alternative
## 
### Clay Moltz 
The People's Teahouse. To
many students on the Stanford
campus it's just a name, but to
people in Wilbur Hall and
many Asian-American students
it's the place to grab a snack
and a study break in an inti
mate, Asian atmosphere.
Since September 1971,
when it replaced a floundering
cafe on the same site, the
Teahouse has become a bustl
ing and financially successful
operation, a place to "kick
back and get together" as pub
licity manager Eugene Toy put
it.
The Teahouse reopened for
its ninth consecutive year
Wednesday night, serving the
same hot bao (rice cakes stuf
fed with barbequed pork), sui
mai (a rice and ground pork
mixture) and ramen noodles
that made up its menu last
year, along with some newly
introduced items.
Prices at the Teahouse are
notoriously low compared to

other on-campus eateries — a
result, Toy said, ol two factors:
first, the Teahouse buys in bulk
from a Chinese food
wholesaler in San Francisco,
and second, the "kitchen" is
run by volunteer workers from
Sunday through Friday, 9 to 12
p.m. „
Currently, there are about 35
volunteers. Compensation for
services comes in the form of
half-priced food at the
Teahouse on the volunteers'
nights off.
Guiding these working vol
unteers is an overseer staff of
five which handles the busi
ness aspects such as account
ing, purchasing and managing
food, personnel (primarily
making up work schedules)
and publicity.
The Teahouse is essentially a
non-profit organization and
donates all receipts above cost
to particular Asian-American
activities on-campus and off.
Such donations have funded in
the past an "awareness" bus

trip tor Palo Alto and Stanford
Asian-Americans to a nearby
historical site where
Japanese-Americans were in
terned during World War 11,
and more recently made pos
sible the Asian-American new
student orientation.
"Officially there are no ties"
between the Teahouse and
AASA (Asian-American Stu
dents Association), said Toy, but
Asians especially seem to be
drawn to the Teahouse.
One long-time customer
said he finds solace from Uni
versity lood Service here and
said of the Teahouse cuisine,
"These foods are endearing to
my heart. . .they (at the
Teahouse) have good tea. They
don't buy the cheap stuff."
The menu is simple; the hot
dishes — bao, sui mai, ramen
noodles, and newly added har
gau (shrimp inside hot rice
dough); sodas (includingsome
exotic flavors like black
cherry); and almond cookies,

rice crackers, and lortune
cookies. At present, no item on
the menu costs more than 40
(ents.
Toy explained how the food
process works. Fvery two
weeks, tresh supplies are
bought in San Francisco and
taken directly to a freezer shell
in Wilbur food service which
the Teahouse uses without
charge.
Nightly, a certain amount of
each item is taken into the
Teahouse kitchen and put on
steamers so that it can be
served hot. The ramen noodles

are an exception; they're
c ooked order-by-order be
< ause, Foy explained, excess
steaming makes them soggy.
When the Teahouse gets til
led with the studv break (rowd
the operators say Monday
and Tuesday nights are the
busiest — the line tor tood may
extend out the door.
Often, however, people just
come in for a while to sit down
and talk without ordering. He
cause the idea behind the
Teahouse is to provide "at
mosphere," and a nit e plat e to
go to get a taste ot Asian ( ul

ture, the stall doesn't mind
this.
The Feahouse is decorated
in Oriental simplicity, highligh
ted by colorful murals on two
ol the walls painted gratis by a
student last year. The
Teahouse essentially consists
ol one large room, hut is di
vided by a tam, basket-weave
curtain between a section with
low tables and pillow-seating
and an area with Western ta
bles and (hairs.
The kite lien is open to com
mon view, and is ornamented
with the large printed menu

and brass-colored teapots that
hang above the looking area.
Sott stereo music adds t< i tin
relaxed environment.
Future plans at the
Teahouse, according to lov
include installing a tew new
lanterns and tables, and has ing
certain speua 1 events such
as a ninth anniversary partv
scheduled lor later this quar
ter.
The Teahouse is located .it

and more recently made pos
sible the Asian-American new
student orientation.
"Officially there are no ties"
between the Teahouse and
AASA (Asian-American Stu
dents Association), said Toy, but
Asians especially seem to be
drawn to the Teahouse.
One long-time customer
said he finds solace from Uni
versity lood Service here and
said of the Teahouse cuisine,
"These foods are endearing to
my heart. . .they (at the
Teahouse) have good tea. They
don't buy the cheap stuff."
The menu is simple; the hot
dishes — bao, sui mai, ramen
noodles, and newly added har
gau (shrimp inside hot rice
dough); sodas (includingsome
exotic flavors like black
cherry); and almond cookies,

rice crackers, and lortune
cookies. At present, no item on
the menu costs more than 40
(ents.
Toy explained how the food
process works. Fvery two
weeks, tresh supplies are
bought in San Francisco and
taken directly to a freezer shell
in Wilbur food service which
the Teahouse uses without
charge.
Nightly, a certain amount of
each item is taken into the
Teahouse kitchen and put on
steamers so that it can be
served hot. The ramen noodles

are an exception; they're
c ooked order-by-order be
< ause, Foy explained, excess
steaming makes them soggy.
When the Teahouse gets til

the operators say Monday
and Tuesday nights are the
busiest — the line tor tood may
extend out the door.
Often, however, people just
come in for a while to sit down
and talk without ordering. He
cause the idea behind the
Teahouse is to provide "at

this.
The Feahouse is decorated
in Oriental simplicity, highligh
ted by colorful murals on two
ol the walls painted gratis by a
student last year. The
Teahouse essentially consists
ol one large room, hut is di
vided by a tam, basket-weave
curtain between a section with
low tables and pillow-seating
and an area with Western ta
bles and (hairs.
The kite lien is open to com
mon view, and is ornamented
with the large printed menu

and brass-colored teapots that
hang above the looking area.
Sott stereo music adds t< i tin
relaxed environment.
Future plans at the
Teahouse, according to lov
include installing a tew new
lanterns and tables, and has ing
certain speua 1 events such
as a ninth anniversary partv
scheduled lor later this quar

The Teahouse is located .it
Wilbur Hall near the tood ser
vic «* entrance and vending

The People's Teahouse. To
many students on the Stanford
campus it's just a name, but to
people in Wilbur Hall and
many Asian-American students
it's the place to grab a snack
and a study break in an inti
mate, Asian atmosphere.
Since September 1971,
when it replaced a floundering
cafe on the same site, the
Teahouse has become a bustl
ing and financially successful
operation, a place to "kick
back and get together" as pub
licity manager Eugene Toy put
it.
The Teahouse reopened for
its ninth consecutive year
Wednesday night, serving the
same hot bao (rice cakes stuf
fed with barbequed pork), sui
mai (a rice and ground pork
mixture) and ramen noodles
that made up its menu last
year, along with some newly
introduced items.
Prices at the Teahouse are
notoriously low compared to

other on-campus eateries — a
result, Toy said, ol two factors:
first, the Teahouse buys in bulk
from a Chinese food
wholesaler in San Francisco,
and second, the "kitchen" is
run by volunteer workers from
Sunday through Friday, 9 to 12
p.m. „
Currently, there are about 35
volunteers. Compensation for
services comes in the form of
half-priced food at the
Teahouse on the volunteers'
nights off.
Guiding these working vol
unteers is an overseer staff of
five which handles the busi
ness aspects such as account
ing, purchasing and managing
food, personnel (primarily
making up work schedules)
and publicity.
The Teahouse is essentially a
non-profit organization and
donates all receipts above cost
to particular Asian-American
activities on-campus and off.
Such donations have funded in
the past an "awareness" bus

trip tor Palo Alto and Stanford
Asian-Americans to a nearby
historical site where
Japanese-Americans were in
terned during World War 11,
and more recently made pos
sible the Asian-American new
student orientation.
