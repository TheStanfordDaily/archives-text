# Freeman is super vs. mortal Cards

Los Angeles — Freeman McNeil's performance Saturday ought
not to be chronicled in newspapers, but in comic books. Journals
depicting his feats in UCLA's 35-21 triumph over Stanford belong
in magazine racks at drugstores and smoke shops, next to "Ar
chie"and "Captain America."
After all, what an adventure it was. Pursued and trapped by a
relentless Stanford defense, McNeil gained only 28yards on nine
carries in the first half.
While his teammates stewed in the locker room, pondering
their 21 -7 halftime deficit, McNeil entered a nearby phone booth.
He hurriedly shucked his football uniform and pulled on a set of
blue tights with a red cape. A red "S" against a gold shield was
emblazoned on his new togs over his chest.
McNeil put back on his pants, pads and jersey over this ex
traordinary regalia just in time to join his Bruin teammates for
the second half.
Responding to the cries of a distressed Terry Donahue,
McNeil thereafter treated the Cardinal defenders like so many
Lex Luthors.
Running faster than a speeding bullet and leaping over tall
linebackers in a single bound, McNeil amassed 220 yards in 20
carries in the second half, a school record. His total of 248 yards
was the second-best single-game effort in UCLA history, behind
only Theotis Brown's 274-yard day against Oregon in 1978. His
four rushing touchdowns tied the Bruin mark he established last
season against California and equaled the mark for total
touchdowns in one game that he already shared with Kermit
Alexander.
Having left their kryptonite in the locker room at halftime, the
Cards became defenseless — literally. McNeil and the Bruins
scored on each of their first four possessions after intermission.
To at least two Cards, UCLA's sudden dominance was both sur
prising and confounding.
"I was just talking with Doug Rogers about that, and neither of
us could figure it out," a nonplussed Craig Zellmer said. "We can't
tell if we played worse or if they played better."
Stanford defensive coordinator jack Harbaugh subscribed to
the former theory, particularly regarding McNeil.
"We got people to the ball and seemed much fresher (in the
first half)," Harbaugh said. "Later, we weren't charging him with
the same tenacity — we gave him some creases."
Card head coach Paul Wiggin, however, gave the Bruins credit
for their second-half improvement. "We came out well — I think
they must have gained something," he said.
McNeil believed the most important asset UCLA gained was

"togetherness" in its blocking. The offensive linemen, he said,
lacked a consistency and timing in their blocks during the first
half.
"In order for us to beat them, we had to come together and
block them the way we're used to blocking," McNeil said. "But
we came out and we weren't together. The new coach they have
(Wiggin) is defensively oriented, and their defense played us
tough in the first half. They were doing some good things."
McNeil also admitted that the Bruins felt somewhat deflated
after their 17-0 trouncing last week of then-No. 2 Ohio State.
"I knew something was wrong. Stanford was a team that's not
as physical as other teams we've played, so why weren't we
moving the ball the way we did against those other teams?"
McNeil said he wondered.
At halftime, the Bruin braintrust decided to try and run more
on the Cards. "Jesus Christ, they're gonna be looking for me
every time I get the ball," McNeil initially thought.
What the Cards usually saw of McNeil, however, was a blue
and-gold blur who proved difficult to bring to earth.
"He's really tough kid. He runs really hard, and he has great
balance. He doesn't stop until he's completely down. There's no
way one guy can stop him," Zellmer said. "You need three or
four," Harbaugh added.
Now the Cards know how Lex Luthor felt.

after their 17-0 trouncing last week of then-No. 2 Ohio State.
"I knew something was wrong. Stanford was a team that's not
as physical as other teams we've played, so why weren't we
moving the ball the way we did against those other teams?"
McNeil said he wondered.
At halftime, the Bruin braintrust decided to try and run more
on the Cards. "Jesus Christ, they're gonna be looking for me
every time I get the ball," McNeil initially thought.
What the Cards usually saw of McNeil, however, was a blue
and-gold blur who proved difficult to bring to earth.
"He's really tough kid. He runs really hard, and he has great
balance. He doesn't stop until he's completely down. There's no
way one guy can stop him," Zellmer said. "You need three or
four," Harbaugh added.
Now the Cards know how Lex Luthor felt.
Los Angeles — Freeman McNeil's performance Saturday ought
not to be chronicled in newspapers, but in comic books. Journals
depicting his feats in UCLA's 35-21 triumph over Stanford belong
in magazine racks at drugstores and smoke shops, next to "Ar
chie"and "Captain America."
After all, what an adventure it was. Pursued and trapped by a
relentless Stanford defense, McNeil gained only 28yards on nine
carries in the first half.
While his teammates stewed in the locker room, pondering
their 21 -7 halftime deficit, McNeil entered a nearby phone booth.
He hurriedly shucked his football uniform and pulled on a set of
blue tights with a red cape. A red "S" against a gold shield was
emblazoned on his new togs over his chest.
McNeil put back on his pants, pads and jersey over this ex
traordinary regalia just in time to join his Bruin teammates for
the second half.
Responding to the cries of a distressed Terry Donahue,
McNeil thereafter treated the Cardinal defenders like so many
Lex Luthors.
Running faster than a speeding bullet and leaping over tall
linebackers in a single bound, McNeil amassed 220 yards in 20
carries in the second half, a school record. His total of 248 yards
was the second-best single-game effort in UCLA history, behind
only Theotis Brown's 274-yard day against Oregon in 1978. His
four rushing touchdowns tied the Bruin mark he established last
season against California and equaled the mark for total
touchdowns in one game that he already shared with Kermit
Alexander.
Having left their kryptonite in the locker room at halftime, the
Cards became defenseless — literally. McNeil and the Bruins
scored on each of their first four possessions after intermission.
To at least two Cards, UCLA's sudden dominance was both sur
prising and confounding.
"I was just talking with Doug Rogers about that, and neither of
us could figure it out," a nonplussed Craig Zellmer said. "We can't
tell if we played worse or if they played better."
Stanford defensive coordinator jack Harbaugh subscribed to
the former theory, particularly regarding McNeil.
"We got people to the ball and seemed much fresher (in the
first half)," Harbaugh said. "Later, we weren't charging him with
the same tenacity — we gave him some creases."
Card head coach Paul Wiggin, however, gave the Bruins credit
for their second-half improvement. "We came out well — I think
they must have gained something," he said.
McNeil believed the most important asset UCLA gained was

"togetherness" in its blocking. The offensive linemen, he said,
lacked a consistency and timing in their blocks during the first
half.
"In order for us to beat them, we had to come together and
block them the way we're used to blocking," McNeil said. "But
we came out and we weren't together. The new coach they have
(Wiggin) is defensively oriented, and their defense played us
tough in the first half. They were doing some good things."
McNeil also admitted that the Bruins felt somewhat deflated
after their 17-0 trouncing last week of then-No. 2 Ohio State.
