# Tailback leads UCLA over Stanford 35-21
## McNeil's half is whole thing for UCLA

Los Angeles — lack Harbaugh sat alone, slumped
against the wall of the visitor's locker room in the I os
Angeles Coliseum He held a drink in one hand, his
head in the other. Harbaugh looked as it he was in
mourning; he might very well have been. After all,
the Stantord defense he coaches had just been lett for
dead, a victim of one of the greatest single-half per
formances in the history ot the game.
UCLA tailback Freeman McNeil came out of the
halttime locker room running and did not stop for the
remainder of the atternoon. Hour touchdowns and
220 yards later, McNeil had almost single-handedly
blitzed the Cardinal defense in leading fifth-ranked
UCLA to a 35-21 comeback win Saturday.
Witha revitalized UCLAoffensivelineopeninggap
ing holes in Stanford's defensive line, the Bruins
overcame a 21-7 halftime deficit and bulled their way
to their fifth win in as many tries.
After being constrained to 28 yards in the first half
by both a swarming Stanford defense and his own
team's game plan, McNeil exploded downfield in the
final twoquarters, scoringtrom 12, 72,6and42yards.
"He's a great back. We held him for awhile," Har
baugh said of McNeil. "He would rate up there with
the greats. I've seen Archie Griffin and all of those
guys. He was exceptional today."
Of course, McNeil could not do it alone. First there
had to be a decision to give him the ball. UCLA scored
on its opening drive with a mixture of McNeil's run
ning and quarterback Tom Ramsey's rollout passing.
When Ronnie Deßose caught the seven-yard pass for
a touchdown, it looked like the Bruins would mix
their offense well all afternoon.
But that offense soon began to sputter and cough
as if the smog that enveloped the crowd of 64,175 had
clogged its valves. The Bruins did not score again in
the half, and clearly it was time to re-evaluate.
In the second half, all UCLA did was send McNeil
onward through the smog like an army: left, right,
left, right. And if he ran over five or six Stanford
defenders on the way, well, gee guys, sorry.
"By the middle of the third quarter we were physi

cally whipped," Harbaugh said. Their front seven
was consistently handling our tront seven.''
"We had them beat, we just let down," detensive
tackle Doug Rogers said. "It is very trustrating to
work all week and have this happen. The guys weren't
carrying out assignments. We weren't wrapping up
on tackles. They would keep on churning after we
had given up."
Rogers c ompared this tall-trom-ahead loss to Stan
ford's comeback 21-21 tie with USC here last year,
when the Cards fought trom a 21-0 halttime deticit.
But here, it was the Cards who took the big lead in the
first half.
Stanford's first-halt scoring drives were executed
quite well with the aid ot Damn Nelson, thank you.
Nelson, who gained 102 yards in 17 carries silenced
those who wondered where his outside runs had
gone when he scored the first two touchdowns lor
Stanford. Both runs were sweeps left, which happens
to be the side of the line where Brian Flolloway and
Mike Neill work.
On the first touchdown, late in the opening quar
ter, Nelson went 17 yards, cutting up the middle of
the field after juking Bruin defenders to their knees.
The second score from JO yards out, was aided by a
downfield block from tight end Chris Dressel. When
John Elway hit Andre Tyler trom five yards out for a
phantom touchdown minutes later (the replay
showed Tyler feet landed out of bounds), it looked
like the Cards might have been back in the upset
business.
Matters looked even better when Charles Hutch
ings, who had been burned by UCLA split end Cor
mac Carney several times, returned the favor by swip
ing an end zone pass from Carney right before the
half ended.
But McNeil set the tone for the seond hall with his
incredible runs, the best of which was the 72-yarder.
The senior broke outside, blew past safety Steve
Lemon and shook off Rick Gervais' midfield tackle
before breezing in for the touchdown.
Sensing the momentum was slipping away from his
team, Stanford coach Paul Wiggin ordered a fake

punt on the ensuing drive. On tourth-and seven from
Stanford's 40, tullbac k |ini Brown took the short snap
and went up the middle, only to tall one yard short at
the 46. The Bruins took over and drove in tor the
go-ahead touchdown and the game, tor all intent,
was over.
"The guy just made a tackle and Ii ame up a halt
toot short," Brown said. "I roped outside and the
defender made the same decision. We just didn't get
enough yardage."
Wiggin detended the attempt, except tor the tact
that it did not work. "It was a strategy thing we had
surveyed three or tour times during the game. Of
course, we can do a helluva lot more with ( halk than
with bodies. It you ask me it I wish I hadn't made the
call, your're damn right, but it's all-or-nothing situa
tion."
All-or-nothing could also be applied to two other
plays which secured UCLA's nrst Pacitic-10 Confer
ence win. Atter Elway was roughed bv two Bruin de
tenders early in the tinal quarter, the Cards' drive
toward a tying touchdown was halted when halfback
Vincent White's option pass was short ot a wide open
Ken Margerum at the goal line. Mike Durden inter
cepted at the UCLA five.
Four plays later, UCLA disdained a punt on fourth
ancJ-one at the 14. Atter Ramsey called a time out to
make sure he had the correct play, the sophomore
quarterback snuck over center tor two yards. UCI A
continued the 95-yard march tor its final tout hdown,
ending with McNeil's last score, a 42-yarder on which
he was never touched.
Donahue was pragmatic in his explanation ot the
decision not to punt so deep in his own territory.
"Stanford would have scored it we kicked the ball
anyway so why ki Why not go tor 1 The defense
had been out there too long. They were too tired to
hold up the barrage. Also, I wanted the ottense to
know I had confidence in them."
It Donahue does not have confidence in hisoffenst
now, he never will. McNeil's own barrage provea
that.
