# 'Lobbyists' watch, worry, and work on government

The number of bills which cause
Stanford's th ree legislative advocates
to go into action has more than dou
bled in the past five years, according
to Bob Freelen, associate vice
president for public affairs.
Freelen works with Andrew Doty,
directorof community relations, and
Larry Horton, director of govern
ment relations, in examining upcom
ing state and federal legislation that
could provide opportunities, or
create problems, for the University.
Freelen and his two associates are
not "lobbyists" by the government's
definition of the word. "We aren't
registered as lobbyists because we
don't have that many hours of con
tact with legislators," explained
Freelen.
Budget struggles
At the moment, Freelen said, "We
are very concerned with the budget
process. There is a power struggle
between the appropriations commit
tees and the limits the budget com
mittees set."
As a result of that conflict, the re
cent Department of Energy budget
cut $1.5 billion out of the appropria
tions for research in high energy
physics.
"That would have cut funds for
SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center)," explained Freelen.
"Wolfgang Panofsky (director of
SLAC) and Horton flew out to
Washington and talked to lots of
people. And, fora variety of reasons,
the money was restored.
"I think it ended up around $2 mill
ion higher than the original budget,"
added Freelen.

Receiving money from many diffe
rent sources complicates the job ot
checking legislation, said Freelen.
Along with the Department of
Energy, Stanford also receives
money from the Defense Depart
ment to conduct basic research for
the Navy and the Air Force.
"The issue with the defense
budget is that of budget cuts versus
preparedness. Between the two,
money for basic research loses out,"
said Freelen.
Patent legislation
Patent legislation is anotherarea in
which Stanford has an interest. In
particular, legislation which would
allow universities and colleges to
own patents on its own discoveries
concerns Freelen.
A patent bill was passed in the Se
nate, but the differences between it
and the bill that came from the
House are so great "there's only a
remote chance that a compromise
will be worked out," said Freelen.
There is such a variety of issues
involved that Freelen, Horton and
Doty divide the legislation up among
themselves. Freelen scrutinizes bills
that would change existing tax laws,
while Horton specializes in bills af
fecting the University Medical
Center and Hospital, and Doty hand
les community interests, including
the issue of local land use.

"Stanford, as an institution, is very
dependent on philanthropy," said
Freelen. "Most people who give
large gifts plan to do so over several
years. Thus, when new rules are set
up for the IRS, the amount of dona
tions we receive will change."
