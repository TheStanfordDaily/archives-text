appointments by upsetting San

Playing their finest game, by

Soccer

Two key factors had to in
spire Stanford » performance
First, thix match \\a« certa ni\
the turning point of the season
tor the relativelv voung club
The game would be the
squad s opportunit\ to prove it
had learned from past defeats
and turn the momentum
around tor the final nine games
of the season. On the other
hand another crushing loss
could have plummeted the
Cards' confidence, already at
its nadir, to a lower level than
the nation's GNP.
Fortunately, it was the

former that occurred, and
Stanford will travel to USC and
UCLA with newcredibility after
knocking off one of the West
Coast's superior squads.
San lose State entered
Saturday's game following re
cent victories over USC and
Fresno State. The Spartans
looked as it they were on their
vvav to another convincing win
with a tally in the opening mo
ments of the contest. The Car
dinals finallv ad|usted to the
Spartans' style ot play and
evened the score on a penalty
kick b\ Willie Giucci.
Stanford took charge of mat
ters midway through the first
half and with approximately 15
minutes left, it was
Ciucci again who scored with
a left-tooted shot from 20 yards
out that skimmed the bar. San
lose regrouped, however, and
evened the scored at 2-2 with a
penalty kick of its own.
The score was tied at
halftime but the Cardinals had

to be pleased by the way they
rebounded trom their sloppy
opening moments of play to
control the action tor most ot
the first period.
Stanford proved that its
first-halt performance was no
fluke as the Cards took the lead,
3-2, on a Doug Clark goal.
Striker Ted Rafalovich con
nected on a beautiful corner
kick that |im VVitham, playing
sweeper, skimmed with his
head to Clark. The sophomore
forward completed the play
with a volley into the net.
Stanford, apparently follow
ing the exhortations ot coach
Nelson Lodge to "get some in

surance," proceeded to pad
the lead with another nice
combination play. Rafalovich
drove down the right wing and
hit a crossing shot to Ciucci.
The Cardinal striker headed it
to the goal but it was deflected,
lorge Titinger followed the de
flection into the net and Stan
ford seemed to have control ot
the game with a 4-2 lead.
San lose kept constant pres
sure on Stanford's goal and
narrowed the margin to 4-3
but the Cards withstood the
onslaught with surprising
poise. Goalie Jsff lones per
formed some difficult saves.
The contest's end saw San

lose, as Stanford had been
often times earlier this season,
thoroughly frustrated.
It was Stanford's second
straight victory over the Spar
tans, which doesn't seem so
extraordinary until you realize
that, until then, San lose State
had won 11 consecutive
games.
All the past frustrations of
this season had to be purged as
the team turned in an amazing
performance. And you know
the players were relishing the
feelings of joy their opponents
had experienced all too often
this season.
