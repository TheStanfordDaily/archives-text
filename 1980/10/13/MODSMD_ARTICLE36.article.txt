# Poloists open Pac-10 with two wins in LA

### 
With an improved array ot
substitutes as the catalyst,
Stanford's water polo team
swept both games ot its South
ern California trip this
weekend, defeating USC 10-7
Friday night and UCLA 9-3
Saturday morning.
Coach Dante Dettamanti
cited re ma r kab ly balanced
scoring — seven different
players scored in each game—
and an improved fast-break at
tack as two of the major factors
in Stanford's successes.
These strengths ultimately
stem from the contributions of
the Cardinal reserves. No
longer forced to rely on their
starters, the Cards have been
able to get fresher, bet'er ef
forts out of each player.

none ofthem played for Stan
lord last season: Mouchawar
sat out 1979 after transferring
from I.'CLA, Taylor redshirted
and Felix suffered a broken
hand.
"It we had had those guys
last year, we would have won
the NCAA ( hampionship," De
ttamanti stated flatly.
The Cards furthered their
quest tor this year's national
title with this weekend's pair of
victories. Against USC, Stan
ford jumped to a 2-0 first quar
ter lead.
USC c losed the gap to 3-2,
but Stanford shot out in front
6-3 on goals by Chris Kelsey,
Felix and Mouchawar. Goalie
John Gansel's 13 saves keyed a
staunch Card defense.
Showing the effects of facing
a fresh team after playing the
night before, the Cards fell be
hind 1-0 after one period
against UCLA. "We had a lot of
opportunities in the first quar
ter and made some poor pas
ses," Dettamanti said.
However, Stanford burst for
five goals in the second quarter
and four more in the third to
seal their triumph.
Mouchawar's three goals led
the scoring parade.
