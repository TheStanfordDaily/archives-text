## Innovation, funding keys to Law School 
### Gayle Mayers 
"Innovation," says Barbara Dray,
assistant dean of the Law School, "is
what makes Stanford Law School so
widely known and respected."
But innovative projects carry high
price tags, which means that Dray,
who took her position in July 1977,
bears the responsibility for finding
money for new endowed chairs and
professorships, curriculum changes
and scholarship funds.
Donations to the Law School have
more than doubled in the last three
years, from $1.25 million to over $3
million this year, said Dray.
How does Dray explain such an in
crease?
"One explanation is that we are a
very good school," she said. "You
don't have to be much of a salesman
— just get somebody's ear. We have
also made a terrific effort to inform
people and get the word out about
what we are doing."
Alumni network
In addition, Dray attributed part of
the increase to a "large network of
(alumni) volunteers' about 500
nationwide, out of a total of 4661
alumni.
Most of the fund raisers take pride
in their association with Stanford and
enjoy Stanford's ability to afford cur
riculum innovations by virtue of their
gifts, Dray said.
Historically the Law School has re
lied mostlyon thesealumni fordona
tions. Now it is increasingly turning
to foundations and corporations,
said Dray.
These groups are usually ap
proached to finance a targeted goal,
such as the new "Law in Business'
program for which the Carnegie
Foundation has made a grant.
Dray cited the "Law in Business'
program as a good example of the
Law School being able to respond to
the needs of the commercial world
through curriculum expansion.

"Increasingly people are begin
ning to focus on the combined needs
of business and law. The new profes
sorship which will be created within
the program will try to integrate the
business and law programs."
The project will cost a total of $4
million, of which the Law School cur
rently has raised $1 million.
Dray said business interest in re
cruiting Stanford Law graduates far
exceeds the supply of graduates. She
noted some of the corporations
hope that "having a close relation
ship with the Law School" will help
them when recruiting.
The Law School has also pioneered
a new form of clinical legal education
in which students research a com
pletecase studyand hold a mock trial
which is videotaped. This teaching

method is expensive — $7800 per
semester hour compared with $5000
per semester lecture hour — and do
nationsarecritical in maintaining this
program, Dray said.
Minority recruitment
Alumni donations provide much of
the scholarship money which is vital
to attract a diverse student body.
Dray said the Law School identifies
top minority students across the na
tion and actively tries to recruit them.
To be successful, Stanford must at
least match the scholarships offered
by major East Coast law schools, she
said.
Dray identified a lack of scholars
and researchers as a weakness in the
Law School. She said that because of
too few professors, positions often
have to be filled by visiting lawyers

on sabbatical from their law prac
tices.
Livening up alumni weekends and
class reunions have helped stimulate
alumni donations but an increasing
factor in giving has been "matching
gifts," said Dray.
She explained that some of the top
law firms will match donations by
alumni partners and others are be
ginning to pledge a per capita
amount for every Stanford alumnus
which the firm employs.
The minimum cost of establishing
an endowed chair is currently $1 mill
ion. Dray explained that the Law
School only receives 3n income of
about 4Vi percent per annum from
such an endowment which is not a
great deal for maintaining a profes
sor and his or her secretary.

proached to finance a targeted goal,
such as the new "Law in Business'
program for which the Carnegie
Foundation has made a grant.
Dray cited the "Law in Business'
program as a good example of the
Law School being able to respond to
the needs of the commercial world
through curriculum expansion.

"Increasingly people are begin
ning to focus on the combined needs
of business and law. The new profes
sorship which will be created within
the program will try to integrate the
business and law programs."
The project will cost a total of $4
million, of which the Law School cur
rently has raised $1 million.
Dray said business interest in re
cruiting Stanford Law graduates far
exceeds the supply of graduates. She
noted some of the corporations
hope that "having a close relation
ship with the Law School" will help
them when recruiting.
The Law School has also pioneered
a new form of clinical legal education
in which students research a com
pletecase studyand hold a mock trial
which is videotaped. This teaching

method is expensive — $7800 per
semester hour compared with $5000
per semester lecture hour — and do
nationsarecritical in maintaining this
program, Dray said.
Minority recruitment
Alumni donations provide much of
the scholarship money which is vital
to attract a diverse student body.
Dray said the Law School identifies
top minority students across the na
tion and actively tries to recruit them.
To be successful, Stanford must at
least match the scholarships offered
by major East Coast law schools, she
said.
Dray identified a lack of scholars
and researchers as a weakness in the
Law School. She said that because of
too few professors, positions often
have to be filled by visiting lawyers

on sabbatical from their law prac
tices.
Livening up alumni weekends and
class reunions have helped stimulate
alumni donations but an increasing
factor in giving has been "matching
gifts," said Dray.
She explained that some of the top
law firms will match donations by
alumni partners and others are be
ginning to pledge a per capita
amount for every Stanford alumnus
which the firm employs.
The minimum cost of establishing
an endowed chair is currently $1 mill
ion. Dray explained that the Law
School only receives 3n income of
about 4Vi percent per annum from
such an endowment which is not a
great deal for maintaining a profes
sor and his or her secretary.
"Innovation," says Barbara Dray,
assistant dean of the Law School, "is
what makes Stanford Law School so
widely known and respected."
But innovative projects carry high
price tags, which means that Dray,
who took her position in July 1977,
bears the responsibility for finding
money for new endowed chairs and
professorships, curriculum changes
and scholarship funds.
Donations to the Law School have
more than doubled in the last three
years, from $1.25 million to over $3
million this year, said Dray.
How does Dray explain such an in
crease?
"One explanation is that we are a
very good school," she said. "You
don't have to be much of a salesman
— just get somebody's ear. We have
also made a terrific effort to inform
people and get the word out about
what we are doing."
Alumni network
In addition, Dray attributed part of
the increase to a "large network of
(alumni) volunteers' about 500
nationwide, out of a total of 4661
alumni.
Most of the fund raisers take pride
in their association with Stanford and
enjoy Stanford's ability to afford cur
riculum innovations by virtue of their
gifts, Dray said.
Historically the Law School has re
lied mostlyon thesealumni fordona
tions. Now it is increasingly turning
to foundations and corporations,
said Dray.
These groups are usually ap
proached to finance a targeted goal,
such as the new "Law in Business'
program for which the Carnegie
Foundation has made a grant.
Dray cited the "Law in Business'
program as a good example of the
Law School being able to respond to
