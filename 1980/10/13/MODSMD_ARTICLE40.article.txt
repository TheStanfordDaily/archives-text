Fighting rages in Iranian port
Khorramshahr, Occupied Iran — Artillery duels
and intense close-in fighting between Iraqi and
Iranian troops raged yesterday in this battered
port city, despite the Iraqi army command s claim
that it has broken Khorramshahr's defenses and
stands poised to capture the oil refinery city ot
Abadan.
Iranian army regulars and revolutionary guards
apparently had yielded a strategically important
crossing of Iraqi troops over the Karun Ri\er. a
tributary ot the Shatt-al-Arab River, but the defen
ders forced the Iraqis into skirting the Iranian
strongpoints and establishing a front tar inland ot
the Shatt-al-Arab and away from the main supply
road to the dock area.
The Iraqi army's purpose in crossing the river
behind the Iranian forces appeared to be to encir
cle the pocket oi defenders while at the same time
reaching the Abadan roa,d tor a direct assault on
the oil retinery city to the south.
In an exclusive telephone interview with The
Associated Press, Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr said Iran would only consider negotia
tions for a cease-tire after Iraq withdrew its forces
and pledged not to interfere in Iran's affairs.
Bani-Sadr, who has visited the front several
times since the war began three weeks ago and
meets with the military officials, dismissed Iraqi
claims of capturing the port city of Khorramshahr
and crossing the strategic Karun River in southern
Iran as "a lie."
However, despite the Iranian resistance within
the city, which has settled into bitter house-to
house fighting, there were signs that the Iraqi
forces had made enormous gains in the past week.
AP correspondent Steve Hindy reported from an
Iraqi-held section of Khorramshahr, that the Iraqi
drive on that city had apparently settled into a
siege and that Iraqi artillery were pounding the
town and shelling Abadan farther south.
In addition to its huge refinery, Abadan is a
major Iranian stronghold on the eastern bank of
the Shatt-al-Arab, about 10 miles south of the oil
port city of Khorramshahr. Iraqi forces used a pon
toon bridge to put Soviet-built T-62 tanks across

the river north of Khorramshahr two days ago
under a screen ot bombing and strafing
warplanes.
In a new diplomatic development, Jordan said
that King Hussein's visit to Saudi Arabia had re
sulted in "full understanding' that Saudi Arabia
would |Oin jordan in supporting the territorial
rights Iraq seeks in the war.
Pope lauds sexual 'self-control'
Vatican City — Pope |ohn Paul II celebrated a
special Mass tor all the world s families yesterday
and praised couples who practice sexual "self
control."
"In the midst ot so many voices in our permis
sive society that exalt (so<alled ) sexual liberty as a
part ot human fulfillment, it's right tor those to
raise their voices who, in their day-to-day experi
ence ot a serene arid generous self-control, have
been able to discover a new source of reciprocal
acquaintance, deeper understanding and authen
tic liberty," the 60-year-old pontiff said.
Earlier, at an outdoor Mass, the pope em
phasized the religious side of love and marriage
after drawing criticism tor saying four days ago that
a man should not feel excessive sexual desire even
for his wife.
"Love, which unites man and woman as spouses
and parents, is, at the same time, a gift and an
order" from Cod, the Polish-born pontiff said in a
homily. He said that people should love Cod
"above all things," or else "man's love will detach
itself from the deepest root."
More than 75,000 onlookers, including 8000
married couples who traveled here from 36 coun
tries, huddled under umbrellas in a drizzling rain
in St. Peter's Square for the"Day of the Family."
Columbus' Pinta may be found
Key West, Fla. — Treasure hunters say the Pinta,
one of three ships that sailed with Cristopher Col
umbus in 1492, later returned to the New World,
and they believe they've found her wreckage off
the Turks and Caicos islands in the Bahamas.
Olin Frick, John Casque and a crew of 23 divers

and archeologists say they plan to return to the site
next month to retrieve artifacts from a coral
covered wreck they believe is the Pinta.
Using records in the Spanish archives and a
500-vear-old tax report, Florida historian Eugene
Lyon has concluded that one of the Pinta s owners,
Vincente Pin/on, made a return trip to the New
World about 1499 or 1500.
An iron cannon and a lead cannon ball from the
wreck, which Fric k and Gasque tound three years
ago, have been determined to date trom that
period.
Lyon says Pinzon island-hopped for six months
in search of slaves and riches before a hurricane
sank two of his four vessels.
Mendel Peterson, former director of underwa
ter archeology for the Smithsonian Institution and
now a shipwreck artifact appraiser, says he's
"found nothing which would contradict" the trea
sure hunters' claim that their wreck is the Pinta.
Armenians bomb Turkish targets
An Armenian anti-Turkish group claimed re
sponsibility yesterday for explosions in New York
and Los Angeles, and in Lngland a similar group
claimed responsibility for two blasts in London.
At least five people were injured in New York
when a car exploded in front of the Turkish Mis
sion to the United Nations, police said. And a
powerful explosion at a vacant Los Angeles store
shattered windows in several buildings and sent
glass flying through a busy intersection, injuring at
least one person.
No injuries were reported in London, where
bombs exploded at the Turkish Airlines building
and at the Swiss Center, a restaurant and shopping
complex a half-mile away in London's crowded
West End theater district.
In Los Angeles at least one person was injured
when a powerful bomb exploded inside a Hol
lywood travel agency owned by a Turkish immig
rant, spraying shards of glass across a normally
crowded intersection and damaging several
nearby buildings.
Minutes atter the Los Angeles blast, an uniden
tified man called the news media and claimed the
"Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide"
was responsible for the New York and Los Angeles
attacks, both of which occurred just after 5 p.m.
The caller said the bombings were "in retaliation
for the slaughter of Armenian people by the Turks
and for the harassment of Armenians by Turkish
people in America."
Expert sees dip in oil prices
Los Angeles — A leading oil industry analyst says
results of a new survey show a steady decline in
gasoline prices nationwide — an indication that
American consumers are having a bigger impact
than the Iraq-Iran war on the U.S. energy situa
tion.
"I'm a little bit stunned," Dan Lundberg, pub
lisher of the weekly Lundberg Letter, said Sunday
after looking at a computer readout of the
Lundberg Survey completed last week.
He said the new survey shows a decline in gas
prices over the past month in each of the 26 cities
analyzed — the first time that's happened since
the survey began in 1955.
