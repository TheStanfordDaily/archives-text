to Guillo Nodarse, student co-director of
SCIRE.
Nodarse said interaction among agency rep
resentatives for the purpose of learning about
each others' programs was another goal of the

Approximately 400 internships and research
opportunities are currently available through
SC'RE, according to |udy Adams, professional
co-director of the organization. Opportunities

are available in 25 fields, from economics to
biological sciences to energy.
The fair was held a week before the Oct. 17
deadline for autumn internship applications in
order to give interested students time to ar
range academic credit for their work.
SCIRE's other activities include helping stu
dents arrange to earn academic credit teaching
SWOPSI and undergraduate special courses,
and setting up task forces to investigate and
evaluate aspects of the Stanford experience
such as the advising associate program.

of an annual $4000 Innovation Fund for student
organizations and projects.
Nodarse said there will be another fieldwork
fair early in the winter or spring quarters.

and other reference materials are available in
