## Speakers outline Britain's policies 
### Marc Jefferson 
The second in a series of 21 sym
posia entitled "A World in Crisis" fo
cused last Wednesday on the ques
tion "Can Britain survive?"
The symposium was led by
Roderick Floud of the University of
London, Alfred Collin of UC-Santa
Barbara and Donald Stokes and Peter
Stansky of Stanford.
Floud, an economic historian, dis
cussed the problems of the British
economy. The main question he at
tacked was whether or not Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's con
servative economic policies repre
sent a break with the past.
Floud stated the British economy
has gotten worse, not better, since
I hatcher's conservative government
came into power 17 months ago. He

charged tight controls on the money
supply have driven up interest rates
and have stifled investment.
Floud said if the conservatives do
not moderate its economic policies,
they will risk losing power.
Donald Stokes, a writer for the
University's news service, addressed
issues of foreign affairs. The British,
he said, have very strong views on
foreign policy. He cited two exam
ples at the symposium: a belief in the
importance of aiding the Third
World, and a belief in strong de
fense.
British foreign aid has not drop
ped, reflecting a commitment to a
more balanced world, said Stokes.
The army, though not large, is very
technically advanced and efficient.
Alfred Collin spoke on British in
volvement in the Common Market.

Britain, he said, joined the European
Economic Community because they
were looking for assured markets.
However, the country still does
not know whether it is part of
Europe, or a separate entity. The
Labour party still wants to pull out of
the Common Market, said Gollin.
The last speaker was History Prof.
Peter Stansky. He spoke on the prob
lems of dissent within the vestiges of
the British Empire and within Eng
land itself.
The Home Rule debate going on in
Wales, Scotland and Northern Ire
land is still very alive, said Stansky,
despite the lack of coverage in the
U.S.
The series of symposia are part of
the Freshman and Sophomore Semi
nar programs, and are co-sponsored
by Foothill Community College.
