## Gulf war threatens Camp David peace negotiations 
### Washington Post 
Washington — King Hussein's enthusiastic
support of Iraq in the Persian Cult war has dis
tanced Jordan tarther than ever from the stalled
efforts by Israel, Egypt and the United States to
negotiate Palestinian autonomy on the West
Bank.
The monarch's rush to back President Saddam
Hussein's Baathist regime "tlows in part from
gratitude for substantial Iraqi aid. But more im
portantly, Middle Eastern diplomats say, it is the
logical outgrowth of a longstanding policy
aimed at organizing a common Arab stand
against the U.S.-led Camp David peace formula.
This drive, emphasized by the king in recent
interviews, also fits into a deep-telt sense of
Arab loyalty and a need to retain the favor ot as
many fellow Arab rulers as possible as a protec
tion against any temptation to turn into reality
the Israeli assertion that Palestinians do not re
quire the West Bank because they already have a
state in Jordan.
King Hussein repeatedly has insisted that he
will never join the Camp David autonomy talks
under their present tormat and that Palestinians
there must choose their own rulers, lordanian
diplomats here recalled Thursday. But Israeli
opposition leaders and some segments of the
U.S. foreign policy establishment have clung to
hope that, under a more flexible Labor govern
ment, Israel could work out a deal returning
Jordanian sovereignty over most of the West
Bank in exchange for territory judged necessary
for Israeli security.
In the light of Jordan's increasingly close ties
to Iraq, however, this hope seems more remote.
Saddam Hussein has made Iraq one of Israel's
most virulent foes and, along with Libya, the
most inflexible on suggestions of a negotiated
peace of any kind between the Jewish state and
its Arab neighbors.
King Hussein is thought unlikely to espouse
this radical Baathist outlook — indeed, re
volutionary Baathist ideology opposes the idea
of monarchy, and it was King Hussein's distant
cousin, Faisal 11, who once ran the Iraqi govern
ment.

But nevertheless the association with Saddam
Hussein, it it lasts, is expected to make the Jor
danian monarch less receptive to urgirigs trom
the United States that he continue "moderate"
policies toward Israel and keep an open mind on
the possibility ot joining the Camp David talks or
whatever follows them.
"Certainly, it is a step in the direction ot a
harder-line policy," an Israeli diplomat com
mented. "You cannot align yourselt with Iraq
and remain a moderate as far as Israel is con
cerned."
Israel has expressed dismay to the United
States over lordan's increasing role in the
Iranian-Iraqi war, pointing to reports that king
Hussein has welcomed Iraqi wounded to Jorda
nian hospitals, offered lordanian air bases as a
haven tor Iraqi warplanes and opened Aqaba
port on the Red Sea to the transport ot supplies
for the Iraqi war effort.
lordan and the United States traditionally
have been close allies. But U.S. ability to influ
ence King Hussein has declined sharply in the
two years since the Camp David accords were
signed with a presumed role for Jordan, but
without any assurances that Jordan was willing
to play it. King Hussein's pique at not being
consulted and official irritation in Washington
when he bluntly turned down his part com
pounded the chill.
Israeli concern stems from general fears that
an Iraqi victory over Iran would give it a stronger
voice in Arab councils, pulling such moderates
as lordan and Saudi Arabia toward less-flexible
policies. In addition, an Israeli diplomat said,
closer Jordanian-Iraqi ties raise the possibility ot
Iraqi troops being stationed in neighboring lor
dan or perhaps even an Iranian attack on Jorda
nian targets near the frontier with Israeli
occupied territory.
In any case, prospects for the autonomy talks
due to resume here tomorrow — never very
bright — were dimmed to near black by the
Persian Gulf hostilities. The U.S. negotiator, Sol
Linowitz, has said he believes that the
negotiators can break the deadlock on a number
of disputed points.

In the light of Jordan's increasingly close ties
to Iraq, however, this hope seems more remote.
Saddam Hussein has made Iraq one of Israel's
most virulent foes and, along with Libya, the
most inflexible on suggestions of a negotiated
peace of any kind between the Jewish state and
its Arab neighbors.
King Hussein is thought unlikely to espouse
this radical Baathist outlook — indeed, re
volutionary Baathist ideology opposes the idea
of monarchy, and it was King Hussein's distant
cousin, Faisal 11, who once ran the Iraqi govern
ment.

But nevertheless the association with Saddam
Hussein, it it lasts, is expected to make the Jor
danian monarch less receptive to urgirigs trom
the United States that he continue "moderate"
policies toward Israel and keep an open mind on
the possibility ot joining the Camp David talks or
whatever follows them.
"Certainly, it is a step in the direction ot a
harder-line policy," an Israeli diplomat com
mented. "You cannot align yourselt with Iraq
and remain a moderate as far as Israel is con
cerned."
Israel has expressed dismay to the United
States over lordan's increasing role in the
Iranian-Iraqi war, pointing to reports that king
Hussein has welcomed Iraqi wounded to Jorda
nian hospitals, offered lordanian air bases as a
haven tor Iraqi warplanes and opened Aqaba
port on the Red Sea to the transport ot supplies
for the Iraqi war effort.
lordan and the United States traditionally
have been close allies. But U.S. ability to influ
ence King Hussein has declined sharply in the
two years since the Camp David accords were
signed with a presumed role for Jordan, but
without any assurances that Jordan was willing
to play it. King Hussein's pique at not being
consulted and official irritation in Washington
when he bluntly turned down his part com
pounded the chill.
Israeli concern stems from general fears that
an Iraqi victory over Iran would give it a stronger
voice in Arab councils, pulling such moderates
as lordan and Saudi Arabia toward less-flexible
policies. In addition, an Israeli diplomat said,
closer Jordanian-Iraqi ties raise the possibility ot
Iraqi troops being stationed in neighboring lor
dan or perhaps even an Iranian attack on Jorda
nian targets near the frontier with Israeli
occupied territory.
In any case, prospects for the autonomy talks
due to resume here tomorrow — never very
bright — were dimmed to near black by the
Persian Gulf hostilities. The U.S. negotiator, Sol
Linowitz, has said he believes that the
negotiators can break the deadlock on a number
of disputed points.
Washington — King Hussein's enthusiastic
support of Iraq in the Persian Cult war has dis
tanced Jordan tarther than ever from the stalled
efforts by Israel, Egypt and the United States to
negotiate Palestinian autonomy on the West
Bank.
The monarch's rush to back President Saddam
Hussein's Baathist regime "tlows in part from
gratitude for substantial Iraqi aid. But more im
portantly, Middle Eastern diplomats say, it is the
logical outgrowth of a longstanding policy
aimed at organizing a common Arab stand
against the U.S.-led Camp David peace formula.
This drive, emphasized by the king in recent
interviews, also fits into a deep-telt sense of
Arab loyalty and a need to retain the favor ot as
many fellow Arab rulers as possible as a protec
tion against any temptation to turn into reality
the Israeli assertion that Palestinians do not re
quire the West Bank because they already have a
state in Jordan.
King Hussein repeatedly has insisted that he
will never join the Camp David autonomy talks
under their present tormat and that Palestinians
there must choose their own rulers, lordanian
diplomats here recalled Thursday. But Israeli
opposition leaders and some segments of the
U.S. foreign policy establishment have clung to
hope that, under a more flexible Labor govern
ment, Israel could work out a deal returning
Jordanian sovereignty over most of the West
Bank in exchange for territory judged necessary
for Israeli security.
In the light of Jordan's increasingly close ties
to Iraq, however, this hope seems more remote.
