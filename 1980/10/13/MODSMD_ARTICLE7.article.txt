# Japan expands trade to N. Korea
## 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo — Powerful Japanese
business interests are moving
toward an era of expanded
trade with North Korea in what
may be the beginning of a new
open-door policy toward that
long-closed communist na
tion.
Some of Japan's most prom
inent industrialists and ban
kers have put together a new
trade research organization
that hopes to tap North Korea's

rich mineral resources and en
large substantially the two-way
trade with the Asian neighbor.
Its formation is one sign of a
growing Japanese interest in
creating closer ties with North
Korea, a country considered
out of bounds until recently
because of Japan's friendly re
lations with South Korea.
The move by leading
businessmen and a recent visit
to Pyongyang by conservative
members of the Japanese par
liament have alarmed and irri
tated South Korea, which re
gards any friendly country's in
terest in the communist enemy
as a stab in the back. There
have been hints that South
Korea might retaliate against
Japanese firms that deal with
the north by boycotts.
The key to the new trade
overtures is the prominence of
the businessmen who have
formed the vaguely named
"East Asian Trade Research
Board" here.
Executives of Japan's six
major trading companies, a
television network, and several
banks, as well as members of
parliament, are on the board of
the new organization. All are
influential in the business
community and many have im
portant ties with the govern
ment.
Avoid publicity
Its members have avoided
publicity, for the reason that it

would attract antipathy from
South Korea, but a general out
line of its purpose was pro
vided during interviews in bus
iness circles here.
The board is said to believe
that North Korea is abandoning
its do-it-yourself style of
economic modernization and
is preparing to seek more assis
tance and trade opportunities
with the outside world. The
government of North Korean
President Kim II Sung would
like to minimize economic ties
with the Soviet Union because
of the political conditions that
come with them and will turn
more and more to non
communist countries.
Japan should be prepared to
take advantage of such an
opening, these sources con
tend, particularly now that
North Korea has partially reco
vered from the recession of the
mid-1970s and is starting to pay
off its foreign trade debts.
The organization does not
want to destroy business rela
tions with South Korea, the
source added, "but we cannot
deny that we want to build a
bridge between Japan and
North Korea."
Until now, trade between
North Korea and Japan has
been a trickle, managed by a
number of smaller companies
on an unofficial basis through
dummy trading organizations.
Some businessmen and a

member ot parliament who vis
ited Pyongyang, Katsushi Fujii,
have pressed for a more formal
normalization of trade through
a memorandum agreement
that would be signed by the
North Korean government and
a consortium of Japanese
companies.
South Korea has already sig
nalled its displeasure with the
proposed trading arrange
ments. Its embassy here has at
tempted to find out what the
"research board" is up to and
has warned that any kind of
trade with North Korea would
increase the communist coun
try's military power.
South Korean threats
News dispatches from Seoul
recently reportedly that the
South Korean government will
urge companies to stop deal
ing with Japanese companies
that trade with North Korea.
However, that would be a
largely empty threat if made
against companies of the size
and importance that now are
considering trading with the
north.

terested in supplying quan
tities of manufactured goods to
North Korea, as it does to many
other developing countries.
But one of the major goals ap
pears to be in tapping the large
quantities of mineral resources
known to be found in the
north.

Until now, trade between
North Korea and Japan has
been a trickle, managed by a
number of smaller companies
on an unofficial basis through
dummy trading organizations.
Some businessmen and a

South Korean threats

recently reportedly that the
South Korean government will
urge companies to stop deal

that trade with North Korea.
However, that would be a
largely empty threat if made
against companies of the size
and importance that now are
considering trading with the
north.

dec ided to expand its trade with North Korea, possibly injuring its
relations with the South Korean government.
Tokyo — Powerful Japanese
business interests are moving
toward an era of expanded
trade with North Korea in what
may be the beginning of a new
open-door policy toward that
long-closed communist na
tion.
Some of Japan's most prom
inent industrialists and ban
kers have put together a new
trade research organization
that hopes to tap North Korea's

rich mineral resources and en
large substantially the two-way
trade with the Asian neighbor.
Its formation is one sign of a
growing Japanese interest in
creating closer ties with North
Korea, a country considered
out of bounds until recently
because of Japan's friendly re
lations with South Korea.
The move by leading
businessmen and a recent visit
to Pyongyang by conservative
members of the Japanese par
liament have alarmed and irri
tated South Korea, which re
gards any friendly country's in
terest in the communist enemy
as a stab in the back. There
have been hints that South
Korea might retaliate against
Japanese firms that deal with
the north by boycotts.
The key to the new trade
overtures is the prominence of
the businessmen who have
formed the vaguely named
"East Asian Trade Research
Board" here.
Executives of Japan's six
major trading companies, a
television network, and several
banks, as well as members of
parliament, are on the board of
the new organization. All are
influential in the business
community and many have im
portant ties with the govern
ment.
Avoid publicity
Its members have avoided
publicity, for the reason that it

would attract antipathy from
South Korea, but a general out
line of its purpose was pro
vided during interviews in bus
iness circles here.
The board is said to believe
that North Korea is abandoning
its do-it-yourself style of
economic modernization and
is preparing to seek more assis
tance and trade opportunities
with the outside world. The
government of North Korean
President Kim II Sung would
like to minimize economic ties
with the Soviet Union because
of the political conditions that
come with them and will turn
more and more to non
communist countries.
Japan should be prepared to
take advantage of such an
opening, these sources con
tend, particularly now that
