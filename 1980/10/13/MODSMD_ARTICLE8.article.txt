# Australia reviews alliance with U.S.
## 
### Washington Post 
Canberra, Australia — For the second
time in eight years, Australia's alliance
with the United States — unquestioned
over the previous three decades — has
become a central issue in a national elec
tion here.
When they go to the polls on Oct. 18,
Australian voters will, to a large extent, be
registering their judgment on this coun
try's relationship with its long-time ally.
The last time the issue came before the
voters, in 1972, charismatic leader Cough
Whitlam took his leftist Labor Party into
power on a platform which included with
drawal of Australian support for the
American fight in Vietnam and demands
for greater control over American military
bases and business enterprises here.
The Whitlam government was thrown
out in November 1975 by the governor
general, Sir John Kerr, after a constitu
tional crisis triggered by the refusal of the

conservative-controlled Senate to ap
prove appropriations for the Whitlam
government.
Conservative Malcolm Fraser was ap
pointed prime minister. His selection was
legitimized in vigorously democratic Au
stralia by landslide election victories in
December 1975 and December 1977.
Fraser soon got rid of the controversial
Kerr and Whitlam stepped out of politics
after his drubbing in 1977, handing over
the reigns of the Labor Party to a former
Queensland police officerwho had briefly
been treasurer in Whitlam's Cabinet, Wil
liam George Hayden.
American capital was lured back after a
virtual moratorium during the Whitlam
years, and American companies began to
involve themselves in development of the
huge coal, uranium and bauxite resources
that promise to make Australia a boom
country through the 1980s.
Suddenly, last weekend, the coalition of

conservative urban and rural parties sup
porting the over-contident Fraser found
their leader was in deep trouble. Three
separate opinion polls showed Labor well
ahead — one by a margin of 15 percent —
even though most voters who said they
would vote Labor still thought that Fraser
would win.
Ever since the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan, Fraser had been tolling the
warning bell of the Soviet threat to Au
stralia— a lifelong passion of Fraser — and
had been moving to link the United States
more firmly into defense agreements with
Australia.
Apparently hopelessly behind on
domestic issues, the prime minister has
switched his tack to foreign policy and de
fense — and has focused the issue directly
on the American alliance.
He has already offered the use of Austra
lian air bases to American B-52 bombers on
training missions and on surveillance
flights over the Indian Ocean.
