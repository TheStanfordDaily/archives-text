# Stanford inaugurates a president in regal ceremony seen by 6000
## 
### Cici Oremland 
With royal pomp and gala circumstance,
Donald Kennedy was officially inaugu
rated as president of Stanford University
yesterday in Frost Amphitheater. Even the
early morning clouds had to give way to
allow sunny skies to reign over the event.
Not since the inaugural ceremony of
former President Kenneth Pitzer in 1967
has the University community seen such a
regal inaugural spectacle. Nearly 6000 stu
dents, faculty, staff and invited guests vie
wed the ceremony.
Because of campus unrest in the 19605,
former President Richard Lyman, who fol
lowed Pitzer, had no such formal inaugu
ration. Lyman left the University this year
to become president of the Rockefeller
Foundation.
Distinguished procession
Four baroque trumpeteers led the color
ful procession that included the faculty
and the deans of the schools, University
officers past and present, the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents, the BoardofTrustees, the
President Emeritus (Lyman), the Chancel
lor (former President J.E. Wallace Sterling)
and Kennedy.
The faculty and deans were led by flag
bearers whose flags displayed both the
academic symbols of the various schools
and the Stanford redwood's triple frond,
symbolizing the organization, transmis
sion and generation of knowledge.
The flag bearers were students from the
Human Biology Department, which
reached its current status and popularity
with Kennedy's guidance during the mid
dle years of the 19705.
A family party
In his welcoming remarks, Sterling re
ferred to the inauguration as a "Stanford
family party."
Dr. Peter Bing, president of the Board of
Trustees, discussed the philosophical as

pects of the Stanford education in his in
vestiture speech. "We'll not shrink from
experimenting for fear of failure," he said.
He referred to the University motto,
"Die Luft Der Freiheit Weht," which
means, "Let the winds of freedom blow."
"The winds of these hills always blow
. . . maybe these are the winds of free
dom," Bing said.
Bing concluded his address by present
ing Kennedy with the new presidential
cardinal red and white silk robe.
University's early goals
After much audience applause, Ken
nedy began his speech with an anecdote
from the musical Funny Girl in which
Fanny Brice said, "The groom was prettier
than the bride."
Kennedy went on to discuss the current
academic situation here. Delving into the
history of the University, Kennedy spoke
of the early commitment to both the sci
ences and the humanities.
"A strong early attachment to the
natural and the practical sciences was
blended with the traditional respect for
the classical disciplines of the liberal arts,"
he said.
He emphasized his goal of restrengthen
ing the liberal arts departments that have
not in the past received the same monies
for research as the sciences. Kennedy an
nounced a new $1.25 million gift from the
Andrew Mellon Foundation to aid in this
effort.
He also announced the appointment of
English Prof. Lan Watt as the first director
of the new Stanford Humanities Center.
"I want to urge my faculty colleagues
directly that it is time to assert that these
activities (academic advising and attention
to the individual needs of students) mat
ter, for the same reasons that classroom
teaching and other, more traditional ele
ments of academic responsibility matter,"

he added.
Primacy of academics
Kennedy promised to continue in the
tradition set by Sterling and Lyman of ac
tive presidential leadership.
"Stanford's Western legacy of friendly
pragmatism makes us a community in
which performance is valued along with
analysis. Our Eastern inheritance reminds
us of our need to reassert the primacy of
intellectual accomplishment," he said.
Several students commented on Ken
nedy's speech. Laura Mead, former
member of the Council of Presidents, said,
"I think he's hit a lot of things on the head.
They were problems we discussed on the
(presidential) search committee."
She also added she was glad Kennedy
focused his address on the students. "He
talked to the students the whole time,"
she said.
Hopes for new era
"I've never had the impression that this
place existed forthe students," said senior
Risa Forister. "I hope this (presidency) be
gins a new era of cooperation among the
faculty, staff and the students."
Faculty members praised the sensitivity
of both Bing's and Kennedy's speeches.
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student af
fairs, said she found the speeches "sensi
tive and inspiring."
The inauguration was followed by a re
ception in the Quad for all guests. Among
the gaily painted University schools'crests
and baskets of red and white flowers, well
wishers ate celebration cake and drank
punch while conversing privately or wait
ing in the long line to congratulate the new
president and his wife.
Inauguration ceremonies continue this
week and include a faculty ball tonight.
Though costs for the inauguration have
not been released, University sources
confirmed that they are about $70,000.

After much audience applause, Ken
nedy began his speech with an anecdote
from the musical Funny Girl in which
Fanny Brice said, "The groom was prettier
than the bride."
Kennedy went on to discuss the current
academic situation here. Delving into the
history of the University, Kennedy spoke
of the early commitment to both the sci
ences and the humanities.
"A strong early attachment to the
natural and the practical sciences was
blended with the traditional respect for
the classical disciplines of the liberal arts,"
he said.
He emphasized his goal of restrengthen
ing the liberal arts departments that have
not in the past received the same monies
for research as the sciences. Kennedy an
nounced a new $1.25 million gift from the
Andrew Mellon Foundation to aid in this
effort.
He also announced the appointment of
English Prof. Lan Watt as the first director
of the new Stanford Humanities Center.
"I want to urge my faculty colleagues
directly that it is time to assert that these
activities (academic advising and attention
to the individual needs of students) mat
ter, for the same reasons that classroom
teaching and other, more traditional ele
ments of academic responsibility matter,"

he added.
Primacy of academics
Kennedy promised to continue in the
tradition set by Sterling and Lyman of ac
tive presidential leadership.
"Stanford's Western legacy of friendly
pragmatism makes us a community in
which performance is valued along with
analysis. Our Eastern inheritance reminds
us of our need to reassert the primacy of
intellectual accomplishment," he said.
Several students commented on Ken
nedy's speech. Laura Mead, former
member of the Council of Presidents, said,
"I think he's hit a lot of things on the head.
They were problems we discussed on the
(presidential) search committee."
She also added she was glad Kennedy
focused his address on the students. "He
talked to the students the whole time,"
she said.
Hopes for new era
"I've never had the impression that this
place existed forthe students," said senior
Risa Forister. "I hope this (presidency) be
gins a new era of cooperation among the
faculty, staff and the students."
Faculty members praised the sensitivity
of both Bing's and Kennedy's speeches.
Leah Kaplan, assistant dean of student af
fairs, said she found the speeches "sensi
tive and inspiring."
The inauguration was followed by a re
ception in the Quad for all guests. Among
the gaily painted University schools'crests
and baskets of red and white flowers, well
wishers ate celebration cake and drank
punch while conversing privately or wait
ing in the long line to congratulate the new
president and his wife.
Inauguration ceremonies continue this
week and include a faculty ball tonight.
Though costs for the inauguration have
not been released, University sources
confirmed that they are about $70,000.

With royal pomp and gala circumstance,
Donald Kennedy was officially inaugu
rated as president of Stanford University
yesterday in Frost Amphitheater. Even the
early morning clouds had to give way to
allow sunny skies to reign over the event.
Not since the inaugural ceremony of
former President Kenneth Pitzer in 1967
has the University community seen such a
regal inaugural spectacle. Nearly 6000 stu
dents, faculty, staff and invited guests vie
wed the ceremony.
Because of campus unrest in the 19605,
former President Richard Lyman, who fol
lowed Pitzer, had no such formal inaugu
ration. Lyman left the University this year
to become president of the Rockefeller
Foundation.
Distinguished procession
Four baroque trumpeteers led the color
ful procession that included the faculty
and the deans of the schools, University
officers past and present, the ASSU Coun
cil of Presidents, the BoardofTrustees, the
President Emeritus (Lyman), the Chancel
lor (former President J.E. Wallace Sterling)
and Kennedy.
The faculty and deans were led by flag
bearers whose flags displayed both the
academic symbols of the various schools
and the Stanford redwood's triple frond,
symbolizing the organization, transmis
sion and generation of knowledge.
The flag bearers were students from the
Human Biology Department, which
reached its current status and popularity
with Kennedy's guidance during the mid
dle years of the 19705.
A family party
In his welcoming remarks, Sterling re
ferred to the inauguration as a "Stanford
family party."
Dr. Peter Bing, president of the Board of
Trustees, discussed the philosophical as

pects of the Stanford education in his in
vestiture speech. "We'll not shrink from
experimenting for fear of failure," he said.
He referred to the University motto,
"Die Luft Der Freiheit Weht," which
means, "Let the winds of freedom blow."
"The winds of these hills always blow
. . . maybe these are the winds of free
dom," Bing said.
Bing concluded his address by present
ing Kennedy with the new presidential
cardinal red and white silk robe.
