# University plans to stay out of draft-resister prosecutions

University officials will not take
any action or position against stu
dents here who may come under in
vestigation for draft registration vio
lations, according to Jennifer Wes
terlind of the University's legal of
fice.
"It is not our (the University's) bus
iness whether young men register
for the draft or not,'' Westerlind said.
Westerlind's comments came in
response to recently stated Selective
Service plans to refer the names of
draft registration violators to the jus
tice Department by the end of
November for possible prosecution.
Currently, Selective Service offi
cials estimate 6 percent of all eligible
registrants, or about 280,000 men,
have not complied with the draft re
gistration laws enacted earlier this
year.
Westerlind said personal informa
tion listed in the student directory is
legally available to the public, but
students may have even that infor
mation withheld on request.
Buckley Amendment
This policy was formed under the
Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974

(the "Buckley Amendment"), which
requires the University to keep cer
tain "directory" or public intorma
tion available to anyone who asks,
unless a student requests otherwise,
as outlined in the "Privacy of Student
Records" sheet published by the Of
fice of the Registrar.
The items published in the student
directory include name, sex, class,
major, local address and/or Stanford
P.O. box number, local phone
number, and permanent or legal ad
dress.
A student can instruct the Univer

sity to keep part or all ot this informa
tion private by tilling out a privacy
request torm. This torm and the pri
vacy information sheet are available
at the information window in the
lobby ot the Old Union.
Subpoena
Private student records can, how
ever, be made public through a sub
poena, explained Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton.
When this occurs, he said the Re
gistrar's Office, v. hich keeps student
records, wo rough the Univer-


Opposition to the draft here was vocal last year as de
monstrated by numerous rallies held, including this one in
January. But draft resisters here need not worry about the
University helping in a government prosecution of their

civil disobedience. Officials said the University plans no
involvement in government prosecutions for failure to re
gister should any be sought.
