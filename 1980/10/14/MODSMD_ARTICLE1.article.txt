# University plans to stay out of draft-resister prosecutions
## 
### Richard Hefter 
University officials will not take
any action or position against stu
dents here who may come under in
vestigation for draft registration vio
lations, according to Jennifer Wes
terlind of the University's legal of
fice.
"It is not our (the University's) bus
iness whether young men register
for the draft or not,'' Westerlind said.
Westerlind's comments came in
response to recently stated Selective
Service plans to refer the names of
draft registration violators to the jus
tice Department by the end of
November for possible prosecution.
Currently, Selective Service offi
cials estimate 6 percent of all eligible
registrants, or about 280,000 men,
have not complied with the draft re
gistration laws enacted earlier this
year.
Westerlind said personal informa
tion listed in the student directory is
legally available to the public, but
students may have even that infor
mation withheld on request.
Buckley Amendment
This policy was formed under the
Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974

(the "Buckley Amendment"), which
requires the University to keep cer
tain "directory" or public intorma
tion available to anyone who asks,
unless a student requests otherwise,
as outlined in the "Privacy of Student
Records" sheet published by the Of
fice of the Registrar.
The items published in the student
directory include name, sex, class,
major, local address and/or Stanford
P.O. box number, local phone
number, and permanent or legal ad
dress.
A student can instruct the Univer

sity to keep part or all ot this informa
tion private by tilling out a privacy
request torm. This torm and the pri
vacy information sheet are available
at the information window in the
lobby ot the Old Union.
Subpoena
Private student records can, how
ever, be made public through a sub
poena, explained Associate Registrar
Robert Houghton.
When this occurs, he said the Re
gistrar's Office, v. hich keeps student
records, wo rough the Univer-


Opposition to the draft here was vocal last year as de
monstrated by numerous rallies held, including this one in
January. But draft resisters here need not worry about the
University helping in a government prosecution of their

involvement in government prosecutions for failure to re
gister should any be sought.
sity counsel to determine it the sub
poena is valid. The counsel then de
cides it the information must be
given out.
"We try to contact the student first
when subpoenaed before giving out
any information," Houghton said.
He added student records are sub
poenaed about 20 times each year.
"An awful lot of people are still
registering," said Joan Lamb, public
affairs officer at the Selective Service
in Washington, D.C. She said there is
still no penalty for registering late,
but she would not say how much
longer this policy will continue.
Lamb said the maximum penalty
for violators is a $10,000 fine and/or
five years in prison. She said even a
minimal sentence is still recorded as
a felony conviction.
However, a Justice Department
spokesperson cited statistics from
the Vietnam War that show a small
percentage of convictions against
draft violators.
8682 convicted
Dean St. Dennis, assistant director
of the Office of Public Affairs at the

lustice Department, said from July
1%4 to June 1473 the Selective Ser
vice referred the names of 186,711
possible violators to the Justice De
partment. Of that number, 26,177
were indicted, 10,969 tried and 8682
convicted.
About WOO of those indicted were
dismissed because they sub
sequently agreed to comply with in
duction orders, he said.
Lamb said until the end of
November the Selective Service will
be reviewing their records to insure
accurate data on those who have re
gistered.
Acknowledgement
Each registrant should receive a
registration acknowledgement letter
and a change of information form for
correcting any errors on their regist
ration record.
Once this process is completed,
the Selective Service will identify
non-registrants by cross-referencing
their list of registrants with state
driver's license lists and other lists
containing names of eligible 19 and
20 year old males, Lamb said. These
names will then be forwarded to the
Justice Department.
In the past, Justice Department of
ficials have referred the names to
one of 59 FBI divisions located
throughout the country, an FBI
spokesperson in San Francisco said.
Investigation
He said the FBI investigates a case
and then contacts the U.S. Attorney's
Office which decides on whether or
not to present the case to a grand
jury. The grand jury decides on
whether or not to indict.
In response to the draft registra
tion law and possible prosecution of
students here, Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) is working to
provide support for students who
have not registered for the draft, said
Julie Barnard, a member of SAC. She
called the non-registrants "heroes."
The group will provide draft coun
seling for anyone, independent of
whether the person has registered or
not, she said. Draft counseling will
include information about the Selec
tive Service system and legal rights
concerning registration and the
draft, she added.

In response to the draft registra
tion law and possible prosecution of
students here, Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC) is working to
provide support for students who
have not registered for the draft, said
Julie Barnard, a member of SAC. She
called the non-registrants "heroes."
The group will provide draft coun
seling for anyone, independent of
whether the person has registered or
not, she said. Draft counseling will
include information about the Selec
tive Service system and legal rights
concerning registration and the
draft, she added.
University officials will not take
any action or position against stu
dents here who may come under in
vestigation for draft registration vio
lations, according to Jennifer Wes
terlind of the University's legal of
fice.
"It is not our (the University's) bus
iness whether young men register
for the draft or not,'' Westerlind said.
Westerlind's comments came in
response to recently stated Selective
Service plans to refer the names of
draft registration violators to the jus
tice Department by the end of
November for possible prosecution.
Currently, Selective Service offi
cials estimate 6 percent of all eligible
registrants, or about 280,000 men,
have not complied with the draft re
gistration laws enacted earlier this
year.
Westerlind said personal informa
tion listed in the student directory is
legally available to the public, but
students may have even that infor
mation withheld on request.
Buckley Amendment
This policy was formed under the
Family Rights and Privacy Act of 1974

(the "Buckley Amendment"), which
requires the University to keep cer
tain "directory" or public intorma
tion available to anyone who asks,
unless a student requests otherwise,
as outlined in the "Privacy of Student
Records" sheet published by the Of
fice of the Registrar.
The items published in the student
directory include name, sex, class,
major, local address and/or Stanford
P.O. box number, local phone
number, and permanent or legal ad
dress.
A student can instruct the Univer

sity to keep part or all ot this informa
tion private by tilling out a privacy
request torm. This torm and the pri
vacy information sheet are available
at the information window in the
lobby ot the Old Union.
Subpoena
Private student records can, how
ever, be made public through a sub

Robert Houghton.

sity counsel to determine it the sub
poena is valid. The counsel then de
cides it the information must be
given out.
"We try to contact the student first
when subpoenaed before giving out
any information," Houghton said.
He added student records are sub
poenaed about 20 times each year.
"An awful lot of people are still
registering," said Joan Lamb, public
affairs officer at the Selective Service
in Washington, D.C. She said there is
still no penalty for registering late,
but she would not say how much
longer this policy will continue.
Lamb said the maximum penalty
for violators is a $10,000 fine and/or
five years in prison. She said even a
minimal sentence is still recorded as
a felony conviction.
However, a Justice Department
spokesperson cited statistics from
the Vietnam War that show a small
percentage of convictions against
draft violators.
8682 convicted
Dean St. Dennis, assistant director
of the Office of Public Affairs at the

lustice Department, said from July
1%4 to June 1473 the Selective Ser
vice referred the names of 186,711
possible violators to the Justice De
partment. Of that number, 26,177
were indicted, 10,969 tried and 8682
convicted.
About WOO of those indicted were
dismissed because they sub
sequently agreed to comply with in
duction orders, he said.
Lamb said until the end of
November the Selective Service will
be reviewing their records to insure
accurate data on those who have re
gistered.
Acknowledgement
Each registrant should receive a
registration acknowledgement letter
and a change of information form for
correcting any errors on their regist
ration record.
Once this process is completed,
the Selective Service will identify
non-registrants by cross-referencing
their list of registrants with state
driver's license lists and other lists
containing names of eligible 19 and
20 year old males, Lamb said. These
names will then be forwarded to the
Justice Department.
In the past, Justice Department of
ficials have referred the names to
one of 59 FBI divisions located
throughout the country, an FBI
spokesperson in San Francisco said.
