# Just a few hills away, EPRI oversees 1000 energy projects

Although the Eltctric Power Research In
stitute (EPRI) is th» largest private research
organization in he United States, you
won't find any laboratories at its headquar
ters in Palo Alto a few hills southeast of
campus.
But you will find more than 600 en
gineers, scientits, and support staff cur
rently overseeitg nearly 1000 projects in
energy researcf across the country.
A non-profit agency founded in 1972,
EPRI serves as tie research arm of the elec
tric power indLstry. EPRI organizes, funds,
and manages projects that are actually car
ried out on a ontractual basis at various
utilities, businjsses, universities, and pri
vate labs throighout the nation.
Aialysis, planning
"EPRI is interested in all aspects of elec
tric power geieration, transmission, stor
age, and usag?," says Dr. Walter Esselman,
director of the Strategic Planning Depart
ment at EPFI. "We do the necessary
analysis and Dlanning to determine what
research shojld be performed."
Financial support comes from 637
member utilities, representing over 80
percent of the electric power production
capacity in ne United States. EPRI's re
search and cevelopment budget for 1980
was $240 millon, and the agency expects to
spend over 51 billion on research and de
velopment in the next five years.

Currently, much emphasis is placed on
"near term" projects — involving refine
ment and improvement of existing proces
ses and equipment — but nearly half of
EPRI's budget is spent on projects with
more far-reaching implications.
Approximately 25 percent of EPRI's funds
are spent on "mid-range" projects, which
have an expected payoff period of 10 to 25
years. Coals in this area include supplying
power in the face of more stringent en
vironmental standards and dwindling re
source supplies. Coal liquefaction, coal
gasification, fuel cells, solar-thermal con
version, photovoltaic cells, wind energy,
and geothermal energy are some of the
areas now under investigation."
Bigger, better batteries
Efficient ways to store energy, involving
biggerand better batteries, is also an active
field. Better batteries could make
technologies dependent on intermittent
resources, such as solar and wind, more
feasible in the near future.
Long-term projects, which aren't ex
pected to be commercially viable for at
least 25 years, round out EPRI's program.
Research in nuclear fusion is included in
this category.
EPRI must decide what possibilities de
serve the most funds and effort. Although
the decision makers at EPRI are mostly
members of the electric power industry,

additional input comes from an advisory
council, a diverse body of representatives
from government, business, education,
and labor groups.
"They bounce ideas off of us," com
ments Dr. Elie Abel, professor ot com
munications at Stanford and current EPRI
advisory council member. "There's no
doubt that the electric power industry is
going through a difficult time right now."
Energy sustains jobs
According to Abel, problems for the util
ity industry could spell trouble for the rest
of us. "If we are to have a productive
economy with enough jobs for everyone,
we must find ways of producing the power
to create and sustain those jobs."
Constant appraisal and reevaluation play
an important role. "EPRI can be very flexi
ble when research results indicate that a
shift in direction is needed, or when cur
rent events in the country as a whole
suggest change," says Esselman.
For example, EPRI responded rapidly to
the incident at Three Mile Island. A staff of
EPRI experts were soon examining the
technical aspects of the accident. "We are
still concentrating on lessons learned at
Three Mile Island," Esselman says.
Coal, nuclear power
Nevertheless, EPRI is still primarily em
phasizing development of coal and nuclear
power. "We still feel strongly that those are

the two tec hnologies that will make up the
bulk of our electricity generation in the
future," he explains.
Esselman describes the relationship be
tween EPRI and the federal Department of
Energy (DOE) as "complementary. The
DOE has an emphasis on long-term
answers to energy problems, while we
tend to look at specific problems that, from
the utilities' point of view, need solving
now," he says.
Though EPRI is independent of the tea
eral government, the agency often co
sponsors projects with the DOE. Not
being associated with the government aKo
means that EPRI can ignore politics when
deciding which projects to fund.
Despite this political objectivity, how
ever, the fact remains that EPRI is sup
ported by the electric power industry and
is primarily sensitive to that industry's
needs. Noticeably lacking from the names
on the advisory council are members of
major environmental or conservation or
ganizations.
High consumption forecasts
"Everything that comes out of EPRI has to
be taken with a grain of salt," says Mary
McCurdy, conservation coordinator of the
Loma Prietan chapter of the Sierra Club,
"For instance, their forecasts for future
power consumption in California are con
sistently higher than those of the California

Energy Commission. High projections are
d way to justify the building of new power
plants."
Carl Pope, director of politic al educ dtion
at the Sierra Club's national office. e< hoes
these sentiments: "The electric utilities as
sume from the start that people truly need
to use more and more electricity, and sup
plying an increased amount of electricity is
a top priority.
"EPRI is concerned with how new de
velopments will affect the industry, not
necessarily how these developments will
aifect the average citizen, the environ
ment, or the economy. That's their per
'(igative — but its not objective research.
EPR I goes about its task from a very
narrow viewpoint, and as a result they're
not looking at fhe big questions. They're
not looking at the actual c osts to everyone,
both economically and in quality of lite, of
increased electricity generation and us
age."
Mary Wentworth, a junior here who
worked at EPRI thjis summer, cited
information-gathering as one of EPRI s un
deniable strengths.
"The people I worked with have tons of
contact and know a lot of what's going cm
in energy technologies," she said. "EPRI
does a really good job of integrating bits of
information and making it available."
