## Reagan supports statism 
### 
It you liked Franklin Delano Roosevelt, vou
ought to love Ronald Reagan.
In his campaign rhetoric, Reagan likes to rail
against the New Deal big government policies
of the last half-century. In an era when many
Americans are beginning to comprehend that
government otters neither an efficient nor a
humane way of solving social and human prob
lems, Reagan's anti-government rhetoric may
well win him the White House.
However, Reagan's concrete positions on is
sues of substance belie his tree enterprise anti
government campaign rhetoric.
For example, the Social Security svstem is the
largest and best-known bureaucratic monu
ment to the New Deal. In 1%4, when the Ameri
can Right last nominated a candidate tor presi
dent, that candidate criticized Social Security
and suggested that participation be made volun
tary.
Ronald Reagan, however, has not only re
fused to utter any fundamental criticism of this
liberal shibboleth; Reagan also constantly reit
erates his firm support for Social Security and
his determination to "guarantee the integrity'
of the system.
Chain letter bankruptcy
Social Security is, in fact, a massive chain
letter which is collapsing into bankruptcy. It is a
multi-trillion dollar testimonial to the irrespon
sibility and human inadequacy of the welfare
state.
A person such as Ronald Reagan who sup
ports Social Security cannot honestly claim to be
an opponent of big government or of the wel
fare state.
Reagan's claim ot being a defender ot tree
enterprise is similarly contradicted by his sup
port for the federal bailout of Chrysler.
The tree market operates on the basis of profit
and loss. Companies which are unwilling or un
able to serve the demands of consumers lose
money and are forced out of business, and their
assets are sold to those who will better serve the
needs of the consumers.
Chrysler irresponsible
Chrysler was woefully negligent in serving the
consumers. In a free enterprise system,
Chrysler would have paid for its irresponsibility
with bankruptcy.
Reagan's support for federal intervention to
prop up Chrysler demonstrates that he does not

understand nor does he support a system ot tree
enterprise and economic freedom.
Reagan s position on taxcuts similarly showsa
determination to preserve the existing status
quo ot high taxes and big government.
As he himself states, "What many people tail
to realize is that my tax-cut plans merely reduce
the tax increase ot $ttb billion next year and more
than $500 billion over the next five years. My
cuts are only going to reduce that increase.
There will still be more money left tor. . .spend
ing."
Tax cuts a sham
In short, the Reagan "tax cuts" are a sham;
what his proposals will amount to in reality is a
continuing increase in government taxation and
spending.
Reagan's support for the ongoing federal
bailout ot New York City further confirms the
picture ot a man determined to maintain and
expand the welfare state and the power ot the
federal government.
In areas outside of economics Reagan does
not even pretend to oppose massive gov
ernmental intervention into people's lives. He
wishes to use the power of the state to deny
women control over their own bodies, and he
still opposes decriminalization of marijuana and
other victimless crimes.
Reagan is determined to increase the power
ot the American government to intervene in the
affairs of foreign peoples, and he openly ad
mires foreign despots (such as the late Shah of
Iran) who impose a large and oppressive gov
ernment upon their own nations.
Statist
Far from being a defender of individual lib
erty, Reagan is an unmitigated statist, a suppor
ter ot powerful, centralized, paternalistic gov
ernment which continually violates individual
rights. He is a clone from the same strain which
produced FDR, Harry Truman, and Lyndon
Johnson. His fundamental principles are hardly
distinguishable from President |immy Carter's
or |ohn Anderson's.
It is entirely appropriate that Reagan closed
his acceptance speech to the Republican Con
vention with a quote from Franklin D.
Roosevelt. In 1932 Roosevelt ako employed the
rhetoric of limiting government and reducing
spending to mask his true intentions.
