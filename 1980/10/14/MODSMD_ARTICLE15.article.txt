## Tango for cyclists and centaurs 
### 
At Stanford we ride the taut
wire between sex and death on
a winged bicycle. Anything —
the sudden tail fender of a
gleaming Alfa Romeo, a mo
ment's infatuation with a fal
ling leaf, even the beautific
smile of a shy girl in the soft
October light — all threaten us
with the pavement's lewd em
brace, the hot kiss of the as
phalt abyss, and the sacred

mingling of gravel and flesh.
It is fear, naked fear clicking
away in our minds like a well
tuned derailleur, the throat
scratching fear of losing our ba
lance that keeps us pedaling
furiously, thighs pumping,
down the center line of the
nude highway. At midnight, on
University Avenue and on
many of the side streets, you
can see us, performing our
spectral tap dance on the third
rail, drunk with fear.
Now we who have thus of
fered our limbs and souls,
helpless and naked, on the
altar of El Camino Real, who
have danced a swift tango with
death down the neon highway,
know what the rest of the
laboring world is passing by.
Ah you who have felt the hot
exhaust of thundering diesel
caress your face! Vou who
have thrown yourself in the
capricious white water of af
ternoon traffic! You, hypocrite
bicycliste - mon sembable -
mon frere! Vou know what it is
to dart across an intersection
of feline Ferraris and concupis

cent Corvettes, so many suc
cubae wildly jealous of your
nonchalance!
And how often, after a brush
with mishap's feral foil, have
you looked up only hear a
raven-haired beauty, her dark
eyes rapturous with admira
tion, whisper through her car
window, "Take me! Vou darl
ing bicyclist!"
We bicyclists on campus are
modern centaurs: half body,
half bike, demi-gods who
chance our immortality with
each proverbial turn of the
wheel. At our backs, around
the next corner, we always
hear death's winged Peugot
hurrying near.
We share the most profound
intimacy, our common expo
sure to death, mutilation, or,
worst of all, humiliation. I
wonder if Heloise and Abelard
ever exchanged so ardent a
look as that exchanged be
tween the author and the
lovely, young woman whose
plunging bicycle nearly cas
trated him under the Hoover
Tower?

These fleeting epiphanies of
horror and recognition, these
spasms of love and dread, form
the daily fare, the lingua franca
of all intrepid bicyclists. It's as
if, for one britt, shining mo
ment, our kinship to some
primeval race of heroes, long
since perished torn this earth,
lies revealed onh to disappear,
alas all too socn, under the
musty shroud o dull habit.
And that is wfy, each morn
ing in Palo Alto, when the sun
rises over the imoking Bay,
and sheds its light like broken
crystal on the bakeries and
dime stores of this drowsy vil
lage (which in th? Sunday of its
life shall surely inherit the
earth), I arise, brush my teeth,
mount my Pegasus, and ride
down these greei streets, now
tinted with a ading gold,
streets that beckon still, bec
kon always, becl.on anxiously
of love and danger, of some
thing out of life, of any
thing. . .
