# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Leah Halper Really working to prevent rape 
### 
\'m not sure what it is to be
called, so I'll just call it the har
poon. It seems to be distantly
related to those handshake
buzzers advertised in the backs
of comic boks. Designed to be
worn like a tampon, the har
poon is triggered to stab the
rapist's penis upon genital
penetration.
It hurts a lot, I understand. It
is being sold as an anti-rape
device on the assumption that
the threat of revenge will pre
vent sexual assault. As such,
the harpoon is a fine example
of slow, simplistic thinking
about rape.
Perhaps the inventor, an
American male, doesn't know
that many rapes are comitted
by friends, lovers, even hus
bands of the victims, or that
children are often attacked. In
his zeal to protect American
women, the inventor side
stepped the fact that many rapes
do not involve genital penetra
tion, though they are no less

painful, damaging 1 , < or violent
for that.
Harpoon revenge
Women who can stand to
carry inside them, 24 hours a
day, a weapon with such po
tential to maim, may realize too
late that the harpoon only re
venges rape. Revenge is a mis
erable substitute for preven
tion. Assuming the victim can
escape the enraged and
wounded rapist, or his friends
nearby, she has only returned
the violence done to her, and
violence can harm the victim as
well as the assailant.
Helplessness, weakness and
passivity can only be reversed
by active participation in self
protection: self-defense
techniques; community edu
cation; work against rape cul
ture in films, books and ads
that portray women being hurt
or humiliated in sexual or
non-sexual situations.
Re-think lifestyle
For me, rape prevention has
meant re-thinking my entire

lifestyle. Preventing rape has
meant thinking hard and often
about something I would pre
fer not to know exists. I vary my
running routes and schedules
and look at the other pair of
feet under the stall in an empty
bathroom. Rape prevention
has come to mean mustering
my indignation and telling
people a rape joke isn't funny,
that the sexist images in the
media are dangerous, that
women are being harmed and
demeaned.
Preventing rape means I
sometimes ask for an escort
when I would rather travel
alone, that I forgo pleasant,
solitary evening walks. Rape
prevention means that I some
times wonder (and dislike my
self for wondering) whether or
not acquaintances would ever
try to rape me.
My concern for safety has
forced me to learn to kick and
hit, skills which I never wanted
acquire. I struggle to achieve
personal safety and the peace

of mind I should be able to take
for granted.
