The Turkish coup
The column by Neskim Erkip
(Oct. 10) gave the impression
that the recent military coup in
Turkey was aimed at destroying
a viable democracy, and that
the only source of terrorism in
Turkey has been the neo
fascist movement. This is an
outright distortion as the fol
lowing facts demonstrate.
1. Parliamentary democracy
ceased to exist in Turkey many
years before the coup, largely
because the Turkish political
system, which like its analog in
the Third French Republic, was
unworkable. There has been
no stable government for a de
cade, and no reasonably strong
judiciary to protect citizens
from fanatic movements, re
sponsible toward the end for
over 150 political killings a
week.
The military reluctantly
seized power, not to topple
democracy, but to put an end
to a state of anarchy. Paradoxi
cally, the army is the only re
maining institution in Turkey
which is unified enough to
create the climate in which
democracy can be re
established and Ataturk's
dream of a modern, secular,
independent state realized.

2. There is not one terrorist
movement in Turkey, but sev
eral. A small minority of fana
tics, espousing causes ranging
from neo-fascism and anti
secularism to communism,
share equal responsibility for
turning Turkey into a virtual
battleground.
Despite their populist,
ultra-democratic rhetoric,
each of these groups has de
monstrated a degree of into
lerance bordering on lunacy.
Each group has murdered
countless thousands of civi
lians for reasons ranging from
reading "unsympathetic"
newspapers to being of the
"wrong" ethnic group.
The armed communist
guerilla movement has been
just as adept as its neo-fascist
counterpart at fueling ethnic
and religious divisions in an at
tempt to enlarge its base.
3. Since the coup the army
has cracked down on all brands

of terrorism with equal vigor.
Guerillas from all fanatic
ideologies, responsible for
thousands of deaths, have
been arrested and are being
put on trial.
Most recently, the military
announced that the leaders of
the neo-fascist National
Movement Party and the neo-
Islamic National Salvation
party will be tried. For the first
time in years, the democratic
majority in Turkey is not de
fenseless against militant
communism, fascism and
anti-secularism.
As Erkip indicates, we must
keep a critical eye on events in
Turkey, since military regimes
throughout the world are
notorious for their politcal ex
cesses.
After terrorism is eradicated
and parliamentary democracy
is restored, the Turkish military
must not be allowed to remain
in power. In the meantime, we

must be critical )f simplistic
analyses like Erkip's which vio
late standards of intellectual
honesty.

Cyclist malaise
Sooner or later some bright,
young Stanford cyclist will be
maimed or killed because of
widespread campus negli
gence.
Three major factors are in
volved:
1. Students. Stanford cyclists
flit among cars like birds, ob
livious to stop signs, filled with
that wonderful, heady sense of
youth as immortality. Shaw
said it best: "What a shame
that youth is wasted on the
young."
2. Law. Wherever Dike paths
are available, bikes should be
prohibited from roads. Rules
should be clearly morked and
systematically enforced. The
cost? Fines large enough to pay
for strict enforcement, and
possibly a modest bike regist
ration fee. There may be legal
obstacles to this. If so, they
should be removed.
3. Planning and Develop
ment. For nearly a century,
Stanford has been a bicycle col
lege. Yet the elaborate, ex
pensive system of roads has
been designed almost entirely
for cars, with poory built,
often torturous bike paths as
an afterthought. Wide, attrac
tive bike paths should be instal
led wherever they are needed,
and on both sides of streets.
If necessary, trees should be
cut down and new ones
planted to make them inviting
and convenient. Otherwise
students will continue to disf
regard them.
Added note: It is mad for
Palm Drive, with its hump, not
to be a divided four-lane road. I
know the problems: thd
bottleneck arch, and the sac
red palms which are dying but
which the university dare not
cut down. But problems are to
be solved: Slow traffic lor the
bottleneck, plant two rows of
young palms far enough apart
for the divided roads, arid care
for them so that they will grow
quickly and make the alumni
happy.

maimed or killed because of
widespread campus negli
gence.
Three major factors are in
volved:
1. Students. Stanford cyclists
flit among cars like birds, ob
livious to stop signs, filled with
that wonderful, heady sense of
youth as immortality. Shaw
said it best: "What a shame
that youth is wasted on the
young."
2. Law. Wherever Dike paths
are available, bikes should be
prohibited from roads. Rules
should be clearly morked and
systematically enforced. The
cost? Fines large enough to pay
for strict enforcement, and
possibly a modest bike regist
ration fee. There may be legal
obstacles to this. If so, they
should be removed.
3. Planning and Develop
ment. For nearly a century,
Stanford has been a bicycle col
lege. Yet the elaborate, ex
pensive system of roads has
been designed almost entirely
for cars, with poory built,
often torturous bike paths as
an afterthought. Wide, attrac
tive bike paths should be instal
led wherever they are needed,
and on both sides of streets.
If necessary, trees should be
cut down and new ones
planted to make them inviting
and convenient. Otherwise
students will continue to disf
regard them.
Added note: It is mad for
Palm Drive, with its hump, not
to be a divided four-lane road. I
know the problems: thd
bottleneck arch, and the sac
red palms which are dying but
which the university dare not
cut down. But problems are to
be solved: Slow traffic lor the
bottleneck, plant two rows of
young palms far enough apart
for the divided roads, arid care
for them so that they will grow
quickly and make the alumni
happy.

The Turkish coup
The column by Neskim Erkip
(Oct. 10) gave the impression
that the recent military coup in
Turkey was aimed at destroying
a viable democracy, and that
the only source of terrorism in
Turkey has been the neo
fascist movement. This is an
outright distortion as the fol
lowing facts demonstrate.
1. Parliamentary democracy
ceased to exist in Turkey many
years before the coup, largely
because the Turkish political
system, which like its analog in
the Third French Republic, was
unworkable. There has been
no stable government for a de
cade, and no reasonably strong
judiciary to protect citizens
from fanatic movements, re
sponsible toward the end for
over 150 political killings a
week.
The military reluctantly
seized power, not to topple
democracy, but to put an end
to a state of anarchy. Paradoxi
cally, the army is the only re
maining institution in Turkey
which is unified enough to
create the climate in which
democracy can be re
established and Ataturk's
dream of a modern, secular,
independent state realized.

2. There is not one terrorist
movement in Turkey, but sev
eral. A small minority of fana
tics, espousing causes ranging
from neo-fascism and anti
secularism to communism,
share equal responsibility for
turning Turkey into a virtual
battleground.
Despite their populist,
ultra-democratic rhetoric,
each of these groups has de
monstrated a degree of into
lerance bordering on lunacy.
Each group has murdered
countless thousands of civi
lians for reasons ranging from
reading "unsympathetic"
newspapers to being of the
"wrong" ethnic group.
The armed communist
guerilla movement has been
just as adept as its neo-fascist
counterpart at fueling ethnic
and religious divisions in an at
tempt to enlarge its base.
3. Since the coup the army
has cracked down on all brands

of terrorism with equal vigor.
Guerillas from all fanatic
ideologies, responsible for
thousands of deaths, have
been arrested and are being
put on trial.
Most recently, the military
announced that the leaders of
the neo-fascist National
Movement Party and the neo-
Islamic National Salvation
party will be tried. For the first
time in years, the democratic
majority in Turkey is not de
fenseless against militant
communism, fascism and
anti-secularism.
As Erkip indicates, we must
keep a critical eye on events in
Turkey, since military regimes
throughout the world are
notorious for their politcal ex
cesses.
After terrorism is eradicated
and parliamentary democracy
is restored, the Turkish military
must not be allowed to remain
in power. In the meantime, we

must be critical )f simplistic
analyses like Erkip's which vio
late standards of intellectual
honesty.
