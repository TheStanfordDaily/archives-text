# Conservation projects may get HUD money
## 
### Liz Rosner 
Despite federal bureaucratic de
lays, Stanford's Energy Conservation
Center says it expects finalization of
its $1.2 million loan from the De
partment of Housing and Urban De
velopment (HUD) any day now.
HUD approved the loan last spring
when the Center submitted a prop
osal for a number of energy-saving
projects, but somechanges in HUD's
Colleges and Universities Depart
ment have slowed the process
somewhat.
Nevertheless, according toECCDi
rector )ohn Eaton, implementation
of the projects should begin this
quarter.
"I would hope that all of the pro
jects will be completed before next
fall, but that's a very conservative es
timate â€” they could be finished
sooner," said Eaton.
The completed projects are ex
pected to produce an annual savings
of about $200.000.
Three new projects
The Center has plans for three pro
jects including conversion to
fluorescent lighting, insulation of
wall and attic spaces and modifica
tion of heatingcontrols and systems.
The project changing from incan
descent lights will focus on 24-hour
lights found in hallways, bathrooms
and food service kitchens. The new
fluorescent fixtures will be two to
three times more efficient, Faton
said. He said the University will be
using a "warm white" light, citing a
common aversion to the noise and
harsh color of some fluorescent
lights.
Modification of heating controls
and systems will affect all of the
dorms and most of the Row houses.

Plans include installation of indi
vidual thermostatically controlled
valves in each student room, giving
the student "optimum control,"
Eaton said.
Maintenance problems
Because similar controls have
posed maintenance problems in a
few places on campus, however, the
University Office ot Engineering is
looking tor an alternative approach.
Since its birth in 1977 as part ot the
Housing and Food Services Depart
ment, the ECC has conducted a
number of successful projects.
The most consistently successful,
according to Eaton, is the awareness
program, which began as the cent

er's pilot project in Lagunita early in
1977. The ECC posts energy-use
charts in University housing to in
crease student awareness of the
need to conserve energy.
The program was expanded in the
fall of 1977 and has resulted in a con
tinued decrease in electrical usageof
about 25 percent annually, as com
pared to the "base year" of 1976.
Significant savings
This figure, Eaton claimed, repre
sents significant savings. He com
pared the University's results with
those in other universities, who
often use short-term "contest-type"
projects to encourage conservation.
While Hayward State has shown

sizeable reductions in energy usage,
its savings largely reflect the installa
tion of time clocks to limit their year
round, 24-hour heating and cooling
systems, he said.
Other ECC projects have included
adjustment of residence hall washing
machines to wash only in warm or
cold water and to rinse in cold, sav
ing over $12,000 during 1979-80.
Showerheads
Low-flow showerheads were in
stalled in most undergraduate resi
dences at an overall project cost of
S12,350, with an expected annual sav
ings of over $100,000.
In winter and spring quarters of
1978, the ECC sponsored a SWOPSI
class which designed and installed a
solar hot water system at Roth
House. The course was taught by karl
lohnson, founder of the ECC.
The Center has also sponsored a
number of individual student pro
jects. This past summer, two Univer
sity students biked 2500 miles to
Chicago to raise money for the ECC's
student project fund. Michael Siegel
and Richard Hefter raised about
$11,000 from 500 to 600 sponsors who
pledged a penny per mile.
