## Ray Davies stays sober as Kinks clean up in Oakland 
### Lucy Richert 
Time was when you had to be a genuine
Kinks (ultist to even sit through an entire
Kinks concert. In the early seventies, for
example, the group toured sporadically and
what concerts there were are mainly re
membered lor the band's onstage intoxica
tion, collective amnesia when it came to the
lyri< sof even their most popular songs, and
mid-song tights between lead singer/
songwriter Ray Davies and his lead
guitarist brother Dave.
Fortunately, times have changed. In the
last three or tour years, in one of the most
amazing resurrections in rock history, the
Kinks have overcome a decade of obscurity
and re-established themselves as one of the
best rock bands around. Their new double
live album will certainly be the biggest seller
ot their career — they're back on the road to
support it, and judging from their show at
the Oakland Auditorium on Oct. 7, the
pathetic self-destruct ac t of the early 70's is
gone. The 1480 version of the live Kinks
makes a strong case for the renewed vitality
of the current rock scene, while providing a
stunning affirmation of the talent and resi
liency of this remarkable band.
In 1%7 the Kinks reached a stage common
to all truly great rock bands: they stopped
merely turning out terrific rock songs and
began turning out terrific rock songs that no
one else could have done.

Led by Ray Davies, one of the halt-dozen
or so certifiable geniuses in post-Beatles
rock, the group started a series ot artful,
almost intellectual alliums which, despite
the occasional Top 40 hit ("Lola," "Sunny
Afternoon") and several popular FM radio
cuts, went virtually ignored by the public.
Ihere's a very simple reason for this popu
lar neglect, which went on for almost a de
cade. The post b7 Kinks just don't do normal
rock songs. 'Ihey don't sing about sex and
drugs, don't write anthems to c ruisin' and
partying; their songs aren't easy, they don't
quite fit into the mainstream. The Kinks sing
about the British working class (they are
perhaps the most purely British band in
rock), in songs populated by misfits and sur
vivors of the modern age.
Only the Kinks could get away with songs
about the fall of the British Empire as a
metaphor for the general decline of the
West, or the struggle of the Little Man to
make sense of his life in the face of scourges
ranging from hay fever to fascism to the
atomic bomb. In case this material strikes
you as a mite cerebral tor a three-chord rock
band, be assured that the Kinks make rock
n' roll as kinetic, as haunting, as memorable
as anyone's.They've simply stuck to their
own unique style and vision throughout
even the most dire commercial and critical
straits, waiting for the rest of the world to
catch up with them.

Now, after 1b years, twenty-odd albums,
and three record labels, the Kinks have fi
nally been vindicated. What was for years
the most loyal tan cult in rock has swelled to
a mass following. The Kinks packed the Oak
land Auditorium, whi( h seats about 6000, for
two shows (three years ago they barely sold
out a iOOO-seater). Unlortunately, the switch
from cult band to a mass appeal band pre
sents some problems, and parts of Tuesday's
show reflected that. The main problem,
though, wasn't the band's fault, it was the
Oakland Auditorium itself, generally
ac knowledged to have the worst acoustics of
any major rock venue in the Bay Area. If they
aren't played loud enough, bass, electric
guitar, and keyboards all sound the same in
that hall, and the Kinks responded in the
only possible way — they turned everything
way up.
The band was responsible for my other
major complaints. First of all, they only
played for 75 minutes, including encores. To
be fair, that's pretty standard procecedure
among rock bands today, most of whom
have trouble putting together an hour's
worth of decent material anyway. That isn't
the Kinks' problem, however, and it seems a
pretty shabby way to treat people who paid
$10.50 a pop and risked their sense of hear
ing to go see them. The other disappoint
ment was the song selection. They stressed
last year's Low tiudget album at the expense

ot earlier, more interesting material - nota
bly "Waterloo Sunset," a song so good most
bands would have built a whole concert
around it but which the Kinks chose to ig
nore. On the other hand, most ot the audi
ence were recent converts to the Kinks and
probably paid to hear the songs they knew.
Similarly, I suppose the 80 percent ot the
crowd who knew little and cared less about
Kinks historv enjoyed hearing "Twist and
Shout" as an encore. But considering the
wealth of Kinks material left unplayed, an
Isley Brothers chestnut was just plain un
necessary.
The Kinks are a five-piece band, but what
makes a Kinks concert is the Davies tandem
— as go Ray and Dave, so goes the show
and Ray was in top form Tuesday night. He is
a showman in the English music hall tradi
tion: enthusiastic and ingratiating, he
exhorts the crowd to clap along and some
times, frankly, milks them (tfie "no, we're
not going to do 'Lola' — okay, okay, but onlv
if you sing along" routine is wearing a bit
thin). It's wondertul to see him healthy and
sober, and considering what he's been
through and accomplished in his career he
deserves to milk a little applause now and
then.
For my money, though, the star of the
show was his brother Dave. He got to do two
songs from his (highly recommended) new

solo album, driving, lushlv chorded, verv
un-Kinkslike tunes. During the kinks num
bers he was simply thrilling — here's a man
who wrote the book on power-chord roc k as
a teenager, and sixteen years later lie still
plays with all the tire and abandon he tilled
those early grooves with. Dave's solos are
light, fresh, and exciting and although
he's one of the tew people who could prob
ably get away with it, he completely avoids
the lame macho guitar-god posturing most
lesser guitarists master before they strum
their tirst t-chord.
It's hard not to be an apologist tor the
Kinks. It's hard not to say, so thev only
played for an hour an hour of Kinks is worth
three hours ot most other bands," mainly
because it's the truth. Anyway, the Kinks
don't need an apologist. The songs they do
and the length of time they play doesn't re
ally matter. The whole point of a Kinks (on
cert is that the band is actually, miraculouslv,
in spite of everything, there. When the Kinks
hit their stride in concert thev are simply
definitive rock n roll, something a band like
Van Halen (or about a thousand others)
couldn't achieve it they played everv rock
song ever written tor tree. It you missed
them on this tour, you'll probably get
another chance next year. From their per
formance Tuesday night, l ei say the Kinks
will be on top tor a while to come.
