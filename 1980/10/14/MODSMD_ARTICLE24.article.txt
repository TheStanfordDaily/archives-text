### 
The last remaining tickets for
the 1980-81 season of the San
Francisco Symphony will go on
sale tomorrow and Thursday at
the Tresidder box office. These
tickets (at reduced prices) are
for the special 12 concert Stu
dent Forum series and are av
ailable exclusively to students.
The series lasts from
November to May.
Demand for tickets has been
unusually high this year be
cause the symphony has
moved into the nouveau nee
Davies Symphony Hall (no rela
tion to the Kinks tandem)
which was opened last month
with a gala inaugural concert.
Although the hall with its hang
ing sonic modulators bears a
close resemblance to Maples
Pavilion, it is rumored to be the
most aurally sophisticated
structure of its ilk. Those who
have heard symphonic con
certs in Maples are certain to
be pleased by the comparison.
This is your chance to hear
long-hair music of the old sort
in an ultra-techno-mod setting
at discount 1977 prices.


Davies Hall: looks like Maples but its really a triumph of acousto-engineering
