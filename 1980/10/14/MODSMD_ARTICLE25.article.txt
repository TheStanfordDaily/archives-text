# Young grows old
## 
### Bill Sundstrom 
"First of all, forget what you
may have heard about late Les
ter Young." That's the way the
liner notes to "Lester Young in
Washington, D.C. 19% Vol. II"
(Pablo) begin. Unfortunately, it
you have ever heard the early
Lester Young, that caveat won't
quite suffice. What the liner
notes should tell you is to push
the brilliant and innovative Les
ter Young of the ' Ms and '40s to
the back of your mind and let
this swinging, relaxed and en
joyable album take over.
The fact is, by 1956 tenor
saxophonist Young was no
longer the inspired genius
who, perhaps more than any
other figure, helped create the
sound we call "modern jazz."
Compare, for example, the
version of Young's blues,
")umpin' with Symphony Sid,"
on this album with earlier re
cordings. difference lies
not only in'a quite understand
able loss of technical ability,
but a certain lack of assurance
as well.
Nonetheless, the night ot
December 7, 1956, found "the
Prez" in a relaxed and playful
mood â€” something that had
become rare in his later years.

On the basis of this recording
alone, one might be inclined to
say Lester Young had mel
lowed with age, rather than
become depressed and
exhausted.
On the live recording,
Young is joined by the house
trio at Olivia's Patio Lounge:
pianist Bill Potts, bassist Nor
man Williams and drummer
jim Lucht. The group is at its
best when it swings at a mod
erate tempo, and the trio,
though competent, is most en
joyable while accompanying
Young's superior solos.
Young's best solo comes on
the second side in "Lullabye of
Birdland," in which he displays
many ot the traits one remem
bers from the earlier stuff. The
tone is "cool," but not without
feeling, the phrasing fluid, the
timing impeccable.
Most striking is the great
economy with which Lester
Young plays. On the best
solos, not a note is supertlu
ous, not a gesture is without its
good purpose. In "Lullabye,"
Young has absorbed the
melody and brought it forth
bearing his own personality.
