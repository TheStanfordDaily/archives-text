# Walter Matthau in a spy thriller?
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
In Hopscotch, Walter Matthau plays
Miles kendig, a CIA agent who is relegated
to a desk job by a supervisor, Myerson
(Ned Beatty), who dislikes him, and rebels
by writing a book exposing the agency's
worst scandals. Matthau, with his lanky
teddy bear looks and that cautious minc
ing walk that proclaims with every step a
middle-aged hypochondriac's fear of of
fending his body, is such a peculiar choice
for the role of a secret agent that his first
laugh comes when he identifies his pro
fession — and of course that incongruity
turns out to be the principal running
gag of the picture. In the opening scene,
Kendig appropriates some film from a
Soviet agent of his own age (Herbert Lom)
whom he has known for years; when the
Russian says he might try making a run for
it, Kendig reminds him that at their age
they would look ridiculous running
through the streets — like Laurel and
Hardy. Later, when Kendig visits an old
flame in Germany (Glenda Jackson), and
makes sexual overtures to her, she asks
him what he has that is so valuable and he
replies, "Do you like antiques?"
Matthau can get away with reading lines
like these without making them sound like
depressed Neil Simon-style writing be
cause we don't really believe that he un
dervalues his own skills and sexiness. In
fact, the movie is about how clever Kendig

is, and Matthau plays him as so pleased
with himself that he practically crows — in
fact, he does crow, to the tune of "Largo al
factotum'' from The Barber of Seville.
Matthau plays against Kendig's middle
aged exhaustion in so many ways that this
central joke, which is a joke on itself, be
comes funnier as the movie progresses.
Hopscotch is a small picture, but it is
surprisingly enjoyable. The script by Brian
Garfield and Bryan Forbes (from a novel

'Matthau, with his lanky teddy bear looks, is such a
peculiar choice ..

by Garfield) sets up a series of deft tricks
that keep Kendig one step ahead of his
pursuing cohorts at the C I A and the au
dience has a good time watching Kendig's
sleight of hand. Ronald Neame, the direc
tor, is a cold fish, but he is competent and
keeps the picture moving fairly quickly,
with only occasional dead spots (like two
scenes between Kendig and a woman he
hires to fly to Bermuda). Neame is English
(although he has been making American
movies for years) and in fact Hopscotch
resembles some of the British comedies of
the fifties that featured Alec Guinness or
Alastair Sifn and were spun on neat plot
devices. They weren't great movies, but
theyareoften remembered with pleasure.

As kendig's paramour, Glenda lacksori
is not warm exactly, but at least she is less
crisp than usual; it's the tirst tairly relaxed
performance she has given in years —
since Nasty Habits, in which she parodied
her own aggressive-precise approach to
acting. (Glenda lackson usually reminds
me of a guillotine.) Ned Beatty is less suc
cessful. Essentially miscast in the role of a
man with no sense of humor, he flails
around, trying to make the obscenities in

his lines sound persuasive. (Myerson is
permanently outraged). Sam Waterston
plays ]oe Cutter, Kendig's replacement —
the friend who is assigned to stop him.
Waterston has a laid-back style, and he
looks like he might be a younger version of
Matthau, which was surely the intention in
casting him; but he doesn't have very
much personality (a problem that has, I
think, kept him in supporting roles in
movies toryears, though he had consider
able success on the New York stage before
that). Of course. Cutter is set up by the
movie; he can't look good, because he is
matched with Kendig, and the point is that
Kendig, this ridiculous agent who never
carries a gun, looks better than anyone.

carries a gun, looks better than anyone.
In Hopscotch, Walter Matthau plays
Miles kendig, a CIA agent who is relegated
to a desk job by a supervisor, Myerson
(Ned Beatty), who dislikes him, and rebels
by writing a book exposing the agency's
worst scandals. Matthau, with his lanky
teddy bear looks and that cautious minc
ing walk that proclaims with every step a
middle-aged hypochondriac's fear of of
fending his body, is such a peculiar choice
for the role of a secret agent that his first
laugh comes when he identifies his pro
fession — and of course that incongruity
turns out to be the principal running
gag of the picture. In the opening scene,
Kendig appropriates some film from a
Soviet agent of his own age (Herbert Lom)
whom he has known for years; when the
Russian says he might try making a run for
it, Kendig reminds him that at their age
they would look ridiculous running
through the streets — like Laurel and
Hardy. Later, when Kendig visits an old
flame in Germany (Glenda Jackson), and
makes sexual overtures to her, she asks
him what he has that is so valuable and he
replies, "Do you like antiques?"
Matthau can get away with reading lines
like these without making them sound like
depressed Neil Simon-style writing be
cause we don't really believe that he un
dervalues his own skills and sexiness. In
fact, the movie is about how clever Kendig

is, and Matthau plays him as so pleased
with himself that he practically crows — in
fact, he does crow, to the tune of "Largo al
factotum'' from The Barber of Seville.
Matthau plays against Kendig's middle
aged exhaustion in so many ways that this
central joke, which is a joke on itself, be
comes funnier as the movie progresses.
Hopscotch is a small picture, but it is
surprisingly enjoyable. The script by Brian
Garfield and Bryan Forbes (from a novel

'Matthau, with his lanky teddy bear looks, is such a
peculiar choice ..

by Garfield) sets up a series of deft tricks
that keep Kendig one step ahead of his
pursuing cohorts at the C I A and the au
dience has a good time watching Kendig's
sleight of hand. Ronald Neame, the direc
tor, is a cold fish, but he is competent and
keeps the picture moving fairly quickly,
with only occasional dead spots (like two
scenes between Kendig and a woman he
hires to fly to Bermuda). Neame is English
(although he has been making American
movies for years) and in fact Hopscotch
resembles some of the British comedies of
the fifties that featured Alec Guinness or
Alastair Sifn and were spun on neat plot
devices. They weren't great movies, but
theyareoften remembered with pleasure.

As kendig's paramour, Glenda lacksori
is not warm exactly, but at least she is less
crisp than usual; it's the tirst tairly relaxed
performance she has given in years —
since Nasty Habits, in which she parodied
her own aggressive-precise approach to
acting. (Glenda lackson usually reminds
me of a guillotine.) Ned Beatty is less suc
cessful. Essentially miscast in the role of a
man with no sense of humor, he flails
around, trying to make the obscenities in

his lines sound persuasive. (Myerson is
permanently outraged). Sam Waterston
plays ]oe Cutter, Kendig's replacement —
the friend who is assigned to stop him.
Waterston has a laid-back style, and he
looks like he might be a younger version of
Matthau, which was surely the intention in
casting him; but he doesn't have very
much personality (a problem that has, I
think, kept him in supporting roles in
movies toryears, though he had consider
able success on the New York stage before
that). Of course. Cutter is set up by the
movie; he can't look good, because he is
matched with Kendig, and the point is that
Kendig, this ridiculous agent who never
carries a gun, looks better than anyone.
