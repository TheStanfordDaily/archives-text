Ihese three records, each recorded in the
past year, are by accomplished artists whose
peaks ot popularity and creativity were decades
apart. Count Basie, |oe Turner and Cleanhead
Vinson are famous tor their influential blues
style trom the 30 sand 40's. Osiar Peterson is
best known tor his trios, especially the one with
Ed Thispen and Ray Brown in the late 50's and
early b0 s. Both Basie and Peterson are enjoying
a renaissance on Norman Granz's Pablo label,
each releasing two or more records a year. It is
instructive to compare these artists with Phil
Woods, who came up through the bands of
Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Quincy
lones in the 50's, but who has only reached
prominence in the past tew years in his own
quartet. It may be fairly said that he is at the
height of his powers now, with a string of
downbeat awards and Grammies trom his re
cent work.
For the past five years, Woods has led a splen
did quartet that provides the ideal context for
his bop-cum-modern jazz style. The Quartet's
newest album was recorded live and is billed as
volume I of a series. As the concert attests, the
quartet's longevity has made it a tight, well
balanced unit, inspired and propelled by
Wood's unfailing swing and pure-toned lyri
cism. With only two tunes on a side, the musi
cians get a chance to stretch out in their solos,
and no matter how hard or fast they play, they
project a sense of ease, as if they've been play
ing together all their lives.
The music is tasteful and undoubtedly mod
ern, but it acknowledges the past masters who
have influenced the group's music. In the Bud
Powell tune "Hallucinations," pianist Mike
Melillo affects a jagged, percussive edge on his
solo, much like Powell himself. On "Bloom
dido," Woods frequently reminds one of his
debt to Charlie Parker, yet his own tone, clarity
and passionate expression far surpass the limits
of imitation and evoke a style all his own.
This quartet is one of the best combos cur
rently recording, and this performance is excel
lent. Certainly we have a great deal to look for
ward to in the further volumes of this series.
Oscar Peterson has long been known as one
of the most technically proficient pianists in
jazz. He has remarkable speed; his hands seem
to have total independence and he can play all
jazz styles from bop back to ragtime. Further
more, he often mixes styles, rhythms and struc
tures simultaneously. For example, on Digital at
Montreux's "Indiana," he plays a stride-style left
hand with a boppish right hand in double-time.
He may shift tempos and styles without warning
but still preserves the structure of the songs.
Niels-Henning Orsted Peterson accompanies
on bass, and he deserves equal billing, as he
plays "That's All'' unaccompanied and has an
integral part in all the other tunes. He provides
melody and counterpoint to the piano with per
fect tone and faultless technique. The digital
recording really brings out the bass in this live
performance, and Peterson sounds even better
than his past live recordings, which are gener

oily superlative.
Like all Oscar Peterson records, this one has
flair, drama and tun. There is never a dull mo
ment in it, and — even more surprising there
is never a tasteless moment in it. Other talented
pianists often use their techniques mainly to
show off (Monty Alexander comes to mind
here), but Peterson never gives that impression.
For example, in "On the Trail, he manipulates
tempo and volume with a number ot breaks that
leave the listener hanging betore the next
plunge into a completely different voice.
It there is any fault here, it is that we never
hear real ballads, which Peterson can pi a v beaut
ifully. The result is that the listener teels a touch
of Art Tatum overkill at the end of the record,
but this is a minor problem, and one that most
musicians would take as a compliment. (Listen
ers should note that the record never c redits
"Lush Lite" as the first song ot the "Ellington
Medley," presumably because it is by Ellington's
collaborator, Billy Strayhorn.)
Kansas City Shout is Norman Granz's attempt
to recreate a blues holler competition that might
have occurred in a black dancehall in the U) s by
placing two grand old blues shouters back to
back, supported by the Basie band. It is unfor
tunate that the session could not have been
recorded in the TO's, because some of the
music's vitality seems to have been lost in the
intervening years. Big Joe Turner suffers most
from this, largely because his voice had been a
cannon that could bellow over the backing
band, but now is noticeably weak. The loss of
power is particularly apparent in "Everyday I Have
the Blues" in comparison to his past perfor
mances of this great standard. The Basie band
sounds tight and silky here, but Turner sounds
as if his teeth are falling out.
Cleanhead Vinson fares better, as he has
always depended more on a throaty, sorrowtul
tremolo, and he still has quite a few shouts in
him when the occasion calls. He creates an emo
tional impact by varying the volume, tone and
rhythm of his voice in much the same way Basie
plays piano. Cleanhead also adds alto sax solos
in a hard-swinging, pure blues style that fits the
music better than the solos of the more modern
(and fluent) band members. (In the inner notes,
Granz claims that Vinson's alto style first at
tracted him because it was the closest to Charlie
Parker's he'd ever heard. No such resemblance
can be found on this record).
Curiously, the current band sounds anemic
on this record — perhaps because the arrange
ments (which are not credited) feature the voc
alists. The real treat here is the Count, who plays
about half the cuts in trio and quartet (without
vocals). Although Basie isn't as fast or strong as
he once was, he has somehow eliminated only
the inessential elements of his art. He is an ex
pert at using silences and contrasts, and never
fails to do something surprising to liven up the
most familiar blues tune. Cleveland Eaton's bass
had total control of the beat, playing with swing
ing drive, and he was equally impressive on his
short solos.
Norman Granz is to be congratulated for try
ing to preserve the blues holler, in which, as
Leonard Feather said, sonority and conviction
take precedence over clarity of diction. Unfor
tunately, this form is dying as its originators
reach their dotage, and only a few die-hards like
Count Basie are able to carry on the tradition.


Count Basie is neither a nobleman nor a bass player, although he does plunk a fine piano.
