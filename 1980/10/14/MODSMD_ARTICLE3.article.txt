# Iran eyes 'decisive' win in new offensive
## 
### Washington Post 
Baghdad, Iraq — With its so far in
decisive war against Iran entering its
fourth week, Iraq yesterday pushed
forward with its biggest offensive ot
the war in a determined drive to
come up with a victory that would
convince Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini to sue for peace.
Having failed to impress in the
field until now because of the con
servatism of its military tactics, Iraq
finally seems to be going for broke in
an effort to overwhelm the deter
mined, and surprisingly effective,
Iranian resistance in Iran's Khuzistan
province that has so far stalled the
superior Iraqi forces.
Unable to gain control of the Ira
nian river port of Khorramshahr after
three weeks of savage siege, the Iraq
military has attempted an end run
around it, ferrying troops and tanks
over the Karun RiveMOmiles northof
the port in a drive to cut off its defen
ders and encircle the important oil
refinery center at Abadan, 10 miles
further west.
To put teeth to its drive toward
Abadan, the Iraqis have finally begun

to unleash their air force, until now
held mostly in reserve.
Modern bridging equipment and
amphibious vehicles have been
brought forward to the Karun River
that is used by the Iranians as their
main defense line. And, in an effort
to break civilian morale, huge, Soviet
SCUD surface-to-surface missiles
have been unleashed against Khuzis
tan cities in an effort to terrorize their
populations.
All-out gamble
The battle shaping up over the
precarious Karun River crossing and
around Abadan to the west is being
viewed here by Western diplomats as
without a doubt the most important
of the war so far. For the Iraqis it
represents an all-out gamble to wrest
the sort of victory that has so far
eluded its ponderously slow-moving
army. While for Iran the battle repre
sents its best chance to blunt the
Iraqi initiative on the battlefield,
once and for all.
A victory at Abadan would allow
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
claim some ot the prestige and clout
in the Arab world that he had clearly
sought to establish with a quick and
surgical strike, a la Israel , against
Iran in the first days of the war.
Should Iraq fail to overwhelm
Abadan, as the Iraqi forces have so
far failed to conquer any other major
Iranian strategic position, the con
flict between the two nations would
seem doomed to bog down into a
costly and protracted battle of attri
tion where there could be neither
victors nor vanquished.
Western diplomats here believe
that, Iraq, forone, could sustain such
a war for a long time, six months to a
year, they maintain. Iran would seem
less prepared for such an effort ex
cept for the stubbornness and fanati
cism of its revolutionary leaders — a
factor that makes any true assess
ment of their real staying power hard
to measure.
Though the Soviet Union has con
sistently maintained its neutrality in
the conflict between Iraq and Iran, it
is generally considered to be still
providing Iraqi military supplies
under its special treaty of friendship
with Iraq.
