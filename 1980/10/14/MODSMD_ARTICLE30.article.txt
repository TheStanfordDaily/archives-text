# Willie and Phil and the '60s
## A 						retrograde retrospective 
### Mike Lopez 
Menage a Iron,, 1960 s re
hash, or a movie about a flaky
(hick would be some terms
applied to the film Willie and
Phil if you |ust read a capsule
description. Despite some ot
the short-comings in the
screenplay, Willie and Phil
comes off looking pretty good.
The plot begins with Willie
(Michael Ontkean, Slapshot)
meeting Phil (Ray Sharkey) at a
screening of Francois Trut
faut's lules and lim. Willie,
who is a high school teacher
and really into the New York
Yankees and jazz piano, in
stantly relates to Phil, who is a
photographer, hyperactive
and stereotypically Italian.
They share stories of their past,
an occasional beer, and gen
eral free time. On one paricu
lar day, our lead duo dec ides to
pick up a couple of women in
Central Park. Phil strikes out
while Willie meets Jeanette

(Margot Kidder, Superman).
from that moment on, the
movie revolves around these
three characters and the vari
ous mutations ot their triangle.
As it turns out, Jeanette has
to leave her apartment and,
through a coin flip, moves in
with Willie. And as predicted,
she and Willie become i n -
volved and eventually are mar
ried. However, one could not
predict that all three are still
extremely attached to one
another and choose to main
tain the triangle.
The remainder of the movie
is spent exposing the sides of
this triangle and the strains
placed upon it over a nine-year
period.
The film is highlighted by
superb performances by
Michael Ontkean and Kay
Sharkey. Ontkean portrays
Willie starting with his escape
from New York and a general
urban claustrophobia to a
self-subsistence farm and

eventually, an ashram in India.
Through each phase, Ontkean
was most believable and well
suited tor the part. Sharkey
portrays the film s constant: as
Phil, he is always the emo
tional, energetic catalyst ot the
trio who seems to be the in
itiator of major events. Even
when Phil moves from New
York to Los Angeles to turther
his profession (commercials),
his only change is a sun tan.
On the other hand, Margot
Kidder was a little less than
what the role demanded. The
strong emotional ties between
her and the two men were
sometimes unclear due to her
indifference. However, she
was most convincing at acting
paranoid while on LSD. Over
all, the character of Jeanette
required an actress who could
depict the feelings and emo
tions in a more convincing
manner.
Even though the plot covers

the years 1470 through 1474,
the makers ot Willie and I'hil
appropriately chose not to
exploit the popular rot k songs
ot those years. Ever since
American Cratfiti. many mo
tion pictures have included
sound tracks that were laced
with popular hits, many ot
which were unsuccessful. The
temptation to spike the film
with late 'bOs and early "Os
music must have been strong;
the restraint eliminated a need
less distraction.
Willie and Phil is a film that
provides a glimpse ot people
evolving after .the bOs. People
did indeed go to India to get
their heads together, or
flounce off to the country to
escape the city. People's lives
did change and some ot these
changes are depicted in Willie
and Phil.
iWillie and Phil is playing at
the Tivoli Theatre in San Car
los.)
