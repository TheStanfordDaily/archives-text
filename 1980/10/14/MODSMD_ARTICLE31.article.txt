Cuba to release jailed Americans
Washington — Cuba announced yesterday that it
is releasing all Americans currently jailed in Cuba,
including those held on hijacking charges, in a
move greeted cautiously by the State Department
as a "positive step."
Although an announcement by the Cuban gov
ernment said the "pardon" applied to "all U.S.
citizens who are currently serving prison terms in
Cuba, there were differing figures on exactly how
many persons would be freed.
Estimates of how many Americans are being
held in Cuba prisons ranged from about 30 to
more than 40.
The imprisoned Americans reportedly include
10 persons held on aircraft hijacking charges. Most
are accused of drug trafficking, and none are polit
ical prisoners, Cuban spokesmen here said.
It was not immediately clear whether any of the
released Americans would be subject to criminal
charges it they returned to the United States. The
Cuban announcement said the Americans would
be free to depart for the country of their choice
upon their release. U.S. officials said that any pris
oners who faced prosecution in the United States
would be so informed before coming here.
State Department sources said the Cuban deci
sion marked that country's fourth conciliatory ges
ture toward the United States in recent weeks.
They said they believed these moves signal an
effort by the government of President Fidel Castro
to avoid becoming an issue in the U.S. presidential
campaign.
Officially, the State Department had no com
ment on speculation that the Cuban move is in
tended to give President jimmy Carter's re
election campaign a boost. But department
sources said privately that Castro, mindful of Re
publican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan's
strong anti-Cuba stand, apparently fears that a
Reagan victory could lead to harmful confronta
tion between the two countries.
During his campaign, Reagan has advocated a
U.S. naval blockade of Cuba to prevent its Com
munist government from aiding Marxist rebellions
in other parts of the world.
Argentinian awarded Nobel Prize
Oslo, Norway — The 1980 Nobel Peace Prize was
awarded yesterday to Adolfo Perez Esquivel, an
Argentine human rights activist who boldly chal
lenged his country's military government and paid
with more than a year in prison.
Perez Esquivel's activism, born in Argentina's
mounting political violence of the late 1960s and
early 19705, was based on his own Roman Catholi
cism and on Indian leader Mohandas Gandhi's
philosophy of non-violence.
The 48-year-old scuiptor and architect was hon
ored for having "shone a light in the darkness" of
Argentina during a period of leftist terrorism and
right-wing government repression, the Norwe
gian Nobel Committee said.
Perez Esquivel, who heads an organization cal
led Peace and justice Service, was chosen over 70
other nominees, including President Jimmy Car
ter, Pope John Paul 11, and two of the negotiators
of the Rhodesian peace, British Foreign Secretary
Lord Carrington and Zimbabwe Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe.
The prize carries a stipend of 880,000 Swedish
kronor, equivalent to $212,000.
New earthquake shocks Algeria
Al Asnam, Algeria — A new series of aftershocks
rumbled through Al Asnam yesterday, panicking
the terrified survivors of the earthquake that de-

vastated this city and hampering rescue efforts.
Some tremors registered as high as 5.0 on the
Richter scale and knocked down houses in a vil
lage to the south, but no injuries were reported.
For the tens of thousands of homeless in Al As
nam, the reminder of Friday's catastrophe was
enough to drive them from their tent camps in
terror.
Teams of workers using cranes and giant ear
thmovers pried apart the concrete and twisted
steel to save the injured and retrieve the dead.
The official count of bodies was 1600, but the
Algerian Red Crescent relief organization esti
mated 5000 to 20,000 dead. There was no govern
ment estimate, but some officials said there was
reason to hope the toll would be lower.
Algeria began a week of mourning for its dead
and the government declared the entire province
of Al Asnam, with more than a million inhabitants,
a disaster area. President Chadli Benjedid or
ganized emergency measures from a tent head
quarters in the city. More than a fifth of the popu
lation is believed to have been affected in some
way.
Boiler blast rocks day-care center
Atlanta — A thunderous explosion believed
caused by a faulty furnace boiler rocked an all
black day-care center in a low-income housing
project here yesterday, killing four preschool boys
and a woman teacher and injuring seven others.
The blast blew out an exterior wall that enclosed
a kitchen, a lunch room and a hallway in the mid
dle of the one-story building. It hurled yellow
bricks, chunks of concrete blocks and other debris
as far as 310 feet.
Mike Gill, 17, an unemployed high school drop
out who lives nearby, rushed to the scene and was
credited with rescuing three injured children and
a woman. He said that he saw some victims with
hands, legs and parts of their heads missing.
"There is nothing to indicate foul play," Public
Safety Commissioner Lee Brown told a news con
ference a few hours after the midmorning explo
sion. He said authorities will try to determine
exactly what caused the explosion in the natural
gas furnace.
Mayor Maynard jackson, a black, appeared at
the blast scene and used an electric bullhorn to
assure parents gathered there that "we will do
everything in our power to find the reason for this
explosion, which appears to be an accident. . . .
We will not rest until every stone is turned, every
leaf is turned and we expose every possible lead."
Despite these assurances, however, the explo
sion heightened fears of a black community that
has seen eight unsolved murders of black children
and six disappearances of black children in recent
months.
Athlete admissions found biased
Los Angeles — The University of Southern
California's powerful athletic department usurped
the authority of the admissions office and admit
ted 330 scholastically deficient athletes over the
past decade, a USC report disclosed yesterday.
The decision to admit the athletes was not sub
let to normal admissions office review and the
result was that few of the deficient students ever
graduated, the report signed by lames Zumberge,
USC's new president, said.
Admission of the "academically marginal
athletes" was "based chiefly on athletic prowess
as judged by the athletic department," the report
said.
"It was a system gone awry," Zumberge said.
He said he has instituted reforms that remove
the athletic department from any role in the ad

mission of students.
The USC report was based on the findings of
several faculty committees established by )ohn
Hubbard, Zumberge's predecessor.
Hubbard called for the investigation after it was
reported that more than 30 USC athletes were
enrolled in a speech class for which they were to
receive credit without attending.
Later, it was disclosed that three other track stars
were given credit for an extension class in which a
total of 30 athletes were enrolled but which few, if
any, attended, and that sprinter Billy Mullins
simultaneously attended four junior colleges in
the fall of 1977 to gain admittance to USC for the
1978 track season.
The disclosures triggered an investigation by the
Pacific-10 Conference and by the NCAA. As a re
sult of the Pac-10 inquest, USC was banned from
the 1981 Rose Bowl.
Toyota halts car shipments to U.S.
Toyuda City, Japan — Toyota Motor Co. has no
intention of restocking diminished inventories of
Toyota car dealers in the United States in the near
future, Eiji Toyoda, presidentof thecompany, told
the Los Angeles Times here yesterday.
In an interview, Toyoda denied any plan to vol
untarily restrain exports to the United States. But
by keeping stocks low, the company almost cer
tainly will restrict its U.S. sales. !t is the closest that
any Japanese auto executive has come to declaring
a change in attitude toward the U.S. market.
"The boom (in U.S. sales) for Japanese cars and
for Toyota cars has ended. That is the feeling I
get," Toyoda said flatly.
Toyota's car output remains high, but there are
some hints that it is decreasing. At one Toyota
assembly plant production is like to drop 11 per
cent next month from the present level.
