# Three Mile Island shutdown
## Pulitzer winner says operators to blame 
### Samuel Howe 
The shutdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant was "not a science story, but a plumb
ing story," according to Joel Shurkin, University
science writer and winner of the Pulitzer Prize for
his coverage of the incident.
"The machine was fine; it was people who were
the idiots," asserted Shurkin Friday. But he fell
short of saying the incident proved the safety of
nuclear power plants.
Shurkin was one of three lead writers of the
prize-winning team of the Philadelphia Inquirer
which covered the March 1979 shutdown near
Harrisburg Penn.
He spoke at the Palo Alto Unitarian Church, at
the invitation of the church's World Concerns
committee.
Shurkin called the accident "not a disaster —
nobody was hurt and nobody was killed — but a
potential disaster." Yet he sketched a dramatic
portrait of the sense of fright felt by those on the

scene of the story.
"I was not terrified, as in a war, but frightened,"
he said. Although detectors never showed that
anyone near the reactor received an excessive
dose of radiation, he said, uncertainty was still
present for many there. One-half ot the people in
the immediate area chose to evacuate the site.
He accused Metropolitan Edison, the utility
company which runs Three Mile Island, ot "lying
through its teeth, and lying quite deliberately.
"Nobody really knew what was going on for a
week, and much of it they still don't know." The
company claimed "things were under control, and
they weren't," said Shurkin.
What did happen, however, was that the reactor
functioned as it was designed to but was interfered
with by operators at the plant. "If people had done
nothing, we would never have heard of Three Mile
Island," he said.
Specifically, Shurkin maintained that a valve,
covered by a tag of paper referring to another

control, was opened but should have remained
closed.
This led to a chain of events by which there was a
buildup of hydrogen (referred to as a "hydrogen
bubble" in news accounts) in the core of the reac
tor. The bubble could have exploded and released
highly radioactive steam with devastating con
sequences if it had been mixed with a certain
combination of oxygen.
This did not happen, although Shurkin main
tains that even now the reasons are not fully un
derstood.
As a journalist, Shurkin said media coverage of
the incident, with few exceptions, was "one of our
finer moments . . . we certainly could have come
out with stories to scare three states. But we
didn't; we played it straight and tried to minimize
hysteria." Shurkin attributed this to an "indepen
dent consensus" among journalists covering the
incident.
He said the incident highlighted both the weak
nesses and strengths of nuclear power — the
major strength in this case being the machine's
functioning as it was supposed to and preventing
an accident.
The weakness, of course, was the human factor
— the unreliability of the operators of the
machine. Despite upgraded qualifications for
operators mandated after the incident, Shurkin
said that risk was ever-present.
Shurkin posed the question which he said any
society faces when dealing with issues such as
nuclear power: "Are the benefits substantially
outweighing the dangers?"
In a world of limited energy and disappearing
fossil fuels, he said, "nuclear power could provide
a non-polluting, efficient and inexpensive means
of providing energy," but he said the risks are
unlikely to be eliminated.
After leaving the Inquirer, Shurkin came to the
University in September 1979 as a professional
journal fellow. He became science writer for the
News and Publications service in June.
