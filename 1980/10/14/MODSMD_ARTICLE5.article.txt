# Sophomore seminar program offers small-class alternative
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
"Sophomore slump" may not be as prevalent at the
Farm this year if the new sophomore seminar prog
ram achieves its goal.
The program is aimed at helping sophomores de
termine where they're headed academically. To aid
those sophomores in the no-man's land of the "un
declared,'' 34 seminars are being offered this quarter
in everything from "Mathematical Modeling" to "The
Novel of Adultery." Enrollment in each is limited to
12.
Sophomore Dan Alder said he was attracted by the
small class size because it provides the experience of
getting to know a professor, and is a relief from large,
impersonal classes. He also said he likes the oppor
tunity to discuss with others a topic of mutual interest
and to feel comfortable expressing ideas and opin
ions.
Distribution requirements
The seminars fulfill the various distribution re
quirements, which is no surprise, considering all the
varied titles. Seminars meeting the technology re
quirement include "Breakthroughs and Inventions in
Science and Technology," "Nutrition: Fact and
Fancy," and "Gasohol, Farth Juices, and Energy From
Plants."
Social Science offerings include "Bioethics: Man
kind With Medicine, Morality and Mortality,"
"Energy Crisis," "The American Presidency in Con
temporary Context" and "Considerations About
Death."
In Humanities: "Masters of 20th Century Architec
ture," "The Meaning of Tragedy," and "A Survey of
Humor in 20th Century America," are representative.
A photography workshop, sculpture seminar and
Modern Dance class are also offered.
Instruc tors made proposals
All seminar instructors volunteered to teach
sophomores, according to Program Coordinator

Kathy Thoelecke. She said course proposals were
sent to all faculty holding positions of assistant pro
fessorandabove, and toall lecturers. Of thisgroup67
proposed to lead seminars — 34 forfall, 27 forwinter
and six for spring.
Thoelec ke said response has been overwhelming.
Of 450 spaces, all but 50 were filled at pre-registration
last spring. Another 130 students signed wait lists for
the especially popular courses.
Some who pre-registered for seminars last spring
didn't attend the first class in the fall, Thoelecke said.
This happened even more than she anticipated. At fall
registration, everyone expressing interest in a semi
nar was encouraged to attend the first class, even if it
appeared full.
Unlike freshman seminars, no registration for
winter and spring has been taken. Any sophomores
interested in future seminars should enroll during
advanced registration at the end of this quarter.
The sophomore program is the brainchild of Uni
versity Ombudsman John Goheen, who said he
hopes the program will be expanded next year.
Graduate school faculty
Another feature of the seminars is the opportunity
given graduate school faculty to teach under
graduates.
One such course, taught by Dr. David Stevenson,
assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical
School, is called "The Interrelation Between Mind
and Body in Human Disease."
In that course, Stevenson emphasizes critical think
ingand interpretive skills which he says are important
to anyone interested in medicine.
"A good physician practices comprehensive
medicine," said Stevenson. He takes full advantage
of available technology while treating a patient, but
he also examines life events affecting the patient's
health, said Stevenson.

termine where they're headed academically. To aid
those sophomores in the no-man's land of the "un
declared,'' 34 seminars are being offered this quarter
in everything from "Mathematical Modeling" to "The
Novel of Adultery." Enrollment in each is limited to
12.
Sophomore Dan Alder said he was attracted by the
small class size because it provides the experience of
getting to know a professor, and is a relief from large,
impersonal classes. He also said he likes the oppor
tunity to discuss with others a topic of mutual interest
and to feel comfortable expressing ideas and opin
ions.
Distribution requirements
The seminars fulfill the various distribution re
quirements, which is no surprise, considering all the
varied titles. Seminars meeting the technology re
quirement include "Breakthroughs and Inventions in
Science and Technology," "Nutrition: Fact and
Fancy," and "Gasohol, Farth Juices, and Energy From
Plants."
Social Science offerings include "Bioethics: Man
kind With Medicine, Morality and Mortality,"
"Energy Crisis," "The American Presidency in Con
temporary Context" and "Considerations About
Death."
In Humanities: "Masters of 20th Century Architec
ture," "The Meaning of Tragedy," and "A Survey of
Humor in 20th Century America," are representative.
A photography workshop, sculpture seminar and
Modern Dance class are also offered.
Instruc tors made proposals
All seminar instructors volunteered to teach
sophomores, according to Program Coordinator

Kathy Thoelecke. She said course proposals were
sent to all faculty holding positions of assistant pro
fessorandabove, and toall lecturers. Of thisgroup67
proposed to lead seminars — 34 forfall, 27 forwinter
and six for spring.
Thoelec ke said response has been overwhelming.
Of 450 spaces, all but 50 were filled at pre-registration
last spring. Another 130 students signed wait lists for
the especially popular courses.
Some who pre-registered for seminars last spring
didn't attend the first class in the fall, Thoelecke said.
This happened even more than she anticipated. At fall
registration, everyone expressing interest in a semi
nar was encouraged to attend the first class, even if it
appeared full.
Unlike freshman seminars, no registration for
winter and spring has been taken. Any sophomores
interested in future seminars should enroll during
advanced registration at the end of this quarter.
The sophomore program is the brainchild of Uni
versity Ombudsman John Goheen, who said he
hopes the program will be expanded next year.
Graduate school faculty
Another feature of the seminars is the opportunity
given graduate school faculty to teach under
graduates.
One such course, taught by Dr. David Stevenson,
assistant professor of pediatrics at the Medical
School, is called "The Interrelation Between Mind
and Body in Human Disease."
In that course, Stevenson emphasizes critical think
ingand interpretive skills which he says are important
to anyone interested in medicine.
"A good physician practices comprehensive
medicine," said Stevenson. He takes full advantage
of available technology while treating a patient, but
he also examines life events affecting the patient's
health, said Stevenson.
