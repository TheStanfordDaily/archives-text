# Afghan president to visit Moscow
## 
### Washington Post 
New Delhi — Afghan Presi
dent Babrak Karmal under
takes a . mission to Moscow
next week that diplomats here
and in Kabul believe is de
signed to give his embattled
regime an aura of legitimacy
on the eve of a series of in
ternational meetings in which
the Soviet invasion of Afghan
istan is sure to come up.
His trip comes, however, at
a time when rebel activity in
the capital city of Kabul is in
tensifying and the Afghan
army has disintegrated so bad
ly that it can carry only a min
imal share of the fighting.
Moreover, ambushes are
now occurring regularly on
the stretch of road leading
from Kabul to Sarobi, on the
important highway that goes
from the capital through
lalalabad and the Khyber Pass
into Pakistan. That Kabul-
Sarobi stretch, on the western
end of the highway, had been
considered safe until recently.
Nonetheless, according to
diplomatic sources here and in
Kabul, the Soviets are attempt
ing to give the impression that
all is well in Afghanistan by
inviting Karmal to Moscow at
this time.
"I assume that what they are
trying to do is give him a little
bit more exposure and legit
imacy. I think they are trying
to get it across that he is the
guy in charge, the leader of
the nation," said one diplomat

who keeps a close eye on
events in Afghanistan.
A diplomatic report re
ceived here Friday from Kabul
agreed with that analysis.
The Soviets have embarked
on a major diplomatic cam
paign to take Afghanistan oft the
agenda of diplomatic con
ferences and, if they do not
succeed in that, to at least have
the debate muted.
They are faced, however,
with a full-scale U.N. General
Assembly debate on Afghan
istan next month. Presently,
preliminary meetings to fix the
agenda of the Madrid con
ference on the Helsinki human
rights accord are stalled over,
among other issues, the im
plications of the Soviet in
vasion, and a non-aligned con
ference is scheduled for here
early next year at which some
nations are sure to bring up
the fate of Afghanistan — a
non-aligned country.
Aim to fix the image
The Soviet Union would like
to at least mute the debate on
Afghanistan at those meetings,
according to analysts here, and
it will be easier to achieve that
aim if they can fix an image of
Karmal as the leader of a
strong, independent state with
Soviet troops in merely to pro
tect it from outside in
terference.
To underscore that image,
Moscow and Kabul have in
tensified their attacks on the
United States, China and Paki

stan as aggressors in Afghan
istan.
Traditionally, the Soviets
have used international meet
ings to promote their objec
tives, but they have run into
growing opposition over their
late December invasion of Af
ghanistan. Even some fellow
communist states — including
Cuba and Romania — voted in
favor of a resolution that
among other matters called for
the Soviet withdrawal from Af
ghanistan at a meeting last
month in East Berlin of the
Interparliamentary Union.
And at a Commonwealth
Parliamentary Union meeting
in Lusaka, Zambia, this week,
India was the only country to
give any support to the Soviet
position, according to former
Indian Foreign Minister A. B.
Vajpayee. He said in an ac
count published Friday morn
ing in the Indian Express that
his delegation was "taunted"
for its stand by other nations,
who said Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi's government was
"underwriting the Soviet's
armed intervention" by not
condemning it.
Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev is scheduled to visit
New Delhi late next month,
reportedly to stiffen India's re
solve to keep the non-aligned
conference from taking too
harsh a stand on Afghanistan.
While India has said the So
viet troops should be

withdrawn, the Gandhi gov
ernment has insisted that Mos
cow's move into Afghanistan is
part of the big power rivalry
in the area, implying that
Russia was reacting to United
States activities.
Brezhnev is also expected to
see Karmal during his visit to
Moscow to emphasize the So
viet government's strong sup
port for him.
