## Thatcher's government tested Unrest spreads in Britain 
### Washington Post 
London — After nearly 18 months in office,
the testing time has come for Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and her conservative gov
ernment's monetarist, free-market strategy for
restructuring Britain's troubled mixed econo
my.
Skepticism about the Thatcher experiment
has grown recently. Her government has come
under increasing pressure to alter its course,
as a severe, still deepening recession forces
thousands more businesses to the wall and puts
tens of thousands more Britons out of work
each month.
Up to now, the government's policies have
painfully squeezed industry and its work force
while failing to hold down overall government
spending — just the opposite of what Thatcher
had set out to do.
Business leaders, backed by a growing
number of economists and conservative politi
cians and commentators, want the government
to ease the squeeze on industry by substantially
lowering the 16 percent minimum lending rate
and reducing business taxes.
Shared sacrifice
They also want government to share more
of the sacrifice of austerity by shedding more
employees and holding down raises as private
industry has already been forced to do. In the
past year, government pay raises averaging over
20 percent prevented Thatcher from keeping
government spending down as promised, de
spite cuts in the size of the civil service, welfare
state social services, housing, education and
industry subsidies.
A continuing large budget deficit has forced
the government to borrow much more heavily
than expected. That, plus unforeseen and ap
parently still unmastered technical problems,
have made it difficult for the government to
control the growth of Britain's money supply
— central to Thatcher's monetarist strategy.
The leadership council of the Confederation
of British Industries recently took the unusual
step of voting a well-publicized resolution ob
jecting "most strongly to the fact that the main
burden of the government's coun
terinflationary policies is being allowed to fall
on productive industry and those who work for
it."
"While the private sector is being squeezed
to get wages and prices down, pay in the public
sector has not not yet been brought under
control," said Dermot Glynn, the business

group s economic director, said.
Thatcher and her ministers are now de
termined to do everything they can short of
a formal wage policy to keep pay raises in both
government and industry well below the cur
rent 16 percent inflation rate in the coming
winter's round of bargaining. Thatcher earlier
believed that her tight money policies would
naturally produce lower prices and wages
without government interference.
It also risks a confrontation with labor unions,
whose leaders will meet with Thatcher next
week to complain about rising unemployment
and falling standards of living.
Potential unrest
They have warned of the potential this winter
for strikes, social unrest and unruly protests like
the one this past week by several thousand
union members, unemployed workers and
young people who heckled and jostled Con
servative delegates outside the party's annual
conference in Brighton.
Some business leaders and conservative poli
ticians are also worrying aloud that widespread
business failures and unemployment could
both damage the country's social fabric and
wipe out support for Thatcher's basic free
market approach, which they still believe Brit
ain needs.
The current unemployment rate of over 8
percent — more than 2 million Britons — is
easily the country's highest since the 1930s
depression. Britain's postwar welfare state, with
its government subsidies for business and na
tionalization of failing industries — a reaction
to the hardships of the depression — had
previously cushioned British industry and work
force alike against the kind of dislocation that
has been much more common in the United
States.
Recent opinion polls, economic statistics and
even some analyses of the country's mood by
conservative commentators who back
Thatcher's overall strategy depict the British
people as significantly worse off than when
Thatcher took office, somewhat bewildered by
what her government is trying to do, and impa
tient with its often harsh, unyielding rhetoric
of sacrifice for future rewards.
"Nothing can be more infuriating to those
who are without jobs than to hear words that
do not produce any action," Sir Raymond Pen
nock, president of the Confederation of British
Industries, said recently. "Deeds, not words, are
needed now."
