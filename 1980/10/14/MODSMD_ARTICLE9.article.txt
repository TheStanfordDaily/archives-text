# Terrorism continues in Philippines
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Manila, Philippines — Government se
curity officials braced for a new round of
bombings during the coming weekend
amid signs that the bombers have already
succeeded in hurting the Philippines' lu
crative tourist industry.
Police officials said they expected the
urban terrorists also to strike again in an
effort to sabotage a convention of Ameri
can travel agents scheduled to open here
Oct. 19.
The Philippines tourism ministry had
expected 6000 members of the American
Society of Travel Agents to attend the
convention. But only 4400 signed up and
that n umber began to dwindle after three
first-class hotels were bombed last week
end, injuring 12 people, five seriously.
A survey of Manila hotels indicated that
reservations had dropped from 10 percent
to 15 percent since the bombings started.
A self-styled "urban guerrilla" group
calling itself the April 6 Movement has
taken credit for all the bombings. The
group has vowed to overthrow the martial
law regime of President Ferdinand

Marcos.
The first bombings occurred Aug. 22.
Then there was a lull until Sept. 12, when
another round of bombs went off. One
explosion, in a suburban supermarket,
killed an American woman and injured 32
others. There was another lull until last
weekend.
In statements issued to foreign news
agencies, the bombers have claimed that
they gave at least 30 minutes' advance
warning of all the bombings and dis
claimed responsibility for deaths or in
juries.
The government has linked the bomb
ings to anti-Marcos dissidents living in the
United States, notably former Sen.
Benigno Aquino, Marcos' chief political
rival. The April 6 Movement says that
Aquino knew about its plans to wage
urban guerrilla warfare against the presi
dent but did not order the bombings.
Thus far, the government has done just
about everything possible to prevent the
bombings except to catch the bombers.
Marcos has decreed the death penalty for

bombers and ordered that the baggage
of all incoming tourists be checked for
explosives. Hotel security guards were ad
vised to use discretion so as not to offend
visitors.
Security precautions are not limited to
foreigners. All public buildings have
posted security guards. And in at least
some Manila schools, children have had
their lunch boxes checked for hidden
explosives.
Many cynical Manilans, who do not
trust their government or the controlled
Manila press, at first suspected that
Marcos was behind the bombings as an
excuse to continue martial law.
That attitude appeared to be changing
as the weight of the evidence indicated
that Marcos had a good deal to lose and
nothing to gain from the bombings.
"There is a lot of discontent in Manila,"
one Filipino newspaperman, said. "But
people are not so desperate that they are
willing to resort to violence. In fact, all
of us hate violence."
