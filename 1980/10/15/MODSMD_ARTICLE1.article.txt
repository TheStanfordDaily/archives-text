# Berg to share Nobel Prize in Chemistry for DNA research
## 
### Bradley Crystal 
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg, a
pioneer researcher in the field of re
combinant DNA and member of the
Medical School faculty since 1959. yes
terday was named co-winner of the
1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
Specifically, Berg was cited for
"fundamental studies of the
biochemistry of nucleic acids with
particular regard to recombinant
DNA ."by the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences.
Half of the $212.000 prize money will
go to Berg, while the other half will be
shared by co-recipients Dr. Walter
Gilbert of Harvard University and Dr.
Frederick Sanger of Cambridge Uni
versity in Great Britain.
Berg's award brings to ten the
number of Nobel laureates on the cur
rent Stanford faculty.

Berg learned of the award yester
day morning at 5:55, when his long
time friend and colleague Dr. Arthur
Kornberg, himself a Nobel laureate,
telephoned to deliver the news.
"Stunned is the best word I can use
to describe my reaction." Berg said at
a news conference yesterday.
Although Berg, a 54-year-old native
New Yorker, said "I don't think you
can be a scientist and not know that
there is a Nobel Prize," he added that
the potential for winning such an
award "is not the motivation for the
kind of work we do."
As Berg explains it. recombinant
DNA researchers seek "principally to
understand how genes (hereditary
material) are organized in our
chromosomes and how those genes
function."
"The breakthrough came fiveor six

years ago with the isolation of seg
ments of DNA Berg said
Initial fears of accidentally creat
ing "monster genes" that came with
the mid '70s breakthrough, however,
turned out to be unjustified according
to the pioneer.
Government research restrictions,
which have been eased greatly in the
ensuing years, "were far more str
ingent than was necessary at the
time," he said.
"Our own work has been centered
on using the genes that have been
isolated and reintroducing them into
the nucleus of living cells to under
stand how genes function in their
native environment."
His experiments are designed to ex
plore the chemistry and biology of
mamalian and human chromosomes
and hopefully to provide the basic
knowledge for the prevention, manag
ment and cure of herediatary dis
eases, according to a biographical
statement.
Berg said the goal of his research is
to acquire "a more profound and com
plete understanding of the molecular
characteristics of gene function "
As examples of the "immediate and
very practical" benefits of recombi
nant DNA study, which is sometimes
called gene-splicing, Berg cited the
isolation of specific genes capable of
producing human insulin and human
interferon.
Insulin is used in treating diabetics;
interferon, an anti-viral agent, may
have promising applications in cancer
therapy.
Berg said he is hopeful that recom
binant DNA study will lead to many in
dustrial applications "that will have
an enormous benefit to society."
But Berg warns against expecting
too much too soon, especially with re
spect to human gene therapy, or re
placing defective genes with normal
ones.
"1 myself think attempts to apply
gene therapy to human beings are pre
mature. I don't think we know nearly
enough to do it with any assurance of

success.
Looking into the future. Berg would
only go as far as to predict that "cer
tain moral and ethical questions will
have to he confronted "
Although Berg termed winning the
prize "delightful news" he later
pointed out the collective nature of his
research.
I think one has to recognize that
this is not a single individual's effort. I
am concerned that credit be given to
the students, colleagues and post
doctoral fellows who worked with
me." Berg said.

"fundamental studies of the
biochemistry of nucleic acids with
particular regard to recombinant
DNA ."by the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences.
Half of the $212.000 prize money will
go to Berg, while the other half will be
shared by co-recipients Dr. Walter
Gilbert of Harvard University and Dr.
Frederick Sanger of Cambridge Uni
versity in Great Britain.
Berg's award brings to ten the
number of Nobel laureates on the cur
rent Stanford faculty.

Berg learned of the award yester
day morning at 5:55, when his long
time friend and colleague Dr. Arthur
Kornberg, himself a Nobel laureate,
telephoned to deliver the news.
"Stunned is the best word I can use
to describe my reaction." Berg said at
a news conference yesterday.
Although Berg, a 54-year-old native
New Yorker, said "I don't think you
can be a scientist and not know that
there is a Nobel Prize," he added that
the potential for winning such an
award "is not the motivation for the
kind of work we do."
As Berg explains it. recombinant
DNA researchers seek "principally to
understand how genes (hereditary
material) are organized in our
chromosomes and how those genes
function."
"The breakthrough came fiveor six

years ago with the isolation of seg
ments of DNA Berg said
Initial fears of accidentally creat
ing "monster genes" that came with
the mid '70s breakthrough, however,
turned out to be unjustified according
to the pioneer.
Government research restrictions,
which have been eased greatly in the
ensuing years, "were far more str
ingent than was necessary at the
time," he said.
"Our own work has been centered
on using the genes that have been
isolated and reintroducing them into
the nucleus of living cells to under
stand how genes function in their
native environment."
His experiments are designed to ex
plore the chemistry and biology of
mamalian and human chromosomes
and hopefully to provide the basic
knowledge for the prevention, manag
ment and cure of herediatary dis
eases, according to a biographical
statement.
Berg said the goal of his research is
to acquire "a more profound and com
plete understanding of the molecular
characteristics of gene function "
As examples of the "immediate and
very practical" benefits of recombi
nant DNA study, which is sometimes
called gene-splicing, Berg cited the
isolation of specific genes capable of
producing human insulin and human
interferon.
Insulin is used in treating diabetics;
interferon, an anti-viral agent, may
have promising applications in cancer
therapy.
Berg said he is hopeful that recom
binant DNA study will lead to many in
dustrial applications "that will have
an enormous benefit to society."
But Berg warns against expecting
too much too soon, especially with re
spect to human gene therapy, or re
placing defective genes with normal
ones.
"1 myself think attempts to apply
gene therapy to human beings are pre
mature. I don't think we know nearly
enough to do it with any assurance of

success.
Looking into the future. Berg would
only go as far as to predict that "cer
tain moral and ethical questions will
have to he confronted "
Although Berg termed winning the
prize "delightful news" he later
pointed out the collective nature of his
research.
I think one has to recognize that
this is not a single individual's effort. I
am concerned that credit be given to
the students, colleagues and post
doctoral fellows who worked with
me." Berg said.

Stanford genetic researcher Paul Berg said he was "stunned" to learn
yesterday he had won this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry.
Biochemistry Prof. Paul Berg, a
pioneer researcher in the field of re
combinant DNA and member of the
Medical School faculty since 1959. yes
terday was named co-winner of the
1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry.
Specifically, Berg was cited for
"fundamental studies of the
biochemistry of nucleic acids with

of Sciences.
