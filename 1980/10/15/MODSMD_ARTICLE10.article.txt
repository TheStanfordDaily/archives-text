# Laotians fill Thai refugee camps
## 
### Washington Post 
I'don Refugee Camp, Thailand — Chil
dren cry in their mothers' arms. Cheap
plastic baggage is tossed atop buses and
stowed. As well-wishers throng the gates of
this refugee center. 114 Laotians are called
to board buses for Bangkok, the last stop
before resettlement in the United States and
other countries.
Engines start up just after sundown and
the all-night drive is underway. The scene is
repeated often in Thailand's seven camps
for Laotians: since 1975 over 140.000 Laotian
refugees have left Thailand for third coun
tries. United Nations figures show. About
105.000 are currently in the camps.
Though the Cambodian exodus has seized
the world's attention, the human flow from
Laos has also achieved rates rarely
matched in history.
Almost 10 percent of Laos' 3 million
citizens have left since the communist
Pathet Lao, with help from Vietnam, won
their 20-vear war against American-sup
ported governments in the capital, Vien
tiane.
Those who cross Laos' southern borders
usually make for Übon, a name well known
in towns and villages across the river. Built
originally as a bomb depot for the U.S. Air

Force, the camp now houses an estimated
15.000 Laotians.
War and political oppression at home
out many Laotians, in particular the Hmong
hill people who fill refugee camps north of
Übon. Armed in the 1960s by the U.S. Cen
tral Intelligence Agency, they are today the
target of repeated suppression drives by the
government if they stay in Laos.
Some of Übon's people — almost all are
lowlanders — left to avoid "seminar," the
euphemistic term for political reeducation
in remote camps. Since 1975. tens, perhaps
hundreds of thousands of people associated
with the U.S.-supported government have
been sent to seminar, where some die of
hardships and hunger.
But many lowlanders — no one knows how
many — leave more to escape unemploy
ment and poverty than the Pathet Lao.
News of resettlement programs (over
100.000 Laotians have entered the United
States since 1975) and free rice in Übon
draw people across the river who otherwise
would have stayed home. "Half of Asia
would move to the United States if given the
chance," says one refugee official.
In 1977, the Thai government briefly at
tempted to give new arrivals an eligibility
test to identify and eventually repatriate

such "economic refugees." But the pro
gram was soon abandoned following ad
verse publicity from reports that a number
of Laotians sent back had been shot.
Many U.S. refugee workers felt that their
government, because of its role in the Indo
china war. has a responsibility toward any
person who flees from Indochina. The
American embassy in Bangkok has general
ly pushed the Thai authorities to treat eve
ryone as refugees.
Resettlement is steadily clearing the
camps — Übon had close to 40.000 people
last year. But not everyone wants to go.
"That's the big question for the Thais."
says one refugee worker. "What to do with
people who won't go to third countries?"
Some are reluctant to leave the free food
and slow pace of the refugee lifestyle. Oth
ers have businesses in the camp or are in
volved with anti-communist guerrillas op
erating across the river.
Officials in Bangkok continue to hint that
Laotians who decline third country resettle
ment could be forcibly sent home. But for
the present, with the United Nations paying
most of the camps' bills, and Thailand en
joying world praise for its hospitality to ref
ugees, camps like Übon appear to be secure.
