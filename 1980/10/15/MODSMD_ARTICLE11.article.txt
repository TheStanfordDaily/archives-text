# Western Culture requirement brings mixed student reaction
## 
### Cindi Wheeler 
Freshmen don't have any
choice about the new Western
Culture requirement. For them,
it's as much a part of the Uni
versity as the red-tile roofs and
palm trees dotting the campus.
From the start, they've been
assured in Approaching Stan
ford that the new requirement
"grew out of the conviction that
the study of Western Culture
gives an important perspective
on the odd continuities and dis
continuities of the past."
But how does the average
freshman, who faces endless
lectures, massive reading as
signments, and two-hour dis
cussion sections, feel about the
Western Culture requirement?
Freshman Jacki Hiltz says
she doesn't mind the require
ment. "It's OK, because people
wouldn't take it otherwise."
Naomi Nagayo, who is en
thusiastic about her class
taught by Prof. A.E.
Raubitschek, says, "It's good
for the exposure — gives a good
background."
But other students hold op

posite views on the require
ment. Bettie Edmonds, a stu
dent in Great Works of Western
Culture, exclaims, "I think it's
asinine to take it for a year be
cause I already had it in high
school! Maybe for a quarter."
Other students voice the same
opinion — that perhaps the
courses should not be required
for a full year.
Any order is OK
Some students aren't aware
that, according to Prof. Ronald
Rebholtz, coordinator of the
great works series, "They can
take (required courses) in any
crazy order they like, as long as
they stay in sequence."
A spokesman for the Regis
trar's Office says that students'
records are checked before
graduation only to make sure
that the requirement has been
filled at some time during the
four years of study. In general,
however, advisers prefer that
students take their Western Cul
ture courses during their
freshman year.
Students complain that the
Western Culture requirement

also prevents taking courses
that interest them more. Max
Scheder says that as an engi
neering major he has to take
Western Culture in addition to
math, physics and English, and
says he feels "that's too much. I
could be taking something
else."
Raubitschek, of the Classics
Department, says the require
ment makes him "uneasy."
He says he worries about the
impact on the faculty. "It's a
problem to teach a required
course; you take too much for
granted. If a teacher is teaching
a course that is not required, he
and his assistants will be more
careful, conscious of the quali
ty. If the course is required, will
the teacher slip 9 On the other
hand, these courses are good!"
The real test, according to
Raubitschek, will be the stu
dents' evaluations of the
courses at the end of the year.
Wide variety available
In theory, students can
choose from seven different
areas of study: Great Works of
Western Culture, Europe from

the Middle Ages to the Present,
Western Texts Thought and Lit
erature, Ideas in Western Cul
ture, Major Texts in Western
Culture, Western Culture and
Technology and the Structured
Liberal Education program
However, as Raubitschek
points out, students may not get
their first choice of classes. If a
course offering fills, the admin
istration can shift the students
into their second or third choice
class, he savs.
Rebholz explains,
though, that the faculty will
scrutinize the courses carefully.
As the year progresses, faculty
members will visit classes and
assess student evaluations to
decide which courses should be
canceled to make room for new
ones.
This supervision is intended
to maintain the quality of the
courses. "I'm usually against
competition of this sort, but
here it may actually improve
the program," says Rebholtz.
Discussion emphasized
Raubitschek stresses that the
Western Culture program en

courages group discussion and
writing in addition to the read
ing and lectures He says that
students need to have a better
command of their language;
they should be able to speak
well, express themselves well,
and listen to their fellow stu
dents. "When the Western Cul
ture program was created, the
students emphasized listening,
talking, and no large lecture
classes," he adds.
Some courses offer more dis
cussion and less lecture time
per week than others In the dis
cussion sections, students have
more time to explore questions
and ideas with each other and
faculty members.
Student response to the sec
tions has so far been positive: "I
think once everyone gets
warmed up it will be great,"
comments Ellen Nurenberg.
One student complaint has
been the class workloads.
"Fourteen books should be
enough for a year! It's not going
to get us anywhere," exclaims
Richie Sobel. Another student,
Stacia Lewis, remarks that

"it's a lot of note taking and
books — not to mention that you
have 1000 years of history
crammed into a small amount
of time."
Usually, however, only sec
tions of each book are assigned
One professor explains that
there are those who would have
had students read, for example,
all of the Odyssey, all of the Il
iad, and all of the Bible, but
luckily for freshmen, a com
promise was achieved (The
books for each course are as
signed according to a "core"
list, with variations depending
on the course.)

Raubitschek says that prob
lems in the program will even
tually work themselves out, and
the success or failure of the new
requirement will show itself in
student and faculty evaluations.
For now, overwhelmed
freshmen face Stanford's
Western Culture Requirement
with mixed feelings, ranging
from those of Cathy Janus, who
says,"I think the course will be
interesting; it will make us
think about our past and where
we came from," — to Mark
Roberge, who remarks, "I
wouldn't know what I think of it
I get psvched-out every time I
get near the class."
