# Students like lenient 'stopping out' policy
## 
### Jay O'Connor 
If it can be said that getting into Stanford presents a
formidable challenge, students will be relieved to hear
that getting out, or at least "stopping out," is a far eas
ier process.
Stopping out — taking a temporary leave of absence
from the University to work, travel, study or reflect on
life — is gaining in popularity, and in recent years as
much as 25 percent of each class has stopped out from
school, according to a Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) publication. Stopping Out.
Most notable about the stopping out program here is
its simplicity. A student need not fill out any official
form or submit notification to the University after de
ciding to stop out; he simply does not register for the
following quarter.
The University maintains an open-door policy for un
dergraduates on good academic standing, says Sylvia
Castillo, assistant dean of student affairs. No time lim
it is placed upon students, who may return at the begin
ning of any quarter they wish. In extreme cases, some
students have waited up to four years before deciding to
resume their studies.
"Stanford is much more lenient (about stopping out)
than other schools," notes Castillo.
Students most commonly cite financial considera
tions and work internships as reasons for taking a leave
from school, according to various University adminis
trators involved in the stopping-out process.

Many students stop out to help pay for the rising cost
of tuition. Unexpected changes in financial circum
stances and the desire to keep from going too deeply
into debt may compel students to leave school and work
for a quarter or more.
An increasing number of students stop out because of
a particular job offer or internship opportunity. A tem
porary switch from academics to the working world
provides an opportunity to test a career interest.
In addition, with the current tightening of the job
market, it's becoming more and more important for a
young person to have his foot in the door of the business
world, reports Mary Wolf of the Student Employment
Office. "The student who gets some work experience
during school is ahead of the game," she says.
Goals uncertain
Beyond the concerns of finance and work op
portunities, there is a variety of other personal reasons
for stopping out.
Uncertainty about goals and impending life choices
affects many students in their decision to stop out.
Questions such as what major to choose, what to do af
ter graduation, and whether or not to go on to graduate
school cause students to take a leave'to think, explore
options and clarify goals.
Students also leave the University because of
sickness, family difficulties, travel opportunities and a
desire to take courses at another school. And probably
included in everyone's personal reasons for taking time

off is the need to get away from the demands and pres
sures of academics for awhile.
While the absence of any formal structure in Stan
ford's stopping out program greatly benefits students
in terms of flexibility, some University administrators
say they feel that the administration of the program is
too unstructured.
Six University offices handle different aspects of
stopping out, and no central office exists that coordi
nates the program. Overlapping may result, and Wolf
warns that "the student is confused about who (and
what office) to identify with."
Warnings necessary
While officially all that a student must do to stop out
is not register, there are several consequences of stop
ping out to be aware of before leaving.
All tuition loans are canceled immediately, and in
certain cases financial aid can be affected. Stopping out
does affect a student's chances of getting on-campus
housing. The CPPC provides counseling, workshops
and brochures for students considering stopping out.
Stopping out by no means provides a panacea for
guaranteeing a job after graduation, or for solving any
financial woes for the coming quarter, but most stu
dents report positive consequences from taking time
off. according to the booklet Stopping Out.
Counselors at the CPPC advise planning a specific
job or time schedule before leaving as the best means of
insuring a good experience when stopping out.
