# Engineers study major earthquake
## 
### Bill Beyda 
This past summer, while
many Americans were dealing
with a brutal heat wave, and
others continued to suffer from
the repeated eruptions of Mt. St.
Helens, two Stanford civil engi
neering professors journeyed to
Tangshan. China, to study the
site of a major natural disaster
which occurred there four years
ago.
James Gere and Haresh Shah,
specialists in structural engi
neering. were the first foreign
engineers to visit the city de
stroyed by an earthquake which
claimed the lives of almost a
quarter of a million people.
"Most of the Chinese build
ings were made of unreinforced
brick walls, not designed to re
sist seismic forces," explained
Shah.
Gere commented, "If we had
such an earthquake in the Bay
Area, perhaps we would lose
2000 or 3000 lives. In this area,
most buildings are made of rein
forced concrete steel, or wood."
Gere explained that such a
quake would cause damage on
campus, but that there would be
"no collapse of any buildings;

any injuries would probably re
suit from falling objects."
Shah said he feels that the
Chinese have come a long way in
rebuilding Tangshan In three
years, housing for 700.000 people
has been constructed. He
further commented that "their
building codes have now been
changed to keep pace with ours,
which have slowly evolved over
the years. For them, it was a
much more sudden change. Our
country is doing as well as any
one else in the world in building
earthquake resisting struc
tures "
Shah said that many of the
problems faced by Tangshan
would be faced by any city that
was quickly leveled. "Even
problems that are not obvious at
first, such as what to do with
thousands or even hundreds of
thousands of bodies, complicate
and further stall the process of
rebuilding and revitalizing the
community." he said.
Gere and Shah are co-direc
tors of the John A. Blume Earth
quake Engineering Center at
Stanford, which studies the de
sign of structures that can
withstand seismic forces.
