## Carter is wrong: Scrap SALT II, and show Soviets how we stand 
### 
One would have thought ten
months ago that the SALT II
Treaty was dead After the Sovi
ets invaded Afghanistan. Presi
dent Carter even "temporarily
withdrew" the treaty from Sen
ate consideration But now the
SALT II issue has been raised
again—in a context that tells us
much about the choice we will
make between Jimmy Carter
and Konald Reagan next month.
Reagan says that he would
scrap SALT II without even let
ting the Senate vote on the trea
ty. He would then strengthen
our forces before seeking new
arms limitations talks with the
Soviets He argues that the Sovi
ets will be much more inclined
to negotiate with us in good faith
if they know that we are build
ing up our arsenal.
Carter, of course, has jumped
to the attack He has accused
Reagan of "abandoning arms
control policies which have ben
supported by every Democratic
president since Harry Truman
and every Republican president
since Dwight Eisenhower."
Carter suggests that he will
try to bring the SALT II treaty
up for consideration again in the
lame-duck session of Congress
following the election. At the
same time, his campaign ads
describe him as "respected
around the world as a man of
peace."
What is the truth here?
In accusing Reagan of aban
doning this country's arms con
trol policies. Carter makes a
very poor reading of the history.
In fact, it is Carter who has
failed to grasp the most basic
lessons of negotiating with the
Soviets.
John Kennedy said, "Let us
never negotiate out of fear, but
let us never fear to negotiate."
While we need not demand
clear-cut superiority over the

Soviets in nuclear weapons,
neither can we tolerate in
feriority. Negotiation from a
position of strength must be the
keystone to our arms limita
tions policies. There is no other
way.
Before we had an ABM pro
gram, President Johnson sug
gested to Soviet Premier
Kosvgin that both sides re
nounce ABMs Kosvgin dis
missed the idea as ridiculous
But after 1970. when the Nixon
administration won con
gressional approval of an ABM,
according to Henry Kissinger,
the Soviet SALT negotiators
"refused to discuss any subject
except ABM."
Now Carter has abandoned
the B-l bomber program,
slowed down the Trident pro
gram and stretched out the MX
missile program. He has ad
vertised the "stealth" bomber.
But it probably will no longer be
invisible to Soviet radar by the
time it comes into full prod
uction—some four years from
now. All this with what result?
The Soviets have not slowed
down their arms build-up. The
Soviets will not slow down their
arms build-up until we make a
credible showing that we realize
the need to be strong, and that
we have the determination to do
whatever is necessary to match
them.
Carter, meanwhile, clings to
a perverse, legalistic notion
that. once we ratify SALT 11. the
paper document itself will stop
the Soviets. It simply isn't so.
By suggesting that the treaty
should be raised for considera
tion again soon. Carter shows
that he thinks it a good agree
ment In fact, even if the Soviets
would abide by the terms of
SALT 11. the treaty would still
be to our gross disadvantage. It
would ratify the Soviet gains,
and only insure our inferiority.
According to former SALT

negotiator Edward Rownv. the
SALT II treaty is unequal in
three major respects. First, it
grants to the Soviets a unilat
eral right to 308 heavy missile
launchers. Soviet heavy mis
siles alone have more destruc
tive potential than all our in
tercontinental and submarine
based missiles combined
Second, the treaty allows the
Soviets to have—but not count
some 275 intercontinental
Backfire bombers. These add an
additional one-third to the total
destructive potential of the So
viet arsenal.
Third, the treaty does not es
tablish equal levels of forces.
Rather, it lumps weapons of
grossly disparate accuracies
and destructive powers togeth
er. and counts equal numbers as
equal levels of force. Clearly.
SALT II should be rejected on
its own merits.
Perhaps saddest of all. how
ever. is Carter's claim that he is
respected as a man of peace. In
fact, our allies have never been
more distraught with us. and
our enemies never more con
temptuous.
West German Chancellor
Brandt has privately wept over
Carter's weakness and waver
ing And yet we remain without
meaningful military options to
protect Western interests in the
next big threat to our security ;
the war in the Middle East.
What can we conclude? On
this issue at least. Ronald Re
agan is correct: SALT II must
be scrapped, both to show the
Soviets our determination, and
on its merits. A vote for Reagan
would at least replace a weak
president with one who has a vi
sion of a stronger and safer
Western world.
