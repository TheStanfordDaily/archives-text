An article concerning the cur
rent series of programs entitled
"A World in Crisis" (the Daily,
September 30) quotes Ronald
Hilton as asserting that "the
structure of the University does
not encourage serious study of
international affairs."
Precisely what that
statement is supposed to mean
is not clear to me. It is scarcely
a secret that, with the fullest
support of the University, the
International Relations pro
gram has been growing vigor
ously It has an outstanding fac
ulty and a growing number of
majors, who are indeed in
volved in "serious study of in
ternational affairs."
Perhaps Mr. Hilton means to
say that he finds rather little
sympathy for his own views on
world affairs, but that is a dif
ferent matter altogether.
1 might add that, while it uses
a Stanford address, the Califor
nia Institute of International

Studies, which sponsors the
series of programs Mr. Hilton
chairs, has no connection with
this University.

Kaplan co-op?
During the last several days, I
have been overhearing talk
about a three hour initiation test
into the world of "pro
fessionalism."
"How did the exam go on Sat
urday?"
"Oh. pretty well."
"Did you take the Stanley
Kaplan course?"
"Yeah, it really helped a lot."
"Wasn't it expensive?"
"Well . . . compared to Law
School, the several hundred
dollars is a small investment.
And besides, the money is com
ing out of my trust fund."
Test preparatory organiza
tions are doing a fantastic job at

exploiting the future "ex
ploiters" of America! Mr.
Kaplan is simply pulling in the
bread by manipulating the am
bitions of college students.
The Stanford-in-Law, Biz,
and Medicine organizations
should be providing their mem
bers with test services at fees
substantially lower than the
commercial market. By tapping
the expertise of veteran test
takers, the courses would pro
vide Stanford's undergraduate
population much more self-suf
ficiency. Let's pool our re
sources and make our own
Kaplan co-op.

Special events
You say that ASSU Special
Events lost ninety thousand
bucks? Oh well, that's enter
tainment. Come to think of it,
what is entertainment? Perhaps
it's a biochemical communica
tion of good vibes. Looks like
Special Events wasn't com
municating.
Around here you can sell out
Milton Friedman but you can't
make any money on the Knack.
Everything is a gamble, but in
the entertainment business
those who communicate make
the best bet. For example,
Chaparral plans to bring live co
medians to campus. Will we the
audience buy it. or will it be just
another joke? Either way,
that's entertainment.

On October 5, the New York
Times reported that, as the re
sult of a Supreme Court ruling in
the case of the Thor Power Tool
Company v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, the IRS has
ruled also that the valuation of
book inventories by publishers
could not be reduced for tax
purposes.
Unless the Congress passes
legislation exempting pub
lishers from this IRS ruling, it is
argued that publishers will be
come increasingly reluctant to
sign contracts for slower mov
ing noncommercial and scholar
ly books, existing titles will go
out of print more rapidly, and
finally publishers will tend to
order smaller first printings
and fewer second printings.

Reportedly, publishers are
more rapidly disposing of mil
lions of books in their inven
tories through remainder out
lets and are actually having
them turned into pulp!
The implications of the Thor
Power Tool ruling on education
are staggering, and yet to my
knowledge not a word has been
said in this paper or in public by
our administrators. Senator
Movnihan has indicated he
would propose legislation in the
next Congressional session ex
empting commercial publishers
from what has come to be called
an inventory tax.
I urge President Donald Ken
nedy to speak out on this prob
lem and to rally other university
presidents to the support of leg
islation exampting commercial
publishers from the Thor Power
Ruling. Faculty and students
should write to Congressman
McCloskey and Senators
Cranston and Kayakawa to
either sponsor or support re
medial action.

For those of you curse the
Transition, shun the Coffee
House, and generally ignore En
cina Station, I have great news.
Major renovations to Tresidder
dining facilities are on the way.
Tresidder has allocated
$100,000 in its 1980-81 budget to
general improvement of our
campus union's eating facilties
and is currently inviting com
munity input into the direction
and nature of those changes.
The Transition is slated for a
major portion of these renova
tions, and New Year vows of
physical changes to the struc
ture are enhanced by exciting
talk of a name change as well.
For those of you who think
that we've been in a "transi
tion" long enough, now is the
time to speak up. In each of the
eateries is a suggestion box into
which community members are
invited to toss their most
caustic, candid, or careful re
marks about needed renpva
tions.

For those of you curse the
Transition, shun the Coffee
House, and generally ignore En
cina Station, I have great news.
Major renovations to Tresidder
dining facilities are on the way.
Tresidder has allocated
$100,000 in its 1980-81 budget to
general improvement of our
campus union's eating facilties
and is currently inviting com
munity input into the direction
and nature of those changes.
The Transition is slated for a
major portion of these renova
tions, and New Year vows of
physical changes to the struc
ture are enhanced by exciting
talk of a name change as well.
For those of you who think
that we've been in a "transi
tion" long enough, now is the
time to speak up. In each of the
eateries is a suggestion box into
which community members are
invited to toss their most
caustic, candid, or careful re
marks about needed renpva

An article concerning the cur
rent series of programs entitled
"A World in Crisis" (the Daily,
September 30) quotes Ronald
Hilton as asserting that "the
structure of the University does
not encourage serious study of
international affairs."
Precisely what that
statement is supposed to mean
is not clear to me. It is scarcely
a secret that, with the fullest
support of the University, the
International Relations pro
gram has been growing vigor
ously It has an outstanding fac
ulty and a growing number of
majors, who are indeed in
volved in "serious study of in
ternational affairs."
Perhaps Mr. Hilton means to
say that he finds rather little
sympathy for his own views on
world affairs, but that is a dif
ferent matter altogether.
1 might add that, while it uses
a Stanford address, the Califor
nia Institute of International

Studies, which sponsors the
series of programs Mr. Hilton
chairs, has no connection with
this University.

Kaplan co-op?
During the last several days, I
have been overhearing talk
about a three hour initiation test
into the world of "pro
fessionalism."
"How did the exam go on Sat
urday?"
"Oh. pretty well."
"Did you take the Stanley
Kaplan course?"
"Yeah, it really helped a lot."
"Wasn't it expensive?"
"Well . . . compared to Law
School, the several hundred
dollars is a small investment.
And besides, the money is com
ing out of my trust fund."
Test preparatory organiza
tions are doing a fantastic job at

exploiting the future "ex
ploiters" of America! Mr.
Kaplan is simply pulling in the
bread by manipulating the am
bitions of college students.
The Stanford-in-Law, Biz,
and Medicine organizations
should be providing their mem
bers with test services at fees
substantially lower than the
commercial market. By tapping
the expertise of veteran test
takers, the courses would pro
vide Stanford's undergraduate
population much more self-suf
ficiency. Let's pool our re
sources and make our own
Kaplan co-op.

Special events
You say that ASSU Special

bucks? Oh well, that's enter

what is entertainment? Perhaps
it's a biochemical communica

Special Events wasn't com
municating.
Around here you can sell out
Milton Friedman but you can't
make any money on the Knack.
Everything is a gamble, but in
the entertainment business
those who communicate make
the best bet. For example,
Chaparral plans to bring live co

audience buy it. or will it be just
another joke? Either way,
that's entertainment.

On October 5, the New York
Times reported that, as the re
sult of a Supreme Court ruling in
the case of the Thor Power Tool
Company v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, the IRS has
ruled also that the valuation of
book inventories by publishers
could not be reduced for tax
purposes.
Unless the Congress passes
legislation exempting pub
lishers from this IRS ruling, it is
argued that publishers will be
come increasingly reluctant to
sign contracts for slower mov
ing noncommercial and scholar
ly books, existing titles will go
out of print more rapidly, and
finally publishers will tend to
order smaller first printings
and fewer second printings.

Reportedly, publishers are
more rapidly disposing of mil
lions of books in their inven
tories through remainder out
lets and are actually having
them turned into pulp!
