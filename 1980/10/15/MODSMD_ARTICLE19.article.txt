## Evaluations not just poison pens 
### 
In the Campus Report (the
Daily, October 10). Prof. Ralph
S. Phillips was quoted from an
informal speech before the Fac
ulty Senate as recommending a
halt to the student evaluations
of teaching at Stanford. I feel
that Prof. Phillips was offering
a rather rash solution to an un
comfortable situation.
Freshmen have been in
troduced to the ASSU Course
Guide but may not be aware that
it is the result of multiple-choice
questionnaires handed out the
last lecture of each quarter. Stu
dents rate their courses and in
structors from one (the pits) to
seven (god-like) in areas of ov
erall planning, fairness in tes
ting. quality of lectures, gener
ally how "good" the class and
the professor seemed to them.

Students can also write com
ments on the back directed to
the professor or to students tak
ing the course after them.
Prof. Phillips recommended
ending the ASSU evaluations,
saying that they have little to do
with actual teaching, can
"poison" teacher/student rela
tionships and that they are a
"public relations gimmick." He
was also concerned with the em
phasis the administration
placed on the surveys.
I'll agree with Prof. Phillips
to the extent that the eval
uations do not fulfill their ul
timate purpose, that of provid
ing professors with a mirror for
judging their effectiveness and
giving students an opportunity
to choose courses from an in
formed position.
The evaluations are not un
biased. Poison pens are often
put to use on that last Friday
and even some of my own eval
uations would have been more
appropriately printed on
asbestos. But to discontinue the
program because it has faults
would be throwing out the baby
with the bathwater. If both the
students and the faculty shift
their views of the evaluations,
they could become an effective
avenue of communication.

The students must make their
comments more constructive
and less vindictive, and the fac
ulty need to develop thicker
skins as well as a desire to know
the areas they might improve.
Delicate relationship
Instead of "poisoning" the
"delicate relationship" be
tween teacher and student, the
evaluations would help relieve
part of the vacuum that exists
between a professor speaking in
front of a blackboard and the sea
of faces staring back.
How can a teacher know when
he's getting through to his stu
dents unless they tell him?
Some might say that per
formance on tests is an accurate
measure but just because some
one is present while I'm learn
ing doesn't necessarily mean
he's teaching me.
Professors should look at the
evaluations as one more way,
but not the only way, of seeing
things from the students' point
of view. Students in turn should
use them as a means of making
changes for the better in a situ
ation where they have little con
trol.
The student evaluations do
fall short of the mark in that the
aim of teaching is not main
taining happy students but

training young minds and trans
mitting the desire to learn. To
be entertained is not a reason to
enter a university. Often the
classes that give us the most ag
gravation prove to be the most
worthwhile.
The evaluations can't assess a
situation as complex as a
classroom merely using a scale
from one to seven. Yet student
opinions shouldn't be given the
heave-ho simply because they
come from students.
The evaluations will never be
the sole reason for a loss of
tenure because the adminis
tration realizes their extreme
subjectivity. The University de
partments will always have
their own methods of faculty
selection and self-appraisal, re
gardless of any undergraduate
surveys. In the final analysis,
while students do not run the
University, we are the Univer
sity. To cut out our collected
voice without pressing reasons
would be irresponsible, a denial
that the University exists to
benefit its students. That
purpose cannot be fulfilled
without two-way communica
tion, an exchange of which the
student evaluations are a part.
