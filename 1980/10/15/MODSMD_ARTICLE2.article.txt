# Storey House rebuilding also okayed
## Trustees approve new dorm project 
### Joan O'Connell 
Approval by the board of trustees
of a $33,923,000 project budget for a
new student housing facility will re
sult in a 2.5 percent increase in room
and board rates for next year above
the projected rate increase without
the facility, a forecast report to the
board states. That figure will rise to
3.5 percent in 1983.
Yesterday the board approved
both the budget and design of an 800-
student housing unit to be built on
Santa Teresa Street near Lake
Lagunita which is expected to begin
housing students by October 1982
While the projected annual in
creases in room and board rates will
exceed project rate increases
without the facility, by 1987 costs
will "flatten" somewhat, according
to William Massy, vice president for
business and finance. But by 1987,
said Massy, payments will begin to
drop and operating reserves will be
replenished and there will be in
creased revenues generated by more
students paying into the housing sys
tem.
This will bring the net increase to 1
percent below the growth rate
without the facility, explained Assis
tant Vice President for Public Af
fairs, Bob Freelen.
''Of course, that doesn't help the
students here now who must suffer
the increase." Freelen said.
In several other budget-related
approvals, the board also approved
an additional $4 million investment
in the faculty coinvestment mort
gage program.
"The program is a success and has

helped 43 faculty obtain housing in
this area." a report to the board
stated. "Action is sought now in an
ticipation of faculty recruiting ef
forts in the months ahead," it said.
The Stanford Daily also benefited
from a board action as a 36-month
loan at 12 percent interest was ap
proved and will assist the Stanford
Daily Publishing Corporation in its
acquisition of computer typesetting
and editing equipment.
The loan of $130,000 will im
mediately fund about 85 percent of
the system's $155,000 cost. Although
the Daily originally requested an in
ternal advance which would have
provided the funding at a lower in
terest rate, the board did not ap
prove the request because of the in
dependent legal status of the
Daily," explained FYeelen.
A reconstruction budget of $1.5
million has also been authorized to
fund the rebuilding of Storey House
which was damaged by fire last
March. The approved design pro-

vides for increased occupancy,
pushing the total number of resi
dents from 39 to 44, plus special ac
cess for the physically handicapped.
Plans also call for a "coeducational"
facility.
The board also approved the space
program and design of the Carl F.
Braun Music Center. Prepared by
Marquis Associates, plans call for a
two-storv building with a total of
23,390 square feet of space. It will
feature administrative offices,
classrooms, faculty offices, re
hearsal space and a music library as
well as a large portal through which
camnus traffic can pass through
Lasuen Mall, across which the facil
ty spans. Costs are anticipated at ap
proximately $6.3 million, with con
struction expected to be completed

by October 1982.
Freelen said another highlight to
the board's meeting was the ap
pearance of Prof Paul Berg. who. it
was announced yesterday morning,
has been named as aco-recipient of
this year's Nobel Prize for
chemistry. A videotape of Berg's
morning news conference yesterday
was brought into the meeting in
Stauffer Auditorium, and Berg was
introduced to each of the trustees by
President Donald Kennedy
The board's October meeting
capped off a busy three days for
board members, as most of them ap
peared it Dmald Kennedy's in
auguration last Sunday, toured the
Medical Center Monday and at
tended a party Monday evening in
Roble Gvmnasium.

President Donald Kennedy
The board's October meeting
capped off a busy three days for
board members, as most of them ap
peared it Dmald Kennedy's in
auguration last Sunday, toured the
Medical Center Monday and at
tended a party Monday evening in
Roble Gvmnasium.
Approval by the board of trustees
of a $33,923,000 project budget for a
new student housing facility will re
sult in a 2.5 percent increase in room
and board rates for next year above
the projected rate increase without
the facility, a forecast report to the
board states. That figure will rise to
3.5 percent in 1983.
Yesterday the board approved
both the budget and design of an 800-
student housing unit to be built on
Santa Teresa Street near Lake
Lagunita which is expected to begin
housing students by October 1982
While the projected annual in
creases in room and board rates will
exceed project rate increases
without the facility, by 1987 costs
will "flatten" somewhat, according
to William Massy, vice president for
business and finance. But by 1987,
said Massy, payments will begin to
drop and operating reserves will be
replenished and there will be in
creased revenues generated by more
students paying into the housing sys
tem.
This will bring the net increase to 1
percent below the growth rate
without the facility, explained Assis
tant Vice President for Public Af
fairs, Bob Freelen.
''Of course, that doesn't help the
students here now who must suffer
the increase." Freelen said.
In several other budget-related
approvals, the board also approved
an additional $4 million investment
in the faculty coinvestment mort
gage program.
"The program is a success and has

helped 43 faculty obtain housing in
this area." a report to the board
stated. "Action is sought now in an
ticipation of faculty recruiting ef
forts in the months ahead," it said.
The Stanford Daily also benefited
from a board action as a 36-month
loan at 12 percent interest was ap
proved and will assist the Stanford
Daily Publishing Corporation in its
acquisition of computer typesetting
and editing equipment.
The loan of $130,000 will im
mediately fund about 85 percent of
the system's $155,000 cost. Although
the Daily originally requested an in
ternal advance which would have
provided the funding at a lower in
terest rate, the board did not ap
prove the request because of the in
dependent legal status of the
Daily," explained FYeelen.
A reconstruction budget of $1.5
million has also been authorized to
fund the rebuilding of Storey House
which was damaged by fire last
March. The approved design pro-

vides for increased occupancy,
pushing the total number of resi
dents from 39 to 44, plus special ac
cess for the physically handicapped.
Plans also call for a "coeducational"
facility.
The board also approved the space
program and design of the Carl F.
Braun Music Center. Prepared by
Marquis Associates, plans call for a
two-storv building with a total of
23,390 square feet of space. It will
feature administrative offices,
classrooms, faculty offices, re
hearsal space and a music library as
well as a large portal through which
camnus traffic can pass through
Lasuen Mall, across which the facil
ty spans. Costs are anticipated at ap
proximately $6.3 million, with con
struction expected to be completed

by October 1982.
Freelen said another highlight to
the board's meeting was the ap
pearance of Prof Paul Berg. who. it
was announced yesterday morning,
has been named as aco-recipient of
this year's Nobel Prize for
chemistry. A videotape of Berg's
morning news conference yesterday
was brought into the meeting in
Stauffer Auditorium, and Berg was
introduced to each of the trustees by
President Donald Kennedy
