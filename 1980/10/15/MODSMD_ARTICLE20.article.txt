## To set the record straight 
### 
A recent article In the Daily
describes the problems that the
Theta XI fraternity is facing
meeting its housing quota as a
result of a poor rush last spring.
The subtitle above the headline
read "JO Former Donnerites
Fleece Frat." As a member of
this group, I feel obliged to re
spond.
The article describes how
Theta Xi's rush was ruined
when, at the last minute, our
group of twenty students backed
out of an informal agreement to
join the fraternity. The story
puts the full blame for the
missed quota on our group and
even mentions that the Univer
sity housing regulations were
bent because of our actions.
The Daily quotes two sources
in its article, the rush chairman
of Theta Xi and the only mem
ber of our group to join the
fraternity. It seems strange
that the Daily would run a head
line story concerning two
groups without consulting both.
Since the Daily decided to ig
nore our side of the story, my
purpose here is to set the record
straight. Our reason for putting
together a group to join Theta Xi
was simple. We saw a fraternity
which had been on a downhill
slide for a number of years and
we wanted to bring in a new
group of people, hoping that we
could somehow revitalize the

house. Theta Xi realized the
need for such a facelift and
agreed to accept our group, an
all or nothing deal.
Theta Xi has had problems
with the housing quota in the
past and last year was no excep
tion. Besides our group, Theta
Xi could find only three other
students who were interested in
receiving bids.
Because of space limitations
when our group was included,
they could only offer a bid to one
of the three. The Daily's
statement that "Theta Xi was
taking a big chance in issuing so
many bids to one group" ob
viously stretches the facts. If
our group had not offered to
join. Theta Xi would still have
missed their quota, and by a
large margin no doubt.
The major flaw in the Daily
story was that it ignored why
our group did not accept the
bids. Some people left our group
for other fraternities ad others
reconsidered after doing well in
the housing draw. However, had
it not been for Theta Xi's in
famous bid party, there would
be a group of Donnerites living
there right now.
Rather than trying to make a
favorable impression on us, the
Xi members seemed intent on
scaring us away. We were
treated to some of the most dis
gusting porn movies imaginable

and then, rather than tactfully
asking the group as a whole for
their signatures, we were es
corted. one by one, upstairs
where several Xi members
were waiting.
Extolling the benefits of join
ing Theta Xi. they repeatedly
asked that we sign pledge cards.
Peer pressure? It is no wonder
that half our group decided that
night that they could not possi
bly join Theta Xi.
Those who were still willing
to join decided that a group of at
least 15 was needed to make any
considerable changes. Un
fortunately, we did not have
enough time to round up any
new recruits.
We regret that we were un
able to help Theta Xi reach its
quota; however, we are not will
ing to take all the blame. Rather
than pointing.their finger at our
group as the cause of all their
troubles. I suggest that the
Theta Xi fraternity look toward
its own organization as the real
cause of their failure.
In the future, I would hope
that the Daily would refrain
from printing stories without
checking all of the sources. Lu
dicrous titles, such as "20
Former Donnerites Fleece
Frat," are sensationalist and
unnecessary. (Douglas Holt is
an undeclared sophmore.)

they could only offer a bid to one
of the three. The Daily's
statement that "Theta Xi was
taking a big chance in issuing so
many bids to one group" ob
viously stretches the facts. If
our group had not offered to
join. Theta Xi would still have
missed their quota, and by a
large margin no doubt.
The major flaw in the Daily
story was that it ignored why
our group did not accept the
bids. Some people left our group
for other fraternities ad others
reconsidered after doing well in
the housing draw. However, had
it not been for Theta Xi's in
famous bid party, there would
be a group of Donnerites living
there right now.
Rather than trying to make a
favorable impression on us, the
Xi members seemed intent on
scaring us away. We were
treated to some of the most dis
gusting porn movies imaginable

and then, rather than tactfully
asking the group as a whole for
their signatures, we were es
corted. one by one, upstairs
where several Xi members
were waiting.
Extolling the benefits of join
ing Theta Xi. they repeatedly
asked that we sign pledge cards.
Peer pressure? It is no wonder
that half our group decided that
night that they could not possi
bly join Theta Xi.
Those who were still willing
to join decided that a group of at
least 15 was needed to make any
considerable changes. Un
fortunately, we did not have
enough time to round up any
new recruits.
We regret that we were un
able to help Theta Xi reach its
quota; however, we are not will
ing to take all the blame. Rather
than pointing.their finger at our
group as the cause of all their
troubles. I suggest that the
Theta Xi fraternity look toward
its own organization as the real
cause of their failure.
In the future, I would hope
that the Daily would refrain
from printing stories without
checking all of the sources. Lu
dicrous titles, such as "20
Former Donnerites Fleece
Frat," are sensationalist and
unnecessary. (Douglas Holt is
an undeclared sophmore.)
A recent article In the Daily
describes the problems that the
Theta XI fraternity is facing
meeting its housing quota as a
result of a poor rush last spring.
The subtitle above the headline
read "JO Former Donnerites
Fleece Frat." As a member of
this group, I feel obliged to re
spond.
The article describes how
Theta Xi's rush was ruined
when, at the last minute, our
group of twenty students backed
out of an informal agreement to
join the fraternity. The story
puts the full blame for the
missed quota on our group and
even mentions that the Univer
sity housing regulations were
bent because of our actions.
The Daily quotes two sources
in its article, the rush chairman
of Theta Xi and the only mem
ber of our group to join the
fraternity. It seems strange
that the Daily would run a head
line story concerning two
groups without consulting both.
Since the Daily decided to ig
nore our side of the story, my
purpose here is to set the record
straight. Our reason for putting
together a group to join Theta Xi
was simple. We saw a fraternity
which had been on a downhill
slide for a number of years and
we wanted to bring in a new
group of people, hoping that we
could somehow revitalize the

house. Theta Xi realized the
need for such a facelift and
agreed to accept our group, an
all or nothing deal.
Theta Xi has had problems
with the housing quota in the
past and last year was no excep
tion. Besides our group, Theta
Xi could find only three other
students who were interested in
receiving bids.
Because of space limitations
when our group was included,
they could only offer a bid to one
of the three. The Daily's
statement that "Theta Xi was
taking a big chance in issuing so
many bids to one group" ob
viously stretches the facts. If
our group had not offered to
join. Theta Xi would still have
missed their quota, and by a
large margin no doubt.

our group did not accept the
