## Working women rally for equal worth 
### Washington Post 
Chicago — In the 19705, work
ing women pushed for the right
to equal employment opportuni
ty. In the next decade, feminists
may rally around the concept of
"comparable worth" — the
closing of the gap between
wages paid for typical "men's
work" and stereotyped "wom
en's jobs."
That was the message law
yers and women's rights ad
vocates brought to nearly 600
women at a conference here last
weekend sponsored by the Chi
cago-based Women Employed
Institute.
Industry is taking advantage
of a new class of cheap labor —
women who have entered the
work force in the past decade —
by not letting their level of
wages rise, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, head of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission told the conference.
"Men who sweep floors" make
more than assembly-line wom
en and female stenographers in
some factories, she said.

Women — who account for 42
percent of the work force — to
day earn 59 cents for every $1
men earn, government
statistics show. Twenty-five
years ago, it was 64 cents for
every $1.
Focal issue
"The undervaluing of jobs
held by women is a focal issue in
trying to achieve equal op
portunity," said Mary
Schaafsman. a Women Em
ployed board member. While
advocates believe the Equal
Pay Act eventually can be ex
panded to include comparable
worth, they acknowledged that
the concept will take time to
press into the consciousness of
judges, legislators, unions and
the public.
The Supreme Court recently
refused to hear an appeal of a
case that upheld the right of
Denver to pay city hospital
nurses less than it paid park
maintenance workers. The
judge in that case had said that
raising the salaries of women
whose jobs were found to be un

dervalued would "disrupt the
economic system of the U S A
and its way of life," one lawyer
told the conference.
Office workers' rights
Women Employed was or
ganized seven years ago to press
for the rights of office workers
in the Chicago business Loop
and has since gone national. It
claims 1000 members here and
2000 in its Women Employed Ad
vocates lobbying network
across the country.
The organization helped in
itiate the federal government's
first employment discrimina
tion case against a federally
chartered lender. Harris Bank
& Trust of Chicago. An adminis
trative law judge's decision in
that case — regarded as the test
case for the banking industry —
is pending.
Yet in another major decision
recently, the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadel
phia ruled that Westinghouse
Electric Corp. may have dis
criminated against women by
setting up separate and lower

wage schedules in the past for
women who were doing the
same work as men
Judy Scott, assistant general
counsel of the United Auto
Workers, said women in unions
must bring pressure at the
bargaining table for independ
ent job evaluations as a means
of upgrading women's wages.
The value of that kind of job
assessment was demonstrated
during World War 11. when the
War Labor Board brought wom
en's wages in the auto industry
up to par, she said.
Day Creamer, executive di
rector of Women Employed,
told the conference that govern
ment contractors — who em

ploy 42 percent of the entire
work force and who receive $100
billion ifl federal work each vear
should be the target of the
equal opportunity enforcement
efforts to "close the wage gap."
Media myths
Thanks to the "myths of the
media" about women ex
ecutives. probably a large seg
ment of the public believes that
women have made it and that
men are victims of reverse dis
crimination," said Welsh, chair
of the Working Women group.
Yet 35 percent of all working
women have clerical jobs, while
only about 5 percent are in mid
management jobs and less than
1 percent are counted as top
management, she said.

setting up separate and lower

wage schedules in the past for
women who were doing the
same work as men
Judy Scott, assistant general
counsel of the United Auto
Workers, said women in unions
must bring pressure at the
bargaining table for independ
ent job evaluations as a means
of upgrading women's wages.
The value of that kind of job
assessment was demonstrated
during World War 11. when the
War Labor Board brought wom
en's wages in the auto industry
up to par, she said.
Day Creamer, executive di
rector of Women Employed,
told the conference that govern
ment contractors — who em

ploy 42 percent of the entire
work force and who receive $100
billion ifl federal work each vear
should be the target of the
equal opportunity enforcement
efforts to "close the wage gap."
Media myths
Thanks to the "myths of the
media" about women ex
ecutives. probably a large seg
ment of the public believes that
women have made it and that
men are victims of reverse dis
crimination," said Welsh, chair
of the Working Women group.
Yet 35 percent of all working
women have clerical jobs, while
only about 5 percent are in mid
management jobs and less than
1 percent are counted as top
management, she said.
Chicago — In the 19705, work
ing women pushed for the right
to equal employment opportuni
ty. In the next decade, feminists
may rally around the concept of
"comparable worth" — the
closing of the gap between
wages paid for typical "men's
work" and stereotyped "wom
en's jobs."
That was the message law
yers and women's rights ad
vocates brought to nearly 600
women at a conference here last
weekend sponsored by the Chi
cago-based Women Employed
Institute.
Industry is taking advantage
of a new class of cheap labor —
women who have entered the
work force in the past decade —
by not letting their level of
wages rise, Eleanor Holmes
Norton, head of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Com
mission told the conference.
"Men who sweep floors" make
more than assembly-line wom
en and female stenographers in
some factories, she said.

Women — who account for 42
percent of the work force — to
day earn 59 cents for every $1
men earn, government
statistics show. Twenty-five
years ago, it was 64 cents for
every $1.
Focal issue
"The undervaluing of jobs
held by women is a focal issue in
trying to achieve equal op
portunity," said Mary
Schaafsman. a Women Em
ployed board member. While
advocates believe the Equal
Pay Act eventually can be ex
panded to include comparable
worth, they acknowledged that
the concept will take time to
press into the consciousness of
judges, legislators, unions and
the public.
The Supreme Court recently
refused to hear an appeal of a
case that upheld the right of
Denver to pay city hospital
nurses less than it paid park
maintenance workers. The
judge in that case had said that
raising the salaries of women
whose jobs were found to be un

dervalued would "disrupt the
economic system of the U S A
and its way of life," one lawyer
told the conference.
Office workers' rights
Women Employed was or
ganized seven years ago to press
for the rights of office workers
in the Chicago business Loop
and has since gone national. It
claims 1000 members here and
2000 in its Women Employed Ad
vocates lobbying network
across the country.
The organization helped in
itiate the federal government's
first employment discrimina
tion case against a federally
chartered lender. Harris Bank
& Trust of Chicago. An adminis
trative law judge's decision in
that case — regarded as the test
case for the banking industry —
is pending.
Yet in another major decision
recently, the Third Circuit
Court of Appeals in Philadel
phia ruled that Westinghouse
Electric Corp. may have dis
criminated against women by
setting up separate and lower

wage schedules in the past for
women who were doing the
same work as men
