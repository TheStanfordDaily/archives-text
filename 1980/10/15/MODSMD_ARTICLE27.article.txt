# New credit for small firms

### Los Angeles Times 
New York — Medium-size companies, faced
with such modern problems as high interest
rates and limited ability to borrow badly
needed cash, are increasingly finding solace in
a 4000-vear-old form of financing.
Known as "factoring." the method was first
used by ancient merchants who paid a mid
dleman. or "factor," to assume responsibility
for collecting the money that their customers
owed. It's a bit more sophisticated today, of
course, but the idea remains essentially the
same.
The modern "factor" is likely to be in an in
dustrial credit organization that provides a
loan or cash advance against a company's re
ceivables as well, in many cases, as assuming
the risk of managing the receivables.
Total factoring volume in the United States
this year is expected to top $27 billion, said
Thomas Pizzo, executive vice president of
Citicorp Industrial Credit Inc. here. That's up
69 percent in the last six years, he added, and
the figure is likely to grow by 10 percent to 15
percent annually for the next several years.
Pizzo's company is an affiliate of the na
tion's second largest bank. Citibank.
The idea of borrowing against receivables
has long been considered an option for en

trepreneurs and small businessmen whose
companies have annual sales in the $2.5 million
to $10 million range.
Factoring is being used increasingly by ap
parel, housewares, furniture, and consumer
electronics companies, the Citicorp official
noted.
It works like this: If the business buys $1000
worth of goods, at the time of shipment the
bank pays that sum to the supplier. The busi
ness in turn sells the blouses for $1200. Since
the bank is handling receivable, it collects that
amount, repays itself the $1000 spent to
purchase the goods, and forwards the balance
of $200. less its fees, to the business. Thus the
financing of the inventory (the letter of credit)
has been paid off by money received from
future sales (the receivables). Small com
panies get substantial sums at rates that are
relatively low.
While it may be a good buy when compared
with the cost of borrowing against a small
company's general credit, factoring is none
theless expensive because the middleman
must be compensated for the risk that he is tak
ing. In addition, by placing an intermediary be
tween a manufacturer and his customer, fac
toring reduces the personal relationship in
volved.
