# Egypt, Israel return to bargaining table
## 
### 
Washington (AP)â€” After a five
month suspension. Egypt and Israel
formally reopened negotiations yes
terday on how to give more than one
million Palestinian Arabs a larger
voice in determining their future.
As the talks resumed under U.S.
auspices, Israel offered to give the
Palestinians living on the West Bank
of the Jordan River and in Gaza a
role in determining land policy in the
occupied territories, diplomatic
sources said.
The sources also said Israel had
reaffirmed that it plans no further
settlements in the area other than
four it previously announced it would
build on the West Bank, but the issue
of whether existing Israeli settle
ments may be "thickened" has not
been resolved.
No additional settlements
The Israeli position was outlined
in a document brought from Jerusa
lem over the weekend by an Interior
Ministry official. Chaim Kubersky.
According to the sources, who re
fused to be identified, it also reaf
firmed the Israeli stance that no ad
ditional settlements beyond the four
are contemplated.
U.S. officials were described as
encouraged by the Israeli stand and
were said to consider it constructive.
However, as the negotiations
began, Josef Burg, head of the Is
raeli delegation, denied that Israel
had made any major concessions.
Negotiations planned
At the same time, he said he had
come to Washington to negotiate and
not simply to prepare for a summit
meeting President Jimmy Carter in

tends to hold sometime after the
Nov 4 elections with Egyptian Pres
ident Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin.
The Carter administration, back
ing Egypt ori the issue of Israeli set
tlements, contends that moving peo
ple into contested territory violates
international law and poses an obsta
cle to a solution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
Israel agreed to uproot its settle
ments in Sinai as part of its peace
treaty with Egypt, which returns
that territory to Egyptian control.
But while pledging not to build more
than four more settlements on the
West Bank, the Israeli government
has not indicated it will dismantle
the 42 already there.
Position discussed
Before the talks opened, Ameri
can mediators met with the Egyp
tian side to try to work out a formal
Egyptian position. The original draft
apparently reflected no substantive
change in policy.
The first round of talks was held at
Blair House, across Pennsylvania
Avenue from the White House. Sol
Linowitz. Carter's special Mideast
mediator, presided. Burg headed the
Israeli delegation and Foreign Min
ister Kamal Hassan Ali the Egyptian
group.
Two days of negotiations are
scheduled, indicating little expecta
tion of a major breakthrough before
the summit, to be patterned on the
one in September 1978 that led to a
peace treaty between Egypt and Is
rael and laid the groundwork for the
current negotiations.
