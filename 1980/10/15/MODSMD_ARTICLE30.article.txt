# 'Born-again' move may backfire

### Daily wire services 
Washington — "We have enough votes to
run the country. And when people say,
We've had enough,' we are going to take
over." — Pat Robertson, famed television
evangelist and president of the Christian
Broadcasting Network.
"The moralists in America have had
enough. We are joining hands together for
the changing, the rejuvenation of a nation."
— The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader of the
Christian New York and head of the Moral
Majority political movement. His "old-
Time Gospel Hour" claims 18 million TV
viewers each week.
"The opportunity exists to put together a
national conservative coalition that endures
as long as Franklin D. Roosevelt's.... Five
years ago fundamentalists were preaching.
Don't get involved in politics; it's dirty.'
Today, they are preaching that NOT to get
involved is almost a sin." — Paul Wevrich,

director of the New Right's Committee for
the Survival of a Free Congress.
"We're organized, we're structured,
we're on the offensive. . . . We've already
taken control of the conservative move
ment. And conservatives have taken control
of the Republican Party. The remaining
thing is to see if we can take control of the
country." — Richard Viguerie. the New
Right's master fundraiser.
Ronald Reagan's view, given at a mass
conference of born-again church leaders,
was, "Religious America is awakening,
perhaps just in time for our country's
sake." Or, to put it another way, just in
time, perhaps, to elect the choice of the New
Right - Ronald Reagan.
To take over the country, of course, would
mean taking over Congress as well as the
White House. That is a big order. Come Nov.

4, the New Right may wish it had not staked
so much of its prestige on the outcome of the
election
The airwave preachers apparently have
forgotten what happened when the coun
try's most celebrated radio priest. Father
Charles Coughlin, earlier tried to convert
his huge audience into a political move
ment.
Coughlin was s impressed with his seem
ing power that he boldly backed a third-par
ty challenge to the re-election of President
Roosevelt in 1936. Result: Roosevelt won 46
out of 48 states; Coughlin was so deflated
that he soon faded from the national scene
It is obvious that the Christian New Right,
in combination with the proliferating sin
gle-issue political groups, has generated a
growing backlash in more conventional re
ligious circles.
