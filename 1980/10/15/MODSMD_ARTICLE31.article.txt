# Defensive coordinator Harbaugh
## Zen Jack: the art of football maintenance 
### Sally Jenkins 
Building a defensive tradition
at Stanford has got to be about
as easy as rent control. The
Cardinals' new defensive coor
dinator, Jack Harbaugh. has in
herited the job of digging a
squad of stalwarts out of a team
built on a thin defensive tradi
tion more akin to Pillsbyry's ex
tra flaky pie crust than anything
else
Harbaugh appears to be one
of those coaches who is more
concerned with attitude, morale
and student-athletes than with
elements like winning. Rose
Bowls and techniques. Why,
then, has he been given the task
of turning a lot of very charm
ingly inconsistent vagabonds
into the Green Berets?
Because between a lot of un
derstanding and concern there
is a near obsession with
teaching football that just won't
quit, which in turn has taken
Harbaugh to the floor of the
Rose Bowl more than once.
While working at the University
of Michigan as a defensive
backfield coach. Harbaugh and
the Wolverines went to three
straight Rose Bowls and one
Gator Bowl. He helped mold a
defense that was ranked lzth in
the NCAA in 1979, and developed
a national reputation for his ex

pertise.
From Crestline, Ohio,
Harbaugh began his career on
the prep school level there,
coaching at Canton, Per
rysburg, E'aton, and Xenia. In
1966 he was named conference
coach of the year at Xenia.
He was a top-flight athlete in
college in both football and
baseball, and was drafted by the
Buffalo Bills professional foot
ball team in 1961 Before going
to Michigan in 1973 he gained
coaching experience at
Morehead State in 1967. Bowling
Green (his alma mater) from
1968 to 1970 and the University of
lowa from 1971 to 1972.
Coaches who have paced a
Rose Bowl sideline are general
ly not known for their preoc
cupation with the term "stu
dent-athlete," or even with the
teaching process for that mat
ter. Harbaugh, however, seems
to have emerged from his ex
periences in big-time college
football relatively unscathed —
he exhibits an almost naive be
lief in college football and the
ideals behind it.
There is no mistaking the en
thusiasm and intensity in his
face when he discusses what
college football can mean to an
athlete. "The actual technique
of football is just one part of the

experience. The lessons a guy
can learn are every bit as im
portant as the things he can ex
perience in life," he said
"Where, for instance, can a
guy experience the jubilation of
a team effort like the one at
Oklahoma (Stanford won,
31-141; where in life can you be
physically manhandled, yet find
enough to dig down inside and
keep going 9" Harbaugh said as
he leaned eagerly across his
desk.
"After Boston College we
were beaten and battered, but
the guys came back, and there is
no experience in life that can
match that. It is something that
no other phase of society can
give; football is importanthe
finished.
Harbaugh sees his role of de
fensive coordinator as including
everything from teacher to
friend, with a possible father
figure thrown in there some
where. The teaching process,
however, seems to be the area
he is most interested in.and the
one from which he draws the
most satisfaction. According to
his players, it is his strongest
point.
"It is an interesting rela
tionship. When you are on the
field and practicing, your goal is
to make the very best football

player that you can. There are
times when they just don't get a
technique, and the players and
coaches vent their frustration
together," Harbaugh said
"But it's the greatest thrill
when a player all at once ex
ecutes the technique just the
way you see it in your mind, and
a great big smile comes on his
face." he continued, smiling
himself. "That's the moment of
truth, when the light goes on.
and 1 think all teachers at Stan
ford recognize that."
For all of his intensity on the
practice field, Harbaugh ap
parently stays away from foot
ball talk with his players off the
field Though he works primari
ly with defensive backs, he has
made an effort to know every
player on the squad. "On the
field and in meetings it's very
businesslike," commented Rick
Gervais. "But at meals he will
sit and talk to you about things
other than football; he makes an
effort to know you as something
other than a football player."
Harbaugh has managed to
commute his love for football to
his entire family. His wife has
been known to visit the practice
field, and his two sons both com
pete. John. 18, will play as a
freshman at Miami (Ohio) this
year, and Jim, 16, is a high

school quarterback at Palo Alto
High School
in fact, football talk probably
dominates the Harbaugh dining
table more than it does the Stan
ford training table. Mrs.
Harbaugh asserts that it is only
natural that football is a prima
ry topic of conversation, be
cause that's what their sons are
interested in.
Coach Harbaugh, on the other
hand, expresses doubt as to
whether or not he deals with his
sons on a coaching level too
much. "The hardest thing is
when one of them comes home
from a game, and we talk about
his mistakes, about techniques
rather than more positive
things; then I think maybe I
don't share enough with him as a
father," he said.
"When you look at a freshman
prospect, you look at him as a
player," Harbaugh said "The
day after I put my son on the
plane the freshman players
came in and I didn't see them as
contribution to a team, but as
my son. It was beneficial for
me. I think I grew through the
experience."
It remains to be seen, how
ever, whether or not the Stan
ford defense will grow as well

Harbaugh appears to be one
of those coaches who is more
concerned with attitude, morale
and student-athletes than with
elements like winning. Rose
Bowls and techniques. Why,
then, has he been given the task
of turning a lot of very charm
ingly inconsistent vagabonds
into the Green Berets?
Because between a lot of un
derstanding and concern there
is a near obsession with
teaching football that just won't
quit, which in turn has taken
Harbaugh to the floor of the
Rose Bowl more than once.
While working at the University
of Michigan as a defensive
backfield coach. Harbaugh and
the Wolverines went to three
straight Rose Bowls and one
Gator Bowl. He helped mold a
defense that was ranked lzth in
the NCAA in 1979, and developed
a national reputation for his ex

pertise.
From Crestline, Ohio,
Harbaugh began his career on
the prep school level there,
coaching at Canton, Per
rysburg, E'aton, and Xenia. In
1966 he was named conference
coach of the year at Xenia.
He was a top-flight athlete in
college in both football and
baseball, and was drafted by the
Buffalo Bills professional foot
ball team in 1961 Before going
to Michigan in 1973 he gained
coaching experience at
Morehead State in 1967. Bowling
Green (his alma mater) from
1968 to 1970 and the University of
lowa from 1971 to 1972.
Coaches who have paced a
Rose Bowl sideline are general
ly not known for their preoc
cupation with the term "stu
dent-athlete," or even with the
teaching process for that mat
ter. Harbaugh, however, seems
to have emerged from his ex
periences in big-time college
football relatively unscathed —
he exhibits an almost naive be
lief in college football and the
ideals behind it.
There is no mistaking the en
thusiasm and intensity in his
face when he discusses what
college football can mean to an
athlete. "The actual technique
of football is just one part of the

experience. The lessons a guy
can learn are every bit as im
portant as the things he can ex
perience in life," he said
"Where, for instance, can a
guy experience the jubilation of
a team effort like the one at
Oklahoma (Stanford won,
31-141; where in life can you be
physically manhandled, yet find
enough to dig down inside and
keep going 9" Harbaugh said as
he leaned eagerly across his
desk.
"After Boston College we
were beaten and battered, but
the guys came back, and there is
no experience in life that can
match that. It is something that
no other phase of society can
give; football is importanthe
finished.
Harbaugh sees his role of de
fensive coordinator as including
everything from teacher to
friend, with a possible father
figure thrown in there some
where. The teaching process,
however, seems to be the area
he is most interested in.and the
one from which he draws the
most satisfaction. According to
his players, it is his strongest
point.
"It is an interesting rela
tionship. When you are on the
field and practicing, your goal is
to make the very best football

player that you can. There are
times when they just don't get a
technique, and the players and
coaches vent their frustration
together," Harbaugh said
"But it's the greatest thrill
when a player all at once ex
ecutes the technique just the
way you see it in your mind, and
a great big smile comes on his
face." he continued, smiling
himself. "That's the moment of
truth, when the light goes on.
and 1 think all teachers at Stan
ford recognize that."
For all of his intensity on the
practice field, Harbaugh ap
parently stays away from foot
ball talk with his players off the
field Though he works primari
ly with defensive backs, he has
made an effort to know every
player on the squad. "On the
field and in meetings it's very
businesslike," commented Rick
Gervais. "But at meals he will
sit and talk to you about things
other than football; he makes an
effort to know you as something
other than a football player."
Harbaugh has managed to
commute his love for football to
his entire family. His wife has
been known to visit the practice
field, and his two sons both com
pete. John. 18, will play as a
freshman at Miami (Ohio) this
year, and Jim, 16, is a high

school quarterback at Palo Alto
High School
in fact, football talk probably
dominates the Harbaugh dining
table more than it does the Stan
ford training table. Mrs.
Harbaugh asserts that it is only
natural that football is a prima
ry topic of conversation, be
cause that's what their sons are
interested in.
Coach Harbaugh, on the other
hand, expresses doubt as to
whether or not he deals with his
sons on a coaching level too
much. "The hardest thing is
when one of them comes home
from a game, and we talk about
his mistakes, about techniques
rather than more positive
things; then I think maybe I
don't share enough with him as a
father," he said.
"When you look at a freshman
prospect, you look at him as a
player," Harbaugh said "The
day after I put my son on the
plane the freshman players
came in and I didn't see them as
contribution to a team, but as
my son. It was beneficial for
me. I think I grew through the
experience."
It remains to be seen, how
ever, whether or not the Stan
ford defense will grow as well
