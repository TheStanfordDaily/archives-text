## Buoniconti sees danger for NFL retirees 
### Associated Press 
Nick Buoniconti received a
degree when he left college to
play pro football. And because
of his foresight while he was
playing, he had a separate ca
reer waiting for him when he
left the game.
Nick Buoniconti is very for
tunate — and perhaps very
much in the minority.
He is a graduate of Notre
Dame, a former linebacker of
the Boston Patriots (1962-68)
and Miami Dolphins (1969-74,
1976), a lawyer, a player agent,
a public speaker and, after
years of "no-name" anonymity,
a star of light beer com
mercials.
None of it was an accident. He
worked for it. worked hard.
He looks aroud now, just as he
did as a player during the 1960s
and '70s, and sees athletes set

ting themselves up for a gigan
tic crash when their playing
days end. It is. he believes, the
No. 1 problem in the National
Football League.
The drug arrest of Bob Hayes
and the suicide of Jim Tvrer are
only the most dramatic in
stances of former players in
capable of dealing with the real
world. Too many players, either
without degrees or with mean
ingless ones, are unable to cope
when they no longer are pam
pered. when their every whim
no longer is taken care of —
when they have to be like every
one else.
Buoniconti. in an oblique way.
says the NFL deserves at least a
bit of the blame for the problem
and thinks it's time the league
or its teams begin doing some
thing about it.

"Look at the Jim Tvrer
thing." Buoniconti said. "He's
unemployed, ends up shooting
his wife, shooting himself. You
just wonder, did he ever really
make the adjustment out of
football'' Did he prepare
himself while he was playing 0 I
don't know. I knew Jim very
well He was just a real lovable
guy. Who knows? He just
couldn't cope. I guess. A lot of
guys can't cope with it. That's
my biggest concern."
Many players, he thinks, live
a very narrow, almost sheltered
existence and that, "when they
retire, unless they really have
something, a business to go into,
a profession to fall back on. it's
a tough adjustment. . . .You see
a lot of problems develop in
marital situations because their
minds aren't out beyond foot
ball. Many players have no idea

what they're going to do. That's
the problem. They really feel
they'll cross that bridge when
the time comes.
"A lot of younger players
don't want to hear about the
future, about life after football.
All they want is to be patted on
the back and be told how great
they are," Buoniconti said.
"And I've seen guys who
played 10. 12 years and never
had an offseason job. never got
into anything, never tried to find
out whether there's anything
out there for them." he added.
"They never tried to find out
whether they have an aptitude
for business, whether they have
an aptitude for coaching, or any
thing. So they just let it go. Then
they cross the bridge and it be
comes an experimental thing."
And they crash.

the time comes.
"A lot of younger players
don't want to hear about the
future, about life after football.
All they want is to be patted on
the back and be told how great
they are," Buoniconti said.
"And I've seen guys who
played 10. 12 years and never
had an offseason job. never got
into anything, never tried to find
out whether there's anything
out there for them." he added.
"They never tried to find out
whether they have an aptitude
for business, whether they have
an aptitude for coaching, or any
thing. So they just let it go. Then
they cross the bridge and it be
comes an experimental thing."
And they crash.

Nick Buoniconti received a
degree when he left college to
play pro football. And because
of his foresight while he was
playing, he had a separate ca
reer waiting for him when he
left the game.
Nick Buoniconti is very for
tunate — and perhaps very
much in the minority.
He is a graduate of Notre
Dame, a former linebacker of
the Boston Patriots (1962-68)
and Miami Dolphins (1969-74,
1976), a lawyer, a player agent,
a public speaker and, after
years of "no-name" anonymity,
a star of light beer com
mercials.
None of it was an accident. He
worked for it. worked hard.
He looks aroud now, just as he
did as a player during the 1960s
and '70s, and sees athletes set

ting themselves up for a gigan
tic crash when their playing
days end. It is. he believes, the
No. 1 problem in the National
Football League.
The drug arrest of Bob Hayes
and the suicide of Jim Tvrer are
only the most dramatic in
stances of former players in
capable of dealing with the real
world. Too many players, either
without degrees or with mean
ingless ones, are unable to cope
when they no longer are pam
pered. when their every whim
no longer is taken care of —
when they have to be like every
one else.
Buoniconti. in an oblique way.
says the NFL deserves at least a
bit of the blame for the problem
and thinks it's time the league
or its teams begin doing some
thing about it.

"Look at the Jim Tvrer
thing." Buoniconti said. "He's
unemployed, ends up shooting
his wife, shooting himself. You
just wonder, did he ever really
make the adjustment out of
football'' Did he prepare
himself while he was playing 0 I
don't know. I knew Jim very
well He was just a real lovable
guy. Who knows? He just
couldn't cope. I guess. A lot of
guys can't cope with it. That's
my biggest concern."
Many players, he thinks, live
a very narrow, almost sheltered
existence and that, "when they
retire, unless they really have
something, a business to go into,
a profession to fall back on. it's
a tough adjustment. . . .You see
a lot of problems develop in
marital situations because their
minds aren't out beyond foot
ball. Many players have no idea

what they're going to do. That's
the problem. They really feel
they'll cross that bridge when
the time comes.
"A lot of younger players
don't want to hear about the
future, about life after football.
All they want is to be patted on
the back and be told how great
they are," Buoniconti said.
