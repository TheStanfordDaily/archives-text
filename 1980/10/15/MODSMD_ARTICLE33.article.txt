Philadelphia (AP> — Bake
Mcßride hammered a three-run
homer and Bob Boone rifled a
pair of RBI doubles as the Phila
delphia Phillies stormed from
behind for a 7-6 victory over the
battling Kansas City Royals last
night in the 1980 World Series
opener.
A crowd of 65,791, largest to
watch a World Series game
since 1964, kept up a steady roar
as the Phillies won their first
Series game in 65 years. The last
one was in 1915 when the pitcher
was Hall of Famer Grover
Cleveland Alexander
Last night, the winning
pitcher was Bob Walk, a 23-
year-old rookie pressed into
starting because of the
scrambled condition of the
Phillies pitching staff following
the grueling National League
playoffs against Houston,
Walk, recovering from a
rocky start, did a gallant job
against the Royals, champions
of the American League, until
he was shelled out in the eighth
inning. He became the first
rookie to pitch and win a series

opener since Joe Black did it for
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952
It was a night for newcomers
as the expansion team Royals
made their first World Series
appearance, the Phillies played
their first Series game since
1950, and both clubs went into
the Series with rookie managers
— the first time that has hap
pened in the history of the Fall
Classic.
The Royals rushed to a 4-0
lead against Walk on a pair of
two-run homers. Amos Otis con
nected in the second inning fol
lowing a walk to leadoff man
Darrell Porter, and Willie
Aikens, celebrating his 26th
birthday, unloaded the first of
his two home runs in the third
after Hal Mcßae had singled.
Aikens became only the second
player in baseball history to hit
two home runs in his first Series
game.
His second homer in the
eighth, also good for two runs,
brought Tug McGraw in to re
lieve Walk.
The Phillies, following the
pattern they had established in

the dramatic five-game Na
tional League Championship
Series against the Houston
Astros, quickly wiped out the 4-0
deficit against Kansas City
starter Dennis Leonard. Larry
Bowa stroked the first Phillies
hit, a single up the middle.
Bowa then stole second and
raced home when Boone,
playing with a badly bruised leg
he suffered in the playoffs,
doubled to left field. That
brought up leadoff man, Lonnie
Smith, inserted in left field
when Philadelphia manager
Dallas Green decided to use his
regular, Greg Luzinski, as the
designated hitter.
Smith delivered a single to
left and Boone stopped at third
as George Brett cut off the
throw. When Smith made a wide
turn around first, Brett decided
to run him down. As the Royals
closed in on Smith, Boone
dashed home, making it 4-2.
Pete Rose was the next batter
and got into a cat-and-mouse
contest with Leonard, stepping
out of the box to try to break the
pitcher's concentration. It

worked.
Leonard hit Rose on the right
knee and followed with a walk to
Mike Schmidt The cheers real
ly rocked Veterans Stadium mo
ments later when Mcßride, bat
ting cleanup, slammed
Leonard's 1-1 serve over the
right field wall
The Phillies added a run in the
fourth Manny Trillo, their
playoff MVP, beat out a single
behind second base. When
Leonard bounced a pickoff
throw past first baseman
Aikens for an error, Trillo took
second. Bowa grounded out, but
Boone delivered again, this time
drilling a double to the right
field corner, scoring Trillo.
In the fifth, the Phillies made
it 7-4 They loaded the bases on a
walk, a single and a hit batsman
before Garry Maddox lifted a
sacrifice fly to left.
While the Phillies were build
ing their lead. Walk had settled
down nicely. He was perhaps a
batter away from being knocked
out in the third when a two-out
walk to Porter and hits by Otis
and Clint Hurdle threaten to in

crease the Royals' lead to 5-0.
Rut Porter stumbled coming
around third on Hurdle's hit and
was thrown out at the plate by
Smith, thus saving the inning
and Walk
When he next took the mound
the Phillies had shot to the front
on their big five-run inning The
young right-hander mowed
down nine straight batters over
the middle three innings, and
going into the eighth he had a
string of 12 out of 13 Rut then he
ran out of steam.
Rrett opened the eighth with a
double to the fence in left-center
— his first hit of the night. Then
Aikens ripped his second homer
— another rocket that jumped
out beyond the fence in right
center field.
Phils Manager Green then
went to bullpen ace McGraw
The veteran left-hander per
mitted a one-out single to Otis —
his third hit of the game. Rut he
got pinch-hitter John Wathan to
slam into an inning-ending
double play. McGraw set the
Royals down one-two-three in
the ninth.

A crowd of 65,791, largest to
watch a World Series game
since 1964, kept up a steady roar
as the Phillies won their first
Series game in 65 years. The last
one was in 1915 when the pitcher
was Hall of Famer Grover
Cleveland Alexander
Last night, the winning
pitcher was Bob Walk, a 23-
year-old rookie pressed into
starting because of the
scrambled condition of the
Phillies pitching staff following
the grueling National League
playoffs against Houston,
Walk, recovering from a
rocky start, did a gallant job
against the Royals, champions
of the American League, until
he was shelled out in the eighth
inning. He became the first
rookie to pitch and win a series

opener since Joe Black did it for
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952
It was a night for newcomers
as the expansion team Royals
made their first World Series
appearance, the Phillies played
their first Series game since
1950, and both clubs went into
the Series with rookie managers
— the first time that has hap
pened in the history of the Fall
Classic.
The Royals rushed to a 4-0
lead against Walk on a pair of
two-run homers. Amos Otis con
nected in the second inning fol
lowing a walk to leadoff man
Darrell Porter, and Willie
Aikens, celebrating his 26th
birthday, unloaded the first of
his two home runs in the third
after Hal Mcßae had singled.
Aikens became only the second
player in baseball history to hit
two home runs in his first Series
game.
His second homer in the
eighth, also good for two runs,
brought Tug McGraw in to re
lieve Walk.
The Phillies, following the
pattern they had established in

the dramatic five-game Na
tional League Championship
Series against the Houston
Astros, quickly wiped out the 4-0
deficit against Kansas City
starter Dennis Leonard. Larry
Bowa stroked the first Phillies
hit, a single up the middle.
Bowa then stole second and
raced home when Boone,
playing with a badly bruised leg
he suffered in the playoffs,
doubled to left field. That
brought up leadoff man, Lonnie
Smith, inserted in left field
when Philadelphia manager
Dallas Green decided to use his
regular, Greg Luzinski, as the
designated hitter.
Smith delivered a single to
left and Boone stopped at third
as George Brett cut off the
throw. When Smith made a wide
turn around first, Brett decided
to run him down. As the Royals
closed in on Smith, Boone
dashed home, making it 4-2.
Pete Rose was the next batter
and got into a cat-and-mouse
contest with Leonard, stepping
out of the box to try to break the
pitcher's concentration. It

worked.
Leonard hit Rose on the right
knee and followed with a walk to
Mike Schmidt The cheers real
ly rocked Veterans Stadium mo
ments later when Mcßride, bat
ting cleanup, slammed
Leonard's 1-1 serve over the
right field wall
The Phillies added a run in the
fourth Manny Trillo, their
playoff MVP, beat out a single
behind second base. When
Leonard bounced a pickoff
throw past first baseman
Aikens for an error, Trillo took
second. Bowa grounded out, but
Boone delivered again, this time
drilling a double to the right
field corner, scoring Trillo.
In the fifth, the Phillies made
it 7-4 They loaded the bases on a
walk, a single and a hit batsman
before Garry Maddox lifted a
sacrifice fly to left.
While the Phillies were build
ing their lead. Walk had settled
down nicely. He was perhaps a
batter away from being knocked
out in the third when a two-out
walk to Porter and hits by Otis
and Clint Hurdle threaten to in

crease the Royals' lead to 5-0.
Rut Porter stumbled coming
around third on Hurdle's hit and
was thrown out at the plate by
Smith, thus saving the inning
and Walk
When he next took the mound
the Phillies had shot to the front
on their big five-run inning The
young right-hander mowed
down nine straight batters over
the middle three innings, and
going into the eighth he had a
string of 12 out of 13 Rut then he
ran out of steam.
Rrett opened the eighth with a
double to the fence in left-center
— his first hit of the night. Then
Aikens ripped his second homer
— another rocket that jumped
out beyond the fence in right
center field.
Phils Manager Green then
went to bullpen ace McGraw
The veteran left-hander per
mitted a one-out single to Otis —
his third hit of the game. Rut he
got pinch-hitter John Wathan to
slam into an inning-ending
double play. McGraw set the
Royals down one-two-three in
the ninth.
Philadelphia (AP> — Bake
Mcßride hammered a three-run
homer and Bob Boone rifled a
pair of RBI doubles as the Phila
delphia Phillies stormed from
behind for a 7-6 victory over the
battling Kansas City Royals last
night in the 1980 World Series
opener.
