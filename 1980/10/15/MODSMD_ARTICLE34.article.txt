WBC policy dictates.
The drugs were adminstered
by Ali's personal physician, Dr.
Charles Lee Williams, who
thought that Ali had already un

drugs was reported by Dr.
George Wirges, the Nevada box

ing commission doctor, who
said that he attempted to give
Ali the urinalysis in the fighter's
trailer after the fight but waited
until later and gave the test in
Ali's hotel room. It was there

he had given Ali the drugs.

PaclO will be in Rose Bowl
San Francisco (AP) — The
Pacific-10 Conference most
likely will be sending a football
also-ran to the Rose Bowl, but
executive director Wiles
Hallock says published reports
that the Pac-10 might not be rep
resented at all are "totally er
roneous."
Hallock issued a statement
Monday, noting that, "A rumor
has surfaced that the Tour
nament of Roses' contract with
the Pac-10 provides some kind
of alternative to the selection of
a team from our conference
should it not be what some call
'representative.' That is totally
erroneous.
"Neither the Tournament of
Roses nor the conference has
any doubt that our champion
will not only be 'represent
ative.' but will also be able to
take care of itself against the
Big Ten champion," the

statement said.
Stanford. Washington. Wash
ington St., Cal and Arizona are
the eligible teams for post-sea
son games. All five have one
conference loss so far.
Frisbee flippers sweep
Stanford's ultimate frisbee
team hustled its way to two vic
tories Sunday afternoon at
Roble Field, defeating the Santa
Cruz Kaos 15-12 and edging
Chabot College 16-14.
The team seems primed for a
run at the western regional
championships (to be decided
Nov. 8 & 9). Stanford will enter
qualifying tournaments for the
regionals the next two week
ends, including playing host to
other Northern California, Ore
gon and Washington teams Sat
urday. Oct. 25 at Roble Field.
