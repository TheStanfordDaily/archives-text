# McBride wants to kick home-run habit

Philadelphia (AP) — Bake Mcßride said he had to be excited in
hitting a game-winning home run, but he wants to be careful not to
get into a home run habit
Mcßride's three-run homer in the third inning keyed a five-run
rally by the Philadelphia Phillies that overcame a 4-0 deficit and
triggered the National League champions to a 7-6 triumph over Kan
sas City in the first game of the 1980 World Series.
"Hitting home runs has fouled up my swing before," Mcßride ex
plained about his statement of kicking the home run habit.
Mcßride said he was concerned that the Phillies might be drained
after the nerve-wracking five-game NL Championship Series
against the Houston Astros. The Phillies won that set 3-2
"I was drained," said Mcßride, although with a three-run homer,
a run-scored and two singles, he didn't play like a tired man Z~
Another key Philadelphia performer in the victory over the
American League champions was veteran Bob Boone, who played
despite a bruised foot that has spent a lot of time in an ice machine
since the club arrived home from Houston The ice contraption
helps reduce swelling and hastens healing of bruises
"I've been swinging the bat real well the last 10 days or two
weeks," said Boone, who hit two run-scoring doubles as the Phillies
battered Kansas City's ace right-hander. Dennis Leonard.
Someone asked if the Phillies catcher was in any pain from his
battered foot
"There are a lot of things that you put out of your mind when
you're in a World Series and pain is one of them I've waited too long
to get here to worry about that."
Phillies manager Dallas Green, however, is still worrying about
the Royals. "They keep clawing at you," he said. "And I'll have to
look at what we have written down on Willie Aikens."
It was a bittersweet 26th birthday for the Kansas City first
baseman. Aikens hit a pair of two-run homers, but nonetheless in a
losing cause.
"I figured their scouting reports on me were to throw me inside."
said Aikens. who was born during the 1954 World Series and named
by the attending physician after New York Giants star Willie Mays
"Both home runs I was looking for inside fastballs. and I got
them." Aikens said.
Green was equally aware that Aikens got what he wanted, and
planned to do something to change that situation. Said Green. "I
think we might have to pitch differently to him."
Leonard wishes he had pitched differently to Pete Rose, but ac
cused the Philadelphia first baseman of showboating when he was
hit in the right leg by a Leonard pitch in the third inning.
Rose charged menancingly toward the mound, then wheeled and
dashed to first base, and moments later Mcßride unloaded his hom
er. Leonard said he never thought Rose would attack.
"He always does that," Leonard said "He didn't make any at
tempt to get out of the way. In fact, he might even have stuck his leg
out."
Royals' catcher Darrell Porter agreed.
"He stepped into it, noquestion," said Porter. "He sure didn't try
to get out of the way. But it's a tough call for an umpire."
