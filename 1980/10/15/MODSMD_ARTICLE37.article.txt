Turkish hijacking attempted, stopped
Ankara, Turkey — Army sharpshooters cut through the rear
door of a hijacked jetliner in southeastern Turkey early yesterday
stormed in shooting, rescued more than 100 hostages and cap
tured five Turkish hijackers who smuggled pistols aboard in
hollowed-out Korans, the semi-official Anatolia news agency re
ported
The hijackers and some of the passengers were reported slight
ly injured in the assault, which began at 5:25 a.m. and ended a
minute later, about 11 hours after the quintet took over the Turk
ish Airlines Boeing 727
The hijackers, who posed as Iranian followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his Islamic revolution, were flown to An
kara.
Anatolia said they included two journalists, an escaped convict
who had been serving a 20-year sentence for left-wing terrorism
and an engineering student. No information about the fifth man
was given except his name.
The journalists were Yilmaz Yalciner of an Ankara economic
weekly, reportedly a member of an Islamic fundamentalist or
ganization, and Coskun Aral, an employee of a Paris photo-news
agency. Anatolia said. It said the ex-convict was named Mhemet
Ahlak and he was a member of the leftist Turkish People's Liber
ation Army
The plane was on a flight from Munich. West Germany, to An
kara. the Turkish capital. Anatolia said the hijackers smuggled
two pistols aboard in hollowed-out editions of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, and commandeered the aircraft shortly after
it took off from Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. Monday on the last leg of the
flight. Other sources said there were 148 persons aboard, all of
them Turks.
Iraqi forces prepare for siege
Basra, Iraq — Iraqi forces threatening Abadan moved more ar
mor and artillery across the Karun River but appeared to be pre
paring for a siege rather than an assault to overrun the Iranian oil
city and its giant refinery.
As the Iraqi war to win complete control of the Shatt al-Arab
estuary went into its 23rd day, Iraq's official Pars news agency
said the invaders put two more pontoon bridges across the Karun
northwest of Abadan. giving them three crossing points on the ap
proaches to the threatened city.
A British reporter who visited the area said he saw tanks, am
phibious vehicles and artillery moving across one of the bridges
"in a leisurely manner" and that the Iraqi troops were relaxed
and confident. He said the Iraqis were shelling Abadan and the
Iranians were replying with "inaccurate" fire but were getting no
air support.
Iraqi officials claimed their forces advanced three to five miles
toward Abadan. but the Western reporter said it appeared that the
Iraqis were planning a siege of Abadan and Iranian-held parts of
the port city of Khorramshahr. on the west side of Karun River's
juncture with the Shatt al-Arab.
Khorramshahr and Abadan are the two big cities on the Iranian
side of the Shatt al-Arab, Iraq's waterway to the Persian Gulf and
a major territorial issue for centuries between the Arabs of what
is now Iraq and the Persians of what is now Iran.
Iraqi troops sliced across the northern approaches to Khor
ramshahr. Iran's chief port for imports, early in the war. cutting
its road and rail lines to the rest of oil-rich Khuzistan Province,
and the establishment of the Iraqi river crossings completed the
isolation of the city.
Americans share phy&ics Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans — James Cronin of the
University of Chicago and Val Fitch of Princeton University —
won the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics yesterday for nuclear re
search that contributed to the big-bang theory of the creation of
the universe.
They were cited by the Swedish academy of Sciences "for the
discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in
the decay of neutral K-mesons." Mesons are unstable particles
first observed in cosmic rays. The big-bang theory is that the uni
verse began with a gigantic explosion and has been expanding
ever since.

Hie award carries a cash stipend of $212,000.
Cronin and Fitch made their Nobel winning discovery by stud
ies of a new type of elementary particles using a proton ac
celerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory on New York's
Long Island where they headed a research group. Their studies
probed the validity of three related symmetry principles In phys
ics, the Academy of Sciences said.
"The new truth reached by the discovery of violations of the
laws of symmetry in nature recently also has been incorporated
as an important ingredient in cosmological speculations The aim
has been to try to understand how a universe, originally very hot
and symmetric, could avoid that matter and antimatter almost
immediately annihilated each other. In other words, efforts have
been made to describe how the matter we are made of was once
created in a big bang and how it could survivethe birth pains," the
academy stated.
"The discovery emphasizes, once again, that even the most
self-evident principles in science cannot be regarded fully valid
until they have been examined in precise experiments," It added.
Poland's workers win new victories
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent trade union move
ment won another round today as the official union council pre
pared to dissolve because all its branch unions have quit It to be
come "independent."
Representatives of the independent movement charged that
some of the breakaways were still controlled bv the Communist
Party.
Mieczyslaw Grad. secretary of the once-mighty Central Coun
cil of Trade Unions, said a "liquidation commission" probably
would be formed soon to dismantle the council formally and that
some of the 150 political officers on the council staff have quit, the
official PAP news agency reported.
Grad said all the branch unions quit to become independent un
ions under the Gdansk settlement six weeks ago that ended the
nationwide summer strikes. The walkouts began when the gov
ernment withdrew meat price subsidies on July 1. As part of the
settlement two months later, the communist regime agreed to al
low formation of unions free of party control for the first time in
the Soviet Bloc.
Representatives of the Solidarity union federation, the off
spring of the summer strike committees, said some of the old un
ions now calling themselves independent still retained their close
ties to the party.
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an organizer for the Warsaw branch of
Solidarity, said there are now three types of unions; the true inde
pendents forged from the strike movement, the old unions now out
of the council and new "bogus unions set up by management to co
opt the movement."
He said some of the old unions are sincerely trying to get
greater autonomy from party control. But others, he said, tried to
adopt the guise of independence before organizers could form a
truly independent union that would lure away the old unions'
members.
Jenrette pledges he'll stay in race
Florence, S.C. — Rep. John Jenrette (D-S.C ), convicted last
week in the FBl's Abscam probe of official corruption, announced
Monday he will continue his campaign for re-election.
The 44-vear-old Democrat said, however, he will resign from
Congress if he loses his appeal of the conviction.
"This office is too valuable to allow anyone to win by default,"
Jenrette said, his voice breaking and his lips trembling. "There
fore I plan to remain on the ballot."
A crowd of about 75 supporters from his northeastern South
Carolina congressional district loudly applauded the announce
ment.
Jenrette. who said he sought the advice and prayers of many
people in making his decision, said there was "no perfect or rea
sonable solution."
Deukmejian to drop suits on sects
Sacramento — Attorney General George Deukmejian said yes
terday he is dropping the state's lawsuits against Synanon and the
Worldwide Church of God because a new state law will restrict his

authority over churches.
The law, signed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown but not effec
tive until next June, prevents the attorney general from suing
church leaders on the grounds that they had misused church
funds.
The Synanon suit alleges that officers of the group, including
founder Charles Dederich, misappropriated $300,000 in funds giv
en for charity.
The Church of God case alleges draining of church funds by
leaders of the Pasadena-based church, which the state has placed
in receivership.
Deukmejian's announcement came only hours after the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear arguments by the Church of God
that state prosecutors acted unconstitutionally in the "forcible
takeover" of the church and warrantless seizure of records.
Pro-Amin invaders in Uganda contained
Kampala, Uganda — Government forces have brought fighting
in Uganda's West Nile district under control after soldiers loyal to
ousted President Idi Amin invaded a week ago. Paulo Muwanga,
chairman of the nation's ruling military commission, said yester
day.
He said in a statement broadcast by Radio Uganda: "Because
of their early morning surprise attack, the invaders were able to
penetrate into Uganda's territory, and the situation appeared to
be quite grim.
"Nevertheless, a swift reinforcement to the Ugandan National
Liberation Army brought an immediate halt to the advancing in
vaders."
Muwanga said it "has been established beyond doubt" that the
attacks came from remnants of Amin's army who fled to neigh
boring Zaire and Sudan after Amin was ousted 16 months ago.
The Sudanese embassy here categorically denied Ugandan
claims that Sudan was aiding the invading force.
Ugandan Foreign Minister Otema Allimadi Sunday accused the
Sudan and Zaire of aiding troops backing Amin.
More than 10,000 troops and civilians fled Uganda to the two
neighboring countries last year when the Amin regime was over
thrown by Tanzanian and Ugandan troops.
Poll shows unionists agree with Reagan
Washington — A confidential AFL-CIO poll shows that despite
labor leaders' dislike for Ronald Reagan, a majority of rank-and
file union members identify with many of the Republican nomi
nee's conservative stances.
Commissioned by the AFL-ClO's political arm — the Commit
tee on Political Education — the poll found that 72 percent of un
ion members opposed cuts in defense spending, 65 percent favor a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget,
60 percent oppose the Panama Canal treaties, 51 percent oppose
strict controls on handguns, and 44 percent oppose legalized abor
tion.
The survey also found that by a 3-to-l margin, union members
blame government more than business for the country's econom
ic problems. By a 2-to-l margin, they feel there is too much gov
ernment regulation of business.
The survey was intended to aid the AFL-CIO principally in plan
ning its campaign strategy for the congressional elections.
Labor leaders are trying to counter Reagan's appeals to union
members by pointing to his record of opposition on key labor is
sues.
Stocks show modest gains
The stock market posted a modest gain in fairly active trading
yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up by more
than 6 points about midday but faded in later trading. It closed
with a gain of 2.30 points at 962.20.
One of the most spectacular stock gains in some time occurred
in the over-the-counter market where a new offering of a million
shares of Genentech, a small San Francisco-based genetic engi
neering company, started trading. The stock, offered at 35 per
share when the underwriters released it, quickly was bid up as
high as 88 a share then fell back.

file union members identify with many of the Republican nomi
nee's conservative stances.
Commissioned by the AFL-ClO's political arm — the Commit
tee on Political Education — the poll found that 72 percent of un
ion members opposed cuts in defense spending, 65 percent favor a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget,
60 percent oppose the Panama Canal treaties, 51 percent oppose
strict controls on handguns, and 44 percent oppose legalized abor
tion.
The survey also found that by a 3-to-l margin, union members
blame government more than business for the country's econom
ic problems. By a 2-to-l margin, they feel there is too much gov
ernment regulation of business.
The survey was intended to aid the AFL-CIO principally in plan
ning its campaign strategy for the congressional elections.
Labor leaders are trying to counter Reagan's appeals to union
members by pointing to his record of opposition on key labor is
sues.
Stocks show modest gains
The stock market posted a modest gain in fairly active trading
yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up by more
than 6 points about midday but faded in later trading. It closed
with a gain of 2.30 points at 962.20.
One of the most spectacular stock gains in some time occurred
in the over-the-counter market where a new offering of a million
shares of Genentech, a small San Francisco-based genetic engi
neering company, started trading. The stock, offered at 35 per
share when the underwriters released it, quickly was bid up as
high as 88 a share then fell back.

Turkish hijacking attempted, stopped
Ankara, Turkey — Army sharpshooters cut through the rear
door of a hijacked jetliner in southeastern Turkey early yesterday
stormed in shooting, rescued more than 100 hostages and cap
tured five Turkish hijackers who smuggled pistols aboard in
hollowed-out Korans, the semi-official Anatolia news agency re
ported
The hijackers and some of the passengers were reported slight
ly injured in the assault, which began at 5:25 a.m. and ended a
minute later, about 11 hours after the quintet took over the Turk
ish Airlines Boeing 727
The hijackers, who posed as Iranian followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his Islamic revolution, were flown to An
kara.
Anatolia said they included two journalists, an escaped convict
who had been serving a 20-year sentence for left-wing terrorism
and an engineering student. No information about the fifth man
was given except his name.
The journalists were Yilmaz Yalciner of an Ankara economic
weekly, reportedly a member of an Islamic fundamentalist or
ganization, and Coskun Aral, an employee of a Paris photo-news
agency. Anatolia said. It said the ex-convict was named Mhemet
Ahlak and he was a member of the leftist Turkish People's Liber
ation Army
The plane was on a flight from Munich. West Germany, to An
kara. the Turkish capital. Anatolia said the hijackers smuggled
two pistols aboard in hollowed-out editions of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, and commandeered the aircraft shortly after
it took off from Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. Monday on the last leg of the
flight. Other sources said there were 148 persons aboard, all of
them Turks.
Iraqi forces prepare for siege
Basra, Iraq — Iraqi forces threatening Abadan moved more ar
mor and artillery across the Karun River but appeared to be pre
paring for a siege rather than an assault to overrun the Iranian oil
city and its giant refinery.
As the Iraqi war to win complete control of the Shatt al-Arab
estuary went into its 23rd day, Iraq's official Pars news agency
said the invaders put two more pontoon bridges across the Karun
northwest of Abadan. giving them three crossing points on the ap
proaches to the threatened city.
A British reporter who visited the area said he saw tanks, am
phibious vehicles and artillery moving across one of the bridges
"in a leisurely manner" and that the Iraqi troops were relaxed
and confident. He said the Iraqis were shelling Abadan and the
Iranians were replying with "inaccurate" fire but were getting no
air support.
Iraqi officials claimed their forces advanced three to five miles
toward Abadan. but the Western reporter said it appeared that the
Iraqis were planning a siege of Abadan and Iranian-held parts of
the port city of Khorramshahr. on the west side of Karun River's
juncture with the Shatt al-Arab.
Khorramshahr and Abadan are the two big cities on the Iranian
side of the Shatt al-Arab, Iraq's waterway to the Persian Gulf and
a major territorial issue for centuries between the Arabs of what
is now Iraq and the Persians of what is now Iran.
Iraqi troops sliced across the northern approaches to Khor
ramshahr. Iran's chief port for imports, early in the war. cutting
its road and rail lines to the rest of oil-rich Khuzistan Province,
and the establishment of the Iraqi river crossings completed the
isolation of the city.
Americans share phy&ics Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans — James Cronin of the
University of Chicago and Val Fitch of Princeton University —
won the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics yesterday for nuclear re
search that contributed to the big-bang theory of the creation of
the universe.
They were cited by the Swedish academy of Sciences "for the
discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in
the decay of neutral K-mesons." Mesons are unstable particles
first observed in cosmic rays. The big-bang theory is that the uni
verse began with a gigantic explosion and has been expanding
ever since.

Hie award carries a cash stipend of $212,000.
Cronin and Fitch made their Nobel winning discovery by stud
ies of a new type of elementary particles using a proton ac
celerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory on New York's
Long Island where they headed a research group. Their studies
probed the validity of three related symmetry principles In phys
ics, the Academy of Sciences said.
"The new truth reached by the discovery of violations of the
laws of symmetry in nature recently also has been incorporated
as an important ingredient in cosmological speculations The aim
has been to try to understand how a universe, originally very hot
and symmetric, could avoid that matter and antimatter almost
immediately annihilated each other. In other words, efforts have
been made to describe how the matter we are made of was once
created in a big bang and how it could survivethe birth pains," the
academy stated.
"The discovery emphasizes, once again, that even the most
self-evident principles in science cannot be regarded fully valid
until they have been examined in precise experiments," It added.
Poland's workers win new victories
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent trade union move
ment won another round today as the official union council pre
pared to dissolve because all its branch unions have quit It to be
come "independent."
Representatives of the independent movement charged that
some of the breakaways were still controlled bv the Communist
Party.
Mieczyslaw Grad. secretary of the once-mighty Central Coun
cil of Trade Unions, said a "liquidation commission" probably
would be formed soon to dismantle the council formally and that
some of the 150 political officers on the council staff have quit, the
official PAP news agency reported.
Grad said all the branch unions quit to become independent un
ions under the Gdansk settlement six weeks ago that ended the
nationwide summer strikes. The walkouts began when the gov
ernment withdrew meat price subsidies on July 1. As part of the
settlement two months later, the communist regime agreed to al
low formation of unions free of party control for the first time in
the Soviet Bloc.
Representatives of the Solidarity union federation, the off
spring of the summer strike committees, said some of the old un
ions now calling themselves independent still retained their close
ties to the party.
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an organizer for the Warsaw branch of
Solidarity, said there are now three types of unions; the true inde
pendents forged from the strike movement, the old unions now out
of the council and new "bogus unions set up by management to co
opt the movement."
He said some of the old unions are sincerely trying to get
greater autonomy from party control. But others, he said, tried to
adopt the guise of independence before organizers could form a
truly independent union that would lure away the old unions'
members.
Jenrette pledges he'll stay in race
Florence, S.C. — Rep. John Jenrette (D-S.C ), convicted last
week in the FBl's Abscam probe of official corruption, announced
Monday he will continue his campaign for re-election.
The 44-vear-old Democrat said, however, he will resign from
Congress if he loses his appeal of the conviction.
"This office is too valuable to allow anyone to win by default,"
Jenrette said, his voice breaking and his lips trembling. "There
fore I plan to remain on the ballot."
A crowd of about 75 supporters from his northeastern South
Carolina congressional district loudly applauded the announce
ment.
Jenrette. who said he sought the advice and prayers of many
people in making his decision, said there was "no perfect or rea
sonable solution."
Deukmejian to drop suits on sects
Sacramento — Attorney General George Deukmejian said yes
terday he is dropping the state's lawsuits against Synanon and the
Worldwide Church of God because a new state law will restrict his

authority over churches.
The law, signed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown but not effec
tive until next June, prevents the attorney general from suing
church leaders on the grounds that they had misused church
funds.
The Synanon suit alleges that officers of the group, including
founder Charles Dederich, misappropriated $300,000 in funds giv
en for charity.
The Church of God case alleges draining of church funds by
leaders of the Pasadena-based church, which the state has placed
in receivership.
Deukmejian's announcement came only hours after the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear arguments by the Church of God
that state prosecutors acted unconstitutionally in the "forcible
takeover" of the church and warrantless seizure of records.
Pro-Amin invaders in Uganda contained
Kampala, Uganda — Government forces have brought fighting
in Uganda's West Nile district under control after soldiers loyal to
ousted President Idi Amin invaded a week ago. Paulo Muwanga,
chairman of the nation's ruling military commission, said yester
day.
He said in a statement broadcast by Radio Uganda: "Because
of their early morning surprise attack, the invaders were able to
penetrate into Uganda's territory, and the situation appeared to
be quite grim.
"Nevertheless, a swift reinforcement to the Ugandan National
Liberation Army brought an immediate halt to the advancing in
vaders."
Muwanga said it "has been established beyond doubt" that the
attacks came from remnants of Amin's army who fled to neigh
boring Zaire and Sudan after Amin was ousted 16 months ago.
The Sudanese embassy here categorically denied Ugandan
claims that Sudan was aiding the invading force.
Ugandan Foreign Minister Otema Allimadi Sunday accused the
Sudan and Zaire of aiding troops backing Amin.
More than 10,000 troops and civilians fled Uganda to the two
neighboring countries last year when the Amin regime was over
thrown by Tanzanian and Ugandan troops.

Pro-Amin invaders in Uganda contained
Kampala, Uganda — Government forces have brought fighting
in Uganda's West Nile district under control after soldiers loyal to
ousted President Idi Amin invaded a week ago. Paulo Muwanga,
chairman of the nation's ruling military commission, said yester
day.
He said in a statement broadcast by Radio Uganda: "Because
of their early morning surprise attack, the invaders were able to
penetrate into Uganda's territory, and the situation appeared to
be quite grim.
"Nevertheless, a swift reinforcement to the Ugandan National
Liberation Army brought an immediate halt to the advancing in
vaders."
Muwanga said it "has been established beyond doubt" that the
attacks came from remnants of Amin's army who fled to neigh
boring Zaire and Sudan after Amin was ousted 16 months ago.
The Sudanese embassy here categorically denied Ugandan
claims that Sudan was aiding the invading force.
Ugandan Foreign Minister Otema Allimadi Sunday accused the
Sudan and Zaire of aiding troops backing Amin.
More than 10,000 troops and civilians fled Uganda to the two
neighboring countries last year when the Amin regime was over
thrown by Tanzanian and Ugandan troops.
Poll shows unionists agree with Reagan
Washington — A confidential AFL-CIO poll shows that despite
labor leaders' dislike for Ronald Reagan, a majority of rank-and
file union members identify with many of the Republican nomi
nee's conservative stances.
Commissioned by the AFL-ClO's political arm — the Commit
tee on Political Education — the poll found that 72 percent of un
ion members opposed cuts in defense spending, 65 percent favor a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget,
60 percent oppose the Panama Canal treaties, 51 percent oppose
strict controls on handguns, and 44 percent oppose legalized abor
tion.
The survey also found that by a 3-to-l margin, union members
blame government more than business for the country's econom
ic problems. By a 2-to-l margin, they feel there is too much gov
ernment regulation of business.
The survey was intended to aid the AFL-CIO principally in plan
ning its campaign strategy for the congressional elections.
Labor leaders are trying to counter Reagan's appeals to union
members by pointing to his record of opposition on key labor is
sues.
Stocks show modest gains
The stock market posted a modest gain in fairly active trading
yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up by more
than 6 points about midday but faded in later trading. It closed
with a gain of 2.30 points at 962.20.
One of the most spectacular stock gains in some time occurred
in the over-the-counter market where a new offering of a million
shares of Genentech, a small San Francisco-based genetic engi
neering company, started trading. The stock, offered at 35 per
share when the underwriters released it, quickly was bid up as
high as 88 a share then fell back.

Turkish hijacking attempted, stopped
Ankara, Turkey — Army sharpshooters cut through the rear
door of a hijacked jetliner in southeastern Turkey early yesterday
stormed in shooting, rescued more than 100 hostages and cap
tured five Turkish hijackers who smuggled pistols aboard in
hollowed-out Korans, the semi-official Anatolia news agency re
ported
The hijackers and some of the passengers were reported slight
ly injured in the assault, which began at 5:25 a.m. and ended a
minute later, about 11 hours after the quintet took over the Turk
ish Airlines Boeing 727
The hijackers, who posed as Iranian followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his Islamic revolution, were flown to An
kara.
Anatolia said they included two journalists, an escaped convict
who had been serving a 20-year sentence for left-wing terrorism
and an engineering student. No information about the fifth man
was given except his name.
The journalists were Yilmaz Yalciner of an Ankara economic
weekly, reportedly a member of an Islamic fundamentalist or
ganization, and Coskun Aral, an employee of a Paris photo-news
agency. Anatolia said. It said the ex-convict was named Mhemet
Ahlak and he was a member of the leftist Turkish People's Liber
ation Army
The plane was on a flight from Munich. West Germany, to An
kara. the Turkish capital. Anatolia said the hijackers smuggled
two pistols aboard in hollowed-out editions of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, and commandeered the aircraft shortly after
it took off from Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. Monday on the last leg of the
flight. Other sources said there were 148 persons aboard, all of
them Turks.
Iraqi forces prepare for siege
Basra, Iraq — Iraqi forces threatening Abadan moved more ar
mor and artillery across the Karun River but appeared to be pre
paring for a siege rather than an assault to overrun the Iranian oil
city and its giant refinery.
As the Iraqi war to win complete control of the Shatt al-Arab
estuary went into its 23rd day, Iraq's official Pars news agency
said the invaders put two more pontoon bridges across the Karun
northwest of Abadan. giving them three crossing points on the ap
proaches to the threatened city.
A British reporter who visited the area said he saw tanks, am
phibious vehicles and artillery moving across one of the bridges
"in a leisurely manner" and that the Iraqi troops were relaxed
and confident. He said the Iraqis were shelling Abadan and the
Iranians were replying with "inaccurate" fire but were getting no
air support.
Iraqi officials claimed their forces advanced three to five miles
toward Abadan. but the Western reporter said it appeared that the
Iraqis were planning a siege of Abadan and Iranian-held parts of
the port city of Khorramshahr. on the west side of Karun River's
juncture with the Shatt al-Arab.
Khorramshahr and Abadan are the two big cities on the Iranian
side of the Shatt al-Arab, Iraq's waterway to the Persian Gulf and
a major territorial issue for centuries between the Arabs of what
is now Iraq and the Persians of what is now Iran.
Iraqi troops sliced across the northern approaches to Khor
ramshahr. Iran's chief port for imports, early in the war. cutting
its road and rail lines to the rest of oil-rich Khuzistan Province,
and the establishment of the Iraqi river crossings completed the
isolation of the city.
Americans share phy&ics Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans — James Cronin of the
University of Chicago and Val Fitch of Princeton University —
won the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics yesterday for nuclear re
search that contributed to the big-bang theory of the creation of
the universe.
They were cited by the Swedish academy of Sciences "for the
discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in
the decay of neutral K-mesons." Mesons are unstable particles
first observed in cosmic rays. The big-bang theory is that the uni
verse began with a gigantic explosion and has been expanding
ever since.

Hie award carries a cash stipend of $212,000.
Cronin and Fitch made their Nobel winning discovery by stud
ies of a new type of elementary particles using a proton ac
celerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory on New York's
Long Island where they headed a research group. Their studies
probed the validity of three related symmetry principles In phys
ics, the Academy of Sciences said.
"The new truth reached by the discovery of violations of the
laws of symmetry in nature recently also has been incorporated
as an important ingredient in cosmological speculations The aim
has been to try to understand how a universe, originally very hot
and symmetric, could avoid that matter and antimatter almost
immediately annihilated each other. In other words, efforts have
been made to describe how the matter we are made of was once
created in a big bang and how it could survivethe birth pains," the
academy stated.
"The discovery emphasizes, once again, that even the most
self-evident principles in science cannot be regarded fully valid
until they have been examined in precise experiments," It added.
Poland's workers win new victories
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent trade union move
ment won another round today as the official union council pre
pared to dissolve because all its branch unions have quit It to be
come "independent."
Representatives of the independent movement charged that
some of the breakaways were still controlled bv the Communist
Party.
Mieczyslaw Grad. secretary of the once-mighty Central Coun
cil of Trade Unions, said a "liquidation commission" probably
would be formed soon to dismantle the council formally and that
some of the 150 political officers on the council staff have quit, the
official PAP news agency reported.
Grad said all the branch unions quit to become independent un
ions under the Gdansk settlement six weeks ago that ended the
nationwide summer strikes. The walkouts began when the gov
ernment withdrew meat price subsidies on July 1. As part of the
settlement two months later, the communist regime agreed to al
low formation of unions free of party control for the first time in
the Soviet Bloc.
Representatives of the Solidarity union federation, the off
spring of the summer strike committees, said some of the old un
ions now calling themselves independent still retained their close
ties to the party.
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an organizer for the Warsaw branch of
Solidarity, said there are now three types of unions; the true inde
pendents forged from the strike movement, the old unions now out
of the council and new "bogus unions set up by management to co
opt the movement."
He said some of the old unions are sincerely trying to get
greater autonomy from party control. But others, he said, tried to
adopt the guise of independence before organizers could form a
truly independent union that would lure away the old unions'
members.
Jenrette pledges he'll stay in race
Florence, S.C. — Rep. John Jenrette (D-S.C ), convicted last
week in the FBl's Abscam probe of official corruption, announced
Monday he will continue his campaign for re-election.
The 44-vear-old Democrat said, however, he will resign from
Congress if he loses his appeal of the conviction.
"This office is too valuable to allow anyone to win by default,"
Jenrette said, his voice breaking and his lips trembling. "There
fore I plan to remain on the ballot."
A crowd of about 75 supporters from his northeastern South
Carolina congressional district loudly applauded the announce
ment.
Jenrette. who said he sought the advice and prayers of many
people in making his decision, said there was "no perfect or rea
sonable solution."
Deukmejian to drop suits on sects
Sacramento — Attorney General George Deukmejian said yes
terday he is dropping the state's lawsuits against Synanon and the
Worldwide Church of God because a new state law will restrict his

authority over churches.
The law, signed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown but not effec
tive until next June, prevents the attorney general from suing
church leaders on the grounds that they had misused church
funds.
The Synanon suit alleges that officers of the group, including
founder Charles Dederich, misappropriated $300,000 in funds giv

of the council and new "bogus unions set up by management to co
opt the movement."
He said some of the old unions are sincerely trying to get
greater autonomy from party control. But others, he said, tried to
adopt the guise of independence before organizers could form a
truly independent union that would lure away the old unions'
members.

Deukmejian to drop suits on sects
Sacramento — Attorney General George Deukmejian said yes
terday he is dropping the state's lawsuits against Synanon and the
Worldwide Church of God because a new state law will restrict his

authority over churches.
The law, signed last month by Gov. Jerry Brown but not effec
tive until next June, prevents the attorney general from suing
church leaders on the grounds that they had misused church
funds.
The Synanon suit alleges that officers of the group, including
founder Charles Dederich, misappropriated $300,000 in funds giv
en for charity.
The Church of God case alleges draining of church funds by
leaders of the Pasadena-based church, which the state has placed
in receivership.
Deukmejian's announcement came only hours after the U.S.
Supreme Court refused to hear arguments by the Church of God
that state prosecutors acted unconstitutionally in the "forcible
takeover" of the church and warrantless seizure of records.
Pro-Amin invaders in Uganda contained
Kampala, Uganda — Government forces have brought fighting
in Uganda's West Nile district under control after soldiers loyal to
ousted President Idi Amin invaded a week ago. Paulo Muwanga,
chairman of the nation's ruling military commission, said yester
day.
He said in a statement broadcast by Radio Uganda: "Because
of their early morning surprise attack, the invaders were able to
penetrate into Uganda's territory, and the situation appeared to
be quite grim.
"Nevertheless, a swift reinforcement to the Ugandan National
Liberation Army brought an immediate halt to the advancing in
vaders."
Muwanga said it "has been established beyond doubt" that the
attacks came from remnants of Amin's army who fled to neigh
boring Zaire and Sudan after Amin was ousted 16 months ago.
The Sudanese embassy here categorically denied Ugandan
claims that Sudan was aiding the invading force.
Ugandan Foreign Minister Otema Allimadi Sunday accused the
Sudan and Zaire of aiding troops backing Amin.
More than 10,000 troops and civilians fled Uganda to the two
neighboring countries last year when the Amin regime was over
thrown by Tanzanian and Ugandan troops.
Poll shows unionists agree with Reagan
Washington — A confidential AFL-CIO poll shows that despite
labor leaders' dislike for Ronald Reagan, a majority of rank-and
file union members identify with many of the Republican nomi
nee's conservative stances.
Commissioned by the AFL-ClO's political arm — the Commit
tee on Political Education — the poll found that 72 percent of un
ion members opposed cuts in defense spending, 65 percent favor a
constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget,
60 percent oppose the Panama Canal treaties, 51 percent oppose
strict controls on handguns, and 44 percent oppose legalized abor
tion.
The survey also found that by a 3-to-l margin, union members
blame government more than business for the country's econom
ic problems. By a 2-to-l margin, they feel there is too much gov
ernment regulation of business.
The survey was intended to aid the AFL-CIO principally in plan
ning its campaign strategy for the congressional elections.
Labor leaders are trying to counter Reagan's appeals to union
members by pointing to his record of opposition on key labor is
sues.

Turkish hijacking attempted, stopped
Ankara, Turkey — Army sharpshooters cut through the rear
door of a hijacked jetliner in southeastern Turkey early yesterday
stormed in shooting, rescued more than 100 hostages and cap
tured five Turkish hijackers who smuggled pistols aboard in
hollowed-out Korans, the semi-official Anatolia news agency re
ported
The hijackers and some of the passengers were reported slight
ly injured in the assault, which began at 5:25 a.m. and ended a
minute later, about 11 hours after the quintet took over the Turk
ish Airlines Boeing 727
The hijackers, who posed as Iranian followers of Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his Islamic revolution, were flown to An
kara.
Anatolia said they included two journalists, an escaped convict
who had been serving a 20-year sentence for left-wing terrorism
and an engineering student. No information about the fifth man
was given except his name.
The journalists were Yilmaz Yalciner of an Ankara economic
weekly, reportedly a member of an Islamic fundamentalist or
ganization, and Coskun Aral, an employee of a Paris photo-news
agency. Anatolia said. It said the ex-convict was named Mhemet
Ahlak and he was a member of the leftist Turkish People's Liber
ation Army
The plane was on a flight from Munich. West Germany, to An
kara. the Turkish capital. Anatolia said the hijackers smuggled
two pistols aboard in hollowed-out editions of the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, and commandeered the aircraft shortly after
it took off from Istanbul at 6:15 p.m. Monday on the last leg of the
flight. Other sources said there were 148 persons aboard, all of
them Turks.
Iraqi forces prepare for siege
Basra, Iraq — Iraqi forces threatening Abadan moved more ar
mor and artillery across the Karun River but appeared to be pre
paring for a siege rather than an assault to overrun the Iranian oil
city and its giant refinery.
As the Iraqi war to win complete control of the Shatt al-Arab
estuary went into its 23rd day, Iraq's official Pars news agency
said the invaders put two more pontoon bridges across the Karun
northwest of Abadan. giving them three crossing points on the ap
proaches to the threatened city.
A British reporter who visited the area said he saw tanks, am
phibious vehicles and artillery moving across one of the bridges
"in a leisurely manner" and that the Iraqi troops were relaxed
and confident. He said the Iraqis were shelling Abadan and the
Iranians were replying with "inaccurate" fire but were getting no
air support.
Iraqi officials claimed their forces advanced three to five miles
toward Abadan. but the Western reporter said it appeared that the
Iraqis were planning a siege of Abadan and Iranian-held parts of
the port city of Khorramshahr. on the west side of Karun River's
juncture with the Shatt al-Arab.
Khorramshahr and Abadan are the two big cities on the Iranian
side of the Shatt al-Arab, Iraq's waterway to the Persian Gulf and
a major territorial issue for centuries between the Arabs of what
is now Iraq and the Persians of what is now Iran.
Iraqi troops sliced across the northern approaches to Khor
ramshahr. Iran's chief port for imports, early in the war. cutting
its road and rail lines to the rest of oil-rich Khuzistan Province,
and the establishment of the Iraqi river crossings completed the
isolation of the city.
Americans share phy&ics Nobel Prize
Stockholm, Sweden — Two Americans — James Cronin of the
University of Chicago and Val Fitch of Princeton University —
won the 1980 Nobel Prize in physics yesterday for nuclear re
search that contributed to the big-bang theory of the creation of
the universe.
They were cited by the Swedish academy of Sciences "for the
discovery of violations of fundamental symmetry principles in
the decay of neutral K-mesons." Mesons are unstable particles
first observed in cosmic rays. The big-bang theory is that the uni
verse began with a gigantic explosion and has been expanding
ever since.

Hie award carries a cash stipend of $212,000.
Cronin and Fitch made their Nobel winning discovery by stud
ies of a new type of elementary particles using a proton ac
celerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory on New York's
Long Island where they headed a research group. Their studies
probed the validity of three related symmetry principles In phys
ics, the Academy of Sciences said.
"The new truth reached by the discovery of violations of the
laws of symmetry in nature recently also has been incorporated
as an important ingredient in cosmological speculations The aim
has been to try to understand how a universe, originally very hot
and symmetric, could avoid that matter and antimatter almost
immediately annihilated each other. In other words, efforts have
been made to describe how the matter we are made of was once
created in a big bang and how it could survivethe birth pains," the
academy stated.
"The discovery emphasizes, once again, that even the most
self-evident principles in science cannot be regarded fully valid
until they have been examined in precise experiments," It added.
Poland's workers win new victories
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's independent trade union move
ment won another round today as the official union council pre
pared to dissolve because all its branch unions have quit It to be
come "independent."
Representatives of the independent movement charged that
some of the breakaways were still controlled bv the Communist
Party.
Mieczyslaw Grad. secretary of the once-mighty Central Coun
cil of Trade Unions, said a "liquidation commission" probably
would be formed soon to dismantle the council formally and that
some of the 150 political officers on the council staff have quit, the
official PAP news agency reported.
Grad said all the branch unions quit to become independent un
ions under the Gdansk settlement six weeks ago that ended the
nationwide summer strikes. The walkouts began when the gov
ernment withdrew meat price subsidies on July 1. As part of the
settlement two months later, the communist regime agreed to al
low formation of unions free of party control for the first time in
the Soviet Bloc.
Representatives of the Solidarity union federation, the off
spring of the summer strike committees, said some of the old un
ions now calling themselves independent still retained their close
ties to the party.
Janusz Onyszkiewicz, an organizer for the Warsaw branch of
Solidarity, said there are now three types of unions; the true inde
pendents forged from the strike movement, the old unions now out
of the council and new "bogus unions set up by management to co
opt the movement."
He said some of the old unions are sincerely trying to get
