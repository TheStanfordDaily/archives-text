## 
### 
From Daily and wire service reports
Washington — President Jimmy Carter yesterday
signed into law a bill which will prevent unannounced po
lice searches of newsrooms.
The bill, which was Congress's response to the Supreme
Court's decision in Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, permits po
lice to gather information from journalists only through
voluntary cooperation or with a subpoena, which allows
both parties the chance to argue in court before material is
turned over.
Police may use search warrants only when the person
possessing the material has committed or is committing a
criminal act, when immediate seizure is needed to prevent
death or serious injury, when the material would be de
stroyed or altered if the advance notice of a subpoena were
given, when a subpoena has been denied and further appeal
would threaten the interests of justice, and under certain
conditions when the material is classified.
More than 20 bill were introduced in Congress after the
Supreme Court reversed lower federal courts in 1978 and
ruled that the 1971 raid by Palo Alto police on the Daily's
offices did not violate the First or Fourth Amendments.

The bill that was passed a few days ago protects journal
ists, scholars, and those engaging in First Amendment ac
tivities.
The new law also requires the U.S. Attorney General to
draw up guidelinesconcerning how federal law enforce
ment agents may conduct searches against other non-sus
pect, including lawyers, doctors and clergy, all of whom
have their confidentiality protected by law.
Since the Supreme Court ruled against the Daily, at
least 12 searches have been conducted in eight states
against lawyers, doctors, and journalists. Prior to the Su
preme Court's ruling, police conducted 14 raids against
journalists in seven years.
In a written statement, Carter said the Supreme Court's
decision "could have a chilling effect on the ability of re
porters to develop sources and pursue stories. Ever since
the court's decision, my administration has been working
with Congress to prevent this result by enacting legisla
tion."
He said the bill "provides important civil liberties pro
tections without hampering legitimate law enforcement
investigations."
