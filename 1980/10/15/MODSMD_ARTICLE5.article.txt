# Award for how genes recombine

"I've won a number of awards."
said Dr. Paul Berg. "It's nice when
they come, but it isn't everything. You
see, for the scientist, it's the thrill of
learning something new and it's all
that more rewarding when one's peers
and colleagues recognize something
you've accomplished."
Berg spoke these philosophic words
Monday, less than 24 hours before he
learned of winning this year's Nobel
Prize for Chemistry.
On Monday, however, he was re
flecting upon another honor, a $15,000
award from the Gairdner Foundation
of Canada, announced last week
For some three decades. Berg's
work has involved clarifying how the
master of heredity. DN A (short for de
oxyribonucleic acid) translates its ge
netic information into protein
molecules—which are among the
most abundant organic molecules in
living organisms.
Berg came to Stanford in 1959 to
continue research on protein svm
thesis. In 1972. he and his associates
used a technique for constructing a
"recombinant" DNA molecule. The
molecule contained DNA from a virus
and the DNA of the E Coli bacterium.
The recombinant DNA molecule
could be inserted into animal cells to
see how the cells integrated foreign
DNA and expressed it in the prod
uction of protein molecules.
This marked the beginning of "man
made" living matter
One of the big questions was—and is
—would man eventually insert recom
binant DNA molecules into his own
cells to mitigate the harmful effects of
hereditary genetic diseases?
Moreover, could the insertion of the
DNA alter the genes in a haphazard,
potentially lethal fashion?
In 1974. Berg chaired a meeting of
the National Academy of Sciences to
survey the potential hazards of genet
ic research The result of the meeting
was another meeting in Feb. 1975. In
1976, the National Institute of Health
issued a set of guidelines that put cer-
