# Cardinal Club scholarships Stanford's women athletes
## 
### Richard Beames 
Male athletes at Stanford like tennis stars John
McEnroe, Roscoe Tanner, Gene and Sandy
Mayer, and current No. 1 player Tim Mayotte
have long been supported by athletic scholar
ships. Without these scholarships, the Cardinals
probably could not have won five NCAA team
tennis titles in eight years.
Since 1978, Cardinal women athletes also have
gained scholarship benefits through an organiza
tion called the Cardinal Club. The same year
Kathy Jordan led the women's tennis team to its
first ever AIAW title.
The Cardinal Club is funded exclusively by
private donations from alumni and friends of
Stanford. All donations are used for scholarship
gifts to women athletes from all over the coun
try.
The Cardinal Club is unique because it receives
no money from student fees.
At UC-Berkeley, for example, scholarships are
funded primarily by student registration fees.
Out of the $1 million earmarked for athletic
scholarships at Cal, $877,000 come from these
fees, according to a spokesperson at Berkeley's
scholarship office.
In contrast to the Buck Club, which has funded
men's scholarships here since 1934 through simi
lar private donations, the Cardinal Club is only in
its infancy.

Although only three years old, it has grown
from an initial steering committee of twelve to a
membership of over 1200 friends and donors.
In 1977 a forerunner to the Cardinal Club raised
$34,000 for women's scholarships. In 1979-80 the
Cardinal Club raised $210,000 and its goal for this
year is over $300,000.
"Women should have the same opportunity to
excel and extend themselves in sports as the
men. And at Stanford you have people who want
to excel. So women should be given as much sup
port.'' said Cardinal Club Director Diane Har
rison. "The results show that support for wom
en's athletics is growing."
The Cardinal Club raises funds through a
number of techniques. Associate Director of Ath
letics Doug Single said he has received calls from
over 100 colleges throughout the country in
terested in details of creative Cardinal Club fun
draisers.
"The Cardinal Club is not only the most suc
cessful women's athletics fundraising organiza
tion around, it is also responsible for the increase
in the visibility of women's athletics na
tionwide," said Single.
One such fundraiser organized by the Cardinal
Club last year was a celebrity pro-am golf tour
nament featuring featuring Jim Plunkett and
other Oakland Raiders. According to Harrison,
the golf tournament raised $10,500.

Last June, the Cardinal Club solicited coaches
and professors to donate their time for a week
long adult "back-to-college" program in which
participants paid $250 to attend a series of lec
tures and sports clinics. This program was re
sponsible for about $4500 in donations, according
to Harrison.
Events planned for this vearinclude the much
publicized Great Race scheduled for this Sunday,
Oct. 19, and a program called "Coming Up Win
ners."
The latter is a dinnner and auction to be held
Nov. 7 at Maples Pavilion. The $35 donation in
cludes cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, entertainment,
a drawing for a week in Hawaii, and dinner, as
well as the chance to participate in an auction.
Items to be sold include more than 40 ski vaca
tions, 12 Rose Bowl tickets, a four-door diesel
Volkswagen Rabbit and over fifty comparable
items. All the merchandise comes through dona
tions solicited by past Cardinal Club Director
Linda Meier.
Much of the success of Stanford women's ath
letics directly depends on such events as the
Great Race and "Coming Up Winners, " because
the amount of revenue these events yield directly
correlates to the quality of athlete that can be en
ticed to attend Stanford, according to Cardinal
coaches.

its infancy.

Although only three years old, it has grown
from an initial steering committee of twelve to a
membership of over 1200 friends and donors.
In 1977 a forerunner to the Cardinal Club raised
$34,000 for women's scholarships. In 1979-80 the
Cardinal Club raised $210,000 and its goal for this
year is over $300,000.
"Women should have the same opportunity to
excel and extend themselves in sports as the
men. And at Stanford you have people who want
to excel. So women should be given as much sup
port.'' said Cardinal Club Director Diane Har
rison. "The results show that support for wom
en's athletics is growing."
The Cardinal Club raises funds through a
number of techniques. Associate Director of Ath
letics Doug Single said he has received calls from
over 100 colleges throughout the country in
terested in details of creative Cardinal Club fun
draisers.
"The Cardinal Club is not only the most suc
cessful women's athletics fundraising organiza
tion around, it is also responsible for the increase
in the visibility of women's athletics na
tionwide," said Single.
One such fundraiser organized by the Cardinal
Club last year was a celebrity pro-am golf tour
nament featuring featuring Jim Plunkett and
other Oakland Raiders. According to Harrison,
the golf tournament raised $10,500.

Last June, the Cardinal Club solicited coaches
and professors to donate their time for a week
long adult "back-to-college" program in which
participants paid $250 to attend a series of lec
tures and sports clinics. This program was re
sponsible for about $4500 in donations, according
to Harrison.
Events planned for this vearinclude the much
publicized Great Race scheduled for this Sunday,
Oct. 19, and a program called "Coming Up Win
ners."
The latter is a dinnner and auction to be held
Nov. 7 at Maples Pavilion. The $35 donation in
cludes cocktails, hors d'oeuvres, entertainment,
a drawing for a week in Hawaii, and dinner, as
well as the chance to participate in an auction.
Items to be sold include more than 40 ski vaca
tions, 12 Rose Bowl tickets, a four-door diesel
Volkswagen Rabbit and over fifty comparable
items. All the merchandise comes through dona
tions solicited by past Cardinal Club Director
Linda Meier.
Much of the success of Stanford women's ath
letics directly depends on such events as the
Great Race and "Coming Up Winners, " because
the amount of revenue these events yield directly
correlates to the quality of athlete that can be en
ticed to attend Stanford, according to Cardinal
coaches.
Male athletes at Stanford like tennis stars John
McEnroe, Roscoe Tanner, Gene and Sandy
Mayer, and current No. 1 player Tim Mayotte
have long been supported by athletic scholar
ships. Without these scholarships, the Cardinals
probably could not have won five NCAA team
tennis titles in eight years.
Since 1978, Cardinal women athletes also have
gained scholarship benefits through an organiza
tion called the Cardinal Club. The same year
Kathy Jordan led the women's tennis team to its
first ever AIAW title.
The Cardinal Club is funded exclusively by
private donations from alumni and friends of
Stanford. All donations are used for scholarship
gifts to women athletes from all over the coun
try.
The Cardinal Club is unique because it receives
no money from student fees.
At UC-Berkeley, for example, scholarships are
funded primarily by student registration fees.
Out of the $1 million earmarked for athletic
scholarships at Cal, $877,000 come from these
fees, according to a spokesperson at Berkeley's
scholarship office.
In contrast to the Buck Club, which has funded
men's scholarships here since 1934 through simi
lar private donations, the Cardinal Club is only in
its infancy.

Although only three years old, it has grown
from an initial steering committee of twelve to a
membership of over 1200 friends and donors.
