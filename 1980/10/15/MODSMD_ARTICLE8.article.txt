# Zimbabwe tries integrated armed forces
## 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Zim
babwe. a country born from the
inferno of a seven-year guerrilla
war. has embarked on the dif
ficult process of forming an in
tegrated army from elements of
the three forces that fought so
bitterly.
It is somewhat akin to the
U.S. government a century ago
seeking to unify the Union and
Confederate armies six months
after the Civil War.
By the end of December —
just one year after the con
clusion of the bloody Rhodesian
bush war — more than 13.000
troops are scheduled to be inte
grated from the rival guerrilla
forces of Robert Mugabe and
Joshua Nkomo and the white-led
army that fought them to main
tain white power in the southern
African nation Other joint units
are to be formed next year,
bringing the total professional
force up to about 20.000
Persons familiar with the
program, including whites who
are quitting the military, say
privately that it has been trou
ble-free so far.
They hedge their remarks by
noting that there have been a
number of violent clashes in
volving dissidents from the
former guerrilla armies. None
of the incidents, however, has
involved troops participating in
the integration process.
If the program succeeds, it
will be a major achievement for
the country's first black-ma
jority government led by Prime
Minister Mugabe. A unified
army would help greatly to re
turn the country to peace and

stability, thus encouraging for
eign investment and aid
Some of the problems faced in
the integration program are:
—Years of racial bitterness
over the issue of black-majority
rule.
— Traditional tribal
hostilities between Mugabe's
Shona-based forces and
Nkomo's troops, who are domi
nated by the minority Ndebele
tribe
—The need to convert the
former guerrillas from a politi
cal force into a professional
army loyal to the government of
the day.
—The fears of many soldiers
that they would not be able to
find a place in the new Army
since Zimbabwe, as a result of
the war. still has upward of
55.000 people under arms in a na
tion of only about 7 million.
Both African sides held back
their best troops when the inte
gration process began in Febru
ary while the country was still
under temporary British admin
istration, the source said.
Since then, five 1000-man bat
talions have been formed with
equal numbers from Mugabe's
and Nkomo's forces. Four more
such battalions are to finish
training by December. These
are to be joined by three from
the former white-led Rhodesian
Army to form four brigades. In
tegration at the battalion level
is scheduled for next year.
This, according to a white
former Rhodesian colonel,
could be "a major stumbling
block." Other sources said that
the desire by all to stay in the
military should help in carrying

off the unification successfully.
Already there are a number
of cases of informal integration.
Members of the Rhodesian
African Rifles and their white
officers are patrolling with
units of the new army since
Mugabe deployed them last
week to help the police in put
ting down violence.
The integrated forces are
having to deal with their former
comrades in arms, but a mili
tary source said that "there is
no question they work for the
state. They are not political
animals."
A major shootout could test
this belief, however.
One stabilizing factor for the
training program, in which 130
British military specialists are
assisting, is that there has not
been the mass exodus of white
personnel that had been widely
expected in the event of a
Mugabe victory
Conscription, which took in
upward of 1000 whites a year
during the war. has been ended
with the last draftees scheduled
to be released by March Ten
thousand white reservists are
still technically liable for active
duty for more than six months a
year, but, in effect, the system
is being allowed to lapse with
only a few needed specialists
being called up.
The former guerrillas are re
ported to have adapted readily
to the British spit-and-polish
tradition familiar to the Rhode
sian forces. Over time the tradi
tion is bound to be modified,
however, in view of Mugabe's
leaning toward a Chinese-style
army designed to play a role in

agricultural and community de
velopment.
The Army has already em
barked on the Chinese model
with the launching of operation
SEED (soldiers employed in ec
onomic development).
Some 9000 soldiers are al
ready involved in three agricul
tural projects and eventually it
is hoped that the program will
absorb upward of 30,000 troops
who will not qualify for the regu
lar force.

and Nkomo's forces. Four more
such battalions are to finish
training by December. These
are to be joined by three from
the former white-led Rhodesian
Army to form four brigades. In
tegration at the battalion level
is scheduled for next year.
This, according to a white
former Rhodesian colonel,
could be "a major stumbling
block." Other sources said that
the desire by all to stay in the
military should help in carrying

off the unification successfully.
Already there are a number
of cases of informal integration.
Members of the Rhodesian
African Rifles and their white
officers are patrolling with
units of the new army since
Mugabe deployed them last
week to help the police in put
ting down violence.
The integrated forces are
having to deal with their former
comrades in arms, but a mili
tary source said that "there is
no question they work for the
state. They are not political
animals."
A major shootout could test
this belief, however.
One stabilizing factor for the
training program, in which 130
British military specialists are
assisting, is that there has not
been the mass exodus of white
personnel that had been widely
expected in the event of a
Mugabe victory
Conscription, which took in
upward of 1000 whites a year
during the war. has been ended
with the last draftees scheduled
to be released by March Ten
thousand white reservists are
still technically liable for active
duty for more than six months a
year, but, in effect, the system
is being allowed to lapse with
only a few needed specialists
being called up.
The former guerrillas are re
ported to have adapted readily
to the British spit-and-polish
tradition familiar to the Rhode
sian forces. Over time the tradi
tion is bound to be modified,
however, in view of Mugabe's
leaning toward a Chinese-style
army designed to play a role in

agricultural and community de
velopment.
The Army has already em
barked on the Chinese model
with the launching of operation
SEED (soldiers employed in ec
onomic development).
Some 9000 soldiers are al

Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Zim
babwe. a country born from the
inferno of a seven-year guerrilla
war. has embarked on the dif
ficult process of forming an in
tegrated army from elements of
the three forces that fought so
bitterly.
It is somewhat akin to the
U.S. government a century ago
seeking to unify the Union and
Confederate armies six months
after the Civil War.
By the end of December —
just one year after the con
clusion of the bloody Rhodesian
bush war — more than 13.000
troops are scheduled to be inte
grated from the rival guerrilla
forces of Robert Mugabe and
Joshua Nkomo and the white-led
army that fought them to main
tain white power in the southern
African nation Other joint units
are to be formed next year,
bringing the total professional
force up to about 20.000
Persons familiar with the
program, including whites who
are quitting the military, say
privately that it has been trou
ble-free so far.
They hedge their remarks by
noting that there have been a
number of violent clashes in
volving dissidents from the
former guerrilla armies. None
of the incidents, however, has
involved troops participating in
the integration process.
If the program succeeds, it
will be a major achievement for
the country's first black-ma
jority government led by Prime
Minister Mugabe. A unified
army would help greatly to re
turn the country to peace and

stability, thus encouraging for
eign investment and aid
Some of the problems faced in
the integration program are:
—Years of racial bitterness
over the issue of black-majority
rule.
— Traditional tribal
hostilities between Mugabe's
Shona-based forces and
Nkomo's troops, who are domi
nated by the minority Ndebele
tribe
—The need to convert the
former guerrillas from a politi
cal force into a professional
army loyal to the government of
the day.
—The fears of many soldiers
that they would not be able to
find a place in the new Army
since Zimbabwe, as a result of
the war. still has upward of
55.000 people under arms in a na
tion of only about 7 million.
Both African sides held back
their best troops when the inte
gration process began in Febru
ary while the country was still
under temporary British admin
istration, the source said.
Since then, five 1000-man bat
talions have been formed with
equal numbers from Mugabe's
