# Communist leader Kania tested in Poland's crisis
## 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland — Shortly after his surprise
election last month as leader of the Polish Com
munist Party. Stanislaw Kania remarked that he
felt he had one overriding mission It was to
ensure that Poland would never again experience
a repetition of the social, economic, and moral
crisis that brought it to what he described as "the
verge of national catastrophe."
Five weeks later, the theme of "it must never
happen again" still recurs in the new leader's
speeches around the country. But. as problems
pile up and the economy slides deeper into debt, a
more immediate preoccupation appears to be
troubling him. It is simply this: how to extricate
Poland from its present crisis.
There are arguably few politicians in power to
day who face such a plethora of troubles as the 53-
year-old Kania. He has to deal with a divided par
ty bureaucracy anxious to retain its power and
privileges, assertive opposition from the the Ro
man Catholic Church and newly independent
trade unions, and a Soviet leadership suspicious of
any dramatic change of course.
To complicate his balancing act still further, he
is attempting to win the trust of a thoroughly skep
tical population at a time when there is little to
buy in the shops — despite big pay raises granted
over the last few months.
Precarious position
In short. Kania's room for maneuver is limited.
His position is certainly more precarious than
that of either of his disgraced predecessors, Ed
ward Gierek and Wladvslaw Gomulka, when they
came to power in 1970 and 1956 respectively. Both
men started off with a good deal of public con
fidence and an economy in much better shape than
it is now.
Addressing a stormy session of the party's Cen
tral Committee a week ago. Kania reminded
Poles that the crisis is not yet over and Poland
faces enormous economic problems and numer
ous threats to its stability.
Much will depend on the skill displayed by
Kania, a former village blacksmith who rose qui
etly through all levels of the communist ap
paratus. While totally lacking charisma, he does
have other qualities — such as simplicity, or
ganizational ability, and a sense of fairness — that
could be valuable assets if he is given a chance to
display them.
Kania has remained a shadowy figure. His ap
pointment as Gierek's successor drew little reac
tion from ordinary Poles, either negative or
positive.
In fact. Kania's origins are not as obscure as all
that. For the last 10 years, he was an influential
member of the Polish leadership His responsi

bilities included security, the Army, and relations
with the Catholic Church.
As security chief. Kania won a reputation for
moderation and good sense. He also won some
firm friends as a result of his interventions with
the police on behalf of people who were unjustly
harassed or under suspicion A writer, whom
Kania helped, spoke highly of his sense of justice.
A senior church official recalled that Kania
took a tough line during negotiations before the
pope's visit to Poland in 1979 But he added: "He
was. after all, the policeman." Other sources said
Kania had helped improve church-state relations
by insisting that the pope should be allowed to re
turn to his homeland, albeit on strict conditions.
Dangers ahead
Given Kania s own temperament and the Polish
people's disillusionment with all politicians, this
was probably the only sensible way to proceed.
But it has its dangers. The most obvious is that,
instead of leading the country out of the crisis,
Kania could become a prisoner of a party ap
paratus deeply resistant to change.
Kania did come out in favor of reforms. But his
approach was cautious and did not go nearly as far
as the reformists had hoped. He also failed to sug
gest any specific date for the congress because
Central Committee members were not prepared
to vote for their own dismissal.
Compromise
The inevitable result was compromise. Kania
had managed to nudge the party one step further
toward reforming itself. Several Gierek aides had
been made scapegoats for past "mistakes" but no
decisive strategy was mapped out.
One of the politicians Kania needs to get on his
side if he is to push his ideas is the controversial
former security chief, Gen. Mieczyslaw Moczar.
Now 67, Moczar led an anti-Zionist campaign dur
ing the 1960s and helped suppress student unrest. |
After nine years in the political wilderness,
Moczar is once again a force to be reckoned with.
In what appeared to be largely a sinecure as chair
man of the Supreme Control Commission, he qui
etly accumulated evidence of misdeeds in high
places. Under Gierek. there was not much he
could do with the information — but suddenly it
has become valuable ammunition for use against
his former enemies.
Working largely behind the scenes, Kania has
tried to shape a new coalition within the party.
For the moment, he has retained the trust of the
Kremlin. But. with the party still in disarray, the
pace of Polish politics has been set bv Solidarity,
the new independent union led by Lech Walesa,
which has maintained an unremitting pressure on
the authorities.
