New from Seiko.
The Analog Quartz Alarm.
Now, for the very first
time, Seiko's unsurpassed
technology produces a
watch that combines
traditional, elegant styling
with the modern
convenience of a versatile
alarm. The alarm itself is
an extraordinary
innovation. It rings once at
the pre-set time, then rings
continuously, increasing in
volume for 2N seconds.
This sleek timepiece also
features a day/date
display, bilingual
English/Spanish calendar,
and is water-tested to 100
feet. $1.95.
