# Senate cuts off Special Events
## 
### Peter Finch 
The ASSU Senate voted unanimous
ly to terminate the ASSU's Special
Events program last night, bringing to
an end an organization which had lost
money in nine of its 10 years here.
In his brief recommendation to the
senate. Finance Committee Chairman
(iarv Keiff pointed out the positive
and negative aspects of shutting down
the program, ending with his commit
tee's suggestion to close it.
A task force to evaluate Special
Events and investigate the possibility
of a new means of providing contem
porary entertainment on campus was
set up last week. Reiff stressed the im
portance of giving the task force a
"blank piece of paper to work from."
"They can start fresh." he con
tinued. "They can try new proposals
and not worry about making some
Special Kvents form.'
Reiff also attested to the credibility
of the task force, claiming that it is not
being given an impossible job.
"We've seen them (task forces)
work in the past." he said, citing last
year's Coffee House task force as an
example.
By January?
Although the committee's motion to
the senate merely stated that the task
force is to "report back to the senate
by the end of fall quarter on the poten
tial of a future ASSU-operated enter
tainment-producing agent." Reiff
said there is a "very, very good
chance that this study will produce a
new project that can be in operation by
January" and that "the potential for
concerts by the spring is high."
Discussion on the issue was ex
tremely limited — Senator Kelly Rat-"
tertv pointed out Special Events ob
vious "structural problems" — before
the question was called and the motion
unanimously approved.
Mascot issue
Other business in last night's meet
ing included a report from the Sen
ate's Student Affairs Committee on its
plans for dealing with the continuing
mascot controversy.
Assistant Student Affairs Chairman
Jeff Bradach introduced freshman
Phillip Chalk, who had drawn up a
series of representations of several
popular mascot possibilities.
It is the committee's intention to
use Chalk's drawings to rally support
for choosing a mascot and ending the
conflict.
The committee's immediate con
cern. Bradach explained, is this Satur
day's football game.
"We'll be polling students at the
game for new ideas,"Bradach said.
"We need to get some new ideas (for a
mascot i." That way, he claimed, the
students may be able to find some
thing they really like.
Besides polling. Bradach went on.
volunteers will distribute yellow
armbands to be worn by students as
symbols of their desire to find a new
mascot.
