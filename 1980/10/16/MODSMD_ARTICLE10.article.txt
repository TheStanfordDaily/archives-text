# Japan develops high technology industry

### Washington Post 
Hino, Japan — To the layman, the scene
on Fujitsu Fanuc Ltd s shop floor in this in
dustrial suburb offers a baffling glimpse
into .Japan's new age of industrial technolo
gy
The mechanical hands of computer-guid
ed robots shift hunks of metal into the jaws
of machines that cut. trim and drill them
into finished machine-tool motors with a
precision that once required 20 vears of
training for a human being
In one corner, a lone robot tends three
machining centers and a drill and it does not
stop when the lights go out at quitting time
A switch is flipped bv departing workers —
there are only 10 of them in the whole shop -
and the robots keep working for another
four or five hours.
A year ago. the 10 workers and 10 robots
turned out 3 500 motors Another 15 robots
were added and production nearly doubled
in one year
But company officials explain that is old
stuff now. The new work is going on in
Fanuc's research labs, where a full one
fourth of the company's employees are de
signing even more potent technology One
goal, it is casually explained, is the first fac

tory totally operated by robots.
In a major new industrial offensive.
•Japan has designated the 1980s as the era of
creative technology in which it will take the
lead in some of the most sophisticated fields
computers, semiconductors, robots —
;ind the industries in which they are applied.
The drawing boards abound with new ma
chines with new applications — robots
whose mechanical hands work on the ocean
floors or in stilling temperatures where
man cannot, machines that can be talked to
and that can talk back, computers whose
work loads dwarf the present generation's,
and robots that make robots.
In several fields, the Japanese will be
clashing directly with Americans, who his
torically have held the edge in developing
new industrial technology, if not always in
applying it Some authorities envision a new
trade war looming, a more fundamental
Japanese challenge than the two countries'
past feuding over textiles, automobiles, and
steel
The new wave is the third for Japan's
postwar economy, now tho second-largest
in the non-communist world. First came the
industrial staples such as steel mills, power

generators and petrochemical plants. In the
19705. .Japan pressed ahead in big consumer
products such as automobiles and elec
tronics In both of those waves, the basic
technology was bought or borrowed from
the United States and Europe and what
brought Japan , its leadership was its in
genuity in applying that technology to pro
duce goods.
The third wave, planners say. will be
based on indigenous technology, often de
veloped with government subsidies. A vi
sionary projection compiled by the govern
ment's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry this year observes that little
lurther application is to be found for im
ported technology and proposes that Japan
build its own future with home-grown re
search and development of "original tech
nologies."
Hard economics dictate the shift, in part.
Other flourishing Asian countries such as
Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan are
catching up with Japan in several fields and,
because of lower wage scales, are starting
to compete strenuously. Japan is per
petuullv worried about energy supplies and
the "knowledge-intensive" fields are
smaller users of oil and coal
