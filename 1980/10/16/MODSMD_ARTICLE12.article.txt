# Campaign silliness high in custom 727
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
San Jose — When Tim
Crawford turned 28 recently,
his friends threw a slam
bang birthday party com
plete with paper streamers,
funny hats, ice cream and
cake, a chocolate replica of
Dolly Parton and a life-size,
blow-up rubber doll named
Estelle.
And they did it all aboard a
customized Boeing 727
whizzing between here and
Seattle.
Crawford and some 200 of
his closest and newest
friends are part of Ronald
Reagan's parade, the trav
eling road show that is a
presidential campaign. It is a
high-pressure, jet-age time
capsule in which zany birth
day parties are but one way
to cope with a dizzying, nine
week artificial existence.
The world of presidential
campaigns is a world of 18-
hour work days, perpetual
jet lag. and endless proces
sions of sterile hotel rooms
that tend to make even the
sanest and smartest go a lit

continental Mardi Gras, a
world that makes Montv
