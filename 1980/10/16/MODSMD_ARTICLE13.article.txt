# Study links high IQs with success
## 
### Kathy Shell 
In 1922. the late Lewis Terman began a
study of "exceptional' children — young
sters with IQs above 135 — to see if they
were superior in other ways
But now. almost 60 years after the longi
tudinal study was begun, the children have
grown up and the study has turned into re
search on the problems of aging and self
fulfillment.
Terman, the Stanford psychologist who
developed the Stanford-Binet intelligence
test, began the study by selecting 1470 chil
dren from the California public school sys
tem.
The group contained 857 boys and 671 girls
whose IQs placed them in the top 1 percent
of the population. Kiftv-eight younger sibl
ings of this first group were added to the
study later.
The participants were tested and in
terviewed. along with their parents and
teachers, at the beginning of the study and
again in 1928. The results showed a slight
correlation between high IQ and success.
Participants did somewhat better in school,
possessed greater leadership qualities and
were bigger, healthier and more social than
the control group, according to Robert
Sears, co-director of the project and a pro
fessor emeritus of psychology here.
Gifted children programs
Research like the Terman study and oth
ers has contributed to the growth of "gifted

children programs, said Sears. At the time
Terman began his study, such programs
were, for the most part, non-existent
This year, according to Psychology To
day. the Federal Office of the Gifted and
Talented, created by Congress in 1972, will
have a budget of $6 28 million An additional
$10 million will come from other federal leg
islation and agencies, the magazine said
"It (the Terman study) has made a great
difference," said Sears. "There have been
lots of changes in state laws for educational
support and special state funds for the
gifted,"
At least 14 states now mandate special
education for gifted children in all public
schools The funding for this will amount to
about $100 million this vear.
Continued success?
After Terman completed his initial re
search. he continued to monitor the lives of
the study members. He wished to see if their
early promise would continue, and what
kind of experiences and conditions con
tribute to happiness later in life.
Terman died in 1956, but the study con
tinued
Participants are contacted every five
years. The most recent contact was in 1977.
Sears oversees the study with his wife
Pauline, a former teacher at the School of
Education They have published articles on
the degree of satisfaction of those involved
in the studv

Female participants in the Terman
studv. the research shows, joined the work
force sooner, married later and often re
mained childless Compared to census and
other data, more of them held professional
jobs and graduated from college.
The happiest women
The most satisfied women were those
who worked and had no family Of the wom
en who responded in 1972. many of them said
that they would now choose a professional
career rather than homemaking. However,
many said they would not pursue a career
while raising children
The study's results also challenge the be
lief that males are obsessed with their
work, deriving the most satisfaction from
it. While males said their work was impor
tant. they saw fulfillment from family life
as more satisfying
(ieneral life satisfaction ratings are
based on six categories: occupational suc
cess. family life, friendships, richness of
cultural life, total service to society and
"joy of living
Predictors of satisfaction included
positive views, in retrospect, of parents,
early feelings of self-confidence and a feel
ing of choosing a work pattern, rather than
just drifting into one.
The study still follows between 75 and 80
percent of the living members of the ori
ginal group, and Sears said he expects it to
continue for quite some time.
