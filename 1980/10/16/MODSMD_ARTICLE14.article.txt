# Millions see Meyers take payoff from 'sheik'
## Abscam trial videotape shown on television 
### 
!• rom the Daily wire services
Millions of television viewers
got their first look Tuesday
night at videotapes used in the
first trial connected to the FBl's
Abscam investigation. The
tapes were broadcast after the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to a
hear a challenge to their release
by four persons convicted at the
trial.
Videotapes of meetings be
tween convicted Abscam defen
dant Michael Myers, a former
Democratic congressman from
Philadelphia, and undercover
FBI agents posing as emissaries
of a bogus sheik were given
heavy play on network news
programs three and a half hours
after the tapes were released at
the federal courthouse in
Brooklyn, where Myers and his
co-defendants were tried.
The tapes shown Tuesday
night were given a rush editing
to get them on the air. The Pub
lic Broadcasting Service is
going to make the tapes avail
able to its stations for showing
in their entirety tonight.
CBS broadcast a special pro
gram on the tapes Tuesday
night, and ABC devoted its late
night news program "Night
line" to them. NBC did not run a
special because of its coverage

of the World Series. Cable News
Network, the all-news channel,
ran large portions of the tapes
throughout the evening
The way was cleared for what
was believed to be the first TV
broadcast of videotaped
evidence when the U.S. Su
preme Court refused to hear
arguments by Myers and his
three co-defendants that release
of the tapes could adversely af
fect the appeals of their convic
tion Aug. 30 on bribery and con
spiracy charges.
The tapes' release, requested
by the three major television
networks, had been approved by
U.S. District Court Judge
George Pratt, who tried the
case against Myers and the oth
ers. His decision was upheld by
the U.S. Court of Appeals, which
said the tapes were in the public
domain once they had been
shown in open court. Only the
tapes used at Myers' trial are
affected by the order.
In one segment of the tapes.
Myers was seen meeting in a ho
tel near Kennedy Airport with
an undercover agent posing as
the representative of a fictitious
sheik who said he needed help in
immigration matters.
The agent tells him. "There's
a lot of money in this. 0.K.? I
work for two different Arab

groups, .they've got tons of
money."
Myers tells him, "You're
going about this the right
way...money talks in this busi
ness and bullshit walks."
At the end of the meeting, the
undercover agent is seen hand
ing Myers an envelope contain
ing thousands of dollars as a
payoff.
"Spend it well." the agent
says as he shakes Myers hand.
"It's a pleasure," Myers says
as he accepts the envelope.
In another tape the 37-vear

old Myers, who was expelled
from Congress after members
had viewed the same tapes, is
seen in a similar meeting in a
Philadelphia hotel. He assures
the undercover agents that he'll
be in the sheik's corner "100
percent." and that he and at
torney Howard Criden "would
use our influence with our dele
gation through me. . "to ease
the sheik's difficulties.
The fact that transcripts of
the meetings had already been
widelv printed in newspapers

and magazines did not lessen
the impact of actually seeing
and hearing a congressman on
the take.
In Philadelphia. Myers said
the Supreme Court action did
not surprise him and that "the
public has a right to see" the
tapes. "They also have a right to
find out why the FBI and the
.Justice Department used these
kind of tactics." he added. He
has said that he still intends to
campaign for re-election in No
vember

able to its stations for showing
in their entirety tonight.
CBS broadcast a special pro
gram on the tapes Tuesday
night, and ABC devoted its late
night news program "Night
line" to them. NBC did not run a
special because of its coverage

of the World Series. Cable News
Network, the all-news channel,
ran large portions of the tapes
throughout the evening
The way was cleared for what
was believed to be the first TV
broadcast of videotaped
evidence when the U.S. Su
preme Court refused to hear
arguments by Myers and his
three co-defendants that release
of the tapes could adversely af
fect the appeals of their convic
tion Aug. 30 on bribery and con
spiracy charges.
The tapes' release, requested
by the three major television
networks, had been approved by
U.S. District Court Judge
George Pratt, who tried the
case against Myers and the oth
ers. His decision was upheld by
the U.S. Court of Appeals, which
said the tapes were in the public
domain once they had been
shown in open court. Only the
tapes used at Myers' trial are
affected by the order.
In one segment of the tapes.
Myers was seen meeting in a ho
tel near Kennedy Airport with
an undercover agent posing as
the representative of a fictitious
sheik who said he needed help in
immigration matters.
The agent tells him. "There's
a lot of money in this. 0.K.? I
work for two different Arab

groups, .they've got tons of
money."
Myers tells him, "You're
going about this the right
way...money talks in this busi
ness and bullshit walks."
At the end of the meeting, the
undercover agent is seen hand
ing Myers an envelope contain
ing thousands of dollars as a
payoff.
"Spend it well." the agent
says as he shakes Myers hand.
"It's a pleasure," Myers says
as he accepts the envelope.
In another tape the 37-vear

old Myers, who was expelled
from Congress after members
had viewed the same tapes, is
seen in a similar meeting in a
Philadelphia hotel. He assures
the undercover agents that he'll
be in the sheik's corner "100
percent." and that he and at
torney Howard Criden "would
use our influence with our dele
gation through me. . "to ease
the sheik's difficulties.
The fact that transcripts of
the meetings had already been
widelv printed in newspapers

and magazines did not lessen
the impact of actually seeing
and hearing a congressman on
the take.
In Philadelphia. Myers said
the Supreme Court action did
not surprise him and that "the
public has a right to see" the
tapes. "They also have a right to
find out why the FBI and the
.Justice Department used these
kind of tactics." he added. He
has said that he still intends to

Millions of television viewers
got their first look Tuesday
night at videotapes used in the
first trial connected to the FBl's
Abscam investigation. The
tapes were broadcast after the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to a
hear a challenge to their release
by four persons convicted at the
trial.
Videotapes of meetings be
tween convicted Abscam defen
dant Michael Myers, a former
Democratic congressman from
Philadelphia, and undercover
FBI agents posing as emissaries
of a bogus sheik were given
heavy play on network news
programs three and a half hours
after the tapes were released at
the federal courthouse in
Brooklyn, where Myers and his
co-defendants were tried.
The tapes shown Tuesday
night were given a rush editing
to get them on the air. The Pub
lic Broadcasting Service is
going to make the tapes avail
able to its stations for showing
in their entirety tonight.
