# THE 						STAN FORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Randy Broberg Drastic change needed 
### 
I am basically an optimistic person I like to be
lieve that I too will be able to enjoy a fulfilling ca
reer. to marry, to buy a home and to raise a fami
ly. Hut an understanding of the current American
crisis causes my naive optimism to shrivel and die
as if from the chill of an icy arctic wind Young
people today are just fooling themselves if they
think they will be able to live their lives in pursuit
of the American Dream as so many generations
had before them, unless something drastically
changes.
Economically, our country is on a slippery path
to disaster. As long as I can remember, we have
been plagued with spiralling inflation, deepening
recession, only to be followed by ever increasing
inflation The "starting salary: $23,000" so many
Stanford students are fond of planning on will soon
mean very little The buying power of our dollar
has only declined in our generation, and it can only
continue to do so.
No one needed to remind me of the danger of
impending war as 1 filled out my draft regis
tration card this summer 1 have been kidding my
self into believing my generation would escape
war World War 111 is inevitable in the next 20
years, according to Chinese Chairman Deng
Xiaoping, unless there is change.
In world affairs the United States is no longer
the unquestioned leader of the free world. Our am
bassador is shot in Pakistan, our embassy at
tacked in Libya, our embassy seized in Tehran —
52 Americans are held hostage for a year's time.
And.in the face of it all. America is a stammering
and spineless paper tiger.
We are forced to deplete our Atlantic. Mediter
ranean and Pacific fleets to place ships in the area
of the Persian Gulf. Russia invades a helpless
Third World neighbor and all we can do is get a
few (not most) of our allies to join us in boycotting
the Moscow Olympics. Our land based missiles
have been rendered vulnerable to a Soviet first
strike; yet. we sign a treaty < SALT II) that would
ban the deployment of the MX missile.
The crisis America faces can onlv be blamed

upon the Democratic leaders in Washington It is
not a "malaise" among the American people
which has brought this impending doom; it is the
myopic policies of the Democratic Party.
The Democratic coalition, forged by President
Franklin Roosevelt, is inherently myopic as a con
glomeration of often conflicting special interest
groups The Democrats give with the left hand
only what they have taken away with the right
They have controlled Washington for 25 years,
constantly cutting defense, increasing the size of
government and taxing and regulating us into a
spider's web of bureaucracy.
However, the crisis has come to a head in the
last four years as ineptness. inconsistency and in
competency have been added to insanity. The
Carter administration has not only given us four
years of the wrong thing, it has not even done it
well
When Carter entered office he pledged to re
move our troops from Korea, then he changed his
mind. He pledged to cut back on government bu
reaucracy; then, he gave us the Departments of
Energy and Education. He cut the B-l. now he
touts the Stealth He said we were free from "in
ordinate fear" of Communism, then he said that
he had changed his entire view of the Soviet Union
when Brezhnev lied to him on the hot line.
On domestic and foreign policy Carter only
reacts, he never leads. He has offered us a half
dozen new and different economic plans just this
year. As each one fails miserably, he merely
forgets it and offers us a new one.
Whether one is right wing, left wing, or mod
erate — it makes no difference — one can plainly
see that the classic liberal policies of the last 25
years have failed miserably. Camelot is dead; it
must be forgotten A drastic change in our govern
ment absolutely must take place. The Reagan-
Bush ticket and a Republican Congress offer such
a change. It is not as Carter has said: a choice be
tween two futures, it is either a choice for Re
agan-Bush or no real future at all.

dozen new and different economic plans just this
year. As each one fails miserably, he merely
forgets it and offers us a new one.
Whether one is right wing, left wing, or mod
erate — it makes no difference — one can plainly
see that the classic liberal policies of the last 25
years have failed miserably. Camelot is dead; it
must be forgotten A drastic change in our govern
ment absolutely must take place. The Reagan-
Bush ticket and a Republican Congress offer such
a change. It is not as Carter has said: a choice be
tween two futures, it is either a choice for Re
agan-Bush or no real future at all.

I am basically an optimistic person I like to be
lieve that I too will be able to enjoy a fulfilling ca
reer. to marry, to buy a home and to raise a fami
ly. Hut an understanding of the current American
crisis causes my naive optimism to shrivel and die
as if from the chill of an icy arctic wind Young
people today are just fooling themselves if they
think they will be able to live their lives in pursuit
of the American Dream as so many generations
had before them, unless something drastically
changes.
Economically, our country is on a slippery path
to disaster. As long as I can remember, we have
been plagued with spiralling inflation, deepening
recession, only to be followed by ever increasing
inflation The "starting salary: $23,000" so many
Stanford students are fond of planning on will soon
mean very little The buying power of our dollar
has only declined in our generation, and it can only
continue to do so.
No one needed to remind me of the danger of
impending war as 1 filled out my draft regis
tration card this summer 1 have been kidding my
self into believing my generation would escape
war World War 111 is inevitable in the next 20
years, according to Chinese Chairman Deng
Xiaoping, unless there is change.
In world affairs the United States is no longer
the unquestioned leader of the free world. Our am
bassador is shot in Pakistan, our embassy at
tacked in Libya, our embassy seized in Tehran —
52 Americans are held hostage for a year's time.
And.in the face of it all. America is a stammering
and spineless paper tiger.
We are forced to deplete our Atlantic. Mediter
ranean and Pacific fleets to place ships in the area
of the Persian Gulf. Russia invades a helpless
Third World neighbor and all we can do is get a
few (not most) of our allies to join us in boycotting
the Moscow Olympics. Our land based missiles
have been rendered vulnerable to a Soviet first
strike; yet. we sign a treaty < SALT II) that would
ban the deployment of the MX missile.
The crisis America faces can onlv be blamed

upon the Democratic leaders in Washington It is
not a "malaise" among the American people
which has brought this impending doom; it is the
myopic policies of the Democratic Party.
The Democratic coalition, forged by President
Franklin Roosevelt, is inherently myopic as a con
glomeration of often conflicting special interest
groups The Democrats give with the left hand
only what they have taken away with the right
They have controlled Washington for 25 years,
constantly cutting defense, increasing the size of
government and taxing and regulating us into a
spider's web of bureaucracy.
However, the crisis has come to a head in the
last four years as ineptness. inconsistency and in
competency have been added to insanity. The
Carter administration has not only given us four
years of the wrong thing, it has not even done it
well
When Carter entered office he pledged to re
move our troops from Korea, then he changed his
mind. He pledged to cut back on government bu
reaucracy; then, he gave us the Departments of
Energy and Education. He cut the B-l. now he
touts the Stealth He said we were free from "in
ordinate fear" of Communism, then he said that
he had changed his entire view of the Soviet Union
when Brezhnev lied to him on the hot line.
On domestic and foreign policy Carter only
reacts, he never leads. He has offered us a half
dozen new and different economic plans just this
year. As each one fails miserably, he merely
forgets it and offers us a new one.
