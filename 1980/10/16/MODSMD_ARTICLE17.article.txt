## The 						Peripheral Canal boondoggle 
### 
In the dry southern half of
California, water is the key to
growth. Without imported wa
ter from the Sierra, the Colo
rado River, and the Sacramento
River. Los Angeles could not ex
ist. The homes and jobs of all
Southern Californians depend
on this water, as do some real
estate and agricultural for
tunes.
There are those who claim
that the South state will be
threatened by water shortages
beginning in 1985. This is a de
batable proposition, depending
on whose numbers one chooses
to believe. The State's Depart
ment of Water Resources
(DWR) and the Metropolitan
Water District i MWD — a legis
lative body with the responsi
bility of supplying the L. A. basin
with water) are the chief ad
vocates of the shortage theory,
and are pushing for an expanded
water supply system serving the
South.
DWR has designed a package
of facilities which includes a
Peripheral Canal, which would
divert Sacramento River water
around the San Francisco Bay
Delta to the California
Aqueduct, which is the main
transport facility of the State
Water Project (SWP). This
canal would enable the State to
expand the diversion of Sacra
mento River water by one-third.
For the sake of brevity, let us
concede that there will be water
shortages in Southern Califor
nia after 1985 (no small con
cession) and then evaluate
DWR's plan to r.ieet the in
creased need.
The Peripheral Canal and the
other facilities included in
DWR's plan will cost $5 billion
by the time they are completed
in the year 2000 This figure does
not include the cost of three new
coal-fired power plants that will
be needed to pump the addi
tional water from the Delta to
Los Angeles. These plants will
add $6 billion to the price tag
Furthermore, energy costs
will continue to escalate, mak
ing it difficult to predict just
how much it will cost to deliver
the water to the consumer One
estimate of the total cost of the
project by the year 2035 is $23
billion. Regardless of the exact
figures, it is clear that the

project is both energy and capi
tal intensive.
By state law. the cost of wa
ter supplied by the SWP must be
paid by the consumer. Thus, the
high cost of DWR's proposal
will be reflected in higher water
bills in the South, i DWR has not
taken into account how in
creased water prices will affect
consumption, but it doesn't take
a great knowledge of economics
to know what this effect will
be.)
It is ironic that urban water
bills should go up when those
who would benefit most are
Kern County agri-business con
cerns. In 11 of the past 12 years,
there has been a surplus of SWP
water which has been sold to ag
ricultural users in the San Joa
quin Valley (Kern County> at
one-seventh the normal price.
DWR claims that its plan will
prevent shortages in the South;
it will also maintain the SWP
surplus which makes large
scale farming in Kern Countv so

lucrative.
That DWR's plan is one which
caters to special interests (as
opposed to the public interest)
becomes obvious when one con
siders the efficacy of the Per
ipheral Canal package in rela
tion to just one alternative: ag
ricultural conservation.
Fully 85 percent of the water
used in California is used in ag
riculture. In addition to the
cheap surplus water previously
mentioned, agricultural users
receive a subsidy in the SWP
rate structure. In the market
economy, farmers need more
incentive to use water efficient
ly. As things stand, farmers can
afford to squander our precious
water resources. Given the
enormous potential for water
conservation, even a modest
conservation policy would be
sufficient to compensate for the
shortages predicted by the
DWR and MWD.
So why has DWR proposed the
Peripheral Canal? It appears

that the driving force behind
this solution are the vested in
terests of those who will benefit
from continuing availability of
cheap water; land developers,
real estate owners, agri-busi
ness concerns, insurance bro
kers and bankers.
More money has been spent in
lobbying the Peripheral Canal
legislation through the state leg
islature than on any other issue
in the history of California. For
tunately. the legislature's ac
tion will be reviewed by the vot
ers of California next June.
To be sure, this is a very com
plex issue (environmental prob
lems in the Bay and Delta have
not even been mentioned, for in
stance). but it is essential that
the voters of the state delve into
its recesses and discover the
multitude of oversights made by
the DWR in its proposal to build
the Peripheral Canal.

the water to the consumer One
estimate of the total cost of the
project by the year 2035 is $23
billion. Regardless of the exact
figures, it is clear that the

project is both energy and capi
tal intensive.
By state law. the cost of wa
ter supplied by the SWP must be
paid by the consumer. Thus, the
high cost of DWR's proposal
will be reflected in higher water
bills in the South, i DWR has not
taken into account how in
creased water prices will affect
consumption, but it doesn't take
a great knowledge of economics
to know what this effect will
be.)
It is ironic that urban water
bills should go up when those
who would benefit most are
Kern County agri-business con
cerns. In 11 of the past 12 years,
there has been a surplus of SWP
water which has been sold to ag
ricultural users in the San Joa
quin Valley (Kern County> at
one-seventh the normal price.
DWR claims that its plan will
prevent shortages in the South;
it will also maintain the SWP
surplus which makes large
scale farming in Kern Countv so

lucrative.
That DWR's plan is one which
caters to special interests (as
opposed to the public interest)
becomes obvious when one con
siders the efficacy of the Per
ipheral Canal package in rela
tion to just one alternative: ag
ricultural conservation.
Fully 85 percent of the water
used in California is used in ag
riculture. In addition to the
cheap surplus water previously
mentioned, agricultural users
receive a subsidy in the SWP
rate structure. In the market
economy, farmers need more
incentive to use water efficient
ly. As things stand, farmers can
afford to squander our precious
water resources. Given the
enormous potential for water
conservation, even a modest
conservation policy would be
sufficient to compensate for the
shortages predicted by the
DWR and MWD.
So why has DWR proposed the
Peripheral Canal? It appears

that the driving force behind
this solution are the vested in
terests of those who will benefit
from continuing availability of
cheap water; land developers,
real estate owners, agri-busi
ness concerns, insurance bro
kers and bankers.
More money has been spent in
lobbying the Peripheral Canal
legislation through the state leg
islature than on any other issue
in the history of California. For
tunately. the legislature's ac
tion will be reviewed by the vot
ers of California next June.
To be sure, this is a very com
plex issue (environmental prob
lems in the Bay and Delta have
not even been mentioned, for in
stance). but it is essential that
the voters of the state delve into
its recesses and discover the
multitude of oversights made by
the DWR in its proposal to build
the Peripheral Canal.

In the dry southern half of
California, water is the key to
growth. Without imported wa
ter from the Sierra, the Colo
rado River, and the Sacramento
River. Los Angeles could not ex
ist. The homes and jobs of all
Southern Californians depend
on this water, as do some real
estate and agricultural for
tunes.
There are those who claim
that the South state will be
threatened by water shortages
beginning in 1985. This is a de
batable proposition, depending
on whose numbers one chooses
to believe. The State's Depart
ment of Water Resources
(DWR) and the Metropolitan
Water District i MWD — a legis
lative body with the responsi
bility of supplying the L. A. basin
with water) are the chief ad
vocates of the shortage theory,
and are pushing for an expanded
water supply system serving the
South.
DWR has designed a package
of facilities which includes a
Peripheral Canal, which would
divert Sacramento River water
around the San Francisco Bay
Delta to the California
Aqueduct, which is the main
transport facility of the State
Water Project (SWP). This
canal would enable the State to
expand the diversion of Sacra
mento River water by one-third.
For the sake of brevity, let us
concede that there will be water
shortages in Southern Califor
nia after 1985 (no small con
cession) and then evaluate
DWR's plan to r.ieet the in
creased need.
The Peripheral Canal and the
other facilities included in
DWR's plan will cost $5 billion
by the time they are completed
in the year 2000 This figure does
not include the cost of three new
coal-fired power plants that will
be needed to pump the addi
tional water from the Delta to
Los Angeles. These plants will
add $6 billion to the price tag
Furthermore, energy costs
will continue to escalate, mak
ing it difficult to predict just
how much it will cost to deliver
the water to the consumer One
