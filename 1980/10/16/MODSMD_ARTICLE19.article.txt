## Plutarch, St. Paul and the election 
### 
It is common enough for peo
ple. when they fall into great
disasters, to discern what is
right, and what they ought to do;
but there are few who in such ex
tremities have the strength to
obey their judgment, either in
doing what it approves or avoid
ing what it condemns; and a
good many are so weak as to
give way to their habits all the
more, and are incapable of us
ing their minds.
â€”Plutarch's Lives

Kind of nice i maybe even true
and definitely non-sexist). My
brother (Stanford. '80) found it
written in the front of an old ad
dress book of my father (Stan
ford. '47). The book has since
been up-dated, changed, and
there are 'new'' address books.
It is only in our parents' absence
that he is driven to hunt up the
old text, looking for God-only
knows whose address.
At the time I thought. "Not
nearly as catchy as Kipling's If.
but it has the same sentiment...
and maybe Kipling read
Plutarch, and only thought the
modern generations of the 19th
century needed something a bit
more up-dated and snatty or
merely saw the same things
happening, and felt the need to

say something about them."
(And why do the photographer
and Kurtz in Apocalypse Now
run around reciting If?)

I arrived at Stanford in the
fall dog-days of '67. terrified of
school, wondering how anyone
could be expected to do Calculus
41A problem sets in the heat,
preoccupied with Vietnam (a
friend, valedictorian of my high
school, turned down Stanford to
join the Marines ... and he
wasn't stupid, either).
In those days there was some
thing called "Western Civ
ilization" required, dutifully at
tended three times a week at 11
a.m. The teacher was not much
older than I was. The course was
held in a second-floor classroom
of Cubberley. The windows
were open and voices, noises
from"the passing scene'' below
would rise.
The world was falling apart,
and the grinds in the class in
evitably vomited out synopses
of the "required reading" to
prove they had read the books to
a teacher who probably had no
better handle on the class than I
did. I still have the original copy
of a "poem" written in that
class about little golden voices
droning, droning on. producing
no honey (lousy poetry, but...).
Still, the thought was there and,
at one point having aspired to
being a beekeeper, I knew the
difference between the drones
and the queen bee, and their re
lationship to honey ... it wasn't
that bad. for something that has
never been shown publicly.

I got a D the first quarter, and
pulled it up to a B by the time the
19th/20th centuries and spring
quarter rolled along, when we
read Schumpeter (is he on the
new Western Culture reading
list?). We skipped Hegel.
Freud, and a lot of others for one
reason or another. Still. Locke,
Hume and Marx seemed to be
more relevant to "reality" than
St. Augustine in solving, riddl
ing through the problems
weighing on my mind.

I later had to crawl through
all the texts that droned by me
freshman year in search of an
swers; where do we get all the
weird, crazy notions that make
life so complicated? Why can't
we "get along?" Why can't men
and women understand each
other? Why is there so much
"bad craziness" around? (See
St. Paul for a start.)

I write this because the Sun
day before registration I had an
exquisite lunch with a professor
here and his wife. He was in
strumental in bringing back
"the classics" (for you who are
new to the game. Western Civ
ilization/Culture disappeared
from the curriculum for a dec
ade). We discussed the nuances
of structuralism, the superior
ity of a round lawn to a square
lawn. The fineness of prose and
poetry, strawberries and white
wine in California sun light.
Lunch extended to 7 p.m. and a
crying/yelling "discussion" of
the coming elections. (We do
care about these things a great
deal and tempers run high.)
The bad craziness is still with
us. Are you really, really sure
you will wake up in one piece, in
your bed at Stanford? The pro
fessor and I will go on arguing
the merits of structuralism and
screaming at each other about
who will vote for whom. It is a
pastime of caring, educated old
fogies ... But you .. who are
possibly not even old enough to
vote this time around, to whom
Vietnam is a bad-fairy-tale (and
you can tell oral histories to
your chilren about what really
happened during the Iranian-
Iraqi war, the elections ... may
be even live to read about it in
the text books) ...Good luck!

(You're going to need it.)
I've already lived three years
longer than I ever thought I
would, so for me it's ail icing on
the cake. The pro! may be rot
ten. the heat may be deadly,
your classmates less than vocal
(what does go on in their little
minds as they sit there so silent
ly?), but it's your life and your
world and if you wake up and
wonder about the bad crazi
ness. We either fell from the
garden of Eden or were never in
it to begin with. (Is it Paradise
lost or one we have to try to dis
cover? ) Western Culture may
be your only chance during your
"education" to read the texts
that just may help you figure it
out. give you keys to the mess
you're in.
And since the world seems to
be growing uncomfortably
smaller day by day, and the old
"compare and contrast" meth
od has its uses, gain some in
sight into the headlines and find
out just what Western Culture is
by finding out what it isn't and
juxtapose it to African, Middle
Eastern and Asian studies.
***
With a final quote from
Plutarch I leave you on your
own, perhaps, except for the
texts. "It is an ignoble thing for
any man to admire and relish
the glory of his own eloquence."

ated member of the clas of '71.)
