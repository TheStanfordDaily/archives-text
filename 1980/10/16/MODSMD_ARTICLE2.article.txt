# Clerical workers to petition NLRB to form bargaining unit
## 
### Karen Springen 
The Office Staff Organizing Com
mittee (OSOC) will announce at noon
today in front of Old Union that it has
collected enough authorization cards
from clerical workers here to go to the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB).
The number of signatures required
to form a bargaining unit is 30 percent.
The committee must now file a peti
tion with the NLRB to become a
bargaining unit within United Stan
lord Employees (USE). The NLRB
will then verify the names with a list
of employees provided by the Univer
sity.
The board classifies members of the
bargaining unit who are eligible to
vote whether or not they want a union
If the petition is approved by the
NLRB. OSOC would hold a secret
ballot election among University
clerical workers to determine if the
workers want to be represented by a
union.
According to steering committee

member Natalie Fisher, the Univer
sity employs about 2000 office staff
members who would be involved in the
secret ballot election
Major OSOC complaints include
lack of overtime pay. no career ladder
and few effective channels for airing
grievances with binding arbitration.
Opportunities to participate in de
cisions. on the job training, job secur
ity. wages and childcare are limited.
OSOC claims.
Another major problem cited is ine
quity of job classification due to the
varying finances of individual depart
ments. For example, foreign lan
guages have generally low job classi
fications. But the School of Education
and SLAC have more money.
Small departments often cannot
promote clericals. As a result, secre
taries frequently move across depart
ments.
According to Fisher, another cur
rent criticism centers on the lack of

clerical input in the Committe on
Education and Emplovment of Wom
en i CHEW i report on secretaries The
CREW committee consisted of no
clerical representatives from OSOC.
Hut according to CEEW member
Alice Supton. assistant dean of Resi
dential Education, nine secretaries
from a broad base of the clerical work
force provided suggestions.
OSOC head Joyce Tippes-Coates
said this was not the case. "They say
they interviewed a representative sec
tion. but they didn't interview anyone
from SLAC.'
Supton said. "We did not want to be
seen in anv way to affect the organiz
ing effort " \n active interest in sec
retaries on the part of a University
committee would have been inap
propriate and would have undercut the
OSOC effort, she said.
According to committee member
Linda Haines, personnel employment
manager. OSOC was not considered
when the CEEW committee was
formed It was a decision made after
the committee was selected to in
vestigate clerical concerns.''
Owens said the CEEW report will
not result in any substantive change.
"Essentially it's a placating meas
ure." she said
"Right now we have equal pay for
equal work, but we need equal pay for
equal value." she said. "Clerical work
has been undervalued. Some of the job
descriptions for clericals require a
very high level of responsibility and
skill "
She added. "Tree trimmers in un
ions get more."
Clericals at Boston University and
University of Illinois are currently un
ionized. she said.
But the union movement here must
still "overcome a lot of anti-union
prejudice.'' said Fisher, it's very
much like the Civil Rights Move
ment."
Roadblocks include many secretar
ies' fear of strikes, she said. Others
get caught up in the idealism of work
ing for a well-known scientist.
"Clerical work is a female ghetto."
emphasized Fisher. "The only way we
can be treated as equals is to have a
union."
OSOC members protested at the in
auguration of Donald Kennedy last
Sunday. The secretaries wore shirts
that said "Who runs Stanford?" on the
front and answered "We do!" on the
back
The group offers a number of ser
vices including leadership training,
luncheon meetings. Tuesday night
meetings in Tresidder. speakers,
films and workshops.
