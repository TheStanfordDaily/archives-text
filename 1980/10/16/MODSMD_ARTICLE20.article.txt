Toxic syndrome
Over the past five years of
reading the Daily, I've seen
some rather outlandish opin
ions. but Dolores Harrison's, on
the subject of "tampon danger"
takes first prize (Daily. Oct.
13). I have trouble believing any
rational person could take her
seriously.
Accusing Proctor and
Gamble of "murder and at
tempted murder of women" is
just as ridiculous as accusing
the surgeons who perform male
infant circumcisions of murder
and attempted murder, where
approximately two out of one
million deaths occur; the num
bers are about the same.
Toxic shock syndrome has
been around for quite some

time. The best estimate as to
why this sudden outbreak has
occurred, stated by the National
Center tor Disease Control, is
that a new mutant strain of the
causative bacterium has
emerged, and that this, along
with the effect of some of the
new "super-absorbant" materi
als being used, can bring about
the condition.
It is impossible to have a to
tally safe product. We all make
trade-offs between safety and
convenience, among other fac
tors. Should we ban the use of
automobiles because so many
people are killed in them each
year? Continue to make them
safer yes. eliminate them. no.
