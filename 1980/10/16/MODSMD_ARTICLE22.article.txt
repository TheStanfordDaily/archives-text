# Airfares up, discounts down
## 
### 
New York (AP) — Airlines,
stung by rising fuel bills and a
recession that has reduced air
travel, are moving to raise fares
and drastically reduce the
number of discount tickets sold,
industry spokesmen said yester
day.
American Airlines said it
notified the Civil Aeronautics
Board it plans to cut the max
imum discount offered on "su
persaver" fares from 55 percent
to 35 percent and plans to make
it much more difficult to qualify
for the discount from full-fare
prices.
American has tried before to
reduce discounts, onlv to back

down when other airlines re
fused to go along. But it seems
more likely to succeed this time
because Braniff and Delta air
lines said they are joining in the
move, and Trans World said it
was studying the action.
"Maybe we'll get some una
nimity in the industry," said
David Frailey, an American
vice president.
American's proposal would
restrict the discounts to persons
who make round trip reserva
tions at least 30 days in advance
and stay at least seven days.
They are now available with
only seven or 14 days advance
reservations and passengers

need only stay until the next Sat
urday to qualify. The changes
would take effect on flights be
ginning after Dec. 1.
"Our whole rationale has
been the supersaver discount
should be a deep one, but it
should have conditions that dis
courage those who would fly
anyway," Frailey said.
United Airlines said it plans
to impose the same restrictions
as American, but would give
higher discounts on flights over
1 500 miles.
Frailey had no comment on
that, but American presumably
will have to match it.
