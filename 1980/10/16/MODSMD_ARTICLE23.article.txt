The caricatures of Vanity Fair, an English
turn-of-the-centurv society magazine, "are a
landmark in journalism and lithography. They
provide, if not a mirror, a record of Victorian
England worth seeing and enjoying," said Peter
Mellini Tuesday afternoon during a lecture and
slide show sponsored by the History Dept
Professor Peter Stanskv introduced Melluv, a
former Stanford undergraduate, graduate student
and lecturer in the Western Culture series.
Mellini now teaches history at Sonoma State Col
lege and is co-author of the forthcoming book, In
Vanity Fair.
When Thomas (Jibson Bowles launched Vanity
Fair in November of 1868, "it immediately be
came the leading English society magazine of the
day," Mellini said.
Covering the arts
Vanity Fair covered the music, literature and
drama of the times. "Its articles were light and
racy — Vanity Fair was the New Yorker of Vic
torian England." Mellini said.
The lithographic caricatures which appeared
each week were one of the magazine's distinctive
elements. Bowles himself wrote a commentary
for each caricature which appeared in his maga
zine.
"Bowles had a delicate wit and a wonderful
sense of the ridiculous," said Mellini. "He was
more critical and insulting than journalists dare
to be today." Bowles was sued constantly but lost
only one libel suit during his 20-vear ownership of
the magazine.
The caricatures themselves aroused animosity
as well as amusement in Victorian society. Ac
cording to Mellini, the portraits showed, "not
what was not there, but a gentle exaggeration of
the reality of each subject."
Image making
In many cases, the Vanity Fair cartoon created
the public's image of a celebrity. Before long, the
caricatures were an institution in England. It be
came "a great honor" to be rendered by the
notorious artists of Vanity Fair and spread across
the pages of the magazine in exaggerated glory
for all of England to enjoy.
The artists of Vanity Fair painted royalty and
rulers, politicians, journalists, judges, busi
nessmen and bankers, artists, preachers, scien

tists and inventors Mellini's private collection of
\'cinit\ Fair caricatures is now on exhibit at the
Art Museum through November 18
The Stanford exhibition features a represent
ative selection of the 2400 cartoons which were
published in Vanity Fair including those of Glad
stone. Churchill. John Stuart Mill. Ruskin. Rodin.
Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain. Charles
Darwin. Louis Pasteur and Queen Victoria
Bismark is artfully portrayed leaning against a
table which is covered by a map of Europe. The
subject is looking forward, unaware that his giant
thumb is planted in the center of France.
Horace Greeley's portrait was so devas
tating.'' said Mellini. "that afterwards Greeley
said it looked more like he was running for the
penitentiary than for the presidency ."

According to Mellini. the image of the English
as culturally isolated during the Victorian era is
rebuked by Vanity Fair. "I wonder if my col
leagues don't have some rethinking to do on that
point." Mellini said.
Few women appeared in the magazine, and
those who did were not subjected to the indignities
that male subjects endured. "Women were
treated with too much deference.'' said Mellini
"They were above caricature.''
Starr struck
One exception to the deference shown women
was Mrs. Starr, a mother superior who had been
involved in a "splendid Victorian sex scandal."
Starr's portrait reflected that gentle art of exag
geration for which Vanity Fair was so well known.
By 1910. Vanity Fair was suffering from serious
financial difficulties. The new owners of the mag
azine allowed people to purchase the once ex
clusive privilege of appearing in the magazine,
and the quality of its portraiture declined. "Van
ity Fair folded in 1914, not long before the world
which it reflected met its fate in the trenches of
France." Mellini said.
Of the two to three million remaining reprints
of the caricatures, several tons were sold for
wastepaper and several tons were destroyed by a
flood These mishaps gave rise to a legend that the
prints are cursed.
Most of the remaining prints (several
thousand i were bought in the 1930s by an Ameri
can medical student from Virginia.

According to Mellini. the image of the English
as culturally isolated during the Victorian era is
rebuked by Vanity Fair. "I wonder if my col
leagues don't have some rethinking to do on that
point." Mellini said.
Few women appeared in the magazine, and
those who did were not subjected to the indignities
that male subjects endured. "Women were
treated with too much deference.'' said Mellini
"They were above caricature.''
Starr struck
One exception to the deference shown women
was Mrs. Starr, a mother superior who had been
involved in a "splendid Victorian sex scandal."
Starr's portrait reflected that gentle art of exag
geration for which Vanity Fair was so well known.
By 1910. Vanity Fair was suffering from serious
financial difficulties. The new owners of the mag
azine allowed people to purchase the once ex
clusive privilege of appearing in the magazine,
and the quality of its portraiture declined. "Van
ity Fair folded in 1914, not long before the world
which it reflected met its fate in the trenches of
France." Mellini said.
Of the two to three million remaining reprints
of the caricatures, several tons were sold for
wastepaper and several tons were destroyed by a
flood These mishaps gave rise to a legend that the
prints are cursed.
Most of the remaining prints (several
thousand i were bought in the 1930s by an Ameri
can medical student from Virginia.
The caricatures of Vanity Fair, an English
turn-of-the-centurv society magazine, "are a
landmark in journalism and lithography. They
provide, if not a mirror, a record of Victorian
England worth seeing and enjoying," said Peter
Mellini Tuesday afternoon during a lecture and
slide show sponsored by the History Dept
Professor Peter Stanskv introduced Melluv, a
former Stanford undergraduate, graduate student
and lecturer in the Western Culture series.
Mellini now teaches history at Sonoma State Col
lege and is co-author of the forthcoming book, In
Vanity Fair.
When Thomas (Jibson Bowles launched Vanity
Fair in November of 1868, "it immediately be
came the leading English society magazine of the
day," Mellini said.
Covering the arts
Vanity Fair covered the music, literature and
drama of the times. "Its articles were light and
racy — Vanity Fair was the New Yorker of Vic
torian England." Mellini said.
The lithographic caricatures which appeared
each week were one of the magazine's distinctive
elements. Bowles himself wrote a commentary
for each caricature which appeared in his maga
zine.
"Bowles had a delicate wit and a wonderful
sense of the ridiculous," said Mellini. "He was
more critical and insulting than journalists dare
to be today." Bowles was sued constantly but lost
only one libel suit during his 20-vear ownership of
the magazine.
The caricatures themselves aroused animosity
as well as amusement in Victorian society. Ac
cording to Mellini, the portraits showed, "not
what was not there, but a gentle exaggeration of
the reality of each subject."

In many cases, the Vanity Fair cartoon created
the public's image of a celebrity. Before long, the
caricatures were an institution in England. It be
came "a great honor" to be rendered by the
notorious artists of Vanity Fair and spread across
the pages of the magazine in exaggerated glory
for all of England to enjoy.

rulers, politicians, journalists, judges, busi
nessmen and bankers, artists, preachers, scien
