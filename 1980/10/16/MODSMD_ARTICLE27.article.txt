# IRS may force book scrapping
## 
### Los Angeles Tunes 
Washington - A little-known
Internal Revenue Service ruling
will force book publishers to de
stroy millions of volumes now in
inventory or sell them at
drastically reduced prices, ac
cording to a publishers' spokes
man
lan Volner. counsel for the
Association of American Pub
lishers. told a reporter that the
ruling will also cause publishers
to print fewer books and possi
bly raise the price of future vol
umes.
The ruling requires that taxes
be paid on the full value of in
ventories unless they are sold
for scrap or very low prices. In
the past, book publishers used
an accepted accounting pro
cedure to write down the value
of unsold books, sometimes to
as low as 5 percent of their retail
value, even though some were
sold later for the full price.
By marking down their inven
tories, the publishers raised
their cost of doing business and
thus lowered the taxes they
owed.
In recent testimony before a
Senate Small Business subcom
mittee. Volner had said that it
was "unseemly for this country
to encourage book burning in the
name of tax policy â€” after all, a
burned book does not yield a
dollar of tax revenues."
Volner acknowledged in an in
terview Tuesday, the publishers
would not actually burn un
wanted books but would sell

them for pulp-making or for spe
cial salt's at prices that do not
cover the cost of printing them
The alternative. Volner said,
is payment of sharply higher
taxes
The IRS. however, said the
rule, issued last February, ap
plies to all forms of business and
simply carries out a Supreme
Court ruling on methods of ac
counting for tax purposes. "It
reinforced the rules that we
thought were in effect all
along." Wilson Fadely. a
spokesman for the IRS. said. "It
doesn't matter whether the in
ventory consists of widgets,
gadgets, cars or books."
The book publishers hope
Congress will pass a special law
exempting their industry from
the IRS ruling or at least make it
effective only from 1980 on and
not apply the decision to the 1979
tax year.
Jack Snyder, executive vice
president of Harcourt Brace
Jovanovich. Inc.. New York
book publishers, said in recent
testimony before the Senate
panel that his firm would have
to print fewer books and raise
prices if the inventory ruling
was not overturned by Con
gress.
"We publishers are in the
position of someone who is in
vited to dinner and told for the
first time that the dinner is
black tie.and. what's more, that
his wardrobe over the past dec
ade has plainly been inade
quate," Snyder said.
