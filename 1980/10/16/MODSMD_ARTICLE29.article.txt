## ACT opens with dignified wit 
### Mary Loeffelholz 
A little pomp is a welcome ad
dition to the start of the theater
season in San Francisco, espe
cially when the season opens
with Shakespeare The Ameri
can Conservatory Theatre
(ACT i production oi' Much Ado
A bout Nothing began with cere
monious Baroque trumpet mu
sic in the lobby and slapstick
comedy onstage. Grace and buf
foonery were a happy introduc
tion to one of Shakespeare's wit
tiest romantic comedies.
Director Jerry Turner, com
ing to ACT from the Oregon
Shakespearean Festival, trans
planted the play's setting from
Italy to the Netherlands;
Messina in the Renaissance be
comes 17th century Amster
dam. Turner and scenery de
signer Richard Seger as
sembled a set modeled after the
paintings of Vermeer: sepia
tones, greys and browns set off
with ivy. The architectural de
tailing was rich without being
cluttered, and the design con
forms to basic Shakespearean
requirements — plenty of
ground exits and the obligatory
balcony — leaving the actors
generous room both for horse
play and more dignified pag
eantry.
The first scene stretched the
set's spatial resources nearly to
the limit as townspeople and

lords celebrated together the
end of war and the return of the
nobility to Messina Confusion
covered the arrival of the prin
cipal characters; the plot did
not begin to come into focus un
til Benedick and Claudio were
left alone on stage to debate the
merits of the lovely Hero.
From then on the evening
belonged to the actors and
Shakespeare's lines. The plot of
Much Ado is as comfortable as
an old pair of jeans, for surely a
simpleminded but handsome
young count home from the
wars will fall in love with a suit
able woman; his best friend will
scoff, until he in his turn falls in
love with a suitable woman, and
all eventually marry the part
ners we knew from the begin
ning were right.
Nicholas Kaledin as Claudio
and Julia Fletcher as Hero
played the simpler pair of lovers
with convincing ardor and in
articulateness. They just don't
have much to say for them
selves. Were it not for Claudio's
reluctance to woo Hero in his
own person, and the envious
plots of Don John (the necessary
stage villain, played with scene
stealing vigor by John Huttoni,
their courtship would scarcely
be more than one act long.
Fortunately Shakespeare pro
vides us with a pair of lovers
who have far too much to say for

themselves: Benedick (Mark
M u r p h e v ) and Be a t r i c e
(Barbara Diricksoni. the self
styled wits of Messina. Any
production of Much Ado rests
on Beatrice and Benedick; they
must first convince us of their
wit. then convince us that such
independent, intelligent people
are ripe to make fools of them
selves for love.
Dirickson and Murphey suc
ceed on both counts, although
both were perhaps a shade bet
ter at being love's fools than at
firing off witticisms. Undoub
tedly they were the play's most
physically as well as mentally
active couple, making excellent
use of the entire stage.
On Benedick and Beatrice
rests as well the responsibility
of emerging with genuine feel
ing from the melodramatic
crisis of the fourth act. The sup
porting cast turned in fine per
formances in the clowns' parts,
particularly William Paterson
as Dogberry and William
McKereghan (chortling like Mr.
McGoo) as Verges. It is left,
however, to Benedick and
Beatrice to defend Hero's in
jured innocence and avow their
love for each other while
Claudio is doing his best to
forget his for Hero. Kaledin's
Claudio was here almost too
shallow, too callous, but
Murphey as Benedick began to

a.-sume a dignity that teasing
could shake, but not deflect
112 rom its purpose.
iallow people ca , ,ri' the
less repent of their actions sin
cerely. and Kaledin recovered
some of our sympathy for
('laudio by his sorrow at the dis
covery of Hero's innocence.
Shallow and witty people alike
deserve, in Shakespearean com
edy. their appropriate mates.
As the reunited lovers join in the
quiet ceremony of an Eliz
abethan dance, we can't help
wishing them well. The new
ACT production of Much Ado
About Nothing exploits all the
play's wit without sacrificing
either its warmth, or its dignity
- a dignity that blends without
hesitation into comedv.

production of Much Ado rests
on Beatrice and Benedick; they
must first convince us of their
wit. then convince us that such
independent, intelligent people
are ripe to make fools of them
selves for love.
Dirickson and Murphey suc
ceed on both counts, although
both were perhaps a shade bet
ter at being love's fools than at
firing off witticisms. Undoub
tedly they were the play's most
physically as well as mentally
active couple, making excellent
use of the entire stage.
On Benedick and Beatrice
rests as well the responsibility
of emerging with genuine feel
ing from the melodramatic
crisis of the fourth act. The sup

McKereghan (chortling like Mr.
McGoo) as Verges. It is left,
however, to Benedick and

love for each other while

As the reunited lovers join in the
quiet ceremony of an Eliz

Director Jerry Turner, com

Shakespearean Festival, trans
planted the play's setting from
Italy to the Netherlands;
Messina in the Renaissance be
comes 17th century Amster
dam. Turner and scenery de
signer Richard Seger as
sembled a set modeled after the
paintings of Vermeer: sepia
tones, greys and browns set off
with ivy. The architectural de
tailing was rich without being
cluttered, and the design con
forms to basic Shakespearean
requirements — plenty of
ground exits and the obligatory
balcony — leaving the actors
generous room both for horse
play and more dignified pag
eantry.
The first scene stretched the
set's spatial resources nearly to
the limit as townspeople and

lords celebrated together the
end of war and the return of the
nobility to Messina Confusion
covered the arrival of the prin
cipal characters; the plot did
not begin to come into focus un
til Benedick and Claudio were
left alone on stage to debate the
merits of the lovely Hero.
From then on the evening
belonged to the actors and
Shakespeare's lines. The plot of
Much Ado is as comfortable as
an old pair of jeans, for surely a
simpleminded but handsome
young count home from the
wars will fall in love with a suit
able woman; his best friend will
scoff, until he in his turn falls in
love with a suitable woman, and
all eventually marry the part
ners we knew from the begin
ning were right.
Nicholas Kaledin as Claudio
and Julia Fletcher as Hero
played the simpler pair of lovers
with convincing ardor and in
articulateness. They just don't
have much to say for them
selves. Were it not for Claudio's
reluctance to woo Hero in his
own person, and the envious
plots of Don John (the necessary
stage villain, played with scene
stealing vigor by John Huttoni,
their courtship would scarcely
be more than one act long.
