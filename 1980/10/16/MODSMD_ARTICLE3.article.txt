# Yet greater 'encouragement' urged
## Record minority entrance to Med School 
### David Frank 
Minority enrollment at the Stanford
Medical School reached a record 26
percent of all first-year students this
year.
The incoming 1980 class included 13
chicanos. six blacks, two Native
Americans and one Puerto Rican out
of 86 students Thirty-one women — 36
percent of the class — were also en
rolled.
Although this marks the third con
secutive year of minority enrollment
increases at the Medical School, Dr.
Laurence Kedes. the school's director
of admissions, expressed some dis
satisfaction.
Said Kedes: "We and other gradu
ate professional programs — both
here and at other universities — are
inappropriately patting ourselves on
the back because of what we're doing
to increase the nationwide pool of ap
plicants to graduate programs.
"We should be doing more to en
courage more minorities to consider
graduate professions," Kedes said. At
many colleges — although "not usual
ly" at Stanford and other prominent
universities — "there are large num
bers of undergraduate minority stu
dents who are discouraged from
pursuing graduate professional pro
grams by well-meaning, but ill-in
formed advisors." he said.
To change this, Kedes added, the
prominent schools must make a
greater effort to provide their minor
ity students with a broader scope of
advising on graduate professional pro
grams.
According to statistics provided by
the Medical School, last year just over
10 percent of the country's 35.000 med
ical school applicants were minor
ities. The nationwide pool of black ap
plicants was 2649. while the Chicano
pool was 446. Native American medi
cal school applicants numbered 147,
and Puerto Rican applicants totaled

655.
The Med School matriculated only
six of the 23 black students who were
accepted, provoking some speculation
that the school wasn't trying hard
enough to recruit some ethnic groups
that it accepts for admission.
Kedes rejected this notion, adding
that the Med School uses the same re
cruiting methods as the Law School,
which matriculated 20 of the 41 black
students it accepted for its first-year
class this year.
According to Kedes, the Med School
sends representatives to all black stu
dents who are accepted. In addition,
the students are invited to visit Stan
ford — with all expenses paid.
The Med School plans to hire a new
assistant director to help with minor
ity recruitment, Kedes added. Much
of the Law School's recent success in
minority recruitment, he noted, is at
tributable to the efforts of La Doris
Cordell, a new assistant dean.
The Med School's minority en
rollment figures generally are better
than those of several other prominent
medical schools surveyed informally
by the Daily.
At Harvard Medical School, minor
ity enrollment is 21 percent — a
number based on those that agreed to
enroll as of last April. The first-year
class is 14 percent black. Stanford's
first-year class is 7 percent black
However, Harvard enrolled 4 percent
Chicano students, whereas Stanford
matriculated 15 percent Chicanos.
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine
enrolled 18 percent minorities in its
regular program. The school was 16
percent black and 1 percent Chicano.
Twenty percent of the 144 first-year
students at UCLA's medical school
were minorities. The school gave no

breakdown on the percentages of indi
vidual ethnic groups.
Other schools have had a poorer
track record
Northwestern Medical School en
rolled only 4 percent minorities in its
4-vear program and 6-vear honors pro
gram This percentage included 3
percent black students and 1 percent

"other."
Finally, 3 percent of the University
of Chicago's first-year medical school
class were minorities.
Stanford's percentage of women en
rollees — 36 — was higher than at any
other school surveyed. Northwestern
had 31 percent first-year women medi
cal students; Johns Hopkins followed
closely, having 30 percent women.


University clerical workers have collected enough signatures to start the proc
ess toward the possible creation of a bargaining unit which would be a part of
United Stanford Employees. Shown above is a meeting of office workers held
last year.
