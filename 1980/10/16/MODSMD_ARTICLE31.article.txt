# A 						puzzle whose pieces don't fit

### Steve Vineberg 
When we think back to a Nicolas Roeg
movie we saw some time ago. we may
not be able to remember what it was
about, but some of the images remain
sharp. I forgot almost all of Performance
a month after I'd seen it. but Mick Jag
ger's androgynous aggressiveness, his
languid, lascivious possession of that big
bed stayed in my mind.
From Don't Look Now 1 have retained
the love scene between Donald
Sutherland and Julie Christie — in which
shots of them getting dressed are in
tercut with the lovemaking — and the
scary stoned look in Julie Christie's eyes
when she blamed Sutherland for their
child's death. My memories of The Man
Who Fell to Earth are centered on those
eerie opening shots of David Bowie walk
ing around a surreal landscape.
Bad Timing/A Sensual Obsession,
which Roeg directed from a script by
Yale Udoff (an adaptation of a novel by
Constanzo Constanti). has two or three
such moments, all of them — as usual in
Roeg's work — strongly erotic. In one of
them. Theresa Russell and Art Gar
funkel lie on a bed. her legs are apart and
hangover the side; and the entire picture
is reflected in a mirror by the blurred
light of a flickering candle. It is a great
portrait of spent passion.
Roeg is a master at creating a sex
drenched atmosphere, and it is the first
element we sense in Bad liming, the
credits appear over a series of Klimt

paintings i the film is set in Vienna I -
celebrated decadence — and the first
music we hear is the lewd wino voice of
Tom Waits. But Bad Timing is a puzzle
picture of the 1960s Antonioni variety,
and most of it is pretty and blank
Art (iarfunkel plays Alex, a research
psychoanalyst obsessed i as the title tells
us) with Milena (Theresa Russell), they
are sleeping together, but when he is
asked by the U.S. Army to conduct an
analysis of an American and her Czech
husband, based on their files, he dis
covers that Milena is his assignment —
and he didn't know that she had ever
married.
Milena's past is a mystery to Alex, and
so is much of her present behavior: the
audience — and a police detective
(Harvey Keitel) — confront the addi
tional problem of Milena's attempted su
icide. which is the point from which the
film flashes back. Most of this is not es
pecially interesting, and Roeg's fancy
filmic devices — introducing sequences
that may or may not be fantasy, shooting
scenes from a definite personal point of
view but not telling us whose, playing the
characters' thoughts on the soundtrack
before they speak — confuse the movie
even more.
One critic is quoted in the ads for Bad
Timing as saying that Roeg makes mov
ies the way Picasso painted, but in this
movie the fragmentation seems random,
and when it is over the audience is still
searching for a way to look at what it has

just seen.
Roeg s biggest mistake. I think, was in
placing Art Gartunkel and Theresa Rus
sell at the center of the film, (iarfunkel
gives even less to the camera than Raul
Simon does in One-Trick Pony, he's
much worse, actually, because he has a
naturally effete superciliousness that is
very unpleasant to watch. We aren't
meant to like Alex, but we grow to de
spise him more and earlier than the
script calls for. There are so many shots
of him winding his fingers through his
afro that we wonder it that's supposed to
be a character detail — but Art Gar
tunkel does the same thing on talk shows.
Theresa Russell, who played Dustin
Hoffman's girl friend in Straight Time,
has an unfussy attractiveness, but as a
performer she is a little drab; she
doesn't suggest unsounded depths. But
Roeg has cast her in a role that is sup
posed to be a mixture of Louise Brooks in
Pandora's Box. Marlene Dietrich in The
Hlue Art gel. .Julie Christie in Darling,
and Liza Minnelli in Cabaret, and if it's
possible to play that kind of fusion at all.
it certainly isn't possible for Theresa
Russell.
Harvey Keitel is in the picture, too. but
his performance looks like a series of
out takes from Fingers. But Denholm El
liott. as Milena's estranged husband,
works up an intriguing character almost
out of thin air. The only mystery in this
movie worth investigating is how Klliott
does it — the secret of his craft.
