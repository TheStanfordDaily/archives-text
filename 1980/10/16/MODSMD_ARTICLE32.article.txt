New York is an unlikely place
for a Polish film to begin, but it
is an Kast European woman's
impressions of her first days in
New York that open Andrej Wa
jda's new film The Conductor.
screened at the San Francisco
Film Festival last Saturday.
Slawomir Idziak's nimble cam
era races around from sky
scraper to skyscraper to the
bums that line the Big Apple's
streets
It is here that Marta
(Krystyna Jandai. a young
Polish violinist on a grant,
meets Jan Lasocki (John
Ciielgudt. a world famous ex
patriate orchestra conductor
who came from the same pro
vincial town as Marta Lasocki
was in love with Marta's mother
and so it is with a fascination
with both her past and Lasocki's
music that Marta pursues him.

For Lasocki. Marta provides
a link with his past, a link that
breathes a freshness that is
lacking into his overscheduled
life Lasocki decides to go back
to his home town, which he left
half a century ago. and to per
form the work that made him fa
mous. Beethoven's sth. with the
local orchestra
Marta's letters to her hus
band Adam (Adrzej Sewervni.
who is himself an aspiring con
ductor. arouse his jealousy,
which grows when Lasocki ar
rives and begins slowly to take
control of Adam's orchestra
Adam is jealous of the 80-year
old man because deep down he
knows he will never be as good a
conductor, and never draw the
same admiration from Marta.
The film's political angle
comes from a sharp criticism of
opportunists who are willing to
sell out their ideals. Adam is

lust such a man. His style of
conducting is a combination of
threat and reprimand, both
combined with hysterics. In
contrast Lasocki's style is calm
and confident There is an ar
rogance to the old man. but it is
an arrogance combined with an
uncompromising love of music
which enables him to inspire
confidence in Adam's provincial
orchestra.
Adam will go to any lengths to
get ahead and save his ego He is
even willing to sell out his own
musicians. As the Maestro's
performance begins to draw in
ternational attention, including
television coverage, the author
ities in Warsaw worry about
Adam's smalltown band.
Wouldn't Adam like to take on a
few of Warsaw's best musi
cians' 1 It is his patriotic duty, af
ter all. to give Polish music a
good name. Adam's dealings

with his wife are no better — his
hysterics force her to cancel out
of the performance Why does
she tolerate this man" He needs
her. she says
ilielgud. as Lasocki. person
ifies the kind of inner strength
that age sometimes gives to
those that survive it It is the
wisdom and tranquility of peo
ple who are full of life and yet
are no longer driven bv ambi
tion Lasocki is an almost fair
ytale character, especially be
cause he dies while sitting
among fans who are waiting out
the night to get tickets for his
concert
One gets the feeling that Wa
jda has made the film less be
lievable by not making it subtle
enough. Adam makes too much
of a fool of himself when in rage
he tries to break his baton in half
and trips in full view of the or
chestra. And Lasocki is perhaps
too much of a wonderful old
man
The effect of the whole, how
ever. is moving, with good per
formances from all. One hopes
that Polish cinema will continue
to be as inventive and human as
Wajda has made it to be.
In contrast to the humanness
and lightness of The Conductor,
Nikita Mikhalkov's .4 Few Days
of 1.1. Oblomov's Life is heavy
handed and lifeless. -4 Few
Days, the Russian entrv in the
festival, is the stuff that cures
for insomnia are made of.
Dream on.
Ivan Goncharov's great novel
deserves better. The narrative
style which succeeds in the book
kills the film. It is plodding and
endless. We see countless
flashbacks of Oblomov's child
hood, which is filled with the or
der "not to wake up his mum
my." We see Oblomov in the
center of the screen asleep for
endless minutes as the narrator
drones on (I thought that film
was a visual medium).
The story is, in essence, very
modern. It is about a young
aristocrat who doesn't know
what to do with his life ( ring any
bells?). Oblomov decides to do
nothing, to sleep and dream —
this was before you could get
paid for it in the lab. What
forces him to wake from his per
petual slumber is passion for
Olga, more or less forced upon
him by his only and best friend
Stoltz. Stoltz and Oblomov grew
up together, and I guess that is
why we get those flashbacks.
Stoltz is an altogether dif
ferent character — he is a vege
tarian who believes in living
every conceivable second to the
fullest, and he takes it upon

himself to inspire his friend. So
while Oblomov falls passion
ately in love with Olga. and Olga
with him. it all seems to be a
grand plan of Stoltz's. When it
comes to the facts of life. Ob
lomov ends up on the weak side,
and Olga isn't about to throw
herself awav.
There are a few good mo
ments in the film; the actors try
hard and get some laughs, espe
cially Oleg Tabakov as Ob
lomov /The laughs, however,
came primarily from the Rus
sian community which made up
the vast majority of the stand
ing-room-onlv crowd Monday
night. I stayed awake, but my
friend beside me dreamt on for
a good portion of the 2 1 z hours.
