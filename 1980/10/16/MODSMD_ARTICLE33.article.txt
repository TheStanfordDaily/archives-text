# Madness at the Korner
## 
### Leo Dawber 
Alto Madness has once again struck the Bay
Area, and authorities report that it is highly
contagious. Richie Cole's hot jazz band is in
fecting the audiences at the Keystone Korner
in San Francisco this week, to whip up six eve
nings of exciting, slightly crazed be-bop.
Alto-sax-man Cole sometimes raises eye
brows among jazz "purists" tread "snobs "I
because of his hijinx onstage — nutty cos
tumes. outrageous doggerel and musical
stunts — but his complete mastery of the in
strument combined with his furious im
provisations leave no doubt as to the seri
ousness with which he makes music. The man
is simply overflowing with energy and good hu
mor. and happily shares it with his audience,
which almost always catches the fever as well.
At Tuesday night's opener, he stumbled on
stage, shyly approached the mike, and said
that the band had just arrived, so they would
ease into some blues to check out the sound sys
tem Immediately the group burst into a
speedv. searing version of Parker s "Relaxin
at Camarillo." a no-holds-barred version of the
bop standard. The audience shouted its ap
proval as Alto Madness began to take hold.
Cole's tone is sharp-edged, and he plays fast
lines with perfect timing and swinging intona
tion. But much of the excitement he generates
comes from turning those fast lines into growl
ing blues licks or smooth ballad melodies. His
imagination is just as fast as his fingers. He
eschews overblowing and squeaking for the
sake of making weird effects, though he is not
above adding "outside' notes and squawks for
emotional effect at the peak of a crescendo.
His groups achieve startling contrasts by
merging tunes and styles, for example the
Latin introduction to his version of the I Love
Lucy theme (that's right), which then ends
with a nod to the West Indian "St. Thomas."
On "Harlem Nocturne," Cole turned out some
incredible solo saxophone antics, fingers flut
tering up and down his instrument. A refer
ence. then, to a slow, bluish "Round Mid

night." and suddenly the combo entered behind
him at Mach 1.
Guitarist Bruce Foreman, the only band
member who played with Cole the last time he
was in town, is a great match for the altoist. In
addition to his ability to play jazz at breakneck
speeds, he brings facility with rock and blues
styles, with all the requisite intensity. On "To
kyo Hose Sings the Hollywood Blues." after

man tore into a solo that had all the power and
rasp of 8.8 King. His jazz solos are horn-like
in sound and conception, specializing in long,
single-note runs rather than chords, and he has
learned the art of constructing a solo that is
dramatic as well as musically satisfying.
Local pianist Dick Hindman was the anchor
for the quintet. When it seemed as if Cole and
Foreman were challenging each other to the
point of exploding. Hindman would take over
with a serene, spare, often delicate solo that
would bring things back to earth until the next
round of white-hot alto and guitar duelling.
Hindman also played two elegant pieces with
bass and drums alone, of which "Green
Dolphin Street" was particularly pleasing.
The only disappointment was drummer
Scott Morris. Though fine when loud, fast licks
were needed, the rest of his playing was closely
tied to the beat and was seldom interesting.
Worse, he seemed to distract the other players
at times because of his inability to respond to
the nuances of the constantly-changing per
formance.

space limitations, there is only one way to

space limitations, there is only one way to
communicate the fever of Alto Madness — to
expose oneself directly at Keystone Korner,
continuing now through this Sunday.
Alto Madness has once again struck the Bay
Area, and authorities report that it is highly
contagious. Richie Cole's hot jazz band is in
fecting the audiences at the Keystone Korner
in San Francisco this week, to whip up six eve
nings of exciting, slightly crazed be-bop.
Alto-sax-man Cole sometimes raises eye
brows among jazz "purists" tread "snobs "I
because of his hijinx onstage — nutty cos
tumes. outrageous doggerel and musical
stunts — but his complete mastery of the in
strument combined with his furious im
provisations leave no doubt as to the seri
ousness with which he makes music. The man
is simply overflowing with energy and good hu
mor. and happily shares it with his audience,
which almost always catches the fever as well.
At Tuesday night's opener, he stumbled on
stage, shyly approached the mike, and said
that the band had just arrived, so they would
ease into some blues to check out the sound sys
tem Immediately the group burst into a
speedv. searing version of Parker s "Relaxin
at Camarillo." a no-holds-barred version of the
bop standard. The audience shouted its ap
proval as Alto Madness began to take hold.
Cole's tone is sharp-edged, and he plays fast
lines with perfect timing and swinging intona
tion. But much of the excitement he generates
comes from turning those fast lines into growl
ing blues licks or smooth ballad melodies. His
imagination is just as fast as his fingers. He
eschews overblowing and squeaking for the
sake of making weird effects, though he is not
above adding "outside' notes and squawks for
emotional effect at the peak of a crescendo.
His groups achieve startling contrasts by
merging tunes and styles, for example the
Latin introduction to his version of the I Love
Lucy theme (that's right), which then ends
with a nod to the West Indian "St. Thomas."
On "Harlem Nocturne," Cole turned out some
incredible solo saxophone antics, fingers flut
tering up and down his instrument. A refer

night." and suddenly the combo entered behind
him at Mach 1.
Guitarist Bruce Foreman, the only band
member who played with Cole the last time he
was in town, is a great match for the altoist. In
addition to his ability to play jazz at breakneck
speeds, he brings facility with rock and blues
styles, with all the requisite intensity. On "To

man tore into a solo that had all the power and
rasp of 8.8 King. His jazz solos are horn-like
in sound and conception, specializing in long,
single-note runs rather than chords, and he has
learned the art of constructing a solo that is
dramatic as well as musically satisfying.
Local pianist Dick Hindman was the anchor
for the quintet. When it seemed as if Cole and
Foreman were challenging each other to the
point of exploding. Hindman would take over
with a serene, spare, often delicate solo that
would bring things back to earth until the next
round of white-hot alto and guitar duelling.
Hindman also played two elegant pieces with
bass and drums alone, of which "Green
Dolphin Street" was particularly pleasing.
The only disappointment was drummer
Scott Morris. Though fine when loud, fast licks
were needed, the rest of his playing was closely
tied to the beat and was seldom interesting.
