Members of the new Feminist Studies program here say
they are enthusiastic about prospects for a feminist cur
riculum at the University.
"It's a really good feeling to see things really moving .
and hear about all the good classes that are being
created.'' said Eva Lohrer. a member of the Feminist
Studies program committee.
"It's great to see the people who've been working so
hard getting it together and moving together." she added.
The program committee, charged with improving the
status of feminist studies at Stanford, met Monday in
Serra House. The 12-member committee includes repre
sentatives from faculty, staff and students of the Univer
sity.
The committee decided to focus its energies on cur
riculum development and counseling for students design
ing independent Feminist Studies majors.
Other primary concerns include student outreach, de
veloping financial resources, and structuring the program
to meet the needs of Stanford students.
The Feminist Studies program was created this year in
response to a study completed last March called "Report
of the Task Force on the Study of Women at Stanford. "
The Task Force was proposed by Diane Middlebrook in
response to a growing community interest in feminist
studies. After members were appointed by the Policy
Board of the Center for Research on Women, the Task
Force met during the spring and fall quarters of 1979 to
give a feminist view of the academic program at Stanford.

After examining existing resources, researching the
needs of the Stanford community, and examining feminist
programs at other institutions, the Task Force called for
an expanded program of feminist academic studies.
' The need for the feminist studies committee to develop
a program is a very important goal for Stanford right
now." said Nannerl keohane. associate professor of politi
cal science. Keohane is a faculty member of the program
committee.
"It seems clear from the amount of enthusiasm on the
part of everybody involved — the people planning classes
as well as those attending the classes — and the kind of
energy that exists, that this is serving a real need." she
said.
A key purpose of the committee will be to provide a fcul
tv and resources network for students wishing to do spe
cial projects or in other ways combine a feminist outlook
with their studies in established academic departments.
Although the Human Biology major and the in
terdisciplinary English major have allowed some students
to successfully combine their interests in feminism and
other fields, feminist students in other departments have
often had to modify their curriculum in order to reflect
mainstream perspectives, according to program coordi
nators.
English Prof. Anne Mellor. a faculty representative on
the program committee, said. "The forum for a feminist
critique of every discipline taught here is of vital im
portance to the consciousness of graduates and under
graduates."
