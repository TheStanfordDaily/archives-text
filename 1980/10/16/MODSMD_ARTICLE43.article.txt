Battle rages over Iranian refinery
Beirut, Lebanon — An air and artillery battle raged yes
terday in the Persian Gulf war for control of Iran s huge
refinerv complex at Abadan. the objective of a major Iraqi
attack
Tehran radio said that the Iraqi forces had been driven
back. But a report from Abadan radio inside the
beleaguered city on the northeast bank of the Shatt al Arab
waterway indicated that Iraqi troops were trying to in
filtrate the sprawling refinery area.
At the same time, both sides reported intensified air ac
tivity as the war ended its 24th day
Meanwhile, the Soviet I'nion is shipping small amounts
of military supplies to Iran through a rail line between the
two countries, but the supply is too small to affect the out
come of the Iran-Iraq war. U.S. officials said yesterday.
The sources said the Soviet equipment appears to be the
latest installment of military supply contracts between
the two countries that date back to the reign of the deposed
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi In those days, the Soviets
were the source of some less-sophisticated Iranian mili
tary gear, especially for ground forces
Iraq admitted that Iranian fighter-bombers had hit the
capital of Baghdad for the second straight day. but said
that its forces shot down two of the attacking planes, is
well as another one over Abadan.
In turn. Iraq said its planes struck at an oil refinery at
Tabriz, capital of Iran's big northwestern province of
Azerbaijan, setting fire to petroleum installations there.
The day's fighting came as the U.N Security Council in
New York opened its debate on the war. which began on
Sept. 22 when Iraqi forces pushed into the Iranian province
of Khuzistan and other frontier areas.
Peace summit postponed during talks
Washington — The Mideast peace summit meeting of
President Jimmy Carter and the leaders of Egvpt and Is
rael. which had been expected to take place next month,
will have to be set back until December or next year, of
ficials of the three countries said yesterday.
That change in the timetable became known as nego
tiators ended the latest round of talks on a Palestinian au
tonomv agreement. While asserting that the two-day ses
sion here had produced "encouraging signs of progress''
on some issues, the negotiators also conceded that con
siderable work remains before the point is reached where
a summit meeting could wrap up an agreement.
Despite a gesture by Israel, a new round of negotiations
with Egypt over Palestinian autonomy appears to be pro
ducing little headway toward an agreement.
But in an effort to make progress. American mediators
were trying to put together a draft of areas of potential
agreement.
They discussed the revised U.S. formula today with Is
raeli officials before the three delegations returned to a
joint session to review the compromise attempt as well as
separate American. Egyptian and Israeli plans for the
election of a Palestinian council.
At a news conference. Sol Linowitz. the U.S. mediator in
the talks, said a summit this year "may still be in the
cards." But he also said he would be "very surprised" if
the next round of autonomy negotiations, set for Nov. 17 in
the Middle East, "could be the only one required prior to a
summit."
Egyptian Vice President Hosni Mubarak, in Washington
for separate meetings with Carter and other adminis
tration officials, was even more specific. Following a
meeting with Secretary of State Edmund Muskie.
Mubarak told reporters that since very careful prepara
tion is required for a successful summit, his government
doubts that the meeting could be scheduled before Janu-

British Labor Party leader resigns
London — Former Prime Minister James Callaghan
vesterday resigned as leader of Britain's opposition Labor
Party, setting the stage tor a battle for eontrol between the
party's feuding left and right-wings.
Callaghan. 68. bowed to the urging of Labor's right
wing. determined to try to install another moderate party
chief before new leadership selection rules, favoring the
left, are scheduled to be drawn up early next year.
Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healev. 63,
looked almost certain to succeed Callaghan early in No
vember The annual leadership elections take place then
under old rules, restricting the franchise to the largely
moderate Labor members of Parliament.
Callaghan. prime minister from April 1976 until his de
teat in May 1979 by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party, announced his decision to a meeting of top parlia
mentarv aides at his office in the House of Commons.
The burly six-footer left the meeting and told reporters

new leader as quickly as possible'' before the new session
of Parliament opens Nov. 13.
China protests Taiwan status here
Beijing — China yesterday formally protested the U.S.
action to cive diplomatic status to Nationalist Chinese rep
resentatives and warned that the Taiwan issue is quickly
becoming a serious obstacle to further improvement in
Sino-American relations.
Leonard Woodcock, the U.S. ambassador to Beijing,
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry yesterday after
noon to receive the Chinese protest, the toughest of three
issued so far this year over U.S. ties with Taiwan.
The Chinese note charged that the American action two
weeks ago openly violated the understanding between Bei
jing and Washington that future U.S. relations with
Taiwan would be confined to commercial, cultural and
other unofficial links. Granting the Nationalist represent
atives diplomatic status is tantamount, in the Chinese
view, to re-establishing official relations, the protest said.
Chinese officials later said that, while Beijing is gener
allv pleased with progress in relations with Washington,
concern is growing here that the United States still does
not appreciate the great sensitivity of the Taiwan issue.
China sees its sovereignty involved and fears that the
question will become a recurrent one haunting the new re
lationship.
Chinese sources noted that some prominent Americans
want to pursue a two-China'' policy, having full relations
with both China and Taiwan. Republican presidential can
didate Ronald Reagan advocated such a course, until the
resulting controversy forced him to retreat.
Beijing is prepared to act firmly if the United States
ever adopts such a policy, the officials said, giving no de
tails but citing the break-off Tuesday of the sister-city re
lationship between Los Angeles and Canton. The Los An
geles City Council had proclaimed last Friday. Taiwan's
national day. as Republic of China Day"in the city, and
the Nationalist Chinese flag was flown at city hall.
If the Chinese are worried about a Reagan victory, now
widely accepted as a strong possibility, they also are in
creasingly disappointed by the Carter administration's
handling of Sino-American relations.

tion of the Peripheral Canal, which would ship Northern
California water south, has qualified for the state ballot.

danger tish and wildlife

prove the Delta's fresh water supply by ending the present
reverse flow caused by pumps drawing water from the
lower channels of the Delta

Cuba aims for normalized relations
Havana— Cuba is stepping up conciliatory moves
toward Washington in the hope that a Carter victory in the
I S. presidential election next month will help to nor
malize relations between the two countries, observers
here believe.
The current atmosphere of detente is a striking contrast
with the situation in April when in the wake of the invasion
of the Peruvian Embassy by some 10,800 Cubans seeking
asylum. Havana authorized unrestricted emigration.
The result was a mass exodus from the port of Mariel to
the United States, with some 130,000 refugees arriving in
Florida in the space of a few weeks.
Now it is evident that Cuban officials favor Carter's re
election in the hope of one day starting negotiations that
could resolve the disputes between Havana and Washing
ton
Cuban President Fidel Castro is counting on Carter
rather than his Republican rival. Ronald Reagan, to satis
fy Cuban demands for lifting the 19-vear-old trade em
bargo. the return of the Naval base at Guantanamo to Cuba
and a halt to U.S. aerial spying missions over the island.

ordinating council with authority to pass on any project
there in which the federal government has some role. This
