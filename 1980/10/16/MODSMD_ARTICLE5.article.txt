# Perrier and fitness group team up to bring new exercise course to campus
## 
### Chris Butchko 
Water and waistlines may enter into a new re
lationship this fall with the opening of the Per
rier-Parcourse "fitness trail" around Roble
Hall.
Perrier, bottler of effervescent water, and
Parcourse Limited, an international fitness con
cern. are hoping this inverse relationship — in
volving water consumption increase as waist
lines decrease — will be a profitable one.
Funding stall
Billed as a "balanced, self-guiding fitness sys
tem for the '80s," the trail was ready for campus
construction in 1978.
A lack of funds, however, prevented the trail's
installation until Bruce Nevins, president of Per
rier and a Stanford MBA, offered to provide the
University with the trial if it paid for the trail's
installation costs.
The University paid $2000 for the course's in
stallation (rather than the $6400 for the entire set
up) and became one of 200 communities which
now have the trail.
Perrier and Parcourse will cut the ribbons of
the project this Halloween. Oct. 31, in a dedi
cation and orientation ceremony.
Off and running
The noontime ceremony, held in conjunction
with the Stanford Intramural Dept., will include

an inaugural "Run, Hop, Leap and Jump" com
petition. Winners will receive Perrier-Parcourse
t-shifts. And the refreshments? Perrier, of
course.
The course is similar to the Olympic
Gamefield across campus at Angell P'ield.
The main idea behind the trail, according to
Mike Calhoun, president of Parcourse, is
cardiovascular fitness.
Three different groups of exercises are used:
warm-ups and stretching, strengthening and ton
ing. and cardiovascular conditioning.
The course is designed to exercise both the ma
jor muscle groups of the skeletal system and the
heart and blood vessel network.
The stretching section is designed to extend
muscles and tendons and increase the range of
motion of the joints.
Exercises that strengthen muscles also reduce
their flexibility, thus leading to strains and
cramps during sudden activity. The first four sta
tions are designed for stretching, as are the last
two. which serves to gradually warm up and later
cool down the athlete.
Such ordinary exercises as toe touching and
knee lifts are combined with such apparatus as a
balance beam to increase co-ordination.
Exercises get strenuous
The middle stations include more strenuous

exercises, designed to strengthen the larger
muscles. This part balances common fitness reg
imens such as sit-ups, chin-ups, and push-ups
with coordination exercises on vaulting, slanting
and parallel bars.
The cardiovascular conditioning is repre
sented by the acronym FIT. This stands for fre
quency. or regularity of exercise, intensity, or
the vigor of your training regimen, and time,
which is used to judge your heart rate. A gradu
ated scale is used to measure the time the ath
lete's heart spends in a highly active state.
Before the first station stands a large chart ex
plaining the "heart check - ' system, and shows
how the heart rate can be used as a guide to safe
exercise. Participants are advised to run. jog or
walk briskly through stations four to 16. The
course runs approximately l'a miles and takes
about 25 minutes to complete-
No night runs
The Parcourse. because it is unlit and crosses
through wooded areas, was not recommended for
nighttime use.
Parcourse brought the "fitness trail" idea
from Kurope in 1973. Perrier decided to sponsor
the trails to show its "commitment to a total fit
ness program." said Kathy Copeland. a
Parcourse representative.

Gamefield across campus at Angell P'ield.
The main idea behind the trail, according to
Mike Calhoun, president of Parcourse, is
cardiovascular fitness.
Three different groups of exercises are used:
warm-ups and stretching, strengthening and ton
ing. and cardiovascular conditioning.
The course is designed to exercise both the ma
jor muscle groups of the skeletal system and the
heart and blood vessel network.
The stretching section is designed to extend
muscles and tendons and increase the range of
motion of the joints.
Exercises that strengthen muscles also reduce
their flexibility, thus leading to strains and
cramps during sudden activity. The first four sta
tions are designed for stretching, as are the last
two. which serves to gradually warm up and later
cool down the athlete.
Such ordinary exercises as toe touching and
knee lifts are combined with such apparatus as a
balance beam to increase co-ordination.
Exercises get strenuous
The middle stations include more strenuous

exercises, designed to strengthen the larger
muscles. This part balances common fitness reg
imens such as sit-ups, chin-ups, and push-ups
with coordination exercises on vaulting, slanting
and parallel bars.
The cardiovascular conditioning is repre
sented by the acronym FIT. This stands for fre
quency. or regularity of exercise, intensity, or
the vigor of your training regimen, and time,
which is used to judge your heart rate. A gradu
ated scale is used to measure the time the ath
lete's heart spends in a highly active state.
Before the first station stands a large chart ex
plaining the "heart check - ' system, and shows
how the heart rate can be used as a guide to safe
exercise. Participants are advised to run. jog or
walk briskly through stations four to 16. The
course runs approximately l'a miles and takes
about 25 minutes to complete-
No night runs
The Parcourse. because it is unlit and crosses
through wooded areas, was not recommended for
nighttime use.
Parcourse brought the "fitness trail" idea
from Kurope in 1973. Perrier decided to sponsor
the trails to show its "commitment to a total fit
ness program." said Kathy Copeland. a
Parcourse representative.

Perrier and Parcourse Limited, a physical fitness concern, have brought
a lVi-mile exercise course to campus. The exercise stations for the
course, which starts in front of Rohie, comprise three groups of exercises.
Water and waistlines may enter into a new re
lationship this fall with the opening of the Per
rier-Parcourse "fitness trail" around Roble
Hall.
Perrier, bottler of effervescent water, and
Parcourse Limited, an international fitness con
cern. are hoping this inverse relationship — in
volving water consumption increase as waist
lines decrease — will be a profitable one.
Funding stall
Billed as a "balanced, self-guiding fitness sys
tem for the '80s," the trail was ready for campus
construction in 1978.
A lack of funds, however, prevented the trail's
installation until Bruce Nevins, president of Per
rier and a Stanford MBA, offered to provide the
University with the trial if it paid for the trail's
installation costs.
The University paid $2000 for the course's in
stallation (rather than the $6400 for the entire set
up) and became one of 200 communities which
now have the trail.
Perrier and Parcourse will cut the ribbons of
the project this Halloween. Oct. 31, in a dedi
cation and orientation ceremony.
Off and running
The noontime ceremony, held in conjunction
with the Stanford Intramural Dept., will include

an inaugural "Run, Hop, Leap and Jump" com
petition. Winners will receive Perrier-Parcourse
t-shifts. And the refreshments? Perrier, of
course.
The course is similar to the Olympic
Gamefield across campus at Angell P'ield.
