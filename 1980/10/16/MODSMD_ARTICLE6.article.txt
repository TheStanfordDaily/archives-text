## Hungary looks to West for growth 
### Los Angeles Times 
Budapest, Hungary Gov
ernment planners, looking five
years ahead, see only limited
possibilities for increasing their
coveted trade with the West
They are being forced to think
small, lowering growth expec
tations in the face of continuing
economic troubles that are not
theirs alone
They have the satisfaction,
however, of having what many
Western observers think is the
soundest economy among the
Soviet bloc nations of Kastern
Kurope
"It will be a modest plan." a
leader of the Chamber of Com
merce acknowledged, speaking
of the national 5-year plan that
will go into effect in January
But the plan will pursue the
course of continued liber
alization of the economy that
has given Hungary such a lead
over the other Soviet bloc na
tions since it was adopted in

Despite the problems of the
moment, leaders are planning
to give priority now to the more
painful reorganization steps
that were postponed 12 years
ago These are designed to win
more efficiency from the en
terprises. with the possibility of
a modest increase in the private
sector
Consultation on the 5-year
plan has set something of a re

asked to comment on the plan as
proposed There seems no ques

retary ot the Hungarian Com
munist Party and the man who
runs the country, will be in
fluenced by what he hears even
though it is the party that will

make the decisions
He demonstrated his sensi
tivity to his constituents earlier
this year by banning, with a sin
gle order, almost all of the con
spicuous Mercedes Benz sedans

the enterprises.

What the Hungarians need is
a surplus in their trade yvith the
West to help service their debt,
which is estimated at $8 billion,
and to get on yvith the acquisi
tion of higher technology tools.
So they watch the West with
care.
Hungary depends on that im

trade in convertible currencies

freedom from the economic
domination of Moscow

trade is with the nations of the

Hungary wants to be ready to
ride any increasing trade possi
bilities So there is a focus on
what economists call "export
capability."
In the meantime, they wel
come Western ties and invest
ments. This year, for example.
Hungary authorized for the first
time direct loans from private
Western European banks to in
dividual socialist enterprises,
no longer tunneling the money
through the national bank.
In January, the government
tied most'of the nation's pro
ducer prices to the world mar
ket. A majority of consumer
prices had been decontrolled
last year.after careful prepara
tion of the people that apparent
ly prevented the kind of disrup
tive resistance that has brought
Poland to crisis.
Planners are confident that
the stringent controls on growth
that are now in effect will not re
sult in a cut in real incomes. It
remains to be seen whether rel
ative stagnation in the standard
of living is satisfactory for a
population already troubled by
inadequate housing and the first
real pinch of inflation.
