United States and Soviet of
ficials met in Geneva. Switzer
land. on September 26 to ex
change information about the
retirement of U S Polaris mis
sile submarines and Soviet Yan
kee class missile submarines.
This meeting of the Standing
Consultative Committee (SCO.
a permanent body set up under
the SALT 1 Treaty of 1972. was
cited by the Carter adminis
tration as a sign that the Soviets
have not given up on the arms
limitation process
However. Coit Blacker, assis
tant director of Stanford's Arms
Control and Disarmament Pro
gram. found a more mundane
significance in the conclave.
The Soviets have nothing to
lose by continuing the SCC
meetings, according to Blacker.
Indeed, bv not attending the
meeting the Soviets would send
"an enormously strong signal
of animositv to the U S . he said
Political Science Prot
Alexander George explained he
could not determine the actual
motives of the Soviet SCC nego
tiators. Nevertheless. George

explained some possible theo
ries on the subject.
According to George, one the
orv states the Soviet Union was
testing U.S. Intel lige nee
capabilities through the SCC.
The Soviet Union can gauge the
effectiveness of American in
telligence bv observing the is
sues brought up in SCC meet
ings. George said.
"Another possibility is that
the Soviets use the SCC to dis
cover which interpretations of
SALT standards will and will
not be acceptable to the United
States." George said.
Blacker said he favors a com
mitment to arms control beyond
that of the SCC ratification of
SALT II The SALT II Treaty
would provide two prime advan
tages to the U.S.. Blacker said
First, the treaty would begin
to put a quantitative cap on the
number of nuclear launch sys
tems in the United States and
the Soviet Union.
Second, the treaty would
eliminate the need for what
Blacker called "worst case
planning" on the part of both na

tions. Under worst case plan
ning. each nation assumes its
adversary is- increasing its nu
clear stockpile at the fastest
possible rate and responds in
kind, he explained.
The SALT II Treaty provides
a quantitative limit on most nu
clear weapons, thus eliminating
the tendency towards rapid in
creases in stockpiles and allow
ing each side to know the other's
real capabilities, he said.
There are few verification
problems in the SALT II Treaty
and the listening stations lost in
the Iranian Revolution were
"very minor" when compared
to the overall verification pic
ture. Blacker said.
Blacker said the ratification
of the SALT II Treaty would be
superior to Ronald Reagan's
proposition that the treaty be
scrapped and renegotiated from
a position of strength.
Reagan assumes that be
cause of superior technology we
could have an arms race with
the Soviets and win. Chances
are that in such a race, both
sides would lose." he concluded.
