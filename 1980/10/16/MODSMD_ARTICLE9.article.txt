# Recovering from cultural revolution
## Chinese theater survives oppression

From the l);ulv wire services
Beijing — Once upon a time,
the one kiss and one hug in
Shakespeare's "The Merchant
of Venice'' were enough to
titillate any American high
school class. Now they've got
Beijing in an uproar.
The Bard's suspenseful depic
tion of love overcoming all is the
lirst of his plays staged by a na
tional (governmenti theater
since the People's Republic was
founded in 1949. To some
western eyes, it's a stunning

concoction of Western drama
and eastern stagecraft. To
puritan Marxists, however, it's
pornography.
"It really violates public mo
rality and endangers our stan
dards and traditions when ac
tors and actresses indulge in
embraces and kisses in front of
the audience." said a fuming
letter to the Beijing evening
News signed by a "government
official."
And "several young chaps,
aged 20-odd years, not at all
feudal in our thinking" inquired
of the Evening News: "Is it only
embraces and kisses that can
express pure love? ... Let the ac
tors and actresses express their
love behind the curtain." In all.
nearly 700 writers were aroused
enough to take pen in hand after
the play's Sept. 3 opening.
Such a debate is hardly un
usual in China It was just such a
controversy over a play by a
contemporary Chinese writer
and politician that became the
initial battleground of the Cul
tural Revolution in 1965. That
play — into which Mao Zedong's
wife. Jiang CJing. read all sorts
of ominous political meaning —
was banned and the author ban
ished. Within months, the whole
of China's intelligentsia had
been terrorized. The country
still hasn't recovered from what
the press calls "10 years of
calamity."
Fifteen years later, however,
there's a difference. Despite the
new production's direct affront
to Maoist orthodoxy, the curtain
still rises every evening at 7:15
at the China Youth Art Theater

on Peking's main boulevard,
and in Act 111 Bosishia (Portia)
goes right on kissing Basanio
(Bassanio). And instead of
quaking because of the public
criticism, directress Zhang
.Jihong's cast is jubilant and the
play sold out.
It remains to be seen whether
events justify the actors' non
chalance. The intelligentsia
dropped its guard once before,
during Mao's "hundred
flowers" campaign of 1957. only
to be persecuted the next year in
the "anti-rightist" purge.
Nevertheless, there seems
little doubt that China's artists,
writers and composers have
been gaining over party censors
since February, when a modern
muralist's decorous nudes were
screened at the new Peking air
port terminal three months af
ter it opened to the public.
Indeed. Zhang Jihong's ori
ginal and engaging 'production
of "The Merchant of Venice" is
turning out to be a plav-within
a-plav in the best
Shakespearean tradition. The
main action has global signifi
cance. pitting the Marxist tradi
tion of orthodoxy against Chi
na's long-suppressed creative
energy.
Mao. borrowing from Lenin,
set the rules very clearly in a
1942 speech to artists and
writers: "Literature and art
must fit into the whole revolu
tionary machine as a compo
nent part and operate as pow
erful weapons for uniting and
educating the people and for at
tacking and destroying the ene
my." In short, no art for art's

sake. From then on. except for
the brief "hundred flowers"
months, the output of Chinese
culture has been thin gruel, in
deed — and never thinner than
when Mao's wife ruled the arts.
During that time it became
obvious to thwarted modernizer
Deng Xiaoping, or at least the
circle around him. that China
couldn't catch up with the in
dustrial world unless it liber
ated people's minds — even ar
tistic people. One of the least
perceived but most significant
struggles of Deng's three years
in power has been between par
tisans of the Maoist line and the
newly hopeful intellectuals.
When Peking convened the
"Fourth Conference on Liter
ature and the Arts" in Decem
ber. the battle was still in doubt.
Now it appears that Deng's po
litical victory over the ad
versaries of modernization was
a victory for artists as well.
Directress Zhang said she
wasn't at all surprised by the
rumpus over the kiss. "With 800
million Chinese having nothing
to see for 10 years but Jiang
Qing's eight model operas." she
said, "it's quite natural for the
audience to be surprised." Yu
Diaqin. who plays Portia, in
sists that her performance of
the Third Act kiss, after
Bassanio has solved a riddle
posed by Portia's father and
thereby won her hand, hasn't
been altered a bit by the adverse
publicity. It really isn't much of
a kiss anyway — only the lips
touch, for about three seconds.
But in China's centuries-old
stage traditions, even that is
revolutionary.

said, "it's quite natural for the
audience to be surprised." Yu
Diaqin. who plays Portia, in
sists that her performance of
the Third Act kiss, after
Bassanio has solved a riddle
posed by Portia's father and
thereby won her hand, hasn't
been altered a bit by the adverse
publicity. It really isn't much of
a kiss anyway — only the lips
touch, for about three seconds.
But in China's centuries-old
stage traditions, even that is
revolutionary.
From the l);ulv wire services
Beijing — Once upon a time,
the one kiss and one hug in
Shakespeare's "The Merchant
of Venice'' were enough to
titillate any American high
school class. Now they've got
Beijing in an uproar.
The Bard's suspenseful depic
tion of love overcoming all is the
lirst of his plays staged by a na
tional (governmenti theater
since the People's Republic was
founded in 1949. To some
western eyes, it's a stunning

concoction of Western drama
and eastern stagecraft. To
puritan Marxists, however, it's
pornography.
"It really violates public mo
rality and endangers our stan
dards and traditions when ac
tors and actresses indulge in
embraces and kisses in front of
the audience." said a fuming
letter to the Beijing evening
News signed by a "government
official."
And "several young chaps,
aged 20-odd years, not at all
feudal in our thinking" inquired
of the Evening News: "Is it only
embraces and kisses that can
express pure love? ... Let the ac
tors and actresses express their
love behind the curtain." In all.
nearly 700 writers were aroused
enough to take pen in hand after
the play's Sept. 3 opening.
Such a debate is hardly un
usual in China It was just such a
controversy over a play by a
contemporary Chinese writer
and politician that became the
initial battleground of the Cul
tural Revolution in 1965. That
play — into which Mao Zedong's
wife. Jiang CJing. read all sorts
of ominous political meaning —
was banned and the author ban
ished. Within months, the whole
of China's intelligentsia had
been terrorized. The country
still hasn't recovered from what
the press calls "10 years of
calamity."
Fifteen years later, however,
there's a difference. Despite the
new production's direct affront
to Maoist orthodoxy, the curtain
still rises every evening at 7:15
at the China Youth Art Theater

on Peking's main boulevard,
and in Act 111 Bosishia (Portia)
goes right on kissing Basanio
(Bassanio). And instead of
quaking because of the public
criticism, directress Zhang
.Jihong's cast is jubilant and the
play sold out.
It remains to be seen whether
events justify the actors' non
chalance. The intelligentsia
dropped its guard once before,
during Mao's "hundred
flowers" campaign of 1957. only
to be persecuted the next year in
the "anti-rightist" purge.
Nevertheless, there seems
little doubt that China's artists,
writers and composers have
been gaining over party censors
since February, when a modern
muralist's decorous nudes were
screened at the new Peking air
port terminal three months af
ter it opened to the public.
Indeed. Zhang Jihong's ori
ginal and engaging 'production
of "The Merchant of Venice" is
turning out to be a plav-within
a-plav in the best
Shakespearean tradition. The
main action has global signifi
cance. pitting the Marxist tradi
tion of orthodoxy against Chi
na's long-suppressed creative
energy.
Mao. borrowing from Lenin,
set the rules very clearly in a
1942 speech to artists and
writers: "Literature and art
must fit into the whole revolu
tionary machine as a compo
nent part and operate as pow
erful weapons for uniting and
educating the people and for at
tacking and destroying the ene
my." In short, no art for art's

sake. From then on. except for
the brief "hundred flowers"
months, the output of Chinese
culture has been thin gruel, in
deed — and never thinner than
when Mao's wife ruled the arts.
During that time it became
obvious to thwarted modernizer
Deng Xiaoping, or at least the
circle around him. that China
couldn't catch up with the in
dustrial world unless it liber
ated people's minds — even ar
tistic people. One of the least
perceived but most significant
struggles of Deng's three years
in power has been between par
tisans of the Maoist line and the
newly hopeful intellectuals.
When Peking convened the
"Fourth Conference on Liter
ature and the Arts" in Decem
ber. the battle was still in doubt.
Now it appears that Deng's po
litical victory over the ad
versaries of modernization was
a victory for artists as well.
Directress Zhang said she
wasn't at all surprised by the
rumpus over the kiss. "With 800
million Chinese having nothing
to see for 10 years but Jiang
Qing's eight model operas." she
said, "it's quite natural for the
audience to be surprised." Yu
