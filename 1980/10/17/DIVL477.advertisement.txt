When you ask good
friends for a favor, you know
what they're going to say. So
you tell them you're moving
again and then wait for the
groans to stop. They may not
like the idea, but you know
they're going to be there.
When you're finished, these
people are going to deserve
something special. Tonight,
let it be Lowenbrau.
Lowenbrau. Here's to good friends.
