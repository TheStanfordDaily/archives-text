# Plan to modernize Hospital approved
## 
### David Frank 
A $114.8 million plan to modernize Stanford Hospital was approved Tuesday
by the University's Board of Trustees.
The first stage of the plan calls for completion of the unfinished portion of the
hospital's north wing, which opened in 1976, as well as construction of a low-cost
building nearby to house support activities and the remodeling of present facil
ities.
This stage will provide needed space for cardiology, radiology, transfusion
service, pharmacy, facilities department, medical records, materials storage
and cafeteria.
New north wing
The second stage of the plan will be the construction of a new four-story wing
to the north of the hospital. Officials said construction on the new wing will be
gin in late 1982. but precise dates will depend on timing of approvals from local
and state health planners and city and county agencies.
The new wing will provide space for 12 operating rooms, renovation of 14 ex
isting ones, 43 intensive care beds, 44 pediatric beds, and 56 medical and sur
gical beds.
Also included in the second stage are plans to upgrade Hoover Pavilion to
bring it into compliance with earthquake safety standards.
Despite the extensive building and remodeling called for in the mod
ernization plans, the two stages will not add to the hospital's present licensed
bed capacity of 663 beds, according to Peter Levin, hospital executive director.
Rather, the plan will provide for more efficient utilization of existing beds, he
said.
Space problems
A planning study prepared by Levin and Vice President for Medical Affairs
Lawrence Crowley cited lack of space as one of the hospital's primary deficien
cies.
"Stanford's square footage per bed is barely half the national average for
teaching hospitals," said Levin and Crowley in an 110-page report outlining the
hospital's options. In addition, they wrote, operating rooms are inadequate
"Patient care demand already exceeds operating room capacity, and some
growth is expected over the next decade," they said. "The hospital faces seri
ous problems in this area with patient waiting lists, and surgeons having to op
erate during evenings and weekends."
Funding sources
The modernization project is expected to be financed by a combination of
private borrowing, hospital reserves, and gifts, according to Levin.
In addition. Levin said, the hospital has gained authorization to seek funding
through revenue bonds issued by the California Health Facilities Authority for
up to $79.4 million.
The hospital is a separate, Stanford-owned subsidiary corporation in which
the University's trustees are also general members of the hospital corporation.
