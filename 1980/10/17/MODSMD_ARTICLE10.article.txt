# Asia rejects American Gls' kids
## 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand-Asia is
crowded with children
searching for their roots —
roots that go back to the United
States, a country they have nev
er seen, where they have fathers
most of them will never know.
The Amer-Asian children of
U.S. servicemen are growing
older, many of them in poverty
and in societies that reject
them. And they are asking who
they are.
"Only in recent years have I
thought about my father. I
would like to know what kind of
person he is. I would like to
know where I came from,'' says

Kim Dae Shik. a 25-year-old Ko
rean fathered by an American.
"I feel like killing the people
who call me names," says
"Tom." a half-American Thai
teen-ager who was rejected for
military service because he
could not name his parents. "I
have applied to settle in Ameri
ca because I think I can find
more warmth there than here."
"I only want to meet my
father and talk with him. I
would like to meet his family if
possible," says Koiichi
Tokashiki, 30, son of an Ameri
can G1 once stationed in
Okinawa.
Mother's nationality taken
Like many mixed-blood chil
dren. Tokashiki does not know
his father's name. He thinks it
may have been something like
Peter. The law allows them to
take the nationality of their
mothers, a law ironically favor
ing those born out of wedlock.
The minority whose fathers
married their mothers before
departing are neither Japanese
nor Americans.
Figures on the number of
mixed-blood children born in
Japan since World War II are
not readily available, but the
Asahi Shimbun newspaper says
3500 live in Okinawa alone.
Prejudice against them in
Japanese society, which em
phasizes racial and cultural
homogeneity, has subsided
since the days when "occupa
tion babies" were shameful

proof that Japan lost the war.
In Korea, an estimated 3000 to
8000 Amer-Asian children have
been born since the Korean War
began. They are denied full
citizenship, barred from the
military and rejected by socie
ty. A bill before the ILS. Con
gress would give the children a
higher priority for visas.
In Thailand, many of the esti
mated 4500 Amer-Asian chil
dren became stateless persons
under a 2-year-old decree deny
ing citizenship to children of for
eign fathers.
A 7-year-old Thai girl recent
ly was ruled an illegal alien, de
nied schooling and threatened
with deportation, said a repre
sentative of the Pearl S. Buck
Foundation, which works with
mixed-race children.
The case is being appealed,
but the foundation official, Rob
ert Hearn, says that if the ruling
stands, the girl will have no
homeland and no place to go.
French example
Hearn suggests the United
States follow the French exam
ple of granting citizenship to a
child born of a French parent.
But in most cases, he admits,
this "would be meaningless"
because the children consider
themselves Thai.
The children "live in Thai
homes, with Thais. They're not
going anywhere. Maybe one in a
thousand would be interested in
becoming an American."
In the Philippines, about

50.000 Amer-Asians, most the
offspring of Filipino mothers
and (_*l fathers, are estimated to
have been born this century.
Their ages range from several
weeks to more than 70 years.
"Luckily in the Philippines,
Amer-Asians are integrated
more easily than in Korea or
Japan." says William McCabe
11. director of the Pearl Buck of
fice there, mainly "because of
the melting pot society."
Although there are no restric
tions on citizenship, schooling
or jobs, many such Filipinos
must deal with the stigma of il
legitimacy.
Reports conflict as to the fate
of thousands of children born to
Vietnamese women and Ameri
can Gls Although there appears
to be no official policy of dis
crimination in Vietnam, many
such children appear os
tracized. and some are denied
schooling.
Recent Western visitors say
scores of children and their
mothers approached them, ask
ing for help to leave Vietnam.
Tokashiki is humble about his
search for his roots.
"I know there are more hap
less persons than me." he says.
"My desire for a reunion with
my father may be a tiny thing.
But I have some types of
anguish common to the mixed
blood in Japan By meeting my
father. I hope that I will be able
to be released from such feel
ings for a while."

Bangkok, Thailand-Asia is
crowded with children
searching for their roots —
roots that go back to the United
States, a country they have nev
er seen, where they have fathers
most of them will never know.
The Amer-Asian children of
U.S. servicemen are growing
older, many of them in poverty
and in societies that reject
them. And they are asking who
they are.
"Only in recent years have I
thought about my father. I
would like to know what kind of
person he is. I would like to
know where I came from,'' says

Kim Dae Shik. a 25-year-old Ko
rean fathered by an American.
"I feel like killing the people
who call me names," says
"Tom." a half-American Thai
teen-ager who was rejected for
military service because he
could not name his parents. "I
have applied to settle in Ameri
ca because I think I can find
more warmth there than here."
"I only want to meet my
father and talk with him. I
would like to meet his family if
possible," says Koiichi
Tokashiki, 30, son of an Ameri
can G1 once stationed in
Okinawa.
Mother's nationality taken
Like many mixed-blood chil
dren. Tokashiki does not know
his father's name. He thinks it
may have been something like
Peter. The law allows them to
take the nationality of their
mothers, a law ironically favor
ing those born out of wedlock.
The minority whose fathers
married their mothers before
departing are neither Japanese
nor Americans.
Figures on the number of
mixed-blood children born in
Japan since World War II are
not readily available, but the
Asahi Shimbun newspaper says
3500 live in Okinawa alone.
Prejudice against them in
Japanese society, which em
phasizes racial and cultural
homogeneity, has subsided
since the days when "occupa
tion babies" were shameful

proof that Japan lost the war.

8000 Amer-Asian children have
been born since the Korean War

gress would give the children a
higher priority for visas.
In Thailand, many of the esti
mated 4500 Amer-Asian chil

A 7-year-old Thai girl recent
ly was ruled an illegal alien, de
nied schooling and threatened
with deportation, said a repre
sentative of the Pearl S. Buck
Foundation, which works with
mixed-race children.
The case is being appealed,
but the foundation official, Rob
ert Hearn, says that if the ruling
stands, the girl will have no
homeland and no place to go.
French example
Hearn suggests the United
States follow the French exam
ple of granting citizenship to a
child born of a French parent.
But in most cases, he admits,
this "would be meaningless"
because the children consider
themselves Thai.
The children "live in Thai
homes, with Thais. They're not
