# Unisexers protest unequal rate scale
## 
### 
New York (AP) — The life
expectancy at birth of a U.S.
female is just over 77 years.
For a man it is just over 69
years. That's eight years by
most calculations, but some
see it as no difference at all.
They assert that to claim a
difference is to discriminate
unfairly. Male and female
are equally human, they say,
and human life expectancy at
birth in the United States is
73 years. They are the uni
sexers.
As you might expect, the
unisex concept is producing
considerable confusion in the
insurance industry, in which
insurance costs and benefits,
and annuities too, are based
on precise actuarial tables.
You might even say ac
tuarial tables, the
mathematical odds, are the
foundation of the business,
and that the business of in
surance is merely that of

spreading the known risks, in
the manner of a casino.
That neat, ostensibly ob
jective arrangement is now
threatened with disarray be
cause, as some actuaries
say, the unisexers refuse to
believe in differences, in
cluding mathematic and ge
netic.
The unisexers won't buy
that. Individuals are individ
uals, not actuarial con
trivances, they say. William
M. Mercer Inc., the nation's
largest employee benefit
consulting firm, puts it this
way:
"A particular woman may
not live longer than a partic
ular man, and our dis
crimination laws have
focused on individuals, not
groups. Therefore, it is
argued that sex differen
tiated mortality tables can
no longer be used to establish
different benefit amounts."
