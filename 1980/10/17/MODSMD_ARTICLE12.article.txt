# Workshop emphasizes methods of dealing with jealousy and envy
## 
### Sally Newman 
Jealousy and envy are so closely in
terwoven that if the phrase "green with
envy" holds true, so must its equivalent,
"green with jealousy." Right?
Not in the least, according to Dr. Douglas
Daher. Counseling and Psychological Ser
vices (CAPS i senior psychologist and direc
tor of Cowell's "structured group" work
shop program. He takes care to emphasize
the difference between the two in his work
shop on methods of coping with jealousy
which will begin Tuesday. And that's only
the beginning.
While envy is a desire to attain a new
goal, jealousy deals with a person's reac
tions to a perceived threat of losing some
thing he already has. Most students who at
tended the workshops conducted at the Uni
versity of Rhode Island by Daher and a col
league'did so when faced with the danger,
real or imagined, of losing an intimate rela
tionship. Problems characteristic of a uni
versity campus, such as the fear of being

academically upstaged by another student,
also attracted a sizable number of people to
the workshop.
The program does not aim to squelch
jealousy entirely, though, since "as long as
human beings need affection, there will be
some jealousy" (according to the psy
chological research team of Clanton &
Smith). Rather, in a sequentially arranged
program, Dahler will present the five
phases which, when understood and ac
cepted, can help students deal with jealous
emotions.
Through group exercises and discussions,
participants learn about the stages after
ascertaining that the problem does exist
and isolating the probable cause. Next
comes identifying and labelling the behav
ioral effects of jealousy, communicating
about inner feelings on the subject with oth
er group members, and accepting the fact
that jealousy is a normal — indeed almost
inevitable — consequence of any rela
tionship.

Finally, students and group leaders to
gether weigh possible methods of handling
each specific instance of jealousy and de
cide on a tentative course of action.
Frequently, people become discouraged
when they recognize symptoms of jealousy,
uncomfortably wondering whether they are
to blame. Daher dismisses that worry, re
iterating that jealousy is neither limited to a
university community (even one with as
much pressure as Stanford) "nor are cer
tain personality types more prone to it than
others."
Because it is so universal, no stigma is at
tached to seeking help at a workshop. "It's
just like taking a mini-course," affirmed
Daher, "but one which presents skills you
might not find in a conventional
classroom." He noted that "you would sign
up for this workshop just as if you'd sign up
for a tennis class if you wanted to learn to
play tennis."
Spanning six sessions, the weekly work
shop will begin Tuesday.
