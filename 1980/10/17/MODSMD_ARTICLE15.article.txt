# Students advised from the top
## 
### Joan O'Connell Dear Mom Dad 
Having a great time at col
lege. I love my classes and I
have this really neat adviser.
You may have heard of him
his name's Don Kennedy
he's also the president.
Maybe their letters home
didn't quite take that form,
but the eight freshmen being
advised by President Donald
Kennedy this year certainly
have something to write
home about.
"I was surprised and feel
very lucky," said Jane
Lubischer. one of eight
freshmen living in Tovon
Hall who were assigned to
Kennedy as advisees.
Lubischer's reaction to being
told she was a Kennedy ad
visee was identical to those
of Jose Bowen. Pat Keeley.
Bill Shadle, Don Nagle.
Laura Kirkpatrick, Greg
Garcia and Vaughn Wil
liams.
All of these students in
dicated on the forms and
questionnaires mailed to
freshmen over the summer
that they had some interest
in the natural sciences.
According to Anne Coxon,
director of the Academic ln

formation Center (AIC), this
interest was the only criteria
used to assign them to Ken
nedy. "There was no special
engineering." Coxon said.
Yet, just as with any mix
of Stanford students, it
seems, the group has a varie
ty of talents and interests
and backgrounds, despite the
lack of prearranging.
Coxon added that Toyon
was also randomly picked as
the residence with which the
president would work.
Kennedy, former chair
man of the Stanford Biology
Dept., has done extensive
academic advising in the nat
ural sciences in the past. In
fact. Kennedy's inaugural
address last Sunday was
highlighted by a rather stern
urging to the faculty that
they should become more in
volved in undergraduates'
lives, an example he is set
ting through his partici
pation in the advising pro
gram.
Kirkpatrick said in listen
ing to the speech, she could
make a connection between
Kennedy's remarks and
some of the thoughts he had
shared with the advising
group.

"He's really looking after
us and encouraging us to tell
him things about ourselves
and any problems that we're
having.'' Kirkpatrick said.
None of the freshmen said
they would ever hesitate to
contact Kennedy for advice
or help. In fact, "he gave us
all of his phone numbers,"
one laughed, "and kept
saying to call him any time
we needed him."
Nagle said although Ken
nedy was unable to have the
students to his home for din
ner. as had most of the other
freshman advisers, he prom
ised that they would be in
vited in the near future. The
week before the inaugura
tion, Kennedy arranged a
lunch in his office with his
wife Jeanne and the stu
dents. After his inaugura
tion. Kennedy invited the ad
vising group to his home for a
reception.
Bowen said he thought
Kennedy's decision to serve
as an adviser was a very good
one. "This way he gets to
know a certain group of peo
ple very well. I think it's a
good way for him to keep in
touch."
