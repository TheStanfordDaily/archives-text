## California's vintage best THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS 
### 
Here it is, another year at
Stanford (or maybe it's your
first) and you're wondering how
best to exploit the resources of
the educational capital of
greater Palo Alto A good an
swer lies, not at Stanford, but 60
miles to the north in the wine
country of Napa and Sonoma
counties and to the south in the
Santa Cruz mountains and the
Santa Ynez Valley.
The best wines in the world
are produced right here in Cali
fornia. but 1 see most students
more worried about this week's
Budweiser vintage than about
last year's Chenin Blanc crop.
It's time to wake up and start
appreciating the fine wines that
this area has to offer You don't
have to be rich, and you don't
have to be a snob
People aren't born with the
ability to differentiate between
varietals (grape types» so you
must educate your taste buds.
The only way to do this is to start
drinking wine! Coors doesn't
make a Chenin Blanc and
Bacardi doesn't make a
Cabernet, but Robert Mondavi
makes both of these wines beau
tifully. All it takes is a little
practice to become a wine con
noisseur
If you would like to take
something to a dinner or a party
besides Gallo but feel over
whelmed by the huge selection
at a place like Beltramo's. here
is a list, by varietal, of some of
the wines I think best represent
their varietal for a reasonable
price. Most cost under $6 00.
Chenin Blanc — a beautiful
white wine for a hot fall after
noon. Serve well chilled.
Burgess Cellars '78 - dry. crisp.
$5.50. Chateau Ste. Michelle 78
— on the fruitv side and mv fa

vorite Chenin. $4 00 Robert
Mondavi '79 — semi-sweet.
$4 75 Parducci Bros — fruity,
crisp, the best Chenin value at
$3.00 a bottle
Johannisberg Riesling —
much like the Chenin, but over
all a little sweeter and fruitier
Serve chilled Trefethen
Vineyard '79 — dry. crisp. $5.25
Firestone Vineyards '79
semi-sweet. $5.00 Jekel
Vineyards '78 — semi-sweet,
$5.25. Robert Mondavi '79 —
slightly sweet, fruity. $6.25.
Chardonnav — watch out be
ginners. this one is the pow
erhouse of the white wines.
Serve chilled Iron Horse

big. high alcohol wine, $7.50.
Jekel Vineyard '78 — slightly
oaky. $7.25. Louis Martini '78

tiful red wine that is actually af
fordable these days. Serve at
room temperature. Montevina
'78 — ample flavor. $5.00.
Boeger '78 — nice berry flavor.
$4 25 Ridge Coast Range 111 '77
— a little on the acidic side.
$5.00. Sutter Home '77 — easily
drinkable now. $5 00
For you people with large
bank accounts tor large NDSL
loans*. I'll list some of the nice
Pinot Noirs and Cabernet
Sauvignons that are somewhat
affordable.
Pinot Noirs — wine growers
in California are getting better
and better with this red wine.
Beaulieu Vineyards. Carneros
bottling '76 — their best wine in
a few years. $7.50. Sterling
Vineyards '76 — intense grape
flavor. $7.50. Joseph Phelps
Vineyards '77 — easy drinking
now. $8.00. Robert Mondavi '77

a good examle of a Pinot
Noir. $7 00
Cabernet Sauvignon — some
of the greatest red wine in the
world is made from this grape
Serve at rom temperature.
Beaulieu Vineyards '76 — good,
sturdy Cabernet drinking now,
$7 00 Boeger Vineyards '78 —
plenty of tannins (from tannic
acid >. $5 50. Sterling Vineyards
76 — intense grape flavors.
$9.00.
These are some of the wines I
have enjoyed over the past few
months. This is by no means a
complete list of good wines and
it is meant as a starting point.
Just for fun. here are my favor
ite extravagantly priced wines.
They usually represent the best
of that varietal, but don't be
fooled by a high price tag. I've
tasted a lot of expensive sour
grapes, and even more inex
pensive good wine. What tastes
best to you is the wine you
should drink.
Chardonnav. Chalone
Vineyards 78. $12.00. ZD
Vineyard. Sonoma Bottling 78.
$10.00. Pinot Noir, Carneros
Creek Winery 77. $12.00. Fire
stone Vineyards Reserve 77,
$15.00. Cabernet Sauvignon,
Heitz Cellars Martha's
Vineyard 75 — God personally
kissed grapes. $50.00.
Heitz Celfars Martha's
Vineyard 75 — only a angel
kissed these. $25.00. Robert
Mondavi Reserve '74. $40.00.
These wines should be bottle
aged for at least six more years
while the other reds I have men
tioned are on the whole suitable
for drinking now.
