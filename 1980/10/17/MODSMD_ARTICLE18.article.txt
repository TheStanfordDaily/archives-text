## Paris protester can never forget 
### 
Saturday, October 4 was a
beautiful autumn day in Paris.
On the bustling Champs-
Elvsees there were no outward
signs of the horror of the pre
vious night when a bomb ex
ploded and killed four people at
a nearby synagogue. Life con
tinued as usual under clear blue
skies on the big avenue.As a
friend and I strolled down the
street, we heard a distant
murmur. The sound grews as
more than 15,000 people

marched, their voices raised in
a collective protest over the at
tack.
A wave of people flowed past
us,as two men dropped their
arms from the chain of people
and called to us to join them. We
hesitated for a moment, uncer
tain of what the consequences
could be for foreigners if there
were trouble with the police.
But the emotion of the demon
strators' appeal was too strong.
We plunged into the crowd and
linked our arms with theirs.
Everywhere within the mass
of people there was con
fusion.Socialist and Communist
groups in the march struck up
chant after chant. 'Giscard!
Bonnet! Accomplices to the
murderers!'
The organizers of the march
who had envisioned a solemn
and dignified protest, could not
quiet them. My friend and I,
completely bewildered, threw
question after question at the
two men.
We learned that the demon
stration had begun three and a
half hours earlier at the syn
agogue which had been attacked
the previous night. The proces
sion would wind down the
Champs-Elysees and terminate
at the Ministry of the Interior. A
woman nearby heard our ac
cents and turned around. 'Ah,
Americans,' she smiled, nod

ding her head in welcome.
I asked the man next to me if
he thought there would be any
trouble. He opened his coat and
flashed a seven inch knife
nestled in the pocket of his
blazer.
'We don't expect any prob
lems but most of the people here
are armed.' he said. And we
have our own security. We are
ready."
We pushed and were pushed
through the streets; shouts of
Make the chain! Make the
chain!' rang out when chaos
seemed imminent. Suddenly we
were forced to stop. People in
front of us were shouting ; pho
tographers and reporters were
crowding around.
'That's Simone Veil, the pres
ident of the European As
sembly," I heard the man with
the knife say. 'He has numbers
on his arm from the concentra
tion camp during WWII. All of
his family was killed. He is
marching with us today."
'Make the chain!" was again
ordered and we began to move
forward. 'What do the Parisians
think of the fascists?' I asked
one of the men.
'They are against them but do
nothing,' he said.
I wondered aloud why there
were no police, anticipating
trouble.
'The police are sleeping,' one

woman told me.
'We encountered metal police
barricades and climbed over
them. We had reached the Min
istry of the Interior. A group of
spectators awaited the arrival
of the demonstrators.
Police suddenly descended
on the crowd, pushing back the
demonstrators who had climbed
a barricade protecting Presi
dent Giscard d'Estang's resi
dence. The police! Fascists!'
the crowd screamed. My friend
and I quickly retreated to the
outer edge.
More confusion! The young
people who had tried to reach
Elysees had angrily surrounded
Simone Veil. A strange tug-of
war followed until police freed
him minutes later.
Veil was greeted with sullen
silence as he appealed to the
crowd. "Don't act like those
whom you are fighting!" he
urged. "Dispense without for
getting!"
The demonstrators reluctant
ly left for the metro and the syn
agogue. My friend and I were
kissed good-bve on the cheeks
by the two men. and we left the
protest with Veil's words still
ringing in the air. We would not
forget!
