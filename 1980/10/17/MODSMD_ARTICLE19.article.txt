Have you forgotten the catharsis of a really sat
isfying argument? Think about it. Have you
stepped back in the face of injustice? Have you to
lerated "I Love Lucv" reruns all these years? Get
up. That's right, get up Wherever you are. stand
up. Clutch the Daily between your fingers and
shout to Hoover Tower. "I'm mad as hell and as
soon as I have time to think about it. I'm not gonna
take it anymore.''
Yes, now's the time. You've idly accepted the
dull, the ridiculous and the inane for far too long.
It's time to consider your karma and your inner
reality: Does your soap leave a pasty film all over
your body?
Are you tired of walking into supermarkets that
promise "everything you want from a store and a
litle bit more" only to find that THE PEN IS
CHAINED to the check-out counter 0
If McDonald's "does it all" with just you and
only you in mind, then how come Big Mac's are
$1.15?
Why do you tolerate your roommate's wet bar
of soap melting in the soap dish every morning o
Do you think Ronald Reagan will establish
Emission Control standards for trees'.'
Does the wine really remember'.' Does Paul
Masson really sell no wine . . . (meaningful nasal
gasp) before its time, or should you let that
Chablis aerate in the glass for five minutes to
double the aging o
Are Twinkies really wholesome and nutritious?
Is Mrs. Olson a manifestation of God? As every
body's next door neighbor, she miraculously ap
pears in a psychotropic vision just to start your
day with a reassuring, "Your coffee tastes like
running shoes, here try mine." Will you have a
second cup or consider euthanasia?
Are vou nauseated by the thought of eggs in the

morning? Every morning, it's fried, scrambled,
or injection molded The last thing you need in the
morning is two yellow eyes staring up at you. Why
not try something more sedate, like cold pizza.
Do you really care if your toilet tissue is 'very
soft,' 'extra soft,' 'Stroft. strong, yet soft,'
squeezablv soft.' or Cushhhhv?' Have you ever
pondered the degenerate psyche of a toilet paper
roll squeezer? >
Would Lee lococca sell his mother to sell you a
"K" car? "And I'll give you six years of free road
service, a fourteen year unlimited warranty, a six
pack of your favorite soft drink, and if you don't
buy a Chrysler, I'll back a Cordoba over Ricardo
Montalban!"
How come when you drop a piece of toast it
always falls jelly-side down 0
Can Congressmen declare Arabian sheiks as de
pendants on their yearly income tax returns?
Why do dog food commercials insist that "Our
brand is so thick and meaty tasting you can cut it
with a fork'.'"
With Lincoln's Birthday sales. Back to School
sales. Summer Sales. End of the Month Sales,
Thank God it's Monday Sales. Just So We'd Get
You Into the Store Sales and THIRD Annual Going
out of Business Sales, would shopping have mean
ing without a sale?
If Billy Carter qualifies as a foreign agent for
Libya, should Ronald McDonald be our Soviet
Ambassador 0
Fear not. the world is not the enemy it seems.
Always remember when you're feeling lonely,
desolate, down-trodden and ignored, there's
always someone out there willing to say: "Do you
mind if I put you on HOLD 0 "
