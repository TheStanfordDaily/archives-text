# Mock election will show early winner in presidential race
## 
### Bradley Crystal 
Although the presidential election
is still some two and a half weeks
away, Stanford students will have a
chance in just 11 days to express
which presidential candidate they
prefer.
A campus-wide mock election in
tended to simulate the electoral col
lege will take place Oct. 28. under the
sponsorship of the ASSU Senate,
Residential Education, and the Stan
ford Committee on Political Educa
tion (SCOPE).
All currently registered under
graduates and graduates will be
eligible to cast ballots. However,
only undergraduates will be counted
in the electoral vote tally. Graduates
will contribute to the overall popular
vote.
The idea for the straw-ballot elec
tion. which has been entitled "Stan
ford Decides 1980" came out of an
R.A. orientation meeting last
month.
According to American Studies
Rouse RA Mark Breier, the mock
election is designed to promote polit
ical discussion within student resi
dences.
"We want to get houses rallied
around the idea of discussing and de
bating. and encourage them to invite
outside speakers," Breier said.
Funding undecided
Stern Hall secretary Bill Offutt,
who helped initiate the project, said
at a meeting of 13 volunteers
Wednesday that logistical and pub
licity expenses could be funded
through the Stern administrative
budget.
Offutt said such costs probably
would not be greater than $70. So far
no funds have been allocatedr
SCOPE director Jeff Menath
yesterday indicated his organization
would help with finances, if neces
sary.
The election will be structured so
that each undergraduate residence
including the fraternities will be al
lotted electoral votes oh a propor
tional basis.
Like the national election, the to
tal electoral votes will add up to 538.
with 270 needed to win.
Each electoral vote will cor
respond to approximately 10 stu
dents, according to Offutt, who
created the electoral approach.
Electoral vote allotments will
range from 3 each for the smaller
Row houses such as Roth and Durand
to 28 for Roble. The largest bloc of
electoral votes will come from off
campus undergraduates with 50.
Ballot format
Although the exact balloting for
mat has not been agreed upon,
project organizers have narrowed it
down to two possiblities.
One option would have the ballot

mimic that of California, which lists
the three major candidates and five
third-party choices. The other would
offer as choices only those can
didates who are on all 50 state
ballots.
In the latter case, only Democrat
ic candidate Jimmy Carter, Re
publican candidate Ronald Reagan,
independent John Anderson and Lib
ertarian Ed Clark would qualify.
Offut said he is hopeful the elec
toral college concept will trigger ac
tive house involvement, the basic
goal of residental education.
"We want to promote the idea that
students have a voice and a ballot to
motivate them to get the electoral
votes out," Offutt said.
At Wednesday's meeting a pro
posal was approved to establish a po
litical information clearinghouse
where interested students can go to
pick up campaign literature.
The clearinghouse is expected to
be set up in the ASSU Senate office in
Tresidder Union weekdays between
1 and 3 p.m., according to Senate
Chair Doug Mitchell.

dents, according to Offutt, who
created the electoral approach.
Electoral vote allotments will
range from 3 each for the smaller
Row houses such as Roth and Durand
to 28 for Roble. The largest bloc of
electoral votes will come from off
campus undergraduates with 50.
Ballot format
Although the exact balloting for
mat has not been agreed upon,
project organizers have narrowed it
down to two possiblities.
One option would have the ballot

mimic that of California, which lists
the three major candidates and five
third-party choices. The other would
offer as choices only those can
didates who are on all 50 state
ballots.
In the latter case, only Democrat
ic candidate Jimmy Carter, Re
publican candidate Ronald Reagan,
independent John Anderson and Lib
ertarian Ed Clark would qualify.
Offut said he is hopeful the elec
toral college concept will trigger ac
tive house involvement, the basic
goal of residental education.
"We want to promote the idea that
students have a voice and a ballot to
motivate them to get the electoral
votes out," Offutt said.
At Wednesday's meeting a pro
posal was approved to establish a po
litical information clearinghouse
where interested students can go to
pick up campaign literature.
The clearinghouse is expected to
be set up in the ASSU Senate office in
Tresidder Union weekdays between
1 and 3 p.m., according to Senate
Chair Doug Mitchell.
