Stanford's As OK
Your article on the C-AAA's
study on grading at Stanford had
me stewing all week. What
world are we in that "Too many
high grade point averages can
be detrimental to a school's rep
utation"?
I would have believed that
higher grade point averages re
flected either greater achieve
ment or a very well selected stu
dent body. Grade inflation can
result from a number of causes
other than professors wielding
blades with duller edges.
The admissions office may be
admitting better students either
because better students are ap
plying or because all college ap
plicants have gotten smarter, or
because teaching methods may
have improved. Grade inflation
is not necesssarily such a dis
mal matter. Even B.F. Skinner
has criticized the habit of
schools to try to prevent too
many of their students from get
ting top grades.
If these grades reflect student
performance changes instead of
lowered standards, then the
number of fair grades will not
not increase using revised grad
ing. but the number of dis
couraged students will.
Perhaps I retain a bit too
much idealism, but 1 would pre
fer to see professors worrying
more about getting grades in
their classes up rather than
down (assuming their grading
standards remain constant).
This, however, is my personal
feeling, and I would not be sur
prised if faculty members from
the School of Education had
some different or better de
veloped opinions on the matter.
What does surprise me is that
(according to Campus Report,
Oct. 1) none of that faculty were
members of the committee.

It's not funny
I must protest the recent
Fieffer strips. Whatever end
they may be leading to, their
woman-hating themes are
hurtful and unnecessary. The
depiction of a husband who
heaps abuse upon his passive,
understanding wife is not funny,
not ironic, not even explainable

in terms of social commentary.
The strips, prima facie, affront
and attack women, and I wonder
if the Daily would run the strips
if the victims of abuse were peo
ple of color.

Right to choose
How dare Dolores Harrison
presume to run my life. How
dare she, when women have
been fighting for centuries for
the right to control their own
bodies, presume to forbid me
the right to control my own.
There may be many good rea
sons not to use tampons but that
decision should be left to each
individual woman to make for
herself. To demand that all tam
pons be banned because you
don't like the risks involved in
using them is chauvinism of the
worst sort.
We are still crawling out of
the shadow of thousands of
years of Big Brotherism. To
substitute the new regime of Big
Sister hardly strikes me as an
improvement.

Not enough books
This fall, I returned to school
with the firmest intent of easing
the numerous academic ten
sions of Stanford life by careful
ly organizing (and minimizing)
my study time. Now, a mere two
weeks into the first quarter. I
am a chapter behind in each of
three classes, simply because
the bookstore cannot provide a
sufficient number of texts at the
right time.
Four books for three classes
just aren't available; for
tunately, my other two classes
had lecture notes compiled and
distributed by the profs, al
though the alternate text for my
CSIO7 class is also sold out. This
situation is perennial and wide
spread. Everybody has had this
irritating problem at one time
or other.
While I realize that small or
ders of esoteric upper-division
texts may result in capital
losses, I feel that organization
on the part of the faculty and the
bookstore management could

work wonders for this problem.
Furthermore. the bookstore can
absorb the temporary losses due
to dust-gathering stock — I. for
one, would sacrifice a 10 percent
rebate at the end of the year if
that would eliminate the hassle
of locating a book to borrow or
spending hours at the library.
The irony of seeing a "com
munity service" bookstore well
stocked with trivial peripherals
such as stereos, mugs, candy
and tennis shoes, while the stu
dents mutter at the empty book
shelves, is simply too much.
And, if you think I've over
played the hassle involved, just
spend two hours each night in
Terman or Meyer — you'll get
the picture.

Cycling code
Is there a bicycle code for
cyclists riding on the Stanford
campus? As one of the minority
of pedestrians. I am aware of
many safety hazards at
tributable to neither the cyclists
nor the pedestrians knowing the
"rules of the road,"
For example, who has the
right of way at intersections, in
crosswalks and on paths used by
both the cyclist and the pedes
trian? Is there any way cyclists
could alert the pedestrian when
they are going to pass them
from behind?
Perhaps the Daily as a public
service could print a set of stan
dard s.
