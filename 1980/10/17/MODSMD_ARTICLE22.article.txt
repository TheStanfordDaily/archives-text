## Candidates differ on government function 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Jimmy Carter
and Ronald Reagan come from
the two sides of the oldest politi
cal argument in America, even
if they are both reluctant to say
so during this presidential cam
paign. They disagree on the
most fundamental issue of
American government just
what should the governmei
Reagan's answer has long
been '' not much,'' though he lias
modified it extensively during
this campaign. The Reagan
canon from the first dozen years
of his political activism (1964 to
1976) is filled with the rhetorical
consequences of his con
servative impulses: "Govern
ment does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sec
tor of the economy." he said in
countless speeches during the
60s. The government, he said,
should stick to its "legitimate
function." which he defined in
the narrowest sense — main

taming the national defense,
preserving a national currency
and the like.

The idea that government
should do as little as possible is
one th;il Jimmy Carter has nev
er uttered He did campaign in
H)7H on a' promise to cut the
number of government agencies
I n in ! .900 to about 200. but that
proposal was meant to increase
efficiency. not to make the gov
ernment more passive.
Though Carter may be less
"liberal" than other Democrat
ic presidents since Roosevelt,
he is no less activist, as the two
new cabinet departments he
created indicate. He has happily
volunteered a governmental
role in many of society's private
sectors, and promises more of
the same it he is re-elected.
The most radical Reagan pro
posals the candidate is still
making call for the transfer of
some federal programs to the
states, particularly welfare. If
put into practice, such transfers
could dramatically alter the
role of the federal government,
but in the campaign Reagan in
sists he only wants to relocate
these programs, not abolish
them.
Appointed officials
Put another way, the dif
ferent attitudes of a President
Reagan and a President Carter
are more likely to appear in
their appointments of sub
ordinates and the aggressive

ness with which they pursue dif
ferent kinds of programs than in
any radically different ap
proach to the structure of gov
ernment itself.
The environment is a vivid ex
ample of an area in which the at
titude of the executive branch
can determine the rigor of fed
eral regulation regardless of ex
isting statutes or agencies. The
* arter administration has taken
an activist position on enforcing
environmental laws, pursuing
alleged violations with a vigor
that was not always required by
the letter of the law, according
to some of the officials involved
in the process.
These are presidentiallv ap
pointed officials, whose policy
decisions largely determine bu
reaucratic behavior. Presiden
tial appointees less interested in
aggressive enforcement could
substantially reduce federal
pressure to diminish pollution,
they concede.
Energy and environment
Reagan has spoken out
against these policies, too. "The
government owns such a vast
amount of the United States."
he said last year, "and has now
closed such a vast amount of
known mineral lands and pos
sible sources of energy and will
not allow exploration or drilling
or leasing for those things. This
should be relaxed."
As that quotation suggests,
environmental questions are
now inextricably bound up with

the energy issue. Here. too. the
two major candidates differ sig
nificantlv. Both favor higher
energy prices and a freer run for
market forces, but Carter
energy policies include a heavy
dose of federal action both to
limit energy consumption and
share the benefits of price de
controls with the federal treas
ury.
1 would get the government
out of the energy industry and
turn it loose in the market
place.' Reagan has said re
peatedly. This is "an energy
rich nation,'' Reagan says,
whose "state of Alaska alone
has more oil than Saudi Arabia
(a contention disputed by many
experts).' Ho disputes the need
for strong conservation meas
ures that the Carter adminis
tration has favored.
Some similarities
In other areas where the
philosophy of the governors can
alter the impact of government,
potential differences between
Reagan and Carter are less
clear. For example. Keagan's
attorney general and assistant
attorney general for the anti
trust division could markedly
alter the environment in which
America's biggest corporations
operate, but candidate Reagan
has not advertised his intentions
in this field. Appointments to
the Federal Trade Commission
could transform that body
newlv aggressive in the Carter
years — into a less stringent

guardian of business behavior.
Many businessmen express the
belief that Reagan will make
changes in these areas consis
tent with his less-government
is better philosophy, but this re
mains to be seen
Reagan used to speak force
tullv against the use of federal
funds to prop up faltering
private enterprises or munici
palities particularly the
Chrysler Corp and New York
City Carter showed no reluc
tance to help them both. But the
Reagan says he now sees
the merit of both those pro
grams, and does not forswear
similar uses of federal power in
a Reagan administration.
Carter has forsworn some
traditional liberal uses of feder
al power in ways that dist
inguish his administration from
some of its predecessors. For
example. Carter has refused to
entertain proposals for gasoline
rationing or allocations, or for
wage and price controls, despite
many Democrats' approval of
both Reagan, too. opposes all
these proposals.
Carter has been a de
regulator. signing legislation
removing most of the federal
controls from the airline, truck
ing and railroad industries. In
his campaigning this fall. Re
agan calls Carter a reluctant de
regulator who only acceded to
Congress wishes in these cases,
but in fact both candidates come
out about the same on the issue.

ferent attitudes of a President
Reagan and a President Carter
are more likely to appear in
their appointments of sub
ordinates and the aggressive

ness with which they pursue dif
ferent kinds of programs than in
any radically different ap
proach to the structure of gov
ernment itself.
The environment is a vivid ex
ample of an area in which the at
titude of the executive branch
can determine the rigor of fed
eral regulation regardless of ex
isting statutes or agencies. The
* arter administration has taken
an activist position on enforcing
environmental laws, pursuing
alleged violations with a vigor
that was not always required by
the letter of the law, according
to some of the officials involved
in the process.
These are presidentiallv ap
pointed officials, whose policy
decisions largely determine bu
reaucratic behavior. Presiden
tial appointees less interested in
aggressive enforcement could
substantially reduce federal
pressure to diminish pollution,
they concede.
Energy and environment
Reagan has spoken out
against these policies, too. "The
government owns such a vast
amount of the United States."
he said last year, "and has now
closed such a vast amount of
known mineral lands and pos
sible sources of energy and will
not allow exploration or drilling
or leasing for those things. This
should be relaxed."
As that quotation suggests,
environmental questions are
now inextricably bound up with

the energy issue. Here. too. the
two major candidates differ sig
nificantlv. Both favor higher
energy prices and a freer run for
market forces, but Carter
energy policies include a heavy
dose of federal action both to
limit energy consumption and
share the benefits of price de
controls with the federal treas
ury.
1 would get the government
out of the energy industry and
turn it loose in the market
place.' Reagan has said re
peatedly. This is "an energy
rich nation,'' Reagan says,
whose "state of Alaska alone
has more oil than Saudi Arabia
(a contention disputed by many
experts).' Ho disputes the need
for strong conservation meas
ures that the Carter adminis
tration has favored.
Some similarities
In other areas where the
philosophy of the governors can
alter the impact of government,
potential differences between
Reagan and Carter are less
clear. For example. Keagan's
attorney general and assistant
attorney general for the anti
trust division could markedly
alter the environment in which
America's biggest corporations
operate, but candidate Reagan
has not advertised his intentions
in this field. Appointments to
the Federal Trade Commission
could transform that body
newlv aggressive in the Carter
years — into a less stringent

guardian of business behavior.
Many businessmen express the
belief that Reagan will make
changes in these areas consis
tent with his less-government
is better philosophy, but this re
mains to be seen
Reagan used to speak force
tullv against the use of federal
funds to prop up faltering
private enterprises or munici
palities particularly the
Chrysler Corp and New York
City Carter showed no reluc
tance to help them both. But the
Reagan says he now sees
the merit of both those pro
grams, and does not forswear
similar uses of federal power in
a Reagan administration.
Carter has forsworn some
traditional liberal uses of feder
al power in ways that dist
inguish his administration from
some of its predecessors. For
example. Carter has refused to
entertain proposals for gasoline
rationing or allocations, or for
wage and price controls, despite
many Democrats' approval of
both Reagan, too. opposes all
these proposals.
Carter has been a de
regulator. signing legislation
removing most of the federal
controls from the airline, truck
ing and railroad industries. In
his campaigning this fall. Re
agan calls Carter a reluctant de
regulator who only acceded to
Congress wishes in these cases,
but in fact both candidates come
out about the same on the issue.

Washington — Jimmy Carter
and Ronald Reagan come from
the two sides of the oldest politi
cal argument in America, even
if they are both reluctant to say

Reagan's answer has long
been '' not much,'' though he lias
modified it extensively during
this campaign. The Reagan
canon from the first dozen years
of his political activism (1964 to
1976) is filled with the rhetorical
consequences of his con
servative impulses: "Govern
ment does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sec
tor of the economy." he said in
countless speeches during the
60s. The government, he said,
should stick to its "legitimate
function." which he defined in
the narrowest sense — main

taming the national defense,
preserving a national currency
and the like.
