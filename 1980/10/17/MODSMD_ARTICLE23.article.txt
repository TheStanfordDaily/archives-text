# Coal sells at any price

Norfolk, Va. — Just after dawn, you cjri
across the gray, oily water and see the misty
silhouettes of the coal ships. They ride high at an
chor, empty.
A vast fleet of coal ships from all over the world
— 122 of them, a modern-day energy armada —
has assembled near the nation's largest coal-load
ing port here and near the second-largest such
port 160 miles to the north on the Chesapeake Bay
at Baltimore.
America is and traditionally has been the
world's largest coal exporter, but nothing like this
has ever been seen here before. The ships are
ravenous for American coal, and their masters
are willing to spend nearly $100 million in waiting
fees — called demurrage — to get their turn at the
coal piers after an average of 35 days swinging at
anchor.
High costs
Still, they stay. In the careful words of France's
official coal buyer. Philippe Julienne, "We diver
sified our supply.'' He means that the American
coal is there, an assured if expensive supply at a
time when there is a war in the Middle East's oil
fields and when coal and dock strikes have just
ended in Australia and Poland, two big coal-ex
porting countries.
"What you're looking at in those ships out there
is the whole transition of the world away from
oil," said Bernhardt Wruble, a top U.S. Energy
Department official and director of its interagen
cy coal export task force, known as ICE.
Worldwide demand for U.S. coal exploded unex
pectedly after crude oil prices doubled in 1979.
Talking to coal company executives, shippers and
coal pier operators here and elsewhere, one can
sense the growing intensity of their energy anxie
ty-
Coal now provides 25 percent of the world's

energy. The U.S.gets 19 percent of its energy from
coal According to the World Coal Study, coal can
provide two-thirds of the energy needed to fuel the
world's economic growth over the next 20 years if
coal production triples and exports expand.
Back in 1947, the United States produced 630
million tons of coal, but by 1961 that production
figure dropped to 402 million tons because oil was
so cheap and readily available. The 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo changed all that, and by 1975 U.S. coal
production was above the 1947 figure.
Everybody knew that demand for U.S. coal
would grow sharply during the 1980:- But nobody
expected this," said Richard Culbreth of the Vir
ginia Port Authoritv. "It's like the whole lid blew
off."
Decrease use of oil
The long-term demand for U.S. coal in the years
ahead will be not only for the metallurgical varie
ty but also for something called "steam" coal,
which is burned in electric power plants. The de
mand for U.S. steam coal has suddenly strength
ened, particularly in Europe, where electric
power companies are converting from oil to coal
willv-nilly in the wake of last year's 100 percent oil
price increase.
President Carter went to Venice last June and
joined the heads of the world's other in
dustrialized countries in pledging to double the
use of coal by 1990. This, they said, is to "break the
existing link between economic growth and con
sumption of oil."
One cornerstone of the government's effort to
promote coal use is called "utility backout legis
lation." This means helping U.S. electric utility
companies switch from oil to other energy
sources, mainly coal. At a cost of $10 billion, this
is expected to save 1 million barrels of oil a day by
1990. The legislation to accomplish this is now
before Congress.
