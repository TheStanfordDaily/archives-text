### Daily wire services 
Westbury. N.Y. — Court documents
tiled hv Dow Chemical Co.. a defendant
in a suit initiated by Vietnam veterans,
show for the first time that the Army
may have known of the potential danger
of dioxin in Agent Orange at least two
> ears before the defoliant was sprayed in
Vietnam.
Dow Chemical filed the documents in
U.S. District Court, where a suit has
been brought by Vietnam veterans
against Dow and four other chemical
firms that manufacture the pesticide.
The veterans say their exposure to diox
in, a highly toxic contaminant, caused a
variety of ills, ranging from tumors to
birth defects and nervous disorders.
Dow Chemical produced a scientific
paper published in 1962 in the Journal of
Invest igative Dermatology that details a
wi ni iut for testing dioxin's potential
for harm bv using the tissues of a live

rabbit's ear. The study, a footnote in
dicates, was financed by the Research
and Development Division, Office of the
Surgeon General, Department of the
Army.
The paper refers to another investiga
tion of dioxin's toxicity to humans first
reported in 1957 in a German scientific
journal, which is also included in court
papers.
Defense contracts
The chemical companies produced the
defoliant under Department of Defense
contracts during the Vietnam War.
About 20<)0 Vietnam veterans from 24
states have joined in the suit. The dispute
has yet to come to trial because of pro
cedural delays.
Both the veterans and the chemical
companies have charged that the De
partment of Defense may have been
aware of the toxic potential of dioxin in
245-T. one of Agent Orange's two

herbicidal components.
But until now, neither side had offered
proof that military authorities may have
been aware of dioxin's potential danger.
' So far there have been mainly allega
tions. said Don Prayer, an officer of
Dow's legal claims division "This is a
fact, the first offered so far. '
In its legal papers. Dow said Tuesday
that the federal government knew as ear
ly as 1962 that dioxin was produced dur
ing the manufacture of 245-T: that dioxin
was toxic, could be detected and could
cause liver damage as well as specific
symptoms such as chloracne. an erup
tion of the skin, loss of appetite and de
bility in animals.
Joan Bernott. an assistant U.S. at
torney handling the Agent Orange case
for the government, said she could not
comment on the allegations and the
documents until she received copies.
