# New Trier students have educational edge
## 
### Washington Post 
Winnetka, 111. — Three years ago, New
Trier East High School here inaugurated
an "office education" course that pro
vided instruction in typing and short
hand.
It was an acknowledged flop. Not
enough students signed up for it, and this
year the course was discontinued
"I guess kids here just don't think of
themselves as future secretaries," said
teacher Louise Weiss.
Such a comment would hardly suprise
midwesterners familiar with New Trier
and the very special community it
serves. As much as 93 percent of the
graduating class each year goes on to
college, and few of them want to become
secretaries. On one recent school day,
representatives of eight colleges were
recruiting at the school. And in 1977, the
head of an accreditation team that eval
uated New Trier wrote in his report . "In
my judgement, no school in America
does a better job of preparing its stu
dents for college."
When college admissions officers are
asked to name America's "good" high
schools, they invariably mention New
Trier. When national magazines write
feature stories about the "lighthouse"
schools - the ones showing the way to
others — New Trier is usually on the list,
along with a handful of high schools such
as Walt Whitman in Bethesda, Md.,
Scarsdale outside New York City and
Shaker Heights near Cleveland.
Yet the qualitites that contribute to
New Trier's reputation for excellence
clearly could not be duplicated easily in
most communities across America. New
Trier's successes confirm what many
educators in this country have always
known: that schools reflect their com
munities, and when the communities are
affluent ones that put a high value on
achievement, success, competition and
education itself, their children do well,
at least by definition of the majority of
families that compose them.
Within the stately homes of Winnetka
and its adjacent suburbs reside heads of
corporations, high-powered Chicago
lawyers and international bankers — the
people who make up what The Wall
Street Journal has called America's
"New Class." Television star Phil
Donahue showed up for his son's gradu
ation at New Trier last year in a Rolls
Royce; insurance magnate W. Clement
Stone can be seen riding local highways

in his gold colored Cadillac. East of
Green Bay Road, clustered along the
shore of Lake Michigan, "old money"
has ensconced itself in mansions sur
rounded by rolling lawns.
A University of Chicago sociologist,
James P. Coleman, has called schools
serving such communities "private
schools financed with public funds." Tax
rates and real estate costs, high enough
to keep all but the affluent and the suc
cessful out. tend to preselect who goes to
New Trier. Black enrollment at New
Trier usually runs between 15 and 20 stu
dents out of 3,150 and there are only one
or two blacks enrolled at the sister
school. New Trier West.
School officials do not entirely agree
with Coleman's definition. "There's a
private school quality to the expectation
for excellence that the community holds
out for us." acknowledges Marilyn
Olander. New Trier East's director of in- *
structional services.
"We can give them something of a col
lege education here," she adds. "When
they come back after college they tell us
often that the work they're doing is
almost laughable considering the
challenge at New Trier."
Stories of precocity abound One stu
dent several years ago scored "5," the
top score, on all seven of the advanced
placement courses he took He entered
the Massachusetts Institute of Technolo
gy straight from New Trier — as a jun
ior.
New Trier, some say. is run with all
the efficiency of a big corportation that
places a high premium on measurable
results. Yet. not even it has escaped the
problems faced by other schools all over
the country. The community was
stunned and disappointed when teachers
walked off the job in the first strike in the
district's history.
In addition to these unaccustomed
woes, school counselors and police of
ficers attest that the youth of the com
munity are as susceptible as kids
elsewhere to negative influences, from
drugs to venereal disease.
Some of its success clearly can be at
tributed to the community's financial re
sources. The school district spends about
$3,500 a year per student, the highest for
any high school in Illinois. The money
pays for an academic, sports and ex
tracurricular program that would make
almost any public school in America en
vious. The school has its own radio and

television station, and offers a course in
advanced Greek Last year some stu
dents traveled to Italy for three weeks to
study the Renaissance.
Yet qualities that are less definable
than money clearly are among the ingre
dients that make New Trier special
"Dissecting the chemistry of the
school and the comunity isn't easy," says
principal Ralph McGee. "It has a lot to
do with the high value that people put on
education."
Four years ago, for example, voters in
the district turned out to overwhelming
ly approve a stiff tax increase to main
tain school programs in the face of infla
tion. This vote came at a time when com
munities across the country were reject
ing new spending for schools.
New Trier puts an emphasis on nurtur
ing its youngsters that few public schools
do. One expression of this is the unique
"adviser program, which adds about
$200,000 a year to costs. Every entering
freshman is assigned to a teacher-ad
viser who stays with the student for the
lull lour years of high school. Advisers
have been dubbed "the third parent,"
and some develop an intimate rapport
with their 30 students, visiting their
homes, monitoring academic progress
and counseling on teenage problems.
New Trier parents have been among the
strongest supporters of the adviser sys
tem.
The other side of New Trier 's "private
school" atmosphere is its intense com
petition.
"If your father is the executive of
some major corporation the only way
you can reach his level is to succeed,
which means you get involved in clubs
and sports," said a male student. "It's
the only way you can become number
one."

Teachers say that the grouping of stu
dents by ability, on a scale of one to four,
sometimes becomes an issue in the com
munity. "Mothers playing bridge don t
like to say their son is in math group two
when they know their partner's kid is in
group four.'' said one school official who
feels that the pressures to achieve high
grades come more from the community
than from the school.
Whether the school prepares young
people for life as well as for college is a
question that has been raised even by the
evaluation team that praised the school
in 1977.
Paul Olnev. a young man with a mopof
red hair who graduated from New Trier
last year, took a different route from
most of his classmates, and is not sorry.
A self-described automobile "freak." he
went to work in the local Volkswagen re
pair shop and says he is thriving. "I had
some advantages that my classmates
lacked." he said wrvly. "Mv parents are
not rich '
Yet for all the image of privilege that
New Trier has. many of its students
seem keenly, if not painfully, aware of
their own good fortune.
' Affluence sets the pace and gives us a
lot of opportunities." said a girl. "But a
lot of people kind of look down on us.
They say 'it's just like New Trier to have
a color yearbook."
Some teachers would like the kids to
stop worrying about themselves and just
accept the fact that they are fortunate
young Americans in a fortunate com
munity.
"A school is meant to serve a com
munity." said Erwin Weingartner,' di
rector of student services. "This school
is right for this community. But it cer

at least by definition of the majority of

secretaries. On one recent school day,
representatives of eight colleges were
recruiting at the school. And in 1977, the
head of an accreditation team that eval

my judgement, no school in America
does a better job of preparing its stu

When college admissions officers are
asked to name America's "good" high
schools, they invariably mention New
Trier. When national magazines write
feature stories about the "lighthouse"
schools - the ones showing the way to
others — New Trier is usually on the list,
along with a handful of high schools such
as Walt Whitman in Bethesda, Md.,
Scarsdale outside New York City and
Shaker Heights near Cleveland.
Yet the qualitites that contribute to
New Trier's reputation for excellence
clearly could not be duplicated easily in
most communities across America. New
Trier's successes confirm what many
educators in this country have always
known: that schools reflect their com
munities, and when the communities are
affluent ones that put a high value on
achievement, success, competition and
education itself, their children do well,
at least by definition of the majority of
families that compose them.
Within the stately homes of Winnetka
and its adjacent suburbs reside heads of
corporations, high-powered Chicago
lawyers and international bankers — the
people who make up what The Wall
Street Journal has called America's
"New Class." Television star Phil
Donahue showed up for his son's gradu
ation at New Trier last year in a Rolls
Royce; insurance magnate W. Clement
Stone can be seen riding local highways

in his gold colored Cadillac. East of
Green Bay Road, clustered along the
shore of Lake Michigan, "old money"
has ensconced itself in mansions sur
rounded by rolling lawns.
A University of Chicago sociologist,
James P. Coleman, has called schools
serving such communities "private
schools financed with public funds." Tax
rates and real estate costs, high enough
to keep all but the affluent and the suc
cessful out. tend to preselect who goes to
New Trier. Black enrollment at New
Trier usually runs between 15 and 20 stu
dents out of 3,150 and there are only one
or two blacks enrolled at the sister
school. New Trier West.
School officials do not entirely agree
with Coleman's definition. "There's a
private school quality to the expectation
for excellence that the community holds
out for us." acknowledges Marilyn
Olander. New Trier East's director of in- *
structional services.
"We can give them something of a col
lege education here," she adds. "When
they come back after college they tell us
often that the work they're doing is
almost laughable considering the
challenge at New Trier."
Stories of precocity abound One stu
dent several years ago scored "5," the
top score, on all seven of the advanced
placement courses he took He entered
the Massachusetts Institute of Technolo

New Trier, some say. is run with all
the efficiency of a big corportation that
places a high premium on measurable
results. Yet. not even it has escaped the
problems faced by other schools all over
the country. The community was
stunned and disappointed when teachers
walked off the job in the first strike in the
district's history.
In addition to these unaccustomed
woes, school counselors and police of
ficers attest that the youth of the com
munity are as susceptible as kids
elsewhere to negative influences, from
drugs to venereal disease.
Some of its success clearly can be at
tributed to the community's financial re
sources. The school district spends about
$3,500 a year per student, the highest for
any high school in Illinois. The money
pays for an academic, sports and ex
tracurricular program that would make
almost any public school in America en
vious. The school has its own radio and

television station, and offers a course in
advanced Greek Last year some stu
dents traveled to Italy for three weeks to
study the Renaissance.
Yet qualities that are less definable
than money clearly are among the ingre
dients that make New Trier special
"Dissecting the chemistry of the
school and the comunity isn't easy," says
principal Ralph McGee. "It has a lot to
do with the high value that people put on
education."
Four years ago, for example, voters in
the district turned out to overwhelming
ly approve a stiff tax increase to main
tain school programs in the face of infla
tion. This vote came at a time when com
munities across the country were reject
ing new spending for schools.
New Trier puts an emphasis on nurtur
ing its youngsters that few public schools
do. One expression of this is the unique
"adviser program, which adds about
$200,000 a year to costs. Every entering
freshman is assigned to a teacher-ad
viser who stays with the student for the
lull lour years of high school. Advisers
have been dubbed "the third parent,"
and some develop an intimate rapport
with their 30 students, visiting their
homes, monitoring academic progress
and counseling on teenage problems.
New Trier parents have been among the
strongest supporters of the adviser sys
tem.
The other side of New Trier 's "private
school" atmosphere is its intense com
petition.
"If your father is the executive of
some major corporation the only way
you can reach his level is to succeed,
which means you get involved in clubs
and sports," said a male student. "It's
the only way you can become number
one."

Teachers say that the grouping of stu
dents by ability, on a scale of one to four,
sometimes becomes an issue in the com
munity. "Mothers playing bridge don t
like to say their son is in math group two
when they know their partner's kid is in
group four.'' said one school official who
feels that the pressures to achieve high
grades come more from the community
than from the school.
Whether the school prepares young
people for life as well as for college is a
question that has been raised even by the
evaluation team that praised the school
in 1977.
Paul Olnev. a young man with a mopof
red hair who graduated from New Trier
last year, took a different route from
most of his classmates, and is not sorry.
A self-described automobile "freak." he
went to work in the local Volkswagen re
pair shop and says he is thriving. "I had
some advantages that my classmates
lacked." he said wrvly. "Mv parents are
not rich '
Yet for all the image of privilege that
New Trier has. many of its students
seem keenly, if not painfully, aware of
their own good fortune.
' Affluence sets the pace and gives us a
lot of opportunities." said a girl. "But a
lot of people kind of look down on us.
They say 'it's just like New Trier to have
a color yearbook."
Some teachers would like the kids to
stop worrying about themselves and just
accept the fact that they are fortunate
young Americans in a fortunate com
munity.
"A school is meant to serve a com
munity." said Erwin Weingartner,' di
rector of student services. "This school
is right for this community. But it cer
tainly wouldn't be right for every com
munitv."
Winnetka, 111. — Three years ago, New
Trier East High School here inaugurated
an "office education" course that pro
vided instruction in typing and short
hand.
It was an acknowledged flop. Not
enough students signed up for it, and this
year the course was discontinued
"I guess kids here just don't think of
themselves as future secretaries," said
teacher Louise Weiss.
Such a comment would hardly suprise
midwesterners familiar with New Trier
and the very special community it
serves. As much as 93 percent of the
graduating class each year goes on to
college, and few of them want to become
secretaries. On one recent school day,
representatives of eight colleges were
recruiting at the school. And in 1977, the
head of an accreditation team that eval
