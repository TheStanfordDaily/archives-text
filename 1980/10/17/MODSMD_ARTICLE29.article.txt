# Washington visits Stanford; Rose Bowl for winner?
## Naber key to halting special teams jinx vs. Huskies 
### Ivan Maisel 
It is only natural Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin would
pick the week the Washington
Huskies return to Stanford Sta
dium to single out Cardinal
punter Ken Naber After all, it
was the Cardinals' disastrous
performance on special teams
here two years ago that gift
wrapped a victory to Washing
ton and gave Naber the job as
starting punter.
In that game in 1978. the Stan
ford defense gave up but six
points, only the Cards lost 34-31.
A tough trick for anyone to pull,
but the culprits were two in
terceptions returned for touch
downs and two blocked punts,
one of which the Huskies took in
for a score and the other which
was recovered on the Stanford 5-
yard line.
Naber took over punting
duties from plodding Brad Fox
after that game and has been
quickly booming them ever
since The Cards have not had
a punt blocked in Naber's two
years of punting.
Therefore, with the Huskies
set for a return performance
against the 20th-ranked Cards
tomorrow at 1.50 p.m. (the
game begins 20 minutes later
than scheduled to accomodate
ABC-TV. which will televise it
regionally) in a game that may
decide the Pacific-10 Con
ference's Rose Bowl team. Wig
gin's quotes take on a tinge of
irony.
"As a player I never ap

predated the punter, but Ken
Naber is a big part of our team,"
Wiggin said "He has kicked off
30 times — 15 of them have been
non-returnable and nine have
been tackled inside the 20 He's
getting enough height on the ball
that our special team can get
down to cover Naber is the best
man we have on defense."
Defense will have to be an im
portant asset for Stanford
tomorrow The Huskies. 4-1 ov
erall and 1-1 in conference play,
are second in the conference in
total offense with 405 2 yards
per game, which is roughly one
yard per game more than Stan
ford has been giving up. Clearly,
the Cards will have all they can
handle tommorow.
"They're a big, strong team."
Wiggin said. "Their people
pride themselves on the fact
that their offensive line can
bench press 400 pounds. They
protect their passer well "
Big, strong offensive lines
have troubled the Card defense
all season, particularly in the
losses to Boston College and
UCLA It wasn't all Freeman
McNeil last week, you know
But Wiggin discounts that as a
special problem. "Look at Okla
homa. Those guys eat hay for
breakfast." the coach said
about the team Stanford upset
three weeks ago.
Nonetheless. Washington is
big in the trenches. Wiggin said
the Huskies' offense has aver
aged five yards a carry on third

and fourth-down short-yardage
plays.
The biggest weapon on Wash
ington's offense is jack-of-all
backs Toussaint Tyler The sen
ior running back began the sea
son at fullback, but injuries and
attrition (Willis Ray Mackev's
transfer to Texas) forced Tvler
to move to tailback
The change of venue failed to
rattle him Tyler has rushed for
446 yards in five games this year
and scored eight touchdowns,
second in the conference to
USC's Marcus Allen
But the Huskies do more than
run well Though not as potent,
their passing offense resembles
Stanford in a lot of ways, ac
cording to Wiggin
"They throw quite a bit,"
Wiggin said "For every five
runs, they've had four passes.
They'll throw on first-and-10."
Usually doing the throwing is
senior quarterback Tom Flick,
who has passed for 854 yards
while completing more than 57
percent of his passes.
Mention the other side of the
Washington line, however, and
one may detect Wiggin going
into his Pavlovian routine. Only
two starters returned from
Washington's defense. Wiggin
said they are fast, big and
green, green.green.
They have a lot of speed in
their cornerbacks. and they're
very physical." the coach said.
"They send five men in a lot on
their pass rush. They're very
strong but not experienced."

Even the experience the
Washington defense has had is
questionable. Anyone who ever
complained about the strength
of Alabama's schedule would go
bonkers over the teams the
Huskies have played
Included in this all-star lineup
have been Air Force. North
western, Oklahoma State and
Oregon State, who have a com
bined record of 1-19-1 The only
respectable team Washington
played has been Oregon, the Or
egon with quarterback Reggie
Ogburn They thrashed the
Huskies 34-10 in Seattle
Nonetheless, with Cal having
taken a supreme nose dive.
Washington and Stanford ap
pear to be the cream of the
Pac-5 crop The boys in
Pasadena will be watching this
one very closely.
Notes — Naber is averaging
41 4 yards per punt, down one
yard from last year's average.
However, only 12 of his 28 kicks
have been returned, and for only
6.6 yards per return.
The coaching staff was hesi
tant to let Darrin Nelson return
punts early in the year, just to
make sure the hamstring that
caused the halfback to miss last
season could withstand a
game's normal pummeling.
Now that it has, Wiggin hinted
Nelson might return punts
tomorrow. "Darrin has in
stincts he can't explain. We just
want to hold a wall of humanity
and let him find some daylight."

said they are fast, big and

The sophomore quarterback is healthy and will
start as usual tomorrow against Washington.
It is only natural Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin would
pick the week the Washington
Huskies return to Stanford Sta
dium to single out Cardinal
punter Ken Naber After all, it
was the Cardinals' disastrous
performance on special teams
here two years ago that gift
wrapped a victory to Washing
ton and gave Naber the job as
starting punter.
In that game in 1978. the Stan
ford defense gave up but six
points, only the Cards lost 34-31.
A tough trick for anyone to pull,
but the culprits were two in
terceptions returned for touch
downs and two blocked punts,
one of which the Huskies took in
for a score and the other which
was recovered on the Stanford 5-
yard line.
Naber took over punting
duties from plodding Brad Fox
after that game and has been
quickly booming them ever
since The Cards have not had
a punt blocked in Naber's two
years of punting.
Therefore, with the Huskies
set for a return performance
against the 20th-ranked Cards
tomorrow at 1.50 p.m. (the
game begins 20 minutes later
than scheduled to accomodate
ABC-TV. which will televise it
regionally) in a game that may
decide the Pacific-10 Con
ference's Rose Bowl team. Wig
