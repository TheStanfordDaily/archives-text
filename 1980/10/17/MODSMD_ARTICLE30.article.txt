# McColl talks turkey about Cards' defense
## SPORTS 
### 
(Editor's note: Week after week, year
after year. Stanford fans have their
hearts and minds mercilessly manipu
lated by the "Cardiac Cards." They
willfully subjugate themselves every
Saturday to the ups and downs of Stan
ford football. Last week's loss to UCLA
was no exception. The Cards took off to a
14-point lead in the first half and
dropped it all in the second to lose by the
same margin.
The defense this season has best rep
resented Stanford's tradition of in
consistency. It played superbly against
Oklahoma three weeks ago only to fall
apart at the seams in the second half last
week.
Milt McColl has lived and died Stan
ford football for the last three years. In
this Friday Interview with Mike Oneal,
the senior outside linebacker discusses
this year's defensive problems and cures
on the eve of Stanford's battle with
Washington--a game which could decide
the Pac-5 representative to the Rose
Bowl.)
Daily: Stanford's defense hasn't fared
very well since it clobbered Oklahoma
three weeks ago. What have you seen as
the major problems?
McColl: As to whether we've played
well or not. we have played well. We had
a great first half against UCLA. In the
second half we didn't play poorly but we
let them get some big runs. It was a re
flection on some poor defense but it was
also that we let a guy break loose and we

didn't quite make the tackles.
I think in general we just have to play
more consistently. Inconsistency was
the biggest problem in the UCLA game.
Daily: Where have the breakdowns
been?
McColl: The main problem has been
the tackling. Freeman McNeil is a big,
hard running back and we didn't get
enough guys on him. One guy would stand
him up. but we needed more guys to
come and help knock him over. One guy
wasn't able to stop him alone. We just
didn't have enough pursuit.
Daily: Was that a mental problem or
u as the team just not ready for McNeil?
McColl: I guess mental is the right
word. It takes a lot of motivation to get
everybody to chase the ball down-espe
cially when you have to come from the
other side of the line. A lot of times, a guy
from the back side will come over and
make the play, but in general, it takes a
concerted effort where all 11 guys are
pursuing the ball on every play.
Daily: Why has Stanford been so par
ticularly vulnerable to the run this year?
McColl: Against San Jose State. I
think part of the reason was that we
made some adjustments in the defense
which opened it up some. But partially, I
don't think we were aggressive enough.
Against UCLA, it really goes back to
the fundamentals of tackling the guy
with the football. It's a matter of con
trolling the line of scrimmage—that's
the key to any game. We did that against

Oklahoma. They couldn't open up for any
big yardage.
Daily: I)o you think Stanford should
have beaten UCLA?
McColl: Sure. Looking at the way we
played in the first half against them,
there's no doubt we could have beaten
them. We had the potential. I believe if
they hadn't had that 72-vard run (bv
McNeil for a third quarter touchdown) it
would have been a totally different ball
game
We didn't get many breaks in the sec
ond half, and we let big runs get to us.
When that happens, they get free things
and quick points. That's really de
moralizing to a defense. To make them
work for it is different.
Daily: What do you do as a team when
the momentum changes like that?
McColl: There's two ways you can
react. You can react by saying. "Hey.
we've got to get together. This is the
time. We can't afford to let this happen
any more." The other one is that you get
a breakdown and the guys don't quite
give out as hard. You get a little bit of re
laxation and you're not able to do any
thing.
At UCLA I think we had the latter of
those two. But it's really hard to say how
you get a team going again.
Daily: Do you think that all the ad
verse press the Stanford defense gets, as
opposed to the praise the offense gets,
has any effect on the team ?
McColl: I don't think it affects the way

the defense plays out there. But for the
offense, having confidence and having
been in tight situations before lets them
know they can do it. They usually do. De
fensively. there are hesitations some
times. But no one seems to notice when
the defense wins the game in the fourth
quarter. They're usually watching the
other team's offense. You just expect the
defense to stop them.
Daily: Is Stanford's defense under
rated?
McColl: I don't think we're under
rated. I just don't think we play up to the
way we could. We're rated poorly be
cause teams score 35 points against us. I
think we have a better defense than that.
We showed it against Oklahoma and half
the game against UCLA. To have a great
team you have to have a good or a great
defense and we have a good or a great de
fense—just not all the time.
Daily: Will tomorrow's game decide
who goes to the Rose Bowl, in your esti
mation?
McColl: Definitely. This is going to be
a very important game if not the most
important game in deciding who goes to
the Rose Bowl this year and the Pac-10
championship. We're not out of the
championship race by any means. One
loss in the Pac-10 doesn't put you out
when the teams are as strong as they are
this year. But for sure, for our own per
sonal pride, we have to get back on the
winning trail this week.

come and help knock him over. One guy
wasn't able to stop him alone. We just
didn't have enough pursuit.
Daily: Was that a mental problem or
u as the team just not ready for McNeil?
McColl: I guess mental is the right
word. It takes a lot of motivation to get
everybody to chase the ball down-espe
cially when you have to come from the
other side of the line. A lot of times, a guy
from the back side will come over and
make the play, but in general, it takes a
concerted effort where all 11 guys are
pursuing the ball on every play.
Daily: Why has Stanford been so par
ticularly vulnerable to the run this year?
McColl: Against San Jose State. I
think part of the reason was that we
made some adjustments in the defense
which opened it up some. But partially, I
don't think we were aggressive enough.
Against UCLA, it really goes back to
the fundamentals of tackling the guy
with the football. It's a matter of con
trolling the line of scrimmage—that's
the key to any game. We did that against

Oklahoma. They couldn't open up for any
big yardage.
Daily: I)o you think Stanford should
have beaten UCLA?
McColl: Sure. Looking at the way we
played in the first half against them,
there's no doubt we could have beaten
them. We had the potential. I believe if
they hadn't had that 72-vard run (bv
McNeil for a third quarter touchdown) it
would have been a totally different ball
game
We didn't get many breaks in the sec
ond half, and we let big runs get to us.
When that happens, they get free things
and quick points. That's really de
moralizing to a defense. To make them
work for it is different.
Daily: What do you do as a team when
the momentum changes like that?
McColl: There's two ways you can
react. You can react by saying. "Hey.
we've got to get together. This is the
time. We can't afford to let this happen
any more." The other one is that you get
a breakdown and the guys don't quite
give out as hard. You get a little bit of re
laxation and you're not able to do any
thing.
At UCLA I think we had the latter of
those two. But it's really hard to say how
you get a team going again.
Daily: Do you think that all the ad
verse press the Stanford defense gets, as
opposed to the praise the offense gets,
has any effect on the team ?
McColl: I don't think it affects the way

the defense plays out there. But for the
offense, having confidence and having
been in tight situations before lets them
know they can do it. They usually do. De
fensively. there are hesitations some
times. But no one seems to notice when
the defense wins the game in the fourth
quarter. They're usually watching the
other team's offense. You just expect the
defense to stop them.
Daily: Is Stanford's defense under
rated?
McColl: I don't think we're under
rated. I just don't think we play up to the
way we could. We're rated poorly be
cause teams score 35 points against us. I
think we have a better defense than that.
We showed it against Oklahoma and half
the game against UCLA. To have a great
team you have to have a good or a great
defense and we have a good or a great de
fense—just not all the time.
Daily: Will tomorrow's game decide
who goes to the Rose Bowl, in your esti
mation?
McColl: Definitely. This is going to be
a very important game if not the most
important game in deciding who goes to
the Rose Bowl this year and the Pac-10
championship. We're not out of the
championship race by any means. One
loss in the Pac-10 doesn't put you out
when the teams are as strong as they are
this year. But for sure, for our own per
sonal pride, we have to get back on the
winning trail this week.

Daily: Stanford's defense hasn't fared
very well since it clobbered Oklahoma
three weeks ago. What have you seen as
the major problems?
McColl: As to whether we've played
well or not. we have played well. We had
a great first half against UCLA. In the
second half we didn't play poorly but we
let them get some big runs. It was a re
flection on some poor defense but it was
also that we let a guy break loose and we

didn't quite make the tackles.
I think in general we just have to play
more consistently. Inconsistency was
the biggest problem in the UCLA game.
Daily: Where have the breakdowns
been?
McColl: The main problem has been
the tackling. Freeman McNeil is a big,
hard running back and we didn't get

come and help knock him over. One guy
wasn't able to stop him alone. We just
