Stanford's women's volleyball team beat California last
night at Maples Pavilion in five games. The Cardinals rallied
from a 1-0 and later a 2-1 deficit in games to beat the Golden
Bears. 11-15, 15-8. 12-15,15-13 and 15-10.
Stanford won the first few points of the opening game, only to
start losing its momentum. The Cards took command of the
second game, however, and led throughout. Some outstanding
plays were made by Chris Anderson, who spiked the game-win
ner.
The third game once again had Stanford taking the early
lead, but the Cards lost their momentum at about 11-11.
At this point the fans became restless, and a section known
as the "' Branner Baker Boosters" began cheering for freshman
Julie Baker.
Stanford and Cal traded points in the fourth game until the
score reached 8-8, when coach Fred Sturm sent in Baker. The
results were immediate — Stanford rallied to win the game.
"Julie added spark to the team," Sturm acknowledged.
Stanford led during most of the last game, but at times the
score was tied, with th£ final deadlock coming at 10-10. How
ever. the Cards kept their composure and won after several
side-outs.
Cal's height gave the Bears the advantage in the early going.
Stanford's leaping ability "is not that great," Sturm said, "but
we make up for that with our special style of play."
Cal put a lot of pressure on Stanford throughout the match
with its blockers, but toward the end, the Cards began to break
through.
"Cal's physical conditioning was not as good as our condi
tioning, and it showed," Sturm said.
