The Stanford water polo team
defeated defending NCAA
Champions UC-Santa ?
7-3 yesterday afternoon
way to the Long Beach Invito
tional Tournament. Jody
Campbell scored three goals in
the game and James Bergeson,
Chris Kelsey, Alan Mouchawar
and Bill Taylor added one
apiece. UCSB will have an op
portunity for revenge however,
when they play Stanford again
in the tournament. Stanford de
feated UCSB once earlier in the
season as well, 12-4, at the Nor-
Cal Invitational tournament
held here.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti expressed some doubt
Wednesday afternoon as to
whether or not his team would
have as easy a time with UCSB
as they had had previously.
"This game kind of worries
me, because we beat them too
easily in the NorCal tour
nament," he said "This time
we will be playing in their home
pool and they should have a big
home crowd. I think they will be
really up for us."

Dettamanti proved to be
right; after yesterday's game
he called Stanford's play "aver
age. We played well enough to
win, but for us it was pretty av
erage. It was one of those games
you just want to get over with."
After taking a 4-1 lead in the
first half. Stanford seemed to let
up in the third quarter. UCSB
scored two goals to Stanford's

one, to make the score 5-3 with a
full quarter left to play. Det
tamanti attributed the letdown
\ ' fact that UCSB had an ad
ge defending the shallow
nu of the pool. "The shallow
er.rl of their pool is abm five
v deep, and I think
ii.ilwas using the boiioui, he
said.
Stanford was finally able to
put the game out of reach when
Chris Kelsev came off the bench
(usually a starter, Kelsev has
suffered from a cold) to score a
goal with less than three
minutes remaining in the fourth
quarter UCSB was unable to
score at all in the whole of the
quarter.
The contest at UCSB was the
start of a very long weekend for
Stanford. The team was on a
plane at seven a m yesterday,
and on a bus for Long Beach
almost immediately after the
game. Today and tomorrow
they will play four of the top
teams in the nation, including
UCSB again.
Eight teams will compete in
the tournament, four from the
Pacific-10 Conference, and four
from the Pacific Coast Athletic
Association. Stanford will play
only the teams from the PCAA:
UCSB. Long Beach State, Pep
perdine. and UC-Irvine. Repre
senting the Pac-10 will be
UCLA. USC, Cal and Stanford
Stanford will have an op
portunity to regain the number
one ranking when they face UC-
Irvine tomorrow afternoon At
their own tournament in the
first week of the season, UC-
Irvine took the top position by
defeating Stanford 11-9.
Dettamanti feels fairlv confi

dent about the tournament
though the road trip will be tir
ing As the individual
scoring against UCSB indicates,
the entire team seems to be con
tributing.
