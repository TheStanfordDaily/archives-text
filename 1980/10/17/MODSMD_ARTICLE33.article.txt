# Huntington stars in win
## 
### Deepak Bangalore 
Stanford's field hockey team
overcame a three-game losing
streak to defeat Sacramento
State 5-1 Wednesday.
The offense came back to life
to put heavy pressure on their
opponents, a definite problem in
the preceding three outings, and
appeared to score at will.
All five goals that the Cards
scored came off freshman
Patsy Huntington, the much
needed addition to the team.
Huntington was assisted by Kel
ly Westerwick. Nancy Jo
Geenen, Kathleen Maloney and
Terri Bovle.

Field hockey

Earlier, the Cards followed a
close-fought loss to No. 1 Long
Beach State with uncoordinated
efforts against both Washington

State and Cal, going down 2-0 on
both occasions. The loss against
Washington State was especial
ly unpalatable considering that
in their previous confrontation,
the Cards had beaten the
Cougars 4-0.
In Sacramento, however, the
Cards got together their ability
to maintain their attack. Con
tinued pressure on Sacramento
State allowed the Card offense
to set up the kind of plays they
wanted to. the scoring ones.
The Cards managed to lace
the ball in front of their oppo
nents' goal, with Huntington
ever present at that spot, and
took every opportunity to score.
Stanford forced 30 corners
and had 49 shots at the goal and
their supremacy in the match
was absolute.
With this win. the Cards' Nor-
Cal Conference record is now

even at 2-2-1 and their season re
cord currently stands at 4-5-1.
Stanford now is in Tucson to
compete in the Arizona Invita
tional today and tomorrow.
They have two matches on both
days, facing Long Beach State
and Colorado State today and
Arizona and BYU tomorrow.
This is a pivotal weekend for
the Cards and will directly af
fect their qualification for the
W AIA W Regional Cham
pionship
Wednesday's big win, in
which everything went right for
the Cards, should prove to be a
morale booster after the slump
which they had fallen into.
At any rate, the team is aware
of the ramifications and seem
determined to play responsible
hockey and keep their cham
pionship hopes alive.
