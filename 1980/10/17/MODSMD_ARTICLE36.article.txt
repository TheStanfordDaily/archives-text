### 
Kansas City (AP) â€” Now it is Rich Gale's turn to try and halt
what is beginning to look like a Philadelphia juggernaut.
Gale gets the assignment of starting the third game of the 1980
World Series tonight against Philadelphia's Dick Ruthven as the
Kansas City Royals desperately seek a way to solve the late-inning
lightning of the Phillies.
And the Royals may have to do it without superstar George Brett
Brett, suffering from hemorrhoids which forced him out of
Wednesday night's game after five innings, went directly to St.
Luke's Hospital to see a proctologist when the team returned home
The Royals have been swamped with homemade recipes for rem
edies to Brett's problem They might be better off. though, with a
remedy for the Phillies
' When you're two down, it's not very good." said Kansas City
Manager Jim Frey. "We plan to do better at home "
They had better if they hope to keep this best-of-seven Series
going They've been burned twice by Philadelphia thunder, surren
dering an early 4-0 lead to lose the opener 7-6. then watching the
Phillies soar from behind again with a four-run eighth inning to take
Game 2 6-4
The Phillies beat Dennis Leonard. Kansas City's 20-game winner,
in the opener, and exploded against bullpen ace Dan Quisenberrv to
take the second game
It is not an encouraging prospect for Gale. 13-9 during the regular
season The Phillies are looking forward to the confrontation.
"He's got a very good fastball, an excellent fastball," said Larry
Bowa. But the scouting report says he might be up with it a little."
Bowa has been in the middle of the Phillie surge He touched off a
five-run third inning with a base hit in the opener and singled home
an important run in Game 2. He also tied a World Series record in
Wednesday night's game by starting three double plays.
He described the change in his team this way: "We're thinking
about the game more and doing the little mental things that you
have to do to win You just can't put on the uniform and go out there
and expect to win. "
Then Bowa added an important observation that is the essence of
baseball "When you're going well." he said, "the double plays are
right at you When you're in a slump, they take a couple of funny
bounces."
The bounces have been going Philadelphia's way. There's no
question about that. But this team, appearing in its first World
Series in 30 years, is starting to feel like it's been tapped on the
shoulder by destiny.
i haven't seen this type of confidence before in my major league
career." said Del Unser. who contributed a vital pinch double
Wednesday night. "The confidence comes from the fact that we are
doing it. have done it and now expect to do it. The important thing is
that now we all expect us to come through when we have to."
And the Phillies keep doing exactly that The team has won five
postseason games now and come from behind to take every one of
them. Sometimes it's early, the way they strafed Leonard in Game
1. Sometimes it's late, the way they took Quisenberrv in Game 2
But eventually, they seem to come back one way or another.
Bowa. observing the situation from the Phillies' side of the field,
had some advice for the Royals.
"They're down two-to-nothing." he said "They'd better get on
the stick."
And if they don't 0
"We have the best road record in the National League." said
Bowa.
