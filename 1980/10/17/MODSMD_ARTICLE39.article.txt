# Hear the mighty Guest Greek oracle
## 
### 
(Editors' note: After years of
inviting representatives of
jockdom and high-level campus
administrators to be our hal
lowed (iuest Creek of the Week,
we decided that it was about
time for our (iuest Creek to be
involved with . Creek. To
day 's prognosticator is Susan
Stephens, who teaches the sub

ject as an assistant professor in
the Classics Dept. In fine Creek
fashion. f*rof Stephens chose 11.
deliver here predictions in cryp
tic, brow-furrowing form, like
the ancient Oracle of Delphi
once did )
I won't say that it's all Greek
to me or that vou should beware

of Greeks bearing gifts. I just
want to remind you that Greek
oracles never lie — if you can
figure out what they say.
I prophesy:
If aahington State over tri»o
nn if things be not what they
seem;
California orer Oregon State

if man be the measure of all
things, the taller team (Cal has
ti-foot-5 quarterback Kich
Campbell i should win;
I S( will defeat Oregon if Tro
jan be not inauspicious as a
name:
Stanford u ill defeat U iinhing
ton, if all that men desire they
should obtain.
