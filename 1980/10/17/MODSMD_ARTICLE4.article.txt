# Surveys show humanities improving
## Humanities Center to combine strengths 
### Mac Funk 
After more than a decade of efforts
to upgrade the study of the humanities
at Stanford, the creation of the Stan
ford Humanities Center, announced
by President Donald Kennedy in his
inaugural speech last Sunday, repre
sents a new effort to bring together
and coordinate Stanford's strengths in
the humanities, according to Ken
nedy.
The center's first director will be
Prof lan Watt, former chairman of
the English Dept. and an interna
tionally acclaimed literary critic and
scholar, Kennedy announced Sunday.
The center was conceived and de
veloped over the last nine months by a
faculty committee headed by Re
ligious Studies Prof. Lee Yearly and is
designed both to strengthen the links
between various Stanford depart
ments and schools ?nd to reach nut tc
the larger scholastic world.
In the last decade. Stanford has
shown marked improvement in its
programs in the humanities, faculty
surveys have shown. Where Stanford
ranked no higher than 15th in faculty
surveys of the humanities in 1925 and
1957, bv 1969 it had moved into national
contention with several departments
in the top half-dozen in their respec
tive fields.
Rise to prominence
According to Kennedy, the upgrad
ing of the humanities program at Stan
ford has been a long, steady process.
We have been gradually building
our strengths in the humanities for the
past decade, at least," Kennedy said.
"We have been making strong ap
pointments in the humanities, and
have made some especially strong ap
pointments recently."
In the past six years, 13 Stanford
faculty in the humanities have won
Guggenheim fellowships. Eleven hu
manities faculty are members of the
American Academy of Arts and - Sci
ences. and four faculty have won the
Pulitzer Prize since 1969.
"In the end, it's the people who real
ly matter," Kennedv declared "The

humanities center is an institutional
invention to bring together the strong
resources we now have, in order to
help people here be more productive
and creative in their research and
teaching."
Other barriers
Kennedy also cited other improve
ments at Stanford that have made this
move feasible In a recent KZSU in
terview. he noted that, until recently,
"Stanford's library resources were
really inadequate to fuel a big set of
gains in the humanities."
"That has been repaired.'' he said.
"The opening of Green Library last
spring signaled once and for all the
end of that period of deficiency. "
Another barrier Stanford has yet to
overcome, said Kennedy, is a sense
that the focal point of studies in arts
;>.nd literature is "a little further east"
'hani'iot.h '( discipline. l :
"We hav a little bit of provinciality
to overcome in attracting some of the
very best people here," Kennedy said.
"It's going to require a special ef
fort."
Slow planning process
In discussing concrete plans for the
center, Watt said although he sees "all
kinds of good things that might be

tried and might work" within the cen
ter. the details "will take an awful
long time to plan."
Watt expressed no discomfort with
that fact. "My own experience con
vinces me . that what individuals or
groups plan to bring about in the way
of fixed objectives is often less re
warding than things which arise more
accidentally on the way.
"We're not dealing with problems
that can be fixed like a leaky radi
ator." Watt stressed. "I would rely on
the idea that anything which brings
people together in serious inquiry is
worth promoting."
The center's faculty, Watt said, will
include a nucleus of five to seven sen
ior fellows, drawn from Stanford fac
ulty. as well as associate fellows and
junior fellows, drawn mainly from the
University's junior faculty and gradu
ate students.
In addition. Watt said, the center
will include a number of senior fellows
"of exceptional distinction, drawn
from outside the University, with
terms varying from a few weeks to ex
tended, and possibly permanent, posi
tions."
Watt said he is encouraged by the in

creasing number of students he en
counters with "well-developed in
tellectual interests outside their ma
jor.
"The academic role of the human
ities is not primarily professional,"
Watt declared. "Education should
give people permanent life interests
and even a basis for understanding
themselves quite apart from whatever
they do for a living."
Noting his students in upper level
literature seminars have come from
fields as diverse as computer science
and biology. Watt observed. "I don't
think there's ever been more of that
kind of genuine interest in literature
at Stanford than we have right now."
Enthusiasm about Watt
Both Kennedy and Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf, who as acting provost
was involved in finding a director for
the renter were highly enthusiastic
about the opportunity to have Watt in
the position.
"Humanities is a collective noun
that is easy to say but not easy to get
everything under," said Kennedy.
"The center needs someone with an
exceptional range of interests, in
fluence. and respect to command the
