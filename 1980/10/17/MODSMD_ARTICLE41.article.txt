Monique's is a family run French restaurant spe
cializing in a relaxed atmosphere and excellent
food. Unlike many French restaurants, there is
nothing stuffy about Monique's.
Dennis. Monique's son (there really is a Monique >
and the superb dessert chef, commented that people
look at the French menu and decor and quickly run
across the street to Ramona's. This is unfortunate
since the cost oi' a lunch at Monique's is similar to a
lunch at the Good Earth, yet Monique's offers a
change of pace from the normal lunch routine.
Monique's is not the place to run and grab a
burger; rather Monique's should be enjoyed with a
slow-paced lunch. The menu offers soups, ranging
from $1 for a cup to $1.95 for an extra large bowl;
salads, including an excellent spinach salad with a
house dressing and a large meal-in-itself salad —
Salad Monique; and an enormous variety of French
hors d'oeuvres.
Main courses include a wide selection of sand
wiches ranging from vegetarian to roast beef to
ham. Yet. ordering a sandwich would be robbing
Monique the chance to display her expertise in
French cuisine.

The crepes we ordered, stuffed with seafood, lit
erally melted in our mouths. They were light, served
warm with a delicious sauce to accent the seafood
filling. And, like all the entrees, the crepes were
served with a green vegetable, a potato (in our case,
a sliced German potato with a cheese sauce) and of
course the French baguette (purchased daily and
served fresh from La Baguette in Stanford Shopping
Center). The food at Monique's is served to look as
good as it tastes.
The crepes are not the only item on the menu
worth bragging about. The omelette we ordered was
fluffy and teeming with sauteed mushrooms in a
creamy sauce.
The restaurant also offers a specialty of the day
lunch which gives Monique an opportunity to display
the epicurean talents she acquired in France from
her mother, grandmother and the famous Cordon
Bleu cooking school.
But alas, just when you thought it was safe to
leave Monique's comfortable and not stuffed, the
waitress wheels the dessert cart by your table. At
this moment your eyes seem to take over your body.
Refusal to try one of the desserts is more than will
power — it is stupidity.
The desserts are prepared fresh daily and our
choice featured a blueberrv-peach tart with

custard, walnut-apple spice cake, strawberry
mousse and a variation of cheese cake (served in a
howl with no crust i with fresh peaches. After trying
one of these goodies, one puts a lot more faith in
one's eyes since the desserts tasted as exquisite as
they looked.
The service at Monique's was friendly, efficient
and. much to their credit, relaxed. The hostess and
the waitress were both extremely helpful and
courteous, yet they were not the only workers in the
dining room. Monique herself carefully made the
rounds, table by table, inquiring about your meal.
Her pride in her 7-month-old establishment was ob
vious. This is the type of human touch and genuine
concern so absent in many restaurants.
Monique's is open for lunches Monday through
Friday. Dinners are only served on Friday nights,
and the menu varies weekly. Our $25 lunch sounds
expensive but included an eight course meal with
wine.
All in all, Monique's offers Stanford students a
change of pace meal, reasonably priced and served
in a family-style atmosphere. And as Monique
herself says. "Relax, unwind — this is the place to
do it."
