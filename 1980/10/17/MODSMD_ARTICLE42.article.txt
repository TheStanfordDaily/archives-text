BETO'S CASA BLANCA

If you're a bored senior looking for
somewhere different to go for Mexican
food, or a newcomer baffled by the sheer
number of area Mexican restaurants,
consider Beto's Casa Blanca. It's easy to
find, located a mile or so past San An
tonio right on El Camino. comfortable,
and offers good, reasonably priced food.
What may be Beto's outstanding fea
ture. however, is its friendliness. In this
era of the mega-chain corporate restau
rant. Casa Blanca survives as a family
run operation. Roberto, the owner, is
there to take part personally in that oper
ation He and his wife and daughter help
serve customers.
Everything is fresh and made to order.
If good ingredients are unavailable one
day. some dishes may not be offered.
You don't have to fear unripe avocados in
your guacamole here.
We visited Beto's on a very busy Fri
day night but were still seated promptly.
They do not take reservations except for
groups of five or more, so you may have
to wait a short time, especially as the
dining room is small. Comfortable high
backed booths, though, provide an un
usual amount of intimacv for such close

quarters, and hand-painted flower deco
rations add another nice touch
Along with the customary complimen
tary tortilla chips and salsa (which is
made with fresh chopped tomatoes, on
ions and peppers and is excellent).
Beto's offers several appetizers.
Guacamole Nachos — a half order
i53.50) is plenty for two — are prepared
on quarter tortilla chips, each individ
ually topped with cheese, beans and
dollops of sour cream and guacamole.
They were marred only slightly
by a sogginess in about half the chips.
Entrees include traditional Mexican
restaurant favorites such as burritos,
tacos and over a dozen enchilada varie
ties. as well as more exotic fare such as
Mole Poblano. Carnitas and
Michichanga. The Michichanga '$4.95)
consisted of a flour tortilla filled with
meat and deep fried, then served on a bed
of lettuce and topped with sour cream
guacamole and cheese. The flavorful fill
ing was real shredded beef, not just ham
burger Rice and beans topped with
melted cheese accompanied the entree.
We also sampled a plump, tasty cheese
enchilada, which was served in a thin
mildly spicy sauce. And our other selec
tion. a chile relleno. was certainly my fa
vorite preparation of this dish to date.
Again there was no skimping on the

cheese filling Instead of being heavily
breaded or crunchv. the pepper had been
dipped in a fluffy omelet-like coating and
fried very lightly. The salsa added a
great finishing touch to these dishes.
Portion sizes were large but not gar
gantuan
Beverages include fruit juices. Coors
on tap. Mexican bottled beer and San
gria. The house Sangria is a cloudy red.
light-tasting drink, and it is highly rec
ommended. A pitcher costs $4 95 and
holds at least a quart of the fruity liq
uid without using ice as a filler. Ice is
brought separately in chilled goblets.
Indeed, prices in general are quite rea
sonable here. Most entrees and two item
combinations hover just under $5. A
small appetite plate, consisting of one
item plus rice and beans, is only $2.95
i51.50 for children). Most items can be
ordered a la carte. For those who like to
do things to excess, the El Gigante
($6 95) offers any four items plus rice
and beans.
To each his own is an apt maxim in
talking about Mexican restaurants, for
tastes do vary widely. But the good food
and people at Beto's Casa Blanca make it
definitely worth a try. It might become
your favorite.
