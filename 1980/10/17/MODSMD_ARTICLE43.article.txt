THE FISH MARKET
3150 El Camino Reao

The Fish Market, one of Palo Alto's most popu
lar dining establishments, basks in the limelight
of its own well-established fame. The casual tone
for the evening is set by the exterior — quite an
eye catcher with a red neon sign shaping the im
age of a fish
The only problem encountered the entire eve
ning was trying to find a parking space in back, no
easy chore due to the crowds Happily the wait
was only 25 minutes which passed quickly as we
absorbed the energy and excitement of the place.
Rather than the typical boring wait for a table,
the Fish Market places a wooden cart right by the
entrance Instead of impatiently waiting, we
purchased "while you wait" shrimp and crab
meat cocktails just like on the wharf. They also
serve well chilled chablis to soothe the passing
time which could last well over an hour during the
peak hours.
One waitress mentioned to me that she thought
the baseball games had made business slow re
cently. but if that was slow. ..

The atmosphere is strictly fun. The noise level
is high, making this a place for party groups rath
er than intimate dining. But an outdoor patio, if
you're willing to wait, provides a romantic
candlelight setting. The tables are plain without
adornment, and the waiters are pleasant though
extremely busy.
The Fish Market menu offers a wide variety of
creatively prepared fresh fish and shellfish. Their
business is seafood, and they know it well; so they
do not try to please the pickv eater who relishes a
meaty overture. The offerings include trout, red
snapper, mahi-mahi. pacific sole, bluefish. crab.

shrimp, salmon and lobster. Variations depend on
both the season and the special "catches of the
day."
We began our meal with a cold Mexican ap
petizer. cevice. which combines pieces of halibut
in a tangy salsa I found it to be a tasty diversion
from the standard fare of crabmeat and shrimp
cocktails.
They also boast "a world's best" Manhattan
clam chowder. But with due respect to my roots, I
couldn't resist a bucket of steamers from Long Is
land They were not quite as tender as they should
be. but one cannot expect this after travelling
across the country They were flavorful and free
from sand A bucket of 20 was one of the most ex
pensive items on the menu at $9 50
The Fish Market also serves a variety of in
teresting salads, a perfect item for warm weather
luncheons We decided to be a bit daring with the
main course and ordered shark steak and Alaskan
King crab.
Shark, like swordfish. is a very meaty type fish
and was prepared flawlessly. They broil it on
hickory wood which gives the fish a fine smokey
tang and it was tender without being underdone. It
was served nicely with a bed of rice surrounding
the two thick shark steaks. The king crab also was
served generously; there were four large legs
served none too decourouslv with a tin of butter
and rice. You knew what you were getting into —
lots of fresh-tasting crab.
The pleased faces surrounding us indicated that
the other entr es were equally good, making it a
matter of mood, not right or wrong choice.
By the time desert rolled around, we were not
hungry, but extremely surprised to find out they
served none. So we had good coffee and tea and
mused about all the potential ice cream parlors in
the neighborhood.
Upon leaving it is difficult to bypass the market
up front which sells beautiful fiiets and shellfish
to take home. But my preparation would be a let
down after smelling the delightful hickory
smoked flavor in the air here. It's a wonderful
feeling to know you've had something good, some
thing fresh, and something you could not have at
home!
Be prepared to have fun, be prepared to wait
and be prepared for lots of fresh fish at a famous
local restaurant which stands up very well
without pretentious cookerv.
