Five h.aty Piece*
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Bob Kafelson's Five Easy
faeces follows an American dream
as it follows an oil-rigger, Jack
Nicholson, in a search for some
thing new. different—better Nich
olson. the black sheep of his upper
class,artistic family, lives with
Rayette. his pregnant, white-trash
girlfriend As Nicholson confronts
his elite background. Rafelson ex
plores the clash between Ameri
can values and American ideals
Kafelson's talent is especially
keen when focused on the details of
personal relationships.
Plays tonight only, with One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.
—Leslie Bixel
The Shining *
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's (too faithful''
Not faithful enough'') adaptation
of the pulpy Stephen King best
seller supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman
in a bathtub) nor hinted-at depths
of charaterization Jack Nicholson
gleefully overplays his role as
madman father to telephathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife-hurtl
ing hysteria by it all is mother
Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness
that a better film might have used
to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to devote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
Plays tomorrow night only.

New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and. aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and Nich
olson's portrayal of a man with a
kooky (because he's too sane?)
fire burning within him power this
most basic and kinetic conflicts.
— Ron Lillejord
The Tenant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski is the master
of unpleasantness. At best his

films become nightmare visions of
a fallen society; more often, as
here, his films become tests of en
durance for an audience The Ten
ant is a torturous way to spend two
hours.
Polanski himself stars in this
tale of a man obsessed by the
memory of a suicide victim The
film is perversely beautiful—as
we wait for the next atrocity, we
can't help but admire the skill with
which Polanski turns the
thumbscrews on his audience. But
the mood of the film is too ugly to
be called entertainment, and its
conception is too weak to be called
art.
Plavs tomorrow night only.

This movie puts its tasteful, icv
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Bedford s
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Button's
searing portrayal ol the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler

Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Button's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

The Elephant Man ****
Park, Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown

and Victor Mature as Doc Bolli
dav Fonda manages the im
pressive feat of creating a charac
terization out of posture. He sur
veys the town balanced on two legs

Clementine of the title in a
roosterish strut-step
Ford was Hollywood's greatest
champion of the American West.

To Catch .4 Thief ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock vacations
with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly
on the Riviera, and To Catch a
Thief is his postcard to all of us
who couldn't come along. It's a

summertime thriller, relying less
i on suspense than on good spirits
| for its impact. Grant plays a re
formed cat burglar forced to pro
tect his good name when another
thief begins to use his methods for
high-class crime. Kelly plays an
heiress whose jewelry collection
makes her a prime target. Ice
beautiful. she seduces Grant over
a picnic lunch of chicken, asking
coolly, "Will you have a leg or a
breast?" Flays through Wednes
day.

In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbingas In
teriors . the structure is as loose as
Bananas The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan , Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline. It's also among the
year's best films.

Frank Capra's Depression clas

Fast-talking, shrewd, and op
timistic. it proved that Americans
could take something like econom
ic disaster right in stride. Capra
always worked to show that, left to
their own devices, people will re
veal themselves as inherently
good, and his movies come close to
making you believe it.
Clark Gable and Claudette Col

of humor intact.

Robert Redford steals a $12 mil
lion racehorse in order to set it

package
The film's sweetness of tone al
lows it to escape being merely
slickly inoffensive. It's evident
that the director and the per
formers are genuinely fond of the
film's characters, and some of this
warmth is captured on-screen.
For a package deal, that's not a
bad trick at all.

Five h.aty Piece*
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Bob Kafelson's Five Easy
faeces follows an American dream
as it follows an oil-rigger, Jack
Nicholson, in a search for some
thing new. different—better Nich
olson. the black sheep of his upper
class,artistic family, lives with
Rayette. his pregnant, white-trash
girlfriend As Nicholson confronts
his elite background. Rafelson ex
plores the clash between Ameri
can values and American ideals
Kafelson's talent is especially
keen when focused on the details of
personal relationships.
Plays tonight only, with One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

The Shining *
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's (too faithful''
Not faithful enough'') adaptation
of the pulpy Stephen King best
seller supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman
in a bathtub) nor hinted-at depths
of charaterization Jack Nicholson
gleefully overplays his role as
madman father to telephathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife-hurtl
ing hysteria by it all is mother
Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness
that a better film might have used
to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to devote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
Plays tomorrow night only.

The Tenant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski is the master
of unpleasantness. At best his

films become nightmare visions of
a fallen society; more often, as
here, his films become tests of en
durance for an audience The Ten
ant is a torturous way to spend two
hours.
Polanski himself stars in this
tale of a man obsessed by the
memory of a suicide victim The
film is perversely beautiful—as
we wait for the next atrocity, we
can't help but admire the skill with
which Polanski turns the
thumbscrews on his audience. But
the mood of the film is too ugly to
be called entertainment, and its
conception is too weak to be called
art.
Plavs tomorrow night only.

This movie puts its tasteful, icv
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Bedford s
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Button's
searing portrayal ol the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler

Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Button's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

The Elephant Man ****
Park, Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown

Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock vacations
with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly
on the Riviera, and To Catch a
Thief is his postcard to all of us
who couldn't come along. It's a

summertime thriller, relying less
i on suspense than on good spirits
| for its impact. Grant plays a re
formed cat burglar forced to pro
tect his good name when another
thief begins to use his methods for
high-class crime. Kelly plays an
heiress whose jewelry collection
makes her a prime target. Ice
beautiful. she seduces Grant over

In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbingas In
teriors . the structure is as loose as
Bananas The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan , Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline. It's also among the

Bob Kafelson's Five Easy

as it follows an oil-rigger, Jack
Nicholson, in a search for some
thing new. different—better Nich
olson. the black sheep of his upper
class,artistic family, lives with
Rayette. his pregnant, white-trash

New Varsity. Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's (too faithful''
Not faithful enough'') adaptation
of the pulpy Stephen King best
seller supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman
in a bathtub) nor hinted-at depths
of charaterization Jack Nicholson
gleefully overplays his role as
madman father to telephathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife-hurtl
ing hysteria by it all is mother
Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness
that a better film might have used
to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to devote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
Plays tomorrow night only.

The Tenant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski is the master
of unpleasantness. At best his

films become nightmare visions of
a fallen society; more often, as
here, his films become tests of en
durance for an audience The Ten
ant is a torturous way to spend two
hours.
Polanski himself stars in this
tale of a man obsessed by the
memory of a suicide victim The
film is perversely beautiful—as
we wait for the next atrocity, we
can't help but admire the skill with
which Polanski turns the
thumbscrews on his audience. But
the mood of the film is too ugly to
be called entertainment, and its
conception is too weak to be called
art.
Plavs tomorrow night only.

This movie puts its tasteful, icv
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Bedford s
style is more suited to Master

his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Button's
searing portrayal ol the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler

The Elephant Man ****
Park, Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown

After the premiere of Manhat

Five h.aty Piece*
New Varsity. Palo Alto
Bob Kafelson's Five Easy
faeces follows an American dream
as it follows an oil-rigger, Jack
Nicholson, in a search for some
thing new. different—better Nich
olson. the black sheep of his upper
class,artistic family, lives with
Rayette. his pregnant, white-trash
girlfriend As Nicholson confronts
his elite background. Rafelson ex
plores the clash between Ameri
can values and American ideals
Kafelson's talent is especially
keen when focused on the details of
personal relationships.
Plays tonight only, with One
Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

The Shining *
New Varsity. Palo Alto
An interesting, infuriating,
bewildering mess of a movie.
Stanley Kubrick's (too faithful''
Not faithful enough'') adaptation
of the pulpy Stephen King best
seller supplies neither the prom
ised shocks (about the best he can
muster is a cackling dead woman
in a bathtub) nor hinted-at depths
of charaterization Jack Nicholson
gleefully overplays his role as
madman father to telephathic son
Barry Lloyd; driven to knife-hurtl
ing hysteria by it all is mother
Shelley Duvall. Duvall gives the
film's most intriguing per
formance — she has a capacity for
pinpointing emotional emptiness
that a better film might have used
to stunning effect.
Three long, painful years in the
making. The Shining is a testa
ment to Kubrick's ability to devote
infinite care fashioning a mon
ument to nothing in particular.
Plays tomorrow night only.

One Flew Over the Cuckoo'n
ISett *★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Ken Kesey may not like it, but
this movie is one of the most con
sistently challenging interpreta
tions of a complex novel ever
filmed Director Milos Forman
goes all the way with the
McMurphy-Nurse Ratched battl
ing and. aided immeasurably by
incredible performances from
both Jack Nicholson and Louise
Fletcher, gets insights that Kesey,
in his novel, didn't come up with
Fletcher's characterization of a
woman consumed by ice and Nich
olson's portrayal of a man with a
kooky (because he's too sane?)
fire burning within him power this
most basic and kinetic conflicts.

The Tenant
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Roman Polanski is the master
of unpleasantness. At best his

films become nightmare visions of
a fallen society; more often, as
here, his films become tests of en
durance for an audience The Ten
ant is a torturous way to spend two
hours.
Polanski himself stars in this
tale of a man obsessed by the
memory of a suicide victim The
film is perversely beautiful—as
we wait for the next atrocity, we
can't help but admire the skill with
which Polanski turns the
thumbscrews on his audience. But
the mood of the film is too ugly to
be called entertainment, and its
conception is too weak to be called
art.
Plavs tomorrow night only.

Fine Arts. Palo Alto
When your future father-in-law
is the undersecretary for public
morality, how do you explain the
six-foot dildo in the living room?
Or the fishnet stockings on the but
ler? Or your mother's beard? ;
A Guess Who's Coming to Din
ner for the '70s, but much funnier
and much less offensive. Ugo
Tagnazzi and Michel Serrault star.
See it soon, before the print falls
apart.

Star Trek **
Fox Theater. Redwood City
Empty. apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of
greed—Paramount Pictures De
spite the seeming grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending—where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves the universe by gleefully
agreeing to some cosmic sex—is
unintentionally hilarious Shatner.
Nimoy and the rest were better on
TV. on the large screen they're
almost unbelievably wooden.
Plays next Sunday and Monday
with Battle Beyond the Stars.

Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icv
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Bedford s
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Button's
searing portrayal ol the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler

Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Button's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

The Elephant Man ****
Park, Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown

My Darling Clementine ★***
Saturday. Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter
John Ford's version of the gun
light at OK Corral features Henrv
Fonda as a very lanky Wvatt Harp
and Victor Mature as Doc Bolli
dav Fonda manages the im
pressive feat of creating a charac
terization out of posture. He sur
veys the town balanced on two legs
of a chair; he dances with the
Clementine of the title in a
roosterish strut-step
Ford was Hollywood's greatest
champion of the American West.

To Catch .4 Thief ★★★★
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Alfred Hitchcock vacations
with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly
on the Riviera, and To Catch a
Thief is his postcard to all of us
who couldn't come along. It's a

summertime thriller, relying less
i on suspense than on good spirits
| for its impact. Grant plays a re
formed cat burglar forced to pro
tect his good name when another
thief begins to use his methods for
high-class crime. Kelly plays an
heiress whose jewelry collection
makes her a prime target. Ice
beautiful. she seduces Grant over
a picnic lunch of chicken, asking
coolly, "Will you have a leg or a
breast?" Flays through Wednes
day.

fc- StarduMt Memorie*
Palo Alto Square
In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbingas In
teriors . the structure is as loose as
Bananas The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan , Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline. It's also among the
year's best films.

The Empire Strike* Back **
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor. Every
thing has become deadly serious—

bigger, brighter, splashier, and
I dull
All the old performers are back,
: but the best performance is given
i by a green-skinned muppet
§. creature that, for an instant, man

It Happened One Sight
Monday. Kresge
Frank Capra's Depression clas
sic reflected a new era in comedy.
Fast-talking, shrewd, and op
timistic. it proved that Americans
could take something like econom
ic disaster right in stride. Capra
always worked to show that, left to
their own devices, people will re
veal themselves as inherently
good, and his movies come close to
making you believe it.
Clark Gable and Claudette Col
bert star as an unlikely pair of lov
ers. Thrown together by a bus ac
cident. they try to get through the
ordeal with their morals and sense
of humor intact.

The Electric llornemnn
Sunday. Mem Aud
Sydney Pollack directed this
ode to populism with an eye
toward pleasing the masses.
Rodeo star-cereal spokesman
Robert Redford steals a $12 mil
lion racehorse in order to set it
free; jaded reporter Jane Fonda
strikes out after the story and ends
up falling in love instead. Willie
Nelson's music completes the
package
The film's sweetness of tone al
lows it to escape being merely
slickly inoffensive. It's evident
that the director and the per
formers are genuinely fond of the
film's characters, and some of this
warmth is captured on-screen.
For a package deal, that's not a
bad trick at all.
