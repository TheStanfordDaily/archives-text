Mount St. Helens blows again
Vancouver. Wash. — Mount St. Helens unleashed a ma
jor eruption last night, spewing steam and ash to 30,000
feet, scientists said.
The 10:05 p m PDT blast sent a plume drifting south
southwest, said Jim Hocutt, spokesman for the state De
partment of Emergency Services.
The eruption came just hours after an urgent warning by
scientists that the mountain could erupt again
The warning was issued when more than a dozen earth
quakes — including one measuring 3.0 on the Richter scale
— shook the mountain earlier yesterday as steam and ash
poured from the volcano.
"If it's going to go. it's going to go in hours...or within a
day," Steve Malone, a seismologist with the University of
Washington had predicted.
The " seismic sequence'' on the southwest Washington
mountain was similar to the events preceding a July 22
eruption, said Craig Weaver of the U.S. Geological Survey.
When the scientists observed what Weaver called "a
real escalation in events," the Federal Emergency Man
agement agency warned law enforcement agencies that
an eruption was "possible within the next 24 hours." said
agency spokeswoman Joyce Routson
An earthquake at 7:02 p.m measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale and was centered just beneath the volcano's
crater. Ms Routson said
Black leader endorses Reagan
Detroit — One of the nation's best known black leaders
gave Ronald Reagan a surprise endorsement Thursday,
while the White House disavowed a claim by another
prominent black, Andrew Young, that Reagan's campaign
rhetoric means "it's going to be all right to kill niggers
when he's president.''
With President Carter and his GOP rival campaigning

their way toward a joint evening appearance at a charity
dinner in New York. White House spokesman Ray Jenkins
said Young's statement last week "does not represent the
president's view "
The Rev. Ralph David Abernathv, like Young a close as
sociate of the late Martin Luther King Jr., offered his en
dorsement at a news conference in Detroit with Reagan
and GOP vice presidential candidate George Bush.
"Poor black people cannot make it under this type of
system, for another six months, and we don't need this
doctor any more, because we as the patient are getting
sicker," he said.
Carter offers to meet Iran envoy
Washington — President Carter and Secretary of State
Edmund S. Muskie offered yesterday to meet Iranian
Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai in an attempt to win
the freedom of the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for
almost a year
Rajai was scheduled to arrive in New York late yester
day night to take part in a U.N. Security Council debate on
the Iran-Iraq war. His unexpected trip immediately trig
gered a spate of rumors about a secret deal that would see
the hostages released in exchange for the American-made
military spare parts Iran needs to continue its fight
against Iraq.
Carter, who was campaigning in the Northeast, told re
porters at the Hartford. Conn., airport: "We have no ar
rangements to meet with Mr. Rajai. But if he were
amenable, we would continue to follow our practice of
meeting with any Iranian official who had the possibility
of speaking authoritatively for their government."
Asked if that meant he personally was willing to see Ra
jai. the president responded. "Yes, myself . .
Anderson does not trust polls
Los Angeles — Independent presidential candidate John
Anderson has plenty of reason to be dispirited, but he
bounded into Los Angeles yesterday as if he was in pursuit
of the prize for sustaining optimism in the face of adversi
ty.'

Despite mounting setbacks to his campaign, Anderson
told reporters, "1 believe firmly that 1 still have a chance
to win election, no matter what the polls show, no matter
what the experts purport to find
There was a certain amount of false bravado inherent in
his remarks, intended to pump up volunteers and keep
some badly needed money flowing into his campaign cof
fers.
"1 never expected that the independent road to the
White House would be smooth." he said in Seattle. ' But I
tell you that we are not discouraged despite things that oc
casionally seem to be adversities."
In Los Angeles, he told a news conference that even
President Jimmy Carter's campaign workers should be
willing to concede that Carter cannot win in California and
thus it is apparent that "1 represent the only alternative in
this state" to a victory by Ronald Reagan.
