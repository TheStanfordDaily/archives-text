# Menlo Park permits proposed for some non-family houses
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
The Menlo Park City Council Tues
day introduced an ordinance requiring
a use permit if more than three un
related persons want to share a single
family dwelling
The present law in Menlo Park flat
ly states that no more than three un
related persons may live together in a
single-farrnlv dwelling. The proposed
ordinance would provide an out for
those in technical violation of the cur
rent law.
The ordinance requires four or
more unrelated persons wishing to
live together to apply for a use permit,
the cost of which will be decided by the
city council.
A hearing before the city planning
commission will decide whether to
grant a conditional use permit, and ap
peals by either side will be taken to the
city council.
Having been introduced Tuesday.

the ordinance now will be discussed
and mav be adopted, amended, or re
jected on Oct 28 at a meeting open to
the public.
Marvin Siegel. acting city attorney,
said. "The ordinance is designed to
maintain some degree of control over
residential property." According to
Siegel. only a few violations of the
present law have been noted in the last
10 years, but he is aware that some
present violations may be unknown to
the city.
Siegel said the city does not go out
looking to enforce the law Rather, vi
olations are usually brought to the
city's attention because of parking
problems. If five people sharing a
house each have a car parked in front,
neighbors sometimes complain.
Menlo Park's occupancy law has
been in effect for many years. The new
interest stemmed from a California

Supreme Court ruling last May.
Santa Barbara had a law similar to
Menlo Park's and attempted to evict
unrelated residents. The court ruled
the law unconstitutional because it
was an arbitrary enforcement
John Savre. chairman of â€¢ Citizens
For Privacy in Housing," said he be
lieves the city is trying to maintain
control of who lives in Menlo Park.
Menlo Park is "using zoning regu
lations to intrude on people's personal
lives." said Sayre.
He said he believes the proposal is a
blatant violation of the freedom of as
sociation provided in the First Amend
ment of the Constitution. He also said
he believes it is social discrimination.
According to Sayre. the Court's rul
ing can be interpreted to state that dis
tinguishing between related and un
related occupants of a house is un
constitutional If this is so. he said, the
proposed ordinance would be un
constitutional as well.
