# Hospital governance to be changed; new directors to have more authority
## 
### David Frank 
Sweeping changes in the gov
ernance structure of Stanford Hospi
tal were adopted Tuesday by the Uni
versity's Board of Trustees.
The changes extend the authority of
the Board of Hospital Directors,
whose previous authority and respon
sibility generally was confined to
medical staff matters and to advising
the University president on planning
budgets, rates and hospital needs.
"The changes define more clearly

the relationship of the hospital to the
University," said Dr. Lawrence
Crowley, vice president for medical
affairs who. under the new rules, also
becomes president of the hospital.
Stanford Hospital is a separate.
University-owned corporation in
which the University trustees also are
general members of the hospital cor
poration.
Greater freedom
President Donald Kennedy said the
changes will maximize the hospital in

dependence "because the patient-care
enterprise is rather special and has a
political future of its own."
Under the amended governing
bylaws, the following changes will go
into effect in January. 1981:
— The board of hospital directors
will have full authority and responsi
bility over the operations and man
agement of the hospital.
— The vice president for medical
affairs also will hold the position of
president of the hospital.
— The hospital board's member
ship will be increased from nine to 15.
and 12 of the directors will be elected
by the general members of the hospi
tal corporation (the University board
of trustees).
— The hospital board will include
two general members and seven other
citizens who are not employees of
Stanford or of the hospital. Three of
the citizens must be Palo Alto resi
dents, and one must be a practicing
community physician
— The presidents of the University
and hospital, the hospital executive di
rector, the University's vice president
for business and finance, the dean of
the school of medicine, and the chair
man of the faculty practice plan will
be elected to serve on the board. The
president of the University generally
will be elected as chairperson of the
hospital board.
Physicians added
The changes mark the first time
since the inception of the hospital that
practicing physicians — both com
munity and faculty — will serve on the
board.
Stanford has a 40-year contract with
the City of Palo Alto for operation of
the hospital, including priorities for
bed access to community physicians
and Palo Alto residents, said Crowley.
"None of the provisions of this con
tract are affected by the new bylaws,"
he said.
Crowley stressed the bylaws of the
medical staff are not affected by the
changes The medical staff is self-gov
erning with respect to the professional
work perlormed in the hospital.
