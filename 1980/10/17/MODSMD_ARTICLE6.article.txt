# Escondido administration tries to make the village into more of a neighborhood
## 
### Gayle Mayers 
"When I arrived here, there wasn't really any
body to show me anything. The office just gave
me the key and that was it."
If this does not sound like something an arriv
ing freshman at Stanford would say, it probably
is not. But that quote sums up the first im
pression of a graduate student who arrived at
Escondido Village a year ago.
Apparently, that first impression is not un
usual. This year, the Escondido Village adminis
tration is stepping in to try and extend a sense of
community to village residents.
According to Jan Marx, director of Escondido
Village and assistant dean of student affairs,
eight out of 22 neighborhoods in Escondido have
been assigned "neighborhood coordinators" this
year.
The coordinators will be similar to RAs in the
undergraduate housing system, Marx said. They
will work to alleviate some of the social problems
Escondido residents have faced in the past.
Marx said the neighborhood coordinators have
been appointed on an experimental basis and the
whole program will be evaluated at the end of the
year. She said a lack of commmunication, partic
ularly among single students, is the main prob
lem to be solved.
Of the approximately 3500 residents living in
the high and low-rise structures in Escondido,
about 50 percent are foreigners, 25 percent are
single and of the married students, about half
have families.
"Generally there is a close community among

the families but it is true that single students do
experience isolation, although less so than if they
were living off-campus," Marx said.
"It may have to do with the nature of their
studies, that they demand everything the student
has," she added.
Marx added if privacy is what students want,
they should be able to have it.
'' Residential education is just providing an op
portunity but it is important that people don't feel
forced into a social situation."
Paul Bandliker. a married graduate student
from Switzerland who has no children, said he
dislikes the isolation. "It is wrong for you to lock
yourself up in your own room and study."
"I think it is really important to meet people
here, but during the last two years I have only
met people in the elevator." Bandliker said.
Bill Cocke, president of the Village Council,
said in general, married students, particularly
those newly married or with families, tend to be
more private.
Therefore, Cocke said, a distinction must be
drawn between the social needs of the married
students and those of the single students.
Atallah Arjomand. a single graduate student
living in a high-rise, commented. "1 have never
tried to communicate with other students be
cause I am very busy outside It may be impor
tant for some people but not for me."
Housing economics have played a large role in
increasing the demand for graduate on-campus
housing in recent years. Marx said in 1975-76 it
was cheaper to live off-carnpus than on.

"Since then, housing costs in the market have
increased at a phenomenal rate," she said. "Off
campus housing costs have increased at about 20
to 30 percent per year but University housing has
increased at about 10 percent per year."
Noting that living off-campus can cost twice as
much as living on. Marx said in the future, the
supply of on-campus graduate housing could be
come a critical factor in determining whether
top graduate students, faculty and staff will be
able to afford to come to Stanford.
Currently there is a six-month waiting list for
married student housing
Marx suggested that as the housing problem
gets worse and the gap between off and on-cam
pus rents widens, the University will have to ex
amine ways of making the allocation of housing
as equitable a possible.
Right now, Marx said, graduate housing is al
located randomly, with a computer assigning a
number to each student.
Not all graduate students -- especially for
eigners -- agree that the advantages of living on
campus outweigh the disadvantages.
Chris Munz, a married graduate student from
Switzerland who moved off campus this year,
commented, "Escondido is convenient to cam
pus but on the other hand I think you live in an
elitist suburb.
"With so many foreign students living in
Escondido, many don't have the time to see the
rest of America and they return home with a lot
of misconceptions about the United States,"
Munz added.

'' Residential education is just providing an op
portunity but it is important that people don't feel
forced into a social situation."
Paul Bandliker. a married graduate student
from Switzerland who has no children, said he
dislikes the isolation. "It is wrong for you to lock
yourself up in your own room and study."
"I think it is really important to meet people
here, but during the last two years I have only
met people in the elevator." Bandliker said.
Bill Cocke, president of the Village Council,
said in general, married students, particularly
those newly married or with families, tend to be
more private.
Therefore, Cocke said, a distinction must be
drawn between the social needs of the married
students and those of the single students.
Atallah Arjomand. a single graduate student
living in a high-rise, commented. "1 have never
tried to communicate with other students be
cause I am very busy outside It may be impor

Housing economics have played a large role in
increasing the demand for graduate on-campus
housing in recent years. Marx said in 1975-76 it
was cheaper to live off-carnpus than on.

"Since then, housing costs in the market have
increased at a phenomenal rate," she said. "Off
campus housing costs have increased at about 20
to 30 percent per year but University housing has
increased at about 10 percent per year."
Noting that living off-campus can cost twice as
much as living on. Marx said in the future, the
supply of on-campus graduate housing could be
come a critical factor in determining whether
top graduate students, faculty and staff will be
able to afford to come to Stanford.
Currently there is a six-month waiting list for
married student housing
Marx suggested that as the housing problem
gets worse and the gap between off and on-cam
pus rents widens, the University will have to ex
amine ways of making the allocation of housing
as equitable a possible.
Right now, Marx said, graduate housing is al
located randomly, with a computer assigning a
number to each student.
Not all graduate students -- especially for
eigners -- agree that the advantages of living on
campus outweigh the disadvantages.
Chris Munz, a married graduate student from
Switzerland who moved off campus this year,
commented, "Escondido is convenient to cam
pus but on the other hand I think you live in an
elitist suburb.
"With so many foreign students living in
Escondido, many don't have the time to see the
rest of America and they return home with a lot
of misconceptions about the United States,"
Munz added.
"When I arrived here, there wasn't really any
body to show me anything. The office just gave
me the key and that was it."
If this does not sound like something an arriv
ing freshman at Stanford would say, it probably
is not. But that quote sums up the first im
pression of a graduate student who arrived at
Escondido Village a year ago.
Apparently, that first impression is not un
usual. This year, the Escondido Village adminis
tration is stepping in to try and extend a sense of
community to village residents.
According to Jan Marx, director of Escondido
Village and assistant dean of student affairs,
eight out of 22 neighborhoods in Escondido have
been assigned "neighborhood coordinators" this
year.
The coordinators will be similar to RAs in the
undergraduate housing system, Marx said. They
will work to alleviate some of the social problems
Escondido residents have faced in the past.
Marx said the neighborhood coordinators have
been appointed on an experimental basis and the
whole program will be evaluated at the end of the
year. She said a lack of commmunication, partic
ularly among single students, is the main prob
lem to be solved.
Of the approximately 3500 residents living in
the high and low-rise structures in Escondido,
about 50 percent are foreigners, 25 percent are
single and of the married students, about half
have families.
"Generally there is a close community among

the families but it is true that single students do
experience isolation, although less so than if they
were living off-campus," Marx said.
"It may have to do with the nature of their
studies, that they demand everything the student
has," she added.
Marx added if privacy is what students want,
they should be able to have it.
