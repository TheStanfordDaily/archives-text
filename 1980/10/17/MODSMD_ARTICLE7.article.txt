## Tension mounting under S. Africa's apartheid rule 
### Washington Post 
Johannesburg. South Africaâ€” Banners in both
English and Afrikaans urged supporters of Prime
Minister Pieter Botha at a recent party congress
to "conquer doubt through faith and courage ."
The bilingual message was a telling sign of the
times.
Despite unprecedented economic prosperity,
unequalled military might in the subcontinent and
a more-than-adequate capacity to quash internal
dissent against its racial policies, the ruling
Afrikaner establishment, after two years of
Botha's premiership, is marked by spreading
doubts about apartheid's viability and morality,
by increasingly open admission that, economical
ly at least, it has failed and by a debate on how it
$hould be changed
The main catalyst for this crisis of faith is one
Afrikaners would rarely admit in public: the
black student insurrection of 1976 that cost more
than 700 lives That experience shocked the rulers
of this racially divided country and focused the at
tention of politicians on facts they previously had
chosen to ignore.
Simple demography was at least one of those.
By the year 2000, South Africa will have at least 35
million blacks and 6.6 million whites. The flow of
blacks to the white-controlled cities that was sup
posed to reverse itself under the racial system set
up in the 1950s was exposed in 1978 as a myth as
blacks continue to flock to the urban areas to find
jobs.
Hostilities continue
In addition, in the past five years three white
minority governments have been toppled in neigh
boring states. That has caused the growing re
alization here that the hostility of black Africa
and the rest of the world will not cease until there
is some kind of black rule in this country.
All these factors had impacted on the
Afrikaner's mentality.
Significantly, the Afrikaner's unease and
doubts have surfaced during a year of economic
prosperity caused by the higher prices of gold. At
the same time. Western governments have re
duced much of their anti-South African rhetoric
and applied little or no real pressures on Pretoria
while internally, there has been chronic but lim
ited black opposition.
Ruling party uncertain
The crisis of faith is most evident in Botha's rul
ing National Party where speeches bv Cabinet
ministers admitted to uncertainty about the
future and offered little but cold comfort. Internal
Affairs Minister Chris Heunis appealed to the
gathering to "trust us."
The disquiet is emerging in other places besides
the National Party. The chief executive officer of

the largest Dutch Reformed Church, whose sup
port for the government's apartheid policy has
made it into the "religious wing of the national
party, resigned last month because of disagree
ment with more conservative officials about their
attitudes on segregation
Plunging down the precipice
In a farewell sermon. Frans O'Brien
Geldenhuvs warned that unless solutions were
soon found, the South African people will be
"plunged down (the) precipice." Following his
example, at least 15 other whites publicly re
signed from the church in protest against its sup
port for "unjust laws."
In August a group of Afrikaner university stu
dents publiclv broke away from the conservative
national student organization, the Afrikaanse
Studentebond. because of its support for the gov
ernment's racial policies.
This disintegration of consensus among
Afrikaners has roused emotions, and those who
question the old views are subject to verbal and
physical abuse from their conservative brethren.
This ferment in their society has led
Afrikaners, isolated from other racial groups
here by more than 30 years of segregationist laws,
to believe there is tremendous change going on in
their country. They are genuinely baffled when
outsiders do not see this.
Decade of experimentation
So far. under Botha's leadership the govern
ment has at least recognized that it has a constitu
tional crisis and has set in motion a search for a
new political establishment, leading some to pre
dict that the 1980s will be a decade of "constitu
tional experimentation'' for South Africa.
As a result, the South African public has been
inundated with a plethora of constitutional
models and newspaper columns are continuously
filled with long, dull essays on "constitutional
concepts."
The model that has aroused most interest so far
is one proposed by Lombard who. in his 1978 book
Freedom, Welfare and Order argues that "the
greatest hope for political stability in South
Africa remains . . . maximum decentralization of
welfare responsibilities and opportunities." Lom
bard wrote in a tract for businessmen.
Lombard proposed the formation of eight re
gions in South Africa, each composed of a black
homeland, a "rural authority" and a metropolitan
area Each regional government, which would
have far greater powers and areas of responsi
bility than local government does now. would de
cide on its own political setup, multiracial if de
sired. and after that, a central government would
be created
