# Karmal Moscow's 'only hope'
## Afghani president travels to Soviet Union

Moscow (AP) â€” Afghan President
Babrak Karmal arrived in Moscow yester
day for his first visit since Soviet troops in
stalled him 10 months ago. Karmal was wel
comed by Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev. Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromvko and other Soviet dignitaries, the
official Tass news agency said
There was speculation that Karmal may
be in trouble with his Kremlin backers be
cause of the continuing stubborn resistance
bv anti-communist Moslem guerrillas op
posed to Karmal's Marxist government.
Some diplomats and Afghan exiles in New
Delhi, India, predicted a partial govern
ment shakeup was in the offing, possibly
with Karmal retaining the presidency but
giving up his second key post, that of prime

minister
There were also predictions that the
Kabul government will receive massive So
viet economic, technical, political and addi
tional military support in an effort to boost
its prestige and counter its isolation, both
internationally and with its own pre
dominantly Moslem population.
Moscow has probably decided that its
only realistic choice is more support for the
regime, a diplomat in New Delhi said. Mili
tary withdrawal could mean a chaotic
bloodbath at the expense of Moscow's Af
ghan backers. Western diplomats said, thus
leaving the Soviets no real choice except to
continue backing Karmal's government or a
similar regime.
Karmal. 51, was installed in the last week

of 1979 in a bloody coup in which his prede
cessor. Hafizullah Amin, was slain. The
coup coincided with the arrival of the first
waves of an estimated 85.000 Soviet troops
and there was speculation it was engineered
in Moscow.
In Afghan eyes, Karmal is regarded as
much less ruthless than Amin.
He has reduced mass arrests, quietly
abandoned such unpopular reforms as land
redistribution and compulsory education
for villagers, and recognized the Afghan
peoples' devotion to Islam.
Nonetheless, he remains unacceptable to
much of the populace, who see him as the
puppet of a foreign military power, the
diplomats and Afghan exiles say.
