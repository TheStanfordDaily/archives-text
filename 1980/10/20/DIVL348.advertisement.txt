Help cure
cancer
write now.
Thanks to your help,
the tide is beginning to
turn.
The past few years have
brought new discoveries in
chemotherapy.
And new diagnostic
techniques that combine
the "eyes" of X-ray
machines with the
"brains" of computers.
And successful new
programs of combination
therapies.
And there are
promising reports coming
in from research
laboratories all over the
world.
We now have
everything we need to save
about half the people who
get cancer.
Please don't quit on us
now.
