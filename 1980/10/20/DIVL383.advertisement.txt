These are exciting, fast-moving times for Sohio. And for talented,
ambitious individuals who will join us.
We occupy a unique position among American oil companies. Our
4 billion barrels of Alaskan crude oil reserves constitute the nation's
largest domestic petroleum reserves. We're the
only major oil company completely indepen
dent of foreign supplies! All of which points to
unusual financial strength and stability—and
growth opportunities.
Annual sales of over $8 billion place us in the
top 40 of Fortune magazine's 500 largest corpo
rations, and we're 18th in total assets.
We have launched aggressive, far-reaching
expansion programs, financed by revenues
from our Alaskan oil. The programs include:
development of new North Slope oil and gas
fields, as well as on-shore and off-shore sites in the lower States.
• Increased R&D in alternate energy resources, including synthetic
fuels.
• Continued participation in the development of our nation's coal
and uranium reserves.
Continued development of oil shale and coal gasification tech
nology.
Participation in the proposed Alaskan natural gas pipeline.
Expansion of our existing strengths in industrial and agricultural
chemicals.
• Immediate opportunities for career growth individuals.
Never before in our company's 110-year history have we been able
to offer so many diverse opportunities.
Our top management is visionary; our salaries and benefits rank
among the best in the industry; and it's our company policy to assist
and encourage employees to advance as rapidly as possible.
We're also proud of our record in areas of equal opportunity, affir
mative action and civic involvement.
