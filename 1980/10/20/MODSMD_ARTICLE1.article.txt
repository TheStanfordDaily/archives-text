# Stanford goes for tie but Huskies get by, 27-24
## Roses wilt along with Cardinal offense in the second half 
### Chris Haft 
The official end came two seconds
before the final gun sounded, when
Washington's Chuck Nelson hit a 25-
yard field goal Many felt the real
finish arrived just over a minute
earlier, when Stanford played for a
safe tie instead of a thrilling victory.
But actually, the Cardinals' 27-24
loss Saturday at Stanford Stadium
featured a prolonged conclusion that
unfolded before either event
Repeated failures to score in the
second half ultimately killed the
Cards. Three times they got the ball
in excellent field position — at their
own 37-, 45- and 43- yard lines — yet
did not advance even to field goal
range. Twice they moved from deep
within their own territory into Wash
ington's, but could not sustain each
drive. In scoring its only second-half
touchdown, Stanford had to move
just 30 yards.
Three of the aborted drives were
marred by penalties, and another
ended on a fumble. Thus, the Cards
had only themselves to blame for
compounding their frustration.
"They didn't stop us, we stopped
ourselves — every time," a dis

gusted John Elway said with em
phasis "I can't think of one instance
where they stopped us."
"When the bullets started flying
and you really need the big play, we
didn't have it. And if anything both
ers me today, that does," Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin said "I
think this team's got character and I
still like our football team, but I'm
disappointed "
Certainly there was a lot to be dis
appointed about. Stanford's Rose
Bowl prospects, for one, have shifted
from bright to bleak. Now 1-2 against
Pacific-10 Conference opponents,
Stanford trails three of the four other
schools eligible for postseason play:
California (2-1), Washington (2-1)
and this Saturday's foe, Washington
State (1-1).
Stanford's remaining hopes rest
on the plausible assumption that the
team going to the Rose Bowl will fin
ish with two conference losses. Even
then, the best the Cards can manage
is a tie — and if it is a tie with Wash
ington, the Huskies would go to the
Rose Bowl by virtue of Saturday's
victory. Washington still has to play
USC, but the Trojans' 7-7 tie with Or

egon proved that they are hardly in
vincible
"We're mathematically still in the
fight, but I guess we can't start
thinking Rose Bowl for a while,
Wiggin admitted "Obviously, this
game puts Washington in a better sit
uation."
Other Cards were more stubborn
"If we can get a couple of breaks and
Washington loses to USC, we're still
right in there. We're not going to roll
over and play dead," Elway said
Defensive tackle Doug Rogers
added, "I don't ever give up. You
don't know what's going to happen
down the road "
Unfortunately for the Cards, they
were unable to see what would hap
pen at the end of Saturday's road —
that is. Nelson's winning kick.
Without Jeane Dixon or some other
omniscient equivalent to guide him.
Wiggin decided to have Ken Naber
attempt a game-tying 26-vard field
goal instead of going for a first down
on fourth-and-two from Washing
ton's 9-yard line with 1:27 left and
Stanford trailing. 24-21.
