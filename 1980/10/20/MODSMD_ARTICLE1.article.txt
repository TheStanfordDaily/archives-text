# Stanford goes for tie but Huskies get by, 27-24
## Roses wilt along with Cardinal offense in the second half 
### Chris Haft 
The official end came two seconds
before the final gun sounded, when
Washington's Chuck Nelson hit a 25-
yard field goal Many felt the real
finish arrived just over a minute
earlier, when Stanford played for a
safe tie instead of a thrilling victory.
But actually, the Cardinals' 27-24
loss Saturday at Stanford Stadium
featured a prolonged conclusion that
unfolded before either event
Repeated failures to score in the
second half ultimately killed the
Cards. Three times they got the ball
in excellent field position — at their
own 37-, 45- and 43- yard lines — yet
did not advance even to field goal
range. Twice they moved from deep
within their own territory into Wash
ington's, but could not sustain each
drive. In scoring its only second-half
touchdown, Stanford had to move
just 30 yards.
Three of the aborted drives were
marred by penalties, and another
ended on a fumble. Thus, the Cards
had only themselves to blame for
compounding their frustration.
"They didn't stop us, we stopped
ourselves — every time," a dis

gusted John Elway said with em
phasis "I can't think of one instance
where they stopped us."
"When the bullets started flying
and you really need the big play, we
didn't have it. And if anything both
ers me today, that does," Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin said "I
think this team's got character and I
still like our football team, but I'm
disappointed "
Certainly there was a lot to be dis
appointed about. Stanford's Rose
Bowl prospects, for one, have shifted
from bright to bleak. Now 1-2 against
Pacific-10 Conference opponents,
Stanford trails three of the four other
schools eligible for postseason play:
California (2-1), Washington (2-1)
and this Saturday's foe, Washington
State (1-1).
Stanford's remaining hopes rest
on the plausible assumption that the
team going to the Rose Bowl will fin
ish with two conference losses. Even
then, the best the Cards can manage
is a tie — and if it is a tie with Wash
ington, the Huskies would go to the
Rose Bowl by virtue of Saturday's
victory. Washington still has to play
USC, but the Trojans' 7-7 tie with Or

egon proved that they are hardly in
vincible
"We're mathematically still in the
fight, but I guess we can't start
thinking Rose Bowl for a while,
Wiggin admitted "Obviously, this
game puts Washington in a better sit
uation."
Other Cards were more stubborn
"If we can get a couple of breaks and
Washington loses to USC, we're still
right in there. We're not going to roll
over and play dead," Elway said
Defensive tackle Doug Rogers
added, "I don't ever give up. You
don't know what's going to happen
down the road "
Unfortunately for the Cards, they
were unable to see what would hap
pen at the end of Saturday's road —
that is. Nelson's winning kick.
Without Jeane Dixon or some other
omniscient equivalent to guide him.
Wiggin decided to have Ken Naber
attempt a game-tying 26-vard field
goal instead of going for a first down
on fourth-and-two from Washing
ton's 9-yard line with 1:27 left and
Stanford trailing. 24-21.

Wiggin defended his strategy
by citing the Rose Bowl selec
tion procedure, which essential
ly treats ties as if they didn't
even occur The coach revealed
that he and his staff had chosen
the week before the game to
a field goal in such a situ
.<iOii "For the benefit of the
skeptics, I thought it w . . hell
of a decision," Wiggir de

Washington head coach Don
James agreed with Wiggin. "I
would have gone for a tie if I
were in Stanford's position. It
keeps you in the race. A con
ference loss kills you," he said
"Of course I wanted us to go
for it, just like all of the offense
did," Elway said. "But what
ever Coach Wiggin decides. I'm
going to back him 100 percent.
He knows the right call to
make."
The drive had begun with
Elway's clutch 18-yard strike to
Andre Tyler on third down It
continued with one of the sea
son's most remarkable plays:
scrambling to his right, Elway

stopped and quickly threw
across the field, on a long,
diagonal line, to Vincent White
White grabbed the ball for a 34-
vard gain despite being draped
by cornerback Bill Stapleton.
Stapleton. incidentally, pre
vented a touchdown four plays
later by knocking away another
pass for White in the end zone
Stapleton's deflection only
begun Washington's late-game
heroics. Aptly-named quarter
back Tom Flick, who completed
21 of 33 passes for 278 yards, hit
six out of seven on the Huskies
last drive.
A 21-yarder to Aaron Wil
liams. a 9-yarder to David Bavle
on third-and-seven and a 24-
varder to Ron Blacken at the
edge of the sideline were the
crucial plays that set up
Nelson's winning kick "They
were just your basic cross
routes where you can run guys
in and out of the zone (de
fense)," Flick said of the final
plays.
Earlier, the Huskies had built
a 24-7 lead on Flick's touchdown
passes of 41 and 28 yards to Wil

hams, Kyle Stevens 2-yard
scoring run and Nelson's 35-
vard field goal. Converting their
first six third-downs into first
downs and finding the Card sec
ondary relatively unchalleng
ing. the Huskies rolled up 269
yards in the first half
"In lead of going in with our
sleeves rolled up. we went in
with a blind man's attitude."
Rogers said. "It took us a whole
half to find out they were a good
offensive team."
After intermission, the Card
defenders went from stale to
staunch, halting Washington on
every possession except the
winning drive. This improve
ment. however, only magnified
Stanford's inconsistency
"That's what's disappointing
about the defense — we have to
play every half like the second
half today and th° first half
against UCLA." R ners said
While its defense stiffened.
Stanford's offense only occa
sionally loosened up. After scor
ing the Cards' first touchdown
on a well-executed 2-vard

bootleg run. Elway found Dar
rin Nelson zipping down the
sideline and hit him with a 42-
vard TD bomb The exciting
halfback, who gained 109 yards
in 17 carries grabbed four
passes for 56 yards, used all of
his tremendous speed to make
the catch
White tallied Stanford's final
touchdown on a 13-vard pass
play, taking Elway's short toss
near the line of scrimmage and
spinning away from a would-be
tackier at the 5.
The only other spinning that
went on was Stanford spinning
its collective wheels.
NOTES: Nelson and Ken
Margerum. who also caught
four passes for sti vards, vaulted
into second place on Stanford's
all-time receiving list with 125
catches, surpassing Gene Wash
ington (122). They are both
within reach of all-time leader
Tony Hill (140) . Margerum
also now has 2222 career receiv
ing yards, only 3 behind all-time
leader Hill's 2225 .

finish arrived just over a minute
earlier, when Stanford played for a
safe tie instead of a thrilling victory.
But actually, the Cardinals' 27-24
loss Saturday at Stanford Stadium
featured a prolonged conclusion that
unfolded before either event
Repeated failures to score in the
second half ultimately killed the
Cards. Three times they got the ball
in excellent field position — at their
own 37-, 45- and 43- yard lines — yet
did not advance even to field goal
range. Twice they moved from deep
within their own territory into Wash
ington's, but could not sustain each
drive. In scoring its only second-half
touchdown, Stanford had to move
just 30 yards.
Three of the aborted drives were
marred by penalties, and another
ended on a fumble. Thus, the Cards
had only themselves to blame for
compounding their frustration.
"They didn't stop us, we stopped
ourselves — every time," a dis

gusted John Elway said with em
phasis "I can't think of one instance
where they stopped us."
"When the bullets started flying

didn't have it. And if anything both

head coach Paul Wiggin said "I

disappointed "
Certainly there was a lot to be dis
appointed about. Stanford's Rose
Bowl prospects, for one, have shifted
from bright to bleak. Now 1-2 against
Pacific-10 Conference opponents,
Stanford trails three of the four other
schools eligible for postseason play:
California (2-1), Washington (2-1)
and this Saturday's foe, Washington
State (1-1).
Stanford's remaining hopes rest
on the plausible assumption that the
team going to the Rose Bowl will fin
ish with two conference losses. Even
then, the best the Cards can manage
is a tie — and if it is a tie with Wash
ington, the Huskies would go to the
Rose Bowl by virtue of Saturday's
victory. Washington still has to play
USC, but the Trojans' 7-7 tie with Or

egon proved that they are hardly in

"We're mathematically still in the

"If we can get a couple of breaks and

into second place on Stanford's
all-time receiving list with 125
catches, surpassing Gene Wash

within reach of all-time leader

The official end came two seconds
before the final gun sounded, when
Washington's Chuck Nelson hit a 25-
yard field goal Many felt the real
finish arrived just over a minute
earlier, when Stanford played for a
safe tie instead of a thrilling victory.
But actually, the Cardinals' 27-24
loss Saturday at Stanford Stadium
featured a prolonged conclusion that
unfolded before either event
Repeated failures to score in the
second half ultimately killed the
Cards. Three times they got the ball
in excellent field position — at their
own 37-, 45- and 43- yard lines — yet
did not advance even to field goal
range. Twice they moved from deep
within their own territory into Wash
ington's, but could not sustain each
drive. In scoring its only second-half
touchdown, Stanford had to move
just 30 yards.
Three of the aborted drives were
marred by penalties, and another
ended on a fumble. Thus, the Cards
had only themselves to blame for
compounding their frustration.
"They didn't stop us, we stopped
ourselves — every time," a dis

gusted John Elway said with em
phasis "I can't think of one instance
where they stopped us."
"When the bullets started flying
and you really need the big play, we
didn't have it. And if anything both
ers me today, that does," Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin said "I
think this team's got character and I
still like our football team, but I'm
disappointed "
Certainly there was a lot to be dis
appointed about. Stanford's Rose
Bowl prospects, for one, have shifted
from bright to bleak. Now 1-2 against
Pacific-10 Conference opponents,
Stanford trails three of the four other
schools eligible for postseason play:
California (2-1), Washington (2-1)
and this Saturday's foe, Washington
State (1-1).
Stanford's remaining hopes rest
on the plausible assumption that the
team going to the Rose Bowl will fin
ish with two conference losses. Even
then, the best the Cards can manage
is a tie — and if it is a tie with Wash
ington, the Huskies would go to the
Rose Bowl by virtue of Saturday's
victory. Washington still has to play
USC, but the Trojans' 7-7 tie with Or

egon proved that they are hardly in
vincible
"We're mathematically still in the
fight, but I guess we can't start
thinking Rose Bowl for a while,
Wiggin admitted "Obviously, this
game puts Washington in a better sit
uation."
Other Cards were more stubborn
"If we can get a couple of breaks and
Washington loses to USC, we're still
right in there. We're not going to roll
over and play dead," Elway said
Defensive tackle Doug Rogers
added, "I don't ever give up. You
don't know what's going to happen
down the road "
Unfortunately for the Cards, they
were unable to see what would hap
pen at the end of Saturday's road —
that is. Nelson's winning kick.
Without Jeane Dixon or some other
omniscient equivalent to guide him.
Wiggin decided to have Ken Naber
attempt a game-tying 26-vard field
goal instead of going for a first down
on fourth-and-two from Washing
ton's 9-yard line with 1:27 left and
Stanford trailing. 24-21.

Wiggin defended his strategy
by citing the Rose Bowl selec
tion procedure, which essential
ly treats ties as if they didn't
even occur The coach revealed
that he and his staff had chosen
the week before the game to
a field goal in such a situ
.<iOii "For the benefit of the
skeptics, I thought it w . . hell
of a decision," Wiggir de

Washington head coach Don
James agreed with Wiggin. "I
would have gone for a tie if I
were in Stanford's position. It
keeps you in the race. A con
ference loss kills you," he said
"Of course I wanted us to go
for it, just like all of the offense
did," Elway said. "But what
ever Coach Wiggin decides. I'm
going to back him 100 percent.
He knows the right call to
make."
The drive had begun with
Elway's clutch 18-yard strike to
Andre Tyler on third down It
continued with one of the sea
son's most remarkable plays:
scrambling to his right, Elway

stopped and quickly threw
across the field, on a long,
diagonal line, to Vincent White
White grabbed the ball for a 34-
vard gain despite being draped
by cornerback Bill Stapleton.
Stapleton. incidentally, pre
vented a touchdown four plays
later by knocking away another
pass for White in the end zone
Stapleton's deflection only
begun Washington's late-game
heroics. Aptly-named quarter
back Tom Flick, who completed
21 of 33 passes for 278 yards, hit
six out of seven on the Huskies
last drive.
A 21-yarder to Aaron Wil
liams. a 9-yarder to David Bavle
on third-and-seven and a 24-
varder to Ron Blacken at the
edge of the sideline were the
crucial plays that set up
Nelson's winning kick "They
were just your basic cross
routes where you can run guys
in and out of the zone (de
fense)," Flick said of the final
plays.
Earlier, the Huskies had built
a 24-7 lead on Flick's touchdown
passes of 41 and 28 yards to Wil

hams, Kyle Stevens 2-yard
scoring run and Nelson's 35-
