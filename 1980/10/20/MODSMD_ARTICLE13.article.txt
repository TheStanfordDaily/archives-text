## Democracy at Stanford?

Who runs Stanford?

How would you like it if you helped elect a rep
resentative — and the victorious candidate wasn't
permitted to take office for a couple of years 0
How would you like it if you exercise your
rights as a citizen — and were docked pay as a re
sult 9
How would you like it if. as a condition of em
ployment. you were forced to live in the boss's
house, and furthermore were forced to eat the
food that the boss cooked, in a menu the boss
planned, at a price 25 percent higher than you
would pay to prepare it yourself?
Sounds pretty bad, right 0 Far away from us,
right"?
Wrong
Its happening here at Stanford. Now.

Stanford prides itself on being a residential uni
versity. One thing that this means is that students
must live in dormitories during their first year,
and are encouraged to live on campus for up to
three years In some of these residences, tenants
(that's you t have to pay extra for such luxuries as
having their mail delivered If you lose your key.
you can't get a new key — you have to shell out for
a new lock
Food is another matter altogether. In an inde
pendent experiment performed in 1978. three
meals a day equivalent in size and composition to
meals at Wilbur Hall were prepared off-campus,
in a residential kitchen, for one month The cost 0
Twenty-five percent less than the food service
charges for their full plan
Who sets the room and board rates 0 Who plans
the menus 0 Why must students pay a flat rate
rather than only for the meals they eat° Who has
final power over residential activities 0 With a few
notable exceptions, it isn't the students; and as
long as it isn't, there will be problems like these.
One may argue that students are aware of this
"agreement" when they enroll, but the awareness
of a situation need not inevitably lead to accep
tance; rather, it can be the first step towards
change.

Registered nurses at Cowell are employed by
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic. Since 1975. they have
been represented locally by the Registered
Nurses Council. Last year they voted overwhelm
ingly to affiliate their local union with a national
one: the Federation of Nurses and Health Pro
fessionals of the American Federation of Teach
ers. The legality of their affiliation has been up
held in administrative court. The clinic has re
fused to recognize the union as the legitimate rep
resentative of the nurses. Legal appeals, which
are expensive. are also time consuming; the pres
ent series of disputes may take a year or more to
resolve.
In the meantime, nurses have been denied pay
raises given to all other employees. The situation
is ludicrous; it is as if the Associated Students
joined the United States Student Association, and
then because of that affiliation was refused recog
nition in its own right by the University. The posi

tion of the clinic is not only immoral, it is un
tenable
The nurses at Cowell are on the front lines of
health care delivery to Stanford students. They
are professionals trying to establish some
semblance of control over their lives and jobs and
are being prevented from doing so. How will that
effect their morale, their compassion, their effec
tiveness on the job'' Their problem becomes our
problem.

Four computer operators refused to work at
Forsythe Hall due to unsafe working conditions.
Hazards were such that construction workers at
the site were given protective equipment, but the
operators were not. The four were docked pay for
their refusal to work, a clear violation of the Cali
fornia Labor Code After hearings before the La
bor Commission, the University was ordered to
pay the workers for the seven to 16 hours they had
each been docked.
The University then announced that they would
dock the workers for the three days they had spent
testifying, more than negating their earlier vic
tory. Again the Labor Commissioner ruled
against the University, summing up as follows:
"Claimants in exercising their rights in refus
ing to work and further having suffered dis
crimination in exercising their right to complain,
cannot be penalized further, or in essence they
would be denied their first right." (emphasis
addedi
The University has refused to comply with that
order and is therefore being sued by the Labor
Commissioner to enforce the order. The matter is
expected to come to trial late this year. The Uni
versity's position seems to be that freedom of
speech can be limited by economic deprivation of
the speaker. When an institution whose motto is
Let the Winds of Freedom Blow" seeks to limit
First Amendment rights through economic coer
cion, the problem of those four workers becomes
our problem as well.

Who runs Stanford?
In his opening address to the entering class this
year. Dean Herant Katchadourian said, "You are
not here to run the University, at least not if we
can help it. but to take control of your own lives."
There is in fact no difference; taking control over
one's life includes exerting some control over the
institutions that attempt to dominate it. Contrary
to former President Richard Lyman's oft-re
peated phrase "Stanford is not. and should not be,
a democracy." I believe that more participation
by active students, staff, minorities, tenants, con
sumers (check all that apply), who are affected
by University policy, is the answer.
When we start to do things for and by ourselves
(though not as individuals > rather than reiving on
the benevolence of the authorities, we will build
the foundation for a just community. We must
work together to achieve the goals which our com
monality of interest dictates.
