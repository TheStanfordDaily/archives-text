## SALT treaty is useful, equitable 
### 
Rarely have we seen such an unbalanced
and misleading representation of arms con
trol efforts, as embodied in the SALT II
treaty, as the commentary by Scott Richter
which appeared on this page (Daily, Octo
ber 15). The author argues that SALT II
should be rejected by the United States,
without further ado, because of three major
shortcomings. Because of our conviction
that a careful and dispassionate analysis of
the SALT treaty is of vital importance in
assessing and understanding the document,
we are taking this opportunity to address
each of his points in turn
First. Richter writes that the SALT II
treaty "grants to the Soviets a unilateral
right to 308 heavy missile launchers" which
"have more destructive potential" than all
U.S. missile forces combined. We assume
that in using the term "destructive poten
tial." Richter is referring to the "throw
weight" of "heavy" Soviet missiles. While
technically correct, the criticism is essen
tially irrelevant.
Under the terms of the treaty, the Soviets
are prevented from exploiting the greater
"throw-weight" of their large ICBMs
through the so-called "fractionation" lim
its. In other words, the heaviest Soviet land
based missile, the SS-18. can be deployed
with no more than 10 independently re
targetable re-entry vehicles, or warheads.
Under the accord, the United States is en
titled to outfit its newest ICBM. the MX
(now under development) with an equal
number of re-entry vehicles.
The critical point is that under a SALT re
gime the Soviets cannot utilize fully the "de
structive potential" of their largest land
based systems. Without SALT, they could
deploy up to 30 independently targetable
warheads on the SS-18. By way of clari
fication. it should also be emphasized that
the United States currently possesses a
larger number of strategic nuclear war
heads than does the Soviet Union. We will
continue to enjoy a quantitative advantage,
under SALT, throughout the life of the trea
ty-
We might add that the size or "yield" of
an individual nuclear warhead is a less sig
nificant factor in assuring target destruc
tion than the accuracy with which it can be
delivered to its destination
On the whole. Soviet missiles are larger
than their American counterparts. U.S. sys
tems, on the other hand, are more accurate
and more technologically sophisticated
than Soviet weapons, in large measure ob
viating the need for excessively large war
heads. In terms of the ability to destroy pro
tected. hardened targets of military value,
the United States currently maintains
strategic nuclear forces at least as capable
of those of the Soviet Union.
It is useful to point out that American mil
itary planners intentionally chose to pro
cure smaller systems because of their utili
ty sophistication and greater military ef
fectiveness. The United States was not com
pelled to do so by the SALT process.
Moreover, no responsible Pentagon official

has urged that we develop a missile with
weight and size characteristics comparable
to those of the SS-18. In the simplest of
terms, there has not been, nor is there to
day. a need to deploy such forces.
the second criticism Richter levels
against SALT II is that it allows the Soviets
to have — but not count — some 275 in
tercontinental Backfire bombers. TheTu-26
Backfire is a modern, multipurpose air
craft. similar in bomb load carrying
capability to larger American aircraft for
ward based in Europe with the capacity to
reach targets in the Soviet Union.
Its principal utility is as a weapons plat
form for use in the European and Asian the
aters. It is of limited value against targets
located in the continental United States.
American forward based systems are not
constrained by SALT 11. while the Backfire
is constrained by a separate agreement lim
iting its range, area of deployment, and rate
of production. The "Backfire Statement"
has the force of international law, as does
the treaty itself.
In addition, the provisions of the
"Backfire Statement" are judged to be ade
quately verifiable by existing American in
telligence capabilities, as is the treaty more
generally. In other words, with respect to
both the "Backfire Statement" and the
treaty, there is no obligation to "trust" the
Russians. Any militarily significant vio
lations of the accord could and would be de
tected.
The third of Richter's points is the most
perplexing and the most misleading. The
charge that the SALT treaty "lumps weap
ons of grossly disparate accuracies and de
structive powers together" is a non-argu
ment. As we mentioned earlier, Soviet sys
tems have greater yield, while American
weapons can be delivered with greater ac
curacy. Each side's forces fulfill the roles
and assure the target coverage for which its
force planners perceive a need.
To argue that the United States must
mimic the Soviet Union, or vice versa, when
the weapons we design are fully adequate in
their present form, is to be blind to the fun
damental differences in technological style
separating the two superpowers. This does
not represent a weakness, but an asym
metry of technological emphasis which pro
duces what we would describe as an im
perfect but acceptable strategic balance.
Regrettably, Richter did not mention
some of the important consequences which
might ensue in the event that the United
States fails to ratify SALT 11. It seems to us
worth noting, for example, that in the
absence of SALT, the Soviets could increase
their target coverage dramatically by
doubling or even tripling the numbers of
warheads deplovable on their existing
ICBM force They could also deploy, within
five to seven years, an entirely new gener
ation of land-based missiles now under de
velopment. They are unable to do so with
SALT in effect.
The Soviets would also be free to engage
in large-scale deception with respect to the

procurement and stationing of their
strategic forces and to interfere in Ameri
can monitoring and verification activities,
which defense planners in this country re
gard as central to the preservation of U.S.
security and strategic stability.
All of these actions are prohibited ex
plicitly by the treaty and all would violently
alter the degree of certainty with which
American military officials could plan for
the future. It is no accident that the Joint
Chiefs of Staff have come out in vigorous
support of the treaty as the dour prospects
of a strategic environment unregulated by
SALT b Tome apparent.
SALT II has many corollary benefits as
well. It adds a degree of predictability to the
relationship between the U.S. and U.S.S.R.
Without this factor, strategic-military rela
tions could deteriorate dramatically, re
sulting in the return of worst-case scenarios
and a dangerously destabilizing nuclear
arms race. As it now stands, the Standing
Consultative Commission, created by SALT
I, provides a forum for clarification of vari
ous treaty ambiguities and for airing griev
ances in the strategic realm. The loss of the
SCC would significantly reduce the ability
of the United States and the Soviet Union to
communicate with one another on these sen
sitive matters.
In the 1979 Senate hearings on the ratifi
cation of SALT 11. the treaty held up well un
der rigorous examination and analysis. It
fell victim to external events. The belated
discovery of a Soviet brigade in Cuba and
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused
more controversy over the treaty than the
actual provisions of the document. SALT II
should be separated from the problems of
the external environment and assessed in
dependently on its own merits. If. as we
agree, it serves the national interests of the
United States, it should be ratified.
We are not arguing that the Soviets have
not significantly improved and modernized
their forces in the past decade. Nor do we
deny that the United States must do every
thing necessary to maintain an adequate
strategic nuclear deterrent. U.S. forces
must be strong, secure, reliable and sur
vivable. The most salient point about SALT
II is that it places significant constraints on
present and future Soviet strategic systems
while not preventing the United States from
doing that which is required to protect its
own deterrent. In fact, it makes that task
much easier.
The SALT II treaty is useful, equitable,
verifiable, and a contribution to the security
of the United States. Only when the facts are
presented clearly can rational decisions
about SALT be made and the kind of misin
terpreted. vague, and impressionistic
alarmism of Richter's article be avoided.
