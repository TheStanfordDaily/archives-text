# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Michael Selmi Smooth hands, broken dreams 
### 
Jim was born in 1940, or was it
'50. '60, '70? Born and raised in
Brooklyn, in Chicago. Alabama,
across the railroad tracks, on
the lake, San Jose. Nob Hill.
Born to two fine parents — they
had his life all mapped out. Jim
would be just like his daddy — a
businessman. He would go to
school, college, graduate
school, get married, have two
children. Yes. Jim would be a
good father, it would be a good
life.
Jim went to school where he
learned everything he needed to
know. Thou shalt not. the multi
plication tables, my country
right or wrong, what they don't
know won't hurt them, looking

out for number one Jim sat
in his assigned seat everyday
and he did as the teacher told
him. He took the multiple guess,
or is that choice, test where the
teacher instructed, "Be sure to
color in the bubble completely.
If you go outside the bubble or do
not color the bubble fully it will
be marked wrong."
Jim worked as a busboy, a
bellhop; he drove a truck, an
swered telephones, went door
to-door, "Ma'am, would you be
willing to help a young man
work his way through college?"
Then Mary came into his life.
They were the perfect couple
and every weekend they would
go out. They would go to a mov
ie. or to dinner, or to a movie
and dinner, or to dinner and a
movie, or — on a special occa
sion — to dinner, a movie, and a
snack afterwards. They were
the perfect couple.
But for some reason Jim was
not happy. He wanted to be his
own boss and do his own things.
"So where are you going to go
to college Jim?"
"I don't want to go to college,
dad."
"What, you have to go to col

lege.
"But why?"
"Because everybody else
does, that's why. You can't live
out there without a degree."
"But dad. I don't want to be
locked behind a desk all my life.
I want to work with my hands,
go surfing, skiing — I want to be
a writer."
"You a writer — huh,
huh "
"Why not? Why not?"
Jim did go on to college just
like everyone had told him to do.
He studied and worked hard and
bought his term papers from
term paper anonymous. But on
graduation day he stood at the
front of his class with 500 more
just like him following directly
behind. They all looked the
same in their caps and gowns
and nobody could tell the dif
ference. They walked in a sin
gle-file line to receive their
diploma from the school presi
dent. "Congratulations, you're
a fine man," he would say to
each and every one of them,
without bothering to know their
name Jim went on to graduate
school, just like every one told
him to do.

Finally. Jim made it out into
the business world — just like
daddy. He wore a suit to work
and sat behind a desk all dav
hating every minute of it. Get up
at 7. go to work at 9. coffee
break, lunch, go home, eat din
ner, read the paper, watch John
ny Carson bomb his
monologue.. . Every day. same
old thing, every day.
By the way. Jim did marry his
high school sweetheart and they
had two children — one boy and
one girl. Jim coached his son's
little league team although he
did not know the difference be
tween a touchdown and a home
run.and Mary was a member of
the PTA although she would
have rather been at the local dis
co. But it was a good life, they
had security, friends, and took
no risks. Happy? Well not ex
actly. but who cares 0
Here lies the body of Jim. 63.3
years of living and what did he
have to show for it'.' Unused
hands, unfulfilled dreams, and
unwritten novels were all that
remained. But no tears were
shed — even his son was too
busy to attend.
