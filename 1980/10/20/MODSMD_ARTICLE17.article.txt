Abortion issue
In April of 1980. Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly gave a strong
sermon at Memorial Church on
abortion I did not hear it. but
was given a copy subsequently
by a friend. As a physician, and
a recently committed Christian,
I have been re-examining my
own previous "liberal" stance
on this difficult issue. Since
abortion is a problem that all
sexually active members of the
Stanford community potentially
face. I would like to share my
thoughts.
Hamerton-Kelly's principal
medical reference was Dr.
Bernard Nathanson. a New
York gynecologist and formerly
the director of a large abortion
clinic. Dr. Nathanson published
an article on abortion in 1974 in
the New Flngland Journal of
Medicine, entitled "Deeper into
abortion" and subsequently
wrote a book on the subject.
Nathanson makes great at
tempts to tred the narrow road
between radical feminists on
the one hand and the equally
strident "Right-to-Life" move
ment on the other. He requests
that "somehow, we must not
deny the pervasive sense of loss
that should accompany abortion
and its most unfortunate inter
ruption of life. We must not
coarsen our sensitivities
through common practice and
brute denial."
His final plea is for avoidance
of "screaming placards and
mindless marches." and his
conclusion that "the issue is hu
man life ... it deserves the rev
erent stillness and ineffably
grave thought appropriate to it.
We must work together to
create a moral climate rich
enough to provide for abortion,
but sensitive enough to life to
accommodate a profound sense
of loss."
Even for Christians, the Bible
has no unequivocal guidelines
for abortion. The sixth com
mandment is "Thou shalt not
kill"; but modern medicine is
increasingly uncertain either
where life begins or where it
ends. Hamerton-Kellv comes

down strongly in opposition to
abortion, but equally sincere
Christians prefer legalized
abortion to the horrors of illegal
abortions or unwanted children.
A situation close to my own
heart arose recently when a
dear friend struggling to rebuild
a broken marriage was forced
to choose between terminating
an out-of-wedlock pregnancy or
terminating the marriage. Is
there a lesser evil here?
Finding a normal newborn in
fant to adopt is an almost im
possible task for infertile
couples today. Carrying an un
wanted pregnancy to term and

putting the child up for adoption
is an alternative rarely con
sidered among students.
Memorial Church has this
year proposed a network of fi
nancial. emotional and spiritual
support for women who choose
to continue unwanted pregnan
cies, with the hope that women
will recognize that there is a
viable, or even preferable, al
ternative.
I urge you to consider it. Let
doctors be a problem pregnancy
counselling service, and not
merely an abortion referral ser
vice.
