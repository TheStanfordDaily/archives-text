## Textile workers sign union contract 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Roanoke Rapids, N.C. — In a historic
breakthrough in one of the South s most bit
ter labor struggles. 3000 textile workers
here were invited to vote yesterday on the
tirst union contract with J.P. Stevens & Co.,
a citadel of resistance to unionization
The vote comes more than six years after
a vote in August 1974 gave the Amalgamated
Clothing and Textile Workers Union of
America the right to represent employees in
the seven Stevens mills here. Since 1963, the
union has tried to organize the 34,000 work
ers in 80 mills plants operated by Stevens.
The tentative agreement, reached late
Friday, was described by union officials as
including a union dues checkoff clause, in
creased retirement benefits and retroactive
pav raises of 19 percent.
Pay boosts granted
The contract includes two retroactive pay
boosts that Stevens granted over the past
(wo years to workers at its 70 non-union
plants but not the union plants in Roanoke

Rapids.
It would be the first pay raise since July
1978 for Stevens workers here. Union lead
ers say they earn an average of $4.36 an
hour.
The agreement covers only the Roanoke
Rapids plants but is expected to become a
model for Stevens plants in High Point and
Bovlston, N.C.; Allendale, S.C.; and Mont
gomery. Ala. The contract could also set the
pattern for any other plant the union might
organize, but sources have said Stevens in
tends to continue to contest union efforts to
organize its workers.
Union resistance
The company has been a bulwark of
southern industrial resistance to unions in
recent years.
The agreements mark a major victory for
the union. It has long tried to unionize the
textile industry, which began moving out of
New England and into the South in the 1950s
to avoid unions.
The National Labor Relations Board and

the courts, in cases dating back to 1963, have
found the company guilty of illegally firing
union supporters, spying on pro-union work
ers and threatening employees with repris
als if they supported the unions.
But the company continued, until recent
ly, to refuse to negotiate an agreement with
the union, preferring instead to pay the rela
tively minor penalties imposed for the vio
lations of federal law and to reinstate il
legally fired workers.
Legal loopholes
The company's tactic of using loopholes
in federal law to avoid signing contracts
with the union, even after a majority of
workers in nine plants had voted for union
representation, led to pressure for labor law
reform But the ensuing bill was blocked by
a Senate filibuster.
Union sources said labor organizations
probably would end a national boycott of
Stevens products that began five years ago
and drew the support of some religious
groups.
