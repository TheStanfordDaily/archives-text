# Utility plans renewable energy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — Southern Cali
fornia Edison Co. Friday be
came the first major electric
utility in the nation to commit
itself to large-scale develop
ment of unconventional, re
newable energy sources such as
wind and solar power.
The shift in policy, which was
praised by environmentalists,
could eventually lead to a de
cision to cancel one or both of
Edison's proposed coal
projects, which the company
had previously been counting on
to supply most of its new elec
tric power in the late 1980s.
By 1990. according to in
formation supplied by the com
pany. about 30 percent of the an
ticipated 6 million kilowatts of
additional electricity it needs
will be met by unconventional
energy sources such as wind,
geothermal, solar, fuel cells,
hydroelectric and cogeneration.
"It is the policy of Edison,"
said William Gould, the new
chairman and chief executive of
the Rosemead-based company,
"to devote our corporate re
sources to the accelerated de
velopment of a wide variety of
future electric power sources
which are renewable rather
than finite."

Edison plans to complete
work on Units 2 and 3 of its San
Onofre nuclear power plant,
which it said is 90 percent fin
ished, and to finish construction
of the three planned units of the
Palo Verde nuclear plant in Ari
zona. which it said is 50 percent
completed.
An anti-nuclear group, the Al
liance for Survival, welcomed
Edison's new emphasis on re
newable energy but said the

company should also move to
convert its San Onofre nuclear
plant to an alternative fuel such
as natural gas and methane
from biomass.
Edison, like other electric
utilities in the state, has been
under pressure from regulators
and environmental groups to de
velop renewable energy sources
and to support conservation pro
grams in order to reduce the
need for more expensive new

coal and nuclear power plants.
In addition, utilities across
the country are faced with a
changed economic situation in
which the combination of unex
pectedly sluggish growth in de
mand for electricity and sky
rocketing borrowing rates has
made conventional power
plants much riskier to build.
Edison currently serves more
than 18 million people.
