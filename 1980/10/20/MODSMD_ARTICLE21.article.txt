# Media influence election
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — It is time for a change —a
good slogan in any political season, and a good
description of the behavior of the mass media
during the last fortnight of this political sea
son.
Two weeks ago, Ronald Reagan was enjoy
ing his best moment in the fall campaign, on
two counts First, the media coverage, partic
ularly on television, was friendly and upbeat,
while President .Jimmy Carter was getting the
treatment for his "mean" campaigning. Sec
ond. a large part of the media seemed to be
forming a consensus over the weekend of Oct.
4-5 that Reagan was moving into a real lead in
the horse race.
Now the moment has passed, for two rea
sons. First, the horse race no longer appears to
favor Reagan. Second, the media coverage of
Reagan has turned negative. The 1980 yo-yo
has reversed directions once again

News Analysis

Both changes deserve scrutiny. Both are in
structive examples of the dynamics of a presi
dential campaign in the mass media era.
The snapshot 10 days ago showed Reagan
leading in enough states to win the election, at
least according to the surveys done by NBC
News. Newsweek, The Washington Star and
The New York Times. (All of them appeared
during a few days, on or near the weekend
before last.) The snapshot showed Carter
struggling with a spreading perception that he
was campaigning nastily, meanly, unpresiden
tially.
But this was just a snapshot, not an accurate
portrait of the complex American organism at
the height of a presidential campaign. And vir

tuallv the moment it was developed and pasted
into the media album, it started to turn brown
During exactly this same period, the tone of
the media coverage of Reagan — particularly
on television — has changed from passive and
friendly to much more skeptical Arguably, the
change in perception of Reagan's chances af
fected the perception of Reagan the candidate,
but in fact, there were three separate develop
ments beyond the perception of the horse race
that came into play:
First, the mass media was coming to the end
of a cycle in its campaign reporting. After
more than a week of friendly, upbeat Reagan
coverage, reporters, producers and editors
were due for one of the periodic moments of re
evaluation that is typical of their trade
Shouldn't we be taking a closer look at Reagan
now? That question was asked at The Wash
ington Post and at other media offices.
Second, the White House — in the persons of
press secretary Jodv Powell, pollster Pat Cad
dell and others — had begun a concerted effort
to put pressure on the media, pressure to end
what they called Reagan's "free ride" on tele
vision and in the papers. These Carter aides ap
proached reporters and editors personally,
complaining that Reagan's record deserved
much closer scrutiny than it was getting.
Third, and crucially important, Reagan
himself made an enormous contribution. On
Oct. 9. he caught himself in a rhetorical thicket
over the sources of air pollution, declaring that
Mount St. Helens and the nation's stands of
timber were important sources of pollutants.
Reagan looked silly on the network news shows
that night, and he revived doubts about his in
tellectual capacities at a thoroughly (for his
campaign) inopportune moment.
