## Philadelphia's Comeback Kids surge to 4-3 Series triumph 
### Washington Post 
Kansas City, Mo. — The Phil
adelphia Phillies will call them
selves the Comeback Kids after
their stirring two-run rally in
the ninth inning yesterday that
beat the Kansas City Royals,
4-3, in the fifth game of a World
Series that now tilts heavily in
Philadelphia's favor, three
games to two.

World Series

The Phils and their fans will
talk of Bob Boone's single and
Del Unser's pinch-hit RBI
double and Manny Trillo's
game-winning infield hit in that
thrilling ninth inning. And they
will praise Tug McGraw for his
two victorious innings of relief
and the way he worked out of a
bases-loaded-with-walks jam in
the ninth.
What the Royals will re
member. however, is the way
Boone's ground smash rolled
tantalizinglv out of George
Brett's glove at third, and how
Unser's one-hop bullet went
right past immobile first
baseman Willie Aikens. who ac
tually moved out of the way to
try a fancy sweeping grab. And
finally, they will think of the
way Trillo's liner hit square in
the glove of losing pitcher Dan
Quisenberrv's glove, then rolled
slowly away as Unser sped

home with the winning run.
Thanks to the bizarre, made
for-television 3:37 p.m. start of
this game, the light was so bad
— dark on the mound, dark at
the plate, but with a terrible
slash of sun in between — that of
the game's first 13 hitters, a
dozen went out meekly, five
fanned and only one got a hit.
And that one line single to right
didn't count, since Brett got it
and he isn't mortal.
As soon as the sun stripe
moved past the mound in the
third inning, the game could be
gin. Immediately, the Royals,
then the Phils, pulled magnif
icent escapes, helped by ques
tionable thinking on the part of
their foes. After Bowa grounded
a single to center off starter
Larry Gura in the Phil third, he
broke for second base as Boone
hit a tantalizing pop to right.
Frank White made an over-the
shoulder, sprinting catch of
what might have been a double,
then spun and lobbed the ball
back toward first where Bowa
was doubled to end the inning.
Then eerie things began hap
pening to the Royals, the sort of
events that make a team won
der about its karma. Their third
started with great symbolic
promise and ended in dismal
failure.
First, Darrell Porter, hitless
in 10 at bats in the' Series and hit
ting under .100 for nearly a

month, got a line hit. Before the
game, an usher came up to
Porter with a bat and said.
"Darrell, I asked you for this
bat as a present on June 2, when
you were hitting .333. I thought
you might like to have it back."
Porter swung the bat. liked it.
and broke his one-for-20 post
season.
Then, U.L. Washington laid
down a bunt toward third. No
one will ever know if he would
have been out on a close play at
first because second baseman
Trillo forgot to cover when Pete
Rose crept in. properly antici
pating a bunt.
With two on and none out,
Manager Jim Frev faced a de
cision: call for a sacrifice bunt
with swift Willie Wilson (two for
18 with nine whiffs), or go for
the big inning with the top of his
order rolling up.
Wilson swung away and flied
out. Then White, who is so tight
he couldn't hit it if you let him
throw it up himself, dribbled to
second. Brett got a low 1-1 fast
ball and lashed at it, but also
grounded to second. The Royals
dragged off the field almost de
spondently, even though there
was still no score.
As often happens in post
season games, momentum and
enthusiasm swung almost in
stantaneously. With one out in
the fourth. Roval first baseman
