# Wiggin: 'It was a helluva decision'
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Going for the tie instead of
gambling for the win is one of
the lonliest desisions a coach
can make. Especially when the
win seems so tangible. Paul
Wiggin got his first taste of that
as a Stanford head coach Satur
day against Washington when
he went for the sure thing with
1:31 to go and the Cards facing a
fourth-and-two situation on the
Husky 9-yard line.
That certainly won't be the
last time Wiggin will have to
step out on a limb at Stanford,
but this was an especially frag
ile situation and an especially
bitter result.
The Cards lost all but that in
famous mathmatical chance for
a Rose Bowl berth when Wash
ington took the ball in the 1:27
remaining and marched up the
field for the winning field goal.
They did it in nine plays.
Stanford could certainly still
earn the trip to Pasadena if they
win the rest of their conference
games and the Huskies lose two
of theirs. But that's a lot to ask
of a tough Washington team
whose only real obstacle now is
playing USC in Los Angeles.
This is the Pacitic-10 Con
ference and you never can tell
what will happen, but looking at
the odds the Cards might do best
to start adjusting their TV an
tennae towards Pasadena.
Saturday. Wiggin was faced
with two options: go for the win
and the sure advantage in the
Rose Bowl race or go for a tie
which would keep the teams
even in the conference. But he
was also looking at a 71-yard
drive which had stalled short
with three incompletions on an
offense which had faltered short
of the end zone for most of the
second half.
On the other hand, the Stan

lord defense had played gallant
ly throughout the second half,
completely shutting out the
Huskies. That the Cards could
hold Washington for the remain
mg 1:27 didn't seem too
farfetched to the Stanford
coaching staff.
"When it's fourth-and-nine on
the 20. you go for the field goal."

offensive coordinator Denny
tireen said after the game.
"When it's fourth-and-two, you
do the same thing. We were
driving for the touchdown and
they stopped us. A touchdown
wasn't a sure thing. But with
one-and-a-half minutes to go.
you hope the defense can stop

them."
The Stanford defense felt the
same way. Or at least game co
captain and defensive tackle
Doug Rogers did.
"In a situation like that, the
pressure is usually on the of
fense," Rogers said. "They're
the ones that have to score the

points. But today, we were feel
ing the pressure on that (last)
drive. We weren't executing and
it shouldn't be that way."
The decision to take the field
goal in that type of situation was
not one made in the scramble on
the sidelines The brows of Wig
gin and his assistants were un

doubtedly sweating bat the re
action was premeditated to a
certain extent.
"We had talked a long time
about a tie during the week."
Wiggin said later We figured
out the whole procedure of going
to the Hose Bowl and we based
our decision on that. I'll simply
say it was a choice we had
made prior to the game. For the
benefit of the skeptics, I thought
it was a helluva decision."
Though not skeptical, the of
fense wanted to go for it. When
asked if he had any second
thoughts about his coach's de
cision. quarterback .John Elway
said: "Of course I wanted to go
for the win just like all of the of
fense did But whatever Coach
Wiggin decides. I'm going to
back him 100 percent. I didn't
have any second thoughts. If he
says a field goal is the right
thing to do. a field goal is the
right thing to do."
Both Washington coach Don
.James and quarterback Tom
Flick felt that Wiggin s decision
was the right one. As Flick said
after the game: "A loss keeps
you out of the Rose Bowl. A tie is
like you never played each oth
er. We would have played for the
tie in that situation."
But the final argument
against the decision might in
volve something neither James
nor Flick nor anyone else who
hasn't been intimately tied to
Stanford football for awhile
could quite understand. That's
the tradition that in the clutch,
the Cardinal offense does the
job, and sometimes the defense
isn't so reliable. The Stanford
coaching staff decided to trust
the here and now instead of trad
ition.
