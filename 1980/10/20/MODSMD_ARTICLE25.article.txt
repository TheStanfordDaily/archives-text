## 
### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford's water polo team
successfully took the next step
towards an NCAA Cham
pionship when they won the
Long Beach State Invitational
tournament and regained the
No 1 ranking this weekend The
Cardinals finished the tour
nament with a 4-0 record and a
19-1-1 season record, defeating
Pepperdine. Long Beach State,
UC-Santa Barbara, and pre
viously top-ranked UC-lrvine
The tournament was the hap
py culmination of an almost sea
son-long road trip for the
Cardinals. Of the 21 games they
have played thus far. 16 were
played away from home

But, in an about face from last
year, rather than wearing the
team down, the road trips have
been almost beneficial When
asked if such a long period of
time away from home had been
tiring for him. goalie John
Gansel replied. "I love water
polo."
On a more serious note, he
said, "I've enjoyed traveling
this year. For instance, when
we went to Long Beach this
weekend, people on the team
wanted it more than the last
tournament. We wanted re
venge against Irvine.'' he said.
Gansel's comments reflect a
kind of confidence under pres
sure that apparently has in
fected the whole team, includ
ing coach Dante Dettamanti.
Stanford played and defeated
four of the top teams in the na
tion in one weekend, yet were

able to pace themselves while
doing so. according to the
Cardinal coach.
They defeated Pepperdine
6-5, Long Beach State 5-2, UC-
Santa Barbara 7-4 and in the
finals of the tournament, UC-
Irvine. by a score of 8-6 And.
said Dettamanti. "We could
have won by more But when we
got a lead in a game we wanted
to pace ourselves."
The progress of each game in
dicated that the Cardinals did
indeed hold back to a certain ex
tent. An overall pattern
emerged, in which the Cardinals
had one particularly strong
scoring spurt per game, settled
into solid defensive play, and
then scored another one or two
goals to put the game out of
reach if a threat became evi
dent.
Against Pepperdine. Stanford
fell behind 3-1 in the first half,
only to score four goals while
holding the Waves scoreless, in
the third quarter
The Pepperdine victory ap
peared to be the most complete
team effort; five individuals
participated in the final out
come; four team members
scored a goal apiece, while hole
man Jodv Campbell scored two.
Against the 49ers, Stanford
scored three of a total five goals
in the first quarter; Alan
Mouchawar and James
Bergeson made the largest con
tributions. with two apiece. In
the 7-4 victory against UC-Santa
Barbara the Cardinals once
again scored three goals in the
first quarter, and Bergeson.
Campbell and Mouchawar con
tributed two goals each.

The story of the cham
pionship match versus UC-
Irvine, at the time ranked No. 1,
was John Gansel. " The guy is
amazing," said Dettamanti
â€¢'He was outstanding through
out the tournament." His per
formance against Irvine, how
ever, made his previous play
look mediocre at best The Stan
ford goalie blocked 17 scoring
attempts over the course of the
game.
Gansel also blocked two pen
alty shots against UCSB. which
very well could have turned the
game against Stanford
A penalty shot occurs about
once every two games, and has a
90 percent chance of scoring
UCSB had the wonderful luck to
be awarded two in one quarter.
John Gansel had the dubiously
honorable task of leaping up and
down in the water while a UCSB

player with an arm like a steel
whip tried to fire the ball
through his face and into the
goal.
Gansel, incredibly, was
"pretty confident at the time "
After blocking the first shot, he
apparently fell into some kind of
superhuman funk "I saw the
guy who took the shots after the
game, and he was giant."
Gansel said "But in my mind,
when he took the shots he looked
small The second time, I felt
like I knew where he was going
to shoot the ball It was weird."
he laughed
The Cardinals once again
seemed to pace themselves
against UC-lrvine, scoring four
goals in the second quarter
when they weren't gawking at
Gansel's antics. With five
minutes remaining in the game
thev led 8-4 and relaxed, allow

ing Irvine to score two irrele
vant goals Bergeson scored
three goals, Greg Lambert two
At the risk of inspiring a se
vere case of Cardinal overcon
fidence, it must be said that the
force appears to be with them.
After a month on the road they
can settle down to a stretch of
comparatively comfortable
games with the deGuerre Pool
advantage.
Dettamanti's objective at the
start of the season was "to
eliminate the peaks and valleys,
to play good, steady, but high
caliber water polo in every
game." "Objective multiplied
to "objectives": to win the most
important conference games
against UCLA and USC, and to
regain the number one ranking.
Now that these have been
achieved, only one goal remains
apparent: to hang on.
