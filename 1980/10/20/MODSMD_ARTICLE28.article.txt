The Stanford field hockey
team had to be pleased yester
day when they returned from
the Arizona Invitational Tour
nament in Tucson.
They had four matches over
the weekend and finished with
two wins and two ties, one of the

Field hockey

standoffs coming against top
ranked Long Beach State. This
was a rally of sorts, especially
after the demoralizing double
dose of shutouts last weekend at

the hands of Washington State
and Cal.
Friday, the Cards played two
matches, one against Long
Beach State and the other
agianst Colorado State.
Stanford tied the 49ers 0-0,
playing total defense in a fash
ion which just did not allow
Long Beach State any chance to
score. In the second match, the
Cards overthrew Colorado State
2-0. with Kelly Westerwick scor
ing off a Patsy Huntington as
sist and Huntington following

with a goal off a Terri Boyle as
sist.
Stanford opened Saturday's
schedule with a 1-1 tie against
the host Arizona Wildcats. Ari
zona scored first on a corner and
the Cards evened it up when
Terri Boyle scored off Becky
Howell's assist.
The Cards finished their suc
cessful weekend with a 4-0
whitewash of Brigham Young.
Becky Howell and Patsy Hunt
ington exploited a bewildered
Cougar defense with two goals
apiece.
