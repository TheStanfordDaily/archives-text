Stanford's football team was
not the only squad to suffer a
heartbreaking, last-minute de
feat this weekend The Cardinal
soccer team lost to a highly re
garded Fresno State club. 3-2, in
the last 90 seconds yesterday.
And while it may not have
been played for a Rose Bowl bid.
the game in Fresno virtually
shut the door on any chances of a
playoff berth for the Cards.
Stanford played evenly with
Fresno much of the first half

before Fresno scored 30 seconds
before ha If time.
The Cards then controlled the
raidlield during the second half
and looked as if they would re
bound from last week's losses to
USC and UCLA Striker Willie
(jiucci netted Stanford's first
goal on an assist from mid
fielder Barry Linnett 16 minutes
after intermission.
Stanford then took the lead on
another Giucci score with 13
minutes left in the match. Ted
Rafalovich's corner kick was
headed by forward Doug Clark

to (iiucci, one of Stanford's
more successful plays.
But Fresno took advantage of
a free kick and scored off of
Roland Dominguez' deflection
to even matters at 2-2 with five
minutes left.
' We're ahead 2-1 and things
look a touch better Fresno
starts pressuring and deflects a
goal off our player Plain dumb
luck So now we're thinking
about overtime. - ' head coach
Nelson Lodge related
Fresno obviously had other
plans. "There are 90 seconds

left in the game." Lodge said.
"The ball comes across the goal
and one of my young people tries
to clear the ball out He doesn t
do it well enough and they come
along and put it in the goal It
was devastating
Stanford must be learning to
deal with devastation — this is
its third narrow loss near the
end of a game or in overtime
The Cards now own a 5-9-1 re
cord and stand 2-2 in the Pacific
Soccer Conference
"We're out of the playoffs —

there s no question in my
mind. Lodge said "We played
a very tough schedule and we've
had some bad luck Our season
includes 17 Division 1 and four
Division II teams. Most sched
ules run 50-50 The only way to
get to the top and break out of
mediocrity is to play the top
teams. We're paying the price
now. but in the long run. we
should be OK
Stanford hosts Sacramento
State tomorrow at 3 p.m. at
Malonev Field
