In response to a report by its Ad Hoc
Committee on the Status of Emeriti at
Stanford, the Faculty Senate ap
proved three recommendations for
the well-being of their retired col
leagues Thursday.
After some debate, the senate voted
to establish a permanent committee
on emeriti. The committee will "sur
vey periodically the status of emeriti"
and "make appropriate recommenda
tions to the senate."
A policy recognizing the Univer
sity's "responsibility to emeriti in
view of adverse inflationary circum
stances" passed with unanimous ap
proval. The policy includes finding
practical means of combatting the
problem.

The senate also agreed to designate
an administrative office especially de
voted to problems of emeriti. In
formation on existing emeriti bene
fits. financial problems, and em
ployment needs will be available
The emeriti report, presented by
Ombudsman John Goheen. chairman
of the ad hoc committee, draws atten
tion to serious economic concerns con
fronting emeriti — as well as current
faculty — based on the rate of infla
tion.
"The study shows quite clearly,
some of us are going to be running into
financial difficulty despite ourselves
in the face of time." Goheen warned.
"The projected effects of a 10
percent inflation rate over a long peri
od are devastating," the report said.

After 20 years, incomes of a given size
will be worth only 15 percent of their
original value.
Based on a survey of retired faculty
and present 'between 60 and 65. the
study shows that "the majority of
emeriti are reasonably well-off finan
cially." The profs rely on sources of
income independent of pension and so
cial security.
However, 20 emeriti are living on an
income of $15,000 a year or less. With
inflation, the purchasing power of
these small incomes is "constantly
eroding." according to the report.
The questionnaire, formulated and
interpreted by Anthropology Prof. P.
Clifford Barnett, investigated other
aspects of the lives of emeriti includ-
ing general demographics, health and
activities. Their current and past rela
tions with the University were con
sidered along with their attitudes and
opinions.
The second half of the study,
directed at the pre-emeritus group,
shows them to be "active in all
aspects of academic life." and in bet
ter health than others of the same age.
Fifty-nine percent of the pre-emer
iti plan to be involved with the Univer
sity and academic activities at age 75.
Almost half of the respondents be
lieve retirement at 75 or at no specific
date is desirable.
