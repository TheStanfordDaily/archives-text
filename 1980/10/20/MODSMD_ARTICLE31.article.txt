Washington — Conventional world oil production proba
bly will show little or no increase over the next 20 years
while U.S. production probably will decline sharply, ac
cording to a congressional studv released yesterday from
the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA >.

gressional Board, said the study shows that "unless the

Evanston, 111. — Several thousand people, including in
dependent presidential candidate John Anderson, turned
out yesterday to oppose a crosstown neo-Nazi rally and
what one rabbi called the "foul emanations of Nazi bigotry
and hatred."
The Nazi gathering was planned a half-mile from the

predominantly Jewish suburb of Skokie, where a highly
publicized 1978 Nazi rally was planned and then canceled
"Evanston said, they'll never come here.' Well, they're
wrong No city is safe," said Michael Allen, Midwest coor
dinator for the National Socialist Party of America, a Chi
cago-based neo-Nazi group that planned the demonstra
tion in Lovelace Park

catastrophe," said Sol Goldstein, one of several Jewish
leaders who organized the Jewish counter-demonstration

Lava dome rising on Mt. St. Helens
Vancouver, Wash. — Mount St. Helens showed no signs
of settling down yesterday, after five outbursts of steam
and volcanic ash in 48 hours, even though a lava dome was
forming rapidly in the volcano's crater, scientists said.
"We're still in an eruptive phase," said Susan Russell-
Robinson, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
Russell-Robinson said the dome, estimated to be about 80
feet high late Saturday, had grown to 155 feet by 10:30 a.m.
yesterday.
The dome of thick, pasty lava began forming Saturday
after a pair of ash and steam bursts that rose to 25,000 feet.
They were the fourth and fifth episodes in an eruption
series that began Thursday with a blast to 50,000 feet.
There were no reports of injuries or damage in the latest
eruptions.
Since the explosive May 18 eruption that killed 34 people
and left 28 missing and presumed dead, Mount St. Helens
has twice blown out domes that formed after earlier erup
tions. By yesterday afternoon, the new dome was already
bigger than either of the earlier two. The May 18 eruption
blew away about 1300 feet of the mountain's peak.

Lava dome rising on Mt. St. Helens
Vancouver, Wash. — Mount St. Helens showed no signs
of settling down yesterday, after five outbursts of steam
and volcanic ash in 48 hours, even though a lava dome was
forming rapidly in the volcano's crater, scientists said.
"We're still in an eruptive phase," said Susan Russell-
Robinson, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
Russell-Robinson said the dome, estimated to be about 80
feet high late Saturday, had grown to 155 feet by 10:30 a.m.
yesterday.
The dome of thick, pasty lava began forming Saturday
after a pair of ash and steam bursts that rose to 25,000 feet.
They were the fourth and fifth episodes in an eruption
series that began Thursday with a blast to 50,000 feet.
There were no reports of injuries or damage in the latest
eruptions.
Since the explosive May 18 eruption that killed 34 people
and left 28 missing and presumed dead, Mount St. Helens
has twice blown out domes that formed after earlier erup
tions. By yesterday afternoon, the new dome was already
bigger than either of the earlier two. The May 18 eruption
blew away about 1300 feet of the mountain's peak.
