# Young Swede has heart transplant
## 
### Carla Kerr 
Last Thursday night at Stanford
Medical Center. Matti Mvllvniemi, 18,
an assembly worker from Stockholm,
became the first Swede to receive a
heart transplant.
The case has received much media
coverage in Sweden, where heart
transplants are illegal. Death is de
fined in that country as cessation of
heartbeat rather than of brain waves,
the criterion now used in the United
States.
The Swedish government flew the
youth to Stanford, where two-thirds of
all heart transplants have been per
formed, on Oct. 1.
He was admitted to the program be
cause his end-stage heart disease
made his chances of surviving the next
six to 12 months "poor," while his
youth and absence of other systemic
disorders made his chances of re
covery favorable. About 20 patients a
month are considered for transplants,
and only two or three are selected.

Just over a week after his arrival
Myllyniemi suffered two cardiac ar
rests. Doctors implanted a pacemaker
but became anxious about his ability
to wait much longer for a donor.
This was the 197 th heart transplant
performed at Stanford since the pro
gram began in 1968, yet donor supply
remains a critical factor. As much as
one-third of the patients awaiting
transplants here dies before a suitable
donor becomes available.
Doctors finally located a donor for
Mvllvniemi Thursday afternoon in Los
Angeles. After extensive tests of com
patibility between the recipient and
the new heart, the team of Stanford
doctors brought the heart here aboard
a chartered plane.
If current statistics hold true,
Mvllvniemi has a 50 percent chance of
surviving the next five years. The
longest survivor to date received his
transplant in 1970. Considering the
Swede's youth. Med Center surgeons
hope Mvllvniemi will set a record.
