## 
### Daily wire services 
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq and Iran
battled along the Shatt-al-Arab water
way and launched air attacks against
each other's cities yesterday, their ar
mies claimed, violating Islam's
holiest feast. Fierce fighting was re
ported in Iran after the two nations re
jected Moslem appeals for a holiday
cease-fire.
"Strike hard because you are truly
God's sword on earth," Iraqi Presi
dent Saddam Hussein exhorted his sol
diers in a broadcast from Baghdad He
referred to Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini as a "lunatic."
"You must be prepared for a con
tinuation of this war," Iran's Presi
dent Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said in a
radio speech to his troops.
The pronouncements came despite
peace efforts from Moslem quarters
and indicated neither side in the four
week-old war is ready to quit.
Iranian Prime Minister Moham
mad Ali Rajai, meanwhile, was on his
way back from New York to Tehran,
with a stopover in Algeria. Rajai. who
made his nation's case in the war
before the U.N. Security Council, had
accused the United States of support
ing Iraq in the conflict.
'Purely defensive'
Responding to Rajai's expressed
concern about Washington's deploy
ment of four AWAC reconnaissance
planes in the Persian Gulf, Secretary
of State Edmund Muskie, said yester
day the aircraft are purely defensive
and are not directed against Iran.
Muskie, appearing on ABC's Issues
and Answers, suggested that the Unit
ed States would not heed a demand
made Saturday by Rajai that the
planes be withdrawn.
Muskie reaffirmed once again that
the United States is impartial in the
Iran-Iraq war and he denied Rajai's
charge that the AWACs are supplying
intelligence information to Iraq.

Rajai told reporters in New York
Saturday the AWACs deployment and
what he described as U.S. "protec
tion" of the pro-Iraqi government of
Jordan were "obstacles to a solution"
of the hostage problem.
Iraq said Iran's jets bombed Bagh
dad and two cities to the north, Sul
eimanieh and Wasset. killing one civil
ian and wounding three. Iran said
Iraqi MiGs attacked the besieged Ira
nian refinery city of Abadan and rock
eted the railway station of the provin
cial capital of Ahwaz to the north. One

person was reported killed in Ahwaz.
The Iranians claimed they pushed
Iraqi ground forces back from the
edges of Abadan toward the Shatt al-
Arab. the disputed waterway that
forms part of the border between the
combatants.
Both sides reported hand-to-hand
fighting around Abadan and in the Ira
nian port of Khorramshahr. nine miles
apart on the Shatt al-Arab. Iran for the
first time acknowledged Iraqi forces
controlled the highways leading into
Abadan.
