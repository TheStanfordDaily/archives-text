# Billing for residence damage to be evaluated

Spurred by student complaints.
Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson has asked two adminis
trators to evaluate the current system
of billing students for damages occur
ring in student housing.
"There have been some complaints
from the residences that people
weren't being charged in a timely
way." explained Robinson.
Timeliness is a major problem cited
by Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
former resident fellow at Arroyo
House.
It was not until last April that the
University began asking who was re
sponsible for a lampshade broken in
October 1979. according to Durham.
"The absence of immediate feed
back gives people the wrong message.
It's unfair to come back six months
later waving a bill," said Durham.
"By that time, who can remember
what actually happened?"
Elizabeth Hayama, director of ad
ministration for Residential Educa
tion. is part of a team that Robinson

has asked to come up with a policy re
garding damages. Hayama says she is
working to solve the problem of un
timely billing.
"It doesn't do anyone any good to
wait for months for something to be
fixed or for charges to be billed." Hay
ama explained.
Students complain, however, that in
the past they have been kept waiting
for repairs â€” even after they've paid
damage fees.
John Willis, a returning resident at
Arroyo, said dorm members were
charged for holes in the ceiling of the
third floor, but the ceiling has not yet
been repaired.
"Students are billed for things that
are supposed to be repaired over the
summer, but aren't." added Durham.
The University says it is taking
steps to prevent such occurrences.
"This year we're trying to handle
things in a quicker response time so
that three or four months later dam
ages don't come back to hauntthe stu
dents," said Bob Mibach, facilities
