# Billing for residence damage to be evaluated
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Spurred by student complaints.
Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson has asked two adminis
trators to evaluate the current system
of billing students for damages occur
ring in student housing.
"There have been some complaints
from the residences that people
weren't being charged in a timely
way." explained Robinson.
Timeliness is a major problem cited
by Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
former resident fellow at Arroyo
House.
It was not until last April that the
University began asking who was re
sponsible for a lampshade broken in
October 1979. according to Durham.
"The absence of immediate feed
back gives people the wrong message.
It's unfair to come back six months
later waving a bill," said Durham.
"By that time, who can remember
what actually happened?"
Elizabeth Hayama, director of ad
ministration for Residential Educa
tion. is part of a team that Robinson

has asked to come up with a policy re
garding damages. Hayama says she is
working to solve the problem of un
timely billing.
"It doesn't do anyone any good to
wait for months for something to be
fixed or for charges to be billed." Hay
ama explained.
Students complain, however, that in
the past they have been kept waiting
for repairs — even after they've paid
damage fees.
John Willis, a returning resident at
Arroyo, said dorm members were
charged for holes in the ceiling of the
third floor, but the ceiling has not yet
been repaired.
"Students are billed for things that
are supposed to be repaired over the
summer, but aren't." added Durham.
The University says it is taking
steps to prevent such occurrences.
"This year we're trying to handle
things in a quicker response time so
that three or four months later dam
ages don't come back to hauntthe stu
dents," said Bob Mibach, facilities
manager for the residences.
Rick Rickertsen. house manager
for Delta Upsilon fraternity, feels the
DUs are being haunted because of
damages incurred five years ago.
"We have a debt from a group of
people who have alredy graduated,"
said Rickertsen. "I wish things from
five or six years ago wouldn't be hang
ing over our heads."
When a damage occurs in a dorm it
is reported to the office of the resident
field staffer. The field staffer fills out
a work order form and sends it to
Mibaeh in the residence manager's of
fice. Mibaeh then assigns the form to
the Tovon workshop and the shop dis
patches a worker to the scene.
If the job is too large for the Tovon
shop, then it's referred to Jerry Hum
mel. manager of the Crafts Shop.
Work orders are taken on a priority
basis. Mibaeh and Hummel decide the
priority a damage report receives.
They also help establish guidelines
for the cost of damage repairs.
Mibaeh is preparing a memo that will
outline the costs of routine damages
such as broken windows, lost keys and
damaged walls. Hummel works with

shop supervisors to determine the cost
of labor and materials.
Though some students claim the
tees for charges are unfair. Mibaeh
and Hummel are quick to refute those
charges.
"We try to keep things low." said
Hummel. "We even eat a little bit of
the labor." he said.
Prices often hinge upon the location
of the damage and the amount of dif
ficulty involved in repairing the dam
age. A broken window on the first floor
of a dormitory, for example, costs less
than a broken window on the second or
third floor. The type of glass used is
also a factor.
Setting up more rigid guidelines in
establishing responsibility for dam
ages and dealing directly with the stu
dents are seen by Hayama as other
methods of deterring damages.
Because the bill is earmarked with
a student code, the residential educa
tion office will ideally prepare an esti
mate of the cost to repair the damage
and issue the student or living resi
dence an intent to bill form.
"That's the time students and living
groups should explain any extenuating

circumstances." said Hayama.
"Unless it's an item on order, we
will not be charging students for re
placement or repairs until the items
are replaced or repaired." she said.
Hayama is also dealing with the
question of unclaimed damages. The
University absorbs the cost of uniden
tified vandalism.

garding damages. Hayama says she is
working to solve the problem of un
timely billing.
"It doesn't do anyone any good to
wait for months for something to be
fixed or for charges to be billed." Hay
ama explained.
Students complain, however, that in
the past they have been kept waiting
for repairs — even after they've paid
damage fees.
John Willis, a returning resident at
Arroyo, said dorm members were
charged for holes in the ceiling of the
third floor, but the ceiling has not yet
been repaired.
"Students are billed for things that
are supposed to be repaired over the
summer, but aren't." added Durham.
The University says it is taking
steps to prevent such occurrences.
"This year we're trying to handle
things in a quicker response time so
that three or four months later dam
ages don't come back to hauntthe stu
dents," said Bob Mibach, facilities
manager for the residences.
Rick Rickertsen. house manager
for Delta Upsilon fraternity, feels the
DUs are being haunted because of
damages incurred five years ago.
"We have a debt from a group of
people who have alredy graduated,"
said Rickertsen. "I wish things from
five or six years ago wouldn't be hang
ing over our heads."
When a damage occurs in a dorm it
is reported to the office of the resident
field staffer. The field staffer fills out
a work order form and sends it to
Mibaeh in the residence manager's of
fice. Mibaeh then assigns the form to
the Tovon workshop and the shop dis
patches a worker to the scene.
If the job is too large for the Tovon
shop, then it's referred to Jerry Hum
mel. manager of the Crafts Shop.
Work orders are taken on a priority
basis. Mibaeh and Hummel decide the
priority a damage report receives.
They also help establish guidelines
for the cost of damage repairs.
Mibaeh is preparing a memo that will
outline the costs of routine damages
such as broken windows, lost keys and
damaged walls. Hummel works with

shop supervisors to determine the cost
of labor and materials.
Though some students claim the
tees for charges are unfair. Mibaeh
and Hummel are quick to refute those
charges.
"We try to keep things low." said
Hummel. "We even eat a little bit of
the labor." he said.
Prices often hinge upon the location
of the damage and the amount of dif
ficulty involved in repairing the dam
age. A broken window on the first floor
of a dormitory, for example, costs less
than a broken window on the second or
third floor. The type of glass used is
also a factor.
Setting up more rigid guidelines in
establishing responsibility for dam
ages and dealing directly with the stu
dents are seen by Hayama as other
methods of deterring damages.
Because the bill is earmarked with
a student code, the residential educa
tion office will ideally prepare an esti
mate of the cost to repair the damage
and issue the student or living resi
dence an intent to bill form.
"That's the time students and living
groups should explain any extenuating

circumstances." said Hayama.
"Unless it's an item on order, we
will not be charging students for re
placement or repairs until the items
are replaced or repaired." she said.
Hayama is also dealing with the
question of unclaimed damages. The
University absorbs the cost of uniden
tified vandalism.
Spurred by student complaints.
Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson has asked two adminis
trators to evaluate the current system
of billing students for damages occur
ring in student housing.
"There have been some complaints
from the residences that people
weren't being charged in a timely
way." explained Robinson.
Timeliness is a major problem cited
by Anthropology Prof. Bill Durham,
former resident fellow at Arroyo
House.
It was not until last April that the
University began asking who was re
sponsible for a lampshade broken in
October 1979. according to Durham.
"The absence of immediate feed
back gives people the wrong message.
It's unfair to come back six months
later waving a bill," said Durham.
"By that time, who can remember
what actually happened?"
