# Global 2000 raises concern over future population, land use
## Group keeps close watch on presidential candidates' views

It is an incongruous sight, conspicuous in the
midst of all the shops along University Avenue in
Palo Alto; Next to Swensen's Ice Cream Parlor, a
few doors down from a barber shop and a Chinese
restaurant, the storefront sports a large banner
across the top of the window: "When will the can
didates discuss the REAL issues?"
Below the sign hang poster-size pictures of the
major presidential candidates.
What is this store trying to sell? Well, the
future. But it's not a store.
"Global 2000: the Challenge to Change" is the
name of an organization formed here to inject
"the crucial issues" into the 1980 presidential
campaign, according to Rick Roney, executive
director.
The group takes its name from the Global 2000
Report to the President, a three-year study by
some 13 government agencies under the direction
of the State Dept. and the Council on Environ
mental Quality.
The report, released this summer, paints a
gloomy picture of the world in 20 years if current
population and land use patterns continue. The
trends reflected in the study "suggest strongly a
progressive degradation and impoverishment of

the earth's natural resource base," according to
the report's conclusion.
The conclusion also calls for more conserva
tion and more efficent use of resources on a
world-wide basis.
What the report has to do with a rented
storefront in Palo Alto is this: the Global 2000
group here is apparently the only such organiza
tion in the country expressly formed to raise and
address issues rather than endorse candidates. It
is, in fact, strictly non-partisan, spokespersons
say.
It is a completely volunteer effort, made up of
approximately 30 full-time workers and at least
as many who work part-time. Many of those in
the group have taken a month or two off from
work to coordinate the effort, according to ex
ecutive director Roney, who has done so himself.
The office was opened the day after Labor Day,
with funding for supplies and rental expenses
coming in the form of a grant from the Creative
Initiative Foundation, a Palo Alto-based or
ganization active in environmental affairs. Or
ganizers would not say how much funding has
been provided.
Since that time, Global 2000 has concentrated
on formulating press releases and position pa

pers. as well as on trailing all of the leading presi
dential candidates when they have been in the
area to ask their positions on issues raised in the
study.
Just what will happen to Global 2000 after the
November election is not clear, although Roney
said he expected funding to cease and the group
to disband.
How successful has the group been in getting
the candidates to talk about these global issues?
President Jimmy Carter mentioned the report in
a campaign stop in San Jose in September, and
Congressman John Anderson discussed the re
port in an interview with a San Francisco radio
station, saying that "if we do not take action on
the issues from that report they will come over us
like a tidal wave."
Gov. Ronald Reagan said at the end of Septem
ber that he had only read "highlights" of the re
port and was not prepared to respond to the is
sues at that time. He did promise to read the re
port in the future.
Specifically, the Global 2000 study portrays a
world population of 6.4 billion, serious erosion of
soil with barely sufficent amounts of food and
half-destroyed forests in the year 2000 if present
trends continue.
