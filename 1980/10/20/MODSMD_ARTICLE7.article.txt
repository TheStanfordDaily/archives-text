## Professors comment on future Turkish military keeps control 
### Cary Rosenzweig 
Reacting to an increasingly
desperate situation over four
weeks ago. Turkey's National
Security Council-a group of five
generals-replaced the govern
ment of Prime Minister Sul
eyman Demirel.
The new head of state. Gen
Kenan Evren. immediately held
Demirel. opposition leader
Bulent Ecevit, and more than 50
members of parliament in "pro
tective custody."
It was the third time in 20
years that the Turkish military
intervened to overthrow a dem
ocratically elected government
in Ankara.
The generals said the coup
was a direct result of the former
government's inability to deal
with Turkey's crippled economy
and raging political violence.
Terrorism increasing
Turks are experiencing a 20
percent unemployment rate and
an inflation rate of 120 percent.
This year, terrorists from both
the extreme right and left have
killed more than 2000 persons.
The generals had repeatedly
called on the leading politicians
to submerge their differences in
order to combat the country's

problems. Because of the par
liamentary paralysis and
ominous warnings from the mil
itary. the coup was "no sur
prise" to anyone, said Political
Science Prof. Robert Keohane
Economically based revolt
"Turkey was in the midst of a
revolution primarily because of
economics." noted History
Prof. Wayne Vucinich.
Until 1973, the Turkish econo
my was stable, based on cheap
oil from OPEC countries, tech
nology and loans from the Unit
ed States and Europe, and the
employment of surplus Turkish
workers in countries of the Eu
ropean Economic Community.
When OPEC raised oil prices,
Turkey suffered increases in
both inflation and unemploy
ment.
The Turkish economy began a
downward spin. Over 90 percent
of Turkish workers in Europe
returned home, many of them
bringing "extremist political
views associated with European
socialist and communist move
ments." according to Vucinich.
"The new skills and knowl
edge gained through work in Eu
rope are not regarded in Tur
key. The country is too poor."
Vucinich continued.
Poverty coupled with the
"radicalizing influences" of
communist organizations leads
many people to become bitter
and join extremist organiza
tions within Turkev. he said.

"The economic situation will
get worse before it gets better,"
according to Peter Duignan,
senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
The main economic hurdle
the Turkish leaders must over
come is the government itself,
he said.
'They need to free up the
economy. Virtually all of the
Turkish industry is owned or
controlled bv the big, inefficient
bureaucracy of government
This is a problem common
throughout the Middle East,"
Duignan said.
Turkey maintains the largest
standing army in the North At
lantic Treaty Organization and
is a vital component of that or
ganization. The United States
monitors the Soviet Union, Iran,
and the eastern Mediterranean
from its bases in Turkey.
Keohane predicts that in re
turn for the junta's commit
ments to the West, the United
States and Western Europe will
negotiate more loans for Tur
key. These will keep Turkey
reasonably solvent, he said.
Military value
Vucinich agrees that the
Turks "are unable to milk us ec
onomically because they are so
militarily valuable to us."
"Unless Turkey receives fi
nancial help in a substantial
way and basic economic re
forms are implemented, the
countrv will never be stable or

free of divisive forces." he said.
The United States currently
gives Turkey $400 million in aid
each year.
The generals have vowed to
turn over the reigns of power to
civilians as soon as possible.
The military appears firm in its
commitment to secular de
mocracy. but Turkey's real
needs--revitalization of the
economy and supression of ter
rorism-may be difficult to
achieve.
The first military takeover in
1960 lasted 17 months. The sec
ond coup in 1970 lasted 30
months before civilian rule was
return.
Duignan predicted that it will
be at least one year before poli
ticians are allowed to run the
country again.
Despite a rise in Islamic
fervor in Turkey. Duignan said
that there is little likelihood of
an Iran-style Islamic revolt be
cause Turkey has been secular
for too long.
The secular government of
Turkey was started in 1923 un
der the leadership of Kemal
Ataturk. With the military now
in firm control of the country.
Duignan said he though the
chances of a communist-led rev
olution were remote.
"Keeping our hands off" is
the best course of action for the
United States, according to
Alexander Dallin. professor of
history and political science.
