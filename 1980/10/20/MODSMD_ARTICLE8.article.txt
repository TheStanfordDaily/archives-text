# PLO fears negative impact of war
## 
### Washington Post 
Damascus, Syria â€” Leaders of the
Palestine Liberation Organization are vis
ibly worried about the negative impact the
Iraqi-Iranian war is having on their own
struggle just at a time when they saw it
making giant strides in gaining interna
tional recoginition. particularly in Western
Europe.
The war. they feel, has eclipsed their own
cause as the central issue in Middle East
politics and is serving to weaken Arab and
newly won Iranian support for the Palesti
nians as the Persian Gulf conflict forces
into the open new regional divisions and ri
valries among their allies.
Worse yet. they see their two main ene
mies. Israel and the United States, taking
full advantage of the situation to improve
their own respective military positions in
the region to the detriment of the Arab and
Palestinian cause, with the Israelis very
possibly using the war as a cover to launch a
new and far wider offensive against their
strongholds in southern Lebanon.
"We don't like this war.'' said Khalid
Fahoum. the highly articulate chairman of
the Palestinian National Council, the PLO
legislative body."We think it is very un
fortunate. and we are doing our best to get a
cease-fire as soon as possible"
"It has diverted attention (from our
struggle) and if it continues. I am sure it
will weaken us." he said, adding. "Un
fortunately. I think it will continue.
"We try to draw the attention of the in
ternational community to our cause and
such a war between Iran and Iraq does not
serve our interests." he remarked sullenly.
Attempted mediation
That the Palestinians immediately recog
nized the potential threat of the war to their
struggle was dramatically underlined by
PLO leader Yaser Arafat's early attempt to
mediate between the two warring coun
tries. His bid not only failed, however, but

boomeranged on him as he found himself
obliged to reject the entreaties of both
parties for his open support to their common
anger.
Subsequently, reports from Tehran said
the Iranian government had virtually halted
its propaganda camapaign in the media on
behalf of the Palestinians as anti-Arab sen
timent engulfed Iranians in the midst of
their struggle to beat back the invading
Iraqi forces.
The Palestinians are desperately trying
to refocus world attention on their own
struggle, most particuarly right now in Leb
anon. where Christian-Arab rivalries
threaten to explode into an open confronta
tion between PLO supporters and oppo
nents. and the Israelis are taking advantage
of the confusion to create a Christian buffer
zone in the south.
'Wild aggression'
The two PLO officials here echoed the
cries of alarm coming from Arafat in Beirut
that Israel is preparing a "wide ag
gression'' against the Palestinians in south
ern Lebanon in the shadow of the Iranian-
Iraqi war.
They said a buildup in Israeli heavy weap
onry and troops was under way now inside
the swath of border territory controlled by
the maverick Lebanese Christian leader,
Maj. Saad Haddad. who has declared the
area "Free Lebanon.''
Palestinian intelligence. Abu Meizer said
reading from reports he had received from
Beirut, had sighted 120 Israeli armored ve
hicles. three batteries of long-range artil
lery and three battalions of Israeli comman
dos moving recently into Haddad's territo
ry. There was no independent confirmation
of these reports available here.
In Lebanon, we have to expect anything
from the Israelis." said Fahoum. "They
will take advantage of the war and the U.S.
elections to do something. It is a source of
worry to us."

The Israelis last staged a major incursion
into southern Lebanon in late August, using
fir power, artillery and an estimated 500 to
tiOO commandos to storm Palestinian guer
rilla positions in and around Beaufort Castle
near the Litani River. They failed, however,
to dislodge them.
While the Palestinians see Israel using
the Iraqi-Iranian war as a cover for their
next offensive into southern Lebanon, they
view Washington working just as calcu
latingly now to expand its military presence
throughout this region.
"The United States is trying to benefit
from this war for its interests in the area,
which do not reflect those of the Arab or the
American people." said Abu Mezier. "It is
not dealing with the region with clean
hands. ... It is not a wise policy and will af
fect the possibility for a just peace."
The only "bright" spot the Palestinians
see on an otherwise gloomy war-ravaged
Middle East political landscape is the re
cent Soviet-Syrian treaty of friendship and
cooperation promising a greater Soviet mil
itary involvement in their struggle.
"We consider the increased Soviet pres
ence to be good for us because it is a coun
terweight to balance the increased Ameri
can presence which is against us. gives us
nothing and supports Israel," said Fahoum.
who has a daughter studying at Georgetown
University and spent several years in Wash
ington in the late 1950s as an Arab diplomat.
Beneath this bravado, however, it does
not seem the Palestinians really expect the
expanded Soviet involvement to produce the
"just peace" they are calling for or to
eliminate the "false peace" born of the
Camp David accords.
Their hopes appear to be pinned rather on
some kind of new initiative coming from
Western Europe later this year, even though
they have nagging doubts barely beneath
the surface that anything serious will really
materialize.
