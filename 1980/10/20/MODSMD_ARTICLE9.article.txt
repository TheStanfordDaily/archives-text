# Burma rebuilding temples
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Pagan, Burma — Five years after it was rocked
by an earthquake and 900 years after it witnessed
the golden age of the Burmese empire. Pagan re
mains one of Asia's greatest monuments to the
past and perhaps its least-known tourist attrac
tion.
A forest of 5000 pagodas and temples lying on a
bend of the Irrawadv River in Burma's dry and
dustry central plain, the 16-acre ruins of Pagan
are. as one observer put it. "like a giant stage
deserted by the players."
Other Asian historical sites are far better
known — among them Cambodia's Angkor, which
is legendary for its temple ruins, but with Cam
bodia ravaged by war and revolution, almost all
visitors are barred, and the jungle threatens to
swallow up the ruins of Angkor as it did centuries
ago.
Indonesia's squat, hulking Borobudur. reported
to be the largest Buddhist temple in the world, is
being restored stone by stone in a project that
seems to go on forever. It nonetheless draws
thousands of visitors.
Self-imposed isolation
Owing to Burma's self-imposed isolation and its
stubborn refusal to make more than nominal con
cessions to tourists, Pagan — which is situated
about 100 miles southwest, of Mandalay — remains
largely unknown and.in consequence, is largely
unseen.
"I still get letters from people who think Pagan
was wiped out by the 1975 earthquake." Bo Kay,
curator of the Pagan museum, complained good
naturedly. "The newspapers do exaggerate
things. As vou can see. we weren't wiped out at
all."
Perhaps 300 pagodas or temples were damaged
and 50 or so have been repaired. Some of the

smaller shrines were not considered worthy of re
pairs. and since Burma is chronically short of
money, a decision was made to concentrate on
those monuments considered worthy of the ex
pense.
Temples restored
Happily, the magnificent Ananda temple, white
with its golden spire, has been restored to original
condition. Considered a masterpiece of Buddhist
architecture, the temple has been given a new cap
for its bell-shaped spire. The old one fell to the
ground when the earthquake hit.
Other temples have been similarly repaired.
But the Ananda temple remains the architectural
favorite of most visitors and of the Burmese as
well. The Schwezigon. which is better known and
most venerated because it is supposed to contain a
replica of Buddha's tooth, is considered im
pressive but not very imaginative.
A philosophical man. Bo Kay is undisturbed by
the possibility that Pagan's magnificent ruins
may one day be leveled bv another earthquake.
Located on fault
Pagan, he explained, lies astride an earthquake
fault that runs all the way from Assam, in north
eastern India, to the Andaman Islands and
Sumatra.
"Actually, we lost only one pagoda to the '75
earthquake." Bo Kay said.
The ruins of Pagan are all that is left of one of
the greatest religious sprees in history, lasting
about 20()0 years. Nearly 1000 years ago, Bud
dhism and its disciples so dominated Burma that
rich men and poor, kings and commoners com
peted to "make merit"by building temples deco
rated with precious stones, splendid murals and
intricate carvings and housing countless Buddha
images.

"Actually, we lost only one pagoda to the '75
earthquake." Bo Kay said.
The ruins of Pagan are all that is left of one of
the greatest religious sprees in history, lasting
about 20()0 years. Nearly 1000 years ago, Bud
dhism and its disciples so dominated Burma that
rich men and poor, kings and commoners com
peted to "make merit"by building temples deco
rated with precious stones, splendid murals and
intricate carvings and housing countless Buddha
images.
