# Chinese aid anti-communists
## Guerrillas gaining support in Laos 
### Washington Post 
Bangkok, Thailand — Am
bushing vehicles on isolated
roads and preaching revolt in
rural communities, bands of
right-wing guerrillas are caus
ing serious concern for the Com
munist government of Laos,
which took power five years ago
with military backing from Ha
noi.
Diplomats here believe China
is cautiously channeling aid to
some insurgent groups as part
of its larger dispute with Viet
nam. Hanoi keeps about 40.000
troops in Laos. Western

analysts say, many of them tied
down by internal security duty.
Faction-ridden, poorly dis
ciplined and probably number
ing only a few thousand, the
rightist guerrillas do not cur
rently threaten the govern
ment's stability. But their ties
with China raise the potential
for an escalating conflict in the
future.
China opposes Hanoi
With Chinese weapons also
flowing to Khmer Rouge and
Khmer Serei forces fighting the
Vietnamese in Cambodia, and
probably to anti-communist
Montagnard insurgents in Viet
nam's Central Highlands as
well, Beijing appears to be
nurturing in all three countries
of Indochina a front against
domination by Hanoi.
Many Laotian resistance
fighters are veterans of Ameri
can-equipped armies that were
disbanded in 1975. For two dec
ades. parallel to its intervention
in Vietnam, the United States
attempted unsuccessfully to
block a takeover by Laos' pro-
Vietnamese Communists, the
Pathet Lao.
In southern Laos, the guer
rillas have operated in small
mobile groups since 1975. Many
have shoulder-length hair, hav
ing taken vows not to cut it until
victory is achieved. Weapons
are a mixture of U.S. and com
munist issue, with ammunition
always in short supply.
Diplomatic sources report an
upsurge in attacks since August
along Route 9 leading west from

Vietnam. Guerrillas fire on con
voys and isolated outposts and
disappear into the jungles. Two
years ago, they almost killed a
senior Pathet Lao general,
blowing up the vehicle ahead of
the one he was riding.
Communists poorly received
Rightist units appear able to
move freely in some rural areas
of the south, where the com
munist government has been
poorly received by villagers.
(Nearly one in 10 of Laos' 3 mil
lion people has become a refu
gee since 1975.)
"Our political program is
very simple," says a resistance
spokesman. "We want to re
store Laos as a neutral coun
try." This anti-Vietnamese bent
has wide appeal all over Laos,
guerrillas claim. Terrorism is
probably directed against those
who do not accept it. however.
In northern Laos, remnants of
the Central Intelligence Agen
cy's "secret army" of
tribespeople continue to resist
Pathet Lao control in scattered
areas. Taking to the jungle with
their families, they have been
subject to repeated artillery and
air attacks since 1975.

serious vomiting, diarrhea and

In both the north and south,
the guerrillas cross the Thai

border frequently to enter refu

Laotians currently live.
Weary soldiers rest up and
collect supplies for transport
back to Laos. New guerrillas
