# Coping with complexion problems
## Discussion group helps 
### Lisa Hudson 
"Life is too short for people to be unhappy,"
says Andee Treinis. founder of a support group on
campus for people with complexion problems.
The group, limited to 10, will provide an op
portunity for people to discuss their feelings and
problems with others who have been through the
same experience in a supportive atmosphere. In
this way, the main objective of the group, "to de
velop a healthy mental attitude about physical
problems" will be met, according to Treinis.
People need to realize "there's more to you
than just a face," stresses Treinis. Often she says,
acne patients spend so much time worrying about
their complexions that they "have probably failed
to notice their other inner and outer qualities."
Those in the support group will offer each mem
ber some perspective on his problem and will
point out talents and qualities he may have over
looked. "We hope to get to a point where we can
tell a guy what a great personality he has." says
Treinis.
The group members will meet once a week to
air their feelings and share thoughts. Treinis
hopes the personal interaction will result in close
friendships among the group She explains that
this is necessary for members to be uninhibited in
their discussions, to derive maximum benefit
from the group, and to lend support to others.
The group plans to bring in guest speakers on an
informal level, so the speakers can relate to and
get feedback from the group, rather than just ad
dress them. Treinis emphasizes.
These will include a local dermatologist, Dr.
Tom Hoffman, who will talk about medications
and treatments, both internal and external. Ac
cording to Hoffman, "Acne can be easily con
trolled in about 85 percent of the cases. "
Also, a psybhologist will help develop self
esteem because. "Often people get medical care
for the skin but not much time is spent on the emo
tional impact." says Treinis. As a follow-up. a
cosmetologist may visit to discuss plastic surgery

and dermabrasion as a way to remove scars left
by acne.
Emotional stress is one of the biggest causes of
acne, according to Hoffman, who explains that
acne is often at its worst during exam times and
periods of personal crisis.
The group may bring in a hypnotist to examine
ways of relieving stress through deep muscle re
laxation and hypnosis, so members can learn to
recognize and deal with their periods of emotional
stress. "Methods of stress reduction help the heal
ing process," according to Hoffman.
Positive self-image is another area the group
will focus on. As Treinis explains: "I know what
an effort it (acne) can have on a person's emo
tional stability and mental strength." She gave
advice from practical experience, saying, "You
have to develop a mental picture of what you
would be like if you could change yourself, and be
lieve that's what you really are." She says this
provides a goal to work toward, so acne patients
are not always concentrating on how they are in
the present state.
The genre of the support group is a new one,
having developed in the last few years as an an
swer for those who need more help than they can
give themselves, but aren't ready to see a doctor.
The group is the first of its kind at Stanford, and
has already received enthusiastic support from
members and potential guest speakers.
UCLA began a program in 1977 run by volunteer
peer counselors through the student health ser
vice that emphasizes self-help. Another program
is at the University of Maryland.
Those affected by acne are of all ages, with
most being in their early 20s, and equal numbers
of both sexes. Hoffman explained that though
males tend to get worse acne, females are more
sensitive to its implications.
The Stanford group meets Wednesday evenings
at 7:15 in Room 263 of Tresidder Union. Those in
terested in attending should first call the Bridge.
