# Absolute standard called cause of Mideast conflict
## 
### Fran Miller Gall Greenberg 
Describing his city as one in
which two groups of people vie
for exclusive control, thereby
making compromise im
possible, Meron Benveniste,
deputy mayor of Jerusalem
from 1974 to 1978. addressed an

audience of approximately 75
last Wednesday in the history
building
In his lecture entitled Jeru
salem A Torn City ' Benveniste
said that in trying to resolve the
conflict between Arabs and Is
raelis, a third intervening party
can't do what the peoples of the
city must do themselves
Americans always assume
there's a solution to every prob
lem." said Benveniste Since
1917, I've counted 45 excellent
plans for the solution to this
problem." Because of the
"absolute standards" of both
sides, however. Benveniste said
that there may be no mutually
acceptable solution
According to the former
mayor, who also served as ad
ministrator of East Jerusalem
in 1967, today's conflict is politi
cal. not religious, and the ques
tion is over national sovereign
ty-
"Equal opportunities will not
solve the problem." he said. Un
like in America, where each
group accepts the general poli
cy. but wants a "larger slice of
the pie," in Israel people are
"not fighting for a bigger slice
of the pie but the right to make
our own."
The Arabs, according to Ben
veniste. are unwilling to nego
tiate on the same grounds as the
Israelis. To discuss the conflict
based on Israel's present politi
cal framework would be, for the
Arabs, to legitimize the state as

it exists, an act which is in
consistent with Arab beliefs
For the same reason, although
one-third of the city's employ
ees are Arabs, they do not hold
any offices of political power
Benveniste said that while the
Arabs will only agree to deal
with the non-political aspects of
the situation, the Israelis see
politics as the first and foremost
topic of concern
Benveniste's advice was to
accept the reality of the situ
ation and not to work for objec
tives that are impossible to
achieve. The conflict is il
logical." he said, "so bringing
logic to the game will solve
nothing.
The important thing for peace
seekers to do is to downplay Je
rusalem. said Benveniste. He
said the conflict within the city
must not be used as an excuse
for reaching an impasse in a
permanent Middle East peace
settlement. Jerusalem should
be the last item on the agenda,
he said.
Benveniste stated that de
spite the differences between
Jerusalem's inhabitants, they
are all in favor of the physical
unity of the city. He compared
the state of Israel to a patient
who. too weak for a major oper
ation. must opt for a cure by al
leviating symptoms.
There is a price tag attached
to peace in Israel, said Ben
veniste. and the Israelis will
have to determine that price.
