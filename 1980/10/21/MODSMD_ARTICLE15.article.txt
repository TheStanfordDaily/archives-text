## It doesn't go far enough 
### 
Almost a year and a half after the Supreme
Court issued its landmark decision in
Zurcher v. Stanford Daily. Congress has
passed a bill which will restore some of the
constitutional protections Americans lost in
this May 1978 decision.
By approving the Privacy Protection Act
of 1980. Congress has taken steps to prevent
law enforcement officials from harassing
journalists, writers and academics and pre
venting the public from receiving informa
tion The law distinguishes between journal
ists doing their jobs and anyone committing a
criminal act. The law also provides that per
sons whose rights are violated can sue and re
cover damages and attorney's fees.
The only problem with the bill is that it
does not go far enough Doctors, lawyers,
psychotherapists, clergy and other citizens
are still fair game for police and prosecutors
— even though they are not criminal suspects
and may have only had a business dealing
with a criminal suspect. The fact that there is
no prohibition of such searches is particular
ly appalling since lawyers, doctors and cler
gy are protected from revealing in court
what police can discover through a surprise
raid with a search warrant.
In addition, only federal officials are bound
to follow the forthcoming attorney general
guidelines, which are to provide penalties for

those who wrongfully search innocent third
parties. State and local officials are not held
to the same restrictions.
Since the Supreme Court said that it
couldn't find anything in the Constitution to
prohibit these types of police raids, police in
Minnesota. Texas. Oregon. California. Mich
igan. Idaho. Hawaii, and Georgia have
searched lawvers, doctors and journalists 12
times Though some states have passed laws
to protect journalists, only Wisconsin has
passed a law to protect all non-suspects as a
response to the Stanford Daily decision This
makes it imperative that the next Congress
reconsider this problem and pass the legisla
tion necessary to make Americans secure in
their homes and businesses from un
reasonable searches.
People should remember that the police
chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, and judges who
are responsible for these searches are either
elected officials or appointed by elected of
ficials. When journalists are wrongfully
searched in the future, it will usually be the
taxpayer who pays the resulting court fees,
and not the errant public official Thus it is up
to the voters to make sure that those law en
forcement officials who show contempt for
the right of privacy and the law are not re
turned to office.
