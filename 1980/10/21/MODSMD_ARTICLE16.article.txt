## Consumer ethic root of problem 
### 
Pollution of water and air. and the de
spoilation of land. These are the issues that
most concern those dubbed "environmen
talists." While it is critical that the problem
of pollution be solved, many of the solutions
prescribed by environmental policy-makers
amount onlv to a treatment of symptoms
rather than a direct confrontation of the
causes. It is the consumer ethic of our in
dustrial society that is at the root of our en
vironmental problems.
The essence of industrial society might be
captured in a single principle: The con
version of natural resources into "useful"
goods In a society like our own. where ma
terialistic (as opposed to spirituali values
prevail, almost anything that can be bought
or sold becomes "useful." Consequently,
our industries produce a vast array of
goods, consume an equally vast quantity of
resources, and spew forth billions of tons of
waste and pollutants. This condition is a
challenge to the integrity of the world's re
source base. Unfortunately, there are other
forces operating which exacerbate the prob
lem.
The most virulent of these forces is the
concept of a constantly expanding economy.

The tremendous growth in production and
consumption that has occurred in Europe
and North America in the past century is a
tribute to industrial technology, the key
stone of this era of prosperity. While many
claim that industrial growth can lead to
further prosperity, many others fear that
the current rate of growth will outstrip the
earth's capacity to regenerate vital re
sources. Regardless, it is clear that re
sources are finite, and that the limits to
growth, if not reached, are being ap
proached Only a short-term outlook on the
future can rationalize the validity of the
"growth equals prosperity" formula.
Another condition contributing to the
coming resource crisis is the development
of the Third World in a way that holds
"modern industrial society" as a model.
The existing burden on the resource base is
dangerously taxing, even though only one
third of the world's population lives in socie
ties with fully developed economies. It must
be recognized that there simply are not
enough resources to afford every person on
the planet with a standard of living that is
near ours. Given this condition, the
"modern industrial society" model be

comes a fantasy It would be much more re
alistic to adopt development policies that
are designed to create a sustainable,
steady-state economy.
Likewise, industrial societies must make
the transition to the steady-state as condi
tions of resource scarcity approach. The so
cial change entailed in such a transition is so
far-reaching that one is compelled to be
skeptical of its potential: yet, it is essential
if mankind is ever to be in balance with its
environment
Solutions to "environmental" problems
exist on two distinct levels — the policies
and technological fixes which are designed
to deal with the immediate problems of pol
lution and long-term social change aimed at
curing the causes of the resource crisis.
Thus, environmental issues are inex
tricably entwined with economic, political
and social issues which are often considered
separately. Any rational approach to the
solution of environmental problems must
therefore include a broad consideration of
the human condition.
