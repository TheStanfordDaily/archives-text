The safety factor
Toxic Shock Syndrome. The
results of this country's ad
vanced technology are not very
comforting. Why must our most
useful products be accompanied
by great risk? Is there any long
er a product which can be called
safe?
I have learned to accept the
fact that our society, in general,
and industry, in particular, wor
ship profits. New products are
judged according to their mar
ket potential rather than their
degree of safety. The recent
furor over tampons and toxic
shock syndrome is an example
of this type of warped thinking.
Must women die for the com
fort of using tampons 9 How can
tampon manufacturers even at
tempt to justify their use of dan
gerous chemicals to extend the
time of a woman's menstrual
period? They want this time ex
tended, of course, so that they
can increase their sales.
It cannot be denied that wom
en have to be careful in their use
of tampons. But why should it be
that they have to approach the
problem with one hand tied be

hind their collective backs? I do
not believe that Proctor and
Gamble, the makers of Rely
tampons, is guilty of "murder
and attempted murder of wom
en" (Daily, Oct. 13), but I do be
lieve that tampons could be pro
duced much more safely if the
manufacturers were willing to
spend the time and the money to
do so.
Toxic shock syndrome is not a
minor problem. We should not
ignore it simply because women
are not dying in epidemic pro
portions. it is time that the tam
pon industry took the safety fac
tor into account during prod
uction and either improved the
product or removed it from the
market.

Similar stories
As someone who reads both
the Daily and Campus Report, I
have recently noticed an uncan
ny similarity between the con
tent of the two papers. This was
particularly true of last Fri

dav's issue, where three of the
front page stories were essen
tially rewrites, with minor
changes in sentence structure
and paragraph order, of stories
from the October 15 issue of
Campus Report.
This raises two issues. First,
unless the authors of the Daily
stories ("Plan to modernize
hospital approved" and "Hospi
tal governance to be changed";
"Humanities center to combine
strengths") were also the au
thors of the original (unsigned)
Campus Report stories, isn't
the Daily encouraging
plagarism 0
Second, doesn't the Daily
have anything to print other
than press releases from the
University News Service? Is
there no need for investigative
or just plain independent report
ing on the campus, its prospects
and problems?
Aren't your readers at least
entitled to know whether stories
originate with a source other
than your reporting staff? The
editors of Campus Report are
expected (and paid) to report all
Stanford news in the most favor
able light possible — presum
ably the editors of the Daily
aren't.

Name melange
I read with great interest the
column written by Susan Hajda
(Daily, Oct. 17). Having re
turned recently from a year in
Europe. I was interested to read
in the column that Simone Weil
had changed her name to Si
mone Viel. I was astounded to
read that she had apparently un
dergone extensive surgery and
become a man. One would think
"he" would have changed his
first name to Simon, the male
version of this name in French.

Lucky this time
I was appalled to witness an
incident last Saturday that I
found totally disgusting, poten
tially very dangerous, and
teamed with inconsideration
and inappropriateness. All of
this easily could have and
should have been avoided. And
yes. this took place right here on
Stanford's campus.
I was a spectator at the Stan
ford Invitational cross-country
meet that took place on the Stan
ford golf course on Saturday,
October 11. This event had been
scheduled since last spring.
With 300 women runners and 300
men runners, and 100 to 200 addi
tional spectators, one can easily
see that there were a few extra
people on the Stanford golf
course that day.
These people had been invited
by the Athletic Department to
Stanford's campus to compete
in a prestigious athletic event.
Stanford should have provided
an environment of safety. It was
my understanding that the front
nine of the golf course was to
have been closed for two hours.
However, for some unknown
reason, the front nine was not
closed. And yes, golfers played
right through the crowd with lit
tle attention to the 800 or so ex
tra people.
Not only was the cross-coun
try meet delayed because of
several golfers teeing off as the
crowd patiently watched; but,
another golfer almost insisted
on hitting into a group of
runners as they were nearing
the finish line. A minor alter
cation between golfer and track
officials took place. This could
be quite disconcerting to the
runners and spectators — not to
mention a tremendous law suit
that could result, and a bad taste
of public relations.
I have to assume that Andy
Geiger must be involved in the
ultimate decision of keeping the
course open. This isn't the first
time that Geiger has given in to
big bucks. If the golfers are so
important and so influential,
then, I propose for the safety of
us others, don't hold the cross
country meet. Just tell all of
those involved that Stanford
would rather have five to eight
groups of golfers play the front
nine than hold this prestigious
event annually.
I enjoyed the cross-country
meet, as did everyone else —
this year. Next year someone
might not be so lucky.
