## Physics 50 is as good as Western Culture 
### 
As a member of the last class
to elude Stanford's reinstituted
Western Culture requirement. 1
oppose the administration's
new dictum Though I at first
hesitated to assert my "un
cultivated'' criticism, upon re
alizing that my own experience
is being phased out. 1 now feel
my message may have some
fleeting merit. As the last of the
non-systematically cultured
sophomores." only I can speak
with perfect authority on behalf
of ignorance.
1 have heard many arguments
for the Western Culture requir
ment so why am 1 not con
vinced'.' Am i being obtuse due
to a scanty liberal background,
or as I contend, is it just some
thing everyone has to decide for
themselves? It seems the
academic administration at one
point shared my view, so what
I'd like to know is what new
evidence has come to light in the
last few years to make them re
consider their previous resolu
tion and revert back to the clas-

SICS. \
Has there been an increasing
ly unsophisticated character to
recent alumni or was it just the
overall intellectual ambiance of
the campus they sensed de
generating Have Stanford
grads. since revoking the re
quirement, been notably less en
lightened and if so, are they sure
that reinstating Western Cul
ture can counter this trend''
It's not that I am skeptical of
the value of gaining a broad
education and recognizing in
sights beyond one's own realm
of existence I only question how
intricately related critical
thinking and the classics are.
Sure, the traditionally great
writers can provide great vehi
cles for critical insights and I
commend the University for
providing the Western Culture
program for all aspiring in
tellectuals. But 1 don't feel that
any specific program can ex
clusively provide a degree of
"required'" enlightenment.
Rather. I feel that every indi
vidual's experience must be
their own (but not only), in
tellectual resource. To us engi
neers. for example. Physics 55
can be very illuminating. The
pitfalls and limitations of our
narrow human perception are
never more apparent than when
trying to digest stuff like en
tropy. relativity and black
holes. The natural sciences can
provide fantastic insights into
the human condition, and

though not exactly of the type
provided by a literary back
ground, why specifically re
quire one and not the other?
Frankly. I think the Physics
50 series would make as good a
requirement as Western Cul
ture by giving everyone a fun
damental background in the
technology that has shaped our
society this century and prom
ises to so determine the human
condition in the future Besides,
1 say anyone who can deal with
Kmc-' can certainly handle "A is
A"; I mean, that's basic alge
bra
Also. I suspect that such a re
quirement might significantly
reduce Stanford's problem with
inflated CPA's that some au
thorities have been complaining
about lately.
Regarding the speech in de
fense of Western Culture given
bv Professor Nannerl Keohane
during freshman orientation, I
found her plea for critical eval
uation of early thinkers a lot
more convincing than the argu
ment for submitting to the re
quirement. She did an especial
ly good job of designating the
stereotyped roles of women in
literature.
I could easily relate to her
argument because never having
considered myself an 1 > house
hold functionary, 2) mysterious
token of virtue, or 3) sexual
plaything (the three roles
within which Keohane contends

most literary and historical ac
counts of women are confined i.
1 have no trouble being critical
of such stereotypes This only
means that if 1 want to gain in
sights into women's thoughts
beyond those limited views 1
will have to resort to real life
anyway.
i really don't mean to dis
parage a classically liberal
education any more than is
absolutely necessary to make
my point that it is not absolutely
necessary. I even concede that
making Western Culture a re
quirement will undoubtedly
save many latent great intellec
tuals from underestimating the
importance of such a thought
provoking background on their
whole lives and thus unknowing
ly suffering for their ignorance
On the other hand, as most of
the educators involved in the de
cision process believe strongly
enough in the value of a liberal
education to make it their life's
work, one might argue that they
could be a bit slanted in favor of
the fuzz
Of course I don't expect to
make it all the way through
Stanford without the benefit of a
few social sciences and human
ities courses, and I'm sure I'll
gain much by them. But in my
life, I'll wager, it will be the en
gineering courses I take here
that will actually be the most
enriching.
