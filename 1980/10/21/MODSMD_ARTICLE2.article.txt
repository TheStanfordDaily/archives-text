# Because divorced mother cohabits
## High court denies childcustody 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” The Supreme Court
voted six to three yesterday to let
stand an Illinois court decision strip
ping a woman of the custody of her
three daughters because she was liv
ing with a man to whom she was not
married.
The action means that the children
will be taken away from the divorced
mother and put in the care of their
father. The Illinois court held that by
allowing her lover to live with her
and her family, the woman had vio
lated the state's fornication law and
had offended "prevailing public poli
cy"
In dissent. Justice William Bren
nan wrote that the Supreme Court
should have reviewed the case be

cause it raises issues with important
implications for many American
households. He also said that he be
lieved that the lower court's ruling
conflicted squarely with a prior Su
preme Court decision.
"Nothing in the (court) record or
in logic supports a conclusion that
divorced parents who fornicate, for
that reason alone, are unfit or ad
versely affect the well-being and de
velopment of their children in any
degree over and above whatever ad
verse effect separation and divorce
may already have had on the chil
dren." Brennan wrote.
Justice Thurgood Marshall signed
Brennan's dissent, and Justice
Harry Blackmun wrote separately
that he also believed that the court

should have heard the case. It takes
the votes of four justices for the Su
preme Court to review a lower court
decision.
The lower court decision applies
only within Illinois. The justices' re
fusal to review the case does not set
any nationwide precedent. But it
means that courts in other states are
free to follow the Illinois courts if
they choose to do so.
The custody dispute involved the
children of Jacqueline and Walter
Jarrett a Chicago couple who were
divorced in 1976. At that time, Mrs.
Jarrett was awarded custody of their
three daughters: Kathleen, then 12;
Deborah, 10; and Susan, 7.
Four months later, Mrs. Jarrett
informed her former husband that a
man named Wayne Hammon would
be moving in with her and the chil
dren.
Walter Jarrett went to court, com

plaining that his ex-wife's rela
tionship with Hammon was contrary
to his personal beliefs, and that he
did not want his children to be raised
in an atmosphere he considered im
moral He asked for custody of the
children.
