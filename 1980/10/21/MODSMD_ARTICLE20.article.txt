# THE 						STAN FORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Kenneth Peter Camelot may not be dead 
### 
Randy Broberg's recent column {Daily, Oct.
161 betrays a shocking lack of reason which un
fortunately typifies the Reagan campaign effort.
While his errors were written, I am sure, from
gross ignorance rather than from willful distor
tion, it was some time before I could believe that
the column was not planted by members of a well
known campus humor magazine. When I realized
that Broberg was serious in his remarks, I found
them too dangerous to go unchallenged.
First, Broberg frequently states "facts" that
are not. "... we sign a treaty (SALT II) that would
ban the deployment of the MX missile." After at
tending most of the SALT II hearings in Washing
ton, I found this statement ludicrous. The MX
missile was specifically designed with the SALT
II treaty in mind. In fact, without the restrictions
SALT II imposes on additional Soviet MIRVs and
delivery systems, they will have enough warheads
to target every MX silo, dummy or real, render
ing its unique features useless.
Second. Broberg equivocates the "real" facts.
"Russia invades a helpless Third World neigh
bor..." Months of guerrilla warfare rendering
Soviet gains unusable seems to constitute "help
lessness." And what would Broberg have us do?
Blockade Cuba as his mentor suggests, expanding
the war and precipitating a world crisis?
Third, he states real facts as if they were dam
aging to President Jimmy Carter, when some of
them are not. "He cuts the B-l, now he touts the
Stealth." That is correct, and both decisions' are
in the best interest of our military preparedness.
Advances in Soviet ground-to-air missiles n^ade

each $1.2 billion B-l highly vulnerable to destruc
tion by $50,000 missiles. The Stealth is designed to
be much cheaper as well as invulnerable to those
same missiles.
And so the entire article goes, sprinkled with
fallacies, riddled with innuendo, and dripping
with an offensive maudlin rhetoric. But at the root
of the problem, and what I believe caused
Broberg's "naive optimism" to "shrivel and
die," is his own vision of what "the American
Dream" that he speaks of should be. His dream
appears to be a world in which America alone can
finger the trigger of the doomsday machine. I call
that a nightmare.
"Camelot is dead" he says; "... the classic lib
eral policies of the last 25 years have failed mi
serably " Of the past 25 years we have had Re
publican presidents for 13, and few would consider
Carter a "classic liberal." Broberg's vision of the
"American Dream" has died "in the chill of an
icy arctic wind'' because his dream was chilling
to begin with. Let us not forget that Camelot, too.
was an American dream, and that it lives on in a
variety of ways. It lives on in the continuing strug
gle for equal rights for all; it lives on in the effort
to reduce poverty and hunger and in an America
at peace. While California's governor was gutting
the best educational system in America.
"Camelot was producing the financial aid pro
grams that enable me to attend Stanford. Camelot
is far from dead. It, and not Broberg's "naive op
timism." is the true "American Dream."
