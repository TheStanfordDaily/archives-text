##

"When I started this project. I never expected
to be on a stand in a Gucci store in San Francis
co," commented Peter Allen, author of Stanford:
From the Foothills to the Ray. He spoke at the
promotional reception held last Tuesday at Guc
ci's for his recently published book on the history
of Stanford.
The gala affair, which hosted approximately
300 people, began with a sidewalk rally featuring
the Leland Stanford Junior University Marching
Band and the Dollies. As television cameramen
and photographers swarmed the area, the Stan
ford Band and the Dollies stopped rush-hour traf
fic and congested Post Street while musically
saluting the launch of the book.
Allen summarized the tone of the party by
saying that the juxtaposition of the Stanford Band
outside and a string quartet inside exemplified the
pervading cosmopolitan atmosphere.
Rachmael Avram, a Gucci official, called the
reception "the most spectacular party we've had
— all human warmth and enthusiasm."
When asked to comment on the Stanford Band.
Avram said, "the band is in a class by itself, like
Gucci." He added that he is grateful to band mem
bers for making the party a Stanford event as well
as a Gucci event.
Guests at the party included Louise Davies,
benefactor of the Louise Davies Symphony Hall.
Mel Lane, publisher of Lane/Sunset Publications,
representatives from major San Francisco pub

lishing firms, local bookstore managers, mem
bers of the Stanford Alumni Executive Board,
Stanford faculty and staff, the San Francisco
Luncheon and San Francisco Women's alumni
clubs, Stanford Historical Society members, Guc
ci executives and the editorial and photographic
staff of the book.
Adalene Hoss, Gucci vice president, said of the
event, "We like to do these things to attract the
kind of people Gucci is. and to do something for
the community."
Author Allen expressed his enthusiasm by
saying. "The interest in the book by Stanford
alumni and friends is almost overwhelming. I had
no idea that so many people could feel so good
about the publication of a book."
Although Stanford: From the Foothills to the
Bay has been advertised as a $40 coffee-table
book. Avram stated that, "This is one book that is
not just going to sit on the coffee table." Auto
graphed copies were available at the reception.
Delia Van Heyst, the book's editor-in-chief and
deputy director of the Alumni Association, re
iterated that the "underlying purpose of the party
is to introduce the book to the San Francisco com
munity in an elegant, splashy, tasteful manner."
During the promotion, Stanford memorabilia
complemented Gucci handbags and jewelry in the
store display windows and cases. One prominen
tly displayed artifact was the football Herbert
Hoover purchased in 1892 for the first Stanford-
Cal game after he had forgotten to bring the regu
lation ball.
