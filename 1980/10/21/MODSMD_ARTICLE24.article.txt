# Collard: polyrhythmic polyphonic
## 
### Jim Edmondson 
The young French piano vir
tuoso Jean-Phillipe Collard
pleased a large Memorial
Auditorium audience Friday
night with a program of Ravel
and Liszt piano solo works. Col
lard displayed technical mas
tery and a mature, individual
style. Though he was not a flam
boyant performer, his in
terpretation was satisfying in
being velvety-smooth and very
secure.
The program began with

Maurice Ravel's Valses Nobles
et Sentimentales and Gaspard
de la Nuit. The former is a
series of eight short waltzes in
which the rhythm is generally
free, often consisting of 2/4 fig
ures superimposed on the 3/4
meter. The various waltzes
have quite different moods and
characters. Ravel subsequently
transcribed the piece suc
cessfully for orchestra, showing
the wide range of tonal ideas al
ready in the piano version.
Polyphonic and polyrhythmic
passages abound in the short

pieces. Collard played with
rhythmic steadiness and re
serve. always moving forward
and rarely lingering on phrases.
This same approach character
ized his performance of
Gaspard de la Nuit. This is a
three-movement work of which
the second movement is espe
cially moving, with wave-like
chord sequences flowing around
an ostinato treble note. Here
too, Ravel experiments with
polyphonies, as the chords are
superimposed on each other
rather than arranged in a
progression. Collard made espe
cially smooth transitions from
soft to loud and back again. The
quiet passages were clear and
infused with the same feeling of
steady forward motion with
which Collard played the louder
sections.
After intermission, Collard
played Franz Liszt's Consola
tions 2 and 3 and Sonata in B
minor without pause. Here he
had found his idiom, as the
phrases were beautifully
formed and well-controlled. The
Consolations form a series of
six short works, from which Col
lard chose two. In the first, his
even-tempered reading put the
parenthetical afterthoughts
that conclude many of the

phrases in good perspective,
warmly illuminating Liszt's in
genious composition. Similarly,
the second was played with re
serve and perspective.
The longest piece and real
gem of the evening was Liszt's
B-minor Sonata. Pieced togeth
er from four themes, the sonata
wanders from one to the next,
alternating between pensive
recitatives and virtuosic runs.
Collard showed mature re
straint in binding the widely
varying segments. He played
the piano sections in a relaxed
manner, carefully placing each
note in the right place within the
dark fabric. The fast and furious
parts received the same
marvelously relaxed per
formance. Collard's technique
was nothing short of awesome
as he flawlessly cascaded
through the difficult sixteenth
note phrases. Every note was
well-conceived and executed to
perfection. Collard's playing
was a happy marriage of techni
cal command of the keyboard
and relaxed, enthusiastic in
terpretation.
The program ended with two
encores. Collard can expect
much appreciative audience re
sponse in future concerts. May
he return to the Lively Arts!

The longest piece and real
gem of the evening was Liszt's
B-minor Sonata. Pieced togeth
er from four themes, the sonata
wanders from one to the next,
alternating between pensive
recitatives and virtuosic runs.
Collard showed mature re
straint in binding the widely
varying segments. He played
the piano sections in a relaxed
manner, carefully placing each
note in the right place within the
dark fabric. The fast and furious
parts received the same
marvelously relaxed per
formance. Collard's technique
was nothing short of awesome
as he flawlessly cascaded
through the difficult sixteenth
note phrases. Every note was
well-conceived and executed to
perfection. Collard's playing
was a happy marriage of techni
cal command of the keyboard
and relaxed, enthusiastic in
terpretation.
The program ended with two
encores. Collard can expect
much appreciative audience re
sponse in future concerts. May
he return to the Lively Arts!
