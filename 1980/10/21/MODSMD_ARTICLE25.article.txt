# Ghosts: mortiferous
## 
### Richard Bliss 
Because Henrik Ibsen's
Ghosts ranks among his best
plays and because the American
Conservatory Theatre can usu
ally be counted on to provide in
telligent direction and skillful
acting, it is a painful surprise to
notice how often ACT's current
production of Ghosts floats in
and out of tedium. Though it is
impossible to lay the blame for
the lack of excitement on any
one individual or aspect of the
production, a number of small
failures make for a long eve
ning.
The essential failure is one of
focus. Ibsen's complex story
revolves around the rela
tionship between a mother, her
son and the dead father who
looms over both of them. The
son was banished from the
household at an early age be
cause his father was sinking
deeper and deeper into corrup
tion which ended only with his
death. The son now shows simi
lar tastes, as if the ghost of the
father has been reborn. The
mother must choose between in
dulging the son in his every cor
rupt whim or refusing him and
possibly losing him forever. At
this level the story is affecting
and strong.
But Ibsen also fills his play
with biting attacks on the social

strictures and conventions of his
day. Religious hypocrisy and
the economic and ethical pres
sures which forced women into
loveless empty marriages were
potent dragons when Ibsen as
saulted them, but today they
seem little more than clay
pigeons. Nothing rings more
hollow than an attack on that
which no longer needs to be at
tacked It does not seem a dan
gerous and radical remark to
suggest that living together, out
of what was picturesquely de
scribed as wedlock, could possi
bly be a happy and sane way to
exist. At this point in time,
Ibsen's social criticism suffers
trom a kind of ethical planned
obsolescence.
The ACT production em
phasizes the dated quality of the
play. The director, Allen
Fletcher, allows the pious, easi
ly deceived Pastor (Dana
Elcar) to dominate our atten
tion The role seems to belong in
a comedy with its obtuseness
and silly self aggrandizing and it
lowers the whole tone of the
play. The mother, Fru Helene
Alving (Anne Lawder), depends
on understatement and control
while the other actors seem
sure that they are in a
melodrama. Fru Helene be
comes so subdued that she

seems almost anonymous
Ibsen has a reputation for
brutal honesty and social re
alism. Ghosts was denounced as
an "open sewer" when it was
first produced in England. But
realism is relative and what im
presses one today is how often
Ibsen uses euphemism and
evasions Fru Helene, we are
told, has been reading "free
thinking writers" but we never
learn more about this. The son
suffers from hereditary syphilis
but we are only told some clap
trap about the sins of the father
being passed on to the son. The
dissolution and degeneracy of
the father apparently was an in
clination to sleep with different
women and a propensity to
drink more than he should. Such
anachronisms are of course not
Ibsen's fault. He was writing for
his age, not ours, but a more
daring director might, with
some judicious editing, have
eliminated some unintentional
humor.
It is always painful to an
nounce failure of such a worth
while organization as the ACT.
However, Ghosts, for all its
greatness, remains a difficult
play and the ACT, for all its
depth of talent, has not achieved
infallibility. This is a production
that can safely be skipped

Because Henrik Ibsen's
Ghosts ranks among his best
plays and because the American
Conservatory Theatre can usu
ally be counted on to provide in
telligent direction and skillful
acting, it is a painful surprise to
notice how often ACT's current
production of Ghosts floats in
and out of tedium. Though it is
impossible to lay the blame for
the lack of excitement on any
one individual or aspect of the
production, a number of small
failures make for a long eve
ning.
The essential failure is one of
focus. Ibsen's complex story
revolves around the rela
tionship between a mother, her
son and the dead father who
looms over both of them. The
son was banished from the
household at an early age be
cause his father was sinking
deeper and deeper into corrup
tion which ended only with his
death. The son now shows simi
lar tastes, as if the ghost of the
father has been reborn. The
mother must choose between in
dulging the son in his every cor
rupt whim or refusing him and
possibly losing him forever. At
this level the story is affecting
and strong.
But Ibsen also fills his play
with biting attacks on the social

strictures and conventions of his
day. Religious hypocrisy and
the economic and ethical pres
sures which forced women into
loveless empty marriages were
potent dragons when Ibsen as
saulted them, but today they
seem little more than clay
pigeons. Nothing rings more
hollow than an attack on that
which no longer needs to be at
tacked It does not seem a dan
gerous and radical remark to
suggest that living together, out
of what was picturesquely de
scribed as wedlock, could possi
bly be a happy and sane way to
exist. At this point in time,
Ibsen's social criticism suffers
trom a kind of ethical planned
obsolescence.
The ACT production em
phasizes the dated quality of the
play. The director, Allen
Fletcher, allows the pious, easi
ly deceived Pastor (Dana
Elcar) to dominate our atten
tion The role seems to belong in
a comedy with its obtuseness
and silly self aggrandizing and it
lowers the whole tone of the
play. The mother, Fru Helene
Alving (Anne Lawder), depends
on understatement and control
while the other actors seem
sure that they are in a
melodrama. Fru Helene be
comes so subdued that she

seems almost anonymous
Ibsen has a reputation for
brutal honesty and social re
alism. Ghosts was denounced as
an "open sewer" when it was
first produced in England. But
realism is relative and what im
presses one today is how often
Ibsen uses euphemism and
evasions Fru Helene, we are
told, has been reading "free
thinking writers" but we never
learn more about this. The son
suffers from hereditary syphilis
but we are only told some clap
trap about the sins of the father
being passed on to the son. The
dissolution and degeneracy of
the father apparently was an in
clination to sleep with different
women and a propensity to
drink more than he should. Such
anachronisms are of course not
Ibsen's fault. He was writing for
his age, not ours, but a more
daring director might, with
some judicious editing, have
eliminated some unintentional
humor.

nounce failure of such a worth
while organization as the ACT.

greatness, remains a difficult
play and the ACT, for all its
depth of talent, has not achieved
