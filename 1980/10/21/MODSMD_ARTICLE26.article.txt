# The 						B-52's: regurgitational

"I remember the potentiali
ty. not the actuality," said one
B-52's fan as he stumbled out of
the Warfield Theatre last Thurs
day evening. The potentiality?
A live show bv one of the most
enjoyable bands in rock and roll.
The actuality? A somewhat list
less concert from a band that
seemed to be getting its major
energy off hairspray. Sure, the
bouffants were piled high and
the plastic mini-skirts shone
brightly under the stage lights.
But as vapo-rockers like Leif
Garret know, or rather as any
one over 12 and possessing one Y
chromosome knows, good looks
do not good music make.
This is not to label the B-52's
as Tiger Beat cosmetic puffs,
nor is it meant to anger the loyal
fans who write letters to the
Daily editor when reviews dis
please them. Yet in concert
Thursday night, the '2's, content
to churn out carbon copies of
their album sound, relied main
ly on their stage presence. And
although merely going through

the motions is, for lead-singer
Fred Schneider, impressive,
there are a finite number of
ways one can contort a body
(count the pages in the
Kama Sutra) and Schneider
discovered them all two years
ago. The entire B-52's package
is great if you've never seen it
before, and it is fun to see things
over and over again, like
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Rein
deer on TV every December.
But TV is free .
The group's music is ex
cellent, and that fact alone
made the show at least placidly
entertaining, a weak substitute
for the exhiliration that the
B-52's can provide. It is
fascinating to see how they
manage to pull so much sound
and melody from what is essen
tially an extended rhythm sec
tion, a fact not readily apparent
on record — but the only song
which seemed to depart from its
album version was the "Planet
Claire" encore, although this
can be ascribed mainly to its
added loudness.

In fairness to the B-52's, some
of the blame for this concert
must lie with-the promoter. Bill
Graham While the Warfield is
fine for someone like Bob Dylan
(roundly booed when his upcom
ing concerts were announced i it
is a wretched choice for dance
bands like the Grateful Dead
and the B-52's. Size is not the
problem, for the Warfield. if not
cozy, is at least bigger than the
other local arenas and
auditoriums that Graham books
into. But the place is an old
vaudville palace, it's full of
seats, and there's practically no
room to dance. And Graham,
like your parents, seems more
concerned with safety than fun;
one can almost hear Graham's
mother: "Billy, did you hear
about the awful mess in Cincin
nati? So what kind of a business
is it that you're in?"
Still, if Graham set the stage,
it was the B-52's who per
formed. and they performed
without the vital raucousness
which is usually inherent in
them.
