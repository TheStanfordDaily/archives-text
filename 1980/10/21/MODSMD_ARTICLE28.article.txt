## Bette Midler: neoanachronistic 
### Steve Vineberg 
Bette Midler is a tough performer to cate
gorize. Those whose only contact with her
has been through her extraordinary work in
last year's The Rose may think of her as a
high-powered musical comedy actress of
the Barbra Streisand-Lisa Minnelli variety,
but in concert and on record she has another
quality that could only be glimpsed in a few
moments of The Rose, a wild improvised
hilarity that straddles the line between
burlesque and camp. Most of her musical
repertoire consists of send-ups of old swing
and early rock tunes that could not be per
formed straight now ("Boogie Woogie
Bugle Boy." "Chapel of Love") and ballads,
most of them awful, which she endows with
such emtional range that they are reborn
("Delta Dawn").
When she sings first-rate songs, with a
handful of notable exceptions, she over
states them: they are crushed under the
weight of her theatrics. ißob Dylan's "I
Shall Be Released." for example, receives
an overblown evangelical performance
when a clear reading of it would have better
served both Midler and the song.)
Furthermore, the division between the
fatuousness of some of her material and
what she does with it sometimes becomes
blurred — when she slips into her little girl
tears-in-the-voice role and an alreadv sen

timental number becomes even sappier —
and the enormous production numbers in
her shows often start to turn into the boring
Hollywood extravaganzas they are intended
to parody These last two tendencies were
painfully apparent both in her first Broad
way revue. Clams on the Half Shell, and her
television special a couple of years ago.
Divine Madness shows us all aspects of
Bette Midler. It is a filmed record of her
second Broadway show, lovingly shot bv
William Fraker and Bobby Byrne and
directed by Michael Ritchie with a keen
sense of stage dynamics. (The camera is
never in the wrong place, and the per
formers — Midler and her back-up vocal
ists. the "Harlettes" — have plenty of
breathing space. It's a pity that Ritchie
wasn't around to direct the No Nukes mov
ie. in which the musicians seemed to be bat
tling a suffocating close-up camera.)
Most of what Midler does is terrific — and
most of the time, if she gets into trouble, she
bails herself out by running on the spot or
striking a ballet pose — something that
functions as a rude comment on the serious
side of the number. She does a slurpv,
spaced-out rendition of the Tom Waits song
"Shiver Me Timbers," for example, but she
turns it into a joke before the number can
grate on us. She is an amazing extem
poraneous comedienne, her improvisations
on the rolls of fat under her arms and the

tassle hanging from the back of her dress
are actually funnier than the string of
Sophie Tucker dirty jokes she tells.
There are sequences that are un
salvageable, but most of them come late in
the picture and enough goodwill has been
built up by then to get us through. One ex
tended piece that has Midler playing a cross
between Carol Burnett's washerwoman and
the Madwoman of Chaillot is so clearly
pointless that one wonders why it wasn't
axed early in the rehearsal process.
But the best numbers are splendid. She
performs a dull tune called "Paradise" as a
raunchy erotic number, leaving us in no
doubt about what the metaphor of the title
really signifies. She sings three songs from
The Rose: the joyous Bob Seeger rocker
"The Fire Down Below," "Stay with Me,"
and the title song. "Stay with Me" has even
more intensity in this concert version than it
did in the previous film; and"The Rose,"
really a pale, unimaginative ballad, is much
better seen than just heard as it was ori
ginally on the soundtrack over closing cred
its. Midler turns bitter in the middle, bely
ing the unconvincing optimistic lyric and
deepening the song. And Ritchie and his pho
tographers capture her at the mike, stand
ing beneath a spotlight that glows like a star
seen through tears. The image is wonder
fully appropriate.
