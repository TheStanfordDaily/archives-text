# Ultravox: neurasthenic
## 
### Dave Lyon 
"I want to be a machine." — John Fox
John, who is no longer with Ultravox, the
nihilyricist of such verbal gems as " My sex is a
mongrel dog that walks on the end of a 10 foot
leash." has not killed himself but gone solo. Ul
travox replaced him with a synthesizer, and a
new lead vocalist, and has now raised Vienna
— their latest album.
The grimy brilliance of John's lyrics is miss
ing ; while there is a car wreck reference and
vague descriptions of streetlight blight, the
impassioned despair is dead and gone. Subtlety
has taken its place; and the album contains an
intriguing thematic progression well worthy of
its sharp black-and-white cover and trans
luscent grey record jacket. From the neu
rasthenic somnambulance of the opening
track, the gnomadic persona increasingly de
velops a personal and cultural awareness, only
to reach a point of enlightened neurasthenia,
"This means nothing to me," and the final
ironic result of all hvperconsciousness, im
mobility.

The music is excellent While the first and
last cuts, noticeably new wave, are marred by
commercially viable redundancy, genuine idi
osvncracies and musical complexity preserve
the songs' integrities The other songs are bet
ter. "Astradvne" and "Vienna'' are soothing;
"Private Lives" is raucously bizaare, and
"Mr. X" has an appealingly asinine profundi
ty-
Like Fox before him, Midge Ure sings, and
though distressing to New Wave puerilists, his
occasionally soaring vocals merge well with
the punctuating synthesizer and senseless vio
lins. Indeed, the violin work remains Ul
travox's greatest asset, and is agilely coordi
nated with the electronics, which approach the
style and sophistication of Kraftwork.
The album's diversity, its bursts of de
lirium, and synthetic opulence are rare, and
define the music as more Modern than New
Wave. Vienna is a sophisticated example of
'80s electronic pop from a relatively un
acknowledged group, whose breadth is only in
itially disconcerting, and whose talent is great.
