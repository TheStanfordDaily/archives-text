Cupertino â€” "The trend of our for
eign policy is extremely dangerous ...
a continuation will produce more
crises and a greater threat of war,"
said Henry Kissinger, former secre
tary of state.
Kissinger voiced his words of warn
ing at De Anza College's Flint Center
where he addressed a crowd of more
than 2500.
Currently a professor at
Georgetown University in Washing
ton. D C.. Kissinger said an increase
in U.S. military arms, a stable and de
liberate foreign policy, and a more co
operative attitude toward Latin
American countries will be necessary
to prevent future international crises.
Kissinger also reiterated support
for Republican candidate Ronald Re
agan Although Kissinger claimed no
previous involvement in presidential
campaigns, he said this election will
be "one of the most important, if not
the most important decision, with re
gard to peace and war."
The former secretary of state said
restoring a military balance with the
Soviet Union is a "national im
perative. The USSR, he said, is pro
ducing more weapons than the United
States in "every significant catego
ry"
Kissinger said the poor economic
and political health of the Soviet Union
will increase their desire to exploit
other countries before they "clean up
their own mess.' The increasing Sovi
et threat, said Kissinger, will cause
the international structure to disinte
grate. presenting the most fundamen
tal threat to world peace.
The descendancy of the U.S. into
"military inferiority," said Kissin
ger, is a result of "deliberate de
cisions by the Carter administration."
"No American should be satisfied."
said Kissinger, "unless military gaps
are being closed." He said these gaps
are actually broadening.
On the draft issue, Kissinger said he
favors "some form of national ser
vice" but not as a means of defense.
He said each citizen has an equal ob

ligation to protect his country, and not
just a selected portion.
Kissinger said he is "fundamentally
opposed to any price" for the release
of the U.S. hostages in Iran, including
trading arms for them. He said paying
anything for the hostages would set a
precedent which would provide incen
tive for similar acts of international
hostility.
Since Saudi Arabia has already re
ceived four military planes from the
U.S., said Kissinger, military aid to
Iran would put America on both sides
of the war. Kissinger said he doubts
any Soviet intervention in the Iran-
Iraq war because events are "going
well" for the Soviets as it is.
However. Kissinger said he would
not "make it an issue" if President
Jimmv Carter sends military aid to
Iran, nor would he encourage Reagan
to criticize the action.
Kissinger charged that Carter's
lack of understanding of the Iranian
situation and his inability to pursue a
"serious" foreign policy during the
final years of the shah's reign led to
the fall of Iran's pro-American gov
ernment.
An ambiguous foreign policy and
the decline of the U.S. role in world
leadership and military prominence,
according to Kissinger, are primary
reasons for the increase of U.S. isola
tionism.
He said the growing neutrality of
U.S. allies in Europe has left "the
backbone of defense without a
backbone of foreign policy."
"The foreign leaders are looking at
reality," said Kissinger. "The threat
is so great that they see no choice but
to conciliate aggressors."
Kissinger said the only way to re
verse the trend of isolationism is to
"put before the world that we have a
vision and a future and we intend to
get there. Europe, Japan, Southeast
Asia. India, Egypt and Israel are
yearning for an American definition of
what we stand for."
Kissinger strongly urged an at
titude of mutual respect between the

U.S. and Latin American countries.
"We must stop lecturing them," he
said.
A dangerous polarization of Latin
American countries is evolving, said
Kissinger, and U.S. pressure on hu
man rights have helped push those
countries away from the United States
boh to the right and to the left.
Kissinger said Mexico, which is en
tering a period of rapid growth, is

waiting for a show of U.S. concern for
its future, not just for its oil. "We need
to cooperate (even) when we don't
need them," he said.
Kissinger said looking at the future
as a historian leaves some room for
optimism. But he said. ''History will
not do our work for us; it teaches us
only conflicting lessons. Yet the U.S.
is still unique . . we are the only na
tion in the free world that can insure
our national security."
