# Kurosawa's Kagemusha: very good
## 
### Sieve Vineberg 
At this time, when movies are so expensive
to make and almost always in the hands of ex
ecutives who only care about television and
foreign sales, the film industry is in possibly
the least healthy state in its history. And yet,
in spite of everything, this is turning out to be
the best year for movies since the early '70s.
We have already had The Empire Strikes
Back, Dressed to Kill, The Long Riders, Prac
tice Makes Perfect, The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith, Christ Stopped at Eboli, The
Elephant Man, The Stunt Man (released
here this week) and nearly a dozen less im
pressive movies that are nonetheless worth
seeing. And now there is a great new epic by
Akira Kurosawa. Kagemusha: The Shadow
Warrior.
Kagemusha, which Kurosawa wrote with
Masato Ide, presents a situation that seems
right out of Pirandello. In the late 16th cen
tury, while a war is being waged among three
rival lords for control of all of Japan, the most
powerful of the trio, Shingen Takeda, hires a
thief who resembles him to act as his double.
When Shingen is killed, the double,
Kagemusha, must take over so that neither
the people of the Takeda clan nor their ene
mies will know of the loss of their leader.
Kagemusha must assume Shingen's role with
his mistresses, his young grandson, and his
disinherited bastard son. As time passes he
truly becomes the dead man's persona, like
the con man Vittorio De Sica played in Gener
al Delia Rovere who grew as noble as the Re
sistance leader he was impersonating — and
when he is discovered and must resume his
life as a peasant, Kagemusha lives in despair,
incomplete until he can die with "his" sol
diers in a disastrous battle that ends the power
of the Takeda clan. "The shadow of a man can
never desert that man," Shingen's brother,
who earlier served as his double, warns
Kagemusha. "I was my brother's shadow.
Now that I have lost him, it is as though I am
nothing."
In his 37 years of making movies, Kurosawa
has embraced a number of styles, and he

draws on all his resources here. In subject
matter. Kagemusha takes him back to the
samurai pictures that have accounted to a
large extent for his international fame ( The
Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, etc.), al
though the tone is no longer mocking and the
battle scenes have a different feeling. They
still have the formal, staged quality that one
associates with Kurosawa, but they now seem
to be the work of a great humanist: they are
immense and tragic canvasses that David or
Delacroix might have painted. The most for
midable scene is a tableau of the dead and
dying after the Takeda clan's last battle, and
it is almost surreal: Kurosawa's inspiration
for it must have been the Guernica of Picasso.
In the late '50s Kurosawa made his version
of Macbeth, Throne of Blood, and no stage or
film production that I have ever seen has so
nearly approached the spirit of that play. In
Kagemusha (which contains an early shot of a
messenger flving through hordes of waiting
soldiers that instantly recalls the opening se
quence of Throne of Blood) he deals with the
themes of war and power as Shakespeare
deals with them in Macbeth, Julius Caesar,
and the histories, and the comic scenes — like
one in which Kagemusha is challenged by
Shingen's little heir, or the one in which he
must confront Shingen's women for the first
time — have a robust humor that is really
Shakespearean. In this picture, as in the Ro
man plays and King Lear, war chiefs are con
stantly conferring in tents and surveying close
battles from small hills; at one point the cam
era tracks back and we see silhouettes of two
sets of leaders sitting in front of a cyclorama
of red and blue fire and smoke rising from the
clash of their two armies.
Humanism is a force that has mainly ap
peared over the past decade in Kurosawa's
movies — Do-des-ka-den, Red Beard and
Dersu Uzala are all focused on the kind of
emotional exchanges that the characters
Toshiro Mifune used to play for Kurosawa —
those amused, steely mercenaries — would
never have concerned themselves with. Life
has a value in these movies that it didn't

always have in Kurosawa's work; age has
mellowed him Do-des-ka-den was bit
tersweet and haunting in the way that Hans
Christian Andersen's fairy tales are. and
there was a mysticism, too. in the depiction of
the old Mongolian guide in Dersu Uzala whose
respect for nature amounted to a sort of pagan
ritual, a worshipping of the elements. The
scenes of Dersu building a shelter out of brush
to shield himself from a devastating storm
and talking about the spirit that resides in the
embers of a campfire lead us into the great se
quence in in which the thief, who
has not been told that Shingen is dead, breaks
open an urn and sees Shingen's body inside, or
the expressionistic nightmare scene that
shows us Kagemusha's fear of being pursued
by the ghost of his double.
Kagemusha has a fabulous musical score
by Shinichiro Ikebe. and the cinemato
graphers, Takao Saito and Masaharu Uede,
are instrumental in realizing the enormous
scope of Kurosawa's vision. As in Dersu
Uzala, there are images so unusual that one
wants to know how on earth they were at
tained. (One is of soldiers marching to the sea,
towards a rainbow that deepens until its beau
ty becomes other-worldly.) And Kurosawa
found an ideal actor, Tatsuya Nakadai, for the
twin roles of Shingen and Kagemusha.
In the ads for this picture, George Lucas
and Francis Ford Coppola are listed as ex
ecutive producers. Apparently Kurosawa ran
into financial difficulties and was only able to
finish the picture because these men, both of
whom know so well the perils of making a
movie that requires an extravagant budget,
put up the money he needed. When you see this
movie and think that it almost wasn't com
pleted, you begin to regard Lucas and Coppola
as heroes. One can just imagine what Coppola,
who may be the only other director alive
capable of making a film of this scope, must
have felt when he saw the rushes. For the pri
mary hero oT "this venture — of any film ven
ture in this fefflarkable year — is the man
who. at 70. has produced the summit achieve
ment of his career.
