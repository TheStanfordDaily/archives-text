# Hackett: Genesisidal
## 
### Mike Wilkins 
Steve Hackett is known to some as the
man who replaced Anthony Phillips. and to
others as the man replaced by Darrvl
Sturmer The sad thing is that to most peo
ple. Steve Hackett is not known at all. As
guitarist for the group Genesis from 1970
through 1977. Hackett helped to create
their "sound" with his trademark infinite
sustain and fingerboard derring-do But it
was only after Hackett had left Genesis
that they attained their current wide
spread commercial success, and so while
Genesis can fill places like Madison Square
Garden and the Cow Palace. Steve
Hackett. now performing solo, plays the
club circuit.

k /f is impossible to choose an
adjective to describe
Hackett's playing. Playing
is a verb, and any modifier
of that verb is an adverb.'

On this night, he was performing at The
Old Waldorf, an intimate club whose
owners are too cheap to give reviewers
free tickets. If anyone else besides Hackett
were playing, I probably would have taken
the $8.50 a ticket I spent and gone to see
Mort Sahl. still performing at The Enter
tainers. But Hackett was playing, and I
went. So did some other people In fact, it
was pretty crowded, many of those in at
tendance being "Hackett Fans." a group of
hardcore Steve Hackett fans who see him
when he is in the area and they've got noth
ing better planned. ~
It is impossible to choose an adjective to
describe Hackett's playing. Playing is a
verb, and any modifier of that verb is an
adverb, not an adjective. But if one had to
choose an adverb to describe Steve
Hackett's playing it would be "good."' He's
a good guitarist, he really is. Professional
too, but that's using "good"' and "pro

fessional" to modify guitarist." which is
a noun So I guess "well" is the proper
word to describe his playing, and "good"
the proper word to describe Haekett.
But what are words when you're sitting
in a nightclub like a grownup, and you've
got a cute woman on your arm. and you're
grooving on tunes, and you're ordering
drinks, and everything's cool. And then
someone behind you lights up a cigarette
and you cough and come back to earth.
War. pollution, disease, and like that.
"Nightclubs and entertainment are escap
ist.'' you think Fucking right on.
1 wasn't thinking that Friday though, be
cause Steve Haekett is so good His music
is hot. technically on cue. and good to listen
to. His back-up band, featuring his brother
John on flutes, guitars and keyboards, was
tight and professional If you shut your
eyes you could swear it was a record. Ex
cept for the vocalist Man. he was terrible.
Maybe it was the mix. but Christ, he don't
sing, he screeches. But he didn't sing a
whole lot, maybe because Hackett's music
is mainly instrumental. I liked the show.
You can tell British progressive rockers
like Haekett. and Brand X. and Caravan,
etc., are fun loving guys because of all the
funny stuff they put on their album liner
notes ("Pve Waxier — Electric basses,
Ouija Board. Mouse Vas Deferens" to cite
an example from National Health).
Hackett's stage show has touches of this
spirit in it. The Genesis riff during his
acoustic piece, the '40s bar number, the
crazy drummer (a group now protected by
federal law — watch for an upcoming re
view of Crosby Nash's benefit concert for
crazy drummers), and the good-natured
joking with his fans attest to this.
Steve Haekett has four solo albums out.
All are worth hearing. Two can be found in
the cut-out racks and are well worth the
three bucks In fact, don't go see him per
form. Buy two of his albums instead
(Please Don't Touch and Spectral Morn
ings). They have a good vocalist on them,
and you can hear the songs you like over
and over again.
