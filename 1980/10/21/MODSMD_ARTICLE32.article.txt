days" on conditions for release of the 52 U.S hostages and

spies.

meini. meanwhile, agreed to allow a war mediation com
mittee of Islamic heads of state to visit Iran. Tehran radio
said.
Tehran Radio quoted Khomeini as saying that the com
mission from the 40-nation Islamic Conference should con
fine itself to "investigating the criminal invasion'' of Iran
by Iraq. He also appeared to set conditions for a truce that
would be unacceptable to Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein, whom Khomeini wants to see toppled
Khomeini stipulated the group was to be confined to "in
vestigating the criminal invasion" he said was ordered by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, according to the radio.
But acceptance of the delegation, even on a conditional
basis, was seen as a small step toward solution of the four
week-old Iran-Iraq war at the head of the Persian Guli.
Meanwhile, the war entered its fifth week with reports
of house-to-house fighting in the besieged Iranian port city
of Khorramshahr. The Iranian Pars news agency took the
unusual step of conceding that the Iraqis now control all
highways leading into Abadan
Abadan. along with neighboring Khorramshahr. was
said by Baghdad Radio yesterday to be locked in a "air
tight siege."
In accepting the Islamic Conference proposal of a medi
ation commission visit. Khomeini said, "It is all right if
the Islamic leaders come to Iran to investigate Saddam's
crime ... Saddam trampled on all international norms and
invaded Iran without any reason . . The damage caused
by this criminal is irreparable."

Presidential debate format decided
Washington — Negotiators for President Jimmy Carter
and Ronald Reagan agreed yesterday on a format for a
presidential debate but were unable to settle on a date and
place It appeared that the differences were not likely to
scuttle a debate
We were willing to give them an> date between Oct 28
and Nov 3." said James Baker, a senior Reagan adviser.
"They prefer the 26th "
But Baker said the differences could be resolved later
yesterday in a telephone conference The talks were held
in the Washington offices of the League of Women Voters,
the proposed sponsors of the debate.
The debate could prove decisive in the closing days of
the election campaign The latest polls indicate that
Carter and his Republican challenger are running very
close in the large industrial states where elections usually
are won or lost, with a large bloc of undecided voters.
Baker and two other Reagan advisers met with Carter
campaign chairman Robert Strauss. White House press
secretary Jody Powell and others for more than four
hours, reaching agreement only on a debate format.
The details of that were not disclosed.
Baker, appearing on ABC-TV's "Good Morning Ameri
ca" show before the meeting, said Reagan preferred an
election-eve debate on Nov 3 so the images from the de
bate would be fresh in the voters' minds.
But Powell, stepping out of the meeting briefly, said
that would leave "no time for anybody to be called for mis
statements, contradictions and inaccuracies.'
Israelis deny deported mayors' plea
Jerusalem— The Israeli military, ignoring the threat of
a new wave of criticism abroad and at home, yesterday
turned down the appeal by two deported West Bank Arab
mayors that they be allowed to come home.
The military governor of the West Bank announced the
decision. Aides said, that "it was assumed" that he had
consulted with Menachem Begin, who is both prime min
ister and defense minister, in reaching the verdict.
Hebron Mayor Fahd Kawasmeh and Haloul Mayor
Mohammed Milhem were deported within hours of the
May 2 slaying of six Israeli religious school students in the

Arab city of Hebron, without being allowed to appeal. At
the time, authorities blamed speeches the men made in
late March at a demonstration protesting an Israeli de
cision to settle students in Hebron for inciting the May 2
ambush.
FDA proposes tampon warning label
Washington — The Food and Drug Administration yes
terday formally proposed that a warning label be put on ail
brands of tampons to warn women that tampons have been
linked to the rare but deadly disease Toxic Shock Syn
drome.
The agency said the major manufacturers of tampons
already have indicated they will voluntarily put warning
labels on their products while the FDA goes through its
procedures to make the rule mandatory.
One brand of tampon. Rely, was pulled off the market by
its manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, last month because
initial studies indicated it increased the risk more than
other brands. But the FDA said, "All brands of tampons
have been associated with the disease."
The proposed label would say:
"WARNING: Tampons have been associated with Tox
ic Shock Syndrome, a rare disease that can be fatal.
"You can almost entirely avoid the risk of getting this
disease by not using tampons. You can reduce the risk by
using tampons on and off during your period.
"If you have a fever of 102 degrees or more, and vomit or
get diarrhea during your period, remove the tampon at
once and see a doctor right away."
Philippine chief orders 30 arrested
Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos,
harassed by an upsurge in terrorist bombings against his
martial law regime, ordered 30 people arrested yesterday,
including nine opposition leaders and a U.S. businessman.
The action came after an explosion Sunday slightly in
jured seven Americans and about 13 others among 5000
delegates attending a the 50th anniversary congress of the
American Society of Travel Agents. ASTA officials can
celed the week-long convention and delegates jammed air
line counters to book flights out of the Philippines.
The April 6 Liberation Movement, an opposition group
that bombed four tourist hotels Oct. 4, claimed responsi
bility for the bombing. The group takes its name from an

anti-Marcos protest held on the eve of 1978 congressional
elections.
ASTA officials said they had planned to relocate the con
gress after the group warned them not to hold it in Manila,
but reconsidered after the government assured them
heavy protection for all delegates.
Ford's Escort must overcome bias
Ford Motor Co. is going to have trouble selling its new
Escort, according to a group of import car owners who re
cently test-drove the car in an informal survey for the Los
Angeles Times.
Many of them thought the Escort compared favorably
with the import they now drive and said they would con
sider buying the Ford. But they also displayed a deep bias
against American-made cars — one that Ford and other
U.S. auto makers will have to overcome if they expect to
take back some of the customers lost to the foreign manu
facturers over the last several years.
Their opinions are important because the Escort is
widely considered to be the first American-made small
car designed to compete directly with the popular subcom
pact import models.
In the past, American small cars were almost always a
little bigger, a little faster, and a little more like their larg
er American cousins than they were head-on competitors
for the imports.
Dow Jones shows market gains
New York — The stock market, absorbing a flurry of
mixed corporate earnings reports, managed to post gains
in key market indexes yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 4.70
to 960.84. The blue chip index had been showing a loss of
about 3 points by early afternoon before a late buying
surge reversed that trend.
Volume on the NYSE came to 40.91 million shares, down
from 43.92 million in the previous session.

The debate could prove decisive in the closing days of
the election campaign The latest polls indicate that
Carter and his Republican challenger are running very
close in the large industrial states where elections usually
are won or lost, with a large bloc of undecided voters.
Baker and two other Reagan advisers met with Carter
campaign chairman Robert Strauss. White House press
secretary Jody Powell and others for more than four
hours, reaching agreement only on a debate format.

Israelis deny deported mayors' plea
Jerusalem— The Israeli military, ignoring the threat of
a new wave of criticism abroad and at home, yesterday
turned down the appeal by two deported West Bank Arab
mayors that they be allowed to come home.
The military governor of the West Bank announced the
decision. Aides said, that "it was assumed" that he had
consulted with Menachem Begin, who is both prime min
ister and defense minister, in reaching the verdict.
Hebron Mayor Fahd Kawasmeh and Haloul Mayor
Mohammed Milhem were deported within hours of the
May 2 slaying of six Israeli religious school students in the

Arab city of Hebron, without being allowed to appeal. At
the time, authorities blamed speeches the men made in
late March at a demonstration protesting an Israeli de
cision to settle students in Hebron for inciting the May 2
ambush.
FDA proposes tampon warning label
Washington — The Food and Drug Administration yes
terday formally proposed that a warning label be put on ail
brands of tampons to warn women that tampons have been
linked to the rare but deadly disease Toxic Shock Syn
drome.
The agency said the major manufacturers of tampons
already have indicated they will voluntarily put warning
labels on their products while the FDA goes through its
procedures to make the rule mandatory.
One brand of tampon. Rely, was pulled off the market by
its manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, last month because
initial studies indicated it increased the risk more than
other brands. But the FDA said, "All brands of tampons
have been associated with the disease."
The proposed label would say:
"WARNING: Tampons have been associated with Tox
ic Shock Syndrome, a rare disease that can be fatal.
"You can almost entirely avoid the risk of getting this
disease by not using tampons. You can reduce the risk by
using tampons on and off during your period.
"If you have a fever of 102 degrees or more, and vomit or
get diarrhea during your period, remove the tampon at
once and see a doctor right away."
Philippine chief orders 30 arrested
Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos,
harassed by an upsurge in terrorist bombings against his
martial law regime, ordered 30 people arrested yesterday,
including nine opposition leaders and a U.S. businessman.
The action came after an explosion Sunday slightly in
jured seven Americans and about 13 others among 5000
delegates attending a the 50th anniversary congress of the
American Society of Travel Agents. ASTA officials can
celed the week-long convention and delegates jammed air
line counters to book flights out of the Philippines.
The April 6 Liberation Movement, an opposition group
that bombed four tourist hotels Oct. 4, claimed responsi
bility for the bombing. The group takes its name from an

anti-Marcos protest held on the eve of 1978 congressional
elections.
ASTA officials said they had planned to relocate the con
gress after the group warned them not to hold it in Manila,
but reconsidered after the government assured them
heavy protection for all delegates.
Ford's Escort must overcome bias
Ford Motor Co. is going to have trouble selling its new
Escort, according to a group of import car owners who re
cently test-drove the car in an informal survey for the Los
Angeles Times.
Many of them thought the Escort compared favorably
with the import they now drive and said they would con
sider buying the Ford. But they also displayed a deep bias
against American-made cars — one that Ford and other
U.S. auto makers will have to overcome if they expect to
take back some of the customers lost to the foreign manu
facturers over the last several years.
Their opinions are important because the Escort is
widely considered to be the first American-made small
car designed to compete directly with the popular subcom
pact import models.
In the past, American small cars were almost always a
little bigger, a little faster, and a little more like their larg
er American cousins than they were head-on competitors
for the imports.

FDA proposes tampon warning label
Washington — The Food and Drug Administration yes
terday formally proposed that a warning label be put on ail
brands of tampons to warn women that tampons have been
linked to the rare but deadly disease Toxic Shock Syn
drome.
The agency said the major manufacturers of tampons
already have indicated they will voluntarily put warning
labels on their products while the FDA goes through its
procedures to make the rule mandatory.
One brand of tampon. Rely, was pulled off the market by
its manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, last month because
initial studies indicated it increased the risk more than
other brands. But the FDA said, "All brands of tampons
have been associated with the disease."

"WARNING: Tampons have been associated with Tox
ic Shock Syndrome, a rare disease that can be fatal.
"You can almost entirely avoid the risk of getting this
disease by not using tampons. You can reduce the risk by
using tampons on and off during your period.

get diarrhea during your period, remove the tampon at

Philippine chief orders 30 arrested
Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos,
harassed by an upsurge in terrorist bombings against his
martial law regime, ordered 30 people arrested yesterday,
including nine opposition leaders and a U.S. businessman.
The action came after an explosion Sunday slightly in
jured seven Americans and about 13 others among 5000
delegates attending a the 50th anniversary congress of the
American Society of Travel Agents. ASTA officials can
celed the week-long convention and delegates jammed air
line counters to book flights out of the Philippines.
The April 6 Liberation Movement, an opposition group
that bombed four tourist hotels Oct. 4, claimed responsi
bility for the bombing. The group takes its name from an

anti-Marcos protest held on the eve of 1978 congressional
elections.
ASTA officials said they had planned to relocate the con
gress after the group warned them not to hold it in Manila,
but reconsidered after the government assured them
heavy protection for all delegates.
Ford's Escort must overcome bias
Ford Motor Co. is going to have trouble selling its new
Escort, according to a group of import car owners who re
cently test-drove the car in an informal survey for the Los
Angeles Times.
Many of them thought the Escort compared favorably
with the import they now drive and said they would con
sider buying the Ford. But they also displayed a deep bias
against American-made cars — one that Ford and other
U.S. auto makers will have to overcome if they expect to
take back some of the customers lost to the foreign manu
facturers over the last several years.
Their opinions are important because the Escort is
widely considered to be the first American-made small
car designed to compete directly with the popular subcom
pact import models.
In the past, American small cars were almost always a
little bigger, a little faster, and a little more like their larg
er American cousins than they were head-on competitors
for the imports.

Iran to decide on hostage fate
Beirut, Lebanon— The speaker of Iran's Parliament
said yesterday it will decide in the "next two or three
days" on conditions for release of the 52 U.S hostages and
that he thinks it unlikely the Americans will be tried as
spies.
In a telephone interview from Tehran with The As
sociated Press here, speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said the
war was not affecting the hostages, who have been held
since Nov. 4. and that he thought the conditions for their
release would be the same as those stated earlier by Kho
meini.
Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini. meanwhile, agreed to allow a war mediation com
mittee of Islamic heads of state to visit Iran. Tehran radio
said.
Tehran Radio quoted Khomeini as saying that the com
mission from the 40-nation Islamic Conference should con
fine itself to "investigating the criminal invasion'' of Iran
by Iraq. He also appeared to set conditions for a truce that
would be unacceptable to Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein, whom Khomeini wants to see toppled
Khomeini stipulated the group was to be confined to "in
vestigating the criminal invasion" he said was ordered by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, according to the radio.
But acceptance of the delegation, even on a conditional
basis, was seen as a small step toward solution of the four
week-old Iran-Iraq war at the head of the Persian Guli.
Meanwhile, the war entered its fifth week with reports
of house-to-house fighting in the besieged Iranian port city
of Khorramshahr. The Iranian Pars news agency took the
