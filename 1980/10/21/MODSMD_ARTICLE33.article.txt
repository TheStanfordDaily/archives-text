# County voters to give preference on draft
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
"Do the citizens of Santa Clara
County, State of California, object to
peacetime military conscription (the
draft)?"
This question is also known as Meas
ure C and will be on the Nov. 4 ballot
for county residents. Despite its seem
ing clarity, doubt is growing as to what
will be done with the results of the
balloting.
The proposal to have a ballot issue
on the draft was made by a group of
citizens led by the Womens' Interna
tional League for Peace and Freedom
(WILPF). In July, the group pres
ented a petition to the Board of Super
visors of Santa Clara County to have
the issue put to an advisory vote.

Several unions, church and political
groups, and Congressman Don Ed
wards of District 10 supported the pro
posal. As soon as the petition was
passed, most of the organizations in
volved began a campaign to inform
the public of Measure C and what it
means.
Though the question raises the pos
sibility of legislative action. Marjorie
Boehm. U.S. section president of the
WILPF. said, "It (Measure C) is in
tended as a vehicle to let people ex
press their opinion about the draft."
The results of the ballot will be sent
to the White House and anti-draft or
ganizations across the country, which
are expected to use them for their lob
bying activities in Congress.
