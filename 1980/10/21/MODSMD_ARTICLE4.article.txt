# Ombudsman notes violations of Honor Code are increasing

The problem of increasing Honor
(ode violations was highlighted by
Ombudsman John Goheen in his an
nual report to the University presi
dent.
The 1979-80 academic year was the
busiest in the history of the Om
budsman's office, which handled a to
tal of 543 cases, said the report. The of
fice handles complaints brought by
faculty, students and staff, ranging
from poor teaching to parking fines to
reports of low morale among some
staff members.
Thirty-six suspected violations of
the Honor Code were handled by the
Ombudsman's office last year,
prompting Goheen to report, "From
the perspective of this office, the Hon
or Code is under serious pressure in
some areas of instruction."
The report says the number of cases
seems small, but considering that '20
cases were prosecuted it is indicative
of trouble in that many violations do
not get officially reported. Both facul
ty and students have brought Honor
Code complaints to the Ombudsman's
office in the past year
The Honor Code has been in effect
since 1921, after being tested primari
ly in the Law School. It places the
burden of academic honesty on the
students, calling upon them to pledge
on their honor to not cheat on tests or
assignments. Because of the code,
Stanford does not allow proctors at
tests as many other universities do.
Goheen, an emeritus professor of
philosophy, believes that the pressure
on the Honor Code has been building
over the past several years, and is the
result of increased competition
among students for better grades.
He said in the past five years stu
dents have become more "pro
fessional" as undergraduates, with
more students competing for ad
mission to highly selective graduate
schools of business, law or medicine.
Goheen also said stress caused by a
general "age of uncertainty." and in
particular by future job outlooks has
encouraged more students to take ad
vantage of the Honor Code. He said in
a more relaxed time, such pressures
would abate.
Goheen reported that most Honor
Code cases come from only a few
courses.
"The struggle for high grades in
critical classes . causes some stu
dents to cheat," the report said

Goheen singled out several math
classes and Chemistry 31 as critical
courses. The report also savs that the
crowded conditions at the LOTS com
puter facility has caused "con
siderable dishonorable conduct."
Goheen has been publicly critical of
parts of the Honor Code in the past. "If
you operate under an Honor Code, you
want it to work." he said.
He said students don't understand
or follow the third-person responsi
bility provisions of the code, which re
quire them to report other students
who are cheating When students fail
this responsibility, they too are in vio
lation of the code.
Goheen said this provision should be
stressed and explained. Also, the re
port recommends re-examining pen
alty grading, which allows teachers to
penalize cheating by grade adjust
ments.
About half of the complaints re
ceived by the Ombudsman's office
come from students.
Complaints often concern poor

course organization, or lack of clear
instructions for assignments. The re
port notes that these i complaints >
are distributed throughout the Univer
sity. and few departments escape
some student criticism "
In addition to the Honor ('ode and
academic complaints, the Om
budsman's office has been receiving
complaints that a reorganization of
staff members in Plant Services has
caused a "substantial number'' of em
ployees in Operations and Main
tenance to criticize disorder in super
visory directions, and express general
discontent with working conditions.
The report says there were few
complaints about the Food Service,
but that one persistent problem stands
out: that food coming from a common
source varies from residence to resi
dence in quality.
Goheen called this a communica
tion problem between the Food Ser
vice and students, resulting primarily
from a lack of student participation on
food committees and taste panels
