A new coalition of minority,
feminist, labor and other political or
ganizations. called the Stanford
Progressive Alliance (SPAi, is form
ing for mutual support and coordi
nation of projects.
Organizer Jim Stever, a law student
affiliated with the Stanford Lawyer's
Guild, said the SPA's first plans in
clude publishing a list of
"progressive'' events on a bi-monthly
basis for campus-wide distribution.
A similar coalition in 1977. the Stu
dent Organizing Committee (SOO,
was short-lived but succeeded in get
tings its 12-member slate elected to
the ASSU Senate. It disbanded follow
ing the censures or reprimands of
many of its senate s for irregularities
in campaigning procedures and. ac
cording to former members, because
of a breakdown of unity among its
groups.
This year's coalition is equally di
verse. Fifty-two organizations have
pledged initial support by listing their
names and telephone numbers on a
contact sheet.
"We are a diverse group." said
Steyer. ' but we have many shared in
terests There are areas of common
concern where we can work together
offering mutual support."
Immediate areas of concern for the
group include the disputes between
the University and the Office Staff Or
ganizing Committee (OSOC) and be
tween the Cowell Student Health Cen
ter nurses and their management, the
Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
OSOC. a group of clerical workers
trying to organize a recognized union
on campus, has asked SPA to serve as
a support base between the time it
petitions the National Labor Relations
Board for recognition and the time it
holds elections for establishing the un
ion.
"Visible student support would be
valuable." said OSOC chairperson
Joyce Tippes-Coates. "To be a pres

ence on campus is important, espe
cially during the lag time between
submitting our authorization cards
and the elections. - '
Representatives of the nursing staff
at Cowell have also asked for SPA sup
port. The nurses are involved in a dis
pute with management over bargain
ing recognition. It began earlier this
year when the nurses voted to affiliate
their union, the Registered Nurses
Council (RNC), with the American
Federation of Teachers, in the AFL
CIO.
The Palo Alto Medical Clinic man
agement refused to negotiate with the
RNC under the new affiliation. In ad
dition. the RNC asserted that PAMC
management was attempting to dis
courage union membership bv
withholding cost-of-living pay in
creases which have been granted to
non-union personnel. Non-union work
ers received an 8' 2 percent cost-of-liv
ing raise in July.
This Friday the nurses will vote on
whether to walk off their jobs next
Monday, according to nurses' spokes
man Andrew Goldenkranz SPA has
been asked to participate in informa
tional picketing in front of Cowell and
help distribute leaflets on the dispute.
In addition to their commitment to
campus labor movements. SPA or
ganizers say they hope to increase
awareness of minorities.
"The position of minorities on cam
pus has declined since the early 70s.
when they were at their strongest po
