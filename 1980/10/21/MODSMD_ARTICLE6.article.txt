Despite the perception of wide
spread apathy among Americans
toward the upcoming presidential
election, Stanford has once again ex
perienced a remarkably successful
voter registration drive.
Co-sponsored by the ASSU and
Frontlash. the drive registered almost
3500 people by the Oct 6 deadline, sur
passing its goal of 2500. Frontlash is a
non-profit, non-partisan organization
which aims to increase the number of
young voters.
Dick Butterfield. a member of
ASSU Council of Presidents, at
tributed the record number of regis
trations to increased political aware
ness because of the presidential cam
paign and to better planning. He said
more thought was given to the effort of
informing potential voters on the pro
cedures for registering and re-regis
tering.
"The fact that we were inside
Maples Pavilion during both (regis
tration) days was invaluable to the
success of our drive." explained But
terfield He said a considerable
number of people registered at White
Plaza, especially during ASSU's
Harvest activities.
Andrew (loldenkranz of Frontlash
said Stanford's campus-based regis
tration drive is a nation-wide model.
"The percentage of people who reg
istered this year at Stanfod is certain
ly a record for a residential univer."
he said.
To account for the success of the
drive when many voters seem dis
satisfied, Goldenkranz said, "When
people get down to it. they realize
someone is going to be elected. The
choices may not meet with their
degrees of expectation, but the gov
ernment is not going to go away and
the students know this."
Butterfield. although "very
pleased" with the results of the drive,
warned that registering to vote is only
the first step toward a more important
end.
it is one thing to register and an

other to reach out to obtain the in
formation necessary to become an
educated voter," he said.
The ASSU and Frontlash weren't
alone in their efforts. Scott Olmsted,
editor of The Stanford Libertarian,
reported registering many people
"just so they could vote for our can
didate â€” Ed Clark." He said Liber
tarian candidate Bill Evers's cam
paign also registered "all we could
handle" during the two days of regis
tration.
