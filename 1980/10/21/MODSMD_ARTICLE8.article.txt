## Gulf conflict reflects historical divisions 
### 
F rom the Dailv wire services
United Nations — Now that the Persian Gulf
war is being fought in New York as well as in the
Mideast, and surface histrionics predominate as
the Sec urity Council offers a stage to the drama of
the Iran-Iraq conflict, it would do well for on
lookers to keep in mind some of the underlying re
alities.
As irrational as the headlines often make it
seem, the engagement between Iran and Iraq is
not a product of sudden opportunity. Even less is it
a matter of chance. Consider these aspects:
— The clash of personality. Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein, a ruthless, shrewd, able politician
swept in as Baghdad's absolute ruler, wiping out
collaborators in his own junta in the process. He
took over the levers of power on July 11, 1979, be
coming secretary-general of the ruling leftist
Baathist Party. The next day he emerged as head
of state and of the army. Opponents were
eliminated as agents of American imperialism
and Zionism, forces depicted as forever inimical
to Iraq.
At almost the same time, Avatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, mystical, charismatic, single-minded
in pursuance of Islam in a harsh, medieval man
ifestation. was consolidating his power in Iran. He
needed no titles but one, Imam. For Iran's pre
dominating Shiite sect, that means something
more than priest or judge, something less but not
much less than messiah. Khomeini managed to
position contending powers — those of the presi
dency, the prime minister and the parliament —
in such a way that all would be subordinate to his
authority. The arch-enemy was seen as the United
States, the "Great Satan.'' and Zionism.
—The clash of philosophy. Iraq proclaims Arab
nationalism and socialism in a totally secular
mold. Iran embraces ultrafundamentalism
through revolutionary Islam, and elevates its
espousal to the highest form of civic virtue. In line
with values of the ruling Baathist Party, Baghdad
takes Pan-Arabism as its principal international
mission, viewing all 22 Arab countries as compos
ing a single nation in prospect, if not in fact, and
leaving no doubt as to which city it regards as the
pghttul capital. Iraq's pan-Arabism is pitted
against Iran's pan-Islam, the triumphalist view
that among followers of the Prophet, there are no
borders.
—The clash of geopolitics. The wealth of Iran is
in its western province. Khuzestan. which the
Iraqis call Arabistan. By either name, the prov
ince is populated mostly by ethnic Arabs, whose
allegiance Iraq might like to claim. Abadan,
Khorramshahr and most of the other cities caught
up in the current conflict are oil centers of

Khuzestan, and their outlet is in the Shatt al-Arab
waterway, long claimed by Iraq in its entirety but
shared with Iran. In 1975, Iraq abandoned the
claim and accepted other frontier adjustments in
return for an Iranian pledge to stop aid to Kurdish
rebels. Iraq now claims that Iran never fully kept
the agreement and undertook a campaign of sabo
tage and terrorism to establish hegemony in the
Persian Gulf area. Iran insists it is the victim of
Iraqi aggression.
Ethnic and religious divisions and rivalries
seem to plague Iraq more than Iran. An estimated
60 percent of Iraq's 13 million citizens are Shiites,
whose brand of Islam could impel them into Kho
meini's orbit. About 20 percent are Kurds, who
are Sunni Moslems like Iraq's rulers, but unlike
them, are non-Arab and have long been seeking
autonomy. Only the remaining 20 percent are Sun
ni Arabs, whose ethnicity predominates in Bagh
dad.
Overcoming any misgivings occasioned by
those divisions, Baghdad unleashed on Sept. 22 a
blitzkrieg operation thought by experts to have
been meticulously prepared in the field and given
advance clearance by both Saudi and Soviet lead
ers. Those experts believe the Iraqis hoped within
a week to achieve at least two of three objectives:
— Amendment of the border, including the
Shatt al-Arab waterway.
— Conquest of Khuzestan.
— Control of the Strait of Hormuz, at the lower
end of the Persian Gulf, a passage through which
travel tankers carrying 60 percent of the imported
oil of the West, including all that comes from
Kuwait and the Emirates and much that is
pumped from Saudi Arabian fields.
There were two surprises. The Iraqis made a
relatively poor showing in the field, and after
almost a month of fighting, seemed unable to gain
their objectives. Iranian resistance turned out to
be much stiffer than expected, despite an army
that lost most of its high officers to prison or exile,
despite drastically inadequate maintenance of
equipment, and despite the absence of foreign
technicians.
In the political arena, the stakes involve no less
than the unity of the Arab world, as Libya, Syria
and perhaps Algeria line up with Iran, while most
other Arab countries back Iraq to a greater or
lesser degree. Some observers detect a hesitancy
to give Iraq all-out support, based on the fact that
if Baghdad should succeed in demolishing Iran
and capturing most of its oil fields, Iraq would be
come something of a superpower with as much oil
as the Saudis.
Not even the Russians, it is suspected, want an
Iraqi victory of that magnitude.
