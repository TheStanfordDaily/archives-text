# Soviets increase reliance on nuke power

### Washington Post 
Volgodnnsk, Soviet Union — Around this
raw, new city in the lower Don River valley
600 miles south of Moscow, the land is a
quiet table of dark, plowed fields, popular
windbreaks shimmering green and gold in
autumnal light, and small brick houses
clustered amid private orchards of
harvested pear and apple trees.
There is hardly a clue for more than four
centuries, this remote edge of the Hunger
steppe in southern Russia nurtured one
group of the fierce Cossacks, whose warlike
ways pushed czarist power eastward
through Siberia, spawning legends of der
ring-do known today to millions in the Soviet
Union.
Instead, all is aimed — urgently so — at
the future, for it is here that the Soviets
almost overnight have constructed an im
mense factory town to mass-produce atom
ic reactors critically important to boosting
the Soviet Union's strained electrical power

resources.
The "atommash" (atomic machinery)
complex will complete its first reactor
vessel Feb. 23, the opening day of the 26th
Party Congress. Within three years,
ebullient factory managers say, they will be
making eight reactor vessels a year. When
installed, each will add 1 million kilowatts
of electricity a year to the Soviet and East
European power grid, where demand is out
stripping supply.
Although it possesses the world's most
extensive coal reserves and is the world's
largest oil producer, the Soviet Union's re
sources either are already fully committed
for decades to come or are too distant and
expensive to exploit in time to meet
projected needs. Thus, while capitalist na
tions are trimming their own atomic power
plans in the face of environmental questions
and reduced estimates of demand, the Sovi
et Union will depend heavily on nuclear-gen
erated electricity. Nuclear power accounts

for about 4.5 percent of all power in the Sovi
et Union — substantially less than the per
centage in the United States — and nuclear
power is less important as a source of heat
and light here than the wood stove. Yet by
the end of the century, the Soviets hope to
more than triple this percentage with atom
ic power plants scattered throughout Eu
ropean Russia, where about 75 percent of
the Soviet population lives and works.
Like so many other massive projects in
this country, the "atommash" effort shows
the immense muscle a command economy
can apply to a crash project and the freedom
to maneuver in a country where there is no
serious public criticism or opposition to
government decisions.
With more than $2 billion at their dis
posal, builders arrived in Volgodonsk in
1976. Now. 130,000 people live in huge, high
rise apartment blocks in an area where
