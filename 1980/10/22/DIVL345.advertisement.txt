It's just another day unless
you make a phone call
Do nothing, and it will be just like, any other
day. But if you call or stop by the Placement Office to set
up an appointment, that day will be a very important
one in your life. The day you find out about your future
in Colorado Springs with Inmos.
INMOS, a new semiconductor firm, decided
to build its US headquarters in Colorado Springs
with views from every window of Pikes Peak and
the Cheyenne Mountain range. We found the peace
necessary for contemplation, creativity and invention
in the pleasure of spectacular natural beauty.
The objective of INMOS is to build a viable
capability in the semiconductor industry through
research and discovery. The company is concentrating
on development of VLSI technology with initial devices
at a level of complexity of 50,000 to 100,000 transistors
per chip. INMOS plans to develop a broad range of
products in the memory and microcomputer areas.
We'll show you why INMOS is small enough
to offer you ample opportunity for rapid advancement,
yet with our plans for rapid growth, big enough to offer
the variety and visibility of a large corporation. We'll
describe how you'll be given considerable responsibilities
from the very first day. How you'll become immersed in
every phase of your department's operation-from the
birth of an idea to its final implementation. And how
we'll provide you with in depth, on-the-job training...
without making you sit in a classroom to get it. And how
you'll be working and rubbing elbows with some of the
acknowledged geniuses in the electronics field today.
We'll tell you how INMOS, unlike many
other compares, won't weigh you down under layers
of management-how you'll be given the authority to
make and carry out your own decisions. And we'll show
you how your ideas will get the attention they deserve
and the support they need to make them work.
There's just one catch. We can't tell you about
all these things- including our excellent starting salaries
and complete benefits package-unless you contact the
Placement Office to make an appointment to meet with
our technical specialists. And time is running out. So do
it today... and make it more than just another day.
If your resume is already prepared, rush it to
us now for early consideration prior to our campus visit,
or, if you are not available for an appointment but
would like further information write Denny Grady,
Employment Manager, PO. Box 16000, Colorado
Springs, Colorado 80935
Honoring human resources in every respect...
We are an equal opportunity employer.
