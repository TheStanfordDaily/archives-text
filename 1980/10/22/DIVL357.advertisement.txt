this year?
On campus career discussions with
Gould Inc., Research and Development
on October 29th
Gould Inc.'s engineers and scientists
have done it again. They've won three
prestigious IR-100 awards for 1980 —
given by Industrial Research and
Development Magazines to honor
research innovation and the most
significant new products, processes
and materials technology.
It's quite an accomplishment to win
just one of these awards. In
introducing Gould's three winners, the
magazine cited innovation
breakthroughs in developing a process
for recycling vulcanized rubber; in
pioneering a composite break lining
material; and creating a sophisticated
instrumentation recorder.

The Gould TA 600 Recorder offers major improvements over
competitive recorders and does away with moving pens.
This kind of bold corporate
commitment to Research and
Development creates an exciting
career future for engineers with
advanced degrees. We can offer you
opportunities to develop your talent in
our corporate laboratories. Our range
of technologies spans
electrochemistry, metallurgy,
electronics and electromechanics.
You can learn more about these
opportunities from the special Gould
Inc. technical representative coming to
your campus. Among the areas of
research you can explore are:
The Gould RN-20 ™ process for recycling vulcanized rubber
is being used by several elastomer product manufacturers.
At Gould inc., we're in the business of
breakthroughs. We've now won 12 of
these awards — as well as increasing
international recognition for our
achievements. As a $2 billion
electrical/electronics corporation, we
put a research emphasis on integrating
technical breakthroughs into new and
improved product and process
applications.

ELECTRONICS RESEARCH
Based in Gould Center in suburban
Chicago, this research facility
combines the latest equipment and
instrumentation with groundbreaking
research projects. Among the project
areas the lab is focusing its efforts on
now are developing new products for
the medical market, the space
program, electronic word processing,
industrial control and automation and
electric propulsion.
ENERGY RESEARCH
Also based in Gould Center, this group
is responsible for product, process and
systems development for various
electrochemical battery systems.
Included are the related technologies
and facilities necessary to analyze
materials, chargers, cell reactions,
applications and battery designs.
MATERIALS RESEARCH
From its Cleveland, Ohio base this
research area has a quarter century of
experience in key areas that include
powder metallurgy, iron and aluminum
casting alloys, electrochemistry as it
applies to electroforming and
electrodeposition, and polymer and
elastomer products.
If you're interested in the kinds of
challenges that we've talked about, and

The Gould TA 600 Recorder offers major improvements over
competitive recorders and does away with moving pens.
This kind of bold corporate
commitment to Research and
Development creates an exciting
career future for engineers with
advanced degrees. We can offer you
opportunities to develop your talent in
our corporate laboratories. Our range
of technologies spans
electrochemistry, metallurgy,
electronics and electromechanics.
You can learn more about these
opportunities from the special Gould
Inc. technical representative coming to
your campus. Among the areas of
research you can explore are:
The Gould RN-20 ™ process for recycling vulcanized rubber
is being used by several elastomer product manufacturers.
At Gould inc., we're in the business of
breakthroughs. We've now won 12 of
these awards — as well as increasing
international recognition for our

ELECTRICAL AND
ELECTRONICS RESEARCH
Based in Gould Center in suburban
Chicago, this research facility
combines the latest equipment and
instrumentation with groundbreaking
research projects. Among the project
areas the lab is focusing its efforts on
now are developing new products for
the medical market, the space
program, electronic word processing,
industrial control and automation and
electric propulsion.
ENERGY RESEARCH
Also based in Gould Center, this group
is responsible for product, process and
systems development for various
electrochemical battery systems.
Included are the related technologies
and facilities necessary to analyze
materials, chargers, cell reactions,
applications and battery designs.
MATERIALS RESEARCH
From its Cleveland, Ohio base this
research area has a quarter century of
experience in key areas that include
powder metallurgy, iron and aluminum
casting alloys, electrochemistry as it
applies to electroforming and
electrodeposition, and polymer and
elastomer products.
If you're interested in the kinds of
challenges that we've talked about, and
have the qualifications to take on
advanced research and development
work in your disciplines, Gould Inc.
