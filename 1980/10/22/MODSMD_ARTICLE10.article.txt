# Manila's violence destroys political unity
## 
### Washington Post 
Manila â€” A wave of terrorist bombings
that has rocked Manila has put a damper on
a nascent atmosphere of political accom
modation here and led to a new confronta
tion between President Ferdinand Marcos
and his increasingly frustrated political op
position.
Marcos publicly linked a prominent op
position leader to the bombings and was ac
cused. in turn, of "McCarthyism." The bit
ter exchange has soured Marcos' relations
with the opposition just as he was being giv
en credit for seriously wanting to patch up
old quarrels and open a dialogue.
Marcos. 63, has ruled the country for 14
years, the past eight of them under martial
law, to the growing irritation of former sen
ators and other political leaders who once
supported him.
Several of his most severe critics said
that they believed Marcos was moving
toward a genuine accommodation by offer
ing a dialogue and suggesting that he may
lift martial law next March.
Poison in the air
But the new exchanges related to the
bombings have poisoned the air and

prompted opposition leaders to reject the
peace offerings.
One person has been killed and 40 injured
in five bombings since late August and one
last December. Police have arrested at
least 10 suspects without publicly identi
fying them, and hinted that more arrests
will be made once further evidence is
gathered.
In one incident a Philippines-born Ameri
can businessman, Victor Lovely, was
critically wounded when a bomb he alleged
ly was working on blew up in his hotel room.
At a recent televised news conference,
Marcos showed a picture of Lovely, who is
under arrest as a suspected terrorist, with
former Sen. Jovito Salonga, a leading op
position figure once considered a likely
presidential candidate. Marcos did not spe
cifically accuse Salonga of complicity but
strongly implied he was under investigation
and could be arrested.
'McCarthyism'
Salonga angrily denied the implication,
accused Marcos of "McCarthyism," and
said the photo apparently was taken years
ago in the United States at a large social
gathering. He said he has never met anyone

named Victor Lovely.
Salonga himself has been the victim of po
litical terrorism. His right arm was shat
tered by an explosion during a political rally
in 1971."
In an interview last week Salonga ac
cused Marcos of attempting to use the inci
dent to taint his moderate opposition forces
with association with terrorism and destroy
their usefulness as a political alternative to
the Marcos regime.
Legitimized terrorism
"He is trying to confuse the terrorists
with the political opposition," Salonga said.
"This is very dangerous. It will end with
them legitimizing the terrorists."
Salong believes the bombers may be
friends and relatives of persons who have
been jailed in recent years for political ac
tivities. some of whom, he said, were tor
tured while in prison. He said the bombers
are people who have abandoned normal po
litical methods for terrorism out of frustra
tion with Marcos' refusal to end martial law
and provide for free, unrigged national elec
tions.
