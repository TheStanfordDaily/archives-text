But it it weren't for a special
student volunteer program in
the pediatric ward at the Medi

able to participate in the kinds
of recreational activities most
of his peers take for granted
Willy is a quadraplegic. con
fined nearly every waking hour
to a wheelchair.
Despite the adverse circum
stances. he looks forward to dai
ly playtime visits from a group
of 24 Stanford volunteer stu
dents who comprise a five-year
old program called Stanford
Aides.
While Willy lacks motor con
trol over his arms he is able to
play television games by blow
ing a stream of air through a
special straw
Even more important than
this non-human technical de
vice, however, is the human
one-to-one attention Stanford

Aides seeks to provide.
"The students are here as
special triends. not as pro
fessionals says Betty Love
lace. director of Pediatric I'lav
Therapy and program founder
Volunteers meet with pa
tients a minimum of three hours
a week at a regularly scheduled
time
The student-patient interac
tion takes place primarily in a
large, brightly lit rectangular
playroom, adjacent to an out
door patio. The playroom is
equipped with a pool table, nu
merous box games as well as the
Atari TV game hookup
Most of the patients are
adolescents recovering from
major surgery or suffering from
acute non-contagious diseases.
The student volunteers, how
ever. are expected to refrain
from questioning the children
on the nature of their illnesses.
"The students are here to re
late to the positive side of the
child.'' Lovelace stresses.
In keeping with this person
alized approach, says Lovelace,

volunteers do not wear uni
forms.
Patients have responded fa
vorably to the program because
personal interaction helps take
their minds off their confine
ment. according to junior pre
medical student Jeanette
Lacoste.
Kids are afraid of doctors
sticking needles in them and
nurses popping them pills,"
says Lacoste, now in her second
year as an Aide.
It is theraputic. she says, for
children to see "a friendly face
instead of a doctor or nurse.
Having someone there who
cares helps the children get well
a lot faster."
But perhaps the greatest ben
eficiaries of the program are
the volunteers themselves.
Says Lovelace. "Many of
these students in their future
profession will be working with
children in stressful situations.
This gives them a good back
ground in dealing with adoles
cents."
"I probably get more out of

the program than the children
do. says Lacoste
Danny Epner. who co-coordi
nates the program with fellow
junior Boh Maginini. agrees
Although Epner intends to
practice medicine, he insists
Stanford Aides is not simply a
program for pre-meds
Nothing can compare to "the
personal satisfaction and grat
ification which comes from
making kids feel good." says
Epner.
It provides me with a dif
ferent perspective-the human
side of medicine It takes me
awav from the chemistry,
anatomy and physics and re
minds me of what I'd like to do
10 years down the line." he said
For a non pre-med like junior
Dianne Look. Stanford Aides of
fers "a chance to get off campus
and out into the community to
interact with young kids. "
Look calls the program "ex
tremely rewarding in that "we
help the children feel like per
sons. to feel whole."
