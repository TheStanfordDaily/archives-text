## Author emphasizes use of Christian ethics 
### Lane Webster 
The pressures of modern social life are
deforming American churches "like a
boa constrictor squeezing you in its
coils.'' said British author Os Guinness
during a three-night lecture series on
Christian faith in the modern world The
series took place last week, and was
sponsored by campus Christian or
ganizations.
Guinness. who recently completed a
documentary for British television on
the political power of evangelical Chris
tians in America, told an audience of
more than 300 people at Kresge
Auditorium that at a time when America
is decisive in the world, the evangelical
church can be decisive in America.
He said the central issues of the '60s
dealt mainly with institutions, while

those in the '70s focused on individual
identity and lifestyle.
In the '80s. Guinness said, the main is
sues will be justice in international rela
tions and stewardship in managing re
sources.
The challenge for the churches, he
stated, is to overcome their incapacity to
influence much that goes on in public
life. According to Guinness, who is cur
rently studying for his doctorate in the
philosophy of religion at Oxford Univer
sity, this incapacity has existed since
scriptural principles were banished
from modern society and replaced by
technology and economics.
This dwindling of the influence of
biblical truth on modern principles and
procedures in business, government and
the professions was defined by Guinness

as "privatization of religion.'' It causes
Christians to apply the teaching of scrip
ture only to private matters of family
and personal morality, he said
"Instead of being a grea* overarching
sacred canopy. Christianity becomes a
small folding umbrella." declared Guin
ness.
He contrasted this attitude with the
activating principle of Abraham Kuvper.
a Dutch journalist and politician at the
turn of the century who founded the Free
University in Amsterdam.
Kuvper's belief, said Guinness, was
that "there is not an inch of any sphere of
human life over which Jesus Christ the
Lord does not say, 'Mine.' "
While advocating the extension of
Christian principles into the public
sphere. including politics, Guinness

nonetheless criticized the proponents of
evangelical right-wing politics.
The "negative tactics" of American
evangelical conservatives, "impunging"
the families anil the faith of liberal politi
cians. are "really disgusting." he said.
He pointed out that when Christianity is
equated with a right wing agenda, "the
Gospel becomes hostage."
Guinness added although he disap
proves of the reactionary tone of the con
servatives. he nonetheless shares some
of their concerns, such as the need to op
pose abortion.
He advised his listeners to emulate the
Old Testament prophet Amos, or the
more recent example of John Wesley or
William Wilberforce. the opponent of
slavery, if they attempt to reassert
Christian thinking in modern life.
