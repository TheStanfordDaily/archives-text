'It's all bullshit.' — Radio ad for Citizens Party
candidate Barry Commoner.
Those familiar with the controversial career of
Barry Commoner, biologist turned solar energy
Socialist, are unlikely to be shocked by the latest
scatalogical turn in his sorry campaign to be pres
ident. Such is the tragedy of a scientist whose po
litical prejudices long ago got the best of his scien
tific integrity.
Even in his early days as a biologist, Commoner
earned an unenviable reputation among his col
leagues for coming off half-cocked and stretching
the evidence to fit his own preconceptions.
In his first popular book, The Closing Circle, he
tried to argue that the ecological problem was pri
marily due to pollution, not population or develop
ment,insinuating that it was corporations, not the
people, who were to blame.
The shoddy quality of Commoner's argument
drew fire from such knowledgeable scientists as
Stanford's Prof. Paul Ehrlich, who accused him
of misrepresentations, distortions, over
simplification and downright "bad ecology.
Scientific pretense
Undaunted. Commoner subsequently plunged
into energy policy where his scientific pretense
quickly outstripped his expertise. Like too many
self-appointed energy pundits, Commoner came
under the illusion that he had discovered a single
solution to the energy crisis that was somehow
uniquelv best for the nation.
In his book, The Politics of Energy, Commoner
outlines a bizarre and ambitious energy plan,
based entirely on decentralized solar technolo
gies, notably photovoltaic cells, gasohol and
methane from biomass.
These are only a few of the economic, concep
tual and technical flaws in Commoner's scheme.
At every point, he makes the most optimistic pos
sible assumptions about his favorite technologies,
while deriding everything else. He attacks fusion
for being unproven. but offers a transition plan
that requires more natural gas than the highest
current resource estimates.
He repeatedly fails to take account of economic
costs. At one point he proposes to run the nation's
streetlights from solar cells — a scheme which
one expert has calculated would cost $2 trillion.
In light of such defects. Commoner's energy
plan has become a laughing stock among serious

energy analysts, including many staunch ad
vocates of solar energy. Nevertheless, so sure is
Commoner that his plan is the answer that he pro
poses. if elected, to impose it on the rest of us by
an ill-defined system of socialist planning which
he calls "social governance."
He assures us that this will be necessary be
cause the big corporations are too intent on mak
ing a profit to invest in cheap, efficient solar
energy, preferring instead to waste their money
on expensive, wasteful fossil and nuclear alter
natives.
How inefficiency can be more profitable Com
moner doesn't explain, as he is ignorant of any ec
onomics beyond vulgar Marxism. Commoner is in
fact capable of blunders that would have him
flunked in Econ 1. He argues that any combination
of solar and nuclear energy would be more ex
pensive than an all-solar or all-nuclear energy
system. The opposite is the case, as is obvious
from considering the vastly different energy situ
ations in places such as Minnesota and Florida, or
Arizona and Alaska.
Huckster
Nonsense of this magnitude might be excusable
in an ordinary political huckster, but in Com
moner's case it is compounded by fraudulent sci
entific pretensions. Speaking at a gathering of the
American Association of the Advancement for
Science, Commoner recently tried to argue the
curious fallacy that energy prices rise exponen
tially, a proposition for which there happens to be
no basis in either economic theory or fact.
Pressed on this point, he first evaded the ques
tion. then pretended to have meant something dif
ferent, then fraudulently misrepresented the re
sults of another study to support his argument.
Commoner's case is especially depressing be
cause he happens to have enlisted not a few sin
cere. friendly and honest people into his cam
paign. Unfortunately, the idealism of the Citizens
Party members does not make up for the sleazy
dishonesty of its leading candidate. It is not too
late to hope that some of them will see through
Commoner's demagogy before wasting their
votes on what is in so many ways the biomass of
history.
