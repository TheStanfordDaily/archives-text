Bicycle caution
While Humanities and
Philosophy Professor Emeritus
Jeffrey Smith may have cap
tured the carpe diem spirit of
the Stanford cyclist ("Cyclist
Malaise." the Daily, Oct. 14), I
think he fails to apprehend the
real danger to those of us who
must traverse the Stanford
campus daily.
In the four weeks since my ar
rival on the Farm. I have come
to realize that it is the unsuspec
ting Stanford pedestrian who re
ally has cause to fear — from
Prof. Smith's "bright, young
cyclist," tearing around Old Un
ion at 25 mph. an oblivious
projectile of jagged steel and
aluminum with the potential to
inflict great damage on us
slower-moving vessels of mere
flesh and blood.
Walking through the Quad at
8:55 in the morning is like
playing the video game
"Asteroids." The idea is to
adroitly maneuver yourself
among the hurtling shapes of 10-
speed bicycles (not to mention
the lesser obstacles of buildings
and other pedestrians), often

facing the last-minute dilemma
of whether to jump aside from
an onrushing Univega, or trust
that the cyclist will divert his at
tention from an engaging halter
top in time to steer around you.
If Stanford is to remain a bi
cycle school (as it shows every
sign of doing), certain rules ap
plying to bicycle traffic on cam
pus walkways should be estab
lished without further delay.
Perhaps marked bicycle lanes
from the Quad and fountain to
Tresidder (the so-called Hoover
Triangle) would help to relieve
the morning rush-hour traffic;
or at the very least, strict
adherence to a right-side-of-the
path rule, so that cyclists keep
to the right in both directions
and pedestrians can walk in the
center. If worse comes to
worse, a bicycle speed limit of
10 mph might be tried.
Of course, as a daily bicycle
commuter myself, I'm guilty of
a terrible hypocrisy — in fact,
I'm just as likely as anyone else
to come roaring around the His
tory Corner two minutes before
a class. Nevertheless, I have no
wish to die an ignoble death un
der the front tire of a rusty and

dilapidated Schwinn, so I urge
the Daily to take action to al
leviate this problem.

Pedestrian needs
If you expect more than a few
cyclists on campus to accom
modate themselves to the needs
of pedestrians, forget it. I have
worked on campus for 14 years
fearing for life and limb every
time I take a walk. It is a ques
tion of thoughtfulness, which is
something that must be learned
in the cradle or it never will be
learned. As for signalling as he
approaches a pedestrian from
the rear, haven't you noticed the
pleasure that many cyclists
take in doing so silently and giv
ing one a real fright as he scoots
by inches away? The code
should be that of the water : the
slower moving object should
have the right of way. Let the
more maneuverable person (the
cyclist) be aware that the pe
destrian cannot get out of the
way quickly, and extend him the
courtesy of a signal and a rela

tively wide berth so as to pre
vent a collision. Meantime,
walk defensively and expect to
be run down unless you are con
stantly on guard. Lots of luck.

That's absurd
There seems to be something
wrong with Randy Broberg's
article "Drastic change
needed" (Daily, Oct. 16). He
spends most of the article point
ing out the faults of the Carter
administration (not a very dif
ficult task), and he then draws
the seemingly inescapable con
clusion that Ronald Reagan
should be the next president of
the United States.
In case Broberg hasn't heard,
Ed Clark, John Anderson and
Barry Commoner all happen to
be running for the same office
as is Ronald Reagan. Perhaps
Broberg would benefit from
some time spent studying the
rules of reductio ad absurdum.

A real future
The article (the Daily, Oct.
16) entitled "Drastic change
needed" does not call for change
at all but voices instead the
most reactionary views around.
The author longs to live his life
"in pursuit of the American
Dream as so many generations
had before."
He is upset over the fact that
"the 'starting salary of $23,000'
so many Stanford students are
fond of planning on will soon
mean very little," and wishes it
were worth as much as it used to
be. He follows the theme of his
preferred candidates, Reagan-
Bush, which is "Let's make
America great again." He does
not want change but to bring
back a past which, because of
the current world situation, can
no longer exist.
He is not aware that too many
people, all over the globe, do not
make $230 per year, a hundreth
of the $23,000 that the Stanford
student no longer finds satisfac
tory. He does not realize that
what makes the American life
style "great" is our exploitation
of the world's resources. The
new self-awareness sweeping
over the Third World no longer
makes this possible (e.g. Viet
nam, Nicaragua, Iran).
He worries of "the danger of
impending war" but does not
understand that it is conflict
over these resources (e.g. con
trol of the Middle East oil)
which stands the best chance of
causing that war. He condemns
SALT 11, the first step towards
controlling suicidal nuclear
madness, and wants instead to
put backbone into the "spineless
paper tiger" so that we will con
tinue to have the muscle to pro
tect our over-inflated life style.
It is the "American Dream"
which must change. It must be
come a "world dream" of in
ternational freedoms, of an in
ternational right to the pursuit
of happiness, of international
brotherhood. In light of the su
per-destructiveness of nuclear
warheads this is the only path to
a real future.
