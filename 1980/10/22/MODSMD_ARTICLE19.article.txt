## John Kelly Fond remembrances of Ronnie 
### 
nt's really not the end — it's
the beginning, and let's not
make it a campaign but a
crusade." — Ronald Reagan at
the Ambassador Hotel in Los
Angeles upon winning the Cali
fornia Primary.
Time passes quickly ... it
must have been 10 years ago
now. From the shadows at the
edge of a pre-political
adolescence. Ronald Reagan,
the newly re-elected governor of
the great state of California,
stepped forth into the center
stage of my consciousness. Ron
nie appeared in the flesh to
speak and smile. Now I read
again about how he speaks and

smiles, opening every
statement with the polyphonic
"Well-la." Well, indeed. Is it
worth remembering?
Ronnie walked to the podium
from the rear of the gym
nasium. Like a true prophet of
the filmmaker's approach to
politics, he strode forward with
polished ease and a warming
smile. I wish I could remember
what he said now. but his figure
obviously left more of an im
pression than his words.
I recall his bantering and
chattering, and his throwing out
of one-liners as he anticipated a
rise from the crowd. The au
dience of eager high school stu

dents remained silent, though.
Would the silence persist? Ron
nie knew it was best to avoid del
icate commentary on the war,
or the surgical belt-tightening to
be performed on the state wel
fare programs, so like the old
pro that he was, he looked for
more amusing material.
"Well," (here I shall para
phrase) "Well, maybe I should
tell you all about how I came
here. You know this is the first
high school that I have visited
during my administration, and I
thought you should know the
story behind my visit. Your stu
dent body president, Mike
Sandel, who so kindly in
troduced me, had been trying to
contact me through my press
secretary for weeks about
speaking here at Pali.
"I was too busy to respond
personally to these inquiries,
but Mike finally resorted to a
tactic that left me speechless.
He found out from someone,
who it was I still don't know,
that I have a fondness for jelly
beans, and about two weeks ago
a beautiful jar of black jelly
beans, my favorites, was de
posited on the front door of my
home here in the Palisades. I
was overcome and I immediate
ly instructed my press secre
tary to arrange this meeting be
tween us."
Ronnie gleamed to the crowd.
It was so clear that this simple
tale'of industrious scheming on
Sandel's part was supposed to

win us over and still so obvious
that the governor had not yet
succeeded. But later there was
one more trick.
"I would also like to announce
that I shall not be seeking re
election."
The room erupted. These
were the words that we were
waiting to hear. The dissatisfac
tion of a generation of students
that had tagged along following
their older sisters and brothers
make the tough choices was re
duced in the crucible of Re
agan's rhetoric to brilliant ap
plause.
Ronnie smiled. He had finally
gotten a rise out of us. And even
though he might have been
speaking of the Senate seat, or
another term as governor,
there's no doubt that he lied. But
we were taken in by him. He re
ally did know how to act.
Or maybe Ronnie spoke the
truth. If not a campaign, but a
crusade, then not an election,
but an installation. Like the guv
said, those black jellybeans are
tasty. With sweet palliatives
and placebos, and a beautiful
bedside manner, the nation may
soon have an older and more
statesmanlike Marcus Welby to
attend to its political ills. The
country likes Westerns and fun
ny men riding high in the saddle.
We want a leader. Let's have a
coronation.
(John Kelly is a student in the
law school.)
