# Panel to examine concerns
## Value of teaching evaluations questioned 
### Kim Brown 
A complex controversy concerning
the current system of student eval
uations of professors has been grow
ing quietly during recent weeks. The
controversy deals with delicate ques
tions to which there are no easy an
swers.
During informal remarks at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting Oct. 2, Ralph
Phillips, an emeritus professor of
mathematics, said he believes student
evaluation of teaching at Stanford
should be discontinued.
He admitted the evaluation of his
own class "wasn't so hot." and also
that his department's overall eval
uation was "fairly low."
Yet Phillips asserted "there's very
little evidence that student evaluation
has very much to do with teaching."
During the last week of every quar
ter. students are handed computerized
questionnaires from the A SSU Course
Guide and instructed to rate various
aspects of their courses in the general
areas of "instructor performance."
"course contribution," "instructor
relationship." "course planning," and
"overall satisfaction." Students are
also encouraged to write additional
comments on the back of the form.
The evaluations are tabulated by
computer and sent to the instructor
along with a comparative analysis.
During the next few years, the Sub-
Committee on the Evaluation and Im
provement of Teaching (SC-EIT) will
be conducting a major review of the
evaluation system. It will make a for
mal report to the senate in 1983.
The committee will face a number
of related concerns as they analyze the
evaluation process:
— Do students have the "right" to
evaluate professors?
— Do evaluations poison or
strengthen the relationship between
students and teachers''
Should evaluations be used solelv

as a teaching aid: or should they be re
printed for the department, the ad
ministration. and the ASSU Course
Guide?
— How valid are the evaluations
and how much weight should thev be
given?
In a recent interview. Phillips said.
"I don't think students are in a posi
tion to judge whether they've been
taught well or not — especially in a
subject like mathematics, where they
may not have the perspective and
grasp to evaluate an instructor."
He maintaiped that his ratings
ranged considerably. "Many students
are required to take courses in the
Math Department, and then they voice
their resentment by retaliating on the
evaluation form," he said
Academic Secretary Eric
Hutchinson said. "Students are per
fectly capable of making sound

judgements based on their own view
points."
They can effectively evaluate an in
structor's technique, conscientious
ness, and availability, he said. "Yet
there are other criteria a student, can I
possibly know about."
Sue Voorvart, current editor of the
ASSU Cimrse Guide, pinpointed at
least one serious problem within the
overall procedure.
She said the problem stems from
the way the actual time given for fill
ing out the evaluations is handled.
Many times, said Voorvart, an in
structor will simply pass out the forms
and tell everyone to bring them back
the next day.
"It's important to instill a sense of
responsibility on the part of the pro
fessors." she said. "At the same time,
it's important to instill that same re
sponsibility on the part of the stu
dents."

Some people question the validity of
the forms themselves. According to
Mathematics Prof. Samuel Karlin, a
survey should be completely ignored if
the response is less than 75 percent,
because certain biases will inevitably
come through.
"When only half of the people are
responding, who is really respond
ing"?" Karlin asked. Pointing out there
is no way of knowing for certain, he es
timated dissatisfied students are
more likely to reply than the en
thusiastic.
Most people involved in the process,
however, seemed to believe that even
though the raw scores may not be en
tirely significant, their trend over
time can depict meaningful patterns.
The majority of faculty and admin
istration contacted, whether they ap
prove of the system or not, agree that
student evaluations are valuable, but
said they should be supplemented by
other means. Many cited peer eval
uations as a viable addition to the
present system

least one serious problem within the
overall procedure.
She said the problem stems from
the way the actual time given for fill
ing out the evaluations is handled.
Many times, said Voorvart, an in
structor will simply pass out the forms
and tell everyone to bring them back
the next day.
"It's important to instill a sense of
responsibility on the part of the pro
fessors." she said. "At the same time,
it's important to instill that same re
sponsibility on the part of the stu
dents."

Some people question the validity of
the forms themselves. According to
Mathematics Prof. Samuel Karlin, a
survey should be completely ignored if
the response is less than 75 percent,
because certain biases will inevitably
come through.
"When only half of the people are
responding, who is really respond
ing"?" Karlin asked. Pointing out there
is no way of knowing for certain, he es
timated dissatisfied students are
more likely to reply than the en
thusiastic.
Most people involved in the process,
however, seemed to believe that even
though the raw scores may not be en
tirely significant, their trend over
time can depict meaningful patterns.
The majority of faculty and admin
istration contacted, whether they ap
prove of the system or not, agree that
student evaluations are valuable, but
said they should be supplemented by

A complex controversy concerning
the current system of student eval
uations of professors has been grow
ing quietly during recent weeks. The
controversy deals with delicate ques
tions to which there are no easy an
swers.
During informal remarks at a Fac
ulty Senate meeting Oct. 2, Ralph
Phillips, an emeritus professor of
mathematics, said he believes student
evaluation of teaching at Stanford
should be discontinued.
He admitted the evaluation of his
own class "wasn't so hot." and also
that his department's overall eval
uation was "fairly low."
Yet Phillips asserted "there's very
little evidence that student evaluation
has very much to do with teaching."
During the last week of every quar
ter. students are handed computerized
questionnaires from the A SSU Course
Guide and instructed to rate various
aspects of their courses in the general
areas of "instructor performance."
"course contribution," "instructor
relationship." "course planning," and
"overall satisfaction." Students are
also encouraged to write additional
comments on the back of the form.
The evaluations are tabulated by
computer and sent to the instructor
along with a comparative analysis.
During the next few years, the Sub-
Committee on the Evaluation and Im
provement of Teaching (SC-EIT) will
be conducting a major review of the
evaluation system. It will make a for
mal report to the senate in 1983.
The committee will face a number
of related concerns as they analyze the
evaluation process:
— Do students have the "right" to
evaluate professors?
— Do evaluations poison or
strengthen the relationship between
students and teachers''
Should evaluations be used solelv

as a teaching aid: or should they be re
printed for the department, the ad
ministration. and the ASSU Course
Guide?
— How valid are the evaluations
and how much weight should thev be
given?
In a recent interview. Phillips said.
"I don't think students are in a posi
tion to judge whether they've been
taught well or not — especially in a
subject like mathematics, where they
may not have the perspective and
grasp to evaluate an instructor."
He maintaiped that his ratings
ranged considerably. "Many students
are required to take courses in the
Math Department, and then they voice
their resentment by retaliating on the
evaluation form," he said
Academic Secretary Eric
Hutchinson said. "Students are per
fectly capable of making sound

judgements based on their own view
points."
They can effectively evaluate an in
structor's technique, conscientious
ness, and availability, he said. "Yet
there are other criteria a student, can I
possibly know about."
Sue Voorvart, current editor of the
ASSU Cimrse Guide, pinpointed at
least one serious problem within the
overall procedure.
She said the problem stems from
the way the actual time given for fill
ing out the evaluations is handled.
Many times, said Voorvart, an in
structor will simply pass out the forms
and tell everyone to bring them back
