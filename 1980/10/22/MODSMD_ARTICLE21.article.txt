Tuskegee, Ala. (AP) â€” National Urban League
President Vernon Jordan, delivering his first
speech since he was shot in the back last May,
urged blacks Sunday night to wield "the political
power of our numbers" by voting in the presiden
tial election.
Jordan did not formally endorse President Jim
my Carter, but he said Republican nominee
Ronald Reagan's economic policies "are not like
ly to win over many black voters."
He also dismissed independent candidate John
Anderson as an ineffective alternative and
warned that "the most damaging course for all
black interests" would be not to vote at all.
Jordan, addressing about 1000 people, chose
Tuskegee Institute's chapel as the site for his first
address since he was shot last May 29 in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
"It is important to me that my first public
speech since last May take place in my native

South, on a black college campus, talking to young
black people who are our future hope," said Jor
dan.
He said Tuskegee Institute, founded 100 years
ago by Booker T. Washington, "is a symbol for
black America. It represents a light of learning,
hope and achievement in the dark forest of racism
and despair."
He noted that during the night after he was shot
he was taken into surgery and "A team of black
and white doctors and nurses was working togeth
er to save my life. They were led by a young black
surgeon educated at a black college."
He said one of the telegrams he received after
surgery "came from Montgomery, Ala., and it
read:
"i was shocked and saddened to learn of your
injury. I am praying for your complete recovery
and I am thankful that your life was spared.'
"That wire was signed 'George C. Wallace.'"
