# Women learn street assertiveness
## 
### 
Madison, Wis. (AP) — She is
Any Woman, and as she walks
along a city street — any street
— a man makes an offensive re
mark about her body.
She has three basic options.
She can fix her gaze on the side
walk and rush on, pretending
she hasn't heard. She can spit
out her own obscene remark or
gesture.
Or she can walk up to the
man, look him in the eye and —
in a voice loud enough for
bystanders to hear — deliver a
stock response she learned in a
street assertiveness workshop:
"I don't like the remark you
made. You are trying to degrade
me. I want you to stop it."
Men who make remarks
about women's bodies often de
fend their comments as terms
of appreciation. Many women
regard such remarks — and
stronger, obscene comments —
as public harassment, and the
course Nancy Newton is devis
ing at the Dane County Project
on Rape is designed to deal with
it.
"For too long, women have
had to walk on streets as if they
were walking through enemy
territory. It's like a war zone,"
she said.
"For a woman to be as
sertive, she has to believe
(harassment) has got to stop.
It's a way of fighting back in a
way that's non-violent and
(makes) vou feel good about
yourself."

She said she believes street
harassment will drop dramati
cally if women respond as
sertively and men can no longer
count on women reacting pas
sively.
It isn't easy to learn. Women
aren't used to being assertive.
Especially on public streets,
toward strange men.
A woman harassed in public
has a choice of three responses,
she said: aggressive, timid or
assertive.
An aggressive response —
name-calling or an obscene
gesture — could backfire, turn

ing an insult into violence. But a
timid response — hurrying
away in embarrassment — may
be as bad. Either anger or em
barrassment can show a man he
has hit his mark.
"A lot of people say, 'Why say
anything? Why not just hurry
on, do what you've always
done?' That doesn't necessarily
protect you," Newton said.
"You're giving 'victim signals.'
You've just given him a lot of
signals you may be easy prey.
There are a lot of rapists who
walk around looking for a vie-

Tim, testing out a victim."
Street assertiveness includes
gauging potential violence in a
situation and walking away if
necessary, she said But
basically, she added, an as
sertive response delivered in a
strong voice and backed up with
a confident stance shows the
woman is willing to defend her
territory and makes the man
publicly accountable for his ac
tions.
"You've embarrassed him.
I've been in situations where
nearby people applauded," she
said.
