# Economic slump ends
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The economy rebounded solidly
during the third quarter of this year, surpassing
Carter administration expectations and convinc
ing the Department of Commerce's chief econo
mist Friday that the recession is over.
The gross national product, the measure of to
tal output of goods and services, grew at an annual
rate of 1 percent during July, August and Septem
ber, compared with a decline of 9.6 percent during
the second quarter. The second quarter drop had
equalled the worst on record, during 1974-75.
"The preliminary GNP estimates offer strong
evidence of the resumption of economic growth, "
said Courtenay Slater, chief economist at the De
partment of Commerce — a development that, if
true, would give a lift to the Carter election cam
paign,
But at just about the time the department re
leased its figures, along with a report that housing
starts increased during August for the fourth con
secutive month, several major banks raised their

prime interest rate to 14 percent.
"That casts a shadow over the next six
months," said Otto Eckstein, president of Data
Resources Inc., an economic forecasting com
pany. "The recession is over, no question about
that. The question now is when the next one is
coming. But we don't expect it to start right
away."
Aside from the increased interest rates, the
GNP report was another in a series that seemed to
indicate the economic slump was over, even if re
covery will be slow and modest, and inflation and
unemployment remain relatively high. The gov
ernment's index of economic indicators increased
a record 4.6 percent in July and industrial prod
uction reversed a six-month decline in August and
rose half a percent.
Last month, the Department of Commerce
economist, Slater, said that she expected the GNP
to show an increase when Friday's figures were
announced. Other administration and private
economists remained more pessimistic.
