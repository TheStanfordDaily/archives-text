## The 						old gray guard ain't what he used to be 
### 
I was slightly overweight,
and considerably out of
shape. I hadn't played in two
weeks Nevertheless, when
head coach Dick Dißiaso
held tryouts for "walk-on"
basketball candidates last
Wednesday night at Maples
Pavilion, I was there with
Nikes tightly laced.
Twenty-four other zealots,
several of whom I recognized
from previous basketball

Commentary

battles on the outdoor courts
between Wilbur and Stern
Halls, were also present.
Most of us came for three
reasons: first, we like
playing ball; second, we like
playing against good com
petition; finally, we knew
that good competition would
be available at this trvout
A few people, though, dis
played either grim visages or
tight grins of anticipation.
These were the guys who se
riously wanted to make the
team. "What the hell are
they here for 9 " I grumbled
to myself. "All they'll do is
ruin the fun."
My thoughts were inter
rupted by Dißiaso, who com
manded everybody to join
him at the mid-court circle.
It was shortly after 8:30 p.m.
Dressed in black slacks and
shoes, with his shirt open to
reveal a gold chain, the
coach looked more fit for a
disco full of nubile females
than a gymnasium full of T
shirted post-adolescents.
Dißiaso graciously
greeted us by thanking us ail
for taking the time to try out.
After some additional pleas
antries, he got down to busi
ness.
"I'm looking down at most

of you," observed Dißiaso,
who stands around 6-foot-5.
This statement chilled us,
until Dißiaso added that he
was looking for one or two
guards — that is, quick
players shorter than 6-5.
Dißiaso informed us that
past tryouts had lasted any
where from half-an-hour to
two hours. Tonight, he said,
we would play until he and
his panel of assistant
coaches had either selected a
golden boy or deemed all of
us unfit for the varsity ranks.
We then split into two
groups and went through
basic lay-up drills to loosen
our limbs. This provided us
with time not only for warm
ing up, but also for eval
uating each other. Actually,
lay-up drills prove very little
— although if a righthander
has trouble dribbling left
handed, or vice-versa, you
know he's kind of a sack.
Between lay-ups. I concen
trated on examining not the
abilities of my mates, but
their personalities. Just by
looking at people's shirts
("Tumbleweed Tech,"
"Stanford Crew," "Watts
Summer Games 1977"), I de
cided that everybody, myself
included, had a substantial
amount of the "jock" in him.
whether dumb, frustrated or
otherwise.
One gentleman, though,
was wearing Ocean Pacific
shorts, an unthinkable act for
any self-respecting basket
ball player. After all. you're
not supposed to sweat in
OP's. "Who is this guv?" I
asked myself.
After we warmed up, as
sistant coach Tim Miller
divided us into five five-man
teams. Each team would
play each other for a few

minutes at a time My squad
included two young men I
didn't know, one whom I re
membered as an outdoor
court stalwart, and ... the
guy in the OP shorts.
We watched two other
teams play for about seven

minutes. The game featured
all the rhythm and grace of a
roller derby match. This can
be expected when 10 over
eager players try to forsake
finesse for flashiness in or
der to impress the coach.
Dißiaso was so impressed
that he stopped the affair,
gathered everybody around
him and implored us to play
as if it were a pickup game,
not a controlled scrimmage
with pads.
As my team took the court
for its first game, I prayed
that I wouldn't embarrass
myself. Obviously God was
wearing earplugs.

At least I didn't start
screwing up immediately.
My first shot, a 20-footer,
went through the hoop Re
maining cool, I ran back to
play defense. Had I known
what was to follow, I would
have continued running — all

the way back home
In the second game I
played. I masterfully soared
for a rebound. Seeing that my
opponents were slow to get
back on defense, I charged
downcourt on a fastbreak. I
pulled up, shot — and the ball
caromed off the front rim.
Later in the game I
stormed after a loose ball,
justifying the reputation I
had gained in high school as a
hustling (i.e. mediocre but
hard-working) player. I
grabbed the ball, saw a team
mate downcourt and fired a
baseball pass. Well, I played
baseball in high school too,

and anybody who saw me in
action will tell you that I
throw about as well as a
quadraplegic. My pass died
sickeningly in an opponent's
grasp.
Not only were my skills
deserting me, but my body
was also. After the first
game I felt a nagging pain in
my right side, as if little
munchkins were jabbing me
with tiny needles. "A
cramp," I told myself. "Ig
nore it." By the end of the
evening, however, the
munchkins had been re
placed by dinosaurs gnawing
at my torso. This was a big
league cramp.
At about 10 p.m. Dißiaso
again invited us to join him
at mid-court, ending the ses
sion. Again he thanked us for
trying out, and gravely in
formed us that he would al
low 10 players to remain 30
minutes for further scrutiny,
performing drills that would
ultimately reflect their true
talents. Needless to say, I
wasn't one of the 10.
I started to leave Maples,
feeling tired but happy — for
above all, playing basketball
is fun. But before I walked
out the door, I stole a glance
at the 10 survivors. They
were performing a simple
dribbling drill, one that I had
done many times in high
school.
Something I thought
wouldn't happen did: frus
tration set in. I was better
than a lot of those guys. I
didn't show it that night, but I
knew that at my best, I could
outplay them any day, any
time.
Cursing myself, I walked
out of the gym. I guess like
hope, pride springs eternal,
too.

This is where Chris Haft belongs when there's a basketball game at
Maples Pavilion — in the stands. Haft proved at last Wednesday's
basketball tryouts that he certainly doesn't belong on the court.
