Philadelphia (AP) - The Phila
delphia Phillies, behind the
pitching of Steve Carlton and
Tug McGraw and the hitting of
Mike Schmidt, won the first
world championship in their 98-
year history last night, beating
Kansas City 4-1 to end the 1980
World Series in six games.
Carlton allowed the Ameri
can League champion Royals
only four hits until he was re
lieved by McGraw in the eighth.
He was working with five days'
rest.
The crafty left-hander zipped
through the Kansas City batting
order with ease, striking out
seven and staying in control
throughout the early and middle
innings before giving way to
McGraw. The Royals failed to
mount an effective attack until
the eighth, but their lone run
then was too little, too late.
Kansas City threatened again
in the ninth, loading the bases
with one out. but once again
McGraw rose to the challenge
and preserved the victory.
A capacity crowd of 65.838 —
largest to watch a World Series
game in 16 years — kept up a
steady roar which mounted in

intensity as the Phillies closed
in on the title.
The heroes were Carlton, the
ace of the Phillies staff, and
Schmidt, named the Series Most
Valuable Player.
Carlton, the silent southpaw
who approaches his task in a
workmanlike fashion, gave no
hint of weariness through seven
innings. Then, when the Royals
got their first two batters on
base in the eighth. Manager
Dallas Green brought in his
bullpen ace, McGraw. His sea
son's work done after 331 in
nings, Carlton left to a huge roar
from the crowd.
McGraw got Frank White on a
popup but walked Willie Wilson,
loading the bases. U.L. Wash
ington's sacrifice fly made it
4-1. then George Brett beat out
an infield single, loading the
bases again. The count went to
3-2 on designated hitter Hal
Mcßae. but McGraw ended the
tension by getting Mcßae on a
grounder to second.
McGraw. who doesn't seem
to want to make it look easy,
loaded the bases again in the
ninth before finally shutting
down the Royals and bringing

the Philadelphia fans to their
feet in a wild celebration as a
couple of hundred riot-equipped
Philadelphia police — some
with German shepherds — stood
on the field.
Schmidt, whose 48 home runs
and 121 runs batted in during the
regular season led the National
League, shot the Phillies in
front in the third inning.
Bob Boone opened the inning
with a walk on four pitches from
Kansas City starter Rich Gale.
Lonnie Smith grounded to sec
ond. but both runners were safe
when White's throw pulled
Washington off the base on an
attempted force play.
Then Pete Rose came up with
the Royals thinking bunt for the
first couple of pitches. With the
count 3-1, third baseman Brett
pulled back — and that's when
Rose dumped a bunt single to
load the bases
Schmidt was next, and he
ripped a single to right for two
runs and a lead the Phillies
would never surrender. Re
liever Renie Martin escaped
any further damage that inning,
but in the fifth Philadelphia
came back for more.

Smith led off and hustled a
routine single to center into a
double. He moved to third on
Rose's fly bail and came home
on a grounder by Bake Mcßride,
making it 3-0.
In the sixth, the Phillies
added another run, this time
with two out. Larry Bowa
doubled to the left-field corner
and raced home on Bob Boone's
single.
All the Phillies had to do was
hold onto the lead. And they did.
With the fans at a fever pitch,
roaring on every throw,
McGraw set about his task in
the ninth.
Amos Otis, who finished with
11 hits, was first and went down
on strikes. Next it was Willie
Aikens. who had a pair of two
homer games earlier in the
series. The count went to 3-2 and
Aikens drew a walk.
John Wathan followed with a
single to right. That brought up
Jose Cardenal. the potential
tying run. Cardenal won the
showdown with a single to cen
ter. loading the bases.
White popped a ball in front of
the Phillies' dugout. Boone and
Rose both closed in on it. At the

last moment, it popped out of
the catcher's mitt — and into
the first baseman's glove.
That made it two out, and
with scores of police circling the
field, McGraw finished it off
with a flourish, striking out
Wilson.
