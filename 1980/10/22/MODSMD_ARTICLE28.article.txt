## Titinger's hat trick leads Cards to rout 
### 
Jorge Titinger's hat trick paced a consistent, confident effort as
Stanford's soccer team defeated Sacramento State yesterday, 8-0,
at Harry Maloney Field.
Bouncing back from Sunday's heartbreaking 3-2 loss to Fresno
State, the Cardinals cleared their bench against the relatively weak
Hornets, a NCAA Division II team.
Two aspects of the Cards' play especially pleased head coach
Nelson Lodge: their effectiveness outside shooting and the assured
play of the freshmen and substitutes.
Titinger's three-goal performance was just one solid effort
turned in by a freshman. Lodge said that first-year midfielder
Walter Kingson controlled his area well.
Other Cards to find the nets included Howard Sewell, who scored
two goals, and Willie Giucci, who tallied the game's first goal with
22:44 elapsed in the first half.
Neil Tennyson and Jim Witham also scored for Stanford, which
improves its overall record to 6-9-1.
