Philadelphia (AP) — "I'm in
a coma," said Mike Schmidt,
the Most Valuable Player in the
1980 World Series.
Schmidt, the Philadelphia
Phillies third baseman, de

Commenting on his selection

were at least six guys on this
club who could have won. I prob

knocked in the winning runs."
The most excited and verbal
player in the room was short
