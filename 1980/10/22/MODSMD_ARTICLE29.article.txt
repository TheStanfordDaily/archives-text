# 'Us smug Phillies are champs'

Philadelphia (AP) — "I'm in
a coma," said Mike Schmidt,
the Most Valuable Player in the
1980 World Series.
Schmidt, the Philadelphia
Phillies third baseman, de
livered the decisive hit — a two
run single — last night as the
Phillies beat the Kansas City
Royals 4-1 and won the World
Series four-games-to-two,
"I can't muster up the right
words to say how I feel," said
Schmidt.
He looked at the mob of media
people who had him surrounded
in the bedlam of the Phillies'
dressing room. While cham
pagne corks popped all over the
room, Schmidt maintained the
cool that has characterized his

career. He talked like a lawyer
addressing a jury in a
courtroom.
"Here we are. World Cham
pions. When we won the division
and the National League pen
nant. I had champagne dripping
all over me. Here, I've barely
had two sips.
"I feel so good that there will
be no game tomorrow (Wednes
day.)
"Us smug, overpaid Phillies
are champions," said Schmidt.
Schmidt, who had eight hits in
21 at-bats for a .381 average,
drove home seven runs and
scored six in the six games,
said, "I hope we get the credit
we deserve around the country.
I know a lot of you people would

like to see a New York-Los An
geles World Series ... but you
couldn't see a better Series than
this one. You saw everything."
Commenting on his selection
as MVP, Schmidt declared:
"Sure, it's a great feeling but it
had to be a tough decision. I
don't know who voted but there
were at least six guys on this
club who could have won. I prob
ably eked through because I
knocked in the winning runs."
The most excited and verbal
player in the room was short
stop Larry Bowa, who set a
World Series record by starting
seven double plays in the six
games.
"There are no more guys to
beat," screamed Bowa above
the din. "We are the best
baseball team in the USA."
Then Bowa told it like the
Phillies players apparently saw
themselves pictured.
"We're smug. We're over
paid. We don't want to win. We
proved it all wrong. Gentlemen.
I told you so," explained Bowa.
Bowa said he thought the
Phillies' entire season turned
when the Phillies swept a late
season, five-game series from
the New York Mets. They had
just lost four straight to Pit
tsburgh.
"We could have rolled over
and died," said Bowa. "We
were six games down in the loss
column. But we came back."
After all of this, Bowa

shouted: "I really can't express
my feelings. It's unbelievable.
All the hard work paid off."
Pitcher Dick Ruthven. who
would have pitched the seventh
game, if it had been necessary,
was the happiest pitcher in the
room because he didn't have to
work a final game.
"Lefty (Steve Carlton) was
awesome," said Ruthven. "Tug
(McGraw) pitched good but too
exciting."
Pete Rose, who played in his
fifth World Series, also drew
one of the big crowds in the
lockerroom.
"Mv first one in Cincinnati
was a big one. But the way these
people supported this ball club,
this is just as big," said Rose.
