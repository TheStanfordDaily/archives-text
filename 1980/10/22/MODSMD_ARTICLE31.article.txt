# From club sport to varsity status
## Card wrestlers rise from mat of obscurity 
### Nick Gault 
At long last, Stanford wrestl
ing has been revived. Demoted
to club status in 1977, the sport
had suffered from a lack of fund
ing and privilege since then. But
this year Stanford wrestling will
once again be a varsity sport,
thanks to a new and wealthy
Athletic Department account
called "The Friends of Stanford
Wrestling."
The sport enters a 4-year trial
program after which, if suc
cessful, the Athletic Depart
ment will take over all funding.
And coach Chris Horpel sees no
reason for the program not to be
successful.
"Our new income will enable
us to recruit as never before,"
Horpel said, "and I think that at
Stanford we have a big advan
tage — there's no other school in
the country with our academic

attractions whose wrestling is
as well funded as ours now is."
The NCAA allows 11 scholar
ships to be issued over a 4-year
period and Horpel can now hap
pily meet this maximum.
Prior to his appointment as
coach of the first varsity wrestl
ing team fielded at Stanford in
four years, Horpel served as as
sistant coach at Stanford
(1975-76) and UCLA (1978-79),
and coached Stanford's club
team last year. An ac
complished wrestler, Horpel
was a 1973 All-America and Pa
cific-8 Conference champion
while an undergraduate at Stan
ford, and an alternate on the
1976 Olympic team.
Horpel will be joined by assis
tant coach Lester Yqshida, an
outstanding wrestler here from
1974 to 1978, and graduate assis
tant Mike Padden, named Most
Valuable Wrestler and team

captain while at Notre Dame.
A great stroke of luck befell
the team when Yefim Rivkin, a
former Soviet national cham
pion, volunteered to be an assis
tant coach. Rivkin is a 40-year
old computer programmer liv
ing in the area who was per
mitted to leave the USSR only a
year ago. Coach Horpel is, of
course, delighted to have Riv
kin's expert knowledge as a re
source.
Although wrestling now en
joys varsity status, the team's
performance will not reflect the
benefits of recruiting until the
year of 1981-82. This year, the
team will consist of walk-ons
and members, of last year's
squad. Horpel is, nevertheless,
highly optimistic with his
1980-81 outlook.
"I look for a new attitude to
follow the sport's new status,"
Horpel said. "For many of our

potentially good people wrestl
ing was just an on-again, off
again thing last year simply be
cause they looked at it as a club
rather than a varsity sport."
There are several standout
Cardinal grapplers for whom
Horpel has high expectations.
Among them is 177-pound junior
Doug Perkins, who as last
year's captain and MVP is ex
pected to lead the team again
this year. Perkins just missed
national competition last season
with a fourth place finish at the
Pac-10 meet, and should make it
this time around.
Derrick Strahorn, a 134-pound
sophomore, was undefeated in
an abbreviated season last year.
He is said by Horpel to possess
tremendous all-around talent.
Strahorn was a finalist in the
highly competitive Ohio State
championships.
Mark Martel. a 158-pound sen

lor, is known-as perhaps the
most devoted wrestler on the
team. Horpel says he "could re
ally be a surprise this year if he
continues his steady improve
ment."
Martel finished strongly last
year, defeating the No 2 seed at
the Pac-10 tournament.
Other promising Cardinal
grapplers are 134-pound Craig
Thrower, a New Mexico state
champion, 167-pound Thomas
Mullen, a Hawaii state cham
pion, and 126-pound Tim
Daniels, a runner-up in the Ne
braska state championships.
All these wrestlers are being
counted on to spearhead a re
juvenated Stanford wrestling
team With the support of the
full-fledged recruiting that goes
with varsity status, Stanford
could evolve into a respectable
power within the next three or
four vears.

cessful, the Athletic Depart
ment will take over all funding.
And coach Chris Horpel sees no
reason for the program not to be
successful.
"Our new income will enable
us to recruit as never before,"
Horpel said, "and I think that at
Stanford we have a big advan
tage — there's no other school in
the country with our academic

attractions whose wrestling is
as well funded as ours now is."
The NCAA allows 11 scholar
ships to be issued over a 4-year
period and Horpel can now hap
pily meet this maximum.
Prior to his appointment as
coach of the first varsity wrestl
ing team fielded at Stanford in
four years, Horpel served as as
sistant coach at Stanford
(1975-76) and UCLA (1978-79),
and coached Stanford's club
team last year. An ac
complished wrestler, Horpel
was a 1973 All-America and Pa
cific-8 Conference champion
while an undergraduate at Stan
ford, and an alternate on the
1976 Olympic team.
Horpel will be joined by assis
tant coach Lester Yqshida, an
outstanding wrestler here from
1974 to 1978, and graduate assis
tant Mike Padden, named Most
Valuable Wrestler and team

captain while at Notre Dame.
A great stroke of luck befell
the team when Yefim Rivkin, a
former Soviet national cham
pion, volunteered to be an assis
tant coach. Rivkin is a 40-year
old computer programmer liv
ing in the area who was per
mitted to leave the USSR only a
year ago. Coach Horpel is, of
course, delighted to have Riv
kin's expert knowledge as a re
source.
Although wrestling now en
joys varsity status, the team's
performance will not reflect the
benefits of recruiting until the
year of 1981-82. This year, the
team will consist of walk-ons
and members, of last year's
squad. Horpel is, nevertheless,
highly optimistic with his
1980-81 outlook.
"I look for a new attitude to
follow the sport's new status,"
Horpel said. "For many of our

potentially good people wrestl
ing was just an on-again, off
again thing last year simply be
cause they looked at it as a club
rather than a varsity sport."
There are several standout
Cardinal grapplers for whom
Horpel has high expectations.
Among them is 177-pound junior
Doug Perkins, who as last
year's captain and MVP is ex
pected to lead the team again
this year. Perkins just missed
national competition last season
with a fourth place finish at the
Pac-10 meet, and should make it
this time around.
Derrick Strahorn, a 134-pound
sophomore, was undefeated in
an abbreviated season last year.
He is said by Horpel to possess
tremendous all-around talent.
Strahorn was a finalist in the
highly competitive Ohio State
championships.
Mark Martel. a 158-pound sen

lor, is known-as perhaps the
most devoted wrestler on the
team. Horpel says he "could re
ally be a surprise this year if he
continues his steady improve
ment."
Martel finished strongly last
year, defeating the No 2 seed at
the Pac-10 tournament.
Other promising Cardinal
grapplers are 134-pound Craig
Thrower, a New Mexico state
champion, 167-pound Thomas
Mullen, a Hawaii state cham
pion, and 126-pound Tim
Daniels, a runner-up in the Ne
braska state championships.
All these wrestlers are being
counted on to spearhead a re
juvenated Stanford wrestling
team With the support of the
full-fledged recruiting that goes
with varsity status, Stanford
could evolve into a respectable
power within the next three or
four vears.

At long last, Stanford wrestl
ing has been revived. Demoted
to club status in 1977, the sport
had suffered from a lack of fund
ing and privilege since then. But
this year Stanford wrestling will
once again be a varsity sport,
thanks to a new and wealthy
Athletic Department account
called "The Friends of Stanford
Wrestling."
The sport enters a 4-year trial
program after which, if suc
cessful, the Athletic Depart
ment will take over all funding.
