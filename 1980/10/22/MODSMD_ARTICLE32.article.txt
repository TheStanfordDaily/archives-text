# Eagles' stay in Top 20 may be a short one
## 
### Associated Press 
Coach Bobby Collins of the un
defeated Southern Mississippi
football team says it's almost
too much to believe.
Making The Associated Press
college football poll for the first
time ever. Being 6-0. And
playing the No. 1 team in the
country.

"It's quite a challenge. It's
something you dream about. It
could only happen in America,"
Collins said Monday.
Texas moved into second
place behind Alabama in the
poll Monday while Southern
Mississippi, Alabama's next op
ponent, made the rankings for
the first time.
"We are certanly pleased that
we cracked the Top Twenty and
I feel our team is very deserv
ing," Collins said. "We have ac
complished another of our goals

and 1 hope our play this week
justifies this recognition."
Collins said he felt neither
Southern Mississippi's schedule
nor the fact that his team was an
independent had hindered it in
the Eagles' quest for big time
status.
"I think we've played the type
schedule (in recent years) that
would be in favor of our receiv
ing national recognition, includ
ing the Southeasten Conference
schools, Florida State and
Tulane," he said. "And the ma
jor independents do get recog
nition. Just look at Notre Dame
and Florida State."
Southern Mississippi, which
has two victories and a tie in 19
games with Alabama, will not
be traveling to Tuscaloosa sim
ply to look good against the
Crimson Tide, Collins said.
"That's just not the way we
play. We're not going to play
just to look respectable. We're
preparing the best we can to
win." he said.

Alabama, seeking an un
precedented third consecutive
national championship, claimed
the No. 1 position for the sixth
week in a row after defeating
Tennessee 27-0.

IM awards
The annual intramural
awards were presented a little
differently this fall. In past
years the point-total champions
of the All-Women and All-Uni
versity divisions received their
trophies at halftime of the first
home football game. As a result,
the representatives of the win
ning teams accepted their

awards without much ceremony
while assuming a secondary
position to the more popular
sporting event.
This year, however, the reci
pients of the Cathy Templeton
All-Women and Elwin Bugge
All-University trophies were
treated to an informal luncheon
banquet last Monday at the Fac
ulty Club. The banquet was brief
but, as IM director Howie
Dallmar noted, was "much
more appropriate and mean
ingful for the winners than a
rushed presentation at a foot
ball game."
The Sigma Chi fraternity re
ceived the 1979-80 Elwin Bugge
award with a total of 592 points.
The Cathy Templeton award
was given to Serra, a graduate
school women's group, which
compiled 283 points.
Mike Fisher presented the
awards to the representatives of
the winning groups â€” Bill Ellis
and Dana Bjornson of the Sigma
Chis, and Pam Mayerfeld and
Cathv Burdon of Serra
