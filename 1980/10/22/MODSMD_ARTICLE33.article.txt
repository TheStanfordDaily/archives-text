increasing We still encounter difficulties in supplying
the cities and industrial centers with such foodstuffs as
milk and meat

the Soviet economy. Brezhnev was vague about 'he results
ot the 1980 Soviet grain harvest, saying only the average
annual yield was more than 2(H) million metric tons during
the five-year plan that ended Dec 31
Obervers regarded his cautious statement as a clear
sign the harvest fell well below this year's goal of 235 mil
lion tons.

million ton range, forcing the Soviets to import more grain
to make up a shortage That shortage has been aggravated

sales to the Soviets because of their military intervention
in Afghanistan

increasing We still encounter difficulties in supplying
the cities and industrial centers with such foodstuffs as
milk and meat

the Soviet economy. Brezhnev was vague about 'he results
ot the 1980 Soviet grain harvest, saying only the average
annual yield was more than 2(H) million metric tons during
the five-year plan that ended Dec 31
Obervers regarded his cautious statement as a clear
sign the harvest fell well below this year's goal of 235 mil
lion tons.

million ton range, forcing the Soviets to import more grain
to make up a shortage That shortage has been aggravated
bv President Jimmy Carter's partial embargo on grain
sales to the Soviets because of their military intervention
