# Engineering prof analyzes health care practices
## Controversial research results in changed standards 
### Jeff Sims 
A new program being developed at Stanford may
have far-reaching effects on the medical field by
making health care practices more efficient and
thereby saving millions of dollars, according to the
originators of the program.
Called the Analysis of Clinical Policies, the pro
gram's main purpose is to apply engineering knowl
edge to the medical field, said David Eddy, as
sociate professor of Engineering-Economic Sys
tems. Stanford is one of the few places in the country
where this type of work is being accomplished, said
Eddy.
By applying the techniques of decision analysis to
the medical field, proponents of clinical policy
analysis hope to make improvements in many areas
of medical practice. Large, complex problems
which can be solved quantitatively are the main
focus of the undertakings bv Eddy and others who
have developed similar programs.
The work of Eddy, and his staff of medical ?nd en
gineering students, has prompted several changes in

the past few years. For example, major alterations
in the proposals of the American Cancer Society for
cancer screening practices were made due to this
research, according to Eddy.
As a result of the work at Stanford, he said, the
recommended frequencies for Pap smear tests and
for screenings of the large intestine for cancer were
changed. Also, the recommendation that smokers
have X-rays every year as part of a routine examina
tion was dropped. Eddy said.
The analysis and solving of problems by Eddy and
his staff usually begins with the gathering of all pos
sible information on a specific topic. Next, the prob
lem is defined in quantitative terms and then
analyzed.
"The program tries not to give a best' solution,
but to present different options and estimate the ef
fects if each were enacted," said Eddy.
By increasing the efficiency of clinical practices,
the new program may save millions of dollars for
both patients and insurance companies. The money
saved is often hundreds of times less than the cost of
the research.

Eddy's background, with degrees in both medi
cine and engineering, enabled him to pilot the new
program
Core financial support the program comes from
the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, while addi
tional support for specific programs is often granted
by insurance carriers, Eddy said.
Some controversy developed over the new
guidelines adopted by the American Cancer Society
when the conclusions of Eddy's work were called
premature.
"A doctor faces problems in transferring
statistical information into clinical procedures,"
said Assoc. Prof, of Clinical Psychology Bill Weber.
He said recommendations to check for cancer less
often may cause cancer to go undetected, in some
cases, despite statistical odds that an extra screen
ing would be unnecessary.
Eddy, however, maintained that, with the
evidence behind a decision being published along
with the results, doctors and patients will have an
opportunity to evaluate decisions more easily and
with better reasons.
