# Cowell nurses may vote on strike ; federal mediators may aid in talks
## 
### David Frank 
Nurses at Palo Alto Medical Clinic
(PAMC) and Stanford's Cowell Stu
dent Health Center approved a resolu
tion Monday to conduct a strike vote,
according to Kathv North, spokes
person for the nurses.
North said the resolution vote in
dicated that "a majority of the nurses
support the idea of a strike vote."
But the date and occurrence of a for
mal strike vote, she added, will de
pend on the outcome of negotiations
between the management, nurses and
federal mediators.
A report in yesterday's Daily er
roneously indicated that nurses would
vote this Friday on whether to walk off
their jobs next Monday.
Cowell is operated by the PAMC un
der a contract with the University.
Farlier this year, nurses at PAMC
and at Cowell, voted to affiliate with
the Federation of Nurses and Health
Professionals of the American Feder
ation of Teachers AFL-CIO. and to or
ganize into the Registered Nurses
Council (RNC).
PAMC management refused to ne
gotiate with the nurses under their
new affiliation. However, a National
Labor Relations Board adminis
trative .judge last month ordered man
agement to recognize the council and
its affiliation with the AFL-CIO.
Clinic management is appealing
that decision with another NLRB
court in Washington. D C.
In addition, the NLRB will hold a

hearing in March 1981 concerning an
unfair labor practice charge filed bv
the RNC
In the charge, the RNC contended
that PAMC management was at
tempting to discourage union mem
bership by withholding cost-of-living
pay increases from union members
while granting increases to non-union
personnel Non-union members re
ceived an 8.5 percent cost-of-living in
crease in July
North said the RNC contacted the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service last week, and the service's

San Francisco representative said at
tempts would bo made to schedule ne
gotiations between the nurses and the
clinic management
She also said RN(' representatives
are scheduled to meet with the ex
ecutive board of the PANIC tomorrow
morning The purpose of the meeting
will be strictly information to let
the board know the nature of the union
affiliation
"There will not be any negotiations
tomorrow." said North
Officials at the PAMC were un
available for comment on the dispute
