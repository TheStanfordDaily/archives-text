## 
### Cameron Smith 
The daughter of one of the U.S.
hostages in Iran has called for a con
gressional investigation into the past
U.S. role in Iran
it would be useful in getting out the
facts for the American people to see if
there is a need for an apology,'' said
Lvsette Graves yesterday at Bechtel
International Center to an audience of
80. "And I think an apology would re
sult." she added.
Her father. .John Graves, a public
affairs officer with the U.S. Interna
tional Communication Agency, was
assigned to Tehran in Aug. 1979 and is
one of the 52 hostages still being held
by the Moslem students who seized the
U.S. embassy there last November.
Graves appeared with Kathleen
Connolly, one of 50 Americans who vis
ited Iran in February as the guests of
the students holding the embassy.
"Our role in Iran has been pretty
ugly from a moral point of view, but it
has also been contrary to our own in
terests." Graves said
U.S. foreign policy towards Iran has
proved "catastrophic" to the Ameri
can people, she said, but even worse
for foreign service officers.
"I know at least 50 foreign service
officers who are scared stiff to go ov
erseas because our policy is so
backward that their lives are on the
line all the time." she said
Americans have to realize that peo
ple in the Third World are "not going
to stand for military dictatorships like
that of the shah anymore." she said.
Graves criticized the Carter admin
istration for its "vacillating" policy
toward Iran. She said her father and
other diplomats were sent in to nor
malize relations with the new Islamic
government, but at the same time,
military personnel were sent in to try
to engineer a coup
According to Graves, embassy
cables show that the U.S. charge
d'affairs and other diplomats did
"everything in their power" to con
vince Carter not to let the late ex-Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi into the
United States, the move which trig
gered the embassv takeover.

Hut she said Carter gave in to pres
sure from National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski. banker David
Rockefeller and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger to admit the
shah
There have been "tlashes" of im
provement in foreign policy under
Carter, she said, but "we've been
playing on both sides all along, no
wonder the Iranian people don't trust
us."
Graves said Iranians just want a
guarantee that "it won't happen
again, referring to the CIA-backed
coup which re-seated the shah into
power in the early '50s.
She also said the economic sanc
tions against Iran are "uncalled for."
and the ban on travel to Iran by Ameri
cans is unconstitutional.
Graves, who grew up in Africa and
now lives in Washington D C . said she
and other tamilv members have had
difficulty with the media. "They
always edit our statements to make us
sound so radical." she said
Hut she said both she and her father
are optimistic about the chances for
the release of the hostages His last
letter, she said, asked her family to
make reservations for a vacation in
Guadalupe at the end of October, and
to get him a new tennis racket.
Connolly, associate director of
Catholic Charities in San Francisco,
said she found Iranians to be "ex
tremelv sophisticated; they knew
what they were talking about." during
her stay in Iran
She said the trip was arranged by
the Iranian students' adviser at the
University of Kansas and the delega
tion included many women, clergy and
minorities.
A former government official told
the delegation that prominent Ameri
can journalists were given expensive
gifts in an effort to ensure uncritical
coverage of the ex-shah's regime, she
said. Hut documents which prove this
have not been released in order to
"keep the American media from be
coming more anti-Iran." she said.

coming more anti-Iran." she said.
The daughter of one of the U.S.
hostages in Iran has called for a con
gressional investigation into the past
U.S. role in Iran
it would be useful in getting out the
facts for the American people to see if
there is a need for an apology,'' said
Lvsette Graves yesterday at Bechtel
International Center to an audience of
80. "And I think an apology would re
sult." she added.
Her father. .John Graves, a public
affairs officer with the U.S. Interna
tional Communication Agency, was
assigned to Tehran in Aug. 1979 and is
one of the 52 hostages still being held
by the Moslem students who seized the
U.S. embassy there last November.
Graves appeared with Kathleen
Connolly, one of 50 Americans who vis
ited Iran in February as the guests of
the students holding the embassy.
"Our role in Iran has been pretty
ugly from a moral point of view, but it
has also been contrary to our own in
terests." Graves said
U.S. foreign policy towards Iran has
proved "catastrophic" to the Ameri
can people, she said, but even worse
for foreign service officers.
"I know at least 50 foreign service
officers who are scared stiff to go ov
erseas because our policy is so
backward that their lives are on the
line all the time." she said
Americans have to realize that peo
ple in the Third World are "not going
to stand for military dictatorships like
that of the shah anymore." she said.
Graves criticized the Carter admin
istration for its "vacillating" policy
toward Iran. She said her father and
other diplomats were sent in to nor
malize relations with the new Islamic
government, but at the same time,
military personnel were sent in to try
to engineer a coup
According to Graves, embassy
cables show that the U.S. charge
d'affairs and other diplomats did
"everything in their power" to con
vince Carter not to let the late ex-Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi into the
United States, the move which trig
gered the embassv takeover.

Hut she said Carter gave in to pres
sure from National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski. banker David
Rockefeller and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger to admit the
shah
There have been "tlashes" of im
provement in foreign policy under
Carter, she said, but "we've been
playing on both sides all along, no
wonder the Iranian people don't trust
us."
Graves said Iranians just want a
guarantee that "it won't happen
again, referring to the CIA-backed
coup which re-seated the shah into
power in the early '50s.
She also said the economic sanc
tions against Iran are "uncalled for."
and the ban on travel to Iran by Ameri
cans is unconstitutional.
Graves, who grew up in Africa and
now lives in Washington D C . said she
and other tamilv members have had
difficulty with the media. "They
always edit our statements to make us
sound so radical." she said
Hut she said both she and her father
are optimistic about the chances for
the release of the hostages His last
letter, she said, asked her family to
make reservations for a vacation in
Guadalupe at the end of October, and
to get him a new tennis racket.
Connolly, associate director of
Catholic Charities in San Francisco,
said she found Iranians to be "ex
tremelv sophisticated; they knew
what they were talking about." during
her stay in Iran
She said the trip was arranged by
the Iranian students' adviser at the
University of Kansas and the delega
tion included many women, clergy and
minorities.
A former government official told
the delegation that prominent Ameri
can journalists were given expensive
gifts in an effort to ensure uncritical
coverage of the ex-shah's regime, she
said. Hut documents which prove this
have not been released in order to
"keep the American media from be
coming more anti-Iran." she said.
