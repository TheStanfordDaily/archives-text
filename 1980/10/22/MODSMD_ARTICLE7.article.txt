# SLAC research progresses as new construction begins

Continuing work on existing
projects and beginning construction
on a new multi-million dollar addition
are all a part of the present work being
done at Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC).
SLAC is a center for research into
high-energy physics, which explores
the basic building blocks of matter.

once thought to be only electrons, pro
tons and neutrons.
A vast array of smaller, sub-atomic
particles have been discovered at
SLAC and at other scientific labora
tories around the world. At SLAC. the
research is conducted by creating
high-speed collisions among particles
in an effort to break them into smaller
elements.
"Research in elementary particle
physics is showing that vast riches of
knowledge and understanding about
the basic nature of our world could lie
ahead." said Douglas Dupen. director
of personnel and laboratory relations
at SLAC.
The new addition, known as the Sin
gle-Pass Collider, will cost $60 million
plus or minus 25 percent. It is basical
ly an underground ring, similar to the
recently-completed Positron-Elec
tron Project (PEP), in which two
powerful beams will be collided to
create a force of 100 billion electron
volts.
This level of energy is about three
times higher than any other force
being created currently anywhere in
the world.
The final design for this project has
not yet been completed. Recently, a
request for an environmental impact
report was filed, and the report is still
pending.
The Single-Pass Collider project is
not expected to be completed before
1983, according to Dupen.
Cycles of development
"There has been a cycle of ideal
ization and construction of projects
constantly since the first accelerator

was built in 1947," said Dupen
"Whether a project is large or small,
each cycle lasts about five years.
Right now. we are involved in the ide
alization part of the cycle with regard
to this new project "
The projects currently being com
pleted at SLAC are all reiated to PEP
Though the ring itself is operational,
the hexagon-shaped structure has sev
eral above-ground experimental halls
attached to it
These contain the equipment neces
sary to monitor the results of the beam
collisions inside the ring
Detecting new photons
One of these instruments, the Two-
Photon Detector, will determine if
new photons are created as a result of
the high-speed collisions between
electrons and positrons in the ac
celerator
If new photons are created, the ma
chine will also show if there have been
any collisions among the new parti
cles.
The High Resolution Spectrometer
utilizes the 107-ton magnet trans
ferred to Stanford from Argonne Lab
oratories near Chicago last October-
After being completely fitted, the
magnet will become an extremely
sensitive device used to show the pres
ence of new mass states.
It will be far superior to any detec
tors presently in use at PEP
A third project, the Time Projection
Chamber, is the most ambitious
project at PEP, according to Dupen
It not only will be able to detect sub
atomic particles, but will also identify
each one of them
