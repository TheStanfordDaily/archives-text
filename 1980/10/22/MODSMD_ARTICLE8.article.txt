## Prof. George predicts impact of election Candidates differ on foreign policy 
### Cary Rosenzweig 
San Francisco — "There are important
differences between (President Jimmy)
Carter and (Ronald) Reagan, even if the
campaign doesn't show it." said Political
Science Prof. Alexander George last Thurs
day in a speech entitled "Political issues
surrounding the election."
"Especially in foreign policy, the can
didates differ in their political-ideological
philosophies," he said, addressing the Stan
ford-San Francisco Lutheran Club.
George is a former member of the social
science department at the Rand Corpo
ration and the author of Presidential De
cision-Making in Foreign Policy, and De
terrence in American Foreign Policy: Theo
ry and Practice.
He said the mood of the country has
switched since the 1976 presidential cam
paign. Following the trauma of the Water
gate affair, the Americans wanted an "ac
countable" president, he said. The populace
now, however, feels that "we need a strong
president rather than one who is merely ac
countable," he said, quoting a 1979 Gallup
poll.
Calling Carter's performance on foreign
policy "appalling and amateurish," George
asserted that the "man on the street gener
ally thinks that Carter is well-meaning but

incompetent. Yet, there has been a slow, un
even learning experience on Carter's part,"
he said.
"Carter has developed such a bad reputa
tion. a negative halo effect, that even if he
does well, he doesn't get the credit," he
said.
Asserting that Carter's foreign policy vis
a-vis the Soviet Union is "in shambles,"
George said, "We must develop a coherent,
consistent, long range foreign policy with
respect to the Soviet Union."
Republican candidate Reagan is much
more anti-Soviet than Carter, according to
George.
Emphasizing the need and importance of
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT i 11, he said Carter wants to resurrect
the treaty, which Reagan opposes.
"Reagan wants to start from scratch on
the arms negotiations after we build up our
defense capabilities." said George.
"SALT II is a very complex document. It
is important to remember that the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee took a very
critical look at it.and it survived. With a
few provisos, the committee sent it on to the
Senate with favorable comments," he ex
plained.
"Without SALT 11. we are in danger of an
arms race," he said.

George, who has taught at Stanford for 12
years, said he is more "worried about Re
agan in foreign affairs than domestic," be
cause of what he called Reagan's "over
simplified view of the world setting.'
Because Reagan has "no experience in
foreign affairs," the positions of secretary
of state, secretary of defense, and assistant
secretary of national security will be of "ut
most importance if Reagan is elected,"
George said.
"Reagan relies a great deal on his top for
eign policy advisors. He wants one domi
nant, knowledgeable, and prestigious per
son to guide foreign policy," said George.
He said all of Reagan's foreign policy spe
cialists and national security experts favor
a significant build-up of defense
capabilities, but otherwise have major dif
ferences.
"Reagan has carefully withheld position
papers on foreign policy in order not to bring
out the latent disagreements among his for
eign affairs experts." he said.
The chances of former Secretary of State
Henrv Kissinger becoming Reagan's top
foreign affairs expert are nonexistent "un
less Reagan double-crosses his most con
servative backers and advisers," George
said.

Foreign Relations Committee took a very
critical look at it.and it survived. With a
few provisos, the committee sent it on to the
Senate with favorable comments," he ex
plained.
"Without SALT 11. we are in danger of an
arms race," he said.

George, who has taught at Stanford for 12
years, said he is more "worried about Re
agan in foreign affairs than domestic," be
cause of what he called Reagan's "over
simplified view of the world setting.'
Because Reagan has "no experience in
foreign affairs," the positions of secretary
of state, secretary of defense, and assistant
secretary of national security will be of "ut
most importance if Reagan is elected,"
George said.
"Reagan relies a great deal on his top for
eign policy advisors. He wants one domi
nant, knowledgeable, and prestigious per
son to guide foreign policy," said George.
He said all of Reagan's foreign policy spe
cialists and national security experts favor
a significant build-up of defense
capabilities, but otherwise have major dif
ferences.
"Reagan has carefully withheld position
papers on foreign policy in order not to bring
out the latent disagreements among his for
eign affairs experts." he said.
The chances of former Secretary of State
Henrv Kissinger becoming Reagan's top
foreign affairs expert are nonexistent "un
less Reagan double-crosses his most con
servative backers and advisers," George
said.

co Luncheon Club last Thursday.
San Francisco — "There are important
differences between (President Jimmy)
Carter and (Ronald) Reagan, even if the
campaign doesn't show it." said Political
Science Prof. Alexander George last Thurs
day in a speech entitled "Political issues
surrounding the election."
"Especially in foreign policy, the can
didates differ in their political-ideological
philosophies," he said, addressing the Stan
ford-San Francisco Lutheran Club.
George is a former member of the social
science department at the Rand Corpo
ration and the author of Presidential De
cision-Making in Foreign Policy, and De
terrence in American Foreign Policy: Theo
ry and Practice.
He said the mood of the country has
switched since the 1976 presidential cam
paign. Following the trauma of the Water
gate affair, the Americans wanted an "ac
countable" president, he said. The populace
now, however, feels that "we need a strong
president rather than one who is merely ac
countable," he said, quoting a 1979 Gallup
poll.
Calling Carter's performance on foreign
policy "appalling and amateurish," George
asserted that the "man on the street gener
ally thinks that Carter is well-meaning but

incompetent. Yet, there has been a slow, un
even learning experience on Carter's part,"
he said.
"Carter has developed such a bad reputa
tion. a negative halo effect, that even if he
does well, he doesn't get the credit," he
said.
Asserting that Carter's foreign policy vis
a-vis the Soviet Union is "in shambles,"
George said, "We must develop a coherent,
consistent, long range foreign policy with
respect to the Soviet Union."
Republican candidate Reagan is much
more anti-Soviet than Carter, according to
George.
Emphasizing the need and importance of
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT i 11, he said Carter wants to resurrect
the treaty, which Reagan opposes.
"Reagan wants to start from scratch on
the arms negotiations after we build up our
defense capabilities." said George.
"SALT II is a very complex document. It
is important to remember that the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee took a very
critical look at it.and it survived. With a
few provisos, the committee sent it on to the
Senate with favorable comments," he ex
plained.
"Without SALT 11. we are in danger of an
arms race," he said.

agan in foreign affairs than domestic," be
