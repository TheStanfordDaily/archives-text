# Arms sales to Africa may spur war
## 
### Washington Post 
Nairobi, Kenya â€” An agree
ment for the United States to
arm Somalia in return for use of
military and port facilities by
American forces has come un
der sharp criticism in Kenya,
one of Washington's staunchest
allies in black Africa.
This is despite Kenyan sup
port for the global purpose of the
U.S. policy to provide for rapid
military deployment in the Indi
an Ocean region in the event of
crises such as the Iranian-Iraqi
war.
Like Somalia, Kenya has
signed an agreement allowing
U.S. forces to use Kenyan air
bases and seaports. In return,
Kenya is to receive doubled
American economic and food
aid amounting to about $50 mil
lion.
The problem for President
Daniel Arap Moi is that applica
tion of the U.S. policy in East
Africa will result in $40 million
worth of American arms during
the next two years going to
Somalia, which lays claim to
Kenya's vast northern frontier
district. Kenyan officials fear
this could lead to a resumption
of warfare in the area, which
comprises about a third of the
Texas-sized country.
From the U.S. point of view,
the overall strategy of contain
ing possible Soviet encroach
ment in the region outweighs
the contentious local issue in the
Horn of Africa.
Built-in safeguards
Washington has sought to
build safeguards into the agree
ment with Somalia by prohibit
ing use of the weapons in neigh
boring countries, but that gives
scant reassurance to Kenya.

Ethiopia, supported by about
13.000 Cuban soldiers, drove the
Somalis out of the Ogaden in
1978. but the conflict in the bar
ren desert resumed again this
year. Somalia and Kenya also
engaged in a sporadic four-year
war in the mid-1960s and there
have been continued outbursts
despite a 1967 peace accord.
Kenya fears that Somali mili
tary failures against the Ethio
pians, who have received be
tween $1 billion and $2 billion in
Soviet arms during the last
three years, will cause the
Somalis to turn their attention
westward to Kenya.
Expanding military
Kenya, a bastion of capital
ism in a continent leaning
toward socialism, has concen
trated on development and done
little until recent years to ex
pand its military forces since
gaining independence from
Britain 17 years ago.
Three years ago. at the peak
of the Ogaden war, Kenya
turned to the United States to
buy 12 F-5 fighter-bombers. It is
also buying 32 attack heli
copters.
Informed that the U.S. deal
with Somalia includes anti
aircraft missiles, a Kenyan -
source said sardonically:
"That makes it very interest
ing. You supply us with the
planes and the Somalis with
equipment to shoot them
down,"
Arms sales 'alarming'
Kasanga Mulwa, Kenyan
chairman of the parliament's
defense and foreign relations
committee, said last month that
he was "alarmed by the con
tinued sale of arms to Somalia.
We do not think it is really prac

tical that such a country, which
on many occasions has claimed
part of our land, can abstain
from using these arms for ag
gression."
The American military aid to
Somalia could alienate much of
Africa, which generally has
agreed that the nations of the
continent must accept the old,
admittedly imperfect, colonial
boundaries to avoid widespread
border wars.
The agreement could also
pose a more serious dilemma
for the United States since
American personnel to be sta
tioned at the Soviet-built Somali
port of Berbera on the Gulf of
Aden could become embroiled if
Ethiopia invaded Somalia.
No U.S. bases
The U.S. Embassy here em
phasizes that the agreements do
not provide for the estab
lishment of U.S. bases, such as
in Europe, but simply for use of
air and port facilities.
In Kenya this means use of
Mombasa, 2700 miles from the
Persian Gulf, by the expanded
U.S. fleet in the Indian Ocean
for resupply and as a liberty
port for sailors. In addition,
U.S. cargo and troop-carrying
planes will be allowed to land at
Kenyan air bases.
The United States has gained
similar rights at Mogadishu and
Berbera, 300 miles west of the
gulf, where the Soviets estab
lished an air and port facility
before they abandoned Somalia
for Ethiopia in 1977. Berbera is
117 miles from the Ethiopian
border. The United States re
portedly plans to improve the
facilities in this country and
Somalia.
It is likely that the United

States eventually will seek to
station mobile forces in the
area.
"What else can a rapid
deployment force mean?" a
prominent Kenyan journalist
asked. "You need to have some
presence to make it credible."
A House of Representatives
subcommittee, approving the
first $20 million in arms sales to
Somalia, laid down the condi
tion that no equipment would be
delivered before "verified as
surance" was given that no
Somali regular forces remained
in the Ogaden.
