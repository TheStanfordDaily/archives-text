YOU CAN HAVE A BAD HORSE.
BUT YOU'VE GOTTA HAVE
ACiOOD PAIR OF BOOTS.
Since the days of ihe wild west,
people have relied on Frye hoots
as old friends. That's because
all Frye boots arc carcfully bench
crafted of the finest leathers.
We've been making them that way
for more than 100 years now. Our
styles may change, but our quality
and craftsmanship remain
the same.
The best.
