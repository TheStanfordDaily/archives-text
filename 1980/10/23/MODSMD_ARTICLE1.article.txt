# Worker morale drops as anti-rape escort service awaits student calls
## 
### Kate Lear 
Escort Service, a program designed to help students get
from here to there safely, begins its second quarter of op
eration this fall.
Founded by Students United for Rape Elimination
(SURE). the program's goal is to eliminate rape and the
fear of rape from Stanford's campus, according to Vic
Menon. Menon co-founded Escort Service and is its curent
director
Proponents of Escort Service see it as a necessary reac
tion to campus crime rates. In the past nine months at
least 23 different sex crimes were reported, including one
attempted rape.
Incomplete safety
"The campus is a relatively safe one if you compare it to
other urban campuses," Menon said. "But it belies the
fact that it is not completely safe â€” there is potential for
attack." he added.
"If a woman chooses not to, she should not be forced to
walk alone at night," said Menon. He cites police depart
ment statistics that rape is approximately 99 percent less
likely to occur if a woman is accompanied by another per
son.
Sure was founded by Menon and Ron Lepow in March
1979 in response to a Daily column written by a rape vic
tim.
Escort Service is now composed of 25 to 30 male and
female student escorts and two dispatchers. Escorts ac
company a student between any two points on campus. Es
corts are also available for walks within one mile of the
campus.
The service operates Sunday through Thursday nights
between 8:30 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. Students, whether on
bike or on foot, can call for an escort by dialing 497-3217.
Escorts generally arrive within seven minutes of a call.

If students wish to eliminate the waiting time, they may
leave a message during the day at the SURE number for an
escort that night or any future night.
Student hesitancy
Student hesitancy to use Escort Service has been the
basic problem for its operators. Menon said that the es
corts suffered "morale problems" because so few calls for
escorts came in.
Each escort works one two-hour shift per week when
they wait in their room for calls from the dispatcher. The
escorts are "earnestly hoping to get calls," said Menon.
"They really do want to help," he said. Menon said there
are several reasons why students hesitate to use the ser
vice.
"They feel silly that they need to be escorted," he said.
Also, they fear that they are wasting the escort's time. Be
cause students sometimes need to walk only short dis
tances at night, they feel awkward asking for an escort.
In addition, there is a certain amount of fear or shyness
among potential service users because students usually
don't know the escorts. Menon said he urges the formation
of dorm escort services to eliminate this problem of un
familiarity.
A third reason lor the scarcity of calls is the bicycle,
Menon said Students on bicycles feel they are safe fror"
attack because they are moving quickly.
Menon insisted that riders are even "more vulnerable
. . . because you're not as well-balanced." An object can
be tossed into the bicycle's spokes and, if thrown, the rider
can be injured. This leaves a person more open to attack.
Stanford police services, which sponsors SURE] with the
Office of Student Affairs, encourages use of the service.
Detective Carl Gielitz said SURE is "doing a good job
. . . I think it prevents a lot of incidents."
