# Zoecon scientists work to get the bugs out of life

Dr. John Diekman, vice president and general
manager of Zoecon Corporation, sits at a table
with a box of silkworm cocoons, neatly organized
and scientifically labeled Why does a vice presi
dent have bugs on his desk? That's his line of
work In fact, without bugs, he might be out of
work.
The box of cocoons shows how scientists are us
ing nature to their benefit at Zoecon. In this case,
they have found the growth hormone of the
silkworm and have been able to increase the
length of time it spins a cocoon, causing an in
crease in silk production of more than 10 percent.
Most of Zoecon's work, however, is in the field
of pest control. "The philosophy is to develop
chemicals selective to insects that are safe,
biodegradable, and cost effective. The product
must be competitive with standard pesticides or
else the farmer won't buy it," said Dr. Julius
Menn, director of research of Zoecon
Menn said the toughening of Federal Environ
mental Protection Agency standards has made
Zoecon's products look even more attractive to
farmers because the products are safe.
One of the greatest technological break
throughs attributed to Zoecon is the chemical
Methoprene. "Methoprene mimics the action of
the insects' juvenile hormone," according to
Menn.
He added, "This material methoprene controls
insects by keeping them from maturing â€” a type
of birth control for insects." This is not a strange
choice of words, because the company's founder,
Stanford Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi, is also
known as the "Father of the Pill."
Safest chemical made
"Methoprene is by far the safest material in the
industry," said Diekman. The scientists said the
product is not environmentally stable; in other
words, it biodegrades quickly. Methoprene is not
well suited to daytime use because sunlight
causes it to break down quickly.
It is especially useful in the control of the
Tobacco Hornworm. which attacks tobacco
plants while they are being cured. Since there is a
dark atmosphere within the plants, they are well
suited to the use of methoprene. The methoprene
biodegrades before the products reach humans,

but it is not harmful to man, so it is also easy to
work with for the producers.
Another application of methoprene is against
mushroom flies Mushrooms produced in a dark,
moist farm," are susceptible to these flies which
attack the fungus. The flies, however, never reach
adulthood if methoprene is used, and cannot darn
age the mushrooms. Methoprene leaves no harm
ful residue on the mushrooms, either.
Since it is so safe, methoprene can be fed to cat
tle, explained Diekman, "and the flies that
mature in the animals digestive tract never reach
adulthood, never get the chance to transmit dis
eases to cattle "
Pioneers In the field
According to the scientists, another type of
product that Zoecon is pioneering is the attrac
tant Using specific chemicals that are insect sex
and food attractants, Zoecon can lure pests into its
traps. These chemicals are specific to each
animal, and are not harmful to the environment or
other animals.
One example is the Roach Motel," marketed
bv D-Con, but made by Zoecon The idea is simple,
said Diekman, but the chemistry is complex. The
cockroach is attracted inside the box by a food at
tractant, and then sticks to the box. The consumer
then throws out the box when it is full.
The chemist, however, must produce a very
sticky substance that will not dry out, and will
carry the attractant. The consumer is in no way
harmed by the product, said the scientists.
In addition. Zoecon also produces more stan
dard products, especially in the pet consumer
line. It produces Zodiac, Vet-Kern and Pet's brand
flea and tick collars for dogs and cats, and
pioneered the "flea tag" and "tick collar." It is
the largest producer of pet pesticides, although
Hartz is the largest marketer.
The company is currently working on a heat to
lerant soybean, which would extent its growing
range. This project is years from completion,
however, according to the scientists.
"We see the 1980s as the age of biology," said
Diekman The scientists said they believe that the
control of nature naturally, through Zoecon's
products, is safer than conventional methods and
is more effective, the end result being lower food
prices and a cleaner environment.
