# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Leah Halper Where were you at lunchtime? 
### 
For most of the community, lunch was an over
powering lure at noon last Thursday, Oct. 16,
when the Office Staff Organizing Committee
(OSOC) rallied, announcing its intention to file for
a union in November. Most did not bother to come
to Old Union fountain and sing, "We shall not be
moved," and when a speaker urged office workers
to think for themselves, no professors of liter
ature or philosophy bravoed
Because being busy is the supreme justification
at Stanford. I'm wiliing to believe that everyone
was busy at the time. Carrots. Sandwiches. Milk
Those things go down better than the nagging feel
ing that we may be neglecting an increasingly im
portant social and political issue so close to home.
For the women (and a few men) who are or
ganizing to get equal pay for work of comparable
value, benefits and clearer job classifications,
however, it must have been disappointing to rec
ognize onlv a handful of the students and pro
fessors who so often get help from office staffers.
Already we are acting the indifferent consumers
and managers; when the OSOC effort succeeds
(as it is likelv to do i. will we be taken by surprise 0

In the hierarchy of the
University, many students feel a
little brighter and more
important than the office
staffers.

Staff unionization will certainly affect every
one. A local drive for signatures to force a union
vote is part of the national push for office work
ers' rights. Most office workers are women; the
majority are unionless. Many have stopped be
lieving that unions are only for blue-collar work
ers. Office organizing will be the labor issue of the
80s.
As Stanford students graduate and find in
teresting. flexible, well-compensated jobs, they
will be taking for granted what clericals are fight
ing for. If for no other reason, then, we might pay
attention to OSOC because the complaints here
will echo in the companies and agencies we may
soon own. administer or develop.
And. if professors want to continue their good
research and smooth teaching, they must be sen
sitive to the fact that no intelligent, eloquent,
dead-ended secretary can long feel adequately re
warded by the hollow compliment, "I could not
have completed this work without the invaluable
aid of my secretary. . . ."
For humble pay. office workers hold up the sky
at Stanford. Usually they do what others define as
important, and the workload is enormous. It is un
wise to seem overly independent ("power-hun
gry") even when direction from above is unclear
or uninformed.
Though deadlines press often, an office work
er's time belongs to everyone but her himself.

People with trivial questions which could be an
swered with a telephone call or directory instead
pester the nearest receptionist. Office workers of
all ages are subject to sex-object treatment they
may be in no position to protest — "Honey" dif
fers only in degree from unsolicited physical in
timacies,
Office work is also physically stressful: poorly
designed furniture and fluorescent lighting can
cause bodily strain, and there is some evidence
that copy machine chemicals and typewriter
erase fluid cause cancer or birth defects.
Canny businessmen realized years ago that
women can humanize desolate offices. Part of the
unspoken expectation was that women would take
working conditions cheerfully and still manage an
efficient office. Amazingly, grumpiness towards
students and professors is rare here; most office
workers at Stanford enjoy the academic environ
ment Those with other complaints, however, are
subject to a shabby grievance procedure, and they
can be chided for behavior deemed inappropriate
by their superiors, even if their behavior is not
work-related.
Their superiors. When you take an office job
you get superiors On a university campus like
ours, as much a business as an institution of learn
ing. the heirarchy is well defined, and it is
strengthened by an almost classist separation be
tween office workers and academics.
Ironically, the goals and concerns of students
and office workers, or professors and office work
ers, may be surprisingly similar. Certainly the
groups are not so far apart in terms of educational
background; most staffers here are college
educated and some have graduate degrees. Still. I
have never heard a student initiate a conversation
with a staffer on principles of physics or George
Sand's work. Everyone is very busy, and it takes
some ef fort to relate to someone who you perceive
to be in a different world.
And. I suspect, in the hierarchy of the Univer
sity many students feel themselves a little
brighter and more important than the office staf
fers The feeling is not so much an objective re
flection of reality as an assumption adopted as a
consequence of attending a prestigious univer
sity.
None of us can afford, of course, to separate
school from life and education from learning. But
so many academics missed a chance last week to
learn something important at the OSOC rally.
OSOC does not need support based on a sudden,
guilty realization that office workers make Stan
ford possible. But support based on recognition of
the workers' value and strength is important, and
an atmosphere of solidarity might help the or
ganizing effort gain clout.
Labor struggles are most often won after hours,
during other peoples' lunches and coffee-breaks,
and with the slow conviction of not giving up. The
OSOC struggle is better fought with students and
faculty than against them.

In the hierarchy of the
University, many students feel a

Staff unionization will certainly affect every
one. A local drive for signatures to force a union
vote is part of the national push for office work
ers' rights. Most office workers are women; the
majority are unionless. Many have stopped be
lieving that unions are only for blue-collar work
ers. Office organizing will be the labor issue of the
80s.
As Stanford students graduate and find in
teresting. flexible, well-compensated jobs, they
will be taking for granted what clericals are fight
ing for. If for no other reason, then, we might pay
attention to OSOC because the complaints here
will echo in the companies and agencies we may

aid of my secretary. . . ."
For humble pay. office workers hold up the sky
at Stanford. Usually they do what others define as
important, and the workload is enormous. It is un
wise to seem overly independent ("power-hun

or uninformed.
Though deadlines press often, an office work

Office work is also physically stressful: poorly

cause bodily strain, and there is some evidence
that copy machine chemicals and typewriter

Canny businessmen realized years ago that
women can humanize desolate offices. Part of the
unspoken expectation was that women would take

efficient office. Amazingly, grumpiness towards

you get superiors On a university campus like
ours, as much a business as an institution of learn

strengthened by an almost classist separation be
tween office workers and academics.
Ironically, the goals and concerns of students
and office workers, or professors and office work
ers, may be surprisingly similar. Certainly the
groups are not so far apart in terms of educational
background; most staffers here are college
educated and some have graduate degrees. Still. I
have never heard a student initiate a conversation
with a staffer on principles of physics or George
Sand's work. Everyone is very busy, and it takes
some ef fort to relate to someone who you perceive
to be in a different world.

None of us can afford, of course, to separate
school from life and education from learning. But
so many academics missed a chance last week to
learn something important at the OSOC rally.
OSOC does not need support based on a sudden,
guilty realization that office workers make Stan

the workers' value and strength is important, and
an atmosphere of solidarity might help the or

Labor struggles are most often won after hours,
during other peoples' lunches and coffee-breaks,
and with the slow conviction of not giving up. The
OSOC struggle is better fought with students and
faculty than against them.
