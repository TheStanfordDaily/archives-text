## An American take-over would be best 
### 
When a country that possesses valuable
resources is threatened bv a communist na
tion that does not provide the inalienable
right of liberty to its people, the threatened
country must be protected. In these cases, it
is the responsibility of stronger free nations
to take over the threatened country in order
to spread and protect its democracy and
ensure that the threatened country's re
sources are used for the development and
growth of the two nations and their people.
In recent years, it has become evident
that Russia, a communist nation that denies
liberty to its people, is taking significant
moves to increase its potential hold on the
Middle East. The invasion of Afghanistan is
a clear threat to the area. With Afghanistan.
Russia now has the power to drive to the
Gulf of Oman, an important military point,
simply by inciting unrest between Iran and
Pakistan in the Baluchistan province.
The largest country in the immediate
area. Saudi Arabia, is dangerously threat
ened by Soviet powers. Even the Prime Min
ister of Saudi Arabia admits, "The Soviet
Union is a few short steps from our doorstep
— it is simply a matter of time before the
confrontation will become more acute." A
Russian-controlled Saudi Arabia would pro
duce disastrous consequences for the free
world, as the country is the owner of one
fourth of the world's proven oil reserves,
over 160 billion barrels.
One militarily strong free nation, the
United States, needs to secure increased oil
reserves. Currently, the U.S. is forced to
import nearly half of its oil, which has
created an awesome national deficit.
Looking ahead, there are few signs that
American demand for the precious com
modity will decrease. Oil and gas play tre
mendous roles in the U.S. economy, from
the manufacture of goods to agriculture.
Agriculture alone consumes about 15
percent of all energy used in the country.

Energy has made it possible for American
farmers to grow abundant supplies of food,
both for themselves and for much of the rest
of the world. For example, American
farmers can now grow three and one-half as
much corn per acre as they could 30 years
ago. but they also use four times as much
energy in the process for cultivating,
fertilizing and harvesting. Similar ex
amples can be drawn from almost any other
industry. Expansion of the American Gross
National Product (GNP) in the past two
decades, driven by increased energy use,
has provided jobs for 33 million additional
people. Put simply, it is clear that addi
tional American growth cannot occur
without sufficient energy to sustain it.
Two significant problems, that of the
communist threat to the people of Saudi
Arabia and the American people's need for
additional oil reserves, could be solved with
one swift action: if the United States were
to take over Saudi Arabia and annex it as an
energy colony.
Some observers may object to this con
clusion. for reasons ranging from injustice
to the Saudi Arabian people, to a lack of
American military capability to take and
protect such a maneuver, to the argument
of "We have no right to take what is not
ours." Each of these arguments, however,
can be overcome.
In terms of the people of Saudi Arabia, an
American take-over would be the best thing
that ever happened to them. At present, the
laborers, who comprise 90 percent of the
population, receive salaries which, by
American standards would be incom
prehensible. If America were to take over
the nation, and pay the workers $3000 per
year, over double their present salary, it
would cost about $30 billion, which is con
siderably less than what we now (and will)
pay for oil. Both the American and Saudi
people stand to gain from this deal. In addi

tion, American technology could be ex
pended in the area, improving such
atrocities as a 15 percent literacy rate and
severe deficiencies in public services.
The actual take-over of Saudi Arabia
could be achieved through a variety of ways.
The United States could offer total military
protection against Russia and induction as
the 51st state, in return for oil. If the
monarchial government would reject such a
deal, a revolution could easily be en
couraged by American intelligence forces.
Since the attack of the Sacred Mosque in
Mecca, it has become evident that the royal
family may not be as omnipotent as they
once believed. With the toppling of that gov
ernment. the U.S. could simply move in to
prevent further widespread destruction. A
third method could be a simple military at
tack, similar to Russia's recent invasion of
Afghanistan. Seeing that we have most of
the spare parts to their weapons, Saudi Ara
bia could easily be protected.
Finally, the issue of morality needs to be
answered. When one considers the conse
quences of such an action, the issue seems to
boil down to a decision between morality
and practicality. With the constant threat of
Russia, it seems illogical for the free na
tions of the world not to protect their own in
terests. With an extensive supply of oil, such
as Saudi Arabia's, America could destroy
the OPEC conspiracy, from placing 50 cent
per barrel crude oil on the market, to stop
ping the influx of American dollars.
Put simply, oil is oil — and may very pos
sibly make the difference between the pro
tection and strangulation of democratic
peoples. In this case, the end does justify the
means.
The solution to our problems is waiting
for definitive action — with the creation of
the United States of Saudi Arabia.

quences of such an action, the issue seems to
boil down to a decision between morality
and practicality. With the constant threat of
Russia, it seems illogical for the free na
tions of the world not to protect their own in
terests. With an extensive supply of oil, such
as Saudi Arabia's, America could destroy
the OPEC conspiracy, from placing 50 cent
per barrel crude oil on the market, to stop
ping the influx of American dollars.
Put simply, oil is oil — and may very pos
sibly make the difference between the pro
tection and strangulation of democratic
peoples. In this case, the end does justify the
means.
The solution to our problems is waiting
for definitive action — with the creation of
the United States of Saudi Arabia.

When a country that possesses valuable
resources is threatened bv a communist na
tion that does not provide the inalienable
right of liberty to its people, the threatened
country must be protected. In these cases, it
is the responsibility of stronger free nations
to take over the threatened country in order
to spread and protect its democracy and
ensure that the threatened country's re
sources are used for the development and
growth of the two nations and their people.
In recent years, it has become evident
that Russia, a communist nation that denies
liberty to its people, is taking significant
moves to increase its potential hold on the
Middle East. The invasion of Afghanistan is
a clear threat to the area. With Afghanistan.
Russia now has the power to drive to the
Gulf of Oman, an important military point,
simply by inciting unrest between Iran and
Pakistan in the Baluchistan province.
The largest country in the immediate
area. Saudi Arabia, is dangerously threat
ened by Soviet powers. Even the Prime Min
ister of Saudi Arabia admits, "The Soviet
Union is a few short steps from our doorstep
— it is simply a matter of time before the
confrontation will become more acute." A
Russian-controlled Saudi Arabia would pro
duce disastrous consequences for the free
world, as the country is the owner of one
fourth of the world's proven oil reserves,
over 160 billion barrels.
One militarily strong free nation, the
United States, needs to secure increased oil
reserves. Currently, the U.S. is forced to
import nearly half of its oil, which has
created an awesome national deficit.
Looking ahead, there are few signs that
American demand for the precious com
modity will decrease. Oil and gas play tre
mendous roles in the U.S. economy, from
the manufacture of goods to agriculture.
Agriculture alone consumes about 15
percent of all energy used in the country.

Energy has made it possible for American
farmers to grow abundant supplies of food,
both for themselves and for much of the rest
of the world. For example, American
farmers can now grow three and one-half as
much corn per acre as they could 30 years
ago. but they also use four times as much
energy in the process for cultivating,
fertilizing and harvesting. Similar ex
amples can be drawn from almost any other
industry. Expansion of the American Gross
National Product (GNP) in the past two
decades, driven by increased energy use,
has provided jobs for 33 million additional
people. Put simply, it is clear that addi
tional American growth cannot occur
without sufficient energy to sustain it.
Two significant problems, that of the
communist threat to the people of Saudi
Arabia and the American people's need for
additional oil reserves, could be solved with
one swift action: if the United States were
to take over Saudi Arabia and annex it as an
energy colony.
Some observers may object to this con
clusion. for reasons ranging from injustice
to the Saudi Arabian people, to a lack of
American military capability to take and
protect such a maneuver, to the argument
of "We have no right to take what is not
ours." Each of these arguments, however,
can be overcome.
In terms of the people of Saudi Arabia, an
American take-over would be the best thing
that ever happened to them. At present, the
laborers, who comprise 90 percent of the
population, receive salaries which, by
American standards would be incom
prehensible. If America were to take over
the nation, and pay the workers $3000 per
year, over double their present salary, it
would cost about $30 billion, which is con
siderably less than what we now (and will)
pay for oil. Both the American and Saudi
people stand to gain from this deal. In addi

tion, American technology could be ex
pended in the area, improving such
atrocities as a 15 percent literacy rate and
severe deficiencies in public services.
The actual take-over of Saudi Arabia
could be achieved through a variety of ways.
The United States could offer total military
protection against Russia and induction as
the 51st state, in return for oil. If the
monarchial government would reject such a
deal, a revolution could easily be en
couraged by American intelligence forces.
Since the attack of the Sacred Mosque in
Mecca, it has become evident that the royal
family may not be as omnipotent as they
once believed. With the toppling of that gov
ernment. the U.S. could simply move in to
prevent further widespread destruction. A
third method could be a simple military at
tack, similar to Russia's recent invasion of
Afghanistan. Seeing that we have most of
the spare parts to their weapons, Saudi Ara
bia could easily be protected.

answered. When one considers the conse
quences of such an action, the issue seems to
