## The 						Honor Code, grades and doubts 
### 
Little concerning the Stan
ford academic system attracts
as much attention among stu
dents as the Honor Code. But
most of the debate on the Honor
Code misses the point entirely.
Why?
The whole Honor Code issue
has to be viewed in a broader
perspective to be properly un
derstood. It has to be seen in the
context of a system of education
that promotes individual learn
ing experiences over others,
that serves as one more step in
the process of occupational
stratification, and that propa
gates the dominant ideology not
only through what is taught, but
by the manner in which it is
done.
One of the central underlying
assumptions of this system is
that competition is the best
means of obtaining an educa
tion. The other major assump
tion is that people learn only as
individuals. Combined, we ob
tain a system where competi
tion among individuals is the
salient factor. What is so wrong
with that?
Almost everything. In stress
ing only the individually com
petitive aspects of learning, a
whole field of richly rewarding
possibilities is left out. What
students can learn in groups is

at least as useful as what they
can learn alone. In an increas
ingly complex society, decisions
and actions are taken more and
more often by committee rather
than individuals. But this is not
the only benefit.
Knowledge, being actively
constructed rather than pas
sively received, finds fertile
ground in the process of
dialogue that takes place in an
interactive learning situation.
Books and lecturers cannot sub
stitute for substantial dialogue.
Most important of all though,
is the importance of stressing
the human aspects of education.
Knowledge that is not grounded
in the human experience is
worthless — it can only serve
some abstract metaphysics, or
dehumanize, or worse still, as
with nuclear armaments,
threaten to bring about our own
destruction.
Competition between people
causes alienation. It dis
courages students from making
friends. For example, in a
classroom where physical prox
imity would seem to be ideal for
meeting people with similar in
terests. competition effectively
puts up a barrier. Why should

you be friendly towards some
one whom you may inadvertent
ly help to get a higher grade?
For those who have just joined
Stanford, and especially for
those away from home for the
first time, this alienation can
prove particularly traumatic.
By segregating people into in
dividual pockets, existing in op
position to each other, student
inspired change is effectively
curtailed. Thus, the collective
energy of the student body (the
possible result of bringing to
gether a large group of people
with similar interests) is never
allowed to materialize in con
crete changes that affect its
education. If not totally
fragmented, it is allowed to dis
sipate in harmless symbolic
acts, preferably vicariously ex
perienced, like school sports.
But how is this system of in
ter-individual conflict main
tained so successfully? Very
simply. Grades. Grades are the
reward and exams the medi
ators of this battle between stu
dents. If the object of tests was
merely to determine how well
you knew the material, why
should the practice of "grading
on a curve" — where your posi

tion relative to others is all-im
portant — be so popular?
Of course, grades indicate
where you will end up in the hi
erarchy of occupations, but
most students probably do not
perceive anything but a vague
link between their grade in Hu
man Biology 10 and the amount
of money they will receive upon
graduating. Grades are an end
in themselves. They earn the af
fection of parents, the admira
tion of professors and the envy
of fellow students.
In this context, the Honor
Code plays a very important
role. It legitimizes this situation
of inter-personal conflict. More
importantly, it invests it with
moral authority. You are bound
by your honor to limit the scope
of your education, to de
humanize, and to alienate your
self. Getting rid of the Honor
Code will not solve those more
essential structural problems of
which it is a pathological symp
tom. Nevertheless, as the vis
ible tip of the iceberg, it should
be the first to go in any effort at
serious change

sively received, finds fertile
ground in the process of
dialogue that takes place in an
interactive learning situation.
Books and lecturers cannot sub
stitute for substantial dialogue.
Most important of all though,
is the importance of stressing
the human aspects of education.
Knowledge that is not grounded
in the human experience is
worthless — it can only serve
some abstract metaphysics, or
dehumanize, or worse still, as
with nuclear armaments,
threaten to bring about our own
destruction.
Competition between people
causes alienation. It dis
courages students from making
friends. For example, in a
classroom where physical prox
imity would seem to be ideal for
meeting people with similar in
terests. competition effectively
puts up a barrier. Why should

you be friendly towards some
one whom you may inadvertent
ly help to get a higher grade?
For those who have just joined
Stanford, and especially for
those away from home for the
first time, this alienation can
prove particularly traumatic.
By segregating people into in
dividual pockets, existing in op
position to each other, student
inspired change is effectively
curtailed. Thus, the collective
energy of the student body (the
possible result of bringing to
gether a large group of people
with similar interests) is never
allowed to materialize in con
crete changes that affect its
education. If not totally
fragmented, it is allowed to dis
sipate in harmless symbolic
acts, preferably vicariously ex
perienced, like school sports.
But how is this system of in
ter-individual conflict main
tained so successfully? Very
simply. Grades. Grades are the
reward and exams the medi
ators of this battle between stu
dents. If the object of tests was
merely to determine how well
you knew the material, why
should the practice of "grading
on a curve" — where your posi

tion relative to others is all-im
portant — be so popular?
Of course, grades indicate
where you will end up in the hi
erarchy of occupations, but
most students probably do not
perceive anything but a vague
link between their grade in Hu
man Biology 10 and the amount
of money they will receive upon
graduating. Grades are an end
in themselves. They earn the af
fection of parents, the admira
tion of professors and the envy
of fellow students.
In this context, the Honor
Code plays a very important
role. It legitimizes this situation
of inter-personal conflict. More
importantly, it invests it with
moral authority. You are bound
by your honor to limit the scope
of your education, to de
humanize, and to alienate your
self. Getting rid of the Honor
Code will not solve those more
essential structural problems of
which it is a pathological symp
tom. Nevertheless, as the vis
ible tip of the iceberg, it should
be the first to go in any effort at
serious change
(Akhil Gupta is a graduate stu
dent in engineering-economic
systems.)
Little concerning the Stan
ford academic system attracts
as much attention among stu
dents as the Honor Code. But
most of the debate on the Honor
Code misses the point entirely.
Why?
The whole Honor Code issue
has to be viewed in a broader
perspective to be properly un
derstood. It has to be seen in the
context of a system of education
that promotes individual learn
ing experiences over others,
that serves as one more step in
the process of occupational
stratification, and that propa
gates the dominant ideology not
only through what is taught, but
by the manner in which it is
done.
One of the central underlying
assumptions of this system is
that competition is the best
means of obtaining an educa
tion. The other major assump
tion is that people learn only as
individuals. Combined, we ob
tain a system where competi
tion among individuals is the
salient factor. What is so wrong
with that?
Almost everything. In stress
ing only the individually com
petitive aspects of learning, a
whole field of richly rewarding
possibilities is left out. What
students can learn in groups is

at least as useful as what they
can learn alone. In an increas
ingly complex society, decisions
and actions are taken more and
more often by committee rather
than individuals. But this is not
the only benefit.
Knowledge, being actively
constructed rather than pas
sively received, finds fertile
ground in the process of
dialogue that takes place in an
interactive learning situation.
Books and lecturers cannot sub
stitute for substantial dialogue.
