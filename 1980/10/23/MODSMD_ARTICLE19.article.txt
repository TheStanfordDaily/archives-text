Course surveys
I would like to respond to the
opinion by Kim Rachmeler on
student evaluations (Daily, Oct.
15) by commenting on the two
ways student evaluations are
used: they are used as a means
of communication from student
to teacher, and they are used as
a way of evaluating teaching. I
have no real quarrel with the
former (or Rachmeler) al
though I have some misgivings
on this score.
I believe that a well thought
out essay would be much prefer
able to a form. However, I do
not believe that communication
between student and teacher is
the main purpose of these eval
uations. They are in fact used by
both the administration and the
ASSU as a means of evaluating
teacher performance.
What is the significance of
these evaluations? The informa
tion available contains no good
answers. To begin with, how do
you assess the bias introduced
by the fact that usually only 50
percent or less of a class re
sponds? I am told by experts
that statisticians consider data
from a less-than-75 percent re
sponse to be worthless when the
factors determining whether or
not a student participates are
unknown.
Even when the response is 100
percent, the meaning to be at
tached to the evaluations is far
from clear. There have been nu
merous studies on this subject;
typical of these is a carefully
controlled experiment made by
Miriam and Burton Rodin in
1972 which involved 293 UCSD
students in several sections of
an undergraduate calculus
course. They found a negative
correlation between student
evaluation and amount learned
of -.75. In fact, the students of
the three instructors with the
lowest student ratings learned
the most.
In general I have found that
student responses to the eval
uation forms vary all over the 1
to 7 range in any given course,
depending in part on what mate
rial was presented. If a teacher
tilts his course toward the bet
ter students the poorer ones be
come frustrated, whereas if he
spends all his time on routine
material the brighter ones are
bored. The resulting spread of
grades is difficult to interpret.
For these reasons I am

against the use of student eval
uations as a measure of
teaching performance. I find it
hard to understand how the ad
ministration of a university
which prides itself on being ob
jective can take them seriously
â€” and believe me it does. I
would like to know how the
deans of the Undergraduate
Studies and the School of Hu
manities and Sciences justify
their use of these evaluations.

Trust cyclists
In response to Doris Troiani's
charge (Daily, Oct. 22) that
cyclists are an incessant threat
to her life. I would like to men
tion a few items. Perhaps the
pedestrian contingent will re
alize that they too are respon
sible for the cyclist/pedestrian
conflagration.
The human brain is an astoun
ding piece of machinery capable
of the most marvelous feats of
computation. Thus, when

mounted on one's steel steed the
cyclist navigates through pedes
trian and bicycle traffic by con
stantly monitoring all objects in
the area.
Therefore, a frightened pe
destrian is truly a hazard to
cyclists, because by starting
and stopping and leaping fear
fully about they destroy the flow
of motion on which cyclists base
their judgments.
I have what I consider in
disputable evidence for my the
ory. That lovable Prof, of An
thropology James Fox is such a
dedicated scholar that he walks
to his office in the Quad with his
face buried in a book! Many
times I have watched this singu
lar man go from one end of the
Quad to the other without ever
looking up.
So please, don't walk de
fensively and don't expect to get
run down. Let's all cooperate
for a safer University.
