## Report says U.S. losing scientific edge 
### 
Bv the Associated Press
Washington — A report com
missioned by the White House says the
nation has lost the momentum of its
post-Sputnik commitment to science
and most Americans are headed
"toward virtual scientific and techno
logical illiteracy."
The study released yesterday con
cludes the United States lags behind
the Soviet Union, Japan and Germany
in the rigor of elementary and secon
dary school programs in mathematics
and science.
Loss of edge
"We fear a loss of our competitive
edge," said the 230-page report pre
pared by the Department of Education
and the National Science Foundation
on orders from President Jimmy
Carter.
It cited "a serious shortage" of high
school math and science teachers and.
at the college level, "severe shortages
of qualified faculty members" in com

puter and most engineering fields.
Also, many universities are teaching
with obsolete equipment, it said.
Some reassurance
The study, "Science and Engineer
ing Education for the 1980s and
Beyond," offered some reassurance
along with expressions of alarm.
It cited current shortages of com
puter experts and most types of engi
neers. as well as scientists in a few
specialties. But it predicted that in
1990. the supply of engineers and sci
entists will meet the demand "with a
few exceptions" — the computer pro
fessions, statistics and a few engineer
ing fields.
Comparisons
"Comparisons between the United
States and our international com
petitors suggest that our eminence in
basic research is secure," said the re
port, noting that Americans wrote 38
percent of the world's scientific and
technical articles in 1977, and have

won more than half the Nobel Prizes
awarded in science since World War
11.
Despite a big overall drop in test
scores, math and science majors'
scores remain high on both the Scho
lastic Aptitude Test and the Graduate
Record Examination, the study said.
The report sharply criticized high
school science and math courses that
"focus on the structure of the
academic discipline."
After the Soviet Union launched
Sputnik, the first orbital satellite, in
October 1957, the federal government
augmented its research commitments
and helped develop courses to teach
future scientists.
Desperate need
Those post-Sputnik programs
served their purpose, but it cited a
"desperate need" for courses for non
science majors that "could provide
students with a better basis for under-

standing and dealing with the science
and technology they encounter as
citizens, workers and private individ
uals."
It sounded a similar criticism of
"theoretical and esoteric" college
courses.
