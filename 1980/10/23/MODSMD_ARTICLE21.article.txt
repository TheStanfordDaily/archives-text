# Surrounded by mountains, three lakes and two creeks, Stanford land offers runners several exhilarating jogs

limited only by imagination and leg power. The key words are run
and explore. So, if your gluteus muscles are willing, here are two
medium distance loops to try. Both are popular because they com
bine scenery and accessibility and are clear of cars.
The Dish run
The first run is a 4.2-mile loop in the foothills, named for the fami
ly of radio telescopes along the way. Although this run involves
about a 400 foot ascent, the spectacular panorama of the Bay Area
makes up for the climb and provides a good excuse to stop at the top.
Start at the corner of Campus Drive and Mayfield Avenue. Run
west along Campus and turn down Gerona Road. Crossing a small
field to Junipero Serra, you'll find a large gate with a road leading
into the hills. This will take you to the ridge and along about 1.5
miles of gradual slopes while you run past large, medium and small
dishes, sometimes known as Daddy, Mommy and Baby.
Your highest point is marked by a large white box harboring a
tiny four-foot dish (Baby). From here it is all downhill to another
gate on Junipero Serra Boulevard and then along Frenchman's
Road to Mayfield.
Most of the dish road is unforgiving asphalt so you may want to
stay along the side or take one of the dirt trails that runs parallel to
it.
Early morning scenery
If you enjoy wildlife, the best time to run the dish is early in the
morning (before class). Deer, foxes and bobcats have all been
spotted, in addition to the 800 cows that graze there during the
school year.
Under an agreement with Piers Dairy, which leases the land
from the University, runners can use this trail as long as they first
obtain a permit from Encina Hall, available upon presentation of a
Stanford I D. This card should be carried with you while running.
Ruby Ridge trail run
This run is a scenic 3.9-mile loop that borders on the west side of
campus. It is a good alternative for those who aren't crazy about
climbing hills but still enjoy running in serene natural surround
ings. This is also a good run for hot weather, since most of the trail is
shaded by trees and lush vegetation.
Begin at Roble Gym. Run across Roble Field to Searsville Road
and then out to Willow Road. From there, the Ruby Ridge trail fol
lows San Francisquito Creek for an Amazon-like 1.5 miles of crawl
ing vines and green algae until you reach the Children's Hospital.
The Jungle Rook world ends here, and the asphalt parking lot of
Saks and Bullock's begins.
Crossing Quarry Road, you step back on campus and into the cul
tural segment of the run. The trail south of Arboretum Road leads
into a wooded area where you pass Lathrop's tomb, the Mausoleum
and the Stanford Museum. Continue up Lomita until you reach the
Quad or whatever class you may be late for.
Short cuts
Both the dish and Ruby Ridge runs can be shortened or
lengthened to suit your legs by altering the route you take into cam
pus. If you're really intense, you may want to combine the two and
make a nine-mile loop.
For those who are into competition, 30 minutes is considered a
very good time for the dish run while 25 minutes is unbelievable.
Ruby Ridge may take a few minutes less if you can make it through
the creek segment without a machete.

"Running at Stanford'' series. Look for part two tomorrow and
more about running in the coming weeks.)
