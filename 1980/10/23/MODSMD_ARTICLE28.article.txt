## Prague Quartet shines 
### Mary Loeffelholz 
The Prague String Quartet overcame an un
inspired beginning to present an afternoon of
excellent music for the near-capacity crowd
attending last Sunday's concert in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Opening with Mozart's Quartet in D Minor,
K. 421, the Prague ensemble displayed strong
and consistent group coordination from the
start. The individual performances, however,
suffered from a lack of intensity. First vio
linist Bretislav Novotny, though technically
adept, did not in the first movement command
a tone rich enough for his part.
The second movement warmed up con
siderably, thanks to Novotny, who carried the
theme over simple obligato chords in the other
instruments. The cello's accompaniment in
the Trio was the only blot on the lively beauty
of the third movement; Jean Sire sent his
pizzicato off with too much vibrato, upsetting
the ensemble balance slightly and undoing the
delicacy of the quartet's phrasing.
Ensemble coordination made the fourth
movement shine. Second violinist Karel Pribyl
joined Novotny in octaves as the quartet
played out variations on an energetic dance
theme. The movement ends abruptly, with a
sense of completion but not of repose; here the
Prague ensemble did full justice to the work's
controlled tension
The quartet members were clearly on famil
iar ground in Prokofiev's String Quartet No. 2
in F Major, Opus 92. Their authority was im
mediately evident in the roughly vigorous first
movement. The Prokofiev quartet offered
more opportunities for individual fireworks

than the Mozart, and the musicians rose to the
challenge.
Cellist Sire's romanticism found a happier
place here than it had in the Mozart, particu
larly in the second movement. The cello's up
per register sang out over the accompaniment
of open, remotely oriental chords. The final
movement featured a showy display of spicat
to bowing, brilliantly executed, especially in
the passages between Sire and violist Lubomir
Maly. Although short, the Prokofiev Quartet
was probably the most consistently satisfying
offering on Sunday's program.
The concluding work of the afternoon was
Dvorak's Quartet in A flat Major, Opus 105.
The members of the Prague String Quartet
might be expected to have a special affinity for
the music of Dvorak, who was himself a native
Czechoslovakian and a citizen of Prague.
After a confident start, the quartet lost some
direction in the first and second movements.
The most important voices were not always
the ones that emerged most forcefully. The in
trinsic melodic appeal of Dvorak's composi
tion, however, sustained the performance until
the fourth movement, when the ensemble once
more took firm control, bringing the quartet to
its exciting finish with style, precision and
grace.
After several curtain calls, the quartet re
turned to the stage for an encore. The second
movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in B
flat Major, Opus 130, lasted barely two minutes
but left no doubts about the virtuosity of the
Prague String Quartet, either individually or
as a group. It was a brilliant end to a polished
concert.
