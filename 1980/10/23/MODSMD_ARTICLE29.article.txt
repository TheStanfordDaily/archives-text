# Almost better than TV

### Shelly Stevenson 
Life sometimes imitates art.
Or so they say. Indeed, Monday
night I found myself at the open
ing of a play about the opening of
a play. Footlight Frenzy, an
American Conservatory Thea
ter presentation now playing at
the Marine s Memorial Theatre
in San Francisco, creates actors
performing a play about actors
acting in a play.
Catchy idea, almost
metaphysical. It's been done by
some of the greats. Un
fortunately, Footlight Frenzy
owes more to the painful,
puerile humor of Tim Conway
than to the subtle art of a Borges
or Pirandello.
The plot centers around the
efforts of broken-down im
presario Tony Langdon (Ron
House) to salvage his career
through one last stage prod
uction. The cast of his play con
sists of Laura, a hysterical
Thorazine-gulping actress
played by Diz White, and her
bumbling husband Nicky (Alan
Sherman), as the romantic
leads. They are supported by an
excitable ingenue (Anna
(Mathias), a lascivious villian
(Ron Vernan), and the hapless
stage manager Benny, who
joins the cast when the original
actor fails to show. Naturally,
every conceivable mishap
befalls this shabby little theatri
cal venture and these fiascos
serve to advance the dramatic
action.
Actually, Footlight Frenzy is
not theater at all but one long
TV situation comedy. What
promises to be a high-camp.

peek-a-boo parody of the
capricious, glamorous world of
the actor proves to be a low
brow rehashing of weather
beaten theater cliches. In fact,
the production is rather like a
protracted Carol Burnett skit,
relying heavily on slapstick and
repetitive gags. Guns that mis
fire and flying toupes abound.
True, the play does have its
funny moments and boasts a
strong cast, many of whom have
roots in television. Roger
Bumpass, who plays Benny, is a
veteran of National Lampoon
troupes. Diz White and Alan
Sherman co-wrote and produced
The Low Moan Spectacular
comedy special recently aired
on ABC. Nonetheless, White
comes off like Burnett imitating
Gloria Swanson's Nora
Desmond. Bumpass succeeds as

a master of schtick but obvious
ly combines a Jerry Lewis
falsetto with lots of Tim Conway
shuffling. To his credit, House
creates a wonderful character
in Uncle Julian, the rich old
fogey in our play-within-a-play,
"Tarnished Silver."
In general, the comic timing
throughout the play is good, the
material is not. You may find
yourself snickering
shamefacedly at occasional
brilliant moments, but as enter
tainment faire it's bleached
bones at best. A better bargain
would be the $3.50 you spent to
see Airplane. Better yet, stay
home and watch a couple of
hours of primetime television.
Afterall, ABC will have to
launch its new lineup one of
these days.
