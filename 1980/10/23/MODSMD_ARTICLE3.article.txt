"No matter what happens on Nov. 4,
we'll have a bad president who we'll
have to start opposing the next day,"
Jim Chapin, national director of the
Democratic Socialist Organizing
Committee (DSOC) told an audience
in Skilling Auditorium last night.
Chapin, in a speech entitled "Ap
proaching the '80s from the Left,"
pointed to what he called "minimal
disagreements" between the major
candidates and the fact that the Liber
tarian Party is expected to collect the
most votes among the minor parties,
as indications of the "depressing" sit
uation in 1980 America.
"The left was wrong about the
'705," Chapin said, "the right has
gained ground in a way that no one
thought was possible. Chapin said both
the major candidates' positions on is
sues like defense spending and the fed
eral income tax show a conservative
shift.
"In 1976 there was general agree
ment among the candidates that de
tente was central to American defense
policy. Now Carter, Reagan and An

derson all accept an increase in de
fence spending. 'Reindustrialization'
has become a buzzword of this cam
paign and used to justify the upward
shift in tax structure. Money is taken
from the poor and given to the rich to
be reinvested," he claimed.
The 38-year-old Chapin, a Demo
cratic party activist and former pro
fessor of history at Yale and Rutgers
Universities, is speaking at each of the
50 DSOC local chapters across the
country, as well as to campus chapters
like Stanford's.
Chapin said that socialism and col
lective economic power are the only
solutions to America's questions in the
1980s, but acknowledged, "The prob
lem with saying i am a socialist' is
that it's like sitting down next to some
one and saying, 'I bite my toenails.' "
'' People ask us why we use the term
socialist, but once you say using so
cialist is a no-no, everything ( meaning
the ideals and philosophies) goes with
it,"he said.
Chapin suggested that socialism of
fers to society the idea that life mat

ters and also a sense of collective re
sponsibility, ideals which he said are
absent from society presently. This is
reflected in the views of the young cor
porate geniuses who say they don't
want to have children, Chapin said.
"There is no longer the idea that the
system works and a better way can be
built for their children," he said.
Chapin's organization. DSOC. was
founded in 1973 by former members of
the Socialist Party active in the 1960 s.
The group currently claims a mem
bership of more than 4400, and has as
members labor leaders, political fig
ures like Oakland's congressman, Ron
Dellums, and feminist activist Gloria
Steinem.
The DSOC chapter here is entering
its third year and claims to have a core
group of about ten members. DSOC
activities on campus have included
anti-draft registration efforts, as well
as support of several labor groups, in
cluding the employess of the Coffee
House who struck last year, the Cow
ell nurses and the university's clerical
employees.

founded in 1973 by former members of
the Socialist Party active in the 1960 s.
The group currently claims a mem

group of about ten members. DSOC
activities on campus have included
anti-draft registration efforts, as well
as support of several labor groups, in

House who struck last year, the Cow
