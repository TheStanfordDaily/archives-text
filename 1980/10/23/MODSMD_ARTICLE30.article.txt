# Clear-sighted view of gay life

The Gay Theater Collective builds up its
plays from improvisations, tapings, tran
scriptions, re-working, and much dis
cussion. The final product becomes an out
let for the emotions, anger, and ideas of the
many people who contribute to the prod
uction. Since the Collective chooses topics
affecting many people in the San Francisco
gay community, its plays also act as a pub
lic focus for the concerns of this communi
ty. The results are not just scrapbooks of
barely related ideas, though. Much time is
spent insuring that there is structure and a
good dramatic flow. Their latest prod
uction. Contents Under Pressure, deals
with the effects of anti-gay violence on the
occupants of a San Francisco Victorian.
There are three apartments within the
house. Stuart (played by Richard La Rose)
is a single man in his 30s who manages the
house. Leigh (Gail Golden), a 35-year-old
single mother and Daniel (Timothy But
ters), her 17-year-old punk son, live next
door. A lesbian couple, Rachel and Jodi
(Vola Ruben and Susan Dambroff), live
downstairs; Marc (Charles Solomon),
Jodi's brother, is staying with them until he
finds a job and an apartment of his own.
They wake up one morning to discover "Kill
Queers" sprav-painted on the front of their
house.
Daniel, as a punk teenager with friends
who regularly harass the occupants of the
house, is naturally suspected of being in
volved in the act or at least of knowing who
did it. Stuart comes down very hard on
Daniel, too hard it seems. In the past, Stuart
has given Daniel part-time jobs and been
very sympathetic to him. But now, he ac
cuses Daniel of being involved without any
evidence. At the end of Act I, Stuart physi
cally attacks Daniel.
The other characters must struggle to
deal with this unfair attack. As victims of
random harassment and violence, the other
occupants of the house (including Daniel's
mother who is faced with the possibility of
rape) are very tempted to join with Stuart in
accusing Daniel of complicity in the act. But
they also realize that there is little justifi
cation for Stuart's accusations, and that the
attacks on Daniel because of his appearance
and acquaintances are just as unfair as the
attacks on them because they are gay.

In Act 11. in an emotionally wrenching
scene, Stuart's anger is explained. As an act
of reconciliation, Leigh (Daniel's mother)
has invited Stuart over for dinner. After
wards, Leigh casually asks how Stephen,
Stuart's lover, died. Stuart's lover did not
die. He was killed. Coming home from a
party, Stuart and Stephen were attacked by
a gang of teenagers. Stuart was held down
while Stephen was beaten and stabbed.
The drama is resolved, in a sense, by hav
ing Daniel accidentally overhear Stuart's
story. He later admits to Jodi that his
friends had painted the graffiti. The play
ends with Marc attempting friendship with
Stuart.
At the beginning of the play, the charac
ters are very simply drawn. This allows the
audience to identify very quickly with one or
more of the characters. At the very best, the
characters are recognizable as typical
members of the gay community. In a play
such as this, which is a form of therapy for a
whole community, this identification is
very important, and contributes to much of
the success of the play.
Scenes of people making dinner, telling
what they did last night, reading letters
from home, are important in helping the au
dience understand the people on stage.
These scenes strengthen our relationships
with the characters. Because so many of
them are very humorous, they also help to
relieve the tension which builds up as a re
sult of Stuart's anger. Without these
glimpses into the characters' daily lives,
the Collective would run the risk of having
the stage peopled by political figureheads.
When the play remains personal and natu
ralistic, it works very well. Audience identi
fication is crucial in this play, and stylized
acting and overly thought-out lines put dis
tance between cast and audience.
Early on in the play, when we know very
little about Jodi. she leaves the house and,
upon seeing the graffiti, goes into a
monologue about how "Kill Queers" makes
her want to kill. She puts a lot of anger and
emotion into her speech, but it seems to me
to be rather artificial. She has just gotten
up, she is tired, is rushing to a meeting, and
has just had a minor spat with her lover. For
her to stop and go into a very dramatic
soliloquy on the steps of the house is out of
place.

In contrast, there is a much more effec
tive scene of the same type just a few
minutes later. Rachel and Leigh leave the
apartment together, see the graffiti, and
then they both stop and face the audience. In
very flat, resigned tones, they voice their
thoughts, in no particular order, sometimes
sequentially, sometimes overlapping. Their
feelings of hopelessness, as victims of rape
and discrimination, and the range of their
thoughts create a very complex and unsettl
ing mood.
Another problem with the play is that it
attempts to bring up too many issues. It is
almost as if the actors felt that this was
their only chance to say something, so they
had better get in as much as possible. Most
of the time this is not a problem. Marc's
feelings of alienation at the bars help us to
understand his character and relate to him
better. Rachel's struggles to "come out"
professionally affect her relationship with
her very political lover. When the issues
emerge from the personal lives of the char
acters and influence the way they behave,
then the issues become essential to our un
derstanding of the characters
But. especially at the very end of the play,
I feel that some of the lines are superfluous
and unnatural. For example, just after
Stuart's description of Stephen's death,
Rachel says, "Just a little paint on the wall"
referring to the consequences of the graf
fiti. This seems to me too "arty" in the con
text of the play. Maybe some improvisa
tional experiments could lead to something
a little less forced. Shortly after this, Jodi
wonders what Stuart was like before Ste
phen died. The topic is dropped very quick
ly. The effect of a lover's death is too com
plex to bring up and then abandon so casual
ly.
But these two points are very minor. I
have rarely felt so close to characters on
stage, or found it so easy to relate to the situ
ation of a play. The transparent direction
(by Buzz Bense and Charles Solomon) and
the naturalistic acting styles have helped
this to occur. And because the play was
written collectively by the actors and the di
rector. there is a rapport within the group
that is difficult to achieve in more conven
tional theater. I was impressed by the clear
sightedness of the Collective in viewing the
gay community in San Francisco.
