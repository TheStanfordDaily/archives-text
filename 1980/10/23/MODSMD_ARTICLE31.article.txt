# Film Festival nights

It is surprising to walk into a
major film festival and find
yourself watching a film for
children, but this is exactly
what happened to me last week
at the San Francisco Interna
tional Film Festival
Indian director Satvajit
Ray's latest film. The Elephant
God, is a detective mystery for
10-year-olds The film follows
the snooping of private-eve
Felunath. a famous detective
who is on holiday in the holy city
of Benares. Every Sherlock
Holmes must have his Watson
and he is accompanied by not
one but two: his teenage cousin
Tapesh and his friend. Ganguly,
a writer of pulp adventure
stories.
The case is the disappearance
of a valuable gold statuette of
Ganesh. the Elephant God. The
three heroes, with the aid of a
lonely young boy. set about solv
ing the mystery. They en
counter various adventures in
the hands of an underworld vil
lain. who pins the petrified
writer to a board and sentences
him to a trial by a knife thrower,
an old man who coughs and
snorts and looks like he is going
to faint each time he plunges a
knife inches from the writer's
perfectly stiff body But nobody
gets hurt and good triumphs
over evil.
The three snoops uncover a
grand master plan to smuggle
stolen art treasures out of India
involving a bogus holyman. a
sadhu who insists on giving his
devoted followers fish scales
and devotional music in return
for their priceless gifts.
Out of the thousands of
screenplays registered with the
Writers Guild, it is surprising
that James Ivory decided to
make Jane Austen in Manhat
tan into a film, and even more
surprising that he managed to
find the money to do it.
The screenplay, written by
Ruth Jhabvala. a well-known
novelist and screenwriter, does
not make sense, and Ivory's
choppy style with frequent
flashbacks does not help any.
The film is a story of two rival
theater companies attempting
to produce a newly discovered
play by Jane Austen, a non

sensical and childish work writ
ten when she was 11
It is difficult to see what one
can do with a play like that, but
for Pierre, a power hungry di
rector who gets a foundation
grant to do it, the play is a
means to an end Pierre is not so
much interested in theater as in
setting himself up as a cult fig
ure: a non-violent version of
Jim Jones There is no
massacre here, except the
potential for massacre created
by the members of the audience
struggling to escape this bore of
a film.
The problem is that the film
never explains why Pierre man
ages to exercise such control
over his company of idealistic
dropouts, actors, and even a
runaway inmate of a mental
hospital. We never know why
Pierre makes Ariadne, a young
actress, leave her husband, and
makes the hypocritical patrons
of the arts shower his company
with money — most of which
goes to his personal use as does
the hard-earned money of the
actors who moonlight as taxi
drivers and singers.
Salvatore Samperi's Ernesto,
which won the Best Actor
Award for Michelle Placido at
the Berlin Film Festival last
year, gives us a look at the grow
ing pains of a teenage middle
class Jew in pre-World War I
Trieste who learns fast how to
use other people.
Ernesto claims to be a re
bellious youth — he hates school
and wants to be a violinist. On
top of it he is a socialist, but a so
cialist who likes to dress in well
tailored suits and does not shirk
from working as a jack-of-all
trades in a grain warehouse for
a money-hungry capitalist boss.
Ernesto is Italy's Duddy
Kravitz (for those who saw Ted
Kotcheff's film i. He wants to go
as far as he can. He discusses
socialism with the workers and
encourages a laborer (Michelle
Placido) in his sexual advances.
Pretence is a quality that
Ernesto shares with his boss. He
too pretends, that he is writing a
book, but is somehow always
stuck on the same paragraph.
He bets Ernesto that he will nev
er become a violinist — a bet he
wins.

It is amazing how much
Ernesto can get away with He
sits around most of the day
doing nothing, sorting his stamp
collection without getting fired
He shows no consideration
toward his mother and yet she
gives him money. Ernesto hu
miliates his lover by leaving
him naked in a warehouse while
he sneaks out without getting a
broken bottle in his face. But
what is most incredulous of all
is Ernesto's passionate affair
with a young boy.
Not only is the boy from a
wealthy family, but he has a
twin sister who falls madly for
Ernesto, and the whole affair
ends in marriage, to the sister,
of course. The whole story is a
little too much to believe;
Ernesto gets off with his angelic
face unscarred.
The film cashes in on the sen
sitivity and controversialitv of
homosexual love — taking care
not to offend the average middle
class viewer — by just going on
the borderline as many Italian
films do when dealing with risky
subjects.
