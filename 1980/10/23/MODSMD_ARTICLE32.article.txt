# Illusions big and small

### Perry Tribolet 
Movement is not only one of
film's most important distinc
tions as art. but also one of its
greatest strengths as entertain
ment. Thus "'action'' movies
abound The Stuntman is a
fascinating film that combines
the movement of people and ob
jects. in some outrageous stunt
scenes, with the movement of
ideas. Additionally, The
Stuntman has a sense of humor
about itself that makes it pretty
irresistible. Unfortunately it is
being released cautiously area
by-area and not everyone may
get a chance to see it.
The Stuntman is a kind of
celebration of filmmaking,
being in the film-within-a-film
genre. What the excitement is
all about is the thrill of creating
and entertaining. Part of the
charm of this film is that it ex
aggerates the point by depicting
a movie set crew, largely
stuntmen and stuntwomen. that
is a smidgin on the wild side.

One can't help but wonder what
it would be like to have to deal
with such madness in real life.
Take the plight of this fellow
named Lucky Cameron (Steve
Railsback). Running from the
police he stumbles onto the
aforementioned movie location
There he meets Eli Cross < Peter
O'Toole), the director, who just
in the nick of time makes Cam
eron an offer to take the job of
stuntman in exchange for being
hidden from the cops. The catch
is that he is taking the place of
another stuntman who was last
seen at the bottom of a river. Al
though Lucky has escaped the
law, his life is being determined
by the whims of a half-brilliant,
totally crazed moviemaker who
will stop at nothing to get his
anti-war epic made just so.
Cross thinks he's God and de
lights in keeping his newly fired
fugitive in total confusion.
During his first few days on
the job. poor Lucky gets shot at.
jumped on. and pushed off of

towers, until jail almost seems
desirable. To worsen matters.
Cross doesn't fully explain to
Cameron the crazy scenes he's
in.in order to capture a realistic
reaction from his stuntman,
which usually is shock. At least
it pays well.
Throughout most of the film,
Lucky can't figure out whether
Cross is trying to help him or kill
him. This is just one of a slew of
mysteries that run rampant
throughout The Stuntman. The
theme of this movie clearly is il
lusion. For one thing, it's hard
to tell who is a good guy and who
is a bad guy until the end. Of
course it's not at all unusual for
first impressions to be mislead
ing.
Everyday life has its share of
illusion, but illusion is the
stuntman's bread-and-butter.
While by no means is the focus
of this film the life of stuntmen,
it has quite a few clever and
elaborately staged stunts. The
Stuntman's perspective is dif

ferent because you see the
stunts from the stuntman's
point of view. Thus the illusion
of the stunt is heightened; the
audience is lulled into thinking
that it is seeing "the real
thing." when as always it is not.
Going further with illusion,
the makers of The Stuntman
even dabble in some misleading
mise en scene. Through illusion
the film allows the audience to
join in on the fun that everyone
seems to be having in the movie.
This is Peter O'Toole's first
cinema work in a long while and
it is about time. It is especially
nice to see him in a role that
seems tailor-made for his tal
ents. O'Toole's melodramatic
and over-bearing mime fits
right in with the three-ring at
mosphere of The Stuntman.

Indeed this version of mov
iemaking is a tad preposterous,
but that is obvious and inten
tional. The Stuntman fully asks
the audience to take part in the
illusion by pretending. For if
this is not the way moviemaking
really is, it's more fun to think
to the contrary. If the mov
iegoer is willing to come along
for the ride, he'll find the trip
well worth the trouble.
An interesting aspect of the
film is the length of time it took
to get shown. After looking a full
year for a major distributor to
send The Stuntman out to the
local movie houses, the makers
decided to distribute the film
themselves. One of Hollywood's
more astounding illusions is
that it knows an outstanding
film when it sees one.
