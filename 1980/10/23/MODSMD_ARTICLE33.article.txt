Although this is probably a
coincidence, I prefer to think
of it as pure artistic retribu
tion: just when disco appears
to have lost its vise grip on
the masses, up pops Solid
Smoke records with a reissue
of rhythm & blues king
James Brown's legendary
1962 album, Liue at the
Apollo, Vol. I. The original
was virtually impossible to
find — believe me, I know —
and if there's any justice this
timely reappearance of the
entire unedited LP will re
store Brown's place among
the masters of popular mu
sic.
Unless you have a lot of old
R&B records, you've proba
bly wondered what the big
fuss was about James
Brown. He's routinely re
ferred to as "The Godfather
of Soul," which is misleading
since what passes for soul to
day is a long way from the in
cendiary stuff which built
Brown's reputation. But the
man's recent output has been
pretty dismal — after seeing
countless disco bands water
down his early style and ride
it to the top of the charts, he's
settled into a rut of self
parody.
After hearing this album,
now titled Live and Low-

dnum at the Apollo, Vol. I,
I'd say that's more than just
a shame — it borders on the
criminal. There is more
heart and passion in this sin
gle disc than the last five
years' worth of soul and funk
albums. Brown, "the
hardest-working man in
show business," croons,
struts and wails like a man
possessed. He's backed by
the great Famous Flames,
who contribute crack horn
charts, soulful backup vo
cals, and rhythmic grooves
so tight and propulsive I'm
surprised they all kept their
feet on the ground for a whole
set.
This LP is a celebration of
those magic moments when
artist, band, and song are
one: Brown and the Flames
segue seamlessly from
ballads to swinging funk,
throwing snatches of songs
into the bridges of others
without missing a beat. The
audience, too, becomes a
part of it all. Never has the
deep connection between
R&B and gospel been
clearer; at times this album
sounds more like a revival
meeting than a concert, as
the crowd responds sponta
neously to Brown's musical
transcendence. They are
clearly and ecstatically in
the presence of a master.
