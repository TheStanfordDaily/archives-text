# Acting like real people
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Jill Clayburgh exudes such a
sane, intelligent vibrance in her
movies that she is probably a
touchstone for more American
women moviegoers than any
other contemporary actress. In
Semi-Tough, An Unmarried
Woman, Starting Over and the
new It's My Turn, she conveys a
sense of the kind of struggle a
bright, independent, sensitive
woman has in order to stay
afloat in the world she inhabits;
she is so warm and attractive
and funny that women can iden
tify with her and men can ap
preciate her, too. She's like a
slightly spacy Jean Arthur; her
tendency to run a little off kilter
seems to us to be an appropriate
response to how crazy life is.
(Take this persona to a further
point and you have Diane
Keaton. >
In It's My Turn, Clayburgh
plays Kate Gunzinger. an in
structor in higher mathematics
who is coping with three ex
plosive areas in her personal
life: the possibility of taking a
new job that would send her to
New York, away from Homer

(Charles Grodin), the builder
she is living with in Chicago;
her father's remarriage; and
the beginnings of an affair with
Ben (Michael Douglas), a
ballplayer, whose mother — to
further complicate matters — is
her father's fiancee.
For the first time, Clayburgh
portrays a character which is
the creation of a woman,
Eleanor Bergstein, who here
makes her debut as a
screenwriter. Bergstein has
written one novel. Advancing
Paul Newman, about two wom
en who are working on the Mc-
Carthy campaign in 1968;
though it disappeared soon after
publication and hardly anyone
has spoken of it.it is. I think, a
major work — hip. funny, and
written with a new sensibility
that was forged in the crucible
of the political and sexual ac
tivity of the 19605.
Bergstein has an ear for
dialogue that might belong to an
amused Saul Bellow, and she
has transported her gifts to the
movies with the kind of ease we
like to think is always possible
for any good novelist. There are
late structural difficulties in the

film, and the rare transparent
literary device and caricature,
but these are such minor flaws
that if we carp, it's because the
script is so good that we want it
to be perfect.
Most of the characters Bergs
tein creates are so complex, and
so essentially decent, that in
stead of being manipulated into
the usual judgmental positions
movies impose on us, we are
fascinated by their quirks and
contradictions and the way they
relate to each other. Kate be
haves very differently with
Homer and Ben. because they
touch off different nerves in her
Homer is patient, supportive,
comradely; Ben is aggressive,
constantly competing with Kate
and forcing her to take stands.
The movie suggests that it's
possible for a woman to want
both.
In one scene, Kate, fresh
from the experience of Ben.
criticizes Homer for being too
laid back, too respectful of her
"space"; she complains that he
doesn't really talk to her or lis
ten to her ; and though we can
see that Kate is on one level con

verting her guilt over her in
fidelity to Homer into resent
ment of him, on another level
we can see that she's right.
Bergstein admits that life is full
of possibilities, and that almost
all the time more than one im
pulse is in operation.
The script cries out for a di
rector like Irvin Kershner or
Paul Mazursky (in his pre-(/ri
married Woman days), but in
stead It's My Turn is stuck with
Claudia Weill. I can understand
how a female director might be
a boon to this kind of project, but
Weill doesn't bring much more

to this movie than she did to her
first, the grubby, depressive
Girl Friends.
There is not one scene in
which we can understand why
she chose to place her camera
where she did; she ruins at least
one potentially great moment —
at a family dinner. Kate's father
says that he wants to dance with
"my girl." and both Kate and
her new stepmother rise — be
cause we can't see all of these
people in the same shot, and so
the humor and poignancy of the
conception are lost.
In the love scenes. Weill uses

a glossy style that puts us back
in the 19405: aided by Bill But
ler's drab photography and a
slurpy score by Patrick Wil
liams. she practically sabotages
the script.
The actors, however, are on
Bergstein's side. Clayburgh
works equallv well with Charles
Grodin. who has relaxed his usu
al sharp-edged revue comedy
style, and Michael Douglas,
whose fine character work here
indicates the progress he has
made as an actor. These three
performers, as well as Beverly
Garland and Steven Hill in the

smaller roles of Kate and Ben's
parents, complete Eleanor
Bergstein's perceptions of how
real people think and act. and il
luminate her insights.
When Ben begins to make
love to Kate for the first time,
she considers the implications
— he is married, she is involved,
their parents are engaged — and
asks him. "How many people
are in this bed'.'" How often in
American movies have lovers
spoken this kind of dialogue?
It's My Turn is a contemporary
romantic comedy in the best

Jill Clayburgh exudes such a
sane, intelligent vibrance in her
movies that she is probably a
touchstone for more American
women moviegoers than any
other contemporary actress. In
Semi-Tough, An Unmarried
Woman, Starting Over and the
new It's My Turn, she conveys a
sense of the kind of struggle a
bright, independent, sensitive
woman has in order to stay
afloat in the world she inhabits;
she is so warm and attractive
and funny that women can iden
tify with her and men can ap
preciate her, too. She's like a
slightly spacy Jean Arthur; her
tendency to run a little off kilter
seems to us to be an appropriate
response to how crazy life is.

In It's My Turn, Clayburgh
plays Kate Gunzinger. an in
structor in higher mathematics
who is coping with three ex
plosive areas in her personal
life: the possibility of taking a
new job that would send her to
New York, away from Homer

(Charles Grodin), the builder
she is living with in Chicago;
her father's remarriage; and
the beginnings of an affair with
Ben (Michael Douglas), a
ballplayer, whose mother — to
further complicate matters — is
her father's fiancee.
For the first time, Clayburgh
portrays a character which is
the creation of a woman,
Eleanor Bergstein, who here
makes her debut as a

major work — hip. funny, and
written with a new sensibility
that was forged in the crucible
of the political and sexual ac

Bergstein has an ear for
dialogue that might belong to an
amused Saul Bellow, and she
has transported her gifts to the
movies with the kind of ease we
like to think is always possible
for any good novelist. There are
late structural difficulties in the

film, and the rare transparent
literary device and caricature,
but these are such minor flaws
that if we carp, it's because the
script is so good that we want it

Most of the characters Bergs

laid back, too respectful of her
