# Rocking against oppression
## 
### Scott Waichler 
The self-centered "hopes" of racism,
sexual repression, and warmonging; these
are all D O. A. One of the most political < and
best i punk bands around, D O. A attacks op
pression that hasn t gone away. D O A. is
what becomes of the individual's ideas in
the face of the conscience-numbing labels of
the police state and the daily "choices"
forced upon us, the choices that are
evasions of human value.
D O A. is down from Vancouver with a
cold draft of unsubmissive voice to play the
Western Front, the annual underground mu
sic festival which ends this Sunday. During
a raw and demanding performance last
weekend. Joey Shithead < guitar and vocals i
spat at the crowd. "Beware of you. you re
gonna push you harder, you're just like
me. " Few fans could help but respond loud
ly to the demand, especially after seeing the
band members shaking off sweat angrily.
D.O.A.'s rawness is intelligent and con
cerned, a gut-level attack suitable for what
they see as gut-level oppression. A group
like this shows that "horrible punk vio
lence" is good enough to arouse people to
recognize the adult-world violence of in
stitutions and faceless actions.
Their words and music are uncompromis
ing; at the same time their sound is solid
rock and roll. Some would say D.O.A.'s mu
sic sounds too much like 1977 stuff —
Pistols, Clash. Well, have the objects of
those early attacks really changed their na
ture? Your choices have worsened or been
co-opted, including the original option of
New Wave. D O.A. is just a band, but they
are committed to questioning the larger at
titudes of dailv life we are all forced to ac-

cept
Still say, so what's new'' How about
"World War III"*'
Lotsa fun, lotsa fun, people gonna cry and
run/Lotsa
fun lotsa fun u ipe out citizens with a nun
(live 'em a chance they re gonna take it
Give me rules they 're gonna break it
Doesn't matter u hat fight you hoist
You really haven't got any choice
Human lives stand in the way
Run an ay to a new today
We're just caught in the middle . .
World War — ire don't need it
World War — ire iron t take it
World War —we don't irant it . .
Chuck Biscuits • drums i and Shithead
ripped up this opening number with a pound
ing and searing tension of Preparation Af
ter a three-second pause like most of those
during the set. D O.A. reported The Fne
mv."
The newsmen are lying/Drawing lines like
black
and white/Making you believe
It's your brother you gotta fight
Ya gotta know who your enemy is . . .
"Woke Up Screaming' was a self-asser
tion against police brutality. By this time
the dancing space up front was packed, and
front-row knees futilelv resisted the
leverage of the low stage and the crowd Un
fortunate! v. besides those genuinely in
cited. there were also the plastics looking
for a good shove at a gig and not caring a
wit about the music.
D O.A. 's anti-racist sentiment is summed
up in"The Great White Hope." one of their
best songs.

A uniform for every nation/Hear the
thoughts no
revelation/No minorities left
alive/Every one must
survive . . And dirty is our native way
You re gonna see the naked lie
Same lock and key on a brand new cage
Dreams only come to a sleeper
And sometimes they 're a nightmare
Next was D O A s tribute to Ayatollah
Khomeini and all the other Satans" of the
world, "Want Some Bondage." "2 + 2 in
dicted those files that have your number,
with the power to "put you under." This
band has very current concerns, you could
say.
Other very memorable songs were "Rich
Bitch," an invective against "charity
bazaar -giving Margaret Trudeau. and
"Whatcha Gonna Do." a reggae-influenced
number with deep bass i Randy Rampage)
and intricate chord work by guitarist Dave
Gregg. Last was their "hit" song, "The
Prisoner." an emphatic cry against per
vasive societal oppression.
D O.A. rocked furiously. Their technical
ability does more than sustain their in
herent anger, it allows the anger to build
and be precisely aimed. For a group like
this, the problem of getting people to wake
up never goes away. Their strength is their
ability to present political problems in a
form fans can care about.
D O A. is a radical group with no pre
tensions. If I have thrashed about with any
of your sympathies, go see this group at the
Mab this week From "Last Night":
Then they laughed saying "life's a game"
Hut tomorrow's gonna be last night again.

Human lives stand in the way
Run an ay to a new today
We're just caught in the middle . .
World War — ire don't need it
World War — ire iron t take it
World War —we don't irant it . .
Chuck Biscuits • drums i and Shithead

ing and searing tension of Preparation Af

during the set. D O.A. reported The Fne

The newsmen are lying/Drawing lines like

It's your brother you gotta fight

"Woke Up Screaming' was a self-asser
tion against police brutality. By this time
the dancing space up front was packed, and
front-row knees futilelv resisted the
leverage of the low stage and the crowd Un
fortunate! v. besides those genuinely in
cited. there were also the plastics looking
for a good shove at a gig and not caring a
wit about the music.
D O.A. 's anti-racist sentiment is summed
up in"The Great White Hope." one of their
best songs.

A uniform for every nation/Hear the
thoughts no
revelation/No minorities left
alive/Every one must
survive . . And dirty is our native way
You re gonna see the naked lie
Same lock and key on a brand new cage
Dreams only come to a sleeper
And sometimes they 're a nightmare
Next was D O A s tribute to Ayatollah
Khomeini and all the other Satans" of the
world, "Want Some Bondage." "2 + 2 in
dicted those files that have your number,
with the power to "put you under." This
band has very current concerns, you could
say.
Other very memorable songs were "Rich
Bitch," an invective against "charity
bazaar -giving Margaret Trudeau. and
"Whatcha Gonna Do." a reggae-influenced
number with deep bass i Randy Rampage)
and intricate chord work by guitarist Dave
Gregg. Last was their "hit" song, "The
Prisoner." an emphatic cry against per
vasive societal oppression.
D O.A. rocked furiously. Their technical
ability does more than sustain their in
herent anger, it allows the anger to build
and be precisely aimed. For a group like
this, the problem of getting people to wake
up never goes away. Their strength is their
ability to present political problems in a
form fans can care about.
D O A. is a radical group with no pre
tensions. If I have thrashed about with any
of your sympathies, go see this group at the
Mab this week From "Last Night":
Then they laughed saying "life's a game"
Hut tomorrow's gonna be last night again.
The self-centered "hopes" of racism,
sexual repression, and warmonging; these
are all D O. A. One of the most political < and
best i punk bands around, D O. A attacks op
pression that hasn t gone away. D O A. is
what becomes of the individual's ideas in
the face of the conscience-numbing labels of
the police state and the daily "choices"
forced upon us, the choices that are
evasions of human value.
D O A. is down from Vancouver with a
cold draft of unsubmissive voice to play the
Western Front, the annual underground mu
sic festival which ends this Sunday. During
a raw and demanding performance last
weekend. Joey Shithead < guitar and vocals i
spat at the crowd. "Beware of you. you re
gonna push you harder, you're just like
me. " Few fans could help but respond loud
ly to the demand, especially after seeing the
band members shaking off sweat angrily.
D.O.A.'s rawness is intelligent and con
cerned, a gut-level attack suitable for what
they see as gut-level oppression. A group
like this shows that "horrible punk vio
lence" is good enough to arouse people to
recognize the adult-world violence of in
stitutions and faceless actions.
Their words and music are uncompromis
ing; at the same time their sound is solid
rock and roll. Some would say D.O.A.'s mu
sic sounds too much like 1977 stuff —
Pistols, Clash. Well, have the objects of
those early attacks really changed their na
ture? Your choices have worsened or been
co-opted, including the original option of
New Wave. D O.A. is just a band, but they
are committed to questioning the larger at
titudes of dailv life we are all forced to ac-

cept
Still say, so what's new'' How about
"World War III"*'
Lotsa fun, lotsa fun, people gonna cry and
run/Lotsa
fun lotsa fun u ipe out citizens with a nun
(live 'em a chance they re gonna take it
Give me rules they 're gonna break it
Doesn't matter u hat fight you hoist
You really haven't got any choice
Human lives stand in the way
Run an ay to a new today
We're just caught in the middle . .
World War — ire don't need it
World War — ire iron t take it
