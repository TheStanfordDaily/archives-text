China signs four year grain deal
Beijing — China and the United States yesterday signed
a multi-billion-dollar agreement for huge Chinese
purchases of U .S. grain over the next four years
Under the agreement, negotiated over the last month in
the Chinese capital. Beijing agrees to purchase and Wash
ington agrees to assure supply of at least six million
metric tons of wheat and corn a year from 1981 through
1984. China is already expected to spend an estimated $2
billion for American farm products this fiscal year, in
cluding six million tons of wheat. 2 5 million tons of corn,
nearly one million tons of soybeans and two million bales
of cotton
The agreement is likely to boost wheat prices and help
make up for the grain sales lost by American farmers be
cause of the Carter administration's embargo on most
grain shipments to the Soviet Union Politicians in the
Midwest, hearing of the deal earlier through news leaks,
have disagreed over whether the publicity generated bv
the grain deal would help President Carter s re-election
prospects in the farm belt.
For Beijing, the agreement serves to guarantee grain
shipments at a time when it is straining to increase living
standards and. as a geopolitical bonus, bolsters the United
States in its embargo of grain to Moscow. Beijing's arch
enemy. The agreement, signed at the foreign trade min
istry yesterday by U.S. Ambassador Leonard Woodcock
and Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Li Qiang. also signals
the good health of Sino-American ties despite recent Chi
nese criticism of Washington's dealings with Taiwan
The Soviet grain crop for this year has also failed to
meet expectations, thus fueling further price increases.
Israeli planes bomb Palestinian base
Jerusalem — Israeli warplanes attacked a Palestinian
guerrilla training base south of Beirut yesterday, inflict
ing heavy damage, the army command said
Military officials said the Israeli aircraft bombed a ter
rorist camp at Ein Dorfil near Damur. about nine miles
south of the Lebanese capital It was the first Israeli air
attack in Lebanon since Aug. 20. when the air force
bombed a Palestinian stronghold in the Crusader castle of
Beaufort, in southern Lebanon
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin said yesterday
night the attack conformed to Israel s policy of hitting
guerrilla bases in order to prevent terrorist attacks inside
Israel, and he stressed that the policy will be continued.
"This is one of the operations the army carries out from
time to time in order to prevent the terrorists from coming
and killing Israeli citizens, and it has been proven that it is
the right way." said Begin, who is also Israel's defense
minister.
"We can't wait until they come to a place like Misgav

Am or Nahariya to kill our children and afterwards re
spond We want to prevent those murders, and this is the
way." Begin said on Radio Israel Previous Palestinian
terrorist attacks have resulted in civilian deaths in the
Misgav Am border kibbutz and the coastal town of
Nahariya.
FBI man on trial admits break-in oks
Washington — W Mark Felt, formerly the FBl's No 2
man. wept on the witness stand yesterday in acknowledg
ing that he had approved 13 secret break-ins by FBI agents
in 1972 and 1973.
"If anybody's wrong. I'm the one who should take the
responsibility." Felt told a federal court jury as tears
welled up in his eyes He mopped his flushed face with a
handkerchief, unable to continue his testimony for a few
moments
Felt, who is charged with conspiracy in the five-week
old FBI break-in trial, said he had received blanket author
ity from then acting FBI director L. Patrick Gray 111 to
use "surreptitious entries" to gather intelligence in na
tional security cases.
Gray, who is scheduled to be tried separately later, has
denied that he gave any such approval. Felt conceded that
he never told Gray about specific break-ins aimed at mem
bers of the radical Weather Underground
Felt and Edward Miller, former head of the FBl's
domestic intelligence division, are being tried jointly on
charges that they conspired to violate the civil rights of
Weatherman members and friends whose homes were se
cretly searched without a warrant.
Honda may halt proposed U.S. plant
Washington — Honda Motor Co. Ltd has warned that it
may not build its planned $200 million automobile as
sembly plant in Ohio if the U.S government imposes
quotas or tariffs to keep out imported cars.
Honda's warning was made in documents filed this week
with the International Trade Commission, which will de
cide next month whether to grant the United Auto Work
ers' and Ford Motor Co.'s requests for relief from auto im
ports during the next five years.
The UAW and Ford contend imports have flooded the
U.S. auto markets and caused the current financial and
employment problems in the industry. The relief is neces
sary to give the U.S. auto industry time and money to pro
duce its own small cars to compete with imports, they say.
Opponents of the relief measures have said import re
straints would result in higher domestic and imported car
prices and wouldn't necessarily make Detroit more pros
perous. Ford and the UAW have argued that such relief
wouldn't be necessary if the importers, particularly the
Japanese, voluntarily restrained the numbers of cars they
sell here, or built plants here that would put laid-off auto
employees to work.
Soviets predict low economic growth
Moscow — The Soviet Union yesterday officially re
duced its economic growth targets for next year to 4.1
percent, the smallest planned increase since World War 11,
because of poor harvest results and disappointing returns
in many key industrial sectors.
Warned Tuesday by Party Chief and President Leonid
Brezhnev in a closed-door session that the news would not
be up to hopes, the Soviet parliament leadership sat im
passively in the ornate Kremlin palace as the results of
1980 s efforts were revealed and the 1981 plan was adopted.
State Planning Committee chairman Nikolai Baibakov
said 1980's industrial growth will be four percent, falling
short of the planned 4.5 percent increase. And the autumn
grain harvest will be about 181 million tons, he indicated,
or 54 million tons below the 235-million-ton target for the
year The poor yield, a result of the Soviet Union's second
bad harvest in two years, all but guarantees continued
meat and milk shortages through the coming year.

London Times faces possible closure
London — The Times, Britain's oldest and best known
newspaper, will be closed next March unless it can be sold
before then, the Toronto-based Thomson Organization an
nounced yesterday.
The media and oil conglomerate has made an "ir
revocable" decision to rid itself of the Times, Sunday
Times and Times Literary Supplements because of un
relenting financial losses and labor trouble, according to
Thomson officials. Any of the publications that cannot be
sold, they said, will be closed in March.
Among the media millionaires mentioned in the past as
potential buyers of one or both of the Times newspapers
and the supplements are Australian Rupert Murdoch, who
owns publications in the United States, Britain and Aus
tralia. and Britain's Lord Matthews of Arafalgar House
and Sir James Goldsmith But only publisher Robert Max
well of Pergamon Press here said yesterday that he was
actively interested in the Times newspapers, and he added
that he would need financial and union help to buy them.
Picking up a concept first explored by Times journalists
during a labor dispute that shut the papers most of last
year, editor William Rees-Mogg said yesterday that the
newspaper's reporters, editors and managers would try to
form a consortium with outside investors to buy just the
daily Times from Thomson. He said the Times needed to
be separated from the larger circulation, weekly Sunday
Times to become financially viable again.
Sunday Times editor Harold Evans said he was confi
dent his paper would be bought by someone because it is
already profitable except for recurring labor disputes that
have regularly prevented it from printing and distributing
its full circulation each week. He agreed that the Sunday
Times' labor problems and the daily Times' money prob
lems could require separate solutions to keep them alive.
Mr. Evans. Mr. Rees-Mogg and many of their editors
and reporters said it was "inconceivable" and "un
thinkable" that either newspaper would be allowed to die.
But some publishers and industry analysts said they could
not see how the Times newspapers could ever be com
mercially viable without unprecedented management-un
ion agreement to end disputes over manning, new technol
ogy and wildcat strikes that have plagued them and Brit
ain's other national newspapers published in and around
Fleet Street in London.
Rapidly rising costs and the inability to reduce them
with the new technology and productivity improvement
now common in U.S. newspaper publishing have put near
ly half of Fleet Street's papers in precarious financial posi
tions and forced the merger, beginning next month, of Lon
don's two evening papers. The Standard and News.
Medical-business profits under fire
Washington — One of the medical world's most re
spected figures urged American doctors yesterday to
divest themselves of profit-making medical businesses
earning billions of dollars.
The American Medical Association should declare it un
ethical for a doctor to derive any income from health care
except fees for his own services, said Dr. Arnold Relman,
editor of the New England Journal of Medicine.
Doctors. Relman pointed out. have become an impor
tant part of the ownership of for-profit hospitals, nursing
homes, kidney dialysis businesses, laboratories, pain
clinics and many other health firms Perhaps a third of the
$240-billion-a-year American health care industry is in
private hands.
Both this money-making "medical-industrial complex"
and doctors' financial participation in it are growing,
Relman said, and unless doctors give it up, the public will
lose confidence in them as "honest, disinterested" repre
sentatives of their patients' best interests.
Moreover, he said, doctors will be lending themselves to
a new "vested interest" that could become the "largest,
richest and most influential" lobby affecting the nation's
laws. Already, he said, the doctor-controlled private

kidney dialysis industry "blunted the force" of a new law
that could have moved thousands of patients from private
clinics to cheaper home dialysis.
As another example of a potential conflict between a
doctor's financial interest and his patients welfare,
Relman quoted a brochure published bv Brookwood
Health Services of Birmingham. Ala., one of many corpo
rations that operates investor-owned hospitals. The firm,
said the brochure, "views each physician as a business
partner." and to this end. Relman said, it "recruits young
physicians and subsidizes their start
Cranston, Gann fight for SoCal votes
U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Ca. > said yesterday that nu
clear disarmament is the "No. 1 item on the human agen
da" and criticized Republican presidential nominee
Ronald Reagan for his opposition to SALT 11.
"Ronald Reagan says he wants major changes in SALT
and he suggests that an arms race with the USSR is the
way to get it," Cranston told a group of about 300 students
at California State Polytechnic University at Pomona.
"That to me is a very, very dangerous, dangerous no
tion."
Cranston's GOP challenger. Paul Gann, also cam
paigned in Southern California, hammering at familiar
targets — Cranston's Senate voting record and his person
al income.
Speaking to a group of senior citizens, Gann asked that if
Cranston stands "for a balanced budget, strong defense
and cutting down the size of government, how come your
voting record doesn't stand for what you're saying?"
Gann issued a statement saying Cranston had endorsed
income tax "indexing" — cutting taxes by adjusting
brackets upward for inflation — at Tuesday night's Senate
candidates' debate, but had voted against it for the last six
years.
The Republican nominee also criticized Cranston again
for drawing a pension of $35,000 per year from his former
job as state controller plus his Senate salary.
Family report avoids issues
Washington -- President Carter's White House Con
ference on Families, sidestepping the most controversial
issues, is identifying working conditions, alcohol and drug
abuse and tax discrimination against married couples as
the major problems confronting the American family.
The conference's final report, presented to the White
House yesterday, ranks ratification of the Equal Rights
Amendment as the 32nd priority. There are no recommen
dations on abortion and homosexual rights.
"We did not focus on the bizarre or extreme," said con
ference chairman Jim Guy Tucker. "We did not redefine
the family....We found broad areas of agreement which
cut across racial, religious, political and ideological
lines."
The 250-page document makes few specific recommen
dations.
It criticizes antiquated personnel policies, for instance,
but says only that they should be more family-oriented, in
cluding flexible work schedules. It makes no mention of a
proposal made at one of three regional conferences to give
men paternity leave.
Carter, who promised to hold sucn a conference when he
was a candidate for president in 1976. was campaigning for
re-election in Louisiana and Texas yesterday and not on
hand to receive the report.
Dow Jones keeps steady
New York — Transportation stocks continued to rise
yesterday but the rest of the stock market showed little
