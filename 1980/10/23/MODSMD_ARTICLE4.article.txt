# Latest Iran terms for hostages raise hopes for their release
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — Carter adminis
tration officials believe the United
States can satisfy the conditions set by
Iran for release of the 52 American
hostages — provided that Iranian au
thorities interpret these conditions
with reasonableness and a sense of
compromise.
That has been the feeling in U.S. of
ficial circles since last month when
Iran's principal leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, said the hostages
would be freed if the United States re
turned the property of the late shah,
canceled its claims against Iran, re
leased frozen Iranian assets and
promised not to interfere politically or
militarily in that country.
U.S. officials still were insisting
yesterday that they do not know
whether Khomeini's conditions, set by
him Sept. 12. are the final word on
what Iran wants, or whether the ongo
ing tug-of-war over the hostages will
lead to further Iranian demands. How
ever. a cautiously hopeful note was
added Wednesday when Iranian
Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai
was quoted as saying that the United
States now appears ready to meet the
terms stated by Khomeini.
In actuality, the Iranian conditions
are regarded as including five points.
When Khomeini made his Sept. 12
statement, he did not mention a pre
vious Iranian demand that the United
States apologize for "crimes'" it com
mitted in Iran during the rule of the
shah. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Afterward though, several Iranian
leaders said that had been an over
sight, and that the question of an
apology still applied.
That point appears to have been
covered, at least to the satisfaction of
some Iranian leaders, by the adminis
tration's reaffirmation of U.S. willing
ness to have Iran's grievances ex
amined in an international forum such
as a special United Nations com
mission Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr has said he re
gards that as satisfying the demand
concerning "America's crimes."
Similarly, senior U.S. officials led
by President Jimmy Carter and Secre
tary of State Edmund Muskie have
said repeatedly that the United States
will not intervene in Iran's affairs in
the future. Muskie put that pledge in
writing in a letter to Rajai a few weeks
ago.

As to the approximately $8 billion in
Iranian government assets that
Carter has had frozen, the president
said Monday that he would release
these assets as soon as the hostages
are free.
Most of the assets are funds being
held by American banks or their over
seas branches and subsidiaries. But
the assets also include a substantial
amount of military equipment that
could be of incalculable value to Iran
in its war against neighboring Iraq.
According to the Pentagon. Iran's
pre-revolutionary government or
dered and paid for approximately $550
million worth of U.S. military equip
ment. About $130 million of this is still
under contract with U.S. industry, and
the rest is stockpiled in warehouses
around the country.
First, the sources said. Iran would
have to specify which items it wanted,
and the United States would examine
the request and decide which items it
was willing to send.
Another problem involving the as
sets concerns claims against Iran by
American business firms and individ
uals. and that apparently is what un
derlay Khomeini's condition about
such claims.
U.S. officials say the government
probably could intervene to halt
claims against Iran by the hostages
and their families. But. the officials
add. it is much less clear that the ex
ecutive branch can intervene with the
federal courts to sanitize the Iranian
assets from corporate legal actions.
The officials say strenuous efforts

have been made to communicate that
fact to the Iranians.
The same problem applies to the
question of the shah's assets. U.S. of
ficials repeatedly have said that
Iran's only real recourse is to pursue
its claims through U.S courts, per
haps with some advice from the ex
ecutive branch While conceding that
this is "a very emotional issue'' in
Iran, the officials also said there are
some signs that "the message finally
is being heard in Tehran
Iranian Prime Minister Moham
mad Ali Rajai reportedly told a news
conference in Tehran the Carter ad
ministration seems prepared to comp

said.
A member of the Iranian parlia
mentary commission studying the
hostage issue said in the Iranian capi
tal that terms for their release proba
bly would be announced Sunday, and if
the conditions are met by the United
States "the hostages could even be re
leased the following day."the BBC re

The broadcast did not identify the
commission member, but other re

commission chairman Moussavi
Khoeini. the Moslem clergyman re
garded as spiritual leader of the young
militants holding the hostages.
U.S. officials in Washington had no
immediate comment. But the reports
from Tehran added to a growing air of
optimism about possible movement
toward resolution of the hostage im
passe.

Afterward though, several Iranian
leaders said that had been an over
sight, and that the question of an
apology still applied.
That point appears to have been
covered, at least to the satisfaction of
some Iranian leaders, by the adminis
tration's reaffirmation of U.S. willing
ness to have Iran's grievances ex
amined in an international forum such
as a special United Nations com
mission Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr has said he re
gards that as satisfying the demand
concerning "America's crimes."
Similarly, senior U.S. officials led
by President Jimmy Carter and Secre
tary of State Edmund Muskie have
said repeatedly that the United States
will not intervene in Iran's affairs in
the future. Muskie put that pledge in
writing in a letter to Rajai a few weeks
ago.

As to the approximately $8 billion in
Iranian government assets that
Carter has had frozen, the president
said Monday that he would release
these assets as soon as the hostages
are free.
Most of the assets are funds being
held by American banks or their over
seas branches and subsidiaries. But
the assets also include a substantial
amount of military equipment that
could be of incalculable value to Iran
in its war against neighboring Iraq.
According to the Pentagon. Iran's
pre-revolutionary government or
dered and paid for approximately $550
million worth of U.S. military equip
ment. About $130 million of this is still
under contract with U.S. industry, and
the rest is stockpiled in warehouses
around the country.
First, the sources said. Iran would
have to specify which items it wanted,
and the United States would examine
the request and decide which items it
was willing to send.
Another problem involving the as
sets concerns claims against Iran by
American business firms and individ
uals. and that apparently is what un
derlay Khomeini's condition about
such claims.
U.S. officials say the government
probably could intervene to halt
claims against Iran by the hostages
and their families. But. the officials
add. it is much less clear that the ex
ecutive branch can intervene with the
federal courts to sanitize the Iranian
assets from corporate legal actions.
The officials say strenuous efforts

have been made to communicate that
fact to the Iranians.
The same problem applies to the
question of the shah's assets. U.S. of
ficials repeatedly have said that
Iran's only real recourse is to pursue
its claims through U.S courts, per
haps with some advice from the ex
ecutive branch While conceding that
this is "a very emotional issue'' in
Iran, the officials also said there are
some signs that "the message finally

From the Daily wire services
Washington — Carter adminis
tration officials believe the United
States can satisfy the conditions set by
Iran for release of the 52 American
hostages — provided that Iranian au
thorities interpret these conditions
with reasonableness and a sense of
compromise.
That has been the feeling in U.S. of
ficial circles since last month when
Iran's principal leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, said the hostages
would be freed if the United States re
turned the property of the late shah,
canceled its claims against Iran, re
leased frozen Iranian assets and
promised not to interfere politically or
militarily in that country.
U.S. officials still were insisting
yesterday that they do not know
whether Khomeini's conditions, set by
him Sept. 12. are the final word on
what Iran wants, or whether the ongo
ing tug-of-war over the hostages will
lead to further Iranian demands. How
ever. a cautiously hopeful note was
added Wednesday when Iranian
Prime Minister Mohammed Ali Rajai
was quoted as saying that the United
States now appears ready to meet the
terms stated by Khomeini.
In actuality, the Iranian conditions
are regarded as including five points.
When Khomeini made his Sept. 12
statement, he did not mention a pre
vious Iranian demand that the United
States apologize for "crimes'" it com
mitted in Iran during the rule of the
shah. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
