### Karen Springen 
General optimism about Italy's po
litical future dominated the "Italy To
day' segment of A World in Crisis.
The United States Faces the 80 s"
symposium yesterday.
The symposium analyzed the cul
tural, economic and social crises af
fecting Italy.
"The country indeed gives the im
pression of a country that has turned
Leninism on its head," Sidney Tar
row, professor of political science at
Cornell, told more than 100 listeners.
He cited several parallels between
the histories of the United States and
Italy, and stressed the similarity of
America's young '60s radicals and Ita
ly's leftists.
Americans, however, see them
selves as modern They see Italians as
a people steeped in tradition, he said.
But, as Giuseppe DiPalma, pro
fessor of political science at UC-
Berkeley noted, the Italians have
some advantages. "America is a rich
country filled with poor people — Italy
is a poor country filled with rich peo
ple," he said.
DiPalma added that Italians have
shown a recent increase in wealth and
a willingness to invest in their econo
my-.
Other optimistic signs include the
current rationality in decision-mak
ing. the will of the country to grow and
solidity within the economy, he said.
According to DiPalma, the Com
munists fear a Socialist takeover. But

the Left cannot yet govern in Italy.
"Whenever a Communist party is
strong in a country, the Left can never
get' together to govern,'' said
DiPalma.
He added, however, that the tide has
turned. "Now we are back to the situ
ation of the 1960 s with the Socialists
and the Christian Democratic Party in
and Communists out."
Guiseppe Mazzotta. professor of lit
erature at Cornell, said a four-party
government was set up and apparently
welcomed by the Communists. "The
Communists did not want any type of
compromise," he said. Therefore, the
Communists are paradoxically happy
with the less leftist government.
William McCraw, professor of polit
ical science at San Jose State, also
spoke of the currrent center-left coali
tion in Italy. "On paper it is the most
potentially stable government." But,
he warned. "Governments can remain
intact by avoiding solutions to major
problems."
The speakers emphasized the un
predictability of Italian affairs.
"In Italy whatever seems irrational
occurs," said Mazzotta. "Most of our
guesses prove to be wrong."
The speakers all concurred on the
general will of all parties to eradicate
the plague of terrorism.
According to John Freccero, pro
fessor of French and Italian here, Ita
ly is undergoing a rapid mod
ernization. He said, too, that the role
of the extended family is going to in
evitably decline.
