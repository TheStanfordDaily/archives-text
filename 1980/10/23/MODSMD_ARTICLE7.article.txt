## Drought hits S. Africa; thousands die in country 
### Washington Post 
Zwelitsha, South Africa â€” The flat, fertile
fields of the Orange Free State that produce the
bulk of South Africa's wheat this year gave forth
only stunted, shriveled stalks, resulting in only
half the normal yield as this country experienced
its worst drought in 20 years.
The unusually dry and sunny skies since Febru
ary have dealt South Africa's white commercial
farming industry, which makes South Africa a
food exporter, a severe blow
This is not comforting news to its black-ruled
neighbors to the north, many of whom secretly
purchase South African food and may need to buy
more than usual because of drought in their own
countries this year.
While the South African government likes to re
mind its critics of the vital need it fills on a conti
nent where hunger is common, the drought here
has brought into focus a serious problem that
South Africa shares with its northern neighbors
despite its vast wealth widespread malnutrition
and hunger among its rural, subsistence-farming
black population. Many of these blacks have been
brought critically near to starvation by the
drought.
Black mortality rate
World Vision, a religious international aid or
ganization. estimates that each year in South
Africa 100.000 children under the age of 5 die of
malnutrition and related diseases. Most of them
are rural black children. The South African In
stitute of Race Relations computes that in the
black rural homeland of Transkei the infant mor
tality rate is 240 per 1000. against 69 for urban
blacks and 12 for whites.
About one baby in four born in the homelands
faces death during the first year, usually from
hunger or associated diseases, said Trudi Thom
as, a white pediatrician working here in the black
homeland of Ciskei
Vast disparity of wealth is a problem found in
many African countries. Here, however, it is com
pounded by the government 's policy of apartheid,
or racial segregation, that rigidly divides wealth
along racial lines and has forced about half the
country's black population of 20 million into job
less. crowded homelands' that make up only 14
percent of the country's land.
Rural malnutrition
The government increasingly recognizes the se
riousness of rural poverty that causes malnutri
tion. Last month, the government-established Bu
reau for Economic Research publicly stated for
the first time that per capita income in the home
lands is less than in all but 10 African countries.
Prime Minister Pieter Botha talks frequently

of integrating the homelands' economies with the
white-dominated economy, but so far the govern
ment has not come to grips with the problem with
any significant rural development programs.
Wheat, in which South Africa is self-sufficient,
has been the crop most severely hit by the drought
so far. diminishing the upcoming harvest to 1.5
million tons from last year's 2.2 million, accord
ing to official figures. If the drought continues
much longer. South Africa may have to curtail
next vear's wheat exports, which go to countries
such as Malawi and Lesotho, or even import
wheat, officials say.
A final decision, however, will only be made af
ter some months.
Fortunately, corn. Africa's main staple food,
has not yet been affected by the drought.
Worst drought since 1900
For South Africa's sugar industry in Natal,
"it's been the worst drought since 1900.'' said
Merlin Morgan of the South African Sugar As
sociation. Output has been cut from 2.07 million
tons in 1979 to 1.65 million tons this year. How
ever. this will not cause a shortage or affect ex
ports that go to such countries as Canada or
Japan. Morgan said.
The most devastating effects of the drought are
seen in the two black homelands of Ciskei and
Kwazulu in Natal. There, families are forced to
walk miles to rivers for water because their vil
lage wells have dried up. Fields have gone barren,
depriving villagers of food, and cattle are dying in
great numbers.
The Kwazulu national herd of 1.5 million has
lost 91.500 head since April this year, almost equal
to the loss of 97.000 in the whole year prior to
April, authorities said.
Newspaper publicity about the precarious situ
ation of these rural people means that "people are
learning for the first time about the real condi
tions iin the homelands) and they are shocked."
said Inka Mars, chairman of a private drought re
lief effort in Kwazulu headed by the Red Cross.
The drought has dramatized the situation for
them.'' Mars said.
The South African government gave more than
$9 million for drought relief to Ciskei, which used
it to provide temporary work for six months to
12.000 unemployed villagers to buy food they oth
erwise would have grown. The South African
Army has also been delivering emergency water
rations to the rural areas of Ciskei.
But when the temporary jobs run out. private
relief efforts ebb and rains end the dryness, wide
spread malnutrition will still remain, because its
roots are in the poverty and the migrant labor sys
tem on which the homelands survive.
