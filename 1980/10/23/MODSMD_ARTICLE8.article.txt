### Associated Press 
Belgrade, Yugoslavia — The West is
heading for a showdown with communist
and Third World nations over freedom of in
ternational news reporting at the 21st gen
eral conference of the U.N. Educational.
Scientific and Cultural Organization.
U.S. delegate William Harlev said Mon
day night at least two parts of the agree
ment reached in Paris in April to create ma
chinery for a new "communications order'
have been significantly altered by the UN
ESCO secretariat.
He said the proposed draft before the con
ference dropped a clause in the Paris agree
ment that said a 35-nation advisory council
to oversee the new program must operate
on the principle of consensus.
Harley said the proposed resolution also
altered the guarantee in the Paris accord
that the advisory council would "partici

pate directly" in the selection of the pro
gram director and reviews of its projects.
Instead, the resolution assigns this to the
UNESCO secretariat and Director-General
Amadou Mahtar M'Bowof Senegal, who are
spearheading the attack on Western news
organizations.
Informed sources said to counter this the
U.S. and British governments have in
troduced into the negotiations about 10 prin
ciples to safeguard free expression, oppose
censorship and promote free access by jour
nalists to sources of information.
Western nations objected to portions of
the budget calling for an international code
of ethics for journalists, some form of "in
ternational protection for journalists," and
a definition of "responsible" reporting as
news serving the greater aims of social, ec
onomic and political development.
They said in the communications portion

of UNESCO's $625 million budget for the
next three years, the organization plans to
promote concepts that would increase UN
ESCO involvement in the sensitive area of
satellite communications and muzzle re
porting considered critical to Third World
regimes.
Meanwhile, the Third-World majority at
the conference was proceeding with its an
nual attack on Israel. The Culture and Com
munications Commission voted 78-3 on Mon
day. with 28 absentions. to "vigorously con
demn" the Jewish state for proclaiming Je
rusalem its eternal capital. Passage by the
full general conference was considered a
certainty.
Israel, the United States and Canada cast
the only votes against the resolution. Eu
ropean and Latin American nations were
the abstainers, and 41 countries were
absent.
