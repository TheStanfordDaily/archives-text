# Iran style diplomacy uses new rules
## 
### Washington Post 
United Nations — It was a
bizarre tableau: Iran's prime
minister sitting back, tieless
and stubble-bearded, with his
bare foot propped up on an
elegant conference table
against the background of the
U.N. symbol on pleated,
powder-blue draperies.
As Mohammed Ali Rajai
pointed at the sole of his foot
sticking up there for the camer
as, a few scarcely repressed
snickers floated across the
faces of U.N. correspondents
more accustomed to covering
the polite world of pin-stripe
diplomacy. But for those who
chose to look more closely. Ra

jai's performance was an in
troduction to a new world — Ira
nian diplomacy — and a dramat
ic illustration of the chasm sep
arating Iran's leadership from
the American and international
establishments trying to ar
range for release of 52 Ameri
can hostages held in Iran for
nearly a year.
The chasm was particularly
evident last week as U.S. policy
makers saw in news of Rajai's
plans to visit the United Nations
an opportunity for progress in
their efforts to get the hostages
released. First President
Carter and Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie made public of
fers to meet with him. mindful
of Iran's need for military help
and the stores of already
purchased U.S. equipment
frozen in the United States be
cause of the hostages.
Expectations toned down
But then, as it became in
creasingly obvious that Rajai
had nothing of the sort in mind,
U.S. diplomats toned down ex
pectations and said their main
hope centered on the possibility
that Rajai would realize how the
hostage onus has isolated Iran
at a moment when it needs help
for its war with Iraq.
As it turned out, however, Ra
jai had left Iran for the first
time in his life, but Iran and its
radical Islamic perspective had
not left him. Without budging
from his side of the chasm, he
refused to meet any Americans
on the hostage issue, proclaim
ing that Iraq's attack on Iran

was actually part of a U.S.-led
scheme against the Iranian rev
olution. As for isolation. Rajai
declared confidently that while
Iran may encountei opposition
from established governments
and their well-tailored repre
sentatives here, the "freedom
loving peoples of the world" are
solidly behind it.
Washington logic fails
Once again, U.S. and U.N. of
ficials seemed to have made
plans on the basis of what looked
logical in Washington and New
York, while Iranians followed
their own course along the other
side of the chasm. From the day
the hostages were seized, Nov.
4, 1979, the gap has seemed just
as unbridgeable for U.S. and
U.N. diplomats accustomed to
the traditional rules for rela
tions between governments.
Time and again, it has spread to
become an uncrossable obstacle
as Iranian leaders, in particular
Avatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
acted in the light of their own,
vastly different set of rules.
In the revolutionary at
mosphere of Tehran brought for
two days last week to the United
Nations, international conven
tions for the protection of
diplomats — repeatedly cited by
the United States and other na
tions as reasons that Iran should
release its captives — appear to
mean little more than the con
ventions requiring prime min
isters addressing the U.N. Se
curity Council to shave, put on a
necktie and keep their shoes on.
So on one level, Rajai's ap

pearance was the uniform of
Tehran's lay leaders, as was the
olive drab fatigue jacket of his
unidentified constant compa
nion and adviser. On another
level, however, the attire also
was a declaration that the rules
in Washington and the United
Nations — be they sartorial or
diplomatic — do not apply to
Iran's Islamic revolution.
Iranian perspective
In the perspective of the 46-
year-old former mathematics
teacher whose Moslem fun
damentalism grew out of years
in Tehran slums, they are the
conventions of a Western, large
ly Christian tradition, precisely
the sort the late shah tried to
force-feed into Iran and that
Khomeini led his Islamic revo
lution to get rid of.
Rajai's very trip to the United
Nations after a long boycott of
its proceedings was in some re
spects an acknowledgment that
even with its revolution, Iran
has to deal with other nations.
The U.S. ambassador here,
Donald McHenry, called it a
"first step."
When the United States
thought it had come close to a
deal for release of the hostages
last March, U.S. officials were
working through Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr on the hope that, as
president, he was speaking for
the nation. But in the peculiar
world of Islamic revolution, the
only one who could really speak
for the nation was the Imam
Khomeini, and he allowed the
agreement to fall through.

Iraqi cities in strikes on missile bases, while Iraq warned of missile
attacks on Iran's cities.
United Nations — It was a
bizarre tableau: Iran's prime
minister sitting back, tieless
and stubble-bearded, with his
bare foot propped up on an
elegant conference table
against the background of the
U.N. symbol on pleated,
powder-blue draperies.
As Mohammed Ali Rajai
pointed at the sole of his foot
sticking up there for the camer
as, a few scarcely repressed
snickers floated across the
faces of U.N. correspondents
more accustomed to covering
the polite world of pin-stripe
diplomacy. But for those who
chose to look more closely. Ra

jai's performance was an in
troduction to a new world — Ira
nian diplomacy — and a dramat
ic illustration of the chasm sep
arating Iran's leadership from
the American and international
establishments trying to ar
range for release of 52 Ameri
can hostages held in Iran for
nearly a year.
The chasm was particularly
evident last week as U.S. policy
makers saw in news of Rajai's
plans to visit the United Nations
an opportunity for progress in
their efforts to get the hostages
released. First President
Carter and Secretary of State
Edmund Muskie made public of
fers to meet with him. mindful
of Iran's need for military help
and the stores of already
purchased U.S. equipment
frozen in the United States be
cause of the hostages.
Expectations toned down
But then, as it became in
creasingly obvious that Rajai
had nothing of the sort in mind,
U.S. diplomats toned down ex
pectations and said their main
hope centered on the possibility
that Rajai would realize how the
hostage onus has isolated Iran
at a moment when it needs help
for its war with Iraq.
As it turned out, however, Ra
jai had left Iran for the first
time in his life, but Iran and its
radical Islamic perspective had
not left him. Without budging
from his side of the chasm, he
refused to meet any Americans
on the hostage issue, proclaim
ing that Iraq's attack on Iran

was actually part of a U.S.-led
scheme against the Iranian rev
olution. As for isolation. Rajai
declared confidently that while
Iran may encountei opposition
from established governments
and their well-tailored repre
sentatives here, the "freedom
loving peoples of the world" are
solidly behind it.
Washington logic fails
Once again, U.S. and U.N. of
ficials seemed to have made
plans on the basis of what looked
logical in Washington and New
York, while Iranians followed
their own course along the other
side of the chasm. From the day
the hostages were seized, Nov.
4, 1979, the gap has seemed just
as unbridgeable for U.S. and
U.N. diplomats accustomed to
the traditional rules for rela
tions between governments.
Time and again, it has spread to
become an uncrossable obstacle
as Iranian leaders, in particular
Avatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
acted in the light of their own,
vastly different set of rules.
In the revolutionary at
mosphere of Tehran brought for
two days last week to the United
Nations, international conven
tions for the protection of
diplomats — repeatedly cited by
the United States and other na
tions as reasons that Iran should
release its captives — appear to
mean little more than the con
ventions requiring prime min
isters addressing the U.N. Se
curity Council to shave, put on a
necktie and keep their shoes on.
So on one level, Rajai's ap

pearance was the uniform of
Tehran's lay leaders, as was the
olive drab fatigue jacket of his
unidentified constant compa
nion and adviser. On another
level, however, the attire also
was a declaration that the rules
in Washington and the United
Nations — be they sartorial or
diplomatic — do not apply to
Iran's Islamic revolution.
Iranian perspective
In the perspective of the 46-
year-old former mathematics
teacher whose Moslem fun
damentalism grew out of years
in Tehran slums, they are the
conventions of a Western, large
ly Christian tradition, precisely
the sort the late shah tried to
force-feed into Iran and that
Khomeini led his Islamic revo
lution to get rid of.
Rajai's very trip to the United
Nations after a long boycott of
its proceedings was in some re
spects an acknowledgment that
even with its revolution, Iran
has to deal with other nations.
The U.S. ambassador here,
Donald McHenry, called it a
"first step."
When the United States
thought it had come close to a
deal for release of the hostages
last March, U.S. officials were
working through Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr on the hope that, as
president, he was speaking for
the nation. But in the peculiar
world of Islamic revolution, the
only one who could really speak
for the nation was the Imam
Khomeini, and he allowed the
agreement to fall through.
