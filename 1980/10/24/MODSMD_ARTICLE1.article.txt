# Train breaks Central Valley levee; East Bay water system threatened
## 
### 
Stockton (AP) — A railroad
embankment levee collapsed beneath
a train yesterday, unleashing water
that flooded 6300 more acres of delta
farmland The flood forced families to
flee, and threatened pipelines that
carry water for more than a million
people.
The 150-foot rupture in the 60-vear
old railroad embankment came as
workers prepared to begin pumping
floodwaters from the 5700-acre Lower
Jones Tract, which was inundated af
ter a levee break Sept. 26. That break
was sealed earlier this week
The new flooding left a total of about
12.000 acres — about 20 square miles
— of farmland under water
The 5 1 2-mile railway embankment,
which separates Lower Jones from
Upper Jones Tract, had been fortified
with 50.000 tons of rocks. But it gave
way as a Santa Fe Railway freight
train crossed about 2:15 a.m., and wa

ter flooded the San Joaquin Delta
farmland about 40 miles east of San
Francisco Bay.
Break increasing
The rupture in the embankment
widened yesterday, and officials said
work to repair it could not begin until
the water level stabilized.
There were no injuries in the rup
ture or flood.
About 25 people fled Upper Jones
Tract homes. Officials let some
farmers stay in the area to move valu
able equipment to higher ground.
An additional 40,000 acres of land
were threatened, but officials said
they were optimistic that a levee pro
tecting the land would hold.
Uncertainty
"There should be no problems,"
said Don Drake of the San Joaquin
County Office of Emergency Services.
"Of course, nothing is sure in the del
ta."

Two of the train engines and several
boxcars slipped off the tracks into the
water when the embankment col
lapsed. but the engines later were
pulled from the water
Drake said pumping would begin
"as soon as this thing stabilizes," add
ing that he expected the water level
over the 12.000 acres to reach seven to
eight feet.
The Kast Bay Municipal Utilities
District pipeline had water lapping
against it. but officials hoped it would
hold They shut off the flow of water
and said they had a six-month supply
of drinking water in reservoirs.
Vital pipeline
The pipeline brings drinking water
to 1.1 million residents of Oakland.
Berkeley and other communities on
the east side of San Francisco Bay.
The water district says it has about
six months of water in Elast Bay reser
voirs. But if the aqueduct goes, volun
tary water rationing might be re
quired. district officials said.
Drake predicted damage would be
far less than the $5 million estimated
in the lower tract flooding because
farmers had rushed through their
harvest after the original levee break
Corn, asparagus and tomatoes are
among crops grown on the tracts.
Original repair and drainage esti
mates were put at $5 million, but it
was not known how much the new
break would add to that figure.
