# Golf course off limits
## 
### Ann Pedreira 
The golf course is now off limits to joggers,
golf course officials have announced.
The new rule applies to all joggers except for
members of theAngell Field Ancients running
club, according to Ray Young, associate ath
letic director The Ancients, a group of Stan
ford alumni and faculty, meet on Monday af
ternoons to run the course when it is closed for
maintenance.
"Our preference would be that no one run on
the golf course," said Young. "However, if
people do run there, they should run as part of
this group. "
He emphasized that "there is a real danger"
to runners on the course. Although no one has
been seriously hurt so far, he said there have
been a number of close calls.
Young also stated that there were "a lot of
near fights" between joggers and golfers, be
cause of short tempers and a lack of considera
tion on both sides. Golfers often had to stop and
wait for joggers crossing fairways, leading to
unpleasant verbal confrontations, he said.
One jogger, who claimed she always looked
out for golfers, said that an angry golfer told
her to get out or he'd call the sheriff.
"I replied that I'd paid my tuition, and I had
just as much right to be there as he did." she
said.
One player explained that the main problem
seems to be that runners don't understand golf
or the dangers involved. "It puts a lot of the
burden on the golfer." he said. Once he tees off,

there's nothing a golfer can do to avoid hitting
runners who dodge into the fairway, he added.
Golfers conceded that "90 percent of the jog
gers are courteous." But one woman said that
; "some just don't seem to respect the golfers.
They'll run right in front of you."
One regular golf course runner claimed that
. he always stays to the side of the fairway when
he runs and tries to run only in the late eve
nings after most of the golfers have gone home.
n "It's nice to get off the pavement," he said,
j But. he added, during a recent cross-country
112 running event held on the course, golfers con
tinued to tee-off in the middle of a large group
. of spectators.
; Young stressed that these meets "are col
? legiate events and therefore controlled.'' The
cross country teams and some conditioning
classes are also known to run the golf course,
' but the difference is that they are under super
vision. he said.
" Not everyone is adamant in their claims to
1 the course. One jogger insisted "it's a place
} that can be shared" and said that some kind of
"happy medium" should be reached.
When asked what he thought of this idea, a
i golfer agreed that "it's a nice place to run, if
only the runners would stay to the side." An
other. however, felt that there would still be a
risk to runners of stray balls hitting them even
on the sides.
"There are 10,000 acres on campus, so we
don't encourage running on the golf course."
Young said. "After all. it is a golf course, and
not a running course." he added.
