# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Gail Stein Treat sexes evenly on draft 
### 
In this season of the Su
preme Court, a decision will be
reached on the question of wom
en and draft registration As one
who opposes draft registration
in general. I find it difficult to
accept that the Court has to
make such a decision If regis
tration is necessary however, it
should include both men and
women.
The position of women in the
world.has been improving dur
ing the past years. Although the
percentage of women in highly
paid and powerful jobs is still
small, we are beginning to
break down the barriers which
excluded us for hundreds of
years.
Teaching and nursing are still
the main fields for working
women, but there are many
young, intelligent, dedicated,
and ambitious women who will
soon make further inroads into
the male-dominated fieldsâ€”

It is only through equality in draft
registration that women can achieve
equality in all areas.

government and business
among them.
Along with our progress must
go the burdens of responsibility.
If our country must have regis
tration. then men and women
should sign up together. If a
draft is necessary, it should be
for all to serve. I feel and hope

that a peacetime draft is unnec
essary. but. if it must be in
stituted. then it should be for
everyone.
It is only through equality in
draft registration that women
can achieve true equality in all
areas A decision by the Su
preme Court in favor of regis
tration for women would have a
more powerful effect than the
seemingly stagnant movement
to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment
The ERA is very important,
but true equal rights will follow
closely begind a decision for
equal registration. ERA will be
ratified when women show
themselves willing to share the
responsibilities of society as
well as its rewards.
A few month ago I read an
opinion in the New York Times
which stated that equal regis
tration and a long, drawn-out
debate over it would onlv serve

to show the Soviet Union that we
are more concerned about so
cial issues than military ones.
This seems to be a poor ex
cuse for failing to register wom
en along with men. The writer
made it seem as though war is
imminent and that there is no
time to waste coming to a de

cision on registration. For
tunately. war is not imminent.
Social issues are a major con
cern in this country and should
not*be subordinated to military
concerns We must not allow
military hawks to control this
country. Equal registration will
not be a sign of weakness but,
rather, a sign of strength and
confidence. A policy based on
equality can only make this
country stronger.
Only by serving alongside
men can women be truly equal. I
ask the Supreme Court to allow
women the opportunity to prove
themselves to be the equals that
we know we are
