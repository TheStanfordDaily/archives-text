## Turkey's suspended democracy 
### 
Recently, the Association of
Students from Turkey at Stan
ford tried to explain the recent
military coup and its conse
quences in Turkev (Daily, Oct.
10).
This anti-democratic mili
tary intervention which was
shown by the junta as "an in
evitable take-over of the power
to safeguard the fundamental
rights and liberties of the people
until the democracy is re
stored." actually reduced the
freedom of the people in many
respects.
They overlooked the incom
patibility of democracy with the
austerity measures imposed by
the International Monetary-
Fund (IMF) in recent years,
which worked against the low
income masses in a country
where the upper 2.5 percent of
the households control 21
percent of the money and the
lower 3 percent have only about
7 percent of it.
Even more, to show their de
pendency to IMF and the
Western World, the junta did not
hesitate to carry out the eco
nomic policies of Demirel's gov
ernment. which were actually
imposed by IMF and Western
countries.
Military intervention
The recent developments in
Turkish politics can be put in a

better perspective when the
previous intevention by the mil
itary. ironically once again dur
ing bemirel's tenure, is brought
into focus. The 1971 intervention
was a reaction against the
mounting progressive trade un
ionism and petty bourgeois radi
calism which threatened the ex
isting social order of the capital
ist system.
The system was forced from
the outside to recover itself by
imposing several kinds of extra
support on the capital in order to
take the share of the low income
masses, including workers, gov
ernment officers, small pro
ducers and farmers.
Excessive freedom
The argument made at that
time was that the 1961 Constitu
tion (itself a product of a mili
tary coup i allowed for political
Ireedoms far in excess of those
warranted by Turkey's socio-ec
onomic setting.
The generals declared that
Demirel's government and the
parliament had proven them
selves to be ineffective in coping
with the "anarchy, internecine
strife, social and economic dis
content." They proposed a
strong extra-parliamentary
government to carry out social
reforms in the tradition of
Kemal Ataturk, the secular,
modernizing and nationalist

founder of the Republic.
Instead of suspending politi
cal institutions, they sought to
modify the constitution through
pressure on the parliament and
attempted to carry out policy
measures designed to combat
economic and social problems
with the help of technocratic
cabinets. A period of repres
sion, torture and political prose
cution aimed at the left fol
lowed. with severe restrictions
on the freedom of press.
Popular discontent
In economy, the monopolistic
actions taken in industry and ag
riculture and the increased de
pendency on the western world

The recent developments in Turkish politics
can be put in a better perspective when the
previous intervention by the military is
brought into focus.

while strengthening each other,
caused loss to small producers
and farmers. Increasing popu
lar discontent with the military
regime, expressed through ex
isting political and constitu
tional institutions, and mountng
pressure from liberal European
institutions brought an abrupt
end to the intervention. Elec
tions were held in October 1973.
While the economic measures
of the 1971 regime strengthened
the position of the bourgeoisie
vis a vis a growing labor move
ment. the political measures
created an environment con
ducive to the strengthening of
right-wing organizations and
diffusion of the fascist ideology.
Suspended democracy
Although the constitutinal
changes could not be carried out
to the desired degree, the in
tervention nevertheless gave
the bourgeoisie the opportunity
to observe and reap the benefits
of suspended democracy. The
capitalist class began to have in
creased influence upon the mac
ro-economic decisions taken,
solely in the direction of their
own interest.
At the time, the pension funds
of the military officers had al
ready been channeled into joint
ventures with multi-national
corporations (among them In
ternational Harvester.
Goodyear, and Renault)
furthering the links between the
armed forces and the existing
class structure.
When the chief-of-staff and
head of the 1980 junta, General
Evren (the self-proclaimed
head of the state) said, "This is
an operation to defend and pro
tect our state and nation" he
had a clear idea of what he was
speaking for.
Ruling class coup
The developments in the

economy after 1973 were not
quite sufficient in the direction
the ruling class actually ex
pected. especially after the eco
nomic policies taken during 1971
military intervention. The so
cial and political platform
which were created after 1973
made everything possible for a
military coup which would sure
ly work for the ruling class
trying to finish their incomplete
mission of the 1971 intervention.
In this aspect, the September
12. 1980 military coup is the in
tervention actually made by the
ruling class in order to keep and
enlarge their shares from the
working class. The capitalist

class now will be able to develop
itself by the tight measures
taken on the ruling class. The
capitalist class now will be able
to develop itself by the tight
meaures taken on the economy,
which can only be possible in a
military regime.
One must be more than op
timistic to expect the military
to step aside, before the ruling
class establishes its position
firmly.
