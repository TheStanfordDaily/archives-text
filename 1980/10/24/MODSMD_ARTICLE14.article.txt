## Commoner offers only progressive choice

"I'll put it to you bluntly, the
three major candidates are an
insult to the American People."
-Barry Commoner
The first ticket listed on my
sample ballot for presidential
candidates belongs to the year
long nominees of the Citizens
Party. True to their claims, the
tandem of Barry Commoner for
president and LaDonna Harris
for vice president offer a signifi
cant alternative this election.
1 first came across Barry
Commoner four years ago when
he spoke in Bishop Auditorium,
providing his sage naturalist ad
vice in clarifying the environ

mental issues of the day. The 63-
vear-old scientist, professor,
environmentalist and author
had become quite an active pub
lic speaker since making the
cover of Time Magazine in 1970.
He returns to Bishop
Auditorium this week as a feis
ty, determined, blunt and op
timistic spokesperson for a bold
platform for the future of the
U.S. As the first nominees of the
recently formed Citizen's Par
ty. Commoner and Harris have
attracted more attention than
their party.
But Commoner is quick to
point out that the party and its

stands will outlast the election.
He says. "This is not a one-shot
candidacy . . . this is the begin
ning of a new political party."
This he contrasts to John An
derson's independent campaign
which he claims "is a one-way
street to nowhere.
"No third party can begin
without wild ambitions." says
Commoner. Characteristically,
the cornerstones of his platform
are a drastic new energy plan
for the U.S.. economic de
mocracy for industry, a 50
percent cut in defense spending,
devotion to feminist and minor
ity power, and a non-interven
tionist/stronglv-humanitarian
foreign policy.
Commoner's vision of Ameri
ca's energy future is much bet
ter elucidated than that of the
Carter administration. Through
two best-selling books (The
Poverty of Pou er and The Poli
tics of Energy) he has argued for
matching the quality of energy
sources to the requirements of
specific end uses.
He writes. "The economic
crisis that is following ... is a
sign that we have failed to inte
grate efficiently the production
of energy with its use: that the
links between the auto factory
and the gasoline pump, between
the power plant and the home,
between the farm and the sun,
are loose and enormously
wasteful."
He suggests the abandonment
of nonrenewable, capital-in
tensive, centralized energy
sources, such as nuclear power
and the adoption of soft technol
ogies such as solar and wind.
Although a major critic of
President Jimmy Carter's
energy policies. Commoner is
equally frustrated with Ronald
Reagan's and Anderson's
paliatives. He said. "They
missed the boat completely.
The energy crisis is the esca
lating cost of energy. Reagan's
answer is to unleash the com
panies so they can raise the
price even more. Anderson's an
swer is to put a 50-cent tax on
gasoline."
In 1971 The New York Times
ran a book review stating, "If
there was only one book that the
next president of the United
States had time to read. The
Closing Circle should be that
book!" Commoner, the author
of The Closing Circle, would
clearly bring a strong environ
mental protection program to

the White House.
Commoner has also written
on the consequences of techno
logical growth on occupational
health standards, on the effects
of nuclear war and on the rela
tions between poverty and over
population in the developing na
tions.
He writes. "Starvation is usu
ally not caused by the insuffi
cient production of food in the
world, but by the social factors
that prevent the required dis
tribution of food."
Commoner's stand on the
arms race is similarly
progressive. He urges beginning
worldwide nuclear disarma
ment by publishing all un-

released federal documents on
the perils of nuclear war, re
questing a United Nations Con
ference on the same and then
opening disarmament talks, not
merely limitations in arms
production.
The Citizens' Party is more
firmly devoted to feminist is
sues than to minority issues.
LaDonna Harris, running for
vice president, is particularly
strong on feminist and Indian
rights. Indeed she only became
politically committed recently
in response to her supreme frus
tration with the Carter and Re
agan platforms on the same.
The Citizens' Party also strong
ly endorses gay rights.
As Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) emphasized in his cam
paign, it is the domestic and eco
nomic implications of stagfla
tion that are of paramount im
portance to the electorate ma
jority. And it is here that Com
moner's proposals are most
unique.
The Citizens' Party em
phasizes an assault on the prod
uctive instrumentalities them
selves to achieve stable prices,
low unemployment and bal
anced regional growth. Accord
ing to the platform, unions and
communities should receive
federal help to take over fac
tories and make basic invest
ment decisions.

Implications: the remantling
of energy-efficient railroad sys
tems; the refitting and opera
tion of abandoned Mid-West
steel and auto plants by local un
ions ; and the creation of a public
auto-workers corporation for
transportation to invest federal
money in converting closed auto
plants to produce cheaper, safer
and fuel-efticient cars, mass
transport equipment and
gasohol stills.
Commoner emphasizes pub
lic investment to eliminate un
employment and closing of tax
loopholes for large endow
ments.
"id rather vote for somebody
I want and not get him than

vote for somebody I don't want
and get him." â€” Eugene
Debs
The Citizens' Party campaign
has had two major obstacles.
The first is the major-party
mentality which trap c into a vi
cious circle all third-parties
striving to become serious con
tenders. The second is the com
petition of John Anderson's
highly publicized and liberal
tainted campaign. Although
Commoner and Anderson differ
sharply on economic issues,
their outward appeal to the
middle class and to students is
quite similar.
The rational for voting
Citizens' Party on November 4
necessarily becomes a
statement of purpose rather
than an attempt at election.
I regard it as utterly
fallacious, however, to contend
that any third-party vote is a
non-vote, or as the case may be.
"a vote for Reagan." Clearly
future candidates will pay heed
to the political sentiments of
those people who exercised
their power to vote but did not
support the victor.
Commoner is far-seeing in
this sense. He says,"The word
will spread. I am happy talking
to even just a handful. I'm a con
genital optimist."
