## State bows out of church affairs 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) â€” The state attorney general's decision to
withdraw suits alleging misuse of church funds is a signal to other
states that there are limits to a government's power to supervise
religion, say those who count California's decision as a victory.
"We may have to live with what a great majority of citizens
might consider bizarre religious activities, but in our opinion, that's
a lesser evil than opening the road to regulation of religious ac
tivity by the state." said William Ellis of Seattle, an executive of the
Center for Law and Religious Freedom
The Oak Park. 11l -based organization, the American Civil Liber
ties Union and a dozen other religious and civil liberties groups had
jointly opposed the attorney general in the suit he had brought
against the Worldwide Church of God. based in Pasadena.
That case is being dropped, says California Attorney General
George Deukmejian. along with two other active and eight pending
cases.
While the cases went through the courts and the churches claimed
that the attorney general's interpretation was in error, the law
changed. On January 1. a new law went into effect that clearly put
religious groups under the supervision of the attorney general.
But then state Sen. Nicholas Petris. (D-Oakland), sponsored a
bill repealing that section of the code and Gov Jerry Brown signed
it.
Deukmejian said he was bowing to legislative intent by pulling
out of the Worldwide Church of God. Faith Center and Svnanon
cases, and dropping probes of eight other churches, including Van
Nuys Baptist Church. Lincoln Avenue Church of Christ in Pasadena,
Fresno Church of the Living Word and Church of our Savior-Luther
an in Bakersfield.
It is these questions of what is a church and what isn't, and how
much bizarre behavior by religious groups can be tolerated in a so
ciety committed to religious freedom that indicate the conflict be
tween church and state is not over.
