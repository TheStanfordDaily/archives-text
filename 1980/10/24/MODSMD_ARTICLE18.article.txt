dent Jimmy Carter of continually "politicizing"
the Iranian hostage situation to benefit his cam
paign tor re-election.
I think the president of the United States, de
spite his self-righteous Balkanizations about oth
er people using that issue in a political way. has
politicized it."the Illinois congressman told an
early evening press conference here
Anderson refused to include current efforts to
seek the release of the American hostages, who
have been held almost one year, in his accusation.
But he did question the timing of these efforts,
less than two weeks before the election.
I would not want to carry the responsibility of
saying anything that would delay for one day the
release of the hostages." he said
But Anderson added that the president's use of
the hostages as an excuse to avoid debating Sen
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) in the Democratic
primaries, and his sudden return to the campaign
trail in late spring before the Ohio primaries
"without any change in the situation" raised seri
ous questions about Carter's motives.
"Sure. I think it's legitimate to say that con
stituted politicalization." said Anderson.
In another development. Anderson Wednesday
abandoned the idea of trying to purchase 30
minutes of network television time on the night of
the League of Women Voters' debate between
Carter and Ronald Reagan to respond to the two
major party candidates. Anderson has been ex
cluded from the debate.
