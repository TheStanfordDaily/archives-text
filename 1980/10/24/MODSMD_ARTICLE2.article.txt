# Hoover: Reagan's campaign think-tank
## 
### Bradley Crystal 
The Hoover institution of War. Rev
olution and Peace, considered by
many scholars the nation's most pres
tigious bastion of intellectual con
servatism. in recent months has come
to be closely associated with the can
didacy of Ronald Reagan
At least 13 Hoover fellows are cur
rently serving as Reagan consultants,
and several of them may be invited to
take high administrative posts in a
future Reagan administration should
he be elected.
Reagan, himself an honorary Hoo
ver fellow, donated his gubernatorial
papers to the Institution.
The conservative nature of Hoover
stems originally from the 1919 charter
set forth by founder and Stanford
graduate. Herbert Hoover: "The
purpose of this institution must be. by
its research and publications, to dem
onstrate the evils of the doctrines of
Karl Marx."
That objective has long since been
discarded as out of step with the
times. Today the composition of Hoo
ver includes a broad spectrum of polit
ical thinkers, from conservative econ
omist and Nobel Laureate Milton
Friedman to award-winning political
scientist Seymour Martin Lipset, an
unabashed Democrat
But the Hoover's significant liberal
contingent is more than offset by the
conservatives, many of whom are
keeping a watchful eye on the White
House.
According to a recent Los Angeles
Times article "The Hoover, one of the
nations first think tanks.' could serve
Reagan the way the Brookings Institu
tion in Washington has served Demo
cratic presidents-as a pool of talent
and a school of thought
Two Hoover fellows are currently
taking leaves of absence from the In
stitution to work full time on the Re
agan campaign
Senior Fellow Martin Anderson is
now acting as candidate Reagan's
chief domestic advisor. Anderson, a
noted advocate of welfare reform,
served as a special assistant to Presi

dent Richard Nixon. A longtime oppo
nent of the draft, he is credited with a
significant role in the establishment of
the volunteer army.
Last April in an interview with Unit
ed Press International. Anderson de
scribed the role he would like to play in
a future Reagan administration: "I
want to fly into Washington every
three or four weeks, tell them what I
think and then fly out again." he said.
But Anderson s name has frequent
ly been mentioned as an official ad
visor or perhaps chief of staff in a Re
agan administration.
In August. Darrell Trent, associate
director and senior research fellow at
Hoover, joined the Reagan campaign
as coordinator of economic and
domestic policy advisors.
Trent, who was Reagan's 197f> depu
ty campaign manager, is in charge of
soliciting advice from what he calls
"the best minds in the country."
Trent is a self-ascribed laissez faire
economist.
As a prominent consultant in the
Nixon administration, he said he
"found very few things that govern
ment can do better than business. "
The Hoover-Reagan connection is
also borne out by the appointment of
the Institution's director. W. Glenn
Campbell, as chairman of Reagan's
education policy task force. It was the
second time Reagan has appointed
Campbell to an educational post. In
1988. Reagan, as governor, appointed
Campbell to the University of Califor
nia Board of Regents.
Other Hoover domestic and eco
nomic policy experts that have been
advising Reagan include:
-Milton Friedman, senior research
fellow and perhaps the world's most
prominent spokesman on government
non-interference in the economy,
particularly with respect to the money
supply. Freidman would likely be
called upon to advise and review eco
nomic policy decisions, but he proba
bly would not take an official position
if Reagan is elected.
-Richard Burress, associate direc
