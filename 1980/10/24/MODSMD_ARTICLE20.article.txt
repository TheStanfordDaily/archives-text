# Mock debate airs issues
## 
### Sherry Norman 
The real debate between President Jimmy
Carter and Republican candidate Ronald Reagan
won't take place until next week, but American
Studies House residents heard the issues at a
mock debate Wednesday night, complete with
"candidates."' "secret service men'' and a "tele
vision' preview.
Fight residents coordinated the debate in con
junction with house theme associate John
Isibashi. The idea originated as an opportunity to
"make people more aware of how (the can
didates) stand on the issues." said Brad Crystal,
who portrayed Carter.
The Carter-Walter Mondale ticket was repre
sented by Crystal, director of the campus cam
paign for Carter, and Lisa-Marie Kraus, a Carter
supporter interested in voicing Carter's ideas in a
formal setting. Adam Newar and Andy Midler,
both of whom headed the campus organization for
the Republican presidential candidate George
Bush last vear, represented the Reagan-Bush
team.
The John Anderson independent candidacy was
not represented because the organizers felt that
Anderson was not a viable enough candidate to
lustily his inclusion and necessitate altering the
head-to-head format.
Four major news publications were repre
sented by Sarah Tung, Kenny Abrams. John
Nienow and Rich Shames. They selected eight de
bate issues for their significance in the actual
campaign and their appeal to this specific au
dience.

Both platforms were addressed concerning
their statements and policies on: the draft, the
Kqual Rights Amendment, the role of tax cuts in
their economic policy, abortion, the energy situ
ation. immigration, the decline of the United
States as a world power, and American patri
otism.
The speakers' responses were limited to three
minutes. Each presidential candidate was also al
loted a six-minute final statement in which to
summarize, rebut, or speak to any issues of signif
icance they felt were not covered.
Imaginative advertising, including a simulated
news-show earlier in the week about the debate,
probably accounted for the almost 100 percent at
tendance of residents. A dozen non-residents also
attended even though the debate was not formally
publicized throughout campus.
The interest level remained high throughout the
debate. The circulating "secret service men,"
wearing suits and ties and dark glasses, enlivened
the atmosphere.
Fred Hargadon. American Studies resident fel
low. said that the candidates gained experience in
public speaking and exploring live issues. The de
bate also served as their quarterly theme project,
one of three American Studies residence require
ments.
The participants haven't planned any future de
bates. although they felt their primary goal was
successful. This was. said Newar. "to present is
sues to people in the house so they can make a ra
tional choice November 4th "
