# Junior midfielder Willie a bona fide star
## Giucci on playing soccer in America and at Stanford 
### 
The Stanford soccer press
guide calls Willie (iiucci
"Without question one of the
finest offensive players ever to
u ear Stanford uniform " And
it's true. The junior midfielder
has been the saving grace on
Stanford's young team, 6-10-1
this season. (iiucci was the
leading scorer last year, and has
tallied 27 points so far this \ear
He mixes uncanny on-the-field
savvy with the international ex
perience named from being a
member of the national team in
his native I'ruguay
The international experience
has alsu given (liucci an air of
maturity, maybe one that can
only be had from going to school
— and starring — in a foreign
country In this Friday In
terview with Mike Oneal. (iiuc
ci discusses the trials and tribu
lations — and the satisfactions
— of play ing soccer in the land
of Monday S'ight Football, as
well as the noes of the 1980
Stanford soccer team.
Daily: Hou did you decide to
come to the I 'nited States from
I 'ruguay?
Giueci: My freshman year was
at the University of Chicago and
I came up there because I have
a very good friend who was in
the graduate program and knew
the soccer coach. That was the
only place I could go because 1
didn't know anybody else. There
was no place in Uruguay where
I could study what I'm in
terested in la combination of

history and social theory*
There were just no op
portunities So 1 decided to go
either to the United States or
Kurope I came here first and
went to a couple of practices at
Chicago and scored eight goals
in the first game The coach said
Why don't you stick around?
and gave me a scholarship That
was the only way I could go to
school here so I stayed
Dally: Why did you transfer to
Stanford'
Glucci: First of all 1 couldn't
handle the cold in Chicago Hut
then that friend 1 had there
transferred to Stanford and
called back and said it was very
nice, so I wanted to come. too.
I had to go to Foothill College
for a year because of the NCAA
rules about transfers, but 1
came here the next year
Daily: So \ ou weren Y recruited
at all by Stanford?
Giucci: No. I wasn't recruited.
Daily: What about a team like
ISF or any team with a lot of
foreign players? Hon do those
teams find their players?
Giucci: They do it illegally.
They learn about them from
friends who are players in this
country or they go to soccer
schools in. let's say. Europe and
offer the players scholarships
and a lot of other things. So they
get players.
But at Stanford it's very dif
ferent. I came here to study in
the first place. 1 could only do it
if 1 got a scholarship. I wanted to

studv. 1 was interested in Stan
ford and 1 play soccer < Head
coach Nelson i Lodge knew
about me because 1 went to
Foothill but he didn't come after
me He's very careful about that
kind of thing He doesn't want to
have any trouole with anybody.
Daily: If one was play erin a for
eign country and good enough
to accelerate in the system
there, what would be the appeal
of coming to the I 'nited States
to play soccer?
Giucci: For me. basically, my
goal is not soccer. Soccer is
something 1 enjoy as a game —
an art if you want to call it that.
Hut I'm more concerned about
academics. To play good soccer
I would have stayed in Uruguay,
but it's not the aim of my life.
Some players just want to
play soccer, though. The idea is
that life is pretty easy here.
Things are paid for and they get
a car. They just want to play and
have fun. which is under
standable too. At home you
don't get any money and you
have to work It's also a matter
of prestige. They enjoy being
the stars. But for me the reason
was that I wanted to study and
this was the only means by
which I could do it.
Daily: Do you miss playing in
i 'ruguay ?
Giucci: I ve traveled with the
Uruguayan national team many
places and played international
ly. and I miss that, but it's just a


little part of my life. I miss it the
same way I miss my family.
Daily: Do you ever run into and
problems or hostility because
you are a foreign soccer player?
Giucci: Any problems I've had
have been ironed out very well
by the athletic department, and
I'd like to thank them very
much. But in my situation it's
very different than most be
cause. first of all, I look Ameri
can. I'm not really different
from most of the team. At the
same time I adapt very well to
the group. I'm just one more
player on the team. So I don't
run into any hostility, not like
some of the players at a place
like USF.
USF played at Santa Clara not

too long ago and there were a
bunch of people outside were
shouting '' Where are your green
cards! Where are your green
cards!" A lot of other teams
look at Stanford as a bunch of
American players running after
the ball — not really a good
team. But that's not true. Stan
ford is actually a good team,
with some limitations.
Daily: What are those?
Giucci: Limitations of skills.
Limitations in understanding
theory of the game. But you
don't get those things in one day.
because you have to change hab
its. If you've been kicking the
ball wrong for two years,
there's no way that in one week
you can change it. The way we
play at Stanford, with a season

that's only two months long,
there's not a lot you can do.
Daily: I)o the players on the
team get along with Lodge?
Giucci: Some of the players
don't get along with him very
well There are some problems,
but basically it's a dual prob
lem. The players are making
some mistakes on the field, and
the coaches are making some
mistakes relating lo the
players. But that's a completely
human aspect of life.
Maybe I make the most mis
takes. Some people say I hog the
ball Mistakes are common. The
one point I want to make is that
when a team is losing, the coach
is the first to be blamed and
that's not entirely justified.

Giucci: Any problems I've had
have been ironed out very well
by the athletic department, and
I'd like to thank them very
much. But in my situation it's
very different than most be
cause. first of all, I look Ameri
can. I'm not really different
from most of the team. At the
same time I adapt very well to
the group. I'm just one more
player on the team. So I don't
run into any hostility, not like
some of the players at a place
like USF.
USF played at Santa Clara not

too long ago and there were a
bunch of people outside were
shouting '' Where are your green
cards! Where are your green
cards!" A lot of other teams
look at Stanford as a bunch of
American players running after
the ball — not really a good
team. But that's not true. Stan
ford is actually a good team,
with some limitations.
Daily: What are those?
Giucci: Limitations of skills.
Limitations in understanding
theory of the game. But you
don't get those things in one day.
because you have to change hab
its. If you've been kicking the
ball wrong for two years,
there's no way that in one week
you can change it. The way we
play at Stanford, with a season

that's only two months long,
there's not a lot you can do.
Daily: I)o the players on the
team get along with Lodge?
Giucci: Some of the players
don't get along with him very
well There are some problems,
but basically it's a dual prob
lem. The players are making
some mistakes on the field, and
the coaches are making some
mistakes relating lo the
players. But that's a completely
human aspect of life.
Maybe I make the most mis
takes. Some people say I hog the
ball Mistakes are common. The
one point I want to make is that
when a team is losing, the coach
is the first to be blamed and
that's not entirely justified.

Daily: Hou did you decide to
come to the I 'nited States from
I 'ruguay?
Giueci: My freshman year was
at the University of Chicago and
I came up there because I have
a very good friend who was in
the graduate program and knew
the soccer coach. That was the
only place I could go because 1
didn't know anybody else. There
was no place in Uruguay where
I could study what I'm in
terested in la combination of

history and social theory*
There were just no op
portunities So 1 decided to go
either to the United States or
Kurope I came here first and
went to a couple of practices at
Chicago and scored eight goals
in the first game The coach said
Why don't you stick around?
and gave me a scholarship That
was the only way I could go to
school here so I stayed
Dally: Why did you transfer to
Stanford'
Glucci: First of all 1 couldn't
handle the cold in Chicago Hut
then that friend 1 had there
transferred to Stanford and
called back and said it was very
nice, so I wanted to come. too.
I had to go to Foothill College
for a year because of the NCAA
rules about transfers, but 1
came here the next year
Daily: So \ ou weren Y recruited
at all by Stanford?
Giucci: No. I wasn't recruited.
Daily: What about a team like
ISF or any team with a lot of
foreign players? Hon do those
teams find their players?
Giucci: They do it illegally.
They learn about them from
friends who are players in this
country or they go to soccer
schools in. let's say. Europe and
offer the players scholarships
and a lot of other things. So they
get players.
But at Stanford it's very dif
ferent. I came here to study in
the first place. 1 could only do it
if 1 got a scholarship. I wanted to

studv. 1 was interested in Stan
ford and 1 play soccer < Head
coach Nelson i Lodge knew
about me because 1 went to
Foothill but he didn't come after
me He's very careful about that
kind of thing He doesn't want to
have any trouole with anybody.
Daily: If one was play erin a for
eign country and good enough
to accelerate in the system
there, what would be the appeal
of coming to the I 'nited States
to play soccer?
Giucci: For me. basically, my
goal is not soccer. Soccer is
something 1 enjoy as a game —
an art if you want to call it that.
Hut I'm more concerned about
academics. To play good soccer
I would have stayed in Uruguay,
but it's not the aim of my life.
Some players just want to
play soccer, though. The idea is
that life is pretty easy here.
Things are paid for and they get
a car. They just want to play and
have fun. which is under
standable too. At home you
don't get any money and you
have to work It's also a matter
of prestige. They enjoy being
the stars. But for me the reason
was that I wanted to study and
this was the only means by
which I could do it.
Daily: Do you miss playing in

Giucci: I ve traveled with the
Uruguayan national team many
places and played international
ly. and I miss that, but it's just a


little part of my life. I miss it the

schools in. let's say. Europe and
offer the players scholarships
and a lot of other things. So they
get players.
But at Stanford it's very dif
ferent. I came here to study in
the first place. 1 could only do it
if 1 got a scholarship. I wanted to

studv. 1 was interested in Stan
ford and 1 play soccer < Head
coach Nelson i Lodge knew
about me because 1 went to
Foothill but he didn't come after
me He's very careful about that
kind of thing He doesn't want to
have any trouole with anybody.
Daily: If one was play erin a for
eign country and good enough
to accelerate in the system
there, what would be the appeal
of coming to the I 'nited States
to play soccer?
Giucci: For me. basically, my
goal is not soccer. Soccer is
something 1 enjoy as a game —
an art if you want to call it that.
Hut I'm more concerned about
academics. To play good soccer
I would have stayed in Uruguay,
but it's not the aim of my life.
Some players just want to
play soccer, though. The idea is
that life is pretty easy here.
Things are paid for and they get
a car. They just want to play and
have fun. which is under
standable too. At home you
don't get any money and you
have to work It's also a matter
of prestige. They enjoy being
the stars. But for me the reason
was that I wanted to study and
this was the only means by
which I could do it.
Daily: Do you miss playing in
i 'ruguay ?
Giucci: I ve traveled with the
Uruguayan national team many
places and played international
ly. and I miss that, but it's just a


little part of my life. I miss it the
same way I miss my family.
Daily: Do you ever run into and
problems or hostility because
you are a foreign soccer player?
Giucci: Any problems I've had
have been ironed out very well
by the athletic department, and
I'd like to thank them very
much. But in my situation it's
very different than most be
cause. first of all, I look Ameri
can. I'm not really different
from most of the team. At the
same time I adapt very well to
the group. I'm just one more
player on the team. So I don't
run into any hostility, not like
some of the players at a place
like USF.
USF played at Santa Clara not

too long ago and there were a
bunch of people outside were
shouting '' Where are your green
cards! Where are your green
cards!" A lot of other teams
look at Stanford as a bunch of
American players running after
the ball — not really a good
team. But that's not true. Stan
ford is actually a good team,
with some limitations.
Daily: What are those?
Giucci: Limitations of skills.
Limitations in understanding
theory of the game. But you
don't get those things in one day.
because you have to change hab
its. If you've been kicking the
ball wrong for two years,
there's no way that in one week
you can change it. The way we
play at Stanford, with a season

that's only two months long,
there's not a lot you can do.
Daily: I)o the players on the
team get along with Lodge?
Giucci: Some of the players
don't get along with him very
well There are some problems,
but basically it's a dual prob
lem. The players are making
some mistakes on the field, and
the coaches are making some
mistakes relating lo the
players. But that's a completely
human aspect of life.
Maybe I make the most mis
takes. Some people say I hog the
ball Mistakes are common. The
one point I want to make is that
when a team is losing, the coach
is the first to be blamed and
that's not entirely justified.
