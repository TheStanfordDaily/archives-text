# Soccer team hosts tough rival Santa Clara
## 
### Richard Martinez 
Coming off Tuesday's 8-0
thrashing of Sacramento State.
Stanford would like nothing
more than to nurture those
sadistic tendencies against lo
cal rival Santa Clara Sunday af
ternoon
The Cards will meet the Bron
cos at Stanford Stadium — only
the third time this year the soc
cer team will play host on that
field More than 2.000 are ex
pected for the 1 p.m match, as
it will be designated Palo Alto
AYSO (American Youth Soccer
Organization i Day. Local
matches beginning at 11:30a.m.
will precede the collegiate con
test
There will be no child's play
during the featured game, how
ever. as an intense rivalry ex

ists between Stanford and Santa
Clara. The Cards have squeezed
by the Broncos two of the past
three years with 1-0 victories.
Things could be equally tight
this year, according to Card
head coach Nelson Lodge.
"Stanford and Santa Clara
have very similar programs."
Lodge said "In fact, this year I
would say that both teams are
almost equal While we hold a
good advantage as far as
strikers are concerned, they
probably enjoy a slight edge in
th iiidfield.
"They will utilize a formation
consisting of four midfielders
and two strikers up. In their 2-0
loss to Fresno State Wednesday,
they seemed to be much Detter
at building and defending than
striking." Lodge added.

Compare the two teams' re
cords and you might come away
with the wrong idea. While San
ta Clara's 8-4 record seems far
superior to Stanford's 6-10-1
slate, there is quite a difference
in the opponents the two teams
have faced. "Santa Clara has a
way of saving the tough games
for last." Lodge said. "They've
faced teams like (University of
Nevada ati Reno and Sonoma
State. I don't think anybody has
a tougher schedule on the West
Coast than we have."
Whatever the matchups, the
intense rivalry between the
squads will provide for a very
physical match. Santa Clara
will be playing a defensively
oriented game while Lodge has
some offensive surprises up his
sleeve
Lodge has worked his squad

on refinement of corner kicks,
defensing against the Broncos'
Steve Fechner. a 6-foot-4
sophomore stopper who exploits
Santa Clara's corner kicks, and
tuning up the strikers.
While the Cards would rather
play on Malonev Field, where

they are undefeated, the home
field advantage will surely
make up for the width and
length deficiencies of the Stan
ford Stadium field
Admission for Stanford stu
dents will be $1.
