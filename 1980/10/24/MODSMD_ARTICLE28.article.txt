# Stanford tries to snap losing streak
## Cards face Pac-10 enigma in Wash. State 
### Chris Haft 
When you think of the
stronger football teams in the
Pacific-10 Conference, you
know which teams to list: USC,
UCLA and Washington, and
even Stanford. Arizona State
and California. You also recog
nize that Arizona and Oregon,
though hardly spectacular, are
respectable, and you rest easy
with the knowledge that Oregon
State is pathetic.
But what about Washington
State? The Cougars defy de
scription. if only because they
seem so boring. They don't go to
bowl games. They don't place
many players on the AU-Con
ference team. They don't even
have the audacity to get sus
pended for a year. If the
Cougars were on your class list,
you would probably skip them.
The Cardinals, however, can
not afford to overlook WSU,
their host for tomorrow's 1 p.m.
game in Pullman's Martin Sta
dium. Despite last week's 27-24
loss to Washington, the Cards
still retain chances for a bowl
game invitation — Rose or oth
erwise — but a defeat tomorrow
would almost totally crush their

post-season hopes
Head coach Paul Wiggin
downplayed the bowl game im
plications of tomorrow's game.
" Whenever you start putting
bowl games into your thinking,
it just gets so complex," he said.
Yet Wiggin does realize that
the Cards have lost two con
secutive conference matches,
and he has no desire to endure a
third.
"I'm not going to get down
and beg and crawl (for a vic
tory) — that's not my style —
but this is a critical situation,"
Wiggin admitted.
Stanford is currently in the
unique position of looking up at
the Cougars. Coming off a sur
prising 38-14 rout of Arizona,
WSU (2-4-0 overall) holds a 1-1
Pac-10 record to Stanford's 1-2.
The strongest element of the
Cougars' offense, which aver
ages almost 27 points a game, is
its running attack WSU has
used the veer option to amass
207.8 yards rushing per game,
fourth best in the conference.
Stanford will have to contain
running back Tim Harris, who
collected 104 yards and three
first-half touchdowns Saturday

at Arizona The 5-foot-9, 193-
pounder has also scored six
times in 1980.
WSU, which featured Jack
Thompson, "The Throwin' Sa
moan," as its star quarterback
two years ago, boasts another
Samoan signal-caller He's
named, appropriately enough.
Samoa Samoa. "I question the
creativity of the naming proc
ess," Wiggin joked
The 6-foot-3, 203-pound senior
is nicknamed "Repeat" by his
teammates, for obvious rea
sons. The Cougars hope Samoa
can repeat his performance of
last week, when he completed 15
of 23 passes for 272 yards and
ran for two touchdowns. Over
all, Samoa ranks sixth in pass
ing and fourth in total offense
among conference leaders.
"They run the option, in my
opinion, as well as we've seen
it," Wiggin said Samoa, the
Stanford coach added, throws
"surprisingly well" off the op
tion.
Little is distinctive about
WSU's defense, though it yields
24.8 points a game, worse than

every Pac-10 team except Ore
gon State. However, the
Cougars do have a decent line
backing corps of Scott Pelluer.
Lee Blakenev and Ken Kmmil
Emill is among the conference
leaders in interceptions with
three
At least the Cougars appear
physically healthy, which is
more than can be said for Stan
ford. Two players, running back
Mike Dotterer and fullback Rob
Moore, will miss the rest of the
season.
Dotterer broke his left shoul
der in the second quarter of the
Husky game and will be inactive
until January, when he will start
preparing for baseball. A right
hander, Dotterer s injury will
not seriously affect his baseball
playing.
Moore underwent knee
surgery Wednesday morning,
and doctors found torn cartilage
and a torn tendon. The 6-foot-l,
217-pound sophomore will re
main in a cast for at least six
weeks.
Concerning those who can
play. Wiggin isn't overjoyed. He

feels that both Card units have
performed below expectations
in the past two losses
"We aren t doing what we
want to do on defense." Wiggin
says of the group that has
yielded 35 and 27 points the last
two weeks The first-year coach
holds similar feelings for his of
fense: "We haven't been happy
with the offensive output of the
last two weeks in the second half
(zero points against UCLA, 10
against Washington)."
As a result, Stanford may
make minor personnel changes
on defense. "You may see some
(John) Bergrens and (Gary)
Wimmers and the younger
group (freshmen Vaughn Wil
liams and Charles Hutchings) in
the secondary," Wiggin said
Wiggin also hinted that he
may allow quarterback John
Elwav to cut loose a few more
long passes than usual against
the apparently porous Cougar
secondary. "That's in our think
ing." he said.
Snapping their brief but cost
ly losing streak, of course, is up
permost in the Cards' thinking.
