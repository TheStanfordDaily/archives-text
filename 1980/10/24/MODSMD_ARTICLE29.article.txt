# CBS: more than 1 fight on its hands
## 
### Associated Press 
If the decision-makers at CBS
had their druthers, they would
rather: a) televise another
heavyweight championship
fight, b) air it live, and c) do it
from anywhere else in the
world.
But since this is an imperfect
world, CBS will show the heavy
weight title fight tomorrow be
tween champion Mike Weaver
and South African Gerrie
Coetzee,on a six-hour tape delay
from Bophuthatswana.
While Larry Holmes, the
World Boxing Council cham
pion, usually fights in prime
time on ABC, this is the second
time in three fights that the

World Boxing Association
championship will be shunted to
a Saturday afternoon from
southern Africa.
NBC had former WBA champ
John Tate's waltz over Coetzee
last year from Pretoria, and it
decided to handle its journal
istic obligation and moral
dilemma over the fight emanat
ing from apartheid South Africa
by giving airtime to opponents
This time it's CBS' headache.
Promoter Bob Arum de
termined his best deal was of
fered by a hotel in
Bophuthatswana. a geographi
cal entity that is recognized as
an independent state by one
countrv. South Africa.

CBS shelled out $600,000 for
the bout, peanuts when com
pared to the $2 million ABC paid
for the tape of Holmes' shutout
of Muhammad Ali. which it will
televise Oct. 31 — a 29-day de
lay. But nothing comes cheap,
considering the criticism CBS
has received.
"Seeing a white South
African. Coetzee, and a black
American. Weaver, fighting in
the artificially created 'home
land' of Bophuthatswana, in
front of what will appear to be
an integrated audience, creates
a false picture in the minds of
Americans." said one message.
Van Gordon Sauter, the new
president of CBS Sports who in

herited the fight, is in a no-win
situation. A sensitive, worldly
man, Sauter met with ACCESS
(the American Coordinating
Committee for Equality in Sport
and Society) and puffed long and
hard on his pipe. Sincere con
cern showed on his bearded
face, but he wasn't going to pull
the plug on the telecast despite
being sensitive, "personally and
professionally, to the issues you
raise."
He responded to critical let
ter-writers. calling the match
"a legitimate sporting
event...our broadcast decisions
are predicated upon the nature
of the sporting event and its in
terest to our viewers."
