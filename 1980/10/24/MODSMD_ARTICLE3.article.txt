# Reagan co-chair chides president
## Armstrong labels Carter record 'failure' 
### Karen Springen 
The co-chairperson of the Reagan-
Bush presidential campaign. Anne
Armstrong, blasted the Carter Admin
istration's foreign policy record in an
address and press conference here
yesterday.
In her speech before a gathering of
70 in the History Corner, the former
ambassador to Great Britain concen
trated primarily on defining Reagan's
stance on world issues and high
lighting Carter's deficits in this arena.
Armstrong also discussed Reagan's
opposition to the Equal Rights Amend
ment (ERA) and mentioned his stand
on abortion.
A Reagan election victory is this na
tion's "best hope" for peace,
Armstrong said. She refuted charges
that Reagan is a "war monger'' and
asserted that he would only use force
as "a last resort".
Armstrong lambasted Carter, as
serting that he "has been a major fac
tor in the disarray of the worldtoday."
"We have seen one free nation after
another go down," she said. "The
Carter record has been one of fail
ure." Armstrong said.
"The last four years have brought
civil war to our hemisphere." she
charged. Armstrong cited the pres
ence of Syrian troops in Lebanon, the
two coups and a Soviet invasion in Af
ghanistan. and the war in the Middle
East which jeopardized the flow of vi

tal oil as examples of a foreign policy
gone astray.
She blamed the ambiguity of the
Carter foreign policy for much of the
turmoil. However, she said she would
not 'suggest that President Carter is
directly responsible" for all the
world's problems.
Armstrong said American foreign
pOiVCy is unclear to world leaders.
"Their lack of understanding is a mir
ror of our own.'' she said. "Several
contradictory policies are being
pursued simultaneously." Armstrong
added
Reagan will, if elected, pursue a
clear and realistic, rather than an il
lusory. peace, she asserted.
Armstrong outlined several steps
Reagan will take toward this peace.
Hiese included reorganizing the Unit
ed States' foreign policy structure;
delegating to the Secretary of State
t he posit ton of dominant foreign policy
coordinator: encouraging a real re
duction in arms on both sides; restor
ing the quality of U.S. armed forces;
working with the other nations of the
world to stop terrorism; designing
programs to assist the under
developed world; and expanding trade
with China.
Specifically, she said Reagan be
lieves that the United States "cannot
go it alone in this world." The United
States must consult its allies before
taking a stand. Armstrong said. This
approach will facilitate "more re

spect from our allies," she added.
Armstrong also predicted a continu
ing policymaking role for former Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger.
"There is every indication that Kissin
ger s voice is being heard and will con
tinue to be heard." she said
Former President Gerald Ford is
among a host of foreign policy experts
advising the Reagan campaign, she
said.
Turning from international issues.
Armstrong asserted that Reagan will
pursue an active role in promoting
women's rights. The GOP presidential
nominee is not supporting ERA be
cause he is concerned that a constitu
tional amendment would get bogged
down in the court system, she said.
Reagan believes that a legislative ap
proach would be effective faster than

the constitutional approach,
Armstrong said
Although she disagrees with Re
agan's ERA stance. Armstrong said
the candidate'respects my right to be
tor it. She added that it is "better not
to put all our eggs in the ERA basket"
for reform.
Armstrong said she was reluctant to
discuss the abortion issue and added
that Reagan believes that abortion is
wrong. She said. "I don't see any
chance of a constitutional amendment
on this (abortion)."
The ASSU Speakers Bureau spon
sored the speech by Armstrong, who
has served on the cabinets of both Nix
on and Ford She is also a member of
the Board of Overseers for the Hoover
Institution.
