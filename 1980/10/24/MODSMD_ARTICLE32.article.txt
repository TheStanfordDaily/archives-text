## 
### Deepak Bangalore 
The Berkeley Invitational
tournament this weekend is
crucial to the fortunes of the
Stanford field hockey team,
which has been playing well
lately Seven collegiate teams
will participate in the tourney
and all of them are good, partic
ularly Long Beach State and San
Jose State. But it will be the
Cards' efforts against Arizona
today that determine their post
season future

Field hockey

This match will probably de
cide which of the two teams gets
invited to the AIAW regionals It
could not come at a better time
for the Stanford squad, which
did quite well at the Wildcats'
tournament last weekend and
hopes to do even better at
Berkeley.
The Cards. 6-5-3. open their
tournament play today against
San Jose State and Arizona
before concluding against Si
mon Fraser tomorrow Their
biggest problem may not be who
they play on the field, but the
held itself. Host Cal plays on
artificial turf, quite different
from the natural green to which
Stanford is accustomed.
However, many of the Cards

have played on the fake grass in
the off-season, so it is just a
question of getting a team
rhythm together
The Arizona Wildcats have a
very good corner combination,
particularly on artificial turf,
and the Cards will have to con
trol the game to the extent that
they shut down this potent of
fensive weapon
They did just so last weekend
in holding Arizona to a 1-1 tie.
The defense came of age in
Tucson, as that was the only
goal the Cards allowed in four
matches.
Simon Fraser plays a conven
tional style of hockey that went
out of vogue several years ago.
However, most of its players
have been exposed to a lot of
club-tvpe and off-season hock
ey, so they aren't too much be
hind the times.
Goalie Cecca Freccero and
Jeanine Valadez are instrumen
tal in keeping the Card unit
cohesive. Stanford's most effec
tive back is Andrea Welch, who
has played a vital role in stop
ping the opposing offense with
timely interceptions.
The Cards also have depth
going for them. Sixteen players
saw action last weekend and 15
will make the trip across the
bav.
