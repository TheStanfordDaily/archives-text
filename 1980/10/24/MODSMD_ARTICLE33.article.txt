# Polo, cross country host tough matches
## 
### 
Dante Dettamanti's top
ranked Stanford water polo
team hosts two of its toughest
challengers this weekend when
UCLA and UC-Irvine come to
the Farm.
In what should be the easier of
the two matches, the Cards.
19-1-1 and 2-0 in the Pacific-10
Conference, host the third
ranked Bruins today at 3 p.m.
Stanford has beaten UCLA
twice this season. 7-2 at the UC-
Irvine Invitational and 9-3 two
weeks ago in Los Angeles.
UC-Irvine. second-ranked in
the nation, lost the No. 1 spot to
Stanford last weekend 8-ti in the
finals of the Long Beach Invita
tional. The Anteaters. 17-1-1.
won their own tournament early
in the season with a 7-3 cham
pionship game win over the
Cards.
This game will be the last
time these two teams see each
other before the NCAA tour
nament. and with each team re
sponsible for the other's lone de
feat. there should be no love lost
between the two teams.

Stanford and Cal's women's
cross country teams will co-host

today's NorCal Conference
Championships at the Stanford
golf course at 4 p.m., and Cards'
head coach Laurel Troon is anx
iously awaiting it.
it's a fine opportunity for us
to compete one last time on our
home course and look at the im
provement we've made since
the beginning ot the season
Treon said. Though the Bears
are heavy favorites and are. in
fact, favored to take the na
tional title, the Cards will most
likely not be shut out. Leading
Stanford will be sophomore ace
Kim Schnurpfeil as well as El
len Lyons.
Treon hopes for a total team
effort in front of the home folks.
"We're definitely keying on
each individual. There are no in
dividuals I need to point out
each has to run her absolute
best.''
