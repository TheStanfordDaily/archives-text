On Oct 1, 1934. a Depression
weary. glamour-starved Ameri
ca awoke to tabloid headlines
sizzling with "the matter of
Vanderbilt.'' the most sensa
tional custody battle in juridical
history. Little Gloria Van
derbilt. "the poor little rich
girl." was the object of a clash
of wills between her beautiful
and internationally famous
mother, (iloria Morgan Van
derbilt. and her insuperable rich
aunt. Gertrude Vanderbilt
Whitney.
For Barbara Goldsmith, the
author of little CAoria . . . Hap
py at Last, however, it is more
than a tale of unimaginable
scandal — it is the story of
American royalty on its knees;
of a tragic, irresponsible moth
er fighting blindly for the guard
ianship of the 10-year-old daugh
ter she hardly knew.
In the opening pages of the
book, Goldsmith paints a
portrait of Gloria as an ex
quisite play toy for the rich; the
darling of the urban fairy tale
chic, whose fortunes seemed as
limitless as their supplies of
bootleg gin. So successful was
"Glorious Gloria." that before
she turned 20, she snagged Reg
gie Vanderbilt, the richest and
most eligible bachelor in New
York.
But soon, the candv-coated
fantasy for which Gloria had
been groomed began to go ran
cid. Reggie died of alcoholism,
leaving his widow penniless, but
bequeathing to his new baby,
"little Gloria." a $2.5 million
trust. Too self-involved to look
after her child. Gloria deposited
little Gloria with her sister-in
law Gertrude, and only later re
turned when the income from
the trust had begun to run dry.
Fearing that her daughter was
turning against her when little
(iloria became sullen and
abusive, her mother sought le
gal action to regain custody.
It was this trial that became
the sensational front page mate
rial of the period, and Gold

smith details the dirty linen"
aired at the trial including
cogent allegations of les
bianism. drug use and willful
negligence — charges that were
hurled at (iloria by her former
servants and most incredibly by
her own mother. Laura
Kilpatrick Morgan, who testi
fied that (iloria had tried to kill
the child in order to take control
of the trust herself. In the end. a
thoroughly beaten and humil
iated Gloria lost both the
custody of her child, and her
stipend.
Goldsmith's portrait of
Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt is
that of a frail, helpless creature,
virulently denounced and re
jected for wrongs she didn't en
tirely understand. For instance,
it was her mother who had
groomed her so carefully for a
society marrige, who had auto
matically assumed control
when little (iloria was born, who
had demanded and without
hesitation received an allow
ance each month. And amazing
ly, it was her mother who de
livered the most damaging tes
timony against Gloria during
the trial.
What is most tragic about
Gloria Vanderbilt, and likewise,
about her mother and many
women of the modern American
aristocracy, is that they poured
forth all of their energies into
"the game of society .. .
playing for higher and higher
stakes until they were con
stricted and crushed by their
own creation."
With fresh historical per
spective. Barbara Goldsmith
picks up where the tabloids of
the '30s left off. revealing the
fate for women like Gloria who
didn't play according to the
rules. Had Gloria been willing
to play the role "the most beau
tiful widow" and lived solemnly
alone with her daughter, she
may well have earned the ad
miration as well the in
heritances of her Vanderbilt in
laws. But Gloria unwittingly in
dulged herself in activities
which by today's standards
seem frivolous, and certainly
not worthy of the humiliation
she endured from Reggie's
death until her own in 1965.

Where Barbara Goldsmith's
account of "the matter of Van
derbilt" falls short, however, is
in her assessment of little
Gloria's acute fear of her moth
er. In light of the Lindbergh kid
napping. which occurred only
two years before the trial. Gold
smith argues that little Gloria
was convinced her mother
would take her away and kill
her. just as Hauptmann had
done with the Lindbergh baby.
Doubtless the fear of being
kidnapped was very real for the
child heiress, whose name ap
peared in the paper almost daily
since the beginning of the trial.
But the feeling of rejection and
alienation at having been aban
doned by her mother more satis
factorily explains the anger she
demonstrated both during and
well after the trial. Gloria
Laura Vanderbilt's cruelty to,
her mother, especially in the
last years of her life, is better
ascribed to a sadistic desire to
retaliate rather than to a na
tional hysteria that lasted only
for two or three years.
A conspicuous albeit inten
tional omission from the book is
the element of love. The author
leaves the reader questioning
whether Gloria genuinely loved
her daughter and was incapable
of expressing it. or whether her
concern was only for the trust.
Toward the last days of the
trial, Gloria appeared to be
fulfilling the role of the dis
possessed mother that the pub
lic had provided for her. wear
ing stark, black dresses and
fainting repeatedly in the
courtroom. In her effort to ap
pease her public, which deluged
her with mail and thronged out
side the courthouse. Gloria ap
peared once again to be reced
ing into the illusions that had
thrust her into prominence.
The elements of "the matter
of Vanderbilt" that fascinated
Americans during the Depres
sion-racked '30s are timeless in
their appeal. But in Little
Gloria . . . Happy at Last,
Barbara Goldsmith has gone
beyond mere sensationalism to
examine the emptiness and mis
guided energy that character
ized society during its sparkling
pre-jet set heyday.
