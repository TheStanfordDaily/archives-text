Biographical truth can bo elusive Con

strait jacket in case he should go mad. And
fairly recent research has shown that
Boswell's almost neurotic motivation for
writing Johnson's biographv may make get

problem of historical method. I guess, and a
problem which still badgers biographers to
day
The unauthorized biographer of Roman
Polanski — director of Chinatown. Rose
mars Baby and The Tenant to name a few
lit his movies — is no exception In his in
troduction. Thomas Kiernan explains that
lor a while Polanski was amicable towards
his writing the biography, then changed his
mind After some hesitation. Kiernan de
cided to go ahead with it. relying only on in
formation from Polanski's friends, ex-
Iriends. lawvers and court proceedings.
Kiernan goes on to explain, as one might ex
pect. that he intends neither a hatchet job
nor an apologia, but something of a disin
terested account Oddly enough, indifferent
sections of the book, he manages to do all
three.
The most objective, perhaps, is the map
ping out of Polanski's youth in Poland.
Kiernan relates how the young Polanski wit
nessed his mother being rounded up by the
Nazis to be taken to a camp as well as the
subsequent horrendous relationship with his

lather Polanski's uncle had it fixed so that
Polanski lived with a non-Jewish family as
one o! their children He sold newspapers to
pay for his board there though he hid much
of the money awa\ so he could go to the
(mostly German) movies. Kiernan de
scribes Polanski as a quick-minded boy and.
even though ellish in size and demeanor,
most often the leader in the neighborhood
groups
One storv which evinces this and which
Kiernan admits might be legend tells of how
Polanski contrived a method by which the
Polish Jews could deceive the Germans. In
attempts to determine whether or not a
young man they were questioning was Jew
ish the Germans had him drop his pants.

Neither a hatchet job
nor apologia

Polanski fashioned a hot wax method of
looking uncircumsized. a method which sup
posedly got others as well as himself off the
hook several times.
Kiernan's objectivity seems to turn into
apologia, however. He has detailed
Polanski's youth and childhood, including
the relationship with his father, his school
ing. several beatings from Poles and Ger
mans alike, and his first sexual experience.
Then Kiernan goes back to gather up
evidence to explain Polanski's later preoc
cupation with violence and sex. He's well
aware of his audience's familiarity with
Freudian biographical techniques, and he
plays them to the hilt. Some are convincing,
some not.

Kiernan seems, tor example, to strain
Polanski s tirst sexual experience — in
which lie anil a young girl got caught. result
ing in her admission to her father that he
was a .Jew — into being much of the cause
of his later cruelty towards women. In any
case, many of the casual explanations seem
more apologia than anything else.
Which leads to the opposite extreme, the
hatchet job which Kiernan said he wanted to
avoid In the past few years. I'olanski has
become infamous for his trial over the stat
utory rape of a 13-vear-old girl And this
plays a major role in the biography In fact,
the format of the book is set so that every
other chapter, called "interlogs," is about
the trial and events surrounding it
Most of this is extremely interesting and
carried off well. The only problem I have
with it.and why I would call it a hatchet job.
is that the prologue portrays Polanski
seducing the young girl outright, as if the
seduction were fact. He includes details
that, if Polanski indeed drugged the girl, she
could never have known I do not mean to
build an apologia for Polanski. I only sug
gest that Kiernan handled the section poor-
In this biography. Kiernan gives us much:
the fugitive childhood of a Polish Jew, the
youth of a potential actor, the appren
ticeship of a director, the Paris Bohemian,
the husband of Manson murder victim Sharon
Tate, and the object of an international con
troversy concerning sexual conduct.
One wishes, however, that there were
more about Polanski's movies. There is
some, and what there is proves truly to be
good. But one finishes wanting more. The di
rector of Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby;
The Tenant and Knife in the Water de
serves a closer discussion of his creations
than Kiernan allows him.
The Roman Polanski Story is not a book I
would read twice, but I must say I am glad I
read it once.
