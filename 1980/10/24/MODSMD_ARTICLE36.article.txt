A great musical fantasy that's

Milos Forman (<)nv Flew <tier the
Cuckoo * Nest) works in a reck
less. giddy fashion he perfectly
captures the timeless, rebellious,
rock'n'roll spirit of the 60s and
makes it live again It's a fantasy

The Hluck Stallion
New Varsity. Palo Alto
I Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Hluck Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one. Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in an alien American
society.
Plays tomorrow through Mon
day with Walkabout.
— Jim Mattson
The General
Festival Cinema. Palo Alto
Buster Keaton's silent films are
masterpieces of comic timing.
The General is a clockwork par
able of the civil war: Keaton, a
railroad engineer, saves his honor
through a stunningly orchestrated
series of calamities. Keaton's
world balances between the happy
accident and total disaster—and
it's not unusual for the two to turn
out to be the same thing. ,
Keaton's gilt is for making the
' fantastic seem ordinary. E4v com
parison. the ordinary seems
hilariously out of place.

The Last Waltz ★★★★
Old Mill. Mountain View
Unlike most rock and roll mov
ies—which have traditionally been
little more than View Master rec
reations of two-hour guitar solos—
Waltz manages a superb marriage
of the concert and the documen
tary Despite its weaknesses, this
movie stands as a potent captitula
tion of an era's end. a testimony to
the powers of music, friends, and
life on the road. Finally, it's some
of the best music you'll ever hear.
With Joni Mitchell. Neil Young,
and. of course. The Band.
Late show this weekend.

Robert Aldrich (The Dirty
Dozen) directed this clever, nasty,
bitchy thriller about two show
business sisters who grow up to
hate each other. WHTRJ takes the
unhealthy sleaziness of a movie
fan magazine and attempts to
elevate it to the status of Grand
Guignol. Bette Davis, wearing a
fright wig seemingly stolen from
Harpo Marx, and Joan Crawford,
emoting furiously, give well-stud
ied self-parodies. It's hard not to
feel embarassed for them: they're
participating in the destruction of
their own myths. There has always
been something unwholesome
about star-worship—it seems to be
tied to a desire to prove that movie
stars are human after all.
Aldrich's peculiar talent is for ren
dering this desire into something
that approaches sadism.

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
lime learning fundamental truths
about each other.

Director Hubert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton s
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is line, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Mutton's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul-its
guts.

Stardust Memories
Palo Alto Square
In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories markc a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors : the structure is as loose as
Bananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline. It's also among the
year's best films.

The Elephant Man

Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown.

The Hluck Stallion
New Varsity. Palo Alto
I Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Hluck Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one. Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in an alien American
society.
Plays tomorrow through Mon

Buster Keaton's silent films are

world balances between the happy
accident and total disaster—and
it's not unusual for the two to turn

Robert Aldrich (The Dirty

unhealthy sleaziness of a movie
fan magazine and attempts to
elevate it to the status of Grand

The Hluck Stallion
New Varsity. Palo Alto
I Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Hluck Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one. Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in an alien American
society.
Plays tomorrow through Mon

Hair ****
Sunday. Mem Aud
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip Director
Milos Forman (<)nv Flew <tier the
Cuckoo * Nest) works in a reck
less. giddy fashion he perfectly
captures the timeless, rebellious,
rock'n'roll spirit of the 60s and
makes it live again It's a fantasy
vision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might just be
the truest picture of the 60s ever
made With John Savage. Beverly
D'Angelo. and Treat Williams.

The Hluck Stallion
New Varsity. Palo Alto
I Carroll Ballard, up until now
known primarily as a promising
protege of Francis Coppola,
directed The Hluck Stallion as if
the only logic he had ever known
was a cinematic one. Incidents in
the film, which, on the strictest
narrative level, are absurd, seem
perfectly reasonable when viewed
on the film's own terms. Ballard
has lived up to his promise with a
work of striking, and strikingly
beautiful, imagery.
A boy and a horse are both ship
wrecked on a desert island; when
the child is rescued, he refuses to
leave without the animal Re
turned to civilization, both must
learn to live in an alien American
society.
Plays tomorrow through Mon
day with Walkabout.

The General
Festival Cinema. Palo Alto
Buster Keaton's silent films are
masterpieces of comic timing.
The General is a clockwork par
able of the civil war: Keaton, a
railroad engineer, saves his honor
through a stunningly orchestrated
series of calamities. Keaton's
world balances between the happy
accident and total disaster—and
it's not unusual for the two to turn
out to be the same thing. ,
Keaton's gilt is for making the
' fantastic seem ordinary. E4v com
parison. the ordinary seems
hilariously out of place.
Plavs through Wednesday.

The Last Waltz ★★★★
Old Mill. Mountain View
Unlike most rock and roll mov
ies—which have traditionally been
little more than View Master rec
reations of two-hour guitar solos—
Waltz manages a superb marriage
of the concert and the documen
tary Despite its weaknesses, this
movie stands as a potent captitula
tion of an era's end. a testimony to
the powers of music, friends, and
life on the road. Finally, it's some
of the best music you'll ever hear.
With Joni Mitchell. Neil Young,
and. of course. The Band.
Late show this weekend.

Tonight. Kresge
Robert Aldrich (The Dirty
Dozen) directed this clever, nasty,
bitchy thriller about two show
business sisters who grow up to
hate each other. WHTRJ takes the
unhealthy sleaziness of a movie
fan magazine and attempts to
elevate it to the status of Grand
Guignol. Bette Davis, wearing a
fright wig seemingly stolen from
Harpo Marx, and Joan Crawford,
emoting furiously, give well-stud
ied self-parodies. It's hard not to
feel embarassed for them: they're
participating in the destruction of
their own myths. There has always
been something unwholesome
about star-worship—it seems to be
tied to a desire to prove that movie
stars are human after all.
Aldrich's peculiar talent is for ren
dering this desire into something
that approaches sadism.

Ordinary People **
Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
lime learning fundamental truths
about each other.

Director Hubert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton s
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is line, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Mutton's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul-its
guts.

Stardust Memories
Palo Alto Square
In this examination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories markc a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors : the structure is as loose as
Bananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline. It's also among the
year's best films.

The Elephant Man
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
the "Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his grotesqueness. Not a horror
story, but a moving tale of human
love and compassion battling our
fear of the unknown.
