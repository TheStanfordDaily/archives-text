Court upholds death penalty
San Francisco The California Supreme Court cleared
the way yesterday for the resumption of capital pun
ishment in California, affirming the death penalty for a
Long Beach man convicted of murder in the fatal beatings
of two elderly widows
The milestone ruling came by a vote of 4 to 3 Last Au
gust. the justices in a tenuous 5-2 decision had upheld the
constitutionality of the death penalty. But yesterday's rul

Karl Jackson. 22. stands to become the first person ex
ecuted in California in 13 years At present 42 other men
are on death row at San Quentin. awaiting review by the
state court of their capital sentences.
Jackson was convicted last year in the beating death of
Vernita Curtis. 81. and the beating, strangulation and sex
ual assault of Gladys Ott, 90. during burglaries that oc
curred a week apart in 1977. Witnesses at his trial said that
Jackson bragged of using a wine bottle in the sexual attack
on Ott anil described the two victims as "two old bags who
were a nuisance and got what they deserved."
The court majority was formed by Justices Frank Rich
ardson. William Clark. Wiley Manuel and Frank Newman.
Chief Justice Rose Bird and Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented.
Bird's dissent was particularly outspoken. "Today,''
she wrote, "this court sends to his death an impoverished,
illiterate and possibly retarded black youth by affirming a
judgment that this court would not hesitate to reverse if
any other offense were involved."
She criticized what she called the ineptness of Jackson's
state-appointed trial lawyer, who, she said, failed to make
a thorough investigation of witnesses or the prosecution's
evidence or to inquire into the defendant's mental state.
The justices' ruling came as a surprise to some legal au
thorities. Since its August ruling upholding the death pen
alty itself, the court had struck down death sentences on
other grounds — such as inadequate representation by

counsel and improper selection ot jurors Some authorities
predicted the court would never uphold a death sentence.
McCarthy endorses Reagan
Washington \ dozen years ago, Kugene McCarthy ran
tor president against the policies that Eugene Rostow ad
vocated McCarthy was a dove on Vietnam and Rostow
was an undersecretary of state known for his hawkish line.
Now Rostow and McCarthy are bedfellows: They've
both endorsed Ronald Reagan for president
That's not the only unlikely alliance forming around Re
agan.
The (iOR nominee picked up the endorsements ot the Ku
khix Klan which he quickly disavowed — and of two
black civil rights leaders
He has been backed by two national unions and an or
ganization of local police and firemen's associations. Cus
tomarily. if organized labor can't abide the Democratic
candidate, it stays neutral.
McCarthy, a former senator from Minnesota, was a
Democratic peace candidate in the 1968 and 1972 primaries
and was an independent candidate for president in 1976
His endorsement of Reagan couldn't come at a better time
for the Republican candidate.
"Maybe this will give people some confidence I don't eat
my young," Reagan told reporters. McCarthy explained
that he has endorsed Reagan because of his stand on nucle
ar weapons, the economy, because he campaigns "with
more dignity and more restraint'" and because Reagan has
'a better concept ot what the presidency is all about."
Oil profits down: stocks plunge
Stock prices plunged yesterday as some major oil com
panies reported their profits fell for the first time in two
years.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down
15.61 to 939.51 for the largest drop since the Dow average
fell 18.17 on Sept 29. Declines outnumbered advances by a

Court upholds death penalty
San Francisco The California Supreme Court cleared

Long Beach man convicted of murder in the fatal beatings
of two elderly widows
The milestone ruling came by a vote of 4 to 3 Last Au

Jackson was convicted last year in the beating death of
Vernita Curtis. 81. and the beating, strangulation and sex

curred a week apart in 1977. Witnesses at his trial said that
Jackson bragged of using a wine bottle in the sexual attack
on Ott anil described the two victims as "two old bags who
were a nuisance and got what they deserved."
The court majority was formed by Justices Frank Rich

Chief Justice Rose Bird and Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented.
Bird's dissent was particularly outspoken. "Today,''
she wrote, "this court sends to his death an impoverished,
illiterate and possibly retarded black youth by affirming a
judgment that this court would not hesitate to reverse if
any other offense were involved."
She criticized what she called the ineptness of Jackson's
state-appointed trial lawyer, who, she said, failed to make
a thorough investigation of witnesses or the prosecution's
evidence or to inquire into the defendant's mental state.
The justices' ruling came as a surprise to some legal au
thorities. Since its August ruling upholding the death pen
alty itself, the court had struck down death sentences on
other grounds — such as inadequate representation by

counsel and improper selection ot jurors Some authorities
predicted the court would never uphold a death sentence.
McCarthy endorses Reagan

was an undersecretary of state known for his hawkish line.
Now Rostow and McCarthy are bedfellows: They've
both endorsed Ronald Reagan for president
That's not the only unlikely alliance forming around Re

The (iOR nominee picked up the endorsements ot the Ku

black civil rights leaders
He has been backed by two national unions and an or

McCarthy, a former senator from Minnesota, was a
Democratic peace candidate in the 1968 and 1972 primaries
and was an independent candidate for president in 1976
His endorsement of Reagan couldn't come at a better time
for the Republican candidate.
"Maybe this will give people some confidence I don't eat

that he has endorsed Reagan because of his stand on nucle

Court upholds death penalty
San Francisco The California Supreme Court cleared
the way yesterday for the resumption of capital pun
ishment in California, affirming the death penalty for a
Long Beach man convicted of murder in the fatal beatings
of two elderly widows
The milestone ruling came by a vote of 4 to 3 Last Au
gust. the justices in a tenuous 5-2 decision had upheld the
constitutionality of the death penalty. But yesterday's rul
ing marked the tirst time they have upheld a capital sen

As a result, unless the U S. Supreme Court intervenes.
Karl Jackson. 22. stands to become the first person ex
ecuted in California in 13 years At present 42 other men
are on death row at San Quentin. awaiting review by the
state court of their capital sentences.
Jackson was convicted last year in the beating death of
Vernita Curtis. 81. and the beating, strangulation and sex
ual assault of Gladys Ott, 90. during burglaries that oc
curred a week apart in 1977. Witnesses at his trial said that
Jackson bragged of using a wine bottle in the sexual attack
on Ott anil described the two victims as "two old bags who
were a nuisance and got what they deserved."
The court majority was formed by Justices Frank Rich
ardson. William Clark. Wiley Manuel and Frank Newman.
Chief Justice Rose Bird and Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented.
Bird's dissent was particularly outspoken. "Today,''
she wrote, "this court sends to his death an impoverished,
illiterate and possibly retarded black youth by affirming a
judgment that this court would not hesitate to reverse if
any other offense were involved."
She criticized what she called the ineptness of Jackson's
state-appointed trial lawyer, who, she said, failed to make
a thorough investigation of witnesses or the prosecution's
evidence or to inquire into the defendant's mental state.
The justices' ruling came as a surprise to some legal au
thorities. Since its August ruling upholding the death pen
alty itself, the court had struck down death sentences on
other grounds — such as inadequate representation by

counsel and improper selection ot jurors Some authorities
predicted the court would never uphold a death sentence.
McCarthy endorses Reagan
Washington \ dozen years ago, Kugene McCarthy ran
tor president against the policies that Eugene Rostow ad
vocated McCarthy was a dove on Vietnam and Rostow
was an undersecretary of state known for his hawkish line.
Now Rostow and McCarthy are bedfellows: They've
both endorsed Ronald Reagan for president
That's not the only unlikely alliance forming around Re
agan.
The (iOR nominee picked up the endorsements ot the Ku
khix Klan which he quickly disavowed — and of two
black civil rights leaders
He has been backed by two national unions and an or
ganization of local police and firemen's associations. Cus
tomarily. if organized labor can't abide the Democratic
candidate, it stays neutral.
McCarthy, a former senator from Minnesota, was a
Democratic peace candidate in the 1968 and 1972 primaries
and was an independent candidate for president in 1976
His endorsement of Reagan couldn't come at a better time
for the Republican candidate.
"Maybe this will give people some confidence I don't eat
my young," Reagan told reporters. McCarthy explained
that he has endorsed Reagan because of his stand on nucle
ar weapons, the economy, because he campaigns "with
more dignity and more restraint'" and because Reagan has
'a better concept ot what the presidency is all about."
