# 'Ultimate Frisbee' finds the Farm
## Unnamed squad to face Cal tomorrow 
### Marc Jefferson Debbie Walker 
Stanford's long-held reputation
as a sort of intellectual country
club--fostered because a student
can learn golf, tennis, or
equestrian skill for academic cred
it-receives an innovative boost
from the latest and most uniquely
Californian class offered this fall
by the Athletic Department.
No, students cannot vet get cred
it for lying in the sun or going to the
beach, but by attending a class on
the fundamentals of frisbee flying,
they can have a lot of fun and earn
one credit to boot.
The course is taught by Tom
Mcßann, one of the first frisbee
professionals and a pioneer in the
realm of competitive frisbees.
Mcßann plans to cover all the
fundamentals of frisbee playing,
including throwing, catching, ul
timate and frisbee golf.
He says that there are more than
200 ways to throw a frisbee and an
unlimited variety of ways to catch
them. A frisbee pro for the last ten
years. Mcßann preforms numer
ous frisbee stunts-he can throw the
disc over 100 yards, balance it on
his elbow, pass a spinning frisbee
between his legs, over his shoulder,

and the list goes on and on
Mcßann has also introduced his
class to Skyro. a new phenomenon
in flying discs that he has helped to
improve and flight test.
Mcßann also sponsors an ul
timate frisbee team here. A club
sport, the team has twenty-three
members, many of whom are in the
class.
Winner of district cham
pionships last year, the team is un
defeated and has a good chance of
winning a national championship.
Mcßann said.
The team has already qualified
for Western Championships to be
held in Santa Cruz on Nov. 8.
Tomorrow. Stanford meets
Berkeley at Ruble Field. The game
"floats off" at 10:00 am and will
continue into the afternoon.
Members of the team predict an
exciting game since Berkeley has
also qualified for the Western
Championships.
The teams biggest drawback at
this point seems to be their inabili
ty to decide on a name. Those pres
ently under consideration are the
Penetrators, the Snowmen and the
Quads.
