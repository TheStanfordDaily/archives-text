# High school study to include dean
## 
### Sara Tung 
Loss of public confidence, decline of
standards and the recruitment of qual
ified teachers are some of the prob
lems contributing to the troubled con
dition of America's high schools, ac
cording to J Myron Atkin. dean of the
education school
Atkin was recently named to a na
tional panel of educators and public
servants which will investigate the
problems afflicting the nation's secon
dary schools.
Sponsored by the Carnegie Founda
tion for the Advancement of Teaching,
the panel will conduct a two-year
study of American high schools.
The panel seeks to "identify in
teresting things going on at high
schools.'' explained Atkin. With a $2.5
million grant from the Atlantic Rich
field Company, the panel hopes to im
plement these programs in various
secondary schools throughout the
country.
The panel was formed at the behest
of Ernest Boyer, president of the
Carnegie Foundation, who, said Atkin.
"identified the relationship between
high schools and universities as a
critical area."
One aim of the panel is to involve
university scholars in the reform of
secondary education, said Atkin.
When asked how effective he be
lieved the panel would be, Atkin re
plied. "To change the problem we
need a basic change in public at
titude." and attributed the dis
enchantment of Americans with pub
lic education to the decline in student
achievement and in advanced course
offerings, and to reports of violence
against teachers.
Speculating on the causes of high
school troubles. Atkin mentioned the
decline in teaching quality. He ex
plained that the profession of teaching

is no longer considered a desirable
profession bv college graduates. As a
consequence, the vocation receives
fewer qualified candidates.
In addition. Atkin cited the loss of
consensus among Americans and its
negative effect on the government
More specifically. Atkin argues that
there exists a lack of general agree
ment on values accompanied by the
rise of special interest groups. Gov
ernment. in Atkins view, has become
the tool of these interest groups for the
advancement of their own causes.
Within this context, local teachers
serve only as monitors of different
pieces of legislation.
For this reason, he questions the de
sirability of imposing curricular stan
dards on a nationwide basis and favors
instead reform at the local level.
Basing his analysis of the situation
on his own observation of broad trends
in the last few years, Atkin stated,
"Things. I think, are pretty bad."
Atkin believes that a period of ex
perimentation is needed before any
large-scale reform can be im
plemented.
Atkin was hesitant about making
any predictions for the success or fail
ure of the study.
"There is a limit to what an institu
tion can do because it sits in this politi
cal-economic context."
He noted the tension which exists
between preserving the ties between
community and high school. With re
spect to his own role on the panel.
Atkin expressed his intention to stress
the relationship between the com
munity and the high school, but added.
"I believe there is a direct rela
tionship between the sense of national
purpose and the quality of high school
I am inclined to emphasize what we
have in common and not what sepa
rates us."
