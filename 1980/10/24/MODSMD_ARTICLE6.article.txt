## 'Shunned nations' form trade, military alliance 
### Los Angeles Tunes 
Johannesburg. South Africa — Israel. Taiwan
and South Africa have formed an informal "al
liance of shunned nations" in an attempt to fend
♦•ff further political isolation in the world
Top-level South African officials say they be
lieve the growing degree of cooperation among
the three nations is likely to expand into a for
midable political and economic association
Many Western observers agree that the steady
increase in South Africa's trade with Israel and
Taiwan benefits the economies of all three coun
tries. And. although Israel and Taiwan are among
the smaller countries of the world, their people
possess technical skills that complement those of
South Africa.
The three countries are in relative political
isolation for widelv varying reasons South Africa
for its racial apartheid policy. Taiwan because
most countries now recognize the People's Re
public of China on the mainland. Israel because it
is opposed by Arab nations and their Moslem al
lies.
To cement a growing friendship. South African
I'rime Minister Pieter Botha made a state visit to
Taiwan last week, and Taiwan Prime Minister
Sun Yun-hsuan made a similar visit to South
Africa six months ago.
Taiwan recognized
Friendship — including diplomatic recognition
of Taiwan by South Africa — means much to the
Taiwanese, for there are now only 22 countries in
the world that have not severed official relations
with Taiwan in favor of formal ties with the Peo
ple s Republic.
When Taiwanese visit South Africa, an under
standing has been reached that they — like
Japanese visitors — will be considered "white"
and so avoid entanglement in South Africa's sepa
ration -of races policies.
South Africa's own 8000 ethnic Chinese are also
expected to benefit bv the warming relationship
between Pretoria and Taipei. At present. Chinese
are in limbo in this country's race structure, being
exempt from discrimination — unless their pres
ence in a white area, for either residential or busi
ness purposes incites the displeasure of a white,
who can protest to authorities and have them re
moved.
Arms sales
The Taiwan-Israel connection is difficult to
trace, but Taiwan's navy is equipped with Israeli
made (iabriel ship-to ship missiles and its air
force with Israeli-made Shafrir air-to-air mis
siles. Israeli officials will not comment on such
sales, but there have been published reports that
they might have been made through a third party
— perhaps Singapore

Israeli officials are extremely reticent to dis
cuss any relations with Taiwan, for Israel is court
ing China these days
Israel was one of the first nations to recognize
the People's Republic ot China in 1949. soon after
the Communist regime took control of the Chinese
mainland However. China never offered Isreal
recognition in return, and now Israel has
diplomatic relations with neither China nor
Taiwan
Cooperation among the three shunned nations
took time to develop to its present level. For a
time. Israel and Taiwan joined the United Na
tions' condemnation of South Africa for its legal
ized racial discrimination bv the minority white
government against its black. Indian and mixed
race people.
Institutionalized policy
This policy began to be institutionalized after
an ultra-conservative government came to power
here in 194K That political party is still in power,
now headed by Botha, but he is attempting to mod
erate some features of discrimination.
Taiwan warmed up to South Africa after
Taiwan was ousted from the United Nations and
displaced internationally by the People's Re
of China in 1971 It expanded its ties with South
Africa after the United States' switch of
diplomatic relations to the People's Republic on
Jan. 1. 1979
Israel's relationship with South Africa de
veloped more slowly. Until 1973. it cultivated
diplomatically the new black states of Africa,
seeking to gain benefit from such friendship in the
Third World to partially offset the deep hostility
of its Arab neighbors But the Israeli victory in the
Yom Kippur War of 1973 changed the picture.
Ties broken with Israel
Of the 33 black African states with which Israel
had relations. 29 broke the ties, motivated by
Moslem solidarity, political pressure, and the
promise of sizable financial aid from the oil-rich
Arab states.
South Africa, on the other hand, sent a message
of support to Israel after the 1973 war. This was
the start of full diplomatic relations between the
two countries, and ambassadors were exchanged
in 1974. John Vorster. prime minister here before
Botha, made one of his rare trips overseas to visit
Israel in 1978 and was well received.
Since then, there have been numerous joint
commercial ventures, and airline and shipping
links have been established.
Israel receives South African uranium and pro
vides nuclear power development assistance in
return Also. Israel's major export earner, mar
ketable diamonds, are mostly imported as uncut
stones from South Africa.
