### LOs Angeles Times 
New Delhi — Looking relaxed and in the
peak of health. India's Prime Minister In
dira Gandhi went on the political attack [or
!h«* first time in months Tuesday, deftly re
butting charges that she heads a do-nothing
government that has failed to tackle the
country's growing economic and social ills.
"Today the direction is clear." she con
fidently told a packed press conference.
"The administration is recovering fast
from the coma into which it had settled dur
ing the Janata and Lok Dal governments."
She also had unkind words for the Carter
administration, accusing it of an anti-India
bias that began during Richard Nixon's
presidency, and saying that the United
States bad consistently rejected India s
friendship in recent years.
But it was the vitality and enthusiasm
liandhi displayed during the hour-and-20-
ininute press conference, more than what
she said, that were newsworthv.
For the 62-vear-old prime minister's per

formance signalled that she had finally
emerged from the shock and depression that
followed the death of her son and closest po
litical confidant. Sanjav. June 23.
Alter Sanjav's death the government
came to a virtual standstill and concern
grew about Gandhi's will to continue as
prime minister. As criticism of her inactivi
ty mounted, rumors swept the capital that
she was seriously ill.
It was believed that her decision to face
the press formally for the first time since
her re-election last January was in part to
dispel those fears.
In the past two weeks Gandhi resumed
travelling, visiting India's three largest
cities of Bombay. Calcutta and Madras.
While political observers cited Gandhi's
press conference performance as the
clearest sign vet that she has regained much
of her vigor, they differed with her conten
tion that her government was coming to
grips with India's major economic and so

cial ills.
"She's doing things again, but there is a
difference between activity and per
formance." commented one diplomat here.
Although Gandhi contended Tuesday that
her government had achieved a slight im
provement in the law-and-order and infla
tion situations, political observers noted
that she had solved none of the major prob
lems that faced her when she returned to
power almost 10 months ago.
