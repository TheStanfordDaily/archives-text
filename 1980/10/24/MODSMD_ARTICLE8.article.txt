# Many countries continue sales; imports up
## Grain embargo ineffective in USSR 
### Washington Post 
Paris — The Soviet Union im
ported twice as much grain this
year as last, despite the em
bargo imposed at President
Jimmy Carter's request in Jan
uary by the Western allies, ac
cording to confidential reports
prepared by the Executive Com
mission of the nine-nation Eu
ropean Community.
The extra grain came from
Canada. Australia. Argentina
and the United States itself.
Community sources with access
to the reports said
The report makes the Com
munity. which was the only ma
jor Western grain exporter to
respect the embargo, now look
"ridiculous." the sources said
Sentiment among the member
states' nine ambassadors to
Community headquarters in
Brussels is against continuing
the embargo, but nothing is like-

Iv to be done until after the U.S.
presidential elections, accord
ing to a knowledgeable source.
French influence
France, which produces two
thirds of the Community's grain
and is the only member-state
with surpluses for export, was
the prime mover in underlining
the ineffectiveness of the grain
embargo.
French officials said that the
Community reports on the situ
ation were the direct result of
French insistence that the Ex
ecutive Commission carry out
the mandate it received when
the embargo went into effect in
early .January to monitor the ac
tivities of other grain exporters.
In response to that pressure, the
Commission delivered a report
to the nine ambassadors in
Brussels last Thursday and was
scheduled to give a written fol
low-up report at the next weekly
meeting yesterday. Community
sources said.
Statistics collected by the
Community show that the Soviet
Union imported a total of 28.2
million metric tons of wheat and
other grain cereals during the
1979-1980 export season, com
pared to 14.9 million tons the
previous year.
U.S. exports totalled 15.3 mil
lion metric tons, compared to
11.2 million tons in 1978-1979.
Canada went from 2.1 million
tons last year to 3.5 million tons
this year. Australia from 0.1
million tons to 3.9 million, and
Argentina from 1.4 million to
5.5,
Community sources say they
do not reproach Argentina,
which never engaged in the "hy
pocrisy" of saying it would re
spect the embargo. But the
sources condemn Canada and
Australia for simply violating
the export ban. As for the United
States, some sources backed off
their previous harsh criticisms

when they were confronted with
the U.S. official explanations of
the statistics.
U.S. sources noted that the
Soviet-American five-year con
tract provides for 8 million tons
a year during a relatively arbi
trarily defined "agreement
year" that runs from October of
one year through September of
the, next. Carter had pledged
that Washington would honor
that contractual commitment
but would not deliver any extra
amounts.
Agriculture Department
sources say that a final total of
15.3 million tons for the year can
be reached by the Europeans by
ignoring the peculiar calendar
of the Soviet-American grain
agreement and figuring the year
a different way. When that is
done, the U.S. sources said. 6
million tons that were nego
tiated earlier this year but could
not be delivered until after this
Oct. 1 and 1.3 million tons added
in from last year did indeed
make a grand total of 15.3 mil
lion tons.
French follow US lead
Nevertheless. French of
ficials take the view that "if the
United States is not respecting
the embargo, there is no reason
for us to do it." France and the
rest of the Community went
beyond Carter's demands by
also applying an embargo on
"transformed grain" in the
form of meat and butter, the of
ficials said. "So we don't want
Thatcher coining to tell us now
that we are going to distress the
Americans by selling a little
butter to the Soviets.'" said a
Community source, referring to
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's desire to
continue to strictly enforce the
embargo.
The United States continued
to sell the Soviet Union

"massive" quantities of soja
beans as livestock teed, said a
Community source who con
ceded that this sale was no vio
lation of the letter of the em
bargo but did contradict its spir
it.
The embargo turned out to be
"a bad joke.' said a French of
ficial. "The Europeans were the
only ones who respected it.'
France had a very good grain
harvest this year, and is ex
pected to sell its usual ti to 8 mil
lion tons to the other, grain
short members of the Com
munity. Hut French granaries
will still overflow, and French
agricultural officials say that
the country must sell 3 million
more tons of the current harvest
outside the Community.
A Brussels official noted that
France could sell its surplus to
China, which is in the market
for 7 million tons of grain. But,
he noted. France and the Com
munity would have to absorb the
heavy costs of shipping it that
far. "It makes much more sense
to sell it to the Russians, he
said
Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev indicated Tuesday
that this vear's Soviet harvest
was more than 30 million tons
short of the country's needs.
From the start. France has
said that it did not think eco
nomic sanctions against the So
viet Union were wise or helpful.
But the French government had
raised so many other objections
to measures Carter sought, such
as the boycott of the Olympic
Games, that Paris apparently
decided to mollify the United
States by pledging not to take
advantage of any slack created
by American application of eco
nomic sanctions. The French
maintain they strictly adhered
to this policy.

Paris — The Soviet Union im
ported twice as much grain this
year as last, despite the em
bargo imposed at President
Jimmy Carter's request in Jan
uary by the Western allies, ac
cording to confidential reports
prepared by the Executive Com
mission of the nine-nation Eu
ropean Community.
The extra grain came from
Canada. Australia. Argentina
and the United States itself.
Community sources with access
to the reports said
The report makes the Com
munity. which was the only ma
jor Western grain exporter to
respect the embargo, now look
"ridiculous." the sources said
Sentiment among the member
states' nine ambassadors to
Community headquarters in
Brussels is against continuing
the embargo, but nothing is like-

Iv to be done until after the U.S.
presidential elections, accord
ing to a knowledgeable source.
French influence
France, which produces two
thirds of the Community's grain
and is the only member-state
with surpluses for export, was
the prime mover in underlining
the ineffectiveness of the grain
embargo.
French officials said that the
Community reports on the situ
ation were the direct result of
French insistence that the Ex
ecutive Commission carry out
the mandate it received when
the embargo went into effect in
early .January to monitor the ac
tivities of other grain exporters.
In response to that pressure, the
Commission delivered a report
to the nine ambassadors in
Brussels last Thursday and was
scheduled to give a written fol
low-up report at the next weekly
meeting yesterday. Community
sources said.
Statistics collected by the
Community show that the Soviet
Union imported a total of 28.2
million metric tons of wheat and
other grain cereals during the
1979-1980 export season, com
pared to 14.9 million tons the
previous year.
U.S. exports totalled 15.3 mil
lion metric tons, compared to
11.2 million tons in 1978-1979.
Canada went from 2.1 million
tons last year to 3.5 million tons
this year. Australia from 0.1
million tons to 3.9 million, and
Argentina from 1.4 million to
5.5,
Community sources say they
do not reproach Argentina,
which never engaged in the "hy
pocrisy" of saying it would re
spect the embargo. But the
sources condemn Canada and
Australia for simply violating
the export ban. As for the United
States, some sources backed off
their previous harsh criticisms

when they were confronted with
the U.S. official explanations of
the statistics.
U.S. sources noted that the
Soviet-American five-year con
tract provides for 8 million tons
a year during a relatively arbi
trarily defined "agreement
year" that runs from October of
one year through September of
the, next. Carter had pledged
that Washington would honor
that contractual commitment
but would not deliver any extra
amounts.
Agriculture Department
sources say that a final total of
15.3 million tons for the year can
be reached by the Europeans by
ignoring the peculiar calendar
of the Soviet-American grain
agreement and figuring the year
a different way. When that is
done, the U.S. sources said. 6
million tons that were nego
tiated earlier this year but could
not be delivered until after this
Oct. 1 and 1.3 million tons added
in from last year did indeed
make a grand total of 15.3 mil
lion tons.
French follow US lead
Nevertheless. French of
ficials take the view that "if the
United States is not respecting
the embargo, there is no reason
for us to do it." France and the
rest of the Community went
beyond Carter's demands by
also applying an embargo on
"transformed grain" in the
form of meat and butter, the of
ficials said. "So we don't want
Thatcher coining to tell us now
that we are going to distress the
Americans by selling a little
butter to the Soviets.'" said a
Community source, referring to
British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's desire to
continue to strictly enforce the
embargo.
The United States continued
to sell the Soviet Union

"massive" quantities of soja
beans as livestock teed, said a
Community source who con
ceded that this sale was no vio
lation of the letter of the em
bargo but did contradict its spir
it.
The embargo turned out to be
"a bad joke.' said a French of
ficial. "The Europeans were the
only ones who respected it.'
France had a very good grain
harvest this year, and is ex
pected to sell its usual ti to 8 mil
lion tons to the other, grain
short members of the Com
munity. Hut French granaries
will still overflow, and French
agricultural officials say that
the country must sell 3 million
more tons of the current harvest
outside the Community.
A Brussels official noted that
France could sell its surplus to
China, which is in the market
for 7 million tons of grain. But,
he noted. France and the Com
munity would have to absorb the
heavy costs of shipping it that
far. "It makes much more sense
to sell it to the Russians, he
said
Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev indicated Tuesday
that this vear's Soviet harvest
was more than 30 million tons
short of the country's needs.
From the start. France has
said that it did not think eco
nomic sanctions against the So
viet Union were wise or helpful.
But the French government had
raised so many other objections
to measures Carter sought, such
as the boycott of the Olympic
Games, that Paris apparently
decided to mollify the United
States by pledging not to take
advantage of any slack created
by American application of eco
nomic sanctions. The French
maintain they strictly adhered
