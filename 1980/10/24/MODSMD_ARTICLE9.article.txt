# Jogging at Stanford, part II
## Searching for a change of pace? Check before you run 
### Jonathan Traugott 
For a change of pace from
well-worn campus routes, as a
jogger you'll sooner or later
want to blaze your own trails.
But before running straight for
the hills, you may want to know
which areas to avoid
Although much of the land
surrounding campus is owned
by the University, not even a red
and white T-shirt and a student
ID will allow you to run where
you please. Stanford leases
some of its land and performs
research on parts of the rest,
and rules designed to protect fa
cilities may prohibit tres
passers.
One area off limits is the
Jasper Ridge biological re

search area around Searsville
lake about four miles west of
campus. According to Zera Col
eman of the University Real Es
tate Office, fragile plants in the
area can be damaged by passing
runners, ruining months of stu
dent biological research.
The grounds around the Stan
ford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
are also tightly controlled Jog
gers may obtain passes into re
stricted areas provided no ex
periments are in progress. This
restriction is partly intended to
protect you from possible ex
posure to radiation, according
to Bob Adamson. staff associate
at SLAC.
Other University land, al
though officially off limits, re

mains popular with runners.
This includes the golf course
and the land surrounding Felt
Lake.
Despite the fact that the Felt
Lake run is featured in the Bay
Area Runners (iuide and is in
cluded in a list of jogging loca
tions distributed by the Athletic
Department, the land is closed
to students. The land is leased to
Fiers Dairy, and owner Roger
Fiers says joggers are not al
lowed on this side of Interstate
280 because they pose an insur
ance problem if injured, and in
the past they have interfered
with cattle driving.
'Die Felt Lake area is being
patrolled, says Roger Winslow

of the Santa Clara Sheriffs Of
fice, but arrests there are un
common.
Back on campus there are
several areas open to runners
year-round. Angell Field is open
at all hours (though unlit) and
its 1/4 mile track provides a
good place for beginners to build
up their endurance. Similarly,
the stadium is open from noon to
3 p.m. weekdays.
If you want to try barefoot
running. Roble Field is 1 3 mile
around and well cushioned with
grass. Finally, the route around
Lake Lagunita is a flat 1-1/4
miles long, and the lake is close
at hand for a refreshing plunge.
(Check the water level first. >

If you like to run and do ex
ercises at the same time, try the
Perrier Parcourse around
Roble Hall and the Olympic
Ciamefield at Encina. These are
both less than two miles and are
designed to tone up your entire
body, rather than just your legs.
Don't forget the Stanford
(Jrand Prix. This is a series of
Sunday morning races leaving
fromAngell Field and the stadi
um The Athletic Department
has more details.
So whether you re a flaccid
blob, aspiring marathoner or
both, the University offers a
place to work out, explore and
enjoy the scenery while you're
at it. Who ever said running
can't be fun?

Other University land, al
though officially off limits, re

mains popular with runners.
This includes the golf course
and the land surrounding Felt
Lake.
Despite the fact that the Felt
Lake run is featured in the Bay
Area Runners (iuide and is in
cluded in a list of jogging loca
tions distributed by the Athletic
Department, the land is closed
to students. The land is leased to
Fiers Dairy, and owner Roger
Fiers says joggers are not al
lowed on this side of Interstate
280 because they pose an insur
ance problem if injured, and in
the past they have interfered
with cattle driving.
'Die Felt Lake area is being
patrolled, says Roger Winslow

of the Santa Clara Sheriffs Of
fice, but arrests there are un
common.
Back on campus there are
several areas open to runners
year-round. Angell Field is open
at all hours (though unlit) and
its 1/4 mile track provides a
good place for beginners to build
up their endurance. Similarly,
the stadium is open from noon to
3 p.m. weekdays.
If you want to try barefoot
running. Roble Field is 1 3 mile
around and well cushioned with
grass. Finally, the route around
Lake Lagunita is a flat 1-1/4
miles long, and the lake is close
at hand for a refreshing plunge.

If you like to run and do ex
ercises at the same time, try the
Perrier Parcourse around
Roble Hall and the Olympic
Ciamefield at Encina. These are
both less than two miles and are
designed to tone up your entire
body, rather than just your legs.
Don't forget the Stanford
(Jrand Prix. This is a series of
Sunday morning races leaving
fromAngell Field and the stadi
um The Athletic Department
has more details.
So whether you re a flaccid
blob, aspiring marathoner or
both, the University offers a
place to work out, explore and
enjoy the scenery while you're
at it. Who ever said running
can't be fun?
