STANFORD UNIVERSITY
VICE PRESIDENT and PROVOST
The Search Committee for the positions of Vice President and
Provost seeks nominations. The position is that of Stanford Univer
sity's senior Vice President. In the absence of the President, the
Provost serves as Acting President. His or her day-to-day respon
sibilities center on academic and 112 aculty concerns, including budget
allocation and policy affecting all 112 aculty, students, and staff. Donald
Kennedy, and before him, William F. Miller, have served as Vice
President and Provost since 1971. We seek a successor to those
distinguished predecessors.
Nominations are welcome from any member of the Stanford com
munity. Please send yours in writing to President Kennedy or to any
member of the Committee listed below. We expect that the Provost
will be a person of both scholarly accomplishment and administra
tive ability. The person need not be a current member of the Stan
ford faculty. We especially welcome nominations of qualified
women and members of minority groups. Please submit your
suggestions prior to November 15, 1980.
