Be known
for the company you keep,
Some of the finest engineers and scientists in the
world work for the Aerospace Corporation. In fact, over
half of our technical staff holds an advanced degree.
One in four holds a Ph.D. This could be your chance to
join these people in shaping America's space program.
If you have (or soon will have) a degree in Engineering,
Science or Computer Science, we would like to talk to
you on campus.
We're doing some very interesting things.
Like contributing to the development of space
communication systems contained in a single laser
beam. For NASA, we have evaluated concepts for large
geostationary, synchronous space platforms. Some of
the concepts we're developing won't be used until the
21st century.
What you'll be doing.
That depends on your background and professional
interest. Typically, recent college graduates are
assigned to the engineering group or our research and
experimental laboratories. Your work could involve
anything from gamma ray radiation to the development
of a spaceborne computer capable of performing
unattended for up to seven years.
You'll like our style.
We're located in Southern California only three miles
from the Pacific Ocean. We work in a quiet, campus-like
atmosphere with extensive libraries and computation
facilities for support.
Meet us in person October 29.
We'll be on campus October 29.
You can sign up in the college placement office. Or
send your resume direct. Please include a short note
about your area(s) of professional interest.
The frontiers of technology are at The Aerospace Corporation.
