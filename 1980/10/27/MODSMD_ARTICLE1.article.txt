# Bookstore goes after shoplifters

As a result of last year's $200,000
loss to shoplifters, the Stanford Book
store has tightened security, accord
ing to store manager Kldon Speed.
The Bookstore is "taking a more ag
gressive stance towards this prob
lem," he said. "We're trying to
bolster our security staff."
As part of its new security effort,
the Bookstore has hired a group of
Stanford students to serve as under
cover guards, according to Speed. One
of the undercover guards, a junior,
said that on average there are
three security people floating around
the store at any given time. The guard
asked not to be identified.
An arrest each day
Security guards make an average of
one arrest a day for shoplifting, the
guard said. "And the Bookstore's poli
cy is that everyone who is caught is
prosecuted." he said.
Just over one-half of the accused
shoplifters are Stanford students. But
Stanford students get no preferential
treatment, he said.
"A lot of Stanford students are very
surprised when we bring them in here
and they say, 'I'll pay for it; I had the
money anyway," and we call the
cops." he said. "Even when they're in
court a few days later. I think they're
still a little amazed."
Seven on trial
Since this fall quarter began, the
Bookstore has brought about seven
people to court, he said.
By cracking down on shoplifters the
Bookstore hopes to deter potential of
fenders. according to the guard.
"People who are on line at the cash
registers know right away when some
one has been arrested, because we're
very loud." he said. "That's the best
deterrentâ€”dragging one person into
the store while 20 other people are
watching."
Another deterrent to shoplifters, he
said, is the Bookstore's new require
ment that all backpacks and books be
left outside the store. The backpack
ban means that security guards can
stop anyone leaving the store with
merchandise, and ask for a receipt, he
said.
"If we look through (the merchan
dise) and there's Chem 35 notes writ
ten all over, we know it's theirs," he
said. ' But if it's brand new we assume
it's ours and make them prove other
wise."
When a guard sees someone shop
lifting he must wait until the customer
