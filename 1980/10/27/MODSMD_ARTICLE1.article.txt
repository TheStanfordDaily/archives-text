# Bookstore goes after shoplifters
## 
### Alan Crystal 
As a result of last year's $200,000
loss to shoplifters, the Stanford Book
store has tightened security, accord
ing to store manager Kldon Speed.
The Bookstore is "taking a more ag
gressive stance towards this prob
lem," he said. "We're trying to
bolster our security staff."
As part of its new security effort,
the Bookstore has hired a group of
Stanford students to serve as under
cover guards, according to Speed. One
of the undercover guards, a junior,
said that on average there are
three security people floating around
the store at any given time. The guard
asked not to be identified.
An arrest each day
Security guards make an average of
one arrest a day for shoplifting, the
guard said. "And the Bookstore's poli
cy is that everyone who is caught is
prosecuted." he said.
Just over one-half of the accused
shoplifters are Stanford students. But
Stanford students get no preferential
treatment, he said.
"A lot of Stanford students are very
surprised when we bring them in here
and they say, 'I'll pay for it; I had the
money anyway," and we call the
cops." he said. "Even when they're in
court a few days later. I think they're
still a little amazed."
Seven on trial
Since this fall quarter began, the
Bookstore has brought about seven
people to court, he said.
By cracking down on shoplifters the
Bookstore hopes to deter potential of
fenders. according to the guard.
"People who are on line at the cash
registers know right away when some
one has been arrested, because we're
very loud." he said. "That's the best
deterrent—dragging one person into
the store while 20 other people are
watching."
Another deterrent to shoplifters, he
said, is the Bookstore's new require
ment that all backpacks and books be
left outside the store. The backpack
ban means that security guards can
stop anyone leaving the store with
merchandise, and ask for a receipt, he
said.
"If we look through (the merchan
dise) and there's Chem 35 notes writ
ten all over, we know it's theirs," he
said. ' But if it's brand new we assume
it's ours and make them prove other
wise."
When a guard sees someone shop
lifting he must wait until the customer
leaves the premises with any
merchandise before he takes action.
"Otherwise (the customer) can sim
ply say he was going to pay for it,"he
said.
Once the customer has left the
store, the guard can arrest him. The
arrest is legally termed a citizen's ar
rest. According to the law, any citizen
has the right to make an arrest for an
offense he witnesses.
"Once a shoplifter walks outside the
store, we don't really listen to very
many excuses." the guard said. "And
it's not because we're all hardnoses
... it sounds like a cliche to say that it
helps keep prices down, but it does."
After a guard makes the arrest, he
calls the police who then take custody
of the accused. Based on a police re
port, the district attorney decides
whether to take the accused shoplifter
to court.
If the customer is convicted of petty
theft (shoplifting of goods up to a val

ue of $200), he faces a minimum $50
fine. The maximum penalty for petty
theft is a $1000 fine and six months in
the county jail.
Once convicted of shoplifting a per
son has a permanent criminal record.
According to the Bookstore security
guard, many people do not realize they
can be arrested, convicted, and given
a criminal record for shoplifting.
Many think they can simply pay for
the stolen item, he said, especially if it
is their first offense.
"For three out of the first 15 people I
caught, it was the first time they had
ever stolen anything." he said.
"That's unfortunate."

He said he first became interested
in Bookstore security as a freshman.
As part of a sociology project he
wanted to see how much he could steal
from the Bookstore without getting
caught.
"We had to go out and do something
socially deviant," he said, "and see
the reactions we got from people."
With permission from the store
manager, he said he made four shop
lifting trips to the Bookstore. In less
than an hour he said he had stolen an
alarm clock, a lamp, a bike chain,
posters, and some smaller items — $65
of merchandise in all.
He then dropped the merchandise
on the store manager's desk to see her
reaction. "She was very surprised
that I did not get caught," he said.
Two years later he applied to be a
security guard at the Bookstore.
He said he told the manager. "Now
I'll be on your side for a while, and
we'll see how it works out."
