# Communist Party demands recognition
## Poland's unions suffer big setback 
### Washington Post 
Warsaw, Poland â€” Poland's
Communist authorities unex
pectedly moved into a new con
frontation with the country's in
dependent trade unions Thurs
day when a Warsaw court
agreed to formally register
them, but in the process ordered
two controversial changes in
their statute.
Union representatives im
mediately denounced "unilat
eral changes" and said they
would never accept them.
One change would force the
new national trade unions feder
ation. Solidaritv, to include in

its charter language recog
nizing the leading role of the
Communist Party in Poland.
The other struck from the draft
document a section defining the
newly won right to strike.
The decision incited fresh ten
sion between workers and the
government just at a time when
some of the union leaders, in
cluding Gdansk strike leader
Lech Walesa, had begun to take
a more moderate line, caution
ing against further strikes and
trying to shift worker attention
to the difficult problem of eco
nomic recovery.
Stunned by ruling
Stunned by the ruling, which
was read in open court after
four hours of discussion on Soli
darity's draft statute, Walesa
swept angrily out of the court
building to face a crowd of
thousands filling the street in
front.
"This is not what we
wanted," he declared. "This is
not what we wished. They will
not do to us things that we do not
want done."
Union leaders, who thought
they had worked out a com
promise with the government to
end a month-long impasse on the
registration issue, were
shocked by the court's action
and declared they would appeal
the changes to the Polish Su
preme Court.
Statute 'mutilated'
Later, at a news conference
held at a tractor factory here,
Walesa's tone was even
harsher. "Our statute was
mutilated in a manner without

precedence and without our
agreement," the union chief
stated. "We are indignant."
Walesa said the "unilateral
changes" in the statute had put
into doubt the Gdansk agree
ment, signed between Baltic
shipyard strikers and the gov
ernment Aug. 31. He announced
Solidarity would never agree to
them.
Why Polish authorities would
make such a move sure to incite
new worker unrest remained
unclear. In recent days, War
saw officials had sought to play
down the registration issue,
seemingly determined to get the
thorny issue settled.
It was speculated that Polish
leaders may have come under
presssure from their Warsaw
Pact partners, specifically the
Soviet Union, to stand firm on
the main objections to the draft
statute.
In any event, Friday's action
represents a sharp setback in
the still highly explosive proc
ess of working out a new balance
of forces in Poland. With the
registration issue now likely to
stay in the headlines for at least
another two weeks while Soli
darity prepares its appeal, ef
forts to bring the country back
to normalcy are certain to re
main frustrated.
Key phrases
The central dispute is over
the wording of the first para
graph of the Solidarity charter
which in draft form avoided ex
plicit recognition of the leading
role of the Communist Party, as
well as an endorsement of so

cialism as the foundation of
Polish society or any statement
of respect for Poland's al
liances.
These were key phrases in
cluded at government in
sistence in the Gdansk agree
ment and authorities expected
to see them again in the Solidar
ity statute. Union organizers
omitted them, arguing that the
new federation is nonpolitical
and so should not have political
language in its charter.
Following private talks this
week with government officials,
Solidarity representatives
thought the issue would be set
tled by attaching a protocol to
the court registration.
Nonpolitical status
At Friday's court hearing.
Walesa personally and the union
as a whole entered statements
reaffirming the leading role of
the party "in the state" while at
the same time declaring Soli
darity's nonpolitical status.
A second dispute was over the
right to strike, granted workers
in the Gdansk agreement though
left vague. Government of
ficials had expected the details
would be worked out in the proc
ess of drafting a new trade union
bill and labor code revisions.
But Solidarity included a sec
tion defining when and how
strikes would be called. The
court threw out the section and
substituted it with the sentence
that a strike could be called if all
other measures failed.
