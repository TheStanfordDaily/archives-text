##

WOW! November is the
month for "Women of the
World," a five-part series of
workshops on career op
portunities for women. "We
want to take some of the scare
and fright out of career de
cisions," says Kim McCord. one
of the program coordinators.
The program, in its third
year, will consist of five work
shops every Monday and Thurs
day evening from Nov. 6
through Nov. 20. Job searching,
resume writing, interviewing,
graduate schools and an over
view will be the topics pres
ented.
Guest speakers this year will
be women in top positions. Says
McCord. "We're going for the
biggies."
"It's not just a man's world,''
says McCord. "We want to show
women that if they put their
minds to it. they can go out and
succeed." The program's aim is
to show women the op
portunities available to them
and then help them take the first
step in taking advantage of
those opportunities.
One resource available to
women and all students is the
Career Planning and Placement
Center, one of the program's
sponsors. McCord says the pro
gram's organizers hope to make
women more at ease with going
into the CPPC to explore career
opportunities.
Other sponsors are the Wom
en's Center. Student Em
ployment Office, Stanford-in-
Business, Stanford-in-Govern

ment. Cap and Gown and the In
ter-Sororitv Council, which was
the sole sponsor the first two
years. Yvonne Hiltz. another co
ordinator. says some people did
not participate in past years be
cause the program was as
sociated with sororities. So this
year the committee aimed for a
broader base, she said.
This year's budget of $550.
which is larger than last year's,
has allowed organizers to set
high goals in projected atten
dance and number of guest
speakers. Average attendance
last year was 45 women at each
evening's workshop. The com
mittee hopes to increase that
number this year.
Each night three or four wom
en will speak and then answer
questions.
McCord explains that know
ing what they're looking for in
career opportunities helps
women decide what to study at
Stanford and how to prepare for
the future. "Women must re
alize that Stanford is not all
academics." says McCord.
The first workshop will be
concerned with job searching
and will be held Nov. 6. at 7 p.m
in the Meyer Forum Room.
Pending conformation, guest
speakers will be Georgia
Meredith, who was Foothill Col
lege's coordinator for Continu
ing Education for Women. Nan
cy Feddingale. consulting engi
neer with a master's degree in
mechanical engineering from
Stanford, and Maureen Shields,
expert on career and develop
ment.
