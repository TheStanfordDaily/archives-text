Assembly — Byron Sher
The Daily is pleased to strongly endorse
Democrat Byron Sher for the 21st District
seat in the California State Assembly.
Sher. a professor at the Law School, has
been actively involved in civic affairs in
this district — which includes Stanford
and Palo Alto — for many years. He has
worked for nine years on the Palo Alto
City Council, and has served two terms as
mayor.
The fact that every mayor Palo Alto has
had over the last 10 years supports Sher in
his campaign speaks well for his integrity
and ability to work well with people of
many political perspectives — an essen
tial quality for a state assemblyman.
Sher has shown a consistent concern for
environmental policy, and an ability to
translate that concern into action. We
think Sher's experience as member of the
San Francisco Bay Conservation and De
velopment Commission will enable him to
work effectively at preserving the Bay
and keeping it a place that people can en
joy-
Sher wisely opposes the Peripheral
Canal, a plan to siphon Northern Califor
nia's water to the southern part of the
state which not only would cost $5 billion
but would also cause irreversible environ
mental damage to the Sacramento River
delta and to the Bay.
Sher's experience also extends into oth
er areas of concern for this district. He
has served on the Santa Clara County
Transportation Commission and on the
Santa Clara County Industry Housing
Task Force.
When the Daily interviewed Sher. he im

pressed us as a thoughtful, concerned per
son with excellent experience and a devo
tion to hard work
Supervisor — Jim Jackson
Of the two candidates in the run-off for
the sth District seat on the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors, Jim Jackson
is better qualified and exhibits a deeper
understanding of the issues than his oppo
nent. Becky Morgan
Jackson, a two-term mayor of Cuper
tino and a councilman there since 1972. has
an unmatched diversity of experience in
local and regional government, ranging
from membership on the Association of
Bay Area Governments to the Urban De
velopment Open Space Committee.
As a public servant, he was ahead of his
time in seeking a solution to the jobs-hous
mg imbalance by rezoning industrial- and
commercial-zoned property for residen
tial use.
Though we feel Morgan would also
make a fine supervisor. Jackson has dem
onstrated an awareness that the solutions
to the overcrowding at the county jail, like
the problem itself, are complex ones.
On the county's Measure B. which would
require binding arbitration if a labor-con
tract impasse is reached between the
county and the deputy sheriffs, he sees
clearly that since the deputies are denied
the right to strike, they must have some
recourse to settle their labor disputes.
We feel confident Jackson has the
creativity and expertise to serve on the
board, because of his fine record and
stands on the issues.
