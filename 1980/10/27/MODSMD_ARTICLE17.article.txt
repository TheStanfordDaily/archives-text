## Any questions? 
### 
it is better to know some of the questions than all of the an
swers." — James Thurber
Why? Now there's a good interrogative for you. Terse, precise,
easy to pronounce, it has headed inquiries that have baffled the
philosopher for years. "Why do we exist?"; "Why do the unjust go
unpunished 0 " . "Why is chartreuse such an obnoxious color?" or a
case immediate to the Stanford student, "Why. when the professor
has finished his lecture, and scrupulously inquiries of the rows of
vacuous faces. Are there are questions?' — why is the resulting
query inevitably is this going to be on the mid-term 0 ' or 'Do we
have to read chapter 39°' "
In spite of the plethora of perfectly practical interrogatives that
the English language affords its speaker, we seem to have aban
doned the art of asking the incisive question, or in some situations,
asking the question at all
The five "W's" that you may have met in the fifth grade seem to
have been eternally damned to remain unexercised in their original
shameless personification, pinned to the bulletin board, "who,
what. when, where and why." drawn as hunchbacked ambulatory
question marks with Mr. How waving brilliantly from the distance.
Unimpressed, there we abandon them and their ilk. refusing to
phrase too cunning a question, either with or without them. Nor will
we befriend even the rhetorical inquiry that, amazingly, need not
really be answered at all. simply smirked at and responded to with a
witty reparte.
Here's how to use the rhetorical question. State an inquiry such as
"What is the root of this foundering state of deriving the incisive
question 0 " Then proceed to answer the question yourself.
One might follow the lead of many commentators of the day when
searching for a party to blame, and point out our education system
as being responsible for the demise of the querying attitude. Truly,
today 's educators seem biased towards the system of dishing out in
formation to be regurgitated on demand by the student. Education
geared to developing a student's curiosity and his ability to question
keenly has been virtually abandoned in primary instruction, at a
time when young minds should, in fact, be directed in reason.
The harm such a form of education inflicts upon itself and its stu
dents is immense. Students who fail to learn to question materials
with which they are presented will not approach full exploration of
the material In the classroom, our failure to question professors
may cost us their respect and lead to a dissolution of their interest
and effort in teaching undergraduate courses. Should we not
challenge them, professors may come to take their teaching respon
sibilities for granted In an institution such as Stanford, where un
dergraduate education seems to be steadfastly threatened by the
power of faculty research, it would be dangerous and disasterous to
incur such a loss of interest
Still, both the danger of a general demise of the art of the question
and the seeming root of such a demise must extend far beyond the
education system. A failure to question underlies many of the sig
nificant issues of recent existence. For example, the Holocaust
could only have occurred with the failure of the German ranks and
high command to question their orders of their conscience, and the
failure of the outside world to question their own inaction in the situ
ation One can list the White House staff who would not question its
president, and the American people as a whole, who failed to ques
tion rapidly enough American involvement in Southeast Asia.
Current issues demand far more fierce an inquisitive examina
tion than that which we apply in our mode of generally slackening
interest. Do we now aggressively question the dealings of the oil
companies, who can find no oil until the price rises to their satisfac
tion. and who, in turn expend immeasurable effort to control or
block development of all alternate forms of energy. Only a minority
speaks and is superficially responded to, while the majority pas
sively allows the status quo to remain as such.
Here, with the issues of energy and passivity, may lie the key to
understanding our abandonment of the art of the question. For the
process of inquiry is an active one. To probe, to ponder, to explore,
to investigate, to search, to fathom, each requires initiative. A
question will not slide unobtrusively into one's thoughts. It cannot
be looked up in the back of the book, only an answer may be found
there A good question is usually far more elusive a prey than is a
good answer Furthermore, the first is inescapably a prerequisite
to the second.
As Hamlet found when confronted with excruciating conflict in
his life, it was first necessary to formulate and explore the question.
"To be or not to be," one of the most famous queries of all, was in
itself the embodiment of eloquence of reason and the momentum
towards further genius. It is imperative that we learn to question
and adopt an attitude of active exploration in doing so. Mastery of
the art of questioning is the first step to eloquence in thought.

block development of all alternate forms of energy. Only a minority
speaks and is superficially responded to, while the majority pas
sively allows the status quo to remain as such.
Here, with the issues of energy and passivity, may lie the key to
understanding our abandonment of the art of the question. For the
process of inquiry is an active one. To probe, to ponder, to explore,
to investigate, to search, to fathom, each requires initiative. A
question will not slide unobtrusively into one's thoughts. It cannot
be looked up in the back of the book, only an answer may be found
there A good question is usually far more elusive a prey than is a
good answer Furthermore, the first is inescapably a prerequisite
to the second.
As Hamlet found when confronted with excruciating conflict in
his life, it was first necessary to formulate and explore the question.
"To be or not to be," one of the most famous queries of all, was in
itself the embodiment of eloquence of reason and the momentum
towards further genius. It is imperative that we learn to question
and adopt an attitude of active exploration in doing so. Mastery of
the art of questioning is the first step to eloquence in thought.

it is better to know some of the questions than all of the an
swers." — James Thurber
Why? Now there's a good interrogative for you. Terse, precise,
easy to pronounce, it has headed inquiries that have baffled the
philosopher for years. "Why do we exist?"; "Why do the unjust go
unpunished 0 " . "Why is chartreuse such an obnoxious color?" or a
case immediate to the Stanford student, "Why. when the professor
has finished his lecture, and scrupulously inquiries of the rows of
vacuous faces. Are there are questions?' — why is the resulting
query inevitably is this going to be on the mid-term 0 ' or 'Do we
have to read chapter 39°' "
In spite of the plethora of perfectly practical interrogatives that
the English language affords its speaker, we seem to have aban
doned the art of asking the incisive question, or in some situations,
asking the question at all
The five "W's" that you may have met in the fifth grade seem to
have been eternally damned to remain unexercised in their original
shameless personification, pinned to the bulletin board, "who,
what. when, where and why." drawn as hunchbacked ambulatory
question marks with Mr. How waving brilliantly from the distance.
Unimpressed, there we abandon them and their ilk. refusing to
phrase too cunning a question, either with or without them. Nor will
we befriend even the rhetorical inquiry that, amazingly, need not
really be answered at all. simply smirked at and responded to with a
witty reparte.
Here's how to use the rhetorical question. State an inquiry such as
"What is the root of this foundering state of deriving the incisive
question 0 " Then proceed to answer the question yourself.
One might follow the lead of many commentators of the day when
searching for a party to blame, and point out our education system
as being responsible for the demise of the querying attitude. Truly,
today 's educators seem biased towards the system of dishing out in
formation to be regurgitated on demand by the student. Education
geared to developing a student's curiosity and his ability to question
keenly has been virtually abandoned in primary instruction, at a
time when young minds should, in fact, be directed in reason.
The harm such a form of education inflicts upon itself and its stu
dents is immense. Students who fail to learn to question materials
with which they are presented will not approach full exploration of
the material In the classroom, our failure to question professors
may cost us their respect and lead to a dissolution of their interest
and effort in teaching undergraduate courses. Should we not
challenge them, professors may come to take their teaching respon
sibilities for granted In an institution such as Stanford, where un
dergraduate education seems to be steadfastly threatened by the
power of faculty research, it would be dangerous and disasterous to
incur such a loss of interest
Still, both the danger of a general demise of the art of the question
and the seeming root of such a demise must extend far beyond the
education system. A failure to question underlies many of the sig
nificant issues of recent existence. For example, the Holocaust
could only have occurred with the failure of the German ranks and
high command to question their orders of their conscience, and the
failure of the outside world to question their own inaction in the situ
ation One can list the White House staff who would not question its
president, and the American people as a whole, who failed to ques
tion rapidly enough American involvement in Southeast Asia.
Current issues demand far more fierce an inquisitive examina
tion than that which we apply in our mode of generally slackening
interest. Do we now aggressively question the dealings of the oil
companies, who can find no oil until the price rises to their satisfac
tion. and who, in turn expend immeasurable effort to control or
block development of all alternate forms of energy. Only a minority
