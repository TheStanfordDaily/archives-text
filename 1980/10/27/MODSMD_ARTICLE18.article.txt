# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Ella Gibson We need democratic meritocracy 
### 
If the ordinary citizens of eve
ry nation were allowed to vote
on whether or not to declare
war. there would never be an
other war It is governments
who wage war. To quote Jean-
Jacques Rousseau, "War is a re
lation not between man and man
but between state and state.'
The basic cause of war is the
primitive urge to dominate. Put
a strange horse in with other
horses and until it either proves
its dominance or learns its
place, there will be no peace in
the corral. This "pecking or
der" is true for all animal
groups, and for human groups
too, whether they are social, re
ligious or political. This urge for
dominance is most destructive
at the government level. War is
but an extension of power-poli
tics.
In today's world, one national
leader with this urge to domi
nate can cause monstrous de
struction of life and property.
Hitler is the supreme example
of this. In his reach for power he
led the German people into com
mitting hideous crimes and
caused a war that resulted in
global disaster.
In ancient times, war could be
profitable for the victors. They

could seize land, gold and
slaves The invention of the ma
chine gradually took the profit
out of war and made trade a
more rewarding activity. Na
tional leaders know this, but
their main goal is not profit; it is
power. And so wars continue.
The invention of the atomic
bomb made war not only un
profitable but certain disaster
for both the aggressor and the
victim. In military jargon it is
called mutually assured dis
aster, its acronym MAD con
stituting an apt diagnosis for the
activity.
In a nuclear war. there will be
no victors. National leaders
know this too, but still strive for
power via military might. The
Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency reported that
from 1963 to 1973, the total spent
by all nations for military
purposes was $2.5 trillion.
Billions are still being spent an
nually. This is the major cause
of world-wide inflation, un
employment and a rising crime
rate.
To the ordinary citizen in eve
ry nation, it seems incredible
that war is still being waged by
governments as if it were a ra
tional way to settle disputes.

And still each government is
spending more billions for more
weapons as the arms race con
tinues. War will come the mo
ment the paranoia of one mili
tary regime makes a "first
strike" seem necessary.
The question is, how can we,
the ordinary citizens of every
nation, bring to an end this mili
tary insanity 9 We cannot look to
the United Nations organization
for the answer. It is as ham
pered by the same shackles of
nationalism and power-hungry
leaders as is each of its member
nations.
The only possible solution is
to create an entirely new pat
tern for choosing national lead
ers. Instead of permitting men
ambitious for power to ma
neuver themselves into office,
leaders must be drafted by lot
tery from among those not seek
ing power, but who have made
notable achievements in their
own vocational fields. It will be
necessary to structure the lot
tery so that men and women
from each field are drafted into
service.
If young men can be drafted
for military service, it should be
possible to draft industrial engi
neers, scientists, lawyers,
educators and economists, for
brief terms, perhaps six years,
into government service at a
good salary.
Even at $100,000 a year, the
cost would be far less than the
present cost of electing political
candidates and maintaining
them in office. Furthermore,
since it would be a mark of dis
tinction to be chosen for this
kind of draft, objection would be
either nonexistent or minimal.
This drafting of leaders by
lottery from a selection of supe
rior achievers in specific fields
would create a democratic mer
itocracy. Citizens would still
have the right to vote, but they
would vote on issues and not on
candidates.
This new pattern of selecting
leaders would accomplish the
following benefits: one, it would
avoid the chicanery and save the
enormous expense of elections;
two. it would end the violence of
terrorists against rival political
parties; three, it would prevent
power-hungry men from maneu
vering themselves into leader

ship and continuing the national
rivalries that lead to war.
There is enough existing
knowledge today to solve most
of the major problems, i.e.,
over-population, poverty,
malnutrition, pollution of air,
soil and water, and many of the
diseases that plague mankind.
Deserts could be turned into or
chards, cities into attractive
areas with green spaces around
them, and the oceans could be
farmed for food.
This idea of a democratic
meritocracy will, of course, be
opposed by the established
power governments. However,
all young men of military draft
age will be in favor of it and so
will their parents. And so will
every citizen who would prefer
to have, not professional politi
cians but experienced business
managers, industrial engineers,
economists and educators, in
charge of national affairs.
The first efforts towards the
adoption of this new plan could
be taken only in countries where
the degree of freedom would
permit them; countries such as
the United States. Canada, Eng
land and others. The numerous
peace organizations in each
country could unite behind one
intensive program of publicity
to arouse the interest of the gen
eral public; labor unions could
be an international force for
spreading the idea; teachers in
elementary schools could begin
to emphasize the stupidity of
war; college students could be
come active propagandists to
end the ancient custom of using
them to commit wholesale
slaughter of people in other
lands. Writers and filmmakers
could provide more material
that will increase the awareness
that the current rivalry among
military regimes will lead in
evitably to nuclear holocaust.
What is most needed is total
civilian mobilization for peace,
and a political pattern that will
place into positions of power
only leaders capable of in
telligent cooperation for na
tional and international pros
perity.
The choice is clear; we must
abolish war. or war will destroy
all.

Palo Alto.)

(Ella Gibson is a resident of
Palo Alto.)
If the ordinary citizens of eve
ry nation were allowed to vote
on whether or not to declare
war. there would never be an
other war It is governments
who wage war. To quote Jean-
Jacques Rousseau, "War is a re
lation not between man and man
but between state and state.'
The basic cause of war is the
primitive urge to dominate. Put
a strange horse in with other
horses and until it either proves
its dominance or learns its
place, there will be no peace in
the corral. This "pecking or
der" is true for all animal
groups, and for human groups
too, whether they are social, re
ligious or political. This urge for
dominance is most destructive
at the government level. War is
but an extension of power-poli
tics.
In today's world, one national
leader with this urge to domi
nate can cause monstrous de
struction of life and property.
Hitler is the supreme example
of this. In his reach for power he
led the German people into com
mitting hideous crimes and
caused a war that resulted in
global disaster.
In ancient times, war could be
profitable for the victors. They

could seize land, gold and
slaves The invention of the ma
chine gradually took the profit
out of war and made trade a
more rewarding activity. Na
tional leaders know this, but
their main goal is not profit; it is
power. And so wars continue.
The invention of the atomic
bomb made war not only un
profitable but certain disaster
for both the aggressor and the
victim. In military jargon it is
called mutually assured dis
aster, its acronym MAD con
stituting an apt diagnosis for the
activity.
In a nuclear war. there will be
no victors. National leaders
know this too, but still strive for
power via military might. The
Arms Control and Disarma
ment Agency reported that
from 1963 to 1973, the total spent
by all nations for military
purposes was $2.5 trillion.
Billions are still being spent an
nually. This is the major cause
of world-wide inflation, un
employment and a rising crime
rate.
To the ordinary citizen in eve
ry nation, it seems incredible
that war is still being waged by
governments as if it were a ra
tional way to settle disputes.

And still each government is
spending more billions for more
weapons as the arms race con
tinues. War will come the mo
ment the paranoia of one mili
tary regime makes a "first
strike" seem necessary.
The question is, how can we,
the ordinary citizens of every
nation, bring to an end this mili
tary insanity 9 We cannot look to
the United Nations organization
for the answer. It is as ham
pered by the same shackles of
nationalism and power-hungry
leaders as is each of its member
nations.
The only possible solution is
to create an entirely new pat
tern for choosing national lead
ers. Instead of permitting men
ambitious for power to ma
neuver themselves into office,
leaders must be drafted by lot
tery from among those not seek
ing power, but who have made
notable achievements in their
own vocational fields. It will be
necessary to structure the lot
tery so that men and women
from each field are drafted into
service.
If young men can be drafted
for military service, it should be
possible to draft industrial engi
neers, scientists, lawyers,
educators and economists, for
brief terms, perhaps six years,
into government service at a
good salary.
Even at $100,000 a year, the
cost would be far less than the
present cost of electing political
candidates and maintaining
them in office. Furthermore,
since it would be a mark of dis
tinction to be chosen for this
kind of draft, objection would be
either nonexistent or minimal.
This drafting of leaders by
lottery from a selection of supe
rior achievers in specific fields
would create a democratic mer
itocracy. Citizens would still
have the right to vote, but they
would vote on issues and not on
candidates.
This new pattern of selecting
leaders would accomplish the
following benefits: one, it would
avoid the chicanery and save the
enormous expense of elections;
two. it would end the violence of
terrorists against rival political
parties; three, it would prevent
power-hungry men from maneu
vering themselves into leader

ship and continuing the national
rivalries that lead to war.
There is enough existing
knowledge today to solve most
of the major problems, i.e.,
over-population, poverty,
malnutrition, pollution of air,
soil and water, and many of the
diseases that plague mankind.
Deserts could be turned into or
chards, cities into attractive
areas with green spaces around
them, and the oceans could be
farmed for food.
This idea of a democratic
meritocracy will, of course, be
opposed by the established
power governments. However,
all young men of military draft
age will be in favor of it and so
will their parents. And so will
every citizen who would prefer
to have, not professional politi
cians but experienced business
managers, industrial engineers,
economists and educators, in
charge of national affairs.
The first efforts towards the
adoption of this new plan could
be taken only in countries where
the degree of freedom would
permit them; countries such as
the United States. Canada, Eng
land and others. The numerous
peace organizations in each
country could unite behind one
intensive program of publicity
to arouse the interest of the gen
eral public; labor unions could
be an international force for
spreading the idea; teachers in
elementary schools could begin
to emphasize the stupidity of
war; college students could be
come active propagandists to
end the ancient custom of using
them to commit wholesale
slaughter of people in other
lands. Writers and filmmakers
could provide more material
that will increase the awareness
that the current rivalry among
military regimes will lead in
evitably to nuclear holocaust.
What is most needed is total
civilian mobilization for peace,
and a political pattern that will
place into positions of power
only leaders capable of in
telligent cooperation for na
tional and international pros
perity.
The choice is clear; we must
abolish war. or war will destroy
