## Reagan oversimplifies and relies too much 
### 
For a man who yearns to sun
bathe his retirement days away
in the Oval Office putatively
coaching the nation into a
glorious renaissance of in
dustrial productivity, Ronald
Reagan dangerously over
simplifies the complex causes
of our nation's economic slug
gishness. Ronnie exudes
blustery assuredness about
ramshackle solutions and relies
too much on others to do his
thinking for him. Fortunately
for the Republican candidate's
overtaxed mind (but un
fortunately for his hapless
would-be constituents), a
"brain-trust" of conservative
economists is scurrying to prop
up Reagan's platitudes about
making America "great again"
with a bevv of maiden theories.

While espousing Friedman's
"free market'' approach as a
general guide to economics. Re
agan's more specific notecard
jottings dribble from an
iconoclastic U.S.C. economist
named Arthur Laffer.
In his celebrated Laffer
"curve," the professor from the
smog down south relates na
tional revenue and productivity
to the federal tax rate. Laffer
asserts that there exists only
one ideal tax rate at which max
imal productivity is stimulated
and at which the government
still pockets enough dimes and
quarters to meet its expenses.
Ostensibly, lowering taxes will
both swell personal disposal in
come (thereby inducing more
people to seek work, because
they will enjoy a higher real

wage), and will ease the financ
ing of corporate capital.
Laffer's concept is appealing
because he contends that by
lowering tax rates one can ac
tually increase government rev
enue. As tax rates rise to under
pin greater expenditures for so
cial security, welfare, and un
employment benefits, they en
counter diminishing returns.
Why? Because with each suc
cessive tax hike workers are
only able to bring home smaller
and smaller paychecks; lower
real salaries act as disincen
tives to the unemployed con
sidering the prospect of looking
for work. Due to the consequent
underemployment of the labor
force, aggregate taxable in
come declines so much that rev
enue even at the higher tax rates
declines with it. Conversely,
Laffer believes that the lower
ing of tax rates will whet "Prot
estant ethic" whistles so much
that increased tax revenues
gleaned from an expanding tax
base will far outstrip any losses
due to the decline in the
marginal rate.
Laffer fails to incorporate
into his theory several major
non-governmental causes of
lower productivity. Firstly, he
makes an unsupported assump
tion that lower tax rates neces
sarily induce the lazy among us
to work more. In economic
terms, he implies that the sub
stitution effect of a higher level
of income outweighs the con
comitant income effect. In the
substitution effect, higher real
wages induce people currently
watching soap operas and
cashing unemployment checks
to hit the pavement and find
work. In other words, the possi
bility of making more money
per hour encourages loafers to
start flipping hamburgers;
potential hamburger flippers
"substitute" soaps (or leisure
time) for increased income.
In the income effect, how
ever, higher real wages make
the people mixing the milk
shakes feel better off; assuming
that a certain real level of in
come satisfies all their needs,
these people will reduce total
man-hours contributed to the la

bor force in response to an in
come in the real wage. In other
words, our hamburger-flipper
will work only 35 hours instead
of 40, because he or she will still
receive the same paycheck
from Burger King.
Laffer, therefore, is mistaken
in assuming that higher real
wages automatically increases
the labor supply; a tax decrease
may persuade individuals not to
work more, or perhaps even
work less, because they can still
make the same income doing so
and enjoy viewing more soap op
eras. Empirical .evidence to
support the predominance of the
substitution effect over the in
come effect is scanty, and Laf
fer offers none of his own.
Reagan's claims that high
taxes destroy incentives to
work, produce, invest and save
reflect Laffer's influence on his
economic proposals. Although
as a short-term palliative a tax
cut appeals to all of us, such a
measure ultimately will prove
inflationary. Increases in per
sonal disposable income aug
ment demand for goods and ser
vices; in the short-run, how
ever, when productive facilities
are fixed and industrial output
can be increased only through
greater utilization of labor re
sources, the mismatch of de
mand to supply will cause prices
to rise. Inflation has a deleteri
ous impact on saving, invest
ment and productivity. It in
jures business by aggrandizing
the rates of return corporations
must receive to compete with
skyrocketing prices. Since in
terest rates rise with the gener
al price level, inflation makes it
more difficult for industry to
borrow money to finance capital
expenditures.
Neither Reagan nor Laffer
address the need for personal
saving in order to provide funds
for investment. The personal
savings rate in the United
States, slumbering at 4.7
percent of income, is the lowest
of any major industrial nation.
There are two reasons for this.
Primarily, due to an unabated
inflation rate, the real interest
earned on passbook accounts
typically is negative, signifying

a real loss of income if money is
saved. Because lower marginal
tax rates would fuel inflation in
the short run. real losses of in
come due to the declining value
of money will not slacken, and
the incentive to save will not im
prove. These are portents of
diminishing funds available for
investment, and thus further
downturns in productivity.
Secondly, Grandma Branner
doesn't stuff Ben Franklins into
her mattress any longer due to
the unparalleled prosperity of
the Social Security system,
which renders savings for pen
sions unnecessary. The present
system redistributes tax reven
ues from the young, who sub
sidize benefits being paid to re
cipients now. to the old; there
fore, those anticipating retire
ment and attempting to devise
ways of meeting expenses when
they retire find no need to save
money themselves, since they
are paying money into the sys
tem now for their expenses in
the future, even though at that
time their expenses will be met
bv unretired persons.
Yet nowhere has Reagan pro
posed reverting the Social Se
curity system back to its ori
ginal status as a "trust fund,"
into which persons paid for their
own future expenses for retire
ment; nor has he proposed
eliminating federal interest
rate restrictions on passbook
savings accounts, an action
which would help equalize in
terest rates on savings with the
inflation rate.
Although vituperation and ad
hominem attacks seldom jus
tify the disqualification of can
didates from consideration for
public office, the case against
Reagan (and his alter-ego Laf
fer) is economically defensible.
By indiscriminately assuming
predominance of the substitu
tion effect, by disregarding the
inflationary effects of a tax cut,
and by failing to propose in
creased incentives to save, Re
agan succumbs to advocating
politically expedient but in
tellectually deficient panaceas.
