## Hostages sway election 
### Washington Post 
Washington — For almost a year, President
Jimmy Carter has been riding the whirlwind
called the hostage issue. And now he is riding it
into the final days of his re-election campaign
— either to vindication and victory or humil
iation and defeat.
Among advisers to both Carter and Re
publican challenger Ronald Reagan, there is
little doubt that the safe return of the 52 Ameri
cans from Iran before Nov. 4 — which is both
election day and the first anniversary of their
capture — might give the president the lift he
needs to break open a very close contest.

But equally, they believe, a dashing of the
public's hopes for a resolution of the hostage
ordeal might be a blow from which Carter
could not recover.

While waiting. Carter aides were doing their
best to discount the rumors that a deal had
been made that would see the Americans leav
ing Iran before the middle of the week.
Across the Potomac River from Washing
ton. at the suburban Arlington, Va., head
quarters of the Reagan campaign, there was a
mixture of resignation and indignation in the
talk. Aides were alternately saying that they
knew all along that Carter wouid "pull some
thing like this" and predicting that "the public
will see how he's manipulating the situation."
A successful resolution of the hostage crisis
undoubtedly would make votes for Carter.
There is a mass of polling data showing that at
titudes toward Carter's handling of the
hostages are very good predictors of voting
preference. A survey by The Washington Post
of eight key states, completed early this
month, showed Carter enjoyed only a slight ov
erall advantage over Reagan in dealing with
Iran.
