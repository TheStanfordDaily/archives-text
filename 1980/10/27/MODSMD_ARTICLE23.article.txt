Los Angeles — About a month before the Califor
nia primary this year. Transportation Secretary
Neil Goldschmidt climbed into a helicopter with
Mayor Tom Bradley and flew over downtown Los
Angeles' Wilshire Boulevard corridor. The day af
ter the primary, Goldschmidt's Urban Mass
Transportation Administration announced a $12
million planning grant for a subway under
Wilshire Boulevard.
This year, planning grants for new subway or
trolley lines (which the transportation lexicon
now calls "light rail systems") also have been
awarded in Boston. Detroit. Honolulu and
Portland
New York City, northeastern New Jersey, Phil
adelphia, Cleveland. Washington. Chicago and
San Francisco — all with existing subway or

elevated systems — have received major grants
for new construction or renovation. Miami and
Baltimore have new systems under construction.
When it is added up. more than $1.5 billion in
federal money has been committed this calendar
year for subway or trolley projects around the
country — a remarkable turnaround in the admin
istration's view of rail transit.
The last time the Department of Transporta
tion (and Congress) demonstrated anything ap
proaching this enthusiasm for rail was in 1976,
when Transportation Secretary William Col
eman. campaigning hard for President Gerald
Ford, handed out the grant for the new elevated
railroad in Miami and promised Detroit $600 mil
lion for a subway (a promise that has yet to be
kept).
