# Nerve gas race poses tough choices
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Denver — Here at the foot of the Rocky Mountains, a complex of
buildings with two-foot thick, steel-lined concrete walls sits on a
windswept field Inside lie 901 bombs the U.S. Army filled with
deadly GB nerve agent in 1969 They were the last GB weapons the
nation ever made.
Eight hundred miles away, in the small town of Pine Bluff, Ar
kansas, a grim, gray barn of a building sits amid the young pines,
abandoned and unused since the Army quit making chlorine gas and
mustard agent there during World War 11. It is where the Depart
ment of Defense wants to go back into the business of making lethal
nerve agents.
After more than 10 years of not making chemical weapons, the
United States may begin production there of a new generation of
"binary" nerve agent; to once again fill artillery shells and bombs
with liquids so potent that the merest trace can disable or kill a hu
man being.
Decisions to be made over the next few months by federal policy
makers will determine whether current stockpiles at places like
Kockv Mountain constitute an adequate chemical warfare deter
rent or whether new production at Pine Bluff will be necessary, thus
introducing the possibility of a chemical arms race with the Soviet
Union.
Well over $10 billion in spending — for the manufacture of new
chemical agents and for the tedious, dangerous disposal of existing
supplies — could be involved.
Soviet stockpiles
The current concern over U.S. chemical stockpiles dates to the
October War of 1973 in the Middle East, when captured Soviet per
sonnel carriers were found to have filters and blowers for chemical
warfare protection and a new Soviet antidote for nerve agent ex
posure. That eventually lead to a reassessment of U.S. chemical
warfare protection and stockpiles.
Meanwhile, the Soviets have acquired such spray decontamina
tion devices as one that can rid a tank of nerve agent in seconds.
Some people believe this Soviet defensive capability has been
matched with increase stockpiling of chemical weapons.
Pentagon sources and others insist, however, that the United
States' primary goal remains a treaty with the Soviets banning the
manufacture and stockpiling of all chemical weapons. In 1969 Presi
dent Richard Nixon — after a nerve gas accident at Dugway Prov
ing Grounds in Utah killed or sickened 6000 sheep — ended U.S.
production of chemical agents, initiated a reduction in U.S.
chemical stockpiles and ordered the destruction of all biological
weapons. Those decisions eventually led to an agreement with the
Soviet Union to ban biological warfare and to agreements renounc
ing first use of chemical weapons.
Sen. Bill Armstrong (R-Colo.), a supporter of renewed nerve
agent production, recently declared. "The Soviets have responded

to our chemical disarmament by increasing the size and sophisti
cation of their poison gas arsenal."
Refugees have reported use of Soviet-supplied nerve agents in Af
ghanistan and Southeast Asia, yet to date there is no hard evidence.
First-strike deterrence
Much of the truth of the U.S. chemical arsenal is cloaked in the
mantle of "classified' and top secret But The Los Angeles
Times has been able to piece together this picture of American
stockpiles:
Seven years ago. the nation maintained a chemical arsenal of per
haps 47.000 tons of nerve agent and mustard blistering agent. Since
1973. 14.787.500 pounds of agent have been destroyed, leaving what
one source described as "more than adequate, roughly 40.000 tons"
of chemical agent. Most of it is GB and VX nerve agent, the re
mainder mustard.
Whatever the quantity of the chemical stockpile, doubts have
been raised as to its quality. At least 1100 weapons have leaked in
recent years and been destroyed, and Army officials say that given
the age of the stockpile in Colorado, "leakers" will continue to de
velop.
The Department of Defense had used the stockpile's deteriorat
ing condition as one reason to begin chemical agent production
anew, but several Army officials nevertheless replied "ves" when
asked if today's stockpile remains effective. And nerve agent re
moved from leaking Weteve bombs here proved to be as pure and as
potent as when it was made in the early '50s.
Mow much is adequate 9 "Deterrence," says a State Department
official, "is in the eye of the beholder." Thus exists the belief that an
adequate stockpile of chemical weapons deters the use of same.
Already. Congress has acted to set the nation on a course toward
new nerve agent production. Without hearings or investigations,
floor amendments have been approved by the House and the Senate
and signed by the president to provide $3.15 million for renovating
two buildings at Pine Bluff for production of new nerve agents. In
addition, the House only has approved an additional $19 million to
equip the facilities, but no money has yet been approved to begin
actual production.
