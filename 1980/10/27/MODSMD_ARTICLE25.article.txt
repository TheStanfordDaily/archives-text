Pullman, Wash. — Each run
was a stroke of the painter's
brush Nearly every pass had
the sculptor's touch It was of
fensive artistry created at its
finest by Darrin Nelson and
John Elway. who led Stanford to
a 48-34 Pacific-10 Conference
football victory over Washing
ton State Saturday at Martin
Stadium.
Nelson, the master of motion,
cut up, around and through the
Cougars for 369 total yards —
202 rushing on 21 carries and 167
receiving on 11 catches, mostly
short screens.
"I can say without a doubt
that that's the finest individual
performance I've ever seen.
l)arrin Nelson had an incredible
day," Cardinal head coach Paul
Wiggin said. "It was a great
performance by a quarterback
(p]lway), but it's got to be over
shadowed by Darrin — and it
should be."
Even Elway, who enjoyed his
finest game statistically with 29
completions in 36 attempts for
379 yards and a school and con
ference record-tying five touch
downs, verbally bowed to
Nelson. "He's unbelievable —
the quickest person I've ever
seen," Elway said of his incom
parable running back.
Nelson himself acknowledged
that it was a "dream game," his
most satisfying outing since
Stanford's 30-10 triumph in the
1978 Big Game, when he single
handedly humbled California's

defense with 177 yards rushing
and two touchdowns The 5-
foot-9, 177-pounder felt pleased
by "the way I was running the
football — cutting, catching the
ball well . . . that's the way I
play football, trying to get out in
the open field and do what I do
best."
Examples of Nelson's doing
what he does best abounded. On
Stanford's third play of the
game. Nelson took a short swing
pass from Elwav. Cougars Matt
Elisara and Lee Blakeney ap
peared to have Nelson trapped
for no gain, but after giving
some brisk cha-cha steps and
putting on a mercurial burst of
speed, Nelson darted for 9
yards.
Nelson provided the 30,371
witnesses with a masterpiece
early in the second quarter,
stutter-stepping and accelerat
ing to a 40-yard gain on a simple
off-tackle play. A synthesis of
quickness, deception and
power, it was a vintage Nelson
run. one which his detractors
said he had become incapable of
executing after last year's
hamstring injury.
"People . . . would tell me
things they'd hear other people
say — that I couldn't run that
well (anymore)," Nelson said.
"But I knew that if I could get in
the open field, I could still run."
What's more, Nelson knew
Saturday when not to run. Short
ly before halftime on second
and-three from WSU's 21-yard
line, Elway handed off to

Nelson, who actually waited for
an instant until the offensive
linemen gave him running
room Nelson's patience earned
him 12 yards on the play.
With these and other runs,
Nelson amassed the third
highest single-game rushing fig

ure in Card history and his own
second-best. He set a personal
single-game record for recep
tions. and it also marked the
first time in his glittering ca
reer that he had gained more
than 100 yards receiving
Other Cards distinguished

themselves on offense In addi
tion to equaling the touchdown
pass record. Elwav established
personal bests for completions
and yardage while passing with
velocity to his wide receivers
and subtlety to his running
backs.

"John's the best quarterback
in the nation to me. right now.
bar none," Nelson stated flatlv
"If he were a junior and had the
publicity, he would win the
Heisman Trophy."
Split end Andre Tyler bene
fited from Elwav's efficiency,

snatching a career-high nine
passes for 119 yards and a touch
down. Tvler's receptions came
