# Backs exhibit their greatest offensive show ever
## Nelson, Elway paint Pullman red in Cards' 48-34 win 
### Chris Haft 
Pullman, Wash. — Each run
was a stroke of the painter's
brush Nearly every pass had
the sculptor's touch It was of
fensive artistry created at its
finest by Darrin Nelson and
John Elway. who led Stanford to
a 48-34 Pacific-10 Conference
football victory over Washing
ton State Saturday at Martin
Stadium.
Nelson, the master of motion,
cut up, around and through the
Cougars for 369 total yards —
202 rushing on 21 carries and 167
receiving on 11 catches, mostly
short screens.
"I can say without a doubt
that that's the finest individual
performance I've ever seen.
l)arrin Nelson had an incredible
day," Cardinal head coach Paul
Wiggin said. "It was a great
performance by a quarterback
(p]lway), but it's got to be over
shadowed by Darrin — and it
should be."
Even Elway, who enjoyed his
finest game statistically with 29
completions in 36 attempts for
379 yards and a school and con
ference record-tying five touch
downs, verbally bowed to
Nelson. "He's unbelievable —
the quickest person I've ever
seen," Elway said of his incom
parable running back.
Nelson himself acknowledged
that it was a "dream game," his
most satisfying outing since
Stanford's 30-10 triumph in the
1978 Big Game, when he single
handedly humbled California's

defense with 177 yards rushing
and two touchdowns The 5-
foot-9, 177-pounder felt pleased
by "the way I was running the
football — cutting, catching the
ball well . . . that's the way I
play football, trying to get out in
the open field and do what I do
best."
Examples of Nelson's doing
what he does best abounded. On
Stanford's third play of the
game. Nelson took a short swing
pass from Elwav. Cougars Matt
Elisara and Lee Blakeney ap
peared to have Nelson trapped
for no gain, but after giving
some brisk cha-cha steps and
putting on a mercurial burst of
speed, Nelson darted for 9
yards.
Nelson provided the 30,371
witnesses with a masterpiece
early in the second quarter,
stutter-stepping and accelerat
ing to a 40-yard gain on a simple
off-tackle play. A synthesis of
quickness, deception and
power, it was a vintage Nelson
run. one which his detractors
said he had become incapable of
executing after last year's
hamstring injury.
"People . . . would tell me
things they'd hear other people
say — that I couldn't run that
well (anymore)," Nelson said.
"But I knew that if I could get in
the open field, I could still run."
What's more, Nelson knew
Saturday when not to run. Short
ly before halftime on second
and-three from WSU's 21-yard
line, Elway handed off to

Nelson, who actually waited for
an instant until the offensive
linemen gave him running
room Nelson's patience earned
him 12 yards on the play.
With these and other runs,
Nelson amassed the third
highest single-game rushing fig

ure in Card history and his own
second-best. He set a personal
single-game record for recep
tions. and it also marked the
first time in his glittering ca
reer that he had gained more
than 100 yards receiving
Other Cards distinguished

themselves on offense In addi
tion to equaling the touchdown

personal bests for completions
and yardage while passing with

victory. The shifty running back gained 369 total
yards, 202 of them rushing and 167 receiving.

Darrin Nelson spent all day Saturday running
through WSU's defense in Stanford's 48-34 Pac-10
passes, but two of them were for
touchdowns The 1979 consensus
All-America also became the
Cards' all-time leader in receiv
ing vardage with 2254, eclipsing
Tony Hill's 2225.
With these efforts. Stanford's
offense functioned nearly im
peccably. roaring for 664 total
yards, only 17 short of the all
time Card record set in 1968
against San Jose State. The
Cards' point total was their
highest since they scored 54
against WSU in 1976
However. Stanford's defense
was as porous as its offense was
productive. Versatile quarter
back Samoa Samoa (206 yards
passing. 134 rushing) directed a
WSU attack that shredded the
Cards for 551 yards.
Wiggin admitted that Stan
ford needed its offensive ex
plosion. considering the
Cougars' dangerous offense and
the Cards' questionable de
fense. "You don't like to talk
about negative things, but you
knew WSU could score —
they're a 400-yard-a-game of
fense." he said.
Stanford opened the point pa
rade. jumping to a 14-0 lead.
Elwav climaxed a nine-plav. 74-
vard drive following the opening

kickoff by hitting Margerum
with a 12-vard pass in the left
corner of the end zone. Cougar
nose guard Brian Flones
blocked Ken Naber's extra
point attempt, snapping
Naber's string of 33 consecutive
PAT's.
WSU nearly tied it on its first
play from scrimmage, but split
end Mike Wilson, who had
beaten Card cornerback Mike
Taylor, dropped Samoa's long
pass.
Samoa endured more woe on
the following play, when Duker
Dapper forced him to fumble
the ball. Linebacker Jay Sum
mers recovered it for the Cards
on the WSU 8. and an enterpris
ing Elwav hooked up with
Margerum again, this time bul
leting one past safety Paul
Sorenson A two-point con
version succeeded on Elway's
pass to Nelson.
Stanford twice held 17-point
leads, at 20-3 and 27-10. after
touchdown catches by Tyler and
Nelson, respectively. The latter
was particularly entertaining:
on first down from WSU's 44.
Elwav rolled left and was in
danger of being sacked by line
backer Scott Pelluer. but the
sophomore's neat cut-back pro
longed Pelluer's chase. Elwav

then sauntered behind Brian
Holloway 's block of Pelluer and
hurled a slightly wobbly pass to
Nelson, a lonely figure in the
end zone
The Cougars charged back
with a touchdown and a field
goal before halftime and tied
the score at 27-27 early in the
third quarter on Samoa's 3-yard
play-action pass to flanker Paul
Escalera. but Stanford drove 97
and 75 yards on its next two
possessions to score vital touch
downs.
Tim Davev's well-placed 38-
vard punt gave Stanford the ball
on its own 3. but Nelson's run
ning and Tyler's catching
helped the Cards move to the
Cougar 1, from where Elwav
vaulted into the end zone.
After another WSU punt,
Elwav passed to Nelson again
for a touchdown, this time on a
24-yard screen play with Nelson
rambling down the left sideline
behind solid blocking.
Mike Washington's 1-vard run
cut Stanford's advantage to
41-34 with 7:00 left to play, but
the Cards' subsequent nine
play. 85-yard drive, capped by

run around right end i aided by

Nelson provided the 30,371
witnesses with a masterpiece
early in the second quarter,
stutter-stepping and accelerat

off-tackle play. A synthesis of
quickness, deception and
power, it was a vintage Nelson
run. one which his detractors
said he had become incapable of
executing after last year's
hamstring injury.
"People . . . would tell me
things they'd hear other people
say — that I couldn't run that
well (anymore)," Nelson said.
"But I knew that if I could get in
the open field, I could still run."
What's more, Nelson knew
Saturday when not to run. Short

Nelson, who actually waited for

him 12 yards on the play.
With these and other runs,
Nelson amassed the third
highest single-game rushing fig

defense with 177 yards rushing

by "the way I was running the

Examples of Nelson's doing
what he does best abounded. On
Stanford's third play of the
game. Nelson took a short swing
pass from Elwav. Cougars Matt
Elisara and Lee Blakeney ap
peared to have Nelson trapped
for no gain, but after giving
some brisk cha-cha steps and
putting on a mercurial burst of
speed, Nelson darted for 9
yards.
Nelson provided the 30,371
witnesses with a masterpiece
early in the second quarter,
stutter-stepping and accelerat
ing to a 40-yard gain on a simple
off-tackle play. A synthesis of
quickness, deception and
power, it was a vintage Nelson
run. one which his detractors
said he had become incapable of
executing after last year's
hamstring injury.
"People . . . would tell me
things they'd hear other people
say — that I couldn't run that
well (anymore)," Nelson said.
"But I knew that if I could get in
the open field, I could still run."
What's more, Nelson knew
Saturday when not to run. Short
ly before halftime on second
and-three from WSU's 21-yard
line, Elway handed off to

Nelson, who actually waited for
an instant until the offensive
linemen gave him running
room Nelson's patience earned
him 12 yards on the play.
With these and other runs,
Nelson amassed the third
highest single-game rushing fig

ure in Card history and his own
second-best. He set a personal
single-game record for recep
tions. and it also marked the
first time in his glittering ca
reer that he had gained more
than 100 yards receiving

yards, 202 of them rushing and 167 receiving.

Darrin Nelson spent all day Saturday running
through WSU's defense in Stanford's 48-34 Pac-10
passes, but two of them were for
touchdowns The 1979 consensus
All-America also became the
Cards' all-time leader in receiv

Tony Hill's 2225.
With these efforts. Stanford's
offense functioned nearly im
peccably. roaring for 664 total
yards, only 17 short of the all
time Card record set in 1968
against San Jose State. The
Cards' point total was their
highest since they scored 54
against WSU in 1976
However. Stanford's defense
was as porous as its offense was
productive. Versatile quarter
back Samoa Samoa (206 yards
passing. 134 rushing) directed a
WSU attack that shredded the
Cards for 551 yards.
Wiggin admitted that Stan
ford needed its offensive ex
plosion. considering the
Cougars' dangerous offense and
the Cards' questionable de
fense. "You don't like to talk
about negative things, but you
knew WSU could score —
they're a 400-yard-a-game of
fense." he said.
Stanford opened the point pa
rade. jumping to a 14-0 lead.
Elwav climaxed a nine-plav. 74-

kickoff by hitting Margerum
with a 12-vard pass in the left
corner of the end zone. Cougar
nose guard Brian Flones
blocked Ken Naber's extra
point attempt, snapping
Naber's string of 33 consecutive
PAT's.
WSU nearly tied it on its first
play from scrimmage, but split
end Mike Wilson, who had
beaten Card cornerback Mike

pass.

touchdown catches by Tyler and
Nelson, respectively. The latter
was particularly entertaining:

Elwav rolled left and was in
danger of being sacked by line

sophomore's neat cut-back pro

The Cougars charged back
with a touchdown and a field
goal before halftime and tied
the score at 27-27 early in the
third quarter on Samoa's 3-yard
play-action pass to flanker Paul
Escalera. but Stanford drove 97

possessions to score vital touch
downs.
Tim Davev's well-placed 38-
