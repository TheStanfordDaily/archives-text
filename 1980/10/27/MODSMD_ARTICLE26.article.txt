# Stanford cements claim to a No. 1 ranking
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
Stanford overcame less-than
perfect performances this
weekend to cement its No. 1
ranking this weekend, defeating
sixth-ranked UCLA 10-5 and sec
ond-ranked UC-Irvine 10-8 at de-
Guerre Pool. The victories gave
the Cardinals a 21-1-1 record,
while Friday's win over the
Bruins improved their Pacif
ic-10 Conference mark to 3-0.
It was a successful home
coming for the Cards, who had
played on the road for the ma
jority of the first half of the sea
son. They suffered only one ear
ly-season loss, to UC-Irvine at
their tournament and a tie with

California at the NorCal tour
nament held here three weeks
ago.

Though Saturday's game
against Irvine was a non-con
ference game, it may have been
the more important victory of
the two. The two teams were
meeting for the third time this
season, each having defeated
the other once in earlier tour
naments.
The game began as one might
expect any contest for the top
ranking to start: both defenses

were particularly tenacious.
Both offenses were able to find
scoring room in the second
quarter, however, and Stanford
led by one goal at the half, 4-3.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti was less than pleased
with his team's performance in
the first half, but attributed the
lack of offensive effectiveness
to adrenalin rather the supposed
letdown.
"The score was only 1-1 at the
end of the first quarter, and I
think we should have had three
or four goals. It was a matter of
missed opportunities. We had a
good intensity level, but maybe
the guys were so pumped up that

they were overshooting,'' he
said.
The second half was every bit
as tight as the first; each team
was able to score only one goal
apiece in the third quarter, and
Irvine outscored Stanford 2-1 to
tie the game at six. The game
then went into a six-minute (two
three-minute quarter) over
time.
Last week Dettamanti said he
noticed a pattern emerging in
which his team had one big scor
ing quarter per game. This week
Stanford seemed to save that
spurt for the overtime. Jodv
Campbell played hero once
again, hitting three goals from

the hole, two in the fifth quarter
and one in the sixth With five
seconds remaining Bill Taylor
took advantage of an Irvine
press and lobbed the ball in the
goal from mid-pool for the final
tally.
Dettamanti said that Stan
ford's overall performance in
the game was not up to its usual
standards. "We did not play
well against Irvine, and I don't
know why," he said. "But if we
can have an ordinary game and
still beat a team like UC-Irvine.
it makes you feel pretty good."
' Campbell is now the team's
leading scorer with 35 goals, an
unusual figure for a hole man.
who is typically the team's plav
maker rather than its big
scorer. Dettamanti attributes
Campbell's success to his ag
gressiveness and mobility with
the ball.
"Jody is playing the best that
I've ever seen him. The hole
man usually is fouled a lot and
passes off, but he is being ag
gressive and showing a lot of
agility. I think he wants to win it
a lot more than last year." the
Stanford coach said.
Against UCLA, however, no
one seemed to want anything.

There was evidence of some
complacency on the Cardinals'
part in the first half. Stanford
jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first
quarter only to allow the Bruins
to close within 3-2 by halftime.
"We got ahead with a nice
lead and then just sat back and
got complacent. Our play lacked
intensity." Dettamanti said.
"At halftime we talked about
the importance of the game. It
was a conference game and we
couldn't just mess around with
them." he added.
Dettamanti apparent Im
pressed the point home, because
the Cardinals returned for the

second half showing more in
tensity than he had seen all sea
son. outscoring the Bruins 7-3.
Campbell was leading scorer
for Stanford with four goals.
Chris Kelsey had three, and
Jamie Bergeson. Steve Smith
and Brian Felix added one each.
Kelsey and Campbell started
off the scoring flurry early in
the third quarter. Campbell hit
ting from the hole and Kelsey
driving inside, to make the
score 5-2. Campbell was able to
score again minutes later when
the Cards gained a man-up ad
vantage. and the game was
practically over.

Stanford's Brian Felix meets the bail in water The Cardinals defeated both UCLA and UC
polo action this past weekend at deGuerre Pool. Irvine.
Stanford overcame less-than
perfect performances this
weekend to cement its No. 1
ranking this weekend, defeating
sixth-ranked UCLA 10-5 and sec
ond-ranked UC-Irvine 10-8 at de-
Guerre Pool. The victories gave
the Cardinals a 21-1-1 record,
while Friday's win over the
Bruins improved their Pacif
ic-10 Conference mark to 3-0.
It was a successful home
coming for the Cards, who had
played on the road for the ma
jority of the first half of the sea
son. They suffered only one ear
ly-season loss, to UC-Irvine at
their tournament and a tie with

California at the NorCal tour
nament held here three weeks
ago.

Water polo

Though Saturday's game
against Irvine was a non-con
ference game, it may have been
the more important victory of
the two. The two teams were
meeting for the third time this
season, each having defeated
the other once in earlier tour
naments.
The game began as one might
expect any contest for the top
ranking to start: both defenses

were particularly tenacious.
Both offenses were able to find
scoring room in the second
quarter, however, and Stanford
led by one goal at the half, 4-3.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti was less than pleased
with his team's performance in
the first half, but attributed the
lack of offensive effectiveness
to adrenalin rather the supposed
letdown.
"The score was only 1-1 at the
end of the first quarter, and I
think we should have had three
or four goals. It was a matter of
missed opportunities. We had a
good intensity level, but maybe
the guys were so pumped up that

they were overshooting,'' he
said.
The second half was every bit
as tight as the first; each team
was able to score only one goal
apiece in the third quarter, and
Irvine outscored Stanford 2-1 to
tie the game at six. The game
then went into a six-minute (two
three-minute quarter) over
