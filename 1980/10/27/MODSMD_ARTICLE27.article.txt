## Bruins keep rolling; Navy sinks Huskies 
### Associated Press 
No. 3-ranked UCLA continued
its dominance over California
and unheralded Navy shocked
Washington Saturday in Pacif
ic-10 Conference football.
UCLA. 6-0 overall and 2-0 in
the Pac-10. stymied Cal 32-9 at
Berkeley and figured to move
into second place in the national
rankings this week due toTexas'
upset loss to SMU.
Bruin sophomore quarter
back Tom Ramsey passed for
two touchdowns and ran for an
other in UCLA's ninth straight
win over the Bears. The Bruins
broke Cal's back in the second
quarter on Jo Jo Townsell's 100-
yard kickoff return. The Bears'
only touchdown was on a one
yard run by quarterback Rich
Campbell, who completed 28 of
42 passes for 225 yards.
Underdog Navy, with quar
terback Fred Reitzel scoring
three touchdowns, danced away
from 18th-ranked Washington
24-10 at Seattle. Reitzel scored
on runs of 10 and two yards and
fell on an Eddie Meyers fumble
in the end zone for his third TD.
Washington quarterback Tom
Flick, who engineered last
week's cliffhanger victory over
Stanford, completed 19 of 30
passes for 228 yards and one
touchdown, but the Huskies
couldn't handle the Mid
shipmen's Reitzel.
Oregon, which held USC to a
7-7 tie last week, stifled the Ne
vada-Las Vegas offensive ma
chine 32-9 in a non-conference

contest at Eugene.
Oregon tackles Scott Set
terlund and V'ince Goldsmith
combined for eight quarterback
sacks against a UNLV' offense
that had averaged just under 40
points per game this year. Duck
quarterbacks Reggie Ogburn
and Kevin Lusk passed and ran
for four touchdowns as Oregon
improved its record to 3-2-2.
Fourth-ranked Notre Dame
scored two touchdowns in the
first half — one an 80-vard TD
run by freshman kicker Blair
Kiel out of punt formation — and
held Arizona to under 100 yards
offense to beat the Wildcats 20-3
at Tucson.
Arizona, now 2-4, was able to
score only on Brett Weber's 21-
vard field goal in the second
quarter. The Irish remained un
beaten at 6-0.
Long Beach State pulled off a
dramatic 31-21 come-from-be
hind victory over Oregon State
at Corvallis in.he 49ers' first
ever football game with a
Pac-10 school.
Quarterback Kevin Starkev
paced the winners with 290
yards on 15 of 23 passes over the
winless Beavers. 0-6. Long
Beach State's record is 4-3.
Arizona State ran its record to
4-2 with an easy 37-9 non-con
ference thrashing of the Univer
sity of Pacific. Quarterback
Mike Pagel threw for two touch
downs and the Sun Devils' de
fense accounted for eight points
on an interception returned for a
touchdown and a safety.
