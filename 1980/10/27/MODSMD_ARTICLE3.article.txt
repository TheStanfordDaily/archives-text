# Four from Stanford area
## Scientists endorse Carter 
### Bill Beyda 
Four Stanford area scientists and
engineers have endorsed President
Jimmy Carter for reelection.
The four are Sidney Drell, deputy
director of the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center (SLAC). Burton
Richter. a Nobel Laureate physicist at
SLAC. George Pake, physicist and di
rector of the Xerox Corporation's Palo
Alto Research Center, and Edward
Ginzton, chairman of the board of Var
ian Associates.
The endorsement which now in
cludes 18 prominent scientists from
across the nation, was organized by
Drell and John Deutsch of the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology.
Carter more rational
Ginzton said, "I looked at Carter's
record. 1 believe he has been consis
tent and rational. All things con
sidered. I think he will make a better
president."
Richter felt that Carter was "more
sensible" than Republican challenger
Ronald Reagan. The four agreed they
would be more confident in Carter's
ability to face a crisis than in Re
agan's.

Drell considered the issue of world
peace and national security to be of ut
most importance. Drell has been a de
fense policy adviser for every admin
istration since Dwight Eisenhower
took office in 1952. This is the first
time he has publicly supported a presi
dential candidate.
Drell said, "1 looked at the
challenges we will face in the next
four years . . . and Carter's guiding
principles are more rational than Re
agan's. Reagan wants nuclear superi
ority. We already have a superior nu
clear position beyond any rational
planning. Carter's balanced commit
ment of strength and arms control is
more sensible."
"Reagan wants to scrap SALT II
and renegotiate after we have in
creased our strength," said Richter.
"It's silly to build up and then dis
arm; why not disarm now''" Fake
said. "It's our only viable alter
native."
Energy problems considered
Richter raised several points about
the national energy supply. "Reagan
said there isn't any energy problem.
There is definitely a problem. Even if
we strip mine extensively, we would
only be able to supply our own needs.
Reagan's solution is not a viable one
for the western world." he said.

Richter and Pake both felt that
Carter was a better candidate for the
scientific community. "Carter has a
clearer view of science," said
Richter. "Reagan said that evolution
is just another theory among many.
This seems very silly to me."
"In the years Carter has been in of
fice. federal funding for research and
development programs has in
creased." said Pake. Spending had
been curtailed during former Presi
dent Richard Nixon's administration
and might started its upward
climb with former President Gerald
Ford, but he was in office for too short
a time to have much effect, he said.
Ginzton said he felt Reagan's sup
port for education was inadequate. "I
don't think he supported higher educa
tion very well as governor of Califor
nia." he said.
All the scientists felt that .John An
derson, the independent candidate,
was not a serious choice at the mo
ment. If it were a race between An
derson and Carter, they felt they
would give Anderson greater con
sideration. The scientists felt that An
derson is a better choice than Reagan,
but without major party affiliation
he's out of the race.
Drell felt that the scientists repre
sent a good cross-section of voters.
