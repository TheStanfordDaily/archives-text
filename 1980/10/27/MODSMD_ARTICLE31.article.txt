# Cards dominate No. 17 Broncos
## Stanford knocks off Santa Clara 4-1 
### Richard Martinez 
Stanford's soccer team
mustered its finest per
formance of the season to
soundly defeat Santa Clara 4-1
yesterday afternoon at Stanford
Stadium. The Cardinals, who
went into the contest with a
H-10-1 record, proved that such
numbers can be deceiving as
they thoroughly dominated the
Broncos.
A confident Card squad con
trolled the tempo of play from
the start although the match's
first 15 minutes were scoreless.
When striker Willie Giucci
tallied Stanford's first goal with
29:19 left to play in the first half
on an strong individual effort,
the superiority of the Cardinal
club began to show The flow of
play was quite swift on both
ends of the field, but the Cards
were more aggressive and suc
cessful in pressuring the oppos
ing goal.
More than 10 minutes later
Stanford added another goal on
a finely-executed corner kick.
Sophomore Mark Talkington
banged it in off a Ted Rafalovich
assist.
Just 55 seconds later those
two players switched roles:
Rafalovich made it 3-0 Stanford
with Talkington assisting.
Santa Clara was last week
rated 17th in the nation and third
in the West. The Broncos, how
ever. have had a much easier
schedule compared to Stan
ford's. Thus, the meager crowd
at Stanford Stadium saw a na
tionally-ranked club lose to a
below-.500 squad.
Coach Nelson Lodge ex
plained his club's surprising
domination. "I saw Santa Clara
play Fresno last Tuesday and

observed some very evident
weaknesses.'' he said After
Lodge's scouting. Stanford
spent all week practicing the ex
ploitation of Santa Clara's full
backs and cautious zone-type
defense
It was like dress rehearsal
Thursday and Friday." Lodge
said "We worked on beating
their weak points and it sure

paid off today We penetrated
their defense. Jorge (Titingeri
dominated the middle, ami we
executed our corner kicks beau
tifully If we weren t aware of
those glaring weaknesses
before the game, we probably
wouldn't have been able to ad
just until the second halt
Instead, a supremely confi
dent Stanford squad entered the

final 45 minutes with a com
-1 ortable lead and the luxury of
dictating the game's tempo.
\fter Santa Clara foiled goal
ie .Jeff .Jones shutout on a de
fensive mix-up. Stanford closed
the scoring on another corner
kick This time it was
Rafalovich assisting Doug
