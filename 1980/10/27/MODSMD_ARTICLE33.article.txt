Iraqi missiles hit Dezful
Beirut, Lebanon — Five Soviet-made missiles smashed
into Iran's main army garrison at Dezful in southern Iran
on Sunday, killing as many as 100 people. Iran said. It was
the second reported Iraqi missile attack in the 35-day Per
sian Gulf war
Iran's of ficial news agency Pars said Iraq fired five sur
face-to-surface Frog-7 missiles into residential areas of
Dezful shortly after midnight. The Frog-7 has a range of
about 37 miles, just short of the distance from Iraq's
eastern border to the center of the city, which houses the
largest air base in the Middle Fast.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime said 180 Ira
nians were killed and 300 injured in the previous attack on
Dezful three weeks ago.
Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. who was named
chairman of the nation's Supreme Defense Council on Sat
urday. went to Dezful on Sunday with Hojatoleslam
Khameni. a religious leader who represents Khomeini on
the defense council. Tehran radio reported.
Dezful is located on a key juncture of highway, railway
and pipeline networks that connect Iran's southwestern
oil-producing regions with Tehran, the capital.
Tehran radio said Majlis (Iranian Parliament) speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani condemned the attack on Dezful and
linked it to debate on the hostages.
Diablo Canyon hearings end
San Luis Obispo — After six days of conflicting testi
mony, hearings on the earthquake safety of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plant have ended with opponents
doubtful of the outcome.
The Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board closed
its hearings Saturday. The earthquake safety of the nearly
completed $2 billion plant, with the offshore Hosgri quake
fault three miles away, was called into question last year.
Anti-nuclear groups, joined by Gov. Jerry Brown, ap
pealed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision
last October that the Diablo Canyon plant was earthquake
safe.
Two weeks after the NRC decision an earthquake meas
uring 6.5 on the Richter scale hit the Imperial Valley,
some 300 miles to the southeast. It caused $18 million in
damages.
The nuclear plant opponents said in their challenge that
the Imperial Valley quake was far more destructive than
believed possible, and that the Hosgri fault could also
cause such a quake
The board indicated it would issue its decision in late
February or March. Washington DC. attorney David
Fleischaker. who is representing the anti-nuclear in
terveners. said he will appeal an adverse decision to the
full Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Urban riot control report released
Washington — A federally financed study prompted by
the Miami racial riot this year concludes that police of
ficials around the country are ill-trained for urban riots,
mistakenly believe such riots are a thing of the past and
should switch more emphasis to preventing them than
simply controlling them.
It says that in a time of reduced payrolls one of the best
resources often overlooked was the patrol officer, who the

researchers said should be encouraged and rewarded for
making individual contacts with as many residents of trou
bled areas as possible
The report. "Prevention and Control of Urban Dis
orders.'' concluded that because of poor economic condi
tions. high unemployment among inner city residents and
news media attention to alleged police abuses, "the poten
tial for disorder is probably as great as ever."
The report urged police executives to go beyond the
community relations programs that were born during the
last major wave of urban rioting in America during the
l%os. It said the most important element in an effort to
prevent riots would be "a commitment by the police ad
ministrator to share power with the community" for
maintaining order and setting police priorities.
The report found these most common police responses
to escalating racial tension:
—Do nothing "Doing nothing is usually the worst
course of action." the report said.
—Issue defensive denials of charges made against the
police only to be confronted later with evidence of some
type of police error.
—Increase visible police patrols, which the report said
"may trigger a wider disorder'' unless coordinated with a
policy of sharing responsibility with the community for
maintaining order.
Among other things, the report recommended that po
lice:
—Increase their information about tension levels,
without creating surveillance programs that infringe on
constitutional rights.
—Regularly report any trends in tension levels with
neighborhood citizen organizations, government officials
and the news media.
Cranston, Gann debate on Salt II
Burbank — The second and apparently last televised de
bate between U.S. Sen Alan Cranston and Paul Gann. his
Republican opponent, produced a gentlemanly rehash of
their differences over the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty Saturday.
Gann said the SALT II agreement would concede mili
tarv superiority to the Soviet Union, while Cranston called
ratification of the treaty "the No. 1 item on my agenda"
because it could prevent a nuclear holocaust.
The two candidates met in a session taped for airing at 6
p.m. today on KNBC's "News Conference" program.
Gann. who at 68 is making his first bid for public office,
contended SALT I enabled the Soviet Union "to catch up
with us" in military armament and that SALT II would
give the Soviets a decided advantage.
"You do not negotiate a favorable treaty from
weakness." he said.
He said the Soviet Union "is outbuilding us every day,"
adding battleships, tanks and submarines, and he insisted
that the United States must expand its arsenal of conven
tional weapons and negotiate from strength.
I don't think you can solve military problems by throw
ing money at them." replied Cranston. 64. who is seeking
his third term in the Senate.
He said that such problems as inflation, energy, crime,
housing and human and women's rights are important and
then asked: How important are human and women's
rights if there are no human beings or women around?"

Atlanta searches for victims
Atlanta — In a city anguished by the unsolved murders
of 10 black children, with four others missing, weekend
searches for bodies have become crusades joined by
thousands of grim volunteers thrashing through bramble
thickets and kudzu vines, peering into sewers and poking
through derelict buildings.
Again Saturday 3,000 people with walking sticks and
weed-chopping tools filed into the cafeteria of the Charles
Drew School to be assigned an area to hunt for two boys
missing in the neighborhood
The first such search on Oct. 18 turned up the rotted re
mains of 7-year-old Latonya Wilson in the Dixie Hills com
munity. just five blocks from where she had been abducted
from her home five months earlier. That brought out four
times as many seachers this Saturday to hunt for two boys
ages 10 and 11 — missing in the East Lake Meadows
community of southeast Atlanta.
KKK holds Pennsylvania rally
New Geneva, Penn. — Bearing a microphone and
backed by a burning cross, Ku Klux Klan leader Bill
Wilkinson has brought the Klan's racist message to rural
Pennsylvania, a message he believes will sweep the
Northern states.
Wilkinson, a former electrical contractor from Louisi
ana who now leads the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan. stood on the back of a pickup truck and railed
against integration, forced busing, affirmative action pro
grams and U.S. acceptance of refugees.
After the speech. Wilkinson traded his three-piece suit
for a white robe with a dragon embroidered on the back to
lead about 30 other robed, torch-bearing Klansmen in
lighting the cross.

The Pennsylvania rally, the first open, major Klan re
cruiting event in the state in at least 30 years, was con
demned by labor, civil rights, religious and political lead
ers who met in protest about 20 miles away in Uniontown
Iran may be getting Israeli parts
Chicago — Israel has been sending war-torn Iran spare
parts for its U S -supplied K-4 combat aircraft, with the
knowledge of the Carter administration, according to a re
port published in yesterday's editions of the Chicago Sun-
Times.
The administration has known for at least two weeks
that the spare parts have been moving to Iran via the Neth
erlands. nationally syndicated columnists Rowland Evans
and Robert Novak wrote
The columnists said the movement of the military
equipment "has a major bearing" on Iran's "apparently
imminent decision to free" the U.S. hostages being held by
militants there.
They did not identify the sources for their story except
to say some of the information came from unnamed Carter
administration officials.
Evans and Novak said the military hardware, taken
from Israel's "U.S.-supplied stockpiles," included tires
and avionic and electronic equipment "needed to keep
Iran's air force flying" in its war with Iraq.
The columnists said Carter administration officials will
not say whether the United States or Israel originated the
airlift idea.

Atlanta searches for victims
Atlanta — In a city anguished by the unsolved murders
of 10 black children, with four others missing, weekend
searches for bodies have become crusades joined by
thousands of grim volunteers thrashing through bramble
thickets and kudzu vines, peering into sewers and poking
through derelict buildings.
Again Saturday 3,000 people with walking sticks and
weed-chopping tools filed into the cafeteria of the Charles
Drew School to be assigned an area to hunt for two boys
missing in the neighborhood
The first such search on Oct. 18 turned up the rotted re
mains of 7-year-old Latonya Wilson in the Dixie Hills com
munity. just five blocks from where she had been abducted
from her home five months earlier. That brought out four
times as many seachers this Saturday to hunt for two boys
ages 10 and 11 — missing in the East Lake Meadows

Iraqi missiles hit Dezful
Beirut, Lebanon — Five Soviet-made missiles smashed
into Iran's main army garrison at Dezful in southern Iran
on Sunday, killing as many as 100 people. Iran said. It was
the second reported Iraqi missile attack in the 35-day Per
sian Gulf war
Iran's of ficial news agency Pars said Iraq fired five sur
face-to-surface Frog-7 missiles into residential areas of
Dezful shortly after midnight. The Frog-7 has a range of
about 37 miles, just short of the distance from Iraq's
eastern border to the center of the city, which houses the
largest air base in the Middle Fast.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime said 180 Ira
nians were killed and 300 injured in the previous attack on
Dezful three weeks ago.
Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. who was named
chairman of the nation's Supreme Defense Council on Sat
urday. went to Dezful on Sunday with Hojatoleslam
Khameni. a religious leader who represents Khomeini on
the defense council. Tehran radio reported.
Dezful is located on a key juncture of highway, railway
and pipeline networks that connect Iran's southwestern
oil-producing regions with Tehran, the capital.
Tehran radio said Majlis (Iranian Parliament) speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani condemned the attack on Dezful and
linked it to debate on the hostages.
Diablo Canyon hearings end
San Luis Obispo — After six days of conflicting testi
mony, hearings on the earthquake safety of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plant have ended with opponents
doubtful of the outcome.
The Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board closed
its hearings Saturday. The earthquake safety of the nearly
completed $2 billion plant, with the offshore Hosgri quake
fault three miles away, was called into question last year.
Anti-nuclear groups, joined by Gov. Jerry Brown, ap
pealed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision
last October that the Diablo Canyon plant was earthquake
safe.
Two weeks after the NRC decision an earthquake meas
uring 6.5 on the Richter scale hit the Imperial Valley,
some 300 miles to the southeast. It caused $18 million in
damages.
The nuclear plant opponents said in their challenge that
the Imperial Valley quake was far more destructive than
believed possible, and that the Hosgri fault could also
cause such a quake
The board indicated it would issue its decision in late
February or March. Washington DC. attorney David
Fleischaker. who is representing the anti-nuclear in
terveners. said he will appeal an adverse decision to the
full Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Urban riot control report released
Washington — A federally financed study prompted by
the Miami racial riot this year concludes that police of
ficials around the country are ill-trained for urban riots,
mistakenly believe such riots are a thing of the past and
should switch more emphasis to preventing them than
simply controlling them.
It says that in a time of reduced payrolls one of the best
resources often overlooked was the patrol officer, who the

researchers said should be encouraged and rewarded for
making individual contacts with as many residents of trou
bled areas as possible
The report. "Prevention and Control of Urban Dis
orders.'' concluded that because of poor economic condi
tions. high unemployment among inner city residents and
news media attention to alleged police abuses, "the poten
tial for disorder is probably as great as ever."
The report urged police executives to go beyond the
community relations programs that were born during the
last major wave of urban rioting in America during the
l%os. It said the most important element in an effort to
prevent riots would be "a commitment by the police ad
ministrator to share power with the community" for
maintaining order and setting police priorities.
The report found these most common police responses
to escalating racial tension:
—Do nothing "Doing nothing is usually the worst
course of action." the report said.
—Issue defensive denials of charges made against the
police only to be confronted later with evidence of some
type of police error.
—Increase visible police patrols, which the report said
"may trigger a wider disorder'' unless coordinated with a
policy of sharing responsibility with the community for
maintaining order.
Among other things, the report recommended that po
lice:
—Increase their information about tension levels,
without creating surveillance programs that infringe on
constitutional rights.
—Regularly report any trends in tension levels with
neighborhood citizen organizations, government officials
and the news media.
Cranston, Gann debate on Salt II
Burbank — The second and apparently last televised de

Republican opponent, produced a gentlemanly rehash of
their differences over the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty Saturday.
Gann said the SALT II agreement would concede mili
tarv superiority to the Soviet Union, while Cranston called
ratification of the treaty "the No. 1 item on my agenda"
because it could prevent a nuclear holocaust.
The two candidates met in a session taped for airing at 6
p.m. today on KNBC's "News Conference" program.
Gann. who at 68 is making his first bid for public office,
contended SALT I enabled the Soviet Union "to catch up

give the Soviets a decided advantage.
"You do not negotiate a favorable treaty from

mony, hearings on the earthquake safety of the Diablo
Canyon nuclear power plant have ended with opponents
doubtful of the outcome.
The Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board closed
its hearings Saturday. The earthquake safety of the nearly
completed $2 billion plant, with the offshore Hosgri quake
fault three miles away, was called into question last year.
Anti-nuclear groups, joined by Gov. Jerry Brown, ap
pealed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's decision
last October that the Diablo Canyon plant was earthquake
safe.
Two weeks after the NRC decision an earthquake meas
uring 6.5 on the Richter scale hit the Imperial Valley,
some 300 miles to the southeast. It caused $18 million in
damages.
The nuclear plant opponents said in their challenge that
the Imperial Valley quake was far more destructive than
believed possible, and that the Hosgri fault could also
cause such a quake
The board indicated it would issue its decision in late
February or March. Washington DC. attorney David
Fleischaker. who is representing the anti-nuclear in
terveners. said he will appeal an adverse decision to the
full Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
Urban riot control report released
Washington — A federally financed study prompted by
the Miami racial riot this year concludes that police of
ficials around the country are ill-trained for urban riots,
mistakenly believe such riots are a thing of the past and
should switch more emphasis to preventing them than
simply controlling them.
It says that in a time of reduced payrolls one of the best
resources often overlooked was the patrol officer, who the

researchers said should be encouraged and rewarded for
making individual contacts with as many residents of trou
bled areas as possible
The report. "Prevention and Control of Urban Dis
orders.'' concluded that because of poor economic condi
tions. high unemployment among inner city residents and
news media attention to alleged police abuses, "the poten
tial for disorder is probably as great as ever."
The report urged police executives to go beyond the
community relations programs that were born during the
last major wave of urban rioting in America during the
l%os. It said the most important element in an effort to
prevent riots would be "a commitment by the police ad
ministrator to share power with the community" for
maintaining order and setting police priorities.
The report found these most common police responses
to escalating racial tension:
—Do nothing "Doing nothing is usually the worst
course of action." the report said.
—Issue defensive denials of charges made against the
police only to be confronted later with evidence of some
type of police error.
—Increase visible police patrols, which the report said
"may trigger a wider disorder'' unless coordinated with a
policy of sharing responsibility with the community for
maintaining order.
Among other things, the report recommended that po
lice:
—Increase their information about tension levels,
without creating surveillance programs that infringe on
constitutional rights.
—Regularly report any trends in tension levels with
neighborhood citizen organizations, government officials
and the news media.
Cranston, Gann debate on Salt II
Burbank — The second and apparently last televised de
bate between U.S. Sen Alan Cranston and Paul Gann. his
Republican opponent, produced a gentlemanly rehash of
their differences over the Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty Saturday.
Gann said the SALT II agreement would concede mili
tarv superiority to the Soviet Union, while Cranston called
ratification of the treaty "the No. 1 item on my agenda"
because it could prevent a nuclear holocaust.
The two candidates met in a session taped for airing at 6
p.m. today on KNBC's "News Conference" program.
Gann. who at 68 is making his first bid for public office,
contended SALT I enabled the Soviet Union "to catch up
with us" in military armament and that SALT II would
give the Soviets a decided advantage.
"You do not negotiate a favorable treaty from
weakness." he said.
He said the Soviet Union "is outbuilding us every day,"
adding battleships, tanks and submarines, and he insisted
that the United States must expand its arsenal of conven
tional weapons and negotiate from strength.
I don't think you can solve military problems by throw
ing money at them." replied Cranston. 64. who is seeking
his third term in the Senate.
He said that such problems as inflation, energy, crime,
housing and human and women's rights are important and
then asked: How important are human and women's
rights if there are no human beings or women around?"

Atlanta searches for victims
Atlanta — In a city anguished by the unsolved murders
of 10 black children, with four others missing, weekend
searches for bodies have become crusades joined by
thousands of grim volunteers thrashing through bramble
thickets and kudzu vines, peering into sewers and poking
through derelict buildings.
Again Saturday 3,000 people with walking sticks and
weed-chopping tools filed into the cafeteria of the Charles
Drew School to be assigned an area to hunt for two boys
missing in the neighborhood
The first such search on Oct. 18 turned up the rotted re
mains of 7-year-old Latonya Wilson in the Dixie Hills com
munity. just five blocks from where she had been abducted
from her home five months earlier. That brought out four
times as many seachers this Saturday to hunt for two boys
ages 10 and 11 — missing in the East Lake Meadows
community of southeast Atlanta.
KKK holds Pennsylvania rally
New Geneva, Penn. — Bearing a microphone and
backed by a burning cross, Ku Klux Klan leader Bill
Wilkinson has brought the Klan's racist message to rural
Pennsylvania, a message he believes will sweep the
Northern states.
Wilkinson, a former electrical contractor from Louisi
ana who now leads the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan. stood on the back of a pickup truck and railed
against integration, forced busing, affirmative action pro
grams and U.S. acceptance of refugees.
After the speech. Wilkinson traded his three-piece suit
for a white robe with a dragon embroidered on the back to
lead about 30 other robed, torch-bearing Klansmen in
lighting the cross.

The Pennsylvania rally, the first open, major Klan re
cruiting event in the state in at least 30 years, was con
demned by labor, civil rights, religious and political lead
ers who met in protest about 20 miles away in Uniontown
Iran may be getting Israeli parts
Chicago — Israel has been sending war-torn Iran spare
parts for its U S -supplied K-4 combat aircraft, with the
knowledge of the Carter administration, according to a re
port published in yesterday's editions of the Chicago Sun-
Times.
The administration has known for at least two weeks
that the spare parts have been moving to Iran via the Neth
erlands. nationally syndicated columnists Rowland Evans
and Robert Novak wrote
The columnists said the movement of the military
equipment "has a major bearing" on Iran's "apparently
imminent decision to free" the U.S. hostages being held by
militants there.
They did not identify the sources for their story except
to say some of the information came from unnamed Carter
administration officials.
Evans and Novak said the military hardware, taken
from Israel's "U.S.-supplied stockpiles," included tires
and avionic and electronic equipment "needed to keep
Iran's air force flying" in its war with Iraq.
The columnists said Carter administration officials will
not say whether the United States or Israel originated the
airlift idea.

Iraqi missiles hit Dezful
Beirut, Lebanon — Five Soviet-made missiles smashed
into Iran's main army garrison at Dezful in southern Iran
on Sunday, killing as many as 100 people. Iran said. It was
the second reported Iraqi missile attack in the 35-day Per
sian Gulf war
Iran's of ficial news agency Pars said Iraq fired five sur
face-to-surface Frog-7 missiles into residential areas of
Dezful shortly after midnight. The Frog-7 has a range of
about 37 miles, just short of the distance from Iraq's
eastern border to the center of the city, which houses the
largest air base in the Middle Fast.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime said 180 Ira
nians were killed and 300 injured in the previous attack on
Dezful three weeks ago.
Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. who was named
chairman of the nation's Supreme Defense Council on Sat
urday. went to Dezful on Sunday with Hojatoleslam
Khameni. a religious leader who represents Khomeini on
the defense council. Tehran radio reported.
Dezful is located on a key juncture of highway, railway
and pipeline networks that connect Iran's southwestern
oil-producing regions with Tehran, the capital.
Tehran radio said Majlis (Iranian Parliament) speaker
Hashemi Rafsanjani condemned the attack on Dezful and
linked it to debate on the hostages.
