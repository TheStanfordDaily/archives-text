# New aide seeks greater role for Chicano affairs

Chicano affairs will assume a larg
er role in the University's future, ac
cording to Fernando de Necochea.
De Necochea was recently ap
pointed assistant provost and adviser
to the president on Chicano affairs.
"I will see that Chicano matters get
the attention and importance they de
serve." he said.
During his first month in office, de
Necochea was impressed by the
strong sense of cultural identity
within the Chicano community.
Chicano ambivalence
"Many Chicano students here are
ambivalent in their feelings toward
Stanford." he said. "Their identity as
Chicano students means more to
them."
Casa Zapata, the Chicano theme
house in Stern Hall, plays an impor
tant part in keeping these cultural
ties. But de Necochea said he hopes
that in the future. Chicano cultural
events will be more integrated with
the outside community.
Good communication between the
Chicanos and other minorities is im
portant. De Necochea said it is not
always easy.
"I think minority groups perceive
that they have common problems but
their perception of priorities will
vary," he said.
Improving the Chicano students'
"quality of experience" at Stanford is
one immediate priority, he said.
The Chicano community —
about 700 students, faculty and staff —
has grown steadily in recent years.
But Stanford has experienced some
problems in keeping both graduates
and undergraduates here, de
Necochea said.
Working with the administration
and Movimento Estudiantil Chicano
de Aztlan (MEChAt, the Chicano stu
dent association, de Necochea plans to
expand academic support services
and career planning and counseling

for Chicano students This should re
duce the frustration and difficulties
Chicano students currently face, he
said.
Sees Chicano increase
De Necochea expects to see the
number of Chicano students here in
crease but would like to see some
changes in the Chicano recruitment
program.
Currently, most Chicano students
come from California and Texas but in
the future, de Necochea said greater
attention must be given to recruiting
Chicano students from the mid
western and south-western states.
Although Chicano enrollment has
increased in the graduate schools,
particularly in the law and medical
schools, de Necochea said continued
support for a policy of affirmative ac
tion is essential. It gives Chicanos ac
cess to all graduate schools, he said.
Stanford has a responsibility to lead
the nation in regard to Chicano educa
tion if only because of its location, de
Necochea said. California's Chicano
population is the highest in the coun
try.
The University compares favorably
with other schools but "the challenge
is to make pre-eminent.'' he said.
Only three of nine Chicano faculty
members have gained tenure at the
University, de Necochea said
"The future of Chicano research
and teaching depends on their getting
tenure and on recruitment. If Stanford
has a good record in promoting
Chicano faculty, that would be an ad
vantage in our efforts to compete for
and attract top faculty and graduate
students."
De Necochea was appointed on the
recommendation of a search commit
tee which included Chicano faculty,
staff and students. He comes to Stan
ford from UC-Santa Barbara where he
served for 10 years as associate direc
tor of the Research Center for Chicano
Studies.
