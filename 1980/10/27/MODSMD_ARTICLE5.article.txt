# Former Ford aide says voters choose presidents based on trust, not issues
## 
### Debbie Walker 
Issues have never been a decisive factor in presidential
elections, according to Robert Hartmann, former chief of
staff under President Gerald Ford.
"The grant issues largely exist in the minds of editorial
writers and special interest groups," Hartmann said in a
recent phone interview. "Economy and foreign policy can
sometimes be factors, but the basic issue turns on the
question of confidence and credibility â€” whether people
trust an individual to make decisions that are prudent and
wise."
A senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution.
Hartmann will speak at Bishop Auditorium tonight at 7 .30,
covering such subjects as the upcoming presidential de
bates and his recently published book entitled Palace Poli
tics.
Hartmann graduated from Stanford in 1938 and was a
newspaper journalist for 25 years before getting political
ly involved.
Hartmann became chief of the Los Angeles Times's
Washington Bureau in 1954. He met Ford in the '50s when
the future president was first running for Congress.

"I had been covering Washington and political matters
for 10 years," Hartmann said. "In fact I had been covering
many of the people I later went to work for." He said the
transition from newspaper work to government affairs
was not a difficult one.
In 1965 Hartmann joined Ford as a principal assistant
and remained so until the Ford administration left the
White House in 1977.
Hartmann was Ford's first official appointee.
Hartmann describes the chief of staff as "a position which
had cabinet rank but unfortunately did not include cabinet
pay," according to Hartmann.
Since departing the White House, he has been working
on Palace Politics, a book about the influence held by the
president's personal staff.
Asked who he intends to vote for in the coming presiden
tial election, Hartmann revealed that he has already voted
for Ronald Reagan via an absentee ballot.
"It's not that I'm madly enthusiastic (for Reagan) or
just because I'm a Republican, but because I feel it is nec
essary to have a change in our leadership," Hartmann
said.
