demned the Iraqi rocketing of the Ira
nian city of Dezful. where Tehran said
at least 64 civilians were killed early
yesterday by Soviet-made surface-to
surface missiles.
Directing his words to the foreign
press. Rafsanjani said "You should
pay attention to these important
events happening in the region with
the incitement of the same super
power whose hostages will be dis
cussed in the session today."
Private debate
The 181 deputies on hand for the ses
sion then privately debated the
hostage issue for about two hours and
15 minutes before adjourning. They
reportedly heard a report from a sev
en-member committee that drew up
recommendations on the conditions
that Iran should set for the release of
the hostages.
At the end of the meeting, members
of Parliament contacted by telephone
from The Associated Press office in
Beirut. Lebanon, said a second secret
session would be held today.
One deputy. Moosavi Tabrizi. said it
might take a "week or 10 days" to de
cide the hostages issue, apparently
dashing hopes the captives would be
released very soon. Tabrizi said the
hostage debate, scheduled to have
been public, was done privately for
"security reasons."
Rafsanjam's secretary, identified
only as Mr. Zamani. repeated in a tele
phone interview Iranian claims that
the United States was helping Iraq in
the Persian Gulf war. He cited Wash
ington's deployment of sophisticated
radar planes in Saudi Arabia and U.S.
arms deals with Jordan, which is aid
ing the Iraqi war effort.
Iranian Prime Minister Moham
mad Ali Rajai earlier accused the

I'nited States of passing on to Bagh
dad information gathered by the radar
planes He also claimed "Iraq is mov
ing in line with America."
Asked if a perception that Washing
ton was helping Iraq had influenced
the deputies and prompted a delay.
Zamani responded. "Yes. it is one of
the reasons.''
Mohammad Mohammadi. a deputy
representing the Struggling Moslem
Movement, closely linked with the
militants who captured the Ameri
cans nearly a year ago. said his sup
porters would try to prolong the
hostage debate. In a telephone in
terview. Mohammadi characterized
yesterday's session as contentious,
with little common ground among op
posing factions.
Motion to put off for good
Kightv-seven lawmakers voted for
a motion to postpone the hostage de
bate indefinitely, pending develop
ments in the Iran-Iraq war. The pro
posal was defeated, but the vote in
dicated there is a considerable faction
that gives the hostage issue low priori
ty.
Many deputies pointed to the galler
ies jammed with foreign reporters
and asked why the Majlis should be
concerned with the fate of 52 Ameri
cans when hundreds of Iranians were
being killed in the war.
Tabrizi rejected reports from the
United States that suggested the
hostages would be released as early as
next Thursday. "No." he said simply.
A top Iranian diplomat at the United
Nations was quoted by CBS News ear
ly yesterday as saying at least some of
the hostages could be released by
Thursday at the latest.
Anonymity desired
There was some speculation that
members of Parliament wanted the
debate held in private so that none
could be individually associated with a
decision that might lead to the
hostages' release.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Iran's revolutionary leader, said in
September that the terms for freeing
the hostages included release of Ira
nian assets frozen in the United
States, the return of the late shah's
fortune, withdrawal of lawsuits
against Iran over broken contracts,
and a U.S. pledge of non-interference
in Iranian affairs.
Speculation about new conditions
included possible insistence on re
moval of the four U.S. radar warning
and command planes from Saudi Ara
bia. resumption of supplies of military
spare parts to Iran and a pledge that
Washington would stop alleged aid to
Iraq.
