Seldom does a dorm activity com
bine safety and socializing. However,
SECURE. Cedro's new intradorm es
cort service, has done just that.
SECURE stands for "Students En
gaged in Cedro's Upholding of Rape
Elimination." The motive behind SE
CURE is to "prevent incidents so we
don't have to have a rape or an attack
to wake up to the fact that we have to
take care of ourselves as a dorm,"
said Tracey Minkin, a Cedro RA.
SURE promotion
According to Minkin, the idea of an
intradorm escort service was sug
gested to her as a dorm activity bv Vic
Menon. Menon is director of Students
United for Rape Elimination (SURE).
Minkin stresses that SECURE, as
an intradorm operation, is not in com

petition with SURE escort service,
which is available to all Stanford stu
dents.
After discussing the idea of a dorm
escort service with the rest of the
house staff. Minkin decided to present
the idea to the dorm at its first house
meeting. Minkin said the dorm re
sponse was overwhelming. "I barely
had to mention it and they burst into
applause," she said.
SECURE was organized by Cedro
resident Lvle Wiedeman and began
service two weeks ago. The escort ser
vice is currently composed of 23 male
student escorts. In selecting the es
corts Minkin said, "we made it (the
job) unattractive so that people
wouldn't sign up just because they
thought it was a cool idea . . . it's a
commitment."
Weekly operation
SECURE operates from 8 p.m. to 6
a m. all week long. Each escort has a
shift of 4 1 2 hours on weekdays and two
hours on weekends. There are two or
three escorts on duty each shift plus
several backups. A printed schedule of
the escorts' phone numbers and their
shifts was passed out to the students in
the dorm In order to obtain an escort,
a student directly calls any escort
available during that shift. Service is
available anywhere on campus.
SECURE may be modified after an
evaluation is made of its first month of
operation. Minkin said.
In contrast with SURE escort ser
vice. Minkin said that SECURE, as a
dorm activity, provides the chance for
Cedro residents to have a "nice little
chat" with a dormmate with whom
they might be unfamiliar SECURE
also promotes trust among Cedro stu
dents, she said. "It's nice to know that
everyone cares about everyone else."
"We're trying to make people
aware that even though this is the
Stanford campus it's still the real
world with real people . real prob
lems."
