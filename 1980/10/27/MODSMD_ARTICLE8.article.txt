## Improved U.S.-Iran ties may help UN move on war 
### Washington Post 
United Nations — A U.S. stand seen as increas
ingly friendly to Iran, expressed publicly and in
private consultations here, has heartened Iranian
diplomats and raised their hopes of ending the
Persian Gulf war through the U.N. Security Coun
cil.
But the diplomats quickly add that, back home
in Tehran, they face an accumulation of mistrust
and antipathy toward the United States and the
West that will make their efforts to sell even a
good U.N.-sponsored bargain extremely difficult.
For that reason, the increased interest in U.N.
proceedings manifested here by delegation chief
Ali Shams Ardekani and his deputies in the last
week does not necessarily reflect similar interest
among all the competing centers of power in
Tehran, diplomats caution.
The delegation's attitude nevertheless is
viewed as particularly significant against the
background of growing hopes within the Carter
administration that Tehran will decide soon to re
lease the American hostages to end its isolation
and open the way for U.N. help in reversing its
losses in the month-old conflict with Iraq
A "positive'' step from the Security Council —
particularly if the United States helps bring it
about — would go a long way toward convincing
Islamic hard-liners in Tehran that Iran can bene
fit from participation in U.N. deliberations and
release of the hostages is a good idea, an Iranian
diplomat here explained.
Although hard information on Iranian decision
making is sketchv. some diplomats here say
Ardekani and his delegation represent mostly the
relatively conciliatory attitude of President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. As a result, they cannot
speak with authority for Prime Minister
Mohammed Ali Rajai and. even less, for the hard
line clergymen and ultimately Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, whose influence would be de
cisive in accepting a Security Council proposal or
a deal for release of the hostages, these sources
suggest.
Blurred distinctions
The U.S. mission to the United Nations under
Ambassador Donald McHenry has taken these im
ponderables into account in its contacts aimed at
fostering a cease-fire resolution acceptable to
Iran and Iraq, as well as in its reporting on the
hostage issue, diplomats say But in the political
atmosphere of Washington and in the press with
its need to simplify, the distinctions sometimes
blur, they add.
Iranian diplomats here, however, are painfully
aware of their limited mandate. "This is our busi
ness: we understand, because we are diplomats."

said one But vou know, in Tehran, there has
been such mistrust for the last 18 months. ..."
Even so. the administration's warnings against
dismemberment of Iran and its support of a cease
tire coupled with calls for Iraqi withdrawal from
Iranian territory have largely paralleled Iranian
positions, drawing approval from the Iranian
diplomats and improving their case against the
doubters in Tehran
Well. yes. He called the ( Iraqi) invasion an in
vasion.' Ardekani replied to a question whether
he approved of McHenrv's speech Thursday night
before the Security Council.
Little hope
But diplomats hold out little hope anything can
be resolved in the next few days. The countries in
volved — chiefly Bangladesh. Norway and Paki
stan. with the United States in the background for
the time being — are being specially cautious to
prevent repetition of the Sept. 28 cease-fire appeal
that was ignored because Iran had boycotted the
proceedings that led to it.
To avoid another embarrassment. Iran and
Iraq are to be involved as the resolution takes
shape in coming days in an attempt to guarantee
their acceptance before it is voted on. diplomats
said. In addition, extra time is required because of
parallel and in some ways competitive mediation
efforts by the Islamic Conference and the non
aligned group. Finally, the possibility of a hostage
release so overshadows the proceedings that
some of the delay is inevitable the diplomats here
watch what Tehran decides.
In any case, contacts so far remain limited to
poorly defined ideas that would constitute the
backbone of an eventual resolution, according to
diplomats involved in the talks. These revolve at
this stage around a phased withdrawal coupled
with an internationally supervised cease-fire and
negotiations over territorial disputes including
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway,
they said.
Another element, the only Iraqi position backed
by the United States, probably will be an appeal
for noninterference by Iraq and Iran in each oth
er's internal affairs. This would be in response to
Iraqi charges that Khomeini's Islamic revolution
is sponsoring dissent by Shiite Moslems in Iraq
and other Sunni-dominated countries along the
Persian Gulf.
His comment also reflected Iraqi demands that
the U.N. resolution not be limited to halting the
fighting and organizing a troop withdrawal
without also addressing Iraq's demand for sov
ereignty over the entire Shatt al-Arab. the only
Iraqi outlet to the sea and a vital route for its oil
exports into the gulf.

this stage around a phased withdrawal coupled
with an internationally supervised cease-fire and
negotiations over territorial disputes including
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway,
they said.
Another element, the only Iraqi position backed
by the United States, probably will be an appeal
for noninterference by Iraq and Iran in each oth
er's internal affairs. This would be in response to
Iraqi charges that Khomeini's Islamic revolution
is sponsoring dissent by Shiite Moslems in Iraq
and other Sunni-dominated countries along the
Persian Gulf.
His comment also reflected Iraqi demands that
the U.N. resolution not be limited to halting the
fighting and organizing a troop withdrawal
without also addressing Iraq's demand for sov
ereignty over the entire Shatt al-Arab. the only
Iraqi outlet to the sea and a vital route for its oil
exports into the gulf.
United Nations — A U.S. stand seen as increas
ingly friendly to Iran, expressed publicly and in
private consultations here, has heartened Iranian
diplomats and raised their hopes of ending the
Persian Gulf war through the U.N. Security Coun
cil.
But the diplomats quickly add that, back home
in Tehran, they face an accumulation of mistrust
and antipathy toward the United States and the
West that will make their efforts to sell even a
good U.N.-sponsored bargain extremely difficult.
For that reason, the increased interest in U.N.
proceedings manifested here by delegation chief
Ali Shams Ardekani and his deputies in the last
week does not necessarily reflect similar interest
among all the competing centers of power in
Tehran, diplomats caution.
The delegation's attitude nevertheless is
viewed as particularly significant against the
background of growing hopes within the Carter
administration that Tehran will decide soon to re
lease the American hostages to end its isolation
and open the way for U.N. help in reversing its
losses in the month-old conflict with Iraq
A "positive'' step from the Security Council —
particularly if the United States helps bring it
about — would go a long way toward convincing
Islamic hard-liners in Tehran that Iran can bene
fit from participation in U.N. deliberations and
release of the hostages is a good idea, an Iranian
diplomat here explained.
Although hard information on Iranian decision
making is sketchv. some diplomats here say
Ardekani and his delegation represent mostly the
relatively conciliatory attitude of President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. As a result, they cannot
speak with authority for Prime Minister
Mohammed Ali Rajai and. even less, for the hard
line clergymen and ultimately Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, whose influence would be de
cisive in accepting a Security Council proposal or
a deal for release of the hostages, these sources
suggest.
Blurred distinctions
The U.S. mission to the United Nations under
Ambassador Donald McHenry has taken these im
ponderables into account in its contacts aimed at
fostering a cease-fire resolution acceptable to
Iran and Iraq, as well as in its reporting on the
hostage issue, diplomats say But in the political
atmosphere of Washington and in the press with
its need to simplify, the distinctions sometimes
blur, they add.
Iranian diplomats here, however, are painfully
aware of their limited mandate. "This is our busi
ness: we understand, because we are diplomats."

been such mistrust for the last 18 months. ..."
Even so. the administration's warnings against
dismemberment of Iran and its support of a cease
tire coupled with calls for Iraqi withdrawal from
Iranian territory have largely paralleled Iranian
positions, drawing approval from the Iranian
diplomats and improving their case against the
doubters in Tehran
Well. yes. He called the ( Iraqi) invasion an in
vasion.' Ardekani replied to a question whether
he approved of McHenrv's speech Thursday night
before the Security Council.
Little hope
But diplomats hold out little hope anything can
be resolved in the next few days. The countries in
volved — chiefly Bangladesh. Norway and Paki
stan. with the United States in the background for
the time being — are being specially cautious to
prevent repetition of the Sept. 28 cease-fire appeal
that was ignored because Iran had boycotted the
proceedings that led to it.
To avoid another embarrassment. Iran and
Iraq are to be involved as the resolution takes
shape in coming days in an attempt to guarantee
their acceptance before it is voted on. diplomats
said. In addition, extra time is required because of
parallel and in some ways competitive mediation
efforts by the Islamic Conference and the non
aligned group. Finally, the possibility of a hostage
release so overshadows the proceedings that
some of the delay is inevitable the diplomats here
watch what Tehran decides.
In any case, contacts so far remain limited to
poorly defined ideas that would constitute the
backbone of an eventual resolution, according to
diplomats involved in the talks. These revolve at
