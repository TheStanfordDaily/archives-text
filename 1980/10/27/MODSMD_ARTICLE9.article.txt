# Philippines stop nukes, use geothermal

### Los Angeles Times 
Manila, Philippines â€” Volcanoes are not
all bad. and Filipinos are learning that their
volcanoes can be. as one expert put it.
"more a benefactor than a malefactor.''
Volcano power or. more accurately,
geothermal power, now supplies the Philip
pines with 4.2 percent of its energy needs.
By 1985. if all goes well, the figure will be up
to 12.2 percent. Two years from now. the
Philippines is expected to surpass the Unit
ed States and become the world's leading
producer of geothermal power
Already this nation of more than 7000 is
lands is producing well over 500 megawatts
of geothermal power. < American capacity
for production of geothermal energy was 700
megawatts at the end of 1979. with most of it
being produced in California, i Some of the
electricity that lights this sprawling capital
of 7.5 million people comes from steam ris
ing from super-hot water in wells more than
5000 feet deep 40 miles southwest of Manila.

Fortunately for the Philippines in this era
of skyrocketing oil prices, the country sits
on a string of dormant and active volcanoes
whose subsurface seethes with intense pent
up heat.
Hit by rising oil prices
Along with other developing nations, the
Philippines has been grieviously wounded
by the rising cost of oil imported from the
Middle East. Last year oil imports cost the
Philippines $1.3 billion, and this year the
price will be stiffer. about $2.6 billion.
President Ferdinand Marcos has ordered
a multipronged effort to reduce his coun
try's dependence on imported oil through in
creased use of geothermal power,
hydropower. coal and nuclear power. Under
an accelerated five-year energy develop
ment program, the government plans to
spend nearly $1 billion during the first year.
This amounts to about 12 percent of the en
tire 1981 budget.
American experts give the Philippines

high marks for facing up to the energy
crunch. "Without making invidious com
parison," one U.S. specialist said, "I'd say
the Filipinos have been a lot more realistic
about coping with the crisis than we have at
home."
Gasoline sells for $2.56 a gallon in the
Philippines.
Cheaper than nukes
Filipinos have turned to geothermal
power with enthusiasm because it is cheap,
clean and relatively simple to produce.
They say it costs them half as much as nu
clear power and is 80 percent cheaper than
oil at last year's prices.
The government recently settled a 15-
month dispute with Westinghouse Electric
Corp. that had halted construction of the
Philippines' first nuclear power plant.
Marcos ordered construction stopped af
ter the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant accident in Pennsylvania, in March,
1979, to make sure that the plant was safe.
