## Candidates, economy discussed 
### Brian Sprague 
An audience of more than 120 heard
three top economic professors speak
on the "Economic Policies of the
Presidential Candidates" last night.
Business School Prof. George Bach
and two advisers to Republican can
didate Ronald Reagan — Hoover In
stitution senior fellow Thomas Moore
and Economics Prof. Michael Boskin
— spoke in the Meyer Forum Room.
"All the candidates have behaved
badlv in their economics." said Bach
He said he felt dismayed at what he
called each candidate's emphasis on
short- term economic proposals.
"It's a lot of nonsense to look at the
short term." he said. "The real issue
ought to be who has long-run sense in
stabilizing the economy."
He said the candidates "are for

getting everything that we learned in
Econ 1
Reagan 'sensible, foolish'
Reagan "savs something sensible
one day. then something foolish the
next day." said Bach While he didn't
praise Carter for a lack of foolish com
mentary. Bach said the president
"has more smart people backing him
up.
Bach said he was "pretty fed up
with the whole thing," but suggested
that rather than lingering on the de
tails of each candidate's platform,
voters ought to ask " what does the guy
stand for in general?"
He also emphasized the importance
of "making a judgement as to who
their advisers will be."
Moore, after making several politi
cal wisecracks, refrained from dis

cussing his stated preference. Liber
tarian candidate Ed Clark, and in
stead predicted what the two major
candidates' effects on energy and gov
ernment regulation would be.
Some progress
Moore said Carter "had made some
progress" in energy policy, but that
his policies have in effect "taxed our
own producers to subsidize imports.
It's no wonder we've reduced our
production." he said. "When you hold
down prices, you get shortages."
Moore said the underlying view of
Carter's economic policies is "that
supply curves for natural gas and oil
are almost completely inelastic; that
if you increase prices you don't in
crease output "
One crucial difference between
Carter and Reagan, said Moore, "is
their estimation of the elasticity of
this supply." He commended Reagan
for his belief that the supply curve for
energy is instead rather elastic.
Deregulation
Moore generally applauded
Carter's moves to deregulate the
transportation industry, specifically
the airline and trucking industries
"Carter can take pride in
it,"explained Moore, for deregulation
"has greatly benefited the industries
involved."
But Moore pointed out that Carter
has increased regulation in other in
dustries. Regulatory agencies such as
the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration have grown immense
ly. he said.
Reagan, on the other hand, will
"provide greater economic growth
by continuing the deregulation of in
dustry. as well as restricting govern
ment growth, said Moore Reagan will
alter environmental regulations to aid
industry and the economy, he added
Boskin emphasized the limits to
presidential power over the economy
"We can't expect a president to have a
short-term effect on the economy. The
president does not make the policies of
the United States. It's in the hands of
Congress."
He said voters ought to look not only
at the policies of the candidates, but
also "at their ability to get it through
Congress."
However, Boskin praised Carter for
his accelerated depreciation policy
for business yet rebuked him for in
terfering too much in the free market.
"Carter is not the kind of guv who will
wait around for the economy to im
prove. He's a tinkerer."
The evening's program was spon
sored by the Associated Students of
Stanford University Majoring in Eco
nomics.

An audience of more than 120 heard
three top economic professors speak
on the "Economic Policies of the
Presidential Candidates" last night.
Business School Prof. George Bach
and two advisers to Republican can
didate Ronald Reagan — Hoover In
stitution senior fellow Thomas Moore
and Economics Prof. Michael Boskin
— spoke in the Meyer Forum Room.
"All the candidates have behaved
badlv in their economics." said Bach
He said he felt dismayed at what he
called each candidate's emphasis on
short- term economic proposals.
"It's a lot of nonsense to look at the
short term." he said. "The real issue
ought to be who has long-run sense in
stabilizing the economy."
He said the candidates "are for

getting everything that we learned in
Econ 1
Reagan 'sensible, foolish'
Reagan "savs something sensible
one day. then something foolish the
next day." said Bach While he didn't
praise Carter for a lack of foolish com
mentary. Bach said the president
"has more smart people backing him
up.
Bach said he was "pretty fed up
with the whole thing," but suggested
that rather than lingering on the de
tails of each candidate's platform,
voters ought to ask " what does the guy
stand for in general?"
He also emphasized the importance
of "making a judgement as to who
their advisers will be."
Moore, after making several politi
cal wisecracks, refrained from dis

cussing his stated preference. Liber
tarian candidate Ed Clark, and in
stead predicted what the two major
candidates' effects on energy and gov
ernment regulation would be.
Some progress
Moore said Carter "had made some
progress" in energy policy, but that
his policies have in effect "taxed our
own producers to subsidize imports.
It's no wonder we've reduced our
production." he said. "When you hold
down prices, you get shortages."
Moore said the underlying view of
Carter's economic policies is "that
supply curves for natural gas and oil
are almost completely inelastic; that
if you increase prices you don't in
crease output "
One crucial difference between
Carter and Reagan, said Moore, "is
their estimation of the elasticity of
this supply." He commended Reagan
for his belief that the supply curve for
energy is instead rather elastic.
Deregulation
Moore generally applauded
Carter's moves to deregulate the
transportation industry, specifically
the airline and trucking industries
"Carter can take pride in
it,"explained Moore, for deregulation
"has greatly benefited the industries
involved."
But Moore pointed out that Carter
has increased regulation in other in
dustries. Regulatory agencies such as
the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration have grown immense
ly. he said.
Reagan, on the other hand, will
"provide greater economic growth
by continuing the deregulation of in
dustry. as well as restricting govern
ment growth, said Moore Reagan will
alter environmental regulations to aid
industry and the economy, he added
Boskin emphasized the limits to
presidential power over the economy
"We can't expect a president to have a
short-term effect on the economy. The
president does not make the policies of
the United States. It's in the hands of
Congress."
He said voters ought to look not only
at the policies of the candidates, but
also "at their ability to get it through
Congress."
However, Boskin praised Carter for
his accelerated depreciation policy
for business yet rebuked him for in
terfering too much in the free market.
"Carter is not the kind of guv who will
wait around for the economy to im
prove. He's a tinkerer."
