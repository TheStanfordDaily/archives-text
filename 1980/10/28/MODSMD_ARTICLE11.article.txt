### 
12th district McCloskey
Incumbent congressman Pete Mc-
Closkey has been an effective and valu
able representative of his 12th district
constituents over the past 14 years. His ex
perience. national stature and accessibili
ty. all make him the most qualified can
didate in this year's race.
McCloskey has been a strong supporter
of environmental protection and an active
proponent of conservation. He has called
for total deregulation of the oil industry to
make it profitable for the oil companies to
find new oil and to force prices up to cut
consumption.
McCloskey supports the Equal Rights
Amendment and the right for a woman to
choose freely to have an abortion. He also
supports federally funded abortions.
McCloskey has also called for the legal
ization of the flow of Mexican immigrants
into the United States, asserting that it
would be more intelligent to let in the
number needed to work here rather than
spend millions to keep them out.
However, a disturbing element of Mc-
Closkey's plan calls for every worker in
this country have a Social Security card
with both his picture and fingerprint on it.
Ostensibly, this card would make it easier
for federal officers to verify whether a
worker was legally employed and paying
social security and income taxes.
The Daily feels that the social security
proposal is an unnecessary infringement
upon personal liberties.
The Daily also disagrees strongly with
McCloskey's National Youth Service pro
posal that would require every high school
graduate to either serve in the military or
some other service capacity for the na
tion. While he has said that it would be a
more equitable system than a draft, which
would randomly select only a segment of
the male population for public service, we
feel that is a greater violation of personal
rights than even a draft would be.
The Daily commends McCloskey's Lib
ertarian challenger Bill Evers for conduc

ting a spirited and issues-oriented cam
paign and hopes he will be availible in the
future as a candidate.
1 1 th district Lantos
Once in aw hile a very special candidate
for political office comes along who is
both qualified and charismatic, with the
intelligence, vision and conviction
necessary to bring about positive change.
Tom Lantos. Democratic candidate for
Congress from the 11th district, is such a
man.
Lantos offers considerable experience
in international policy making. He was ap
pointed to a presidential task force on de
fense and foreign policy under President
Carter, and he has served as senior policy
advisor to U.S. Senators Frank Church
and Joseph Biden.
He has traveled extensively throughout
the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and
brought first-hand knowledge to his post
as commentator and foreign policy
analyst at KRON. KPIX and KQED tele
vision stations.
Lantos has taught as a professor of eco
nomics at San Francisco State University
since 1950. Utilizing his considerable ex
perience as an economist. Lantos pro
poses to implement legislation to ease the
housing shortage in San Mateo County, a
problem he sees approaching critical pro
portions.
In addition to his international achieve
ments. Lantos brings considerable ex
perience in government at the local level.
A 30-year resident of San Mateo County,
he served on the Millbrae Board of Educa
tion for eight years and was elected presi
dent for one term. He founded the San
Bruno Democratic Club and served as its
first president.
We feel that Lantos' experience in in
ternational economy, foreign policy and
government at the local level make him an
exciting candidate and a winner on Nov. 4.
The Daily is proud to endorse Tom Lantos
for Congress.
