## Saudi takeover distortion of freedom 
### 
1 couldn't believe Robert
Greenberg's column was seri
ous (Daily. Oct. 23>. His argu
ments for an American
takeover of Saudi Arabia were
reminiscent of those used to jus
tify the Vietnam War, reflecting
the same vacuous morality,
anti-communist myopia and
military mania.
Greenberg tells us that be
cause Russia does not provide
the "inalienable right of liberty
to its people." it is not justified
in invading Afghanistan. But a
U.S. takeover of Saudi Arabia is
quite alright, presumably be
cause we have a Bill of Rights.
No matter that in this takeover
we deny the people of Saudi Ara
bia this very freedom from
domination.
GNP growth
Another inalienable right for
Americans seems to be our
right to consume 40 percent of
the world's resources including
30 percent of the world's annual
oil production for the sake of the
gross national product.
Greenberg claims a rigid link
between energy consumption
and GNP growth This link is a
loose correlation at best (varv

ing over 230 percent in the last 20
years), and given a strong com
mitment to improving prod
uctive efficiency, could actually
be negative. Moreover. GNP is
a poor indicator of quality of
life.
Still. Greenberg insists the
U.S. is "forced to" import near
ly half of its oil to sustain the
economy. If Pakistan or some
other country advanced such an
argument, that it would be in
their best interest to acquire
U.S. timber and coal resources
to bolster their economy, we
would be outraged.
Greenberg attempts to justify
American energy consumption
by citing its role in U.S. agricul
ture. implying that this benefits
much of the world Actually,
most of our grain exports go to
fatten livestock in Europe and
Japan, not to feed hungry peo
ple. And while the U.S. is the
leading food exporter, it is also a
major importer of milk prod
ucts. fish and beef — often from
Third World countries with
starving lower classes.
Ignores Vietnam
Greenberg very casually
calls for a U.S. military

takeover of Saudi Arabia, and
ignores an important lesson of
Vietnam: no matter how small
and weak the country, its people
will resist foreign domination,
even bv the.superpowers. Viet
nam resisted even though the
U.S. carpet-bombed it. using as
many tons of explosives each
week as were dropped during all
of World War 11.
He also unabashedly suggests
having the CIA foment a revolu
tion to topple the present Saudi
government as it did in Iran.
Chile, and who knows where
else. Again, freedom, self-de
termination. and due process —
the very things we fiercely
claim for ourselves — are cast
aside.
U.S. colony
Greenberg gives several rea
sons that Saudi Arabia would be
better off as a U.S. energy co
lony: that public services.

wages, and the 15 percent liter
acy rate could all be improved.
Unfortunately, as Puerto Ri
cans. Native Americans, and
Chicano farmworkers can testi
fy. association with the U.S.
does not guarantee social im
provements. particularly for
those of a different cultural and
racial background. The com
paratively high wages of Ameri
can workers are due largely to
the labor struggles of the '20s
and '30s. many of which, iron
ically. were "communist in
spired." But the U.S. is still no
Utopia; unemployment or inade
quate wages are still the norm
for many people in this country.
Tyranny
Finally the issue of morality:
Greenberg decides in favor of
practicality over morality, ends
over means. U.S. GNF growth
over freedom. He seems ob
livious to the tyranny he pro

poses for Saudi Arabia and, in
variably. for us all. If we believe
in freedom, then we must de
fend freedom itself, not the
"free world."
We cannot defend freedom by
dominating people who refuse to
give us their resources. Rather
than encouraging the CIA to top
ple governments we don't like,
we should help people resist op
pression. to struggle for self-de
termination. We should help
them defend themselves from
foreign domination by the
U S S R , the U.S. or any other
country.
And if our country cannot sur
vive on its own vast natural re
sources. or on those resources
obtainable in free (non
coercive t trade, then we should
learn to conserve — and bring
our consumption in line with the
rest of the world's.

paratively high wages of Ameri

Tyranny
Finally the issue of morality:
Greenberg decides in favor of
practicality over morality, ends
over means. U.S. GNF growth
over freedom. He seems ob
livious to the tyranny he pro

poses for Saudi Arabia and, in
variably. for us all. If we believe
in freedom, then we must de
fend freedom itself, not the
"free world."
We cannot defend freedom by
dominating people who refuse to
give us their resources. Rather
than encouraging the CIA to top
ple governments we don't like,
we should help people resist op
pression. to struggle for self-de
termination. We should help
them defend themselves from
foreign domination by the
U S S R , the U.S. or any other
country.
And if our country cannot sur
vive on its own vast natural re
sources. or on those resources
obtainable in free (non
coercive t trade, then we should
learn to conserve — and bring
our consumption in line with the
rest of the world's.

1 couldn't believe Robert
Greenberg's column was seri
ous (Daily. Oct. 23>. His argu
ments for an American
takeover of Saudi Arabia were
reminiscent of those used to jus
tify the Vietnam War, reflecting
the same vacuous morality,
anti-communist myopia and
military mania.
Greenberg tells us that be
cause Russia does not provide
the "inalienable right of liberty
to its people." it is not justified
in invading Afghanistan. But a
U.S. takeover of Saudi Arabia is
quite alright, presumably be
cause we have a Bill of Rights.
No matter that in this takeover
we deny the people of Saudi Ara
bia this very freedom from
domination.
GNP growth
Another inalienable right for
Americans seems to be our
right to consume 40 percent of
the world's resources including
30 percent of the world's annual
oil production for the sake of the
gross national product.
Greenberg claims a rigid link
between energy consumption
and GNP growth This link is a
loose correlation at best (varv

ing over 230 percent in the last 20
years), and given a strong com
mitment to improving prod
uctive efficiency, could actually
be negative. Moreover. GNP is
a poor indicator of quality of
life.
Still. Greenberg insists the
U.S. is "forced to" import near
ly half of its oil to sustain the
economy. If Pakistan or some
other country advanced such an
argument, that it would be in
their best interest to acquire
U.S. timber and coal resources
to bolster their economy, we
would be outraged.
Greenberg attempts to justify
American energy consumption
by citing its role in U.S. agricul
ture. implying that this benefits
much of the world Actually,
most of our grain exports go to
fatten livestock in Europe and
Japan, not to feed hungry peo
ple. And while the U.S. is the
leading food exporter, it is also a
major importer of milk prod
ucts. fish and beef — often from
Third World countries with
starving lower classes.
Ignores Vietnam
Greenberg very casually
calls for a U.S. military

takeover of Saudi Arabia, and
ignores an important lesson of
Vietnam: no matter how small
and weak the country, its people
will resist foreign domination,
even bv the.superpowers. Viet
nam resisted even though the
U.S. carpet-bombed it. using as
many tons of explosives each
week as were dropped during all
of World War 11.
He also unabashedly suggests
having the CIA foment a revolu

government as it did in Iran.
