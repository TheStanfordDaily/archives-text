## Of dinosaurs and Ronald Reagan 
### 
As I sit here twiddling my
primate thumbs, it occurs to me
that two thoughts have been
keeping rather steady company
in my head lately. The first
thought is that the presidential
election is coming up soon, and
the second is that 99 percent of
all the species that have ever
lived on earth are now extinct.
What, you may ask. do these
two thoughts have to do with
each other? I'm damned if I
know. Wait: there's another
flash, a thought, a mosaic of im
ages stampeding across an al
ready crowded brain. There is a
movement of white clouds, and I
am going back in time, back,
back to about 160 million years
ago. the end of the Cretaceous,
the last few years of the su
premacy of the dinosaurs.
My mind is coalescing into
the form of one of those
dinosaurs, a big one, a flesh
eater, that stood upright and
terrorized everything that came

in its path. The dinosaur has a
terrible complacency about
him. He is not afraid. Do you
know what he is thinking' 7 Here,
1 will give you a simultaneous
translation. He is thinking, he is
thinking. . . .
Evolutionary process
A dinosaur living 160 million
years ago had cause to be proud.
The entire earth was dominated
by his line. Nature was ap
parently arranged with him as
the only logical product and con
sequence of its billions of years
of evolution.
He was lord of all he sur
veyed: the moist, tropical land
scapes. the thick-leafed vege
tation, the drowned swamps and
birdless forests. Oh. there were
a few ratlike creatures that
moved underfoot and on the per
iphery: obvious failures of the
evolutionary process, that knew
better than to show themselves
when one of the lordly dinosaurs
marched by in saurian ar

rogance.
And then, suddenly, so sud
denly that in geologic time it
took place in less than an ins
tant. the dinosaurs were all
gone. The time of The Great
Dying, the paleontologists call
it.the major extinction of the
late Cretaceous period. And the
apparent failures, those rat-like
creatures scurrying about unob
trusively on the edges, were
pre-adapted. because of their
warm blooded metabolism, to
spread out over the earth in the
adaptive radiation called the
Age of Mammals.
Co-evolution
This was aided by the simul
taneous co-evolution of the flow
ering plants: it was made pos
sible. so to speak, by the seed in
the heart of a flower. Very well,
you say. okay, very interesting.
But what's the connection?
The connection is this. Here
we are. a species of mammal, a
clever primate, who stands
poised on the brink of its own de
struction. We worship a strange
pagan religion called economic
growth, to whose god. the profit
motive, we are willing, in in
sane acts of collective
obeisance, to sacrifice our
rivers, our breathable air. the
gene pool of our species and the
collective gene pool of all living
things.
Now, in the midst of this.
Love Canal. Three Mile Island,
damaged eco-svstems and in
flated oil profits, who has of
fered himself as our leader and
guru for the next four years?
Ronald Reagan, a man who, in
an unguarded moment, let slip
his incredible belief that trees
cause pollution, coupled with
his absurd declaration that the
problem of auto pollution has

been solved. I contend that in
these times, to be so ignorant is
not just a mark of unlearned
ness. but that it constitutes a
fundamental moral failing, a
willful blindness that we as vot
ers must not charitably forget,
but that must enrage us. Is this a
man worthy of the trust of the
presidential office, even given
all our dissatisfaction with Jim
my Carter?
Dinosaurs of big business
Reagan, if elected, will turn
loose the dinosaurs of big busi
ness to profit and pollute freely.
He will systematically destroy
what little power the environ
mental regulatory agencies
have at the present. He has al
ready proved himself to be un
charitable to the poor, unable to
think for himself, and inclined
to grotesque and tragic over
simplification of complex is
sues.
Moreover, he shows not one
iota of awareness that our spec
ies is at the present engaged in a
desperate struggle for survival
against its own violent tenden
cies. M,
Before you vote for Reagan,
think about the cockroaches and
the rats running around at your
feet, obvious failures of the
evolutionary process, insignifi
cant creatures that crawl or run
awav when they hear you. the
mighty homo sapiens, coming.
I understand that thev are pre
adapted to survive in an en
vironment sufficiently high in
radioactivity to be fatal to us.
We may yet. in our blundering,
make it possible for them to in
herit the earth.

My mind is coalescing into
the form of one of those
dinosaurs, a big one, a flesh
eater, that stood upright and
terrorized everything that came

in its path. The dinosaur has a
terrible complacency about
him. He is not afraid. Do you
know what he is thinking' 7 Here,
1 will give you a simultaneous
translation. He is thinking, he is
thinking. . . .
Evolutionary process
A dinosaur living 160 million
years ago had cause to be proud.
The entire earth was dominated
by his line. Nature was ap
parently arranged with him as
the only logical product and con
sequence of its billions of years
of evolution.
He was lord of all he sur
veyed: the moist, tropical land
scapes. the thick-leafed vege
tation, the drowned swamps and
birdless forests. Oh. there were
a few ratlike creatures that
moved underfoot and on the per
iphery: obvious failures of the
evolutionary process, that knew
better than to show themselves
when one of the lordly dinosaurs
marched by in saurian ar

rogance.
And then, suddenly, so sud
denly that in geologic time it
took place in less than an ins
tant. the dinosaurs were all
gone. The time of The Great
Dying, the paleontologists call
it.the major extinction of the
late Cretaceous period. And the
apparent failures, those rat-like
creatures scurrying about unob
trusively on the edges, were
pre-adapted. because of their
warm blooded metabolism, to
spread out over the earth in the
adaptive radiation called the
Age of Mammals.
Co-evolution
This was aided by the simul
taneous co-evolution of the flow
ering plants: it was made pos
sible. so to speak, by the seed in
the heart of a flower. Very well,
you say. okay, very interesting.
But what's the connection?
The connection is this. Here
we are. a species of mammal, a
clever primate, who stands
poised on the brink of its own de
struction. We worship a strange
pagan religion called economic
growth, to whose god. the profit
motive, we are willing, in in
sane acts of collective
obeisance, to sacrifice our
rivers, our breathable air. the
gene pool of our species and the
collective gene pool of all living
things.
Now, in the midst of this.
Love Canal. Three Mile Island,
damaged eco-svstems and in
flated oil profits, who has of
fered himself as our leader and
guru for the next four years?
Ronald Reagan, a man who, in
an unguarded moment, let slip
his incredible belief that trees
cause pollution, coupled with
his absurd declaration that the
problem of auto pollution has

been solved. I contend that in
these times, to be so ignorant is
not just a mark of unlearned
ness. but that it constitutes a
fundamental moral failing, a
willful blindness that we as vot
ers must not charitably forget,
but that must enrage us. Is this a
man worthy of the trust of the
presidential office, even given
all our dissatisfaction with Jim
my Carter?
Dinosaurs of big business
Reagan, if elected, will turn
loose the dinosaurs of big busi
ness to profit and pollute freely.
He will systematically destroy
what little power the environ
mental regulatory agencies
have at the present. He has al
ready proved himself to be un
charitable to the poor, unable to
think for himself, and inclined
to grotesque and tragic over
simplification of complex is
sues.
Moreover, he shows not one
iota of awareness that our spec
ies is at the present engaged in a
desperate struggle for survival
against its own violent tenden
cies. M,
Before you vote for Reagan,
think about the cockroaches and
the rats running around at your
feet, obvious failures of the
evolutionary process, insignifi
cant creatures that crawl or run
awav when they hear you. the
mighty homo sapiens, coming.
I understand that thev are pre
adapted to survive in an en
vironment sufficiently high in
radioactivity to be fatal to us.
We may yet. in our blundering,
make it possible for them to in
herit the earth.

student in anthropology and a

As I sit here twiddling my
primate thumbs, it occurs to me
that two thoughts have been
keeping rather steady company
in my head lately. The first
thought is that the presidential
election is coming up soon, and
the second is that 99 percent of
all the species that have ever
lived on earth are now extinct.
What, you may ask. do these
two thoughts have to do with
each other? I'm damned if I
know. Wait: there's another
flash, a thought, a mosaic of im
ages stampeding across an al
ready crowded brain. There is a
movement of white clouds, and I
am going back in time, back,
back to about 160 million years
ago. the end of the Cretaceous,
the last few years of the su
premacy of the dinosaurs.
