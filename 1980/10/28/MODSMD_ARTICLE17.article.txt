## INS spreads Cold War to family front 
### 
The American Civil Liberties
Union, representing Michael
Polovchak. filed a child custody
suit in a Federal District Court
in Chicago last Monday. The de
fending party, however, can af
ford a skilled counselor. It is the
U.S. Immigration and Na
tionalization Service.
Walter Polovchak is the 12-
year-old who was spared a re
turn to the clutches of Com
munism when his family re
turned to the Ukraine this sum
mer The Polovchaks emigrated
to Chicago in January but

Michael and his wife Anna de
cided that the blessings of capi
talism were less fulfilling than
the comfort of their homeland.
Run-away
On July 14. Walter ran away
with his older sister Natalie to
an aunt's home in Chicago be
cause he didn't want to return to
the U.S.S R. The Illinois juve
nile court immediately ap
pointed an attorney for Walter.
On July 21, the INS supplanted
Michael Polovchak as head of
his own family by granting the
boy political asylum.

Walter explained to Juvenile
Court Judge Charles Mooney, "I
want to stay here. I have new
friends, a nice school, a bicycle I
fixed myself. Here is better
than my country I would rather
never see my parents again than
leave Chicago" (Chicago Trib
une, June 21).
By making Walter the
youngest refugee allowed to
breathe liberty in the home of
the brave, the INS has spread
the rejuvenated Cold War to the
family front. Propaganda has
swirled on both sides of the At

lantic. The Soviet press service
Tass labeled the case "an Amer
ican kidnapping" while the Chi
cago Tribune, not to be out
sensationalized ran an article on
.July 2 headed: "Father called
contused; Boy chose U.S. from
start."
Family turmoil
Aside from the headlines is
the obvious issue â€” the turmoil
imparted on the family. Lured
bv the comforts of an American
schoolboy, it is doubtful that
Walter will be able to change his
mind and opt for the security of

his family, a prospect which the
12-vear-old may have con
templated in the five days be
tween the time he was found at
his aunt's home and the day he
became a political refugee. Af
ter a disgraceful return to the
Ukraine. Michael and Anna
Polovchak's only hope for the
privilege of guiding their son
through adolescence lies in the
November 5 verdict of a judge
5000 miles away.
