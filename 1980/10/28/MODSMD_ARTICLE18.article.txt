Mascot slew
As a relative newcomer to the
campus, I've been following
with keen interest the current
controversy over the name and
mascot of Stanford's football
team But to me, the dispute be
tween Indians, Cardinals,
Trees, Griffins, etc.. seems
almost academic, as a slew of
better names immediately sug
gest themselves.
I can understand the objec
tions to the Indians on ethnic
grounds. But why not solve this
problem by rotating the team
name among the various minor
ity groups, and thus slurring
them equally? One week, the
Stanford Hispanics, then the
Stanford Jews, the Stanford

Blacks, the Stanford Asians,
and finally, the Stanford
Caucasians (or better vet. the
Stanford WASP'S).
The Trees I object to on the
grounds that a tree is not a very
good metaphor for an onrushing
defensive linebacker, but the al
ternatives are not much better:
the Stanford Grass? the Stan
ford Astroturf? To my mind, the
only acceptable vegetable
metaphor for our football team
is the Stanford Ground Cover.
(Although I'll admit that ground
cover wouldn't make a very ex
citing mascot — neither would a
tree, for that matter, unless it
was transplanted in the middle
of the gridiron.)
A Griffin, on the other hand,
would make a very exciting

mascot if one were available,
but what if it started to eat the
alumni? In the interest of scien
tific accuracy, I would suggest
replacing the mythological
beasts (the Stanford Trolls?)
with prehistoric ones: how does
the Stanford Mastodons grab
you.' or the Stanford Giant
Sloths? If a more contemporary
symbol is required, how about
the Stanford Polo Ponies?
My personal favorite among
the recent suggestions is the
Robber Barons, but I don't see
why we can't take this notion of
feudal lords to its logical con
clusion— i.e.. the Stanford Rail
road Magnates. In a similar
vein, the Stanford Storm
troopers strikes me as a good
candidate.

The distinction between the
bird Cardinal and the color
Cardinal (whoever heard of the
color Cardinal?) I find very con
fusing. and if we must choose
among cardinals, it seems un
fair to leve out Cardinal Sin or
Clarence Cardinal Cooke. Ul
timately. I would recommend
dropping any possibilities that
might present confusion be
tween a color and an object, in
cluding the Stanford Flam
ingoes, the Stanford Violets and
the Stanford Avacados.
But the really obvious can
didate far outshines any of these
suggestions. The Stanford Prep
pies and the Stanford Pre-Pro
fessionals were both contenders
in my search for the perfect
team name (why not combine

both as the Stanford "Preps"),
but the final choice lends itself
both to a colorful mascot and to
the prevalent lifestyle on cam
pus — the Stanford Alligators.

cover wouldn't make a very ex
citing mascot — neither would a
tree, for that matter, unless it
was transplanted in the middle
of the gridiron.)
A Griffin, on the other hand,
would make a very exciting

mascot if one were available,
but what if it started to eat the
alumni? In the interest of scien
tific accuracy, I would suggest
replacing the mythological
beasts (the Stanford Trolls?)
with prehistoric ones: how does
the Stanford Mastodons grab
you.' or the Stanford Giant
Sloths? If a more contemporary
symbol is required, how about
the Stanford Polo Ponies?
My personal favorite among
the recent suggestions is the
Robber Barons, but I don't see
why we can't take this notion of
feudal lords to its logical con
clusion— i.e.. the Stanford Rail
road Magnates. In a similar
vein, the Stanford Storm
troopers strikes me as a good
candidate.

The distinction between the
bird Cardinal and the color
Cardinal (whoever heard of the
color Cardinal?) I find very con
fusing. and if we must choose
among cardinals, it seems un
fair to leve out Cardinal Sin or
Clarence Cardinal Cooke. Ul
timately. I would recommend
dropping any possibilities that
might present confusion be
tween a color and an object, in
cluding the Stanford Flam
ingoes, the Stanford Violets and
the Stanford Avacados.
But the really obvious can
didate far outshines any of these
suggestions. The Stanford Prep
pies and the Stanford Pre-Pro
fessionals were both contenders
in my search for the perfect
team name (why not combine

both as the Stanford "Preps"),
but the final choice lends itself
both to a colorful mascot and to
the prevalent lifestyle on cam
pus — the Stanford Alligators.

We would like to express our
great admiration for
(Jreenberg's excellent satirical
style in his article entitled "An
American takeover would be
best (Daily, Oct. 23). We en
courage him to develop his tal
ent for black humor. Un
fortunately, however, such a
major is not vet an option for un
declared freshmen at Stanford.
