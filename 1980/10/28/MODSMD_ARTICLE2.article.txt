# Profs decry presidential choices; dramatic options suggested
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Optimism was not on the agenda
last night when three professors here
met in Branner Hall to discuss the up
coming presidential election.
All three agreed that the country
was facing critical problems and that
the vast majority of the electorate
seems to be disappointed with the
choices before them a week from to
day.
One proposed not voting at all as a
serious option for students, one sug
gested the revamping of the American
political system based on a parlia
mentary method and the third con
tended that the conditions which have
put the country where it is today, un
less corrected, "may lead to disloca
tions of a severe kind."
And only one. History Prof. Carl
Degler. maintained that the public
skepticism surrounding the election at
least shows that the country is
"healthy and powerful," and that "we
are still the (most) free country in the
world."
Both Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein and Political Science Prof.
.John Manley suggested that the cur
rent malaise of the nation was symp
tomatic of problems of a much deeper
root than the personality of the major
contenders for the presidency, and
that solutions would not come without
radical changes in the constitutional
system of the United States.
Manley asked the students to "take
a look and ask about the guts of liberal
democratic capitalism" while Berns
tein challenged Degler's proposal to
combine the functions of the executive
and legislative branches of the gov
ernment in a parliamentary system by

asking, "why can we assume that
things would be any better in such a
system. (which I alters the mechanics
but only nibbles at the structure?"
None of the three made any specific
recommendations about whom to vote
for or disclosed his own personal
choice. However. Bernstein said that
"if the major choices are not
palatable, not voting is a warranted
position."
Also, none would say why, despite
the electorate's professed lack of in
terest in the choices of the two major
parties, both Democrat Jimmy Carter
and Republican Ronald Reagan man
aged to secure their nominations by
decisive margins.
Bernstein did say that he "might be
tempted" by Citizens' party candidate
Barry Commoner, "who has raised
questions about the economy, control
by large corporations and the lust for
profit.'' and Manlev said that the so
cialist Peace and Freedom party
"does have much to recommend it."
although neither man made any spe
cific endorsements of the parties' can
didates.
Bernstein said that the United
States is facing "a massive economic
crisis, high inflation and substantial
unemployment," especially for
blacks, and that traditional social pro
grams for these problems have been
called into question.
Internationally, he blasted "a
crawling arms budget." oil depen
dence on foreign nations, an Afghan
crisis "exaggerated" by the Carter
administration and an Iranian situ
ation in which Carter had asked for
"massive amnesia" from the Ameri
can people about U.S. presence in the

country during the shah's regime.
Manley charged .Jimmy Carter with
being "the sorriest incumbent to be
running since 1932," a reference to
Herbert Hoover which drew some dis
senting murmurs from the audience,
and he said that inflation is "not just
double digit, has not just shown its im
munity to all the economic wonder
drugs, but the policies to deal with the
problem have attmepted to wring it
out of the American people's hides."
He further said that in "our no
growth world," the "strong and the
rich'' take away from the "poor and
the weak."
Degler said that one problem with
the American electoral process is that
it is "unconscionably long," in com
parison to European election cam
paigns which rarely last longer than a
few months.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning his
torian also said that "the presidency
may well have outlived its usefulness
as an institution in this country, and
that strong consideration ought to be
given to a parliamentary system to ov
ercome the "political paralysis
fostered today by the inability of the
president and the congress to get
along with each other.

running since 1932," a reference to
Herbert Hoover which drew some dis
senting murmurs from the audience,
and he said that inflation is "not just
double digit, has not just shown its im
munity to all the economic wonder
drugs, but the policies to deal with the
problem have attmepted to wring it
out of the American people's hides."
He further said that in "our no
growth world," the "strong and the
rich'' take away from the "poor and
the weak."
Degler said that one problem with
the American electoral process is that
it is "unconscionably long," in com
parison to European election cam
paigns which rarely last longer than a
few months.
The Pulitzer Prize-winning his
torian also said that "the presidency
may well have outlived its usefulness
as an institution in this country, and
that strong consideration ought to be
given to a parliamentary system to ov
ercome the "political paralysis
fostered today by the inability of the
president and the congress to get
along with each other.
Optimism was not on the agenda
last night when three professors here
met in Branner Hall to discuss the up
coming presidential election.
All three agreed that the country
was facing critical problems and that
the vast majority of the electorate
seems to be disappointed with the
choices before them a week from to
day.
One proposed not voting at all as a
serious option for students, one sug
gested the revamping of the American
political system based on a parlia
mentary method and the third con
tended that the conditions which have
put the country where it is today, un
less corrected, "may lead to disloca
tions of a severe kind."
And only one. History Prof. Carl
Degler. maintained that the public
skepticism surrounding the election at
least shows that the country is
"healthy and powerful," and that "we
are still the (most) free country in the
world."
Both Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein and Political Science Prof.
.John Manley suggested that the cur
rent malaise of the nation was symp
tomatic of problems of a much deeper
root than the personality of the major
contenders for the presidency, and
that solutions would not come without
radical changes in the constitutional
system of the United States.
Manley asked the students to "take
a look and ask about the guts of liberal
democratic capitalism" while Berns
tein challenged Degler's proposal to
combine the functions of the executive
and legislative branches of the gov
ernment in a parliamentary system by

asking, "why can we assume that
things would be any better in such a
system. (which I alters the mechanics
but only nibbles at the structure?"
None of the three made any specific
recommendations about whom to vote
for or disclosed his own personal
choice. However. Bernstein said that
"if the major choices are not
palatable, not voting is a warranted
position."
Also, none would say why, despite
the electorate's professed lack of in
terest in the choices of the two major
parties, both Democrat Jimmy Carter
and Republican Ronald Reagan man
aged to secure their nominations by
decisive margins.
Bernstein did say that he "might be
tempted" by Citizens' party candidate
Barry Commoner, "who has raised
questions about the economy, control
by large corporations and the lust for
profit.'' and Manlev said that the so
cialist Peace and Freedom party
"does have much to recommend it."
although neither man made any spe
cific endorsements of the parties' can
didates.
Bernstein said that the United
States is facing "a massive economic
crisis, high inflation and substantial
unemployment," especially for
blacks, and that traditional social pro
grams for these problems have been
called into question.
Internationally, he blasted "a
crawling arms budget." oil depen
dence on foreign nations, an Afghan
crisis "exaggerated" by the Carter
administration and an Iranian situ
ation in which Carter had asked for
"massive amnesia" from the Ameri
can people about U.S. presence in the

country during the shah's regime.
Manley charged .Jimmy Carter with
being "the sorriest incumbent to be
running since 1932," a reference to
Herbert Hoover which drew some dis
senting murmurs from the audience,
and he said that inflation is "not just
double digit, has not just shown its im
munity to all the economic wonder
