## The 						funk/punk didn't stunk 
### Shelly Stevenson 
New Wave rock 'n' roll minimalists may
well have been left in a mild state of shock
after the Talking Heads' Saturday night per
formance at the Warfield Theater
Launching a new album and a radical shift
in style, the band features several addi
tional members, most of whom were for
med v with Parliament-Funkadelic. Always
leagues beyond their ruder, shriller New-
Wave counterparts, the lean, precise, high
strung musical outlook characterizing the
Talking Heads has metamorphosed into a
yet more precise, denser, overwhelmingly
funky sound.
For better or worse, the band has broken
new ground Reggae-oriented New Wave
did well in the late 70s as exemplified by the
opening act. the English Beat ("Tears of a
Clown" ). A more popular, soul-tinged sound
has not. Talking Heads have managed to
create a new genre pundits will surely call
"punk-funk." For the large part, they
brought it off.
The essence is still there and the inner
core of the band remains cohesive and pow
erful. David Byrne, the Talking Heads' ec
centric. gifted lead singer, looked much like
a Marine Corp cadet in short-cropped dark
hair and tie-up. black patten leather shoes.
Looking to him for support (this insight I
owe to the second row seat relinquished by a
young man who tossed his cookies) were

bassist Tina Weymouth, guitarist Jerry
Harrison (Modern Lovers), drummer Chris
Frantz as well as newlv-arrived punk
guitarist Adrian Belew
Opening with "Psycho Killer." the band
followed with several numbers from their
More Songs About Buildings and Food 1.p.,
a definite prima! New Wave effort. They
quickly departed from comfortable famil
iar territory when joined onstage by vocal
ist Dollette McDonald, percussionist Steven
Scales and bassist Busta Jones. In sheer
numbers the new Talking Heads band is an
absolute orchestra.
Songs performed from the band's latest
album. Remain In Light, combine highly
syncopated rhythms with piercing vocals,
and harmonies with a layered, frenetic
feedback-oriented array of guitars. The new
material, virtually untouched by Bay Area
airwaves, included mostly notably "Cross
eyed and Painless (The Heat Goes On >" and
"Born Under Punches."
Does the new sound work 9 It is still elec
tric. It throbs. It is structured and dis
ciplined but it is so accessible it's
mesmerizing. But it should come as no ma
jor surprise. The hints have always been
there.
Songs like "Air." "Animals" and "Life
During Wartime" from the group's third
album. Fear of Music, meshed easily with
the new tunes. "I Zimbra" from the same

album borders on the tasteful bounds of dis
co. "Take Me To The River." Talking Heads
first encore number took on closer hues to
the original soulster Sly Johnson tune. In
fact, there were many soul influences on the
band's first release, Talking Heads '77:
"Don't Worry About The Government" and
"Uh-Oh. Love Comes To Town" are clean,
snappy tunes with pop roots.
So no one should feel betrayed by the
course the new Talking Heads have elected
to follow. It could be a trendsetter and the
elements have been there if not fully ex
ploited. Overall, the concert was even
paced, terribly professional in execution,
and made full use of its new members.
While I had mixed feelings about this new
direction. it is hypnotic to watch and ex
perience.
The only complaint I would lodge with the
evening, was that that certain something
that makes a concert truly memorable was
missing Perhaps it was the lack of in
terchange between the band and the au
dience. Perhaps, as the tour winds down,
the performance was a little strained.
Byrne's vocals on "Life During Wartime"
wereflatish. "Animals" too showed signs of
stress. Maybe it is the elusive under
standing of what motivates this talented
group. It will be interesting to see if much
more can be done with stylized, if somewhat
hysterical funk. I wish them luck.
