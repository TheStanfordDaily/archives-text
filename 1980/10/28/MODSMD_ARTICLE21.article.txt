# Those boys from Belfast
## 
### Lucy Richert 
Northern Ireland's Stiff Little Fingers, who
played at the Keystone Palo Alto last week, are
something of an anomaly among British rock
bands. They're the only band from Belfast,
where they are hugely popular, to achieve suc
cess outside Ireland. And they're virtually the
only veterans of the Class of '77-'7B who still
play unadulterated punk rock.
They are also very political, which isn't sur
prising considering their origins. But SLF
doesn't indulge in the strident, simple-minded
polemics a lot of British bands produce; nor do
they go for the anarchy-for-its-own-sake ex
cesses dished out by dozens of would-be Johnny
Rottens. The band is made up of four young
musicians for whom punk rock was simply the
only possible musical response to the madness
surrounding them in Belfast. What's more —
and this is what really sets SLF apart — they
utterly refuse to either sentimentalize or ex
ploit the tragedy of their subject matter
(Northern Ireland's "troubles") or their own
role as popular spokesmen
All of which probably explains why they still
play punk rock, and why they're so good at it.
Like all the best punk bands. Stiff Little Fin
gers know that in order to be politically valid
their songs must be musically valid as well
(for all their talk of anarchy, even the Sex
Pistols based their sonic onslaught on solid
rhythmic and melodic foundations). The band
members are all good musicians who chose to

play punk rock because it was the best way to
communicate what they had to say: their mu
sic is the aural equivalent of living in a war
zone, all jagged edges, fierce, slashing guitar
lines, incessant rhythms, raw. plaintive vo
cals.
At the Keystone, early singles like "Alter
native Ulster" and "Suspect Device" fairly
exploded off the stage in a burst of ringing
guitar chords. More recent songs like "No
body's Hero." as eloquent and sincere a rejec
tion of rock-star idolatry as you're likely to
hear, were marginally less manic but just as
affecting. For me. though, the highlight of the
concert was a cover of Bob Marley's "Johnny
Was."' a song about police repression and
brutality in Jamaica. The parallels with the
current situation in Belfast were obvious, and
the band's revved-up rendition was like a cry
from the heart, artless and piercing.
After years of concert-going, I've learned
that whether or not I like a technically "good"
band depends a great deal on simply whether
or not I believe them Stiff Little Fingers leave
you no choice but to believe They are probably
the most sincere (that word keeps coming to
mind), guileless, even innocent major band
that I've ever seen There is no artifice, no
"act" to insulate the audience from the power
and message of their music. Stiff Little Fin
gers' music doesn't go down easy, but I guaran
tee it will stay with you longer than any story
on the evening news.
