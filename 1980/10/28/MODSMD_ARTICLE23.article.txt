Heinz Poll's Ohio Ballet provides yet an
other example of a phenomenon common
anions performing dance groups but rela
tively rare among classical music en
sembles. Generally classical music groups
fall into the symphony orchestra category,
paralleled by American Ballet Theater in
dance or the chamber music one, more like
the Joffrev Ballet. Dance companies like
the Ohio Ballet though, which performed
last Thursday and Friday with a free lecture
demonstration offered on Wednesday, as
semble a small number of polished soloists
under a single creative force. Poll's, which
directs and choreographs. Thursday's and
Friday's programs presented four pieces
choreographed by Poll and a fifth and final
pieces by either George Balanchine or Paul
Taylor. Friday's performance demon
strated the facets of Poll's personality and
own evolution as a choreographer rather
than that of the individual dancers.
The choreographer was born and trained
in Germany where he performed with com
panies such as the Berlin State Opera Ballet
in East Berlin Following this he held im
portant positions as principal dancer,
choreographer and teacher with the Na
tional Ballet of Chile, and the Ballet de la

Jeunesse Musicale de France In 1967 Poll
founded the Dance Institute at the Univer
sity of Akron and the next year the Chamber
< now Ohio) Ballet
His earliest piece of this set, Summer
Nixht, to Chopin's Concerto no. 1, shows a
Poll relaxed within the traditional classical
style before his attempt to assimilate the
advances' made by choreographers such
as New York City Ballet's Balanchine The
quartet of dancers for this pleasant piece
were costumed and surrounded by light in
shades of blue and green The pairs, Judith
Denman with Tom Barkes, and Carol
Thwaite with David Bondio performed well
and comfortably within the light, soft
choreography.
For the first two pieces on the program.
Concerto (irosso and Duet, created in 1976
and 1979 respectively. Poll quoted and drew
inspiration from the movement vocab
ularies of Balanchine. Martha Graham and
others. The lack of assimilation of these in
fluences resulted in a forced choreography
but one which served to present the ex
treme uniformity of the dancers' technique.
The homogeneity of the Ohio Ballet dancers
in these pieces was astounding. Un
fortunately the consistancy of the move
ment style was neither wholly correct in
terms of the classical ballet technique nor

particularly aesthetically pleasing Ex
amples of this peculiar style included one
beautifully broadened upper back which
somehow never connected with either the
shoulders or the lower back, hands locked
into an open C as well as biocky feet
Perhaps the most interesting piece
choreographicallv was Poll s most recent
work which premiered this October in Ohio
Set to selections from Debussy's Preludes
i Book one and two), this work consisted of
five choreographic sketches grouped
together under the title Images. These in
dicated Poll's evolution toward a more so
phisticated and personal style and ranged
from a sizzling narrative Salome, to a medi
tative solo Prisoner, performed by Scott
Heinzerling The audience, in large number
Stanford students, particularly enjoyed the
absurdity of {he Nightmare segment
The evening closed with a spirited per
formance of Paul Taylor's well-known
Aureole. In the repertoire of several ballet
companies, this light dance for three wom
en and two men shows strongly the in
fluences of Graham and Taylor but with
some modifications. In all. the Ohio Ballet,
sponsored by the Lively Arts at Stanford,
gave a very full evening presenting good
dancers under a unified but growing
creative force.

fall into the symphony orchestra category,
paralleled by American Ballet Theater in
dance or the chamber music one, more like
the Joffrev Ballet. Dance companies like
the Ohio Ballet though, which performed
last Thursday and Friday with a free lecture
demonstration offered on Wednesday, as
semble a small number of polished soloists
under a single creative force. Poll's, which
directs and choreographs. Thursday's and
Friday's programs presented four pieces
choreographed by Poll and a fifth and final
pieces by either George Balanchine or Paul
Taylor. Friday's performance demon
strated the facets of Poll's personality and
own evolution as a choreographer rather
than that of the individual dancers.
The choreographer was born and trained
in Germany where he performed with com
panies such as the Berlin State Opera Ballet
in East Berlin Following this he held im
portant positions as principal dancer,
choreographer and teacher with the Na
tional Ballet of Chile, and the Ballet de la

Jeunesse Musicale de France In 1967 Poll
founded the Dance Institute at the Univer
sity of Akron and the next year the Chamber
< now Ohio) Ballet
His earliest piece of this set, Summer
Nixht, to Chopin's Concerto no. 1, shows a
Poll relaxed within the traditional classical
style before his attempt to assimilate the
advances' made by choreographers such
as New York City Ballet's Balanchine The
quartet of dancers for this pleasant piece
were costumed and surrounded by light in
shades of blue and green The pairs, Judith
Denman with Tom Barkes, and Carol
Thwaite with David Bondio performed well
and comfortably within the light, soft
choreography.
For the first two pieces on the program.
Concerto (irosso and Duet, created in 1976
and 1979 respectively. Poll quoted and drew
inspiration from the movement vocab
ularies of Balanchine. Martha Graham and
others. The lack of assimilation of these in
fluences resulted in a forced choreography
but one which served to present the ex
treme uniformity of the dancers' technique.
The homogeneity of the Ohio Ballet dancers
in these pieces was astounding. Un
fortunately the consistancy of the move
ment style was neither wholly correct in
terms of the classical ballet technique nor

particularly aesthetically pleasing Ex
amples of this peculiar style included one
beautifully broadened upper back which
somehow never connected with either the
shoulders or the lower back, hands locked
into an open C as well as biocky feet
Perhaps the most interesting piece
choreographicallv was Poll s most recent
work which premiered this October in Ohio
Set to selections from Debussy's Preludes
i Book one and two), this work consisted of
five choreographic sketches grouped
together under the title Images. These in
dicated Poll's evolution toward a more so
phisticated and personal style and ranged
from a sizzling narrative Salome, to a medi
tative solo Prisoner, performed by Scott
Heinzerling The audience, in large number
Stanford students, particularly enjoyed the
absurdity of {he Nightmare segment
The evening closed with a spirited per
formance of Paul Taylor's well-known
Aureole. In the repertoire of several ballet
companies, this light dance for three wom
en and two men shows strongly the in
fluences of Graham and Taylor but with
some modifications. In all. the Ohio Ballet,
sponsored by the Lively Arts at Stanford,
gave a very full evening presenting good
dancers under a unified but growing
creative force.
