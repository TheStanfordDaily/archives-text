# California Suite funny as ever
## 
### John McKnight 
A comfortable, but entertain
ing reproduction of Neil Simon's
play California Suite is being
performed at the San Jose Cen
ter for the Performing Arts. It
stars Dave Madden (of the
Partridge Family) and Barbara
Stuart (Bunny from the Comer
Psle show) in one of Simon's
most delightful yet incisive situ
ation comedies.
Director Milton Lyon per
forms the difficult task of pro
ducing with two actors a play
that originally called for four.
The play is structured, as is the
earlier Plaza Suite, around four
sets of occupants in a hotel
suite. Lyon cuts one scene and
rearranges the other three to
make the change possible. The
effort is admirable, but I yearn
for the sheer entertainment of
two more faces on stage.
The character changes are,
nevertheless, skillfully made —
to the credit of Madden and
Stuart. Their acting expertise
shows as Madden goes from
sneakered Californian (bv far.

his weakest character i to sensi
tive English homosexual to
nuddle-aged average Ameri
can. and Stuart progresses from
provincial New Yorker to aging
English actress to average
housewife 1 am pleasantly sur
prised to see that an actor and
actress who are famous for spe
cific characters can still act in
other roles.
My only criticism of the show
is that it does not move well
enough It starts off slowly, be
gins to quicken, but it never
seems to achieve the pace that
Simon intended. Simon's witty
bantering calls for quick de
livery to hold audience atten
tion.
Of the three scenarios. "Vis
ltur from London'' is the most
effective. (It was Simon's fa
vorite. ) Madden and Stuart
portray the sadly realistic mar
riage of an unhappy actress and
a homosexual antique dealer.
She gives him "a wider circle of
prospects" while he is kinder to
her "than your average stunt
man. " Madden and Stuart show

us a tragic love that remains
strong and resilient through the
name-calling and petty accusa
tions. The scene is sensitively,
yet comically portrayed and it
makes the entire show -worth
while.
Simon once said. "I don't
start out to write comedy. I be

gin by studying all the tragic
aspects of my characters.
Dave Madden and Barbara
Stuart let us see the tragedy in
the lives of the occupants of
suites 203 and 204. but we still
laugh That's Neil Simon. We
laugh at his characters because
they are so much like us.
