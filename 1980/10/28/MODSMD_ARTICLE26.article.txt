The polyphonic chanson was
an extremely popular genre in
the mid-16th century, with liter
ally thousands of pieces pub
lished in France and the Nether
lands. This was largely due to
the increasing wealth and status
of the bourgeoisie, which could
now afford the type of entertain
ment that before had been re
served for those of noble birth.
Musical abilitv was considered

essential for any socially aspir
ing person, and singing from a
book of chanson* was a common
evening's entertainment The
subject of the chanson was
almost always love, ot either
the courtly or bawdy variety.
