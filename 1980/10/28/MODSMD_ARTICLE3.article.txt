### Carol Shapiro 
An information day on graduate opportunities for minority students will be
held tomorrow at Tresidder Union with representatives of some 30 schools
from across the nation.
'Although the emphasis of this day is for minority students, all students are
welcome.' said coordinator Hector Cuevas, director of internships at the Stu
dent Employment Office in the Career Planning and Placement Center
(CPPC).
Sponsored by the Academic Information Center, the dean of Graduate Stud
ies and Research and the CPPC, the program will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Sylvia Castillo said many of the schools
hope to see a large number of students, but she added, 'there is a particular
desire to contact minorities.'
Advising and recruiting
According to Cuevas, the day is intended to advise students as well as recruit
them. He said the program will explain 'how to put everything together' in ap
plying to graduate schools.
'Representatives will talk about such things as admission requirements, mi
nority fellowships and graduate programs. Students will also be able to sign up
on mailing lists,' he said.
Castillo said recruiters want to reach students and motivate them to consider
graduate school after college.
'It's a chance for a kind of personal interview in which one can get answers to
questions and talk about concerns or interests,' she said. 'A personal level of
communication is reached rather than a communication merely through cor
respondence.' she added.
Ed P]scobar. assistant dean of graduate studies, said students should begin
planning for graduate school as early as freshman year. 'Senior year is almost
too late; students should be aware of requirements so they can gear their
thoughts, as well as their undergraduate programs,' he said.
Last year 'excellent'
This is the second year the graduate information day has taken place. 'Last
vear recruiters felt there was an excellent turn-out in numbers as well as quali
ty." said Cuevas.
Escobar said this year's program can be just as successful if enough students
participate. This is a tremendous service for the undergraduate population and
I think all students should come out and take advantage of the opportunity,' he
said.
More schools will be represented this year, including Harvard, Yale, Cornell,
all the UC campuses and other major universities, according to Cuevas.
