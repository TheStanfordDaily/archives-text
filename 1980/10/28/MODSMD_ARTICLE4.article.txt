From the Daily wire services
Washington — When President Jim
my Carter and Ronald Reagan meet in
Cleveland tonight, their showdown de
bate is likely to stick to familiar
themes: war and taxes, energy and
the economy and the role of govern
ment in American life.
For once in the 1980 campaign, the
two rivals will stand a few feet from
each other as they spell out their dif
ferences. Barring a slip of the tongue
in response to a question, the strongest
impression they are likely to leave is a
sense of their personalities.
ABC News correspondent Barbara
Walters, two news executives and a
Washington correspondent have been
named to the panel which will question
Carter and Reagan, the Republican
nominee.
Joining Walters will be Harry tlllis.
a Washington correspondent for the
Christian Science Monitor; William
Billiard, assistant managing editor of
the Portland Oregonian, and Marvin
Stone, editor of U.S. News & World
Report.
All four confirmed they had been
named to the panel.
Tactics
Reagan's priority, if he follows the
advice of his aides, will be to reassure
potential supporters who have been
shaken by Carter's blistering attacks
on the Republican candidate's views.
He will strive to be relaxed and hu
man. to depict himself "as a warm
and caring person, not the kind of pres
ident who would start a war or cut

back on Medicare." one Reagan aide
said.
Carter's main goal is to dramatize
the substantive differences between
himself and his challenger, advancing
the theory that Reagan's views are in
the minority and are based on a shal
low understanding of the nation's af
fairs.
"We have assumed from the begin
ning that under the right kind of cir
cumstances. it would be clear to the
people that Reagan doesn't have a
deep grasp of the issues and that after
you get beyond the 3-by-5 cards there
isn't a whole lot more." Carter cam
paign chairman Robert Strauss said.
Rough words
If it's high drama Americans are ex
pecting from the nationally broadcast
debate, they probably will have to set
tle for the chance that the candidates
will use some of their harsher cam
paign lines.
Will Carter fix Reagan with a cold
stare and call the Republican nominee
"extraordinarily naive" in his hope to
renegotiate an arms control treaty
with the Soviets.' Will Carter describe
Reagan's tax cut plan as "voodoo eco
nomics"?
Will Heagan turn to Carter and.in
tones of outrage, call Carter's eco
nomic record one of "misery and de
spair unparallelled in recent his
tory"? Will he accuse Carter of being
"incompetent"?
It the insults start flying, how will
the two rivals respond?
Based on past performances.
Carter is likely to unleash a mass of
statistics intended to counter any al
legation that he has failed to deal with
any national problem during the past
3*2 years.

On the other hand. Reagan is more
likely to cock his head and look at
Carter with an expression of hurt and
surprise and respond with something
like. "Do you really think I'm a war
monger'.'"
Under the format agreed on by both
sides, the best chance for rhetorical
fireworks will come during the second

half when the candidates respond
directly to each other's statements.
During the first half, the candidates
will respond to questions from the
panel, both of them responding to the
same questions.
It's safe to bet that they'll be asked
about their tax cut plans. Carter's for
$27.6 billion and Reagan's for $37
billion , the president's geared more to
business, the Republican nominee s
based primarily on a 10 percent cut in
tax rates for individuals.
It is hard to find anyone in either
campaign who believes the opposing
candidate will seriously embarrass
himself tonight. The most common
prediction on either side is that the de
bate will appear, on the surface at
east, to end as a draw
