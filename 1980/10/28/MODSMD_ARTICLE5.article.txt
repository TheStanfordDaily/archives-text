# Speaker skeptical about value of debates
## Making a slip more important than debating issues 
### Debbie Walker 
Both contenders in tonight's tele
vised presidential debate will be
praying for that long-shot, sudden
death chance that the opponent will
make a fool of himself, according
to Robert Hartmann, former chief
of staff to President Gerald Ford.
Hartmann. hosted by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, presented the re
sults of his study on presidential de
bates to a small group in Bishop
Auditorium last night, citing pas
sages from his new book. Palace
Politics.
"Perhaps tomorrow will be the
last of the presidential debates, if
we should be so lucky," he said.
"The phenomenon of presiden
tial debates has been confined to
the early stages of new com
munication breakthroughs, and
people may tire of them just as
they do of last season's top-rated
shows." he said
Telegraph, shorthand
The Lincoln-Douglas debates in
1856 followed the introduction of
two technological inventions, the
telegraph and reportorial short
hand. he said.
In the following century, nomi
nees attacked each other and de
fended themselves at discreet dis
tances. according to Hartmann, a
senior research fellow at the Hoo
ver Institution.
The 1960 presidential debates be
tween Kennedy and Nixon were
masterminded by television
network executives. This followed
Nixon's impressive demonstration
of the importance of television
campaigning with the famous
"Checkers Speech," said
Hartmann.
'Corny' but popular
"The speech has often been
dubbed corny," he said, "but 60

million people watched that speech
and 2 million wired Washington at
Nixon's request in support of keep
ing him on the Eisenhower ticket."
Hartmann said Congress conve
niently waived the Federal Com
munication Commission's equal
time rule in 1960 so that only the
two major parties' candidates

would have to be accommodated on
the air.
Despite the excitement aroused
by those debates. Hartmann said
he is skeptical of the value of such
forums.
Familiar format
The format of tonight's debate is
very similar to the daily meetings

the two contestants have with re
porters. he said
"The worst that can happen is a
verbal slip," Hartmann said, "and
though these slips can be humor
ous. they are not decisive."
He referred to a recent such
"slip" during a presidential debate
when Ford announced that there
would be no Soviet domination of
Eastern Europe while he was in the
White House.
Even though jokes were made
about Ford's 'liberating Poland
before its time,' said Hartmann,
this only set Ford back one per
centage point on the national polls.
Three rules
Hartmann. a Stanford graduate,
said there are three rules about
presidential debates:
— the major effect is to reduce
the ranks of the undecidcd;
— what you see is far more im
portant than what you hear;
— the debater's task is to rattle
his opponent and make him mad
There is little chance of a clear
cut winner or loser emerging from
ton.ght's debate, said Hartmann.
"The only loser would be An
derson in this demonstration of the
fact that there are only two true
contenders for the presidency," he
said.
Hartmann added that the debate
will illuminate little in the way of
policy or issue stances, since most
of the people who are really in
terested have already discovered
as much as possible.
The former chief of staff as
serted that "nine-tenths of most
presidents problems can be traced
to the one fact that they talk too
much."
"Unless a President has some
thing significant to say. he should
keep still."he said
