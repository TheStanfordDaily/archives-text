## Divorce, birth control denounced Catholic bishops reaffirm doctrine 
### Los Angeles Tunes 
Vatican City — Pope John
Paul II praised the Synod of
Bishops at its concluding ses
sion Saturday for holding fast to
the firm doctrine of the Roman
Catholic Church which they had
supported in the face of pres
sure for change on birth control
and divorce.
He mixed with his stern
words an appeal for pastoral
charity on the part of priests
dealing with those who fail to
meet the standards set by the
church.
But he dismissed a gradualist
approach to accepting the
teachings of the church, a com
ment interpreted by a leading
theologian here as making clear
the unacceptability of taking the
birth control pill today but an
ticipating full compliance with
church teaching tomorrow.
"There are two hinges on
which the discussion has
turned." he said, "namely,
fidelity toward the plan of God
for the family and a pastoral
way of acting, proper to which is
merciful love and reverence
shown to all men and wom
en...."
The synod had been meeting
for a month on the problems of
Christian families.
Recommendations of the
bishops, comprised of 43 propo
sitions. were kept secret by Vat
ican decision, drawing the
criticism of a number of
bishops.
"We supported the idea of
making the propositions pub
lic." Archbishop -John Quinn. of

San Francisco, president of the
U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said at the end of the
synod Saturday.
The pope made public a few of
the propositions in his address
to the closing session Saturday,
and by omission stirred interest
in one in particular.
Marriage must remain in
dissoluble. the pope said, prais
ing those who maintain this
commitment in the face of par
ticular pain and difficulty.
He called on priests to reach
out to those excluded from the
Holy Eucharist because they
have remarried after divorce,
but he confirmed the stand of
the bishops that there should be
no change on this rule.
The pope noted that those who
remarry after divorce can gain
consent to receive the Eucharist
through the sacrament of
Penance, and if they agree to ac
cept 'complete continence" in
their new relationship and are
free of "giving scandal."
An omission attracted partic
ular attention The pope made
no reference in his speech to one
of the propositions adopted by
the bishops for a study of the
practice of the Orthodox
churches in making con
cessions. including access to the
sacraments of marriage and
communion, in remarriage af
ter divorce.
The pope also praised the syn
od for the way it had called at
tention to the role of a woman
"as a daughter of God. as a wife
and as a mother." His emphasis

was on an appeal to make it pos
sible for women to stay at home.
It is commer.dably asked
that human society be so con
structed that women are not
forced to engage in external
work, proper to a certain role
or. as they say. profession, but
rather so that the family might
be able to live rightly, that the
mother might devote herself
fully to the family." the pope
said
Speaking of what he called the
"process of gradualism." the
pope commended the bishops
because they had "rejected any
type of division of dichotomy be
tween a pedagogy, which takes
into account a certain
progression in accepting the
plan of God. and doctrine, pro
posed by the church, with all its
consequences, in which the pre
cept of living according to the
same doctrine is contained, in
which case there is not a ques
tion of a desire of keeping the
law as merely an ideal to be
achieved in the future but rather
of the mandate of Christ the
Lord that difficulties be con
stantly overcome."
The bishops themselves is
sued an eight-page message Sat
urday to the Christian families
of the world offering sympa
thetic support as they face com
plex problems. Government in
terference in family life was
singled out for special refer
ence.
"Families are compelled,
and this we oppose vehemently,
to use such immoral means for

the solution of social, economic
and demographic problems as
contraception or. even worse,
sterilization, abortion and
euthanasia." the bishops de
clared.
Two of the American bishops
present said they did not know
what governments were being
referred to but that bishops of
the Third World were familiar
with the problems.

"Free Maternity." Italian feminists and writers firmed the church doctrine against divorce and
began calling Pope John Paul II a "male abortion.
Vatican City — Pope John
Paul II praised the Synod of
Bishops at its concluding ses
sion Saturday for holding fast to
the firm doctrine of the Roman
Catholic Church which they had
supported in the face of pres
sure for change on birth control
and divorce.
He mixed with his stern
words an appeal for pastoral
charity on the part of priests
dealing with those who fail to
meet the standards set by the
church.
But he dismissed a gradualist
approach to accepting the
teachings of the church, a com
ment interpreted by a leading
theologian here as making clear
the unacceptability of taking the
birth control pill today but an
ticipating full compliance with
church teaching tomorrow.
"There are two hinges on
which the discussion has
turned." he said, "namely,
fidelity toward the plan of God
for the family and a pastoral
way of acting, proper to which is
merciful love and reverence
shown to all men and wom
en...."
The synod had been meeting
for a month on the problems of
Christian families.
Recommendations of the
bishops, comprised of 43 propo
sitions. were kept secret by Vat
ican decision, drawing the
criticism of a number of
bishops.
"We supported the idea of
making the propositions pub
lic." Archbishop -John Quinn. of

San Francisco, president of the
U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops, said at the end of the
synod Saturday.
The pope made public a few of
the propositions in his address
to the closing session Saturday,
and by omission stirred interest
in one in particular.
Marriage must remain in
dissoluble. the pope said, prais
ing those who maintain this
commitment in the face of par
ticular pain and difficulty.
He called on priests to reach
out to those excluded from the
Holy Eucharist because they
have remarried after divorce,
but he confirmed the stand of
the bishops that there should be
no change on this rule.
The pope noted that those who
remarry after divorce can gain
consent to receive the Eucharist
through the sacrament of
Penance, and if they agree to ac
cept 'complete continence" in
their new relationship and are
free of "giving scandal."
An omission attracted partic
ular attention The pope made
no reference in his speech to one
of the propositions adopted by
the bishops for a study of the
practice of the Orthodox
churches in making con
cessions. including access to the
sacraments of marriage and
communion, in remarriage af
ter divorce.
The pope also praised the syn
od for the way it had called at
tention to the role of a woman
"as a daughter of God. as a wife
and as a mother." His emphasis

was on an appeal to make it pos
sible for women to stay at home.
