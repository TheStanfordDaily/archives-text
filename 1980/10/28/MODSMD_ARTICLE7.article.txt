# Canada to reform oil, gas industry

### Washington Post 
Ottawa — Prime Minister
Pierre Trudeau's Liberal gov
ernment expects to unveil to
day. along with the annual
budget, sweeping and highly
controversial orders tor the
Canadianization" of the large-
Iv American-controlled oil and
gas industry. His goal is to as
sure at least 50 percent Canadi
an ownership by 1991)
Trudeau is also planning to es
tablish. unilaterally, a new oil
pricing schedule for all of Cana
da In effect, this will formally
scrap the pledge by the previous
Conservative government to
permit prices to move quickly to
world levels.
At the same time, the govern
ment will impose hefty new fed
eral energy taxes designed to
force the rich western prov
inces. especially Alberta
which accounts for 85 percent of
all Canadian oil production — to
share their enormous wealth
with the rest of the country.
Trudeau's readiness to accept
an open confrontation with Al
berta comes against the
backdrop of a constitutional bat
tle with the provinces. Trudeau
is pushing a new constitution.

complete with a wide-ranging
bill of rights, including equal
privileges throughout Canada
for the French-speaking popu
lation
One adviser to Trudeau ex
plained it by saying. We don't
want another Middle East in
western Canada with the corpo
rations and the province of Al
berta owning everything in the
country."
Stakes are high
Because of the vast rise of oil
prices, starting with OPEC's
first big increase in 1973. the
stakes are enormous. Energy
minister Marc Lalonde esti
mates that Canadian oil and gas
revenues during the next 10
years will be $350 billion to $400
billion The way the system
works, that would be split 45
percent for the companies. 45
percent for the provinces
i which under Canadian law own
the natural resources within
their boundaries) and only 10
percent for the federal govern
ment.
In his successful campaign to
regain government control
from conservative Joe Clark.
Trudeau — now surrounded by a
more left-liberal cast than was
true in his first administration
— argued that the existing 45-45-
10 split had to be recast to pre
vent a worsening of economic
imbalance in Canada
Precise details of the new
split will not be known until to
night at 8 p.m. But the oil com
panies and the western prov
inces are bracing themselves
for Ottawa to take a 20 to 30
percent share.
Foreign ownership prevails
Canada's oil and gas industry,
which once was almost 100
percent foreign owned, is now
about 75 percent in the hands of
foreigners. According to
Lalonde. 19 of the top 25 com
panies producing oil and gas in

Canada have more than 50
percent foreign ownership. All
of the 19 are multinationals
based in the United States, ex
cept for Shell and British Petro
leum The largest Canadian con
trolled company, the govern
ment's Petro Canada, ranks
only ninth
As things stand, an energy ex
pert in the government ex
plained. the foreign owners of
Canadian oil companies have
enjoyed what amounts to a
transfer of wealth on the order
of $40 billion to $50 billion in the
incremental value of their oil
reserves since OPEC shot
prices skyward in 1973. And that
is based merely on a Canadian
oil price artificially held to
roughly half the OPEC price.
And as oil prices go up. that
bonanza will grow.
"We are simply not prepared
to see the indefinite extension of
foreign control." Lalonde told a
group of American investors
last month "Canadians must be
partners, not just employees, in
our future oil and gas industry."
Advance national interests
In an interview in his office
overlooking Parliament, Herb
Gray, the minister of industry,
trade and commerce who to
gether with Lalonde has been a
driving force for Canadi
anization of energy, said: "Our
measures are aimed at advanc
ing Canadian national interests,
not at any country or against
any enterprise based in other
countries." Gray and all other
officials insist that Cana
danization of the oil industry is
not the forerunner of similar
percentage limits on foreign in
vestment in other industries.
Trudeau and his Cabinet are
convinced that the basic de
cisions about Canada's energy
future should not be made in
board rooms in Chicago, New

York or Texas. They hold that
the foreign controlled sub
sidiaries that dominiate most of
Canada's important industrial
sectors deliver less.' as Cray
put it.from the standpoint of
Canada's national interest For
example, until Husky Oil was
taken over by a Canadian com
pany. none of Husky's research
work was done in Canada, al
though a full 75 percent of
Husky's production was in Can
ada
They see energy as the
galvanizing force for Canada's
further industrialitionship.
Canadian companies favored
A key technique, apparently,
will be to withdraw from the for
eign dominated companies the
extraordinarily favorable de
preciation allowances that have
been the rule until now. Coin
cidentiallv. Canadian com
panies will be favored with ex
ploration and development
grants, especially in federal
lands, and in the new and prom
ising offshore Newfoundland
areas.
Ottawa insists that Alberta
will continue to be the richest
province, regardless of the bite
it takes today. And it justi
fies its action not only on the
constitutional division of
powers, but because federal
programs have contributed to
the growth of the oil industry
everywhere in Canada.
The increased cash flow that
Trudeau expects to get from a
more favorable split of oil rev
enues will help to pare back
Canada's enormous federal def
icit. estimated to be in the
neighborhood of $14 billion In
American equivalent terms,
that would be about $140 billion.
Trudeau is establishing the
new oil price schedule after fail
ing to reach agreement with Al
berta.
