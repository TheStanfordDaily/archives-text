# Ethiopia reinforces ties with Soviets

Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (AP) — Six years
after Marxist military officers toppled the
feudal regime M Emperor Haile Selassie,
this fractured and impoverished East
African country has adopted the trappings
of its Soviet-bloc godfathers.
Billboard-sized portraits of Karl Marx.
Friedrich Engels and Vladimir Ilvich Lenin
dominate Revolution Square in the center of
the capital. Red banners hailing "pro
letarian internationalism" canopy tree
lined streets and boulevards, and hundreds
of posters depicting Ethiopian-Communist
solidarity are sprinkled throughout residen
tial communities and business districts.
In the countryside. Ethiopian officials
say. collective farms and villages are run by
peasant organizations. Cities are run by
hundreds of neighborhood associations,
called kebeles. which are responsible for
community security, political indoctri
nation and welfare.
And in the press, news items proclaiming
the victories of "socialist Ethiopia" pre
dominate. side-bv-side with foreign news
briefs on events in Soviet-bloc countries.
The United States and its Western allies are
regularly villified as "warmongers," "cap
italist imperialists." and "neo-colonial

ists."
"The Ethiopian revolution is part and
parcel of the worldwide international pro
letarian movement." says Lt. Col. Mengistu
Mariam. chairman of the ruling Provisional
Military Administrative Council.
Ethiopia was once an ally of the United
States. Western diplomatic sources say
about 1500 Soviet military and civilian ad
visers are in the country, together with
nearly 1000 East-bloc personnel and more
than 10.000 Cuban combat troops.
Soviets and East Europeans are
ensconced in key government ministries,
like defense, internal security and informa
tion. according to the sources. Moscow has
reportedly provided Ethiopia's 240,000-man
armed forces with about $2 billion worth of
equipment, including tanks, MiG jet
fighters and ultra-sophisticated Mi-24 heli
copter gunships equipped with armor plat
ing. machine guns and air-to-ground rock
ets.
"The key to the Soviet influence here is a
direct and symbiotic relationship with
Mengistu." says an informed diplomatic
source.
"It is not a question of Mengistu's being a
dedicated ideologue. He is a dedicated op

portunist who can only benefit and stay in
power through the Soviets." the diplomat
says.
"The Russians, for their part, enhance
their strategic position in the region." the
diplomat says.
The Soviets have apparently been long on
promises of economic help, but short on de
livery.
According to a survey in 1978. most of the
country's foreign development aid still
came irom the West and the Wcrld Bank
There are some East-bloc show projects —
a $2 million-dollar East German effort to
expand the Red Sea port of Assab and dona
tions of trucks and tractors, but little else
from the East.
"Ethiopia is an economic basket case,"
says a source. "Wars in Eritrea. Tigre and
the Ogaden are sapping the country of mon
ey and manpower and destroying Ethiopia's
infrastructure.
"Oh. the Soviets and other East-bloc
types donate trucks, tractors and machin
ery to Ethiopia, but Ethiopia must still buy
fuel to run them and spare parts for them
when they break down." he says. "They also
have to pay back at least half the Soviet mil
itary aid in hard currency."
