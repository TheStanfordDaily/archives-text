The word China engenders visions of rice
paddies, ancient temples and masses of Chi
nese citizens crowding streets Yet as
diplomatic and trade relations with China
improve, a part ot China unknown to Ameri
cans has begun to emerge
A group of 43 people, including a number
of Stanford students and professors, were
recently led on a trip within China to view
the culture firsthand
The three-week trip, from Aug 16 to Sept
5. was led by History Prof. Lyman Van
Slyke and Harold Kahn, associate professor
of history, and was the first University
travel group to include students as well as
alumni and friends.
Both Kahn and Van Slyke are Chinese his
torians whose first interest has always been
the study and investigation of China.
The trip, which was arranged through the
National Chinese Youth Association, began
in the city of Ouangzhou. continued through
Xian and Luovang in the Yellow River val
ley and ended at the Chinese capital. Beij
ing.
Kahn, who had never before visited the
mainland, was surprised by the enormous
size of China, and said he was frustrated
that he couldn't experience all of the vast
country.
Ron Lillejord. a student on the trip, com
mented on the vast amount of space be
tween the city and the countryside. "One of
our short trips to San Francisco would be
considered a major journey in China," he
said.
He added that he felt he had merely
scratched the surface of China by the end of
the journey. "You see only a few grains of
sand in a three-week trip." he said.
But the group soon grew accustomed to
the breadth of the country and began to ex
perience the personality and character of
its people.
The Chinese. Van Slyke explained, were
often very curious about Americans, but
always in a friendly way. "They would look
at our shoes, our clothes, our hair," he said.
Kahn cited Xian as his favorite city.
There, in the Xian Museum, he watched
three old countrywomen gaze in fascination

at the earrings of a young woman on the
tour
"There was a tenderness in their curiosi
ty. said Kahn
The knowledge of the Chinese varied
considerably." added Van Slyke. But most
of them, even the well-educated, had never
heard of Stanford University "
However. Van Slyke pointed out that the
well-educated and sophisticated Chinese
were accustomed to the presence of Ameri
cans and knew a good deal about the United
States
"I'm not sure that the average Chinese is
less informed about America than the aver
age American is about China. - ' concluded
Van Slvke
The curiosity of the Chinese was "some
times overwhelming.' said Lillejord. He
and another student Barbie Fields, were
once trapped by a group of hundreds of Chi
nese outside a museum
"We had left the museum to wander
through the plaza outside," Lillejord ex
plained. "and we decided to test our limited
knowledge of the language by conversing
with a few people in the plaza.
"Before Barbie could finish asking if any
one spoke English. we were surrounded by a
crowd of at least 100 people — all of them
talking non-stop in Chinese," said Lillejord.
"When we tried to explain that we only
knew a little of the language the crowd tri
pled and we found ourselves surrounded by
a friendly but closely packed group of chat
tering Chinese.
"Finally, we pushed our way through the
crowd and boarded a bus. They all stood si
lently and watched us for about 30 minutes
until the bus left."
Lillejord also commented on the knowl
edge the people had of current U.S. events.
"People who spoke English talked to us
about Ronald Reagan . . . they liked (Jim
my) Carter because he recognized China
. they knew that Carter wasn't popular
here."
Van Slyke pointed out that this knowledge
of outside affairs would have been unheard
of 20 years ago.
"You learn a lot about the U.S. bygoingto
China," he observed. "The trip jars one into

a degree of objectivity that allows one to see
our values and culture in a more realistic
light
Me concluded that "our particular values
as a country are by no means universal.
As the three-week journey continued,
group members began to assess its value
The trip was a reconfirmation of the
worth of studying Chinese history, ex
plained Kahn The land, the people and the
culture are all. even superficially, very
complex "
Lillejord saw the trip develop as one in
which it was important to take some
chances.
"The Chinese officials were very strict
about which families could entertain stu
dents in their homes, and if you wanted to
reallv experience the country and the peo
ple you had to get around this obstacle, he
said
Lillejord took one such chance when he
and a few friends traveled across town from
their hotel — wearing ponchos to cover their
American clothes — to listen to a secret con
cert of violins and an accordian
"You have to take the chance and find
people." he stressed, adding that the eve
ning listening to music was one of the most
memorable times of the trip
For Kahn. a memorable time in the early
part of the trip was an afternoon spent fish
ing with a few Chinese in a hot springs re
sort outside of Guangzhou "They used un
barbed hooks and were so patient." Kahn
said
Van Slyke commented that "In general.
China has progressed in recent years
the period of famine and insecurity of life is
ended the basic needs of the Chinese are
being taken care of.
"Considering that they have a population
five times that of the U.S.. this is an over
whelming accomplishment." he added.
Van Slyke. who has been to China four
times, empathized with the feelings of those
who were seeing the country for the first
time.
"I think China made an impact. . . sever
al people have decided to take Chinese lan
guage now . . and some even talk of going
back to China to teach English. "
