# War, economics and hostages big issues in televised debate
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Cleveland — President Jimmy
Carter repeatedly accused Ronald Re
agan of being "dangerous" last night
in a nationally televised debate, but
the Republican candidate responded
cooly and assailed Carter for his eco
nomic record and the hostage situ
ation in Iran.
Carter went on the attack almost
from the outset of the 90-minute de
bate and managed, for the most part,
to keep the focus off his own record
and on Reagan's past positions and
statements.
Several times Reagan protested
that the president was misrepresent
ing his position.
Reagan, although relatively re
strained in his attacks on Carter, hit
the president hard on his economic re
cord and said, "this idea which has
been spawned here in our country that
inflation somehow came upon us like a
plague, therefore it's uncontrollable

and no one can do anything about it. is
entirely spurious and it's dangerous to
say this to the people. - '
Carter described the control of nu
clear weapons as "the most important
single issue in the campaign" and said
Keagan had called for scrapping SALT
II in an effort to attain U.S. nuclear su
periority Reagan's position, the pres
ident said, is ' extremely dangerous
and belligerent in its tone, although
it's said with a quiet voice.''
Reagan protested that this was
"just not true,"' that he had not called
for nuclear superiority.
During the campaign, however. Re
agan has asserted that if the U.S. were
to enter the arms race — a race he
says that only the Soviet Union has
been competing in — the United States
would be in a better bargaining posi
tion on SALT and other negotiable is
sues with the Soviets.
Reagan himself appeared taken
aback by Carter's repeated attacks on

his SALT II position and the constant
bringing up of the possibility of nucle
ar war. And the GOP candidate's
aides clearly were stung by the at
tacks
Tom Evans, a Reagan adviser, said
later that it was outrageous that
Carter had misrepresented the former
California governor's position. Alex
ander Haig. former White House chief
of staff under President Nixon, said it
was "an atrocious thing for the presi
dent to exploit the public concern
about the danger of nucelar war'' by
criticizing Reagan's opposition to
SALT II

future would be like under his presi
dency."' Jody Powell, White House
