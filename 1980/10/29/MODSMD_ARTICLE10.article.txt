# New Japanese TV system allows home programming, broadcasting
##

Someday soon, you too may
be on television.
If a Japanese experimental
television company and its spon
sor. the Japanese Ministry of In
ternational Trade and Industry,
have their way, soon everyone
will be able to transmit his or
her face and voice over the air
waves, as well as be able to
select his or her own television
programming, and find out a va
riety of miscellaneous informa
tion kept on file.
Hi-OVIS ( Higashi-Ikoma Op
tical Visual Information Sys
tem) is the world's first visual
information system. The
project now includes 158 homes
in the Higashi-Ikoma district of
Japan.
But Dr Masahiro Kawahata.
the company's director, says
expansion plans are in the works
that will include the major
cities of Japan, though on a
simpler, more limited service.
"We have to make the system
simpler to make it economically
justifiable," he said.
The secret to the system has
been the replacement of co-ax
ial cables that transmit elec

trical impulses (like those used
by regular broadcast stations)
with optical fiber cables that
transmit light. These cables re
duce channel interference as
well as increase channel carry
ing capacities.
Each Hi-OVIS home has a tel
evision set. a camera, a micro
phone and a keyboard that are
used to create interactive com
munications.
By pushing buttons you can,
for example, find the train
schedule, call in an opinion to a
talk show, pick a television
show or broadcast yourself over
the air.
Communication between the
studios and the homes is in
creased. Not only can you see
broadcast programs, but people
on the air and other viewers can
see you. Earlier there had been
fears that this could be an in
vasion of privacy. But com
munication is only possible
when the home set is tuned in.
Kawahata claims that the
system gives a sense of com
munity through participation.
Not only can you sit at home and
make choices about existing
programming, but all people

are invited to try their hands at
producing local programs.
There is no equivalent system
currently in operation in the
United States. The existing Tel
etext system in Salt Lake City,
Utah, can only transmit printed
information to the homes and
can receive no added informa
tion from viewers. And the
QUBE cable system in Colum
bus, Ohio, can only send a lim
ited amount of printed informa
tion back to the studios and has
no audio or visual capacities.
There are questions about
whether such a visual system
can be profitable without gov
ernmental support. The project
is currently offered free to its
participants, but Kawahata
plans to charge about $20 per
month for each set. This price is
comparable to that of the spe
cial movie/sports services of
fered in this country.
In gauging what viewer reac
tion will be to the system and its
cost, Kawahata said that he
didn't know what the reaction
would be.
As of yet, neither the United
States government nor any

United States firm has ex
pressed a firm interest in the
project, though the French gov
ernment is now studying the
Japanese endeavor.
"We'll buy it if we get it."
speculated Dr Everett Rogers,
communiations professor.
"Some people think we should
have a Fa (Palo Alto)-OVIS."
he said.

Someday soon, you too may
be on television.
If a Japanese experimental
television company and its spon
sor. the Japanese Ministry of In
ternational Trade and Industry,
have their way, soon everyone
will be able to transmit his or
her face and voice over the air
waves, as well as be able to
select his or her own television
programming, and find out a va
riety of miscellaneous informa
tion kept on file.
Hi-OVIS ( Higashi-Ikoma Op
tical Visual Information Sys
tem) is the world's first visual
information system. The
project now includes 158 homes
in the Higashi-Ikoma district of
Japan.
But Dr Masahiro Kawahata.
the company's director, says
expansion plans are in the works
that will include the major
cities of Japan, though on a
simpler, more limited service.
"We have to make the system
simpler to make it economically
justifiable," he said.
The secret to the system has
been the replacement of co-ax
ial cables that transmit elec

trical impulses (like those used
by regular broadcast stations)
with optical fiber cables that
transmit light. These cables re
duce channel interference as
well as increase channel carry
ing capacities.
Each Hi-OVIS home has a tel
evision set. a camera, a micro
phone and a keyboard that are
used to create interactive com
munications.
By pushing buttons you can,
for example, find the train
schedule, call in an opinion to a
talk show, pick a television
show or broadcast yourself over
the air.
Communication between the
studios and the homes is in
creased. Not only can you see
broadcast programs, but people
on the air and other viewers can
see you. Earlier there had been
fears that this could be an in
vasion of privacy. But com
munication is only possible
when the home set is tuned in.
Kawahata claims that the
system gives a sense of com
munity through participation.
Not only can you sit at home and
make choices about existing
programming, but all people

are invited to try their hands at
producing local programs.
There is no equivalent system
currently in operation in the
United States. The existing Tel
etext system in Salt Lake City,
Utah, can only transmit printed
information to the homes and
can receive no added informa
tion from viewers. And the
QUBE cable system in Colum
bus, Ohio, can only send a lim
ited amount of printed informa
tion back to the studios and has
no audio or visual capacities.
There are questions about
whether such a visual system
can be profitable without gov
ernmental support. The project
is currently offered free to its
participants, but Kawahata
plans to charge about $20 per
month for each set. This price is
comparable to that of the spe
cial movie/sports services of
fered in this country.
In gauging what viewer reac
tion will be to the system and its
cost, Kawahata said that he
didn't know what the reaction
would be.
As of yet, neither the United
States government nor any

United States firm has ex
pressed a firm interest in the
project, though the French gov
ernment is now studying the
Japanese endeavor.
"We'll buy it if we get it."
speculated Dr Everett Rogers,
communiations professor.
"Some people think we should
have a Fa (Palo Alto)-OVIS."
he said.
