### Karen Halbo 
"Our society is based on an
ethic of consumption. We are
constantly bombarded with the
message to consume," said
Jane Eonda to the large student
audience at the University of
Santa Clara on Monday night.
Because of our consumption
ethic,"We are running out of all
the things we have come to de
pend on," Eonda explained.
Eonda's speech at the Univer
sity of Santa Clara was a fun
draiser for Students for Eco

nomic Democracy (SED), a stu
dent group affiliated with the
Campaign for Economic De
mocracy. (CED). Both SED and
CED are activist groups that be
lieve that in order for de
mocracy to work. people have to
have freedom in the economic
system equivalent to that guar
anteed them in the political sys
tem.
Fonda, who was introduced as
"an activist, and an actress who
is dedicated to making morally
and socially responsible mov

ies." spoke for an hour on a vari
ety of topics and answered ques
tions from the audience.
"What we have created is
beyond us. and beyond all the
experts," asserted Fonda, on
nuclear energy. "It's a violation
of essential balances of the
world."
"Nuclear power is the ul
timate alienation, it's a mon
ument to those who like to build
things they can't control." said
Fonda. "It is an unforgiving
technology."
Citing the incident at Three
Mile Island, and quoting the
head of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Governor
of Pennsylvania who described
themselves as"a couple of blind
men staggering around trying to
make decisions." Fonda said.
"It's a radioactive phallic night
mare."
"I support the gradual phas
ing out of nuclear energy as is
economically feasible. Fonda
stated. "People are frightened
to move away from nuclear
energy because they aren't
aware alternate energy sources
do work. "
"Look at Israel.'' Fonda ex
claimed. "There are solar
panels on all the roofs because

they knew they couldn't depend
on the Arabs, and had to be inde
pendent."
"When we want to. this coun
try can do anything it wants."
declared Fonda. "It took us 12
hours to mobilize troops for
Vietnam, and nine years to put
men on the moon We can de
velop solar, windmill,
geothermal and biomass
energy."
Americans can't depend on
big oil companies to develop
new sources, stated Fonda. She
cited the trolley tracks that had
existed in Los Angeles in the
19305, that were bought up and
destroyed by Harrv Chandler, of
the Goodyear Rubber Company,
and by other people with eco
nomic interests.
Continuing to comment on
problems existing in Los Angel
es. Fonda asked if anyone in the
audience had been in Los Angel
es during a smog alert.
I have an asthmatic son who
was passing out at school in the
same city on the same day
Ronald Reagan said air pollu
tion was no longer a problem,"
she said angrily, eliciting loud
applause from the audience.
