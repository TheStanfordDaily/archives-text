## Vote for measure C 
### 
Measure C — Yes
Measure C. the advisory vote on the San
ta Clara County ballot, asks voters if they
object to a peacetime military draft. This
measure deserves a yes vote, both as an
indication of objection to a peacetime con
scription and as a signal to administrators
and others that improving the current all
volunteer army is a preferable alter
native.
There has never been such an opportuni
ty for citizens to peacefully protest a
peacetime draft. A yes vote will alert leg
islators to the need (and public desire) for
development of viable defense alter
natives such as higher pay and increased
benefits for army personnel.
The major problem with this measure
is. however, the implications of the results
of the vote. Since the results will serve no
direct legislative purpose. Measure C is
little more than a glorified poll. And like
any poll, the results of this advisory vote
are subject to change. Therefore, by
pushing for this measure to be on the
ballot, the county Board of Supervisors
has implicitly acknowledged its responsi
bility to monitor voter sentiment in the
future, spending time and money which
might have been better spent on local is
sues over which the supervisors have
some control.
Because of the ambiguous nature of this
measure, the results may also turn into a
media event It is important to keep the is
sue in perspective, acknowledging the
moral nature of the question while realiz
ing that it involves only one county in Cali
fornia.
But it is also hoped that this measure
can be taken as a serious endeavor to
notify government administrators that
there should be other actions taken
besides resorting to a peacetime draft.
Proposition 7 — Yes
Though there is no longer any doubt that
the nation is faced with a serious energy
crisis, the question of which measures are
most appropriate to reduce our depen
dence on foreign oil and non-renewable
energy resources is still very much alive.
In Proposition 7. we see an important

step to remove a potential roadblock to so
lar energy installations. Proposition 13.
the tax revolt measure passed in June
1978. stipulated that houses' assessed val
ue would not change unless the house was
sold or renovated.
Prop. 7 would prevent houses from
being reassessed if the only change made
in the house was the installation of a solar
system This would eliminate a serious
disincentive to the retrofitting of houses
with solar energy systems. *
While the proposition may lead to a de
crease in property tax revenues, the prin
ciple behind it is that a conversion to re
newable energy resources is beneficial to
all of us and. more than that, is in
escapable.
Ordinances such as Santa Clara Coun
ty's. requiring the installation of solar
domestic hot water systems on all new
residential property and on all residential
property upon resale have been criticized
for pushing the long arm of the govern
ment too far into private life. Prop. 7, how
ever. much like California's 55 percent tax
credit on solar energy systems, does not
suffer from that drawback, and we whole
heartedly recommend a "yes" vote on it
Nov. 4.
Proposition 10 —No
The Daily recommends a "no" vote on
Proposition 10. the initiative which would
provide for designation of smoking and no
smoking sections in public facilities and
businesses.
While we agree with the objective of the
proponents, to provide a healthier en
vironment. those in favor of Prop. 10 are
essentially barking up the wrong tree.
We feel the anti-smoking movement can
effectively achieve its goals without drag
ging an already bloated government into
the melee. Considerable strides have been
made in this area, and we hope the propo
nents of Prop 10 will continue to attempt
to restrict those who foul the environment
with cigarette smoke.
However, we cannot side with their be
lief that the state should inject itself any
further into the private sector. The Daily
recommends a "no" vote on Proposition
10.

islators to the need (and public desire) for
development of viable defense alter
natives such as higher pay and increased
benefits for army personnel.
The major problem with this measure
is. however, the implications of the results
of the vote. Since the results will serve no
direct legislative purpose. Measure C is
little more than a glorified poll. And like
any poll, the results of this advisory vote
are subject to change. Therefore, by
pushing for this measure to be on the
ballot, the county Board of Supervisors
has implicitly acknowledged its responsi
bility to monitor voter sentiment in the
future, spending time and money which
might have been better spent on local is
sues over which the supervisors have
some control.
Because of the ambiguous nature of this
measure, the results may also turn into a
media event It is important to keep the is
sue in perspective, acknowledging the
moral nature of the question while realiz
ing that it involves only one county in Cali
fornia.
But it is also hoped that this measure
can be taken as a serious endeavor to
notify government administrators that
there should be other actions taken
besides resorting to a peacetime draft.
Proposition 7 — Yes
Though there is no longer any doubt that
the nation is faced with a serious energy
crisis, the question of which measures are
most appropriate to reduce our depen
dence on foreign oil and non-renewable
energy resources is still very much alive.
In Proposition 7. we see an important

step to remove a potential roadblock to so
lar energy installations. Proposition 13.
the tax revolt measure passed in June
1978. stipulated that houses' assessed val
ue would not change unless the house was
sold or renovated.
Prop. 7 would prevent houses from
being reassessed if the only change made
in the house was the installation of a solar
system This would eliminate a serious
disincentive to the retrofitting of houses
with solar energy systems. *
While the proposition may lead to a de
crease in property tax revenues, the prin
ciple behind it is that a conversion to re
newable energy resources is beneficial to
all of us and. more than that, is in
escapable.
Ordinances such as Santa Clara Coun
ty's. requiring the installation of solar
domestic hot water systems on all new
residential property and on all residential
property upon resale have been criticized
for pushing the long arm of the govern
ment too far into private life. Prop. 7, how
ever. much like California's 55 percent tax
credit on solar energy systems, does not
suffer from that drawback, and we whole
heartedly recommend a "yes" vote on it
Nov. 4.
Proposition 10 —No
The Daily recommends a "no" vote on
Proposition 10. the initiative which would
provide for designation of smoking and no
smoking sections in public facilities and
businesses.
While we agree with the objective of the
proponents, to provide a healthier en
vironment. those in favor of Prop. 10 are
essentially barking up the wrong tree.
We feel the anti-smoking movement can
effectively achieve its goals without drag
ging an already bloated government into
the melee. Considerable strides have been
made in this area, and we hope the propo
nents of Prop 10 will continue to attempt
to restrict those who foul the environment
with cigarette smoke.
However, we cannot side with their be
lief that the state should inject itself any
further into the private sector. The Daily
recommends a "no" vote on Proposition
10.
Measure C — Yes
Measure C. the advisory vote on the San
ta Clara County ballot, asks voters if they
object to a peacetime military draft. This
measure deserves a yes vote, both as an
indication of objection to a peacetime con
scription and as a signal to administrators
and others that improving the current all
volunteer army is a preferable alter
native.
There has never been such an opportuni
ty for citizens to peacefully protest a
peacetime draft. A yes vote will alert leg
islators to the need (and public desire) for
development of viable defense alter
natives such as higher pay and increased
benefits for army personnel.
