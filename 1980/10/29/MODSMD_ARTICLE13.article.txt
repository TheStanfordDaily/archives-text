## Nira Hativa Students still evaluate teachers best 
### 
Use of students' ratings in
assessing their teachers is com
plex and sensitive Since that
procedure was introduced, it
has raised considerable con
cern. criticism and opposition
bv some faculty members.
One of the major arguments
against it is that students who
judge desirable criteria of
"good teaching'' are immature
and lack long-term perspective.
Thus they cannot fully perceive
and evaluate good teaching.
To answer this, one should re
alize that students are in the
most advantageous position to
observe actual in-class ac
tivities. No one can evaluate the
teacher better than the stu
dents. as no one experiences the
teacher's work as fully, direct
ly. and personally as the teach
er's students. Therefore their
collective input should be used
as a legitimate source of in
formation when assessing the
teaching function.
Are college students mature
enough to make consistent
judgment of instruction? There
is a strong research evidence in
tens of studies done in univer
sities all over the U.S. that stu
dents' ratings are highly consis
tent and reliable.
In a study that I've conducted
during the last two years on the
teaching of undergraduate
mathematics at Stanford (by
TAs), scores on one question
naire (specific for that study)
taken in the mid-quarter were
highly correlated (Pearson
H0.861 with scores on another
questionnaire (ASSU> taken at
the end of that quarter, by the
same students.
Also, ratings of the same
teacher in different classes in
two different quarters, were

pretty highly correlated i9.76).
although the ratings were done
by different groups of students.
This was true except for inex
perienced teachers who im
proved significantly their mean
ratings after one quarter of
teaching
The high consistency and re
liability of students' ratings pro
vides evidence of students abil
ity to distinguish reliably
among different instructors and
different dimensions of
teaching performance.
Another major concern for
the use of students' ratings, is
their validity, i.e.. do the rat
ings measure what they are sup
posed to measure, which is the
quality of teaching.
One aspect of this question is:
are students' ratings of their
teachers influenced by factors
other than effective teaching?
These might be factors that are
beyond instructor control â€”
such as students' sex, major,
year at college, course level,
class size and whether the
course is required or elected.
These factors might also be
irrelevant teacher variables
such as teacher's sex. popu
larity in extra-class activities,
competence in research (publi
cations and reputation I. teach
er's academic status, or popu
larity acquired by awarding stu
dents undeservedly high grades
or by entertaining lessons.
Most of the research evidence
pertaining to this point in
dicates that students' ratings of
teachers are indeed uncor
rected with these presumably
irrelevant variables, and that
the criteria used by students in
their ratings of instructors have
much more to do with the quali
ty of the presentation of the ma

terial than with any of the com
bined effects of those irrelevant
variables
The more basic criterion of
the validity of students ratings
is how much students have
learned Are highly rated teach
ers those from whom students
learn most? Almost all the stud
ies that investigated this ques
tion compared ratings of teach
ers in multisection courses,
with students' achievements on
a common final test (with some
kinds of adjustments).
In two recent literature re
views (Feldman 1976; Fox and
Ed wall 1979i it has been found
that the correlations between
teacher ratings and students
performance on tests tend to be
positive and range from low to
medium in magnitude, This of
fers some support for the validi
ty of students' ratings as in
dicators of how much students
have learned.
But. one should be aware of
the fact that knowledge ac
quired by students during a
course does not reflect solely
what they have learned from
their teachers in classes.
Besides the teacher, college stu
dents use other sources of learn
ing such as textbooks and tutor
ing. 1 believe that students in
deed learn more during class
time from teachers that they
rate high than from low-rated
teachers, and that students
compensate for the inap
propriate teaching by working
harder and getting more help
outside class.
Indeed, students who rated
their teacher low. when asked
(in my questionnaire i to explain
their ratings, supported the no
tion that they didn't gain much
during class time, or as two stu
dents put it: "Basically, class
time is useless and more can be
gained from reading the text for
half an hour than studying in
class for a week," and "If I
could teach myself, I would
have been an encyclopedia and
wouldn't have to pay this out
rageous tuition."
If loss of time and more stu
dents' efforts were the only re
sult of ineffective teaching, then
many teachers would see it as
an advantage. Unfortunately,
there are some other side ef
fects . When I asked Stanford un
dergraduate students to list ef
fects of having an ineffective
mathematics teacher, most of
them pointed out decrease in
motivation and attitudes
towards learning of math, de
crease in self-confidence, and
increase of anxiety during the
course.
Going back to the first point of
objection to students' ratings. I
believe that the argument of
students' lack of perspective to
evaluate teaching stems from
the discrepancy between stu
dents' and faculty perceptions
of objectives of teaching.
This kind of discrepancy has
been identified in studies that

investigated this point. The tHi
dings of these studies point nut
that even if they state different
ly. students rate their teachers
mainly on their ability to trans
mit knowledge in an interesting,
clear manner which is easy to
understand and to remember
Analyzing almost all ASSI'
questionnaires done for regular
undergraduate mathematics
classes during the last two
years. 1 have found that the ma
jor items "students' course sat
isfaction" and "instructor's ov
erall performance" when com
pared with all other items on
that questionnaire, were
highest correlated with the
items: instructor's "clarity of
presentation" (0.981, and in
structor's "preparation" (0.961.
These correlations are so high
that one can say that students
identify good teaching with
teacher clarity and preparation
Similar findings have been re
ported in many studies that in
vestigated this question It
proves that students in different
courses, in different subject
matters. in different colleges
and even different countries
evaluate teachers according to
a similar underlying conception
of what good teaching is. and
that lesson clarity along with a
few other factors are well
agreed upon major measures of
good teaching.
To conclude: I believe that
undergraduate students deserve
to get good teaching as they per
ceive it. Working on my study
I've learned that the TAs (and
faculty) are really willing to
provide good teaching and many
of them go to great efforts to ob
tain that. But they are very busy
in taking their own courses and
in other professional matters
and cannot allocate too much
time to preparing their presen
tations.
The logical solution is the
training of TAs to prepare effec
tive lessons (in accordance with
students' criteria), in minimal
time. This may sound like an
Utopia, but efforts should be
directed to obtain this goal.
Students' evaluations of
teachers bear a very important
role for the improvement of
teaching and should be adminis
tered at least twice in a quarter
using the same questionnaire:
the first after three to four
weeks of teaching, to be
analyzed by the teacher solely
to obtain feedback on the
dimensions that should be im
proved. and the second time
about a week before the end of
the quarter, when most of the
students are still attending the
class, for the information of the
teacher and the head of the de
partment or another faculty re
sponsible for undergraduate
teaching.

undergraduate students deserve
to get good teaching as they per
ceive it. Working on my study
I've learned that the TAs (and
faculty) are really willing to
provide good teaching and many
of them go to great efforts to ob
tain that. But they are very busy
in taking their own courses and
in other professional matters
and cannot allocate too much
time to preparing their presen
tations.
The logical solution is the
training of TAs to prepare effec
tive lessons (in accordance with
students' criteria), in minimal
time. This may sound like an
Utopia, but efforts should be
directed to obtain this goal.
Students' evaluations of
teachers bear a very important
role for the improvement of
teaching and should be adminis
tered at least twice in a quarter
using the same questionnaire:
the first after three to four
weeks of teaching, to be
analyzed by the teacher solely
to obtain feedback on the
dimensions that should be im
proved. and the second time
about a week before the end of
the quarter, when most of the
students are still attending the
class, for the information of the
teacher and the head of the de
partment or another faculty re
sponsible for undergraduate
teaching.
(Nirn Hativa is completing her
doctorate degree in math
education. She is involved in a

Use of students' ratings in
assessing their teachers is com
plex and sensitive Since that
procedure was introduced, it
has raised considerable con
cern. criticism and opposition
bv some faculty members.
One of the major arguments
against it is that students who
judge desirable criteria of
"good teaching'' are immature
and lack long-term perspective.
Thus they cannot fully perceive
and evaluate good teaching.
To answer this, one should re
alize that students are in the
most advantageous position to
observe actual in-class ac
tivities. No one can evaluate the
teacher better than the stu
dents. as no one experiences the
teacher's work as fully, direct
ly. and personally as the teach
er's students. Therefore their
collective input should be used
as a legitimate source of in
formation when assessing the
teaching function.
Are college students mature
enough to make consistent
judgment of instruction? There
is a strong research evidence in
tens of studies done in univer
sities all over the U.S. that stu
dents' ratings are highly consis
tent and reliable.
In a study that I've conducted
during the last two years on the
teaching of undergraduate
mathematics at Stanford (by
TAs), scores on one question
naire (specific for that study)
taken in the mid-quarter were
highly correlated (Pearson
H0.861 with scores on another
questionnaire (ASSU> taken at
the end of that quarter, by the
same students.
Also, ratings of the same
teacher in different classes in
two different quarters, were

pretty highly correlated i9.76).
although the ratings were done
by different groups of students.
This was true except for inex
perienced teachers who im
proved significantly their mean
ratings after one quarter of
teaching
The high consistency and re
liability of students' ratings pro
vides evidence of students abil
ity to distinguish reliably
among different instructors and
different dimensions of
teaching performance.
Another major concern for
the use of students' ratings, is
their validity, i.e.. do the rat
ings measure what they are sup
posed to measure, which is the
quality of teaching.
One aspect of this question is:
are students' ratings of their
teachers influenced by factors
other than effective teaching?
These might be factors that are
beyond instructor control â€”
such as students' sex, major,
year at college, course level,
class size and whether the
course is required or elected.
These factors might also be
irrelevant teacher variables
such as teacher's sex. popu
larity in extra-class activities,
competence in research (publi
cations and reputation I. teach
er's academic status, or popu
larity acquired by awarding stu
dents undeservedly high grades
or by entertaining lessons.
Most of the research evidence
pertaining to this point in
dicates that students' ratings of
teachers are indeed uncor
rected with these presumably
irrelevant variables, and that
the criteria used by students in
their ratings of instructors have
much more to do with the quali
ty of the presentation of the ma

terial than with any of the com
bined effects of those irrelevant
variables
The more basic criterion of
the validity of students ratings
is how much students have
learned Are highly rated teach
ers those from whom students
learn most? Almost all the stud
ies that investigated this ques
tion compared ratings of teach
ers in multisection courses,
with students' achievements on
a common final test (with some
kinds of adjustments).
In two recent literature re
views (Feldman 1976; Fox and
Ed wall 1979i it has been found
that the correlations between
teacher ratings and students
performance on tests tend to be
positive and range from low to
medium in magnitude, This of
fers some support for the validi
ty of students' ratings as in
dicators of how much students
have learned.
But. one should be aware of
the fact that knowledge ac
quired by students during a
course does not reflect solely
what they have learned from
their teachers in classes.
Besides the teacher, college stu
dents use other sources of learn
ing such as textbooks and tutor
ing. 1 believe that students in
deed learn more during class
time from teachers that they
rate high than from low-rated
teachers, and that students
compensate for the inap
propriate teaching by working
harder and getting more help
outside class.
Indeed, students who rated
their teacher low. when asked
(in my questionnaire i to explain
their ratings, supported the no
tion that they didn't gain much
during class time, or as two stu
dents put it: "Basically, class
time is useless and more can be
gained from reading the text for
half an hour than studying in
class for a week," and "If I
could teach myself, I would
have been an encyclopedia and
wouldn't have to pay this out
rageous tuition."
If loss of time and more stu
dents' efforts were the only re
sult of ineffective teaching, then
many teachers would see it as
an advantage. Unfortunately,
there are some other side ef
fects . When I asked Stanford un
dergraduate students to list ef
fects of having an ineffective
mathematics teacher, most of
them pointed out decrease in
motivation and attitudes
towards learning of math, de
crease in self-confidence, and
increase of anxiety during the
course.
Going back to the first point of
objection to students' ratings. I
believe that the argument of
students' lack of perspective to
evaluate teaching stems from
the discrepancy between stu
dents' and faculty perceptions
of objectives of teaching.
This kind of discrepancy has
been identified in studies that

investigated this point. The tHi
dings of these studies point nut
that even if they state different
ly. students rate their teachers
mainly on their ability to trans
mit knowledge in an interesting,
clear manner which is easy to
understand and to remember
Analyzing almost all ASSI'
questionnaires done for regular
undergraduate mathematics
classes during the last two
years. 1 have found that the ma
jor items "students' course sat
isfaction" and "instructor's ov
erall performance" when com
pared with all other items on
that questionnaire, were
highest correlated with the
items: instructor's "clarity of
presentation" (0.981, and in
structor's "preparation" (0.961.
These correlations are so high
that one can say that students
identify good teaching with
teacher clarity and preparation
Similar findings have been re
ported in many studies that in
vestigated this question It
proves that students in different
courses, in different subject
matters. in different colleges
and even different countries
evaluate teachers according to
a similar underlying conception
of what good teaching is. and
that lesson clarity along with a
few other factors are well
agreed upon major measures of
good teaching.
To conclude: I believe that
undergraduate students deserve

This kind of discrepancy has
been identified in studies that

investigated this point. The tHi
dings of these studies point nut
that even if they state different
ly. students rate their teachers
mainly on their ability to trans
mit knowledge in an interesting,
clear manner which is easy to
understand and to remember
Analyzing almost all ASSI'
questionnaires done for regular
undergraduate mathematics
classes during the last two
years. 1 have found that the ma
jor items "students' course sat
isfaction" and "instructor's ov
erall performance" when com
pared with all other items on
that questionnaire, were
highest correlated with the
items: instructor's "clarity of
presentation" (0.981, and in
structor's "preparation" (0.961.
These correlations are so high
that one can say that students
identify good teaching with
teacher clarity and preparation
Similar findings have been re
ported in many studies that in
vestigated this question It
proves that students in different
courses, in different subject
matters. in different colleges
and even different countries
evaluate teachers according to
a similar underlying conception
of what good teaching is. and
that lesson clarity along with a
few other factors are well
agreed upon major measures of
good teaching.
To conclude: I believe that
undergraduate students deserve
to get good teaching as they per
ceive it. Working on my study
I've learned that the TAs (and
faculty) are really willing to
provide good teaching and many
of them go to great efforts to ob
tain that. But they are very busy
in taking their own courses and
in other professional matters
and cannot allocate too much
time to preparing their presen
tations.
The logical solution is the
training of TAs to prepare effec
tive lessons (in accordance with
students' criteria), in minimal
time. This may sound like an
Utopia, but efforts should be
directed to obtain this goal.
Students' evaluations of
teachers bear a very important
role for the improvement of
teaching and should be adminis
tered at least twice in a quarter
using the same questionnaire:
the first after three to four
weeks of teaching, to be
analyzed by the teacher solely
to obtain feedback on the
dimensions that should be im
proved. and the second time
about a week before the end of
the quarter, when most of the
students are still attending the
class, for the information of the
teacher and the head of the de
partment or another faculty re
sponsible for undergraduate
teaching.

Use of students' ratings in
assessing their teachers is com
plex and sensitive Since that
procedure was introduced, it
has raised considerable con
cern. criticism and opposition
bv some faculty members.
One of the major arguments
against it is that students who
judge desirable criteria of
"good teaching'' are immature
and lack long-term perspective.
Thus they cannot fully perceive
and evaluate good teaching.
To answer this, one should re
alize that students are in the
most advantageous position to
observe actual in-class ac
tivities. No one can evaluate the
teacher better than the stu
dents. as no one experiences the
teacher's work as fully, direct
ly. and personally as the teach
er's students. Therefore their
collective input should be used
as a legitimate source of in
formation when assessing the
teaching function.
Are college students mature
enough to make consistent
judgment of instruction? There
is a strong research evidence in
tens of studies done in univer
sities all over the U.S. that stu
dents' ratings are highly consis
tent and reliable.
In a study that I've conducted
during the last two years on the
teaching of undergraduate
mathematics at Stanford (by
TAs), scores on one question
naire (specific for that study)
taken in the mid-quarter were
highly correlated (Pearson
H0.861 with scores on another
questionnaire (ASSU> taken at
the end of that quarter, by the
same students.
Also, ratings of the same
teacher in different classes in
two different quarters, were

pretty highly correlated i9.76).
although the ratings were done
by different groups of students.
This was true except for inex
perienced teachers who im
proved significantly their mean
ratings after one quarter of
teaching
The high consistency and re
liability of students' ratings pro
vides evidence of students abil
ity to distinguish reliably
among different instructors and
different dimensions of
teaching performance.
Another major concern for
the use of students' ratings, is
their validity, i.e.. do the rat
ings measure what they are sup
posed to measure, which is the
quality of teaching.
One aspect of this question is:
are students' ratings of their
teachers influenced by factors
other than effective teaching?
These might be factors that are
beyond instructor control â€”
such as students' sex, major,
year at college, course level,
class size and whether the
course is required or elected.
These factors might also be
irrelevant teacher variables
such as teacher's sex. popu
larity in extra-class activities,
competence in research (publi
cations and reputation I. teach
er's academic status, or popu
larity acquired by awarding stu
dents undeservedly high grades
or by entertaining lessons.
Most of the research evidence
pertaining to this point in
dicates that students' ratings of
teachers are indeed uncor
rected with these presumably
irrelevant variables, and that
the criteria used by students in
their ratings of instructors have
much more to do with the quali
ty of the presentation of the ma

terial than with any of the com
bined effects of those irrelevant
variables
The more basic criterion of
the validity of students ratings
is how much students have
learned Are highly rated teach
ers those from whom students
learn most? Almost all the stud
ies that investigated this ques
tion compared ratings of teach
ers in multisection courses,
with students' achievements on
a common final test (with some
kinds of adjustments).
In two recent literature re
views (Feldman 1976; Fox and
Ed wall 1979i it has been found
that the correlations between
teacher ratings and students
performance on tests tend to be
positive and range from low to
medium in magnitude, This of
fers some support for the validi
ty of students' ratings as in
dicators of how much students
have learned.
But. one should be aware of
the fact that knowledge ac
quired by students during a
course does not reflect solely
what they have learned from
their teachers in classes.
Besides the teacher, college stu
dents use other sources of learn
ing such as textbooks and tutor
ing. 1 believe that students in
deed learn more during class
time from teachers that they
rate high than from low-rated
teachers, and that students
compensate for the inap
propriate teaching by working
harder and getting more help
outside class.
Indeed, students who rated
their teacher low. when asked
(in my questionnaire i to explain
their ratings, supported the no
tion that they didn't gain much
during class time, or as two stu
dents put it: "Basically, class
time is useless and more can be
gained from reading the text for
half an hour than studying in
class for a week," and "If I
could teach myself, I would
have been an encyclopedia and
wouldn't have to pay this out
rageous tuition."
If loss of time and more stu
dents' efforts were the only re
sult of ineffective teaching, then
many teachers would see it as
an advantage. Unfortunately,
there are some other side ef
fects . When I asked Stanford un
dergraduate students to list ef
fects of having an ineffective
mathematics teacher, most of
them pointed out decrease in
motivation and attitudes
towards learning of math, de
crease in self-confidence, and
increase of anxiety during the
course.
Going back to the first point of
objection to students' ratings. I
believe that the argument of
students' lack of perspective to
evaluate teaching stems from
the discrepancy between stu
dents' and faculty perceptions
of objectives of teaching.
This kind of discrepancy has
been identified in studies that
