## Political 'rights' aren't always right 
### 
Talk to just about anybody on
just about any social or political
issue these days, and invariably
the subject of "rights" comes
up. Not surprisingly, the rights
mentioned tend to be those
which the groups supporting the
speaker's position claim to be
trying to protect or assert.
Americans have developed a
predisposition to couching their
discussion of all issues, impor
tant and unimportant, in terms
of "rights." This predisposition
reflects a misunderstanding of
the nature of rights and the role
they play in the political arena.
The increasing prevalence of
this predisposition and the force
with which it shapes and con
fines political debate threatens
to erode the notion of rights into
little more than an argument
about who gets what in the polit
ical system.
To be sure, there is an under
standable temptation to argue
that a contrary position violates
the rights of some individual or
group. A right is something that
is fundamental, inalienable, un
challengeable. something that
inheres in the very fabric of the
universe.
Who would not seek to support
a position with a principle God
given and absolute? Semantic
confusion probably aids this nat
ural temptation. After all,
"rights" are "right," they are
true and correct visions of reali
ty. Therefore, if you are on the

"right" side of an issue, there
must be some "right" that you
are advancing or protecting.
This inversion is neither
linguistically nor logically justi
fied. but such trivial considera
tions seldom limit the appeal of
a conveniently potent style of
argument.
The implication is that all
questions ought to be discussed
not in terms of the utility and
equity of the competing posi
tions. but in terms of principles
immutable and absolute. A re
cent San Francisco court case
turned on the question of the in
heritance rights of a pet dog
when its owner dies. The dog
won a large settlement.
A more modest people might
hesitate to invoke such author
ity on any issues but those that
directly affect the core of values
around which the community is
organized. Americans, how
ever. have been dispossessed of
this compunction by the curious
confluence of a secular, demo
cratic conception of ultimate
moral as well as political au
thority with a media-conscious
attitude towards style that
decries subtlety.
Interest groups realize that to
appeal to a largely disinterested
audience they must phrase all
issues in earth-shaking, if not
cosmic, terms. Speaking of a po
litical issue in terms of rights is
no more than a self-righteous af
firmation that vox Populi est

vox Dei
The problem with this ap
proach, of course, is that the
world is wonderfully complex.
Issues are seldom reducible to
matters of absolute right vs.
absolute wrong. All that can
consistently and reasonably be
said is that competing positions
will affect different values and
interests in different ways. In
far too many situations, phras
ing issues in terms of rights re
tards rather than advances the
intelligent resolution of con
troversy. Most questions can be
resolved on policy grounds more
efficiently and no less justly.
One example is the frequently
discussed motorcycle helmet
law. Does it really help to see
the issue as the right of riders to
decide whether or not to wear a
helmet vs. the right of tax
payers to not have to pay for
scraping any more insensate
bodies off the highway than
absolutely necessary?
Balancing considerations of
safety achieved vs. penalty im
posed seem a more likely ave
nue for apassionate analysis.
Similarly, is it really necessary
to talk about "tenant's rights"
when requiring apartment
building landlords to install
smoke alarms or sprinkler sys
tems? This question is more
easily — and more properly —
the subject of a policy dis
cussion. not a moral proclama
tion

Even in issues that involve
significant moral questions, a
rights-oriented debate tends
more to create two separate and
hostile groups than contribute to
the resolution of difficult human
problems.
Abortion is one of the more
visible such issues today. The is
sue has been painted in terms of
the right of unborn children to
life vs. the right of women to ex
ercise reproductive freedom
without government interven
tion. Assertion of either pre
mise as absolute precludes all
compromise on an issue where
reason ought to weigh carefully
the values and interests served
by all available options.
There is no denying that some
issues must be discussed in
terms that harken to the notion
of a right as something absolute,
something complete unto itself
yet part and parcel of our socie
ty and our humanity. But there
is no reason we have to say "It
has to be this way" when what
we really mean is "We want it to
be this way."
Helving on a concept properly
applied to whatever is given by
God. nature and history is just
another way of evading the re
sponsibility of making a rea
soned. intelligent choice.
The American political sys
tem is to be respected when it
rises to the defense of human
and civil rights, of Bill of Bights
affirmations of fundamental

freedoms. But when it discusses
more and more issues in terms
of "rights." it should be re
focused and changed And when
it can't settle estate issues
without referring to the in
heritance rights of pet dogs, it is
to be ridiculed
