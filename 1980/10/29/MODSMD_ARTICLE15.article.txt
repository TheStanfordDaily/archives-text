Reality politics?
If Robert Greenberg's col
umn ("An American take-over
would be best," Daily, Oct. 23)
was meant as a joke, it was cer
tainly in bad taste. If, in fact, his
argument advocating a U.S.
takeover of Saudi Arabia was
seriously intended, the column
stands as representative of a
drastically ignorant and naive
point of view.
In advocating this U.S.
Middle-Eastern annexation (by
force if necessary), Greenberg
blissfully ignores the require
ments and consequences of such
a takeover: a massive and con
spicuous U.S. troop movement
into this extremely sensitive oil
producing area and the un
doubted political if not military
confrontation with the Soviet
Union which would thus result.
Simply stated, Greenberg sug
gests that the U.S. risk the pos
sibility of nuclear war.
On another level, what right
does the U.S. have to invade a
sovereign state, especially one
of the few OPEC nations that
consistantlv presses for low
world prices on crude oil? How
can we. as Americans, morally
sanction a U.S. military
takeover essentially no dif
ferent than that of the Soviet
move into Afghanistan?
In an alternative to an armed
attack, Greenberg speaks of the
possibility of an "easy" ClA
sponsored revolution against
the royal family, but fails to ad
dress the problem of the domi
nantly anti-Western sentiments
of the largest anti-government
religious and political groups in
Saudi Arabia.
In correcting Greenberg's
specious arguments, I would of
fer this statement: An Ameri
can takeover would be worst.
I am thankful only that
Greenberg is listed as a
freshman. He still has time at
this University to learn some
thing of the realities of world
politics.
