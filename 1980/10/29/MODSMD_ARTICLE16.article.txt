# Endorsements

### 
The Daily will be publishing its endorsements of local, state
and national candidates and ballot measures during the rest
of this week, culminating in our presidential endorsement in
tomorrow's Stanford Daily Magazine. Members of the Stan
ford community are welcome to respond. Contributions
should be typed, double-spaced, on a 57-space line, and should
be brought or mailed to the Daily offices.
