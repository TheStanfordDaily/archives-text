# Energy industry strikes it rich

### Los Angeles Times 
Washington President Jimmy Carter is always beating us
up in his speeches, but he has been a good friend'of the oil in
dustry , a lobbyist for one of the giant oil comp inies said recent
ly. President }Â«ord used to say all the right things we like to
hear, but he didn't do much."
Which just goes to show, the lobbyist concluded, that where
energy policy is concerned, party labels aren't very signifi
cant.''
When the haze of campaign rhetoric is blown away, Carter and
his Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, disagree about some
of the more esoteric and long-range questions, but they have the
same view on the most basic energy issue of all the question of
prices. Both men believe that Americans must pay more for
gasoline, heating oil, jet fuel and the myriad products manufac
tured from petroleum.
According to the doctrine of classical economics, higher
prices will cut the nation s appetite for foreign oil, while simul
taneously encouraging the search for new oil an<: gas fields in the
United States.
Acting against the wishes of a majority of : lis own party in
Congress, Carter adopted the classical approach in June 1979
when he began removing federal price controls on crude oil
pumped in the United States. Some U.S. oil that has been selling
for $6.50 a barrel will reach the world price of $36 a barrel or
more when all controls are abolished in September of next year.
Carter says that because the abolition of pnce controls will
give the oil companies additional revenues of more than $900
billion over the next decade, he persuaded ('ongi ess to levy a tax
to capture some of the "windfall" in earnings. The new tax will
take $227 billion from oil companies and royalty owners and fun
nel the money to Washington.
Reagan opposes the tax. saying it will discourage oil prod
uction. but he is not likely to work for repeal of the levy.
John Anderson, the independent candidate, gained con
siderable publicity early this year when he proposed an unusual
new energy policy: a 50-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline. The high
tax would cut demand for gasoline, and the revenues could be
used to reduce Social Security taxes. Anderson said.
His proposal got a very cool reception. Congress has always
balked at raising gasoline taxes.
