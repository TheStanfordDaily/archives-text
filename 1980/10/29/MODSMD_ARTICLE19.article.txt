## Racial murder tests new death penalty law 
### Los Angeles Times 
Oakland — In 1978, California
voters approved a new. tougher
death penalty law. expanding
the circumstances in which con
victed murder ers could be sent
to the gas chamber.
Almost unnoticed was a novel
provision permitting capital
punishment for murders com
mitted because of the victim's
race, religion, nationality or
country of origin. Authorities
say it appears to be the only
such provision in effect in any
state.

Now. after two years, the
charge is about to be tested for
the first time at trial. A 33-vear
old white woman is scheduled to
go on trial here M .day for the
killing of a five-year-old black
boy she allegedly kidnapped,
strangled and buried in a shal
low ditch last February
The woman. Darlin .June
Cromer, a former nurse and
mental patient, is accused of the
murder of Reginald Larnon Wil
liams The child was killed, the
prosecution charges, "because
of his race and color "

The case is being watched
closely by prosecutors and de
fense attorneys, anxious to see
how a jury reacts to the pros
pect of imposing the death pen
alty for racially motivated
murder and how appellate
courts ultimately may assess its
constitutionality
Vague law
But some death penalty oppo
nents sav that they expect that
the charge will be difficult to
prove in court and that even
when it is upheld at trial it may
well not survive judicial review

on appeal
Henry Schwarzschild. direc
tor of.the Capital Punishment
Project of the American Civil
Liberties Union in New York,
calls the wording of the law
"almost crazily vague."
I'm quite confident Califor
nia is the only state, among the
37 states that now have death
penalty statutes, with such a
provision.'' he says.
Michael Millman. a deputy
state public defender special
izing in capital cases, predicts
the charge will be brought infre
quently. "There's likely to be a
large problem of proof."
Millman says. "... For exam
ple. there might be a racial
epithet or some pejorative
thrown at the victim — but
that's certainly not enough to
support the death penalty."
Civil rights laws
Proposition 7. an initiative,
passed overwhelmingly in Cali
fornia in November 1978 The
measure revised existing stat
utes to conform with court-iin
posed guidelines for considering
mitigating and aggravating cir
cumstances. increased the pen
alties for first- and second
degree murder: and added to
the list of murders subject to the
death penalty or life in prison

without parole among them
murder for hire, murder in the
commission of kidnapping and
other serious crimes, murder by
ambush and murder based on
the victim's race, religion, na
tionality or country of origin
The provision for death in ra
cially motivated murders drew
little attention Donald Heller, a
Sacramento lawyer and former
I'.S. attorney who drafted the
measure, says the provision was
based on language found in fed
eral civil rights law
"We just added teeth to it to
provide for state prosecutions in
murders." Heller recalls. "We
felt it was a particularly heinous
kind of crime to kill on the basis
of race or religion "
The issue neared emergence
in one instance earlier this year
in a notorious case in Oroville.
Calif., in which two white men
were accused of the random
murder of a black man. Author
ities said the two whites, drink
ing liquor and smoking mari
juana. had been frustrated in
their hunt for deer and had de
cided to shoot a black person in
stead But the case never came
to trial The two men pleaded
guilty, to avoid facing the death
penalty, and were sentenced to
25 vears to life in orison

Oakland — In 1978, California
voters approved a new. tougher
death penalty law. expanding
the circumstances in which con
victed murder ers could be sent
to the gas chamber.
Almost unnoticed was a novel
provision permitting capital
punishment for murders com
mitted because of the victim's
race, religion, nationality or
country of origin. Authorities
say it appears to be the only
such provision in effect in any
state.

Now. after two years, the
charge is about to be tested for
the first time at trial. A 33-vear
old white woman is scheduled to
go on trial here M .day for the
killing of a five-year-old black
boy she allegedly kidnapped,
strangled and buried in a shal
low ditch last February

Cromer, a former nurse and
mental patient, is accused of the
murder of Reginald Larnon Wil
liams The child was killed, the
prosecution charges, "because
of his race and color "

The case is being watched
closely by prosecutors and de
fense attorneys, anxious to see
how a jury reacts to the pros
pect of imposing the death pen
alty for racially motivated
murder and how appellate
courts ultimately may assess its
constitutionality
