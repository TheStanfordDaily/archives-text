# Couple's work benefits African villagers
## 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
In May of 1977, Barbara and
Targe Lindsay decided to leave
Palo Alto's suburbia and try
something different They
joined the Peace Corps and
served nearly three years in
West Africa
"We had both been pretty
sheltered." said Targe "We
were thrilled at the possibility
of seeing another part of the
world — especially Africa."
Peace Corps volunteers can
indicate a preference for loca
tion — which country, and either
a rural or urban setting. The
Lindsays chose Africa and re
ceived 44 months ot training
for an agricultural assignment
in Mali
The couple's training took
place both in American and
Chad. "Our 2 a.m. arrival in
Chad was like something out of a
Humphrey Bogart movie -
complete with a humid, mys
terious fog." said Targe Dusty
streets and squawking chickens
greeted them the following
morning.
"There is no way to prepare
for the adjustment," he said.
"Until you go to the well and
hoist up the two buckets of wa
ter rationed to you each day.
boil the water walk to the mar
ket. and exist on dates, bread,
lamb and onions day after day.
vou can't begin to know what it
will be like
The role of the Peace Corps in
Mali was to develop agricultur
al skills, introduce new vegeta
bles. develop seed production

and raise nutritional levels But
after 10 months, the program
fell through The problem was
mainly logistics and bad timing
in terms of the season we ar
rived." Targe said
The Lindsays were re
assigned in September of 1978 to
the Ivory Coast Their main task
was to organize and develop
tiading cooperatives in the
Dioula weaving villages in the
north of the country.
Although they were the first
white people to spend time in
the Dioula village, the Lindsays
felt accepted immediately.
French and Dioula were our
working languages, but we
found a smile always went a
long way to bridge any com
munication gaps," Targe said
The Lindsays shared their
handicraft skills with the com
munity. and showed the people
of Dioula that thev could use
native materials to increase
trade for the village.
Previously, the women would
spend a week making two
prayer caps that sold for the
equivalent of $1 each. Barbara
showed the village women how
to make a skirt. which could be
sold for $37.50. in the same
amount of time. This increased
each woman's weekly income
between $13 and $20.
"The dramatic increase in
tht woman's earning potential
caused some ripples in the vil
lage," Targe said In some
cases, the women were bringing
home more income than the
men.

"They kidded a lot. but the
men may have felt threatened."
he said However, the men were
also taught skills that helped to
increase their earnings, he
added
With their additional wealth,
the villagers began building new
houses and improved their over
all standard of living — espe

ciallv in terms of material
goods such as livestock,
mopeds. radios, wrist watches
and clothing
The Africans were especially
interested in increasing the vol
ume of trade for their village
Upon their arrival, the Lindsays
found a sign war going on be
tween the Dioula people and a

! nearby village competing for
trade
Signs directing traffic from
the nearest town to the villages
were posted every day. only to
disappear each night." Targe
recalled "Eventually we
worked out a settlement that
provided for a communal sign,
made out of metal and sunk in

cement."
The Lindsays said they never
felt threatened by political in
stability of neighboring coun
tries "There was a revolution
in Chad, and (ihana and Liberia
fell We never felt uncom
fortable. but we had friends in
Chad who had to get out. " Targe
explained.
The American hostages were
seized in Iran while the
Lindsays were working in the
Ivory Coast. "The Dioula vil
lagers were Muslim, but they
made a great effort to show
their disapproval of the hostage
situation and to distinguish
themselves (Black Muslims)
from Arab Muslims." he said.
The Lindsay's diet in the
Ivory Coast was more liberal
than in Mali. They had fresh
truit and vegetables, including
pineapple, papaya, lettuce,
tomatoes, carrots and onions.
"Beef, lamb and chicken were
available, but you had to buy the
chicken live and butcher it your
self. so we didn't have chicken
very often." Barbara said.
The most unpleasant ex
perience Barbara Lindsay re
called was getting amebic dvs
entarv and later hepatitis,
which delayed their departure
one month.
After visiting an American
hospital in town. Barbara
Lindsay returned to the village
for six weeks of bed rest.
The villagers asked what her
sickness was. and recognizing
the French word tor hepatitis,
offered her a one-day cure: ex
tract of papaya leaves. "They
swear it works." she said, but
she chose to continue with the
American prescription
Barbara did not travel alone.

"Single women should be re
alistic about it they will get
advances They are considered
exotic foreigners But you can
turn the advances off just bv
your attitude and firmness."
she advised
Some ot the changes that the
volunteers introduced were
harder to assess Being Muslim,
the men lived in separate houses
from their wives and children
However, the villagers were
aware that the American couple
was living together. "By the
time we were leaving," said
Targe, "some of the men were
talking about having their wives
come to live in the new homes
they were building
"We had ambivalent feelings
about bringing tourists into the
village We worried that tour
ism would soil it." remarked
Barbara But they were al
ready motivated to better their
standard of living we just sup
plied the vehicle."
When it came time to leave,
the entire village participated
in a farewell ceremony "Eve
ryone was crying, from the
oldest chief to the smallest
kid." Targe recalled The
chief knew he would probably
not live long enough to see us
again, so he told us the village
would still be ours whenever we
return." said Targe
We considered staying long
er but we had completed what
we came to do." added Barbara.
"The daily life with the peo
ple of the village was by far the
most rewarding experience.
More than the exoticness of the
place, the relationships and
bonds we formed made it so
very hard to leave " com

Lindsay returned to the village

Targe, "some of the men were

When it came time to leave,
the entire village participated
in a farewell ceremony "Eve

chief knew he would probably
not live long enough to see us
again, so he told us the village
would still be ours whenever we
return." said Targe
We considered staying long

we came to do." added Barbara.
"The daily life with the peo

Peace Corps volunteer Targe Lindsay talks with two West African villagers.
In May of 1977, Barbara and
Targe Lindsay decided to leave
Palo Alto's suburbia and try
something different They
joined the Peace Corps and
served nearly three years in
West Africa
"We had both been pretty
sheltered." said Targe "We
were thrilled at the possibility
of seeing another part of the
world — especially Africa."
Peace Corps volunteers can
indicate a preference for loca
tion — which country, and either
a rural or urban setting. The
Lindsays chose Africa and re
ceived 44 months ot training
for an agricultural assignment
in Mali
The couple's training took
place both in American and
Chad. "Our 2 a.m. arrival in
Chad was like something out of a
Humphrey Bogart movie -
complete with a humid, mys
terious fog." said Targe Dusty
streets and squawking chickens
greeted them the following
morning.
"There is no way to prepare
for the adjustment," he said.
"Until you go to the well and
hoist up the two buckets of wa
ter rationed to you each day.
boil the water walk to the mar
ket. and exist on dates, bread,
lamb and onions day after day.
vou can't begin to know what it
will be like
The role of the Peace Corps in
Mali was to develop agricultur
al skills, introduce new vegeta
bles. develop seed production

and raise nutritional levels But
after 10 months, the program
fell through The problem was
mainly logistics and bad timing
in terms of the season we ar
rived." Targe said
The Lindsays were re
assigned in September of 1978 to
the Ivory Coast Their main task
was to organize and develop
tiading cooperatives in the
Dioula weaving villages in the
north of the country.
Although they were the first
white people to spend time in
the Dioula village, the Lindsays
felt accepted immediately.
French and Dioula were our
working languages, but we
found a smile always went a
long way to bridge any com
munication gaps," Targe said
The Lindsays shared their
handicraft skills with the com
munity. and showed the people
of Dioula that thev could use
native materials to increase
trade for the village.
Previously, the women would
spend a week making two
prayer caps that sold for the
equivalent of $1 each. Barbara
showed the village women how
to make a skirt. which could be
sold for $37.50. in the same
amount of time. This increased
each woman's weekly income
between $13 and $20.
"The dramatic increase in
tht woman's earning potential
caused some ripples in the vil
lage," Targe said In some
cases, the women were bringing
home more income than the
men.

"They kidded a lot. but the
men may have felt threatened."
he said However, the men were
also taught skills that helped to
increase their earnings, he
added
With their additional wealth,
the villagers began building new
houses and improved their over
all standard of living — espe

ciallv in terms of material
goods such as livestock,
mopeds. radios, wrist watches
and clothing
The Africans were especially
interested in increasing the vol
ume of trade for their village
Upon their arrival, the Lindsays
found a sign war going on be
tween the Dioula people and a

! nearby village competing for
trade
Signs directing traffic from
the nearest town to the villages
were posted every day. only to
disappear each night." Targe
recalled "Eventually we
worked out a settlement that
provided for a communal sign,
made out of metal and sunk in

cement."
The Lindsays said they never
felt threatened by political in
stability of neighboring coun
tries "There was a revolution
in Chad, and (ihana and Liberia
fell We never felt uncom
fortable. but we had friends in
Chad who had to get out. " Targe
explained.
The American hostages were
seized in Iran while the
Lindsays were working in the
Ivory Coast. "The Dioula vil
lagers were Muslim, but they
made a great effort to show
their disapproval of the hostage
situation and to distinguish
themselves (Black Muslims)
from Arab Muslims." he said.
The Lindsay's diet in the
Ivory Coast was more liberal
than in Mali. They had fresh
truit and vegetables, including
pineapple, papaya, lettuce,
tomatoes, carrots and onions.
"Beef, lamb and chicken were
available, but you had to buy the
chicken live and butcher it your
self. so we didn't have chicken
very often." Barbara said.

amount of time. This increased
each woman's weekly income
between $13 and $20.
"The dramatic increase in
tht woman's earning potential
caused some ripples in the vil
lage," Targe said In some
cases, the women were bringing
home more income than the
men.

"They kidded a lot. but the
men may have felt threatened."
he said However, the men were
also taught skills that helped to
increase their earnings, he
added
With their additional wealth,
the villagers began building new
houses and improved their over
all standard of living — espe

ciallv in terms of material
goods such as livestock,
mopeds. radios, wrist watches
and clothing
The Africans were especially
interested in increasing the vol
ume of trade for their village
Upon their arrival, the Lindsays
found a sign war going on be
tween the Dioula people and a

! nearby village competing for
trade
Signs directing traffic from
the nearest town to the villages
were posted every day. only to
disappear each night." Targe
recalled "Eventually we
worked out a settlement that
provided for a communal sign,
made out of metal and sunk in

cement."
The Lindsays said they never
felt threatened by political in
stability of neighboring coun
tries "There was a revolution
in Chad, and (ihana and Liberia
fell We never felt uncom
fortable. but we had friends in
Chad who had to get out. " Targe
explained.
The American hostages were
seized in Iran while the
Lindsays were working in the
Ivory Coast. "The Dioula vil
lagers were Muslim, but they
made a great effort to show
their disapproval of the hostage
situation and to distinguish
themselves (Black Muslims)
from Arab Muslims." he said.
The Lindsay's diet in the
Ivory Coast was more liberal
than in Mali. They had fresh
truit and vegetables, including
pineapple, papaya, lettuce,
tomatoes, carrots and onions.
"Beef, lamb and chicken were
available, but you had to buy the
chicken live and butcher it your
self. so we didn't have chicken
very often." Barbara said.
The most unpleasant ex
perience Barbara Lindsay re
called was getting amebic dvs
entarv and later hepatitis,
which delayed their departure
one month.
After visiting an American
hospital in town. Barbara
Lindsay returned to the village
for six weeks of bed rest.
The villagers asked what her
sickness was. and recognizing
the French word tor hepatitis,
offered her a one-day cure: ex
tract of papaya leaves. "They
swear it works." she said, but
she chose to continue with the
American prescription
Barbara did not travel alone.

"Single women should be re
alistic about it they will get
advances They are considered
exotic foreigners But you can
turn the advances off just bv
your attitude and firmness."
she advised
Some ot the changes that the
volunteers introduced were
harder to assess Being Muslim,
the men lived in separate houses
from their wives and children
However, the villagers were
aware that the American couple
was living together. "By the
time we were leaving," said
Targe, "some of the men were
talking about having their wives
come to live in the new homes
they were building
"We had ambivalent feelings
about bringing tourists into the
village We worried that tour
ism would soil it." remarked
Barbara But they were al
ready motivated to better their
standard of living we just sup
plied the vehicle."
When it came time to leave,
the entire village participated
in a farewell ceremony "Eve
ryone was crying, from the
oldest chief to the smallest
kid." Targe recalled The
chief knew he would probably
not live long enough to see us
again, so he told us the village
would still be ours whenever we
return." said Targe
We considered staying long
er but we had completed what
we came to do." added Barbara.
"The daily life with the peo
ple of the village was by far the
most rewarding experience.
More than the exoticness of the
place, the relationships and
bonds we formed made it so
very hard to leave " com
mented Barbara
