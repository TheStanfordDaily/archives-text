The spoils from Saturday's

UCLA Oct. 11 and 109 against
Washington Oct. 18) and the
first time he caught more than
10 passes (his previous high was
eight).
Nelson's 369-yard total
eclisped by one yard the con
ference all-purpose yardage re
cord set by USC's Anthony
Davis against Notre Dame in
1972.

lustrated':s and the Pac-10's Of-

for 44 and 24 yards.

reer bests for completions (29)
