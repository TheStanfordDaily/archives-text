# Fall tourney: NCAA tuneup
## Golf's best here to preview 
### Ivan Maisel 
That the Stanford Fall In
tercollegiate golf tournament
begins tomorrow is not big
news The school hosts one eve
ry autumn But this year, the
guest list is bit more im
pressive. It's as if Marlon Bran
do. Reggie Jackson and Bo De
rek decided to drop in on the
neighborhood Tupperware par
ty.

Co If

There will be more than three
newsmaking names at this par
ty Defending NCAA champion
Oklahoma State as well as top 10
finishers Oral Roberts. North
Carolina. Houston and Ohio
State are among 22 schools com
peting in the three-day event.
The reason the nation's best
schools have flocked here is
simple: Stanford will host the
1981 NCAA Golf Championship
next May. All the contenders for
that crown have come for a
sneak preview of a refurbished
Stanford Golf Course to see
what they will be up against in
May.
On the other hand. Stanford
golf coach David Yates is read
ying for a sneak preview
himself. After all. Yates is in
charge of making the course
suitable to host an NCAA cham
pionship. That means making it
tough
Yates is confident the course
is in shape, but nonetheless is
anxious to see that it measures
up. Though he said he did not
like to call it a "dress re
hearsal." Yates will use this
tournament to see what prob
lems will come up in May.
"I think the tournament will
run pretty smooth. You never
know, somebody will probably
come up with something you
haven't thought of." Yates said.
"We'll be watching to see if the
players are taking advantages
of the course instead of playing
it the way it should be."
That brings to mind the fa
mous "Hinkle tree" incident of
the opening round in the 1979
U.S. Open in Denver, when Lon
Hinkle used an adjacent fairway
as a shortcut on a par-5. The
I'GA went out after that round
and put a tree up to take away
that shortcut.
While Yates won't go to that
extreme, he said there will be
adjustments made if they are
needed.
"We want it to be a test. We
lost some of those oak trees (to
the drought) we had when the
course was ranked in the na
tion's top 100 They can mean a
half-shot per hole. You lose four
or five trees and a 75 becomes a
72." Yates said.
"Any changes made would be
cosmetic changes. We've done
all the bunkering and things of
that nature we're going to do.'
Yates defined cosmetic changes
as "recontouring some of the
greens, reshaping greens and

fairways In other words, it's
amazing what a lawn mower, or
the lack of one. can do to a golf
course
Hosting both this week s tour
nament and the NCAA is a ma
jor step for Stanford However
the question remains as to
whether Stanford will be in the
midst of the fight for the cham
pionship. or just in the way
Yates thinks the tournament
will benefit his team both now
and in the future
"It's a great boost for recruit
ing If a kid knows we're having
the NCAAs. then he knows
we've got a great course.
Yates said That evidently is
true, for three freshmen will
start for the Cardinals tomor
row, as well as transfer anil
number one player Jack Skill
ing Yates said the competition
should toughen his team into be
coming a top 15 team
"The big thing about golf is
you never get better unless you
play a team that's better For us
to get better we have to compete
against these teams. We play
Oklahoma State five times this
year, so we should be stronger
by the NCAAs." the Stanford
coach said

The Cowboys have finally
found a sport in which thev can
heat their sister school How
ever. even though they are con
sidered the best team in the
country a year after they won
the NCAAs coach Mike Holder
does not feel his team is as good
as it could be Oklahoma State
has finished second in both its
tournaments this fall, one
stroke behind Oral Roberts on
both occasions
This team has not played to
its potential.'' Holder said
Far from it Even if we win.
and none of us have ever seen
the course, we won't play to our
potential Hut 1 think there are
two reasons why we will do bet
ter than in our first two tour
naments We've been in prac
tice for awhile and this is the
site of the 1981 NCAA Cham
pionships
Leading Oklahoma State will
be two-time All American Bob

pionship. That means making it
tough
Yates is confident the course
is in shape, but nonetheless is
anxious to see that it measures
up. Though he said he did not
like to call it a "dress re
hearsal." Yates will use this
tournament to see what prob
lems will come up in May.
"I think the tournament will
run pretty smooth. You never
know, somebody will probably
come up with something you
haven't thought of." Yates said.
"We'll be watching to see if the
players are taking advantages
of the course instead of playing
it the way it should be."
That brings to mind the fa
mous "Hinkle tree" incident of
the opening round in the 1979
U.S. Open in Denver, when Lon
Hinkle used an adjacent fairway
as a shortcut on a par-5. The
I'GA went out after that round
and put a tree up to take away
that shortcut.
While Yates won't go to that
extreme, he said there will be
adjustments made if they are
needed.
"We want it to be a test. We
lost some of those oak trees (to
the drought) we had when the
course was ranked in the na
tion's top 100 They can mean a
half-shot per hole. You lose four
or five trees and a 75 becomes a
72." Yates said.
"Any changes made would be
cosmetic changes. We've done
all the bunkering and things of
that nature we're going to do.'
Yates defined cosmetic changes
as "recontouring some of the
greens, reshaping greens and

fairways In other words, it's
amazing what a lawn mower, or
the lack of one. can do to a golf
course
Hosting both this week s tour
nament and the NCAA is a ma
jor step for Stanford However
the question remains as to
whether Stanford will be in the
midst of the fight for the cham
pionship. or just in the way
Yates thinks the tournament
will benefit his team both now
and in the future
"It's a great boost for recruit
ing If a kid knows we're having
the NCAAs. then he knows
we've got a great course.
