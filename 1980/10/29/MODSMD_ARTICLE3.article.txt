# Byron Sher and Greg Morris compete for local assembly seat
## Assembly race very close, predicts Sher 
### Kate Lear 
Since August, Byron Sher has
walked door-to-door iour hours a day
handing out campaign literature and
meeting the people of Palo Alto.
Sher is the Democratic candidate
for State Assembly in the "21st District
and is involved in a tight race for that
position against Republican candidate
Greg Morris.
"I think the race will be relatively
close," Sher said in an interview Sat
urday, "I urge everyone to vote."
Shor's primary platform concerns
are energy conservation, consumer
affairs, and safeguarding the environ
ment; issues with which he has been
closely involved in his years of public
service.
Sher has served as director of the
California Solar Utility Development
Committee, a member of the League
of California Cities and the National
League of Cities Committee on En
vironmental Quality.
Sher is currently a professor at the
Law School here where he specializes
in consumer credit law and consumer
protection. He has held this position
since 1957.
He has also been actively involved
in community affairs, having served
for nine years on the Palo Alto City
Council. During that time he has
worked for two terms as mayor and is
currently vice-mayor.
Knergv conservation and alter
native energy sources would be two of
Sher's primary concerns as as
semblyman. he said. He insisted that
California must invest more money in
solar energy in order to make that al
ternative cost efficient. In addition.
Sher said he believes that California
must adopt an auto maintenance in
spection law in order to improve the
current air pollution problem.
More important in Sher's mind,
however, is his idea that we must be
"more aggressive about conserving
energy . . . that is our best form of
energy conservation."
Sher is an outspoken advocate of en
vironmental protection issues as well.
He is now serving as commissioner of
the San Francisco Bay Conservation
and Development Commission and he
said he has always worked hard to pre
vent "insensitive development" of the
Palo Alto foothills and the Bavlands.
Sher has also been part of the suc
cessful movement for curbside recycl

ing.
The construction of the Peripheral
Canal is one of t he more significant en
vironmental issues at present, accord
ing to Sher. He sees the development
of the canal as a potential "environ
mental disaster" and has personally
submitted 75.000 Santa Clara County
signatures calling for a public referen
dum on the peripheral canal bill.
"I led the fight against it. I am still
fighting against it. . .we must not al
low selfish special interests to destroy
Northern California." Sher said.
Regarding another controversial is
sue. Sher is in favor of County Ballot
Measure C (the advisory measure that
opposes peacetime military conscrip
tion). "I have never been for a peace
time draft ... it brings us closer to
war." Sher said.
Sher is also a strong supporter of
women's issues. He favors ratifi
cation of the Equal Rights Amend
ment as well as federal funding for
abortions. Sher also supports the Palo
Alto City policy which prohibits its
employees from attending conven
tions in unratified states. "It reflects
the pro-women atmosphere in Palo
Alto," he said.
Earlier in the campaign, opponent
Morris issued a piece of campaign lit
erature addressing environmentalists
who support Sher In it. Morris con
demns Sher for owning stock in oil
companies, seeing this fact and Sher's
support of environmental issues as in
compatible.
Sher has responded to these
statements by saying that he has pub
licly disclosed these investments an
nually since 1974. The local chapter of
the Sierra Club acknowledged Sher's
response and has since declared that
they do not find his investments and
his environmental beliefs incom
patible.
Palo Alto City Councilwoman Emi
ly Renzel agrees with Sher's self-eval
uation saying that he is a "political
being . . . his sense of humor and his
sense of procedure are all excellent."
She also believes that Sher has a good
feeling for forces at work in various
interest groups "and is often ex
traordinarily helpful in finding an
swers that essentially satisfy the bulk
of groups before us."
"It's a real shot in the arm to think
of someone like Byron in Sacra
mento." Renzel added.
