# 'Honor Code is under serious pressure in some areas," Ombudsman warns
## 
### 
"The Ombudsman's task is to protect
the interests and rights of members of the
Stanford community from iniustices or
abuses of discretion, from gross inef
ficiency. from unnecessary delay and
complication in administration of university
rules and regulation, and from in
consistency. unfairness. unrespon
siveness. and pre/udice in the individual's
experience with university activities The
Ombudsman exists to receive, examine and
channel the complaints and grievances of
members of the Stanford community, and
to secure expeditious and impartial
redress " (From the Charge to the Om
budsman, August 1973).
The past 12 months have been the busiest
in the history of this office As of the end of the
spring quarter a total of 543 cases have
sought advice registered complaints or of
fered positive criticism of some function of the
university (A "case may represent one
person or a group) The variety of issues and
problems brought to this office matches the
extensive range of activities of the faculty
students and staff
The accompanying chart affords some idea
of this although it fails to represent the par
ticular issues in the various categories (For
example "academic problems of students
include such items as inequity in grading,
sexual discrimination and poor teaching )
Despite the great variation and differing
degrees of seriousness of the problems that
come to this office, it is possible to point out
some matters that should come to public at
tention
The Honor Code
From the perspective of this office the
Honor Code is under serious pressure in some
areas of instruction This office has been
consulted by both faculty and students con
cerning suspected cases of Honor Code
violations There were 36 instances of this sort
during the past year
The number eems small, but when it is
considered in the context of known and
prosecuted Honor Code cases (20 in the past
academic year) it is indicative of trouble The
struggle for high grades in critical courses
such as chemistry 32, for example causes
some students to cheat Another example in
the crowded condition of LOTS Computer
Facility considerable dishonorable conduct has
occurred
Such violations, it seems, are more known
to students than to faculty, but they are not
normally reported either to the instructor or to
the President's office The "third person
responsibility is a very important provision of
the Honor Code and needs to be stressed and
explair "d to student', if it is to be effective (A
sample of last fall s freshman class showed
that 25 percent had serious reservations about
reporting a violation of the Honor Code ) In
deed, the most ,erious consequence of the
third person responsibility' process is that
students who fail to report cheating are
themselvc m violation of the Code
The failure of students to report violations is
one reason why some faculty question the
Honor Code s effectiveness, and, con
sequently, take measures of one sort or
another to detect cheating Such measures
may. of course themselves be violations of the
Honor Code under the provision of unusual and

unreasonable precautions Students who
would not report Honor Code violations of other
students are keen to complain of faculty who
take unfair measures to detect cheating
Although the President's Honor Code
Commission was very active this past year in
advocating and explaining the Honor Code to
both students and faculty it is not at all clear
that it has accomplished more than reinforce
the attitudes of those who are already com
mitted to the Code
This, of course, should not be dismissed as
insignificant nor does it mean that the Com
mission should be disbanded as ineffective It
wou d seem desirable that the Commission and
the Honor Code be given stronger, more vocal
support by the President's office especially on
occasions when the President addresses the
student body
Although the Honor Code its in
terpretations and applications are legislation
officially established by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council with approval of the
President, there is one interpretation Penalty
Grading. that needs reexamination and
clarification The provision either contradicts
the procedures prescribed by the SCLC in
cases of suspected dishonesty or it is unclear
as to its intent The SCLC should clarify this
provision, and it could at the same time
consider problems surrounding the third party
responsibility referred to above
Student complaints
The number of complaints students have
concerning courses, grades, and instructors
has remained about the same over the last two
years (about 200 cases") These are
distributed throughout the university and few
departments escape some student criticism
Some complaints are easily resolved,
others highly eccentric and of little con
sequence There are however, situations
about which students have very good reasons
for complaints These often concern poor
course organization lack of clear instructions
or even contradictory instructions concerning
assignments
In Computer Science 105. for example,
there was serious misunderstanding by
students concerning instruction for
programming, and as a consequence a number
of students were charged with violating the
Honor Code An ambiguity in instructions
covering collaboration among students on
assignments was the source of the trouble
Since that time new detailed instructions have
been developed that clarify what is legitimate
and illegitimate collaboration The problem that
arose in Computer Science illustrates very well
a common source o' complaints by students
President's Commission on the Education
and Employment of Women
As a coopted member of the Commission
the Ombudsman suggested that problems exist
particularly among women lecturers and the
secretarial staff concerning their status and
conditions of employment in the university
Under the chairmanship of Dr Marion Smith a
detailed study was made of both groups and
the result will be reported in a forthcoming
report from the Commission (published in
Campus Report Oct I—Ed) The study
confirms the opinion of this office that some
women employees in the university, whether
1 turers or secretaries, work under conditions
that iro not caticfartnrw

Problems in Plant Services
For several years Plant Services has been
undergoing reorganization From time to time
there have been criticisms and complaints
from Plant Services personnel about
inadequate supervision mconsistant directions
and low morale Instances of this sort might
well be expected in a period of extensive
reorganization, and this office has in the past
lealt with individual cases with this in mind
With the organization of Plant Services
pretty much in place, it is disturbing to report
that a substantial number of regular employees
in "Operations and Maintenance have
criticized the disorder in supervisory direc
tions. complained of low morale and expressed
general discontent with working conditions
From the point of view of this office there is
serious need of administrative intervention to
see where toe trouble is and how the situation
can be improved
Food Services
During the past year there have been very
few formal complaints coming to this office
concerning the food service in the various
student residences
There is, however, one persistent problem
that this office has tried to investigate and tried
to understand This is the claim by students
and resident associates that food coming from
a common source nevertheless varies from
residence to residence in quality when served
For obvious reasons this is inevitable to
some degree Some residences, such as
Branner, appear to be successful in presenting
food that students find satisfactory When this
is the case communication between ad
ministration and students is the key factor
At the other end of the spectrum is. for
example, Serra House in Stern As confirmed
by the Resident Fellow, the problem derives
from a failure of communication This is not
simply a matter of administration of the Food
Service in a given residence, but it is also a
failure of students to participate in food
committees and taste panels," the principle
means for effective communication with the
administration
Successful use of these means depends
very much on both strong administrative en
couragement and the willingness of students to
serve There is a strong correlation between
complaints about the food service and the
failure of food committees and panels to
function
The use and availability of the Om
budsman's Office
During the past year a review of the office
was conducted by a committee composed of
Dean Daryl Smith of Scripps College. Prof
Richard Schupbach of Stanford and former
graduate student Robert Jones
The committee focused to some extent on
the visibility of the office, and. by implication
on the lack of knowledge of the office and its
function among some groups in the university
Despite extensive use of announcements in
various university publications and ads in the
Dally, it is true that the office's existence and
function is not universally known among
students and the secretarial staff
A number of steps have been taken to
overcome this lack of awareness Student
assistants to the Ombudsman is one During
the past year two students, Sonja Johnson and
Irv Parchman. undertook pro)ects that involved
interviewing and talking with students

Investigation of student complaints about
the tood service (referred to above), and a
study of the housing draw were successful in
relating this office to the two common student
concerns Student assistants will serve in this
role again next year
In addition to the student assistants, a
number of students (nine) interested in student
problems have volunteered to act next year as
liaisons to this office They will be scattereo
among the various student residences and will
be asked to represent this office among their
peers, resident assistants and resident fellows
It is expected that this will make the office
more directly available to students
In addition to these measures the office will
continue to have Leah Kaplan as a special

assistant Her participation on several
university committees (in addition to those on
which the Ombudsman serves) and her status
in the university community is and will continue
to be most valuable in spreading knowledge of
the Ombudsman s office to the entire
university community
The Ombudsman has profited from the
many persons in the University who have
offered advice and cooperated in resolving
problems. More immediately the strong
support of Leah Kaplan, Sara Stephenson
Sonja Johnson, and Irv Parchman has been of
great value in forming just resolutions to many
difficult problems
