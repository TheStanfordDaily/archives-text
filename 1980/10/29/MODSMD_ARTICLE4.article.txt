# Morris says specific plans are necessary

"I'm sick and tired of issues' being
the issue. We have to quit talking and
start acting. . . ."
So runs the appeal of Greg Morris,
candidate for the 21st State Assembly
District.
Any lack of emphasis on issues may
stem, in part, from a great outward
similarity between the two can
didates. says Morris. He says his posi
tions on the Peripheral Canal, energy,
governmental inefficiency and en
vironment generally compare with
those of Democrat Byron Sher.
Additionally, both have experience
in local government. Morris served on
the Sunnyvale City Council and on nu
merous task boards and commissions;
Sher has been a member of the Palo
Alto City Council and was twice
elected mayor.
Both have connections with the Uni
versity — Morris as a student and as
an undergraduate instructor; Sher as
a professor of law and as the chairman
of the Faculty Senate.
Nonpartisan
And both fail to stress their party af
filiation. The literature of neither can
didate prominently announces his par
ty affiliation
Morris has said that the greatest
difference between himself and Sher
is not issues but style.
According to the Palo Alto Weekly,
because issues have not been impor
tant in the Morris Sher campaign, fi
nances have been. Morris, who ran un
successfully for the same assembly
seat in 1978, plans to spend $150,000 in
this campaign, more than double that
the amount spent in his 1978 effort.
Sher's spokespeople estimate cam
paign expenses at close to $100,000.
Postal politics'
Much of the campaign budgets are
allotted to "postal politics." In a dis
trict without local television stations
to broadcast political advertisements,
candidates relv on frequent mailings
and "hit pieces" — specific attacks on
opponents and their positions.
Despite the many similarities of the
two candidates' positions on issues.
Morris stresses the importance of the
need for specific solutions to political
problems in the '80s. Vacant rhetoric
and promises, he says, have gone too
far.
Morris's specific economic pro
posals elude categorization as either
traditional Republican or Democrat

in philosophies. His policies represent
a mixture of both conservative and lib
eral elements
Mitigation
On the problem of inflation. Morris
suggests the role of California should
be to mitigate the impacts rather than
attack the causes. To achieve these
ends, his plan outlines a "nook-and
crannv look at spending in each gov
ernment department" to reduce state
expenditures.
He also suggests specific legislation
to reduce consumer costs in the areas
of health care and auto insurance. The
promotion of the practice of preven
tative medicine and changes in medi
cal malpractice insurance to lower in
surance rates for doctors are critical
he says, and a no-fault auto insurance
plan is necessary to reduce long-term
rates to consumers.
Morris said he considers a sound
energy plan one of California's most
pressing problems in the 1980s. "Cali
fornia is reliant on petroleum and we
need a short-term solution and a long
range plan for immediate and future
energy requirements."
Incentives
He calls for the encouragement of
energy conservation through tax in
centives for consumers and for com
panies producing energy-efficient
products
On a long-term basis, he proposes to
make solar tax credits meaningful
for consumers. The tax credits must
be made more useful for a larger
chunk of people. In the interim we
must work on (other energy alter
natives)."
Housing, too. is a significant prob
lem. according to Morris. Higher pop
ulation density does not provide the
answer, he says. California should
"preserve the environmental integri
ty of its neighborhoods, while increas
ing our commitment to mass transit
so we will have growth by design — not
by chance."
On the issue of tax reform, Morris
calls for numerous legislative changes
to protect the public. His tax proposals
include the full indexing of income
taxation according to the inflation
rate, the abolition of the inheritance
tax. creation of incentives to spur in
vestment and savings, and reduction
of tax burdens on elderly people.

plan is necessary to reduce long-term
rates to consumers.
Morris said he considers a sound
energy plan one of California's most
pressing problems in the 1980s. "Cali
fornia is reliant on petroleum and we
need a short-term solution and a long
range plan for immediate and future
energy requirements."
Incentives
He calls for the encouragement of
energy conservation through tax in
centives for consumers and for com
panies producing energy-efficient
products
On a long-term basis, he proposes to
make solar tax credits meaningful
for consumers. The tax credits must
be made more useful for a larger
chunk of people. In the interim we
must work on (other energy alter
natives)."
Housing, too. is a significant prob
lem. according to Morris. Higher pop
ulation density does not provide the
answer, he says. California should
"preserve the environmental integri
ty of its neighborhoods, while increas
ing our commitment to mass transit
so we will have growth by design — not
by chance."
On the issue of tax reform, Morris
calls for numerous legislative changes
to protect the public. His tax proposals
include the full indexing of income
taxation according to the inflation
rate, the abolition of the inheritance
tax. creation of incentives to spur in
vestment and savings, and reduction
of tax burdens on elderly people.
"I'm sick and tired of issues' being
the issue. We have to quit talking and
start acting. . . ."
So runs the appeal of Greg Morris,
candidate for the 21st State Assembly
District.
Any lack of emphasis on issues may
stem, in part, from a great outward
similarity between the two can
didates. says Morris. He says his posi
tions on the Peripheral Canal, energy,
governmental inefficiency and en
vironment generally compare with
those of Democrat Byron Sher.
Additionally, both have experience
in local government. Morris served on
the Sunnyvale City Council and on nu
merous task boards and commissions;
Sher has been a member of the Palo
Alto City Council and was twice
elected mayor.
Both have connections with the Uni
versity — Morris as a student and as
an undergraduate instructor; Sher as
a professor of law and as the chairman
of the Faculty Senate.
Nonpartisan
And both fail to stress their party af
filiation. The literature of neither can
didate prominently announces his par
ty affiliation
Morris has said that the greatest
difference between himself and Sher
is not issues but style.
According to the Palo Alto Weekly,
because issues have not been impor
tant in the Morris Sher campaign, fi
nances have been. Morris, who ran un
successfully for the same assembly
seat in 1978, plans to spend $150,000 in
this campaign, more than double that
the amount spent in his 1978 effort.
Sher's spokespeople estimate cam
paign expenses at close to $100,000.
Postal politics'
Much of the campaign budgets are
allotted to "postal politics." In a dis
trict without local television stations
to broadcast political advertisements,
candidates relv on frequent mailings
and "hit pieces" — specific attacks on
opponents and their positions.
Despite the many similarities of the
two candidates' positions on issues.
Morris stresses the importance of the
need for specific solutions to political
problems in the '80s. Vacant rhetoric
and promises, he says, have gone too
far.
Morris's specific economic pro
posals elude categorization as either
traditional Republican or Democrat

in philosophies. His policies represent
a mixture of both conservative and lib
eral elements
Mitigation
On the problem of inflation. Morris
suggests the role of California should
be to mitigate the impacts rather than
attack the causes. To achieve these
ends, his plan outlines a "nook-and
crannv look at spending in each gov
ernment department" to reduce state
expenditures.
He also suggests specific legislation
to reduce consumer costs in the areas
of health care and auto insurance. The
promotion of the practice of preven
tative medicine and changes in medi
cal malpractice insurance to lower in
surance rates for doctors are critical
he says, and a no-fault auto insurance
plan is necessary to reduce long-term
rates to consumers.
