# Stanford's election center events to include mock debate
## 
### Eric Cornell 
The only difference between the presiden
tial debate held in Cleveland last night and
the debate to be held in Branner Hall this
evening is that the local event will feature
all three candidates: John Anderson, Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan.
Well, there is the fact that the television
networks will be missing. Oh, and so will the
candidates, who will actually be portrayed
by Branner Hall residents.
The mock debate is a part of the Stanford
Election Center at Branner, a program
which is sponsoring half a dozen election-re
lated events this week and next, all leading
up to an "election night extravaganza" Nov.
4.
The center is the brainchild of the Branner

resident assistants (RAs). said Branner RA
Mark Swanson.
"We hope to provide the framework for
students to interpret the election and make
their own decisions instead of simply provid
ing them with the answers," he said.
The series opened Monday night with a
panel discussion of the candidates' views on
domestic affairs.
"The professors did more than just
criticize the candidates." said Leo Cun
ningham. one of the Branner House RAs co
ordinating the events. "They used the can
didates as a springboard to discussing the
wider issue of the basic soundness of our eco
nomic and political system. The student re
sponse was very good. "
"Monday's discussion was great. It

showed that our real purpose is not to tell
people who to vote for. but to rouse campus
interest in the issues and in politics in gener
al." said freshman Ellen Germaine. public
ity cochairman for the program.
With an eye toward further promoting stu
dent discussion, Branner plans two more
programs before election night.
Tomorrow night at 7 30 another panel dis
cussion involving Associate Professor David
Abernethy of the Political Science Depart
ment, Professor Robert Keohane.chairman
of the Political Science Department and
Professor Alexander Dallin,chairman of the
International Relations Department will ad
dress the candidates' policies on interna
tional issues.
On Monday night election eve, the pro

gram will climax with a videotape presenta
tion of the 1960 Nixon Kennedy debate. Stu
dents will also have the opportunity to trade
presidential commodities for the first time
Monday evening, according to Swanson The
value of each commodity, corresponding to
the three major candidates Reagan. Carter
and Anderson, will be pegged to the Gallup
poll figures of that day.he said. Residents
will be allowed to trade the commodities in
an attempt to end up with shares that cor
respond to the eventual victor. Trading will
continue Tuesday night as the returns come
in, Swanson said
This will inject a certain element of ex
citement into watching the returns, Cun
ningham said.
The Branner residents are aware that a

week of hard deliberation and two minutes in
the voting booth can be hard work Accord
ingly. they plan an election night program to
wrap it all up â€” campaign paraphernalia
will garnish the lounge, an expert will be on
hand to provide running commentary on re
sults as they come in.and refreshments will
be served to cheer up those who find the
news depressing.
And to supplement their three wide
screen televisions (one for each network)
the Brannerites are constructing their own
electronic results board, complete with
flashing colored lights.
With the exception of the commodities
trading, all activities are open to the entire
community. Swanson said.
