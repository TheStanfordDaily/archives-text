# Davis boasts high percentage of cyclists
## Bicycle lanes facilitate safety, fun 
### 
By Karen Kruse
"Hi. boys and girls My name
is Mr Smart Spokes, and I'm
here to talk to you about bicycle
safety Did you know that 22.000
people in Davis. California, ride
bicycles?"
If you didn't know that, don't
feel bad You're not alone; there
are at least 100 Davis third
graders who didn't know it
either until they read that pas
sage from the latest edition of
The Mr Smart Spokes comic
strip which the Davis Police De
partment circulates as part of
its extensive bicycle safety
awareness program This pro
gram is especially important to
these third graders because, af
terall. they are living in Bike
City. USA.
The bike capital, which is lo
cated 15 miles west of Sacra
mento. has achieved national
acclaim for its creative, but
practical system of bike paths
and lanes.
The 36.000 people in Davis
pride themselves on having the
highest ratio of bikers to
citizens in the country; over 70
percent of the population owns
bicycles and uses them as a reg
ular means of transportation.
("Regular means'' is defined as
25 percent of all innercity trips
being taken on bikes.)
Necessity and pleasure
There are several reasons
why this ratio is so unusually
high. The first is the presence of
18.000 college students enrolled
in the University of California
at Davis. A bike is a campus ne
cessity considering the 10-
minute class changes and the

1000-acre campus area The flat
terrain of the Sacramento Val
ley makes biking physically pos
sible for a wide range of people,
and the mild climate, although
wet at times, makes it en
joyable all year long
The popularity of bicycles
began to rise in the '60s because
of these factors as did the traffic
problems associated with it At
first, the city viewed the surge
of bicycle use as a passing fad
and the city council consistently
shied away from subsidizing
"extravagant'' plans for sepa
rate bike lanes.
Community bike use didn't
fade with the decade, however.
By the end of the '60s, communi
ty support for a bike transporta
tion system wielded enough po
litical power to establish one.
Research done
Extensive research was done
bv the city into traffic flow, bi
cyclist safety, types of paths,
path construction and financial
feasibility of the envisioned pro
gram The resulting proposal,
aimed for 1974. included con
struction of 23 miles of carefully
engineered bike lanes and 12
miles of bike paths. The dif
ference in these is that a bike
path is physically separate from
road traffic, while a bike lane is

a designated section of the road
for the exclusive use of bicy
clists
The city council defined a de
sirable street as 52 feet wide
with two eight-foot parking
lanes, two five-foot bike lanes,
and two 11-foot lanes for motor
ized traffic.
This arrangement gives room
for safe car door opening and re
duces the apprehension of both
drivers and bikers. During the
system's planning stages, the
Davis City Council foresaw the
financial burden such an am
bitious program would bring, as
well as the need for a com
prehensive guideline for the
program's future expansion
Now a responsibility
In 1964, the council resolved
that land developers were to be
financially responsible for
meeting the standards of the
bike-oriented City General
Plan
Sixteen years later, the paths
that were once created to fulfill
a public need, now act as the
fuel to keep that need burning.
The success of the bike trans
portation system designed for
public accessibility, safety and
enjoyment is clearly shown in
the bike-to-person ratios and

traffic volume curves that
Davis understandably relishes.
Its success is also shown by
the community support that the
program has been given When
asked if she felt intimidated by
the masses of bikes on the city
streets, an elderly resident of
Davis replied. "No. It takes a
great deal of care, but it's won
derful how we can all ride safely
together."
Bike system lauded
Another resident of Davis
said. "Once in a while there is
an accident, but there wouldn't
be enough room for everyone to
park if there wasn't a well-or
ganized bike system. I do try to
avoid the rush hours, though."
The UC-Davis campus, de
spite its bike paths, remains
congested. One student said,
"You're lucky to make it
through those 10 minutes at
class break, because everybody
on campus is on a bike."
"The campus would be safe if
it weren't for the uncoordinated
freshmen." remarked one up
perclassman. The bike flow,
while not completely free of ac
cidents or time-consuming traf
fic jams, is. according to one
student, "still a cause for cam
pus pride."

Eight-foot bicycle parking lanes are not an unusual sight in Davis, California. This city, which in
stituted an elaborate street project in 1974 making the roads safe for both motorists and cyclists,
boasts the highest ratio of bikers to citizens in the country.
By Karen Kruse
"Hi. boys and girls My name
is Mr Smart Spokes, and I'm
here to talk to you about bicycle
safety Did you know that 22.000
people in Davis. California, ride
bicycles?"
If you didn't know that, don't
feel bad You're not alone; there
are at least 100 Davis third
graders who didn't know it
either until they read that pas
sage from the latest edition of
The Mr Smart Spokes comic
strip which the Davis Police De
partment circulates as part of
its extensive bicycle safety
awareness program This pro
gram is especially important to
these third graders because, af
terall. they are living in Bike
City. USA.
The bike capital, which is lo
cated 15 miles west of Sacra
mento. has achieved national
acclaim for its creative, but
practical system of bike paths
and lanes.
The 36.000 people in Davis
pride themselves on having the
highest ratio of bikers to
citizens in the country; over 70
percent of the population owns
bicycles and uses them as a reg
ular means of transportation.
("Regular means'' is defined as
25 percent of all innercity trips
being taken on bikes.)
Necessity and pleasure
There are several reasons
why this ratio is so unusually
high. The first is the presence of
18.000 college students enrolled
in the University of California
at Davis. A bike is a campus ne
cessity considering the 10-
minute class changes and the

1000-acre campus area The flat
terrain of the Sacramento Val
ley makes biking physically pos
sible for a wide range of people,
and the mild climate, although
wet at times, makes it en
joyable all year long
The popularity of bicycles
began to rise in the '60s because
of these factors as did the traffic
problems associated with it At
first, the city viewed the surge
of bicycle use as a passing fad
and the city council consistently
shied away from subsidizing
"extravagant'' plans for sepa
rate bike lanes.
Community bike use didn't
fade with the decade, however.
By the end of the '60s, communi
ty support for a bike transporta
tion system wielded enough po
litical power to establish one.
Research done
Extensive research was done
bv the city into traffic flow, bi
cyclist safety, types of paths,
path construction and financial
feasibility of the envisioned pro
gram The resulting proposal,
aimed for 1974. included con
struction of 23 miles of carefully
engineered bike lanes and 12
miles of bike paths. The dif
ference in these is that a bike
path is physically separate from
road traffic, while a bike lane is

a designated section of the road
for the exclusive use of bicy
clists
The city council defined a de
sirable street as 52 feet wide
with two eight-foot parking
lanes, two five-foot bike lanes,
and two 11-foot lanes for motor
ized traffic.
This arrangement gives room
for safe car door opening and re
duces the apprehension of both
drivers and bikers. During the
system's planning stages, the
Davis City Council foresaw the
financial burden such an am
bitious program would bring, as
well as the need for a com
prehensive guideline for the
program's future expansion
Now a responsibility
In 1964, the council resolved
that land developers were to be
financially responsible for
meeting the standards of the
bike-oriented City General
Plan
Sixteen years later, the paths
that were once created to fulfill
a public need, now act as the
fuel to keep that need burning.
The success of the bike trans
portation system designed for
public accessibility, safety and
enjoyment is clearly shown in
the bike-to-person ratios and

traffic volume curves that
Davis understandably relishes.
Its success is also shown by
the community support that the
program has been given When
asked if she felt intimidated by
the masses of bikes on the city
streets, an elderly resident of
Davis replied. "No. It takes a
great deal of care, but it's won
derful how we can all ride safely
together."
Bike system lauded
Another resident of Davis
said. "Once in a while there is
an accident, but there wouldn't
be enough room for everyone to
park if there wasn't a well-or
ganized bike system. I do try to
avoid the rush hours, though."
The UC-Davis campus, de
spite its bike paths, remains
congested. One student said,
"You're lucky to make it
through those 10 minutes at
class break, because everybody
on campus is on a bike."
"The campus would be safe if
it weren't for the uncoordinated
freshmen." remarked one up
perclassman. The bike flow,
while not completely free of ac
cidents or time-consuming traf
fic jams, is. according to one
student, "still a cause for cam
pus pride."
