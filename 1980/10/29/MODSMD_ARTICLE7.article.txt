The parents moan Their enthusiastic
guide just said, "When the University was
founded in 1891. there was no tuition. "
Another parent looks ruffled. She has just
seen the firehouse.
The guide moans. Yet another parent has
asked her SAT scores and high school GPA.
It's all part of tour guiding, a popular pas
time for students here. According to Lane
Webster, the undergraduate director of the
tour guide service, the service hires 30 regu
lar guides and seven alternates for the year,
and about five times this number apply. "I
feel sort of like Fred Hargadon." he said.
Webster and Rene Cortinaz. the non-stu
dent director of the tour guide service, seek
a diverse guide force. They base selection
on an interview but look for diversity of
race, background and age. ability to
articulate, language expertise and previous
guiding experience.
Chief qualifications include punctuality,
politeness and knowledge of the
University. If guides maintain these stan
dards, they are generally rehired. But old
guides go overseas, and openings arise each
quarter. Prospective applicants should go
to Public Affairs Building 170 at least two
weeks before the start of a new quarter.
Guides work about six hours a week on a
flexible schedule. And.in addition to giving
tours, they staff Hoover Tower, run the

elevator, give bus tours and staff the in
formation booth.
Students develop their own personalized
tours. "We have enthusiastic, wild-eved
guides." said Webster. "We keep it fresh
and from a student's perspective."
Every stop includes not only an historical
and current fact but also a personal
anecdote.
Where do the tourists want to go? Accord
ing to junior Rich Marquez. a veteran guide,
particular favorites are Mem Chu. Hoover
Tower and the Bookstore.
"There's very little excitement while
you're tourguiding." said Marquez. He has,
however, given a tour to Sharon Percy
Rockefeller. Other recent famous tourists
have included golfer Ben Hogan. Helen
Rockefeller and University of Chicago
President Hannah Gray.
According to Webster. Ronald Reagan
was rumored to be coming for a tour. He did
not appear, but. said Webster, "all the
guides were very well-groomed.''
Regular public tours are free and sub
sidized by the budget of the Department of
Public Affairs.
"We sell so few of our stunning
brochures." said Webster. "You could call
us a non-profit organization, meaning that
we never turn a profit." he added.
Guides are paid $3.45 an hour and occa
sionally receive tips.
Special tours are also available. Groups

which use the special tour service include
the elderly, camps, foreign tourists and dis
advantaged high school students.
According to Webster, teachers of under
achieves bring their students here so they
"will realize some people pay to study."
The size of the library particularly im
presses these students, he said.
Representatives from various depart
ments speak to the guides to improve their
knowledge of the University.
Selection, however, does not depend on
knowledge. According to Marquez,
"a guide should be someone who can relate
to people really well and who isn't shy."
Senior Barbara Fletcher, another guide
here, said, "I was told I was selected be
cause I can talk for a solid hour."
Tours leave from the information booth in
front of the Quad at 11 a.m. and 2:15 p.m.
Monday through Saturday, and at 2:1.5 p.m.
on Sunday Hoover Tower is open from 10
a.m. to 11:50 a.m. and from Ito 4 p.m. Mon
day through Saturday and from 1 to 4 p.m.
Sunday.
So. if you don't know that the Quad was
built in 1891. that the Mem Chu organ has
3555 pipes, that the University sprawls over
8200 acres, that Cecil Green was the founder
of Texas Instruments, that 29 libraries are
on campus or that President Herbert Hoo
ver was a member of the first graduating
class (the class of 1895). maybe you should
take a tour — it's free!

"will realize some people pay to study."
The size of the library particularly im
presses these students, he said.
Representatives from various depart
ments speak to the guides to improve their
knowledge of the University.
Selection, however, does not depend on
knowledge. According to Marquez,
"a guide should be someone who can relate
to people really well and who isn't shy."
Senior Barbara Fletcher, another guide
here, said, "I was told I was selected be
cause I can talk for a solid hour."
Tours leave from the information booth in
front of the Quad at 11 a.m. and 2:15 p.m.
Monday through Saturday, and at 2:1.5 p.m.
on Sunday Hoover Tower is open from 10
a.m. to 11:50 a.m. and from Ito 4 p.m. Mon
day through Saturday and from 1 to 4 p.m.

So. if you don't know that the Quad was
built in 1891. that the Mem Chu organ has
3555 pipes, that the University sprawls over
8200 acres, that Cecil Green was the founder
of Texas Instruments, that 29 libraries are
on campus or that President Herbert Hoo
ver was a member of the first graduating
class (the class of 1895). maybe you should
take a tour — it's free!
The parents moan Their enthusiastic
guide just said, "When the University was
founded in 1891. there was no tuition. "
Another parent looks ruffled. She has just
seen the firehouse.
The guide moans. Yet another parent has
asked her SAT scores and high school GPA.
It's all part of tour guiding, a popular pas
time for students here. According to Lane
Webster, the undergraduate director of the
tour guide service, the service hires 30 regu
lar guides and seven alternates for the year,
and about five times this number apply. "I
feel sort of like Fred Hargadon." he said.
Webster and Rene Cortinaz. the non-stu
dent director of the tour guide service, seek
a diverse guide force. They base selection
on an interview but look for diversity of
race, background and age. ability to
articulate, language expertise and previous
guiding experience.
Chief qualifications include punctuality,
politeness and knowledge of the
University. If guides maintain these stan
dards, they are generally rehired. But old
guides go overseas, and openings arise each
quarter. Prospective applicants should go
to Public Affairs Building 170 at least two
weeks before the start of a new quarter.
Guides work about six hours a week on a
flexible schedule. And.in addition to giving
tours, they staff Hoover Tower, run the

elevator, give bus tours and staff the in
formation booth.
Students develop their own personalized
tours. "We have enthusiastic, wild-eved
guides." said Webster. "We keep it fresh
and from a student's perspective."
Every stop includes not only an historical
and current fact but also a personal
anecdote.
Where do the tourists want to go? Accord
ing to junior Rich Marquez. a veteran guide,
particular favorites are Mem Chu. Hoover
Tower and the Bookstore.
"There's very little excitement while
you're tourguiding." said Marquez. He has,
however, given a tour to Sharon Percy
Rockefeller. Other recent famous tourists
have included golfer Ben Hogan. Helen
Rockefeller and University of Chicago
President Hannah Gray.
According to Webster. Ronald Reagan
was rumored to be coming for a tour. He did
not appear, but. said Webster, "all the
guides were very well-groomed.''
Regular public tours are free and sub
sidized by the budget of the Department of
Public Affairs.
"We sell so few of our stunning
brochures." said Webster. "You could call
us a non-profit organization, meaning that
we never turn a profit." he added.
Guides are paid $3.45 an hour and occa
sionally receive tips.
Special tours are also available. Groups

which use the special tour service include
the elderly, camps, foreign tourists and dis
advantaged high school students.
According to Webster, teachers of under
achieves bring their students here so they
"will realize some people pay to study."
The size of the library particularly im
presses these students, he said.
