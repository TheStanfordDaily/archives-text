## 
### Liz Rosner 
Blending a mellifluous voice
with the soft cadence of her
prose, Joyce Carol Thomas,
poet, playwright and novelist,
read from and spoke about her
works as part of a series of
"Dialogues with West Coast
Women Writers" presented by
Stanford's Center for Research
on Women (CROW).
Diane Middlebrook. associate
professor of English and herself
a published poet, acted as
Thomas' interviewer for the
program, held last Wednesday
at Terman Auditorium.

An audience of 350 people —
nearly all women — listened to
Thomas read from her new nov
el. Marked by Fire, to be pub
lished next year. The passage
was an extremely moving de
scription of the birth of a child in
a cotton field in Oklahoma amid
the humming and moaning of a
chorus of women pickers.
After reading a passage in
which the child becomes a
storyteller. Thomas explained
the writing was an attempt to
recapture the kind of stories she
heard as a child growing up in
Oklahoma in similar circum
stances.
Along with what is termed an
"Oklahoma flavoring" in her
work, is a kind of spiritual
rhythm, reflecting Thomas'
own background in a Fun
damentalist Black Church.
"I remember the music." she
said. "The preacher was
charged with entertaining the
congregation. He had to feed
them spiritually."
Thomas also read from her
collections of poetry Bit
tersweet (1973) and Blessing
(1975). Her newest collection is
Inside the Rainbow.
Currently a reading specialist
at San Jose State and mother of

four. Thomas also reflected on
the relationship between her life
and her writing.
She spoke about her tendency
as a person and as a writer to
have an optimistic and youthful
vision of life. "I tend to ignore
the ugliness in the world, like
children do." she said.
As for working "around" her
children, Thomas said. "They
would leave me alone, knowing I
was writing . . . It's all part of
our growing together; they just
understand."
In response to Middlebrooks'
question about defining herself
as a feminist, Thomas re
marked, "I lean toward writing
about women, I continue to be
supported bv women, and I see
myself as a supporter of women
. . the best definition is my ac
tions."
The CHOW series will con
tinue for the next five Wednes
days, each program featuring a
dialogue between a Stanford-af
filiated humanist and a promi
nent West Coast writer. Upcom
ing participants include Susan
Griffin, Tillie Olsen. Jessamyn
West. Judv Grahn and Ursula
LeGuin. each matched with an
interviewer who has a special
interest in her work.
