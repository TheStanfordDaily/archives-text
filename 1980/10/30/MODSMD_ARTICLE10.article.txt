## They disputed 
### 
Gentlemen, as you know, the
format of the debates has been
slightly modified to tailor to
both of your tastes. The mod
erator will initiate your con
frontation by reading the first
line of an undisclosed children's
fairy tale. Mr Reagan won the
toss and will have the first
CRACK at the story. 1 must re
mind the audience that if for
some reason either candidate
should fail to invoke Lincoln or
Kennedy, the oxygen masks
will fall from the ceiling. . . .
Good luck to both of you.
"ONCE upon a time there
were three little pigs . .
Mr. Reagan, you have three
minutes for discussion, rebut
tal. clarification and re
statement.
YES I'd like to point out that
at least one of us will finish this
story. 1 have so many intuitive
advantages that I'd like to dis
cuss. but since existence pre
cedes essence and the moon is in
the seventh house there are rea
sons that I'd enjoy discussing
why I am incapable of dis
cussion that 1 can't discuss. I'd
like to preface my argument by
referencing my past. I was in
the movies. I was a Democrat. I
was an idiot. I DID A LOT OF
FOOLISH THINGS, but I DID
IT IN CALIFORNIA and I've
been in my union for 36 years, so
when you go to SPILL YOUR
GUT FEELINGS into the ballot
box. look for the union label.
When I was young there was
no inequality. The earth was
without form and darkness
filled the face of the earth. Now,
I'm afraid of equality, for if we
accept ERA, it will be mis
construed by degenerate men
whose sole purpose is to estab
lish co-ed bathrooms in federal
buildings. We must keep wom
en's bodies in mind. After all,
some employers might take ad
vantage of women and force
their bodies to do things they are
not capable of — like running for
political office.
I see the greatest problem of
all is defense. My opponent lias
cut the Missileman Minutes, the
trident, and whatever else ex
ists within the face of humanity.
My solution is at the base of
God. Mother and Country: Arm
them all. Nuke Iran, nuke the
whales, nuke the nukes. Non
proliferation is none of our busi
ness, what's a party without
party-goers? Let's let the Third
World in on the fun and everyone

will be an equal threat to each
other. 1 love the smell of
Plutonium in the morning.
My opponent has accused me
of saying things that I may have
said but 1 firmly believe I have
never said them. He's dis
criminating against me. Yes.
discrimination. I was just talk
ing to a small red-headed or
phan girl and her malnourished
dog in tne streets of New York
that crawled on my patent
leather shoes and dully mut
tered, "unkept promises, de
spair." That's the problem with
this administration, they've left
too many trees in the inner city
and all that smog is melting peo
ple's minds.
My opponent has fumbled
with the economy and it's all be
cause he can't lower taxes, in
crease spending, and balance
the budget. The Secretary of
Health and Welfare admitted
there was easily $42 billion of
waste in government. That's
where my secret lies, I'm cut
ting the waste.
Yes, waste. Waste is the re
sult of lazy people lacking
energy. Energy is indeed a ques
tion plaguing our nation. People
don't seem to realize that all our
oil lies under National Parks
and for some stupid reason the
federal government is keeping
our friends, the oil companies,
from drilling on these worthless
expanses of land. When I'm
president, I'll make sure fuel
costs don't rise by personally
strip mining the entire state of
Alaska. Let's leave it all to the
oil companies, they've got our
interest at heart.
My opponent has accused me
of wanting to make Social Se
curity voluntary. Why just yes
terday I remember talking to a
dear lady who took in her poor
desolate, downtrodden, nephew,
a victim of too much govern
ment. When her husband died
and they were forced to eat dog
food ... I can't continue.
Lastly, I'd just like to say that
Gene Autry will replace the
eagle as the national symbol and
won't you sleep better knowing
that I'm praying for you. By the
way ... did va here the one
about the Polish priest?
"Mr. Carter, Mr. Heagan has
seemingly taken most of your
time, you have one minute to
finish the 'Three Little Pigs.' "
Well, H.L. Mencken once
said, "there's always a small
bucket of schlop to satisfy a big
pig ." I'd just like to say that the
Oval Office is a LONELY place
with only Amy for company. I
was just talking to Amy and her
dog Checkers, just the other day
and she told me, "Dad. the
greatest problem is nuclear pro
liferation. Do you realize that if
you took a 10 megaton bomb
then that's equal to TNT in
traincars from New York to
LA? In fact, you could take all
the unemployed in America that
could form a line from New-
York to LA, and solve the entire
problem with the BIG BANG
theory."
So vote for me and remember
(let me interject John Kennedy
while I still have the chance), if
only one person in every pre
cinct voted against Kennedy
then .John wouldn't have been
elected. So sacrifice in the name
of America. I prefer sheep and
goats, and Thank You Cleveland
tor THE LAST HOURS OF MY
LIFE.
And they lived happily
ever after.

I'm afraid of equality, for if we
accept ERA, it will be mis
construed by degenerate men
whose sole purpose is to estab
lish co-ed bathrooms in federal
buildings. We must keep wom
en's bodies in mind. After all,
some employers might take ad
vantage of women and force
their bodies to do things they are
not capable of — like running for
political office.
I see the greatest problem of
all is defense. My opponent lias
cut the Missileman Minutes, the
trident, and whatever else ex
ists within the face of humanity.
My solution is at the base of
God. Mother and Country: Arm
them all. Nuke Iran, nuke the
whales, nuke the nukes. Non
proliferation is none of our busi
ness, what's a party without
party-goers? Let's let the Third
World in on the fun and everyone

will be an equal threat to each
other. 1 love the smell of
Plutonium in the morning.
My opponent has accused me
of saying things that I may have
said but 1 firmly believe I have
never said them. He's dis
criminating against me. Yes.
discrimination. I was just talk
ing to a small red-headed or
phan girl and her malnourished
dog in tne streets of New York
that crawled on my patent
leather shoes and dully mut
tered, "unkept promises, de
spair." That's the problem with
this administration, they've left
too many trees in the inner city
and all that smog is melting peo
ple's minds.
My opponent has fumbled
with the economy and it's all be
cause he can't lower taxes, in
crease spending, and balance
the budget. The Secretary of
Health and Welfare admitted
there was easily $42 billion of
waste in government. That's
where my secret lies, I'm cut
ting the waste.
Yes, waste. Waste is the re
sult of lazy people lacking
energy. Energy is indeed a ques
tion plaguing our nation. People
don't seem to realize that all our
oil lies under National Parks
and for some stupid reason the
federal government is keeping
our friends, the oil companies,
from drilling on these worthless
expanses of land. When I'm
president, I'll make sure fuel
costs don't rise by personally
strip mining the entire state of
Alaska. Let's leave it all to the
oil companies, they've got our
interest at heart.
My opponent has accused me
of wanting to make Social Se
curity voluntary. Why just yes
terday I remember talking to a
dear lady who took in her poor
desolate, downtrodden, nephew,
a victim of too much govern
ment. When her husband died
and they were forced to eat dog
food ... I can't continue.
Lastly, I'd just like to say that
Gene Autry will replace the
eagle as the national symbol and
won't you sleep better knowing
that I'm praying for you. By the
way ... did va here the one
about the Polish priest?
"Mr. Carter, Mr. Heagan has
seemingly taken most of your
time, you have one minute to
finish the 'Three Little Pigs.' "
Well, H.L. Mencken once
said, "there's always a small
bucket of schlop to satisfy a big
pig ." I'd just like to say that the
Oval Office is a LONELY place
with only Amy for company. I
was just talking to Amy and her
dog Checkers, just the other day
and she told me, "Dad. the
greatest problem is nuclear pro
liferation. Do you realize that if
you took a 10 megaton bomb
then that's equal to TNT in
traincars from New York to
LA? In fact, you could take all
the unemployed in America that
could form a line from New-
York to LA, and solve the entire
problem with the BIG BANG
theory."
So vote for me and remember
(let me interject John Kennedy
while I still have the chance), if
only one person in every pre
cinct voted against Kennedy
then .John wouldn't have been
elected. So sacrifice in the name
of America. I prefer sheep and
goats, and Thank You Cleveland

And they lived happily

Gentlemen, as you know, the
format of the debates has been
slightly modified to tailor to
both of your tastes. The mod
erator will initiate your con
frontation by reading the first
line of an undisclosed children's
fairy tale. Mr Reagan won the
toss and will have the first
CRACK at the story. 1 must re
mind the audience that if for
some reason either candidate
should fail to invoke Lincoln or
Kennedy, the oxygen masks
will fall from the ceiling. . . .
Good luck to both of you.
"ONCE upon a time there
were three little pigs . .
Mr. Reagan, you have three
minutes for discussion, rebut
tal. clarification and re
statement.
YES I'd like to point out that
at least one of us will finish this
story. 1 have so many intuitive
advantages that I'd like to dis
cuss. but since existence pre
cedes essence and the moon is in
the seventh house there are rea
sons that I'd enjoy discussing
why I am incapable of dis
cussion that 1 can't discuss. I'd
like to preface my argument by
referencing my past. I was in
the movies. I was a Democrat. I
was an idiot. I DID A LOT OF
FOOLISH THINGS, but I DID
IT IN CALIFORNIA and I've
been in my union for 36 years, so
when you go to SPILL YOUR
GUT FEELINGS into the ballot
box. look for the union label.
