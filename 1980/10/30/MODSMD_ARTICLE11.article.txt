As a Dailv staff member, 1
would like to express my ex
treme disappointment with the
editorial board's decision to en
dorse Republican Represent
ative Pete McCloskey in the up
coming Congressional elec
tions 1 believe strongly that this
candidate enjoys only minority
support among the Daily staff
as a whole, and wish to point out
to the Stanford community that
most staffers had nothing to do
with this endorsement decision
In view of the large anti-draft
sentiments on campus. I feel
that the board made a very ir
responsible choice in backing
McCloskey. a man who has been
ridiculed from one side of cam
pus to the other for his pro-draft
views (and rightly so). Other
candidates in the Congressional
race. Libertarian Bill Evers for
one. and Democrat Marc
Strassman even as a write-in.
offer significantly better
choices in their political plat
forms for this office.
In its coming endorsements. I
hope that the Daily editorial
board will take more time to
think of the views of its consti
tuency.

The internal pain is almost
unbearable. It rattles the brain
and shakes the nerves to a point
of uncontrollable anger directed
inward. Screaming or crying is
impossible Explosion is de
sired. byt no one cares to pull
the trigger. People do not want
to understand, they care, but not
really. They worry about their
own internal crises academics
first, then loneliness.
The solution is simple. One
person, one hand, a warm smile
or tender word. Yet no time.
The alternative of books and

studies has been proposed. Al
ter all there is no greater sensa
tion than an A. Why think about
life or people? Indulge yourself
into books. Make education your
religion, professors your
preacher, and books the guiding
bible.
What is happiness anyways?
Everyone at this holy place has
always known that happiness is
simply derived from studying;
for how else can one get closer
to God. and assure an eternal
happiness in a much desired lat
er life?
A pre-med roommate asks
how close the time is to mid
night. "Twelve more minutes,"
I respond "Why. what's hap
pening at midnight?" The room
mate rol Is over in bed and says.
"Oh. nothing much, just my
birthday."
"Why didn't you tell me?
Twelve minutes is hardly
enough time to plan anything.'
"I just really haven't had
time to think about it I'm so far
behind in my studies, and I've
got a midterm coming up at the
end of the week."
After a few moments of
thought. I reply. "Oh yeah, now

freshman orientation. The one

sarne as the last one. That what

I believe any kind of point by

would be nonproductive. How
ever, one brief note on some of
the "facts" which Peter takes
issue with is in order.
The Arms Control and Dis

armament Agency's document
Arms Control 1978 has the
SALT 11 protocol "banning the
deployment of mobile missile
launchers." That is "deploy
ment' and not "development."
While the situation may have
changed in the final document
and the protocol may not have
the same legal standing as the
treaty, it is nevertheless unfair
to accuse me of "gross ig
norance."
Besides, in both Peter's refer
ences to the MX and the B-l he
completely misses my point.
Rather than advocating any
particular weapons system. I
was instead seeking to illustrate
the president's vacillation.
Indeed. I myself am opposed
to the MX as it is now offered,
and so is Ronald Reagan, be
lieve it or not. It is too ex
pensive. it rapes the American

West, and its efficacy relies on a
treaty — not sound policy for
any weapons system.
