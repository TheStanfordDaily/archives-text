## Before the Invasion of the Body Snatchers 
### 
Ali week, they d been hurung catcalls
at each other — Did. didn't, did — like
kids you put out of the car to walk home.
Hp and down the country, memos laden
with statistics and invective, bearers of
bad-news-now-but-better-ahead. The
once and future kings, each accusing the
other of being political. It was global ten
sion this, Western alliance that, red her
rings. hot potatoes, and Manitest Desti
ny kept in reserve as a curtain line.
A fortnight short of polling day. there
were answers for everything under the
sun — the plight of the Palestinians, the
price of a head of cabbage. But the voter
wasn't listening Neither Jimmy Carter
nor Ronald Reagan had the inside story
on the one consuming question: Would
George Brett's bout of hemorrhoids stop
him playing for Kansas City against the
Phillies in the World Series?
They didn't The nation settled in with
six-packs to watch the Phillies take the
trophy home for the first time in 89
years. To applaud, exult, forget. Yet
something remained. It seemed ap
propriate that a man's piles had passed
into folklore, that rectal pain was a
household topic as the campaign trails
drove pellmell towards the 4th.
As the old anxieties bestirred them
selves, as doubts returned. Who's in the
race'.' Who's out? Who knows? Who
cares? Most crucially, which of the can
didates have the mullahs in Tehran
selected? Ron or Rosalynn. the Lady
with the W'hup? .John Anderson's not
mentioned any more, like a man's first
wife it a drinks party: and when he is,
it's in the past tense, the American
grammar of disgrace.
It's fun. in a sad way. to watch the
sales pitch on the TV stations, or the
flips r 'rom public speeches on the
(eatii. bulletins. The Carter people fa
,'or bandit camera; the street canvas. A
pollster thrusts a pine-cone mike into the
maws of half a dozen representative re

sponsible voters. Two whites, one give
hini-the-benefit, a black, a Chicano, a
geriatric: the accredited minorities.
When I think of Reagan. I get scared.
He shoots from the hip. you know.'' says
White Collar with Side-Burns. The old
lady agrees vehemently, her loose head
swinging. "He's had four vears. He'll
have experience. I trust President
Carter," she insists, a bowed gram
marian. Fade-out to a jaded Jimmy
stooped at his desk in the Oval Office,
gazing in despair at 1000 documents. It's
like an add for cocoa or mattresses.
Reagan's ads are even worse — if one
can see well enough in the murk to make
comparisons. My favorite s where the
brown stills shuttle past, a deck of
snapshots. First, we get the candidate
aged 10. toothy, thoughtful beyond his
years. Now he's 12. a nice kid, just like
■Johnny. Twenty-five, an actor but — lest
Middle America think this arty — a bad
one. tolks. relax. At 40, 43, he's guest of
honor at a buffet luncheon, champion of
organized labor . when you believe
this one. you'll believe the Teamsters

Ronald Reagan recently
said, "You could say lam
born amain. 'Wou' I ask
you. W hat kind of a life
must he have led to be
brought back as Ronald
Reagan?

take Communion daily.
Later still, he appears as saviour of the
Sunshine State, tax-cutter ex
traordinaire Last and least, the stills
quicken to incorporate footage from the
convention. At this point, the real Re
agan stands to cheers and many
balloons, a man of irreproachable

banality who can utter — without
flinching — the hack copy his tipstaffs
script for him.
"The time is now. my fellow Ameri
cans.'' he proclaims. "The place is here
We can get this country moving again, all
of us together. Then the self-taught
phenomenologist waves like the Pope,
and more balloons go up The balloons
look lovely on a color TV But the best is
the music as the lights dim. like the score
from a prairie western when the shy
scout who's fallen in love with the daugh
ter of the widow climbs a bluff and sees
wheatfields or pine forests. "Our chil
dren will grow uphere, Martha, and their
kids after them." "Oh Bill, really 9 "
What manner of beast is Reagan, a
man who's answered a call way beyond
that of duty, a man who won't allow even
his modesty to stand in his way 0 How
does he feel for instance about the puppet •
regimes that Uncle Sam's been funding
for a generation? "We cannot desert our
old friends." The ecology, sir 9 "A tree is
a tree — how many more do you have to
look at?" Evojution? "I have my
doubts."
But there's better news as well.
Ronald has the word from the Man
Himself that God listens to the prayers of
Jews quite as warmly as He overhears
the supplications of Southern Fundamen
talists. also that redwood trees may con
tribute to smog.
On one issue, he comes into his own:
resolute, articulate, stanced. And that's
abortion His opposition is costing him
more votes than i! s gaining. the 1 1 1 mi I
lion unborn hum,*n beings who've been
flushed from hiding in the name of the
dollar over the last 12 months are in no
position to answer his call.
The trouble with Reagan is not that he
has views, but that he has an ideology.
Only a first-or-fourth rate mind can af
ford such a thing, and Ron is neither
dunce nor boffin He's merely mediocre.

Decency is not sufficient You need some
waterproof grey matter where he's
headed. Something more — and less —
than good-will and religious faith In a
sudden excess of both, he remarked re
cently "You could say I am born
again ." Now I ask you. What kind of a life
must he have led to be brought back as
Ronald Reagan'.'
Ask Jimmy Carter. Find out how these
Christians love one another If one's to be
sure of aught in this svbilline world, it's
that C arter loathes Reagan only a little
less than he despises Ted Kennedy
These past few weeks, the president's

done by. nobody understands me.
Re's picked up on the prisoner's art as
well he can speak without moving his
lips Can this be because he has nothing
to say? Or is it that the deaf vote doesn't
count'' Small wonder. Rouse Speaker Tip
O'Neill, stumping for Jimmy on a "seven
Democrats praise Carter' spot, looked
awkward, harassed, hesitant. Lauding
the incumbent's merits puts one in a
tight spot, like finding 40 reasons to start
smoking.
