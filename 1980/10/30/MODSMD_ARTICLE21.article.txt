# Bill Evers has 'serious differences' with incumbent Rep.
## 
### Jeff Sims 
Libertarian Bill Evers is run
ning a vigorous campaign in the
12th Congresssional District, an
area which has traditionally
been a stronghold of Republican
Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Evers, 31, said he is running
for Congress because he has had
"serious differences with Mc-
Closkey on the issues for many
years." He claimed these dif
ferences have existed since Ev
ers was an editor at the Stanford
Daily and an anti-war and anti
draft activist during the period
of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
McCloskey has criticized Ev
ers' candidacy and the Liber
tarian party, saying that there
are no ma.ior issues to justify
the existence of third parties.
McCloskey predicted that can
didacies iike Evers' will even
tually end due to lack of public
support.
Evers defined the basic belief
of the Libertarian party as the
"central concern with individ
ual liberty and personal respon
sibility. People have a right to
chart their own destinies," said
Evers. "but should be held re
sponsible for their actions."
"All Libertarian policies are
based on this essential stand,"
said Evers. In an interview with
the Daily Evers discussed these
policies in the areas of the econ
omy, taxes, the draft, welfare,
abortion, and environmental is
sues.
"The real cause of inflation is
the government's printing of
money to pay for its debts," Ev
ers claimed. Evers supports a
proposed constitutional amend
ment to require a balanced fed
eral government budget and fa
vors placing the dollar on a gold
standard.
Along with decreasing feder
al spending, Evers would like to
initiate widespread tax cuts and
credits.
"I propose cutting the level of
taxes back to their 1962 levels,
after adjusting for inflation."
he said. Evers said he favors tax
credits for people who provide
care for the needy or who are
paying for someone's education.
To make up for lost revenues
from taxes, Evers would make
several major cuts in federal
spending. According to Evers,
these include "getting rid of the
energy department and ending
all forms of agricultural sub
sidies and special subsidies to
business."

Pavers and the Libertarian
Party would also like to cut gov
ernment spending by not enforc
ing "victimless crime" laws.
Evers said that prostitution,
gambling, and drug use should
be a matter of choice for the in
dividual.
However, Evers said the larg
est cut he favored would be $69
billion from the military
budget. According to Evers, this
could be accomplished by ter
minating the MX missile pro
gram and by "ending the power
projection of the United States
in the internal affairs of other
countries."
Evers said he favors bringing
back American troops from ov
erseas duty, stating that the de
fense of our shores should be our
primary concerrt. "We should
have more defensive instead of
offensively-oriented pro
grams."he said
Evers claimed that the allies
of the United States are capable
of contributing more toward
their own defense, thus reduc
ing the need for American
troops to be stationed in foreign
countries.
Evers has long been a strong
opponent of the draft. Calling
conscription a "form of
slavery," Evers said that a
draft is unnecessary.
The Libertarian Party would
like to eventually reduce or
phase out the government wel
fare program, said Evers, but
"our most important concern is
opening up the economy to those
who are left out of it." Evers
claimed that there is a struc
tural disincentive for those in
the welfare program not to es
cape from it which can be
blamed primarily on the gov
ernment.
There should not be laws pro
hibiting abortion, according to
Evers. but he is against govern
ment funding of abortions.
"In a democratic society, it is
very serious business to force a
person who thinks abortion is
bad to be forced to pay for it."
he said.
Concerning environmental is
sues, Evers said he was against
government ownership of wil
derness areas, stating that na
tional parklands and forests
would be better off if the Sierra
Club owned them. He also said
that all companies that cause
environmental damage should
be completely liable for the
damage they cause.

"All Libertarian policies are
based on this essential stand,"
said Evers. In an interview with
the Daily Evers discussed these
policies in the areas of the econ
omy, taxes, the draft, welfare,
abortion, and environmental is
sues.
"The real cause of inflation is
the government's printing of
money to pay for its debts," Ev
ers claimed. Evers supports a
proposed constitutional amend
ment to require a balanced fed
eral government budget and fa
vors placing the dollar on a gold
standard.
Along with decreasing feder
al spending, Evers would like to
initiate widespread tax cuts and
credits.
"I propose cutting the level of
taxes back to their 1962 levels,
after adjusting for inflation."
he said. Evers said he favors tax
credits for people who provide
care for the needy or who are
paying for someone's education.
To make up for lost revenues
from taxes, Evers would make
several major cuts in federal
spending. According to Evers,
these include "getting rid of the
energy department and ending
all forms of agricultural sub
sidies and special subsidies to
business."

Pavers and the Libertarian
Party would also like to cut gov
ernment spending by not enforc
ing "victimless crime" laws.
Evers said that prostitution,
gambling, and drug use should
be a matter of choice for the in
dividual.
However, Evers said the larg
est cut he favored would be $69
billion from the military
budget. According to Evers, this
could be accomplished by ter
minating the MX missile pro
gram and by "ending the power
projection of the United States
in the internal affairs of other
countries."
Evers said he favors bringing
back American troops from ov
erseas duty, stating that the de
fense of our shores should be our
primary concerrt. "We should
have more defensive instead of
offensively-oriented pro
grams."he said
Evers claimed that the allies
of the United States are capable
of contributing more toward
their own defense, thus reduc
ing the need for American
troops to be stationed in foreign
countries.
Evers has long been a strong
opponent of the draft. Calling
conscription a "form of
slavery," Evers said that a
draft is unnecessary.
The Libertarian Party would
like to eventually reduce or
phase out the government wel
fare program, said Evers, but
"our most important concern is
opening up the economy to those
who are left out of it." Evers
claimed that there is a struc
tural disincentive for those in
the welfare program not to es
cape from it which can be
blamed primarily on the gov
ernment.
There should not be laws pro
hibiting abortion, according to
Evers. but he is against govern
ment funding of abortions.
"In a democratic society, it is
very serious business to force a
person who thinks abortion is
bad to be forced to pay for it."
he said.
Concerning environmental is
sues, Evers said he was against
government ownership of wil
derness areas, stating that na
tional parklands and forests
would be better off if the Sierra
Club owned them. He also said
that all companies that cause
environmental damage should
be completely liable for the
damage they cause.

Libertarian Bill Evers is run
ning a vigorous campaign in the
12th Congresssional District, an
area which has traditionally
been a stronghold of Republican
Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Evers, 31, said he is running
for Congress because he has had
"serious differences with Mc-
Closkey on the issues for many
years." He claimed these dif
ferences have existed since Ev
ers was an editor at the Stanford
Daily and an anti-war and anti
draft activist during the period
of U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
McCloskey has criticized Ev
ers' candidacy and the Liber
tarian party, saying that there
are no ma.ior issues to justify
the existence of third parties.
McCloskey predicted that can
didacies iike Evers' will even
tually end due to lack of public
support.
Evers defined the basic belief
of the Libertarian party as the
"central concern with individ
ual liberty and personal respon
sibility. People have a right to
chart their own destinies," said
Evers. "but should be held re
sponsible for their actions."
