"I feel ordinary people are in
the majority, and if our ideals
are in their benefit, I feel the
majority will prevail," said
Adele Fumino. the Peace and
Freedom party candidate for
the 12th congressional district.
Fumino, a technical writer in
Santa Clara County for more
than 20 years, said that the
Peace and Freedom party is
committed to socialism and
feminism.
. "As representative from this
district I will work for equal op
portunity," she said. She cited
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment, equal rights for
gays and lesbians and extension
of the no forced-overtime law to
apply to men as examples of the
reforms she would work to leg
islate.
Fumino also stated that one of
the most important platforms of
her party is to work for peace.
"I am opposed to the draft."
she said. She also advocated rat
ification of SALT 11, further
pursuit of disarmament nego
tiations and cuts in military
spending.
According to Fumino. more
money should be spent on social
services. She said that while na
tionalizing health care would
probably wipe out profits, such
action would help to alieviate
some of the unequal distribution
in health benefits.
"The United States is four
teenth in the world in child mor
tality rates," she said, "and it's
not because we don't have good
health care. We have some of
the best medicine in the world,
but very poor health care de
livery. Health care is distorted.
You have people who need care
but can't afford it living in East
Palo Alto, right in the shadow of
Stanford Hospital and Medical
Center."
Fumino also said that she
would work for better health
and safety laws in the working
place.
"In the electronics industry,
only two percent of the workers
are unionized. And yet these
workers, mostly women, are
often dealing with dangerous
chemicals. There needs to be
laws to protect them," she said.
Other legislation which
Fumino said she would like to
see implemented in the work
er's interest is a strengthening
of the Occupational Safety and
Health Agency, legislation
"against the unionbusting firms
hired by corporations in this

area." She also said that failing
industries, such as the Chrysler
corporation, should be turned
over to the workers for man
agement.
"We shouldn't let Chrysler
close down, because too many
workers depend on their jobs
there. But we should attach
strings to the loans regarding
what the new products of the
company would be."
Fumino has worked with
community groups against the
problem of racism. Working
with Open Doors in Los Gatos,
she prepared bibliographies on
blacks and Latinos and helped
produce a play on black history
that was presented in several
West Valley Schools. She is a
member of the Women's In
ternational League for Peace
and Freedom, the Mid-Penin
sula Peace Conversion Project
and Friends of the Santa Clara
Solar Research Institute.
"We need to plan for social
needs," said Fumino, who sup
ports welfare reform. "I favor
any kind of increased benefits.
Social security, for instance,
should have a cost of living in
crease twice per year instead of
just once, as is now the case."
"I think it's a sure thing that
we'll go to improved socialism
in the long run," she said.
Fumino said she abides by her
party platform. "But in the
short range a lot of the reforms
we're working for will probably
be corrupted by the profit sys
tem."
She said she favors social
izing industries that are profit
able, such as the oil industries,
as well as those that are un
profitable, as the government
has done in the past (i.e. Am
trak).
Fumino maintains that part
of the reason the British system
of socialism has such negative
results is because the only in
dustries that have been social
ized are those which are un
profitable.
"In England and Sweden, the
largest percentage of industry
is privately owned," she said.
"All resources should be owned
by the public, not just the unsuc
cessful ones."
As part of her work towards
peace, Fumino supports con
version of military projects
here and elsewhere to useful
production in housing and trans
portation. She also endorses re
newable energy development
and energy alternatives such as
solar power.
