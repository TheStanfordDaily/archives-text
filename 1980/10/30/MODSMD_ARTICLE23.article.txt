# McCloskey favored to win seventh term
## 
### Todd Pickett 
Incumbent Republican can
didate Paul "Pete" McCloskey
is vying for his seventh term as
the 12th district's congressional
representative. A graduate of
the Stanford Law School class of
1953, McCloskey is the clear fa
vorite among the four can
didates competing for the House
seat.
Now in his thirteenth year in
the House of Representatives,
McCloskey first took office in
1967. In the four elections since
that time, he has collected 70
percent of the vote in a district
where Democratic voters hold a
five to four numerical advan
tage over Republican voters.
McCloskey is widely known
for his firm opposition to Ameri
can intervention in the Vietnam
war in the late '60s and early
'70s. As a means of protest, Mc-
Closkey actively campaigned in
the 1972 New Hampshire Re
publican presidential primary
against an otherwise unopposed
Richard Nixon.
More recently, McCloskey
has opposed reinstitution of the
old system of the national draft,
proposing his own program with
a National Youth Service op
tion.
His major objections to the
present all-volunteer force
stems from his observations of
the many unwilling and un
qualified soldiers that he sees in
today's armed forces, he said.
These deficiencies may be unaf
fordable in a war situation in
which good judgement and a

skilled handling of sophisticated
military equipment is essential,
according to McCloskey. He
alsopoints to the inability of the
all-volunteer force to recruit the
required number of youth for an
effective combat force as anoth
er major deficiency.
McCloskey said he finds no
justice in taking one in 10 youth
(women included) who turn 18
each year and sending them to
war while the others have been
arbitrarily allowed to remain,
as under the present draft sys
tem.
" The key to the problem,"
said McCloskey, " is restoration
of the concept that the privilege
of U.S. citizenship justifies a
universal duty of service to the
nation in one's youth."
McCloskey said he regards
himself as conservative on fis
cal issues, and said he sees the
issues that face this country as
primarily ones of "self-dis
cipline". McCloskey supports a
reduction of American reliance
on foreign oil,'and added that
each individual must reduce his
use of the automobile. He said
he advocates complete de
regulation of oil prices as a
means to motivate the con
sumer to conserve.
The most urgent problems to
day, according to McCloskey,
are the need to decrease govern
ment size and spending, along
with balancing the budget
through fiscal restraint.
In an effort to achieve these
goals, McCloskey has favored
the formation of a progressive
tax on gross income, along with

the abolishment of all deduc
tions except for business and
charity. The reformed tax
rates, suggests McCloskey, will
then be fitted to the budget ex
penditures approved by Con
gress each year, with the requi
site that the budget be balanced
in peacetime.
McCloskey has fought a grow
ing bureaucracy through some
involvement in cutting un
needed agencies and has spoken
out against federal spending
While a conservative on fiscal
issues, McCloskey declares he
is more liberal on social issues.
With regard to abortion, Mc-
Closkey supports the right of
each woman to choose freely,
calling the decision " a deeply
personal issue, involving a di
versity of religious and ethical
views."
Recognized as an environ
mentalist. McCloskey has in
troduced and sponsored various
bills dealing with the preserva
tion of game fish and streams,
water quality and wildlife pro
tection.
On the issue of women's
rights, McCloskey favors the
passage of the Equal Rights
Amendment and has co-spon
sored the Equal Credit and Op
portunity Act which advocated
a woman's right to obtain credit
regardless of marital status.
Although his political
philosophy more closely par
allels that of presidential can
didate John Anderson, Mc-
Closkey's firm belief in the two
party system leads him to sup
port Ronald Reagan.
