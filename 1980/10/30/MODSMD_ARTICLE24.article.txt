# Olsen wants to bring out issues, serve as model

### Fred Wainwright 
Kirsten Olsen is the De
mocratic candidate for Con
gress in the 12th district. She
ran for the same office two
years ago and received 58
percent of the primary election
votes, but Olsen said she is
basically trying ' to be a model
for other women and to bring
out the issues."
Originally from Denmark,
Olsen has lived in the Peninsula
for the last 30 years. She is a fi
nancial counselor with Paine,
Webber, Jackson and Curtis
Inc.. and is past vice president
of the California chapter of the
National Women's Caucus. In
1978 Olsen ran unsucessfully for
Congress against Republican
Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Olsen said she considers
herself a conservative Demo
crat in terms of fiscal policy,
but on social issues she is part of
the Democratic tradition On
the issue of the draft, Olsen said
she insists upon a volunteer
army.
"The draft is a program of in
voluntary servitude and ex
ploitation of youth without just
compensation," she said. Olsen
said she intends to help revive
the G.I. Bill and extend benefits
to the members of the military
service.
"The job market on the out
side is far too strong to make the
careers offered by the armed
forces seem attractive,"she
said. "A pay raise must be
created."

Olsen supports the Equal
Rights Amendment and is espe
cially interested in a private
business incentive for child
care.
"I believe that any state
which does not approve ERA
should be boycotted, mainly
with economic pressures," she
said.
On a general level, Olsen op
poses "the ultra-right Christian
groups which attack politicians
from the pulpit and try to in
fluence people's viewpoints."
"The only solution to this
would be to review some
church's tax exemption pro
grams. After all, there should
be separation of church and
state," she said.
On the issue of research and
development, Olsen said she be
lieves in making tax incentives
for private corporations work
ing on new technology. A tax re
duction on profits should be
made so as to increase invest
ments in the private sector.
Olsen is also in favor of gradu
ally lowering the penalties re
lated to marijuana. "The ul
timate result would be legal
ization," she said
McCloskey's idea of a new so
cial security card bearing a per
son's fingerprints and a picture
is, according to Olsen, "a clear
violation of civil rights."
Partial support from the
Democratic party, which con
cedes McCloskey's overwhelm
ing support, forced Olsen to
make her publicity campaign

very simple. It is based mainly
on printed advertisements and
mail lists, although Olsen has
appeared on television a few
times. Part of her funds are
private donations.
Olsen said that the pressure
of her 1978 campaign for an ex
tension of the time allowed for
ratification of the ERA con
tributed to convincing Mc-
Closkey to vote for the ex
tension. She also maintains that
the comprehensive maritime
reform which McCloskey in
troduced last year in congress
was due in part to legislation
which she had proposed.
Although she had been sup
porting John Anderson for presi
dent. Olsen said that she now
supports President Jimmy
Carter, although with reserva
tions.
"I really doubt that Anderson
has much of a chance any
more." she said. "And I support
Carter when I look at the alter
native."
Olsen said she supports the
development of alternative
energy sources such as solar.
On an international level,
Olsen said she feels Israeli
Prime Minister Begin's posi
tions are a little extreme.
"Jerusalem should probably
be made into an international
City," she said. "It is important
to many religions besides the
Jewish faith. Maybe something
on the order of Berlin would
have to be arranged."

Kirsten Olsen is the De
mocratic candidate for Con
gress in the 12th district. She
ran for the same office two
years ago and received 58
percent of the primary election
votes, but Olsen said she is
basically trying ' to be a model
for other women and to bring
out the issues."
Originally from Denmark,
Olsen has lived in the Peninsula
for the last 30 years. She is a fi
nancial counselor with Paine,
Webber, Jackson and Curtis
Inc.. and is past vice president
of the California chapter of the
National Women's Caucus. In
1978 Olsen ran unsucessfully for
Congress against Republican
Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
Olsen said she considers
herself a conservative Demo
crat in terms of fiscal policy,
but on social issues she is part of
the Democratic tradition On
the issue of the draft, Olsen said
she insists upon a volunteer
army.
"The draft is a program of in
voluntary servitude and ex
ploitation of youth without just
compensation," she said. Olsen
said she intends to help revive
the G.I. Bill and extend benefits
to the members of the military
service.
"The job market on the out
side is far too strong to make the
careers offered by the armed
forces seem attractive,"she
said. "A pay raise must be
created."

Olsen supports the Equal
Rights Amendment and is espe
cially interested in a private
business incentive for child
care.
"I believe that any state
which does not approve ERA
should be boycotted, mainly
with economic pressures," she
said.
On a general level, Olsen op
poses "the ultra-right Christian
groups which attack politicians
from the pulpit and try to in
fluence people's viewpoints."
"The only solution to this
would be to review some
church's tax exemption pro
grams. After all, there should
be separation of church and
state," she said.
On the issue of research and
development, Olsen said she be
lieves in making tax incentives
for private corporations work
ing on new technology. A tax re
duction on profits should be
made so as to increase invest
ments in the private sector.
Olsen is also in favor of gradu
ally lowering the penalties re
lated to marijuana. "The ul
timate result would be legal
ization," she said
McCloskey's idea of a new so
cial security card bearing a per
son's fingerprints and a picture
is, according to Olsen, "a clear
violation of civil rights."
Partial support from the
Democratic party, which con
cedes McCloskey's overwhelm
ing support, forced Olsen to
make her publicity campaign

very simple. It is based mainly
on printed advertisements and
mail lists, although Olsen has
appeared on television a few
times. Part of her funds are
private donations.
Olsen said that the pressure
of her 1978 campaign for an ex
tension of the time allowed for
ratification of the ERA con
tributed to convincing Mc-
Closkey to vote for the ex
tension. She also maintains that
the comprehensive maritime
reform which McCloskey in
troduced last year in congress
was due in part to legislation
which she had proposed.
Although she had been sup
porting John Anderson for presi
dent. Olsen said that she now
supports President Jimmy
Carter, although with reserva
tions.
"I really doubt that Anderson
has much of a chance any
more." she said. "And I support
Carter when I look at the alter
native."
Olsen said she supports the
development of alternative
energy sources such as solar.
On an international level,
Olsen said she feels Israeli
Prime Minister Begin's posi
tions are a little extreme.
"Jerusalem should probably
be made into an international
City," she said. "It is important
to many religions besides the
Jewish faith. Maybe something
on the order of Berlin would
have to be arranged."
