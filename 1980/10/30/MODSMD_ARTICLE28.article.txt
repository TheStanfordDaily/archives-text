## Opposition to nuke arms in Britain 
### 
London (AP) — After nearly
20 years in the doldrums, cam
paigners for disarmament are
marching again to protest Brit
ish purchase and deployment of
American nuclear weapons.
Membership in the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament —
the movement formed in 1958
with the help of famed
philosopher Bertrand Russell —
has doubled this year, to 7000.
Last Sunday 50,000 people came
to its biggest protest in almost
two decades.
U.S. Cruise missiles are due
in Britain and four other nations
in 1983. The missile is NATO's
response to the Soviet buildup of
medium-range nuclear weapons
aimed at Western Europe
And Britain has already
begun buying $12 billion worth
of Trident missiles from the
United States. They are due in
Britain in the 1990s as re
placements for the Polaris mis
siles. the ones that prompted the
mid-1960s marches.
"We have shown that the peo
ple of Britain are fed up,"
Monsignor Bruce Kent, a Ro
man Catholic priest and CND
secretary, said in an interview.
He argued that cruise mis
siles in Britain make it a prime
Soviet target: "Britons realize
that they are on a course of max
imum danger. There are not
enough targets for all the weap
ons."
Anti-nuclear sentiment re
vived this year as Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher followed her hawkish
campaign promises to make
Britain a staunch U.S. ally in
containing communism and to
rebuild her nation's defenses
"after years of neglect" by pre
vious administrations.
Further fueling the protests
are welfare spending cuts, last
year's reactor accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant in Pennsylvania
and publication of a civil de
fense booklet telling people
what steps to take in case of a
nuclear attack.
The protesters of 1980 look far
more politically significant
than the radical, left-wing
young people who protested
British acquisition of Polaris

nuclear missiles.
Sunday's rally in London at
tracted prominent figures from
the opposition Labor Party, the
centrist Liberal Party and the
trade union movement, along
with dozens of enviromental,
pacifist and religious groups
and a sprinkling of Communists
and anarchists.
This means the unilateralists
now include legislators who
hope to oust Thatcher in elec
tions that must take place by
early 1984.
"Unilateralists" opposing the
purchase of Trident missiles
have some strange and influen
tial bedfellows. They include re
tired military chiefs and
academic nuclear analysts who
say the 5 billion pound Trident
program will mean skimping on
conventional weapons.
Military critics of Trident,
such as Field Marshal Lord
Carver, the former Chief of De
fense Staff, say Britain could
never be an independent nuclear
power anyway.
Retired generals argue that
the Tridents — to be deployed as
part of Britain's NATO con
tribution — will merely leave
Britain too poor to buy the
tanks, artillery and warplanes it
needs for its own defense and its
commitments to the Western
military alliance.
Thatcher remains adamant
that the only way to talk to Mos
cow is from a position of
strength. She tells her critics
Britain will find enough money
to buy Trident missiles as well
as to maintain conventional
weaponry. Despite tough budget
cuts for all other departments,
defense spending has increased
steadily since Thatcher took of
fice.
"We have no wish to seek a
free ride at the expense of our
allies," Thatcher told her par
ty's conference this month.
Kent sees nuclear disarma
ment as a serious business of
"educating" average Britons,
persuading citizens to elect a
Labor government that will
"send back" the Cruise mis
siles, as promised by Michael
Foot, deputy Labor leader and
main left-wing contender for the
party's leadership next year.

persuading citizens to elect a
Labor government that will
"send back" the Cruise mis
siles, as promised by Michael
Foot, deputy Labor leader and
main left-wing contender for the
party's leadership next year.
London (AP) — After nearly
20 years in the doldrums, cam
paigners for disarmament are
marching again to protest Brit
ish purchase and deployment of
American nuclear weapons.
Membership in the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament —
the movement formed in 1958
with the help of famed
philosopher Bertrand Russell —
has doubled this year, to 7000.
Last Sunday 50,000 people came
to its biggest protest in almost
two decades.
U.S. Cruise missiles are due
in Britain and four other nations
in 1983. The missile is NATO's
response to the Soviet buildup of
medium-range nuclear weapons
aimed at Western Europe
And Britain has already
begun buying $12 billion worth
of Trident missiles from the
United States. They are due in
Britain in the 1990s as re
placements for the Polaris mis
siles. the ones that prompted the
mid-1960s marches.
"We have shown that the peo
ple of Britain are fed up,"
Monsignor Bruce Kent, a Ro
man Catholic priest and CND
secretary, said in an interview.
He argued that cruise mis
siles in Britain make it a prime
Soviet target: "Britons realize
that they are on a course of max
imum danger. There are not
enough targets for all the weap
ons."
Anti-nuclear sentiment re
vived this year as Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher followed her hawkish
campaign promises to make
Britain a staunch U.S. ally in
containing communism and to
rebuild her nation's defenses
"after years of neglect" by pre
vious administrations.
Further fueling the protests
are welfare spending cuts, last
year's reactor accident at the
Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant in Pennsylvania
and publication of a civil de
fense booklet telling people
what steps to take in case of a
nuclear attack.
The protesters of 1980 look far
more politically significant
than the radical, left-wing
young people who protested
British acquisition of Polaris

nuclear missiles.
Sunday's rally in London at
tracted prominent figures from
the opposition Labor Party, the
centrist Liberal Party and the
trade union movement, along
with dozens of enviromental,
pacifist and religious groups
and a sprinkling of Communists
and anarchists.
This means the unilateralists
now include legislators who
hope to oust Thatcher in elec
tions that must take place by
early 1984.
"Unilateralists" opposing the
purchase of Trident missiles
have some strange and influen
tial bedfellows. They include re
tired military chiefs and
academic nuclear analysts who
say the 5 billion pound Trident
program will mean skimping on
conventional weapons.
Military critics of Trident,
such as Field Marshal Lord
Carver, the former Chief of De
fense Staff, say Britain could
never be an independent nuclear
power anyway.
Retired generals argue that
the Tridents — to be deployed as
part of Britain's NATO con
tribution — will merely leave
Britain too poor to buy the
tanks, artillery and warplanes it
needs for its own defense and its
commitments to the Western
military alliance.
Thatcher remains adamant
that the only way to talk to Mos
cow is from a position of
strength. She tells her critics
Britain will find enough money
to buy Trident missiles as well
as to maintain conventional
weaponry. Despite tough budget
cuts for all other departments,
defense spending has increased
steadily since Thatcher took of
fice.
"We have no wish to seek a
free ride at the expense of our
allies," Thatcher told her par
ty's conference this month.
Kent sees nuclear disarma
ment as a serious business of
"educating" average Britons,
persuading citizens to elect a
Labor government that will
"send back" the Cruise mis
siles, as promised by Michael
Foot, deputy Labor leader and
main left-wing contender for the
party's leadership next year.
