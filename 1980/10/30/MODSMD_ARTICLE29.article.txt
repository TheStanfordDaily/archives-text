# Pope issues new celebacy ruling
## 
### 
Vatican City (AP) — Pope John Paul 11, ending
a two-year freeze on granting dispensation from
vows of priestly celibacy, has issued new
guidelines to allow Roman Catholic priests to
leave the priesthood and marry but still remain in
the church.
The decision removes a major source of tension
in the church created by the pope's refusal to
process almost 5000 petitions on file from priests
seeking release from their vows, Vatican sources
said.
The papal directive is in a letter to bishops and
heads of religious orders from Cardinal Franjo
Seper, head of the Sacred Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, formerly called the Holy
Office.
The celibacy rule is believed to be a main rea
son behind the sharp increase in the defections of
Roman Catholic priests in recent years.
There are about 4000 defections a year, or 1
percent of the world's 400.000 priests. This is
double the rate during the pontificate of Pope
Paul VI. In the United States, almost 8000 priests
are said to have left the priesthood since 1965.
The letter said the guidelines result from a
study ordered by the pope "to determine the
causes involved and to find a suitable solution'' to
the increasing requests for release from celibacy
vows.
The guidelines appear to be "more precise and
somewhat more relaxed than the ones used by

Pope Paul VI." said a Rome-based cleric who
asked not to be identified.
Reaffirming the church's 1500-year-old ban on
priestly marriage, the letter stated: "It is impor
tant that the priests give an example of fidelity in
their commitment to their vocation until death."
The letter said the Vatican now will now con
sider dispensations if the petitions fall under any
of these categories:
—"Priests who have left priestly life for a long
period of time." The cleric explained that this re
fers to priests who left the priesthood and married
outside the church and who may have children.
—"Priests who should never have been or
dained priests because the necessary, responsible
freedom to choose the ordination was lacking."
—If, before ordination, a superior misjudged
the man's suitability for celibate life. A cleric
seeking dispensation under this category will
need supporting letters from the rector of his
seminary.
Priests in the Eastern Rite of the Roman Catho
lic Church and ministers in most non-Catholic
Christian churches may marry.
The almost 5000 requests for dispensation have
been filed since John Paul's election in October
1978, but the Polish-born pontiff has refused to
consider them. By contrast, Pope Paul VI re
ceived 32,357 requests during his 15-year pon
tificate and granted all but 1033 of them.
