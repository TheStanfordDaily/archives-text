# Polish workers set to strike
## 
### Washington Post 
Gdansk, Poland — Leaders of
Poland's national free trade un
ion federation agreed Tuesday
night to a showdown meeting
with Prime Minister Jozef
Pinkowski in Warsaw tomor
row, but set a Nov. 12 "strike
alert" if the talks fail to settle
deep grievances.
In as tense a climate as there
has been between Polish work
ers and the government since
summer, labor leader Lech
Walesa met here Tuesday after
noon with Vice Premier
Mieczyslaw Jagielski, who trav
eled from Warsaw for the ur
gent conference after union rep
resentatives Monday insisted
that the prime minister himself
come to Gdansk.

The intense maneuvering be
tween the young Free Union
Movement and the Warsaw gov
ernment is a key test not only of
the new power relationship in
Poland, but also of the contest
between radical and moderate
forces within the labor feder
ation Solidarity itself.
During two days of meetings
here, union delegates debated
fiercely what measures to take
to persuade the government to
act on nagging grievances. The
final decision — to meet
Pinkowski tomorrow in Warsaw
under the pressure of a strike
deadline — represented a com
promise, appealing both to mod
erates who argued for more
talks and to a strong militant
wing advocating a quick strike
unless union d lands were
met.
Strike indefinite
The Nov. 12 date gives the
country time to work out its
latest crisis. The extent of the
threatened strike, moreover,
was left indefinite. A general
strike appeared to have been
ruled out as too costly and
drastic a move at this time, with
labor leaders instead opting for
some sort of selective work
stoppage with the sites still to be
selected.
In any case, the union action
makes tomorrow's talks crucial
and places considerable pres
sure on the Warsaw government
to find a compromise of its own
to defuse the mounting confron
tation.
Announcing the coming meet
ing on national television news
Tuesday night, a government
press statement sought to dispel
a sense of conflict.
But union delegates will
clearly be going to Warsaw an
gry. At the top of their list of de
mands is new assurances from
the government that the free un
ions will be allowed to stay inde
pendent despite last week's rul
ing by a Warsaw court. The

court registered the national
federation, Solidarity, but in the
process forced changes in the
organization's charter — one in
serting an explicit statement of
the leading role of the Com
munist Party in the Polish
state, the other throwing out a
clause defining the workers'
new right to strike.
Workers resist
Although workers honored
the leading role of the party and
other Communist principles in
the agreement signed with gov
ernment in Gdansk which ended
the summer strikes here, they
resist having such a statement
included in the Solidarity stat
utes on grounds it would politic
ize what they insist is a non
political union.
At the same time, that such
wording be included is of
critical importance not only to
the government but particularly
to Poland's Socialist allies, al
ready uneasy about the inde
pendent union alliance.
The question the unions them
selves are asking is whether the
granting of independence has
been a tactical move by the
Warsaw government in light of
the court decision, which they
fear is a sign of the govern
ment's determination even
tually to subordinate the new
movement.
Dangerous tension
A resolution issued by Soli
darity's national coordinating
committee spoke of "dangerous
tension" among the workers as
a result of the court decision and
the need for a new agreement
further to guarantee independ
ence.
There is some question,
though, how much popular sup
port exists for a major strike
over the registration issue, giv
en the worsening shortages in
Poland as a result of the sum
mer's work stoppages and the
fact that, after all, the govern
ment did register.

clause defining the workers'
new right to strike.
Workers resist
Although workers honored
the leading role of the party and
other Communist principles in
the agreement signed with gov
ernment in Gdansk which ended
the summer strikes here, they
resist having such a statement
included in the Solidarity stat
utes on grounds it would politic
ize what they insist is a non
political union.
At the same time, that such
wording be included is of
critical importance not only to
the government but particularly
to Poland's Socialist allies, al
ready uneasy about the inde
pendent union alliance.
The question the unions them
selves are asking is whether the
granting of independence has
been a tactical move by the
Warsaw government in light of
the court decision, which they
fear is a sign of the govern
ment's determination even
tually to subordinate the new
movement.
Dangerous tension
A resolution issued by Soli
darity's national coordinating
committee spoke of "dangerous
tension" among the workers as
a result of the court decision and
the need for a new agreement
further to guarantee independ
ence.
There is some question,
though, how much popular sup
port exists for a major strike
over the registration issue, giv
en the worsening shortages in
Poland as a result of the sum
mer's work stoppages and the
fact that, after all, the govern
ment did register.

annual party conference last month. Thatcher is under increasing fire for her tough stand on nuclear
weapons.
Gdansk, Poland — Leaders of
Poland's national free trade un
ion federation agreed Tuesday
night to a showdown meeting
with Prime Minister Jozef
Pinkowski in Warsaw tomor
row, but set a Nov. 12 "strike
alert" if the talks fail to settle
deep grievances.
In as tense a climate as there
has been between Polish work
ers and the government since
summer, labor leader Lech
Walesa met here Tuesday after
noon with Vice Premier
Mieczyslaw Jagielski, who trav
eled from Warsaw for the ur
gent conference after union rep
resentatives Monday insisted
that the prime minister himself
come to Gdansk.

The intense maneuvering be
tween the young Free Union
Movement and the Warsaw gov
ernment is a key test not only of
the new power relationship in
Poland, but also of the contest
between radical and moderate
forces within the labor feder
ation Solidarity itself.
During two days of meetings
here, union delegates debated
fiercely what measures to take
to persuade the government to
act on nagging grievances. The
final decision — to meet
Pinkowski tomorrow in Warsaw
under the pressure of a strike
deadline — represented a com
promise, appealing both to mod
erates who argued for more
talks and to a strong militant
wing advocating a quick strike
unless union d lands were
met.
Strike indefinite
The Nov. 12 date gives the
country time to work out its
latest crisis. The extent of the
threatened strike, moreover,
was left indefinite. A general
strike appeared to have been
ruled out as too costly and
drastic a move at this time, with
labor leaders instead opting for
some sort of selective work
stoppage with the sites still to be
selected.
In any case, the union action
makes tomorrow's talks crucial
and places considerable pres
sure on the Warsaw government
to find a compromise of its own
to defuse the mounting confron
tation.
Announcing the coming meet
ing on national television news
Tuesday night, a government
press statement sought to dispel
a sense of conflict.
But union delegates will
clearly be going to Warsaw an
gry. At the top of their list of de
mands is new assurances from
the government that the free un
ions will be allowed to stay inde
pendent despite last week's rul
ing by a Warsaw court. The

court registered the national
federation, Solidarity, but in the
process forced changes in the
organization's charter — one in
serting an explicit statement of
the leading role of the Com
munist Party in the Polish
state, the other throwing out a
clause defining the workers'
new right to strike.
