# Internships: getting a look at tomorrow

### Conrad Bock 
"My internship really helped
direct me in terms of the future.
After working with these kids I
decided that I wanted a career
helping people. It made me re
alize that I have an ability; I
was really out there doing it."
For many students like senior
Rob Harris, one of the most im
portant aspects of the college
experience is that which is
gained outside the classroom
working in the "real world".
Whether one is pursuing a ca
reer in public relations or in me
chanical engineering, a wide va
riety of companies provide in
ternship opportunities for on
the-job experience. And in to
day's market, this can prove to
be a valuable and often neces
sary asset.
There are nine different or
ganizations on campus which
assist the student in getting
these internships. Some, such as
Stanford-in-Business and Stan
ford-in-Law, help the student
with summertime employment.
Others, like the Action Re
search Liason Office (ARLO)
and the Stanford Center for In
novation in Research and
Education (SCIRE), are clear
inghouses for school-year op
portunities which in some cases
can be done for academic cred
it.
A necessity
"In many instances, the in
terns are an indispensible asset.
I think the organizations have
found they couldn't get by
without them, because these are
not simply makeshift projects;
they are projects that are im
portant to complete," said Rob
ert Lawrence, director of the
California Environmental In
tern Program (CTEIP).
"That's one of the reasons the
program has been able to grow.
We started in 1977 with 40 in
terns (involved with 15 groups).
This year we'll probably have
110 interns in over 60 groups."
CTEIP is a non-profit or
ganization which places individ
uals in paid internships. Their
goal, according to the literature
they distribute, is to provide or
ganizations with skilled individ
uals and to provide students
with professional experience in

environmental companies.
"The growth is an indication
that the quality of the people
and the service they offer is
very much needed and the per
formance they're putting in is
very helpful," Lawrence con
cluded.
Enthusiastic
Marion Camerion, director of
the Community Training Center
at the Veterans Administration
Hospital in Palo Alto has simi
lar enthusiasm.
"We've had some extremely
productive students. They have
taught classes and created new
ones that have become a gutsy
part of the program." she said.
Student reaction to the in
ternships vary, as most students
said they found that the ex
perience was "pretty much
what you make it." Many said
they felt very integrated in the
structure of the place they in
terned.
"Basically, I was a staff
member," said Shivonne Byrne,
speaking of her experience with
the Stanford Alumni Associa
tion. "I was expected to do staff
work and rise to their level of
competence."
"The interns are a closely in
tegral part of us. They are work
ing members in all phases, from
general administration to scene
shop and acting," said Paul
Nicholson, assistant manager of
the Oregon Shakespeare Festi
val Association.
Take the initiative
Jack Silvev. assistant manag
ing editor of the Peninsula
Times Tribune said it was im
portant for interns to feel like a
part of the staff.
"They start right out getting
assignments. In very short or
der their bylines appear. We en
courage them to write the type
of stories that they would like to
see their bylines on, because it
generates pride in their work,"
he said.
The large amount of control
that the students have in choos
ing their own responsibilities
within an internship is some
times an initial stumbling
block.
"Students go through a period
when they're very bewildered
because it isn't all laid out like a
course," said Cissie Rafferty,

director of ARLO.
"The amount of initiative is
crucial. The intern should ask
for work in addition to what's
being assigned if they are dis
satisfied," said Judy Adams, di
rector of SCIRE.
"Two interns at the same
agency could have divergent ex
periences," she pointed out.
The choice
However, Adams said, some
work should be put into choosing
the proper employer.The in
ternship seeker should treat
every opening individually to

avoid the problems of mis
matched expectations.
For instance, some com
panies' idea of an internship
may be nothing more than ob
serving the action; or, as Carol
Nooner found working in a bro
kerage firm, she "needed a
license to do anything really im
portant."
Fred Storev, a mechanical

engineer here, said that he had a
disappointing quarter at AMES.
"Instead of doing experi
ments, most of the time was
spent repairing equipment,
which is not what I had ex
pected. As far as an academic
experience, it was pretty lim
ited," he said.
"It's not something I can
blame on SCIRE or AMES. It
was just the condition of the ex
periments were in at the time.
They were taking a break and
getting all the apparatus togeth
er and repaired." Storey con-

eluded.
Other students agreed that in
ternships may not provide the
opportunity to accomplish what
you initially anticipated
"I expected to go into a class
where the kids wanted to learn
the material," said senior
Helodia Cazares of her teaching
experience.
"The kids I was tutoring were

not very motivated. Most didn't
know what else to take or took it
because they were forced to by
their families. Since it was my
first experience I had no back
ground to know what to do to get
their motivation up," Cazares
explained.
Despite the trouble, Cazares
said she was not sorry she did it
and offered some reasons.
"It gave me a lot more aware
ness of what's going on in bil
ingual education and that is a
field that interests me.
"It was a good experience to

tell me that there was no way I
could deal with that situation. I
personally would not be a good
teacher because I react too
much to the depression of the
kids. So 1 wouldn't be someone
to cheer them up when they're
down or pick up their motivation
when it's low," Cazares con
tinued

Senior Rob Harris said his
two internships also helped
focus his interests.
"During the first internship I
noticed some of the kids just
didn't progress.no matter how
hard I tried with them, whereas
in others I saw a lot of progress.
That got me thinking about what
makes their ability to learn dif
ferent and that go me rolling as
far as psychology is con
cerned," Harris said.
"In the second one I worked
down at the Juvenile Probation
Department of Santa Clara as a
substance abuse counselor with
adolescents I facilitated the in
teraction between the kids and
parents, trying to get them to
understand each other's per
spectives on drug use and grow
ing up in today's society. It reaf
firmed that I enjoy working
with adolescent populations in
particular and that I'm in

terested in the whole question of
substance abuse and
adolescence." Harris em
phasized.
Tom Hurley, also a senior
here, mentioned some per
spectives he gained through his
experiences.
'' You can easily get caught up
in being a college student and
doing evervthibg on campus. If
you let yourself become that
way. you're living in your own
little world and not preparing
yourself for after you get out of
college when you have to deal
with other people." he said.
"It's kind of hypocritical for a
lot of students to parade around
campus about what sad shape
the schools are in and saying
how sorry they feel for the poor
people. That's all they do, they
don't go further than the spoken
word. It makes me feel good
that I've tried to help out,"said
Hurlev.

Concerning practical advice,
Nooner said she wished she had
done her internship as a
sophomore instead of a senior
because she knows better now
what she does not want to do.
"It would be nice if things
were a little more set up. I had
to find my own advisor in the ec
onomics department and I
didn't know any of the profs,"
she said. She added that a list of
teachers willing to sponsor
would have been helpful.
"People have to be very
careful about whom they choose
as their academic advisor. Find
out what their commitment is
going to be because you can
learn a lot from faculty mem
bers. If they're overworked, it's
a downer because they can't
spend time with you and it's sup
posed to be an academic ex
perience," Byrne advised.
"The hardest thing is the
combination of three different

sponsors," she continued. Stu
dents must get an advisor from
SCIRE, a faculty sponsor, and
the agency to work for.
"There are three places you
have to plug into all the time and
I think that's a drain, especially
if you don't have a good working
relationship with all three,"
said Byrne.
"There was a problem not
knowing other people in the pro
gram. There wasn't enough op
portunity to discuss problems
you were having with other stu
dents in the program that were
having the same problems,"
Hurley said of some of his ex
perience with the Under
graduate Program in the School
of Education.
For those interested in being
rehired by the companies they
do internships with, they will
find the response generally
positive.
"It's a step in the door type of

thing. We do get a chance to look
at people and determine how
well they're suited and whether
they'd fit into the organization.
As a result, when there is hiring
done, especially at the entry
level, interns have an advantage
there." said Silvey. "Of course,
this doesn't mean we hire every
intern."
"We prefer people who have
experience with the organiza
tion and what we're doing and in
most cases we can have job of
fers for them. Our problem is
that the experience they gain
here makes them more salable
to outside industry," said An
nette Labov of NASA-AMES.
"Students who don't have
anything beyond their
bachelor's can't compete for the
great jobs, and so they use out
jobs as stepping stones to other
things, or work part time and go
to school." Cameron com
mented.
