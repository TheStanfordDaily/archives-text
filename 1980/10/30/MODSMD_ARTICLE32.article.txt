# Carter estimate far short, budget deficit at $59 billion
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The federal budget defi
cit for fiscal 1980. originally estimated
by President Jimmy Carter to be $29
billion when he presented it in January
1979, was instead $59 billion, the Treas
ury Department announced yesterday.
It was the second-largest deficit in his
tory, surpassed only bv the $66.4 billion
red-ink figure for 1976, the last year of
the Ford administration. The deficit for
fiscal 1980, which ended Sept. 30. was $1.9
billion less than the administration's last
public estimate made in July.
The sharp but brief recession and an
inflation rate far higher than forecast to
gether helped boost outlays to $579
billion, up $47 4 billion from original esti
mates.
Meanwhile, the effect of the recession

in reducing tax receipts was over
whelmed by the tendency of higher infla
tion rates to increase them. Revenues
for 1980 turned out to be $520 billion com
pared with the $502.6 billion estimate in
the original budget, the department said.
Both liberals and conservatives have
criticized the administration for "losing
control" of federal spending in 1980, and
Carter's Republican opponent, Ronald
Reagan, has promised to cut sharply the
growth of federal spending if he is
elected.
But administration budget officials
question whether Reagan or anyone else
could have produced a different result in
1980. Except in the defense area, they
said they had little choice but to let out
lays rise. In defense, Carter had pledged
that spending would go up in real terms,

that is, after a full allowance for infla
tion.
The original budget estimates had as
sumed a better performance by the econ
omy than occurred. Inflation was fore
cast to be 7.5 percent in calendar 1979 and
6.4 percent in 1980. It turned out to be 13.2
percent last year and probably will be
about 12 percent this year.
Unemployment, on the other hand,
was forecast to be 6.2 percent each year.
In 1979 it was less than that, only 5.7
percent, but with the recession this year
probably will average about 7.2 percent.
These changes in the economy, com
pared with the forecasts, accounted for
$26.9 billion worth of the $47.4 billion in
crease in spending, according to W.
Bowman Cutter, executive associate di
rector of the Office of Management and

Budget. •
Mandatory increases in domestic pro
grams, such as for higher Social Security
benefits because of inflation, added up to
$20.4 billion of the $26.9 billion.
Another $6.5 billion went to the De
fense Dept. to cover thegreater-than-ex
pected inflation, including much higher
fuel bills. Cutter said.
Defense outlays also rose $3.3 billion
as a result of policy changes. Most of this
money went for higher operating costs
associated with sending more naval and
other military units to the Indian Ocean.
Congress did its bit, too. It refused to
pass Carter's proposed hospital cost con
tainment program, which caused outlays
to go up for Medicare and Medicaid by
about $1.8 billion. Another $700 million in
cost-saving proposals also failed to pass.

lays rise. In defense, Carter had pledged
that spending would go up in real terms,

that is, after a full allowance for infla
tion.
The original budget estimates had as
sumed a better performance by the econ
omy than occurred. Inflation was fore
cast to be 7.5 percent in calendar 1979 and
6.4 percent in 1980. It turned out to be 13.2
percent last year and probably will be
about 12 percent this year.
Unemployment, on the other hand,
was forecast to be 6.2 percent each year.
In 1979 it was less than that, only 5.7
percent, but with the recession this year
probably will average about 7.2 percent.
These changes in the economy, com
pared with the forecasts, accounted for
$26.9 billion worth of the $47.4 billion in
crease in spending, according to W.
Bowman Cutter, executive associate di
rector of the Office of Management and

Budget. •
Mandatory increases in domestic pro
grams, such as for higher Social Security
benefits because of inflation, added up to
$20.4 billion of the $26.9 billion.
Another $6.5 billion went to the De
fense Dept. to cover thegreater-than-ex
pected inflation, including much higher
fuel bills. Cutter said.
Defense outlays also rose $3.3 billion
as a result of policy changes. Most of this
money went for higher operating costs
associated with sending more naval and
other military units to the Indian Ocean.
Congress did its bit, too. It refused to
pass Carter's proposed hospital cost con
tainment program, which caused outlays
to go up for Medicare and Medicaid by
about $1.8 billion. Another $700 million in
cost-saving proposals also failed to pass.
