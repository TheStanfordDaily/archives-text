Blast rocks Chinese capital
Beijing — A mysterious explosion rocked
central Beijing's crowded main railroad
station yesterday and witnesses said about
20 persons were killed or wounded. Most of
ficials refused to comment, but one called it
an accident.
A foreign ministry spokesman said au
thorities were investigating the 6:15 p.m.
"accident" but gave no details.
Reports of casualties could not be im
mediately confirmed, but a steady stream
of ambulances left the station.
One man in the crowd of several thousand
people gathered outside the station said the
explosion occurred in an elevator and about
20 people were killed or wounded.
An unconfirmed report going through the
crowd said the explosion was caused by a
bundle of firecrackers. A series of serious
fireworks explosions on trains and in rail
way stations earlier this year prompted a
crackdown at the time on persons carrying
such items.
There was no damage visible from out
side the building, with its huge central wait
ing room and Chinese-style towers at each
end. Those inside were kept away from the
central area, and some coming out said they
had seen no signs of damage.
Chrysler loses $490 million
Detroit — Chrysler Corp. yesterday re
ported losses of $490 million in the third
quarter of the year, one day after Ford Mo
tor Co. reported losses of $595 million, the
worst quarterly loss in the auto industry's
history.
The Chrysler announcement brought the
total red ink for the auto industry's Big
Three companies to $1.65 billion for the
July-September period. General Motors
Corp. said Monday it lost $567 million.

American Motors Corp. is to announce its
figures in early November.
Chrysler's loss this quarter brought the
company's total deficits to $2.54 billion over
the past seven quarters.
Chrysler sales for the quarter fell 20
percent from $2.5 billion to $2.0 billion.
But Chrysler was the only one of the Big
Three to show improved results in the quar
ter compared with this year's second quar
ter. The company lost $536 million in the
April-June period. It was the first time
since 1950 that Chrysler's third quarter re
sults, usually depressed by the model
changeover costs, were better than the sec
ond quarter results.
GAO urges end to reviews
Washington — The General Accounting
Office proposed yesterday that the govern
ment abandon its practice of reviewing old
classified documents and declassifying
those that can safely be made public.
At issue are 617 million pages dealing
with state secrets of war, peace, diplomacy,
arms control, espionage, trade negotiations
and other government activies in the area of
national security.
The GAO, a government watchdog agen
cy, cited the $11 million it costs each year to
pay people to review the old papers. The re
view of classified documents was put into
effect by an executive order signed by Pres
ident Jimmy Carter in 1978.
Dow average slips 3.41
New York — Stock prices retreated in
fairly slow trading yesterday as the nation's
banking industry raised the base business
loan rate to 14.5 percent, its highest level
since May.

stocks, after managing small gains through
much of the session, closed with a loss of
3.41 at 929.18. Losing issues outnumbered
gainers by a 7-6 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange.

modest compared to the American Stock
Exchange. Big drops in the prices of some
Canadian oil stocks sent the Amex market
value index tumbling 11.18 points to 344.41.
Big Board volume was fairly light at 37.20
million shares, down from 40.30 million in
the previous session.
