# A 						president's vision: 'what things might be'
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Donald Kennedy hardly looks
like a radical. His manner is re
laxed, his voice is calm, and he
smiles a lot of the time. Yet
even as he settles into a new job,
that of president of the Univer
sity, there is a sense across the
campus that his presidency is
ushering in an era of great
change and of renewed expecta
tion.
Kennedy himself seems to en
joy the images. "I want to be a
cultivator of enthusiasm and a
good agent of consensus," he
says, but he also makes it clear
that he wants much to do with
the formulation of that con
sensus. He speaks in broad
terms of "programs of growth"
and "programs of change,"
stressing the need for both, but
adds that "my own personal
qualities are even more essen
tial for programs of change.
"There is a sense in which we
as an institution are all right,
with a good balance among our
parts, and that all we would
need to do is to keep our annual
giving going, our total gifts
going up, and (increasing num
bers) applying to be admitted.
That's the agenda which every
president has, and to it he brings
whatever enthusiasm, guile and
armtwisting ability he has.

"But then there are other
things which the president
needs to do to change the shape
of the University. We need now
not just to grow, but to change
the relationship of our parts,"
he said.
Goals targeted
The thing which many have
found exciting about Kennedy's
presidency so far is that he has
not only appeared ready to do
the job. he has also been
articulate at explaining just
what his own special agenda
here will be.
Above all, Donald Kennedy
seems to have targeted for
himself two major goals: the
reformation of undergraduate
education and a reemphasis on
the humanities. These themes,
at least from Kennedy, are not
new — he mentioned these as
priorities even as he was leav
ing Washington and his post as
commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration to return
to Stanford as vice president
and provost in August 1979.
Since then, while he brings
with him a number of other con
cerns as well, he has used vir
tually all of his major public ap
pearances to repeat this theme
— in a press conference when he
was named the Board of
Trustees' choice for president in
June, in his welcoming ad
dresses to new students in Sep
tember and in his inaugural
speech earlier this month.
Focus sharpened
He has called for "special at
tention to the improvement of
the humanities and to those so
cial sciences that haven't par
ticipated as much in the great
flowering of government sup
port of research over the past 20
years. At Stanford, we want to
be as strong as possible across
the board, (and) I don't think
the strength of (humanities and
the sciences) is quite at parity."
Accordingly, the president
can be expected to push his
cause, to encourage funding for
new professorships (he recently
announced a $1.25 million grant
for endowed positions in the hu
manities) and for projects such
as the recently announced cen
ter for the humanities here, de

tails and the cost of which are
still being finalized. More than a
cosmetic cover to a lack of
depth in the humanities, which
some contend the center will be,
Kennedy has defended the
project as a symbol of Stan
ford's renewed stature in the
field.
Similarly, Kennedy has
called for "no less than the ref
ormation of undergraduate
education at Stanford," and has
sought to strengthen the advis
ing system and to explore
changes in the residential
education program. And he has
formed a cabinet composed of
the deans of the undergraduate
schools and the deans of student
affairs, undergraduate studies,
and admissions as well as the
registrar to discuss this priori
ty.
Already involved
Kennedy himself serves as an
academic advisor to eight
freshmen and he gave the open
ing lectures for the Human
Biology core this year. What
will happen specifically to un
dergraduate studies during his
presidency, as with just about
everything else, remains to be
seen.
Regardless, there has been
something appealing about the
scientist calling for renewed at

tention to the humanities, and
about the researcher arguing so
vigorously for increased atten
tion on teaching and advising.
♦ * ♦
Donald Kennedy was born in
New York City in 1931, and grew
up in Deerfield. Massachusetts.
He was married to Jeanne De
wey in 1953, and he has two chil
dren, one of whom. Julia, is a
junior at Stanford.

He holds three degrees, in
cluding a doctorate, from
Harvard. It is an ironic twist of
fate which has sent him from
that background to the presiden
cy of Stanford at the same time
that a Stanford graduate, Derek
Bok, is serving as president of
Harvard.
His goal upon entering
Harvard in 1948 was hardly a ca
reer in science and public poli
cy: it was in the field of writing,
a calling from which he was ul
timately diverted bv another
ambition: to be a downhill ski
racer He became the number
two skier on Harvard's alpine
team, and he continues pursuit
of the sport as a hobby today.
But he eventually fell into
biology, at which he proved
most successful After receiv
ing his Ph.D. in 1956 and a facul
ty position at Syracuse Univer
sity in New York from 1956 to
1960, he came to Stanford.
He says he reacted strongly to
the University even back then.
"I thought it was an interesting
place in the middle of quite an
extraordinary period of growth
— it had not arrived at the status
of being a first-rate university
although it quite clearly was
going to get there."
Areas for growth
It did, however, have other
ways in which to grow as well:
"The student body was a little
less exciting and effervescent
than I had expected. Somebody
once said that what we should do
with this student body is to take
the top third of the student body
at City College of New York and
mix it in evenly. I think now you
could make the case that some
thing like that has happened na
tionally." Stanford, Kennedy
savs. is succeeding in attracting
both a regional and ethnic mix
ture of students, although he
contends that rising travel costs
will continue to make it difficult
for the University to continue
attracting students from far
away.
Kennedy has. at the same
time, made much so far of what
he thinks sets Stanford apart

from other universities of its
size and stature. "It is impor
tant that this is a Western in
stitution — this place is still a
little more fluid, more in
formal. marked more by fresh
ness and unpretentiousness"
than some of its older rivals in
the East, he says.
Kennedy fared well in the
world of academics, practical
or otherwise, and he rose quick
ly enough to tenure, in 1965, and
became chairman of the Dept.

of Biological Sciences. He
served as chair until 1972
His scientific credentials are
well established: he has written
more than 60 major articles, au
thored a textbook, and done
pioneering research in neu
rological studies, being one of
the first to show that complex
forms of nerve behavior could
be stimulated by study of other,
less complex nerve cells
He was popular with students,

Human Biology
When he returned to Stanford,
his growing interest in the com
bined fields of science and pub
lic policy was to lead him to
found a new program for under
graduates in Human Biology.
Drawing from the departments

of biology, anthropology, medi
cine and the social sciences, the
program was immediately pop
ular with students.
It was also among the first of
the interdisciplinary majors

Stanford Kennedy has lent
strong support to the in
terdisciplinary concept in gen
eral, favoring programs such as
International Relations and
American Studies and to the
specific proposal for the Public
Policy program now before the

The interest in public health
was portentous, for shortly he
would be called from his post of
chairman of Human Biologv

back to Washington, where he
served as commissioner of the
Food and Drug Administration
beginning in January, 1977.
Someone once described the
job as "the modern equivalent
of managing a leper colony."
Responsible for formulating
recommendations affecting the
health of the country's citizens,
Kennedy was pressured from all
sides: by the food and drug in
dustries angry about strict regu
lation. by consumer groups
charging slack enforcement,
and by typical citizens bitter at
having their favorite sweetener

removed from the market. Ken
nedy performed what by almost
all accounts has been con
sidered an admirable job. He
was credited with giving the
agency "new respectability,
new spirit and even new
friends." according to a staff
member of one particularly
critical Senate subcommittee
on health.
Saccharin controversy
Kennedy was in the forefront
of the skirmish over the pro
posed ban on saccharin, an
artificial sweetener, and the
battle over Laetrile, a drug
some claim effective in curing
cancer but for which the FDA
refused certification as "use
less." In the job, Kennedy be
came a target for conservative
and libertarian groups who
blasted the FDA regulations as
interferences with individual
rights.
After resigning the FDA post
in 1979, Kennedy served as prov
ost for exactly a year, taking
over the presidency this Aug. 1.
In the short time during which
he has been president, Ken
nedy's personal style seems to
have been defined mostly bv his
gregariousness and his visibili
ty. "This job is lonely only if you
make it lonely. I've pushed my
self to get out of the office when
I can. and go where people are
doing interesting things or hav
ing fun," the president says, and
adds with a smile, "People
don't usually walk into the pres
ident's door to tell him some
thing great has happened; they
walk in to tell him something
awful is about to happen, or has
happened."
* * *
Above all. Kennedy seems to
want to project the image that
he will not only meet the Univer
sity's problems, but that he will
meet them with confidence.
"I think the 1980s are going to
be a challenging decade: we are
going to have to be ex
traordinarily clever if we are to
succeed in keeping this institu
tion moving forward. I want
people to keep having a sense
that they're more, enthusiastic
about the place than the year
before, that things are getting
better. We're going to have to be
very ambitious and all believe
in a lot of the same things to
gether. I want to get other peo
ple to share a vision of where
this institution is going."
Despite the relaxed style, the
president maintains a busy

schedule. Up, by his own ac
count, at 6 every morning, he
says proudly that he runs to the
Dish "damn near" every morn
ing, then returns home for
breakfast with his wife. He's in
the office, again by his own ac
count. "well before 8" while his
wife heads off to her job as di
rector of community relations
at the Stanford Hospital.
"I get a large share of my in
formation from people, in meet
ing situations," says Kennedy
and to that end he says a typical
day is scheduled for at least six
hours of meetings, including a
working lunch. In the late after
noon, the president handles a
large volume of correspon
dence. Many of the Kennedy
evenings are spent out on Uni

versity business although the
president says that he tries to
get three nights at home with hi
wife during a week. Then, on a
schedule which might make
those tired of rowdy dorm life
envious, Kennedy says he tries
to get to bed by 10 o'clock.
Pragmatism
And he says that he is trying
to keep his outsivie commit
ments as low as possible.
Further, he says he will be "sur
prised." at least in the begin
ning. if he is away from the cam
pus more than four working
days a month.
He seems to view his job. no:
with detachment, but with a
certain amount of pragmatism
"I am just aware that the presi
dent of the Universitv is a man

who has to say no a lot of the
time, as much as one hopes to
say yes frequently. I am pre
pared to accept that as a cost of
doing business."
He is man known at once for
his friendliness and his frequent
aversion to diplomatic niceties
In Washington, he was known to
dispense with political etiquette
and, at times, to criticize some
of his fellow federal depart
ments. "Hedoes not suffer fools
gladly." said a former aide of
Kennedy's. Still, he was also
praised for treating his aides as
equals and for being meticulous
ly accurate and knowledgable in
testimony before Congress. He
appears to be as quick a study in
his post here.
Kennedv has stressed other

priorities again, what progress
will be made remains to be seen
He has been a strong supporter
of affirmative action programs
for minorities and for women,
especially at the faculty level:
"When 1 learned that we had
made 72 or so outside appoint
ments at the tenured level over
the past three years and only
two of these were to women. I
felt that was a dismal record I
was also particularly concerned
with the number of Chicano fac
ulty Affirmative action is going
to mean getting some institu
tion-wide mechanism made for
making departments conscious
of and taking advantage of par
ticular needs and op -
portunities."


At work on the computer system the administration hopes will even tually replace telephones for interoffice communication.
He has formed at least three
task forces to study the position
of minorities in the faculty,
staff and student body.
Kennedy has also targeted the
high cost of faculty housing, and
the resultant problem of faculty
recruiting, as another major
area of concern. He has sup
ported the University's coin
vestment program, and says he
may call for an extension of the
$3 million program. And he con
tends that if Stanford can estab
lish itself as a major center for
dialogue in the humanities, it
will be easier to attract high
quality faculty to the area.
Real attributes
Kennedy has, traditionally,
been quick to point out that for
all the University is, there is
much it isn't. More than 10
years ago, he asked incoming
students. "Casting aside its im
ages, what are the real at
tributes of the university? What
does it really do? What should it
do?
"First, it is a part of our
academic tradition that society
vests in the university responsi
bility for exploration and dis
covery as well as for teaching.
"Second, the university is not
an intellectual service station.
No educational institution can
or should be all things to all
men It cannot produce by the
same machinery or set of
priniciples poets, dental techni
cians. atomic physicists, ad
dressograph operators, states
men and poultry hus
banders. . . The Univeristy
makes an odd compact with so
ciety. At the same time that it
asks for patronage, it asks for
freedom to define its own role."
A decade later, he contends in
the same vein that "no univer
sity is the real world, and it
shouldn't be. We are not a repre
sentative. a microcosmof socie
ty."

'We deliberately
leave out things
which are present in
the real world, to
have a vision of what
things might be like,
not what they are.'

In fact, Kennedy says, "we
deliberately leave out things
which are present in the real
world, to have a vision of what
things might be like, not what
they are."
Stanford University thus l 1
today as its leader a man witi .
curious mixture of views — a
concern for the practical with a
flair for the philosophical, a
sense of pride in the past with
eyes on the future, high expecta
tions with the knowledge that,
often, it is the president who
must ultimately say no.
If Donald Kennedy is scared
or bewildered by the post he
holds today, he certainly does
not show it. He talks in bold
terms of the mission of the Uni
versity. the pursuit of "things of
compelling importance, endur
ing value, superb quality."
What seems to have defined the
first few months of a Kennedy
presidency is not just his pro
fession of these ideals; more, it
his own apparent faith that he is
equipped to lead such a pursuit.
More than anything. Presi
dent Kennedy says, he wants to
be "an agent of consensus. I've
been able to do that elsewhere,
and it is my greatest hope that I
will be able to do it here."
