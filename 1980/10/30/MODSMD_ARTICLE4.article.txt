# A
						president's vision: 'what things might be'
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Donald Kennedy hardly looks
like a radical. His manner is re
laxed, his voice is calm, and he
smiles a lot of the time. Yet
even as he settles into a new job,
that of president of the Univer
sity, there is a sense across the
campus that his presidency is
ushering in an era of great
change and of renewed expecta
tion.
Kennedy himself seems to en
joy the images. "I want to be a
cultivator of enthusiasm and a
good agent of consensus," he
says, but he also makes it clear
that he wants much to do with
the formulation of that con
sensus. He speaks in broad
terms of "programs of growth"
and "programs of change,"
stressing the need for both, but
adds that "my own personal
qualities are even more essen
tial for programs of change.
"There is a sense in which we
as an institution are all right,
with a good balance among our
parts, and that all we would
need to do is to keep our annual
giving going, our total gifts
going up, and (increasing num
bers) applying to be admitted.
That's the agenda which every
president has, and to it he brings
whatever enthusiasm, guile and
armtwisting ability he has.

"But then there are other
things which the president
needs to do to change the shape
of the University. We need now
not just to grow, but to change
the relationship of our parts,"
he said.
Goals targeted
The thing which many have
found exciting about Kennedy's
presidency so far is that he has
not only appeared ready to do
the job. he has also been
articulate at explaining just
what his own special agenda
here will be.
Above all, Donald Kennedy
seems to have targeted for
himself two major goals: the
reformation of undergraduate
education and a reemphasis on
the humanities. These themes,
at least from Kennedy, are not
new — he mentioned these as
priorities even as he was leav
ing Washington and his post as
commissioner of the Food and
Drug Administration to return
to Stanford as vice president
and provost in August 1979.
Since then, while he brings
with him a number of other con
cerns as well, he has used vir
tually all of his major public ap
pearances to repeat this theme
— in a press conference when he
was named the Board of
Trustees' choice for president in
June, in his welcoming ad
dresses to new students in Sep
tember and in his inaugural
speech earlier this month.
Focus sharpened
He has called for "special at
tention to the improvement of
the humanities and to those so
cial sciences that haven't par
ticipated as much in the great
flowering of government sup
port of research over the past 20
years. At Stanford, we want to
be as strong as possible across
the board, (and) I don't think
the strength of (humanities and
the sciences) is quite at parity."
Accordingly, the president
can be expected to push his
cause, to encourage funding for
new professorships (he recently
announced a $1.25 million grant
for endowed positions in the hu
manities) and for projects such
as the recently announced cen
ter for the humanities here, de

tails and the cost of which are
still being finalized. More than a
cosmetic cover to a lack of
depth in the humanities, which
some contend the center will be,
Kennedy has defended the
project as a symbol of Stan
ford's renewed stature in the
field.
Similarly, Kennedy has
called for "no less than the ref
ormation of undergraduate
education at Stanford," and has
sought to strengthen the advis
ing system and to explore
changes in the residential
education program. And he has
formed a cabinet composed of
the deans of the undergraduate
schools and the deans of student
affairs, undergraduate studies,
and admissions as well as the
registrar to discuss this priori
ty.
Already involved
Kennedy himself serves as an
academic advisor to eight
freshmen and he gave the open
ing lectures for the Human
Biology core this year. What
will happen specifically to un
dergraduate studies during his
presidency, as with just about
everything else, remains to be
seen.
Regardless, there has been
something appealing about the
scientist calling for renewed at

tention to the humanities, and
about the researcher arguing so
vigorously for increased atten
tion on teaching and advising.
♦ * ♦
Donald Kennedy was born in
New York City in 1931, and grew
up in Deerfield. Massachusetts.
He was married to Jeanne De
wey in 1953, and he has two chil
dren, one of whom. Julia, is a
junior at Stanford.

He holds three degrees, in
cluding a doctorate, from
Harvard. It is an ironic twist of
fate which has sent him from
that background to the presiden
cy of Stanford at the same time
that a Stanford graduate, Derek
Bok, is serving as president of
Harvard.
His goal upon entering
Harvard in 1948 was hardly a ca
reer in science and public poli
cy: it was in the field of writing,
a calling from which he was ul
timately diverted bv another
ambition: to be a downhill ski
racer He became the number
two skier on Harvard's alpine
team, and he continues pursuit
of the sport as a hobby today.
But he eventually fell into
biology, at which he proved
most successful After receiv
ing his Ph.D. in 1956 and a facul
ty position at Syracuse Univer
sity in New York from 1956 to
1960, he came to Stanford.
He says he reacted strongly to
the University even back then.
"I thought it was an interesting
place in the middle of quite an
extraordinary period of growth
— it had not arrived at the status
of being a first-rate university
although it quite clearly was
going to get there."
Areas for growth
It did, however, have other
ways in which to grow as well:
"The student body was a little
less exciting and effervescent
than I had expected. Somebody
once said that what we should do
with this student body is to take
the top third of the student body
at City College of New York and
mix it in evenly. I think now you
could make the case that some
thing like that has happened na
tionally." Stanford, Kennedy
savs. is succeeding in attracting
both a regional and ethnic mix
ture of students, although he
contends that rising travel costs
will continue to make it difficult
for the University to continue
attracting students from far
away.
Kennedy has. at the same
time, made much so far of what
he thinks sets Stanford apart

from other universities of its
size and stature. "It is impor
tant that this is a Western in
stitution — this place is still a
little more fluid, more in
formal. marked more by fresh
ness and unpretentiousness"
than some of its older rivals in
the East, he says.
Kennedy fared well in the
world of academics, practical
or otherwise, and he rose quick
ly enough to tenure, in 1965, and
became chairman of the Dept.

of Biological Sciences. He
served as chair until 1972
His scientific credentials are
well established: he has written
more than 60 major articles, au
thored a textbook, and done
pioneering research in neu
rological studies, being one of
the first to show that complex
forms of nerve behavior could
be stimulated by study of other,
less complex nerve cells
He was popular with students,

Kennedy is a familiar face around campus, seen here walking
through White Plaza. He said he believes professors and the adminis
tration have to relate more to the student population here.
