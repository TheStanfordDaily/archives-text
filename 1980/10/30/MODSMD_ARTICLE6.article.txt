# Teaching as important as research
## Tenure procedures seek quality profs 
### Victor Goetz 
Three years have passed
since an ASSU Task Force com
pleted a study of tenure and
teaching evaluation here as part
of a student push for more input
into University personnel de
cisions.
Today, according to acting
Provost Albert Hastorf, eval
uation of teaching is just as
much a part of the rigorous
tenure promotion procedure as
evaluation of research.
"A great deal of time is spent
reviewing evidence for the part
that teaching plays. But it is ex
ceedingly difficult to evaluate
— far more difficult than eval
uating a person's expertise

News analysis

within their discipline," said
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of
the Advisory Board to the
Academic Council, the group
which conducts the final
analysis of all appointments and
promotions
"I don't think it's that the
University doesn't pay enough
attention to teaching, it's that
ths area is so difficult to eval
uate," he said.
Teaching and research are
the two major aspects of a can
didate's achievement that are
weighed through an elaborate
procedure which begins at the
department level and ends
either with rejection (at any
stage subject to appeal) or ap
proval of the Board of Trustees
The process
Typically assistant pro
fessors will be entering their
sixth year at the University
when their department chair
man will recommend to the
dean of the particular school
that tenure be considered.
The office of the provost coor
dinates the entire process, be
ginning with the forwarding to
the department of a standard
form that constitutes the core of
a candidate file which then
grows rapidly.
If a vote of the department
faculty is favorable, the chair
man will form a committee to
gather evidence of the can
didate's excellence. This in
cludes publications by the can
didate. a nationwide peer eval
uation comparing the candidate
to the finest in the field, letters
from colleagues and former stu
dents and student course eval
uations, to mention a few ele
ments.
Once compiled, the evidence
is forwarded to the respective
dean for consideration with the
advice of the school's Appoint
ments and Promotions Commit
tee. This group may return the
file to the department for more
evidence or pass it on to the
provost for similar considera
tion.
Options
The provost and his staff once
again have the option of request
ing more documentation or
passing it on to the Advisory
Board, which also may send it
back down the line for more sup
port or may send it on to the
president and Board of Trustees
for final approval.
At each level, if the process is
stopped the candidate may ap
peal to the next higher step, ac
cording to Hastorf. "If the prov
ost says no, you're not just
saying no to a candidate, you're
saying no to a whole big part of
the system."
"The deans were extremely
generous with their time and
their willingness to reconsider
the case." said recently tenured
Music Prof. William Mahrt,
who was initially denied tenure.
"I had the notion once the

thing had been turned down that
I shouldn't worry about it, that I
should just go find another job. I
thought there was probably not
much chance that they would
change their minds. But when it
evolved that people in the de
partment wanted them to re
consider, they offered to do it if
there was substantial new in
formation." he said.
Teaching important
Mahrt offered himself as a
case in point that research is not
necessarily everything in the
tenure decision. "I was granted
tenure without a substantial list
of publications," he said. "My
case for tenure was much
stronger on the teaching side
than research."
A candidate is expected to be
excellent in one and good in the
other, said Hastorf about the
controversial balance between
teaching and research.
"If you can see that a guy is
going to be a great teacher, you
don't want to leave the research
column empty because he can
certainly become a deadhead
later. Research shows that you
are intellectually alive," he
said.
Many considerations
"It may be a fact that quality
research is a condition for good
teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new
president, who is very con
cerned with teaching quality,
we are not in quite as grave a
state as we were before, when
research was everything," said
Larson.
"Being a good teacher is not
solely a factor of being a show
person," he said. "It exhibits
time and organization, caring
for students. Teaching and re
search are essentially at odds
with each other because it takes
time to be a good teacher, but it
takes time away from re
search."
The pressure on junior facul
ty to do extensive research as a
basis forpromotion to tenure,
the "publish or perish" maxim,
has long been a controversial
subject.

Tenure is one of the points at
which pressures from all sides
come together, said English De
partment Chairman George
Dekker. The candidate is look
ing for some assurance of his
future, and the University is
seeking to remain the best and
to keep a steady flow of young
blood coming in.he said.
"Publish or perish" seems to
indicate 'grind it out,' but it re
ally means 'think it out.' It's
much better to publish four
smashingly good experiments
than 22 satisfactory ones," said
Hastorf.
"Clearly, pressure is
nerveracking for some young
people, and not so for others,"
he said. "My first reaction to
getting tenure was to work my
butt off to prove that I deserved
it."
On the other hand, Mahrt
pointed out that some people
who get tenure feel that they no
longer have to work as hard.
Chase expressed concern
about the growing perception of

tenure as job security rather
than a guarantee of academic
freedom as the institution was
first intended.
Used as excuse
Chase acknowledged that
pressure to spend time on re
search often prevents junior
faculty from becoming as deep
ly involved in such services as
advising, but he also noted that
it is often claimed as an excuse
not to get involved
Teaching and academic ad
vising haven't been sufficiently
rewarded, said Larson. There is
subtle pressure to concentrate
on research, he said.
Tenure sets a goal to work
toward, according to Chase.
"It is a stimulus for individ
uals to make sure their own
productivity has reached the
point where a review by their
own peers puts them on a na
tional stature. It's much the
same as graduation for a stu
dent. You have to achieve cer
tain levels of performance along
the line." he said
Not automatic
At the same time, it is not
pure and simple that once hav
ing achieved national status, the
person is going to get tenure, he
added.
"I don't have a thought about
how we can make the pressure
go away. But I can be damn sure
they'll get a fair evaluation."
said Hastorf, adding that to
day's tight job market means
even more pressure "Some are
stimulated by pressure, others
choke. There is a nice study to
be done on foul shooting in the
NBA," said the psycholgist.
"Some seem to always sink the
game-winner, others always
miss."
At the same time, said
Hastorf, especially promising
young faculty can put some
pressure of their own on the Uni
versity. The promotion process
may be invoked before the cus
tomary six-year probation peri
od is up if a department chair
man is afraid of losing an espe
cially good person to some other
top college But such cases are
relatively rare.
More time?
In fact, a good deal of dis
cussion has centered on a longer
probationary period to give can
didates more time to become es

manist does is not likely to be
before they are in their 40s."
Dekker admits, however, that
a longer probationary period
poses new problems. "There
would be obvious problems in a
system which prolonged in
security further. There would
have to be some way of com
pensating (junior faculty) for
the extended uncertainty."
Opportunities limited
Acting Chairman of the Clas
sics Department Mark Edwards
said that today, if a person is not
promoted, it can be difficult for
them to continue in the field.
"If the person won't be kept
on, in a way. the earlier the de
cision is made the better." he
said.
"One thing about the six-year
tenure rule is that it does force
the institution to organize itself
to make a tough decision," said
Hastorf.
In the final analysis, the en
tire concept of tenure is the is
sue. It has stirred controversy
in academe as long as it has ex
isted.
Dekker, who taught for a time
in England, offered the alter-

'Stanford doesn \ want to be just good,
it wants to be in the top three
. . . Stanford can t afford to make a mistake'

tablished in their fields.
"I think in my own view that
the six-year tenure decision
time in the humanities is a little
unreal and doesn't promote the
best work," said Van Harvey.
Religious Studies Department
chairman.
"I would like to see contracts
made for a longer period. Per
haps a second appointment of
nine or 10 years (rather than the
current three-year reappoint
ment) would be a much fairer
test," he said. "The timing puts
a tremendous premium on vis
ibility, and I happen to think
within the humanities that's
very hard to get in five to six
years."
Too little time
Harvey noted that the time
factor forced people to write
hurriedly and possibly not as
well as they might be capable
"It's true that you can't tell
who the outstanding scholars in
the humanities are going to be
until much later," said Dekker
"And it does bedevil our de
cisions. The best work that a hu

native procedure in use there —
an exhaustive initial search for
a person the University expects
to keep, with tenure nearly auto
matic According to Dekker the
probation period is only three
years and the candidate is not
expected to achieve a great deal
in the way of research by that
time.
Instead, there is a career
grade after 12 years with pro
motion to the next step not as
easy. "That's where the incen
tive comes in. because you had
to have done something I think
it's a more humane system with
less pressure built into it."he
said.
'Realistic prospects'
On the other hand. "Stanford
is a place where realistic pros
pects of tenure do exist," said
Dekker "And in that respect
it's a better place to get an in
itial appointment than Harvard.
Yale or Princeton where assis
tant professorships tend to be
transitory I think we get better
assistant professors than
Harvard or Yale because we do

offer a reasonable chance of
tenure."
"We work hard at making it
possible for people to gain
tenure by preparing the road
with the initial appointment.
This isn't true at many schools
in the country where young peo
ple appointed to assistant pro
fessorships are put in the bad
situation where they do not have
time to produce what they are
capable of."
The problem with tenure is
that once a University is no
longer growing at a rapid rate it
is very difficult to avoid having
an "old" faculty, said newly
tenured Computer Science Prof
.Joseph Oliger. who admits that
he is becoming more convinced
of the virtues of the system
Incentives needed
"Too bad that there's not
more incentive like there is in
industry, where you have a job
as long as you're doing it well
and someone still wants the
work done." he said
"The University has to make
a total judgment of the person."
said Mahrt If it's going to give a
person 30 years of the kind of
freedom tenure implies, the
University does have a right to
look him over very carefully."
The care with which Stanford
handles the procedure im
pressed Harvey, who previously
has served as chairman of re
ligious studies at the the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania where, he
said, there was no set pro
cedure.
"Ry the time a file has gotten
to the dean it contains a very im
pressive mass of evidence The
dean and his committee should
have a fairly good case one way
or the other." he said
The clear aim of the pro
cedure. according to Hastorf. is
to develop the best possible fac
ulty
"Tenured faculty are in
terested in maintaining and
building a strong department,
even though it might involve
people that they do not like per
sonally." said Dekker.
The rigor of the procedure
makes it difficult for personal
judgments to take a role "It
would be awfully hard for some
one to make a political case out
side the evidence if 10 of the best
people in the country say the
candidate is one of the best,"
said Harvey.
"Stanford doesn't want to be
just good." said Harvey, "it
wants to be in the top three i col
leges in the country) Stanford
can't afford to make a mis
take."

teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new
president, who is very con
cerned with teaching quality,
we are not in quite as grave a
state as we were before, when
research was everything," said
Larson.
"Being a good teacher is not
solely a factor of being a show
person," he said. "It exhibits
time and organization, caring
for students. Teaching and re
search are essentially at odds
with each other because it takes
time to be a good teacher, but it
takes time away from re
search."
The pressure on junior facul
ty to do extensive research as a
basis forpromotion to tenure,
the "publish or perish" maxim,
has long been a controversial
subject.

Tenure is one of the points at
which pressures from all sides
come together, said English De
partment Chairman George
Dekker. The candidate is look
ing for some assurance of his
future, and the University is
seeking to remain the best and
to keep a steady flow of young
blood coming in.he said.
"Publish or perish" seems to
indicate 'grind it out,' but it re
ally means 'think it out.' It's
much better to publish four
smashingly good experiments
than 22 satisfactory ones," said
Hastorf.
"Clearly, pressure is
nerveracking for some young
people, and not so for others,"
he said. "My first reaction to
getting tenure was to work my
butt off to prove that I deserved
it."
On the other hand, Mahrt
pointed out that some people
who get tenure feel that they no
longer have to work as hard.
Chase expressed concern
about the growing perception of

tenure as job security rather
than a guarantee of academic
freedom as the institution was
first intended.
Used as excuse
Chase acknowledged that
pressure to spend time on re
search often prevents junior
faculty from becoming as deep
ly involved in such services as
advising, but he also noted that
it is often claimed as an excuse
not to get involved
Teaching and academic ad
vising haven't been sufficiently
rewarded, said Larson. There is
subtle pressure to concentrate
on research, he said.
Tenure sets a goal to work
toward, according to Chase.
"It is a stimulus for individ
uals to make sure their own
productivity has reached the
point where a review by their
own peers puts them on a na
tional stature. It's much the
same as graduation for a stu
dent. You have to achieve cer
tain levels of performance along
the line." he said
Not automatic
At the same time, it is not
pure and simple that once hav
ing achieved national status, the
person is going to get tenure, he
added.
"I don't have a thought about
how we can make the pressure
go away. But I can be damn sure
they'll get a fair evaluation."
said Hastorf, adding that to
day's tight job market means
even more pressure "Some are
stimulated by pressure, others
choke. There is a nice study to
be done on foul shooting in the
NBA," said the psycholgist.
"Some seem to always sink the
game-winner, others always
miss."
At the same time, said
Hastorf, especially promising
young faculty can put some
pressure of their own on the Uni
versity. The promotion process
may be invoked before the cus
tomary six-year probation peri
od is up if a department chair
man is afraid of losing an espe
cially good person to some other
top college But such cases are
relatively rare.
More time?
In fact, a good deal of dis
cussion has centered on a longer
probationary period to give can
didates more time to become es

manist does is not likely to be
before they are in their 40s."
Dekker admits, however, that
a longer probationary period
poses new problems. "There
would be obvious problems in a
system which prolonged in
security further. There would
have to be some way of com
pensating (junior faculty) for
the extended uncertainty."
Opportunities limited
Acting Chairman of the Clas
sics Department Mark Edwards
said that today, if a person is not
promoted, it can be difficult for
them to continue in the field.
"If the person won't be kept
on, in a way. the earlier the de
cision is made the better." he
said.
"One thing about the six-year
tenure rule is that it does force
the institution to organize itself
to make a tough decision," said
Hastorf.
In the final analysis, the en
tire concept of tenure is the is
sue. It has stirred controversy
in academe as long as it has ex
isted.
Dekker, who taught for a time
in England, offered the alter-

'Stanford doesn \ want to be just good,
it wants to be in the top three
. . . Stanford can t afford to make a mistake'

tablished in their fields.
"I think in my own view that
the six-year tenure decision
time in the humanities is a little
unreal and doesn't promote the
best work," said Van Harvey.
Religious Studies Department
chairman.
"I would like to see contracts
made for a longer period. Per
haps a second appointment of
nine or 10 years (rather than the
current three-year reappoint
ment) would be a much fairer
test," he said. "The timing puts
a tremendous premium on vis
ibility, and I happen to think
within the humanities that's
very hard to get in five to six
years."
Too little time
Harvey noted that the time
factor forced people to write
hurriedly and possibly not as
well as they might be capable
"It's true that you can't tell
who the outstanding scholars in
the humanities are going to be
until much later," said Dekker
"And it does bedevil our de
cisions. The best work that a hu

native procedure in use there —
an exhaustive initial search for
a person the University expects
to keep, with tenure nearly auto
matic According to Dekker the
probation period is only three
years and the candidate is not
expected to achieve a great deal
in the way of research by that
time.
Instead, there is a career
grade after 12 years with pro
motion to the next step not as
easy. "That's where the incen
tive comes in. because you had
to have done something I think
it's a more humane system with
less pressure built into it."he
said.
'Realistic prospects'
On the other hand. "Stanford
is a place where realistic pros
pects of tenure do exist," said
Dekker "And in that respect
it's a better place to get an in
itial appointment than Harvard.
Yale or Princeton where assis
tant professorships tend to be
transitory I think we get better
assistant professors than
Harvard or Yale because we do

offer a reasonable chance of
tenure."
"We work hard at making it
possible for people to gain
tenure by preparing the road
with the initial appointment.
This isn't true at many schools
in the country where young peo
ple appointed to assistant pro
fessorships are put in the bad
situation where they do not have
time to produce what they are
capable of."
The problem with tenure is
that once a University is no
longer growing at a rapid rate it
is very difficult to avoid having
an "old" faculty, said newly
tenured Computer Science Prof
.Joseph Oliger. who admits that
he is becoming more convinced
of the virtues of the system
Incentives needed
"Too bad that there's not
more incentive like there is in
industry, where you have a job
as long as you're doing it well
and someone still wants the
work done." he said
"The University has to make
a total judgment of the person."
said Mahrt If it's going to give a
person 30 years of the kind of
freedom tenure implies, the
University does have a right to
look him over very carefully."
The care with which Stanford
handles the procedure im
pressed Harvey, who previously
has served as chairman of re
ligious studies at the the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania where, he
said, there was no set pro
cedure.
"Ry the time a file has gotten
to the dean it contains a very im
pressive mass of evidence The
dean and his committee should
have a fairly good case one way
or the other." he said
The clear aim of the pro
cedure. according to Hastorf. is
to develop the best possible fac
ulty
"Tenured faculty are in
terested in maintaining and
building a strong department,
even though it might involve
people that they do not like per
sonally." said Dekker.
The rigor of the procedure
makes it difficult for personal
judgments to take a role "It
would be awfully hard for some
one to make a political case out
side the evidence if 10 of the best
people in the country say the
candidate is one of the best,"
said Harvey.
"Stanford doesn't want to be
just good." said Harvey, "it
wants to be in the top three i col
leges in the country) Stanford
can't afford to make a mis
take."


Albert Hastorf
Three years have passed
since an ASSU Task Force com
pleted a study of tenure and
teaching evaluation here as part
of a student push for more input
into University personnel de
cisions.
Today, according to acting
Provost Albert Hastorf, eval
uation of teaching is just as
much a part of the rigorous
tenure promotion procedure as
evaluation of research.
"A great deal of time is spent
reviewing evidence for the part
that teaching plays. But it is ex
ceedingly difficult to evaluate
— far more difficult than eval
uating a person's expertise

News analysis

within their discipline," said
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of
the Advisory Board to the
Academic Council, the group
which conducts the final
analysis of all appointments and
promotions
"I don't think it's that the
University doesn't pay enough
attention to teaching, it's that
ths area is so difficult to eval
uate," he said.
Teaching and research are
the two major aspects of a can
didate's achievement that are
weighed through an elaborate
procedure which begins at the
department level and ends
either with rejection (at any
stage subject to appeal) or ap
proval of the Board of Trustees
The process
Typically assistant pro
fessors will be entering their
sixth year at the University
when their department chair
man will recommend to the
dean of the particular school
that tenure be considered.
The office of the provost coor
dinates the entire process, be
ginning with the forwarding to
the department of a standard
form that constitutes the core of
a candidate file which then
grows rapidly.
If a vote of the department
faculty is favorable, the chair
man will form a committee to
gather evidence of the can
didate's excellence. This in
cludes publications by the can
didate. a nationwide peer eval
uation comparing the candidate
to the finest in the field, letters
from colleagues and former stu
dents and student course eval
uations, to mention a few ele
ments.
Once compiled, the evidence
is forwarded to the respective
dean for consideration with the
advice of the school's Appoint
ments and Promotions Commit
tee. This group may return the
file to the department for more
evidence or pass it on to the
provost for similar considera
tion.
Options
The provost and his staff once
again have the option of request
ing more documentation or
passing it on to the Advisory
Board, which also may send it
back down the line for more sup
port or may send it on to the
president and Board of Trustees
for final approval.
At each level, if the process is
stopped the candidate may ap
peal to the next higher step, ac
cording to Hastorf. "If the prov
ost says no, you're not just
saying no to a candidate, you're
saying no to a whole big part of
the system."
"The deans were extremely
generous with their time and
their willingness to reconsider
the case." said recently tenured
Music Prof. William Mahrt,
who was initially denied tenure.
"I had the notion once the

thing had been turned down that
I shouldn't worry about it, that I
should just go find another job. I
thought there was probably not
much chance that they would
change their minds. But when it
evolved that people in the de
partment wanted them to re
consider, they offered to do it if
there was substantial new in
formation." he said.
Teaching important
Mahrt offered himself as a
case in point that research is not
necessarily everything in the
tenure decision. "I was granted
tenure without a substantial list
of publications," he said. "My
case for tenure was much
stronger on the teaching side
than research."
A candidate is expected to be
excellent in one and good in the
other, said Hastorf about the
controversial balance between
teaching and research.
"If you can see that a guy is
going to be a great teacher, you
don't want to leave the research
column empty because he can
certainly become a deadhead
later. Research shows that you
are intellectually alive," he
said.
Many considerations
"It may be a fact that quality
research is a condition for good
teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new

Opportunities limited
Acting Chairman of the Clas
sics Department Mark Edwards
said that today, if a person is not
promoted, it can be difficult for
them to continue in the field.
"If the person won't be kept
on, in a way. the earlier the de
cision is made the better." he
said.
"One thing about the six-year
tenure rule is that it does force
the institution to organize itself
to make a tough decision," said
Hastorf.
In the final analysis, the en
tire concept of tenure is the is
sue. It has stirred controversy
in academe as long as it has ex
isted.
Dekker, who taught for a time
in England, offered the alter-

tablished in their fields.
"I think in my own view that
the six-year tenure decision
time in the humanities is a little
unreal and doesn't promote the
best work," said Van Harvey.
Religious Studies Department
chairman.
"I would like to see contracts
made for a longer period. Per
haps a second appointment of
nine or 10 years (rather than the
current three-year reappoint
ment) would be a much fairer
test," he said. "The timing puts
a tremendous premium on vis
ibility, and I happen to think
within the humanities that's
very hard to get in five to six
years."
Too little time
Harvey noted that the time
factor forced people to write
hurriedly and possibly not as
well as they might be capable
"It's true that you can't tell
who the outstanding scholars in
the humanities are going to be
until much later," said Dekker
"And it does bedevil our de
cisions. The best work that a hu

native procedure in use there —
an exhaustive initial search for
a person the University expects
to keep, with tenure nearly auto
matic According to Dekker the
probation period is only three
years and the candidate is not
expected to achieve a great deal
in the way of research by that
time.
Instead, there is a career
grade after 12 years with pro
motion to the next step not as
easy. "That's where the incen
tive comes in. because you had
to have done something I think
it's a more humane system with
less pressure built into it."he
said.
'Realistic prospects'
On the other hand. "Stanford
is a place where realistic pros
pects of tenure do exist," said
Dekker "And in that respect
it's a better place to get an in
itial appointment than Harvard.
Yale or Princeton where assis
tant professorships tend to be
transitory I think we get better
assistant professors than
Harvard or Yale because we do

offer a reasonable chance of
tenure."
"We work hard at making it
possible for people to gain
tenure by preparing the road
with the initial appointment.
This isn't true at many schools
in the country where young peo
ple appointed to assistant pro
fessorships are put in the bad
situation where they do not have
time to produce what they are
capable of."
The problem with tenure is
that once a University is no
longer growing at a rapid rate it
is very difficult to avoid having
an "old" faculty, said newly
tenured Computer Science Prof
.Joseph Oliger. who admits that
he is becoming more convinced
of the virtues of the system
Incentives needed
"Too bad that there's not
more incentive like there is in
industry, where you have a job
as long as you're doing it well
and someone still wants the
work done." he said
"The University has to make
a total judgment of the person."
said Mahrt If it's going to give a
person 30 years of the kind of
freedom tenure implies, the
University does have a right to
look him over very carefully."
The care with which Stanford
handles the procedure im
pressed Harvey, who previously
has served as chairman of re
ligious studies at the the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania where, he
said, there was no set pro
cedure.
"Ry the time a file has gotten
to the dean it contains a very im
pressive mass of evidence The
dean and his committee should
have a fairly good case one way
or the other." he said
The clear aim of the pro
cedure. according to Hastorf. is
to develop the best possible fac
ulty
"Tenured faculty are in
terested in maintaining and
building a strong department,
even though it might involve
people that they do not like per
sonally." said Dekker.
The rigor of the procedure
makes it difficult for personal
judgments to take a role "It
would be awfully hard for some
one to make a political case out
side the evidence if 10 of the best
people in the country say the
candidate is one of the best,"
said Harvey.
"Stanford doesn't want to be
just good." said Harvey, "it
wants to be in the top three i col
leges in the country) Stanford
can't afford to make a mis
take."


Albert Hastorf
Three years have passed
since an ASSU Task Force com
pleted a study of tenure and
teaching evaluation here as part
of a student push for more input
into University personnel de
cisions.
Today, according to acting
Provost Albert Hastorf, eval
uation of teaching is just as
much a part of the rigorous
tenure promotion procedure as
evaluation of research.
"A great deal of time is spent
reviewing evidence for the part
that teaching plays. But it is ex
ceedingly difficult to evaluate
— far more difficult than eval
uating a person's expertise

News analysis

within their discipline," said
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of
the Advisory Board to the
Academic Council, the group
which conducts the final
analysis of all appointments and
promotions
"I don't think it's that the
University doesn't pay enough
attention to teaching, it's that
ths area is so difficult to eval
uate," he said.
Teaching and research are
the two major aspects of a can
didate's achievement that are
weighed through an elaborate
procedure which begins at the
department level and ends
either with rejection (at any
stage subject to appeal) or ap
proval of the Board of Trustees
The process
Typically assistant pro
fessors will be entering their
sixth year at the University
when their department chair
man will recommend to the
dean of the particular school
that tenure be considered.
The office of the provost coor
dinates the entire process, be
ginning with the forwarding to
the department of a standard
form that constitutes the core of
a candidate file which then
grows rapidly.
If a vote of the department
faculty is favorable, the chair
man will form a committee to
gather evidence of the can
didate's excellence. This in
cludes publications by the can
didate. a nationwide peer eval
uation comparing the candidate
to the finest in the field, letters
from colleagues and former stu
dents and student course eval
uations, to mention a few ele
ments.
Once compiled, the evidence
is forwarded to the respective
dean for consideration with the
advice of the school's Appoint
ments and Promotions Commit
tee. This group may return the
file to the department for more
evidence or pass it on to the
provost for similar considera
tion.
Options
The provost and his staff once
again have the option of request
ing more documentation or
passing it on to the Advisory
Board, which also may send it
back down the line for more sup
port or may send it on to the
president and Board of Trustees
for final approval.
At each level, if the process is
stopped the candidate may ap
peal to the next higher step, ac
cording to Hastorf. "If the prov
ost says no, you're not just
saying no to a candidate, you're
saying no to a whole big part of
the system."
"The deans were extremely
generous with their time and
their willingness to reconsider
the case." said recently tenured
Music Prof. William Mahrt,
who was initially denied tenure.
"I had the notion once the

thing had been turned down that
I shouldn't worry about it, that I
should just go find another job. I
thought there was probably not
much chance that they would
change their minds. But when it
evolved that people in the de
partment wanted them to re
consider, they offered to do it if
there was substantial new in
formation." he said.
Teaching important
Mahrt offered himself as a
case in point that research is not
necessarily everything in the
tenure decision. "I was granted
tenure without a substantial list
of publications," he said. "My
case for tenure was much
stronger on the teaching side
than research."
A candidate is expected to be
excellent in one and good in the
other, said Hastorf about the
controversial balance between
teaching and research.
"If you can see that a guy is
going to be a great teacher, you
don't want to leave the research
column empty because he can
certainly become a deadhead
later. Research shows that you
are intellectually alive," he
said.
Many considerations
"It may be a fact that quality
research is a condition for good
teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new
president, who is very con
cerned with teaching quality,
we are not in quite as grave a
state as we were before, when
research was everything," said
Larson.
"Being a good teacher is not
solely a factor of being a show
person," he said. "It exhibits
time and organization, caring
for students. Teaching and re
search are essentially at odds
with each other because it takes
time to be a good teacher, but it
takes time away from re
search."
The pressure on junior facul
ty to do extensive research as a
basis forpromotion to tenure,
the "publish or perish" maxim,
has long been a controversial
subject.

Tenure is one of the points at
which pressures from all sides
come together, said English De
partment Chairman George
Dekker. The candidate is look
ing for some assurance of his
future, and the University is
seeking to remain the best and
to keep a steady flow of young
blood coming in.he said.
"Publish or perish" seems to
indicate 'grind it out,' but it re
ally means 'think it out.' It's
much better to publish four
smashingly good experiments
than 22 satisfactory ones," said
Hastorf.
"Clearly, pressure is
nerveracking for some young
people, and not so for others,"
he said. "My first reaction to
getting tenure was to work my
butt off to prove that I deserved
it."
On the other hand, Mahrt
pointed out that some people
who get tenure feel that they no
longer have to work as hard.
Chase expressed concern
about the growing perception of

tenure as job security rather
than a guarantee of academic
freedom as the institution was
first intended.
Used as excuse
Chase acknowledged that
pressure to spend time on re
search often prevents junior
faculty from becoming as deep
ly involved in such services as
advising, but he also noted that
it is often claimed as an excuse
not to get involved
Teaching and academic ad
vising haven't been sufficiently
rewarded, said Larson. There is
subtle pressure to concentrate
on research, he said.
Tenure sets a goal to work
toward, according to Chase.
"It is a stimulus for individ
uals to make sure their own
productivity has reached the
point where a review by their
own peers puts them on a na
tional stature. It's much the
same as graduation for a stu
dent. You have to achieve cer
tain levels of performance along
the line." he said
Not automatic
At the same time, it is not
pure and simple that once hav
ing achieved national status, the
person is going to get tenure, he
added.
"I don't have a thought about
how we can make the pressure
go away. But I can be damn sure
they'll get a fair evaluation."
said Hastorf, adding that to
day's tight job market means
even more pressure "Some are
stimulated by pressure, others
choke. There is a nice study to
be done on foul shooting in the
NBA," said the psycholgist.
"Some seem to always sink the
game-winner, others always
miss."
At the same time, said
Hastorf, especially promising
young faculty can put some
pressure of their own on the Uni
versity. The promotion process
may be invoked before the cus
tomary six-year probation peri
od is up if a department chair
man is afraid of losing an espe
cially good person to some other
top college But such cases are
relatively rare.
More time?
In fact, a good deal of dis
cussion has centered on a longer
probationary period to give can
didates more time to become es

manist does is not likely to be
before they are in their 40s."
Dekker admits, however, that
a longer probationary period
poses new problems. "There
would be obvious problems in a
system which prolonged in
security further. There would
have to be some way of com
pensating (junior faculty) for
the extended uncertainty."

sics Department Mark Edwards

Albert Hastorf
Three years have passed
since an ASSU Task Force com
pleted a study of tenure and
teaching evaluation here as part
of a student push for more input
into University personnel de
cisions.
Today, according to acting
Provost Albert Hastorf, eval
uation of teaching is just as
much a part of the rigorous
tenure promotion procedure as
evaluation of research.
"A great deal of time is spent
reviewing evidence for the part
that teaching plays. But it is ex
ceedingly difficult to evaluate
— far more difficult than eval
uating a person's expertise

News analysis

within their discipline," said
Dr. Robert Chase, chairman of
the Advisory Board to the
Academic Council, the group
which conducts the final
analysis of all appointments and
promotions
"I don't think it's that the
University doesn't pay enough
attention to teaching, it's that
ths area is so difficult to eval
uate," he said.
Teaching and research are
the two major aspects of a can
didate's achievement that are
weighed through an elaborate
procedure which begins at the
department level and ends
either with rejection (at any
stage subject to appeal) or ap
proval of the Board of Trustees
The process
Typically assistant pro
fessors will be entering their
sixth year at the University
when their department chair
man will recommend to the
dean of the particular school
that tenure be considered.
The office of the provost coor
dinates the entire process, be
ginning with the forwarding to
the department of a standard
form that constitutes the core of
a candidate file which then
grows rapidly.
If a vote of the department
faculty is favorable, the chair
man will form a committee to
gather evidence of the can
didate's excellence. This in
cludes publications by the can
didate. a nationwide peer eval
uation comparing the candidate
to the finest in the field, letters
from colleagues and former stu
dents and student course eval
uations, to mention a few ele
ments.
Once compiled, the evidence
is forwarded to the respective
dean for consideration with the
advice of the school's Appoint
ments and Promotions Commit
tee. This group may return the
file to the department for more
evidence or pass it on to the
provost for similar considera
tion.
Options
The provost and his staff once
again have the option of request
ing more documentation or
passing it on to the Advisory
Board, which also may send it
back down the line for more sup
port or may send it on to the
president and Board of Trustees
for final approval.
At each level, if the process is
stopped the candidate may ap
peal to the next higher step, ac
cording to Hastorf. "If the prov
ost says no, you're not just
saying no to a candidate, you're
saying no to a whole big part of
the system."
"The deans were extremely
generous with their time and
their willingness to reconsider
the case." said recently tenured
Music Prof. William Mahrt,
who was initially denied tenure.
"I had the notion once the

thing had been turned down that
I shouldn't worry about it, that I
should just go find another job. I
thought there was probably not
much chance that they would
change their minds. But when it
evolved that people in the de
partment wanted them to re
consider, they offered to do it if
there was substantial new in
formation." he said.
Teaching important
Mahrt offered himself as a
case in point that research is not
necessarily everything in the
tenure decision. "I was granted
tenure without a substantial list
of publications," he said. "My
case for tenure was much
stronger on the teaching side
than research."
A candidate is expected to be
excellent in one and good in the
other, said Hastorf about the
controversial balance between
teaching and research.
"If you can see that a guy is
going to be a great teacher, you
don't want to leave the research
column empty because he can
certainly become a deadhead
later. Research shows that you
are intellectually alive," he
said.
Many considerations
"It may be a fact that quality
research is a condition for good
teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new
president, who is very con
cerned with teaching quality,
we are not in quite as grave a
state as we were before, when
research was everything," said
Larson.
"Being a good teacher is not
solely a factor of being a show
person," he said. "It exhibits
time and organization, caring
for students. Teaching and re
search are essentially at odds
with each other because it takes
time to be a good teacher, but it
takes time away from re
search."
The pressure on junior facul
ty to do extensive research as a
basis forpromotion to tenure,
the "publish or perish" maxim,
has long been a controversial
subject.

Tenure is one of the points at
which pressures from all sides
come together, said English De
partment Chairman George
Dekker. The candidate is look
ing for some assurance of his
future, and the University is
seeking to remain the best and
to keep a steady flow of young
blood coming in.he said.
"Publish or perish" seems to
indicate 'grind it out,' but it re
ally means 'think it out.' It's
much better to publish four
smashingly good experiments
than 22 satisfactory ones," said
Hastorf.
"Clearly, pressure is
nerveracking for some young
people, and not so for others,"
he said. "My first reaction to
getting tenure was to work my
butt off to prove that I deserved
it."
On the other hand, Mahrt
pointed out that some people
who get tenure feel that they no
longer have to work as hard.
Chase expressed concern
about the growing perception of

tenure as job security rather
than a guarantee of academic
freedom as the institution was
first intended.
Used as excuse
Chase acknowledged that
pressure to spend time on re
search often prevents junior
faculty from becoming as deep
ly involved in such services as
advising, but he also noted that
it is often claimed as an excuse
not to get involved
Teaching and academic ad
vising haven't been sufficiently
rewarded, said Larson. There is
subtle pressure to concentrate
on research, he said.
Tenure sets a goal to work
toward, according to Chase.
"It is a stimulus for individ
uals to make sure their own
productivity has reached the
point where a review by their
own peers puts them on a na
tional stature. It's much the
same as graduation for a stu
dent. You have to achieve cer
tain levels of performance along
the line." he said
Not automatic
At the same time, it is not
pure and simple that once hav
ing achieved national status, the
person is going to get tenure, he
added.
"I don't have a thought about
how we can make the pressure
go away. But I can be damn sure
they'll get a fair evaluation."
said Hastorf, adding that to
day's tight job market means
even more pressure "Some are
stimulated by pressure, others
choke. There is a nice study to
be done on foul shooting in the
NBA," said the psycholgist.
"Some seem to always sink the
game-winner, others always
miss."
At the same time, said
Hastorf, especially promising
young faculty can put some
pressure of their own on the Uni
versity. The promotion process
may be invoked before the cus
tomary six-year probation peri
od is up if a department chair
man is afraid of losing an espe
cially good person to some other
top college But such cases are
relatively rare.
More time?
In fact, a good deal of dis
cussion has centered on a longer
probationary period to give can
didates more time to become es

manist does is not likely to be
before they are in their 40s."
Dekker admits, however, that
a longer probationary period
poses new problems. "There
would be obvious problems in a
system which prolonged in
security further. There would
have to be some way of com
pensating (junior faculty) for
the extended uncertainty."
Opportunities limited
Acting Chairman of the Clas
sics Department Mark Edwards
said that today, if a person is not
promoted, it can be difficult for
them to continue in the field.
"If the person won't be kept
on, in a way. the earlier the de
cision is made the better." he
said.
"One thing about the six-year
tenure rule is that it does force
the institution to organize itself
to make a tough decision," said
Hastorf.
In the final analysis, the en
tire concept of tenure is the is
sue. It has stirred controversy
in academe as long as it has ex
isted.
Dekker, who taught for a time
in England, offered the alter-

'Stanford doesn \ want to be just good,
it wants to be in the top three
. . . Stanford can t afford to make a mistake'

tablished in their fields.
"I think in my own view that
the six-year tenure decision
time in the humanities is a little
unreal and doesn't promote the
best work," said Van Harvey.
Religious Studies Department
chairman.
"I would like to see contracts
made for a longer period. Per
haps a second appointment of
nine or 10 years (rather than the
current three-year reappoint
ment) would be a much fairer
test," he said. "The timing puts
a tremendous premium on vis
ibility, and I happen to think
within the humanities that's
very hard to get in five to six
years."
Too little time
Harvey noted that the time
factor forced people to write
hurriedly and possibly not as
well as they might be capable
"It's true that you can't tell
who the outstanding scholars in
the humanities are going to be
until much later," said Dekker
"And it does bedevil our de
cisions. The best work that a hu

native procedure in use there —
an exhaustive initial search for
a person the University expects
to keep, with tenure nearly auto
matic According to Dekker the
probation period is only three
years and the candidate is not
expected to achieve a great deal
in the way of research by that
time.
Instead, there is a career
grade after 12 years with pro
motion to the next step not as
easy. "That's where the incen
tive comes in. because you had
to have done something I think
it's a more humane system with
less pressure built into it."he
said.
'Realistic prospects'
On the other hand. "Stanford
is a place where realistic pros
pects of tenure do exist," said
Dekker "And in that respect
it's a better place to get an in
itial appointment than Harvard.
Yale or Princeton where assis
tant professorships tend to be
transitory I think we get better
assistant professors than
Harvard or Yale because we do

offer a reasonable chance of
tenure."
"We work hard at making it
possible for people to gain
tenure by preparing the road
with the initial appointment.
This isn't true at many schools
in the country where young peo
ple appointed to assistant pro
fessorships are put in the bad
situation where they do not have
time to produce what they are
capable of."
The problem with tenure is
that once a University is no
longer growing at a rapid rate it
is very difficult to avoid having
an "old" faculty, said newly
tenured Computer Science Prof
.Joseph Oliger. who admits that
he is becoming more convinced
of the virtues of the system
Incentives needed
"Too bad that there's not
more incentive like there is in
industry, where you have a job
as long as you're doing it well
and someone still wants the
work done." he said
"The University has to make
a total judgment of the person."
said Mahrt If it's going to give a
person 30 years of the kind of
freedom tenure implies, the
University does have a right to
look him over very carefully."
The care with which Stanford
handles the procedure im
pressed Harvey, who previously
has served as chairman of re
ligious studies at the the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania where, he
said, there was no set pro
cedure.
"Ry the time a file has gotten
to the dean it contains a very im
pressive mass of evidence The
dean and his committee should
have a fairly good case one way
or the other." he said
The clear aim of the pro

evolved that people in the de
partment wanted them to re
consider, they offered to do it if
there was substantial new in
formation." he said.
Teaching important
Mahrt offered himself as a
case in point that research is not
necessarily everything in the
tenure decision. "I was granted
tenure without a substantial list
of publications," he said. "My
case for tenure was much
stronger on the teaching side
than research."
A candidate is expected to be
excellent in one and good in the
other, said Hastorf about the
controversial balance between
teaching and research.
"If you can see that a guy is
going to be a great teacher, you
don't want to leave the research
column empty because he can
certainly become a deadhead
later. Research shows that you
are intellectually alive," he
said.
Many considerations
"It may be a fact that quality
research is a condition for good
teaching, but it is not the single
basis." said Greg Larson, who
served on the COP and the ASSU
task force when improvement
of teaching was a strong student
issue.
"Just due to all the dis
cussion, and now with the new
president, who is very con
cerned with teaching quality,
we are not in quite as grave a
state as we were before, when
research was everything," said
Larson.
"Being a good teacher is not
solely a factor of being a show
person," he said. "It exhibits
time and organization, caring
for students. Teaching and re
search are essentially at odds
with each other because it takes
time to be a good teacher, but it
takes time away from re
search."
The pressure on junior facul
ty to do extensive research as a
basis forpromotion to tenure,
the "publish or perish" maxim,
has long been a controversial
subject.

Tenure is one of the points at
which pressures from all sides
come together, said English De
partment Chairman George
Dekker. The candidate is look
ing for some assurance of his
future, and the University is
seeking to remain the best and
to keep a steady flow of young
blood coming in.he said.
"Publish or perish" seems to
indicate 'grind it out,' but it re
ally means 'think it out.' It's
much better to publish four
smashingly good experiments
than 22 satisfactory ones," said
Hastorf.
"Clearly, pressure is
nerveracking for some young
people, and not so for others,"
he said. "My first reaction to
getting tenure was to work my
butt off to prove that I deserved
it."
On the other hand, Mahrt
pointed out that some people
who get tenure feel that they no
longer have to work as hard.
Chase expressed concern
about the growing perception of

tenure as job security rather
than a guarantee of academic
freedom as the institution was
first intended.
Used as excuse
Chase acknowledged that
pressure to spend time on re
search often prevents junior
faculty from becoming as deep
ly involved in such services as
advising, but he also noted that
it is often claimed as an excuse
not to get involved
Teaching and academic ad
vising haven't been sufficiently
rewarded, said Larson. There is
subtle pressure to concentrate
on research, he said.
Tenure sets a goal to work
toward, according to Chase.
"It is a stimulus for individ
uals to make sure their own
productivity has reached the
point where a review by their
own peers puts them on a na
tional stature. It's much the
same as graduation for a stu
dent. You have to achieve cer
tain levels of performance along
the line." he said
Not automatic
At the same time, it is not
pure and simple that once hav
ing achieved national status, the
person is going to get tenure, he
added.
"I don't have a thought about
how we can make the pressure
go away. But I can be damn sure
they'll get a fair evaluation."
said Hastorf, adding that to
day's tight job market means
even more pressure "Some are
stimulated by pressure, others
choke. There is a nice study to
be done on foul shooting in the
NBA," said the psycholgist.
"Some seem to always sink the
game-winner, others always
miss."
At the same time, said
Hastorf, especially promising
young faculty can put some
pressure of their own on the Uni
versity. The promotion process
may be invoked before the cus
tomary six-year probation peri
od is up if a department chair
man is afraid of losing an espe
cially good person to some other
top college But such cases are
relatively rare.
More time?
In fact, a good deal of dis
cussion has centered on a longer
probationary period to give can
didates more time to become es

manist does is not likely to be
before they are in their 40s."
Dekker admits, however, that
a longer probationary period
poses new problems. "There
would be obvious problems in a
system which prolonged in
security further. There would
have to be some way of com
pensating (junior faculty) for
the extended uncertainty."
Opportunities limited
Acting Chairman of the Clas
sics Department Mark Edwards
said that today, if a person is not
promoted, it can be difficult for
them to continue in the field.
"If the person won't be kept
on, in a way. the earlier the de
cision is made the better." he
said.
"One thing about the six-year
tenure rule is that it does force
the institution to organize itself
to make a tough decision," said
Hastorf.
In the final analysis, the en
tire concept of tenure is the is
sue. It has stirred controversy
in academe as long as it has ex
isted.
Dekker, who taught for a time
in England, offered the alter-

'Stanford doesn \ want to be just good,
it wants to be in the top three
. . . Stanford can t afford to make a mistake'

tablished in their fields.
"I think in my own view that
the six-year tenure decision
time in the humanities is a little
unreal and doesn't promote the
best work," said Van Harvey.
Religious Studies Department
chairman.
"I would like to see contracts
made for a longer period. Per
haps a second appointment of
nine or 10 years (rather than the
current three-year reappoint
ment) would be a much fairer
test," he said. "The timing puts
a tremendous premium on vis
ibility, and I happen to think
within the humanities that's
very hard to get in five to six
years."
Too little time
Harvey noted that the time
factor forced people to write
hurriedly and possibly not as
well as they might be capable
"It's true that you can't tell
who the outstanding scholars in
the humanities are going to be
until much later," said Dekker
"And it does bedevil our de
cisions. The best work that a hu

native procedure in use there —
an exhaustive initial search for
a person the University expects
to keep, with tenure nearly auto
matic According to Dekker the
probation period is only three
years and the candidate is not
expected to achieve a great deal
in the way of research by that
time.
Instead, there is a career
grade after 12 years with pro
motion to the next step not as
easy. "That's where the incen
tive comes in. because you had
to have done something I think
it's a more humane system with
less pressure built into it."he
said.
'Realistic prospects'
On the other hand. "Stanford
is a place where realistic pros
pects of tenure do exist," said
Dekker "And in that respect
it's a better place to get an in
itial appointment than Harvard.
Yale or Princeton where assis
tant professorships tend to be
transitory I think we get better
assistant professors than
Harvard or Yale because we do

offer a reasonable chance of
tenure."
"We work hard at making it
possible for people to gain
tenure by preparing the road
with the initial appointment.
This isn't true at many schools
in the country where young peo
ple appointed to assistant pro
fessorships are put in the bad
situation where they do not have
time to produce what they are
capable of."
The problem with tenure is
that once a University is no
longer growing at a rapid rate it
is very difficult to avoid having
an "old" faculty, said newly
tenured Computer Science Prof
.Joseph Oliger. who admits that
he is becoming more convinced
of the virtues of the system
Incentives needed
"Too bad that there's not
more incentive like there is in
industry, where you have a job
as long as you're doing it well
and someone still wants the
work done." he said
"The University has to make
a total judgment of the person."
said Mahrt If it's going to give a
person 30 years of the kind of
freedom tenure implies, the
University does have a right to
look him over very carefully."
The care with which Stanford
handles the procedure im
pressed Harvey, who previously
has served as chairman of re
ligious studies at the the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania where, he
said, there was no set pro
cedure.
"Ry the time a file has gotten
to the dean it contains a very im
pressive mass of evidence The
dean and his committee should
have a fairly good case one way
or the other." he said
The clear aim of the pro
cedure. according to Hastorf. is
to develop the best possible fac
ulty
"Tenured faculty are in
terested in maintaining and
building a strong department,
even though it might involve
people that they do not like per
sonally." said Dekker.
The rigor of the procedure
makes it difficult for personal
judgments to take a role "It
would be awfully hard for some
one to make a political case out
side the evidence if 10 of the best
people in the country say the
candidate is one of the best,"
said Harvey.
"Stanford doesn't want to be
just good." said Harvey, "it
wants to be in the top three i col
leges in the country) Stanford
can't afford to make a mis
take."
