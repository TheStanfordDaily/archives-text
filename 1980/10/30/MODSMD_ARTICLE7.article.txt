# Students often unaware of the stresses they encounter
## 'Slow down you crazy child': tension, stress 
### Monika Guttman 
In recent years, there has
been a lot of publicity about the
societal phenomenon of stress.
Magazines are publishing more
and more articles about stress,
businesses are holding seminars
in stress management, and new
studies are coming out linking
stress with almost everything
from acne to cancer Yet even
though there is more awareness
about the existence of stress,
many people are confused about
how they, specifically, are af
fected
In the academic atmosphere
of a University, it is easy for stu
dents to underestimate some of
the stresses which affect them
daily. According to Loraine
Zappert of Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPSi
here, students will ask about
stress management workshops
right before exam time, but by
that time "it's really too late to
teach skills which can and
should be used on a long-term
basis." she said
Jan Kuersten. a counselor at
the Palo Alto YMCA who
teaches stress management, de
fines stress as "any change in
the environment which requires
a coping response ." She said
that students at a University are
constantly encountering new
situations, whether social,
academic or emotional, and this
leads to a high stress factor
All the changes
An article in Psychology To
day i Sept 19781 entitled "Col
lege Blues" points out that stu
dents in college "experience si
multaneously all the transitions
that are major stresses in
adulthood " It lists loss of fami
ly and friends, career decisions,
new surroundings and changes
in social status as some of the
stresses which affect students
on a regular basis.
Other factors which produce
stress in the student's life may
be taken for granted For in
stance. said Zappert. rising tui
tion costs make it necessary for
many families to sacrifice more
in order to send a student to col
lege, and this in turn can create
a lot of stress for the student
who feels an obligation to per
form better academically.
Also, said Zappert, while the
students are here they try on a
lot of different roles in an effort
to assume an individual identi
ty. "It's part of what a student

works through in college He or
she will assume different bits
and pieces from the environ
ment. trying to find what works
best fof each individual person
ality." This leads to a normal
questioning period which can be
stressful.
Social pressures
Another form of stress is
found in social situations. Aside
from the stress experienced by
constantly meeting new people,
students at a university often
lack the support systems they
had when in high school-sup
port systems which may take
years to develop, according to
Dr Aaron Beck and Dr Jeffrey
Young, two therapists at the
University of Pennsylvania
Usually the high school stu
dent has "a circle of friends to
party with, a good friend to con
fide in. a parent to turn to in a
time of crisis, and an intimate
boyfriend or girlfriend to love."
When in college, the new rela
tionships which will eventually
take the place of these old ones
take time to develop, often leav
ing a sense of lonliness in the in
terim, they said
The lack of support systems
can make other stresses more
difficult to manage, according
to Beck and Young
Differences
Yet stress is, for the most
part, highly individual
"Each person has different
anxieties and tensions." said
Zappert. "Stress is not just
biological. Since a large part of
stress is created internally, it
becomes a very personal prob
lem."
Kuerston said that stress be
comes very personal because it
is based on how people view a
certain problem
"A large portion of stress can
be manipulated by people's per
ception of a situation." she said
"There is a need to learn what is
important to you, and then to
protect yourself from your en
vironment For instance, stu
dents at Stanford face a lot of
different expectations of what
they should be getting out of the
University.' This comes from
administrators, from parents,
from professors and even from
peers And each individual will
feel the stress this creates in a
different way."
High expectations
Beck and Young also see ex
pectations as a real form of
stress for the student.

"Many students enter college
with a past record of successes
both academic and social. Al
though they recognize, ration
ally, that they are with others
who have achieved as much,
they still expect to excel," they
said Inordinate importance is
attached to each disappointing
grade, and the students begin to
think that they have over
estimated their academic
potential Competition on any
level only accentuates the prob
lem.
Cultural customs and expec
tations hinder the student from
recognizing stress and dealing
with it. according to Kuerston.
"People are becoming more
aware of stress. but those things
which can help to relieve stress

are still seen as wastes of time.
For instance, how many stu
dents do you know who can easi
ly say i need to take a quarter
off to play around 0 ' If you need
to take time off to take a break,
then you're coping, not copping
out." she said.
Illness as a 'remedy'
Kuerston added that in many
cases, people would prefer to
get really ill before they could
admit that they needed to take a
break "Illness is often an easy
excuse,"
Zappert also asserted that
many students feel they are
"wasting time" if they take
what are really necessary
breaks.
"People don't often take time
to just 'sit and smell the

flowers,' " she said. "It's a mis
conception that 'getting it'
means sitting at a desk with a
book in front of you While a cer
tain amount of studying is of
course necessary, getting it'
often happens in the shower. It's
important to learn to allow
yourself to go to the movies, go
for a jog, whatever."
The nature of the task of stu
dying can be very isolating, said
Zappert, which can create a lot
of stress. "If you don't have
built in rewards, you're working
too hard People let it get so bad
that they develop physical prob
lems."
Dr. John Dorman of Cowell
Student Health Center said that
he sees students who have phvsi
