## Editorial Vote Anderson, Cranston 
### 
President - Anderson
In an election dominated by cynicism.
John Anderson represents a positive
choice The Daily is pleased to endorse
Anderson for president.
Unlike Jimmv Carter and Ronald Re
agan. Anderson has an intelligent, re
alistic plan for dealing with the energy
problem. Unless this country begins to
tackle this question, both inflation at
home and uncertainty abroad will con
tinue and worsen. Rather than ignore the
problem as Reagan does, or waste money
on marginal programs as Carter does. An
derson has proposed a 50-cent gas tax in
order to cut consumption and has stressed
that Americans need to face up to chang
ing their lifestyles in order to cope with
the painful changes ahead Anderson is
also in favor of more rapid development of
alternative energy sources.
Anderson shows less of an under
standing of foreign policy issues. For ex
ample, his support of Israel's expansion of
its West Bank settlements shows a com
plete disregard for the Palestinian in
terests in the region.
Anderson has also been vague as to
whether he favors increases in weapons
procurement or in payroll for the defense
budget The latter is a justified expense;
the former only escalates the arms race.
Anderson has sought liberal support in
spite of the fact that many of his pro
posals. especially his economic plans, are
♦>ssentially conservative. We recognize,
however that his many of his views have
legitimately changed since he first en
tered Congress.
Yet a close look a the two major party
candidates uncovers more basic flaws.
' - than four years. Carter has taken
this country from a hopeful new beginning
i d vith incompentence. cynicism and po
ll-. al opportunism led it into a pit of dis
i .uragement and apathy
Reagan, on theother hand, is a man with
mind-set irrevocably locked in an era
that has long since ceased to exist He has
demonstrated a dangerous
lark «-f knowledge and concern about for
eign policy, women's rights, environmen
tal questions and aid for the disadvan
taged.
' ne of the oft-repeated claims this fall
has been that a vote for Anderson is a vote
fO2 Reagan, and the electorate should

swallow its displeasure with Carter in or
der to avoid a Reagan presidency. Many
seemed to have given in to the hysteria of
this campaign of fear, and many who
would otherwise vote for Anderson now
say they have no other choice but to vote
for Carter "I'd really like to vote for An
derson . . he's clearly the best candidate
. . but he doesn't have a chance," is the
general view.
Rather than accept this kind of "logic"
and cast a negative, cynical vote, voters
should choose a candidate who demon
strates a willingness to engage in real
dialogue and sincerely address critical is
sues.
John Anderson is such a candidate. To
select one of the major party candidates is
truly to waste your vote.
Senator - Cranston
U.S. Senator Alan Cranston deserves
reelection to a third term.
He has proved himself a distinguished
and popular member of the Senate, and
has often led his colleaugues in support of
arms negotiation, women's and minority
rights, environmental protection and
energy legislation.
Cranston has committed himself to
arms control, calling ratification of the
SALT II agreement with the Soviet Union
"the number one item on my agenda,"
while his opponent, who is seeking public
office for the first time in his life at age 68,
calls for a massive increase of U.S. arma
ments and a subsequent negotiation with
the Soviets. While Cranston's opponent,
Paul Gann. is correct in saying that the
treaty must not give either side a decisive
advantage, we believe that the kinds of in
creases in military spending which he is
proposing are not justified.
Domestically, Cranston has called for
ratification of the Equal Rights Amend
ment and has supported many popular so
cial programs. Gann. meanwhile, lays as
his claim to fame his cosponsorship with
Howard Jarvis of Proposition 13 here in
California, and he lent his support to
Jarvis's Proposition 9. an irresponsible
tax—cutting measure soundly defeated by
voters last spring.
Alan Cranston has led the career of a
true statesman. In his lifetimehehas been
a foreign correspondent, author, play
wright and legislator. The state of Califor
nia should be proud to return him to office.
