# Reagan foreign policy 'dangerous,' says panel

### Theresa Simons 
Three professors from the Interna
tional Relations and Political Science
departments agreed that Ronald Re
agan is the presidential candidate
with the most potentially dangerous
foreign policy, in a panel discussion in
Branner Hall last night.
Prof. Alexander Dallin, chairman
of the International Relations depart
ment, Assoc. Prof David Abernethy,
vice-chairman of that department,
and Prof. Robert Keohane, chairman
of the Political Science department,
outlined their views of the candidates'
foreign policy before an audience of
about 90.
Although they agreed that Reagan
was the worst foreign policy choice,
their explanations varied. Abernethy
and Dallin noted that too little was
known about John Anderson's foreign
policy to evaluate him very com
prehensively and based their argu
ments against Reagan on his own
statements about his world view and
on his choice of foreign policy ad
visers. Keohane argued against Re
agan by building a strong defense of
President Jimmy Carter's foreignpol
icy record
"None of the three major can
didates knows much about foreign af
fairs," Dallin said He added that
Carter had learned more about the
world during his term in office, but
commented that Carter's record was
full of contradictions and zigzags that
Carter did not seem conscious of.
Dallin observed that all three can
didates were very dependent on their
advisers. He felt that many of Carter's
best advisers, including former Secre
tary of State Cyrus Vance and Paul
Warnke, chief U.S. negotiator of the
SALT talks, were sorely missed, but
concluded that Reagan's group of ad
visers were worse.
"I know some of the people from the
Hoover Institution who are advising
him (Reagan), or think they are advis
ing him." Dallin said. "Well, my can
did view is that if they move to Wash
ington. Stanford's loss will be the na
tion's loss."

Dallin said that Reagan's foreign
policy could be as confusing as
Carter's due to potential disagree
ment and conflict within the Reagan
staff over such issues as the recog
nition of Taiwan or the People's Re
public of China. Dallin acknowledged
that Reagan had some good advisers,
but added that their role was unclear
"Virtually all of the outside world is
scared of a Reagan victory," Dallin
said.
Abernethy criticized the presiden
tial campaign for its inattention to
Third World issues. "To hear the cam
paign , there are only two flags in the
world â€” the U.S. and the Soviet."
He condemned the U.S. tendency to
view the Third World, which is com
posed of two-thirds of the world's
countries and contains one-half of the
world's population, as either U.S. al
lies or Soviet sympathizers.
