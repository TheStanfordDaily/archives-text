# China expands gold mining, prospecting
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — A gold rush is on in the People's
Republic of China.
With the price of gold continuing to range
between $600 and $700 an ounce on interna
tional markets, China is rapidly expanding
its gold mines, giving them nearly the same
priority as oil-field development as a way to
finance its modernization program.
Beijing at the same time is encouraging
more peasants to go into "mass pros
pecting," searching the hillsides for new
veins of gold and panning the streams for
nuggets. Encouraged by the government's
higher prices for gold, rural communes are
assigning more of their members to the
thousands of small gold mines scattered
around the country.
China has not yet disclosed any com
prehensive figures on either its gold re
serves or annual production as required by
the International Monetary Fund, which
China just joined. But the official New Chi
na News Agency reported Monday from
Shandong that current production is running
50 percent above last year's levels and is
more than twice that of 1975.
The goal for 1985. Chinese banking
sources added, is to more than double cur
rent output — and that could put China
among the top 10 gold producers in the
world.
Three gold mines in Shandong province, a

peninsula that juts into the Yellow Sea, are
being expanded with American and Canadi
an advice and equipment, and together are
expected to produce nearly 500,000 ounces of
gold a year by 1983, worth more than $300
million at current prices.
That expansion program and the an
nounced development of new gold strikes
has led one Hong Kong specialist in the Chi
nese economy to put the likely value of 1985
production, if calculated at $700 an ounce, at
nearly $3 billion, roughly a third of the value
of China's total exports.
But other analysts are more cautious,
noting that current Chinese gold production
is unknown, and that Beijing has had dif
ficulty in the last two years in fulfilling most
of its development plans.
Also in Shaanxi province, northwest of
Beijing, gold production has soared, the
New China News Agency said in another re
port Monday, because of the higher prices
paid peasant prospectors and the bonuses
given miners for increasing their output. By
the end of last month, the agency reported,
gold production was double that originally
planned for all of 1980, and in one county
prospectors panning for nuggets had found
four times the amount they did last year.
To increase gold production, especially at
new mines, Beijing has formed special units
within the People's Liberation Army's Con
struction Corps, dispatching them to

Heilongjiang, Shandong and to Sichuan
province in the southwest.
Although Hong Kong bankers say that
China has sold some gold there in the last
year and a half, most anlayst here believe
that Beijing will choose to add its increased
production to its reserve holdings — esti
mated by some at 400 tons, although that is
no more than a guess — and use those, in
turn, as an underpining for loans and trade
deals to develop the whole economy.
The Communist Party newspaper Peo
ple 's Daily has made it clear in recent com
mentaries that gold mining gets top govern
ment priority for whatever resources, fi
nancing and equipment it needs. Represent
atives of the U.S. company, Davy McKee,
and the Canadian. Wright Engineering, in
volved in the three Shandong mines said
that they have experienced few of the delays
that Western contractors have experienced
in other major projects in China.
"Some of their mines would not be profit
able in many other countries, but their low
er labor costs and willingness to write off
the startup investment immediately bring
production costs way down. Besides, they
are not worried if it costs a bit more to pro
duce gold here than in the United States or
South Africa because that gold is all pure
profit in the sense that it buys the factories
thev want."
