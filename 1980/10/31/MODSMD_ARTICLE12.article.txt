## 
### Associated Press 
The "Doonesbury" cartoon strip has been tem
porarily dropped by several newspapers because
of a story line involving "a fantastic voyage
through the brain of Honald Reagan "
The Indianapolis Star. Indiana's largest news
paper, cut the strip from its pages today because
of what it called an "unwarranted attack on the
Republican presidential candidate.
In the space where the strip normally appears
was the note:
"Doonesbury will not be published in The Star
until next Tuesday because the strips prepared for
publication until the election are an unfair, one
sided and unwarranted attack on Ronald Re
agan."
The newspaper said the strip would return on
election day.
In California, Wayne Sargent, editor of the San
Bernardino Sun-Telegram, said over the weekend
that his newspaper would not carry the Reagan
strips on its comic pages, calling them "a fan
tasized and vicious attack. "

The Sun-Telegram, which has not endorsed a
presidential candidate, published the entire
episode involving Reagan on Friday on the news
pages, with a disclaimer
Herbert Davidson, editor and publisher of
the News-Journal newspapers, said "bitter elec
tioneering of this type has no place in a comic
strip."
He also said the newspaper plans to resume
publishing Doonesbury after the election
The strip currently is featuring a fictional TV
newsman named Roland Hedlev, who in one in
stallment invites viewers to join him on a "fan
tastic voyage through the brain of Ronald Re
agan." and reports that a vision disorder has left
the candidate "only able to see backward through
a rose-colored mist."
The Star on Sunday endorsed Reagan calling
Carter's record "one of mediocrity and blunder
ing."
At least one Indianapolis radio station, WIBC,
said it would read the strip on the air daily. Also,
Indianapolis television station WISH said it would
show the strip on its nightly newscasts.
