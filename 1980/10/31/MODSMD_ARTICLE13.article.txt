### David Frank 
"President Jimmy Carter" and Republican
challenger "Ronald Reagan" debated again last
night before an audience of Branner freshmen.
The participants weren't really Carter and Re
agan. but the two speakers — one a Stanford stu
dent — did help clarify the issues for the students,
many of whom will be voting Tuesday.
Junior Richard Bridgeford (Reagan) and Marc
Strassman (Carter) addressed many of the
themes emphasized in the real debate between the
candidates Tuesday night.
Bridgeford reiterated Reagan's commitment
toward a foreign policy of "peace through
strength," emphasizing that Reagan is not a
"warmonger" who opposes all strategic arms
treaties with the Soviet Union.
Nevertheless. Strassman, a 1969 Harvard grad
uate who is among several candidates opposing
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) in the gen
eral election, pointed to Reagan's "tendency to
advocate the use of military force. To put him in

as Commander-in-Chief would be to create the
potential for a nuclear blood bath."
Beyond the familiar political songs and dances,
the speakers sometimes touched upon how the is
sues related to college students
Bridgeford noted that Reagan, as governor of
California, had increased student loan aid by 915
percent, implying that, if elected. Reagan could
do more of the same and help Stanford students
with their tuition debts.
Strassman said that he disagreed with Carter's
implementation of draft registration But he
added that Carter's policies of trying to divorce
America from serious dependence on Arab oil
would lessen the chances of military intervention,
reducing the need for registration and possible
conscription.
The debate was coordinated in part by Branner
House Associate Mariann Bverwalter, who
coaches the Stanford Debate Team Bverwalter
said she hopes to encourage an ongoing program
of debates involving students throughout the year.
