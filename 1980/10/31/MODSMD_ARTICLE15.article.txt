## Not just a 'one-shot' protest 
### 
Don't waste your vote.
If you can't bring yourself to vote for Jimmy
Carter or Ronald Reagan and you're looking for
an alternative, consider Ed Clark, the Libertarian
candidate Of course, there are also John An
derson and Barry Commoner and some other mi
nor party candidates
But the only way to say that you want a fun
damental change in the policies of the United
States government that will return to the people
their social and economic freedoms is to vote for
Clark.
Take Anderson. A vote for John Anderson
doesn't signify a protest against the present sys
tem of government privilege and interven
tionism. Anderson does not see that past govern
ment policies are the primary source of our cur
rent economic and social problems
Anderson's campaign was supposed to be a
"campaign of ideas," but the only "new" idea in
his 300-page platform is a 50 cent-per-gallon gas
tax, a simple-minded "solution" that would send
a shock wave through the economy, hitting the
poor the hardest.
Anderson fails to question subsidies to the nu
clear industry (through the Price-Anderson Act
and government waste treatment facilities), to
the oil companies (through the synthetic fuels
program), and to the utilities (through state
franchise monopolies).
Anderson paints himself as a dove, and yet he
has voted for most of the new weapons systems
the Pentagon has proposed < including the neutron
bomb and the Trident submarine), and he sup
ports the "quick strike" foreign intervention
force, the "potential use" of force in the Middle
East, and the introduction of theater nuclear
weapons in Europe.
In a sense, a vote for Anderson is worse than a
vote for Carter or Reagan because it means your
vote was captured by imagery rather than reality.
John Anderson is merely a composite of Carter
and Reagan; his prescriptions are not fundamen
tally different from the failed policies of his Dem
ocratic and Republican opponents.
Now consider Barry Commoner. Commoner
and his Citizens Party will tell you that they stand
for citizens taking more control of the decisions
made by the "big corporations." As Commoner
puts it, "We've got to begin the task of taking
power."
Commoner won't use the word socialism be
cause it has been discredited, but his vague pro
posals are just that. What he really means, of
course, is that Commoner and his friends should
run things according to their tastes. A vote for
Commoner is vote for more government, which
can hardly be called a real alternative.
Quite the opposite of the other candidates, the
policies of Ed Clark and the Libertarian Party are
based upon a philosophy of respect for the rights
of other people. When this principled approach is

applied to domestic policy it means respect for
the peaceful, honest actions of every individual.
Applied to foreign policy, it means respect for the
other peoples of the world to solve their own prob
lems without our interference.
Clark knows that government policies to help
the poor have failed miserably, while actually
locking people into their poverty. Occupational
licensure, the minimum wage, zoning laws, and
thousands of other government restrictions have
closed off the routes out of poverty while favoring
established interests A Libertarian adminis
tration would end these injustices and restore eco
nomic opportunity to everyone.
Clark knows that the public school system has
failed miserably because it removes the element
crucial to keeping the educational system healthy
â€” choice. Clark's proposal for dollar-for-dollar
education tax credits would open up alternative
schools to the poor and middle class, something
only the rich can now afford.
Clark knows that government is the greatest
threat to our civil liberties and would abolish all
laws against pornography, gambling, and prosti
tution, end government harassment of gays, and
legalize all drugs, a move that would end the
crime wave caused by the "New Prohibition." A
Libertarian administration would abolish the
CIA. the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Bu
reau of Alcohol. Tobacco and Firearms, all agen
cies which systematically have violated the rights
of peaceful citizens
Clark knows that a large part of the federal
budget consists of subsidies to business and agri
culture. and agencies that accomplish nothing,
such as the Department of Energy. A Libertarian
administration would abolish these items, while
eliminating income taxes altogether for low in
come groups and cutting taxes in half for others,
moves that would cut the budget by $180 billion
(and balance it) and pump new life into the econo
my.
Clark knows that the U.S. government cannot
be policeman for the world; it is far too complex
to control by force. He understands that the use of
military might around the world endangers our
security rather than enhancing it.
A Libertarian administration would withdraw
American troops from foreign commitments, and
open our borders to a free flow of people, goods
and ideas, pledging friendly relations with all
countries and intervention in none.
Clark is not alone in putting these radical pro
posals to the American people. The first new na
tionwide ballot-qualified party in 60 years, the
Libertarian Party has over 600 candidates run
ning for office in all 50 states. So a vote for Clark is
not a "one-shot" protest, it is a vote for an entire
movement that stands on principle for peace, lib
erty. personal responsibility, and respect for the
rights of individuals.
