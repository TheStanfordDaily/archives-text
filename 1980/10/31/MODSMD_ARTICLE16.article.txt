## Partisan politics and world war 
### 
In the course of the twentieth
century. America has partici
pated in four major wars: Viet
nam. Korea and the two world
wars. Each time the United
States entered a war in this cen
tury, a Democrat occupied the
White House.
That might, of course, be a
coincidence. The odds of such a
coincidence occurring solely as
the result of chance can be easi
ly calculated from elementary
probability theory: under the
most generous of assumptions,
the odds are 15 to one against
such a coincidence occurring
purely accidentally.
Even for a betting man. those
are pretty long odds. It would
seem wise to consider the possi
bility that the historical linkage
of Democratic presidents with
war may not be simply a chance
coincidence.
There are, in fact, several
reasons which may explain this
linkage.
Activist liberalism
First, Democratic presidents
in this century have generally
been activist liberals, that is,
persons who favor a strong and
active central government and
believe that government can
and should solve serious social
problems. It is only natural that
people with this activist view of

government who support gov
ernment's attempts to forcibly
impose its own solutions to
domestic social problems
should also generally favor the
U.S. government's forcibly
trying to put aright the affairs of
other nations and of the entire
world.
Arthur Schlesinger. the liber
al historian and long-time de
fender of liberalism, recently
commented in the New York
Times Magazine that "Once re
leased to deal with problems at
home, the activist impulse
tends to spill over into foreign
affairs. . . . There is a disturb
ing tendency for the United
States to get involved in war
during activist times."
In short, foreign policy ac
tivism and adventurism, which
inevitably eventuate in war. are
a natural and logical extension
of domestic activist liberalism.
Rhetoric of peace
Second, the Democratic fond
ness for the rhetoric of peace
combined with the fact that
most peace activists view them
selves as Democrats makes it
easier for a Democratic presi
dent to push the country into
war: the natural opposition to
war is effectively disarmed, and
there is a popular feeling that if
even a supposedly peace-loving.

anti-militarist Democrat favors
war. then war must be neces
sary.
Recall that Lyndon Johnson.
Woodrow Wilson, and FDR all
ran on a pro-peace, he-will
keep-us-out-of-war platform.
Finally, war is generally an
excellent means for expanding
the power of the state and secur
ing the political positions of
those currently in power, re
sults generally desired by in
cumbent Democrats.
In light of the historical re
cord of Democratic presidents,
Jimmy Carter's moves towards
military mobilization, draft
registration, the Carter Doc
trine establishing an American
protectorate over the Persian
Gulf region, increased military
spending, etc., should be no sur
prise.
Record of war
No Democratic president in
this century has started a war
during his first term, but every
single Democratic president in
this century who has served
more than one term has even
tually involved the country in
war. Both on the basis of
Carter's current policies and on
the basis of the historical re
cord. one must fear that if
Carter is reelected this country
may well become involved in a

major war.
Of course, Carter's two Re
publican opponents are hardly
much better. Reagan's bark on
foreign policy is worse than his
bite â€” for example, he opposed
the Carter Doctrine and draft
registration; yet, his views are
still disturbing. And while An
derson's rhetoric may be more
pacific, his concrete positions
may be even more militaristic
than Carter's or Reagan's: he
strongly supported the draft
during Vietnam; last fall during
the phony crisis over the Soviet
brigade in Cuba, he denounced
Carter for being too dovish, for
"ignominiously backing down"
before the Soviets; he favors in
creased military aid to the Paki
stani dictatorship and an in
creased U.S. naval presence in
the Persian Gulf. etc.
If you can't stomach Reagan
or Anderson, there are for
tunately, other alternatives:
Libertarian Ed Clark, socialist
Barry Commoner, etc.
But if you're considering vot
ing for Jimmy Carter, consider
again the historical record of
Democratic presidents. For
anyone who desires peace, to
vote for a second term for
Carter is to place a very bad bet.
