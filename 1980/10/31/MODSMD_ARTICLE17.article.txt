## Dave Kisker Side stream smoke the real issue

In all the uproar surrounding
the presidential election, many
Californians are unaware that
they have a chance to vote on an
issue that in many ways may
have a direct effect upon their
well-being. On November 4. Cal
ifornia voters have another
chance to show the big Eastern
tobacco companies that in this
state, there is strong support for
clean, smoke-free air.
In 1978, the tobacco com
panies successfully purchased
the defeat of proposition 5, the
Clean Indoor Air Act. bv confus
ing the issue before the voters in
a slick Madison Avenue ad
vertising campaign. They sup
plied over 99 percent of the $6.5
million spent by the opponents
— a California campaign record
— while only 0.5 percent came
from Californians.
The proponents of proposition
5. on the other hand, supported
almost entirely by individual
Californians. were able to raise
only $0 6 million, yet still re
ceived 46 percent of the vote, in
dicating the widespread support
that the measure actually had.
Since 1978, however, several
things have changed. First, the
possibly over-restrictive propo
sition 5 has been replaced by the
more flexible and fair proposi
tion 10, the Smoking and No
Smoking Section Initiative. At
the same time, however, the
tobacco companies have be
come "even sneakier" in their
manipulation of public opinion.
However, the most important
change is the state ot
knowledge about the real issue
of the election, second hand
tobacco smoke.
In 1978. it was known that sec
ond-hand smoke was an an
noyance to non-smokers and
there were suspicions of health
hazards associated with it.

However, the argument was
mainly one of smokers' right to
smoke versus non-smokers'
right to breath clean air Now,
however, the issue is different.
This spring, Drs. James
White and Herman Froeb at UC-
San Diego, reported the results
of a study which clearly showed
that' 'chronic exposure to tobac
co smoke ... is deleterious to
the non-smoker and significant
ly reduces the small airways
function of the lungs."
In addition, another article by
James Repace of the Environ
mental Protection Agency and
Alfred Lowrey of the Naval Re
search Lab concludes that a
nonsmoker working in a typical
office with a smoker inhales the
equivalent of about five
cigarettes per day, even though
he doesn't smoke himself. At
this point, the argument has
moved to consideration of
whether smokers should have a

right to impose their health
damaging habit upon those who
have specifically chosen to
avoid it. No longer is it a matter
of a smoker harming only
himself, when he smokes in pub
lic.
Because of this new aware
ness, the need for legislation to
provide non-smokers with a
healthy environment to work
and carry out everyday tasks in
public has become obvious, just
as in the case of other forms of
pollution. This legislation is pro
vided in proposition 10.
Despite the inaccurate
rhetoric being dispensed over
the airways by the tobacco in
dustry in recent weeks, proposi
tion 10 will not cost millions of
dollars, put some people out of
jobs, and others out of business.
It simply provides that "smok
ing and no smoking sections
shall be established in every
enclosed public place, place of

employment, educational facil
ity. health care facility and
clinic."
It places no limits in private
residences or outdoor areas
There is no requirement for
walls or other barriers to be
placed, and only in extremely
small spaces, such as elevators
would smoking be entirely pro
hibited.
The tobacco industry is
spending immense amounts of
money to defeat proposition 10.
because they fear the implica
tions involved in surrounding
hooked smokers with non-smok
ing sections. It is hoped in this
case, however, that Californi
ans will see through these at
tempts by big. out-of-state in
dustries to manipulate another
election. Vote yes on proposi
tion 10.
