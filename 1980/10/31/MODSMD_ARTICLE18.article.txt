## The
						watchdog candidate 
### 
Bill Evers, Libertarian can
didate for Congress in the 12th
district, is running a vigorous,
professional campaign,
challenging long-time incum
bent Pete McCloskey. Evers is
out there meeting the voters and
talking about the issues.
A vote for McCloskey is only
an encouragement to him to run
for higher office. McCloskey's
desire to sit in the U.S. Senate
has led him to embrace Ronald
Reagan — whom he has opposed
throughout his political life. But
a vote for Evers can deliver an
important political message.
First, a vote for Evers is a
vote against the draft. Evers
has been an articulate and out
spoken critic of the draft for
many years. He is a master of
the facts and figures on this is
sue.
Youth service bill
McCloskey's compulsory
youth service draft would give
presidents a blank check to
raise troops and meddle abroad.
It would also reduce the pay of
first-termers in the military to
$192 per month (below the pov
erty line), treat young people
like wards of the federal govern
ment. and destroy the independ
ence of our charitable institu

tions by subjecting them to ex
tensive federal control.
Second, a vote for Evers is a
way to protest McCloskey's pro
posal to require that every
American worker carry a feder
al identity card. The American
Civil Liberties Union correctly
opposes any law requiring such
I D. cards because the govern
ment may well use them some
day to regiment and control the
population, as has been done
with Russia's and South
Africa's pass laws.
Third, a vote for Evers is a
protest against McCloskey's
votes in Congress for continued
funding of the MX missile. This
missile system is inordinately
expensive, internationally
destabilizing and will intrude
upon the land rights and water
rights of those who live in the
midwestern and mountain
states.
In contrast. Evers has pro
posed that the United States re
tire its increasingly vulnerable
land-based missiles in return
for the Soviet Union's retiring
its sea-launched missiles or
some other substantial Soviet
cutback. This would reduce
armaments in a way that would

save money and be advan
tageous to both sides.
Political watchdog

Fourth, a vote for Evers will
help put a valuable watchdog
into the political arena. He and
other Libertarians are com
mitted to a peaceful foreign pol
icy and to the Bill of Rights. At
the same time, they support a
deregulated economy — so they
could never be dismissed by a
Reagan administration as knee
jerk liberal critics. A vote for
Evers, therefore, will give him
and other Libertarians the polit
ical stature to keep Reagan
honest and to speak out effec
tively on foreign policy and civil
liberties,
This is realistically possible.
The current issue of the Wash
ington-based Congressional
Quarterly says that "(Demo
crat Kirsten) Olsen is not ex
pected to do any better this year
than she did two years ago. In
fact, some predict that the Lib
ertarian. Evers, who is a savvy
politico and is campaigning ac
tively, might outpoll the Demo
crat." Make your vote count and
vote Bill Evers for Congress.
