War of the sexes
Gail Stein's article ("Treat
sexes equally on draft," Daily,
Oct. 24) echoes the ill-con
sidered sentiment of many Stan
ford liberals that, although reg
istration and the draft are
wrong, if they are necessary
then women as well as men
should be called. She goes on to
state that women, in accepting
conscription, show their will
ingness to accept society's re
sponsibilities as well as its re
wards.
There are three major flaws
in Stein's argument. The first
lies in her use of the word "nec
essary." If one is in opposition
to the concept of forcing citizens
to join the army then there can
be no circumstance in which a
draft is necessary. The question
of equality of the sexes is irrele
vant in the context of involun
tary servitude.
Her second flaw is in assum
ing that it is "only fair" that
women serve in the military if
men must. The military, she
seems to forget, is an environ
ment created neither by nor for
women.
In addition to differences in
the socialization of men and
women there are real physical
differences not considered in
her argument. There exists a
certain lack of sensitivity in
placing a woman in the front
lines with the sure knowledge
that if she is captured she will be
raped.
Women serving alongside
men in such a situation will only
serve to perpetuate a social sys
tem in which men can oppress
women because of the nature of
their physical differences. The
military, such as it is, is no hu
mane place for gentle people of
either sex.
The third problem lies in the
belief that serving in the mili
tary would show women's will
ingness to share the responsi
bilities of society. Genocide
upon command is no sign of re
sponsibility, much more of blind
subservience. Women should in

deed be represented much more
strongly in the fields of foreign
policy and military decision
making as well as international
relations but their value as can
non fodder is more or less negli
gible.
In addition to this problem,
we resent the implication that
women have not yet taken a
share of society's responsi
bilities. Women's roies in male
dominated society have differed
in unmistakable ways from
men's, but their contributions
have certainly been no less es

sential.
The issue of registration and
the draft addressed in Stein's
article deserves our concern but
it seems necessary for citizens
to consider carefuily the nature
of equality in the context of our
present society and to avoid
hastily drawn conclusions based
on an equality in social struc
ture which does not really exist.
