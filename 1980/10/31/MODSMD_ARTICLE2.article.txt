# Commoner slams corporate control
## 
### Bradley Crystal 
Calling the presidential campaign a
"political disgrace," Citizens Party
presidential candidate Barry Com
moner last night charged that "corpo
rations have killed the vitality of the
Democratic and Republican parties."
"Four years ago people were
apathetic; today they are disgusted,"
said Commoner before a packed
crowd at Bishop Auditorium.
According to Commoner, who is
currently on the ballot in more than 30
states representing 70 percent of the
potential vote, "there is no politics in
the United States because the two
parties are incapable of attracting the
issues of most voters."
Commoner defended his con
troversial use of the word "bullshit"
in a radio commercial aired two
weeks ago.
In the commercial Commoner said
"Carter. Reagan , Anderson — it's all
bullshit."
The dictionary defines bullshit as
"foolish, uninformed and exaggerated
talk" said Commoner, adding that's
exactly what the major candidates
have been dishing out.
As an example of "foolish talk."
Commoner cited Ronald Reagan's
statements concerning pollution
"First Reagan tells us air pollution
is cured and then he tells us its caused
by trees." he said
As another example, Commoner
cited the stands on inflation and de
fense taken by both Reagan and Presi
dent Jimmy Carter.
"Both major candidates propose an
end to inflation and both support in
creased military expenditure" yet it
is a "solid" fact, according to Com
moner, that a large military budget is
inflationary."
As an example of "exaggerated"
talk Commoner cited "(Rep. John)
Anderson's claim that he's going to
win."
Commoner's harshest criticism
was reserved for Reagan, whom he
called "the darling of the extreme
right wing, the Ku Klux Klan, Texas
oil millionaires and religious fanat
ics."

But fear of Reagan, said Com
moner, is not a sufficient reason to
vote for Carter
"Carter is a weak reed in fighting
fascism We need a progressive "
Commoner said his goal is to identi
fy issues which the major parties have
shirked
"This campaign is a political lesson
to the American people who are beset
with terrible probl^m c 'such as infla
tion. racial and sex discirmination,
the rise of the American Nazi Party
and resurgence of ihe Ku Klux Klan,
he said
But the greatest obstacle to Ameri
can well-being stems from undue cor
porate control, said Commoner
"This country is not being run in the
interests of the peopie No one asked
when we started importing oil what it
would do to the country No one asked
what would happen when Detroit
started producing gas guzzling, smog
producing automobiles We must
break the grip of the corporations in
this country." he said.
"What the Citizens Party is calling
for is economic democracy. A de
cision that affects the people of the
country ought to be made by the peo
ple of the country."
Among the programs Commoner
said he would seek to enact as presi
dent are:
— revitalization of railroads;
— drastic cuts in the military
budget;
— unilateral publication of nuclear
weapons information with the ul
timate goal of disarmament
Commoner expressed dismay with
what he sees as American military ad
venturism.
"The Vietnam War had nothing to
do with the defense of the United
States." he said. "The outcome of our
military power has been the intrusion
into the internal affairs of other coun
tries."
This intrusion, said Commoner, was
manifest when the the United States
installed the Shah of Iran 30 years ago.
"People ask why the students took
Americans hostage It wasn't a
springtime frolic or some patriotic
way to get an incomplete. They were
angrv at our intrusion, " he said.
Commoner said the Citizens Party
should be given credit for recently
helping to unfreeze negotiations with
Iran over the hostage issue.
"I wrote Secretary of State (Ed
mund) Muskie that we should release
publicly the documents that show our
intervention in Iran It is now pos
sible that the decision to release the
hostages will be made in the next few
davs."

creased military expenditure" yet it
is a "solid" fact, according to Com
moner, that a large military budget is
inflationary."
As an example of "exaggerated"
talk Commoner cited "(Rep. John)
Anderson's claim that he's going to
win."
Commoner's harshest criticism
was reserved for Reagan, whom he
called "the darling of the extreme
right wing, the Ku Klux Klan, Texas
oil millionaires and religious fanat
ics."

But fear of Reagan, said Com
moner, is not a sufficient reason to
vote for Carter
"Carter is a weak reed in fighting
fascism We need a progressive "
Commoner said his goal is to identi
fy issues which the major parties have
shirked
"This campaign is a political lesson
to the American people who are beset
with terrible probl^m c 'such as infla
tion. racial and sex discirmination,
the rise of the American Nazi Party
and resurgence of ihe Ku Klux Klan,
he said
But the greatest obstacle to Ameri
can well-being stems from undue cor
porate control, said Commoner
"This country is not being run in the
interests of the peopie No one asked
when we started importing oil what it
would do to the country No one asked
what would happen when Detroit
started producing gas guzzling, smog
producing automobiles We must
break the grip of the corporations in
this country." he said.
"What the Citizens Party is calling
for is economic democracy. A de
cision that affects the people of the
country ought to be made by the peo
ple of the country."
Among the programs Commoner
said he would seek to enact as presi
dent are:
— revitalization of railroads;
— drastic cuts in the military
budget;
— unilateral publication of nuclear
weapons information with the ul
timate goal of disarmament
Commoner expressed dismay with
what he sees as American military ad
venturism.
"The Vietnam War had nothing to
do with the defense of the United
States." he said. "The outcome of our
military power has been the intrusion
into the internal affairs of other coun
tries."
This intrusion, said Commoner, was
manifest when the the United States
installed the Shah of Iran 30 years ago.
"People ask why the students took
Americans hostage It wasn't a
springtime frolic or some patriotic
way to get an incomplete. They were
angrv at our intrusion, " he said.
Commoner said the Citizens Party
should be given credit for recently
helping to unfreeze negotiations with
Iran over the hostage issue.
"I wrote Secretary of State (Ed
mund) Muskie that we should release
publicly the documents that show our
intervention in Iran It is now pos
sible that the decision to release the
hostages will be made in the next few
davs."

Citizens Party cas didate Barry Commoner addressed a crowd of more than jOO
at Bishop Auditorium last night. Commoner urged that Americans be given
greater control over corporations.
Calling the presidential campaign a
"political disgrace," Citizens Party
presidential candidate Barry Com
moner last night charged that "corpo
rations have killed the vitality of the
Democratic and Republican parties."
"Four years ago people were
apathetic; today they are disgusted,"
said Commoner before a packed
crowd at Bishop Auditorium.
According to Commoner, who is
currently on the ballot in more than 30
states representing 70 percent of the
potential vote, "there is no politics in
the United States because the two
parties are incapable of attracting the
issues of most voters."
Commoner defended his con
troversial use of the word "bullshit"
in a radio commercial aired two
weeks ago.
In the commercial Commoner said
"Carter. Reagan , Anderson — it's all
bullshit."
The dictionary defines bullshit as
"foolish, uninformed and exaggerated
talk" said Commoner, adding that's
exactly what the major candidates
have been dishing out.
As an example of "foolish talk."
Commoner cited Ronald Reagan's
statements concerning pollution
"First Reagan tells us air pollution
is cured and then he tells us its caused
by trees." he said
As another example, Commoner
cited the stands on inflation and de
fense taken by both Reagan and Presi
dent Jimmy Carter.
"Both major candidates propose an
end to inflation and both support in
creased military expenditure" yet it
is a "solid" fact, according to Com
moner, that a large military budget is
inflationary."
As an example of "exaggerated"
talk Commoner cited "(Rep. John)
Anderson's claim that he's going to
