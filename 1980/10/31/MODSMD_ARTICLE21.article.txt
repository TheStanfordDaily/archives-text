## Churches deal in campaigns 
### 
New York (AP) â€” The "big guns" of the mainline churches have
denounced the so-called "Christian right" which has come on
strong in the current political campaigning.
"On theological and ethical grounds, we object to the list of issues
which the religious right has identified as the moral agenda facing
the nation," declared 15 leaders of major church bodies.
The institutional leaders are assailing what they term "partisan
politics" and a "disortion of the ministry" by the new surge of re
ligious conservatives into election issues.
Of itself, religiously motivated engagement with public affairs is
not a novelty in America, despite some caustic commentaries to the
contrary. For the historic churches, it's been part of the process for
a long time.
What's new is the entry into politics of a strand of evangelical
conservatives and allies from other wings of faith who in the past
have denounced "meddling in politics" and concentrated on person
al salvation.
Major churches criticize
But now that they've plunged into the public-issues arena, they're
getting blasts from officials in the major churches that have always
been active in it. That's the peculiar part of the turnabout.
It has made for some subtle, sometimes vague or qualified phras
ing in the criticisms.
Noticeably, critics almost invariably point out that they support
and have long defended Christian activity to implement biblical
principles in public life, and have regularly taken part in it.
They object not to the practice itself, but to the positions taken by
the conservative activist;; ;nd tactics used, 3uch as taking sides in
some cases on particular candidates and pinpointing certain issues
as morally decisive.
