# Senate hopeful speaks out
## 
### 
Sacramento (AP) â€” David Bergland is not the
type of politician who colors his positions in
shades of gray.
For example, he wants to sell off the national
parks, scrap penalties for prostitution and drug
use, abolish public schools and eliminate most
federal agencies.
Bergland is the Libertarian Party's national
chairman and its candidate for U.S. senator in
California, and to him the government that gov
erns least, governs best
When Bergland says least, he means least. If he
had his way, the federal government would run a
Defense Department and little else.
"We are consistent," the 45-year-old Orange
County attorney says of the Libertarians, who
hope to become the nation's third major party.
"We will always come out on thesideof maximiz
ing personal liberty and de-emphasizing govern
ment control."
He said in an interview that the federal govern
ment "should be limited to providing defense for
American citizens on American geography, and
possibly assisting state governments in returning
fugitives from justice.
"Criminal law and other substantive standards
of law should be a function of state government,"
he added.
Bergland would abolish public schools and such
federal regulatory agencies as the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration and the Federal Trade
Commission.

He supports "total deregulation of the econo
my," which translates into opposition to tariffs,
price controls, minimum wage laws, farm sub
sidies and loan guarantees for failing businesses.
"The United States government should not
compel U.S. citizens to subsidize the defense of
other countries," says Bergland, who calls
himself "the only peace candidate" in the race.
Bergland maintains that with enough explana
tion most people will agree with his positions most
of the time.
"I think it's pretty clear that the majority of
people, once they understand our positions and
how we arrive at them, find they are in support of
most positions," he says
People recognize, he says, that the freedom
they want "has to be purchased by giving freedom
to other people."
The Libertarian Party was formed in 1972 by 85
people in Denver. Its presidential candidate got
5000 votes that year and 174,000 in 1976. Ed Clark,
the party's 1978 nominee for California governor,
got 377,960 votes, or 4 percent. The party's mem
bership in California now is about 85,000.
Bergland, contending that voters are dis
satisfied with the two major parties, expects big
ger things for Libertarians in future elections.
"It will clearly be a major party," he contends.
"The 1980 elections will bring it into a place of
prominence where from here on out discussions
will be on Democrat, Republican and Liber
tarian."
