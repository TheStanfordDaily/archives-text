# Starting secondary returns for Stanford
## Cards try to trap pesky OSU

a s urne ior me Manioro per
formance of "The Mouse That
Roared," wherein a team that
normally takes no one seriously
believes a winless team to be
the second coming of the Cireen
Bay Packers. The rodent in
question is Oregon State, who
visits the Farm for a Pacific-10
Conference game tomorrow.
Where the Beavers are con
cerned, you see, Stanford
learned its lesson last season A
then-winless Oregon State, fired
up by the firing of coach Craig
Fertig five days previously, let
Stanford get ahead 24-7 before
roaring back to win 33-31
Never mind that they wonon
a fluke safety when Rick
Gervais caught a kickoff at the
two and downed it in the end
zone. Never mind that even that
lone victory was taken away
from the Beavers by the Pac-10
in the wake of Oregon State's
one-vear probation. Never mind
that this year Oregon State may
have dropped in quality since a
year ago
Never mind that Stanford
hosts USC a week from tomor
row. None of that matters to
those who were in Corvallis a

year ago They remember what
happened.
"They" does not include Paul
Wiggin But he has been told of
the frustration the loss caused.
"1 did not hear one word from
anyone until Tuesday." Wiggin
said. "(Offensive lineman)
Brian Holloway told me 'You
should of been there. You would
have been so frustrated there
would be fingernail marks all
over the building. You couldn't
believe that game — it was a dis
aster.'"
The game was a disaster for
Stanford's season. The high
flying Cards, 4-2-1 going into
Corvallis. wobbled to a 5-5-1 fin
ish. The loss clearly knocked the
wind out of Stanford.
So, believe it or not. Stanford
takes Oregon State seriously.
Wiggin noted that you can usual
ly tell if a team is taking an op
ponent lightly by how they prac
tice. He thinks the Cards have
been working hard this week.
"What you do during the
week, you will do Saturday,"
Wiggin said. "There's nothing
there to pick you up if you
haven't paid the price. That hap
pened to Oklahoma against us."
The only thing Oklahoma and

Oregon State have in common is
that they both lost to Texas.
First-year coach Joe Avezzano,
whom Oregon State plucked off
Johnny Majors' staff at Tennes
see. inherited a passel of prob
lems at Oregon State. Through
six games, the load has not
lightened.
The Beavers came close to
winning last week, when they
built a 21-10 lead over Long
Beach State, only to give up
three second-half touchdowns
and fall 31-21. The 21 points up
ped Oregon State's total for six
games to 57 points, or nine less
than Stanford scored last week.
Senior fullback Tony Rob
inson is Oregon State's biggest
weapon on offense. Even that is
a misnomer, for at 5-feet-9. 168
pounds. Robinson is probably
the smallest fullback in Division
I football. Though Long Beach
State held him to 25 yards, Rob
inson is averaging 98.5 yards per
game. With Oregon State run
ning a veer offense, he could
spell problems for the Stanford
defense.
Actually, there are not too
many teams who could not give
the Stanford defense fits. Wig
gin admits he is frustrated with

the defense everyone thought he
would revive, and has made
some more changes for tomor
row.
Kevin MacMillan, who suf
fered a hip pointer against Bos
ton College, will be back in the
lineup, thus reuniting the start
ing defensive secondary for the
first time in six games. How
ever. MacMillan traded with
Kevin Baird and now mans a
safety spot alongside Vaughn
Williams, with Baird on the cor
ner opposite Gervais.
Oregon State's defense has
not been embarrassed with the
regularity of the offense, but
they have their own set of prob
lems. For example, the starting
front line averages 216 pounds.
Stanford's starting defensive
line, not considered one of the
biggest in the conference, aver
ages 20 pounds per man more
Curtain time is 1 p.m. at Stan
ford Stadium.

Where the Beavers are con
cerned, you see, Stanford
learned its lesson last season A
then-winless Oregon State, fired
up by the firing of coach Craig
Fertig five days previously, let
Stanford get ahead 24-7 before
roaring back to win 33-31
Never mind that they wonon
a fluke safety when Rick
Gervais caught a kickoff at the
two and downed it in the end
zone. Never mind that even that
lone victory was taken away
from the Beavers by the Pac-10
in the wake of Oregon State's
one-vear probation. Never mind
that this year Oregon State may
have dropped in quality since a
year ago
Never mind that Stanford
hosts USC a week from tomor
row. None of that matters to
those who were in Corvallis a

year ago They remember what
happened.
"They" does not include Paul
Wiggin But he has been told of
the frustration the loss caused.
"1 did not hear one word from
anyone until Tuesday." Wiggin
said. "(Offensive lineman)
Brian Holloway told me 'You
should of been there. You would
have been so frustrated there
would be fingernail marks all
over the building. You couldn't
believe that game — it was a dis
aster.'"
The game was a disaster for
Stanford's season. The high
flying Cards, 4-2-1 going into
Corvallis. wobbled to a 5-5-1 fin
ish. The loss clearly knocked the
wind out of Stanford.
So, believe it or not. Stanford
takes Oregon State seriously.
Wiggin noted that you can usual
ly tell if a team is taking an op
ponent lightly by how they prac
tice. He thinks the Cards have
been working hard this week.
"What you do during the
week, you will do Saturday,"
Wiggin said. "There's nothing
there to pick you up if you
haven't paid the price. That hap
pened to Oklahoma against us."
The only thing Oklahoma and

Oregon State have in common is
that they both lost to Texas.
First-year coach Joe Avezzano,
whom Oregon State plucked off
Johnny Majors' staff at Tennes
see. inherited a passel of prob
lems at Oregon State. Through
six games, the load has not
lightened.
The Beavers came close to
winning last week, when they
built a 21-10 lead over Long
Beach State, only to give up
three second-half touchdowns
and fall 31-21. The 21 points up
ped Oregon State's total for six
games to 57 points, or nine less
than Stanford scored last week.
Senior fullback Tony Rob
inson is Oregon State's biggest
weapon on offense. Even that is
a misnomer, for at 5-feet-9. 168
pounds. Robinson is probably
the smallest fullback in Division
I football. Though Long Beach
State held him to 25 yards, Rob
inson is averaging 98.5 yards per
game. With Oregon State run
ning a veer offense, he could
spell problems for the Stanford
defense.
Actually, there are not too
many teams who could not give
the Stanford defense fits. Wig
gin admits he is frustrated with

the defense everyone thought he
would revive, and has made
some more changes for tomor
row.
Kevin MacMillan, who suf
fered a hip pointer against Bos
ton College, will be back in the
lineup, thus reuniting the start
ing defensive secondary for the
first time in six games. How
ever. MacMillan traded with
Kevin Baird and now mans a
safety spot alongside Vaughn
Williams, with Baird on the cor
ner opposite Gervais.
Oregon State's defense has
not been embarrassed with the
regularity of the offense, but
they have their own set of prob
lems. For example, the starting
front line averages 216 pounds.
Stanford's starting defensive
line, not considered one of the
biggest in the conference, aver
ages 20 pounds per man more
