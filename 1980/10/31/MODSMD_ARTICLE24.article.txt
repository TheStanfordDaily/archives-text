## Gervais remembers OSU and the nightmare safety 
### 
(Editor's note: Rick Gervais
has had a fine season. Stan
ford's defense has not. The 5-
foot-11, 185-pound senior from
Bend, Oregon nailed down a
starting position at defensive
back last year and has since
tipped, intercepted and tackled
himself to a solid niche in the
hearts of Stanford fans — a rare
feat for a Card defenseman
these days. Ironically, though,
one of his most memorable mo
ments was one of tragedy in a
game against Oregon State last
year. Late in that game at Cor
vallis. Rick caught a kickoff at
the 2-yard line over his shoul
der. The momentum of the play
carried him into the end zone
where he downed it. The referee
motioned for a safety which put
the Heavers on top to win a
game the experts figured would
be a Stanford route. In this Fri
day Interview with Mike Oneal,
Gervais talks about this year's
disappointing defense and his
feelings on the eve of his re
match with OSU.)
Daily: Does what happened to
you last year against Oregon
State make the game this year
especially bitter or make you re

vengeful?
Gervais: I figured you'd ask
that. No. I don't really think
about that much any more. It's
more in the perspective of
playing an Oregon school, and
sometimes that means a little

more to me. That was just kind
of a weird thing that happened
last year and it's over now. so I
don't really feel that this game
is a revenge type thing.
Daily: That was a big loss for

Stanford last year. /» the team
feeling like they want to beat
OSU especially badly tomor
row?
Gervais: It was a big loss — it
changed the whole complexion
of the season. I think the team
wants to win big. Everybody's
talking like they always do
about Stanford and how they
can't get up for the games
they're supposed to win, and
that keeps it fresh in every
body's mind that Oregon State
might not be having the best
season but they're better than
they were last year and look
what they did then. We were
kind of embarrassed last year
and I think we want to make this
a good game tomorrow.
Daily: What's wrong with the
Stanford defense?
Gervais: In different games
there have been different rea
sons. It's hard to say this is
going bad or this going bad.
There have been breakdowns in
different areas. In the last game
against Washington State,
almost all our problems were
breakdowns in assignments.
They were mental mistakes.
