## Gervais remembers OSU and the nightmare safety 
### 
(Editor's note: Rick Gervais
has had a fine season. Stan
ford's defense has not. The 5-
foot-11, 185-pound senior from
Bend, Oregon nailed down a
starting position at defensive
back last year and has since
tipped, intercepted and tackled
himself to a solid niche in the
hearts of Stanford fans — a rare
feat for a Card defenseman
these days. Ironically, though,
one of his most memorable mo
ments was one of tragedy in a
game against Oregon State last
year. Late in that game at Cor
vallis. Rick caught a kickoff at
the 2-yard line over his shoul
der. The momentum of the play
carried him into the end zone
where he downed it. The referee
motioned for a safety which put
the Heavers on top to win a
game the experts figured would
be a Stanford route. In this Fri
day Interview with Mike Oneal,
Gervais talks about this year's
disappointing defense and his
feelings on the eve of his re
match with OSU.)
Daily: Does what happened to
you last year against Oregon
State make the game this year
especially bitter or make you re

vengeful?
Gervais: I figured you'd ask
that. No. I don't really think
about that much any more. It's
more in the perspective of
playing an Oregon school, and
sometimes that means a little

more to me. That was just kind
of a weird thing that happened
last year and it's over now. so I
don't really feel that this game
is a revenge type thing.
Daily: That was a big loss for

Stanford last year. /» the team
feeling like they want to beat
OSU especially badly tomor
row?
Gervais: It was a big loss — it
changed the whole complexion
of the season. I think the team
wants to win big. Everybody's
talking like they always do
about Stanford and how they
can't get up for the games
they're supposed to win, and
that keeps it fresh in every
body's mind that Oregon State
might not be having the best
season but they're better than
they were last year and look
what they did then. We were
kind of embarrassed last year
and I think we want to make this
a good game tomorrow.
Daily: What's wrong with the
Stanford defense?
Gervais: In different games
there have been different rea
sons. It's hard to say this is
going bad or this going bad.
There have been breakdowns in
different areas. In the last game
against Washington State,
almost all our problems were
breakdowns in assignments.
They were mental mistakes.


Rick Gervais
People were hustling, people
were tmne to get to the ball and
trying to do well Its just a com
bination of not concentrating
and maybe having a younger or
inexperienced player in a posi
tion he's not used to playing.
Daily: Is it a matter of trying
too hard?
Gervais: I wouldn't say it was
really a matter of trying too
hard You have to be psyched
and ready to really fly around
within the scope of your assign
ment. You can't let going crazy
take effect over your job on the
field.
Daily: The run has hurt Stan
ford most drastically this year.

Is that a reflection on the play of
the defensive line mostly?
Gervais: You can look at every
position and find breakdowns.
For a guy to get downfield on a
big play, the line has messed up.
But for him to keep going, the
defensive backs have messed
up It was just isolated break
downs all over last week.
Daily: Ever since Oklahoma,
people have been criticizing
Stanford's defense. How does
that effect the defensive team?
Gervais: As a unit we feel pres
sure from outside. We get writ
ten up in the papers, alumni say
things, students say things.
We're kind of the brunt of a lot
of jokes on campus. You come

back to your dorm after a game
and people say What happened,
man?'
But we have to pull together
as a defense. It doesn't really ef
fect me that much. I know we
have some good players and I
have confidence. We just have
to keep believing that we can get
it together. I don't really think
it's getting us down or that it
hurts our confidence because a
lot of times people don't know
the whole situation. The at
mosphere has stayed pretty
positive, so I believe we'll just
keep trying to get better.
Daily: Is there a lot of pressure
from the Stanford community ?
Gervais: There's not really

pressure. But you talk to people
from around here and they just
flat out ask you 'What's hap
pened to the defense?" or What
happened on those long passes 9 '
They raise those questions.
Daily: V 'ou've had a great year
personally. Is it frustrating to
you when the defense as a whole
doesn 't play well?
Gervais: Sure it's frustrating
because I was excited when the
new coaches came in and I was
excited at the prospect of going
to a bowl. I really want to be
| part of a good defense—a de
fense that people talk about. I'd
like people to say. 'Sure Stan
ford's offense is good, but
they're defense is tough too.'
