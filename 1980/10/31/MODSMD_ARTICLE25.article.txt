# Game may be easy; practice isn't

### Sally Jenkins 
Relaxing weekends aren't
easy for the water polo team.
The Cardinals play UC-Davis, a
team they defeated at the Nor-
Cal tournament here 10-1.
tomorrow morning at deGuerre
Pool. One would think they
might sit back, take a deep
breath, and give a sigh of relief
that they don't have to face a na
tional championship contender
for the first time in two months.
Instead, they received the
hardest workout of the season

this past week.
Stanford coach Dante Det
tamanti expects few problems
with the game, and consequent
ly has used this week's practice
sessions to condition his team.

"The NCAAs are just four
weeks away, and we have some
tough games coming up," the
coach said. "We are going to
have to rest up for those games.

so we might lose a little condi
tioning. Because we aren't em
phasizing this game, we can get
in some good conditioning. We
can afford to be a little tired for
the game."
Dettamanti has also used the
time to re-arrange his lineup.
Tomorrow's game will be a kind
of test for this shuffling, which
is designed to improve the
Cards' effectiveness in 6-on-5
man advantages, situations in
which Stanford has been notice
ably weak this season.

Bill Taylor has performed so
well coming off the bench that
he has earned a starting posi
tion. Taylor will play in JameS
Bergeson s old spot, a position
requiring Taylor's kind of ball
handling ability and speed
Bergeson in turn has been
moved to the right-hand power
spot, where the Cards hope he
can capitalize on his scoring
In addition. Chris Kelsey
shifts to the outside, allowing
him more freedom in setting up
plays in the man-up situations.


Vaughn Williams (45) soars to block an extra-point attempt during Stanford's 27-24 loss to Washington
Williams will join the reunion of Stanford's season-opening secondary tomorrow against Oregon State,
