# Pumpkin picks Pac-10 prospects
## 
### 
Editors' note: first of all, we'd
like to recognize the achieve
ment of last week's Guest
Greek, the famed White Plaza
Fruit Vendor, who picked six
out of seven winners last Fri
day. We thought that since Mr.
Vendor did so well, we'd seek
another representative from the
fruit community to be today's
prognosticator. To our pleas
ure, we tracked down The Great
Pumpkin — that's right, Linus
Van Pelt's very own idol. The
Great Pumpkin took time out
from deciding which pumpkin
path he would grace with his
presence tonight to give us his
seedy thoughts on tomorrow's
full Pac-10 slate:

UCLA at Arizona: The
Bruins' Freeman McNeil, when
he gets going, rushes like a
stagecoach or a runaway car
riage. And in "Cinderella," a
carriage turns into a pumpkin at
the stroke of midnight. So I
guess that makes Freeman
McNeil a potentially distant rel
ative of mine. I'll pick his team.
Cal at USC: Ever notice how
USC head coach John Rob
inson's head looks like a pump
kin? You know, big and kind of
funnv-shaped. I'll take USC over
the Weenies, who ought to get
squashed.
ASU at Washington: I'll like
the team that's on probation —
in this case, the Sun Devils. Al

ter all, you've got to spread as
much evil around on Halloween
weekend as possible.
WSU at Oregon:Washington
State will win. no doubt. Why?
Because Samoa Samoa is the
WSU quarterback. Pumpkins,
you see, originated in the trop
ics (just check your En
cyclopedia Americana), and
Samoa is from a kind-of tropical
place, so that makes him part
pumpkin.
OSU at Stanford: Sorry,
Cardinal fans, but the Beavers
have two things going for them:
first, they're on probation, and
second, they've got great colors
— orange and black!
