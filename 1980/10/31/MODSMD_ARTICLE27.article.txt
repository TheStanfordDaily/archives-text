.Mart Led by freshman John
Flannerys live-under 66. the
best of the day.the Trojans fin
ished the first day at six-over
361, two shots ahead of Arizona
State and three up on Pacific
Arizona State's R o y
McMillin. the only subpar per

former to begin early in the
morning, sank a 45-foot eagle
putt on the par-5 first hole and
then played the last 17 holes
even par to finish at two-under
69 in second place
The big guns of the tour

the course once before the
NCAA Championships are held
here in May. stayed relatively
silent Oklahoma State, con
sidered the best team in the

der-par and eight shots off the
pace Oral Roberts is only five
shots behind at 366 in fourth
place, with Centenary in fifth at
368
The relatively high scoring
surprised Stanford coach David
Yates, the tournament director.
I thought for sure someone
would finish under par.'' Yates

said ol the 22 teams partici
pating Me attributed the high
scores to a collective tight col
lar There's a lot of pressure to
play well in a tournament like
this There are lots of teams
here vou want to beat
The coach of the team every
one wants to beat, Oklahoma
State's Mike Holder, disagreed
It's just another tournament
Sure you like to win. and you put
pressure on yourself to win. but
it's not the NCAA s by any
stretch of the imagination
One man who will agree this
is not the NCAAs is I'tah State
senior Jay Hon Blake, the defen
ding NCAA champion Blake,
pleading a case of "no con
fidence. played nowhere near
his NCAA title form, coming in
with a two-over 73. Blake has a
lot to say about pressure, like
the pressure of being the defend

ing champion
Blake said most of the pres
sure is from within i kind of
feel like everyone's watching
me hit a shot, and I'm hitting so
bad 1 haven't had a chance to
work on my game I've been
playing solid golf since Febru
ary. and I haven t had a chance
to work on my game It's hard to
work on the (driving> range for
one day and then come out here
and trust it."
