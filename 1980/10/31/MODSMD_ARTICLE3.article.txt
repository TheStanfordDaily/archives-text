# New requirements proposed
## Senate discusses languages 
### Kimberly Brown 
Only one fourth of Stanford under
graduates study a foreign language
during the course of their education
here and less than 30 percent of those
students continue into the second-year
level.
Carolyn Lougee, chairman of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US), revealed these statistics in an
informal report to the Faculty Senate
yesterday. She said declining en
rollments reflect deeper academic
problems within the University.
Calling the decreased influence on
the importance of languages "startl
ing" and "deplorable." senate mem
bers agreed the C-US should take ac
tion to reverse the trend.
Lougee cited two basic reasons why
the committee finds it so important to
stress foreign language. The first con

cerns "widening our horizons and
deepening our humanity," while the
second is of a more practical nature
and deals with "economic and politi
cal means necessary in conducting in
ternational diplomacy."
Lougee said several factors have
contributed to the situation. "We have
a general lack of value for language in
our American society," she said.
"And since language isn't mandatory
under the distribution requirements,
we have a definite lack of incentive
within the University as well."
During preliminary discussions the
committee came up with a number of
possible recommendations. However.
Lougee said there is a wide range of
opinion. The following suggestions are
still in the brainstorming stage .
- a language proficiency require
ment (separate from the distribution

requirements) before graduation.
- an admissions requirement that
entering students have two or three
years of language behind them.
- a revision within some majors re
quiring foreign language competence.
- a funding program for advanced
studies supporting translator and in
terpreter programs.
- a special language requirement for
students graduating with honors.
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
was skeptical about the possibility of
instituting a language admissions re
quirement "With over 26,000 high
schools in the country, it would be
very hard to monitor their quality," he
said "Many don't even offer lan
guages. Such a requirement may deny
a great number of people the chance to
apply to a first-rate university."
