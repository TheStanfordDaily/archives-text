Stanford's women's vol
leyball team, under the direc
tion of head coach Fred Sturm,
travels to Los Angeles for the
UCLA National Invitational
Tournament this weekend The
nation's top 24 teams will play in
this tournament.
According to Sturm. Stanford
faces the toughest pool of
teams. The 20th-seeded

Cardinals must play UC-Santa
Barbara and San Diego State —
both seeded in the tourney's top
five — Nebraska, NorCal Con
ference rival Fresno State and
Long Beach State, a long-stand
ing California volleyball power.
"The key will be our ability to
play well for five matches."
Sturm said. "We play three to
day and two on Saturday. It's
the conditioning and our depth

that will make the difference."
Stanford, now 20-8 overall and
5-1 in conference play after
Wednesday night's triumph
over San Jose State, needs a
winning effort in the NIT to
strengthen its case for a post
season bid. The Cards are now
second in the conference and
could gain a wild-card berth in
the regionals at the end of No
vember if their overall record is
impressive enough.
