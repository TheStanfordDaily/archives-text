French restaurants often at
tempt to appeal to the restau
rant goer with gimmicks. But
La Cigale, recently opened by
Chaiwat Tanphanich and Emon
Pearson, wishes only to make a
point about their food.
The building itself is a brick
and barnwood structure which
does not look like a restaurant.
In fact, we passed the barn
without thinking it might be La
Cigale. The interior, however,
combines the elegance of
candlelight and subdued red col
or in a rustic setting.
Both the low noise level and
the large booths with flickering
candles provide a perfect place
for intimate dining. La Cigale
desires to create a casual place
which does nothing casual with
its food.
Waitresses served us with
consideration and patience.
The prompt, first-rate ser
vice was a pleasant change from
the stereotype of condescending
French maitre d's.
The menu offerings were am
bitious and interesting. To begin
the dinner we tried the
quenelles de sole nantua ($3.25)
and Bisque a L'homard ($2.50).
The former consists of poached
fish dumplings which, with the
texture of mousse, were light
and airy. The sauce, a rich
creamy lobster flavor with an
accent of cognac, com
plemented the fish perfectly.
The sauce, a difficult one to
prepare, seemed a little light
but had'the right combination of
lobster flavored with garlic,
cognac and tabasco.
Soup and salad are served
with the dinner. The soup,
cream of spinach, needed more
straining, but had exquisite
flavor. The salad was a high

light of the meal Chef Johnny's
buttermilk and mustard dress
ing, swimming with garlic, was
superb.
For the main course we chose
carre d' angeau persille ($l3), a
rack of lamb marinated with
herbs, and lapin au vin de
bourgogne ($9.75), a rabbit
cooked in a red wine sauce. The
wine list was thorough, offering
both Napa Valley and imported
wines. The large portion of
juicy, tender lamb, was
enhanced by a thyme and basil
spicing. The meat had been
baked with a large coating of
breadcrumbs. A half rabbit.

glazed with the thick spicy
burgundy wine, was also a huge
portion The rabbit was served
with a strong sauce.
The cook adorned each dish
with broccoli and glazed car
rots.
For dessert we had Mont
Blanc, a mountain-shaped mer
ingue made with a lemon base
and basted with a creamy vanil
la sauce. It was light and fluffy,
giving the illusion that it is not
fattening. The coupe aux mar
rons, a chestnut whip served on
vanilla ice cream, was heavy,
rich and sugary.

The menu ranged from fresh
fish to sweetbreads to steak and
chicken sautes. The appetizers
and desserts went beyond tradi
tional fare. A couple could man
age on $25, but with wine and
non-restraint one is more likely
to spend close to $50. Reserva
tions are recommended.
For a good, ambitious French
meal in a casual romantic at
mosphere, La Cigale (the
Cricket) stands up well. Just be
careful not to whiz by a barn on
El Camino — it may be the meal
you've been waiting for.
