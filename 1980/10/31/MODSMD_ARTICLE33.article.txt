Captain Cosmo's
491 Lytton Ave.
Palo Alto
322-8222
The area is filled with submarine shops.
But eastern-style submarines (hoagies) and
cheese steaks are hard to find. Captain Cos
mo's sandwiches should ease easterners'
hoagie withdrawal symptoms and offer oth
ers an alternative to the standard sub.
Hot and cold Cosmo sandwiches include
steak, roast beef, cheese steak, Canadian
bacon and cheese. Cosmo's can be ordered
in regular size ($2.15 to $3.50) or 9- to 10-inch
super size ($3.15 to $4.45). Subs are avail
able on white, wheat, light rye, dark rye and
soft French rolls.
Captain Cosmo's also offers hot dogs for
the less adventuresome and pizza burgers
for the submarine gourmet. We fell some
where in between and ordered the Captain
Cosmo special and a hot garden cheese Cos
mo.
The regular size Captain Cosmo ($3.50),
about six inches long and cut in half, was
filled with shredded top sirloin, provolone,
grilled onions, lettuce and tomatoes. Like
all hot cosmos, it took about 10 to 15 minutes
to prepare.
The garden cosmo ($2.35), also a manage

able size, contained the two cheeses of my
choice (jack and cheddar), the same fresh
vegetables and the captain's special sauce.
"The sauce is the essence of the Captain
Cosmo," said the captain. And he puts more
than enough sauce on each sandwich.
A cantaloupe wedge and several hot pep
pers garnished our sub baskets. The cap
tain, who appropriately sports a beard and
sailor hat, said he hand-picks all the vegeta
bles and fruits.
For ambitious, hearty eaters, the captain
also offers soups in fall and winter; spinach,
chef and potato salads; and carrot and choc
olate cakes. Desserts are made by Edible
Express in San Francisco.
The large beer selection is another spe
cialty at Captain Cosmo's. Beers include
Heineken, Beck's, Molson Golden, Coors,
Lowenbrau, Miller's and Bud's. Beer is reg
ularly $.85 and imported is $1.25. Other
beverages include fruit juices, soft drinks,
mineral water and wine.
In the submarine shop tradition, Captain
Cosmo's is a casual establishment. Most of
the business is take-out and orders can be
phoned in advance. About 30 people can be
seated at the inside picnic tables, but the
captain plans to expand the facilities next
year.

The decor is simple but appropriate for
the relaxed atmosphere. Wooden beer pla
ques decorate the wall. And on our visit,
jazz piped quietly in the background.
In addition to offering a 10 percent dis
count to students buying 10 sandwiches or
more, the captain also gets customers to be
members of his super sub club. Club mem
bers get their thirteenth sub free.
The sub shop is open Monday to Friday
from 11 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday from
11 a.m. to 3 p.m. But the captain stays until 5
p.m. when the University has a football
game.
Captain Cosmo's will prepare mass quan
tities of submarines for tailgaters. "One
sorority has already done it," said the cap
tain He prepared cartons containing fruit,
potato chips and drinks. The captain said,
however, "very few at Stanford know about
Captain Cosmo's."
The captain himself has owned the shop
for a year. The original owners, from the
East Coast, "couldn't find a place to get a
good, decent sandwich," he said. They
opened Captain Cosmo's as a solution to
their problem.
So for a sub that is not "sub"-par, ride
your bike one block off University Ave. to
the captain's and let your teeth sink right in!
