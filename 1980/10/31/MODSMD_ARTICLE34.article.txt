The delightful Greek
cuisine is only part of what
you will experience at
Balkan Village. The lively
and friendly atmosphere of a
Greek "taverna" has been
successfully recreated by
the owners. Louie and Peggy
Gundunas The emphasis at
Balkan Village is not just on
assuring that the customer is
pleasantly stuffed but. in the
European tradition, making
sure he is also fully enter
tained.
The odd assortment of pic
tures and knick-knacks on
the wall and the tent-like
ceiling make for a somewhat
gaudy but comfortable set
ting. The tables are centered
around the dance floor where
a band composed of a
boucoukia (a Greek man
dolin) player, drummer and
organist play dinner music
until about 8:30 p.m
Service was excellent, and
our waiter enthusiastically
explained how each dish was
prepared.
For an appetizer we had
the flaming saganaki cheese
which turned out to be an ex
cellent choice. Kasseri
cheese is covered with light
ly fried flour. It is then
flambed in rum and doused
with lemon juice.
Dinners range from $8.50
to $12.95 and include soup or
salad, coffee and dessert.
The primarily Greek dishes
include everything from
mousaka (baked meat with
eggplant) to dolmades (meat
wrapped in grape leaves >
My entree choice, the

chef's special ($11.95), in
cluded shishkebab. keftethes
(Athenian meatballs),
spanakotiropita (spinach
pastry* and dolmades. All
entrees were served with
rice pilaf and a vegetable.
The portions of meat were
disappointingly small but
quite good The dolmades. a
well-seasoned meat mixture
wrapped in grape leaves,
were particularly savory.
Although we were both
fairly stuffed at this point,
we managed to find room for
the scrumptious baklava, a
light pastry filled with
chopped nuts and saturated
in honey.
As we comfortably settled
back to savor a cup of thick
Turkish coffee, the enter
tainment began. A tantaliz
ing hour of belly dancing was
followed by Louie, the
owner, singing a variety of
Greek and American songs.
We enjoyed Louie's singing
but were baffled because the
waiter was clearing our table
off completely. Before we
knew what was happening
Louie had our table tightly
clenched in his teeth and was
swinging it wildly around the
dance floor. He then picked
up the table across from us,
set it atop ours, and amazing
ly whirled both around.
We figured things would
calm down but we found
ourselves being coaxed onto
the dance floor. As we faked
a Greek dance the rest of the
people in the restaurant
gradually joined us. The
highlight of the evening
came when Louie led us out
the front door and we danced
our way down El Camino
Real.
