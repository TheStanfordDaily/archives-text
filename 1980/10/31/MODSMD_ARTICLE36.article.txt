"I wouldn't compromise,"
boasted restaurant-owner
Michael Del Monaco with an
Italian arm wave and a twinkle
in his eyes, and his pride is com
pletely justified. His showpiece,
"Anthony's Pier 9 is incom
parable in both atmosphere and
cuisine.
Del Monaco spent three years
planning Anthony's, and his
care and creativity were not
limited to the obvious. From the
outside, Anthony's resembles a
pier. A moat of water surrounds
the brown shingled building.
Once you leave the dock and
pass through the door, you are in
a comfortable and luxurious
boat.
The Captain's Bar is im
aginative, yet not overdone. The
decor allows you to really feel
as if you could be in a ship's
lounge rather than on a Dis
neyland ride. Dark wood walls

are decorated with paintings of
historic vessels, and a line of
window panes, some of which
are illuminated, give the ap
pearance of an actual captain's
cabin above.
A large aquarium in the
room's center is filled with trop-

ical fish from Hawaii and the
Bahamas. "Everyone has a fire
place," explained Del Monaco,
"but an aquarium is alive. It's
relaxing; I'm fascinated by it.
No matter where you sit every
one has a good seat."
We began our meal with an
appetizer of Deep Fried
Calamari for two ($6.95). Cook
ing squid is a delicate process; it
can not be even slightly over-

cooked or it becomes too tough
Anthony's succeeds in serving
calamari that is still tender; it
is breaded lightly in garlic, but
ter and bread crumbs. Other
available appetizers include
Blue Point Oysters ($4 25),
Scampi Saute Bordelaise for
two ($4.95) and Escargots A La
Bourgignone ($4.50).
My green salad with house
dressing, included with my en
tree, was justifiably advertised
as special. A distinctive blend of
whole eggs, olive oil. red wine,
vinegar and 10 spices, the dress
ing was a creamy Italian that
was not too strong yet still
flavorful.
From Anthony's large assort
ment of fish entrees (which in
cludes broiled lobster tail, Alas
kan king crab legs, cioppino alia
Anthony's and broiled fillet of
salmon) we chose the Abalone
steak. Abalone is a difficult fish
to prepare, yet Anthony's suc
ceeded expertly. The flavorful
steak was dipped in egg and
flour, then grilled so that the
batter was not too thick. The
size of the portion was also im
pressive. "You can't find an
abalone portion this big any
where else," claimed Del Mona
co. A large portion of tasty al
dente fresh green beans gar
nished with sliced almonds ac
companied the steak.
We thought we were too full
for dessert until we spotted the
chocolate mousse being carried
by an operetta of Italian birth
day singers. We were rewarded
by the rich, not too sweet choco
late flavor of the treat. Other
desserts include mud pie,
cheesecake, caramel custard
and strawberry jubilee.
We received a grand tour af
ter our meal. Del Monaco's
pride is infectious, for everyone
appeared to have their own busi
ness card. "I'm proud to bring
customers back," said Del Mon
aco.
To satiate your appetite for a
week in a perfectionist setting,
take a trip to Anthony's Pier 9 in
Cupertino.
