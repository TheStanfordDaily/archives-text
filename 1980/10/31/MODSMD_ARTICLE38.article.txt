## Proving nothing, with style 
### Fred Cheever 
Noel Coward's Hay Fever is
nothing new to anyone who has
lived in the Bay Area through
more than one American Con
servatory Theatre season. ACT
has been doing Hay Fever regu
larly for quite a while. And with
reason. It is a good play. Coward
considered it his best comedy
and that says a great deal.
An eccentric English family
invites an assortment of less ec
centric acquaintances down to
the country house for a week
end. If it sounds familiar, it
should. This formula was run
ragged by English dramatists in
the late i9th and early 20th cen
turies. Other good examples of
the type are Shaw's Heartbreak
House and Saki's The Watched
Pot.
Hay Fever has a number of
things to recommend it over
general run-of-the-drawing
room comedies. First, it is ex
ceptionally funny. Enough has
been said over the past 60 years
about Coward's "rapier-like
wit" and "glittering repartee."
Yet, a reference can hardly be
omitted. It is Coward's wit that
gives the play its entertainment
value in a world where country
weekends have gone out of style.
As television-bred Americans
it is hard for us to imagine any
thing being consistently funny
without relying on sex or cur
rent events. Coward manages
brilliantly.
Second, and less frequently
mentioned, is Hay Fever's sim
plicity. It may seem odd to talk
about simplicity in a play which
consists almost entirely of con
fused romantic entanglements.
Yet, simplicity is near the heart
of Hay Fever's charm. While the
characters are often befuddled,
the audience has no trouble sort
ing them out. There is no ex
traneous dialogue and no unnec

essary action. Every dramatic
moment fits neatly into the
play's modest plot. Every line is
meant to get a laugh or set you
up for one that's on the way.
This controlled effort has its ad
vantages. Hay Fever is always
funny and at times surprising,
but never confusing.
Hay Fever is a high quality
standard and the ACT's prod
uction meets a high standard of
quality. The technical work is
superb. The acting is strong if
not always inspired. Special
mention should be made of Julia

Fletcher's exceptional per
formance as Sorel.
One question needs to be an
swered. Is Hay Fever worth
seeing" 7 The answer depends on
what sort of person you are.
If you want social value from
your art, then you will find Hay
Fever a disappointment. It has
absolutely no socially redeem
ing value. It is a petty domestic
farce, if a very good one. It
proves nothing and does so with
a great deal of style.
If you want revelation from
your art, then Hay Feoer is not
for you either. It is quite a shal

low play. The characters
portrayed rarely get deep
enough for even the most auto
matic empathy. They are sim
ply convenient vehicles for the
author's wit Though never bor
ing, Hay Fever is a play easily
forgotten a few minutes after
leaving the theater. It will not
change your life.
If, however, you are looking
for an entertaining evening, if
you like to be amused and you
admire stylish wit, then Hay
Fever may be just what you are
looking for.

turies. Other good examples of
the type are Shaw's Heartbreak
House and Saki's The Watched
Pot.
Hay Fever has a number of
things to recommend it over
general run-of-the-drawing
room comedies. First, it is ex
ceptionally funny. Enough has
been said over the past 60 years
about Coward's "rapier-like
wit" and "glittering repartee."
Yet, a reference can hardly be
omitted. It is Coward's wit that
gives the play its entertainment
value in a world where country
weekends have gone out of style.
As television-bred Americans
it is hard for us to imagine any
thing being consistently funny
without relying on sex or cur
rent events. Coward manages
brilliantly.
Second, and less frequently
mentioned, is Hay Fever's sim
plicity. It may seem odd to talk
about simplicity in a play which
consists almost entirely of con
fused romantic entanglements.
Yet, simplicity is near the heart
of Hay Fever's charm. While the
characters are often befuddled,
the audience has no trouble sort
ing them out. There is no ex
traneous dialogue and no unnec

essary action. Every dramatic
moment fits neatly into the
play's modest plot. Every line is
meant to get a laugh or set you
up for one that's on the way.
This controlled effort has its ad
vantages. Hay Fever is always
funny and at times surprising,
but never confusing.
Hay Fever is a high quality
standard and the ACT's prod
uction meets a high standard of
quality. The technical work is
superb. The acting is strong if
not always inspired. Special
mention should be made of Julia

Fletcher's exceptional per
formance as Sorel.
One question needs to be an
swered. Is Hay Fever worth
seeing" 7 The answer depends on
what sort of person you are.
If you want social value from
your art, then you will find Hay
Fever a disappointment. It has
absolutely no socially redeem
ing value. It is a petty domestic
farce, if a very good one. It
proves nothing and does so with
a great deal of style.
If you want revelation from
your art, then Hay Feoer is not
for you either. It is quite a shal

low play. The characters
portrayed rarely get deep
enough for even the most auto
matic empathy. They are sim
ply convenient vehicles for the
author's wit Though never bor
ing, Hay Fever is a play easily
forgotten a few minutes after
leaving the theater. It will not
change your life.
If, however, you are looking
for an entertaining evening, if
you like to be amused and you
admire stylish wit, then Hay
Fever may be just what you are
looking for.
