### Linda Sue Park 
OK, so 1 am from Chicago, and yes, I
proudly declare that I am a Cub fan. And it
was my idea to drag four other friends along
with me to The Bleacher Bums, currently
playing in San Francisco; three of whom
are not from Chicago and one a confessed
baseball-hater. But a quick poll at the end of
the performance showed that the play was a
hit with all five of us. and with the rest of the
audience as well.
Any attempt to involve the audience in the
on-stage action is a risky endeavor. Direc
tor Lee Sandowich has succeeded in The
Bleacher Bums; the ploys to engage the au
dience are amusing without being imposing.
PYom the vendor tossing free peanuts to
open the play, through the traditional sev
enth-inning stretch and on to the final out,
the audience can choose to be as rabid as the
Bums themselves, or to sit back and be less
actively entertained.

The cast of regulars, who appear twice
each night on Thursdays, Fridays and Satur
days, come up with consistently strong
characterizations; William Bonham as the
Cheerleader, and Nancy Fish and Abe
Kalish as a husband-and-wife duo turn in
particularly noteworthy performances. The
only weak spot was Paula Mitchell as Miss
Melody King, but even this performance im
proved throughout the evening to finish
strong: Mitchell should be given credit for
the final success of her treatment of this
cliched character.
Forget any pretense of baseball-as-life or
escapism at the ball park; the play's princi
pal message is humor. Seldom have I seen a
more attentive audience; it was all ears for
the well-timed punch lines, yet nothing was
ever lost in the (frequent) roar of the crowd.
Even the old jokes got their share of laughs,
thanks to strong interpretations by the cast.

The Bleacher Bums opened five weeks
ago at the New Zephyr Theatre in San Fran
cisco, where it has played to sell-out crowds
consistently. The management is consider
ing a move to the larger On-Broadway Thea
ter. but the 90-seat intimacy of the New
Zephyr works well with this production; all
the seats are as good as â€” well, as season
tickets right above the dugout.
Conceived by Joe Mantegna and written
by actual Bums themselves, the show was a
huge hit in Chicago bef ore moving on to play
for packed houses in New York and Los An
geles. It was also telecast nationally on
PBS, proving its universal appeal. If you are
a Chicago native or a baseball fan, this show
is a must-see: if you are neither and won't
understand what Lawrence of Oregano's or
double plays have to do with anything, go
anyway. The Bleacher Bums will someday
be a classic, in the most unpretentious sense
of the word.
