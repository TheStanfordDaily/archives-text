## Cranston, Gann, Bergland prepare for the election Cranston 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
"I feel that I have affected the outcome of some very important
issues," said Democrat Alan Cranston in support of his bid for
reelection to the U.S. Senate seat he has held for two terms.
As an example, Cranston said he has been a principal advocate
of the SALT treaty in the Senate and will continue to work to get it
ratified next year. He said he represents "peace through SALT II
and arms limitations."
Cranston said he believes the U.S. is stronger than the Soviet
Union, militarily and economically. Thus, he said, the Soviets will
be careful not to create a situation of tension.
Charlotte Perry, Cranston's San Francisco press secretary,
said the senator opposes registration for the draft as proposed by
President Jimmy Carter Rather, Cranston favors an alternate
plan in which everyone in the country would register by pro
fession, regardless of age.
Everyone would then be available to contact if the necessity
arose, and service would be based on skill. This would give people
more of a sense of purpose in their careers, and would not dis
criminate on the basis of age, according to Perry.
Perry also said Cranston is in favor of the Equal Rights Amend
ment and was instrumental in getting an extension of the ratifi
cation deadline through Congress.
In the energy field, Cranston said he believes safety and satis
factory waste disposal are necessities in the nuclear industry. He
does not favor expanding nuclear power without better safe
guards. Cranston has worked to get alternative energy measures
passed in Congress. He especially advocates solar energy, a popu
lar alternative in California.
Born in Palo Alto, Cranston received his B A. from Stanford in
1936. He was elected to the Senate in 1969. and has been Majority
Whip since 1977.
On a campaign stop at Stanford Tuesday, Cranston auto
graphed copies of Cranston, The Senator from California, a bio
graphy written by his sister, Eleanor Fowle. In an interview with
KZSU radio, he discussed his achievements in the Senate.
In addition to working for the ratification of SALT II, Cranston
said he played a key role in the ratification of the Panama Canal
treaty and in the decision-making that led to the normalization of
relations between the U.S. and the People's Republic of China.
Cranston said he strongly opposed the Vietnam war, and was
the initiator of the first Senate bill that cut aid to Vietnam.
Cranston said it was this elimination of aid that eventually led to
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
Cranston explained that his position as Senate Majority Whip
makes him the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate. His task
is to work with the Democratic leadership to try and secure votes
on issues requiring party unity, while also representing the needs
of California.
In dealing with Iran, Cranston said he believes the U.S. should
not make a deal with kidnappers to give them arms in return for
the hostages.
In domestic policy. Cranston advocates a cost of living increase
to social security recipients based on the cost of living index and
voted for a 14.3 percent benefit increase just this year.
A balanced budget and fiscal restraint in the federal govern
ment are also important objectives of the senator. A balanced
budget should be accomplished, according to Cranston, not by cut
ting services to the poor, but by cutting costs such as highway aid,
agricultural subsidies, water projects and state revenue sharing.
