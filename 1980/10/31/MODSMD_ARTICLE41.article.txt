# 'Power Lines' fail(s)

### Steve Nash 
The situations in life which
are most theatrical do not
always make good theater.
Power Lines at Theatre
Rhinoceros has taken a very ex
citing and theatrical idea and
transformed it into a rather un
imaginative play.
Power Lines, a comedy by
Joel Schwartz, consists of three
interrelated one-act plays:
Fabulous Opportunities, Bind
ing Issues and Power Failure.
The first two acts both involve
two characters, one dominant
and one submissive, and the
power roles reverse during the
scene. Fabulous Opportunities
involves a couple deciding
whether to go to a job interview
or to a disco, while Binding Is
sues involves the acting out of
an S/M scene with military ov
ertones. Power Failure has the
four characters trapped in a res
taurant freezer (three of the
four characters work at the res
taurant). Notice that here the
situation is dominant and the
characters submissive. The two
couples are saved by (what
else?) a power failure.
Although the power roles are
not underlined for the audience
during the first act, the whole
structure of the play becomes
obvious early on in the second.
At that point, all the double en
tendre* about power become
clear and the whole play be
comes very trite. It might have
been more interesting if the
power relationships had been

more ambiguous. But they are
generally very clear and do not
switch back and forth more than
once per act.
In spite of all the above.
Power Lines is a comedy. It is
set in a suburb of LA called El
Segundo (which seems to have
the same connotations as
"beautiful downtown Burbank"
did in the old Laugh-In shows). I
did not find the jokes all that
funny; many of them seemed
rather obvious. In addition, the
jokes don't lead anywhere — but
then, neither does much else in
this play. The running joke
(mentioning El Segundo)
stopped working for me very
early on.
I did enjoy Binding Issues.
For much of the scene the au
dience is not aware that the two
men are acting out an S/M fan
tasy. The humor as they gradu
ally emerge from the fantasy
and change in character is very
effective. More than any other,
this scene hints at the blurriness
I mentioned above. Maybe,
though. I enjoyed this scene the
most because Lenny (Allan
Herman) was in it.and Meg
(Virginia Lombard) was not.
Allan Herman is marvelous. I
think that he would still be
marvelous if all you could see of
him was his eyes. He uses them
with great imagination in the
very small theater to enliven
many situations. He also works
very hard to add some depth to a
character which is not very well
established in the script.

The two women in the play do
not have nearly the range of the
men. Their parts do not allow
for as much variation as the
male parts do. but I do not see
this as an excuse for one
dimensional performances such
as these. For Chris (Priscilla
Huddleston > this is not too much
of a problem since her charac
ter is quite reserved and does
not stand out on stage.
Meg, on the other hand, is
played as a heavily-built, loud
mouthed New Yorker. (Couldn't
we have a loud-mouthed North
Dakotan for a change?) That
might work in a large hall, with
the audience 20 feet away and a
fairly large stage. But Theater
Rhinoceros is very intimate,
and in this setting Lombard's
acting is grotesque.
The fascination of power rela
tionships is their ambiguity and
complexity. They are interest
ing because they are confusing
To simplify and sharply define
these relationships may clarify
them, but it also makes them
boring. Theater Rhinoceros at
tracts something considerably
more sophisticated than a TV
audience. It doesn't need to
have everything explained.

sues involves the acting out of
an S/M scene with military ov
ertones. Power Failure has the
four characters trapped in a res
taurant freezer (three of the
four characters work at the res
taurant). Notice that here the
situation is dominant and the
characters submissive. The two
couples are saved by (what
else?) a power failure.
Although the power roles are
not underlined for the audience
during the first act, the whole
structure of the play becomes
obvious early on in the second.
At that point, all the double en
tendre* about power become
clear and the whole play be
comes very trite. It might have
been more interesting if the
power relationships had been

more ambiguous. But they are
generally very clear and do not
switch back and forth more than
once per act.
In spite of all the above.
Power Lines is a comedy. It is
set in a suburb of LA called El
Segundo (which seems to have
the same connotations as
"beautiful downtown Burbank"
did in the old Laugh-In shows). I
did not find the jokes all that
funny; many of them seemed
rather obvious. In addition, the
jokes don't lead anywhere — but
then, neither does much else in
this play. The running joke
(mentioning El Segundo)
stopped working for me very
early on.
I did enjoy Binding Issues.
For much of the scene the au
dience is not aware that the two
men are acting out an S/M fan
tasy. The humor as they gradu
ally emerge from the fantasy
and change in character is very
effective. More than any other,
this scene hints at the blurriness
I mentioned above. Maybe,
though. I enjoyed this scene the
most because Lenny (Allan
Herman) was in it.and Meg
(Virginia Lombard) was not.
Allan Herman is marvelous. I
think that he would still be
marvelous if all you could see of
him was his eyes. He uses them
with great imagination in the
very small theater to enliven
many situations. He also works
very hard to add some depth to a
character which is not very well
established in the script.

The two women in the play do
not have nearly the range of the
men. Their parts do not allow
for as much variation as the
male parts do. but I do not see
this as an excuse for one
dimensional performances such
as these. For Chris (Priscilla
Huddleston > this is not too much
of a problem since her charac
ter is quite reserved and does
not stand out on stage.
Meg, on the other hand, is
played as a heavily-built, loud
mouthed New Yorker. (Couldn't
we have a loud-mouthed North
Dakotan for a change?) That
might work in a large hall, with
the audience 20 feet away and a
fairly large stage. But Theater
Rhinoceros is very intimate,
and in this setting Lombard's
acting is grotesque.
The fascination of power rela
tionships is their ambiguity and
complexity. They are interest
ing because they are confusing
To simplify and sharply define
these relationships may clarify
them, but it also makes them
boring. Theater Rhinoceros at
tracts something considerably
more sophisticated than a TV
audience. It doesn't need to
have everything explained.
The situations in life which
are most theatrical do not
always make good theater.
Power Lines at Theatre
Rhinoceros has taken a very ex
citing and theatrical idea and
transformed it into a rather un
imaginative play.
Power Lines, a comedy by
Joel Schwartz, consists of three
interrelated one-act plays:
Fabulous Opportunities, Bind
ing Issues and Power Failure.
The first two acts both involve
two characters, one dominant
and one submissive, and the
power roles reverse during the
scene. Fabulous Opportunities
involves a couple deciding
whether to go to a job interview
or to a disco, while Binding Is
sues involves the acting out of
an S/M scene with military ov
ertones. Power Failure has the
four characters trapped in a res
taurant freezer (three of the
four characters work at the res
taurant). Notice that here the
situation is dominant and the
characters submissive. The two
couples are saved by (what
else?) a power failure.
