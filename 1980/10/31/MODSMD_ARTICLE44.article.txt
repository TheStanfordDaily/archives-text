# Heads won't be pinned down

### Charles Buckley 
.David Byrne, qu'est-ce que
'rßemain in Light, the Talking
Hieads fourth album, offers the
listener a collection of songs
which are for the most part a
radical departure from the
group's past musical en
deavors. the fact is. however,
that as long as David Byrne and
Brian Eno continue to remain
thSe connoisseurs of music that
tl]jey are. and to fuse their dis
criminate tastes into Talking
Heads albums, every album
that the band makes will seem
to be a departure from the ones
before it.
The overall sound of the
album would probably be best
described as "art-funk. an
amalgam of basic dance
melodies glossed over with as
sorted electric treatments
which, when paired with
Byrne's vocals, leave the songs
with a rather modern sound.
»This description actually fits
the songs on the first side, which
tend to be more fast-paced and
danceable. more than the songs
on the second side, which tend to
be slower and less down to
earth Side two's "The Over
load." which resembles early
Fink Floyd more than anything
el,se. stands in remarkable con
trast to side one's "The Great
Curve." the album's most dan
ceable and upbeat cut. In the
case of both songs, it could be
said that the group was a bit too
extreme in its departure toward
other musical directions, and
it£s a toss-up as to which is the
album's weakest cut.
•The songs that lie in between
these two extremes tend to work
tlje best. Cuts such as "Once in a
lifetime" and "Born Under
Piinches" manage to keep a cer
tain Talking Heads flavor while
delving into a kind of funk sound

not characteristic of the band;
it's difficult to hear either song
without feeling an urge to move
to the music, but at the same
time Byrne's vocals make both
songs unsuitable for those with
Saturday night fever.
In general. Byrne's vocal
work does not cover nearly as
wide a range as on past Talking
Heads albums, probably due to
the fact that he has more vocal
accompaniment on Remain in
Light than on any of the first
three albums. Byrne is joined on
various songs by Non Hendrvx

and Brian Eno; the two are an
interesting combination of
background vocalists when one
considers that while Hendrvx is
noted for her vocal work with
the soul group Labelle, Eno has
often eschewed doing vocal
work on his various solo
projects.
Remain in Light surely has
its flaws — the lyrics are not as
memorable as those of past
albums, and each of the first
side's three songs tends to be a
bit longer than it needs to be.
However, as easv as this album

may be to cut down after one lis
tening, it should be noted that
the songs on Remain in Light,
like those on the band's first
three albums, are the kind that
grow on a listener.
For those who find the album
weak after many listenings,
there's always the solace that
the next Talking Heads album
will probably be different; Re
main in Light is not an end-all or
a drastic switch in direction for
the Talking Heads, but just an
exploration, and an interesting
one at that.
