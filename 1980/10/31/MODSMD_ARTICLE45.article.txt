# Goldie Hawn falls short
## 
### Carol Hegler 
There is a precise, and difficult to achieve,
combination of acting, directing and writing that
produces hilarious, as opposed to humorous,
films. lYiuate Benjamin falls in the second cate
gory — just short of total success.
The film concerns the experiences of Judy Ben
jamin. an unexpected young widow. While
searching for a haven of security she stumbles
upon the Army, only to find it quite different from
what her Army recruiter described. Goldie Hawn
gives a good performance as this confused young
woman trying to find herself. It is easy to em
pathize with Hawn's character as she struggles to
elude the clutches of her loving but overprotective
parents, men that want to control her, and an in
stitution that wants to mold her to its own specif
ications. Judy becomes the obvious heroine of the
film as she, not always gracefully but with a cer
tain style, hurtles these obstacles in her path.
One of these obstacles manifests itself in the
person of Captain Lewis, played by Eileen Bren
nan (who gives a fine and funny performance).

One of the funnier scenes of the movie is the
private's first encounter with the captain. Still
clad in her funeral attire and makeup, expecting
something akin to a resort, Judy arrives at boot
camp. Captain Lewis can hardly contain her
amazement and disbelief at the precious sight of
this ludicrous spectacle. Lewis wastes no time in
educating the young private.
In the other supporting role. Armande Amante
plays the handsome, passionate but shallow
French gynecologist, Dr Tremont, whom
private Judy falls for during a tour of duty. Un
fortunately. the essence of his character is never
successfully communicated and we are left guess
ing what his true feelings are. The relationship be
tween Judy and the handsome doctor never seems
quite plausible.
Walking out of the theater I felt disappointed
that more substance, either dramatic or comic,
was not present — given Hawn's acting ability and
the potential provided by the script. But, as light
entertainment. I found the movie very enjoyable.
So. if you have the taste for something pleasing
but not heavy, this should satisfy your hunger.
