The Hud,« ***#
Saturday, Palo Alto Cultural Cen
ter Theater
When Alfred Hitchcock un
veiled his advertising slogan—
'"The Hirds is Coming!" —for this
plumaged version of the
apocalypse, someone in the Uni
versal advertising department
corrected him: "Excuse me, but
don't you mean 'The birds are
coming l " The characters in The
Birds are a little like that
anonymous publicity executive —
they're too busy playing with syn
tax to ever grasp the semantics.
Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor, first
antagonists and then lovers, play
characters who pathetically try to
maintain normalcy in the face of
unfathomable disaster. They nev
er know—and Hitchcock doesn't
tell us—why the birds attack The
creatures seem to be agents of
chaos sent to test mankind's
strength; the characters fail be
cause they respond not with
bravery but with pitiful remnants
of good manners.

\lfghl of the Living Dead ★★
Tonight, Kresge
Living Dead opened to poor
business when it was released in
the late '60s, and it achieved its
present notoriety only after Rex
Reed and Reader's Digest ran col
umns which accused it of damag
ing children's minds I haven't en
countered any Living Dead-in
duced psychotics. but that still
doesn't make this a good movie.
1 guess I have trouble with any
film for which the director of spe
cial effects was a butcher. I'm
sure that raw meat, In its place,
has legitimate artistic value, but
even top sirloin couldn't redeem
Living Dead's fatal confusion be
tween explicitness and terror.

The Kids Are Alright ★★★ *
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live
Rock" by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
came first: our generation or The
Who?
Late show this weekend.

Mary I'oppins ** ★ ★
Fox Theater. Redwood City
Disney's technicians were nev
er in better form than here: the
visuals are so convincingly magi
cal that they triumph over the
more earthbound elements of the
plot The movie is justly famous
for the scenes where live-action
and animation are blended, but
there's a feeling of animation to
the rest of the film, too—even the
human participants have taken on
the quirky appeal of cartoon char
acters Albert Whitlock's matte
paintings create a striking, fairy
tale-pretty Victorian London
Julie Andrews and Dick Van
Dyke star. Plays Sunday and Mon
day with Carol Reed's Oliver!.

The (fodfather Parts I <£: II
★★★*
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Taken as a whole, this 6V2-hour
work is the movie equivalent of the
Great American Novel: this Fran
cis Coppola masterwork is an epic,
juicy, lustful and violent look at
the criminal subculture in Ameri
ca — its ugliness; its vitality; its
rigid, peculiar ethics.
Part I is three hours of pure
flashy, lurid excitement — the
greatest gangster movie ever
made. The then-largely unknown
Coppola took Mario Puzo's pulp
novel and and came up with some
thing greater than anyone (except
Coppola?) expected. Marlon Bran
do fills his cheeks with orange
peels and talks in a tired, beaten,
world-wise voice; the movie re
volves around his compelling pres
ence as Vito Corleone, the God
father.
Phrt II is a little messy around
the edges, but still very great.
More subdued, more introspective
than its predecessor, this sequel
sometimes lacks the vulgar
energy that drove the first movie,
but Part II is more textured, more
complex, more troubling. And
Coppola and cinematographer
Gordon Willis' recreation of the
little Italy of 1920s New York
makes an adjective like evocative
seem inadequate.
Remarkable performances
abound in both movies; those by
Brando, A 1 Pacino, James Caan,
Talia Shire, Lee Strasberg,
Michael Gazzo and the late John
Cazale are especially noteworthy.
Plays tomorrow night and Sun
day.

Ordinary I'eople **
Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Redford's
style js more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its

Stardust Memories ★★★★
Palo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career, Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors; the structure is as loose as
Bananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline, Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantic
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline

Old Mill Mountain View
Walter Matthau plays Miles
Kendig. a CIA agent relegated to a
desk job Matthau with his lanky
teddy-bear looks and that cautious
mincing walk, is a peculiar choice
for the role of a secret agent, but
he can get away with it because we
know how clever (and sexy) he re
ally is.
Director Ronald Neame, an
Englishman, is a cold fish, but he
is competent and he keeps the pic
ture moving fairly quickly.
Hopscotdi resembles some of the
British comedies of the '50s that
featured Alec Guinness and
Alistair Sim and were spun on neat
plot devices. It's not a great mov
ie, but one that will be remem
bered with pleasure.

The Goodbye Girl ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud
Richard Dreyfuss and Neil Si
mon seem made for eadi other:
they both laugh too loudly at their
own jokes. Simon fans, and there
are many, should find this movie
to be entirely satisfactory, but the
movie's approach to comedy
seems almost clinical—one gets
the feeling that the jokes have
been fine-tuned by an audience
wearing electrodes.
Marsha Mason, playing a wom
an whose idea of a good time is re
decorating her apartment, is fea
tured. Herbert Ross (The Turning
Point, Nijinsky) directed.

.4 Clockwork Orange ★
Old Mill, Mountain View
| Stanley Kubrick transferred the
Tinthony Burgess novel to the
screen bv making a gruelingly vis
ual film. The style of filmmaking
is as aggressive as the film's char
acters: Kubrick assaults us with
harsh lighting and jagged editing
strategies designed to disorient
the viewer
.4 Clockwork Orange is a moral
ity play set in the near future,
when battlelines have been drawn
between the individual and the so
ciety that must protect that indi
vidual. Malcom MacDowell stars
as a man who enjoys Beethoven
and committing violent acts.
Late show this weekend.

tlleuro No/i Troppo ★ ***
New Varsity. Palo Alto i
Bruno Bozetto directed this
parody of Disney's Fantasia Like
the Disnev film, Allegro Nun
I'roppo is an anthology of anima
tion inspired by classical music.
But Bozetto's work has a wit and
bite to it that the Disney film, for
all of its technical splendor, lacks.
The film s highlight is an outline
of evolution set to Ravel's Holer >
All life on earth begins from a few
drops of primordial slime sloshed
from a Coke bottle: it may be the
Jnost effective retelling of the
Story of creation ever filmed.
Plays tonight only, with Ralph

The Empire Strikes Hack ir-k
Old Mill Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor Every
thing has become deadly serious —
bigger, brighter, splashier, and
dull
All the old performers are back,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned muppet
creature that, for an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of magic and
expectation The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending—
jeepers. George, couldn't you
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work?

The Elephant Man *■★★★
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
r "The Elephant Man " Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battling our fear of the
unknown.
— Tom Taylor
Had Timing
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Despite some fine erotic mo
ments, Nicholas Roeg's new mov
ie is a puzzle picture of the 1960s
Antonioni variety, pretty and
blank Art Garfunkel shows off his
effete superciliousness, and
Theresa Russell is far too drab to
be playing a role that is supposed
to be a mixture of Louise Brooks in
Pandora's Box, Marlene Dietrich
in The Blue Angel, Julie Christie
in Darling and Liza Minnelli in
Caberet. Harvey Keitel's per
formance looks like a series of out
takes from Fingers, but Denholm
Elliott, as Russell's estranged
husband, works up an intriguing
character almost out of thin air.

Fame ★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
There are about three good
minutes in this one, and those
three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a
Teenaged Chorus Line. All the fa
miliar faces are here, an ignorant
but-talented ghetto kid, a girl who
brings along a Jewish mother out
of a '40s comic strip, and a lonely
but-taiented homosexual son of a
famous actress All work to prove
that it takes an incredible amount
of talent to keep churning out
melodrama. g
Alan Parker who made the
world safe for stereotypes with
197 8' s Midnight Express,
