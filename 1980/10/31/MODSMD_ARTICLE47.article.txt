Iran's parliament stalls on hostages
Iranian supporters of a quick solution to the American
hostage situation marshalled their forces for a new at
tempt on Sunday following yesterday morning's debacle in
which diehard Islamic radicals blocked the parliament
from achieving a quorum to open business.
The speaker of the Iranian parliament blamed stubborn
anti-American sentiment and the war with Iraq for a
stormy hard-liners' boycott that prevented the assembly
from voting on — or even discussing — release of U.S.

hostages on the 362 nd day of their captivity in the hands of
Islamic revolutionaries.
The unexpected debacle, labeled "treason" by one
prominent parliament member, highlighted the extent to
which many assembly members in the fundamentalist Is
lamic bloc remain unwilling to be seen dealing with the
I mted States despite an emerging consensus among their
leaders that the hostage issue must be settled soon
With another attempt at debate set for Sunday, it
brought down to the wire any possibility of a decisive
breakthrough on the hostage issue before the U.S. presi
dential elections next Tuesday, the first anniversary of the
hostages capture Some of those who stayed away yester
day declared they did so precisely because the elections
are so near, fearing action now could only help the United

Carter criticized on Billygate
Washington — The Justice Department's internal in
vestigative unit handed the Senate's Billy Carter subcom
mittee a political hot potato Wednesday — the depart
ment's own report on the Libyan connection of the presi
dent's brother, complete with a reportedly critical
assessment of the parts played by several Carter adminis
tration officials, including Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti.
The report also is said to criticize the White House for
failing to cooperate in the investigation.

Michael Shaheen, head of the department's office of
professional responsibility, forwarded three copies of
what he termed a "status report" to Sens Birch Bayh (D-
Ind.), the subcommittee chairman; Strom Thurmond <R-
S.C.), the ranking minority member, and Philip Tone, the
special counsel Shaheen requested that the report not be
released publicly, because the investigation was not yet
complete
A department spokesman said Shaheen was sending the
interim report because he'd promised something to the
committee by the end of this month Receipt of the Justice
report puts the subcommittee in the delicate position of
determining how to deal with press requests for it a week
before the presidential election
