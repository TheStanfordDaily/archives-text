### Fred Wainwright 
In a debate held here Wednesday
night among the candidates for the
21st District Assembly seat, Greg
Morris, Chuck Olson and Byron Sher
directed questions at one another on
issues of personal background as well
as political beliefs.
The debate, sponsored by
the ASSU and moderated by Council of
Presidents member Dick Butterfield,
opened with a short introductory
speech from each candidate.
Morris, the first speaker, dealt
mainly with his personal background.
He was a student at Stanford and
worked as a policeman before being
elected to the Sunnyvale City Council.
Later Morris began a private prac
tice in law and served on various task
forces and commissions in the area.
Sher pointed out his experience on
the Palo Alto City Council, which in
cluded two years as mayor. Sher said
he feels at home in Stanford since he is
a professor of law here and has been
chairman of the Faculty Senate.
During his speech, Sher questioned
Morris' consistency of opinion relat
ing to several issues. Sher also as
serted that "realistically speaking,
this race is actually between me and
Mr. Morris."
Olson, a member of the Libertarian
Party, briefly summed up his back
ground, and proceeded to rebuke
Sher's statement. He said he is defi
nitely a factor in the race and pledged

that if elected, he will follow the Lib
ertarian platform.
A molecular biologist, Olson is
pursuing his third year of graduate
studies at Stanford. He stressed indi
vidual rights as a basis for supporting
decreased taxation, improved educa
tion and increased freedom of person
al life styles, specifically marijuana
use.
Following the introductory
speeches, a question and answer peri
od was initiated. Each candidate was
allowed to direct two questions at
either or both of his opponents.
Morris asked Olson about the Liber
tarian Party's basic stance on educa
tion and then asked him, "Is your par
ty a member of the right, the left, or is
the question, for that matter, irrele
vant?"
Olson stated his party's beliefs on
education but the two-minute time pe
riod, given for each candidate's re
sponse, ended before he could fully an
swer Morris's question.
Morris also charged Sher with bor
rowing $5000 in order to maintain his
campaign efforts and asked Sher to re
spond to the charge. Sher proceeded to
describe the basic budget for his cam
paign and acknowledged that he bor
rowed the $5000.
In response to questions from the
audience. Morris and Sher both spoke
out against the Peripheral Canal, a
multi-billion dollar project designed
to channel water from Northern to

Southern California. They also said
they favored Proposition 10, a non
smokers' rights bill.
Olson agreed with Morris and Sher
on the Peripheral Canal and called the
project "another clear example of pol
iticians using public projects to ap
propriate money for their own use."
However, Olson opposed Proposition
10. saying the bill would allow govern
ment to invade private businesses.
The candidates concluded by ac
knowledging the support given to
them by various organizations and
thanking the ASSU for organizing the
debate.
