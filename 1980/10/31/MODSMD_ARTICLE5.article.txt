Republican candidate Paul Gann is one of two challengers
vying for Sen. Alan Cranston's position in Washington.
Gann's organization, entitled People's Advocate, worked with
Howard Jarvis to author Proposition 13 and also encouraged sup
port for Proposition 9 in 1978. a tax-cut measure which, unlike
Proposition 13. did not pass.
People's Advocate is a non-profit group founded by Gann in 1974
to support grass-roots efforts to make state government more
responsive and responsible."
Gann has never held public office before, and now is running on
a conservative platform. His campaign seems to be structured in
direct opposition to Cranston's record, as the two disagree on
almost every visible issue.
Gann has come out strongly in favor of unrestricted defense
spending as opposed to Cranston's drive for cuts in Pentagon fund
ing. However. Gann also favors a balanced federal budget. On this
point, he and Cranston agree.
Gann is opposed to school busing where Cranston supports it.
Gann claims the Equal Rights Amendment is unnecessary, and
Cranston supports it.

The U.S. Senate

Nuclear power is on Gann's list of "musts." and federally
funded abortion is on the list of "must nots." Declaring himself
personally opposed to abortion, Gann has said that he does not fa
vor the constitutional amendment to ban abortion, because the
proposed amendment does not make provision for cases involving
rape and incest.
As to the draft, Gann said it is unnecessary at this time, but he
would support it in an emergency. He encourages increases in
military wages to improve incentives and thus upgrade the quali
ty of the volunteer forces.
Gann has also come out in favor of the Kemp-Roth tax-cut bill,
maintaining that it will create work in private industries by giv
ing taxpayers more spending power.
The Republican candidate has not limited hi? recommenda
tions to domestic policy.
The current war in the Persian Gulf demands a strong U.S.
stance unless we plan to lose this area to the Soviets, according to
Gann. His personal recommendation is that military bases be es
tablished in Oman and Egypt.
Gann is also an avid supporter of strengthening ties with Israel.
He calls Israel's security "the cornerstone of any Middle East
peace settlement."
