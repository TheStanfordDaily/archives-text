"I'm not trying to sell Utopia. I'm trying to be practical," said
David Bergland, Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate, about the
goals of his campaign Bergland is challenging incumbent Demo
crat Alan Cranston and Republican Paul Gann, a race that he ad
mits Cranston will probably win He spoke to Daily reporters this
week during a campaign swing through the Bay Area
Although he would like to win. Bergland. 45, says the main rea
son he is running is to attempt to establish the Libertarians as a
strong third party in the United States. To this end, the party has
more than 500 candidates seeking election this November, and
hopes to win about a dozen races.
Describing his Libertarian views. Bergland said he believes in
"a philosophy for the respect of the rights of other people." Pin
pointing big government as the source of the nation's problems,
Bergland said he would work to limit the federal government's
power if elected Ultimately, he said, he wants a society with
"maximum personal freedom and minimum government."
Calling his opponents "warmongers," Bergland said the most
significant issue in the senate campaign is "manufactured talk
about going to war in the Middle East for oil." He believes both
Cranston and Gann want U.S. military action
Bergland believes "the main function of the federal govern
ment should be defense," but does not think the U.S. should in
terfere politically or militarily in other countries. America
should withdraw from "entangling alliances" such as NATO and
concentrate on defending American soil and the personal and
property rights of American citizens, according to Bergland
Bergland called thedraft "slavery." and said any American in
tervention overseas, such as in the Middle East, should be on a
voluntary basis without financial support from the federal gov
ernment.
Government intervention in the economy should be eliminated,
according to Bergland. He believes a free marketplace and unhin
dered competition would result in reduced unemployment and in
flation
Minimum wages create "a chronic class of people that never
get a start in the workplace." according to Bergland. He also
blames occupational licensing and union restrictions for high un
employment. Inflation, says Bergland. is caused by government
mismanagement of the money supply
Bergland would also eliminate the Social Security system, call
ing it a gigantic pyramid scheme. He would have the government
pay off existing Social Security participants by selling govern
ment land, and then abolish the mandatory system He believes
that people can only be secure in their old age if they are not re
liant upon the government.
Bergland wants private organizations to take over much of the
regulation and standard setting now done by government. He be
lieves that private organizations will set higher standards than
does government for such things as product safety and quality,
and educational quality.
A veteran campaigner, Bergland ran for Attorney General of
California in 1974 and Vice President of the United States in 1976,
both on the Libertarian ticket. Bergland finished third in the 1976
race, polling 174,000 votes nationwide. He has also been the na
tional chairman of the Libertarian party since 1977 When not
