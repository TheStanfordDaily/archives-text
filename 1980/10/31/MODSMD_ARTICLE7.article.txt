# Candidates compete for county seat

### Joan O'Connell 
In next week's election for the fifth
district seat on the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, the two can
didates are at odds on several fronts,
including personal philosophies about
what the job involves and what quali
ties they hope to bring to it.
Attorney Jim Jackson, a former
mayor of Cupertino, said he sees "ef
fective leadership" in the areas of
transportation and housing as his
basic priorities.
His opponent, Becky Morgan, a
Stanford Business School graduate
and former assistant vice president
for the Bank of America, says she sees
land-use decisions and public safety
issues — especially overcrowded jails
— as key.
The race to fill retiring incumbent
Geraldine Steinberg's seat promises
to be one of the closest on the Penin
sula. The Stanford precinct — part of
the fifth district — has registered 6051
voters.
Both candidates have acknowl
edged that Stanford occupies a
"unique" position in the county be
cause of its unincorporated status and
have pledged, if elec ted, to keep in
close communication with the Univer
sity's administration.
Land use
Morgan said she sees land use, the
role of deputy sheriffs on campus and
the association of the Stanford Medi
cal Center to the Valley Medical Cen
ter as probable instances where the
University would be directly involved
in her consideration of issues as super
visor
She said she supports the efforts the
University has taken in housing, add
ing that she felt the University will
have to continue to assume a large
share of responsibility for the housing
shortage in which it plays a big role
Morgan said she supports both the
Peter Coutts Hill faculty housing
