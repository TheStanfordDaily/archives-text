# Candidates compete for county seat
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
In next week's election for the fifth
district seat on the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, the two can
didates are at odds on several fronts,
including personal philosophies about
what the job involves and what quali
ties they hope to bring to it.
Attorney Jim Jackson, a former
mayor of Cupertino, said he sees "ef
fective leadership" in the areas of
transportation and housing as his
basic priorities.
His opponent, Becky Morgan, a
Stanford Business School graduate
and former assistant vice president
for the Bank of America, says she sees
land-use decisions and public safety
issues — especially overcrowded jails
— as key.
The race to fill retiring incumbent
Geraldine Steinberg's seat promises
to be one of the closest on the Penin
sula. The Stanford precinct — part of
the fifth district — has registered 6051
voters.
Both candidates have acknowl
edged that Stanford occupies a
"unique" position in the county be
cause of its unincorporated status and
have pledged, if elec ted, to keep in
close communication with the Univer
sity's administration.
Land use
Morgan said she sees land use, the
role of deputy sheriffs on campus and
the association of the Stanford Medi
cal Center to the Valley Medical Cen
ter as probable instances where the
University would be directly involved
in her consideration of issues as super
visor
She said she supports the efforts the
University has taken in housing, add
ing that she felt the University will
have to continue to assume a large
share of responsibility for the housing
shortage in which it plays a big role
Morgan said she supports both the
Peter Coutts Hill faculty housing
project plan, and preliminary plans
for a housing facility off Willow Road.
Student appeal
Jackson said his candidacy should
appeal to students because of his in
terest in people and their trust in gov
ernment. plus his support of Measure
C. which asks county voters if they are
opposed to peacetime military con
scription.
In the area of transportation. Jack
son said implications for the north
county include the need to upgrade the
Southern Pacific railroad line.
Morgan said she is not keying on the
transportation issue because she
thinks "things are already happening
rather smoothly in that area." How
ever in public safety questions like ov
ercrowded jails, youth crime and
budget cuts for county sheriffs.
Morgan said the situation in Santa
Clara borders on "tragic" and re
quires immediate attention.
Jackson said Morgan's approach to

both the transportation and public
safety questions represented "gov
ernmental naivete "
Public safety
"The major responsibility for pub
lic safety is from the city." he said,
adding that a renewed emphasis by
county supervisors would not result in
"more cops on the street."
Both candidates have questioned
each other's qualifications. Morgan,
with strong support from the business
community, pinpointed health and so
cial services and experience with
large budgets as two major areas
where she thinks Jackson's lack of ex
perience is serious.
"When I served on the Palo Alto
Board of Education." Morgan said. "I
worked with a budget five times his
city budget as mayor of Cupertino,
and with ten times the number of em
ployees."
Business contacts
She said her contact with the busi
ness community will assist her in es

tablishing a cooperative working rela
tionship between government and
business in the county.
However. Jackson said Morgan's in
experience in "general municipal af
fairs" is a serious hindrance. Plus, he
told an audience on October 23. "the
county needs far more creativity than
most bankers have."

and with ten times the number of em
ployees."
Business contacts
She said her contact with the busi
ness community will assist her in es

tablishing a cooperative working rela
tionship between government and
business in the county.
However. Jackson said Morgan's in
experience in "general municipal af
fairs" is a serious hindrance. Plus, he
told an audience on October 23. "the
county needs far more creativity than
most bankers have."
In next week's election for the fifth
district seat on the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, the two can
didates are at odds on several fronts,
including personal philosophies about
what the job involves and what quali
ties they hope to bring to it.
Attorney Jim Jackson, a former
mayor of Cupertino, said he sees "ef
fective leadership" in the areas of
transportation and housing as his
basic priorities.
His opponent, Becky Morgan, a
Stanford Business School graduate
and former assistant vice president
for the Bank of America, says she sees
land-use decisions and public safety
issues — especially overcrowded jails
— as key.
The race to fill retiring incumbent
Geraldine Steinberg's seat promises
to be one of the closest on the Penin
sula. The Stanford precinct — part of
the fifth district — has registered 6051
voters.
Both candidates have acknowl
edged that Stanford occupies a
"unique" position in the county be
cause of its unincorporated status and
have pledged, if elec ted, to keep in
close communication with the Univer
sity's administration.
Land use
Morgan said she sees land use, the
role of deputy sheriffs on campus and
the association of the Stanford Medi
cal Center to the Valley Medical Cen
ter as probable instances where the
University would be directly involved
in her consideration of issues as super
visor
She said she supports the efforts the
University has taken in housing, add
ing that she felt the University will
have to continue to assume a large
share of responsibility for the housing
shortage in which it plays a big role
Morgan said she supports both the
Peter Coutts Hill faculty housing
project plan, and preliminary plans
for a housing facility off Willow Road.
Student appeal
Jackson said his candidacy should
appeal to students because of his in
terest in people and their trust in gov
ernment. plus his support of Measure
C. which asks county voters if they are
opposed to peacetime military con
scription.
In the area of transportation. Jack
son said implications for the north
county include the need to upgrade the
Southern Pacific railroad line.
Morgan said she is not keying on the
transportation issue because she
thinks "things are already happening
rather smoothly in that area." How
ever in public safety questions like ov
ercrowded jails, youth crime and
budget cuts for county sheriffs.
Morgan said the situation in Santa
Clara borders on "tragic" and re
quires immediate attention.
Jackson said Morgan's approach to

both the transportation and public
safety questions represented "gov
ernmental naivete "
Public safety
"The major responsibility for pub
lic safety is from the city." he said,
adding that a renewed emphasis by
county supervisors would not result in
"more cops on the street."
Both candidates have questioned
each other's qualifications. Morgan,
with strong support from the business
community, pinpointed health and so
cial services and experience with
large budgets as two major areas
where she thinks Jackson's lack of ex
perience is serious.
"When I served on the Palo Alto
Board of Education." Morgan said. "I
worked with a budget five times his
city budget as mayor of Cupertino,
and with ten times the number of em
ployees."

She said her contact with the busi
ness community will assist her in es
