## Both sides demand power Violence clouds Jamaican election 
### Washington Post 
Kingston, Jamaica — A wav
ing mass of clenched fists, smil
ing faces and swaying bodies
stretched away from the politi
cians on the stage and into the
hot, humid obscurity of the Ja
maican night.
The mounting exaltation of
the tattered masses gathered in
Kingston's Halfway Tree Park
pushed aside pervasive fears of
political violence that has cost
more than 450 lives since elec
tions were announced Feb. 3 and
was worried that bloody fight
ing and political vengeance
would erupt on a massive scale
when voters finally went to the
polls last night. The gunmen did
not come this Saturday evening
to blast away at the crowd, as
happens so often here these
days.
"Michael" was coming.
Prime Minister Michael Man
ley, 56. is seeking an un
precedented and. until recently,
improbable third term. Manley.
the leader of Jamaica's increas
ingly radical People's National
Party, the prophet of a vision
ary, socialist future for the
Caribbean's largest English
speaking island, was about to
arrive.
"Joshua." his people called to
him as to a biblical leader tak

ing them to a promised land.
"Every time I talk about
Joshua." they sang beneath a
haze of marijuana smoke, be
tween swigs of Red Strip beer,
"every time I talk about Joshua
I feel good, good, good."
It is midday Sunday in West
Kingston. Edward Seaga, 50.
leader of the conservative, busi
ness-oriented opposition Jamai
ca Labor Party, stops his rag
tag motorcade to greet hun
dreds of his own excited sup
porters.
Deliverance
A relatively colorless man.
Seaga thrills his people by exud
ing a confident competence. His
party stalwarts admit he has no
charisma. But everyone is
shouting and laughing and danc
ing as they see him.
Machine-gun toting bod
yguards stand by, nervous but
amused, as Seaga is hoisted up
and carried aloft by the crowd.
"Deliverance." the people
are calling out. "Deliverance."
Deliverance from Michael Man
ley.
Politics in Jamaica is like old
time religion, based more on
faith and fervor than on reason
— and capable in the wake of the
elections, many Jamaicans now
fear, of leading to bloody
crusades for power that could

completely ravage this terribly
beautiful, terribly im
poverished country.
This ninth election in Jamai
ca's history is unlike any in its
past. The stakes are higher, the
world is watching, and there are
more guns When both can
didates claim that the future of
the nation is on the line, nobody
doubts them.
On the verge of bankruptcy
Jamaica is on the verge of
bankruptcy. It has no foreign ex
change and the shelves of its
stores are as empty as the once
crowded tourist beaches.
The government-guaranteed
foreign debt, all but unpayable,
stands at $1.3 billion. An ar
rangement with the Interna
tional Monetary Fund for eco
nomic help has been broken off
amid bitter controversy over
the fund's plans and motives as
well as Manley's.
For seven years Jamaica's
economy has been shrinking in
stead of growing. Unemploy
ment is at least 35 percent. For
Jamaicans under 25, half the
population, there is little or no
work at all. and as they suffer,
their militancy grows.
Beyond control
Manley places most of the
blame for this situation on
powers beyond his control. The

pressures of world trade domi
nated by soaring oil prices are
one cause of Jamaica's ills, says
Manley. While the need for ex
ports to earn money to pay the
oil bill has increased, prod
uction of traditional Jamaican
export commodities like sugar
and bananas has plunged and
not even the country's economic
staple bauxite has filled the gap.
Seaga, on the other hand,
claims that virtually the whole
mess is Manley s fault. He sees
the causes of the current crisis
in Jamaica in eight years of
Manley, whose mismanage
ment, ideologicial posturing
and courting of communist
Cuba have alienated old friends
in the United States, and who
has attempted to be a world
leader while letting bureaucra
cy. inefficiency and discord run
rampant at home.
Although Manley has been
careful not to make direct at
tacks on U.S. influence here,
members of his party are not so
reserved and there have been
frequent denunciations of al
leged Central Intelligency
Agency destabilization. Seaga is
occasionally referred to as
Ciaga.
For months it seemed the
mandate would be Seaga's in
stead. By the summer, polls
showed the Jamaican Labor
Party with a substantial 15
percent lead.
The result is that each side
now believes firmly that it will
win, and members of each party
are girding to fight if they feel
thev've been cheated of victory.

Snake skins for sale

common to people in the region.
Kingston, Jamaica — A wav
ing mass of clenched fists, smil
ing faces and swaying bodies
stretched away from the politi
cians on the stage and into the
hot, humid obscurity of the Ja
maican night.
The mounting exaltation of
the tattered masses gathered in
Kingston's Halfway Tree Park
pushed aside pervasive fears of
political violence that has cost
more than 450 lives since elec
tions were announced Feb. 3 and
was worried that bloody fight
ing and political vengeance
would erupt on a massive scale
when voters finally went to the
polls last night. The gunmen did
not come this Saturday evening
to blast away at the crowd, as
happens so often here these
days.
"Michael" was coming.
Prime Minister Michael Man
ley, 56. is seeking an un
precedented and. until recently,
improbable third term. Manley.
the leader of Jamaica's increas
ingly radical People's National
Party, the prophet of a vision
ary, socialist future for the
Caribbean's largest English
speaking island, was about to
arrive.
"Joshua." his people called to
him as to a biblical leader tak

ing them to a promised land.
"Every time I talk about
Joshua." they sang beneath a
haze of marijuana smoke, be
tween swigs of Red Strip beer,
"every time I talk about Joshua
I feel good, good, good."
It is midday Sunday in West
Kingston. Edward Seaga, 50.
leader of the conservative, busi
ness-oriented opposition Jamai
ca Labor Party, stops his rag
tag motorcade to greet hun
dreds of his own excited sup
porters.
Deliverance
A relatively colorless man.
Seaga thrills his people by exud
ing a confident competence. His
party stalwarts admit he has no
charisma. But everyone is
shouting and laughing and danc
ing as they see him.
Machine-gun toting bod
yguards stand by, nervous but
amused, as Seaga is hoisted up
and carried aloft by the crowd.
"Deliverance." the people
are calling out. "Deliverance."
Deliverance from Michael Man
ley.
Politics in Jamaica is like old
time religion, based more on
faith and fervor than on reason
— and capable in the wake of the
elections, many Jamaicans now
fear, of leading to bloody
crusades for power that could

completely ravage this terribly
beautiful, terribly im
poverished country.
This ninth election in Jamai
ca's history is unlike any in its
past. The stakes are higher, the
world is watching, and there are
more guns When both can
didates claim that the future of
the nation is on the line, nobody
doubts them.
On the verge of bankruptcy
Jamaica is on the verge of
bankruptcy. It has no foreign ex
change and the shelves of its
stores are as empty as the once
crowded tourist beaches.
The government-guaranteed
foreign debt, all but unpayable,
stands at $1.3 billion. An ar
rangement with the Interna
tional Monetary Fund for eco
nomic help has been broken off
amid bitter controversy over
the fund's plans and motives as
well as Manley's.
For seven years Jamaica's
economy has been shrinking in
stead of growing. Unemploy
ment is at least 35 percent. For
Jamaicans under 25, half the
population, there is little or no
work at all. and as they suffer,
their militancy grows.
Beyond control
Manley places most of the
blame for this situation on
powers beyond his control. The

pressures of world trade domi
nated by soaring oil prices are
one cause of Jamaica's ills, says
Manley. While the need for ex
ports to earn money to pay the
oil bill has increased, prod
uction of traditional Jamaican
export commodities like sugar
and bananas has plunged and
not even the country's economic
staple bauxite has filled the gap.
Seaga, on the other hand,
claims that virtually the whole
mess is Manley s fault. He sees
the causes of the current crisis
in Jamaica in eight years of
Manley, whose mismanage
ment, ideologicial posturing
and courting of communist
Cuba have alienated old friends
in the United States, and who
has attempted to be a world
leader while letting bureaucra
cy. inefficiency and discord run
rampant at home.
Although Manley has been
careful not to make direct at
tacks on U.S. influence here,
members of his party are not so
reserved and there have been
frequent denunciations of al
leged Central Intelligency
Agency destabilization. Seaga is
occasionally referred to as
Ciaga.
For months it seemed the
mandate would be Seaga's in
stead. By the summer, polls
showed the Jamaican Labor
Party with a substantial 15
percent lead.
The result is that each side
now believes firmly that it will
win, and members of each party
are girding to fight if they feel
thev've been cheated of victory.
