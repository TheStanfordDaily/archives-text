# Gulf war stunts Arab unity
## 
### Washington Post 
Amman, Jordan — Its design personally ap
proved by King Hussein, an enormous sculptured
globe bearing only the outline of the Arab world
has appeared literally overnight in the center of
Amman's interior ministry traffic circle — a
symbol of the pretense of Arab unity that is rapid
ly crumbling in the wake of the gulf war.
A long block away, the finishing touches are
being put to a new. ultramodern cultural center
and convention hall, the pride of the king's am
bitious program to turn Amman from a sleepy
desert town into a cosmopolitan regional
crossroads. It is here that the heads of state and
government of the Arab world will meet next
month in the 11th Arab summit conference, a
gathering that promises to be one of the most
acrimonious summits in the turbulent history of
inter-Arab relations.
But as the spectre of a deep schism in the
Middle East overshadows the preparations for the
summit — a division that threatens to align the
conservative Arab monarchies irreconcilably
against the revolutionary regimes of the region —
the Jordanian king faces other diplomatic con
flicts that could complicate his world political
manuvering for a long time to come.
The alliances of Syria. Libya. South Yemen and
the Palestine Liberation Organization in support
of Iran, and the consequent friction which that
alignment has created with the conservative
monarchies is only part of the intricate web of
conflicting relationships that the king has created
for himself by taking the bold gamble of setting
the pace for Arab support of Iraqi strongman Sad
dam Hussein — a gamble that has failed to
achieve its goal of a common Arab stand.
King Hussein appears to have not only com
plicated his position in the sphere of the Middle
East, but potentially with the Soviet Union and the
United States as well.
There has already been some fallout from the

king's pro-Iraqi leadership role in the Soviet Un
ion. with Moscow earlier this month cancelling
the monarch's scheduled visit to meet with Rus
sian leaders. Officially, the trip was called off be
cause of scheduling conflicts and the urgency of
the king's state business at home in the midst of
the Persian Gulf crisis.
However, informed diplomatic sources said the
Russians cancelled the trip beause it could not
have come at a worse time, given the king's role in
rallying Arab support behind Saddam Hussein in
his campaign against the Iranians.
Syrian president Hafez Assad was due in Mos
cow at the same time to sign a friendship treaty
with the Soviet Union, a coincidence that would
have embarrassed Assad and the Russians, con
sidering the worsening of relations between Jor
dan and Syria since the outbreak of the Iraqi-Ira
nian war.
The Soviet-Syrian friendship treaty is bitterly
resented by the conservative Arab states, which
are committed to a policy of limiting Russian in
fluence in the region.
King Hussein has been determined to maintain
active bilateral relations with the Soviet Union,
and has repeatedly said that he will even consider
purchasing arms from the Russians if doors are
closed to him in other arms markets, most
notably the United States.
Official Jordanian sources and diplomatic ob
servers are agreed that in the short run. there is
little likelihood that U.S.-Jordanian relations will
be seriously affected by by the war. barring any
overt American intervention on behalf of Iran,
either to achieve the release of the 52 American
hostages, or for strategic purposes.
But if the war took a turn against Iraq, and the
king made good on his readiness to supply direct
military assistance instead of just logistical sup
port, observers here agreed, then the Jordan-U.S.
relationship might be subjected to greater strain.

But as the spectre of a deep schism in the
Middle East overshadows the preparations for the
summit — a division that threatens to align the
conservative Arab monarchies irreconcilably
against the revolutionary regimes of the region —
the Jordanian king faces other diplomatic con
flicts that could complicate his world political
manuvering for a long time to come.
The alliances of Syria. Libya. South Yemen and
the Palestine Liberation Organization in support
of Iran, and the consequent friction which that
alignment has created with the conservative
monarchies is only part of the intricate web of
conflicting relationships that the king has created
for himself by taking the bold gamble of setting
the pace for Arab support of Iraqi strongman Sad
dam Hussein — a gamble that has failed to
achieve its goal of a common Arab stand.
King Hussein appears to have not only com
plicated his position in the sphere of the Middle
East, but potentially with the Soviet Union and the
United States as well.
There has already been some fallout from the

king's pro-Iraqi leadership role in the Soviet Un
ion. with Moscow earlier this month cancelling
the monarch's scheduled visit to meet with Rus
sian leaders. Officially, the trip was called off be
cause of scheduling conflicts and the urgency of
the king's state business at home in the midst of
the Persian Gulf crisis.
However, informed diplomatic sources said the
Russians cancelled the trip beause it could not
have come at a worse time, given the king's role in
rallying Arab support behind Saddam Hussein in
his campaign against the Iranians.
Syrian president Hafez Assad was due in Mos
cow at the same time to sign a friendship treaty
with the Soviet Union, a coincidence that would
have embarrassed Assad and the Russians, con
sidering the worsening of relations between Jor
dan and Syria since the outbreak of the Iraqi-Ira
nian war.
The Soviet-Syrian friendship treaty is bitterly
resented by the conservative Arab states, which
are committed to a policy of limiting Russian in
fluence in the region.
King Hussein has been determined to maintain
active bilateral relations with the Soviet Union,
and has repeatedly said that he will even consider
purchasing arms from the Russians if doors are
closed to him in other arms markets, most
notably the United States.
Official Jordanian sources and diplomatic ob
servers are agreed that in the short run. there is
little likelihood that U.S.-Jordanian relations will
be seriously affected by by the war. barring any
overt American intervention on behalf of Iran,
either to achieve the release of the 52 American
hostages, or for strategic purposes.
But if the war took a turn against Iraq, and the
king made good on his readiness to supply direct
military assistance instead of just logistical sup
port, observers here agreed, then the Jordan-U.S.
relationship might be subjected to greater strain.
