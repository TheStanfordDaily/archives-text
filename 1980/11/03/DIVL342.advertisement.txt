with a preface by Chevy Chase
Chevy Chase's hilarious preface to this wonder
fully illustrated catalog of unprecedented prod
ucts is only the beginning. What follows is a
ham-on-wry look at American aspirations in the
eighties, a scintillating parody of the current
madness in the marketplace, a complete guide
to both high tech and dreck, the ulti mate Satur
day Night Live of mail order catalogs. As Francis
Bacon put it, "You only wallow once in the sty of
life. So go whole hog and pig out while you can."
