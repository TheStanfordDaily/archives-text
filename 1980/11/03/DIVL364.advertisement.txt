CLARK
PRESIDENT
'I heard more ideas from Ed Clark in 25 minutes
than I've heard from Carter, Kennedy, Reagan,
Bush and Anderson combined in the last four
months
Jack Mabley
Chicago Tribune
Where both parties seemed becalmed of ideas,
the Libertarians send fresh gusts . the party is
far more creative, diverse in approach, and
intellectually stimulating than either the
Democrats or Republicans,'
Nick Thimmesch
Syndicated Columist
"Ed Clark is a soft-spoken man of conviction with
ideas that criss-cross Republican-Democratic
lines and approach the public mood more directly
than anything else in generations."
Sacramento Union
"(The Libertarians) hope in fact to poll several
million votes next year, a goal they just might
achieve . . Libertarians may be able to tap a
large national constituency made up of
disaffected, frustrated, none of the above voters
Libertarian spokesmen are young, brash,
intelligent, politically stylish and rhetorically
resolute types ."
