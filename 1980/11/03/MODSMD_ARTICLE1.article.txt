# Iranians announce terms for releasing the hostages

From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Jimmy
Carter said last night that Iranian
terms for freeing the 52 American
hostages "appear to offer a positive
basis" for ending aerisis that has cast
a year-long shadow over America
But he did not say what the next step
was, or when it might betaken.
With his own election prospects at
stake, Carter pledged to the American
people that he would not make his de
cision on the Iranian terms with an eye
on the election.
At the end of a day of conferences,
he said in a televised statement he
could not predict when the hostages
would be freed.
But he promised that the United
States would strike a deal only on
terms that preserve American honor
and integrity.
"I know that all Americans will
want their return to be on a proper
basis which is worthy of the suffering
and sacrifice which the hostages have
endured." Carter said
He reported that the United States
was "pursuing the matter" through
diplomatic channels. But he did not
say whether negotiations were under
way with Iranian authorities or in
termediaries.
Campaigning in Cincinnati, Ronald
Reagan declared yesterday that "my
deepest hope" is that the American
hostages are freed by Iran, but he re
fused to discuss the situation in detail
or inject it into his campaign
"I know that as we meet here two
days before we go to the polls we all
have on our minds the matter of the
hostage situation in Iran." the Re
publican nominee said. "But let me
say this is not the time or the place for
me to be addressing such a sensitive
matter."
And in Los Angeles, independent
presidential candidate John Anderson
challenged Carter to disclose before
tomorrow "what deal is struck"
for release of the American hostages
in Iran.
He said the condition set bv the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Sep
•emher for I 7 S releaseof Iranian gov
ernment assets frozen by the United
States "is innocent sounding," but if
those assets include offensive weap
ons "that would be a matter of grave
concern."
Anderson said he believed a large
portion of the $500 million in spare
parts and weapons previously ordered
by Iran before the freeze on its assets
may fall into that category.
Frustrated by a lack of precise de
tail. the administration's top rank of
diplomatic and intelligence officers
spent the day assessing the conditions
laid down in the broadcast — releasing
$8 billion in frozen Iranian assets in
U.S. hands, cancellation of all U.S. le

gal claims against Iran, a pledge of
non-interference in Iranian affairs
and return of the property of the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
said the release of the hostages by
tomorrow may not be possible.
Former Iranian Foreign Minister
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said it would be
"physically impossible."
Muskie warned publicly on Satur
day that time-consuming negotiations
would be needed before the 52 Ameri
cans could be freed. He repeated that
point yesterday in a television in
terview. warning that clarifications of
the Iranian demands would be sought
before negotiations could even begin
There were two sharp disappoint
ments in the document published in
Tehran yesterday that left officials fa
miliar with the crisis shaking their
heads.
The first was the suggestion that the
hostages might be released in phases,
rather than all at once, as the United
States has insisted, and as Muskie
himself insisted again yesterday.
The second obvious disappointment
was the revival in the document of the
threat that some or all of the hostages
would be tried as spies if the United
States refused to accept the Iranian
conditions.
As recently as his Saturday news
conference. Muskie expressed muted
optimism that "the question of trials
has sort of dropped out of their
rhetoric for some time now. so we
don't have as much concern about
that."
On the other hand, there was an ele
ment in the Majlis document that U.S.
officials found significant and en
courging: the omission of a specific
call for release of the U.S. military
equipment or spare parts previously
bought and paid for by the regime of
the late shah.
Administration officials had feared
that sending weapons to Iran as part of
the hostage deal might damage Amer
ican interests in the Arab world,
which has been divided over the nearly
six-week-old Iran-Iraqi war.
Only the first condition, which
Muskie himself has already conceded
in public statements as well as in his
Aug. 20 letter to Iran's newly elected
Premier Mohammed Ali Rajai. ap
pears to pose no problems. This is the
demand that the United States pledge
that from now on it will "in no way in
terfere. either directly or indirectly,
politically or militarily, in the affairs
of the Islamic Republic of Iran."
The second and third conditions call
on the United States to release the es
timated $8 billion in Iranian assets
that were frozen 10 days after the
hostages were seized last Nov. 4. and
to nullify all American monetary
claims against Iran, public and

private. Meeting those conditions
could be a good deal more com
plicated.
US officials privately estimate
that a substantial portion of the
blocked assets remain under direct
control of the U.S. government, either
in the form of gold or in other instru
ments within the Federal Reserve sys
tem.
Another big chunk of the blocked as
sets are deposits in foreign branches
of U.S. banks, where they are relativ
ley immune from lawsuits in Ameri
can courts by companies or individ
uals seeking restitution from the Ira
nian government or its citizens for one
reason or another.
Finally, there is the last demand,
which Muskie and other top adminis
tration officials have tended to ingore
in their public comments, for "return
of the assets of the cursed shah," as
the Majlis document put it yesterday.
