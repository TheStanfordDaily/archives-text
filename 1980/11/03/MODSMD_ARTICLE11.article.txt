## Students are living in bondage 
### 
— Slavery in the United States today 0 At such a
prestigious institution as Stanford 0
Look in the mirror and there is a good chance
that you'll be looking at a case of human bondage
— Who me 0 I'm no one's slave
That's just it You and I are no one person's ser
vants — we're everyone's slaves
— How so 0 I'm getting a Stanford diploma so
that I'll be the one running things instead of the
one being run around
What we don't realize is that our culture
teaches the individual to link his feeling of self
control to outside sources of approval Instead of
gaining power by turning inward to develop
ourselves, we turn outward, trying to manipulate
others to boost our feeling of control: we're de
pendent on their opinion of a Stanford diploma
rather than on our own confidence in the extent to
which that education has prepared us.
And unfortunately, the educational system
itself plays a central role in teaching us to strive
to meet external standards. From the day we
enter kindergarten, we learn that it is not the
pleasure the students get from their achieve
ments that count, but the judgement of the om
nipotent teacher, whose "A," "B." "C," "D" or
"F" they bring home to their parents Very early
in our school career we start to transfer the
source of our pleasure from our work to its ex
ternal approval
By the time we reach high school, the number of
teachers to satisfy has increased five-fold and we
become consciously aware of the fact that the key
to good grades is not necessarily to work hard, but
rather to figure out the teacher's method: reading
the textbook is jr.r.ecessary — cramming on the
handouts the nigh: before the exam will guarantee
an "A." And the '.£>> effort weput intoaclass. the
more pleased we A - e :o ge: a high grade: "I got an
"A + " on this pare: I cranked out in an hour-and-a
half the night before it was due"'
It is no longer knowledge we're acquiring, but
the knack of appearing to have done so The true
source of satisfaction — our self-improvement
has been severed from the external judgement.
And we use the latter as a crutch to uphold our no
tion of self-worth
The culmination of our years of impression
creating comes when college application time
rolls around The student finds himself at the
mercy of the enormous, faceless, "objective"
judge — E.T.S. — and its whole battery of tests
measuring the student's "potential." Of course
we loudly declare that the tests don't really mean
anything: but when we score higher than most of
our classmates, we are secretly overjoyed to find
such a flattering yardstick of inner-value.
The next hurdle is to sell ourselves to the col
leges. We move from catering to an individual — a
teacher — to faceless numbers — admission com
mittees. And the control we have over our lives
decreases as the number of people we give
judgement power to increases. Instead of seeing
ourselves as buyers of an education, we become
sellers of our ability to create an impression on
paper.
We hold our breath waiting to hear if Stanford
thinks our application — which we equate with
ourselves — is good enough to merit the honor of
spending $10,000 a year to attend. And we pat

ourselves on the back when we hear of our accep
tance. telling ourselves we must really be some
thing special if Stanford gives us the nod of ap
proval
So here we are: by honesty, trickery, or sheer
luck, we've made it into Stanford, a prestigious
"institution of higher learning " We're paying an
enormous sum of money to educate ourselves and.
as intelligent consumers, we're determined to get
the most for our dollar As mature college stu
dents. we have taken our lives into our own hands,
determined what we want to do and now stand by
our decision on the strength of our personal inte
grity, right 0
The sad fact is that more often we simply
transfer the power we gave to teachers. SATs.
Achievements, APs and college admission com
mittees to professors, LSATs. MCATs. GMATs
and graduate school admission committees We
take easy courses to pad our GPA and avoid the
challenging courses out of fear of failure — in eve
ryone else's eyes but our own So accustomed are
we to relying on others for proof of our value that
our knees buckle at the thought of relinquishing
the crutch of external measurements
The worst is that we delude ourselves into
thinking, "Just as soon as I get into grad school. I
can stop worrying about grades and test scores "
Let's not kid ourselves. Routed on an external
track, once we make it over the grad school ad
mission hurdle, by necessity, we'll find another —
for example, securing a well-paving job. After
grades and test scores have dropped out of the pic
ture, we'll replace them with income and in
fluence
Midway in our career when we discover that
we're internally dissatisfied, we'll be unable to
find the reason for our feeling of emptiness. "I'm
successful I make a sizeable income, have two
cars, a nice house and a summer retreat. What
more could I ask for 9 " What we should ask for. if
we haven't lost the power to do so. is to have our
own lives back — but by then our sources of inner
strength will be debilitated by disuse. So con
cerned with "making something" of our lives in
college, we'll later find ourselves empty-handed
and lacking the skills to remedy the situation.
As intelligent Stanford students we should have
sense enough to avoid the wide-spread "middle
age crisis" — but only if we act now. In the long
run. grades, test scores — even where we went to
school—will be immaterial: the way we used the
opportunities to develop ourselves will be their
only lasting influence As intelligent consumers,
we should use this education to free ourselves
from the opinions of others rather than bind
ourselves to a life of impression-creating.
Stanford's widespread grade inflation has been
the source of much concern recently: it is claimed
that the faculty is too easy on us. On the contrary,
I would argue that we are too easy on the faculty:
we should be demanding them to push us to the
frontiers of our abilities, creating a learning situ
ation for both teacher and student. Only by taking
the power of judgement into our own hands and
supporting ourselves on personal integrity can we
claim to be truly running things instead of being
run around

from the opinions of others rather than bind
ourselves to a life of impression-creating.
Stanford's widespread grade inflation has been
the source of much concern recently: it is claimed
that the faculty is too easy on us. On the contrary,
I would argue that we are too easy on the faculty:
we should be demanding them to push us to the
frontiers of our abilities, creating a learning situ
ation for both teacher and student. Only by taking
the power of judgement into our own hands and
supporting ourselves on personal integrity can we
claim to be truly running things instead of being
run around

prestigious institution as Stanford 0
Look in the mirror and there is a good chance
that you'll be looking at a case of human bondage

That's just it You and I are no one person's ser
vants — we're everyone's slaves
— How so 0 I'm getting a Stanford diploma so
that I'll be the one running things instead of the
one being run around
What we don't realize is that our culture
teaches the individual to link his feeling of self
control to outside sources of approval Instead of
gaining power by turning inward to develop
ourselves, we turn outward, trying to manipulate
others to boost our feeling of control: we're de
pendent on their opinion of a Stanford diploma
rather than on our own confidence in the extent to
which that education has prepared us.
And unfortunately, the educational system
itself plays a central role in teaching us to strive
to meet external standards. From the day we
enter kindergarten, we learn that it is not the
pleasure the students get from their achieve
ments that count, but the judgement of the om
nipotent teacher, whose "A," "B." "C," "D" or
"F" they bring home to their parents Very early
in our school career we start to transfer the
source of our pleasure from our work to its ex
ternal approval
By the time we reach high school, the number of
teachers to satisfy has increased five-fold and we
become consciously aware of the fact that the key
to good grades is not necessarily to work hard, but
rather to figure out the teacher's method: reading
the textbook is jr.r.ecessary — cramming on the
handouts the nigh: before the exam will guarantee
an "A." And the '.£>> effort weput intoaclass. the
more pleased we A - e :o ge: a high grade: "I got an
"A + " on this pare: I cranked out in an hour-and-a
half the night before it was due"'
It is no longer knowledge we're acquiring, but
the knack of appearing to have done so The true
source of satisfaction — our self-improvement
has been severed from the external judgement.
And we use the latter as a crutch to uphold our no
tion of self-worth
The culmination of our years of impression
creating comes when college application time
rolls around The student finds himself at the
mercy of the enormous, faceless, "objective"
judge — E.T.S. — and its whole battery of tests
measuring the student's "potential." Of course
we loudly declare that the tests don't really mean
anything: but when we score higher than most of
our classmates, we are secretly overjoyed to find
such a flattering yardstick of inner-value.
The next hurdle is to sell ourselves to the col
leges. We move from catering to an individual — a
teacher — to faceless numbers — admission com
mittees. And the control we have over our lives
decreases as the number of people we give
judgement power to increases. Instead of seeing
ourselves as buyers of an education, we become
sellers of our ability to create an impression on
paper.
We hold our breath waiting to hear if Stanford
thinks our application — which we equate with
ourselves — is good enough to merit the honor of
spending $10,000 a year to attend. And we pat

ourselves on the back when we hear of our accep
tance. telling ourselves we must really be some
thing special if Stanford gives us the nod of ap
proval
So here we are: by honesty, trickery, or sheer
luck, we've made it into Stanford, a prestigious
"institution of higher learning " We're paying an
enormous sum of money to educate ourselves and.
as intelligent consumers, we're determined to get
the most for our dollar As mature college stu

transfer the power we gave to teachers. SATs.

take easy courses to pad our GPA and avoid the
challenging courses out of fear of failure — in eve

we to relying on others for proof of our value that
our knees buckle at the thought of relinquishing
the crutch of external measurements
The worst is that we delude ourselves into
thinking, "Just as soon as I get into grad school. I
can stop worrying about grades and test scores "
Let's not kid ourselves. Routed on an external
track, once we make it over the grad school ad
mission hurdle, by necessity, we'll find another —
for example, securing a well-paving job. After
grades and test scores have dropped out of the pic
ture, we'll replace them with income and in

Midway in our career when we discover that
we're internally dissatisfied, we'll be unable to
find the reason for our feeling of emptiness. "I'm

As intelligent Stanford students we should have
sense enough to avoid the wide-spread "middle
