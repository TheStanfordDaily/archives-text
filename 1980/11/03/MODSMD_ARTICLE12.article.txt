# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Chuck Olson Olson: alternative to standard politics 
### 
There is a third candidate in
the race for the 21st Assembly
District who was not even men
tioned in the front page article
on the race last Wednesday
(Daily. Oct. 29). My name is
Chuck Olson, and I am a third
year graduate student here at
Stanford in molecular biology. I
am running as a Libertarian
candidate to give voters a real
alternative to the standard poli
tics of the two major parties.
In contrast to my two oppo
nents. I base my stands in favor
of individual liberty and nut in
favor of a large, paternalistic
government. Throughout my
candidacy. I have proposed spe
cific. practical proposals to
bring about a political decen
tralization. taking power away
from Sacramento and returning
it to individual people. Here is a
brief summary of my platform:
1 Repeal of all victimless
crime laws. The government
has no right to interfere in the
private lives of peaceful
citizens. Furthermore, govern
ment prohibition of peaceful ac
tivities such as drug use can
create whole new problems
such as the involvement of or
ganized crime in supplying
drugs on a black market, and the
squandering of police resources
to spy on peaceful citizens.
2 Elimination of subsidies to
business and agriculture. This is
nothing less than welfare for the
politically powerful. Businesses
should support themselves in
the marketplace by producing
goods and services that people
want to buy.
3. Educational tax credits. I
believe that the deterioration of
the public schools is directly at
tributable to the fact that they
do not have to compete for their
funds or their students. I sup
port educational tax credits to
allow parents and students
more choice over what sort of
education they receive. Greater
competition in our educational
system can only improve the
quality of education.
4 Repeal of occupational
licensing laws. These laws

make it very difficult to enter
regulated professions For in
stance, to get a barber's license,
you must spend $1500 tuition and
nine months as a full-time stu
dent at an official California
Barber College. Licensing laws
such as this hurt the poor by
blocking their entry into a par
ticular field; and they reduce
the number of barbers, restrict
competition and cause
higher prices for everyone. The
only people who benefit are
those who are established in the

regulated field, and they are the
ones who lobby for these vicious
laws.
5. Repeal of the sales tax.
This tax falls most heavily on
those least able to pay. Let's
start our tax cutting here.
The two major parties pledge
to solve our problems, but one
must realize that every action
they take is at the expense of
someone's productive effort
(without their consent of
course) and is necessarily a loss
of our freedom. Freedom, on

the other hand, does not pledge
to solve our problems. But it
does let us keep our time, our ef
forts, our earnings, our lives so
that we can work together, vol
untarily. cooperatively, to solve
our problems
I urge you to consider my Lib
ertarian candidacy.

graduate student in molecular

didate for the 21st Assembly
District.)
