## 'Are you listening, Anderson voters?' 
### 
President Reagan.
President Ronald Reagan
Ronald Rav-gun. President of
the United States, commander
in-chief of the armed forces,
head of state, maker of foreign
policy, leader of the free world,
defender of the faith.
Get used to this nightmare; it
may last a long time.
I think I'll go and stick my
head in the oven: get it over with
quickly and painlessly. I don't
need four years of political in
digestion.
Is there anybody out there as
frightened of Reagan as I am?

Are you listening, Anderson
voters? Let's look at the picture
as it stands. In order for the
election to be thrown into the
House of Representatives, An
derson (or Barry Commoner)
must win at least one state.

Massachusetts. Connecticut.
Maybe. But not California. No
way. Not this time. It's a two
horse race in the Golden State,
and it will be tight. Four points
the last time I heard. Anything
under five the last few days
means it can go either way.
Either way means Carter or Re
agan. Period Sorry about that.
In a tight race such as this
one. Anderson or Commoner
votes are principled, cathartic
and absolutely coun
terproductive. To cast a Califor
nia vote for either of the minor
candidates, or for that matter
Clark. Spock. Gus Hall or any
body else is simply to hand the
state's 45 electoral votes to
Bonzo. Can you dig it?
Are you listening. Anderson
voters? You can't make
progress while your ass is being
kicked all over the country. Nuff

said. . . .

"The consequence of a Re
agan presidency is not simply
the quality of men he appoints to
the Supreme Court. It is the im
position at the highest levels of
our government of an out
moded. right-wing social
philosophy that evinces no com
passion for working-class peo
ple. racial minorities, or the
less privileged Ronald Reagan
is saying all those things George
Wallace was proclaiming but he
is obviously sincere and so
warmingly engaging that no one
can accuse him of racist dema
goguerv."
So writes Leon Litwak. UC-
Berkelev history professor, in
the Daily Californian on Octo
ber 17 He goes on:
"To support John Anderson is
to support an individual whose
record and utterance place him
firmly in the orthodox wing of
the Republican Party. To think
of voting for him as a protest, or
as some kind of committment to
progressive principles is to ig
nore his entire political career.
I am less concerned with his
own discarded effort to trans
form the United States into a
Christian nation than I am with
a record which, like Reagans,
suggests a crass indifference to
the plight of the less privileged.
"He opposed medicare and
lifting limits on cost-of-living in
creases on social-security bene
fits. He voted to reduce the min
imum wage, and four times op
posed increases in the minimum
wage.
"He voted several times to
undermine the trade union
movement by making it more
difficult for workers to engage
in effective strike action, union
organizing and collective

bargaining.
"He opposed the food stamp
program, and voted to deny food
stamps to striking workers. He
opposed extending unemploy
ment compensation to migrant
workers.
"He opposed legislation de
signed to combat air and water
pollution, and he voted against
establishing a Consumer Pro
tection Agency.
"These cuts and others con
firmed him as. in his own words,
'a plain, old fashioned, orthodox
Republican.' His record on nu
clear power prompted the
League of Conservation Voters
to call him one of the most ef
fective and articulate spokes
men for the nuclear industry in
the entire House.' If there is a
'new' Anderson, as the media
and liberals insist, the can
didate himself is not as certain:
. I have not left the Re
publican Party. I simply mean I
haven't given up all the things I
have voted for and have sup
ported over the years."
' 'The choice are clear enough.
To defeat Carter is to elevate to
the White House the mentality
of Ronald Reagan and his crowd
— that is. the political fun
damentalists. the racial bigots,
the moral prosecutors and
censors, all the reactionary
forces who are prepared to use
their enhanced power, in
fluence, and credibility to in
vade and reshape every seg
ment of American life. I must
cast my vote for Carter."

Hold your nose and vote for
Carter.

Hold your nose and vote for

President Reagan.
President Ronald Reagan
Ronald Rav-gun. President of
the United States, commander
in-chief of the armed forces,
head of state, maker of foreign
policy, leader of the free world,
defender of the faith.
Get used to this nightmare; it
may last a long time.
I think I'll go and stick my
head in the oven: get it over with
quickly and painlessly. I don't
need four years of political in
digestion.
Is there anybody out there as
frightened of Reagan as I am?

Are you listening, Anderson
voters? Let's look at the picture
as it stands. In order for the
election to be thrown into the
House of Representatives, An
derson (or Barry Commoner)
must win at least one state.

Massachusetts. Connecticut.
Maybe. But not California. No
way. Not this time. It's a two
horse race in the Golden State,
and it will be tight. Four points
the last time I heard. Anything
under five the last few days
means it can go either way.
Either way means Carter or Re
agan. Period Sorry about that.
In a tight race such as this
one. Anderson or Commoner
votes are principled, cathartic
and absolutely coun
terproductive. To cast a Califor
nia vote for either of the minor
candidates, or for that matter
Clark. Spock. Gus Hall or any
body else is simply to hand the
state's 45 electoral votes to
Bonzo. Can you dig it?
Are you listening. Anderson
voters? You can't make
progress while your ass is being
kicked all over the country. Nuff

said. . . .

"The consequence of a Re
agan presidency is not simply
the quality of men he appoints to
the Supreme Court. It is the im
position at the highest levels of
our government of an out
moded. right-wing social
philosophy that evinces no com
passion for working-class peo
ple. racial minorities, or the
less privileged Ronald Reagan
is saying all those things George
Wallace was proclaiming but he
is obviously sincere and so
warmingly engaging that no one
can accuse him of racist dema
goguerv."
