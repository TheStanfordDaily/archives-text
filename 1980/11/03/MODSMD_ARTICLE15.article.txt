In reading the editorial (Dai
ly, Oct. 29) opposing proposition
10, the smoking and no-smoking
sections initiative, I found the
"limited government" argu
ment against such regulation to
be a typical oversimplification
of this issue.
This is not to say that Prop. 10
is a particularly complex ballot
measure; it is a very clear and
reasonable initiative statute

with specific provisions to pro
tect the rights of smokers and
non-smokers alike.
The problem with the Daily
argument is that it fails to rec
ognize that public health is a vi
tal policy area from which even
an admittedly "already bloated
government" cannot logically
be excluded. The documented
health hazards to non-smokers
from breathing second-hand
smoke are certainly significant
enough to merit legal protec

tion.
But if indeed the Daily is
absolutely committed to the be
lief of protecting the private
sector from big government,
then I suppose that its readers
can expect a presidential en
dorsement reflecting such a
limited government, anti-regu
lation philosophy — a Daily en
dorsement of Ronald Reagan.
