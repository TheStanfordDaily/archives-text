## You are being too idealistic Don't forget to vote! 
### 
Although Robert Greenberg has received and
should receive more strong criticism for many of
the points he made in his article, "An American
takeover would be best" (Daily. Oct. 23), I would
like to refrain from criticism at the moment and
instead use one of those points as a springboard to
address a more general problem. This problem is
frequently faced by those of us working in various
social change movements and is found in the form
of a criticism from our opponents. "You're too
idealistic," they say. "Be more realistic."
Greenberg indirectly adopts this critical stance
when defending his opinion that the United States
should annex Saudi Arabia as an "energy colony."
He says that the issue "seems to boil down to a de
cision between morality and practicality."
Morality. Practicality. Idealism. Realism.
Vague and important sounding words tossed
around by people who often don't comprehend
their meanings or proper usage. The confusion
over idealism and realism lies in the fact that the
statement, "You're being too idealistic and not
realistic enough," is made in two different situ
ations with two very different meanings. Take,
for example, the meanings to an activist who sup
ports immediate shutdown of all nuclear power
plants in the U.S.
In one case, the proponent of nuclear power
says, "You're being too idealistic. We can't just
shut down all operating plants now. The American
economy would crumble! Thousands would lose
their jobs, and we wouldn't have the energy we
need to produce commodities necessary for liv
ing." Here, he has simply misused the word ideal
ism. What he's actually saying is that those who
would have us cease production of nuclear power
now are being unrealistic in their demands. He be
lieves that they haven't looked closely at the
harmful consequences of the actions they're call
ing for.
In the second case, the critic thinks that the
anti-nuclear activist is being unreasonable in re
fusing to compromise some of his or her beliefs
when, as Greenberg states, "the ond does justify
the means." He (the nuclear energy supporter)
would argue. "You're being too idealistic. It's
nice and pretty to talk about a cleaner environ
ment. but we're going to have to sacrifice that
idea a bit if our nation is to survive and prosper.
There may be risks and some pollution that come
with nuclear power, but they are necessary evils
that will have to be lived with if we expect to be
able to produce the energy that we need."
To this person, realism means seeing that there
are some situations that call for us to compromise
beliefs to serve the greater common good.
It's exceedingly important that we see the dis
tinction between these two criticisms, because
both are often put forth under the same words:
"You're being too idealistic." Not only are they
fairly representative of the types of attacks made

on many social change movements, but they also
give us clues as to how to respond when faced with
such criticisms.
It's obvious in the first-case that the anti-nucle
ar activist must defend his analysis, program of
action, and goals, rather than his ideals, against
the criticism. He must show his opponents that his
ideas are realistic and workable. "We are being
realistic. True, immediate cessation of nuclear
power production would cause huge economic up
heaval. but the loss of life and property resulting
from a major nuclear accident would be an even
greater and more long-term upheaval. Better that
10,000 citizens lose their jobs than possibly their
lives!" he would say.
In the second case, the nuclear supporter as
sumes that we must sometimes compromise our
beliefs for the common good, an assumption that
most people would actually agree with. Most of us
do compromise our beliefs to some extent on a
fairly regular basis. To name a couple of ex
amples. we obey laws that we don't necessarily
approve of, such as the 55 mph speed limit, be
cause we're concerned with preserving public re
spect of the law. and we vote for a presidential
candidate who may not be qualified to hold office
because we think he won't hurt the country as
much as his opponent would were he elected.
Our friends arguing over nuclear energy may
well agree that the energy shortage in America to
day is a crisis that calls for compromise of beliefs.
Given that they agree on this point, the anti-nucle
ar activist can answer the criticism. "You're
being too idealistic," by saying, "I am not. I agree
that we'll have to make sacrifices if we're to over
come this energy shortage, but we should try to
sacrifice those things which are least central and
necessary to us. America should reorder its val
ues so that protection of the people and land takes
priority over economic growth and plush comfort.
Better to have everyone sacrifice some luxuries
than to sacrifice lives and the environment."
In both cases, the anti-nuclear activist is able to
effectively respond to the criticism, because he
can distinguish which of the two ways his oppo
nent is using it.
Being idealistic means having a vision of the
world you would like to live in and working
towards that vision. Being realistic involves at
tempting to include as many facts and variables
about a situation as you can in analyzing that situ
ation and determining your response to it.
There are those in whom we find idealism but
little realism. But. the two qualities can be com
patible. Once we realize that, we can begin to
break down the wall of misconception that has
been built by those who tell us, "You're being too
idealistic."
