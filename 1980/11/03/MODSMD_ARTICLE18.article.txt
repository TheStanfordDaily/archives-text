## Carter leads in popular vote polls Electoral vote victory possible for Reagan 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Ronald Re
agan has the pieces in place and
the machinery to deliver a Re
publican presidential victory
tomorrow.
About all that can save Jim
my Carter's job is the return of
the hostages from Iran or some
other event that persuades large
majorities of the undecided and
John Anderson voters in about a
dozen key states that they want
to see Carter — not Reagan — in

the White House.
That is the message of a final
pre-election, state-by-state
wrap-up by The Washington
Post. The report is based on the
judgments of professional poli
ticians in both parties, the re
ports of correspondents in all 50
states, and a variety of private
and public polls.
Although Carter has a narrow
lead in some recent national
polls, including one by The
Washington Post, it appears

possible that Reagan could win
an electoral vote victory.
The Post wrap-up shows the
former California governor
ahead this weekend in 22 states
with 207 electoral votes — just
63 short of the 270 needed for vic
tory. President Carter went into
the final 48 hours leading in 15
states and the District of Colum
bia with 163 electoral votes.
Thirteen states with 168 elec
toral votes were rated too close
to call. To salvage the election

that Reagan clearly would have
won if the voting had taken
place in the past 48 hours,
Carter needs to win two-thirds
of the electoral votes in the
tossup category As a practical
matter, that probably means he
must win three of the four big
Great Lakes states that have 99
of those votes.
In trying to block Reagan
from annexing those last 70
votes for victory, Carter faces
two serious problems — leakage
of support in his Southern base
and the inability of the old liber
al-labor coalition to mobilize as
overwhelmingly for him as it
has done for Democrats in the
past.
The polls also show the seri
ousness of the problem that An
derson's independent candidacy
represents to Carter. By offer
ing a haven for those reluctant
to choose between Carter and
Reagan, Anderson is shrinking
Carter's margins in the North
east, jeopardizing his chances in
such states as Connecticut and
New Jersey and — on the other
coast — creating a roadblock for
Carter in Oregon and Washing

ton.
But the Anderson vote cuts
both ways It is one of the rea
sons Reagan has had a hard
time locking up Illinois And it is
bleeding him in such northern
New England states as Maine
and Vermont to the point that
they are possible Carter pick
ups.
The Post roundup has some
slightly optimistic implications
for Carter partisans. It clearly
indicates that the election
tomorrow is not locked up for
Reagan, no matter how good his
odds if the voting had been held
in the "halo" of his per
formance in the debate.
The numbers show that, con
trary to the claims of some Re
agan strategists, Carter does
not have to sweep the Great
Lakes states plus California in
order to win. He could lose Cali
fornia, Texas. Florida and New
Jersey and still have a reason
able crack at victory if he could
keep Reagan from winning
more than one state in the band
from New York to Illinois and
Wisconsin.
