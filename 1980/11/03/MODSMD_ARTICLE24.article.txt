# Elway, Margerum, Nelson throw big knockout punches
## Cards mercilessly maul Oregon State 
### Ivan Maisel 
If nothing else. Stanford's
54-13 mauling of Oregon State
Saturday proved college foot
ball is at the mercy of the clock
The thing about football is
that you have to play all 60
minutes If this had been box
ing. the referee would have
stopped the fight at 2 08 of the
first quarter, when Stanford
scored its second touchdown of
the game on its sixth offensive
play.
But since the game had to be
played out. the 43.294 onlookers
at Stanford Stadium were at the
mercv of the timekeeper If you
were there, than you know the
afternoon went slower than a
Saturday night in Eight Mile.
Ala.
The only people enjoying
themselves were the guys in the
red and white jerseys, particu
larly those on the offense. John
Elway continued to prove why
he is the best college quarter
back in the country with his sec
ond consecutive record-break
ing game.
Elway completed 26 of 33
passes for 314 yards and six
touchdowns, snapping both the
single-game and season league
records for touchdown passes
The sophomore now has 25 scor
ing tosses, three better than ex-

Dils' total two years ago
Elway. who tied the Pac-10 re
cord for one game with five
touchdown passes last week

against Washington State,
snapped the mark Saturday.
Not only that, he has two
games left to play Not bad for a
guy who has started nine games
in his collegiate career
"I said in the spring we would
not trade John Elway for any
quarterback in the country and
a lot of people thought I was
crazy." Stanford head coach
Paul Wiggin said after the
game "Eleven touchdowns in
two weeks That's not bad
Darrin Nelson and Ken
Margerum joined in on Satur
day's offensive bonanza Nelson

Washington State's Hugh
Campbell on the all-time league
list In addition, the fleet half
back ran for 136 yards in 16 car

game
Margerum caught four touch
down passes, thus snapping the
old Pac-10 and Stanford record
of three scoring receptions in
one game which he and many
others held With 31 scoring
catches. Margerum is only
three short of the NCAA record
of 34 held by Elmo Wright.
Margerum broke up a
crowded room of reporters
when he said, "The four touch
downs came so fast I don't re
member but two or three of
them " The Cards scored the

first five times they had the ball
in less than 17 minutes The one
big post-game question was
"Was it as easy as it looked?"
"It was easy They weren't a
real good football team,"
Elway said "It was one of those
days when everything went
right You get to the point where
you don't want to humiliate the
other team "
Said Andre Tyler, who had a
touchdown catch of his own
"Their effort was there but the
thing is they don't have much
talent Their size is really hold

Oregon State Joe Avezzano.

Margerum made it 13-0. and
Naber's extra-point attempt
was wide
It took the Cards eight and six
plays, respectively, to score on
their next two drives Elway
hooked up with Margerum each
time, from 11 and three yards
out After the third touchdown,
LaMott Atkins was stopped
short on the try for two points,
from which point on Stanford
went back to Ken Naber's foot
for its extra points
Though it was 26-0 and 3:44
was left to play in the first quar
ter. Oregon State was just
laying in daisies compared to
what was to come The Beaver
offense showed signs of coming
to life, getting its initial first
down and a subsequent ovation
from the well-mannered crowd
Two plays later, disaster
came in a gift-wrapped package
to the Beavers. Randy Hunter
shook off a tackier on a swing
pass and rambled down the side
line to the Stanford 10. where
Kevin Baird popped the ball
loose and into the hands of Wil
liams.
Had enough? Just one more:
four plays later. Vincent White
fumbled at the Stanford 32 and
Oregon State recovered, only to
be called on a defensive face
mask violation, a penalty which
occurs about as often as bubonic
plague. Thus reprieved, Stan

ford took seven more plays to
score, with Elway going to
Margerum for their last touch
down. from the 7-yard line
Oregon State quickly capital
ized on Derek Warren's in
terception at the Stanford 31
midway through the second
quarter to score in two plavs
Beaver fullback Tony Robinson,
who finished with only 65 yards,
got 16 of them on a scoring run
Robinson also scored Oregon
State's other touchdown, a third
quarter burst from three yards
out which made the score 40-13
Stanford scored early in the
third quarter when Elway hit
Tyler over the middle for a 27-
yard touchdown pass.
Only when it was 40-13 did the
game have its moments of ex
citement. Stanford cornerback
Kevin Baird made a leaping in
terception of a Singler pass at
the Beaver 35. then made a
Nelson-like sideline dash to the
end zone, cutting inside at the 5-
yard line to go into the end zone
The final score of the game
was a product of the Stanford
bench Phil Wilson directed the
Cards on a 43-vard, 12-plav drive
that ended when rarely-used
halfback Jon Carroll slithered
into the end zone on a fourth
and-goal from the four
The Stanford bench erupted in
a show of affection for one of its
own, rushing out onto the field to
greet a happy Carroll.

went back to Ken Naber's foot
for its extra points
Though it was 26-0 and 3:44
was left to play in the first quar
ter. Oregon State was just
laying in daisies compared to
what was to come The Beaver
offense showed signs of coming
to life, getting its initial first
down and a subsequent ovation
from the well-mannered crowd
Two plays later, disaster
came in a gift-wrapped package
to the Beavers. Randy Hunter
shook off a tackier on a swing
pass and rambled down the side
line to the Stanford 10. where
Kevin Baird popped the ball
loose and into the hands of Wil
liams.
Had enough? Just one more:
four plays later. Vincent White
fumbled at the Stanford 32 and
Oregon State recovered, only to
be called on a defensive face
mask violation, a penalty which
occurs about as often as bubonic
plague. Thus reprieved, Stan

ford took seven more plays to
score, with Elway going to
Margerum for their last touch
down. from the 7-yard line
Oregon State quickly capital
ized on Derek Warren's in
terception at the Stanford 31
midway through the second
quarter to score in two plavs
Beaver fullback Tony Robinson,
who finished with only 65 yards,
got 16 of them on a scoring run
Robinson also scored Oregon
State's other touchdown, a third
quarter burst from three yards
out which made the score 40-13
Stanford scored early in the
third quarter when Elway hit
Tyler over the middle for a 27-
yard touchdown pass.
Only when it was 40-13 did the
game have its moments of ex
citement. Stanford cornerback
Kevin Baird made a leaping in
terception of a Singler pass at
the Beaver 35. then made a
Nelson-like sideline dash to the
end zone, cutting inside at the 5-
yard line to go into the end zone
The final score of the game
was a product of the Stanford
bench Phil Wilson directed the
Cards on a 43-vard, 12-plav drive
that ended when rarely-used
halfback Jon Carroll slithered
into the end zone on a fourth
and-goal from the four
The Stanford bench erupted in
a show of affection for one of its
own, rushing out onto the field to
greet a happy Carroll.
Then again, maybe they were
just glad someone had broken
the monotony.
