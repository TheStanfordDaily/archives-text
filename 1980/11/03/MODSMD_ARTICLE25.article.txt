# Poloists triumph in a stale Cakewalk, 11-4
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
It was just another one of
those routine cakewalks at de-
Guerre Pool. A relatively un
inspired Stanford water polo
team defeated UC-Davis 11-4
Saturday. The Cardinals remain
right on the track to an NCAA

championship with an overall
record of 22-1-1. and a Pacific-10

If (iter polo

record of 3-0.
The rout was due less to out

standing play on the Cards' part
as it was to general sloppiness
on the part of UC-Davis Stan
ford head coach Dante Det
tamanti. for one. was not overly
impressed with the final score.
"We played okay," he said
with a shrug. "When you have

had a lot of high pressure games
it's, nice to have a breather. I
can't expect the guys to play at
the same emotional level all the
time. There was no incentive in
this game; I think they played
as well as they could under the
circumstances."
Alan Mouchawar scored
almost immediately for Stan
ford with a bullet from the right
post, while UC-Davis prac
ticed wild passes and virtual in
effectiveness. Of its first fiveof
fensive attempts, four failed as
no member of the team was able
to get a shot off before the 35â€”
second clock ran out.
Stanford's own offense
seemed to be dragged down to
Davis' level as the first quarter
progressed. With 2:21 remain
ing the Cards had yet to score
again, and an irked Dettamanti
called time out. The team re
acted almost immediately;
Jodv Campbell slid into the hole
position, tossed the ball over the
head of a single defender, re
trieved it.and flipped it into the
goal. With 11 seconds remaining
Mouchawar again found an
opening on the right side and
scored with a short bullet. UC-
Davis was able to penetrate the
middle onlv once to score, and

the quarter ended, 3-1.
After this comparatively slow
start the Cards cracked the
game wide open, scoring four
times in the second quarter.
Alan and Maurice Mouchawar
played "Family Affair," ac
counting for all of the goals, hit
ting two each.
The contest became a bit
more even in the second half;
Stanford outscored Davis by
only one goal, 4-3. The two
teams traded fast breaks and
counter-attacks, a type of game
that Davis seemed a bit more
comfortable with.
Greg Lambert and Campbell
accounted for the Cards' two
third-quarter goals. Lambert
took a long pass from goalie
John Gansel and skipped the
ball into the goal on a fast break,
and Campbell hit from the in
side right corner, an obviously
weak spot in the Davis defense.
Davis seemed a bit more in
control of its offense in the sec
ond half, scoring once from the
hole, but missing on its most
promising fast-break chance of
the quarter. Gansel went so far
as to grin rather evilly when he
saw the oncoming play before
blocking the shot.
