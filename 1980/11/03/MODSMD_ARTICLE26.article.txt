## 
### Richard Martinez 
Sir*' Stanford's football
team voided to break with the
tradition of playing down to its
opponent, the Cardinal soccer
squad decided to pick up the
slack Consequently, an inferior
St Mary's team extended Stan
ford to two overtimes before the
Cards prevailed. 5-3. Saturday

Soccer

at Malonev Field.
Coming off of last Sunday's
superb performance against
Santa Clara. Stanford was in
danger of taking the Gaels too
lightly. Although vastly im
proved since last year. St.
Mary's could hardly be con
sidered in the same league with
such teams as San Jose. Stan
ford and Santa Clara.
"My toughest job," said Stan

ford head coach Nelson Lodge,
"is to get the guys up for the
teams like St. Mary's. Sacra
mento and Stanislaus State. We
have no trouble getting up for
San Jose State and USF, but it's
the teams considered doormats
that make it hard to psyche up."
It was Stanford, however,
who almost had the rug pulled
out from under itself when the
Gaels scored the game's first
foal with only 30 seconds gone,
he tally came on a penalty kick
following a controversial call by
the officials.
And although the Cards con
trolled the ball for almost 35
minutes of the first half. St.
Mary's entered halftime with a
2-0 lead. The Gaels' second
score came with 10 minutes left
in the first period on a shot that
miraculously managed its way
past goalie Jeff Jones.
"They kind of caught us off

guard." said senior Peter Phil
lips. "They're a completely dif
ferent team than last year, with
a lot of talented freshmen. They
were playing with greater emo
tion."
Stanford was also plaving
without star forward Willie
Giucci, who suffered a hip
pointer in last week's Santa
Clara game Jorge Titinger was
also not at full strength. Lodge
decided to change his lineup
during halftime in order to
muster a successful offensive
attack
St. Mary's entered the game
knowing that Giucci was injured
and that Stanford gets very lit
tle scoring from its midfield.
Thus, by playing forwards Ted
Rafaiovicn and Titinger man
for-man. the Gaels successfully
kept Stanford out of the goal for
the first 45 minutes.
They were not to be so for
tunate for the remainder of the
contest. Phillips was moved
from his fullback position to join
Rafalovich and Titinger at for
ward. Thereafter the Cards en
joyed greater movement from
their strikers and many more
shots on goal.
Stanford's first goal came
with two minutes gone in the
second period. Phillips went to
the right side. Rafalovich came
to the middle and scored on Tit
inger's assist.
Midway through the second
half the Cards evened the score

on the first of Phillips' two
goals.
Momentum seemed to have
shifted totally when Neil Ten
nyson hit Titinger one minute
later on a through-pass. The
freshman striker then hit a
beautiful shot high into the net.
St. Mary's came back, how
ever, to tie the Cards with 30
seconds to play on a crossing
shot.
After a scoreless first over
time period. Stanford scored
twice in the second overtime.
Rafalovich connected on a
crossing lob to Phillips, who
headed it into the goal and Stan
ford put it away on Walter King
son's vollev shot.
