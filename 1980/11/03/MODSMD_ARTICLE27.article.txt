# OSU: losing games becomes a habit
## 
### Robert Stone 
"Everyone loves a winner." Unfortunately for Oregon State's
football team, nobody ever invented a saying for losers.
For the seventh straight time Saturday, the Beavers were on the
low end of a high-scoring game, losing to the Cardinals 54-13 at Stan
ford Stadium. Being plowed under every weekend has become an
unavoidable and quite undesired part of life for them Their closest
margin of defeat all season has been 10 points As the season wears
on. though, it's a fact they have learned to cope with.
"After a game (like Saturday's) you have to forget it. You can't
worry about it, you have to come back and think about the next
week's game. It's not going to help to dwell on it. not at all." was
how Beaver fullback Tony Robinson described his coping
philosophy.
His attitude was typical of the team in general. The post-game
feeling wasn't one of despair, it was embarrassment coupled with
confusion. The big mystery was, "How did we do so bad so fast?"
Halfback Randy Holmes said, "I came out of the game (in the
first quarter), sat on the bench, and the next thing I know it's 26-0.
That doesn't get you fired up."
Although the team has adjusted to taking its lumps, it hasn't got
ten used to the idea of losing on such a grand scale. Every lopsided
score gnaws on the players, and they try to figure out what went
wrong. Most of the time they start with themselves. One locker
room exchange was a case in point,
"That was the worst game I've played in 11 years of football."
"Yeah, but at least we all did it together."
There was but one person who readily accepted full responsibility
for the loss. Head coach Joe Avezzano. who acquired a taste for win
ning under Johnny Majors at Pittsburgh and Tennessee, went down
with the ship and said it was his fault it sank.
"This is a low point for me in what I contributed to the team, even
though I fully realize we don't have the individually skilled people
on offense to offset their skilled people on offense," Avezzano said.
None of the players pointed to the coach concerning the loss, how
ever. In fact, they seemed to avoid putting the coaches in a bad
light. Holmes said, "We have good coaches. At times we're good,
and other times it doesn't show."
What can be done to reverse the situation? Nobody seems to
know, but they agree it's not hopeless. "It's something we can cor
rect. and someday we will,'' Holmes said. "It's just a matter of trial
and error. I want to come out next week and play. I don't want to
leave and go somewhere else like a lot of guys would."
