"We didn't get outhustled,"
Longstreth said, before adding
the players maintained their
poise even while the team was
behind She was pleased with
the Cards' midfield play, which
includes offense and defense be
tween the 25-vard lines.
However, Chico State's de
fense was just too much for
Stanford "We weren't able to
penetrate their defense to get
the shots off." Longstreth said,
stressing Stanford's need to be
more aggressive on offense.
Senior co-captain Jeanine
Valadez agreed that the the

more powerful Chico State team
"dominated in the circle." All
of Chico's goals came on cor
ners. and indeed they had more
opportunities â€” with 11 penalty
corners to Stanford's five.
Valadez noted the Cards had
trouble posing a consistent scor
ing threat, and could not keep

pressure on Chico State by keep
ing the ball in play in the circle
in front of Chico's goal.
Chico State was bolstered this
season by the addition of five
strong players from Oregon.
Longstreth said of Chico, "They
are a very powerful, aggressive
team with added finesse this
year," and she predicted the un
defeated team has a very good
chance of winning the AIAW na
tional title in their division this
year.
Stanford ended the regular
season with a 6-8-3 record.
