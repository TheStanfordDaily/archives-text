# McCloskey, Evers in heated exchange
## House candidates debate draft 
### David Frank 
Three challengers for Rep. Paul
"Pete" McCloskey's 12th District
Congressional seat strongly criticized
the six-term incumbent 's support for a
peacetime draft last night during a de
bate in Kresge Auditorium.
McCloskey defended his position,
telling the sparse crowd of about 40
that Congress isn't maintaining an
adequate army "with an army that is
increasingly poor, increasingly pover
ty-stricken. increasingly black, and
increasingly ignorant."
The Congressman, a 1957 Stanford
law school graduate, reiterated his
call for a National Youth Service.
According to McCloskey, his pro
posal would allow four alternatives
for 18-vear-olds. One would enable a
person to escape military service by
performing one year of civilian ser
vice. Such a requirement, noted Mc-
Closkey. would let students serve the
year of civilian service over con
secutive summers to avoid interfering
with school. Two alternatives would
provide varying amounts of college
aid. depending on the time of en
listment. The fourth alternative would
make one subject to draft by lottery
for a period of six years if volunteer
and reserves quotas weren't met.
Against draft registration
McCloskey voted against President
Jimmy Carter's draft registration
plan for 19- and 20-vear-olds that was
implemented last summer.
Libertarian candidate Bill Evers
called the Youth Service "a form of

slavery," adding that he opposed 'all
forms of the draft." and draft regis
tration
Evers. who has bachelor's and mas
ter's degrees in political science from
Stanford, recommended boosting pay
incentives to meet recruitment min
imums. But he also suggested cutting
the number of armed services per
sonnel. a move he said would increase
the "quality" of the U.S. military.
Democratic candidate Kirsten
Olsen also expressed opposition to the
draft, and she demanded that U.S. al
lies in Western Europe and Japan in
crease their defense spending.
'Not enough chance'
Olsen said the volunteer army
hasn't been given "enough chance."
and she called for increases in pay and
fducational benefits
Adele Fumino. Peace and Freedom
Party candidate, denounced Mc-
Closkev's plan as "prohibitive" in
cost. The "real problems" that Con
gressmen need to address, she added,
are inflation and unemployment, "not
militarism."
Fumino also suggested that the real
intent of reinstituting the draft is to
defend multi-national corporations"
profits.
The exchanges between Evers and
McCloskev on the draft issue were the
most heated. Specifically, Evers
challenged McCloskev's contention
that a person can be compelled to do

civilian service as an alternative to
military service The representative
referred to a case in the late 1960s
when a Jehovah's witness from Illi
nois was ordered to work two years in
a state hospital in lieu of military ser
vice.
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court refused to hear
an appeal to overturn the man's work
order, noted McCloskey. This refusal,
he said, constituted the "constitu
tional law of the Supreme Court,"and
he told the audience that Evers was
"flatly wrong" to suggest otherwise
Evers then gave his side. The Su
preme Court's refusal -- or denial of
certiorari - to hear the Jehovah's wit
ness case, he said, "is absolutely no
determination of national constitu
tional law."
According to Evers. it has been said
"again and again" that under Ameri
can consitutional law. denial of a Su
preme Court hearing "carries with it
no implications whatever regarding
the Court's views on the merits of the
case. It does not remotely imply ap

proval or disapproval of what was
said" by the lower court.
"If he (McCloskev). who is an at
torney. were representing someone in
court and made this misstatement,
he'd be guilty of violating the rules of
professional conduct of the state of
California Bar "
Evers also challenged McCloskev
on the incumbent's call for putting
personal photographs and fingerprints
on social security cards Evers
claimed such a card was an uncessary
and unconstitutional invasion of per
sonal rights.
McCloskev, however, claimed the
card would reduce exploitation of the
several million alien workers through
out the country. "If we are going to
make use of four to six million people,
they are entitled to have legal rights to
which our constitution says ail per
sons in the United States are guaran
teed equal protection of the law It
doesn't have to be all U.S. citizens. If
you are going to give people rights,
you must find a way to identify these
people." he said.
