US prompted on asset return
Washington — A top economics official of the Iranian
government said yesterday that President Jimmv Carter,
using court orders, legal and legislative precedents and his
own executive powers, can lawfully meet Iran's four con
ditions for release of the hostages
White House and State Department officials were
awaiting clarification of the complex details of these con
ditions. but a high Iranian official who took part in drafting
them offered a further explanation in a telephone in
terview from Tehran
Unfreezing Iran s assets and making them available for
Iranian government use could be accomplished, the of
ficial said, bv an executive order from the president and
reliance on a court order delivered last month in New York
by Federal District Court Judge Kevin Duffy
The Iranian assets were frozen by presidential order
last Nov 14 in response to Iran's seizure of American em
bassy personnel, partly to prevent Iran from withdrawing
the billions in deposits from U S banks Since then more
than 300 banks, corporations and individuals have filed
lawsuits against the frozen assets, seeking payment for
holdings nationalized bv Iran, lost contracts and defaulted
loans that came about in the wake of the Iranian revolu
tion
When the assets were frozen these banks and corpo
rations went into court and sought legal orders, called at
tachments. that would hold the money there until the indi
vidual claims were settled
Ninety-six claim cases representing some S3 billion are
before Judge Duffy Last month, over theobjections of the
U.S. government and Iranian government lawyers. Duffy
certified the attachments on that amount of money
In his order, however. Duffy wrote that the only reason
the assets could be attached was that they were frozen by
the 1' S government and were no longer the property of
the Iranian government If the V S freeze were removed,
the judge declared, the assets would again belong to the
Tehran government and. under the legal doctrine of sov
ereign immunity, would not be subject to claims by indi
viduals or corporations

The Duffy order accepted the immunity of the Iranian
central hank funds." the Iranian official said He added
that if any claimant wants to go back into court after the
freeze is lifted and file a new claim, that action would en
danger the release of the hostages For any bank or com
pan> he said, it would be politically unwise "
The Iranian banking official said that, while it would be
difficult, the I'nited States should restore the foreign as
sets to the status that existed last Nov 13, before the
freeze and before the defaulted loans

US prompted on asset return
Washington — A top economics official of the Iranian
government said yesterday that President Jimmv Carter,
using court orders, legal and legislative precedents and his
own executive powers, can lawfully meet Iran's four con
ditions for release of the hostages
White House and State Department officials were
awaiting clarification of the complex details of these con
ditions. but a high Iranian official who took part in drafting
them offered a further explanation in a telephone in
terview from Tehran
Unfreezing Iran s assets and making them available for
Iranian government use could be accomplished, the of
ficial said, bv an executive order from the president and
reliance on a court order delivered last month in New York
by Federal District Court Judge Kevin Duffy
The Iranian assets were frozen by presidential order
last Nov 14 in response to Iran's seizure of American em
bassy personnel, partly to prevent Iran from withdrawing
the billions in deposits from U S banks Since then more
than 300 banks, corporations and individuals have filed
lawsuits against the frozen assets, seeking payment for
holdings nationalized bv Iran, lost contracts and defaulted
loans that came about in the wake of the Iranian revolu
tion
When the assets were frozen these banks and corpo
rations went into court and sought legal orders, called at
tachments. that would hold the money there until the indi
vidual claims were settled
Ninety-six claim cases representing some S3 billion are
before Judge Duffy Last month, over theobjections of the
U.S. government and Iranian government lawyers. Duffy
certified the attachments on that amount of money
In his order, however. Duffy wrote that the only reason
the assets could be attached was that they were frozen by
the 1' S government and were no longer the property of
the Iranian government If the V S freeze were removed,
the judge declared, the assets would again belong to the
Tehran government and. under the legal doctrine of sov
ereign immunity, would not be subject to claims by indi
viduals or corporations

The Duffy order accepted the immunity of the Iranian
central hank funds." the Iranian official said He added
that if any claimant wants to go back into court after the
freeze is lifted and file a new claim, that action would en
danger the release of the hostages For any bank or com
pan> he said, it would be politically unwise "
The Iranian banking official said that, while it would be
difficult, the I'nited States should restore the foreign as
