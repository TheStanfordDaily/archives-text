# How did you get in here? Hargadon also tells why it's so 'great'
## 
### Bill Beyda "Great 
It's what Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon writes on letters to every
one that accepts his Stanford ad
mission offer
Hargadon elaborated on admissions
procedure here in an interview with a
panel of reporters on KZSU's Campus
Conference last Thursday night
When questioned about what he
looks for in an application, he said he
doesn't look , 'for." rather he looks
"at" the entire application Some
schools are known to classify appli
cants according to their special tal
ents. but Hargadon said Stanford does
not He stressed the admission office
looks at the entire application, and the
final decision is based on many fac
tors These factors include high school
record, standardized test scores and
the applicant's writing ability
Another important factor, said

Hargadon. is the type of program the
student took in high school He would
rather see a student with good grades
in a rigorous academic program than
someone with outstanding grades in a
weak one. he said
According to Hargadon. geography
is not a factor in admission. In fact,
the application readers do not know
where an application is from, he ex
plained
Children of Stanford professors do
get some preferential treatment, but
no more than alumni children do
If two applicants are equally quali
fied. the admissions office may favor
the applicant with a Stanford "connec
tion."
Each year about 64 percent of those
accepted here decide to enroll. Of
those declining admission to Stanford,
one-third decide to attend Harvard.
Yale or Princeton, according to
Hargadon

Stanford receives about 13.000 ap
plications each year. Hargadon
claims that about 75 to 80 percent of
the applicants are academically quali
fied
"An awful lot of students think they
were turned down because of a
weakness — this is not the case." he
said Usually, an excellent student
just gets "beaten" by an even better
student.
Hargadon recounted a story about a
girl whose parents wrote and invited
him to her Phi Beta Kappa inaugura
tion at t : C-Berkeley. He rejected the
student four years earlier and the pa
rents still carried a grudge.
Hargadon said he was recently of
fered a $100,000 bribe to accept a stu
dent His first reaction was to laugh,
but after he finished laughing, he ac
cepted neither the bribe nor the stu
dent. he said
Athletes get no preferential treat

ment Hargadon said an athlete, a
band player and a class president all
have equal chances to gain admission
if the admissions office feels they can
make a "positive contribution to the
University " Pressure is often applied
by the Athletic Department, but he
said he doesn't listen
Minorities may get preferential
treatment. Hargadon wants to estab
lish a pattern, so that minority fami
lies will continue to come to Stanford.
Hargadon said the ideal is to create a
diverse student body without using af
firmative action A preference for mi
norities helps eliminate the problem
of "education depending on the block
(where) you live." said Hargadon
Hargadon was queried frequently
about the Scholastic Aptitude Tests
(SATs) Hargadon is chairman of the
College Board which administers the
tests. He called "truth-in-testing"
laws — which allow students in states

like New York to see their exams and
answer sheets after the tests — mis
leading These laws were enacted to
allow students, regardless of ethnic
background, to see the type of ques
tions they were asked
Hargadon said the College Board
sees several problems with these
laws. Most of the students who ask to
see their test papers are high-scoring,
upper-middle-class students, he said,
because they can afford the increased
cost of taking advantage of the law.
Also, the test is now given less fre
quently because new questions are
constantly needed.
Hargadon still feels the College
Board is correct in advising students
not to take "coaching" courses. Many
argue that courses given by Stanley
Kaplan and other test preparation ser
vices. are helping students improve
their scores But Hargadon said these
courses are teaching and not coaching

students There is no real way to coach:
a student to fool the SAT, but the
courses can teach FCnglish and math
just as high school courses can
Hargadon said.
Turning toother matters. Hargadon
agreed with the University 's stopping
out policy, because he said that if a
student took a term off and had to re
apply for entry, he might be dis
couraged and not return.
Hargadon said he would not com
pare the students of the first class he
admitted 11 years ago to those he ad
mits today But he did say that today's
high schools are better at preparing
students for college.
