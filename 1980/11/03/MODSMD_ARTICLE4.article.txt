# Anderson campaigns on supportive Peninsula

### Samuel Howe 
Citing the mock election held here
on campus last week in which he won
42.5 percent of the student vote. John
Anderson told a cheering crowd. "You
know what the saying is: as Stanford
goes, so goes the nation."
If the independent presidential can
didate hit an ironic note in his humor
— the charge that his support does not
extend past the nation's college cam
puses — neither he nor those gathered
at the University Ave. railroad depot
seemed the slightest bit bothered.
More than 2000 persons attended the
speech Saturday.
Anderson berated President Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan, his two
major opponents in the presidential
election. He urged the crowd to "vote

your future, not your fear."
The Anderson whistle-stop tour
from San Jose to San Francisco at
tracted large audiences at each of its
four stops. It ended with a rally in San
Francisco's Union Square attended by
an estimated 1500 people. The can
didate told crowds that he believed he
would make a strong showing in
northern California and would take
the state's "45 golden electoral
votes.
Going 'all the way'
"We believe we're going to go all
the way to the White House. We don't
care where you live, what party you
belong to. or what you've thought up
until now about who was going to win
this campaign. The Anderson-Lucey
ticket is the one realistic alternative

to four years of a Reagan presiden
cy."
Anderson was introduced at the
back of his 1928 vintage Pullman
coach by Palo Alto Mayor Alan Hen
derson. who told the crowd that An
derson had received the endorsement
of the major newspapers of the area,
including the San ■Jose Mercury, the
Daily, and the Peninsula Times-Trib
une.
The Illinois congressman then cited
the endorsements, as well as the ef
forts of "the thousands of volunteers
on the Peninsula who have helped to
make this just a truly great cam
paign," as evidence of his ability to
win tomorrow's national election.
Anderson told the Palo Alto crowd
"It is time to look to the future. We are

running out of resources, we are
blinded by narrow nationalism and we
are confronted bv population pres
sures which could overwhelm us all.
"But if we recognize the basic ele
ments of the problem, if we work to
gether. we can bring peaceful change
to this planet. We can end the scourge
of war. we can help to eliminate world
hunger, we can shelter those in need.''
Attacks Reagan's pollution stance
In accepting from Henderson a pa
perweight with the city emblem, a
tree. Anderson wondered aloud about
"the toxic properties that trees
possess" —a reference to recent
statements by Reagan that trees
cause the bulk of air pollution. Then
Anderson criticized Reagan's stand on
environmental issues.
Anderson had just as many harsh
words for his Democratic opponent.
He charged Carter with "libeling me,
distorting my record of almost 20
years in Congress on civil rights." and
called Carter's accusations "the act of
a very desperate campaign."
Anderson told the crowd that the
way he would advise Carter to win the
election would be to "just deny that
you've been in Washington the last
four years."
He also praised the efforts of the
Palo Alto-based Global 2000 organiza
tion. which has attempted to bring en
vironmental, population and world
land-use issues into the presidential
campaign, based on the Global 2000 re
port to the president released last
June. He said the group "has tried to
bring a new awareness. . . and I have
heard your message, and have been
talking about it in this campaign
across the country."
Although national polls give him
only about 10 percent of the popular
vote, Anderson has fared well in straw
votes around the area, such as the
Stanford poll and a sidewalk poll in
Palo Alto conducted by the Peninsula
Times-Tribune last week, which An
derson won as well.
