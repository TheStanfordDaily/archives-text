## 
### Bradley Crystal 
The position of women in the legal
profession is "wildly different" today
from what it was 30 years ago. accord
ing to U.S. Secretary of Education
Shirley Hufstedler who spoke Friday
at the law school.
When Hufstedler helped edit the
first volume of the Stanford Law Re
view in 1949. law was considered a
"single-gender profession." she told
an audience of 150.
In that year. Hufstedler was one of
two women to graduate from the Law
School and one of just seven women
admitted to the California bar.
Sees positive steps
At present, according to Hufstedler.
women are well represented through
out the legal world, a fact she regards
as a positive development.
"It's extremely good for the law. for
the judiciary, for clients and for the
body politic." said Hufstedler, who
served as a federal appeals judge in
the eight years preceding her appoint
ment to the nation's 13th cabinet level
post.
Although she expressed approval
for the increasing numbers of women
who occupy high Washington jobs.
Hufstedler also expressed concern
over "a lot of unfinished business" in
the women's revolution for equality.
Conservatives stall ERA
Calling for immediate passage of
the Equal Rights Amendment, she
said "it would take at least 25 years to
remove sexist statutes from the
books" without ERA and"it may take
100 years if the extremely con
servative legislators have their way."
Hufstedler said unreasonable fears
on the part of conservative legisla
tors' wives in states like Illinois have
stymied efforts to ratify the amend
ment
She suggested that passage of ERA
is inevitable, but that it may have to
wait until a new generation of state
legislators replaces those now in
place.
Asked what she thought of Ronald
Reagan's promise to appoint a woman
to the Supreme Court, if he is elected,
Hufstelder responded "not much "
than two percent of Reagan's
judicial appoin(ments as governor of
California were women, said the sec
retary, and of those none was above
the post of superior court judge.

But should President Jimmy Carter
be re-elected, many legal observers
predict Hufstedler will be offered a
seat on the nation's highest bench, the
Supreme Court
"People have been bringing that up
for 14 years." she said.
As to whether she would accept the
position if it were offered. Hufstedler
would only say "In the modern history
of the court no one who has been asked
has turned the job down/'
In explaining her reasons for leav
ing the federal bench to become the
first education secretary in U.S. his
tory. Hufstedler said "After being on
the bench eight years, the steepness of
my learning curve began to flatten."
While stressing that "the primary
responsibility for education is on the
state and local level." Hufstedler de
fended the need for federal control.
"Equal education opportunities and
fundamental civil rights can not be
left to the not altogether tender
motives of the local folks," she said.
"We are the last major power in the
world to create a cabinet level post on
education." she said.
One of the most important functions
of her department, said Hufstedler, is
ensuring that "students who are not fi
nancially able not be foreclosed from
the opportunity to attend the college of
their choice."
It was with that aim in mind that
Carter last week signed the Education
Amendment of 1980. a financial aid
bill, she said.
Big budget proposal
The education budget for fiscal year
1981 is $15.1 billion, but Hufstedler
said education appropriations ul
timately hinge on whether the Con
gress approves.
"Ultra-conservative" congressmen
are particularly hard to convince, she
said
"It's a steady fight to keep the
primitives from burning down the
place when you're trying to be con
structive," she said
The complexity of determining the
size of the budget also stems from the
fact that it is "difficult to estimate
how many students will apply for aid
and how many banks will grant it,"
she said
But in the long run"the policies of
the department are a driving force of
the budget and not the other way
around." she said
