## Ideologies hinder German unification 
### Gail Schares 
"There is no solution to the
current conflict between the
two Germanies as long as Eu
rope remains divided into two
ideological camps,'' Dr Lothar
Schunke, consul-general at the
West German Consulate in San
Francisco, said last Wednes
day.
Dr Schunke was one of the
speakers participating in the
fifth symposium of the World in
Crisis series The week's topic
was "The Two Germanies in the
1980s: Assessment and Predic
tion."
History Prof. Gordon Craig of
Stanford and Prof. Klaus
Hufner of the Free University in
Berlin also spoke before an au
dience of 250
Dr Schunke focused on West
German foreign policy, saying.
"NATO. East-West relations
and the European Economic
Community will be decisive
questions for the Federal Re
public of Germany for many
years to come.
"West German relations with
the U.S. are not viewed as prob
lematic, but as better and more
trusting than ever." Schunke
said.
"NATO is the battalion of our
security and maintains an in
credible deterrence to the Sovi
et Union," he added. "Should
conflict arise, we would be the
first to be attacked. It is in our
own interest to support the goals

of NATO "
Schunke voiced concern over
the weakness of conventional
military forces in Europe "No
one wants a situation to arise in
which nuclear weapons are sub
stituted for weakened conven
tional forces." he said.
Thus, according to Schunke,
West Germany supports con
tinuation of the policy of detente
within the context of a strong
defense system. "We must not
overlook the fact that over the
past 30 years, the Warsaw Pact
countries have increased mili
tary buildup," Schunke said
Schunke also stressed an un
derlying economic consensus
between America and Europe:
"A liberal form of trade policy
is the goal of all of us."
"Trade patterns," he
claimed, "have always been in
favor of the U.S. . . . Each Ger
man spends $3.50 more on
American goods than Ameri
cans spend on German goods."
Overall, he said, German eco
nomic policies could be seen as
a positive contribution to the
world economy. "Germany has
conducted a foreign trade policy
of open markets at a time of re
cession, thus promoting new
markets," Schunke said.
"Some still feel here that
Germany is an economic giant
but a political dwarf," said
Schunke. However, he pointed
out that 89 percent of the West
German population belongs to
one of the three main Demo
cratic parties. "A country with
the political and economic
weight and stability of West
Germany is bound to assume
greater responsibilities in world
politics," Schunke stated.
Friction between East and
West Germany is an issue with
no immediate resolution "Ten
sion between the two German
states is determined in extent
bv the leading powers of both al
liance systems. Germany is
caught up in a historical proc
ess. The balance of power, se

curity of interests, and ideol
ogical differences between the
superpowers all argue against
reunification," he said
According to Craig, who just
returned from three weeks
abroad, three topics currently
dominate the attention of West
Germans: the recent election,
the future of their economy, and
the sudden doubling of transit
fees into East Germany (re
flecting a growing trend toward
isolation).
"The recent election showed
that the Bundesrepublik is be
coming more and more like the
U.S. — the people complained
that the campaign was domi
nated by television and that the
candidates did not speak to the
issues." said Craig
"The electorate showed a de
sire for continuity and stability.
people voted for the candidate.
Schmidt, not for the party , and
the vote was for middle of the
road' politics," he added
Security costs and foreign
policy costs are rising to the
point where current programs
will have to be curtailed "The
chancellor will have to tell the
easy-living Germans to pull in
their belts." Craig said.
No retaliation is planned
against the recent decision of
East Germany to double transit
fees into that country.
"The action taken by the
DDR (Deutsche Demokratisehe
Republik of East Germany) was
taken under Soviet pressure and
relates to the 'disease of unrest'
which has seized upon Poland,"
Craig said "Retaliation could
backfire. We simply don't have
effective countermeasures
When you can't do anything
diplomatically, you plav it cool
and pretend the weather is
good." he added.
Hufner spoke about the two
Germanies and the United Na
tions. In 1973. both Germanies
were admitted to the UN.
"Between 1950 and 1973, the
main policy of West Germany

was to prevent the DDR from
gaining membership at the
UN." Htifner said
Since 1973. West German poli
cv at the UN has blended into
the Western Europe regional
policy "Frequent abstentions
in roll call resolutions are in line
with the voting behavior of oth
er European member states,"
Hufner said
"It is no longer possible to
identify a single FRD (Federal
Republic of Germany) policy
but West Germany has
taken the initiative on recent is
sues including the hostage reso
lution and arms control,"
Hufner said.
East Germany's mainstream
policy at the UN stresses the 3-
Ds: detente, disarmament and
development "Yet East Ger
many votes consistently against
economic or budget issues," he
stated
"The relationship between
the two states in the General As
sembly is cool, polite and
diplomatic." Hufner said
"East Germany always seeks to
speak immediately after West
Germany, and to distinguish
itself from its capitalist, im
perialist neighbor," he added.
On the issue of West German
sympathy for the free trade un
ion movement in Poland, all
three speakers agreed that West
Germany is following a policy of
• quiet support" and mod
eration
"The Soviet Union sees West
Germany and the U.S. as the
two prime villains in Poland,"
said Spanish and Portuguese
Emeritus Prof Ronald Hilton.
"The West German unions
are playing it quietly so the So
viet Union can't pin any poten
tial debacle on the West,"
Craig said
The World in Crisis series will
continue through April, pres
enting a different country (or
countries) each Wednesday at
4:15 p.m.

Security costs and foreign
policy costs are rising to the
point where current programs
will have to be curtailed "The
chancellor will have to tell the
easy-living Germans to pull in
their belts." Craig said.
No retaliation is planned
against the recent decision of
East Germany to double transit
fees into that country.
"The action taken by the
DDR (Deutsche Demokratisehe
Republik of East Germany) was
taken under Soviet pressure and
relates to the 'disease of unrest'
which has seized upon Poland,"
Craig said "Retaliation could
backfire. We simply don't have
effective countermeasures
When you can't do anything
diplomatically, you plav it cool
and pretend the weather is

Hufner spoke about the two
Germanies and the United Na
tions. In 1973. both Germanies
were admitted to the UN.
"Between 1950 and 1973, the
main policy of West Germany

was to prevent the DDR from
gaining membership at the
UN." Htifner said
Since 1973. West German poli
cv at the UN has blended into
the Western Europe regional
policy "Frequent abstentions
in roll call resolutions are in line
with the voting behavior of oth
er European member states,"
Hufner said
"It is no longer possible to
identify a single FRD (Federal
Republic of Germany) policy
but West Germany has
taken the initiative on recent is
sues including the hostage reso
lution and arms control,"
Hufner said.
East Germany's mainstream
policy at the UN stresses the 3-

development "Yet East Ger

stated
"The relationship between
the two states in the General As

diplomatic." Hufner said
"East Germany always seeks to
speak immediately after West
Germany, and to distinguish
itself from its capitalist, im
perialist neighbor," he added.
On the issue of West German
sympathy for the free trade un

History professor Gordon Craig appeared as a panel member discussing "The Two Germanies in the
1980s: Assessment and Prediction," last Wednesday. Other members of the panel Included Dr. Lothar
Schunke. consul-general at the Wester German Consulate in San Francisco, and Prof. Klaus Hufner of
the Free University in Berlin.
"There is no solution to the
current conflict between the
two Germanies as long as Eu
rope remains divided into two
ideological camps,'' Dr Lothar
Schunke, consul-general at the
West German Consulate in San
Francisco, said last Wednes
day.
Dr Schunke was one of the
speakers participating in the
fifth symposium of the World in
Crisis series The week's topic
was "The Two Germanies in the
1980s: Assessment and Predic
tion."
History Prof. Gordon Craig of
Stanford and Prof. Klaus
Hufner of the Free University in
Berlin also spoke before an au
dience of 250
Dr Schunke focused on West
German foreign policy, saying.
"NATO. East-West relations
and the European Economic
Community will be decisive
questions for the Federal Re
public of Germany for many
years to come.
"West German relations with
the U.S. are not viewed as prob
lematic, but as better and more
trusting than ever." Schunke
said.
"NATO is the battalion of our
security and maintains an in
credible deterrence to the Sovi
et Union," he added. "Should
conflict arise, we would be the
first to be attacked. It is in our
own interest to support the goals

of NATO "
Schunke voiced concern over
the weakness of conventional
military forces in Europe "No
one wants a situation to arise in
which nuclear weapons are sub
stituted for weakened conven
tional forces." he said.
Thus, according to Schunke,
West Germany supports con
tinuation of the policy of detente
within the context of a strong
defense system. "We must not
overlook the fact that over the
past 30 years, the Warsaw Pact
countries have increased mili
tary buildup," Schunke said
Schunke also stressed an un
derlying economic consensus
between America and Europe:
"A liberal form of trade policy
is the goal of all of us."
"Trade patterns," he
claimed, "have always been in
favor of the U.S. . . . Each Ger
man spends $3.50 more on
American goods than Ameri
cans spend on German goods."
Overall, he said, German eco
nomic policies could be seen as
a positive contribution to the
world economy. "Germany has
conducted a foreign trade policy
of open markets at a time of re
cession, thus promoting new
markets," Schunke said.
"Some still feel here that
Germany is an economic giant
but a political dwarf," said
Schunke. However, he pointed
out that 89 percent of the West
German population belongs to
one of the three main Demo
cratic parties. "A country with
the political and economic
weight and stability of West
Germany is bound to assume
greater responsibilities in world
politics," Schunke stated.
Friction between East and
West Germany is an issue with
no immediate resolution "Ten
sion between the two German
states is determined in extent
bv the leading powers of both al
liance systems. Germany is
caught up in a historical proc
ess. The balance of power, se

curity of interests, and ideol
ogical differences between the
superpowers all argue against
reunification," he said
According to Craig, who just
returned from three weeks
abroad, three topics currently
dominate the attention of West
Germans: the recent election,
the future of their economy, and
the sudden doubling of transit
fees into East Germany (re
flecting a growing trend toward
isolation).
"The recent election showed
that the Bundesrepublik is be
coming more and more like the
U.S. — the people complained
that the campaign was domi
nated by television and that the
candidates did not speak to the
issues." said Craig
"The electorate showed a de
