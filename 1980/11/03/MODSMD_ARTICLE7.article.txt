# Seaga wins in Jamaican election
## 
### Washington Post 
Kingston, Jamaica — Within hours of Ed
ward Seaga's sweeping electoral triumph
over Jamaican Prime Minister Michael
Manlev Thursday night, the island's police
and army began what officers on the street
called a "mopping up" to clear the city's
rambling slums of political gunmen.
There were sporadic outbreaks of vio
lence in several of the Kingston ghettos dur
ing the morning Friday, but the surprising
extent of Seaga's victory — with unofficial
tallies giving his Jamaica Labor Party at
least 50 of Parliament's 60 seats — appears
to have amazed and heartened this country,
which has been wracked by political strife.
After eight years of the progressive, so
cialist . but increasingly inefficient and radi
calized regime of Manlev and his People's
National Party, the theme heard most often
in the streets Friday was "deliverance."
The U.S. Embassy here has tried to stay as
far from the election limelight as possible,
but many analysts consider the Boston-born
Seaga's victory a triumph for Washington.
Manlev's conspicious friendship with
Cuban President Fidel Castro, his call for
Puerto Rican independence and the increas
ingly radical rhetoric of his regime had been
a constant worry to State Department of
ficials in recent years. While the Carter ad
ministration had been able to live with the
Manlev mystique in Third World politics,
especially since he supported U.S. positions
on Afghanistan and Soviet interventionism.
Washington became increasingly con
cerned at the prospect of the largest Eng
lish-speaking island in the Caribbean be
coming a better ally of Havana than of
Washington.

The threat of communism was no more
attractive to the Jamaican people than to
U.S. policy-makers as it turned out. Seaga's
strongest suit among voters has been his
virulent anti-communism But while Jamai
cans are certain of what they rejected by
voting out Manlev's government the course
on which Seaga will take them is not alto
gether clear
His first public pronouncement in his vic
tory speech Thursday night was a call for
the expulsion of Cuban Ambassador Ulises
Estrada — considered a symbol of Cuban in
fluence on this island of two million people.
Where Manlev had called for reconcil
iation and attempts to put "Humpty Dump
ty back together" among this people bitter
ly and bloodily split by partisan politics.
Seaga simply exulted in his "tumultuous
victory" and over what he sees as the defeat
of the communist menace.
While in campaign rhetoric Manlev
blamed outside forces and internal sabotage
for the nation's virtual bankruptcy — and
Seaga blamed Manlev — the truth lies some
where in between.
Jamaica's enormous need for expensive
imports, especially oil. and the island's de
clining productivity may take years to re
verse.
In the meantime, shortages, unemploy
ment and social inequities will only continue
to fester.
Seaga believes the beginnings of a solu
tion to Jamaica's problems are in a resump
tion of negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund, which were broken off by
Manlev. and a better general atmosphere
for investment.

While he waxes less ecstatic about social
justice than Manlev, Seaga says he realizes
the necessity for extensive aid to this na
tion's impoverished majority and that his
more efficient administration will deliver
more effectively on such promises and
needs than Manlev.
But the most pressing problem of the mo
ment is to end the partisan violence that has
cost more than 500 lives this year. Since
Seaga's election Thursday night he has re
lied not so much on exhortation for peace
but on Jamaica's army and police to do the
job.
When snipers fired on the high-walled
headquarters of the Jamaica constabulary
Thursday night, killing one policeman (at
least two others died in similar attacks
elsewhere in the city) a house-to-house
search was instituted and referred to as
"Operation Wipeout ."
Manlev. meanwhile, has kept a low pro
file. and it appears unlikely he will remain
long as opposition leader. "You know, real
ly. the leader of the opposition's role is a
very negative sort of thing." Manley said
Thursday, adding that he would probably
find the role boring after being prime min
ister.
Manley s departure from the scene would
leave the People's National Party in the
hands of its most radical idealogues. includ
ing general secretary D. K. Duncan, who
has made no secret of his revolutionary
fervor.
As things stand, such a change could
cause the end of any moderation in the Peo
ple's National Party and make it ever more
difficult for Jamaica, and Seaga. to put
"Humpty Dumpty together again."
