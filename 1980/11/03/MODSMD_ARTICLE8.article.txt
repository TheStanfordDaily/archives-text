Havana (AP) — The rush to Florida-bound
boats is over, but the desperation of thousands of
Cubans lingers on in a quiet corner of the U.S.
diplomatic mission here.
There, a stack of mailbags bulges with perhaps
as many as 20,000 letters from would-be refugees
seeking visas to the United States.
The letters show that the Cuban refugee prob
lem did not end last month, when President Fidel
Castro shut off the flow of emigrants from Mariel.
a port 20 miles west of here. A total of 125.269
Cubans sailed to Key West, Fla., during the five
month exodus.
U.S. officials estimate, conservatively, they
say, that 1 million of Cuba's 9 million people would
like to leave. Many have relatives in the United
States, and many are said to be fed up with hard
ships here.
The Communist government says the refugees
are misfits and that the majority of Cubans would
be better off without them as neighbors.
Quota exemptions
U.S. law permits 20,000 immigrants a year from
any Western Hemisphere nation. Thousands of
Cubans whose immediate relatives are U.S.
citizens are exempted from this quota.

The U.S. diplomatic mission here, known of
ficially as the U.S. Interests Section of the Swiss
Embassy, is housed in the former American Em
bassy Its five-member consular staff is just now
gearing up for regular processing of visa applica
tions after a five-month shutdown that began last
May 2. On that day. 400 Cubans jammed into the
steel-and-glass building after being attacked by a
chain-swinging gang of men described by Ameri
can officials as Cuban security agents.
The violence broke out as the 400 would-be refu
gees were outside the mission protesting what
they said were delays in consideration of their
visa requests. Fearing retribution if they re
turned to their homes, they stayed in the mission
until the last went home Sept. 23.
Cuban authorities gave assurances that none of
the 400 would be arrested, and one was, said
Wayne Smith, the Interests Section chief.
Once the consular staff gets back down to regu
lar visa applications, it should be able to process
more than 100 a week, say U.S. officials in Wash
ington . But they explain that the refugee flow will
depend on a number of factors, including the
speed with which the Cubans issue exit visas and
the state of U.S.-Cuban relations.
