Chanting "Work for people,
not for profits," 25 anti-nuclear
protesters marched into the lob
by of the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) Fri
day afternoon
The activists, members of the
campus anarchist group Roses
Against a Nuclear Environment
(RANE), were protesting the
employment recruiting efforts
of three nuclear weapons manu
facturers that conducted in
terviews Friday at the CPPC for
engineering
The tiiree manufacturers in
volved are Lawrence Liver
more Laboratories, operated by
UC-Berkeley. which provide re
search and development for
U.S. nuclear weapons; Kerr-
McGee, which mines and mills
uranium ore used in weapon
making, and Aerojet, which
builds rocket motors for
Minuteman, Polaris and MX
missiles.
Members picket
Before entering the building,
RANE members picketed out
side most of Friday morning
and distributed leaflets advising
interviewees to reconsider
seeking jobs with the nuclear

companies. Several of the pick
eters wore gas masks and car
ried signs which read "Stop Hir
ing for Murder!" and "Death
Merchants Off Campus!"
Inside the CPPC, the pro
testers formed a circle, sang
"Give Peace a Chance," and
read aloud excerpts from the
company handbooks on file in
the waiting area. They were not
asked to leave, but a CPPC em
ployee requested that the group
"keep the noise down so we can
hear the telephones."
Purpose to educate
According to RANE member
Bob Thawley, the purpose of the
demonstration was to educate
members of the Stanford com
munity rather than to obstruct
the routine business of the
CPPC. The group made no at
tempt to disrupt or prevent the
scheduled interviews.
One demonstrator, a senior
physics major who asked not to
be identified, explained that she
was participating because "it's
so frustrating that so many
weapons-related companies in
terview here. I'm going to be
looking for jobs hut I'm just not
interested in working on weap
ons."
