Advocating a non-interventionist
foreign policy. Libertarian presiden
tial candidate Ed Clark yesterday
called for the elimination of the De
partment of Energy and the CIA. Me
spoke before a crowd of 500 in White
Plaza
Clark, an attorney for the Atlantic
Richfield Company (ARCO). said the
Department of Energy is the principal
force pushing the United States
toward war because it maintains U S.
dependence on foreign oil by keeping
oil prices artificially low.
Clark said abolishing the depart
ment would "let oil prices rise up to
replacement cost. This would produce
massive conservation, more oil and
gas and much more of the alternative
fuels."
Justifying the Libertarian stand
that the government can and should
break its relationship with multi-na
tional corporations, Clark said these
businesses should not be able to rely on
"the Marines or the World Bank or the
CIA to bail them out."
Clark said the federal government
used the CIA to "bail out" the oil in
dustry bv reinstating the deposed Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi of Iran,
thereby leading the the United States
to its present conflict with the Iranian
people.
By eliminating the CIA. the govern
ment would "respect the freedom of
the American people and the integrity
of other societies." said Clark
He added that a Libertarian admin
istration would simply offer Third
World countries the example of "lim
ited government, civil liberties, de
mocracy and free market economy.
Domestically. Clark said he would
expand human liberties by cutting in
come taxes by 50 percent, which he
said would "put over $100 billion
dollars into the economy and provide
5 1 1 million additional full-time jobs
Citing increasing unemployment
among black teenagers, Clark said be
would eliminate the minimum wage,
which he called "a very racist law."
He said it prevents the least skilled
people — who, due to U.S. cultural pat
terns. are often minorities — from
working.
He also said he opposes subsidizing
companies such as Chrysler Corpo
ration.
Clark took several shots at the three
leading presidential contenders, first
accusing Republican candidate
Ronald Reagan of having never said a
"good word" about civil liberties and
of favoring "massive government" in
defense. He said Reagan'scall for mil
itary superiority over the USSR
showed incompetence.
