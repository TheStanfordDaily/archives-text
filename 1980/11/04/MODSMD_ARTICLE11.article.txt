# Writer suggests view of nature
## 
### Liz Rosner 
The featured participants in
last Wednesday's CROW series
"Dialogues with West Coast
Women Writers" were in
troduced as "two powerful
women: " Susan Griffin, a
writer known for her
"trenchant feminist world
view." and Nan Keohane, as
sociate professor of political
science.
Keohane. who is including
Griffin's book Woman and Na
ture in her new course
"Feminist Theory" questioned
Griffin about her work with re
gard to both theme and form.
A predominant theme ad
dressed in Griffin's writing is
her conception of the way
knowledge, power and nature
intersect. In their dialogue.
Keohane and Griffin discussed
the possibility of viewing emo
tional nature as positive rather
than restrictive.
"We have to change our con
cept of nature." Griffin urged.
When Keohane asked her to
identify the "We," Griffin ex
plained that she was referring to
everyone. "I don't intend to ex
clude men when I say 'women.' I
was using the word women ge

nerically."
The almost all-woman au
dience in Terman Auditorium
responded with laughter and
several minutes of applause.
Griffin spoke of the super
ficial division between thought
and nature, and claimed that the
supposed detachment of theo
rization is actually "institu
tionalized schizophrenia."
"Racism is an example of a
mass delusion of society," Grif
fin said. "It involves the
projection of our denied quali
ties onto others. Similarly, sex
ism accuses women of being
emotional, crazy, passive, when
these are human qualities —
possibilities our culture is
afraid to own up to."
Griffin also reflected on the
theme of dialogue in her work,
referring to her play Voices, and
her way of writing in response to
voices that she hears. This was
related, she said, to the crises of
selecting the right form of ex
pression to use — play, poem,
essay.
"I allow the material to find
its own form," Griffin ex
plained. "You know when it's
right."

Next Wednesday's noon
dialogue features Tillie Olsen.
author of Tell Me a Riddle and
Silences, and Marilyn Yalom.
associate director of CROW and
lecturer in modern thought and
literature.
