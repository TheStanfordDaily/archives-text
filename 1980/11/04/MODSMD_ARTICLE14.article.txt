## Kenneth Killiany Vote for Reagan and defy the liberals' consensus 
### 
It seems to be commonplace this year that eve
ryone will be voting against someone and not for
anyone in this election Let me say. without
breaking into a campaign song, that that is not en
tirely true. There are many people who are ac
tually support the various candidates, and I. for
one. am voting positively. I will cast my vote in
support of Ronald Reagan
That doesn't mean I won't be voting against
Jimmy Carter I'm a charter member of the Any
one But Carter club, but my decision to vote for
Reagan was made several years ago. and is based
on long reflection There are good reasons to vote
for the man; there are honest reasons to vote
against him They are not being discussed, how
ever. and that bothers me.

Do the liny mistakes made by the
candidates really indicate
anything? Do the standard
criticisms of the candidates
reallv matter?

There is a stultifying liberal consensus in
America. Anyone opposed to it, particularly on
the right, is supposed to be laughable. What the
people who join in that consensus believe changes
with the wind, but, whatever it is, it is held to be
absolutely true.
The most blatant example of this is the com
monly stated criticism of Reagan's economics
which asks. "How can he balance the budget, cut
taxes, increase military spending, and save vital
services all at once?" This criticism is always
based on traditional liberal economics. The prob
lem with that line of questioning is that it does not
take into account the fact that Reagan does not ac
cept traditional liberal economics. Indeed, eco

nomic theory is in a shambles right now. but that
never gets mentioned in the popular press
It's not only the right that's getting that treat
ment. As the country moves right, the left is cov
ering its flank by attacking the far left. Kennedy's
criticism of Carter's economics never received
the audience it should have How I wish the Demo
cratic nominee honestly had liberal convictions!
Then everyone would have seen this election in its
true light, and would have voted after carefully
considering the differences
This is an important election. Very basic at
titudes toward government should be the central
issues of the campaign, but they are not. They
have been obscured by overlv-detailed yet truly
uncritical reporting in the popular press and by
the restrictive liberal consensus.
It's too late to ask everyone to trot over to the
libraries and read back issues of the National Re
view and the Progressive to get clear presenta
tions of the issues from those fine publications; it
isn't too late to ask everyone to take an hour out
before they vote to consider the real issues. Do the
tiny little mistakes made by the candidates really
indicate anything? Do the standard criticisms of
the candidates really matter? What is the dif
ference between Reagan and Cartel and Com
moner and Anderson and Clark?
Ronald Reagan is no extremist, and he certain
ly isn't doctrinaire, but a vote for him means
something Jimmy Carter doesn't seem to believe
in anything, and seems to be truly incompetent, at
least by my standards, but a vote for him also
means something.
I genuinely believe that this election is so im
portant you ought to choose between the two ma
jor candidates, but if you believe a vote for some
one else will accomplish something, vote for
them. Don't take the attitude that we have a hope
less choice. That's not true.
