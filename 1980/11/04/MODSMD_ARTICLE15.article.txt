## We must sacrifice in the short term 
### 
The United States is faced
with many serious environmen
tal problems, but none of these
are of greater salience than the
manner in which we formulate
policy. Whereas our political
and economic policies are based
on short-term goals, the causes
and solutions of environmental
problems are long-term in na
ture. The toxic waste problem is
a prime example of the way in
which a short-term orientation
in policy-making actually leads
to environmental problems.
After World War 11. the
chemical industry began to
grow and prosper. It produced a
wide variety of useful
chemicals. However, they also
produced by-products which

have no use and must be dis
posed of. Without any laws to
guide them, the industry natu
rally sought to rid themselves of
these wastes at the lowest pos
sible cost, without regard to the
future Today, policy-makers
are trying to decide who should
pay for the clean-up of hundreds
of dumping sites (e.g. Love
Canal) at a cost of billions of
dollars.
In short, the policy was one
which reaped short-term gains
but built a long-term "debt"
that we must now pay. The toxic
waste problem could have been
largely avoided had industry ex
ecutives adopted a long-term
strategy to "pay as you go,"
taking proper care of hazardous

wastes from the outset. Un
fortunately, our institutions
create many disincentives for
decision-makers regarding
long-term analysis of policy.
In business, executives are
under pressure to maximize
profits, and are thus unlikely to
allocate much capital to
projects that will pay off only in
the long-term. Furthermore,
the capitalist/market economy
is based on growth of productive
capacity; environmental safe
guards necessitate a reduction
in capital investment and thus
slow economic growth in the
short-term.
In government, policy
makers are constrained by the
reelection imperative. Voters
and lobbyists respond to policies
which are immediately benefi
cial. Politicians, therefore, ben
efit most from policies which
have desireable effects within
their term of office. It is only the
politician with a faithful consti
tuency who can afford to ad
vocate environmentally sound
policies which entail added eco
nomic costs. This becomes par
ticularly true in times of eco
nomic hardship, when environ
mentalists become the pariahs
of the unemployed.
Clearly, it is not just politi
cians who neglect to recognize
long-term consequences , voters
are chronically unaware of en
vironmental consequences. Wit
ness the popularity of the Re
agan campaign which ad
vocates a reduction in environ
mental safeguards as a means
of stimulating economic vigor.
This is a proposal which many
voters approve of, but it is

merely the easiest way out of a
complex problem, it would
surely cost us dearly in the com
ing decades.
It is essential for everyone,
voters and politicians, workers
and executives alike, to recog
nize that environmental safe
guards do pay off in the long
term. In the toxic waste case,
economic growth was ac
celerated by the externalization
of waste disposal.
But now. billions of dollars
will be removed from the pool of
productive capital just to
eliminate the most acute conse
quences (there are many
chronic ones) of careless dis
posal. Moreover, it is much
more expensive to clean up the
wastes now than it would have
been to dispose of them properly
in the first place.
Between now and the year
2000, mankind is going to face
the most consequential test in
human history. The pressures
being placed on the Earth's re
source base are reaching a
critical stage.
In order to avoid a period of
catastrophic resource shortage,
we must act now. We must sac
rifice in the short-term to avoid
a much more unpleasant situ
ation 30 years from now. It is un
likely that our institutions can
effectively deal with such a
long-range problem. Only the
enlightenment of the individual
with respect to the critical na
ture of environmental issues
holds much hope for the future.
