## Halloween, politics; both are scary 
### 
Yipes! Did everyone have a
fun Halloween? We sure did.
We threw eggs and broke win
dows and then dressed up as mu
tants and rang Edward Teller's
doorbell. Boy, you should have
been there! He looked like he
was going to drop the big one
right on the spot. Golly. was that
ever terrific.
Why have we started with
such a happy anecdote? Be
cause, frankly, we don't want to
get caught up in that depressing
day before election one-last
chance-only-hope-let's-be-good-
citizens syndrome like some
other columnists around here
that we won't mention. Forget

your troubles! C'mon, get hap
py. Today is Tuesday! Funday!
Yahoooo!
Still haven't decided who to
vote for? We'll tell you who to
vote for! Cast yours for Carter!
Did you see those debates? Talk
about your happy, confident,
well-adjusted presidents. He
was great! Now let's get on with
the fun stuff.
We heard some guy at dinner
say that when his brother went
to school he used to start bomb
threats before the election. Not
real bombs, because they hurt
folks, but some harmless bomb
threats.
They went something
like this one: "Hello, Radio
Station? I am an ex-Vietnam
G.I. demolitions expert, and I
can see Carter leading us down
the path to military inferiority.
I've seen it for three years now.
In that time, I have collected
15.000 tons of T.N.T. in a ware
house somewhere in San Fran
cisco, and will blow it all up un

less Reagan wins. I realize that
it's not really that big of a bomb,
but it might be near a hospital,
or even on the fault line. Please
tell Mr. Carter this. Let's see if
his feelings for human rights in
clude San Francisco!"
Why didn't he stop the elec
tion? Because he didn't have
friends at UCLA, Columbia,
Harvard or Northwestern like
vou do. Makes vou think, doesn't
it?
Did you miss your chance to
play a joke on John Anderson
while he was here on Saturday?
We didn't. When he was in the
bathroom at the Palo Alto train
depot, we switched him with our
old trailermate, who's a dead
ringer for Anderson. If John An
derson is elected on Tuesday,
look for Stanford to go to the
Rose Bowl bypresidential man
date. Go team!
Zow! This is going to be the
best darn election year ever,
isn't it? "President Reagan,
there's a lobbyist from the NRA

here to see you. President Re
agan 9 President Reagan 9 Oh,
my God. he's dead' The Presi
dent is dead! What? Oh, Mr.
President, thank God it's only a
stroke. Should I send for Mr.
Bush and Justice Burger?" Isn't
that a funny story? Ed Clark
told us that one. Yes. we do
know Ed. and he is a dork'
Whew!
Halloween? Politics? Both
are scary, sure, but you can
have a lot of fun at both, too.
Both have parties. Aw, we don't
have to tell you all of this. Go
out! Have fun! And if you do get
into any trouble, remember the
words of Chicago's Mayor Jane
Byrne: "No, this is not Mayor
Daley's office! Mayor Daley is
dead! Put down my desk! Wait!
Wait!"
