## Where is the evidence? 
### 
It was gratifying to learn, in Dale Gieringer's
column (Daily, Oct. 22) that he finds members of
the Citizens Party honest, idealistic and even
friendly. Citizens Party presidential candidate
Barry Commoner, on the other hand, is evidently
"sleazily dishonest," a "demagogue," and an all
around slob.
Before Daily readers take either of these
judgements to heart, however, we'd like to make
a few points about how Gieringer's arguments
were made.
The number of adjectives Gieringer uses to con
demn Commoner and his ideas is truly striking —
in the first two sentences alone Commoner or his
ideas are called "controversial," "Socialist,"
"scatological," "sorry," and "tragic." However,
when we look for the evidence substantiating
these characterizations so that we might judge for
ourselves, we are disappointed.
The fact is that Gieringer consistently draws
conclusions that are based on nothing more sub
stantial than his own opinions. For example, Gier
inger writes:
"In his book. The Politics of Energy, Com
moner outlines a bizarre and ambitious energy
plan, based entirely on decentralized solar tech
nologies, notably photovoltaic cells, gasohol, and
methane from biomass."
"These are only a few of the economic, concep
tual and technical flaws in Commoner's scheme."
When one asks what those flaws are, one can
find no clue in either paragraph. The only basis for
Gieringer's conclusion is his own words, specifi
cally his description of Commoner's plan as
"bizarre" and "ambitious."
Gieringer uses every cheap trick in the book to
make us conclude that Commoner is a sinister
moron. Commoner "tried to argue that the

ecological problem was primarily due to pollu
tion"; evidently an argument that Dale Gieringer
doesn't believe in isn't a real argument, it's only
an attempt. Or: "Commoner is ignorant of any ec
onomics beyond vulgar Marxism."
Since "vulgar Marxism" is a term that refers
essentially to economic determinism, and Com
moner is by no means an economic determinist,
we can only conclude that Gieringer's honesty and
accuracy were overcome by his desire to call
Commoner vulgar. In an article purporting to con
demn aemagoguery, Gieringer has employed a
form of agumentation suitable, above all, to a
demagogue.
Up to the end of the column, all that has been
demonstrated is that Commoner has dared to con
tradict Dale Gieringer's view of the universe.
Only then, after we have been bombarded with pe
jorative adjectives, are we treated to a factual ac
cusation: Commoner, says Gieringer
"fraudulently misrepresented" a study to support
one of his points at a conference.
We are certain that Gieringer didn't invent this
dark incident, but without an account of what in
fact transpired — what the study said and what
Commoner said, for example — we have no
evidence to judge whether Commoner is a fraud.
Once again, we just have to take Dale Gieringer's
word for it.
Barry Commoner is indeed controversial, and
like the other presidential candidates, he's proba
bly often wrong. What we'd like to see is a dis
cussion of the issues he raises based on facts and
arguments rather than strings of adjectives.
