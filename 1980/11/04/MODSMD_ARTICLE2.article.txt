# Carter, Reagan make final arguments
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — President Jimmy
Carter and Ronald Reagan journeyed
the last miles of a long campaign yes
terday. their final words echoing a
season of argument over war and
peace, inflation and unemployment.
The president was terse and guarded.
Reagan silent on the possible release
of American hostages in Iran — the un
spoken issue that could be crucial
The Republican nominee's one word
on the subject: "No," it would nothurt
him at the polls. He said he was not
going to comment on hostage develop
ments.
Carter was back on the road after a
day of White House conferences and a
televised report that Iran's terms of
fer "a positive basis'' for an end to the
hostage stalemate. He said in Akron,
Ohio, that he'd stand on what he had
said.

"Don't know vet." he replied when
asked whether he was encouraged at
word the 52 hostages would be turned
over to Iranian government custody
by the captors who have held them for
one full year
Carter and Reagan were on parallel
routes across the nation, although the
president's spokesman said he was
prepared to return to Washington if
hostage developments warranted
Independent John Anderson turned
his third-man campaign homeward,
too. insisting that there might be "dra
matic shifts" in his direction today.
The Carter-Reagan race was rated
too close to call by the national public
opinion pollsters, although the Re
publican nominee appeared to hold the
election-eve edge in potential elec
toral votes. That state-bv-state count
will settle the contest between the 39th
president and the man who seeks to be

come 40th
The voters also will be electing 34
senators, a new House of Represent
atives, and 13 governors Republicans
appeared likely to gain seats in both
branches of Congress, but not nearly
enough to undo the Democratic con
trol that has held for 25 years now
The first polls open at 6 a.m. EST in
New England; the last ballots will be
cast 20 hours later in Alaska.
The key to victory for Reagan or for
Carter appeared to rest in the verdict
of closely contested industrial states
in the Midwest, and both men made
final bids for support there as they
headed westward Vice President
Walter Mondaleand George Bush. Re
agan's running mate, combed that ter
ritory. too. in the final hours.
As always. Reagan accused Carter
of mismanaging the economy into re
kindled inflation and rising unemploy
ment "We have more than a president
who has failed." he said in Peoria. 11l
"We have a president who refuses to
admit his policies had anything to do
with those failures "
Carter pressed his chosen theme in
Granite City. 111., saying that Reagan
is outside the mainstream on "the is
sue of peace and the control of nuclear
weapons" He also said a Reagan ad
ministration "would be the worst that
could happen."
The president canceled a planned
appearance in Burbank. Calif., and
went to Detroit instead Michigan has
21 electoral votes to offer, and it
looked close. California has 45, but Re
agan is rated the leader in the state
that twice elected him governor
Carter booked a 6000-mile campaign
windup to take him nearly twice
around the clock, Washington to
Akron to Granite City to Detroit to
Portland. Ore . to Seattle, then home
to Plains. Ga., to vote.
Reagan's last campaign route h-d
from Peoria to Portland, then to Cali
fornia for windup shows in San Diego
and Los Angeles.

one full year
Carter and Reagan were on parallel
routes across the nation, although the
president's spokesman said he was
prepared to return to Washington if
hostage developments warranted
Independent John Anderson turned
his third-man campaign homeward,
too. insisting that there might be "dra
matic shifts" in his direction today.
The Carter-Reagan race was rated
too close to call by the national public
opinion pollsters, although the Re
publican nominee appeared to hold the
election-eve edge in potential elec
toral votes. That state-bv-state count
will settle the contest between the 39th
president and the man who seeks to be

come 40th
The voters also will be electing 34
senators, a new House of Represent
atives, and 13 governors Republicans
appeared likely to gain seats in both
branches of Congress, but not nearly
enough to undo the Democratic con
trol that has held for 25 years now
The first polls open at 6 a.m. EST in
New England; the last ballots will be
cast 20 hours later in Alaska.
The key to victory for Reagan or for
Carter appeared to rest in the verdict
of closely contested industrial states
in the Midwest, and both men made
final bids for support there as they
headed westward Vice President
Walter Mondaleand George Bush. Re
agan's running mate, combed that ter
ritory. too. in the final hours.
As always. Reagan accused Carter
of mismanaging the economy into re
kindled inflation and rising unemploy
ment "We have more than a president
who has failed." he said in Peoria. 11l
"We have a president who refuses to
admit his policies had anything to do
with those failures "
Carter pressed his chosen theme in
Granite City. 111., saying that Reagan
is outside the mainstream on "the is
sue of peace and the control of nuclear
weapons" He also said a Reagan ad
ministration "would be the worst that
could happen."
The president canceled a planned
appearance in Burbank. Calif., and
went to Detroit instead Michigan has
21 electoral votes to offer, and it
looked close. California has 45, but Re
agan is rated the leader in the state
that twice elected him governor
Carter booked a 6000-mile campaign
windup to take him nearly twice
around the clock, Washington to
Akron to Granite City to Detroit to
Portland. Ore . to Seattle, then home
to Plains. Ga., to vote.
Reagan's last campaign route h-d
from Peoria to Portland, then to Cali
fornia for windup shows in San Diego
and Los Angeles.
