Reagan a relief?
I have heard people express
relief that Ronald Reagan did
not come across as a "mad
bomber" in the TV debate. He
really is a nice, rather kindly old
man. But the substance to the
charge that Reagan would lead
us to war has never involved Re
agan's character. It has always
been his simple, nostalgic and
mythic understanding of poli
tics which has been scary. The
debate did nothing to comfort
my anxiety about the dangerous
combination of sincerity and su
perficiality which Reagan
would bring to the White House.
He wants us to control the is
sues which could lead to war. If
that were possible, the issue
would not exist. Issues occur
when there are two or more
parties with enough power to
make the others compromise or
alter the ways interests are
pursued.
Interdependence can be an
excellent basis for mutual se
curity. Our inability to control
the behavior of other nations
does not make us weak Domi
nance. on the other hand, may

provide "peace" for a while, but
seems to lead to war as another
nation challenges to be "domi
nant."
He really sees America doing
what John Wayne did. The hero
never wants to kill, never wants
the showdown, always is
"forced" into it. He's the good
guy, above evil and hate But, a
man's got to do what a man's got
to do.
Fear of the known versus fear
of the unknown. Jimmy Carter
is dull, possibly competent, less
"pure" than we thought and dis
appointing. But the alternative
is duller, has no credentials and
says abysmally dumb things
when his advisors lose control of
the audio And the stakes are too
high

The plague of politicking in an
election year (isn't every year
an election year?) can really
lead to monotony. The same is
sues are raised and avoided by a

host of aspiring politicians who
fear taking a stand on any sub
ject will alienate potential sup
porters.
With this in mind, it is a rarity
to come across a bright, fresh
individual who does not promise
to know all the answers, but is
aware of the questions and the
channels through which the an
swers may be sought. I met one
such person and feel compelled
to offer the feeling of re
assurance to others that I felt
after meeting Greg Morris.
Lieutenant Governor Mike
Curb calls Morris a "natural
born leader who will make a dif
ference." Morris understands
housing, crime and inflation, ac
cording to Curb. He also said
that Greg Morris has the desire
to "restore incentive and self
reliance among young people."
Curb is one of many who en
dorse Morris On Oct. 22, 1980,
the San Jose Mercury an
nounced its endorsement of
Morris saying, "He is obviously
intelligent and energetic, and
we think he deserves a chance to
show what he can do in Sacra
mento " The Mercury predicted

Morris will be an . . interest
ing. colorful, outspoken and ag
gressive ... in presenting ideas
as a legislature.
Personally I found Morris to
be a genuine and respectable
person who did not fit any politi
cal stereotypes I had previously
held. Although "genuine" is not
a word often used to describe a
probable California as
semblyman, to me it is an im
portant quality in a person who
will be effecting so many
changes in my life.

Did my ears deceive me or
did Ronald Reagan say on the
presidential debate that he pro
poses two minimum wage
levels, the lower of the two for

the "minorities"? After a youth
when he never noticed any ra
cial problems in the United
States, he seems to have at
tained an old age with as little
understanding of equal op
portunity as of the process of
photosynthesis.
Trees pollute and "minor
ities" are happy working for
lower wages. He even expects to
institutionalize "minorities"
reveling in their lower standard
of living with government regu
lation. making doubly sure they
cannot climb out of the
quagmire of poverty.
Maybe all of us "minorities"
could get together and out
number Ronald Reagan.
Why do they call it "mud
slinging" when his own words
are cast back at him?

I have heard people express
relief that Ronald Reagan did
not come across as a "mad
bomber" in the TV debate. He
really is a nice, rather kindly old
man. But the substance to the
charge that Reagan would lead
us to war has never involved Re
agan's character. It has always
been his simple, nostalgic and
mythic understanding of poli
tics which has been scary. The
debate did nothing to comfort
my anxiety about the dangerous
combination of sincerity and su
perficiality which Reagan
would bring to the White House.
He wants us to control the is
sues which could lead to war. If
that were possible, the issue
would not exist. Issues occur
when there are two or more
parties with enough power to
make the others compromise or
alter the ways interests are
pursued.
Interdependence can be an
excellent basis for mutual se
curity. Our inability to control
the behavior of other nations
does not make us weak Domi
nance. on the other hand, may

provide "peace" for a while, but
seems to lead to war as another
nation challenges to be "domi
nant."
He really sees America doing
what John Wayne did. The hero
never wants to kill, never wants
the showdown, always is
"forced" into it. He's the good
guy, above evil and hate But, a
man's got to do what a man's got
to do.
Fear of the known versus fear
of the unknown. Jimmy Carter
is dull, possibly competent, less
"pure" than we thought and dis
appointing. But the alternative
is duller, has no credentials and
says abysmally dumb things
when his advisors lose control of
the audio And the stakes are too
high

The plague of politicking in an
election year (isn't every year
an election year?) can really
lead to monotony. The same is
sues are raised and avoided by a

host of aspiring politicians who
fear taking a stand on any sub
ject will alienate potential sup
porters.
With this in mind, it is a rarity
to come across a bright, fresh
individual who does not promise
to know all the answers, but is
aware of the questions and the
channels through which the an
swers may be sought. I met one
such person and feel compelled
to offer the feeling of re
assurance to others that I felt
after meeting Greg Morris.
Lieutenant Governor Mike
Curb calls Morris a "natural
born leader who will make a dif
ference." Morris understands
housing, crime and inflation, ac
cording to Curb. He also said
that Greg Morris has the desire
to "restore incentive and self
reliance among young people."
Curb is one of many who en
dorse Morris On Oct. 22, 1980,
the San Jose Mercury an
nounced its endorsement of
Morris saying, "He is obviously
intelligent and energetic, and
we think he deserves a chance to
show what he can do in Sacra
mento " The Mercury predicted

Morris will be an . . interest
ing. colorful, outspoken and ag
gressive ... in presenting ideas
as a legislature.
Personally I found Morris to
be a genuine and respectable
person who did not fit any politi
cal stereotypes I had previously
held. Although "genuine" is not
a word often used to describe a
probable California as
semblyman, to me it is an im
portant quality in a person who
will be effecting so many
changes in my life.

Did my ears deceive me or
did Ronald Reagan say on the
presidential debate that he pro
poses two minimum wage
levels, the lower of the two for

the "minorities"? After a youth
when he never noticed any ra
cial problems in the United
States, he seems to have at
tained an old age with as little
understanding of equal op
portunity as of the process of
photosynthesis.
Trees pollute and "minor
ities" are happy working for
lower wages. He even expects to
institutionalize "minorities"
reveling in their lower standard
of living with government regu
lation. making doubly sure they
cannot climb out of the
quagmire of poverty.
Maybe all of us "minorities"
could get together and out
number Ronald Reagan.
Why do they call it "mud
slinging" when his own words
are cast back at him?
