### 
Austin, Texas (AP) — No
body has stirred such political
excitement on campus since Pat
Paulsen ran for president. But
then Nobody only launched his
drive for the presidency four
years ago.
About 500 University of Texas
students cheered on Oct. 27. as
Wavy Gravy, coordinator of the
Nobody for President Commit
tee, resorted to mud-slinging,
groin-kicking and demagoguerv
of the lowest sort in behalf of his
candidate.
"Who was president before
George Washington?" Gravy
roared.
"Nobody!" the crowd
chorused.
"Who honored the treaties
with the Indians?" he de
manded.
"Nobody!" answered the
crowd.
"Who will lower our taxes?"
"Nobody!"
"Who will free the
hostages?"
"Nobody!"
"Who do you want to run vour
life?"
"Nobody!"
"Who bakes chocolate pie
better than your mom?"
"Nobody!"
By then the crowd had gotten
pretty excited and Gravy began
seeking testimonials.
"Anybody want to testify that
Nobody has changed their life?"
he asked, and a young man

stepped forward to give wit
ness.
"I've never voted for any
body." he confessed. "But this
year I'm going to vote for No
body."
Just remember." Gravy re
minded the students. "If No
body wins, nobody loses."
During a lull in the proceed
ings. Gravy admitted his real
name is Hugh Romney and the
Nobody for President campaign
is being run by a San Francisco

area commune that calls itself
the Hog Farm The members
run a telephone answering ser
vice. children's camps and an
organic grape farm and or
ganize street theater presenta
tions.
This is Nobody's second try
for the presidency. Romnev
said. Nobody was put forward as
a candidate in 1976 and is a can
didate again this year since
there is a potential for a land
slide, Romnev added
