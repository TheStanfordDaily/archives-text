## Springsteen: the concert 
### Mike Hale 
There was a time when you had to defend Bruce
Springsteen Just three years ago. you had to tell
people that he could sing, that his songs didn't all
sound the same, that he really was God and Buddy
Holly all rolled in one You knew he was the future
of rock and roll, but it seemed like the future
would never arrive
The night of December 17. 1978. Springsteen
played to a full house at Winterland in San Fran
cisco. He came back to the Bay Area last Monday
night. 21 months later, and 10.000 people who were
lucky enough to get tickets came to the Oakland
Coliseum to hear him They all knew he could
sing. Somewhere between those two concerts
Bruce Springsteen arrived — and brought the
future with him. Right now. Springsteen is rock,
past, present and future. No one else even comes
close.
How did it happen 0 Why is it that, as Dave
Marsh says, "... in his absence, Springsteen's
legend has mushroomed 0 ' His last concert was
nearly two years ago: 29 months elapsed between
Darkness On The Ed f>e of Tou n, his last album,
and The River, released early in October Three
years ago Springsteen was a closet idol; this
year, there have been 76,<H)() ticket requests for
two December concerts in Madison Square
Garden — enough for 16 sell-outs.
Why? Well, if you saw the show at the Coliseum
last week, you know it doesn't matter. Bruce
Springsteen deserves all the adulation anyone
cares to give him. regardless of his reasons. It
was. simply put, the best rock concert I.and eve
ryone else there, had ever seen — the best songs,
the best singing, the best band, the best fun. It was
probably as good as a rock concert can be
If you weren't there, there's not much more I
can tell you. Describing a Springsteen concert
must be a little like describing how you found God
-- you know something wonderful happened, but
it's impossible to recount it coherently. All you
have left are random images.
Like Bruce and the E Street Band striding on
stage at 8:30 (the future was a half-hour late but

after three years no one was going to quibble i, and
ripping into " Born To Run before the house
lights went off and the yelling could die down The
yelling never stopped that trademarked. low
rumble during every break. "Bruce' Bruce'
Bruce' " Four hours later after two encores. 31
songs, five dives into the audience, and a change
of shirts. Bruce stalked off the stage as unaffec
tedly as he had appeared, with no fanfare, and the
crowd still rumbling Bruce' Bruce' "
It was a decidedly new show — he played 17 of
The Hii rr's 20 songs, and all but three numbers
came off of his last three albums But there were
no new songs < that is. original, unrecorded
songsi. unless you count the lead-in to "I Wanna
Marry You." which could be called "Here She
Comes" for lack of a better name, and provided
another one of those ineffable moments — Bruce
and Clarence demons and Steve Van Zandt all
dancing and singing a round of " little girl
little girl little girl ' and you could see her
walking toward you because Bruce had told this
story about her and you knew he'd start singing
any second
There 1 go. It j hard to understand if you
haven't been there, but people really do yell
"Bruce is God'" and it doesn't seem silly. If
Springsteen and Billy Graham have anything in
common, it's that they're both consummate
showmen, and a Springsteen concert resembles
nothing more than a roaring revival meeting Peo
ple make a lot of noise, but they're polite, they
don't shove, and they don't comedown front to get
their salvation until Bruce tells them to
And when they go home, they tell their friends
about it. And play the records And before you
know it. in spite of Jon Landau and Time and
News iceek and three years without an album.
Bruce Springsteen is a hero. A god And those of us
who used to have to wear headphones when we
played "Growing Up" are a little bewildered with
it all. But loyalty has its rewards, and wediehards
know something the rest of you don't Bruce isn't
a god. He isn't a hero. He's something better, and
he knows it: he's a rocker.

The night of December 17. 1978. Springsteen
played to a full house at Winterland in San Fran
cisco. He came back to the Bay Area last Monday
night. 21 months later, and 10.000 people who were
lucky enough to get tickets came to the Oakland
Coliseum to hear him They all knew he could
sing. Somewhere between those two concerts
Bruce Springsteen arrived — and brought the
future with him. Right now. Springsteen is rock,
past, present and future. No one else even comes
close.
How did it happen 0 Why is it that, as Dave
Marsh says, "... in his absence, Springsteen's
legend has mushroomed 0 ' His last concert was
nearly two years ago: 29 months elapsed between
Darkness On The Ed f>e of Tou n, his last album,
and The River, released early in October Three
years ago Springsteen was a closet idol; this
year, there have been 76,<H)() ticket requests for
two December concerts in Madison Square
Garden — enough for 16 sell-outs.
Why? Well, if you saw the show at the Coliseum
last week, you know it doesn't matter. Bruce
Springsteen deserves all the adulation anyone
cares to give him. regardless of his reasons. It
was. simply put, the best rock concert I.and eve
ryone else there, had ever seen — the best songs,
the best singing, the best band, the best fun. It was
probably as good as a rock concert can be
If you weren't there, there's not much more I
can tell you. Describing a Springsteen concert
must be a little like describing how you found God
-- you know something wonderful happened, but
it's impossible to recount it coherently. All you
have left are random images.
Like Bruce and the E Street Band striding on
stage at 8:30 (the future was a half-hour late but

after three years no one was going to quibble i, and
ripping into " Born To Run before the house
lights went off and the yelling could die down The
yelling never stopped that trademarked. low
rumble during every break. "Bruce' Bruce'
Bruce' " Four hours later after two encores. 31
songs, five dives into the audience, and a change
of shirts. Bruce stalked off the stage as unaffec
tedly as he had appeared, with no fanfare, and the
crowd still rumbling Bruce' Bruce' "
It was a decidedly new show — he played 17 of
The Hii rr's 20 songs, and all but three numbers
came off of his last three albums But there were
no new songs < that is. original, unrecorded
songsi. unless you count the lead-in to "I Wanna
Marry You." which could be called "Here She
Comes" for lack of a better name, and provided
another one of those ineffable moments — Bruce
and Clarence demons and Steve Van Zandt all
dancing and singing a round of " little girl
little girl little girl ' and you could see her
walking toward you because Bruce had told this
story about her and you knew he'd start singing
any second
There 1 go. It j hard to understand if you
haven't been there, but people really do yell
"Bruce is God'" and it doesn't seem silly. If
Springsteen and Billy Graham have anything in
common, it's that they're both consummate
showmen, and a Springsteen concert resembles
nothing more than a roaring revival meeting Peo
ple make a lot of noise, but they're polite, they
don't shove, and they don't comedown front to get
their salvation until Bruce tells them to
And when they go home, they tell their friends
about it. And play the records And before you
know it. in spite of Jon Landau and Time and
News iceek and three years without an album.
Bruce Springsteen is a hero. A god And those of us
who used to have to wear headphones when we
played "Growing Up" are a little bewildered with
it all. But loyalty has its rewards, and wediehards
know something the rest of you don't Bruce isn't
a god. He isn't a hero. He's something better, and
he knows it: he's a rocker.

There was a time when you had to defend Bruce
Springsteen Just three years ago. you had to tell
people that he could sing, that his songs didn't all
sound the same, that he really was God and Buddy
Holly all rolled in one You knew he was the future
of rock and roll, but it seemed like the future
would never arrive
