# Springsteen: the album
## 
### Ron Lillejord 
Bruce Springsteen's The
River is often a work of such ov
erwhelming passion that your
first reaction to it may be tears.
But this album won't let you get
away that easy: it's also pow
ered by extraordinary con
fidence. mature vision and a
rocking, danceable. cocky style
— on top of everything else, its
the perfect party record.
That's no small accomplish
ment. obviously. In all, The
River is an affirmation of
Springsteen's gigantic talent;
has there been another rocker
who's grown so much with each
record — and achieved the suc
cess on his own terms? And. of
course, this album firmly ce
ments the E Street Band's sta
tus as one of the greatest units in
rock history.
The River is a significant ad
vance for Springsteen in two
basic areas. After many at
tempts. he's finally created a
live-sounding record; the
thematic concerns of his studio
work have finally merged with
his loose, no-holds-barred stage
persona.
And lyrically. Springsteen
has created a record so packed
with basic emotions that almost
every line seems to evoke a vital
memory. The mythic, vast land
scape of "The Promised Land"
and the stylized street scenes of
"Jungleland" have been re
placed by the density and power
of such compact rockers as
"The Ties That Bind" and "Two
Hearts." The songs here have
been reduced, with some loss of
texture, to their most crucial
elements — sometimes just the
chorus.

The River is simply about
love — its warmth, its ten
derness. its uncertainty, its
frustrations, its costs, but above
all, its absolute necessity. The
richness and the bleakness are
both presented with equal force.
Springsteen keeps just enough
distance to present these dif
ferent feelings, but his total
commitment and compassion
get you to feel the heat.
Past Springsteen songs would
fit right in to this record —
''Thunder Road,''
"Baekstreets" and "Sandy"
are only the most obvious ex
amples — but Springsteen has
taken advantage of the ex
pansiveness of the two-record
set to really balance his view
points. something he really
hasn't tried before.
Many of the songs comple
ment or supplement each other.
"Hungry Heart" may at first
sound inconsequential, an up
beat ditty about a husband's es
cape, but the haunting "Stolen
Car" — with the man who left
his family fearing he'll disap
pear into the darkness — belies
that initial impression,
The most obvious couplet is
"I Want to Marry You" and
"The River." "Marry You" is
sung in a not-quite-hopeful,
quavering voice: "To say I'll
make your dreams come true
it nuld be wrong/But maybe,

dnrlin,' I could help them
along." The singer doesn't deny
that true love is probably a lie,
but he's willing to plunge ahead
anyway.
In "The River," the hopes of
"Marry You" were either never
there or have been crushed. The
young couple have been trapped
into an empty marriage, and
near the end. in a blood-curdling
voice, the singer asks "Is a
dream a lie if it don't come
true/()r is it something worse? "
To be without love is to wel
come this kind of hopelessness.
The character in Darkness on
the Edge of Town — or in earlier
Springsteen records — who
could conquer everything
himself now finds that he needs
someone. There's a verse in
"The Ties That Bind." the
album's opening (and best)
song, that is the key to the whole
record:
/ would rather feel the hurt
inside, yes I would darlin'
Than know the emptiness
your heart must hide,
Yes I would darlin,' yes I
would darlin'
And through all 20 songs,
Springsteen doggedly pursues
this theme, from the kid's
boastfulness of "I'm a Rocker"
and "Ramrod" to the young
man's explanation to his father
of why he's leaving home in the
moving ballad "Independence
Day," to the lover's sorrow in
"Fade Away."
But many of the past Spring
steen concerns remain. Nothing
comes without a price in a
Springsteen song; every action
has a consequence, and you bet
ter face up to it. Those who've
beaten a retreat, who've given
up, aren't spared — they're left
to face the kind of hellhole that

is "Jackson Cage."
Both "Jackson Cage" and the
troubling "Point Blank" are a
depiction of the brutalization of
that kind of choice. As in the
Clash's "Working for the
Clampdown" those who become
part of the system, and won't
stand up and fight, end up be
coming the leaders of the same
repression. "Twisted up to be
come just another part of it," as
Springsteen sings in "Point
Blank ." "Did you forget how to
love. girl, did you forget how to
fight ?" he asks near the end, in
a quiet, anguished voice. The
singer loves the woman in the
song, but there's nothing he can
do to help — she's made her
choice and she's a stranger to
him now. The song is one of
pure, irrevocable desolation.
Max Weinberg's drums are
The River's driving force. Wein
berg often reminds me of
Charlie Watts, driving the beat
harder and harder: at the next
moment he plays with Keith
Moon's abandon. Weinberg is
the perfect drummer for E
Street; I don't think there's any
thing he can't do.
And guitarist "Miami" Steve
Van Zandt's contribution is evi
dent throughout the record. Van
Zandt loves the R & B-fiavored
rock sounds of the early '60s (he
proved that on the first South
side Johnny records), and he in
fuses the album with that spirit.
For the first time, he's listed as
a co-producer (with Springsteen
and Jon Landau), and his har
mony vocals lend a soulful, live
feeling to many of the tracks,
for example "Out on the
Street".
Led by the unequalled
Clarence Clemons, the re
mainder of the E Street Band
live up to their enormous repu

tation. demons' sax lends
warmth to songs like the frat
rocker "Sherry Darling"' and
gives full-bodied strength to the
forlorn ballad "Drive All
Night." Pianist Roy Bittan's
contribution is smaller than
that of past records, but he and
organist Danny Federici pro
vide flawless keyboard work
throughout. Bassist Garry
Tallent works perfectly with
drummer Weinberg: Tallent es
pecially shines on the rocker
"Cadillac Ranch."
Then, of course, there is
Springsteen He's trying out dif
ferent vocal styles, especially
on "Hungry Heart;" but he
takes his most breathtaking
risks on the album's last two
songs, "Drive All Night" and
"Wreck on the Highway."
"Drive All Night" is an eight
minute lament, with Spring
steen begging for his lover's re
turn. "Wreck on the Highway"
is almost too simple, and a
downbeat end to the record, but
in both songs Springsteen,
stripped naked, without the
huge band sound to back him, al
lows himself to be vulnerable —
an atypical pose for a rocker.
It's that vulnerability that
makes this record such a special
one; Springsteen seems — with
a little uncertainty — to be ad
vancing on to another level.
Prior to the release of this re
cord. one of the few remaining
unanswered questions about
Springsteen was whether he
could mature and keep the rock
and roll spirit at the same time.
The answer here is a resounding
yes. The River is thus both an af
firmation and a challenge: can
his growing audience mature
along with him?
This particular fan thinks we
can.

Springsteen He's trying out dif
ferent vocal styles, especially
on "Hungry Heart;" but he
takes his most breathtaking
risks on the album's last two
songs, "Drive All Night" and
"Wreck on the Highway."
"Drive All Night" is an eight
minute lament, with Spring
steen begging for his lover's re
turn. "Wreck on the Highway"
is almost too simple, and a
downbeat end to the record, but
in both songs Springsteen,
stripped naked, without the
huge band sound to back him, al
lows himself to be vulnerable —
an atypical pose for a rocker.
It's that vulnerability that
makes this record such a special
one; Springsteen seems — with
a little uncertainty — to be ad
vancing on to another level.
Prior to the release of this re
cord. one of the few remaining
unanswered questions about
Springsteen was whether he
could mature and keep the rock
and roll spirit at the same time.
The answer here is a resounding
yes. The River is thus both an af
firmation and a challenge: can
his growing audience mature
along with him?
This particular fan thinks we
can.
Bruce Springsteen's The
River is often a work of such ov
erwhelming passion that your
first reaction to it may be tears.
But this album won't let you get
away that easy: it's also pow
ered by extraordinary con
fidence. mature vision and a
rocking, danceable. cocky style
— on top of everything else, its
the perfect party record.
That's no small accomplish
ment. obviously. In all, The
River is an affirmation of
Springsteen's gigantic talent;
has there been another rocker
who's grown so much with each
record — and achieved the suc
cess on his own terms? And. of
course, this album firmly ce
ments the E Street Band's sta
tus as one of the greatest units in
rock history.
The River is a significant ad
vance for Springsteen in two
basic areas. After many at
tempts. he's finally created a
live-sounding record; the
thematic concerns of his studio
work have finally merged with
his loose, no-holds-barred stage
persona.
And lyrically. Springsteen
has created a record so packed
with basic emotions that almost
every line seems to evoke a vital
memory. The mythic, vast land
scape of "The Promised Land"
and the stylized street scenes of
"Jungleland" have been re
placed by the density and power
of such compact rockers as
"The Ties That Bind" and "Two
Hearts." The songs here have
been reduced, with some loss of
texture, to their most crucial
elements — sometimes just the
chorus.

The River is simply about
love — its warmth, its ten
derness. its uncertainty, its
frustrations, its costs, but above
all, its absolute necessity. The
richness and the bleakness are
both presented with equal force.
Springsteen keeps just enough
distance to present these dif
ferent feelings, but his total
commitment and compassion
get you to feel the heat.
Past Springsteen songs would
fit right in to this record —
''Thunder Road,''
"Baekstreets" and "Sandy"
are only the most obvious ex
amples — but Springsteen has
taken advantage of the ex
pansiveness of the two-record
set to really balance his view
points. something he really
hasn't tried before.
Many of the songs comple
ment or supplement each other.
"Hungry Heart" may at first
sound inconsequential, an up
beat ditty about a husband's es
cape, but the haunting "Stolen
Car" — with the man who left
his family fearing he'll disap
pear into the darkness — belies
that initial impression,
The most obvious couplet is

dnrlin,' I could help them
along." The singer doesn't deny
that true love is probably a lie,
but he's willing to plunge ahead
anyway.
In "The River," the hopes of
"Marry You" were either never
there or have been crushed. The
young couple have been trapped
into an empty marriage, and
near the end. in a blood-curdling
voice, the singer asks "Is a
dream a lie if it don't come
true/()r is it something worse? "
To be without love is to wel
come this kind of hopelessness.
The character in Darkness on
the Edge of Town — or in earlier
Springsteen records — who
could conquer everything
himself now finds that he needs
someone. There's a verse in
"The Ties That Bind." the
album's opening (and best)
song, that is the key to the whole
record:
/ would rather feel the hurt
inside, yes I would darlin'
Than know the emptiness
your heart must hide,
Yes I would darlin,' yes I
would darlin'
And through all 20 songs,
Springsteen doggedly pursues
this theme, from the kid's
boastfulness of "I'm a Rocker"
and "Ramrod" to the young
man's explanation to his father
of why he's leaving home in the
moving ballad "Independence
Day," to the lover's sorrow in
"Fade Away."
But many of the past Spring
steen concerns remain. Nothing
comes without a price in a
Springsteen song; every action
has a consequence, and you bet
ter face up to it. Those who've
beaten a retreat, who've given
up, aren't spared — they're left
to face the kind of hellhole that

is "Jackson Cage."
Both "Jackson Cage" and the
troubling "Point Blank" are a
depiction of the brutalization of
that kind of choice. As in the
Clash's "Working for the
Clampdown" those who become
part of the system, and won't
stand up and fight, end up be
coming the leaders of the same
repression. "Twisted up to be
come just another part of it," as
Springsteen sings in "Point
Blank ." "Did you forget how to
love. girl, did you forget how to
fight ?" he asks near the end, in
a quiet, anguished voice. The
singer loves the woman in the
song, but there's nothing he can
do to help — she's made her
choice and she's a stranger to
him now. The song is one of
pure, irrevocable desolation.
Max Weinberg's drums are
The River's driving force. Wein
berg often reminds me of
Charlie Watts, driving the beat
harder and harder: at the next
moment he plays with Keith
Moon's abandon. Weinberg is
the perfect drummer for E
Street; I don't think there's any
thing he can't do.
And guitarist "Miami" Steve
Van Zandt's contribution is evi
dent throughout the record. Van
Zandt loves the R & B-fiavored
rock sounds of the early '60s (he
proved that on the first South
side Johnny records), and he in
fuses the album with that spirit.
For the first time, he's listed as
a co-producer (with Springsteen
and Jon Landau), and his har
mony vocals lend a soulful, live
feeling to many of the tracks,
for example "Out on the
Street".
Led by the unequalled
Clarence Clemons, the re
mainder of the E Street Band
live up to their enormous repu

warmth to songs like the frat

gives full-bodied strength to the
forlorn ballad "Drive All

contribution is smaller than
that of past records, but he and
organist Danny Federici pro

throughout. Bassist Garry

drummer Weinberg: Tallent es

"Drive All Night" is an eight

stripped naked, without the

an atypical pose for a rocker.
It's that vulnerability that
makes this record such a special

a little uncertainty — to be ad

Prior to the release of this re
cord. one of the few remaining
unanswered questions about
Springsteen was whether he
could mature and keep the rock
and roll spirit at the same time.
The answer here is a resounding
yes. The River is thus both an af
firmation and a challenge: can
his growing audience mature
along with him?
This particular fan thinks we
can.
Bruce Springsteen's The
River is often a work of such ov
erwhelming passion that your
first reaction to it may be tears.
But this album won't let you get
away that easy: it's also pow
ered by extraordinary con
fidence. mature vision and a
rocking, danceable. cocky style
— on top of everything else, its
the perfect party record.
That's no small accomplish
ment. obviously. In all, The
River is an affirmation of
Springsteen's gigantic talent;
has there been another rocker
who's grown so much with each
record — and achieved the suc
cess on his own terms? And. of
course, this album firmly ce
ments the E Street Band's sta
tus as one of the greatest units in
rock history.
The River is a significant ad
vance for Springsteen in two
basic areas. After many at
tempts. he's finally created a
live-sounding record; the
thematic concerns of his studio
work have finally merged with
his loose, no-holds-barred stage
persona.
And lyrically. Springsteen
has created a record so packed
with basic emotions that almost
every line seems to evoke a vital
memory. The mythic, vast land
scape of "The Promised Land"
and the stylized street scenes of
"Jungleland" have been re
placed by the density and power
of such compact rockers as
"The Ties That Bind" and "Two
Hearts." The songs here have
been reduced, with some loss of
texture, to their most crucial
elements — sometimes just the
chorus.

The River is simply about
love — its warmth, its ten
derness. its uncertainty, its
frustrations, its costs, but above
all, its absolute necessity. The
richness and the bleakness are
both presented with equal force.
Springsteen keeps just enough
distance to present these dif
ferent feelings, but his total
commitment and compassion
get you to feel the heat.
Past Springsteen songs would
fit right in to this record —
''Thunder Road,''
"Baekstreets" and "Sandy"
are only the most obvious ex
amples — but Springsteen has
taken advantage of the ex
pansiveness of the two-record
set to really balance his view
points. something he really
hasn't tried before.
Many of the songs comple
ment or supplement each other.
"Hungry Heart" may at first
sound inconsequential, an up
beat ditty about a husband's es
cape, but the haunting "Stolen
Car" — with the man who left
his family fearing he'll disap
pear into the darkness — belies
that initial impression,
The most obvious couplet is
"I Want to Marry You" and
"The River." "Marry You" is
sung in a not-quite-hopeful,
quavering voice: "To say I'll
make your dreams come true
it nuld be wrong/But maybe,

The Big Man
dnrlin,' I could help them
along." The singer doesn't deny
that true love is probably a lie,
but he's willing to plunge ahead
anyway.
In "The River," the hopes of
"Marry You" were either never
there or have been crushed. The
young couple have been trapped
into an empty marriage, and
near the end. in a blood-curdling
voice, the singer asks "Is a
dream a lie if it don't come
true/()r is it something worse? "
To be without love is to wel
come this kind of hopelessness.
The character in Darkness on
the Edge of Town — or in earlier
Springsteen records — who
could conquer everything
himself now finds that he needs
someone. There's a verse in
"The Ties That Bind." the
album's opening (and best)
song, that is the key to the whole
record:
/ would rather feel the hurt
inside, yes I would darlin'
Than know the emptiness
your heart must hide,
Yes I would darlin,' yes I
would darlin'
And through all 20 songs,
Springsteen doggedly pursues
this theme, from the kid's
boastfulness of "I'm a Rocker"
and "Ramrod" to the young
man's explanation to his father
of why he's leaving home in the
moving ballad "Independence
Day," to the lover's sorrow in
"Fade Away."
But many of the past Spring
steen concerns remain. Nothing
comes without a price in a
Springsteen song; every action
has a consequence, and you bet
ter face up to it. Those who've
beaten a retreat, who've given
up, aren't spared — they're left
to face the kind of hellhole that

is "Jackson Cage."
Both "Jackson Cage" and the
troubling "Point Blank" are a
depiction of the brutalization of
that kind of choice. As in the
Clash's "Working for the
Clampdown" those who become
part of the system, and won't
stand up and fight, end up be
coming the leaders of the same
repression. "Twisted up to be
come just another part of it," as
Springsteen sings in "Point
Blank ." "Did you forget how to
love. girl, did you forget how to
fight ?" he asks near the end, in
a quiet, anguished voice. The
singer loves the woman in the
song, but there's nothing he can
do to help — she's made her
choice and she's a stranger to
him now. The song is one of
pure, irrevocable desolation.
Max Weinberg's drums are
The River's driving force. Wein
berg often reminds me of
Charlie Watts, driving the beat
harder and harder: at the next
moment he plays with Keith
Moon's abandon. Weinberg is
the perfect drummer for E
Street; I don't think there's any
thing he can't do.
And guitarist "Miami" Steve
Van Zandt's contribution is evi
dent throughout the record. Van
Zandt loves the R & B-fiavored
rock sounds of the early '60s (he
proved that on the first South
side Johnny records), and he in
