# Springsteen: the album
## 
### Ron Lillejord 
Bruce Springsteen's The
River is often a work of such ov
erwhelming passion that your
first reaction to it may be tears.
But this album won't let you get
away that easy: it's also pow
ered by extraordinary con
fidence. mature vision and a
rocking, danceable. cocky style
— on top of everything else, its
the perfect party record.
That's no small accomplish
ment. obviously. In all, The
River is an affirmation of
Springsteen's gigantic talent;
has there been another rocker
who's grown so much with each
record — and achieved the suc
cess on his own terms? And. of
course, this album firmly ce
ments the E Street Band's sta
tus as one of the greatest units in
rock history.
The River is a significant ad
vance for Springsteen in two
basic areas. After many at
tempts. he's finally created a
live-sounding record; the
thematic concerns of his studio
work have finally merged with
his loose, no-holds-barred stage
persona.
And lyrically. Springsteen
has created a record so packed
with basic emotions that almost
every line seems to evoke a vital
memory. The mythic, vast land
scape of "The Promised Land"
and the stylized street scenes of
"Jungleland" have been re
placed by the density and power
of such compact rockers as
"The Ties That Bind" and "Two
Hearts." The songs here have
been reduced, with some loss of
texture, to their most crucial
elements — sometimes just the
chorus.

The River is simply about
love — its warmth, its ten
derness. its uncertainty, its
frustrations, its costs, but above
all, its absolute necessity. The
richness and the bleakness are
both presented with equal force.
Springsteen keeps just enough
distance to present these dif
ferent feelings, but his total
commitment and compassion
get you to feel the heat.
Past Springsteen songs would
fit right in to this record —
''Thunder Road,''
"Baekstreets" and "Sandy"
are only the most obvious ex
amples — but Springsteen has
taken advantage of the ex
pansiveness of the two-record
set to really balance his view
points. something he really
hasn't tried before.
Many of the songs comple
ment or supplement each other.
"Hungry Heart" may at first
sound inconsequential, an up
beat ditty about a husband's es
cape, but the haunting "Stolen
Car" — with the man who left
his family fearing he'll disap
pear into the darkness — belies
that initial impression,
The most obvious couplet is
"I Want to Marry You" and
"The River." "Marry You" is
sung in a not-quite-hopeful,
quavering voice: "To say I'll
make your dreams come true
it nuld be wrong/But maybe,
