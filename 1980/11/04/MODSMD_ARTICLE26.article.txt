# Stanford hosts a delayed premiere of Futurist ballet
## 
### Marty Rapkin 
Igor Stravinsky's Feu d Artifice is a very
short ballet About three minutes and 50 sec
onds short What kind of ballet lasts only three
minutes and 50 seconds 9 A ballet without dan
cers. The Feu d Artifice is a ballet of light
Last Wednesday night it made its American
premiere performance to a full house in Stan
ford's Little Theatre.
This "ballet without dancers," as its
"choreographer"-set designer Giacomo Balla
dubbed it in 1916. is an example of "synthetic
theatre." a type of theatre characteristic of
the Futurist movement in Italy in which Balla
was a leading figure. Synthetic theatre was an
attempt on the part of the Futurists to create a
theatrical spectacle which in the words of
F T. Marinetti. the vocal cord of the Futurist
movement. ". . . compresses into a few
minutes, into a few words and gestures, in
numerable situations, sensibilities, ideas,
sensations, facts, svmbols . . ." When in 1916

the great Russian impressario Sergio
Diaghilev commissioned Balla to design the
set for an experimental ballet to be put to the
short musical fantasy of Stravinsky, Balla
looked for a way to project the "dynamic sen
sation" of movement through the interaction
of inanimate objects with light and color The
Futurists believed the portrayal of movement
to be the primary subject of modern art.
The stage set. which normally takes on a
functional or decorative role in theatre, is
transformed by Balla into the central pro
tagonist of his drama. The set for the Feu
d'Artifice is composed of geometrical, three
dimensional, free standing forms. These
forms built of plywood and translucent gauze
paper are variously shaped and colorfully
painted Hidden off to the sides, in front of, be
hind. and inside the figures are a total of 200
stage lights. They are to be the ephemeral
dancers in the Feu d'Artifice. They will bring
life to the painted wood.

As the curtain opens upon an ink black stage
the evocative music of Stravinsky initiates the
dialogue of light and color The sigh of a violin
works like a magic wand to spark the il
lumination of a single figure As the music
figures of colored wood and paper
enter the drama and take on a particular char
acter You are compelled to accept the per
sonification of these inanimate forms and the
human quality of their interaction Precon
ceptions of theatrical space and time are shat
tered as you are witness to an orchestration of
motion without movement. Within four
minutes there are 49 lighting changes, all in
tempo and resolving to a furious ending which
leaves one feeling more like an accomplice
than a spectator.
After the second performance of Feu
dArtifice (Yes. there were two. At four
minutes a shot, why not 9 ) Simone Carella, the
director of the Roman underground theatre
Beat 72 and the person responsible for the re
construction of Feu dArtifice for contem

porary theatre, spoke to the audience Carella
explained that one of the main reasons he
chose to do Feu d Artifice was because Balla
had left an extraordinarily detailed plan for
the construction of the set design and lighting
cues For Carella this was a historically
unique opportunity to reconstruct an impec
cable model of the set and render a per
formance faithful to the conception of the ar
tist Another reason Carella chose the Feu
d Artifice was because it never opened.
It was sometime in early April of 1917
during a dress rehearsal of Feu d'Artifice that
the lighting system decided it couldn't take
the strain and expired in one uneventful puff
of smoke. Before the lighting system could be
resuscitated Diaghilev and Balla took to ver
bal fisticuffs and decided to end their short
lived collaboration Consequently, there nev
er was an opening night in 1917. It took 60
years between that dress rehearsal and open
ing night, but finally the Carella reconstruc
tion premiered at the Teatro Constanzi in

Home where ironically, it had been scheduled
to open in 1917
Through the collaboration of the Italian
government with the Italian Cultural Institute
of San Francisco, the Dept of French and Ital
ian. the Drama Dept and La Casa Italiana. Si
mone Carella and his assistants Mario Ro
mano and Roberto Tortorella were brought to
Stanford to construct the set and produce the
American premiere
As is common in the opening of many avant -
garde works the reaction of the Stanford au
dience to Feu d'Artificc was mixed. But to this
writer's knowledge no noted reaction has
come close in its critical acumen to that left to
us by Igor Stravinsky, who after having seen
the Feu d'Artifice in rehearsal in 1917 wrote
"I couldn't have described it even at the
time as anything more than a few splashes of
paint on an otherwise empty backcloth I do
remember that it baffled the audience, how
ever."
