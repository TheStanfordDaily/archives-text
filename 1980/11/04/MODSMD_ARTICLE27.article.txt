# Police/Pop satisfies
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
It seemed strangely appropriate on this night of
goblins and witches that one of Europe's hottest
bands. The Police, displayed the greatest magic.
Even the genie next to me was impressed.
The evening began with Iggy Pop. one of the
better (and alder) students in the Johnny Rotten
School of Punk. The power and the energy were
there, and more than once I wished my genie
could have made a little pogoing room out of our
cramped legspace. Unfortunately, the spit-in
vour-eve. foot-in-the-balls hostility that made the
Sex Pistols what they were was entirely lost on
Iggy and his band. Instead, we were treated to
spasmodic flailing and an occasional simian-like
display of Iggy's unbuttoned pants and unzipped
fly.
The overall effect was not unlike an epileptic
Howler Monkey with a microphone and a backup
band that knew several different ways of playing
the same set of chords.
For a halftime show, we got a parade of cos
tumes across the stage, emceed by an obnoxious
gorilla who thought he was punk's answer to Bill
Murray.
The costumes themselves rcinged from
"bordering on genius" (such as the half-Hitler,
half-18th Century Jeffersonian and the elaborate
Necron-99 assassin and steed from the animation
fantasy Wizards) to the mundane stab at greed
(i.e. the woman wearing a scanty dress and "put
the mike up to my crotch and I'll show you why I
should win the $500").
When mixed in with the blatant sexism of the
judges (Iggy: "Let's get that blonde with the fat
ass up here again") and the appeals to blatant sex
ism on the part of some of the contestants, it was
with some relief that we saw the emcee finally
scrap any sense of fairness and stop the parade,
autocratically declaring the 50-50
Hitler/Jefferson the winner.
Finally, and with great enthusiasm from the
less-than-capacity crowd, The Police were wel
comed onstage. That was when the freak show
ended and the real entertainment began.
The question in my mind was whether this trio
— hailed as the best threesome out of Britain
since Cream — could reproduce the wizardry they
had so masterfully applied to their three popular
studio albums. At first, {.he spell's effectiveness
was in doubt. "Don't Stand So Close To Me," from
the group's newly released Zenyatta Mondatta,
and "Walking on the Moon." from the more solid

Regatta de Blanc album were a little lackluster
and one could sense the audience waiting for a
catalyst that would set off an evening of rhvthm
paced auditory euphoria.
They didn't have to wait long.
Breaking into "Deathwish" with all the subtle
ty of a right cross to the jaw, The Police never
thereafter let the audience down, proving unques
tioningly why they are held in such esteem across
the Atlantic.
Although bassist Sting and guitarist Andy Sum
mers both made good use of an electronic box of
tricks to give their live sound the fuller, more
haunting quality that characterizes their studio
work, it was a pleasant surprise to note the skill
with which the band used the simpler live sound to
best advantage. Throughout the one-hour-plus set;
The Police transformed raw sound into raw
energy, turning even the more moderatelv-paced
numbers into driving, body-swaving statements
of musical gospel.
The Police's unique signature of
African/reggae-influenced rhythms kept the au
dience bouncing through a well-conceived mix
ture of songs from all three albums, ranging from
the non-stop frenzy of "Truth Hits Everybody" to
the barely restrained fury of "Driven to Tears."
Though much could be said about Summers'
manic chording and Stewart Copeland's flawless
drumming, the focus of attention, as usual, was
bassist/vocalist Sting. It is Sting's bass playing
that drives The Police, though he is rarely flashy
about it. Only on "When the World Is Running
Down, You Make The Best Of What's Still
Around" (whew) did he really let loose with a
pounding solo; the rest of the time he was content
to let his intricate phrasing speak softly and carry
a big impact.
If his bass playing was not overtly charismatic,
his stage presence certainly was. Looking and act
ing very comfortable on stage. Sting alternately
cajoled and charmed the audience, at times lead
ing a songfest that sounded impressive for the
smallness of the audience. Like so many great
performers. Sting held the crowd in his hands for
most of the show.
As the final chords of their first hit, "Rox
anne," signaled the end of an hour's music, the
crowd showed its customary appreciation. The
first encore was a substantial reward as the trio —
hotter and more frenzied than ever — launched
into "Can't Stand Losing You" into "Regatta de
Blanc" into "Be My Girl" and back into "Can t
Stand Losing You."
Then, for the second bow, they raced through'
excellent versions of "Next to You" and "So
Lonely," leaving the audience satisfied, yet wish
ing for more. (So what else is new?)
So it was fitting that as the toxic shocks and the
clowns and the gypsies and the mummies and all
their friends filed out of "Winterland Revisited,"
the costumes meant nothing anymore. Their mag
ic had been stolen.
However, nobody seemed to mind.
