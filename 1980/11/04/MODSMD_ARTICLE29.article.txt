# A 						drab Knife in the Head
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Despite all that has been written in the last five
years about new life in the German film industry,
most of Utfc movies sent over here are flat, sterile
Knife in the Head is not a bad movie, but it is re
lentlessly glum: even the photography is
bloodless. The director, Reinhard Hauff. knows
what he is doing, but our recognition that the mov
ie is intentionally depressing is no reassurance.
The movie is about Hoffman (Bruno Ganz), a
biogeneticist whose more or less estranged wife,
Ann (Angela Winkler), works at a youth center
that is the headquarters for a left-wing group
roundly denounced by the police and press as a
band of terrorists. During a police raid, Hoffman
— who is not a member of the group — is shot in
the head by a cop. For the rest of the movie, we
follow the process of his convalescence and his
growth into the realization that he is being used by
both the police, who call him a terrorist, and the
political activists, who portray him as a helpless
victim of police brutality in order to advance their
own cause.
Peter Schneider's screenplay is not unin
telligent but there is really nothing in it about ma
nipulation and identity that needs to be said at this
moment — particularly since it's all been said
before. When you watch Bruno Ganz as Hoffman
slamming his fist into his forehead, talking about
himself in the third person, and dropping steel
weighted lines like "Hoffman is not Hoffman"
and"I am nobody," you may see Hamlet with a
bullet in his skull but you're more likely to flash
back to all the characters in Antonioni's and
Bergman's movies who have striven ang.sf-fully
to find out who they are. Is this supposed to betm
other political statement?

Certainly it is true that German cinema, like
German literature, is sill struggling to find out
what, after Hitler and the Holocaust. Germany is
— but there is something loathsome about excus
ing all of this monochromatic drifting in movies
like Knife in the Head and the Fassbinder pic
tures bv interpreting it in a political light The sur
prise in The Tin Drum was how charming and
funny much of the first half was — before the mov
ie began to twist itself half a dozen different ways
to squeeze out political profundities.
There is an element in this kind of filmmaking
— the suggestion that this ugliness is real life, and
we can only become better people by having our
noses rubbed in it — that enrages me. (At his
worst. Bergman indulges in this. too.) Not only is
this self-seriousness arrogant, it is also less real
— more theatrical — than most other approaches
to drama. Real life is not as single-tracked or as
humorless as this.
There is. however, one reason to see Knife in
the Head. Bruno Ganz, whom film buffs know
from Wim Wenders's The American Friend and
Werner Herzog's Nosferatu (both of which repre
sent the cream of the recent German crop), gives
a first-rate performance as Hoffman. I've never
been impressed by Ganz before, but I've clearly
underrated him. For the first half hour, we ad
mire his concentration, but his appears to be the
sort of acting that one can applaud without really
feeling close to it or wanting to watch it for very
long; but as Hoffman grows stronger, Ganz's per
formance widens and relaxes, and reveals a com
ic glimmer that seems dazzling in the midst of the
cheerless greys of the movie. He is the movie's
true life force.
