### Theresa Simons 
A Medical School committee has
cited financial hardship, a need for
role models, and a lack of information
about the social role of a doctor as
some of the problems lacing medical
students in a report issued last month
to the Executive Board of the Medical
School.
"Our finding is that there are a lot of
doubts, questions and anxieties in the
minds of medical students which have
not been acknowledged or dealt with
in any systematic way in years past,"
said I)r Peter Rosenbaum. chairman
of the Committee on the Well-being of
Medical Students. He said having such
a committee is the most com
prehensive approach to dealing with
medical student concerns in the coun
try
Psychiatrist Harvey Weinstein of
Cowell Health Services suggested for
mation of the committee to John Stew
ard. associate dean of student affairs
at the Medical School. Weinstein said

there was a need "to make faculty,
staff and students more aware of what
the process of becoming a doctor does
to people."
Twelve to 14 percent of medical stu
dents receive psychological counsel
ing from Cowell. usually for problems
with intimate relationships, accord
ing to Weinstein. He added that the
pressures of medical training fall not
only on medical students, but also on
the * school's "house staff' and. in
directly. on the spouses of medical
students.
Ombudsperson
In its report, the committee sug
gested the establishment of an om
budsperson and an associate dean of
house staff to deal with the special
problems of individuals in the Medical
School and Stanford Hospital
"The Office of Student Affairs has
tried to be very open and receptive to
student concerns over the years." Ro
senbaum said. "But John Steward is
an agent of the University and so there

are certain cases where his hands are
lust tied. He doesn't have the same
kind of impartiality that an om
budsperson would have."
Dean Lawrence Crowley announced
two weeks ago that he has appointed a
committee to look for an om
budsperson and has agreed to take ac
tion on the selection of an associate
dean of house staff
Loan ceiling raised
In addition, the Medical School has
increased the amount of money stu
dents can borrow through Stanford,
according to Lvle Rausch. one of four
medical students who served on the 13-
member committee.
Financial aid policies do not keep up
with the cost of living and tuition ex
penses. Rausch said. "The major
problem, we felt, had to do with the ad
ministration not acknowledging that it
was difficult to put a medical student
in a framework of an undergraduate
type budget."he said.
He cited the extra transportation
costs of hospital trips and living off
campus as examples of expenses
which make current financial aid
budgets unfeasible for medical stu
dents.
Future debts
The increased borrowing option can
improve conditions for medical stu
dents while they are in school, but it
also could limit their career options in
the future. Rausch commented He
said students graduate with an aver
age debt of $25,000 to $40,000.
"This amount of debt, for people
who come out of Stanford with ideal
istic intents to go out and practice in

their communities, sometimes forces
them to go into more lucrative special
ties." he said
The Medical School has not yet
taken action on two related problems
(discussed in the report facuiu .stu
dent relations and student social
ization in medicine. Faculty-student
relationships are the "most problem
atic part of the whole project." Weins
tein said In a questionnaire designed
and implemented by Dr. Susan
Blumenthal. student Patrick Bitter
and Weinstein. 81 percent of the stu
dents who responded said they felt a
lack of ease in sharing concerns with
faculty.
Insensitivitv
One student wrote. "This is not to
say that some members of the faculty
are not very responsive. However,
others are completely insensitive to
student opinions."
Weinstein said differing degrees of
emphasis on research could be a ma
jor cause of faculty-student tensions
"Stanford is defining itself as a medi
cal school whose interest is primarily
in training academic physicians and in
biomedical research, so the faculty is
very interested in inculcating such an
interest in the students," he said
"Some students are unhappy with
that, and I think there is some dis
cordance between students and facul
ty as a result."
The committee recommended that
an optional course on socialization in
medicine be offered for academic
credit at the Medical School to enable
students to discuss problems of physi-
cians such as the balancing of personal
and professional development. Such a
course would involve students more
with faculty. Weinstein said.
Faculty critical
"The role of the faculty is critical in
any process whereby people become
socialized into a profession because
people look for role models," Weins
tein said. He stressed the need for the
course to be taught by practicing phy
sicians in other disciplines besides
psychiatry and psychology for the
purpose of establishing these role
models.
Rausch said there was a lack of fac
ulty response to this suggestion by the

committee. "There are powerful
forces within this institution that think
this is the very last thing medical stu
dents should be spending their time on
and it is those forces that we have to
continue to try to educate." he said
He said courses on socialization are
presently available in other depart
ments but observed that they are giv
en little priority and are not scheduled
at practical times.
"There is a need for a recognition of
the humanistic needs of people who
are going through a very difficult and
strenuous training program that can
make them dehumanized and less con
cerned for their patients." Rausch

lack of ease in sharing concerns with
faculty.

One student wrote. "This is not to
say that some members of the faculty
are not very responsive. However,
others are completely insensitive to
student opinions."
Weinstein said differing degrees of
emphasis on research could be a ma
jor cause of faculty-student tensions
"Stanford is defining itself as a medi
cal school whose interest is primarily
in training academic physicians and in
biomedical research, so the faculty is
very interested in inculcating such an
interest in the students," he said
"Some students are unhappy with
that, and I think there is some dis
cordance between students and facul
ty as a result."
The committee recommended that
an optional course on socialization in
medicine be offered for academic
credit at the Medical School to enable
students to discuss problems of physi-
cians such as the balancing of personal
and professional development. Such a
course would involve students more
with faculty. Weinstein said.
Faculty critical
"The role of the faculty is critical in
any process whereby people become
socialized into a profession because
people look for role models," Weins
tein said. He stressed the need for the
course to be taught by practicing phy
sicians in other disciplines besides
psychiatry and psychology for the
purpose of establishing these role
models.
Rausch said there was a lack of fac
ulty response to this suggestion by the

committee. "There are powerful
forces within this institution that think
this is the very last thing medical stu
dents should be spending their time on
and it is those forces that we have to
continue to try to educate." he said
He said courses on socialization are
presently available in other depart
ments but observed that they are giv
en little priority and are not scheduled
at practical times.
"There is a need for a recognition of
the humanistic needs of people who
are going through a very difficult and
strenuous training program that can
make them dehumanized and less con
cerned for their patients." Rausch
commented.
A Medical School committee has
cited financial hardship, a need for
role models, and a lack of information
about the social role of a doctor as
some of the problems lacing medical
students in a report issued last month
to the Executive Board of the Medical
School.
"Our finding is that there are a lot of
doubts, questions and anxieties in the
minds of medical students which have
not been acknowledged or dealt with
in any systematic way in years past,"
said I)r Peter Rosenbaum. chairman
of the Committee on the Well-being of
Medical Students. He said having such
a committee is the most com
prehensive approach to dealing with
medical student concerns in the coun
try
Psychiatrist Harvey Weinstein of
Cowell Health Services suggested for
mation of the committee to John Stew
ard. associate dean of student affairs
at the Medical School. Weinstein said

there was a need "to make faculty,
staff and students more aware of what
the process of becoming a doctor does
to people."
Twelve to 14 percent of medical stu
dents receive psychological counsel
ing from Cowell. usually for problems
with intimate relationships, accord
ing to Weinstein. He added that the
pressures of medical training fall not
only on medical students, but also on
the * school's "house staff' and. in
directly. on the spouses of medical
students.
Ombudsperson
In its report, the committee sug
gested the establishment of an om
budsperson and an associate dean of
house staff to deal with the special
problems of individuals in the Medical
School and Stanford Hospital
"The Office of Student Affairs has
tried to be very open and receptive to
student concerns over the years." Ro
senbaum said. "But John Steward is
an agent of the University and so there

are certain cases where his hands are
lust tied. He doesn't have the same
kind of impartiality that an om
budsperson would have."
Dean Lawrence Crowley announced
two weeks ago that he has appointed a
committee to look for an om
budsperson and has agreed to take ac
tion on the selection of an associate
dean of house staff
Loan ceiling raised
In addition, the Medical School has
increased the amount of money stu
dents can borrow through Stanford,
according to Lvle Rausch. one of four
medical students who served on the 13-
member committee.
Financial aid policies do not keep up
with the cost of living and tuition ex
penses. Rausch said. "The major
problem, we felt, had to do with the ad
ministration not acknowledging that it
was difficult to put a medical student
in a framework of an undergraduate
type budget."he said.
He cited the extra transportation
costs of hospital trips and living off
campus as examples of expenses
which make current financial aid
budgets unfeasible for medical stu
dents.
Future debts
The increased borrowing option can
improve conditions for medical stu
dents while they are in school, but it
also could limit their career options in
the future. Rausch commented He
said students graduate with an aver
age debt of $25,000 to $40,000.
"This amount of debt, for people
who come out of Stanford with ideal
istic intents to go out and practice in

their communities, sometimes forces
them to go into more lucrative special
ties." he said
The Medical School has not yet
taken action on two related problems

ization in medicine. Faculty-student
