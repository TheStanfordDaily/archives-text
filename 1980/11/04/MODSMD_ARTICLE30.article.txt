# Use canned peaches
## How to stuff a wild bikini 
### Scott Waichler 
The cameraman got smeared with the
vegetable oil ("some men like it. some
don't"), and she stuffed the sliced
peaches into her underwear Her regular
piece gutted, the artist laughed off the
script and threw out the earthworms and
soil at friends in the front row and emp
tied the dresser in a heap More oil. soft
slices, sweet svrup from Del Monte
Those little poois get mixed in with the
clothes; "the actualism of destruction"
needs only a party. This is aborted per
formance art on The Western Front
Many other deserving and obnoxious
acts took place in various venues during
the 10-day. second annual Western Front
festival that ended Oct. 26 in San Fran
cisco. Underground culture "col
laborators" from all over the U.S.. Eng
land and Germany presented music, per
formance art. video, poetry, film, and
the abuse of all these things. The
Western Front was not so much a cele
bration as an assertion of the small but
rapidly growing underground culture
that has recently gotten a tremendous
boost from New Wave rock. While bands
have proliferated, other forms such as
performance art and film have gotten re
newed attention and encouragement.
Exposing conformity to society was
one of the themes that crossed media
boundaries. With artist, costumes,
props, lighting and video, performance
art in particular has the components of
the subject itself to fathom the socially
"in" and the world of fashion. Layers of
Scum performed a piece called Haute
Couture, in which a fashion baroness
narrated while two robotoids, human
units in extreme "peasant" garments,
dark plastic bags, and red boots, demon
strated the "aura" of high fashion.
Performance artist Jeff Stoll con
tinued his ongoing 800 Hoo Train at the

Club Generic using combinations of
boards, tree limbs, and a bamboo pole to
contort himself into "new" positions af
ter he had talked on the phone — "I see
what you mean" as he unbent himself
from the small pieces of two-by-four
More than 40 local bands played, and
many others came from other cities and
from England A wide range of forms,
punk. ska. industrial, reggae, no wave,
and power pop were all played ener
getically Punk groups like the Lewd. the
Tenants. Young Canadians, and VKTMS
played hard and spiritedly, but it seemed
that many of their ideas have been better
said before. The Lubricants brought
their "punk-acid" from Milwaukee, and
the "renowned" Black Flag of L A
played a mash of solid rhythms and
screamed lyrics in their we-don't-fit-in
anvthing attitude After they finished
playing the crowd was on the verge of
physical revolt against the heavy handed
security of The Stone, which is one of
those very tightly run places where they
think you might charge the kitchen, judg
ing by the number of trogs standing
around. Others were onstage ready to
"rescue" the bandmembers from the
clutches of the audience. The crowd up
front clearly didn't like having to hear
Black Flag and Stiff Little Fingers in
that club, and the spontaneous outcry
made one think of the Control surround
ing the punk performance itself.
A street poster exhibition was put on at
Valencia Tool & Die (a storefront
space), featuring advertising and art
posters in categories of collage, his
torical, color Xerox, photographs,
graphics and drawings. Chainsaws,
globes in microwave ovens, crew-cut en
gineers talking about Organization, vi
olent objects placed in hands and faces.
VIPs censored with revolutionaries,
hands of a mob "outside" coming

through a technician's array of TV
monitors. More than just pure attention
getting paper rags, these posters were
very imaginative and in some cases con
tained very effective subtlety.
Some of the films and bands used "in
dustrial' themes. German filmmaker
Christop Dreher brought his Okay. Okay
with its visions of the elemental human
and his enslaving and mystifying in
dustrial landscape Close-up shots of a
straining neck and jaw at the beginning
broke off to high speed run-bvs of
geometrical housing units to the music of
Pere I'bu. The Residents and others
Bulldozers crawled over the vast yellow
earth, overexposed views of waste
dumps, where close-ups revealed char
acter junk Prisons, dictatorial voices,
refinery flames, and many views of the
sunset through wires and power line tow
er lattice, gave way to a man dancing
alone on a roof to the man seen upside
down rushing by in front of identical
facades to the final wide view of him
hanging from a cable of a huge L-shaped
construction crane, swinging around and
around in front of apartment buildings
The film evoked powerful ideas of man
himself as utilized material
The most exciting thing about all the
events was the pervasive interaction be
tween artist and observer With the
bands and many of the performance ar
tists there was yelling and shouting that
at times grew into earnest conversation
Neutral emotion, or at least observation,
was impossible That the poster show
came off so well was partly because eve
ryone was part of it — you had either
made them, known the artist who did. or
seen the groups advertised in them. The
festival's manner was very unpreten
tious. and self-indulgent only so far as en
couraging the notion that everyone has
the ability to appreciate and create.

The cameraman got smeared with the

Many other deserving and obnoxious
acts took place in various venues during
the 10-day. second annual Western Front
festival that ended Oct. 26 in San Fran
cisco. Underground culture "col
laborators" from all over the U.S.. Eng
land and Germany presented music, per
formance art. video, poetry, film, and
the abuse of all these things. The
Western Front was not so much a cele
bration as an assertion of the small but
rapidly growing underground culture
that has recently gotten a tremendous
boost from New Wave rock. While bands
have proliferated, other forms such as
performance art and film have gotten re
newed attention and encouragement.
Exposing conformity to society was
one of the themes that crossed media
boundaries. With artist, costumes,
props, lighting and video, performance
art in particular has the components of
the subject itself to fathom the socially
"in" and the world of fashion. Layers of
Scum performed a piece called Haute
Couture, in which a fashion baroness
narrated while two robotoids, human
units in extreme "peasant" garments,
dark plastic bags, and red boots, demon
strated the "aura" of high fashion.
Performance artist Jeff Stoll con
tinued his ongoing 800 Hoo Train at the

Club Generic using combinations of
boards, tree limbs, and a bamboo pole to
contort himself into "new" positions af
ter he had talked on the phone — "I see
what you mean" as he unbent himself
from the small pieces of two-by-four
More than 40 local bands played, and
many others came from other cities and
from England A wide range of forms,
punk. ska. industrial, reggae, no wave,
and power pop were all played ener
getically Punk groups like the Lewd. the
Tenants. Young Canadians, and VKTMS
played hard and spiritedly, but it seemed
that many of their ideas have been better
said before. The Lubricants brought
their "punk-acid" from Milwaukee, and
the "renowned" Black Flag of L A
played a mash of solid rhythms and
screamed lyrics in their we-don't-fit-in
anvthing attitude After they finished
playing the crowd was on the verge of
physical revolt against the heavy handed
security of The Stone, which is one of
those very tightly run places where they
think you might charge the kitchen, judg
ing by the number of trogs standing
around. Others were onstage ready to
"rescue" the bandmembers from the
clutches of the audience. The crowd up
front clearly didn't like having to hear
Black Flag and Stiff Little Fingers in
that club, and the spontaneous outcry
made one think of the Control surround
ing the punk performance itself.
A street poster exhibition was put on at
Valencia Tool & Die (a storefront
space), featuring advertising and art
posters in categories of collage, his
torical, color Xerox, photographs,
graphics and drawings. Chainsaws,
globes in microwave ovens, crew-cut en
gineers talking about Organization, vi
olent objects placed in hands and faces.
VIPs censored with revolutionaries,
hands of a mob "outside" coming

through a technician's array of TV
monitors. More than just pure attention
getting paper rags, these posters were
very imaginative and in some cases con
tained very effective subtlety.
Some of the films and bands used "in
dustrial' themes. German filmmaker
Christop Dreher brought his Okay. Okay
with its visions of the elemental human
and his enslaving and mystifying in
dustrial landscape Close-up shots of a
straining neck and jaw at the beginning
broke off to high speed run-bvs of
geometrical housing units to the music of
Pere I'bu. The Residents and others
Bulldozers crawled over the vast yellow
earth, overexposed views of waste
dumps, where close-ups revealed char
acter junk Prisons, dictatorial voices,
refinery flames, and many views of the
sunset through wires and power line tow
er lattice, gave way to a man dancing
alone on a roof to the man seen upside
down rushing by in front of identical
facades to the final wide view of him
hanging from a cable of a huge L-shaped
construction crane, swinging around and
around in front of apartment buildings
The film evoked powerful ideas of man
himself as utilized material
The most exciting thing about all the
events was the pervasive interaction be
tween artist and observer With the
bands and many of the performance ar
tists there was yelling and shouting that
at times grew into earnest conversation
Neutral emotion, or at least observation,
was impossible That the poster show
came off so well was partly because eve
ryone was part of it — you had either
