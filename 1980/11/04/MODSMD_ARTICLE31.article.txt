Russian warships off Thailand
Bangkok. Thailand — The Thai government yes
terday asked the Soviet embassy to explain the pres
ence of four Russian warships, including the heli
copter carrier Minsk, in the Gulf of Thailand

Thai and Western diplomats speculated that the
Soviet naval force was sending a message to Thai
land and. bv extension to the United States. Thai
land's ally
The Soviet ships made their appearance the day
after Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda re
turned from a friendly visit to China. Moscow's rival
for power in the region
A Thai foreign ministry spokesman said the Sovi
et ambassador was not summoned to hear a protest
but to present an explanation There was no ground
for protest because the Soviet ships were in interna
tional waters more than 50 miles off the Thai coast
when spotted Saturday by a Thai fishing boat
State death penalty upheld
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday set
aside a ruling that had blocked California prose
cutors from seeking thedeath penalty in "especially
heinous, atrocious or cruel" murder cases.
By a 6-3 vote, the justices told the California
courts to restudy decisions striking down that por
tion of the state's capital punishment law as un
constitutionally vague
The Supreme Court also agreed to decide whether
individuals can dispose of their assets for less than
fair value and still qualify for certain types of Medi
caid
The appeal was filed on behalf of senior citizens
denied assistance for the medically needy under
California's Medi-Cal program because they trans
ferred assets for less than fair value
The state of California claims that if its rule were
overturned "any person could qualify" for as
sistance and the result would "quickly bankrupt"
the state system.
In other action, the court cleared the way for the
transfer of Cuban and Haitian refugees from Flori
da to Puerto Rico. The Carter administration wants
to transfer as many as 2 000 refugees to Fort Allen in
Puerto Rico and close down a Florida camp.
The justices also rejected Rep. Michael
Myers'iD -Pa.) challenge to the grand jury indict
ment in the FBl's "Abscam" investigation that led
to his bribery conviction and expulsion from Con
gress.
The court also agreed to decide when broad
casters have the right to refuse to sell airtime to
candidates for federal political offices. The issue
arose when the three networks refused to sell the
Carter-Mondale campaign committee time in De
cember 1979 on the grounds that the campaign had
not yet begun
Chemical escapes in SF fire
San Francisco — Firemen hacked away at a fog
wrapped city pier yesterday to reach a four-alarm
blaze that gutted a power station and triggered the
escape of small amounts of a dangerous chemical.
Officials said PCB, a substance used in electrical
equipment which has been linked to cancer, vapor
ized in the intense heat, and officials were con
cerned firefighters might have inhaled the fumes
The chemical was contained inside electrical
transformers, whose gaskets opened in the fire.
Arson investigators said partying fishermen may
have ignited rotting timber in a fenced-off. unused
portion of Pier 70 along the western waterfront.
Some of the pilings had been treated with creosote, a
wood preservative that gives off a pungent odor,
said Fire Chief Andrew Casper.

Investigators said they couldn't say for sure how
the fire started until it was safe to scrutinize the
area
Atlanta child strangled
Atlanta — A 9-vear-old boy who was either
strangled or smothered has become the 11th black
child murdered in Atlanta in the last 16 months —
and the first since the city mounted an all-out cam
paign to find the killer, police said yesterday
Four other black children have disappeared dur
ing that time in a series of unsolved crimes that Pub
lic Safety Commissioner Lee Brown called "the
worst thing that has ever happened in Atlanta "
A pedestrian crossing a bridge over the South
River in southeast Atlanta on Sunday afternoon dis
covered the body of Aaron Jackson Jr. on the steep,
wooded riverbank about a mile from his home.
After the body of a ninth child was found in early
October, the city began to try to find the person or
persons responsible. Officers began going door-to
door in certain neighborhoods questioning residents,
and weekend crews of volunteers undertook
searches of areas where authorities thought the
missing children might be found
A 10th body — that of a girl abducted five months
earlier — was found during a weekend search.
S. Africa limits worker migration
Pretoria, South Africa — The South African gov
ernment has announced measures to lift some re
strictions on where several million black urban
dwellers may live and work and to pave the way for
self-governing black municipal authorities.
However, these measures are to be coupled with
other steps that will inhibit more severely the mi
gration of blacks from the rural, underdeveloped
tribal homelands, where there are few job op
portunities. Other restrictions will ensure that the
number of blacks having the right to live per
manently in urban areas is carefully controlled.
The full impact of the laws and their effect on the
lives of urban blacks cannot be determined until the
government releases details of two other bills that
will set guidelines for labor control and establish a
new kind of identity document for black urban
dwellers.

Russian warships off Thailand
Bangkok. Thailand — The Thai government yes
terday asked the Soviet embassy to explain the pres
ence of four Russian warships, including the heli
copter carrier Minsk, in the Gulf of Thailand

Thai and Western diplomats speculated that the
Soviet naval force was sending a message to Thai
land and. bv extension to the United States. Thai
land's ally
The Soviet ships made their appearance the day
after Thai Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda re
turned from a friendly visit to China. Moscow's rival
for power in the region
A Thai foreign ministry spokesman said the Sovi
et ambassador was not summoned to hear a protest
but to present an explanation There was no ground
for protest because the Soviet ships were in interna
tional waters more than 50 miles off the Thai coast
when spotted Saturday by a Thai fishing boat
State death penalty upheld
Washington — The Supreme Court yesterday set
aside a ruling that had blocked California prose
cutors from seeking thedeath penalty in "especially
heinous, atrocious or cruel" murder cases.
By a 6-3 vote, the justices told the California
courts to restudy decisions striking down that por
tion of the state's capital punishment law as un
constitutionally vague
The Supreme Court also agreed to decide whether
individuals can dispose of their assets for less than
fair value and still qualify for certain types of Medi
caid
The appeal was filed on behalf of senior citizens
denied assistance for the medically needy under
California's Medi-Cal program because they trans
ferred assets for less than fair value
The state of California claims that if its rule were
overturned "any person could qualify" for as
sistance and the result would "quickly bankrupt"
the state system.
In other action, the court cleared the way for the
transfer of Cuban and Haitian refugees from Flori
da to Puerto Rico. The Carter administration wants
to transfer as many as 2 000 refugees to Fort Allen in
Puerto Rico and close down a Florida camp.
The justices also rejected Rep. Michael
Myers'iD -Pa.) challenge to the grand jury indict
ment in the FBl's "Abscam" investigation that led
to his bribery conviction and expulsion from Con
gress.
The court also agreed to decide when broad
casters have the right to refuse to sell airtime to
candidates for federal political offices. The issue
arose when the three networks refused to sell the
Carter-Mondale campaign committee time in De
cember 1979 on the grounds that the campaign had

Chemical escapes in SF fire
San Francisco — Firemen hacked away at a fog
wrapped city pier yesterday to reach a four-alarm
blaze that gutted a power station and triggered the
escape of small amounts of a dangerous chemical.
Officials said PCB, a substance used in electrical
equipment which has been linked to cancer, vapor
ized in the intense heat, and officials were con
cerned firefighters might have inhaled the fumes
The chemical was contained inside electrical
transformers, whose gaskets opened in the fire.
Arson investigators said partying fishermen may
have ignited rotting timber in a fenced-off. unused
portion of Pier 70 along the western waterfront.
Some of the pilings had been treated with creosote, a
wood preservative that gives off a pungent odor,
said Fire Chief Andrew Casper.

Investigators said they couldn't say for sure how
the fire started until it was safe to scrutinize the
area
Atlanta child strangled
Atlanta — A 9-vear-old boy who was either
strangled or smothered has become the 11th black
child murdered in Atlanta in the last 16 months —
and the first since the city mounted an all-out cam
paign to find the killer, police said yesterday
Four other black children have disappeared dur
ing that time in a series of unsolved crimes that Pub
lic Safety Commissioner Lee Brown called "the
worst thing that has ever happened in Atlanta "
A pedestrian crossing a bridge over the South
River in southeast Atlanta on Sunday afternoon dis
covered the body of Aaron Jackson Jr. on the steep,
wooded riverbank about a mile from his home.
After the body of a ninth child was found in early
October, the city began to try to find the person or
persons responsible. Officers began going door-to
door in certain neighborhoods questioning residents,
and weekend crews of volunteers undertook
searches of areas where authorities thought the
missing children might be found
A 10th body — that of a girl abducted five months
earlier — was found during a weekend search.
S. Africa limits worker migration
Pretoria, South Africa — The South African gov

self-governing black municipal authorities.
However, these measures are to be coupled with
other steps that will inhibit more severely the mi
gration of blacks from the rural, underdeveloped
tribal homelands, where there are few job op
portunities. Other restrictions will ensure that the
number of blacks having the right to live per
manently in urban areas is carefully controlled.
The full impact of the laws and their effect on the
lives of urban blacks cannot be determined until the
government releases details of two other bills that
will set guidelines for labor control and establish a
new kind of identity document for black urban

wrapped city pier yesterday to reach a four-alarm
blaze that gutted a power station and triggered the
escape of small amounts of a dangerous chemical.

the fire started until it was safe to scrutinize the
area

S. Africa limits worker migration
Pretoria, South Africa — The South African gov
ernment has announced measures to lift some re
strictions on where several million black urban
dwellers may live and work and to pave the way for
self-governing black municipal authorities.
However, these measures are to be coupled with
other steps that will inhibit more severely the mi
gration of blacks from the rural, underdeveloped
tribal homelands, where there are few job op
portunities. Other restrictions will ensure that the
number of blacks having the right to live per
manently in urban areas is carefully controlled.
The full impact of the laws and their effect on the
lives of urban blacks cannot be determined until the
government releases details of two other bills that
will set guidelines for labor control and establish a
new kind of identity document for black urban
dwellers.
