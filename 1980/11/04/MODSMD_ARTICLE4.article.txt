### Victor Goetz 
Some 200 students who registered to
vote during the ASSU's get-out-the
vote drive did not receive any con
firmation of their registration until
last night because the group coordi
nating the effort. Frontlash. mis
placed a stack of completed regis
tration forms
The students registered with volun
teers at Maples Pavilion Sept. 29 and
30. according to ASSU Council of Pres
idents member Dick Butterfield. and
their forms were turned over to
Frontlash. a non-profit, non-partisan
gi nip which aims at registering young
voters.
Frontlash was supposed to submit
tin forms to the Santa Clara County
registrar of voters by Oct. 6. Yet ac
cording to Andrew Goldenkranz of
Frontlash, one stack of cards from
S infnrd and Santa Clara Valley Medi
( al Center in San Jose was mistakenly
placed in a box of blank forms and not
found until Oct. 31.
It took an injunction from Santa
Clara Superior Court Judge Bruce Al
len yesterday morning to allow the
students to vote today.
Representatives of the ASSU,
Frontlash. and the local Democratic
and Republican parties combined
forces last night in an effort to inform
the affected students, who had no idea
what had happened to their regis

tration and believed they would not be
able to vote today
"It's really kind of strange. I usual
ly vote It really unusually bothered
me when I found out I wasn't going to
be able to vote. I was quite angry
said Terry Vance, one of the students.
"If I were doing something similar I
think I would ask for the card myself
to send in." he continued "I'd take a
little more active hand in it myself. I
won't trust these groups anymore "
The new-found voters have been as
signed to their normal precincts, said
Goldenkranz Each precinct will have
a list of the added names on hand for
the election today
Goldenkranz urged any students in
doubt about their registration status
to call the Santa Clara county regis
trar of voters at < 408 > 299-2161 or to
check the list at the precinct to which
others living at the same location
were assigned
The ASSU registration drive
brought in 3500 voters, according to
Butterfield, who called the effort
"highly successful" despite the foul
up.
The mistake was detected when he
and some Frontlash workers noticed
reports in the San -Just Mercury and
on local television news broadcasts of
people who had registered but had not
received sample ballots or any other
confirmation, said Goldenkranz.

\t the same time Butterfield tried
tn trace down what had happened to 12
people who called the ASSI' office to
inquire why thev had not received pre
election materials
(ioldenkranz said he found the miss
ing cards when Krontlash began an in
vestigation Friday and immediately
submitted the names to the voter reg
istrar
The students were alerted by phone
or bv personal visits from volunteers,
said Butterfield
