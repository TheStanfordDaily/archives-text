r rorn the Daily wire services
Iranian militants relinquished "re
sponsibility" for their 52 American
captives to the Iranian government
yesterday, a move U.S. officials
called a major breakthrough toward
their eventual release. Iran also desig
nated Algeria to talk with the United
States on conditions for the release.
The transfer of jurisdiction over the
52 Americans was approved by Ira
nian spiritual leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeiti. bplieved to be the
onh single authoritative voice in the
matter
\ftor the Islamic militants stormed
the r S Embassy in Tehran and took
the Americans hostage last Nov. 4. the
Iranian government appeared to con
cede them a measure of power over
the fate of the captives. Statements
from the militants often drowned out
the voices of moderates in the govern
ment. and the split in authority ap
peared to dim prospects for a nego
tiated settlement.
Terms for the release were de
livered to the United States via the Al
itor ian Embassy in Tehran yesterday.
unit ui the conditions would be hard
to meet, immediately. U S. officials
have said In Washington. U.S. Secre
tary of State Edmund Muskie said en
ding the hostages' year-long captivity
"will require time, patience and
diplomacy "
The conditions, set by Khomeini in
September and adopted by the Iranian
Parliament, or Majlis, on Sunday, are
a U.S. government pledge not to in
terfere in Iran's affairs, to release all
Iranian assets frozen by the United
States, to cancel all Amer can legal
actions against Iran and tc return to
Iran all the assets of the ate Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlav and his
close relatives
Earlier yesterday the mil tants met
with Khomeini and issued a tatement
which said in part: "We will rom now
on delegate responsibility for the
(hostages') safeguarding to the gov
ernment and will engage in the most
important current issue of tf e revolu
tion defense of the Islam 1 home
land."'
A spokesman for the Iranian prime
minister said the government auto
matically assumed responsibility af
ter Sunday's decision by the Par
liament to set release terms. "The
students' (militants) statement for
the transfer of custody of the hostages
was just for emphasis." he said.
In Washington. White House press
secretary Jodv Powell said the
transfer "is something we have seen
since the very outset as being an im
portant step toward their eventual re
lease."
Presidential aide Jack Watson, on
ABC-TV's "Good Morning. America"
program, called the transfer "a very
positive development." Asked if it
was a major breakthrough. Watson re
plied. "Indeed it is."
President Jimmy Carter, in Akron.
Ohio, refused to comment. Asked if he
was encouraged by the reports, he
said "Don't know yet."
It was unclear whether the transfer
of responsibility also meant a transfer
ot custody. The militants' statement,
on Tehran Radio, had asked the gov
ernment to "introduce your repre
sentative for delivery of the American
spies" and allow the militants to join
in the war against Iraq. Officials in
Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Ra
jai's office said a transfer of custody
would be discussed late yesterday.
But a spokesman for Rajai later
said no such discussion was planned
and the militants "can keep guarding
the hostages until the day they are re
leased, if the conditions are met."
The official English-language text
of the conditions were given yesterday
to the Algerian Embassy for delivery
to the U.S. government.
The United States will have no trou
ble meeting the demand for a pledgeof
non-interference in Iranian affairs, a
pledge Carter has made repeatedly.
But years of judicial actions in the
U.S. courts would probably be re
quired to meet the other conditions.
The Majlis has said it would release
the hostages in groups as each condi
tion is met. The United States insists

all the hostages be released at the
same time
The exact whereabouts of the cap
tives is not known Iran claimed it dis
persed them around the country after
the aborted U S. rescue effort in April.
Recent reports, however, said most of
the hostages have been returned to the
embassy. The militants announced
plans for a mass anti-American rally
outside the embassy to mark the Nov.
4 anniversary of the takeover.
Prime Minister Rajai. meanwhile,
met in the morning with the am
bassadors of Switzerland and West
Germany Swiss Ambassador Eric
Lang delivered a message from
Carter
A spokesman for Rajai confirmed
the message had been received but re
fused to elaborate on its contents.
Later, the prime minister met with
the Algerian ambassador They
agreed Algeria would represent Iran
in the hostage negotiations. Iranian of
ficials said they had no plans to in
volve the United Nations in the talks
