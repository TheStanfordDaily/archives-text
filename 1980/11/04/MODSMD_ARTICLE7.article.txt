## U.S. companies fined Nigeria to reform oil production 
### Washington Post 
Lagos, Nigeria — Nigeria's
determination to keep its oil
prices high despite a current
worldwide petroleum surplus
forced the country to cut back
its production sharply last
month and may reduce its oil
revenue by $1 billion this year.
Although Nigeria depends on
oil sales for 85 percent of its na
tional revenues. President
Shehu Shagari said last week
that the country remained com
mitted to the high pricing policy
of the Organization of Petrole
um Exporting Countries regard
less of market pressures.
Shagari, speaking at the open
ing of Nigeria's new $800 million
Kaduna Refinery, also said that
the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corp., the government-run
agency that markets the coun
try's oil. would be reorganized
to provide greater "profit
motivation."
The world oil glut, which saw
many users desert high-priced
producers and buy instead on
the less expensive spot market
or simply postpone purchases,
forced Nigeria to reduce its
production from the normal 2.2
million barrels a day to 1.5 mil
lion.
In October, with the Iranian-
Iraqi war lowering world prod
uction, Nigeria raised output to
1.9 million barrels a day. and oil
industry sources say that this
month it expects to resume full
production.
The September slump, none
theless, cost Nigeria an esti
mated $450 million, and one of
ficial said that the projected oil
earnings for this year have been
reduced from $23 billion to $22
billion.

Nigeria was especially hard
hit by the world oil surplus be
cause. like most Third World
countries, it is short of highly
skilled experts, needed here to
operate its oil marketing opera
tion.
"If there had been no Iranian-
Iraqi war." a knowledgeable oil
industry source said, "Nigeria
would have been stuck at 1.5
million barrels of oil a day for
some time," a production slump
that would have cost the country
$15 million a day and had a con
siderable impact on the econo
my.
The recent slump was the re
sult of a surplus, before the Per
sian Gulf war began, of 1.5 mil
lion barrels a day in world prod
uction above the 50 million bar
rels-a-day consumption in in
dustrialized countries. In Au
gust and September, light
crude, low-sulfur oil of the kind
that Nigeria sells at $37 a barrel,
was selling on the spot market
at $32, although "it since has
risen to about $37.
Nigeria stubbornly adhered
to the OPEC-agreed price of $37
a barrel for its top-quality crude
although, as one industry source
said, "the first crudes not to be

bought in such a situation are
light crudes."
The United States, which
buys about a million barrels of
Nigeria's daily production, and
the country's other Western
clients continued to buy their
contractual amounts during the
glut. Diplomatic and oil in
dustry sources said, however,
that Eastern European coun
tries and third-party contract
holders went to the spot market
for the cheaper oil.
In his speech, Shagari said
that the Nigeria National Petro
leum Corp. will be decen
tralized because "its present
structure is so unwieldly as to
render effective management
virtually impossible." He
added, "It is our intention to
restructure the NNPC under the
umbrella of a holding company
operating as a modern business
enterprise with profit motiva
tion."
Since the Persian Gulf war
broke out, Nigeria's customers
have begun to return.
"We're still not doing too bad
ly." a Nigerian official added,
referring to the new projected
oil earnings figure of $22 billion
for this vear. "That is still three

times what we earned two years
ago."
In a related development, oil
industry sources said that con
trary to earlier reports that Ni
geria was fining three oil com
panies here — Shell. Gulf and
Mobil — $6 billion for revenue
lost in a similar production drop
between 1975 and 1978, the ac
tual amount will be $64 million
or less.
The flap over the fining of the
three companies grew out of an
investigation into reports since
proven false that $5 billion was
missing from the Nigerian mar
keting corporation's accounts.
But the tribunal investigating
the charges found that the coun
try had lost millions of dollars in
revenue because pricing had led
to a drop in sales at different
times between 1975 and 1978.
The 10 oil companies operat
ing here produce all of Nigeria's
oil and have the right to
purchase percentages of their
production.
With a government-set profit
margin of 80 cents a barrel, this
could mean a $64 million loss to
the three companies in 1980
dollars.
