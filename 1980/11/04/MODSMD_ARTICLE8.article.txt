# Gang of Four trial delayed again
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing â€” The trial of Jiang Qing. the
widow of Chairman Mao Zedong, and other
radical leaders of China's Cultural Revolu
tion appears to have been delayed further
because of her adamant refusal to admit
any guilt.
The trial was to have opened next Mon
day. Nov. 10, but highly placed Chinese
sources said Saturday that it would have to
be delayed again because of Jiang's refusal
to cooperate with the prosecution
Jiang continues to proclaim her in
nocence of all the charges and to insist that
whatever she did during the Cultural Revo
lution of the late 1960s and ensuing years of
radical dominance was done under Mao's
instructions, the sources added.
The general charges against her and oth
er members of the "Gang of Four," who
were arrested after Mao's death in 1976. in
clude sedition, false prosecution of govern
ment and Communist Party officials in or
der to seize power, and establishing a
"fascist dictatorship." The specific
charges contained in the formal indictment
have not been officially disclosed.
No plea bargaining
Jiang is insisting upon a full defense, in
cluding testimony from members of the

present leadership, according to informed
sources here, and she said again last week
she would not bargain an admission of guilt
for leniency.
This makes it impossible to carry out the
trial's original plan of keeping the charges,
testimony and defense within politically ac
ceptable bounds, and some senior Chinese
officials now are talking about an indefinite
postponement while these problems are re
solved.
Jiang's tactics, moreover, may have
brought the present leadership's tenuous
compromise on the trial to the point of col
lapse This compromise is basic to the rela
tionship between those who gained power
during the Cultural Revolution and those
who were purged; if it fails, it will affect
much more than the trial
Power struggle
Hua Guofeng, the Communist Party
chairman, is increasingly the target of
pointed suggestions that leaders who have
lost the confidence of the people should step
aside, and many Chinese and foreign ob
servers believe that Hua now is locked in a
final power struggle with Vice Chairman
Deng Xiaoping, China's dominant political
figure, who is trying to reshape the entire
leadership before the party congress sched

uled for early next spring,
Political moves
The party's Central Committee, in a polit
ically significant move last week, post
humously expelled Kang Sheng, a party vice
chairman and longtime security chief who
was the adviser to the Central Cultural Rev
olution Group, and Xie Fuzhi, a vice pre
mier and the public security minister
through the first half of the Cultural Revolu
tion.
The move further undercut Hua, how
ever, for he was originally Kang's protege
and succeeded Xie as public security min
ister, a job he held until after he had become
acting premier in 1976.
The trial has remained a major point of
contention between the two men and their
supporters even after Hua accepted it a
year ago. Deng wants a full trial that will
discredit not just the Cultural Revolution
and those who led it, but also most of the
basic tenets of Maoism, according to in
formed Chinese sources; Hua has wanted
only a carefully circumscribed trial that
would leave the judgment of Mao and his
policies to history and not threaten the posi
tions of men like himself who rose to power
during the radical years.
