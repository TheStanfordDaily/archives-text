# Reflection of growing anti-semitism-
## Holocaust's existence denied 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — In the somber Hall of Names at
Yad Vashem, Israel's memorial to the victims
of the Holocaust, are the names of nearly 3 mil
lion Jews who died in the Nazi death camps of
the 1930s and '40s.
The names are on forms filled out by friends
and relatives of those who died, forms that also
contain dates of birth and death, names of rela
tives and other pertinent data. The file is im
precise and. despite its size, still incomplete.
"Between January and September we got an
additional 11,000 names," Benyamin Armon,
curator of Hall of Names, said. "I have no
doubt that the total number who died comes to
more than 6 million."
Yet in the library at Yad Vashem, there are
about 100 books and pamphlets from around
the world that deny, in seven languages, that
the Holocaust ever took place.
The Yad Vashem, which is a museum, a
shrine and a research facility, finds itself in
the position of fighting a widespread denial of
history. As one official put it:
"It is as if Americans were forced to prove
there was a Pearl Harbor."
Anti-semitic resurgence
These books and pamphlets, and the groups
that publish them, are being taken more seri
ously. They are regarded as a symptom of
what serious thinkers here refer to as "the new
anti-Semitism," a resurgence of violent anti-
Semitism that attacks not just Jews but also
their homeland, Israel.
Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are being
mixed together, said Gideon Hausner, the
prosecutor of Nazi Adolf Eichmann and now
head of the Yad Vashem Council.
Denials underscored
Mark Fredriksen, a French neo-Nazi, has
denied that Adolf Hitler's Germany de
liberately planned to kill Jews, saying that far

fewer than 6 million died during the war.
"Those who had died had simply been vic
tims of wartime food shortages and concentra
tion camp diseases, Fredriksen said on BBC
television's 'Panorama' program Monday
night.
Fredriksen's theories are echoed in the
shelves of books and pamphlets in a filing cabi
net in the back room of the Yad Vashem li
brary. In Did Six Million Really Die?, pub
lished by the Christian Vanguard of the New
Christian Crusade Church in Los Angeles, the
author is Richard Harwood.
Alternative explanation
Harwood's book ana others explain away the
Holocaust as follows:
The Jews from Europe actually emigrated,
"the greatest part of them" illegally to the
United States; the photographs of the dead
were faked, or showed the bodies of Germans
killed by Allied bombing; Hitler would not
have been so stupid as to kill workers needed
for his war industries.
Dr. Erich Kulka, the author of 11 books on
the Holocaust, showed a visitor to his Jerusa
lem apartment an advertisement placed by
representatives of something called the In
stitute for Historical Review, meeting at In
glewood, Calif., and offering $50,000 "to any
one who can prove that the Nazis operated gas
chambers to kill Jews."
Abominable
Hausner, 65, and one of Israel's most re
spected lawyers, found himself groping for
words.
"It is something — libelous is not strong
enough — something so, so abominable that we
must meet this challenge," he went on. "We
must get to the best part of people all over the
world. The Holocaust was not just a Jewish
problem, but a Christian problem, too, a
bankruptcy of Christianity."
