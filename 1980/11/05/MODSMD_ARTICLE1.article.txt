# Reagan beats Carter in landslide
## Former governor takes 475 electors in worst rout of incumbent president in half a century 
### 
H'. The Los Angeles Times
Republican Ronald Reagan was
elected the nation's 40th president
■ esterday in a stunning landslide over
1 resident .Jimmy Carter, sweeping
every region of the country and cut
ting deeply into voting blocs that sup
ported Carter in 1976.
Carter conceded defeat at 9:53 p.m.
i EST> — more than an hour before the
polls closed in Western states. Choked
with emotion, the Democratic incum
bent called on his supporters to unify
behind President-elect Reagan "to
solve the problems still before us."
An hour earlier. Carter had called
Reagan to congratulate him on his vic
tory. just as Reagan was leaving his
Los Angeles home to go to dinner.
With near-final returns tabulated
from all regions except the West,
where Reagan was winning big. the
GOP candidate led in 43 states with 475
electoral votes — 205 more than the
270 electoral votes needed for victory.
Carter was leading in only seven
states and the District of Columbia
with 63 electoral votes.
In the popular vote, with 96 percent
of the nation's precincts reporting.
Reagan had received 41.185,667 votes,
or 51 percent. Carter's tally totaled
33.261.944, or 41 percent of the vote.
Poor Anderson showing
Rep John Anderson (R-Ill.), run
ning as an independent, carried no
states. He fared so poorly in the popu
lar vote and Reagan piled up such a
huge margin in most states that An
derson was not a factor in the out
come. The 6:30 a.m. EST returns
showed the congressman with a mere
5.309.295 votes, representing 7percent
of the v.jtes cast.
Reagan, beaming, but striking a se
rious tone, later told a cheering throng
of supporters at the Century Plaza Ho
tel in Los Angeles that he had never
had "a more humbling moment in my

life "
With his wife Nancy looking on. the
former California governor said "I
consider the trust you have given me
sacred and I give you my oath I will do
the utmost to justify your faith. '*
Tight race predicted
Until the final weekend of the cam
paign. polls had reflected a tight race
for the presidency. But Carter's han
dling of the Iranian hostage situation
and his performance in the televised
debate with Reagan one week before
Election Day apparently turned off
large numbers of undecided voters. An
ABC News survey of voters as they
left the polling booths showed that
these two factors more than anv oth

ers accounted for people siding
against Carter
Reagan, appearing at his Los Angel
es victory rally, said that Carter had
been "most gracious" in their phone
conversation and had pledged "the ut
most in cooperation in the transition
that will take place in these coming
months."
Moving quickly to arrange for an or
derly transfer of power from Carter,
the Reagan campaign staff said that it
plans to open a transition office in
Washington tomorrow. The office, un
der the direction of Edwin Meese. Re
agan's chief of staff, will set
priorities, work on a federal budget
