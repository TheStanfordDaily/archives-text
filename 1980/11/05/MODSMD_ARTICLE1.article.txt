# Reagan beats Carter in landslide
## Former governor takes 475 electors in worst rout of incumbent president in half a century 
### 
H'. The Los Angeles Times
Republican Ronald Reagan was
elected the nation's 40th president
■ esterday in a stunning landslide over
1 resident .Jimmy Carter, sweeping
every region of the country and cut
ting deeply into voting blocs that sup
ported Carter in 1976.
Carter conceded defeat at 9:53 p.m.
i EST> — more than an hour before the
polls closed in Western states. Choked
with emotion, the Democratic incum
bent called on his supporters to unify
behind President-elect Reagan "to
solve the problems still before us."
An hour earlier. Carter had called
Reagan to congratulate him on his vic
tory. just as Reagan was leaving his
Los Angeles home to go to dinner.
With near-final returns tabulated
from all regions except the West,
where Reagan was winning big. the
GOP candidate led in 43 states with 475
electoral votes — 205 more than the
270 electoral votes needed for victory.
Carter was leading in only seven
states and the District of Columbia
with 63 electoral votes.
In the popular vote, with 96 percent
of the nation's precincts reporting.
Reagan had received 41.185,667 votes,
or 51 percent. Carter's tally totaled
33.261.944, or 41 percent of the vote.
Poor Anderson showing
Rep John Anderson (R-Ill.), run
ning as an independent, carried no
states. He fared so poorly in the popu
lar vote and Reagan piled up such a
huge margin in most states that An
derson was not a factor in the out
come. The 6:30 a.m. EST returns
showed the congressman with a mere
5.309.295 votes, representing 7percent
of the v.jtes cast.
Reagan, beaming, but striking a se
rious tone, later told a cheering throng
of supporters at the Century Plaza Ho
tel in Los Angeles that he had never
had "a more humbling moment in my

life "
With his wife Nancy looking on. the
former California governor said "I
consider the trust you have given me
sacred and I give you my oath I will do
the utmost to justify your faith. '*
Tight race predicted
Until the final weekend of the cam
paign. polls had reflected a tight race
for the presidency. But Carter's han
dling of the Iranian hostage situation
and his performance in the televised
debate with Reagan one week before
Election Day apparently turned off
large numbers of undecided voters. An
ABC News survey of voters as they
left the polling booths showed that
these two factors more than anv oth

ers accounted for people siding
against Carter
Reagan, appearing at his Los Angel
es victory rally, said that Carter had
been "most gracious" in their phone
conversation and had pledged "the ut
most in cooperation in the transition
that will take place in these coming
months."
Moving quickly to arrange for an or
derly transfer of power from Carter,
the Reagan campaign staff said that it
plans to open a transition office in
Washington tomorrow. The office, un
der the direction of Edwin Meese. Re
agan's chief of staff, will set
priorities, work on a federal budget

Early projections
Long before the polls closed in his
home state of California. Reagan was
projected as the winner in enough
crucial states to assure his election
One network projected him as the win
ner at 8:45 p.m. (ESTi.
A philosophical conservative who
served two terms as California's gov
ernor from 1967-74. Reagan first began
seeking the presidency in 1968 — only
two years after being elected gov
ernor in a landslide. He was defeated
for the Republican nomination in 1968
and again in 1976, but won it handily
this year in a series of primary vic
tories over several Republican can
didates, including former U.N. Am
bassador George Bush, the man he

selected as his running mate and now
the vice president-elect
Reagan is the first actor and first
divorced person, as well as the oldest
man. ever to be elected president Me
will turn 70 on Feb 6. about three
weeks after his inauguration
He also is the first native of Illinois,
as well as the third Californian to be
elected president The other Californi
ans also were Republicans — Herbert
Hoover and Richard Nixon
Carter, a former Georgia governor,
became the first elected president to
fail to win re-election since Hoover
was defeated by Franklin Roosevelt in
1932 at the height of the Great Depres
sion
Aggressive campaign
Reagan ran an aggressive cam
paign against Carter, the first Demo
cratic president to run for re-election
during a recession, and attacked him
as an incompetent whose economic
policies had failed
Reagan accused the president of
plunging the nation into the recession,
which many observers believe ended
shortly before the election, and of fail
ing to halt a spiraling inflation rate
Carter was hurt, according to sur
veys of voters as they left the polling
booths, by the inflation rate, his han
dling of foreign affairs, the Iranian
hostage situation, the perception that
the nation's defenses had de
teriorated. and his campaign tactics
personally attacking Reagan
In view of polls just before the elec
tion. nearly all of which showed Re
agan and Carter only two or three per
centage points apart, the size of Re
agan's victory margin was particular
ly stunning.
Worse than 1976
Even in states that Carter carried,
he did not do as well as he did in 1976
against Ford. In Carter's home state
of Georgia, for example, with most of
the ballots tabulated. Carter was win
ning 59 percent, compared to the 67
percent vote he got in 1976.
In his 1976 victory over Ford. Carter
carried 10 of the 11 states of the old

Confederacy, but late returns last
night showed him winning four at the
most.
Disenchantment with Carter, more
than love for Reagan apparently ac
counted for Reagan's margin of vic
tory Polls showed that only about
two-thirds of the people who said they
voted for Carter four vears ago said
they also voted for him yesterday.
Reagan fared as well as Carter
among union members, a traditionally
Democratic group and did better than
the president among another tradi
tionally Democratic group Roman
Catholics
Born-again Christians." a group
that supported Carter in 1976. favored
Reagan this time
Women split
Women, presumably because of the
war and peace issue and Reagan's op
position to the Kqual Rights Amend
ment. split about evenly between the
two candidates
The only voting groups that Carter
managed to hold on to were the minor
ities — blacks. Hispanics and .Jews
And an ABC News poll showed Reagan
and Anderson cutting deeply into the
Jewish vote For the first time since
the 19305, the Democratic presidential
candidate appeared to be winning less
than a majority among Jewish voters.
Polls showed that voters who did
support Carter generally cited as their
reasons for doing so his stand on war
and peace and his concern for the
elderly, the poor, minorities and equal
rights for women
Inflation, leadership, an ability to
"get the job done'' and the need for a
change were reasons most often cited
by voters for supporting Reagan
Hostage developments
Patrick Caddell. Carter's pollster,
said he was convinced that the week
end developments in the Iranian
hostage situation had badly damaged
Carter's chances of re-election
Caddell said he had taken six na
tionwide surveys of voter opinions
since Friday and up until Sunday the
polls showed a neck and neck race.
But as soon as the Iranian Par
liament endorsed the Avatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's four demands
for the release of the 52 hostages, Cad
dell said. Carter's support began to
slip dramatically. Bv Sunday. Carter
had slipped five points behind and by
election eve he was 10 points back and
"it just kept on hemorrhaging." Cad
dell said.
The hostage situation. Caddell said,
was not critical by itself, but was "a
catalyst for the public's general frus
tration" with the way things were
going in the country.
Debate
The debate also was a powerful fac
tor. Even though many political ob
servers thought that Carter had won it
on substance, polls showed that the
public believed that Reagan had won
and this perception gave his campaign
a shot of adrenalin at just the time it
showed signs of losing momentum.
Carter's cold and aloof manner and
his slashing attack on Reagan during
the debate backfired. And even before
the debate, the president already had
tarnished his most valued political im
age. that of a good and decent man,
with attacks portraying Reagan as a
racist and a warmonger.
The president faced an uphill battle
for re-election from the moment he
won the hotly contested Democratic
nomination from Sen. Edward Ken
nedy i D-Mass.), after several bitterly
fought primaries and a battle at the
Democratic National Convention in
August.
In Reagan. Carter faced a candidate
who had not only a solid base in the
West but enormous popular appeal in
the traditiona 11 v conservative South.
