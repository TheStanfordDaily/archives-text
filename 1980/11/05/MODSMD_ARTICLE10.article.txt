Political newcomer Becky Morgan defeated her Demo
cratic challenger Jim Jackson in the race for Santa Clara
County's sth District supervisorial seat.
Early this morning, Morgan had about 60 percent of the
votes cast.
"I'm pleased." Morgan told the Daily in a telephone in
terview last evening. "It's certainly satisfying to win, es
pecially after the hard w:>rk put in by people on my team."
She also praised what she called a "high quality" cam
paign run by herself and her opponent, who could not be
reached for comment "Mr. Jackson and I carried on a
very forward, honest campaigns, without the bad liter
ature and campaign tactics used by candidates in other lo
cal races."
Morgan defeated a man who won the endorsement of
every mayor in the county and whose political experience
was considerable. An attorney, Jackson served eight
years on'the Cupertino city council (one term as mayor).
Morgan served five years on the Palo Alto Unified
School District, and has no public record on zoning, hous
ing or transportation issues She reiterated her primary
policy aim: public safety. "I want to stress — among oth
er things — a high quality sheriff's office," she said, add
ing that she is "extremely" concerned about overcrowd
ing in jails
The two candidates differed sharply on county ballot
measures

Unlike her opponent, Morgan did not take a stand on
Measure B. which would allow the supervisors to engage
in binding arbitration with sheriff's deputies and fire
fighters, preferring to leave it up to the voters. But during
the campaign. Morgan said B would relinquish control
over negotiations to a third person, who might not fully un
derstand the county's fiscal problems. Jackson favored
the measure.
Early this morning. Measure B seemed headed for de
feat.
Morgan also opposed Measure A in contrast with Jack
son's support This measure would make the county Public
Defender an appointee of the supervisors rather than an
appointee of the county executive. Such a change, she said
during the campaign, would politicize the office. Early
this morning. Measure A had a narrow margin of support.
Morgan recently earned a MBA from Stanford's Gradu
ate School of Business. She has worked briefly for Bank of
America as an assistant vice president of its Sunnyvale
branch.
Because of these close ties with business, it has been
feared that Morgan would be biased against environmen
talists' concerns. Morgan sought to allay such fears in her
comments last night. "I want to preserve green space and
clean air just as much as anyone else. In fact, when I was
on the Palo Alto Board of Education, I led the fight to pre
serve the green space of school property in the Los Altos
foothills," she said.
