# Demos retain thin majority in House
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — By only a thin
margin, Democrats retained control
of the House of Representatives yes
terday. But their ranks were badly
depleted as Republicans, propelled by
Ronald Reagan's landslide victory,
piled up substantial congressional
gains.
Democrats had won the 218 seats re
quired for control of the House and
were leading in races that would give
them 241 of the 435 seats. Republicans
were threatening to pick up 34 seats.
House majority whip John Brad
emas (D-Ind), third-ranking member
of the House Democratic leadership
and a House member for 22 years, was
beaten yesterday as Republicans
mounted their heaviest effort in more
than a decade to win House seats.
Brademas lost to John Hiler, a con
servative 27-year-old businessman.
The South Bend representative had
usually won in close races. This time
unemployment, a growing disenchant
ment with government, and perhaps a
tendency to blame leaders more than
other elected officials for the nation's
problems caught up with him. Demo
cratic campaign officials had carried
him at the top of their endangered list
for some time.
Bribery charges
Another veteran House Democrat,
Rep. Frank Thompson who has repre
sented Trenton for 26 years, was trail
ing but for other reasons. Thompson
has been indicted on bribery charges
in the Abscam case, but had been giv
en a chance to win because he has not
yet been tried. With slightly less than
half the vote counted, Thompson was
behind about 3 to 2.
In New Jersey, liberal Democrat
Andrew Maguire who won a tradi
tionally Republican district around
Ridgewood after the Watergate scan
dal in 1974 and has won closely twice
since, was defeated by Marge
Roukema, a former school board
member.
Democrats were in danger of losing
three of their four remaining seats in
Virginia. Liberal Democrat Joseph
Fisher lost in Arlingtopn to Frank
Wolf and the other liberal northern
Virginian Democrat, Herbert Harris,

was trailing Republican Stanford
Parris whom Harris ousted after one
term in 1974. Democrats lost the Rich
mond seat as expected after the re
tirement of conservative Democrat
David Satterfield.
Democrats were also trailing in the
Omaha district of Nebraska which
John Cavanaugh gave up after two
terms to spend more time with his
family.
Democratic control
Republicans needed to pick up 59
seats to win control of the House which
Democrats have dominated for a
quarter century. As election day
opened, Republicans were generally
expected to win about 20 seats. Ronald
Reagan's decisive win of the presiden
cy could push that figure slightly
higher, but it was not expected to give
them control.
Most observers expected a GOP
gain of about 20 seats, with most com
ing in the eastern part of the country.
That would leave Democrats with a
margin of 40 seats or so, comfortable
for some purposes but hardly a man
date to enact the traditional big spend
ing Democratic legislative programs
of the past. Even though Democratic
majorities have remained high since
the Watergate-dominated election of
1974, the House has become increas
ingly conservative as party discipline
deteriorated, inflation made the na
tion more conservative and powerful
single-issue lobbies made members
more hesitant to act boldly.
There will be at least two additions
to the 14-member all-Democratic
Black Caucus in the House. The solidly
Democratic Chicago district from
which Morgan Murphy retired nomi
nated a black — Chicago's third — to
replace him while, in Los Angeles,
Mervyn Dymally, former lieutenant
governor, was also considered a shoo
in.
More women
An increase in the group of 16 wom
en now serving in the House aiso was
predicted. Fifty-one are running as
major party candidates and several
challengers are given good chances to
win. One incumbent woman, Eliz
abeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.), left to run
for the Senate. But Republicans have a
sure replacement in the safe Illinois
district John Anderson gave up to run
for president.
Fifty-one candidates had no major
party opposition and could be pre
sumed elected before the polls opened
yesterday morning.
As usual, most members of the re
markable Democratic class of 1974
were under pressure in close races,
but most were expected to hang on as
they had in three previous elections.
Seventy-five Democrats, many of
them with no previous political ex
perience, were first elected in 1974 af
ter Watergate. Usually, after such a
landslide has wrenched many seats
away from the party that long held
them, the pendulum swings back in
the following election to return most
to their original party.
There were 43 open House seats to
be filled yesterday — ones where the
incumbent was not running. Demo
crats conceded three before the polls
opened, in Virginia, New York and
Missouri, believing only the retiring
incumbent's conservative or other
personal appeal could hold the seat in
the Democratic column. Most ob
servers were willing to concede two
open Republican seats to the Demo
crats, in North Dakota and California

Brademas lost to John Hiler, a con
servative 27-year-old businessman.
The South Bend representative had
usually won in close races. This time
unemployment, a growing disenchant
ment with government, and perhaps a
tendency to blame leaders more than
other elected officials for the nation's
problems caught up with him. Demo
cratic campaign officials had carried
him at the top of their endangered list
for some time.
Bribery charges
Another veteran House Democrat,
Rep. Frank Thompson who has repre
sented Trenton for 26 years, was trail
ing but for other reasons. Thompson
has been indicted on bribery charges
in the Abscam case, but had been giv
en a chance to win because he has not
yet been tried. With slightly less than
half the vote counted, Thompson was
behind about 3 to 2.
In New Jersey, liberal Democrat
Andrew Maguire who won a tradi
tionally Republican district around
Ridgewood after the Watergate scan
dal in 1974 and has won closely twice
since, was defeated by Marge
Roukema, a former school board
member.
Democrats were in danger of losing
three of their four remaining seats in
Virginia. Liberal Democrat Joseph
Fisher lost in Arlingtopn to Frank
Wolf and the other liberal northern
Virginian Democrat, Herbert Harris,

was trailing Republican Stanford
Parris whom Harris ousted after one
term in 1974. Democrats lost the Rich
mond seat as expected after the re
tirement of conservative Democrat
David Satterfield.
Democrats were also trailing in the
Omaha district of Nebraska which
John Cavanaugh gave up after two
terms to spend more time with his
family.
Democratic control
Republicans needed to pick up 59
seats to win control of the House which
Democrats have dominated for a
quarter century. As election day
opened, Republicans were generally
expected to win about 20 seats. Ronald
Reagan's decisive win of the presiden
cy could push that figure slightly
higher, but it was not expected to give
them control.
Most observers expected a GOP
gain of about 20 seats, with most com
ing in the eastern part of the country.
That would leave Democrats with a
margin of 40 seats or so, comfortable
for some purposes but hardly a man
date to enact the traditional big spend
ing Democratic legislative programs
of the past. Even though Democratic
majorities have remained high since
the Watergate-dominated election of
1974, the House has become increas
ingly conservative as party discipline
deteriorated, inflation made the na
tion more conservative and powerful
single-issue lobbies made members
more hesitant to act boldly.
There will be at least two additions
to the 14-member all-Democratic
Black Caucus in the House. The solidly
Democratic Chicago district from
which Morgan Murphy retired nomi
nated a black — Chicago's third — to
replace him while, in Los Angeles,
Mervyn Dymally, former lieutenant
governor, was also considered a shoo
in.
More women
An increase in the group of 16 wom
en now serving in the House aiso was
predicted. Fifty-one are running as
major party candidates and several
challengers are given good chances to
win. One incumbent woman, Eliz
abeth Holtzman (D-N.Y.), left to run
for the Senate. But Republicans have a
sure replacement in the safe Illinois
district John Anderson gave up to run
for president.
Fifty-one candidates had no major
party opposition and could be pre
sumed elected before the polls opened
yesterday morning.
As usual, most members of the re
markable Democratic class of 1974
were under pressure in close races,
but most were expected to hang on as
they had in three previous elections.
Seventy-five Democrats, many of
them with no previous political ex
perience, were first elected in 1974 af
ter Watergate. Usually, after such a
landslide has wrenched many seats
away from the party that long held
them, the pendulum swings back in
the following election to return most
to their original party.
There were 43 open House seats to
be filled yesterday — ones where the
incumbent was not running. Demo
crats conceded three before the polls
opened, in Virginia, New York and
Missouri, believing only the retiring
incumbent's conservative or other
personal appeal could hold the seat in
the Democratic column. Most ob
servers were willing to concede two
open Republican seats to the Demo
crats, in North Dakota and California
From the Daily wire services
Washington — By only a thin
margin, Democrats retained control
of the House of Representatives yes
terday. But their ranks were badly
depleted as Republicans, propelled by
Ronald Reagan's landslide victory,
piled up substantial congressional
gains.
Democrats had won the 218 seats re
quired for control of the House and
were leading in races that would give
them 241 of the 435 seats. Republicans
were threatening to pick up 34 seats.
House majority whip John Brad
emas (D-Ind), third-ranking member
of the House Democratic leadership
and a House member for 22 years, was
beaten yesterday as Republicans
mounted their heaviest effort in more
than a decade to win House seats.
