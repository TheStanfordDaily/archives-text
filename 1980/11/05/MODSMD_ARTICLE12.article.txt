# Cranston coasts to easy third-term Senate victory
## 
### Associated Press 
Los Angeles — U.S. Sen. Alan
Cranston survived an election blitz
that won control of the Senate for the
GOP, soundly defeating Republican
challenger Paul Gann and becoming
the first California senator in 50 years
to win a third term, while on the east
coast long-time Senator Jacob Javits
went down to defeat.
"I'm going to miss Jimmy Carter
and I'm going to miss many of my old
friends in the Senate," Cranston told
supporters yesterday."I will be car
rying the banner of the cause that
brings us together in the Democratic
Party."
With 70 percent of the precincts
counted, Californians were favoring
the 66-ye; r-old Senate majority whip
with 57 percent of the vote to barely 36
percent for Gann.
Cranston had directed his aides
Monday to research the state records
for the widest margin and the most
votes scored in a U.S. Senate election.
But there were no claims entered in
the record books early today, although
Cranston carried 3,221,286 votes to
Gann's 2,029,805, with 70 percent of the
state's 22,829 precincts reporting.

Seven incumbent Democratic sena
tors fell with Carter as Republicans
took control of the Senate.
GOP challengers ousted Democrat
ic Sens. George McGovern of South
Dakota, Warren Magnuson, the rank
ing member of the Senate; Frank
Church of Idaho, chairman of the For
eign Relations Committee; John
Durkin of New Hampshire, John
Culver of lowa and Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin.
"I expect to be able to work much
more effectively with Ronald Reagan
than with Richard Nixon," Cranston
said after the former California gov
ernor's victory was assured.
"All I wanted was a victory."
Cranston admitted after his own win
showed less than the 2-1 edge late polls
had forecast.
Cranston had expected a healthy
share of crossover votes in the bitter
contest with Gann, the 68-year-old co
author of Proposition 13. the Califor
nia property tax ceiling initiative, run
ning for his first political office.
Cranston, who strongly supported
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
and the SALT II treaty, vowed to "con
tinue to work for world peace through

nuclear arms control and diplomacy."
During an invective-filled cam
paign, Gann attacked Cranston as a
free-spending liberal who became a
millionaire in office, while Cranston
used Gann's two personal
bankruptcies to paint him as an ir
responsible administrator.
In conceding defeat yesterday,
Gann lamented the lack of funds that
precluded an aggressive media blitz in
the final lap of the race.
"We could have used the $450,000
the national campaign organization
took away from us," Gann com
plained. "Because of the loss, we had
to drop a lot of media time."
He told supporters at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel that he just "never had an
itch" to hold public office, despite his
grassroots rise to prominence behind
two tax-slashing initiatives.
Across the continent in New York it
was the night of defeat for long time
Senator Jacob Javits.
His wife. Marion, was near tears,
his children red-eyed and s allowing
hard. But when Javits toi center
stage in the Georgian Rcc , of the
Sheraton Centre Hotel yesterday eve
ning. he was grinning and waving his
arms at the crowd, and for minutes he
could not silence the shouts and ap
plause.
The moment of concession had been
delayed until 11:40 p.m., when Javits
finally abandoned hopes of waiting un
til he knew whether Republican
Alfonse D'Amato or Democrat Eliz
abeth Holtzman would replace him in
Washington. (D'Amato claimed vic
tory late last night, but Holtzman re
fused to conceded
Defeated by D'Amato in the GOP
primary, Javits had pressed on as the
Liberal Party candidate despite the
difficulties of raising money and run
ning without a major party organiza
tion. He pressed on even when many of
his supporters abandoned him and
called for him to drop out. lest he be
come a spoiler.
Suffering from a progressive motor
neuron disease that polls showed had
played heavily in his primary defeat,
Javits sometimes appeared tired and
drained during the campaign. But in
the last few days he acted as if he had
caught a second wind, campaigning
vigorously throughout the state. The
hopelessness of his quest could not
conquer the habits of a lifetime.

Cranston survived an election blitz
that won control of the Senate for the
GOP, soundly defeating Republican
challenger Paul Gann and becoming
the first California senator in 50 years
to win a third term, while on the east
coast long-time Senator Jacob Javits
went down to defeat.
"I'm going to miss Jimmy Carter
and I'm going to miss many of my old
friends in the Senate," Cranston told
supporters yesterday."I will be car
rying the banner of the cause that
brings us together in the Democratic
Party."
With 70 percent of the precincts
counted, Californians were favoring
the 66-ye; r-old Senate majority whip
with 57 percent of the vote to barely 36
percent for Gann.
Cranston had directed his aides
Monday to research the state records
for the widest margin and the most
votes scored in a U.S. Senate election.
But there were no claims entered in
the record books early today, although
Cranston carried 3,221,286 votes to
Gann's 2,029,805, with 70 percent of the
state's 22,829 precincts reporting.

Seven incumbent Democratic sena
tors fell with Carter as Republicans
took control of the Senate.
GOP challengers ousted Democrat
ic Sens. George McGovern of South
Dakota, Warren Magnuson, the rank
ing member of the Senate; Frank
Church of Idaho, chairman of the For
eign Relations Committee; John
Durkin of New Hampshire, John
Culver of lowa and Gaylord Nelson of
Wisconsin.
"I expect to be able to work much
more effectively with Ronald Reagan
than with Richard Nixon," Cranston
said after the former California gov
ernor's victory was assured.
"All I wanted was a victory."
Cranston admitted after his own win
showed less than the 2-1 edge late polls
had forecast.
Cranston had expected a healthy
share of crossover votes in the bitter
contest with Gann, the 68-year-old co
author of Proposition 13. the Califor
nia property tax ceiling initiative, run
ning for his first political office.
Cranston, who strongly supported
the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
and the SALT II treaty, vowed to "con
tinue to work for world peace through

nuclear arms control and diplomacy."
During an invective-filled cam
paign, Gann attacked Cranston as a
free-spending liberal who became a
millionaire in office, while Cranston
used Gann's two personal
bankruptcies to paint him as an ir
responsible administrator.
In conceding defeat yesterday,
Gann lamented the lack of funds that
precluded an aggressive media blitz in
the final lap of the race.
"We could have used the $450,000
the national campaign organization
took away from us," Gann com
plained. "Because of the loss, we had
to drop a lot of media time."
He told supporters at the Beverly
Hilton Hotel that he just "never had an
itch" to hold public office, despite his
grassroots rise to prominence behind
two tax-slashing initiatives.
