# Voters voice support of draft with nays on 'C'
## 
### Victor Goetz 
Santa Clara County voters strongly
rejected anti-draft Measure C with a
no vote of about 60 percent.
Though in no way legally binding,
the measure posed the question "are
you opposed to a peacetime military
draft?" In fact, the advisory vote
served as little more than a conve
nient poll to help elected otficials take
their constituency's pulse on the issue.
Proponents had hoped that the
measure, despite its limited scope in
only one California county, would be
taken as a serious endeavor to notify
government that there were alter
natives to a peacetime draft in assur
ing the security of the nation.
"I really didn't know what kind of
turnout they were expecting, but con
sidering that the people of this country
elected Ronald Reagan president. I'll
believe anything," said Julie Barnard
of Stanford Against Conscription.

"The result shows that we have a lot of
work to do (in eliminating the draft)."
Marc Strassman, a SAC member
who lost his bid in last spring's Demo
cratic primary for a chance to oppose
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Park)
yesterday, said he was disappointed in
the outcome but some hope also.
"About 40 percent of the voters
voted for me in the democratic prima
ry. about 40 percent voted for Tom
Hayden in his 1976 attempt to unseat
Sen. John Tunney, about 40 percent
voted in favor of a rent control propo
sition in Mountain View and about 40
percent of the people of Sweden voted
to ban (nuclear power)," said
Strassman.
"All this shows that about 40
percent of the people have progressive
attitudes," said the man who ran last
spring on an anti-draft, anti-nuclear
platform.
