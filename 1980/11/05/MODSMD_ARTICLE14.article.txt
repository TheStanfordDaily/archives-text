## Escort service won't work 
### 
We'd like to respond to the recent article <Dai-
ly. Oct 23) that discussed the failure of the escort
service to attract clients While we appreciate the
willingness of the escort service workers — both
men and women — to volunteer their time in an
effort to help prevent rape, we see several prob
lems inherent in the idea of the service, problems
that show up in the limited number of calls it re
ceives
As Kate Lear points out in the article, potential
users are reluctant to call because they don't
know the escorts and because "they fear they are
wasting the escort's time." These reasons are le
gitimate It is difficult to ask a favor of someone
you don't know.and. because the service is run by
volunteers, calling for an escort really does
amount to asking another student for a favor
More importantly, by calling the service, wom
en must admit that they are vulnerable, that they
feel afraid, that they need help When she calls the
escort service, a woman is accentuating her
weakness. This is especially true when she calls a
man. who is not in the same vulnerable position as
she is.
Where a woman can join with her as an equal,
making a strong unit that is greater than the sum
of its parts, a man becomes her "protector" and is
thus conferring even more of a favor He will nev
er need the same protection in return.
Rape happens because there is an unequal
power relationship between men and women
When a woman must be "escorted" by a man in
order to be safe, that unequal relationship be

comes even more obvious Women need to fight
rape with strength, not weakness Only when they
can do this will a shift in the power ration begin to
take place
The fact that the service had to be created by
students and run by volunteers shows that the Uni
versity does not take the problem of rape serious
ly Several universities have night time shuttle
services that are funded by university funds (ul
timately paid for largely by tuition) and staffed by
paid workers.
When students need to go somewhere at night
alone, they call the shuttle and wait to be picked
up It is true that this kind of service would cost
money, but where is our sense of priorities if we
cannot provide a rape prevention service that will
really be used by students 9
Of course a night time shuttle service is not an
ideal solution: women who use it are still being
protected by something or someone outside them
selves But at least that protection is no longer a
favor conferred by one individual on another; it
becomes instead the responsibility of the whole
university.
Rape is everyone's problem, not just that of
certain individuals who happen to be concerned
about it It is the responsibility of the whole socie
ty — in this case embodied in the university — to
enforce women's right to freedom from rape.
