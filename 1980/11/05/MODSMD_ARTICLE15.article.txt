## Getting ready for the worst 
### 
During this election year,
even the superficiality of the
candidates' dialogue about "the
issues" could hardly obscure
the fact that this country is in
very serious trouble. Also, dur
ing an election year, it's obvious
that many people still hope for
political solutions to our prob
lems. I'm convinced that this is
an unrealistic hope. I don't be
lieve that any politician could
possibly deal adequately with
the crises that are almost upon
us.
The most obvious man
ifestations of our problems are
economic ones. The value of the
dollar is decaying exponentially
at an accelerating rate. It is un
likely that the economy can con
tinue to function as well as it has
in the past, because financial in
struments such as stocks and
bonds, savings accounts, mort
gage loar 5 and pension plans
simply do not make sense in an
inflationary environment.
As a result, there is less and
less money available for build
ing new homes, factories, and
the like, while more money
pours into speculation. Thus, in
the absence of a financial panic
(which seems more and more
likely), we can look forward to
years of declining productivity
and a declining standard of liv
ing.
Unfortunately, our worst
problems are not economic. In
deed. the economic issues may
only be important inasmuch as
they contribute to the issue of
war and peace. This year, there
has been a lot of bally-hoo about
the idea that the military bal
ance has tilted in favor of the So
viets. This may or may not be
true. What's important is that
the very nature of nuclear con
flict is undergoing an ir
reversible change, because of
the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and because of im
provements in the subtle and in
genious electronic instruments
that guide the warheads to their
targets.

In previous years, each nucle
ar power could rest "secure" in
the knowledge that its opponent
could not launch a nuclear war
without committing national su
icide in the process. Today, this
comforting doctrine of
"Mutually Assured Destruc
tion" is rapidly becoming a
dead letter. It is being replaced
by the doctrines of counterforce
and limited nuclear war. and
the realities of nuclear pro
liferation.
Ballistic missiles are now suf
ficiently accurate to destroy en
emy missiles in their silos.
Bombers are highly vulnerable
to intelligent anti-aircraft mis
siles and downward-looking
radar systems. Even nuclear
submarines are becoming in
creasingly vulnerable, due to
the development of instruments
that can track their locations.
Significant advantages will now
accrue to the aggressor in a nu
clear war. A swift surprise at
tack offers the potential to de
stroy much of an opponent's
strategic arsenal.
Admittedly, ordering a nucle
ar war would be risky, because
you could never be sure just how
much firepower the opponent
would have left to use against
you You might think the enemy
would have several hundred
bombs left, in which case you
might be deterred. On the other
hand, you might think that, in
the post-attack environment,
your opponent's command and
control structure would be so
disorganized and demoralized
that it couldn't manage to get
anything off the ground Do you
see how interesting this kind of
game is to the macho intellect 0
Can you feel yourself reach for
the red button 0
In view of all of this. I think
it's just an inescapable con
clusion that anyone who is plan
ning a career in urban or sub
urban America can look for
ward to a struggle with a declin
ing real income year after year.
This decline will be punctuated
by occasional shortages and mi

nor economic crises, and the
spectres of financial collapse
and nuclear war will always be
looming on the horizon.
I've held this gloomy opinion
for several years now. and it can
be awfully depressing. I 've tried
a number of fairly conventional
solutions. Lately I've even
flirted with Libertarianism. But
it always comes to the same
thing: whatever the proposal is
it's too little, too late, it won't
really work and no one will sup
port it anyhow.
I've also tried experiments in
ostrich-like behavior: pretend
ing that there's nothing wrong,
refusing to read the newspaper
except for the comics, and going
to the beach as often as possible.
This works pretty well for most
people, and much of the time it
works for me — until I listen to
the news on the radio.
Nov, that I'm reaching the
end of my formal education I've
forced myself to stop thinking
about the world's problems so
much, and devote more time to
immediate concerns: where
and how to find a job. what kind
of lifestyle to aim for. and all
that. In the process. I've come
to a very important realization:
some places are better than oth
ers. If there is an economic co
lapse or a nuclear war, then
some people are going to die,
but many will be relatively un
disturbed.
If the worst that anyone can
imagine happens, the world
won't end. Even in America and
Russia, there will probably be
millions left alive to pick up the
pieces. Furthermore, the entire
southern hemisphere will be
largely undisturbed, as weather
patterns will tend to concen
trate fallout effects in the
northern hemisphere. (There is
some scientific debate over this
issue: there is concern that the
ocean's plankton might die. or
the ozone layer might disap
pear. But. in general, the scien
tific consensus is that life will
go on.)

My conclusion, then, is that
young people who are starting
out their careers will do well to
consider living their lives either
in small American towns far
away from military installa
tions, or else in the southern
hemisphere. Neither of these al
ternatives is as impossible, or
even as unpalatable, as it might
seem at first.
Today, small-town America
is undergoing something of a
renaissance. Many industrial
and electronics companies are
starting to locate branches in
small towns, so there are in
teresting jobs available. Prop
erty values are low. so you may
be able to afford a house if you
want one. If you put in a well
stocked fallout shelter in the
basement, and learn to grow
your own food. I'd say you'll be
ready for anything; but even if
the worst never happens, many
people might prefer the kind of
lifestyle that small towns have
to offer.
On the other hand, if big-city
life is your thing, there are
many cities in the southern
hemisphere that are cos
mopolitan and exciting, and. as
yet. untargeted by 10-megaton
warheads. For me, Australia
and New Zealand seem most in
teresting. but some people
might prefer South America.
Brazil, for example, is relative
ly prosperous. All of these
places have a constant demand
for American skills, especially
technical skills.
In any event. I expect that
soon after I receive my degree.
I'll leave for some far-away cor
ner of the world Some day, I ex
pect I'll have the dubious pleas
ure of having my opinions con
firmed when I read about World
War 111 in the newspaper. Of
course, I'll feel some regrets,
but I'll gather my loved ones to
gether and give each one a hug,
and say "Thank God, it wasn't
us." The next day, I'll take the
day off. and do some gardening.

As a result, there is less and
less money available for build

the absence of a financial panic

years of declining productivity

Unfortunately, our worst
problems are not economic. In
deed. the economic issues may
only be important inasmuch as
they contribute to the issue of
war and peace. This year, there
has been a lot of bally-hoo about
the idea that the military bal
ance has tilted in favor of the So

true. What's important is that
the very nature of nuclear con

reversible change, because of
the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and because of im

genious electronic instruments
that guide the warheads to their
targets.

In previous years, each nucle
ar power could rest "secure" in
the knowledge that its opponent
could not launch a nuclear war
without committing national su

comforting doctrine of
"Mutually Assured Destruc

dead letter. It is being replaced
by the doctrines of counterforce
and limited nuclear war. and
the realities of nuclear pro

Bombers are highly vulnerable
to intelligent anti-aircraft mis

the development of instruments
that can track their locations.
Significant advantages will now
accrue to the aggressor in a nu

Admittedly, ordering a nucle

In view of all of this. I think
it's just an inescapable con
clusion that anyone who is plan
ning a career in urban or sub
urban America can look for
ward to a struggle with a declin
ing real income year after year.
This decline will be punctuated
by occasional shortages and mi

nor economic crises, and the
spectres of financial collapse
and nuclear war will always be
looming on the horizon.
I've held this gloomy opinion
for several years now. and it can
be awfully depressing. I 've tried
a number of fairly conventional
solutions. Lately I've even
flirted with Libertarianism. But
it always comes to the same
thing: whatever the proposal is
it's too little, too late, it won't
really work and no one will sup
port it anyhow.
I've also tried experiments in
ostrich-like behavior: pretend
ing that there's nothing wrong,
refusing to read the newspaper
except for the comics, and going
to the beach as often as possible.
This works pretty well for most
people, and much of the time it
works for me — until I listen to
the news on the radio.
Nov, that I'm reaching the
end of my formal education I've
forced myself to stop thinking
about the world's problems so
much, and devote more time to
immediate concerns: where
and how to find a job. what kind
of lifestyle to aim for. and all
that. In the process. I've come
to a very important realization:
some places are better than oth
ers. If there is an economic co
lapse or a nuclear war, then
some people are going to die,
but many will be relatively un
disturbed.
If the worst that anyone can
imagine happens, the world
won't end. Even in America and
Russia, there will probably be
millions left alive to pick up the
pieces. Furthermore, the entire
southern hemisphere will be
largely undisturbed, as weather
patterns will tend to concen
trate fallout effects in the
northern hemisphere. (There is
some scientific debate over this
issue: there is concern that the
ocean's plankton might die. or
the ozone layer might disap
pear. But. in general, the scien
tific consensus is that life will
go on.)

My conclusion, then, is that
young people who are starting
out their careers will do well to
consider living their lives either
in small American towns far
away from military installa
tions, or else in the southern
hemisphere. Neither of these al
ternatives is as impossible, or
even as unpalatable, as it might
seem at first.
Today, small-town America
is undergoing something of a
renaissance. Many industrial
and electronics companies are
starting to locate branches in
small towns, so there are in
teresting jobs available. Prop
erty values are low. so you may
be able to afford a house if you
want one. If you put in a well
stocked fallout shelter in the
basement, and learn to grow
your own food. I'd say you'll be
ready for anything; but even if
the worst never happens, many
people might prefer the kind of
lifestyle that small towns have
to offer.
On the other hand, if big-city
life is your thing, there are
many cities in the southern
hemisphere that are cos
mopolitan and exciting, and. as
yet. untargeted by 10-megaton
warheads. For me, Australia
and New Zealand seem most in
teresting. but some people
might prefer South America.
Brazil, for example, is relative
ly prosperous. All of these
places have a constant demand
for American skills, especially
technical skills.
In any event. I expect that
soon after I receive my degree.
I'll leave for some far-away cor
ner of the world Some day, I ex
pect I'll have the dubious pleas
ure of having my opinions con
firmed when I read about World
War 111 in the newspaper. Of
course, I'll feel some regrets,
but I'll gather my loved ones to
gether and give each one a hug,
and say "Thank God, it wasn't
us." The next day, I'll take the
day off. and do some gardening.

viets. This may or may not be
true. What's important is that
the very nature of nuclear con
flict is undergoing an ir
reversible change, because of
the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and because of im
provements in the subtle and in
genious electronic instruments
that guide the warheads to their
targets.

In previous years, each nucle
ar power could rest "secure" in
the knowledge that its opponent
could not launch a nuclear war
without committing national su
icide in the process. Today, this
comforting doctrine of
"Mutually Assured Destruc
tion" is rapidly becoming a
dead letter. It is being replaced
by the doctrines of counterforce
and limited nuclear war. and
the realities of nuclear pro
liferation.
Ballistic missiles are now suf
ficiently accurate to destroy en
emy missiles in their silos.
Bombers are highly vulnerable
to intelligent anti-aircraft mis
siles and downward-looking
radar systems. Even nuclear
submarines are becoming in
creasingly vulnerable, due to
the development of instruments
that can track their locations.
Significant advantages will now
accrue to the aggressor in a nu
clear war. A swift surprise at
tack offers the potential to de
stroy much of an opponent's
strategic arsenal.
Admittedly, ordering a nucle
ar war would be risky, because
you could never be sure just how
much firepower the opponent
would have left to use against
you You might think the enemy
would have several hundred
bombs left, in which case you
might be deterred. On the other
hand, you might think that, in
the post-attack environment,
your opponent's command and
control structure would be so
disorganized and demoralized
that it couldn't manage to get
anything off the ground Do you
see how interesting this kind of
game is to the macho intellect 0
Can you feel yourself reach for
the red button 0
In view of all of this. I think
it's just an inescapable con
clusion that anyone who is plan
ning a career in urban or sub
urban America can look for
ward to a struggle with a declin
ing real income year after year.
This decline will be punctuated
by occasional shortages and mi

nor economic crises, and the
spectres of financial collapse
and nuclear war will always be
looming on the horizon.
I've held this gloomy opinion
for several years now. and it can
be awfully depressing. I 've tried
a number of fairly conventional
solutions. Lately I've even
flirted with Libertarianism. But
it always comes to the same
thing: whatever the proposal is
it's too little, too late, it won't
really work and no one will sup
port it anyhow.
I've also tried experiments in
ostrich-like behavior: pretend
ing that there's nothing wrong,
refusing to read the newspaper
except for the comics, and going
to the beach as often as possible.
This works pretty well for most
people, and much of the time it
works for me — until I listen to
the news on the radio.
Nov, that I'm reaching the
end of my formal education I've
forced myself to stop thinking
about the world's problems so
much, and devote more time to
immediate concerns: where
and how to find a job. what kind
of lifestyle to aim for. and all
that. In the process. I've come
to a very important realization:
some places are better than oth
ers. If there is an economic co
lapse or a nuclear war, then
some people are going to die,
but many will be relatively un
disturbed.
If the worst that anyone can
imagine happens, the world
won't end. Even in America and
Russia, there will probably be
millions left alive to pick up the
pieces. Furthermore, the entire
southern hemisphere will be
largely undisturbed, as weather
patterns will tend to concen
trate fallout effects in the
northern hemisphere. (There is
some scientific debate over this
issue: there is concern that the
ocean's plankton might die. or
the ozone layer might disap
pear. But. in general, the scien
tific consensus is that life will
go on.)

My conclusion, then, is that
young people who are starting
out their careers will do well to
consider living their lives either
in small American towns far
away from military installa
tions, or else in the southern
hemisphere. Neither of these al
ternatives is as impossible, or
even as unpalatable, as it might
seem at first.
Today, small-town America
is undergoing something of a
renaissance. Many industrial
and electronics companies are
starting to locate branches in
small towns, so there are in
teresting jobs available. Prop
erty values are low. so you may
be able to afford a house if you
want one. If you put in a well
stocked fallout shelter in the
basement, and learn to grow
your own food. I'd say you'll be
ready for anything; but even if
the worst never happens, many
people might prefer the kind of
lifestyle that small towns have
to offer.
On the other hand, if big-city
life is your thing, there are
many cities in the southern
hemisphere that are cos
mopolitan and exciting, and. as
yet. untargeted by 10-megaton
warheads. For me, Australia
and New Zealand seem most in
teresting. but some people
might prefer South America.
Brazil, for example, is relative
ly prosperous. All of these
places have a constant demand
for American skills, especially
technical skills.
In any event. I expect that
soon after I receive my degree.
I'll leave for some far-away cor
ner of the world Some day, I ex
pect I'll have the dubious pleas
ure of having my opinions con
firmed when I read about World
War 111 in the newspaper. Of
course, I'll feel some regrets,
but I'll gather my loved ones to
gether and give each one a hug,
and say "Thank God, it wasn't
us." The next day, I'll take the
day off. and do some gardening.
