Close encounter
We wish to protest the com
pletely unrestrained use of bi
cycles and Mopeds on the Stan
ford campus Today one of our
staff members was knocked
down by two bicyclists near the
tennis courts, in what might
have been for her a disastrous
accident We have all seen acci
dents happen, and most of us
have had narrow escapes.
Walking on campus is no long
er a pleasure, but a nerve rack
ing hazard; cyclists whiz along
at high speeds, ignoring pedes
trians and what few traffic signs
there are There is nowhere to
escape from them: White Plaza
and the Mall are especially haz
ardous as are the walkways
around the Quad
For some reason, bicycle ac
cidents seem to be taken very
lightly by riders and. apparent
ly. by the police, yet they can
cause extensive and expensive
damage to the victims
How long is this situation to
be allowed to continue 9 Do pe
destrians have no rights at all?
The faculty and staff of this de
partment formally request that
steps be taken — and made pub
lic — to regulate bicycle traffic

on campus. This has become a
dangerous situation
The University cannot afford
to wait until a serious accident
happens, nor can it afford to ap
pear to be taking this possibility
lightly. There is a very heavy re
sponsibility involved here: in
our own interest, and in that of
the University, we hope that
those who bear it are beginning
to pay attention.

We are informed that a vote
for "one of the major party can
didates is truly to waste your
vote" (Daily, Oct. 30).
The Daily would profit from
realizing that many of its
readers wish to vote, not for
high ideals, but rather to have
some effect on how their coun
try is run the next four or eight
years.
Thus, that which the Daily
terms (sic) "the hysteria of this
campaign of fear" (i.e. the ac
knowledgement that John An
derson cannot win), is, by more
practical folk, termed "re
alism."
Anderson will not lose merely
because he is a third, nay, no
party candidate. Even with a
party he did not win a single pri
mary. He will lose because he
has no support whatsoever in
the South, among labor, nor
among the disadvantaged that
the Daily asserts that Ronald
Reagan neglects.
Anderson's, and the Daily's,
problem is there simply is not
enough upper-middle-class, col
lege-educated liberals in this
country. Until such time as this
quiche-eating class, which
forms the majority of An
derson's support, should swell

in ranks, no candidate such as
Anderson will ever stand a
chance.
The Daily, finding Reagan
and President Jimmy Carter
gauche, have opted instead, to
trade their real vote for the
right, a year from now, to dis
play a "Don't look at me. I did
not vote for ..." on the back of
their 320i's.

Funny money?
Recently, the federal govern
ment announced that it spent
$579 billion during fiscal 1980.
However, the government col
lected only $520 billion leaving a
budget deficit of $59 billion. Un
fortunately, most of us have no
concept of how much money this
really is.
Last year the federal govern
ment was spending money at a
rate of over a million dollars a
minute. Federal expenditures
amounted to approximately
$2600 for every person in the
country. Considering that every
nine minutes the government
spent a million dollars it didn't
have it is not surprising that the
dollar is rapidly losing it's val
ue. It is too bad that the rest of
us are limited to only spending
money that we already have.

'Le Crocodile'
Although Lacoste shirts are
pervasive on the Stanford cam
pus, the identity of the shirts'
reptilian emblem is generally
mistaken. Despite popular be
lief. the insignia is not an al
ligator.
The reptile featured on

Lacoste shirts was designed for
1920s French tennis champion,
Rene Lacoste. Lacoste was
noted for his tenacious play and
thus earned the nickname "Le
Crocodile ."
Therefore, the amphibian we
so frequently see grinning from
many a chest is truly a
crocodile, not its close relative
the alligator However, the
crocodile is as worthy a mascot
as any for Stanford athletic
teams, and it is particularly ap
propriate for our no. 1 ranked
water polo team.

concept of how much money this
really is.
Last year the federal govern
ment was spending money at a
rate of over a million dollars a
minute. Federal expenditures
amounted to approximately
$2600 for every person in the
country. Considering that every
nine minutes the government
spent a million dollars it didn't
have it is not surprising that the
dollar is rapidly losing it's val
ue. It is too bad that the rest of
us are limited to only spending
money that we already have.

'Le Crocodile'
Although Lacoste shirts are
pervasive on the Stanford cam
pus, the identity of the shirts'
reptilian emblem is generally
mistaken. Despite popular be
lief. the insignia is not an al
ligator.
The reptile featured on

Lacoste shirts was designed for
1920s French tennis champion,
Rene Lacoste. Lacoste was
noted for his tenacious play and
thus earned the nickname "Le
Crocodile ."
Therefore, the amphibian we
so frequently see grinning from
many a chest is truly a
crocodile, not its close relative
the alligator However, the
crocodile is as worthy a mascot
as any for Stanford athletic
teams, and it is particularly ap
propriate for our no. 1 ranked
water polo team.

I fear for my descendents is that
rather than reaching a steady

We wish to protest the com
pletely unrestrained use of bi
cycles and Mopeds on the Stan
ford campus Today one of our
staff members was knocked
down by two bicyclists near the
tennis courts, in what might
have been for her a disastrous
accident We have all seen acci
dents happen, and most of us
have had narrow escapes.
Walking on campus is no long
er a pleasure, but a nerve rack
ing hazard; cyclists whiz along
at high speeds, ignoring pedes
trians and what few traffic signs
there are There is nowhere to
escape from them: White Plaza
and the Mall are especially haz
ardous as are the walkways
around the Quad
For some reason, bicycle ac
cidents seem to be taken very
lightly by riders and. apparent
ly. by the police, yet they can
cause extensive and expensive
damage to the victims
How long is this situation to
be allowed to continue 9 Do pe
destrians have no rights at all?
The faculty and staff of this de
partment formally request that
steps be taken — and made pub
lic — to regulate bicycle traffic

on campus. This has become a
dangerous situation
The University cannot afford
to wait until a serious accident
happens, nor can it afford to ap
pear to be taking this possibility
lightly. There is a very heavy re
sponsibility involved here: in
our own interest, and in that of
the University, we hope that
those who bear it are beginning
to pay attention.

We are informed that a vote
for "one of the major party can
didates is truly to waste your
vote" (Daily, Oct. 30).
The Daily would profit from
realizing that many of its
readers wish to vote, not for
high ideals, but rather to have
some effect on how their coun
try is run the next four or eight
years.
Thus, that which the Daily
terms (sic) "the hysteria of this
campaign of fear" (i.e. the ac
knowledgement that John An
derson cannot win), is, by more
practical folk, termed "re
alism."
Anderson will not lose merely
because he is a third, nay, no
party candidate. Even with a
party he did not win a single pri
mary. He will lose because he
has no support whatsoever in
the South, among labor, nor
among the disadvantaged that
the Daily asserts that Ronald
Reagan neglects.
Anderson's, and the Daily's,
problem is there simply is not
enough upper-middle-class, col
lege-educated liberals in this
country. Until such time as this
quiche-eating class, which
forms the majority of An
derson's support, should swell

in ranks, no candidate such as
Anderson will ever stand a
chance.
The Daily, finding Reagan
and President Jimmy Carter
gauche, have opted instead, to
trade their real vote for the
right, a year from now, to dis
play a "Don't look at me. I did
not vote for ..." on the back of
their 320i's.
