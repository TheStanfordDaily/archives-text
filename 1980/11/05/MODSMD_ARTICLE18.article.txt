## The 						voter strikes out 
### 
The year 1980 will undoubted
ly be remembered for Holly
wood's sensational sequel to
Star Wars, The Empire Strikes
Back, but the ongoing campaign
for the presidency has been an
even better fantasy epic. The
American voter, symbolized by
Princess Leia, yesterday was
forced to choose between two
sub-optimal candidates for the
nation's highest office. The al
ternatives: the incumbent
young "hero" of the previous
episode. Luke Skywalker (alias
Jimmy Carter) and the older,
more experienced Federation
pilot, Han Solo (alias Ronald
Reagan).
Leia is not particularly in love
with either of them, but longs
for the wise and powerful but
benevolent individual who has
for so long been missing from
her life. The character Yoda
symbolizes the qualities which
Leia desires, and both Sky
walker and vSolo realize this and
attempt to emulate him. Sky
walker even goes so far as to
seek out Yoda on his home
planet and to learn Jedi traits
from him.
Accompanying him some
what reluctantly is the Demo
cratic droid, R2D2 (alias Ed
ward Kennedy), whose chances
with Leia have been marred by
previous mistakes; he ends up
covered with mud in Yoda's
swamp. Meanwhile, Skywalker
fails numerous attempts to
levitate rocks and other ob
stacles to his chances of recap
turing Leia's favor (such as un
employment and the economy).
Simultaneously, Solo is busy
trying to impress Leia with his
skills as a Federation pilot. She
is disturbed by his reckless,
war-like behavior; he threatens
her security by nearly colliding
with numerous asteroids (sym
bolizing foreign adversaries)
and nearly causing her ultimate
demise by arousing a giant ser
pent (alias the Soviet Union).
He is accompanied and sup
ported by the Republican droid,
C3PO (alias Gerald Ford),
whose previous experience and
stable, analytical thought have
impressed Leia in the past.
With her emotions confused
enough by the choice between
Solo and Skywalker, a third in
dependent candidate enters the
picture. His name is Lando
(alias John Anderson), a former
card-playing buddy of Han Solo.
He double-crosses his old friend
in attempting to win Leia's fa
vor. but she mistrusts his
motives and feels that their re
lationship would probably not be
successful.
Meanwhile, having failed mi

serably in his attempts to be
come the man whom Leia longs
for. Skywalker launches a des
peration maneuver. He tries to
impress Leia by confronting the
diabolical Darth Vader (alias
Avatollah Khomeini), who has
taken several Federation
citizens (including Leia herself)
hostage. He feels that freeing
these individuals would give
him the critical edge necessary
to overcome the threat of Han
Solo and Lando once and for all.
Although showing signs of
success in this endeavor, his
companion. Chewbacca (alias
the Democratic Party), re
mains concerned about his
chances with Leia. This hairy
creature, whose mouth is
always moving but seldom ut
ters intelligible sounds, is busy
repairing the damaged droid
R2D2. so that he will be ready
for the next episode (the 1984
election).
Thus, it should be clear from
the preceding paragraphs that
1980 will also be remembered as
the year in which The Voter
Strikes Out. It is a surprising
tragedy that a nation with the
greatness of America cannot
produce a strong, honest indi
vidual to lead it. Perhaps our
method of electing the Presi
dent of the United States should
be changed. A rhetorical ques
tion: in the face of an energy

crisis, poverty, unemployment,
and a ravaged economy in
America, how can candidates
justify extravagant campaigns
which include thousands of
travel miles in order to make
unrealistic promises which vot
ers are tired of hearing?
Bearing in mind that this
elaborate process takes over a
year, the time taken out of a pol
itician's job and put into a cam
paign effort becomes disturb
ing. If the pre-election process
could be simplified, money
would be saved and the term of
office could be shortened to,
say, two years. Such a system
would force more efficient na
tional government by keeping
the President "on his toes" for
the duration of his time in the
White House. Last-minute feats
such as sudden breakthroughs in
the Iranian hostage situation
several days prior to the elec
tion would be eliminated.
Finally, the current limit of
two terms or eight years in of
fice should be done away with. If
we ever find the Yoda whom we
so desperately need, he should
be allowed to remain at the
helm as long as possible. The
continuing success of our Feder
ation depends on the coming of
such an individual.

Avatollah Khomeini), who has
taken several Federation
citizens (including Leia herself)
hostage. He feels that freeing
these individuals would give
him the critical edge necessary
to overcome the threat of Han
Solo and Lando once and for all.
Although showing signs of
success in this endeavor, his
companion. Chewbacca (alias
the Democratic Party), re
mains concerned about his
chances with Leia. This hairy
creature, whose mouth is
always moving but seldom ut
ters intelligible sounds, is busy
repairing the damaged droid
R2D2. so that he will be ready
for the next episode (the 1984
election).
Thus, it should be clear from
the preceding paragraphs that
1980 will also be remembered as
the year in which The Voter
Strikes Out. It is a surprising
tragedy that a nation with the
greatness of America cannot
produce a strong, honest indi
vidual to lead it. Perhaps our
method of electing the Presi
dent of the United States should
be changed. A rhetorical ques
tion: in the face of an energy

crisis, poverty, unemployment,
and a ravaged economy in
America, how can candidates
justify extravagant campaigns
which include thousands of
travel miles in order to make
unrealistic promises which vot
ers are tired of hearing?
Bearing in mind that this
elaborate process takes over a
year, the time taken out of a pol
itician's job and put into a cam
paign effort becomes disturb
ing. If the pre-election process
could be simplified, money
would be saved and the term of
office could be shortened to,
say, two years. Such a system
would force more efficient na
tional government by keeping
the President "on his toes" for
the duration of his time in the
White House. Last-minute feats
such as sudden breakthroughs in
the Iranian hostage situation
several days prior to the elec
tion would be eliminated.
Finally, the current limit of
two terms or eight years in of
fice should be done away with. If
we ever find the Yoda whom we
so desperately need, he should
be allowed to remain at the
helm as long as possible. The
continuing success of our Feder
ation depends on the coming of
such an individual.

The year 1980 will undoubted
ly be remembered for Holly
wood's sensational sequel to
Star Wars, The Empire Strikes
Back, but the ongoing campaign
for the presidency has been an
even better fantasy epic. The
American voter, symbolized by
Princess Leia, yesterday was
forced to choose between two
sub-optimal candidates for the
nation's highest office. The al
ternatives: the incumbent
young "hero" of the previous
episode. Luke Skywalker (alias
Jimmy Carter) and the older,
more experienced Federation
pilot, Han Solo (alias Ronald
Reagan).
Leia is not particularly in love
with either of them, but longs
for the wise and powerful but
benevolent individual who has
for so long been missing from
her life. The character Yoda
symbolizes the qualities which
Leia desires, and both Sky
walker and vSolo realize this and
attempt to emulate him. Sky
walker even goes so far as to
seek out Yoda on his home
planet and to learn Jedi traits
from him.
Accompanying him some
what reluctantly is the Demo
cratic droid, R2D2 (alias Ed
ward Kennedy), whose chances
with Leia have been marred by
previous mistakes; he ends up
covered with mud in Yoda's
swamp. Meanwhile, Skywalker
fails numerous attempts to
levitate rocks and other ob
stacles to his chances of recap
turing Leia's favor (such as un
employment and the economy).
Simultaneously, Solo is busy
trying to impress Leia with his
skills as a Federation pilot. She
is disturbed by his reckless,
war-like behavior; he threatens
her security by nearly colliding
with numerous asteroids (sym
bolizing foreign adversaries)
and nearly causing her ultimate
demise by arousing a giant ser
pent (alias the Soviet Union).
He is accompanied and sup
ported by the Republican droid,
C3PO (alias Gerald Ford),
whose previous experience and
stable, analytical thought have
impressed Leia in the past.
With her emotions confused
enough by the choice between
Solo and Skywalker, a third in
dependent candidate enters the
picture. His name is Lando
(alias John Anderson), a former
card-playing buddy of Han Solo.
He double-crosses his old friend
in attempting to win Leia's fa
vor. but she mistrusts his
motives and feels that their re
lationship would probably not be
successful.
Meanwhile, having failed mi

serably in his attempts to be
come the man whom Leia longs
for. Skywalker launches a des
peration maneuver. He tries to
impress Leia by confronting the
diabolical Darth Vader (alias
Avatollah Khomeini), who has
taken several Federation
citizens (including Leia herself)
hostage. He feels that freeing
