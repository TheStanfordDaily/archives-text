# Senate liberals hit with stinging defeats
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Sen. Birch Bayh (D-
Ind ). last night becamethe first casu
alty of the biggest Republican push in
a quarter century for control of the
Senate. Latest returns early this
morning apparently had the new Sen
ate aligned along a 51 to 48 Republican
majority following conservative
Ronald Reagan's landslide presiden
tial victory.
Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.),
the 1972 Democratic presidential nom
inee and another principal target of
right-wing efforts to rid the Senate of
its leading liberals, was running be
hind NBC projected Rep. James
Abdnor (R-S.D.). as the winner over
McGovern.

In Alabama. NBC also projected a
victory for Republican Jeremiah Den
ton, a retired admiral. Vietnam War
prisoner of war and favorite of the
Moral Majority, in the race to succeed
Sen. Donald Stewart, who was un
seated in the state's Democratic pri
mary,
But several moderate-to-con
servative Democrats appeared to be
holding onto their seats on the basis of
early returns from yesterday's voting
for Senate seats in 34 states.
Among Democrats. Sen. Wendell
Ford (D-Ky.) t and John Glenn (D-
Ohio). won re-election handily. Senate
Budget Committee Chairman Ernest
Boilings (D-S.C.), captured a third
term. Agriculture Committee Chair

man Herman Talmadge, (D-Ga.),
reprimanded by the Senate for finan
cial irregularities a year ago, was run
ning well ahead. So were Sens. Robert
Morgan (D-N.C.h Thomas Eagleton
(D-Mo.), and Dale Bumpers (D-Ark).
Sen Patrick Leahy, Democrat, also
captured his race for re-election from

Vermont.
Rep. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn. >.
won the race to succeed retiring Sen.
Abraham Ribicoff (D-Conn). Illinois
Secretary of State Alan Dixon led Lt.
Gov. David O'Neal in the fight to take
over the seat being vacated by Sen.
Adlai Stevenson (D-Ill). In Florida.
Democrat Bill Gunter took an early
lead in the race to succeed Sen Rich
ard Stone. Democrat, whom Gunter
beat in a primary.
Among Republicans. Sen. Charles
Mathias (R-Md.), won a third term,
and Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan ), was
leading. For the seat being vacated by
Sen. Henry Bellmon (R-Okla.), Re
publican State Sen. Don Nickles was
leading Democrat Andy Coats. For
the seat of retiring Sen. Richard
Schweiker (R-Pa), former Philadel
phia district attorney Arlen Specter.
Republican, was projected the victor
by ABC News.
In North Dakota. Rep. Mark An
drews, Republican, was a strong fa
vorite to take the seat being relin
quished by Sen. Milton Young. Re
publican, and was projected the win
ner by NBC.
The pattern of victories, defeats
and tight races indicated significant
gains for the Republicans in their ef
forts to win control of the Senate,
which has been under Democratic
domination for 26 years. The Demo
crats now control 59 of the 100 Senate
seats.
Whatever the final breakdown, it
did appear that the Senate would take
on a considerably more conservative
outlook because many of the leading
Republican contenders are strong con
servatives and the imperiled Demo
crats come primarily from the liberal
wing of their party
As a party, the Republicans outs
pent the Democrats by about 6 to 1 —
$6 million as opposed to less than $1
million — leaving the Democratic
candidates largely to forage for th» m-

selves, although many of them, aided
bv organized labor and their own de
vices. did so with lucrative results.
There were also some old hands and
influential committee chairmen —
most conspicuously Sen. Warren
Magnuson (D-Wash ), president pro
tempore of the Senate and chairman of
its powerful Appropriations Commit
tee — who were caught in tight races.
Like Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.).
71, the 75-vear-old Magnuson ran into
trouble because of advancing age and
physical infirmities. Both apparently
lost their re-election bids.
Another veteran. Talmadge, had to
contend with a late-blooming Re
publican threat after barely making it
through a tough primary contest
earlier in the year.
Sens. Richard Stone (D-Fla.),
Donald Stewart (D-Ala.) and Mike
Gravel ID-Alaska), weren't so lucky
in the earlier rounds. They were de
feated in Democratic primaries or
primary runoffs, opening the way for
free-for-alls in their states in the gen
eral election.
