# Conservatism, experience to mark Reagan's administration
## Political pragmatism predicted 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Based on what he has said
and done in the past. President-elect Ronald
Wilson Reagan can be expected to be
basically conservative and is almost certain
to run head-on into conflict with Congress.
But he also will tend to be politically
pragmatic.
He probably will try to surround himself
with a strong and protective staff that
shares his concept of government and will
shield him from as many of his day-to-day
problems as they can. so he can husband his
time and strength
He will view himself as a fighter to re
duce the influence of government in the av
erage citizen's life — and that, inevitably,
will make for problems with the legislative
branch, where citizen demands for govern
ment action are focused
And in international affairs, his long
standing animosity toward communism and
his belief that military might is the nation's
best protection against the Soviet Union will
guide his decisions
In short. Reagan, who campaigned in the
primaries as a conservative and who sought
to soften his hard-line image in the run-off.
will revert to his basic instincts in the White
House.
Unchanged
"I am what I have always been, and I in
tend to remain that way," the 69-year-old
former California governor has said. He has
also commented that he would never com
promise his beliefs "to garner a vote here
and there."
Nevertheless, he altered his views sever
al times in the heat of the general election
campaign because his staff worried about
the political effect and urged him to show
what might be termed pragmatism.
Reagan once opposed federal aid to New
York City, but switched to support. And his
win there last night was a big electoral
prize.
Bail-out switch
He once opposed bail-out funds for the ail
ing Chrysler Corp., but switched to support.
Michigan was also viewed as vital to his
cause.
He has for years scorned the Occupa
tional Safety and Health Administration,
but now sees it as some kind of a research
agency useful in providing worker safety.
Blue-collar workers, who are protected by
OSHA, were a key to his success in yester
day's election.
These and other examples of
"pragmatism" are the bane of the con
servative wing of the Republican Party. Its
members want Reagan to be as con
servative in his actions in the White House
as his rhetoric was over the past three dec
ades.
Here is what can be expected in the Re
agan administration:
Tried and true
He will assemble a White House team
that is a mixture of tried and trusted Cali
fornians and of experienced hands from the
previous administrations of Gerald Ford
and Richard Nixon.
He probably will put his loyal friend and
aide, Edw : n Meeselll, in charge of the tran
sition tea.n to start negotiating with the out
going administration of President Jimmy
Carter on an orderly transfer of power. Ac
tually. preparations by the Reagan camp
have been going on for the past year, but
have been kept out of the limelight because
the Reagan forces did not want to appear
cocky and overconfident.
But there are more than 4300 appoint
ments he can make, and he is being coun
seled to go about it slowly and cautiously, to
concentrate on competence and commit
ment to his own policy objectives.
9-to-5 man
When he was governor, he sometimes was
referred to by his critics as a "9-to-5 gov
ernor." one who liked to flee from the cares
of his office in the evening, one who wanted
problems presented to him in mini-memos

simply stated with succinct options
Reagan and his staff are aware that if he
becomes president there will be no haven
from the pressures. It is only possible to
learn how to manage them
One thing the presidential campaign
proved: that Reagan's age did not become
much of a public issue, that he managed to
survive the grueling but carefully con
trolled travel schedule with no apparent ef
fect on his health, that his occasional
bloopers and misjudgments were more the
result of his own deeply-held conservatism
than of fatigue.
Legacy
Reagan knows that his lasting legacy will
be his judicial appointments.
Based on his record of appointing judges
when he was governor, Reagan will allow
lawyers he trusts to screen the list of appli
cants for him Generally, his appointees
will be rated on their qualifications more
than on their political philosophy.
He will probably get to make an appoint
ment or two to the Supreme Court — Carter
has had none — and Reagan has said that
one of his first will be a woman.

When it comes to putting his policies into
effect, this can be expected:
— Reagan clearly intends to try to re
verse the role of government from an ac
tivist to a passive and diminishing role in
the lives of Americans. He intends to ask
Congress to join him in this venture. He in
tends to appoint Cabinet officers and admin
istrators who share this view of govern
ment And he intends to use his veto power
and his purse-string control — by simply not
spending money — to carry it out.
In principle, many in Congress will join
him. But in practice, it almost certainly
means conflict. When citizens want help,
they turn to Congress. The lawmakers are
besieged with problems to solve — more
money, more projects, more demands for
action. If the president is forever saying
"no." fights ensue.
— He will promptly call for a freeze on all
federal hiring. There already is a partial
freeze, ordered by Carter last March, but
Reagan and his staff don't believe it is
enough. Carter's proposal says in effect that
for every two full-time employees who
leave or retire, only one can be replaced.
Carter claims it has reduced the number of
federal employees by 20,000.
Total hiring halt
Reagan has repeatedly promised that he
will issue an order to stop all hiring, even re
placements, and that has usually brought a
big round of applause. But already, there is
talk he might have to make some exceptions
in sensitive job areas, such as air traffic
control.
— He will serve notice on Congress that
he intends to fight for an across-the-board
income tax rate cut. He says he will not back
down on his intention to get similar cuts for
each of the next two years, for a total 30
percent cut, despite growing fears of such a
policy's inflationary effect.
— Almost immediately, he will call on the
nation's business community to donate the
services of hundreds of its most talented ex

ecutives to come to Washington and form a
task force for government reorganization
He did this when he became governor and
ever since he has been expressing pride
about how many of that task force's recom
mendations were put into effect
No more regulations
— He will tell everyone — his Cabinet of
ficers. his staff, the second and third-level
bureaucrats — that he wants no more feder
al regulations placed on business and the
private enterprise system unless the cost ef
fectiveness is clearly established A conflict
with environmentalists and consumers is in
evitable.
During the campaign, he promised voters
he would start the laborious process of peel
ing off layer after layer of existing regu
lations, but never identified which ones.
Many regulations stem from executive or
ders. many from regulatory agencies set up
by law Just because a president wants it
doesn't necessarily make it happen
— He will begin a cautious journey into in
ternational relations. His campaign
speeches have been laced with a deeply held
anti-communism He has said he is willing
to talk to the Russians about strategic arms
limitations, for example, but. he has the un
spoken conviction that the Russians can't be
trusted, no matter what piece of paper they
sign.
Warmonger
From time to time, this hard-line view of
the good guys vs. the bad guys seemed to get
him in trouble during the campaign. Carter,
in effect called him a warmonger. So Re
agan tried to emphasize his desire for
peace, but his basic anti-communism never
changed.
And those feelings about anti-com
munism probably will apply to his dealings
with Third World nations that choose com
munism-socialism over democracy.
Here is what to expect on some specific
issues he talked about in the campaign:
OSHA — He has been belaboring it for
years, ridiculing what he called nonsensical
regulations for workers' safety. But he
won't try to get rid of it, at least initially.
Department of Education — Once part of
the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare, the agency was created by Carter
to give education a separate and more in
fluential role in government. Reagan in
tends to dismantle it.
Department of Energy — Also a new
creation. Reagan will try to bury it. trans
ferring a few functions to other agencies.
He believes the oil industry should be freed
of most government regulations.
Inheritance tax — Reagan said it should
be abolished, then ran into problems when
he was trying to adjust his proposed eco
nomic package to achieve a balanced
budget and decided to drop the idea. Later in
the campaign he came back to it again and
now is prepared to sign legislation
abolishing the tax at the federal level.
Oil industry windfall profits tax — Consis
tent with his conservatism. Reagan will try
to abolish it, although it is providing the rev
enue for a large part of the nation's current
effort to develop alternative energy
sources.
Welfare reform — Reagan already has a
group of business and professional experts
working on a plan to return most of the wel
fare funding and control to the states. He
shows no sign of backing down on his belief
that the states can do it better.
Clean Air Act — Reagan plans to listen to
his business-oriented task force as to what
changes should be made. He plans to be far
less active in this field than his predeces
sors.
Social Security, Medicare, unemploy
ment insurance, minimum wage — Reagan
is, by nature, not very keen for any of these
programs, but, politically, he finds it vir
tually impossible to talk about killing them.
So he would settle for what he considers
"improvements" as vet generally un
specified.
