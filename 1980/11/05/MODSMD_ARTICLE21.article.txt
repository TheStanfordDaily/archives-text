# New book emphasizes energy
## Hay den discusses issues 
### Joan O'Connell 
Tom Hayden speaks with a
kind of simmering intensity
about issues and ideas you know
he's thought about for a long
time.
Yet the former anti-war ac
tivist and political organizer,
currently on a 25-city book pro
motion tour for his latest work.
The American Future: New Vi
sions Beyond Old Frontiers,
also speaks with the tone of a
man who has come to some re
alizations.
He's as ideologically far to
the left as he was in the '60s as a
founder of Students for a Demo
cratic Society, as a civil rights
movement leader and as an au
thor who once wrote that he saw
"a power structure with such
vast wealth and weaponry that
it seemed beyond defeat."
But following an unsuccessful
Democratic party bid for the
Senate in 1976 and now looking
quite at ease in a tie and grey
flannel blazer. Hayden admits
that the country's problems are
"complex" to say the least.
No easy answers
"I can give short, simple an
swers for an article or during a
speech, but it's all actually very
complicated. I know that," he
mused.
Hayden's book provides a lit
tle deeper look into his politics.
Written as a series of essays on
the economy, health, power, a
global view and a strong em
phasis on energy — what
Hayden calls the "major issue"
in America today, it even con
tains charts captioned with tags
like "how inflation is driven by
an increasingly inaccessible oil
supply." It resembles the kind
of text which could turn up in an
introductory political science

course, although Hayden denied
that it is meant primarily for
college audiences.
Certainly the book's tone is a
bit softer than that of Hayden's
former works like Trial, written
following the Chicago "con
spiracy" trials. In response to
the often-asked question about
whether his political views have
softened, become more con
servative over the years, a re
ality perhaps reflected in the
book, Hayden would only say
"This book is like a photograph
of my mind as it was in June.
I'm already past this book The
books I wrote in the '60s were
photographs of my mind then.
I'm not the kind of writer who
pores over every word. I write
on the run "
'Gong show'
He said his book does not deal
with the 1980 election because
the "campaign does not deal
with the issues which should be
the focus of the election." like
solar energy and decentralized
corporate power.
Hayden called the presiden
tial debates between Jimmy
Cartel and Ronald Reagan a
"gong show" and while he sup
ports Carter. Hayden said he
could understand the reported
shift to the right by many voters
because "Ronald Reagan has a
kind of nostalgic strength in the
idea of cheap energy and an end
less frontier — by not having a
clear alternative. Reagan looks
stronger," he said.
However Hayden. who has
been a staunch supporter of Cal
ifornia Governor Jerry Brown,
said he really did not see anyone
at present who would make the
"ideal president." Innovation
has to come from the fringe and

change will only come when the
people want it.he said. "People
like Lincoln and Roosevelt were
probably not much stronger
than Jimmy Carter, but the
time had come for great
change. . . there was public
agreement." he said.
Support vital
"I watched Jimmy Carter
when he used to give his little
fireside chats in his sweater He
talked about the need to con
serve. etc. I realize that if I
were president. I could rail and
rant and it probably wouldn't go
anywhere." Hayden said, un
less the American people were
behind the change.
Hayden and his wife, actress
Jane Fonda, are both leaders of
a group they helped found in
1977: the Campaign for an Eco
nomic Democracy
(CED).California-based, the
group of political activists sup
port and lobby for solar energy
alternatives and decentralized
corporate power, among other
"progressive" issues. If Ronald
Reagan wins the presidential
election. Hayden said the CED
would probably be "on the line.
Ronald Reagan seems to think
we're dangerous because we
participate in the electoral
process." Hayden said. "I keep
saying out loud. President Re
agan. Governor Curb (in refer
ence to current California Lieu
tenant Governor Mike Curb),
and it hasn't quite sunk in," he
laughed.
And as for President
Brown Governor Hayden 9 "It
doesn't sound very realistic."
he said, adding that at this point
he has made no decisions re
garding his political future.

book, Hayden would only say
"This book is like a photograph
of my mind as it was in June.
I'm already past this book The
books I wrote in the '60s were
photographs of my mind then.
I'm not the kind of writer who
pores over every word. I write
on the run "
'Gong show'
He said his book does not deal
with the 1980 election because
the "campaign does not deal
with the issues which should be
the focus of the election." like
solar energy and decentralized
corporate power.
Hayden called the presiden
tial debates between Jimmy
Cartel and Ronald Reagan a
"gong show" and while he sup
ports Carter. Hayden said he
could understand the reported
shift to the right by many voters
because "Ronald Reagan has a
kind of nostalgic strength in the
idea of cheap energy and an end
less frontier — by not having a
clear alternative. Reagan looks
stronger," he said.
However Hayden. who has
been a staunch supporter of Cal
ifornia Governor Jerry Brown,
said he really did not see anyone
at present who would make the
"ideal president." Innovation
has to come from the fringe and

change will only come when the
people want it.he said. "People
like Lincoln and Roosevelt were
probably not much stronger
than Jimmy Carter, but the
time had come for great
change. . . there was public
agreement." he said.
Support vital
"I watched Jimmy Carter
when he used to give his little
fireside chats in his sweater He
talked about the need to con
serve. etc. I realize that if I
were president. I could rail and
rant and it probably wouldn't go
anywhere." Hayden said, un
less the American people were
behind the change.
Hayden and his wife, actress
Jane Fonda, are both leaders of
a group they helped found in
1977: the Campaign for an Eco
nomic Democracy
(CED).California-based, the
group of political activists sup
port and lobby for solar energy
alternatives and decentralized
corporate power, among other
"progressive" issues. If Ronald
Reagan wins the presidential
election. Hayden said the CED
would probably be "on the line.
Ronald Reagan seems to think
we're dangerous because we
participate in the electoral
process." Hayden said. "I keep
saying out loud. President Re
agan. Governor Curb (in refer
ence to current California Lieu
tenant Governor Mike Curb),
and it hasn't quite sunk in," he
laughed.
And as for President
Brown Governor Hayden 9 "It
doesn't sound very realistic."
he said, adding that at this point
he has made no decisions re
garding his political future.

Political activist Tom Hayden is currently on tour promoting his new book The Imerican Future: \eu-
I isions Hevond Our Old Frontiers.
Tom Hayden speaks with a
kind of simmering intensity
about issues and ideas you know
he's thought about for a long
time.
Yet the former anti-war ac
tivist and political organizer,
currently on a 25-city book pro
motion tour for his latest work.
The American Future: New Vi
sions Beyond Old Frontiers,
also speaks with the tone of a
man who has come to some re
alizations.
He's as ideologically far to
the left as he was in the '60s as a
founder of Students for a Demo
cratic Society, as a civil rights
movement leader and as an au
thor who once wrote that he saw
"a power structure with such
vast wealth and weaponry that
it seemed beyond defeat."
But following an unsuccessful
Democratic party bid for the
Senate in 1976 and now looking
quite at ease in a tie and grey
flannel blazer. Hayden admits
that the country's problems are
"complex" to say the least.
No easy answers
"I can give short, simple an
swers for an article or during a
speech, but it's all actually very
complicated. I know that," he
mused.
Hayden's book provides a lit
tle deeper look into his politics.
Written as a series of essays on
the economy, health, power, a
global view and a strong em
phasis on energy — what
Hayden calls the "major issue"
in America today, it even con
tains charts captioned with tags
like "how inflation is driven by
an increasingly inaccessible oil
supply." It resembles the kind
of text which could turn up in an
introductory political science

course, although Hayden denied
that it is meant primarily for
college audiences.
Certainly the book's tone is a
bit softer than that of Hayden's
former works like Trial, written
following the Chicago "con
spiracy" trials. In response to
the often-asked question about
whether his political views have
softened, become more con
servative over the years, a re
ality perhaps reflected in the
book, Hayden would only say
"This book is like a photograph
