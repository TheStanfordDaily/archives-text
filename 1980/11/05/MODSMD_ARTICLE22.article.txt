## Sugar pushes food prices up 
### Associated Press 
Grocery bills went up by almost half a percent last month,
with sugar prices leading the way. an Associated Press market
basket survey says
There also was bad news at the dairy counter, where butter
and egg prices increased, but coffee drinkers got some relief.
The AP drew up a random list of commonly purchased food
and non-food items and checked the price at one supermarket in
each of 13 cities on March 1.1973. Prices have been rechecked on
or about the start of each succeeding month
Among the highlights of the latest survey:
—The marketbasket bill rose during October at the checklist
store in six cities, up an average of 2 percent. and declined at the
checklist store in seven cities, down an average of nine-tenths of
a percent On an overall basis, the bill went up four-tenths of a
percent during the month
—When sugar was removed from the totals, the average mar
ketbasket bill showed a decline of 1.1 percent during October.
The price of a five-pound sack of sugar went up last month at the
checklist store in 11 cities. By the start of November, the aver
age price for five pounds of sugar was $2 84 — exactly double
what it was at the start of the year — and near the all-time record
set almost six years ago The price increases have been blamed
on rising worldwide demand, which has risen faster than prod
uction.
—The price of a pound of butter went up at the checklist store
in seven cities last month, while eggs increased in seven cities.
Coffee prices declined at the checklist store in five cities. The
change in retail coffee prices reflects, in part, recent drops at
the wholesale level, but overall trends are hard to predict since
many stores sell coffee at a loss in order to win customers.
—A comparison of prices today and at the start of the yer
showed the marketbasket total rose in every city, up an average
of 9 9 percent. Without sugar, the marketbasket bill went up an
average of 1.8 percent during the 10-month period.
The items on the AP checklist were: chopped chuck, center
cut pork chops, frozen orange juice concentrate, coffee, paper
towels, butter, Grade-A medium white eggs, creamy peanut but
ter, laundry detergent, fabric softener, tomato sauce, milk,
frankfurters and granulated sugar. The cities checked were:
Albuquerque. N.M.. Atlanta, Boston. Chicago. Dallas. Detroit.
Los Angeles. Miami. New York, Philadelphia, Providence, R. 1.,
Salt Lake City and Seattle.
