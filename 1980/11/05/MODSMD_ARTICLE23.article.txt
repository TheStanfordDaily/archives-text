# Supreme Court prepares agenda
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Here are
highlights of actions taken by
the Supreme Court Monday:
Refugees
The court cleared the way for
the transfer of Cuban and Hai
tian refugees from Florida to
Puerto Rico. The justices
turned down emergency re
quests to block the transfer
made by the Puerto Rican gov
ernment and a group of the is
land's residents. The Carter ad
ministration wants to transfer
as many as 2000 refugees to Fort
Allen in Puerto Rico and close
down a Dade County, Fla.,
camp.
The justices rejected Rep.

Michael Mvers' challenge to the
grand jury indictment that led
to his bribery conviction and ex
pulsion from Congress. Myers.
D-Pa . had contested the August
indictment in the FBl's
"Abscam" investigation con
tending that it was unconstitu
tional because it delved into
Mvers' legislative duties.
Elvis Posters
The court refused to bar any
one from selling Elvis Presley
memorabilia. Factors Etc.
argued that it had purchased ex
clusive right to sell Presley
items for $150,000 after the
singer's death in 1977. The court
let stand a ruling that Presley's
"exclusive right to publicity"

ended when he died and was not
inherited bv his heirs.
Antitrust liabilities
In a case with potentially
enormous impact on antitrust
law. the justices agreed to de
cide whether defendants in civil
antitrust cases can try to limit
their potential liability for darn
ages by distributing the blaine
for the alleged violations. A
New Orleans ready-mix con
crete maker is seeking to have
three other firms join it as co
defendants in as suit brought by
a construction company.
Medicaid
The court agreed to decide
whether individuals can dispose
of their assets for less than fair

value and still qualify for cer
tain types of Medicaid.
Prisons
The prison case before the
Court raises the question of
whether the "double-celling" of
inmates—confinement of two
prisoners in each cell--violates
the Eighth Amendment ban on
cruel and unusual punishment.
Handicapped
The rights of handicapped
students as set down in the Re
habilitation Act of 1973 will be
interpreted by the justices. The
vaguely worded law orders reci
pients of federal aid not to deny
help to "otherwise qualified"
individuals solely because of
their handicaps.
