# Business and government work together
## Coalition breathes new life into aging city 
### Los Angeles Times 
This is a story of two cities
whose fortunes for decades
were closely intertwined Yet
today one of them is managing
to make solid gains against
problems created by its declin
ing industries, while the other
has become a national cliche in
its inability to cope.
It is a tale that illustrates rad
ically different visions of what
the future holds for the aging
cities of America's industrial
heartland.
With the help of a powerful
coalition of government and
business, Pittsburgh is shedding
its dependence on the ailing
steel industry and remolding its
local economy to attract high
technology industries and high
income corporate managers.
Cleveland, on the other hand,
is paralyzed by a miasma of
problems associated with eco
nomic decline: ineffective polit
ical leadership, a disinterested
business community and sharp
ly competing local interest
groups.
"Pittsburgh seems to have
pulled itself up by the
bootstraps," said Ruben Met
tler. chairman of Cleveland
based TRW Inc. "I only wish we
could say the same for our

city."
Whether America's old in
dustrial cities can thrive in the
future will depend in large part,
most experts agree, on a myriad
of forces over which they exert
little or no control, such as de
mographic trends and global ec
onomic developments. But
these cities' ability to adapt will
also depend significantly on
people — local business ex
ecutives. government officials
and community representatives
— and the leadership that they
provide.
Clearly, both Pittsburgh and
Cleveland have suffered as for
eign competition, rising energy
prices and short-sighted man
agement have thrown the steel
and auto industries into their
worst slump since the Great De
pression.
But just a few miles from
closed-down steel mills, Pit
tsburgh's downtown is booming.
In August, construction began
on a 40-story glass office build
ing. More recently, ground was
broken on Oxford Towers, a 46-
story complex of luxury con
dominiums and corporate of
fices. U.S. Steel Corp., as part of
its effort to diversity into new
industries, soon will begin con
struction of a 50-story building

that will house some of the
city's largest corporations
Pittsburgh once was known as
a grimy agglomeration of mill
towns Now city boosters are
calling it"the San Francisco of
the East."
But while Pittsburgh appears
to be on the road to recovery.
Cleveland is a city waiting to be
rescued
It has a $111-million budget
deficit. It is just working itself
out of a disastrous 1978 default
— the first experienced by a ma
jor city since the Depression —
that left Cleveland without a
conventional means to borrow
money. It is plagued with broke.

second-rate public schools It
has a large inventory of crumbl
ing housing structures and now
is spending $1.5 million a year
just to tear down buildings. It
has neglected capital facilities
and is faced with repairs to its
bridges, sewers and water sys
tem that may cost more than
$700 million, according to a re
cent study by the Urban In
stitute. a private reserch group
in Washington.
When economists and busi
ness executives try to explain
the radically different fortunes
of these two cities, the dis
cussion always comes back to
one man Richard King Mellon

and the tremendous wealth and
power he wielded in Pittsburgh
From the 1940s until the late
19ft)s. Richard Mellon used the
family's economic clout to lead
Pittsburgh s transformation
from a choking, filthv steel town
into a comsrnopolitan corporate
center.
"He was a benign dictator, to
put it bluntly." TRW's Mettler
said.
Mellon and his allies in poli
tics and business were able to
force through decisions that —
whatever their other impact
helped keep Pittsburgh alive,
adaptable to changing economic
realities
