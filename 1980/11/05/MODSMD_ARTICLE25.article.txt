Washington 112 AP) — In a program modeled on
New Deal legislation, the Carter administration
is seeking to open the way for transportation co
operatives in rural America.
Agriculture Secretary Bob Bergland announced
approval last week of a pilot program to de
termine if farmers can he helped bv forming coop
erative ventures for transporting their goods. The
emphasis will be on adding truck and rail service
in rural communities that are suffering logjams.
"We'd like to improve the transportation in ru
ral areas adversely affected by recent closings of
railroad branch lines." said Bergland.
The administration will encourage state gov
ernments to propose experimental transportation
cooperatives by providing low-interest loans and
loan guarantees to get the pilot projects under
way.
The experiment will be modeled after the 45-
vear-old Rural Electrification Administration,
which was instrumental in providing thecapital to
bring electricity to the American hinterlands.
Nightmarish conditions
The Agriculture Department feels that many
midwestern farmers have encountered night
marish conditions in recent years in trying to
move their grain to market. Officials say the
problems range from rail car shortages, rail
abandonments, deteriorating roadbeds and
bridges and outdated waterway facilities to a gen
eral trend toward higher rates for poorer service.
(Jrain from Nebraska had been moving to the
(Julf of Mexico in single cars, a practice that the
cooperative groups say was wasteful because of
the long turnaround time.
The cooperative concept would permit small,
individual rail lines to be operated by shippers or
groups of users It is aimed primarily at the

Midwest.
Some cooperative efforts have already begun,
particularly in Nebraska, where three separate
groups of cooperatives have organized transpor
tation companies to buy and lease railroad cars.
Lending institutions
The Agriculture Department says the idea is
also gaining favor among lending institutions.
Robert Zuber. an official with the Omaha Bank
for Cooperatives, said the transportation dilem
ma "is critical to the bottom-line return and
future of agriculture We want to look at what co
operatives are facing down the road, at whatever
is taking place out there."
The bank has authorized a study that will cover
subjects ranging from transportation of phos
phates by cooperatives to possible congressional
regulations of railroads and trucks.
Private railroads deteriorate
The biggest problem, the Agriculture Depart
ment believes, is the worsening situation of
private railroads.
The department noted that the Interstate Com
merce Commission has been notified of proposed
abandonment of 20 percent of the track in lowa. 6
percent in Nebraska and 43 percent in South Dako
ta.
According to the department, railroads hauled
4.5 billion bushels of grain in 1978 and barges han
dled 1.6 billion bushels.
There are also continuing problems in barge
traffic, agriculture officials say.
They noted that the Mississippi River locks
reached capacity last year, with 63 million tons of
grain shipped through them. The volume is ex
pected to exceed capacity in the years ahead but
the expansion of the lock system won't be com
pleted for at least eight years.
