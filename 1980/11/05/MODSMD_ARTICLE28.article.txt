a four-year program. Approximately 10 Stanford
students are involved in the program each year,
according to Gloria Pvszka. placement director
at the Law School
Typically. students go to one year of law school,
spend the next year in business school, and then
take two years of combined coursework Applica
tion and admittance to each school are made sepa
rately
"It's a great program." says Douglas Carlisle,
now in his second year of the program. "It gives
variety from going to three years of law school."

According to Patricia Pobin, also in her third
year, many more first-year law students than
business students decide to obtain the combined

degree "For a law student, it's only one addi
tional year of school." she says, while a two-year
MBA student would face two additional years
Flexibility is the reason most often cited for
pursuing the double degree With a JD MBA it's
possible to practice law for a few years, then
move to business.
The JD MBA holders tend to be independent
types, according to Carlisle. "They are often pro
fessionals." he says.
"Many shy away from the large corporations in
favor of investment banking or management con
sulting They get into fields with a professional
client relationship, rather than being part of some
enormous organization," says Carlisle
The students have some complaints "Because
the Law School is on the semester system and the
Business School uses quarters, the academic year
runs from Sept 3 to June 10." says Fobin. "There
are no electives in the program."
Carlisle admits the program is "pretty tough.
The finals and midterm schedules are com
plicated." he says.
Currently, all courses are taught either by law
or business professors.
