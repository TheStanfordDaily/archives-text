## 
### Brad Crystal 
In a nip-and-tuck contest. Democrat
Tom Lantos last night appeared to
have won a narrow victory over in
cumbent Republican congressman
Bill Royer in the state's 11th con
gressional district.
With more than 92 percent of the
precincts counted, Lantos led Royer
by a margin of 76,810 (52 percent) to
73,999 (48 percent).
The 11th district extends from Daly
City in the north to Redwood City in
the south, and from Pacifica in the
west to San Mateo in the east.
Lantos. a senior professor of eco
nomics at San Francisco State Univer
sity since 1950, refused to claim vic
tory "until every vote had been
counted" according to press secretary
Jim Hamblin. although the outcome
was apparent by 11 p.m
The closeness of the race in an over
whelmingly Democratic district may
have resulted partly from a low eve
ning turnout.
Stay-at-homes
Observers say President Jimmy
Carter's concession speech, which
came more than one hour before the
state polls had closed, had theeffectof
keeping potential late voters away
from the polls.
"I think there is some physical
evidence to that effect," said
Hamblin.
At 11 30 last night, although victory
was assured, Hamblin said lantos

was ' 'not as happy as he should be."
"He wants to wait until there is a
firm and final figure," said Hamblin.
Adviser to Church, Biden
Lantos' prior political experience
includes serving as a senior economic
and foreign policy adviser to Senators
Joseph Biden (D-Md.) and Frank
Church (D-Id.).
