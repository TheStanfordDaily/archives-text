# While U.S. auto industry suffers, Japan's plants run full-speed
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — The manager of a major Japanese
auto plant complains about growing problems
dealing with the local union that represents
his work force.
"It's getting so no matter how small a thing
we want to do, it must be discussed in ad
vance. We don't do anything until we get an
okay from the union," he said.
That might sound almost funny to U.S. auto
factory executives. Most of them would glad
ly trade their labor relations problems for
those of the Japanese. In fact, they would be
grateful if more of their workers just showed
up At some U.S. assembly lines, an average
day sees 17 percent of the work force off the
job due to sickness, paid personal holidays or
simply failure to show No-shows alone
amount to about 4 percent of the payroll.
The comparable figures for Toyota and
Nissan. Japan's two biggest car producers,
range from 4 percent to 7 percent for all types
of absence and less than 1 percent for no
shows.
Cost differential
Such figures point up perhaps the most
noteworthy contrast between U.S. and
Japanese auto-production facilities. They are
enough to account for a significant cost dif
ferential between the two. But a tour of auto
plants in both countries turns up a number of
other contrasts, ranging from simple employ
ee relations to management's attitude toward
automating the production operations.
Comparing the efficiency of the two na
tions' auto industries is a complex task. To be
gin with, the U.S. companies generally make
more of their own parts, as many as 90 percent
in terms of the value of the car. The Japanese
figure is as low as 30 percent in some cases,
although the Japanese car companies do own
a share of many supplier firms. Thus it is not
possible to compare precisely the hours of la
bor that go into a vehicle.
Costs also are heavily influenced by the
level of business. A plant running close to ca
pacity. like those in Japan, turns out cars at a
considerably lower per unit cost than a plant
running at two-thirds speed, like many in
/ merica.
Cooperative attitude
What is clear is that the Japanese have
fostered a much more cooperative attitude
both with the unions and with the individual

workers, a disadvantage U.S. car companies
are finally begining to scramble to overcome
At the same time, the Japanese industry
has been more inclined to introduce labor-sav
ing equipment. Its growth and the consequent
need for new facilities have made this easier
than for the American companies, but the ex
penditures appear to be continuing as growth
shows signs of leveling off in Japan As the av
erage age of their work force increases, the
Japanese fear a decline in productivity unless
such expenditures are maintained.
Even at the Zama factory of Nissan Motor
Co., already among the most automated in the
world, more automation is likely to be in
troduced. "I still think we have too many peo
ple at the Zama plant," Takashi Ishihara,
Nissan president, said.
Robot assembly
Parts of the Zama operation appear
devoid of people. The line where the body
parts of Datsun cars are welded together, for
example, is 96.4 percent automated. Row
upon row of robots perform like a perfect mili
tary formation, snapping to attention as each
unfinished car body moves into position. The
arms of the various robots dart from one place
on the body to another, performing close to
2000 welds in all.
There is a debate among U.S. manufac
turers whether the $50,000-plus cost of each ro
bot is worth it, considering how often U.S.
cars are restvled and therefore how often the
robots must be replaced. But to the Japanese,
robots have the virtue of consistency, and of
performing tasks humans often find un
pleasant.
And there is one more factor: The Japanese
have the capital to purchase the equipment
while the slumping U.S. companies are far
more pressed for cash. Moroever, Japanese
tax laws provide for faster depreciation
writeoffs for such equipment, helping to gen
erate the cash needed to replace it.
Ironically, those robots at Zama were de
veloped by an American company.
Lack of investment hurts
Lack of investment in new facilities is hurt
ing the American car companies in other
ways. One U.S. plant manager says privately
that his company could improve the paint jobs
on new cars — and thus counter the high-quali
ty reputation being gained by the Japanese —

if funds were available to double the number
of painting facilities
"Our materials are every bit as good as
theirs." he explained, "but what they do is
split the assembly line" during the painting
process which enables them in effect to slow
down the line at that point and thus permit the
car to go through the painting facilities much
more slowly.
To the casual viewer, the final assembly
process in Japan and in the United States does
not appear much different Final assembly is
still largely a hand-labor proposition At
Toyota each worker on the line is assigned a
specific task and given perhaps 60 to 90 seconds
in which to perform it
At Nissan, however, the company has
chosen to man its line with fewer workers,
giving each about three minutes worth of
work per car At one point on the line, for in
stance. a single worker does much of the in
terior wiring of each vehicle Nissan believes
that makes the work more meaningful, and
thus encourages better workmanship
Nonmanagement supervision
Both Toyota and Nissan, however, have a
more basic system for insuring quality Most
U.S. producers operate with a supervisor for
each 20 workers That is true of the Japanese
factories as well The difference is the
Japanese have one more level of supervision
that they do not consider management.
Each group of six workers has what is
called a "hancho," or group leader, who helps
organize and assist the efforts of his group At
various points along the assembly line are
long tables and chairs where small groups can
meet to discuss their jobs, and make sugges
tions to management for streamlining them.
Worker involvement is encouraged in yet
another way. All along a Toyota assembly line
is an overhead cord much like the cord a bus
rider would use to signal the driver to stop.
When a worker believes something is not right
on the line, he can pull the cord and the line
will be stopped.
It is a kind of cooperation between worker
and management that is more difficult to de
velop in an American factory because labor
and management tend to operate as separate
interest groups. Some of that attitude is
changing, but it is light years from reaching
the Japanese level. Here, it is not unusual for

a young executive to be given a job on the un
ion bargaining team as part of his earlv train
ing
Wage rates below U.S.
Americans would scoff that Japanese un
ions are tied much too closely to man
agement And it is true that wage rates in the
industry here remain well below U.S. stan
dards
U.S. auto workers currently get about $10
an hour in cash wages and another $9 an hour
in fringe benefits.
In Japan, the workers collect a little more
than $8 an hour, including the semi-annual
bonus that they typically receive And despite
their widely publicized fringe benefits, inlud
ing company-subsidized housing for those who
want it. fringe-benefit costs are estimated at
only $2 an hour That seems low. although
what is seldom pointed out is that Japanese
workers receive no pension. Upon retirement,
they get a separation payment A 30-year man
at Nissan, for instance, would collect about
$50,000. or a little more than three year's pay
Workers with fewer years on the job would get
considerably less.
Six weeks vacation
Still, the Japanese workers are gaining
many of the other benefits of their American
counterparts, including the equivalent of
nearly six weeks of vacation time annually,
only a few days less than U.S. auto workers
There are substantial company recreation fa
cilities At one parts manufacturing plant not
far from Toyota, for instance, the company
president proudly displays a huge gymnasium
— larger than most U.S. high school gyms —
fully equipped with basketball nets and other
facilities for the company's employees.
One substantial benefit the Japanese work
ers enjoy that the Americans do not is a life
time employment agreement If business
slowed, the typical Japanese auto plant would
find make-work projects for its crews. Con
trast that with the thousands of U.S. auto
workers currently laid off. some with little
prospect of early recall.
Japanese labor relations, of course, have
been conditioned by the hardships that fol
lowed World War 11, and a strong sense of na
tional purpose to compete effectively in the
world. They are helped by a lack of racial ten

sions Despite a fairly tight labor market, the
.Japanese are loath to import foreign workers
who may disturb the homogeneity of Japanese
society
(One way to bolster their labor supply
would be to emplv more women But it is a
rare factory job that goes to a woman, in part
because of a national law that makes it illegal
to require women to work in factories at night.
In Japan, the entire production force, regard
less of seniority, typically alternate weekly be
tween the day and night shifts.)
Overseas factories
There are pressures on the Japanese to be
gin producing cars overseas rather than just
export them from Japan Nissan has agreed to
build a U.S. truck factory, and Honda is plan
ning an auto facility But Japanese leaders
openly admit to concern over trying to deal
with a U S work force, particularly a un
ionized one. although Japanese companies
like Sony that have built in the United States
have had good experiences
It would be wrong, of course, to conclude
that all is harmony in Japanese factories. The
plant manager's complaining about all the
checking he has to do with the union is one bit
of evidence. And a reporter's request to stop
and talk to some workers on the Nissan prod
uction line ultimately was turned down be
cause it was impossible to obtain permission
from the union that afternoon.
Still, absence, particularly absence without
notice, continues to be a problem at many U.S.
plants, and U S management and union lead
ers so far have not been very successful in at
tacking it.
Toyota concedes it had a problem for a
while, with no-shows as high as 2 percent. It no
longer has that problem Explains a top plant
official. "We made a list of the people in
volved and in the worst cases we pointed out to
them that they did not have the will to work
and so we guided them to quit." That's
Japanese for "we canned them."
If Americans need any more evidence of the
example the Japanese are setting for the rest
of the world, they need only see the hundreds
of foreign visitors that pour through some of
their plants each month In fact, along the as
sembly line at Zama are signs to tell the vis
itors what is going on at each station.
