# Should you trade in your gas guzzler now?
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Your 1976 Chevrolet Caprice has been a fine de
pendable car. but the big machine seems to drink
gasoline just sitting in the garage. The new Honda
and Escort ads with their promises of more than 40
miles per gallon have given you a bad case of new
car fever, and every day you wait, the aging Chevro
let loses a little more value as a trade in.
So should you buy a new car now? Or should you
just keep the gas guzzler until it falls apart?
Car owners have pondered these questions since
Alfred Sloan discovered in the mid-1920s that his
General Motors Corp. could make more money if it
convinced customers to buy a new car every few
years, whether they needed one or not.
The answer has always been the same: It de
pends. In the past, it depended on how much you
cared about impressing your neighbors. But now, it
also depends on how much you can afford to pay for
gasoline, and whether the savings with a high
mileage car will offset the cost of the new vehicle.
There is no single answer that applies to all car
owners. A student who drives a Mercury station
wagon only 3000 miles a year is spending far less on
gasoline than another driver who commutes 60
miles to work every day in a Datsun.
The cost of buying a new small car is affected by
the trade-in value of the old car as well as the in
tprest rate you have to pay on the loan. The decision
is even more complicated if you start to estimate
how much it will cost to keep your old car running
for a few more years, and how much you are willing
to risk a major breakdown of the old clunker on a
long trip.
Runzheimer and Co.. a management consulting
firm of Rochester. Wis., has developed data indicat
ing that getting rid of the gas guzzler may be a good
idea on purely economic grounds.
Runzheimer specializes in calculating business
travel costs for companies that operate fleets of
cars and need advice on when they should trade in
the cars for newer models. The calculations are
based on driving 20.000 miles annually â€” far more

than the average personally owned car goes each
year. But company officials say their figures do il
lustrate the potential savings for most drivers.
For example, Runzheimer calculates that a 1977
Chevrolet Impala will cost the owner $3944 to drive
another year. This breaks down to $1574 in fixed
costs (licensing, depreciation, financing and insur
ance) and $2370 in variable costs for 20,000 miles
(gasoline, tires, oil and maintenance).
The owner would save about $200 a year by trading
in the 1977 car for a smaller 1981 Chevrolet Citaton
or Dodge Aries, and Volkswagen Rabbit with a
diesel engine. The three small cars sell for about
$8000, and the main savings is due to the higher gas
mileage of the Rabbit.
The fixed annual cost of the Aries is $2184 and of
the Citation, $2164, both substanially higher than
that of the old Impala. mainly because the new cars
will depreciate quickly in the first few years. But the
variable cost of the car is $1590, about $800 a year
less than the Impala because the small cars get
about double the gas mileage of the bigger, eight
cylinder car.
The fixed annual cost for the Rabbit is about the
same. $2082, as the other small cars, but the variable
cost is only $1020.
Because most of the variable cost is the bill for
gasoline to operate the vehicle, it will fluctuate with
the number of miles you drive. Runzheimer officials
said that someone driving about 15,000 miles a year,
rather than the 20,000 used in the Runzheimer calcu
lations, will also save on fixed costs because the car
will not depreciate as quickly.
For example, at 15.000 miles a year, it will cost
about $3352 ($1574 fixed. $1778 variable) to operate
the 1977 Impala for another year. A new Chevrolet
Citation will cost $3057 a year ($1864 fixed. $1193 var
iable), or about a $300 a year less.
But the Runzheimer numbers are based on a
gasoline price of $1.60 a gallon (the price Run
zheimer estimates will be the average over the next
three years) and are geared to fleet operators who

routinely get rid of cars with thousands of miles still
left in them. The alternative of keeping the old car
for several more years is not considered.
Robert Chamberlain, a systems analyst at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, has developed
a mathematical formula to calculate how many
years you would have to drive a small car to make
the gasoline savings offset the cost of trading in the
old car. As in the Runzheioer data, the main vari
ables are the price of gasoline and the number of
miles you drive each year.
Kven with very high prices, it takes a long time
to save enough to make the purchase of the new car
worth it." said Chamberlain. He said he first de
veloped his formula driving to work one morning,
and trying to decide whether he should trade in his
old gas guzzler for a new car.
Chamberlain's formula (originally published in
Science magazine) is Y (RxMxC) divided by (D x
Pi. where Y is the number of years it would take of
driving to justify the purchase. R is the new car's
gas mileage, divided by the difference between the
gas mileage of the old and new car; Mis the old car's
mileage; C is the cost of the new car; D is the
number of miles you drive each year, and P is the
price of gasoline.
For example, if your present car gets 11 miles to
the gallon and the new one you want to buy gets 30;
the new car costs $8000; you drive 10.000 miles a year
and gasoline is $1 30 a gallon, then it would take 10.7
years of driving to justify the purchase, according to
Chambelain's formula.
In the formula. R would be 30 divided by (30 -11)
or 1.578. The formula would then read Y (1.578 x 11 x
$8000) divided by (10.000 x $1.30).
Neither of those methods of making a buy-or-keep
decision takes into account the value of your gas
guzzler, or the option of buying a slightly used car
rather than a new one. The resale values of cars get
ting less than about 15 miles per gallon havedropped
sharply in the last year, while used small cars have
held more more of their value.
