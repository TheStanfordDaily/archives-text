## Underneath all the muck, Trojans have another good team

Q: How many USC Tro
jans does it take to screw in a
light bulb 0
A: One, but eleven net
credit

It has been that kind of
autumn for the University of
Southern California's foot
ball team An excellent 6-0-1
record. No 4 nationally, and
a 27-game unbeaten streak
cannot hide the shame and
humiliation that the entire
school feels in having been
made a national laugh
ingstock

Commentary,

Last spring's in-house in
vestigations of scholastic
"irregularities'' at USC
were supposed to quell the
rumors — rumors that
branded the traditionally
monstrous Trojan football
team as something other
than God's gift to academia
The findings, released by
university president John
Zumberge last month, were
worse than expected The
school admitted that 330
academically lacking stu-

dents had been accepted in
the last 10 years primarily
for their athletic talents A
substantial number of these
players used their eligibility
and never graduated Nor
were they encouraged to do
so
This report comes in addi
tion to the discovery early
this year of bogus credits and
fake extension courses on
transcripts of several ath
letes. The Pacific-10 Con
ference's punishment for
USC — a one-year hiatus
from post-season bowl com
petition — seemed
astonishingly slight con
sidering the transgressions
For USC. the scandal goes
on and on Two weeks ago.
Sport> Illustrated assessed
the troubles at USC and re
named the school "The Uni
versity of Special Cases."
Lately, even former Trojan
athletes have taken the uni
versity to task While O.J
Simpson may be content with
never having received a USC
degree, many other ex-Tro
jan football players are pub
licly unhappy that they do not
have their diplomas.

Even the Los An#eles
Times got in on the act In an
editorial published shortly
after the school released the
report, the Times said. "It is
reprehensible to think this
could have gone on so long at
a major university which is
striving, as USC has been
doing for the last several
years, to build an academic
reputation that would match
its reputation on the football
field."
Perhaps the greatest irony
of this whole situation is that
underneath all the muck and
controversy at USC. there is
yet another terrific Trojan
football team on the loose
this season Only this is a
team playing in the shadows.
Academic issues — so often
in the background at USC
during football months — are
now front and center It is the
football team that must now
compete for attention
And as a national tele
vision audience will discover
Saturday afternoon — when
the Trojans invade sold-out
Stanford Stadium to battle
the Cards — this is a verv

good USC team.
Walk-on quarterback
Gordon Adams has done a
fine job orchestrating the
Trojan offense — which es
sentially means handing the
ball off the to the tailback
This year's star tailback,
junior Marcus Allen, has
done what is expected (his
154 3 rushing yards per game
average ranks him third na
tionally).
Adams also has a reliable
passel of receivers, the best
of whom is explosive Kevin
"Bug" Williams (25 TD ca
reer catches). A behemoth
offensive line led bv of
fensive linemen Roy Foster
and Keith Van Home liter
ally obliterates opponents.
Defensively, the Trojans
back up their sizeable front
wall with four All-America
candidates — linebackers
Riki Gray (inside) and Chip
Banks (outside) and safeties
Ronnie Lott and Dennis
Smith This crew (tops in the
Pac-10 in every defensive
category) hits like ax
murderers.
Clearlv Stanford is in for a

difficult afternoon The key
for the Cardinals to win the
game is to keep their defense
off the field USC's offensive
line poses unsolvable prob
lems for Paul Wiggin s
charges. Stanford's offense,
perhaps the best in the coun
try. must hold onto the ball
and force the Trojans to play
catch-up
When USC has the ball.
Stanford must somehow
manage to hold the Trojans
on first down If USC runs
wild (as UCLA did against
Stanford), it may be "Hello.
Sun Bowl" for the Cards
From USC's standpoint,
the only tricky aspect of the
game is holding down Stan
ford's offense When asked
how he would do it, USC head
coach .John Robinson said.
"It's easy. We'll put six guys
on (flanker Ken) Margerum,
three guys on (split end An
dre) Tyler, four on (halfback
Darrini Nelson, rush (quar
terback John) Elwav with
six. and put two on the light
end."
"Is that USC math?." a re
porter asked
The coach did not laugh.

athletes have taken the uni
versity to task While O.J
Simpson may be content with
never having received a USC
degree, many other ex-Tro
jan football players are pub
licly unhappy that they do not
have their diplomas.

Even the Los An#eles
Times got in on the act In an
editorial published shortly
after the school released the
report, the Times said. "It is
reprehensible to think this
could have gone on so long at
a major university which is
striving, as USC has been
doing for the last several
years, to build an academic
reputation that would match
its reputation on the football
field."
Perhaps the greatest irony
of this whole situation is that
underneath all the muck and
controversy at USC. there is
yet another terrific Trojan
football team on the loose
this season Only this is a
team playing in the shadows.
Academic issues — so often
in the background at USC
during football months — are
now front and center It is the
football team that must now
compete for attention
And as a national tele
vision audience will discover
Saturday afternoon — when
the Trojans invade sold-out
Stanford Stadium to battle
the Cards — this is a verv

good USC team.
Walk-on quarterback
Gordon Adams has done a
fine job orchestrating the
Trojan offense — which es
sentially means handing the
ball off the to the tailback
This year's star tailback,
junior Marcus Allen, has
done what is expected (his
154 3 rushing yards per game
average ranks him third na
tionally).
Adams also has a reliable
passel of receivers, the best
of whom is explosive Kevin
"Bug" Williams (25 TD ca
reer catches). A behemoth
offensive line led bv of
fensive linemen Roy Foster
and Keith Van Home liter
ally obliterates opponents.
Defensively, the Trojans
back up their sizeable front
wall with four All-America
candidates — linebackers
Riki Gray (inside) and Chip
Banks (outside) and safeties
Ronnie Lott and Dennis
Smith This crew (tops in the
Pac-10 in every defensive
category) hits like ax
murderers.
Clearlv Stanford is in for a

difficult afternoon The key
for the Cardinals to win the
game is to keep their defense
off the field USC's offensive
line poses unsolvable prob
lems for Paul Wiggin s
charges. Stanford's offense,
perhaps the best in the coun
try. must hold onto the ball
and force the Trojans to play
catch-up
When USC has the ball.
Stanford must somehow
manage to hold the Trojans
on first down If USC runs
wild (as UCLA did against
Stanford), it may be "Hello.
Sun Bowl" for the Cards
From USC's standpoint,
the only tricky aspect of the
game is holding down Stan
ford's offense When asked
how he would do it, USC head
coach .John Robinson said.
"It's easy. We'll put six guys
on (flanker Ken) Margerum,
three guys on (split end An
dre) Tyler, four on (halfback
Darrini Nelson, rush (quar
terback John) Elwav with
six. and put two on the light
end."
"Is that USC math?." a re
porter asked
The coach did not laugh.

Q: How many USC Tro
jans does it take to screw in a
light bulb 0
A: One, but eleven net
credit

It has been that kind of
autumn for the University of
Southern California's foot
ball team An excellent 6-0-1
record. No 4 nationally, and
a 27-game unbeaten streak
cannot hide the shame and
humiliation that the entire
school feels in having been
made a national laugh
ingstock

Commentary,

Last spring's in-house in
vestigations of scholastic
"irregularities'' at USC
were supposed to quell the
rumors — rumors that
branded the traditionally
monstrous Trojan football
team as something other
than God's gift to academia
The findings, released by
university president John
Zumberge last month, were
worse than expected The
school admitted that 330
academically lacking stu-

dents had been accepted in
the last 10 years primarily
for their athletic talents A
substantial number of these
players used their eligibility
and never graduated Nor
were they encouraged to do
so
This report comes in addi
tion to the discovery early
this year of bogus credits and
fake extension courses on
transcripts of several ath
letes. The Pacific-10 Con
ference's punishment for
USC — a one-year hiatus
from post-season bowl com
petition — seemed
astonishingly slight con
sidering the transgressions
For USC. the scandal goes
on and on Two weeks ago.
Sport> Illustrated assessed
the troubles at USC and re
named the school "The Uni
versity of Special Cases."
Lately, even former Trojan
athletes have taken the uni
versity to task While O.J

never having received a USC

licly unhappy that they do not
