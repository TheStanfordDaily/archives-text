# Sturm has Card spikers reaching for No. 1
## 
### Terry Vance 
There are two ways to assess
a team The easiest is to eval
uate its won-lost record, its con
ference standing and its na
tional reputation, assuming it is
lucky enough to have one.
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team has a 24-10 overall
record, it is second in the
Northern California Athletic
Conference, with a shot at the
top spot coming up next week,
and it is ranked 12th nationally
with an excellent chance at
reaching the top 10.
But there is another way to
study a team, a way that recog
nizes the numbers only in post
script. It looks at the past and
future of a team, not just its
present. Seen in this light, the
volleyball team's story be
comes much more interesting.
The women's team is in only
its fourth season. It is com
prised largely of freshmen and
sophomores with no dominant
players, and must compete in
the toughest region in the coun
try. When'it comes to recruit
ing, seven out of 10 prospects
can be scratched off the list in
deference to the admissions of
fice. It already sounds as if this
success story is degenerating
into another coach's nightmare.
Fred Sturm is not just anoth
er coach. He was here at the be
ginning as the assistant coach
for a team of walk-ons that won

the conference title. Following
that remarkable start, the team
stumbled for two years because
of stronger competition, gradu
ation and weak recruiting But
there was always Sturm's Stan
ford technique.
There is nothing mysterious
about the Stanford technique; it
is actually rather simple, fall
ing neatly into four parts. First,
the team must master the fun
damentals Second, a good vol
leyball team is highly or
ganized Third, individual skills
must be subservient to.team
play. Finally, there must be
communication on the floor. Af
ter stating these principles
Sturm added. "If we do these
things that we are supposed to
do. we can beat anybody. It's
important for the team to know
that."
Sturm makes this point often
and he makes it well. Big vic
tories are not important be
cause they improve rankings or
increase playoff chances. They
are important because they re
inforce the technique. Last
weekend, at UCLA's tour
nament, Stanford beat fifth
ranked San Diego State before
being eliminated by UCLA, the
tournament winner. Sturm saw
the victory in the light of his
longer-term goals,
"Now our team has some
thing to refer to in the matches
against the best opponents," he

said "When they are on the
floor against UCLA and USC
and ask themselves. 'How can
we beat them?', they will know
They will remember how they
beat San Diego State."
The technique is intended to
make Stanford a great team, not
just a very good one. The dif
ference is clear to Sturm. "A

great team wins matches
against teams with better re
cords," he said. "A good team
loses the 'could-have-won'

games but a great team wins
those games "
Under pressure. Sturm will
praise a few individuals, but in a
way that again reflects his team
goals. The only senior on the
squad, Sandy Harris, gave up
her preferred position as an out
side hitter to fill a gap at middle
blocker. Captain Jan Linden
provides the team with leader
ship and Chris Anderson is im
portant as a "stabilizing force"
in Sturm's words Fans may
whisper that Anderson really is
a star, but her coach will not.
Sturm is, however, quick to
praise his assistant Don Shaw, a
former professional player with
the San Jose Diablos of the now
defunct International Vol
leyball Association. Sturm said
Shaw "has been extremely im
portant" to the team's develop
ment and is respected by the
players.
Sturm himself played vol
leyball at UCLA, a perennial na
tional power, and is quick to re
mind the listener that only a few
years ago. everyone associated
volleyball with Memorial Day
picnics. He recalls a UCLA
trainer who laughed when
Sturm sought treatment for an
injured knee, saying that he
couldn't see how anyone could
get injured batting a ball over a
net. Sturm took the man to a

game and introduced him to the
spike, the dive, the roll and the
90-mph serve
While these things are still
not found in the backyard game,
they are no longer restricted to
the top college teams and are
now taught in some high
schools Shaw said, "Coaches
can't believe how teams have
improved None of the pitiful
volleyball of five years ago can
be found today."
The changes inspire Sturm,
whose recruits "come in with
better knowledge and fun
damentals." giving him the
chance to take his teams to even
higher levels of skill He now
has a very young team that is
poised to break into the top 10 It
plays second-ranked University
of the Pacific Tuesday for the
conference championship.
Sturm is aware of this, but
perhaps in the way a driver is
aware of the passing scenery. It
might be pretty out there, but
his attention is focused on a
more distant goal. The record
and ranking are fun for the fans,
but to Sturm, more important is
the special success this team
and its coaches are looking for.
It is too early to use the word
great when describing Stanford
women's volleyball, but it
should be kept handy. This team
is moving awfully fast.
