# Can Cards break USC 27-game skein?
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Coach
John Robinson of the fourth
ranked USC Trojans has devised
a unusual scheme to halt Stan
ford's explosive offense when
the two Pacific-10 Conference
foes meet Saturday in Palo Alto.
The only thing is. it takes
more than 11 players on the field
at once to put it into effect
Though Robinson suggested
tongue-in-cheek that his team
would need more than the usual
number to stop Stanford, he be
came serious when assessing
the Cardinals' offense.
"Stanford has the finest col
lection of offensive talent that
I've seen since I've been here,"
the Trojan coach said yesterday
at his weekly meeting with re
porters
"They have a big offensive
line, a pair of fine receivers in
(Andre) Tyler and (Ken)
Margerum. a great back in

(Darri.ii) Nelson and (John)
El way is a Roger Staubach-type
quarterback "
Last year, the Cardinals
rallied from a 21-ohalftimedefi
cit to tie the Trojans 21-21. prob
ably knocking Southern Cal out
of the 1979 national cham
pionship
The Trojans. 6-0-1, can re
write a 47-year-old school stan
dard if they run their unbeaten
string to 28 games Saturday.
Ironically, the Howard Jones
coached Trojans had their 27-
game undefeated string ended
bv Stanford in 1933.
Robinson, for one. is looking
forward to the 1980 edition of the
series that began in 1905.
"It's going to be a great
game." he said. "I think these
two schools have played in
teresting and exciting football
against each other through the
years."
