# Student reactions mixed as landslide spoils suspense
## 
### Elizabeth Budd Samuel Howe 
A large electoral scoreboard in
Branner Hall told the whole story
last night By 8 o'clock,
scorekeepers had run out of red
lightbulbs to indicate states won by
Ronald Reagan Apparently, no
one had expected such a landslide
Across campus, the mood was
not just one of surprise that the
former California governor had
won so commandinglv. but disap
pointment that the results had
come in so early, and that Presi
dent Jimmy Carter had conceded
defeat bv 7 p.m.
Many had been looking forward
to a long night and a cliffhanger
election, but were denied the
chance to experience it However,
the U.S. Senate elections and the
results of state and local elections
did continue to hold student in

terest
"The shift in control of the sen
ate is as important if not more than
the presidential election," said
John Schmidt, who was visiting
Branner's election extravaganza
Meanwhile, as 3500 students in
Berkeley were holding a similar
rally some 250 students gathered in
White Plaza at an "Election Rejec
tion" rally later in the evening to
express "general dissatisfaction
with the choices we were presented
with." according to law student
Jim Speyer. a member of Stan
ford's Progressive Alliance and an
organizer of the rally.
'Reactionary forces'
Education Prof Martin Camoy
urged the audience to be vigilant of
"reactionary forces" which he said
have "continued to build during
this decade, as we sat waiting for a
leader to'comeoutof the woodwork

and show us the way We're the
ones who are going to have to de
fine the way" to protect justice and
fight oppression around the world
Students in Branner organized
an "election extravaganza" com
plete with large screen television
and "endless amounts of food." ac
cording to organizers, but the land
slide victory did take the suspense
out of the occasion
Some students, of course, were
pleased with the results, and one
student charged that there "are
many, many closet Reaganites" on
this campus who were likewise
pleased but not willing to admit it
because of the negative image
which many here hold of the man
Decisive victory
Marianne Bverwalter. an RA in
Branner and a Reagan supporter,
said, "I'm thrilled to see such a vic
tory after working for Reagan for

the past six months I think his de
cisive victory will help Reagan in
governing: I think Carter's early
concession took away a lot of ex
citement from the election I no
longer feel alone in my belief that
the United States needs con
servative economic and interna
tional policies."
Mark Wicker, chair of the Stan
ford Students for Reagan, echoed
her comments: "I was really sur
prised I figured he'd win, but not
by that much."
Brad Crystal, director of the
campus Carter-Mondale commit
tee. said he was "very disappointed
at the outcome We are especially
concerned about losses in the Sen
ate They represent a distressing
conservative trend, which we hope
can be reversed as soon as pos
sible."
Anderson
Claire Duncan, a Branner frosh
and Anderson supporter, said she
was "surprised at such a massacre
on the part of Carter. I was also
hoping Anderson would do better —
it's too bad America is just a two
party country."
Athletics Dept. director Andy
Geiger. hosting an election party
for residents in the Cowell Cluster,
said that students seemed in gener
al to be incredulous of the margin
which Reagan had amassed. Al
though Geiger said he would not
comment on last night's election,
he did predict that the Stanford
football team would win "by 51 to
44 percent" against USC this week
end.
The White Plaza rally included
two short candlelight marches
around campus which were high
lighted by chants of "Carter! Re
agan! Hear our voice! We deserve
a better choice!"
Apathetics
Lyle Zimmerman, a student at
the rally, said that Reagan's elec
tion "may be the best thing. After
the next four years, the apathetics
of this country may get out and
vote."
Organizer Speyer said that the
rally was called "especially lo pro
test the election of Reagan. The

fundamental interests of women
and of minorities have been and
will be ignored by Reagan. More
than that, they have been worked
against."
Another election reception was
held at the American Studies House
where, again, most people seemed
disappointed by the fact that the re
sults had come in so early. "It real
ly split up our party," said one Re
agan supporter there.
According to Mark Breier. RA in
the house, the party was "good be
cause it was casual." Breier said
that several professors and deans
had stopped by the house to ex
change reactions with the students.
"That's what college life is all
about: being able to talk easily
about what is happening," he said.
Early studying
Some students did not spend all
night in front of the television
watching the elecion coverage, and

returned to the libraries early. Sen
ior Jeffrey Kirkpatrick. an RA in
Burbank said he was at LOTS, the
campus computer facility, by
10:30. and said "Who gives a damn
about the president! All I want to
do is get my program done." On a
more serious note. Kirkpatrick ex
plained that he voted for Reagan
because "Carter has proven
himself inept. I support Reagan's
philosophy of keeping money in the
hands of local government, not the
federal government."
Some 3500 students at Berkeley
took to the streets last night to pro
test Reagan's election. The stu
dents marched up Telegraph Ave
nue chanting "Down with Reagan"
and "Reagan Has To Go."
Berkeley police officer Ernest
Montez said the rally was "loud
and rowdy," but no damage or in
juries were reported.

election of former governor Ronald Reagan. The "election rejection" demonstration included speeches and a
candlelight march.
