Iraq avows continuing strength
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said
yesterday night that Iraq was both "prepared" and
"equipped" for a long drawn out war "eternity" and
reiterated that his nation would not give up the fight
with his OPEC neighbor until it won total recog
nition for all its claims against Iran.
The Iraqi president, speaking for the first time on
the 7-we-k-old war in more than a month, vowed,
however, that from the moment Tehran agreed to
accept Iraq's "just demands" he would order Iraqi
troops to withdraw from Iran.
Hussein said in his one hour and 20-minute speech
before Iraq's consultative national assembly.
"There is talk that a shortageof spare parts will bea
factor, but Iraq has been building up its stocks for 13
years and we have enough spare parts to continue
the war for a long time."
"If (Ayatollah) Khomeini wants to continue the
war, he can continue it until eternity." Saddam
Hussein said. "But he has to know that war imposes
its own demands, which are greater than those that
existed before the war."
The Iraqi president, alluding to the estimated $35
billion in reserves economists estimate Iraq has
banked away, said Iraq was "economically strong"
enough to fight a "long war " His government's cen
tral bank governor three weeks ago predicted that
Iraq could fight two more years without earning an
other dollar in foreign exchange if need be.
On the war front, meanwhile, both sides seemed
to remain stalemated Iranian forces continued to
press their attack on the besieged port of Khor
ramshahr and the oil complex of Abadan. which
have been surrounded and under siege for the past
several weeks.
Iran marks one year of hostages
Tehran, Iran — A huge rally was held here yester
day, one year after the occupation of the U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran, to demonstrate that whether or not

the embassy hostages are freed, the fight against
"U.S. imperialism" goes on.
The mass demonstration, which might have
drawn as many as one million people, converged on
the former embassy, located in central Tehran,
which now is viewed as a symbol of Iran's struggle
for independence.
Militant students, who last year stormed the em
bassy and have held it ever since, yesterday threw
open the gates to the general public for what was
termed an "anniversary celebration."
While many of the banners and slogans pro
claimed "Death to America"and the "U.S. Get
Your Bloody Hands Off Iran." there was no mention
of the 52 hostages.
The militants claim to have dispersed the
hostages following last April's aborted U.S. rescue
attempt. Monday, they officially asked the govern
ment to take over responsibility for their captives
now that Parliament has set out conditions for their
release.
Effigies of "Uncle Sam" and Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein were jeered and swiped at by the
crowd, which also burned a few American flags.
US slow on Iran hostage terms
Washington — Despite Iranian demands for a
quick response in "the media" to Tehran's condi
tions for release of the 52 U.S. hostages, the State
Department refused yesterday to be stampeded into
a hasty reply through the press.
The department said the United States would rely
on "deliberate" negotiation through diplomatic
channels.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said that the Alger
ian ambassador. Redha Malek. acting as designated
intermediary, had been asked to request the U.S. re
sponse to Tehran's conditions as soon as possible
"anti they should notify the peoples of the world
through the mass media of this matter."
State Department spokesman John Trattner,
meanwhile, declared that the United States does not

consider the four-point list of Iranian conditions "an
ultimatum" and repeated the standing U.S. view
that negotiations would be necessary.
In Maine, where he flew early Tuesday to vote,
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie repeated his
view that "clarifications" of the Iranian demands
would have to be sought and received before nego
tiations could proceed.
In the version delivered Monday by Malek, those
demands remained as previously stated: a U.S.
pledge to refrain from interference in Iranian af
fairs; the freeing of frozen Iranian assets; the aban
donment of all U.S. claims against Iran, public and
private: and a U.S. government decree leading to
"restoration and reimbursement of all the proper
ties of the deceased Shah."
Charles Manson denied parole
Vacaville — A defiant Charles Manson, who ad
mitted he was still dangerous, was denied parole
yesterday by the state Board of Prison Terms,
which cited the mass killer's "long history of in
stability and criminality."
To board suggestions on how Manson, convicted of
the 1969 Tate-Laßianca murders, might improve
himself before his next parole hearing in 1981, Man
son said. "I'm not going to do that ... I'll stay here
forever ... I've got that long."
He made the statement to reporters outside the
hearing room after the board came to a decision at
the close of a 2Mz-hour session at Vacaville Medical
Facility, a state prison four miles east of San Fran
cisco.
Today's weather
Fair and hazy this morning. Increasing high
clouds and a little cooler later. Extensive high
clouds tonight then fair and sunny tomorrow. Lows
in the 40s. Highs in the 70s to low 80s today and in the
70s tomorrow. Light winds.

Iraq avows continuing strength
Baghdad, Iraq — President Saddam Hussein said
yesterday night that Iraq was both "prepared" and
"equipped" for a long drawn out war "eternity" and
reiterated that his nation would not give up the fight
with his OPEC neighbor until it won total recog
nition for all its claims against Iran.
The Iraqi president, speaking for the first time on
the 7-we-k-old war in more than a month, vowed,
however, that from the moment Tehran agreed to
accept Iraq's "just demands" he would order Iraqi
troops to withdraw from Iran.
Hussein said in his one hour and 20-minute speech
before Iraq's consultative national assembly.
"There is talk that a shortageof spare parts will bea
factor, but Iraq has been building up its stocks for 13
years and we have enough spare parts to continue
the war for a long time."
"If (Ayatollah) Khomeini wants to continue the
war, he can continue it until eternity." Saddam
Hussein said. "But he has to know that war imposes
its own demands, which are greater than those that
existed before the war."
The Iraqi president, alluding to the estimated $35
billion in reserves economists estimate Iraq has
banked away, said Iraq was "economically strong"
enough to fight a "long war " His government's cen
tral bank governor three weeks ago predicted that
Iraq could fight two more years without earning an
other dollar in foreign exchange if need be.
On the war front, meanwhile, both sides seemed
to remain stalemated Iranian forces continued to
press their attack on the besieged port of Khor
ramshahr and the oil complex of Abadan. which
have been surrounded and under siege for the past
several weeks.
Iran marks one year of hostages
Tehran, Iran — A huge rally was held here yester
day, one year after the occupation of the U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran, to demonstrate that whether or not

the embassy hostages are freed, the fight against
"U.S. imperialism" goes on.
The mass demonstration, which might have
drawn as many as one million people, converged on
the former embassy, located in central Tehran,
which now is viewed as a symbol of Iran's struggle
for independence.
Militant students, who last year stormed the em
bassy and have held it ever since, yesterday threw
open the gates to the general public for what was
termed an "anniversary celebration."
While many of the banners and slogans pro
claimed "Death to America"and the "U.S. Get
Your Bloody Hands Off Iran." there was no mention
of the 52 hostages.
The militants claim to have dispersed the
hostages following last April's aborted U.S. rescue
attempt. Monday, they officially asked the govern
ment to take over responsibility for their captives
now that Parliament has set out conditions for their
release.
Effigies of "Uncle Sam" and Iraqi President Sad
dam Hussein were jeered and swiped at by the
crowd, which also burned a few American flags.
US slow on Iran hostage terms
Washington — Despite Iranian demands for a
quick response in "the media" to Tehran's condi
tions for release of the 52 U.S. hostages, the State
Department refused yesterday to be stampeded into
a hasty reply through the press.
The department said the United States would rely
on "deliberate" negotiation through diplomatic
channels.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry said that the Alger
ian ambassador. Redha Malek. acting as designated
intermediary, had been asked to request the U.S. re
sponse to Tehran's conditions as soon as possible
"anti they should notify the peoples of the world
through the mass media of this matter."
State Department spokesman John Trattner,
meanwhile, declared that the United States does not

consider the four-point list of Iranian conditions "an
ultimatum" and repeated the standing U.S. view
that negotiations would be necessary.
In Maine, where he flew early Tuesday to vote,
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie repeated his
view that "clarifications" of the Iranian demands
would have to be sought and received before nego
tiations could proceed.
In the version delivered Monday by Malek, those
demands remained as previously stated: a U.S.
pledge to refrain from interference in Iranian af
fairs; the freeing of frozen Iranian assets; the aban
donment of all U.S. claims against Iran, public and
private: and a U.S. government decree leading to
"restoration and reimbursement of all the proper
ties of the deceased Shah."
