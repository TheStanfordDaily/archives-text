### Samuel Howe 
Incumbent Congressman Pete Me-
Closkev (R-Menlo Park) rolled to
reelection to a seventh term last
night, capturing more than 70percent
of the total vote.
McCloskev defeated three other
candidates in the 12th congressional
district, which includes Stanford.
But he celebrated his victory away
from the district, in Los Angeles at the
Century Plaza Hotel with President
elect Ronald Reagan and other Re
publicans
With 386 out of 486 precincts in the
district reporting as of 3 o'clock this
morning. McCloskev had captured
109 689 votes for 72 percent of the to
tal. Democratic candidate Kirsten
Olsen. with 27.487 votes and 17
percent, was challenged by Liber
tarian Bill Evers, who garnered 12.149
votes and approximately 9 percent of
the total
However. Evers defeated Olsen in
the areas of the district which lie
within San Mateo County, including
the cities of East Palo Alto. Menlo
Park, Atherton and towns to the west.
In San Mateo County, with all 137
precincts reporting, Evers captured
5975 votes (15 percent) to Olsen's 5489
(13.8 percent). And the precincts not
reporting from Santa Clara County
were in the north, including Stanford
and parts of Palo Alto, where the Lib
ertarian candidate campaigned heav
il.v.
Peace and Freedom party can
didate Adele Fumino had captured
2301 of the total votes cast, or approx
imately 2 percent.
McCloskey. a graduate of the Stan
ford Law School, was not available for
comment at the election party in
southern California. Many have
charged that he endorsed the election
of Reagan, of whom he has been
critical in the past, to gain favor with
the Republicans whose support he
would seek in a run for the United
States Senate in 1982. McCloskey has
said that he has not decided if he will
make that attempt. .

Evers. a Stanford graduate, said
that he was pleased with his per
formance. although he said that it
would be "very nice to hit double
digits" in his percentage of the vote, a
goal that it appeared he would not at
tain as of this writing. He did say that
he had polled the highest of any Liber
tarian in a 3- or more person race in
northern California, and he called his
showing "respectable."
Olsen said she was not disappointed
to lose, but was surprised that Evers
had mounted such a strong challenge
to her. She attributed his success to a
particularly vigorous campaign, and
also blamed her poor showing in part
to President Jimmy Carter's decision
to concede defeat by 7 p.m PST. more
than an hour before the polls closed.
She called the President's act "really
terrible."
Asked if she would try again for the
seat in 1982, Olsen said "Probably,
yes."
