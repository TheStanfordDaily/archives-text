Los Angeles — Ku Klux Klan leader
Tom Metzger went down to an over
whelming defeat in his bid for a con
gressional seat yesterday as Re
publicans threatened to take control of
California's House delegation for the
first time in 22 years.
Rep. Clair Burgener (R-La Jolla)
trounced Democrat Metzger to win a
sixth term in the lower house. With 17
percent of the precincts reporting,
Burgener led 84 to 16 percent.
But Metzger said he did not think
the vote was a repudiation of his cam
paign. "Not when you take into ac
count the tremendous amount of heat
that was put on me." he said.
"I am not disappointed. I am a polit
ical realist," he added, vowing to con
tinue his political efforts with a com
mittee to raise funds for candidates
who support his views.
Meanwhile, eight Democratic in
cumbents were locked in tight races or
losing as Republicans tried to win a
majority of California delegation to
the House of Representatives for the
first time since 1958.
Democrats have a 25-18 edge in the
delegation now, but the GOP was hop
ing to pick up at least four seats.
In a key Northern California race,
Rep. Harold "Bizz" Johnson (D-Rose
ville) was going down to defeat to As
semblyman Eugene Chappie (R-Rose
ville) in the huge Ist District.
Rep. John Burton (D-San Francis
co) was losing narrowly to Republican
Dennis McQuaid as early returns
poured in from another key race, and
two Oakland Democrats, Reps. Ron

Dellums and Fortnev Stark, were also
in tight races.
In Southern California, Reps. Jim
Lloyd (D-West Covina) George Brown
Jr. (D-Riverside) Lionel Van Deerlin
(D-Chula Vista) and James Cor man
(D-Van Nuvs) were fighting for their
political lives.
In another key race that Democrats
were hoping to win. state Sen. Bob
Wilson (D-La Mesa) was losing to San
Diego Deputy Mayor Bill Lowery in
early returns.
Former Lt. Gov. Mervyn Dymally,
trying for a political comeback after
losing his state post, was leading Re
publican Don Grimshaw with 59
percent of the vote. He was seeking
the seat of outgoing Rep. Charles
Wilson (D-Hawthorne).
Corman was • facing Los Angeles
school board member Bobbi Fiedler in
a race with busing as the major issue.
Dymally. the first black elected to
the state's No. 2 post, was defeated by
Republican Lt. Gov. Mike Curb in
1978. Dymally then beat Wilson and
former Rep. Mark Hannaford in the
June primary.
Wilson was censured by the House
in June for converting campaign funds
to his own use and for accepting mon
ey from a man with a direct interest in
legislation before Congress.
Metzger, a Fallbrook television re
pairman and the leader of a Klan fac
tion, startled politicians statewide
when won the Democratic primary.
Most Democratic leaders promptly
endorsed Burgener, a five-term veter
an whose district stretches from San
Diego County to Arizona.
