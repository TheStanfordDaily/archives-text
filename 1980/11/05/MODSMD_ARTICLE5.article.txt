# Sher defeats Morris in Assembly bid
## 
### David Frank 
Stanford Law School Professor Byron Sher coasted to
victory in his bid for State Assembly in the 21st District.
Early this morning, Sher, a Democrat, had ac
cumulated some 55 percent of the vote, compared to the 38
percent of his Republican opponent. Greg Morris, and the
7 percent of Libertarian candidate. Chuck Olson.
Sher said he was somewhat suprised at President Jim
my Carter's early evening concession of the presidential
race. "Obviously, I would have preferred that he held off
until the polls were closed on the West Coast. It (the con
cession ) might have kept some voters away. But it seems
like it hasn't had any affect on my race."
The campaign had been a bitter one at times. In the
earlier stages, Morris issued campaign literature address
ing environmentalists who supported Sher. In it, Morris
condemned Sher for owning stock in oil companies, seeing
this and Sher's support of environmental issues as incom
patible.
Sher responded by saying that he had publicly disclosed
these investments annually since 1974 The local Sierra
Club chapter acknowledged Sher's response and has since
declared that they do not find his investments and environ
mental beliefs at odds.
Nonetheless, at the top of Sher's campaign concerns
were environmental issues: energy conservation and safe
guarding the environment. Indeed, his experience has re
flected concerns for these issues. Sher has been an out
spoken opponent of development of the Palo Alto foothills
and the Bavlands.
As well, he vehemently opposes the construction of the
Peripheral Canal, a structure that would help transfer wa
ter from Northern California area to Southern California.
Sher has personally submitted 75,000 Santa Clara County
signatures calling for a public referendum on the canal

bill.
In addition to environmental concerns. Sher has
stressed ones for consumer affairs, the field in which he
specializes at the Law School.
On other election issues. Sher — currently the-vice
mayor of the Palo Alto City Council — supported the con
troversial County Ballot Measure C — which opposed res
urrection of a peacetime military draft The measure was
trounced at the polls yesterday, however. Libertarian
Olson expressed disappointment for the electorate's re
jection of Measure C. "I am very disappointed. I am
adamentlv opposed to any draft. It's the draft that made
Vietnam.'' he said late last night.
However, the Stanford molecular biology graduate stu
dent said he was pleased at his overall showing "Con
sidering the limits on my time," he said. "I did well."
"I ran a traditional campaign, with lots of going door-to
door and meeting the people in the community. I tried to
let people know what was happening And they seemed to
listen.'' Olson told the Daily in a telephone interview last
night.
Candidate Morris could not be reached for comment last
night.
Elsewhere in the state. Republicans were leading in
many vacant Assembly and Senate seats in legislative
election returns last night, indicating possible slight gains
by the minority party in both chambers
Specifically. Democratic candidates supporting As
sembly Speaker Leo McCarthy in his speakership battle
with Howard Berman were in trouble in a half dozen dis
tricts. Those favoring Berman were doing slightly better.
In general, the GOP candidates were echoing their par
ty's nationwide success and Republican incumbents who
had faced well-financed challengers appeared to be pulling
through
