# Last-minute hostage break hurt Carter in final campaign days
## 
### Washington Post 
In the end, as President Carter's
strategists saw it.it was Jimmy
Carter who was done in by the "Octo
ber surprise'' from Iran
It was not Ronald Reagan, whose
advisers had once feared that a last
minute hostage break would be their
political undoing Reagan wound up
instead as the beneficiary of adramat
ic shift in traditionally Democratic
blocs — among them, labor union
members and Jews who voted for Re
agan in large numbers, and many oth
er Democrats who decided to stay
home and not vote at all
And so the election that most public
polls had called very close through the
final weekend of the campaign turned
out to be an electoral landslide for the
Republican nominee
It was a result that stunned many of
tie president's top echelon of ad
* isers. but not those of the Reagan
(amp. The Republican nominee's
pollsters had been saying ever since
the climactic presidential debate one
week ago that the race was no longer

close That debate, according to Re
agan pollsters Richard Wirthlin and
Robert Teeter, enabled Reagan to
open up a lead of five to seven percent.
Reagan maintained that lead and
watched it grow steadily, they said,
with only a mild boost from the late
breaking events in Iran
As Carter's polling expert, Patrick
Caddell. analyzed the last days of the
campaign for his boss and campaign
colleagues, the president had drawn
even with Reagan by late Saturday
night. In fact. Carter actually held a
slight, fractional lead at that point,
Caddell's figures showed As Caddell
later analyzed it. there was very little
change in the actual attitudes of the
public toward Carter and Reagan
themselves. The four-percentage
point boost that Reagan had received
from the Tuesday night presidential
debate had evaporated
U.S. image drops
But on Sunday, after the Iranian
leaders made public their new condi
tions for the release of the hostages,
the bottom fell out of the president's

re-election prospects As Caddell later
analyzed it. there was very little
change in the actual attitudes of the
public toward Carter and Reagan
themselves But there was a sharp, 10
percent drop on the question of how
voters viewed the U S position in the
world
"Iran came to represent the whole
set of enormous frustrations that were
being voted on." said one of Carter's
most senior strategists From dead
even on Saturday night, Reagan
soared to a 10 point lead by 1 a.m.
Tuesday, according to the Caddell sur
veys Never before. Caddell said, had
an election moved so sharply in the
last hours of a campaign.
"No way." countered Reagan's
pollster. Richard Wirthlin. "That's
just not true."
Wirthlin's own surveys showed Re
agan opening a quick lead after the de
bate. a lead which he says was never
relinquished, but in fact grew steadily
to landslide proportions. On Oct. 30,
Reagan's lead was seven points, ac
cording to Wirthlin It was nine points

Friday. 10 points Saturday. 11 points
Sunday, and was holding at 11 points,
with another 12 percent undecided on
Monday.
The debate. Wirthlin said, erased
all the doubts about Reagan's charac
ter and competence, doubts which the
Democratic campaign had worked so
hard to develop. Once those anxieties
were gone, voters were eager to vote
against Carter because of the econo
my and other failings of his first term.
Party betrayed
Regardless of how Americans got
there, by election day, Democrats had
moved in significant numbers to sup
port the conservative Republican.
Reagan wound up winning a majori
ty of the votes of the labor union mem
bers, according to polling done by the
television networks as voters were
leaving the polls. Reagan won about
half of the votes of Jews, who had
voted overwhelmingly for Carter four
years ago. Reagan also won the votes
of more Catholics than did Carter, al
though by a relatively narrow margin.
And Reagan carried the Protestant
vote by almost two to one.
The defections from the traditional
Democratic ranks were wide and
deep. Not only did Carter lose large
numbers of voters who call them
selves liberals to independent John
Anderson, but in Ohio, for example,
fully one third of those who said they
were liberals also said they had voted
for the conservative Reagan.
Perhaps every bit as decisive to the
election's outcome was the fact that
large numbers of Democrats also de
cided not to vote at all. According to
projections, voter turnout declined in
1980 to just about 50 percent of the
adult population, compared to the 54
percent turnout in 1976. Of those who
did vote, about 40 percent were Demo
crats. 29 percent Republicans and 29
percent independents — which meant
that Republicans had become a
greater proportion of those voting
than at any time in recent history. In
recent years. Republicans have made
up only 23 percent of the voting popu
lation.
Of those traditionally Democratic
voting blocs. Carter held his own only
among the minorities, especially
blacks and Hispanics. The turnout
among black voters was estimated by
some polling experts to have been
about the same as in years past and a
spot survey by the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People showed that the black turnout
had actually increased by 10 percent.
Carter won 80 to 90 percent of the
black vote, according to exit polling by

television networks. Reagan won
about three fourths of the remaining
votes.
Realignment prospects
Last summer, Republicans had
talked optimistically about the pros
pect of a realignment of the American
electorate, a breaking up of that coali
tion of blue collar workers and minor
ities that had been largely responsible
for making the Democrats the majori
ty party for most of the years of the
last five decades.
Tuesday night. Reagan pollsters
Wirthlin and Teeter were not contend
ing that any fundamental realignment
had taken place. "But it could be the
beginning," said Wirthlin. "We suc
ceeded in our prime objective of
breaking up the coalition which had
voted for Carter four years ago."
Douglas Fraser, president of the po
litically powerful and liberal United

Auto Workers, spoke unhappily of the
fate that had befallen the Democratic
party. Thirty percent of his union's
members were unemployed at this
time, as the 62-year-old Fraser ob
served:
"People of my generation have been
running against Herbert Hoover since
1932. And now. in 1980. we find they
have the issues and we don't."
Frustration realized
In the last weekend of the 1980 presi
dential campaign, it was true that the
ayatollahs in Iran managed to make
Americans dramatically aware of the
frustrating state of the nation's in
ternational affairs. But this only
served to feed upon the deep-seated
domestic frustrations that the UAW
president had been talking about back
when Ronald Reagan was just setting
out on his campaign for the presiden
cy.

moved in significant numbers to sup
port the conservative Republican.
Reagan wound up winning a majori
ty of the votes of the labor union mem
bers, according to polling done by the
television networks as voters were
leaving the polls. Reagan won about
half of the votes of Jews, who had
voted overwhelmingly for Carter four
years ago. Reagan also won the votes
of more Catholics than did Carter, al
though by a relatively narrow margin.
And Reagan carried the Protestant
vote by almost two to one.
The defections from the traditional
Democratic ranks were wide and
deep. Not only did Carter lose large
numbers of voters who call them
selves liberals to independent John
Anderson, but in Ohio, for example,
fully one third of those who said they
were liberals also said they had voted
for the conservative Reagan.
Perhaps every bit as decisive to the
election's outcome was the fact that
large numbers of Democrats also de
cided not to vote at all. According to
projections, voter turnout declined in
1980 to just about 50 percent of the
adult population, compared to the 54
percent turnout in 1976. Of those who
did vote, about 40 percent were Demo
crats. 29 percent Republicans and 29
percent independents — which meant
that Republicans had become a
greater proportion of those voting
than at any time in recent history. In
recent years. Republicans have made
up only 23 percent of the voting popu
lation.
Of those traditionally Democratic
voting blocs. Carter held his own only
among the minorities, especially
blacks and Hispanics. The turnout
among black voters was estimated by
some polling experts to have been
about the same as in years past and a
spot survey by the National Associa
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People showed that the black turnout
had actually increased by 10 percent.
Carter won 80 to 90 percent of the
black vote, according to exit polling by

television networks. Reagan won
about three fourths of the remaining
votes.
Realignment prospects
Last summer, Republicans had
talked optimistically about the pros
pect of a realignment of the American
electorate, a breaking up of that coali
tion of blue collar workers and minor
ities that had been largely responsible
for making the Democrats the majori
ty party for most of the years of the
last five decades.
Tuesday night. Reagan pollsters
Wirthlin and Teeter were not contend
ing that any fundamental realignment
had taken place. "But it could be the
beginning," said Wirthlin. "We suc
ceeded in our prime objective of
breaking up the coalition which had
voted for Carter four years ago."
Douglas Fraser, president of the po
litically powerful and liberal United

Auto Workers, spoke unhappily of the
fate that had befallen the Democratic
party. Thirty percent of his union's
members were unemployed at this
time, as the 62-year-old Fraser ob
served:
"People of my generation have been
running against Herbert Hoover since
1932. And now. in 1980. we find they
have the issues and we don't."
Frustration realized
In the last weekend of the 1980 presi
dential campaign, it was true that the
ayatollahs in Iran managed to make
Americans dramatically aware of the
frustrating state of the nation's in
ternational affairs. But this only
served to feed upon the deep-seated
domestic frustrations that the UAW
president had been talking about back
when Ronald Reagan was just setting
out on his campaign for the presiden
cy.
In the end, as President Carter's
strategists saw it.it was Jimmy
Carter who was done in by the "Octo
ber surprise'' from Iran
It was not Ronald Reagan, whose
advisers had once feared that a last
minute hostage break would be their
political undoing Reagan wound up
instead as the beneficiary of adramat
ic shift in traditionally Democratic
blocs — among them, labor union
members and Jews who voted for Re
agan in large numbers, and many oth
er Democrats who decided to stay
home and not vote at all
And so the election that most public
polls had called very close through the
final weekend of the campaign turned
out to be an electoral landslide for the
Republican nominee
It was a result that stunned many of
tie president's top echelon of ad
* isers. but not those of the Reagan
(amp. The Republican nominee's
pollsters had been saying ever since
the climactic presidential debate one
week ago that the race was no longer

close That debate, according to Re
agan pollsters Richard Wirthlin and
Robert Teeter, enabled Reagan to
open up a lead of five to seven percent.
Reagan maintained that lead and
watched it grow steadily, they said,
with only a mild boost from the late
breaking events in Iran
As Carter's polling expert, Patrick
Caddell. analyzed the last days of the
campaign for his boss and campaign
colleagues, the president had drawn
even with Reagan by late Saturday
night. In fact. Carter actually held a
slight, fractional lead at that point,
Caddell's figures showed As Caddell
later analyzed it. there was very little
change in the actual attitudes of the
public toward Carter and Reagan
themselves. The four-percentage
point boost that Reagan had received
from the Tuesday night presidential
debate had evaporated
U.S. image drops
But on Sunday, after the Iranian
leaders made public their new condi
tions for the release of the hostages,
the bottom fell out of the president's

re-election prospects As Caddell later
analyzed it. there was very little
change in the actual attitudes of the
public toward Carter and Reagan
themselves But there was a sharp, 10
percent drop on the question of how
voters viewed the U S position in the
world
"Iran came to represent the whole
set of enormous frustrations that were
being voted on." said one of Carter's
most senior strategists From dead
even on Saturday night, Reagan
soared to a 10 point lead by 1 a.m.
Tuesday, according to the Caddell sur
veys Never before. Caddell said, had
an election moved so sharply in the
last hours of a campaign.
"No way." countered Reagan's
pollster. Richard Wirthlin. "That's
just not true."
Wirthlin's own surveys showed Re
agan opening a quick lead after the de
bate. a lead which he says was never
relinquished, but in fact grew steadily
to landslide proportions. On Oct. 30,
Reagan's lead was seven points, ac
cording to Wirthlin It was nine points

Friday. 10 points Saturday. 11 points
Sunday, and was holding at 11 points,
with another 12 percent undecided on
Monday.
The debate. Wirthlin said, erased
all the doubts about Reagan's charac
ter and competence, doubts which the
Democratic campaign had worked so
hard to develop. Once those anxieties
were gone, voters were eager to vote
against Carter because of the econo
my and other failings of his first term.
