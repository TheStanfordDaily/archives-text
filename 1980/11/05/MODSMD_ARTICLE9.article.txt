# Smokers initiative fails; 8 wins narrowly
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Los Angeles — California voters
last night appeared to be narrowly re
jecting a ballot measure to require no
smoking sections in most buildings
open to the public.
Proposition 10. the hotly contested
California measure to mandate crea
tion of no smoking sections in public
buildings and work areas, was headed
for defeat in early returns last night by
a 53 percent to 47 percent margin
That was the same margin of defeat
predicted earlier in the day by an As
sociated Press-NBC poll based on in
terviews at polling places.
The measure would require em
ployers and owners of public facilities
to abide by regulations designed to
separate smokers from non-smokers
in most enclosed buildings in the state.
The defeat of Proposition 10 would
be a victory for the nation's tobacco
companies, which spent more than
$2.3 million to beat the initiative. Pro
ponents. including the American
Cancer Society and anti-smoking ac
tivists. spent less than a third of that
— approximately $700,000
Two years ago, the tobacco industry
spent $fi million in a successful effort
to defeat a similar measure in Califor
nia.
Peripheral canal
Proposition 8, a proposal to make it
more difficult to put dams on North
Coast "wild rivers'' if the Peripheral
Canal is built, led narrowly, 51 percent
to 49 percent.
Two measures to modify Proposi
tion 13, the property tax initiative of
1978. wont down to crushing defeats,
but a third was being approved.
Proposition 4. a measure to allow
property tax-supported bonds that
were outlawed by Proposition 13 to fi
nance local government construction
projects, was being swamped more
than 3-1.
Sponsored by developers, business
groups, and local governments, Prop

osition 4 is a general obligation bond,
which is supported by an increase in
local property taxes, and which can be
sold for lower interest than currently
available bonds.
Proposition 4 proposed authorizing
such bonds by a two-thirds local vote
to pay for such local government
projects as courthouses, sewer sys
tems. libraiies and fire stations
Proposition 5. which would have ex
panded property tax cuts for property
relocated because of disaster or gov
ernment condemnation, was losing
3-2.
The third Proposition 13-related
measure. Proposition 7. to exempt so
lar heating and cooling systems from
property tax reassessment, was lead
ing by more than 3-2.
Juries
Proposition 6. which would author
ize juries of eight instead of 12 mem
bers in civil suits for less than $15,000,
led with 58 percent of the vote.
Proposition 2. an $85 million bond to
buy up land parcels whose develop
ment could threaten Lake Tahoe's wa
ter quality, appeared to be heading for
a narrow defeat. A to give insurance
companies a tax break for contribut
ing to a guarantee fund for insurers
who go broke, was being defeated by
nearly 3-1.
The other two ballot measures ap
peared headed for easy passage:
Proposition 9. to shift $15 million in
bond funds from drinking water
purification to groundwater cleanup,
and Proposition 11, to roll back pay
raises for 27 state Supreme Court and
appellate justices.
Most of the state's ballot measures
also faced rejection by voters, includ
ing initiatives to enlarge the state's
parks and beaches, make state
purchases of Lake Tahoe Land, extend
state guarantees to life insurance ben
efits. lift property tax limitations in
some cases, and to exempt new con
struction from higher property taxes

in selected cases.
In summary, voters approved
measures to reduce the size of some
juries, exempt solar energy devices
from property taxes, increase state
aid to local water systems and reduce
the size of pay hikes to some judges
Also, a constitutional amendment
to preserve scenic Northern Califor
nia rivers and assure Sacramento del
ta water quality was narrowly leading
in early returns.
Karly returns
Other early returns showed:
—Proposition 1. to authorize the
sale of $285 million in bonds to finance
state parkland expansion and develop

ment was losing by a 52 percent to 48
percent vote. A broader, more ex
pensive version of this bond issue pro
posal was rejected by voters last June.
—Proposition 3. a life insurance in
dustry-backed measure to create a
state fund to guarantee payment on all
life insurance benefits if a company
became insolvent, was rejected 73
percent to 27 percent.
—Proposition 5. to keep property
tax valuations from automatically ris
ing to market value on new construc
tion when the building replaces struc
tures lost during natural disasters or
government action, was defeated 60
percent to 40 percent.

bers in civil suits for less than $15,000,
led with 58 percent of the vote.
Proposition 2. an $85 million bond to
buy up land parcels whose develop
ment could threaten Lake Tahoe's wa
ter quality, appeared to be heading for
a narrow defeat. A to give insurance
companies a tax break for contribut
ing to a guarantee fund for insurers
who go broke, was being defeated by
nearly 3-1.
The other two ballot measures ap
peared headed for easy passage:
Proposition 9. to shift $15 million in
bond funds from drinking water
purification to groundwater cleanup,
and Proposition 11, to roll back pay
raises for 27 state Supreme Court and
appellate justices.
Most of the state's ballot measures
also faced rejection by voters, includ
ing initiatives to enlarge the state's
parks and beaches, make state
purchases of Lake Tahoe Land, extend
state guarantees to life insurance ben
efits. lift property tax limitations in
some cases, and to exempt new con
struction from higher property taxes

in selected cases.
In summary, voters approved
measures to reduce the size of some
juries, exempt solar energy devices
from property taxes, increase state
aid to local water systems and reduce
the size of pay hikes to some judges
Also, a constitutional amendment
to preserve scenic Northern Califor
nia rivers and assure Sacramento del
ta water quality was narrowly leading
in early returns.
Karly returns
Other early returns showed:
—Proposition 1. to authorize the
sale of $285 million in bonds to finance
state parkland expansion and develop

ment was losing by a 52 percent to 48
percent vote. A broader, more ex
pensive version of this bond issue pro
posal was rejected by voters last June.
—Proposition 3. a life insurance in
dustry-backed measure to create a
state fund to guarantee payment on all
life insurance benefits if a company
became insolvent, was rejected 73
percent to 27 percent.
—Proposition 5. to keep property
tax valuations from automatically ris
ing to market value on new construc
tion when the building replaces struc
tures lost during natural disasters or
government action, was defeated 60
percent to 40 percent.
From the Daily wire services
Los Angeles — California voters
last night appeared to be narrowly re
jecting a ballot measure to require no
smoking sections in most buildings
open to the public.
Proposition 10. the hotly contested
California measure to mandate crea
tion of no smoking sections in public
buildings and work areas, was headed
for defeat in early returns last night by
a 53 percent to 47 percent margin
That was the same margin of defeat
predicted earlier in the day by an As
sociated Press-NBC poll based on in
terviews at polling places.
The measure would require em
ployers and owners of public facilities
to abide by regulations designed to
separate smokers from non-smokers
in most enclosed buildings in the state.
The defeat of Proposition 10 would
be a victory for the nation's tobacco
companies, which spent more than
$2.3 million to beat the initiative. Pro
ponents. including the American
Cancer Society and anti-smoking ac
tivists. spent less than a third of that
— approximately $700,000
Two years ago, the tobacco industry
spent $fi million in a successful effort
to defeat a similar measure in Califor
nia.
Peripheral canal
Proposition 8, a proposal to make it
more difficult to put dams on North
Coast "wild rivers'' if the Peripheral
Canal is built, led narrowly, 51 percent
to 49 percent.
Two measures to modify Proposi
tion 13, the property tax initiative of
1978. wont down to crushing defeats,
but a third was being approved.
Proposition 4. a measure to allow
property tax-supported bonds that
were outlawed by Proposition 13 to fi
nance local government construction
projects, was being swamped more
than 3-1.
Sponsored by developers, business
groups, and local governments, Prop

osition 4 is a general obligation bond,
which is supported by an increase in
local property taxes, and which can be
sold for lower interest than currently
available bonds.
Proposition 4 proposed authorizing
such bonds by a two-thirds local vote
to pay for such local government
projects as courthouses, sewer sys
tems. libraiies and fire stations
Proposition 5. which would have ex
panded property tax cuts for property
relocated because of disaster or gov
ernment condemnation, was losing
3-2.
The third Proposition 13-related
measure. Proposition 7. to exempt so
lar heating and cooling systems from
property tax reassessment, was lead
ing by more than 3-2.
