Though Tuesday was a busy day for
Stanford students who wished to voice
their opinions by voting, a small group
found time and energy to participate in
an anti-draft rally sponsored by Students
Against Conscription (SAC). The 1 1 2-
hour rally, held in White Plaza, featured
a singer and three speakers.
It began with several anti-war and
anti-registration songs, followed by the
first speaker. Stanford student Matthew
David Nicodemus. Restating part of a
speech he had made in a press con
ference in Chicago. Nicodemus said, "I
challenge Mr Bernard Kotker. Director
of the Selective Service, to put. . . me on
a list of those who will not, in any way,
participate in wars and militarism.
"If you decide to join us in resisting
registration," he continued, "re
member: you won't be alone." Nico
demus also said that signing a regis
tration form means "putting one's self at

the mercy of the government for a
draft He said he believes that after re
fusing to fill in the registration form,
"you should wrap yourself in the flag and
feel good about it
' The government." he continued,
"needs to know that we the people will
not cooperate in our destruction. Patri
otism means loving one's
doing what you believe is best for it, and
this means, for some of us. breaking the
law that we feel is contrary to the ideals
and interests of the United States."
Nicodemus compared the "founding
fathers and mothers" to the members of
the current anti-registration movement.
He said that both groups had broken the
law because of their beliefs. He con
cluded with a song
Bernice Warettrich, a student of
Laney College in Oakland and a member
of the state-wide organization Students
United Against the Draft, spoke on the
subject of women's involvement in the

draft "We (women) are opposed to the
draft of men and women, period." she
stated. Warettrich spoke in favor of
women's rights and against war She
said that "it all the money from the mili
tary budget was put into women's equal
ity. all imperialism would end and this
society would crumble Wouldn't that be
somthingsh<* added
Warettrich ended by paraphrasing a
quote from a Philippine revolutionary.
"The minute we stop burning with love
for our people." she said, 'we will die in
the cold."
The third speaker was Steve Ansiello.
a Vietnam war veteran and a member of
the Vietnam Veterans Against War-A I
1 Anti-Imperialism 1. Ansiello described
the plight of the Vietnamese people as
they were forced to move from place to
place because of the war. He said that he
did not want more "horrors of war"
which he said were caused in part by the
draft.
