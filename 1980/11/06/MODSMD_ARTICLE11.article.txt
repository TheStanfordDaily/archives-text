## On women and their voices 
### 
With a growing sense of
weirdness I sit in classes,
gatherings, and meetings and
watch other women listen They
listen mostly to men. but some
times to other women I am
mesmerized by the predictabili
ty in patterns of who begins and
ends discussions. who decides
what topics are dealt with, who
directs, who gets interrupted,
who argues, who avoids argu
ment. and who asks leading
questions to feed the talk
Simply, most women are out
talked and talked-over Their
acceptance of representation by
acquiescence is significant
when overlaid with an aware
ness that self-expression is
power. Because spoken per
suasion is a prerequisite to
power, it is worthwhile to re
flect on women and their voices.
If "voice" is used in the broad
sense to mean oral or written
presentation of self. 1. like many
women, am dissatisfied with
my voice. I come across as too
uncertain or worse, too certain.
Having suffered both afflica
tions. I believe they signal a big
ger problem: too few women
trust their voices.
The strong vocal tones, frank
eye contact, relaxed stance
which mark a good public speak
er seldom come naturally to
women. Until recently, these
demonstrations of self-con
fidence were by definition char
acteristic of men. Many women
I know complain they do not rep
resent themselves accurately
when they open their mouths in
public. They waver in mid-sen
tence. over-qualify their opin
ions. or under-modulate be
cause they are nervous about
drawing attention.
Granted, many men are also
unsure, but women suffer a
dearth of role models, a lack
of opportunities and encourage
ment to practice forceful ex
pression, and eons of condition
ing to devalue their opinions or
let others express them. And
women are good listeners.
Time and again I see women
watch and listen, or watch and
make coffee, or watch and
agree, while men talk about
elections, religion or them
selves. Though I'm sure the lec

tures seem like discussions
from the speakers' point of
view. I question the barrage of
verbiage, survival-of-t he-fit test
style of speaking, where the
most important goal seems to
be to impress this or that upon
the listener. Speaking up should
merely be a mechanical act of
opening one's mouth to convey a
thought, but women's voices
often fail them in situations
when it is less threatening to
just listen without breaking in.
I watch women listening with
interested looks on their faces
and wonder if they feel, as 1
have felt, helpless, remorseful,
or bored Grateful as I usually
am to learn from speakers. 1
know 1 sometimes listen out of
the politeness taught to me
when 1 was a little girl, and be
cause I found that good listening
meant popularity when I was a
teenager
Of course. 1 like people to lis
ten I also like people to talk,
and 1 especially like those who
do both. Considering that many
women and men are raised in
subcultures divided by gender,
there is a need for dialogue
before there can be under
standing or empathy. To this
end. men must be sensitive,
positive listeners. Even more
importantly, women must take
risks to overcome their voice
lessness.
Claiming a voice is uncom
fortable. and the first casualty
is ease and naturalness in com
munication. Awareness that one
has been silent only makes
speaking more difficult.
I am uncomfortable, for ex
ample. writing in the Daily. My
voice sounds too self-assured
and final here. I would prefer
dialogue to editorial page repre
sentation of what is widely
dubbed "the feminist per
spective."
I'm no expert in women's op
pression. although my ex
periences have made me read
ier than some to call it op
pression when I see it in every
day life. At one time the risks of
saying what seemed to me
simple truths were defeating,
and although I was glad not to be
one of the voiceless women. I
was diverted from saying unex
pected or angry things and

bought off by approval 1 no
longer doubt my ability to inde
pendently cultivate a voice (and
thus a power». but now there is a
new problem — because a few
women dike myself) speak, oth
er women are remaining silent
Accepting token speaking
roles is unpleasant and decep
tive. Tokens contribute to a
veneer of egalitarianism when,
in reality, business goes on as
usual while those supposedly
being represented may private
ly disagree with their "repre
sentatives." With so many elo
quent. intelligent Stanford
women why are a few women
over-exposed? Many in the
women's community here share
a feeling that they may become
a burned-out core. Unfortunate
ly. when there is a need to win
attention for issues, few voices
will be attended to until many
are raised.
The self-perceived voiceless
ness which induces many wom
en to cede the floor, mistrust
their powers of reason, and deny
the validity of their emotions or
responses is heightened at uni
versities where adroit, rapid
manipulation of ideas is valued.
For many women at Stanford,
part of a real education involves
process questions as basic as.
"Why am I sitting here while
they talk?" For those women
who do speak up. the question
becomes. "How can others be
helped to talk '"

(Leah Halper is a junior major

With a growing sense of
weirdness I sit in classes,
gatherings, and meetings and
watch other women listen They
listen mostly to men. but some
times to other women I am
mesmerized by the predictabili
ty in patterns of who begins and
ends discussions. who decides
what topics are dealt with, who
directs, who gets interrupted,
who argues, who avoids argu
ment. and who asks leading
questions to feed the talk
Simply, most women are out
talked and talked-over Their
acceptance of representation by
acquiescence is significant
when overlaid with an aware
ness that self-expression is
power. Because spoken per
suasion is a prerequisite to
power, it is worthwhile to re
flect on women and their voices.
If "voice" is used in the broad
sense to mean oral or written
presentation of self. 1. like many
women, am dissatisfied with
my voice. I come across as too
uncertain or worse, too certain.
Having suffered both afflica
tions. I believe they signal a big
ger problem: too few women
trust their voices.
The strong vocal tones, frank
eye contact, relaxed stance
which mark a good public speak
er seldom come naturally to
women. Until recently, these
demonstrations of self-con
fidence were by definition char
acteristic of men. Many women
I know complain they do not rep
resent themselves accurately
when they open their mouths in
public. They waver in mid-sen
tence. over-qualify their opin
ions. or under-modulate be
cause they are nervous about
drawing attention.
Granted, many men are also
unsure, but women suffer a
dearth of role models, a lack
of opportunities and encourage
ment to practice forceful ex
pression, and eons of condition
ing to devalue their opinions or
let others express them. And
women are good listeners.
Time and again I see women
watch and listen, or watch and
make coffee, or watch and
agree, while men talk about
elections, religion or them
selves. Though I'm sure the lec

tures seem like discussions
from the speakers' point of
view. I question the barrage of
verbiage, survival-of-t he-fit test
style of speaking, where the
most important goal seems to
be to impress this or that upon
the listener. Speaking up should
merely be a mechanical act of
opening one's mouth to convey a
thought, but women's voices
often fail them in situations
when it is less threatening to
just listen without breaking in.
I watch women listening with
interested looks on their faces
and wonder if they feel, as 1
have felt, helpless, remorseful,
or bored Grateful as I usually
am to learn from speakers. 1
know 1 sometimes listen out of
the politeness taught to me
when 1 was a little girl, and be
cause I found that good listening
meant popularity when I was a
teenager
Of course. 1 like people to lis
ten I also like people to talk,
and 1 especially like those who
do both. Considering that many
women and men are raised in
subcultures divided by gender,
there is a need for dialogue
before there can be under
standing or empathy. To this
end. men must be sensitive,
positive listeners. Even more
importantly, women must take
risks to overcome their voice
lessness.
Claiming a voice is uncom
fortable. and the first casualty
is ease and naturalness in com
munication. Awareness that one
has been silent only makes
speaking more difficult.
I am uncomfortable, for ex
ample. writing in the Daily. My
voice sounds too self-assured
and final here. I would prefer
dialogue to editorial page repre
sentation of what is widely
dubbed "the feminist per
