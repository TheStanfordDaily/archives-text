## 'We should not sanction such blackmail' 
### 
Dr. Coit Blacker and Kent Wisner of the Arms Con
trol and Disarmament program, recently argued on
this page (Daily, Oct. 20) that rational decisions on
SALT II can only be made when the tacts are clearly
presented. I agree. But I don't believe that their re
sponse to my earlier column (Daily, Oct. 15) quite laid
out all the facts either. Even with the presidential elec
tion now determined, these issues deserve more con
sideration.
Heavy missile launchers
I argued, first, that the treaty is unequal and should
be rejected because it grants the Soviets a unilateral
right to 308 heavy missile launchers, which give them a
massive "throw-weight'' advantage. (This is in addi
tion to the 1090 other land-based missiles to which they
would be entitled.) Blacker and Wisner call this prob
lem "essentially irrelevant."
In fact, the throw-weight advantage is far from ir
relevant.
Blacker and Wisner speak here in terms of
hypothetical weapons systems on our side. They argue,
essentially, that the treaty allows "rough parity" be
tween Soviet and American forces — especially given
the limitation of 10 warheads for each Soviet heavy
missile, the same as allowed for our MX missiles.
But they fail to note that the Soviets have their SS-18
heavy missiles fully operational now. We will not have
an MX program in operation until well after the treaty
is set to expire in 1985. Even putting aside the im
possibility of verifying the number of warheads
deployed, this is hardly "rough parity."
For one thing, the Soviets continue to outspend us on
arms by at least two-to-one, and are making consistent
technological gains. By the time the treaty does expire,
they will be ready and eager to equip their heavy mis
siles with the 30 warheads that they are capable of car
rying, each more destructive than our own warheads
and equally as accurate. We need throw-weight limits
now to reduce that potential.
But more important, it is primarily the throw-weight
advantage that endangers us until the MX system does
come into place. Even the administration admits the
current vulnerability of our Minuteman force. The
heavy missile force alone could destroy more than 90
percent of our land-based missiles (ICBMs), as well as
the 50 percent of our submarine force (SLBMs) in port
for servicing at any given time, and a good share of our
B-525.
The administration responds that even the destruc
tion of our ICBMs would leave us in a position to effect
massive retaliation with our SLBMs and B-525. But this
is questionable in fact, and meaningless as a nuclear
strategy
The B 525. if they did survive a first strike, likely
could not penetrate the highly developed Soviet air de
fenses (at least 2500 interceptor fighters and 12.000
anti-aircraft missiles). Our SLBMs, meanwhile, are
far less accurate missiles than the ICBMs, and thus
only capable of attacking Soviet cities. While some
might survive a Soviet attack, the SLBMs alone do not
offer us an acceptable response to a Soviet first strike.

Following a Soviet attack, they would still retain
about two-thirds of their strategic force. We could, per
haps. destroy some of their cities. But we would do so
knowing full well that a like counterattack on our own
cities would follow. In this setting, our SLBMs really
pose no threat to the Soviets at all.
The gravity of the Soviet throw-weight advantage in
an attack against our own ICBMs should thus be ap
parent.
Backfire bombers
I argued, second, that the treaty should be rejected
because it allows the Soviets to have, but not count.
Backfire bombers adding a total of about one-third to
their strategic destructive force. < I previously said 275
bombers; the actual number appears to be closer to
375.) The administration admits that the Backfire has
the capability to attack targets throughout the con
tinental United States. Yet Blacker and Wisner don't
consider this to be very important either.
Strategic bombers on both sides should be counted.
Certainly, as Blacker and Wisner note, the Backfire
will have more utility as a theater weapon than in at
tacks over intercontinental ranges. But this is true of
any aircraft. What matterS'is that the Backfire has de
livery capabilities superior to that of our B-525, which
arc counted.
In addition, the Backfire would face almost no re
sistance once it reached the United States. We have
deployed no surface-to-air missiles, and have only 309
active interceptor fighters. Clearly the Backfire should
be counted.
But bv far the most intriguing arguments here are
Blacker and Wisner's comments on the "Backfire
statement." which is a unilateral assurance by the So
viets that they will limit the capabilities of the
Backfire. It.and the treaty. Blacker and Wisner note,
will have the force of "international law."
In what way. I wonder, will "international law" re
strain the Soviets should they decide to attack us?
Would they be held back by their assurances — or by
any terms of the treaty? The answer is obvious. We
must not lose sight here of the fact that we are not only
the subjects of the treaty, but also its enforcers.
Contrary to Blacker and Wisner's claim, the
"Backfire statement." and the whole treaty do suffer
from extreme verification problems. But even with
verification, an arms control treaty does not end the
need of each side to be able to react quickly, in real mil
itary terms, if a violation is discovered.
A treaty is not a shield behind which we can abandon
our real defenses. Especially given the Soviets' failure
to negotiate in good faith throughout the SALT process,
Blacker and Wisner's assurances about "international
law" are no assurances at all.
Equal force levels
Finally. I argued for rejection of the treaty because
it allows for drastically unequal force levels on the two
sides. The treaty does not consider such crucial mat
ters as throw-weight, accuracy, number of missiles
deployed and stockpiled or size and number of war
heads deployed and stockpiled. Rather, the treaty lim

its only numbers of launchers. Blacker and Wisner call
this a "non-argument."'
The throw-weight and Backfire problems, by them
selves. discredit the notion of "rough parity" to which
Blacker and Wisner again resort here. But these are not
the only problems.
With all its spending on strategic arms, the Soviets
have made vast improvements in the accuracy and oth
er qualitative aspects of their weapons. They will con
tinue to do so. They have recently demonstrated in ma
neuvers their ability to fire one round of heavy missiles
and reload their silos — albeit over two to five days.
(The treaty does prohibit "rapid reload" capability.
But it is far from clear what is "rapid.") We have no
way of knowing how many missiles and warheads they
may have stockpiled for such a second-round attack.
The treaty clearly does not limit the production and
storage of missiles and warheads. By the end of 1985,
we can expect the Soviets to have 6000 to 9000 ICBM
warheads, compared to our own 2154. They are produc
ing 150 to 200 new ICBM missiles each year. We are pro
ducing none. With the Soviets able to do all this within
the treaty, plainly it does not place any "significant
constraints on Soviet strategic systems," as Blacker
and Wisner contend.
The goals of SALT
The facts concerning SALT II are important. We
must consider them in light of the accepted goals of the
entire arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to
accept the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should
not believe that rejection of SALT II would be the end of
arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to accept
the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should not be
lieve that rejection of SALT II would be the end of arms
limitations efforts. If the Soviets sincerely want arms
control, they will continue to negotiate; if not, SALT II
certainly won't stop them.
Foremost, an arms control treaty must insure
strategic stability. SALT II reduces stability by ratify
ing Soviet superiority. It also reduces stability because
it leaves us no way of knowing how many missiles and
warheads are stockpiled or what numbers and sizes of
warheads are actually deployed. Nor can we find out
the actual ranges and assignments of the Backfire
bombers. In part because the Soviets are now encrypt
ing certain information that we need for verification,
Blacker and Wisner are exactly wrong when they claim
that there will be no obligation to "trust the Russians."
Finally, if we value stability, we cannot, as Blacker
and Wisner suggest, separate the SALT II debate from
other Soviet conduct. Ratification of the Soviet advan
tages can only tempt them into further adventurism in
Africa and the Middle-East.
While the threat of a Soviet first strike may be small,
the threat of nuclear blackmail is very great indeed.
We should not sanction such blackmail with SALT 11.
With all this in mind, it is not surprising that the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee has voted 10 to zero,
with seven abstentions, to reject the treaty as not in the
security interests of the United States.

livery capabilities superior to that of our B-525, which
arc counted.
In addition, the Backfire would face almost no re
sistance once it reached the United States. We have
deployed no surface-to-air missiles, and have only 309
active interceptor fighters. Clearly the Backfire should
be counted.
But bv far the most intriguing arguments here are
Blacker and Wisner's comments on the "Backfire
statement." which is a unilateral assurance by the So
viets that they will limit the capabilities of the
Backfire. It.and the treaty. Blacker and Wisner note,
will have the force of "international law."
In what way. I wonder, will "international law" re
strain the Soviets should they decide to attack us?
Would they be held back by their assurances — or by
any terms of the treaty? The answer is obvious. We
must not lose sight here of the fact that we are not only
the subjects of the treaty, but also its enforcers.
Contrary to Blacker and Wisner's claim, the
"Backfire statement." and the whole treaty do suffer
from extreme verification problems. But even with
verification, an arms control treaty does not end the
need of each side to be able to react quickly, in real mil
itary terms, if a violation is discovered.
A treaty is not a shield behind which we can abandon
our real defenses. Especially given the Soviets' failure
to negotiate in good faith throughout the SALT process,
Blacker and Wisner's assurances about "international
law" are no assurances at all.
Equal force levels
Finally. I argued for rejection of the treaty because
it allows for drastically unequal force levels on the two
sides. The treaty does not consider such crucial mat
ters as throw-weight, accuracy, number of missiles
deployed and stockpiled or size and number of war
heads deployed and stockpiled. Rather, the treaty lim

its only numbers of launchers. Blacker and Wisner call
this a "non-argument."'
The throw-weight and Backfire problems, by them
selves. discredit the notion of "rough parity" to which
Blacker and Wisner again resort here. But these are not
the only problems.
With all its spending on strategic arms, the Soviets
have made vast improvements in the accuracy and oth
er qualitative aspects of their weapons. They will con
tinue to do so. They have recently demonstrated in ma
neuvers their ability to fire one round of heavy missiles
and reload their silos — albeit over two to five days.
(The treaty does prohibit "rapid reload" capability.
But it is far from clear what is "rapid.") We have no
way of knowing how many missiles and warheads they
may have stockpiled for such a second-round attack.
The treaty clearly does not limit the production and
storage of missiles and warheads. By the end of 1985,
we can expect the Soviets to have 6000 to 9000 ICBM
warheads, compared to our own 2154. They are produc
ing 150 to 200 new ICBM missiles each year. We are pro
ducing none. With the Soviets able to do all this within
the treaty, plainly it does not place any "significant
constraints on Soviet strategic systems," as Blacker
and Wisner contend.
The goals of SALT
The facts concerning SALT II are important. We
must consider them in light of the accepted goals of the
entire arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to
accept the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should
not believe that rejection of SALT II would be the end of
arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to accept
the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should not be
lieve that rejection of SALT II would be the end of arms
limitations efforts. If the Soviets sincerely want arms
control, they will continue to negotiate; if not, SALT II
certainly won't stop them.
Foremost, an arms control treaty must insure
strategic stability. SALT II reduces stability by ratify
ing Soviet superiority. It also reduces stability because
it leaves us no way of knowing how many missiles and
warheads are stockpiled or what numbers and sizes of
warheads are actually deployed. Nor can we find out
the actual ranges and assignments of the Backfire
bombers. In part because the Soviets are now encrypt
ing certain information that we need for verification,
Blacker and Wisner are exactly wrong when they claim
that there will be no obligation to "trust the Russians."
Finally, if we value stability, we cannot, as Blacker
and Wisner suggest, separate the SALT II debate from
other Soviet conduct. Ratification of the Soviet advan
tages can only tempt them into further adventurism in
Africa and the Middle-East.
While the threat of a Soviet first strike may be small,
the threat of nuclear blackmail is very great indeed.
We should not sanction such blackmail with SALT 11.
With all this in mind, it is not surprising that the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee has voted 10 to zero,
with seven abstentions, to reject the treaty as not in the
security interests of the United States.
(Seott Richtpr is a third \earJl)/MBA student.)
Dr. Coit Blacker and Kent Wisner of the Arms Con
trol and Disarmament program, recently argued on
this page (Daily, Oct. 20) that rational decisions on
SALT II can only be made when the tacts are clearly
presented. I agree. But I don't believe that their re
sponse to my earlier column (Daily, Oct. 15) quite laid
out all the facts either. Even with the presidential elec
tion now determined, these issues deserve more con
sideration.
Heavy missile launchers
I argued, first, that the treaty is unequal and should
be rejected because it grants the Soviets a unilateral
right to 308 heavy missile launchers, which give them a
massive "throw-weight'' advantage. (This is in addi
tion to the 1090 other land-based missiles to which they
would be entitled.) Blacker and Wisner call this prob
lem "essentially irrelevant."
In fact, the throw-weight advantage is far from ir
relevant.
Blacker and Wisner speak here in terms of
hypothetical weapons systems on our side. They argue,
essentially, that the treaty allows "rough parity" be
tween Soviet and American forces — especially given
the limitation of 10 warheads for each Soviet heavy
missile, the same as allowed for our MX missiles.
But they fail to note that the Soviets have their SS-18
heavy missiles fully operational now. We will not have
an MX program in operation until well after the treaty
is set to expire in 1985. Even putting aside the im
possibility of verifying the number of warheads
deployed, this is hardly "rough parity."
For one thing, the Soviets continue to outspend us on
arms by at least two-to-one, and are making consistent
technological gains. By the time the treaty does expire,
they will be ready and eager to equip their heavy mis
siles with the 30 warheads that they are capable of car
rying, each more destructive than our own warheads
and equally as accurate. We need throw-weight limits
now to reduce that potential.
But more important, it is primarily the throw-weight
advantage that endangers us until the MX system does
come into place. Even the administration admits the
current vulnerability of our Minuteman force. The
heavy missile force alone could destroy more than 90
percent of our land-based missiles (ICBMs), as well as
the 50 percent of our submarine force (SLBMs) in port
for servicing at any given time, and a good share of our
B-525.
The administration responds that even the destruc
tion of our ICBMs would leave us in a position to effect
massive retaliation with our SLBMs and B-525. But this
is questionable in fact, and meaningless as a nuclear
strategy
The B 525. if they did survive a first strike, likely
could not penetrate the highly developed Soviet air de
fenses (at least 2500 interceptor fighters and 12.000
anti-aircraft missiles). Our SLBMs, meanwhile, are
far less accurate missiles than the ICBMs, and thus
only capable of attacking Soviet cities. While some
might survive a Soviet attack, the SLBMs alone do not
offer us an acceptable response to a Soviet first strike.

Following a Soviet attack, they would still retain
about two-thirds of their strategic force. We could, per
haps. destroy some of their cities. But we would do so
knowing full well that a like counterattack on our own
cities would follow. In this setting, our SLBMs really
pose no threat to the Soviets at all.
The gravity of the Soviet throw-weight advantage in
an attack against our own ICBMs should thus be ap
parent.
Backfire bombers
I argued, second, that the treaty should be rejected
because it allows the Soviets to have, but not count.
Backfire bombers adding a total of about one-third to
their strategic destructive force. < I previously said 275
bombers; the actual number appears to be closer to
375.) The administration admits that the Backfire has
the capability to attack targets throughout the con
tinental United States. Yet Blacker and Wisner don't
consider this to be very important either.
Strategic bombers on both sides should be counted.
Certainly, as Blacker and Wisner note, the Backfire
will have more utility as a theater weapon than in at
tacks over intercontinental ranges. But this is true of
any aircraft. What matterS'is that the Backfire has de
livery capabilities superior to that of our B-525, which
arc counted.
In addition, the Backfire would face almost no re

and Wisner suggest, separate the SALT II debate from
other Soviet conduct. Ratification of the Soviet advan
tages can only tempt them into further adventurism in
Africa and the Middle-East.
While the threat of a Soviet first strike may be small,
the threat of nuclear blackmail is very great indeed.
We should not sanction such blackmail with SALT 11.
With all this in mind, it is not surprising that the Sen
ate Armed Services Committee has voted 10 to zero,
with seven abstentions, to reject the treaty as not in the
security interests of the United States.
(Seott Richtpr is a third \earJl)/MBA student.)
Dr. Coit Blacker and Kent Wisner of the Arms Con
trol and Disarmament program, recently argued on
this page (Daily, Oct. 20) that rational decisions on
SALT II can only be made when the tacts are clearly
presented. I agree. But I don't believe that their re
sponse to my earlier column (Daily, Oct. 15) quite laid
out all the facts either. Even with the presidential elec
tion now determined, these issues deserve more con
sideration.
Heavy missile launchers
I argued, first, that the treaty is unequal and should
be rejected because it grants the Soviets a unilateral
right to 308 heavy missile launchers, which give them a
massive "throw-weight'' advantage. (This is in addi
tion to the 1090 other land-based missiles to which they
would be entitled.) Blacker and Wisner call this prob
lem "essentially irrelevant."
In fact, the throw-weight advantage is far from ir
relevant.
Blacker and Wisner speak here in terms of
hypothetical weapons systems on our side. They argue,
essentially, that the treaty allows "rough parity" be
tween Soviet and American forces — especially given
the limitation of 10 warheads for each Soviet heavy
missile, the same as allowed for our MX missiles.
But they fail to note that the Soviets have their SS-18
heavy missiles fully operational now. We will not have
an MX program in operation until well after the treaty
is set to expire in 1985. Even putting aside the im
possibility of verifying the number of warheads
deployed, this is hardly "rough parity."
For one thing, the Soviets continue to outspend us on
arms by at least two-to-one, and are making consistent
technological gains. By the time the treaty does expire,
they will be ready and eager to equip their heavy mis
siles with the 30 warheads that they are capable of car
rying, each more destructive than our own warheads
and equally as accurate. We need throw-weight limits
now to reduce that potential.
But more important, it is primarily the throw-weight
advantage that endangers us until the MX system does
come into place. Even the administration admits the
current vulnerability of our Minuteman force. The
heavy missile force alone could destroy more than 90
percent of our land-based missiles (ICBMs), as well as
the 50 percent of our submarine force (SLBMs) in port
for servicing at any given time, and a good share of our
B-525.
The administration responds that even the destruc
tion of our ICBMs would leave us in a position to effect
massive retaliation with our SLBMs and B-525. But this
is questionable in fact, and meaningless as a nuclear
strategy
The B 525. if they did survive a first strike, likely
could not penetrate the highly developed Soviet air de
fenses (at least 2500 interceptor fighters and 12.000
anti-aircraft missiles). Our SLBMs, meanwhile, are
far less accurate missiles than the ICBMs, and thus
only capable of attacking Soviet cities. While some
might survive a Soviet attack, the SLBMs alone do not
offer us an acceptable response to a Soviet first strike.

Following a Soviet attack, they would still retain
about two-thirds of their strategic force. We could, per
haps. destroy some of their cities. But we would do so
knowing full well that a like counterattack on our own
cities would follow. In this setting, our SLBMs really
pose no threat to the Soviets at all.
The gravity of the Soviet throw-weight advantage in
an attack against our own ICBMs should thus be ap
parent.
Backfire bombers
I argued, second, that the treaty should be rejected
because it allows the Soviets to have, but not count.
Backfire bombers adding a total of about one-third to
their strategic destructive force. < I previously said 275
bombers; the actual number appears to be closer to
375.) The administration admits that the Backfire has
the capability to attack targets throughout the con
tinental United States. Yet Blacker and Wisner don't
consider this to be very important either.
Strategic bombers on both sides should be counted.
Certainly, as Blacker and Wisner note, the Backfire
will have more utility as a theater weapon than in at
tacks over intercontinental ranges. But this is true of
any aircraft. What matterS'is that the Backfire has de
livery capabilities superior to that of our B-525, which
arc counted.
In addition, the Backfire would face almost no re
sistance once it reached the United States. We have
deployed no surface-to-air missiles, and have only 309
active interceptor fighters. Clearly the Backfire should
be counted.
But bv far the most intriguing arguments here are
Blacker and Wisner's comments on the "Backfire
statement." which is a unilateral assurance by the So
viets that they will limit the capabilities of the
Backfire. It.and the treaty. Blacker and Wisner note,
will have the force of "international law."
In what way. I wonder, will "international law" re
strain the Soviets should they decide to attack us?
Would they be held back by their assurances — or by
any terms of the treaty? The answer is obvious. We
must not lose sight here of the fact that we are not only
the subjects of the treaty, but also its enforcers.
Contrary to Blacker and Wisner's claim, the
"Backfire statement." and the whole treaty do suffer
from extreme verification problems. But even with
verification, an arms control treaty does not end the
need of each side to be able to react quickly, in real mil
itary terms, if a violation is discovered.
A treaty is not a shield behind which we can abandon
our real defenses. Especially given the Soviets' failure
to negotiate in good faith throughout the SALT process,
Blacker and Wisner's assurances about "international
law" are no assurances at all.
Equal force levels
Finally. I argued for rejection of the treaty because
it allows for drastically unequal force levels on the two
sides. The treaty does not consider such crucial mat
ters as throw-weight, accuracy, number of missiles
deployed and stockpiled or size and number of war
heads deployed and stockpiled. Rather, the treaty lim

its only numbers of launchers. Blacker and Wisner call
this a "non-argument."'
The throw-weight and Backfire problems, by them
selves. discredit the notion of "rough parity" to which
Blacker and Wisner again resort here. But these are not
the only problems.
With all its spending on strategic arms, the Soviets
have made vast improvements in the accuracy and oth
er qualitative aspects of their weapons. They will con
tinue to do so. They have recently demonstrated in ma
neuvers their ability to fire one round of heavy missiles
and reload their silos — albeit over two to five days.
(The treaty does prohibit "rapid reload" capability.
But it is far from clear what is "rapid.") We have no
way of knowing how many missiles and warheads they
may have stockpiled for such a second-round attack.
The treaty clearly does not limit the production and
storage of missiles and warheads. By the end of 1985,
we can expect the Soviets to have 6000 to 9000 ICBM
warheads, compared to our own 2154. They are produc
ing 150 to 200 new ICBM missiles each year. We are pro
ducing none. With the Soviets able to do all this within
the treaty, plainly it does not place any "significant
constraints on Soviet strategic systems," as Blacker
and Wisner contend.
The goals of SALT
The facts concerning SALT II are important. We
must consider them in light of the accepted goals of the
entire arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to
accept the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should
not believe that rejection of SALT II would be the end of
arms limitation process. We cannot be asked to accept
the treaty for its symbolic value, and we should not be
lieve that rejection of SALT II would be the end of arms
limitations efforts. If the Soviets sincerely want arms
control, they will continue to negotiate; if not, SALT II
certainly won't stop them.
Foremost, an arms control treaty must insure
strategic stability. SALT II reduces stability by ratify
ing Soviet superiority. It also reduces stability because
it leaves us no way of knowing how many missiles and
warheads are stockpiled or what numbers and sizes of
warheads are actually deployed. Nor can we find out
the actual ranges and assignments of the Backfire
bombers. In part because the Soviets are now encrypt
ing certain information that we need for verification,
Blacker and Wisner are exactly wrong when they claim
that there will be no obligation to "trust the Russians."
Finally, if we value stability, we cannot, as Blacker
and Wisner suggest, separate the SALT II debate from
other Soviet conduct. Ratification of the Soviet advan
tages can only tempt them into further adventurism in
Africa and the Middle-East.
