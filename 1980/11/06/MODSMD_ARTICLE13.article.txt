# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Letters to the editor

Apology in order
Robert Greenberg and those
who share his opinions should be
interested in reading the Nov. 3,
1980 issue of Newsweek maga
zine. in which "Stanford-trained
economist" Ali Reza Nobari.
only 32 years old. now head of
Iran's Central Bank, describes
terms for the release of Ameri
cans held bv Iran.
In all the ballyhoo of last
week's letters to the Daily re
garding Greenberg's barnyard
economics and yahoo milita
rism (shades of Teddy Roo
sevelt! ), hasn't one thing been
overlooked'.'
Don't we here at Stanford owe
an apology to our classmates,
colleagues and teachers from
Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in
the Middle who were right
ly offended by the imperialist
and racist nature of
Greenberg's letter?
1 hope (I really do) that the
vast majority of the Stanford
community joins me in ten
dering an apology to them.

Advice to voters
I'm one of the 200 Stanford
students whose voter regis
tration cards were "lost" by
Frontlash. Following are a few
facts not mentioned in the Dai
ly's article (Daily, Nov. 4) and
advice on how you may safe
guard your franchise against
other's negligence.
According to the office of the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters, all but two of the lost
cards belonged to students who
wanted to register as Re
publicans. Are Stanford stu
dents 99 percent Republican?
This seems unlikely, so why
would a supposedly non-parti
san group like Frontlash sort
out Republican registrations
and lose some of them? The
Registrar does not ask that the
forms be sorted by party prefer
ence; they let the computer do
that.
To Frank Greinar, one of the
Registrar's supervisors, it
seemed "a little out of the or
dinary." It's understandable
that a partisan group might
want to see how successful their
registration drive was in reach

ing voters of their party. Is
Frontlash perhaps more parti
san than we have been given to
believe?
According to another political
source, "P'rontlash is a front for
the Central Labor Council."
Might this explain a less-than
charitable attitude towards Re
publicans? I'm not alone in ask
ing such questions. I was told
that the Republican Party had
filed suit and that the Registrar
has asked that the district at
torney review the suspiciously
selective nature of the mistake.
It's up to the judicial system to
decide whether deliberate
malfeasance was involved.
Your best bet for avoiding the
problem that I encountered is
the United States Postal Ser
vice. The mail-in forms at the
post office have detachable re
ceipts and almost all of them
seem to get to the Registrar. It's
also the way that most people
register.
Your right to vote is too im
portant to allow somebody else
take it away from you. Register
yourself by mail and be sure.

Cannon fodder?
As a man who in general sup
ports the aims of the women's
movement, I find myself at
times at odds with the more stri
dent proponents of feminism.
An example is the letter of
Janice Boughton and Sharon Sil
verstein (Daily, Oct. 31).
Boughton and Silverstein write
in opposition to equal treatment
of women with regard to mili
tary conscription.
I cannot argue with Boughton
and Silverstein's first point. If
one opposes conscription, one
must perforce oppose conscrip
tion for all. Whether or not to op
pose the draft is another issue,
one which I don't intend to dis
cuss.
Their second argument
seems to be that women should
not be placed in combat on the
grounds that they face certain
rape if captured. I would remind
Boughton and Silverstein that
male soldiers captured during
the Korean and Vietnam wars
were subject to brutal torture.
While as a man, I cannot speak
to the admitted horrors of rape,
I certainly am willing to hazard
a guess that the consequences of
torture are equally horrible.
These men, too, wake up
screaming in the middle of the
night.
Much more dangerous, how
ever. is Boughton and Silver
stein's contention that women
should have more say in foreign
policy and military decision
making, but should not serve as
"cannon fodder." If I read this
correctly, they are suggesting
that, instead of old men sending
young men off to die, women
should send young men off to
die. This shows a remarkable
degree of insensitivity, some
thing one doesn't usually as

sociate with the women's move
ment. Soldiers, whether male or
female, are not "cannon fod
der"; they are human beings,
just like you or I, and deserve
more respect than this.

Cyclist grateful
About five minutes past five
Tuesday evening, October 21, I
was riding my bicycle in the
southbound bicycle lane of
Serra Street going towards
Escondido Village. At the
break, a car pulled out of the
"C" lot, crossed the street, and
swung wide into the bicycle
lane. In order to avoid being hit
by the car, I tried to hop the curb
with my bicycle and ended up in
a heap on the pavement.
Before 10 seconds had passed,
I was being ably and warmly as
sisted by a number of other bicy
clists. Perhaps 10 people rushed
to my aid. One person even
caught up with the car and told
the driver she had caused an ac
cident.
I wish to thank all those car
ing people who so wonderfully
assisted me that evening. I don't
know any of your names. I had
long known that Stanford was a
caring and warm place. Now I
know that it is people like you
who went out of your way to help
me that make it so. One student
even caught up with me at my
house before I got to the hospital
to see if my husband needed ex
tra help!
Thank you all again. I hope
others, in similar circum
stances, are cared for in such a
concerned fashion.
