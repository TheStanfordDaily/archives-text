# CED tries for gradual change

Tom Hayden, radical activist
of the '60s, progressive leader of
the '70s, and the force behind the
8000-member Campaign for Ec
onomic Democracy (CED), re
cently voiced his fears of the
consequences facing the '80s.
He said, "Reagan thinks CED is
dangerous, and if he wins, we're
going to be seriously on the
line."
Jim McCutchen, local repre
sentative of CED. agreed with
Hayden's apprehensions. On the
night of the election returns he
commented. "We can't take
anything for granted anymore
— this is nightmare time."
He added later, "I feel like
curling up into a cocoon, but I'm
not going to. Our work is really
cut out for us now."
CED consists of 30 chapters
and claims to be the largest sin
gle organized force in the Cali
fornia left. The group maintains
that "times have changed and
old prescriptions have failed.".
Its members believe a new
generation of leadership must
emerge from the shadow of the
depression and World War II —
a leadership "shaped by the civ
il rights movement, the environ
mental movements, and the
struggles for personal liber
ation." Members say this work
can be accomplished around a
program of economic de-

mocracy within the Democratic
Party.
Hayden pointed out that as
we're entering the '80s ,our es
tablished institutions are failing
to deliver a promised prosper
ity, and so we must reorder our
national priorities. He sees eco
nomic democracy as a "grass
roots movement to guide this re
ordering," The movement is
based on a renewable energy
system and public influence in
corporate decision making.
Martin Carnoy, Stanford
education professor, has recent
ly published a book entitled, Ec
onomic Democracy: The
Challenge of the 1980s. Carnoy
describes his work as a
"model" for progressive
change in America. He has de
veloped a two-fold strategy
which revolves around public
presence in large corporations
and worker control at the plant
level.
Carnoy labels himself an
"American Socialist," saying
we must organize opposition
based on an alternative strategy
to old liberal solutions. How
ever, Hayden and McCutchen
hedged away from the term "so
cialist," preferring to call
themselves "progressive" in
stead.
All three acknowledged the
fact that "socialism" is termed

a bad word in the United States,
vet said they sense a
progressive change "hanging in
the wind." "Social change just
happens, it's not predictable,"
said Hayden "The key is that
the time must be right.
"The time is right in the sense
that change is needed now in the
'80s, but not in the sense of the
public's agreeing to those
changes," he said.
Twenty-five college cam
puses now have SED (Students
for Economic Democracy)
groups. According to Tessa
Rouverol, one of the founders of
SED, a Stanford chapter is in
the initial stages of organiza
tion.
She said SED attracts con
cerned students from a wide
range along the political spec
trum of opinion. Attempting to
build a consciousness toward
the alternatives, they view
themselves as a "creative rath
er than reactive force."
The group was originally
funded by CED. However,
Rouverol stressed that SED sets
its own priorities, then works
them through the vehicle of
CED. Some of the student con
cerns include the housing short
age, women's rights and the nu
clear and apartheid issues.

happens, it's not predictable,"
said Hayden "The key is that
the time must be right.
"The time is right in the sense
that change is needed now in the
'80s, but not in the sense of the
public's agreeing to those
changes," he said.
Twenty-five college cam
puses now have SED (Students
for Economic Democracy)
groups. According to Tessa
Rouverol, one of the founders of
SED, a Stanford chapter is in
the initial stages of organiza
tion.
She said SED attracts con
cerned students from a wide
range along the political spec
trum of opinion. Attempting to
build a consciousness toward
the alternatives, they view
themselves as a "creative rath
er than reactive force."
The group was originally
funded by CED. However,
Rouverol stressed that SED sets
its own priorities, then works
them through the vehicle of
CED. Some of the student con
cerns include the housing short
age, women's rights and the nu
clear and apartheid issues.
