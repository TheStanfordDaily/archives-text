### Lisa Hudson 
In an address Oct. 25 at Memorial Church,
theologian Wolfart Pannenberg traced the
way in which some classic ideas of Chris
tianity have changed from the Reformation
to the present. Entitled "The Road to
Faith," his message was designed to com
memorate Reformation Sunday.
Pannenberg, the dean of evangelical fac
ulty at the University of Munich, has been
called the leading Protestant theologian in
the world by Langdon Gilkey of the Univer
sity of Chicago
"We Christians all travel the road of faith
from the history of the Protestant Church to
the kingdom of God," said Pannenberg, who
added that a future life in communion with
God is "about to transfigure our present
life."
Pannenberg said trust in God was the key
to salvation and a meaningful life. He ad
dressed the question of religion vs. science,
often posed by philosophers, by stating
"The gospel of the crucified and risen Lord
must be received in faith." He went on to
say that the resurrection of Jesus is at the
heart of the Gospel, and"it tells of the reali
ty that is not yet accessible in general ex
perience."
Pannenberg decried the squabbling
among Protestant denominations, saying
that the "righteousness of God is revealed
from faith to faith so that all those who be
lieve may obtain salvation." He noted that
unfortunately this dogmatism began in an

cient times with Christians 112 ighting "over a
God of peace."
Pannenberg is noted for historical per
spective on religion He became a major
voice in contemporary theological dis
cussion with his 1959 article "Redemptive
Kvent and History." in which he argued that
history, not modern human existence, "is
the most comprehensive horizon of Chris
tian theology." His argument that Jesus'
resurrection was a historical event to be
studied by traditional methods was said by
theologians to bring a fresh insight to Chris
tian inquiry and interpretation.
In his address, Pannenberg reconstructed
the idea of the righteousness of God from
history to the modern times. The oldest
argument, as put forth by the prophet
Habakkuk, was that righteousness is
"faithfulness to the rules of conduct which
God expects us to observe," said Pan
nenberg.
He contrasted this attitude to the apostle
Paul's version, which came later in history.
Pannenberg said Paul's thesis is that right
eousness consists of faith itself. In other
words, Pannenberg said, "ethical commit
ment-' rather than good work is what makes
a righteous man. Pannenberg agreed that
"works are important insofar as they ex
press our faith in God." but admitted that
Western Christianity emphasizes faith
more than good works.
However, Pannenberg noted that "there
is no social form without some form or other

of moral rules."
He defined the modern meaning given to
the term righteousness as "living up to so
cial responsibilities." These include
fairness and honesty in dealing with others,
and in our personal lives. But he emphasized
that "We should not allow the honor or ac
ceptance of other people to be the final
criteria for our behavior." and said that
honesty to God is ultimately the most im
portant consideration
Pannenberg pointed out that often the re
sponsibility of having the complete con
fidence and trust of friends is too much for
people, and results in disappointment and
broken friendships when expectations can
not be met. He instead advocated depen
dence on God. who can "bear the weight of
full dependence."
He said that "facing God is equivalent to
freedom" because we can do the right
things through faith and not of ourselves. In
this way. Pannenberg explained, the an
cient view of a righteous God condemning
sin changed to a view of God as one who "lib
erates us" by faith.
Pannenberg concluded that what we do in
life determines if it is worthwhile â€” by de
termining if we go to Heaven. He noted that
sometimes "this goal is hidden from us" be
cause we don't understand the future. He
also said eternal life adds to the enjoyment
of this life, saying that that hope removes
the fear of death so that we can enjoy life
more.
