## Tentative chronicles of gay life 
### Stephen Nash 
One of the excitements of non-main
stream theater is that the topics being pres
ented may never have been seen on stage
before Thisis< specially true of gay theater
at the present time. The modern gay rights
movement has created a community with
unique relationships and experiences which
are not yet understood. Plays dealing with
this community become attempts to explain
what is happening to gay people today, as
well as historical documents describing the
changes in gay life as they happen. Two one
act plays currently at Theatre Rhinoceros
are part of this tentative chronicling of the
gay community
The Line Forms to the Rear by Cal
Yeomans is the intensely personal story of a
middle-aged, gay man. The play is in the
form of a monologue with minimal staging.
After many failures. Henry (played by
Blaine Souza) has returned to Jacksonville
to live with his mother in her mobile home.
Fmbarrassed by his mother's sex life, Hen
ry has taken to hanging out at the local K-
Mart (with its refreshing air-conditioning)
whenever her boyfriend comes over. One
day. while shopping for artificial flowers.

he is hit in the head by an exploding can of
tuna ( knocking him into a pile of plastic red
gladiolasi Dazed by the blow, he goes down
to the beach and accidentally comes upon
sexual activity in the public toilet there At
that point. Henrv discovers his mission in
lilc providing sexual relief to anyone who
wants it
Daniel Curzon's Beer and Rhubarb Pie
deals with a common but very perplexing
topic â€” the relationship between a straight
and a gay man. Len (Richard Staveni has
hired Fernando (Thomas-Mark) to do some
carpentry work for him. Fernando is Cuban,
married, has children, and is full o*
machismo. The play is an extended sedu* -
I ion taking place over three scenes and a
week's time Initially. Fernando is very
flirtatious showing off his muscles, and
making many suggestive remarks. As the
situation gets more and more sexual,
though. Fernando's confidence breaks
down Fernando is afraid that having sex
with another man will imply a l&ss of
masculinity.
I saw this play performed at a dramatized
reading last summer with a different actor
playing the role of Len. At that time, the

sexual undercurrents of Lens dialogue
were emphasized. This improved the first
hall of the plav Hut the current Len does a
better job in the second half of the play,
where Lens tenderness toward the very
confused Fernando is extremely important
As Fernando. Thomas-Mark does an ex
cellent job of handling the transitions in
Fernando s character during the short run
ning time of the play
Neither of the authors has passed
judgment on his characters. Curzon has
done little more than show us the seduction
of Fernando, without editorializing and
without dwelling much on what it means for
a straight man to have sex with another
man All we are aware of is the confusion
and tentativeness of the two men Yeomans
has allowed Henry to tell his own story, in
his own awkward way.
These are one-act plays, though. The top
ics are not well understood, and there are
very few precedents in literature and thea
ter for situations of this type Plain descrip
tion. without any attempts at generalization
or explanation, is not to be faulted. At this
time, it is probably better to provoke
thought than to draw conclusions.
