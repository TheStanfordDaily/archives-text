# Suit possible over lost voter registration
## 
### Victor Goetz 
Local Republicans may sue a non
partisan group that coordinated a Sep
tember voter registration drive on
campus and then lost more than 200
GOP registration cards, county chair
man Liz Sims said yesterday.
The registration drive was coordi
nated by Frontlash. a nonprofit arm of
the AFL-CIO. found the missing cards
— all but two of them for Republican
voters — on Friday, nearly a month af
ter the Oct. 6 deadline for registration.
Most of ther unregistered voters
were allowed to go to the polls anyway
after a series of court orders Tuesday.
Simms said a decision on whether to
file suit would be made late this week
or early the next. "Our attorney did
ask me to keep the names, addresses
and phone numbers in case it did come
to suit." she said.
Simms added that the Santa Clara

County district attorney's office
should investigate the circumstances
that led to the misplacement of the
voter registration forms.
Simms pointed out Tuesday's court
orders covered more than just the
Stanford group, although she was not
sure who was responsible for losing
the other cards.Some 14 more cards
were lost from a drive at a K-mart
store in the Vallco Shopping Center in
Cupertino, she said.
Andrew Goldenkranz of Frontlash
said he wasn't worried.
"It was no accident that all the
cards were of one party or another,
but it was a coincidence that they hap
pened to be Republican." he said, ex
plaining that as part of its responsi
bility as a non-partisan group
Frontlash was required to make a de
tailed report to the state, including a
breakdown of registrants by party.

The mistake occured when one of
the segregated piles wound up in a box
of blank forms, according to Gold
enkranz.
He did not find the missing forms
until last Friday, almost a month after
the Oct. 6 registration deadline. He
said he became suspicious when he
saw news reports about students who
said they had registered, but had not
received any confirmation.
"I feel like I've fulfilled my respon
sibilities under the circumstances,"
said Goldenkranz after a massive ef
fort Monday night to inform all the af
fected students that they could indeed
vote Tuesday.
Some question had been raised
about the Frontlash organization's
connection with organized labor. The
group is an arm of the American Fed
eration of Labor - Congress of In
dustrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) as

part of the union's Committee on Po
litical Education. The union has tradi
tionally backed Democratic can
didates.
"I wouldn't be surprised if one of
their volunteers decided why not
stash a stack of cards in my footiocker
and see if anyone notices.' but then got
cold feet when people started asking
questions." said graduate student Jim
Kruehterman, one of the registrants
involved in the mixup.
Michael Nye of San Jose's Central
Labor Council, the group through
which Frontlash operated, dismissed
any accusations of a "conspiracy."
"There are many groups who go out
and register voters. We do it.the Dem
ocrats do it.the Republicans do it. All
of these groups lose things regularly.
We were just honest enough to turn
I the cards) in." he said.
