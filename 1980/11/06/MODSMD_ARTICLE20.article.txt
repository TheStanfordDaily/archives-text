# 'Bullshot' dies in the suburbs
## 
### Joe Rodota 
Bullshot Crummond, now playing at the
Los Gatos Old Town Theater, is a shining ex
ample of what can happen when a good idea
hits the suburbs: almost nothing.
Bullshot Crummond enjoyed a long and
healthy run in San Francisco, where en
thusiastic audiences elevated it to a cult-ob
ject status matched only by the still-playing
Beach Blanket Babylon. Back from Los An
geles. Bullshot makes its Bay Area reprise
with the Los Gatos production, albeit with a
different and earnestly amateur cast. De
spite much hard work on the part of cast and
crew, it is painfully apparent that Bullshot
was not made for either Los Gatos theater
groups or their audiences.
The play takes place in England, shortly
after the first World War. The evil German
spy. Otto von Bruno, and his voluptuous
henchwoman. Lenya von Bruno, kidnap an
important British scientist and perform
other evil acts against the integrity of the
Crown and the rest of Brittania. On the side
of justice and tea stands Captain Hugh
Crummond. nicknamed "Bullshot" for his
keen marksmanship and mental acuity, and
his faithful foil and sidekick Algernon
These two perform evil acts against the in
tegrity of the audience.

It's actually done in Â£ood spirits, with
energetic performances by all involved.
Part of the "charm" of the San Francisco
production was the heavy dosage of schtick
and schlock, and we find ourselves inun
dated by 18-minute laughs in four voices and
six languages, and equally drawn-out hand
shakes. table-waiting and letter-unfolding.
All of this serves more to annoy than de
light, and leaves one wringing the program
in utter and unbearable frustration.
Comparison to the finely-tuned San Fran
cisco show is in some ways very unfair; ex
pecting the perfect timing and intimate at
mosphere of a San Francisco nightclub
from a converted grammar school
auditorium with a balcony is probably going
a bit too far. Yet attempting such a work as
Bullshot Crummond, well-known to all but
the most obtuse Bay Area theatergoer, en
courages such comparisons. 1 think I would
have preferred yet another local production
of The Fantasticks.
Though on the whole unenjovable, Hull
shot does contain moments of talent, even
timing. A scene during which Gary Ferry
has a conversation with himself as Otto von
Bruno and hired hit-man Salvatore Scalec
cio, involving swift behind-the-scenes cos

tume changes and highly-skilled character
izations is a real winner, as are most of the
dozen or so characters portrayed in cameo
fashion by jack-of-all-trades Ted Kupolos.
Though each falls prey to the same over-in
dulgence in meaningless business which
plagues their fellow performers, they at
least couch their schtick in enough talent to
make it digestible.
Angelo Segretto. in the title role, is un
fortunately the most annoying of the five
performers, suffering as much from bad
presence as from bad advice from Director
Armand Plato,
Minor revisions could help set things
right. Immediate spaghetti should be made
of the hokev taped background and interlude
music, to be replaced by a single piano
player. Pointless and idle overacting can be
sacrificed to the authentically funny, and
Bullshot's risque swimsuit routine can be
scrapped completely.
All in all. I can't think of any reason why
one would go to Los Gatos for an evening's
entertainment; the cruise strip has been
closed, and Bullshot Crummond is almost
too annoying to be a bore! Stay away.


Otto (Gary Ferry) and Lenya (Roberta Viscovich) plot to ruin the world diamond market in a Thea
terwest production of "Bullshot Crummond." A new production of the popular comedy runs through
Nov. 30 at the Old Town Theatre in Los Gatos.
