# Burstyn saves 'Resurrection'
## 
### Shelly Stevenson 
Love conquers all. It might seem confin
ing to base an entire feature-length film on
one simple, timeless platitude Nonethe
less. Resurrection (opening tomorrow at
the yogue in San Francisco), offers this ap
pealing conclusion while bravely taking on
the usual, troubling themes of life, death
and human existence
Though these major questions of cos
mology remain unanswered. Resurrection
offers fine performances by Ellen Burstyn
and Sam Shepard. Moreover, the movie suc
ceeds in capturing a slice of Americana, a
certain rural consciousness, neglected, per
haps nearly obliterated, in the face of urban
sprawl.
The movie is curiously stark in presenta
tion. yet, at the same time, fervently op
timistic in tone. Edna (Ellen Burstyn i loses
her husband in a car accident in which she.
too. almost dies. Badly injured, she returns
to her childhood home in rural Kansas to re
cuperate We learn that the shattering ex
perience has somehow given her the ability

to heal herselt and the sick In the process
she cures, and consorts with. Cal (Sam
Shepard). the rebellious offspring of a self
styled fire-and-brimstone lay minister who
contends Edna is in league with the Evil
One.
It is the setting that gives the film sub
stance. Solid cinematography gives a naked
look at the American countryside, warts
and all. It is portrayed as a kind of timeless,
tumbleweed purgatory where people still
cherish the Bible and somehow find the
wherewithal to lead their often grim-faced
lives.
In this stark, simple, and frequently
hostile environment. Edna discovers her
power to heal and seeks to explore and ex
plain it Burstyn does a superb job of con
veying her wonderment, frustration, and
joy with her newfound gift. Her ability to
survive her pain and grief after the acci
dent. to become stronger and turn a helping
hand to others, is the hopeful highnote of the

film.
Sam Shepard does a very passable job as
Edna's laconic, youthful-looking lover and
eventual foe Eva Ledallienne is charming
as Burstyn's wise and withered grand
mother. Unfortunately, fine acting does lit
tle to compensate for a plot that lags badly
in places Nor does it help to clarify the hazy
relationships in this film. Somehow, it is dif
ficult to understand what the source of at
traction is between the powerful Edna and
the increasingly confused Cal.
Rural Americans, too. are subject to ster
eotyping in this film. They are predominan
tly fundamentalist, superstitious, and
malevolent toward the novel, the possibly
supernatural. Resurrection is a flawed mov
ie to be sure. It is sentimental, but am
bitious. It is platitudinous, but attempts to
consider a spiritualism perhaps longed af
ter in troubled times. It is a refreshing ef
fort amidst the current spate of "Slasher"
movies.
