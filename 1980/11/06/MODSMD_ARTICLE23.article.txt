# 'Gloria'— Cassavetes out of control
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
John Cassavetes's movies are so un
yieldingly in his own style that when he
begins to imitate other people he is
praised for it. Gloria is a junk collage
made up of bits from Little Caesar, The
Godfather. Little Miss Marker and some
of the nastier film noirs of the early '50s
tlike Kiss of Heath). It's accessible, all
right, and compared to his "serious"
work —Faces, for instance, or A Woman
I 'nder the Influence — it's almost en
joyable But it's a dreadful movie.
The film begins promisingly: we see
New York in an elegantly composed pan
orama. and the first character we en
counter is a Chicano woman (Julie
Carmen) with a brutally beautiful face
who is trying to mask her vulnerability
as she deals with the terrors of returning
home to the slums.
Julie Carmen's acting has a scary
tautness. but the character is dead
before 20 minutes of the film have
elapsed: her husband (Buck Henry), it
seems, is a two-bit hood who has turned
informer, and the whole family is gunned
down by mobsters except for little Phil
(John Adames). who has been entrusted
to the care of a neighbor. Gloria (Gena
Rowlands). (We are never told why the
distraught parents don't make any at
tempt to send their daughter to safety.

too.)
Whose idea was it to cast Buck Henry
as a gangster living in a ghetto? He has
upper-middle-class-New York written
all over his face, and the only quality he
can play is the intellectual sincerity that
the Saturday Night Live writers under
cut whenever he hosts that show. He is a
witty, talented writer, but a hopeless ac
tor, and as he rushes about his apart
ment. panicking in the face of what he
knows to be certain death, we wait for
the scene to turn into parody.
The rest of the movie focuses on the re
lationship between Gloria, a tough dame
with her own mob connections, and the
child, whom Cassavetes has made not
only an obnoxious loudmouth but also
sexually precocious — a kind of dirty
Shirley Temple in drag. The idea might
be funny in a different sort of movie, but
here it jars against the traditional nar
rative elements that Cassavetes has set
up, so that instead of appreciating the
joke, we suspect that we've interpreted
the signals incorrectly.
Actually, it's Cassavetes who has his
signals crossed. He employs a gritty,re
alistic style on a movie that is really a
fairv tale: Gloria eludes the mob with
magical persistence, and she and the kid
grow to love each other despite an over
whelming personality conflict.

I don t know what was on Cassavetes's
mind when he made this picture, but I
can guess. He hadn't had a successful
film sinpe .4 Woman Under the In
fluence — in fact, his three-hour mara
thon. Opening Night, was withdrawn
before it had been released in all but a
few cities — and he must have felt the
pressure to make a "commercial" mov
ie. But Cassavetes is temperamentally
unsuited to this kind of filmmaking. He is
at home in a wildly theatrical mode —
psychodramatic soap opera — that has
excess and self-indulgence built into it.
I hate his movies (except for his early
experimental Shadows, which I think is
remarkable) but they aren't usually
laughable. In Gloria, he takes all the
schlock ideas he has acquired through os
mosis from other movies (mostly, per
haps, as an actor) and scatters them
through his own. (It is hardly surprising
that Bill Conti, the most eclectic of com
posers, got to score this picture. I heard
snatches of Gato Barbieri and Aaron
Copland, and whole sections of Michel
Legrand, in the music.)
But a movie with a strong narrative
line requires control, and Cassavetes be
haves as though he were still working
with a handheld camera: hfe chops his ac
tors to pieces, zooming in on a forearm
here, a cheekbone there.

Gena Rowlands is Gloria. Playing a
woman who is not neurotic for the first
time in one of her husband's movies, she
gives a surprisingly resilient per
formance; it is certainly her best work to
date. But as long as she restricts her ca
reer to acting in Cassavetes's films, she
will never acquire the discipline she
needs.
In A Woman Under the Influence,
Rowlands played a schizophrenic, and
she was on camera — in close-up, mostly
— for almost the entire two hours and 45
minutes. She did a number of brilliant
things, but her acting was so high-pow
ered and relentless, so idiosyncratic and
busy, that I couldn't recall any of them
afterwards. She has calmed down con
siderably in Gloria, but she still tends to
play big emotional scenes with every
muscle in her face — a peculiar kind of
mugging.
It is a relief, however, to see her in a
role that allows her to appear fairly at
tractive; she looks ravaged in most of
her pictures — that's the old cinema ver
ite notion that art is ugliness.
But if John Cassavetes wants to move
another audience besides the intellec
tuals who went to see Faces and A Wom
an Under the Influence, he will have to
rethink his entire approach to directing
Gloria is not an ugly movie, and it isn't
boring, but those are negative virtues.
