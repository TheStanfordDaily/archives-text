# Scientists reject Soviet cooperation to support dissidents
## 
### Kathy Bodovitz 
More than 60 Stanford faculty members
have joined nearly 8000 colleagues from 44
countries in pledging a moratorium on pro
fessional cooperation with the Soviet scien
tific community in protest of human rights vi
olations in the Soviet Union.
The moratorium protests violations of the
1975 Helsinki Accords guaranteeing human
rights. It took effect on May 12, 1980, the an
niversary of the founding of the Moscow Hel
sinki Watch group which monitors Soviet
compliance with the Helsinki Accords.
Three incidents represent the general treat
ment of dissident Soviet scientists that the sci
entific community is protesting.
In 1978. Soviet physicist Yori Orlov. Helsin
ki Watch chairman, was arrested on charges
of anti-Soviet activity and sentenced to seven
years hard labor in prison camp, followed by
five years of internal exile. »
Charged with high treason in the form of es-

pionage, computer scientist Anatoly
Shcharansky was also arrested in 1978 and
sentenced to 13 years in prison at hard labor.
In January. 1980. physicist Andrei Sakharov
was arrested and exiled to Gorki. U.S.S.R.,
for the crime of expressing his personal opin
ions.
One committee circulating petitions of pro
test is a group called SOS. Originally "Scien
tists for Orlov and Shcharansky," the group
changed its name when Sakarov was exiled.
SOS now stands for "Sakharov, Orlov and
Shcharansky."
SOS has gathered signatures from top pro
fessionals in their fields, covering a wide
spectrum of expertise and political views. The
signers include 32 Nobel laureates. 187 mem
bers of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
and 82 Fellows of the Royal Society of London.
Stanford signers include Nobel Prize win
ners Paul Flory, chemistry; Arthur
Romberg, biochemistry. Kenneth Arrow and

Milton Friedman, economics and professors
Seymour Martin Lipset, sociology; Henry
Kaplan, cancer research; and Marvin
Chodorow, applied physics.
SOS signers pledged "a moratorium on pro
fessional cooperation with the Soviet scien
tific community for a period beginning May
12. 1980. the anniversary of the founding of the
Moscow Helsinki Watch Group, and ending at
the completion of the November 1980 Madrid
Conference to monitor the Helsinki Accords.
"During this period we will not visit the So
viet Union or welcome Soviet scientists and
engineers to our laboratories, - ' the petition
stated.
Paul Flory, an active participant in the SOS
organization, said he was revolted at the ac
tions of the Soviet Union towards its scien
tists. He said. "We are eager to do anything
we can to help them."
Flory said he believes that SOS is helping:
"Andrei Sakharov has communicated with us

and said we hit the right nail." Flory had per
sonal communication with Sakharov before he
was imprisoned and has spoken to a friend of
Shcharansky. who said that SOS efforts kept
him out of jail.
"No one can say for sure what would have
happened if we had ignored the situation, but
they (Soviet dissidents) say our efforts are not
in vain," said Flory.
"I'm eager to do whatever I can to help free
Sakharov from exile and to help dissident sci
entists," agreed Arthur Romberg. He said he
believes that movements like SOS help, while
silence does not.
SOS has been attacked on Soviet radio and
television and in Soviet magazines, all of
which are state-controlled Morev Schapira, a
physicist who signed the petition, said Soviet
officials would not denounce the pledge unless
they thought it was effective.
SOS is not only protesting the treatment of
dissident Soviet scientists but the conduct of

scientific relations with other countries. The
Russians get enormous benefits from contact
with American scientists, which they value
highly.
While the moratorium has been supported
bv many scientists, some do not agree with
the approach. Sidney Drell, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
said he agrees with showing opposition to So
viet actions, but does not believe a boycott will
solve the problem.
"I find myself troubled and want to express
support for my colleagues." Drell said, but
added he prefers to look at each case on an in
dividual basis.
The SOS pledge states that the moratorium
will end at the completion of the Madrid Con
ference which begins this month. Schapira
said SOS is not intended as a full boycott to go
on forever. If the Soviet Union improves its
policies, the organization will let relations re
turn to normal.

The SOS pledge states that the moratorium
will end at the completion of the Madrid Con
ference which begins this month. Schapira
said SOS is not intended as a full boycott to go
on forever. If the Soviet Union improves its
policies, the organization will let relations re
turn to normal.
More than 60 Stanford faculty members
have joined nearly 8000 colleagues from 44
countries in pledging a moratorium on pro
fessional cooperation with the Soviet scien
tific community in protest of human rights vi
olations in the Soviet Union.
The moratorium protests violations of the
1975 Helsinki Accords guaranteeing human
rights. It took effect on May 12, 1980, the an
niversary of the founding of the Moscow Hel
sinki Watch group which monitors Soviet
compliance with the Helsinki Accords.
Three incidents represent the general treat
ment of dissident Soviet scientists that the sci
entific community is protesting.
In 1978. Soviet physicist Yori Orlov. Helsin
ki Watch chairman, was arrested on charges
of anti-Soviet activity and sentenced to seven
years hard labor in prison camp, followed by
five years of internal exile. »
Charged with high treason in the form of es-

pionage, computer scientist Anatoly
Shcharansky was also arrested in 1978 and
sentenced to 13 years in prison at hard labor.
In January. 1980. physicist Andrei Sakharov
was arrested and exiled to Gorki. U.S.S.R.,
for the crime of expressing his personal opin
ions.
One committee circulating petitions of pro
test is a group called SOS. Originally "Scien
tists for Orlov and Shcharansky," the group
changed its name when Sakarov was exiled.
SOS now stands for "Sakharov, Orlov and
Shcharansky."
SOS has gathered signatures from top pro
fessionals in their fields, covering a wide
spectrum of expertise and political views. The
signers include 32 Nobel laureates. 187 mem
bers of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences
and 82 Fellows of the Royal Society of London.
Stanford signers include Nobel Prize win
ners Paul Flory, chemistry; Arthur
Romberg, biochemistry. Kenneth Arrow and

Milton Friedman, economics and professors
Seymour Martin Lipset, sociology; Henry
Kaplan, cancer research; and Marvin
Chodorow, applied physics.
SOS signers pledged "a moratorium on pro
fessional cooperation with the Soviet scien
tific community for a period beginning May
12. 1980. the anniversary of the founding of the
Moscow Helsinki Watch Group, and ending at
the completion of the November 1980 Madrid
Conference to monitor the Helsinki Accords.
"During this period we will not visit the So
viet Union or welcome Soviet scientists and
engineers to our laboratories, - ' the petition
stated.
Paul Flory, an active participant in the SOS
organization, said he was revolted at the ac
tions of the Soviet Union towards its scien
tists. He said. "We are eager to do anything
we can to help them."
Flory said he believes that SOS is helping:
"Andrei Sakharov has communicated with us

and said we hit the right nail." Flory had per
sonal communication with Sakharov before he
was imprisoned and has spoken to a friend of
Shcharansky. who said that SOS efforts kept
him out of jail.
"No one can say for sure what would have
happened if we had ignored the situation, but
they (Soviet dissidents) say our efforts are not
in vain," said Flory.
"I'm eager to do whatever I can to help free
Sakharov from exile and to help dissident sci
entists," agreed Arthur Romberg. He said he
believes that movements like SOS help, while
silence does not.
SOS has been attacked on Soviet radio and
television and in Soviet magazines, all of
which are state-controlled Morev Schapira, a
physicist who signed the petition, said Soviet
officials would not denounce the pledge unless
they thought it was effective.
SOS is not only protesting the treatment of
dissident Soviet scientists but the conduct of

scientific relations with other countries. The
Russians get enormous benefits from contact
with American scientists, which they value
highly.
While the moratorium has been supported
bv many scientists, some do not agree with
the approach. Sidney Drell, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC),
said he agrees with showing opposition to So
viet actions, but does not believe a boycott will
solve the problem.
"I find myself troubled and want to express
support for my colleagues." Drell said, but
added he prefers to look at each case on an in
dividual basis.
