Impasse continues in Iran-Iraq war
Baghdad. Iraq — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Ira
nian leader, vowed yesterday to continue the war with Iraq
"until the infidels are defeated" and said that although
many Iranian youths have been killed in the 7-week-old
conflict, "this is for Islam."
Khomeini's defiant call for continued fighting seemed to
be a direct response to a speech Tuesday by President Sad
dam Hussein of Iraq offering an early end to the war. but
pledging to keep fighting indefinitely unless Iraq's "na
tional rights" are recognized.
With both leaders thus proclaiming their determination
to continue the war until the other gives in. they seemed to
have reached a total impasse that promised a long and
costly war of attrition with no end in sight.
With the war completing its 46th day.the confrontation
also appeared stalemated on the ground. Observers here
said both sides seemed prepared to continue fighting in
Khuzestan Province into the winter.
Iran continues hostage negotiation
Paris — Iran's revolutionary leaders, from the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on down, appear to have
genuinely decided to end the crisis over the 52 American
hostages that their militant followers have held for more
than a year, diplomats and other analysts in Tehran say.
The main reason, they say. is that Iran's punishing war
with Iraq has abruptly driven home the cost of interna
tional isolation to Khomeini.
Interviewed by telephone from Paris, the diplomats and
several Iranian sources said the election of Ronald Re
agan as president might delay the release of the hostages
— but only if Reagan proves less eager to bargain over
Iran's conditions than President Jimmy Carter.
Otherwise, they said, except for possible technical
hitches during the transition to a new U.S. administration,
the election should have no effect on the hostage nego
tiations.
The Iranians wanted to use the deadline of the American
elections to force quick concessions from Carter, but pro
duced their conditions too late for Carter to act on them,

got to go." and to the administration building.
In addition to demanding the removal of ROTC from

Bus kidnapping conviction upheld
San Francisco — The conviction and life sentences of
three men in the kidnapping of a busload of school children
has been upheld by a state court. which also ruled the three
should be eligible for parole.
The state Court of Appeal voted '2-1 Tuesday to reject
findings that three of the schoolchildren from Chowchilla
had suffered bodily harm, findings that had ruled out par
ole for James Schoenfeld. 28. and his brother. Richard
Schoenfeld. 27. both of Atherton. and Frederick Newhall
Woods. 28. Woodside.
They were convicted of kidnapping 26 children and their
driver from the Central California town on July 15. 1976.
then taking them to a Livermore quarry and burying them
alive in a moving van.
The victims dug their way out after 27 hours in captivity
and 16 hours in the van.
Each of the defendants pled guilty to 27 separate counts
of kidnaping for ransom They received concurrent sen
tences of life on each count.
The court said that its affirmation of the life sentences
means that there is no need for further court proceedings
"and the likely revival of painful but now faded childhood
memories."
The trial court agreed with the prosecution that some of
the victims had gone through "an ordeal of terror" and
that nose bleeds, fainting and stomach aches showed the
harm involved.
However, the appeal court said the evidence did not
show bodily harm within the law. and thus, life terms
without possibility of parole may not stand.
Election pushes Dow up 16 points
New York — The stock market surged upward in near
record trading yesterday as Wall Street responded to the
election of Ronald Reagan as president and the Re
publicans' dramatic gains in Congress.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up more than
27 points at mid-dav. later dropped back to finish with a
15.96-point gain at 953.16.
Even with the afternoon retreat, however, the average
still showed its best gain since it jumped 30.72 points last
April 22.
New York Stock Exchange volume was estimated at
something more than 79 million shares, just shy of the re
cord of 81.62 million set on Oct. 10 of last year.

Impasse continues in Iran-Iraq war
Baghdad. Iraq — Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Ira
nian leader, vowed yesterday to continue the war with Iraq
"until the infidels are defeated" and said that although
many Iranian youths have been killed in the 7-week-old
conflict, "this is for Islam."
Khomeini's defiant call for continued fighting seemed to
be a direct response to a speech Tuesday by President Sad
dam Hussein of Iraq offering an early end to the war. but
pledging to keep fighting indefinitely unless Iraq's "na
tional rights" are recognized.
With both leaders thus proclaiming their determination
to continue the war until the other gives in. they seemed to
have reached a total impasse that promised a long and
costly war of attrition with no end in sight.
With the war completing its 46th day.the confrontation
also appeared stalemated on the ground. Observers here
said both sides seemed prepared to continue fighting in
Khuzestan Province into the winter.
Iran continues hostage negotiation
Paris — Iran's revolutionary leaders, from the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on down, appear to have
genuinely decided to end the crisis over the 52 American
hostages that their militant followers have held for more
than a year, diplomats and other analysts in Tehran say.
The main reason, they say. is that Iran's punishing war
with Iraq has abruptly driven home the cost of interna
tional isolation to Khomeini.
Interviewed by telephone from Paris, the diplomats and
several Iranian sources said the election of Ronald Re
agan as president might delay the release of the hostages
— but only if Reagan proves less eager to bargain over
Iran's conditions than President Jimmy Carter.
Otherwise, they said, except for possible technical
hitches during the transition to a new U.S. administration,
the election should have no effect on the hostage nego
tiations.
The Iranians wanted to use the deadline of the American
elections to force quick concessions from Carter, but pro
duced their conditions too late for Carter to act on them,

The apparently spontaneous entrance into California

got to go." and to the administration building.
In addition to demanding the removal of ROTC from

Bus kidnapping conviction upheld
San Francisco — The conviction and life sentences of
three men in the kidnapping of a busload of school children
has been upheld by a state court. which also ruled the three
should be eligible for parole.
The state Court of Appeal voted '2-1 Tuesday to reject
findings that three of the schoolchildren from Chowchilla
had suffered bodily harm, findings that had ruled out par
ole for James Schoenfeld. 28. and his brother. Richard
Schoenfeld. 27. both of Atherton. and Frederick Newhall
Woods. 28. Woodside.
They were convicted of kidnapping 26 children and their
driver from the Central California town on July 15. 1976.
then taking them to a Livermore quarry and burying them
alive in a moving van.
The victims dug their way out after 27 hours in captivity
and 16 hours in the van.
Each of the defendants pled guilty to 27 separate counts
of kidnaping for ransom They received concurrent sen
tences of life on each count.
The court said that its affirmation of the life sentences
means that there is no need for further court proceedings
"and the likely revival of painful but now faded childhood
memories."
The trial court agreed with the prosecution that some of
the victims had gone through "an ordeal of terror" and
that nose bleeds, fainting and stomach aches showed the
harm involved.
However, the appeal court said the evidence did not
show bodily harm within the law. and thus, life terms
without possibility of parole may not stand.
