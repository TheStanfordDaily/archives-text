Washington — President-elect
Ronald Reagan took command yester
day in a conservative dominion that
will stretch from the White House to a
new Republican Senate, his lieuten
ants vowing a wholesale house
cleaning of officeholders installed by
the Democrats.
President Jimmy Carter, over
whelmingly repudiated by the voters
in Tuesday's election, retreated to
Camp David. Md., saying he needed
time to be alone and think.
Carter said he would work for a
smooth transition from his one-term
administration to the one Reagan will
begin on Jan. 20, when he is in
augurated 40th president of the United
States. At nearly 70, he will be the
oldest man ever to take that oath of of
fice.

As the nationwide tally in a low
turnout election neared completion,
the dimensions of the Reagan land
slide — and mandate — took on clear
shape.
With 99 percent of the precincts
counted. Reagan had 43 million votes,
or 51 percent . Carter 34.7 million or 41
percent: independent .John Anderson
5.5 million or 7 percent. Libertarian
Ed Clark 880.000 or 1 percent, and
Citizens Party nominee Barry Com
moner 220.000 or .25 percent.
That translated to 489 electoral
votes for Reagan, who needed 270 to
win. Carter had only 49.
The former California governor
swept every one of the 10 biggest
states, winning even in such solid
Democratic territory as Massachu
setts. Even Carter's native South, ex
cept for his home state of Georgia,
turned against him.
Reagan captured 44 states; Carter
won only Georgia. West Virginia,
Rhode Island. Maryland. Minnesota,
Hawaii and the District of Columbia.
Carried on Reagan's coattails. and
the campaign drive mobilized by
"New Right" conservative organiza
tions. Republicans seized Senate con
trol for the first time in a quarter-cen
tury.
They turned out of office eight Dem
ocratic senators, among them such
liberal stalwarts as George McGov
ern, Frank Church. Warren
Magnuson. Gavlord Nelson and Birch
Bavh.
Republicans had won 52 Senate
seats and led for another in Georgia.
When the 97th Congress takes office on
Jan. 3. they will run the Senate for the
first time since 1955. That was a net
gain of at least 11 seats, probably 12.
for the Republicans.
The GOP scored a startling 33-seat
gain in the House, where Democrats
nonetheless held onto their majority.
Speaker Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts
called the election a Democratic dis

aster.
The new House will be made up of
243 Democrats and 192 Republicans.
Only 52.3 percent of eligible Ameri
cans cast ballots on Tuesday, the low
est turnout in 32 years. The total vote
of more than 84 million was a record,
but it represented a decline in the per
centage of those who cast ballots from
the 54.4 percent of 1976.
Reagan spent Tuesday at his Pacif
ic Palisades home, conferring with
vice president-elect George Bush, who
Hew in from Houston.
Aides in Los Angeles said Reagan
already was at work on transition
planning, and would announce at a
news conference today the team that
will represent him in arranging the
change in government. Carter said his
chief of staff. Jack Watson, would
manage the transition for the outgoing
Democratic administration.
Kdwin Meese. chief of staff for Re
agan. said the new administration
would replace all appointed agency
heads in Washington. A new adminis
tration always installs its own appoin
tees. but usually with a holdover or
two for the sake of unity and continui
ty. particularly in the case of people or
positions considered non-partisan.
"Out of humanitarian concern for
all the time and effort they've put in
recently, we think the only decent
thing to do is to allow them a well-de
served rest.'" Meese sai J in announc
ing that this turnover will be total.
He also said Reagan would not be
naming Cabinet members before late
November or early December. He
said Reagan aides would screen poten
tial Cabinet nominees, and submit the
names of three to five top prospects
for each job to the president-elect.
Reagan planned to take a 10-dav
respite at his Santa Barbara. Calif.,
ranch before he comes to Washington.
Carter told reporters in the Oval Of
fice that he is at ease, plans to write
his memoirs and will help Reagan in
every way he can. now and after the
new administration takes office.
He said he believes the troubled
economy, the Iranian hostage situ
ation and allegations of impropriety
against members of his official family
all had contributed to his defeat.
The shift of power in Congress was
startling

The takeover means that Re
publicans. not Democrats, will be
chairmen of the Senate committees in
the 97th Congress. It makes Sen. How
ard Baker Jr of Tennessee the incom
ing majority leader.
The upheaval in the House was
deep, but not enough to undo the Dem
ocratic majority.
Voters ousted four congressmen im
plicated in the Abscam scandal; an
other survived.
"There is no way the next Congress
is going to resemble the last." said
Rep. Guy Vander Jagt. chairman of
the House OOP campaign committee.
"Democratic leaders who managed to
survive had the bejesus scared out of
them."
Republicans also gained gov

ernorships in four states, and wound
up in command of 23 statehouses. the
most they have held in a decade.
While Anderson's independent pres
idential campaign was shut out in the
electoral vote, he got more than
enough popular votes to qualify for
federal campaign subsidies to help
pay off $5 million in debts.
An Associated Press-NBC News
poll of voters leaving their precincts
on Tuesday showed that Carter's per
formance in office had become the key
issue Reagan said it should be.

their decisions were based in part on
the conviction that Carter had done a

Krom the Daily wire services
Washington — President-elect
Ronald Reagan took command yester
day in a conservative dominion that
will stretch from the White House to a
new Republican Senate, his lieuten
ants vowing a wholesale house
cleaning of officeholders installed by
the Democrats.
President Jimmy Carter, over
whelmingly repudiated by the voters
in Tuesday's election, retreated to
Camp David. Md., saying he needed
time to be alone and think.
Carter said he would work for a
smooth transition from his one-term
administration to the one Reagan will
begin on Jan. 20, when he is in
augurated 40th president of the United
States. At nearly 70, he will be the
oldest man ever to take that oath of of
fice.

As the nationwide tally in a low
turnout election neared completion,
the dimensions of the Reagan land
slide — and mandate — took on clear
shape.
With 99 percent of the precincts
counted. Reagan had 43 million votes,
or 51 percent . Carter 34.7 million or 41
percent: independent .John Anderson
5.5 million or 7 percent. Libertarian
Ed Clark 880.000 or 1 percent, and
Citizens Party nominee Barry Com
moner 220.000 or .25 percent.
That translated to 489 electoral
votes for Reagan, who needed 270 to
win. Carter had only 49.
The former California governor
swept every one of the 10 biggest
states, winning even in such solid
Democratic territory as Massachu
setts. Even Carter's native South, ex
cept for his home state of Georgia,
turned against him.
Reagan captured 44 states; Carter
won only Georgia. West Virginia,
Rhode Island. Maryland. Minnesota,
Hawaii and the District of Columbia.
Carried on Reagan's coattails. and
the campaign drive mobilized by
"New Right" conservative organiza
tions. Republicans seized Senate con
trol for the first time in a quarter-cen
tury.
They turned out of office eight Dem
ocratic senators, among them such
liberal stalwarts as George McGov
ern, Frank Church. Warren
Magnuson. Gavlord Nelson and Birch
Bavh.
Republicans had won 52 Senate
seats and led for another in Georgia.
When the 97th Congress takes office on
Jan. 3. they will run the Senate for the
first time since 1955. That was a net
gain of at least 11 seats, probably 12.
for the Republicans.
The GOP scored a startling 33-seat
gain in the House, where Democrats
nonetheless held onto their majority.
Speaker Tip O'Neill of Massachusetts
called the election a Democratic dis

aster.
The new House will be made up of
243 Democrats and 192 Republicans.
Only 52.3 percent of eligible Ameri
cans cast ballots on Tuesday, the low
est turnout in 32 years. The total vote
of more than 84 million was a record,
but it represented a decline in the per
centage of those who cast ballots from
the 54.4 percent of 1976.
Reagan spent Tuesday at his Pacif
ic Palisades home, conferring with
vice president-elect George Bush, who
Hew in from Houston.
Aides in Los Angeles said Reagan
already was at work on transition
planning, and would announce at a
news conference today the team that
will represent him in arranging the
change in government. Carter said his
chief of staff. Jack Watson, would
manage the transition for the outgoing
Democratic administration.
Kdwin Meese. chief of staff for Re
agan. said the new administration
would replace all appointed agency
heads in Washington. A new adminis
tration always installs its own appoin
tees. but usually with a holdover or
two for the sake of unity and continui
ty. particularly in the case of people or
positions considered non-partisan.
"Out of humanitarian concern for
all the time and effort they've put in
recently, we think the only decent
thing to do is to allow them a well-de
served rest.'" Meese sai J in announc
ing that this turnover will be total.
He also said Reagan would not be
naming Cabinet members before late
November or early December. He
said Reagan aides would screen poten
tial Cabinet nominees, and submit the
names of three to five top prospects
for each job to the president-elect.
Reagan planned to take a 10-dav
respite at his Santa Barbara. Calif.,
ranch before he comes to Washington.
Carter told reporters in the Oval Of
fice that he is at ease, plans to write
his memoirs and will help Reagan in
every way he can. now and after the
new administration takes office.
He said he believes the troubled
economy, the Iranian hostage situ
ation and allegations of impropriety
against members of his official family
all had contributed to his defeat.
The shift of power in Congress was
startling

The takeover means that Re
publicans. not Democrats, will be
chairmen of the Senate committees in
the 97th Congress. It makes Sen. How
ard Baker Jr of Tennessee the incom
ing majority leader.
The upheaval in the House was
deep, but not enough to undo the Dem
ocratic majority.
Voters ousted four congressmen im
plicated in the Abscam scandal; an
other survived.
"There is no way the next Congress
is going to resemble the last." said
Rep. Guy Vander Jagt. chairman of
the House OOP campaign committee.
"Democratic leaders who managed to
survive had the bejesus scared out of
them."
Republicans also gained gov

ernorships in four states, and wound
up in command of 23 statehouses. the
most they have held in a decade.
While Anderson's independent pres
idential campaign was shut out in the
electoral vote, he got more than
enough popular votes to qualify for
federal campaign subsidies to help
pay off $5 million in debts.
An Associated Press-NBC News
poll of voters leaving their precincts
on Tuesday showed that Carter's per
formance in office had become the key
issue Reagan said it should be.

their decisions were based in part on
the conviction that Carter had done a
