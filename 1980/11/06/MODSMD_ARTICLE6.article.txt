### Gary Rosenzweig 
The Volunteers in Asia ex
perienee can promote cultural
understanding in its most fun
damental sense." said Buzz
Thompson in a recent interview.
Thompson, a former drum
major of the Stanford Band,
spoke about his experiences in
Asia as a volunteer, a field of
ficer for a philanthropic com
munity development group, and
as an administrator of refugee
(amps in Thailand.
As a Stanford undergraduate.
Thompson spent six months in
Taiwan teaching English at a
YMCA in Taiehung through the
Volunteers in Asia program
(VIA). He received his degree
m history, focusing on Chinese
studies, and began working in
the campus VIA office in 1975,
recruiting, teaching, book
keeping and making travel ar
rangements for new volunteers.
Through his connections in
VIA. Thompson went to work
lor a small American founda
tion. Operation Help, in 1977.
aiding in the facilitation of
grants for community develop
ment projects in southeast Asia.
As a field officer, he travelled
between Thailand. Indonesia

and the Phillipines.
While working with Operation
Help Thompson met people in
volved with refugee work in
Thailand. In November. 1979. he

Daily profile

was hired by the United .Nations
High Commissioner for Refu
gees (UNHCRi to administer
refugee camps in Thailand near
the border of Kampuchea, for
merly named Cambodia.
Back in the United States for
only a fe\y months. Thompson
will return to Asia this January
as a VIA volunteer. He will
again teach English at the In
stitute of Mining and
Metallurgy in Kun Ming, in the
Yunan province of The People's
Republic of China.
Trying to help
"Being a VIA volunteer can
be frustrating." Thompson
said "It's hard to see how
you're solving the problems of
southeast Asian countries.
"VTA is based on a two-prong
approach We go to help, but we
also go to learn." he continued.
Because English is the de fac
to international language of
Asia. English teachers are in
high demand throughout Asia.

"Frankly, we can be good
English teachers, and there is
not much else we can do to help
the people in the poorest areas
of Asia." Thompson explained.
Solutions from within
After many years of direct ex
perience. Thompson Ivs con
cluded that "most of the prob
lems in southeast Asian ci/<n
tries are social and political.
Most of the solutions to these
problems have to come from
within these countries."
Hence, "it is difficult for for
eigners to make significant
positive contributions, especial
ly young and inexperienced,
albeit good mtentioned. peo
ple." Thompson said
Yet VIA people can teach val
uable English skills and can
learn for themselves what life is
like in Asia, furthermore, the
me;e presence of a concerned
young American helps to pro
mote understanding between
different cultures.
"We represent an alternative
model for what Americans are
like. Most images (of Ameri
cans! come from television and
movies, and are far too stere
otypical and simplistic."
Thompson said.

"On a microcosmic level,
personal interaction between
VIA volunteers and the Asians
with whom we work can be
more valuable than selling them
K-15s or building hydro-electric
dams." he added.
Last Thursday. Thompson
gave a slide show and talk about
his experiences as a refugee
camp administrator for the
UNHCR.
After showing slides of Khao I
Dang and Sao Keo, the two refu
gee camps he worked at,
Thompson discussed the future
of the Kampuchean refugees.
"They can either go back to
Kampuchea, settle down in
Thailand, or be resettled outside
Thailand or Kampuchea."
Thompson said.
Fear of return
But there are problems, of
course.
"Right now. it is difficult or
impossible for many of these
people to return to Kampuchea.
They fear for their lives under
Communism or the Vietnamese
presently in Kampuchea." he
said.
The Thais are hesitant to ac
cept the Kampuchean refugees
as citizens primarily because
they see the refugees as a secur
ity risk," he continued.
"Although many (refugees)
have come here to the United
States, resettlement is un
realistic for the vast majority.
Most of the refugees are small
farmers and fishermen," he
said.
Thompson noted that the
United States has the most fair
refugee acceptance policy of
those countries that even accept
refugees, such as Canada,
France and Australia.

like. Most images (of Ameri
cans! come from television and
movies, and are far too stere
otypical and simplistic."
Thompson said.

"On a microcosmic level,
personal interaction between
VIA volunteers and the Asians
with whom we work can be
more valuable than selling them
K-15s or building hydro-electric
dams." he added.
Last Thursday. Thompson
gave a slide show and talk about
his experiences as a refugee
camp administrator for the
UNHCR.
After showing slides of Khao I
Dang and Sao Keo, the two refu
gee camps he worked at,
Thompson discussed the future
of the Kampuchean refugees.
"They can either go back to
Kampuchea, settle down in
Thailand, or be resettled outside
Thailand or Kampuchea."
Thompson said.
Fear of return
But there are problems, of
course.
"Right now. it is difficult or
impossible for many of these
people to return to Kampuchea.
They fear for their lives under
Communism or the Vietnamese
presently in Kampuchea." he
said.
The Thais are hesitant to ac
cept the Kampuchean refugees
as citizens primarily because
they see the refugees as a secur
ity risk," he continued.
"Although many (refugees)
have come here to the United
States, resettlement is un
realistic for the vast majority.
Most of the refugees are small
farmers and fishermen," he
said.
Thompson noted that the
United States has the most fair
refugee acceptance policy of
those countries that even accept
refugees, such as Canada,
France and Australia.

Daily profile

was hired by the United .Nations
High Commissioner for Refu
gees (UNHCRi to administer
refugee camps in Thailand near
the border of Kampuchea, for
merly named Cambodia.
Back in the United States for
only a fe\y months. Thompson
will return to Asia this January
as a VIA volunteer. He will
again teach English at the In
stitute of Mining and
Metallurgy in Kun Ming, in the
Yunan province of The People's
Republic of China.
Trying to help
"Being a VIA volunteer can
be frustrating." Thompson
said "It's hard to see how
you're solving the problems of
southeast Asian countries.
"VTA is based on a two-prong
approach We go to help, but we
also go to learn." he continued.
Because English is the de fac
to international language of
Asia. English teachers are in
high demand throughout Asia.

"Frankly, we can be good
English teachers, and there is
not much else we can do to help
the people in the poorest areas
of Asia." Thompson explained.
Solutions from within
After many years of direct ex
perience. Thompson Ivs con
cluded that "most of the prob
lems in southeast Asian ci/<n
tries are social and political.
Most of the solutions to these
problems have to come from
within these countries."
Hence, "it is difficult for for
eigners to make significant
positive contributions, especial
ly young and inexperienced,
albeit good mtentioned. peo
ple." Thompson said
Yet VIA people can teach val
uable English skills and can
learn for themselves what life is
like in Asia, furthermore, the
me;e presence of a concerned
young American helps to pro
mote understanding between
different cultures.
"We represent an alternative
model for what Americans are
like. Most images (of Ameri
cans! come from television and
movies, and are far too stere
otypical and simplistic."
