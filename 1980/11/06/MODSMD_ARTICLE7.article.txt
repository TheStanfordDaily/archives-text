Paris â€” As the United States nears a decision
that could once again make it a supplier of arms to
Iran. France is positioning itself more strongly
behind Iraq in the belief that it will be the more
powerful regional power after the fighting has
ended.
The twin developments have fueled fears
among some in France that the Persian Gulf con
flict could become one between French and Amer
ican arms in the hands of the Iraqis and Iranians,
respectively.
Some key French officials Monday privately
expressed what they said was their shock over
U.S. acceptance of the "blackmail" of a swap of
American hostages for U.S. spare parts for Ira
nian weapons.
French analysts said that the U.S. supply of
parts for planes and helicopters to Iran can only
serve to prolong the war and further contribute to
the destruction of Iraq's petroleum production fa
cilities.
These analysts believe, however, that even
should Iraqi President Saddam Hussein fall from
power. Iraq is a far better bet for future use
lulness than Iran, because Iraq is a highly cen
tralized state that can be counted on to make a
vigorous reconstruction effort and resume pro
ducing oil for export as soon as the war ends. Iran,
on the other hand, according to these analysts, has
destroyed its own state structure and must re
build that before it can do anything else
increasing openness
Despite its officially proclaimed neutrality in
the Persian Gulf war. France has been backing
Iraq with increasing openness.
"France is Iraq's only Western friend," one of
the highest ranking officials here said last week.
Monday another top insider said, "Why can't
you Americans understand that Iraq is the shield
against the Soviets in the gulf? The greatest
threat to destabilization in the gulf would be the

collapse of Iraq."
While three-quarters of Iraq's equipment is still
Soviet. Iraq's most recent and modern equipment
is French. France sold Iraq $2 billion worth of
arms in 1977 and 1978 alone. Soviet help to Iraq
during the war has been minor.
Possible Mirage sales
In the face of official no-comments, there have
been persistent French press notes that France is
going all-out to deliver material to Iraq. But re
ports that France is about to deliver some of the 60
advanced Mirage F1 jets that Iraq contracted for
delivery starting in mid-November seem pre
mature.
Nevertheless, the French are understood to be
supplying a long list of less dramatic items like
helicopter spare parts, antitank rockets, field
guns and parts for medium tanks.
France is clearly doing everything it can to pre
vent the downfall of Saddam Hussein and seems to
be looking for ways to help him bring the war to an
end before it is too late for his political survival.
Complicated efforts
U.S. military help to Iran, which is pledged to
overthrow him. would undoubtedly complicate
French efforts. Top French officials claim that
the Soviets are working to eliminate the Iraqi
leader and to replace him with someone they
could control.
In the French view, the Soviets are now betting
on Iran and will work for the preservation of Ira
nian national unity because the Islamic revolution
will be a permanent threat to the moderate pro-
Western Arab regimes in the Persian Gulf region.
The French are prepared to move in elsewhere
in the gulf besides Iraq. An agreement was signed
Sunday by French Interior Minister Christian
Bonnet with Saudi Arabia to train Saudi internal
security officers and provide equipment for their
forces, functions that used to be performed by the
United States.
