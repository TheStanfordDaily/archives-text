Maseru, Lesotho â€” This small mountain
kingdom encompassed by South Africa does
not seem important enough to attract 45
diplomatic missions from other countries,
but they are here because a black David is
confronting a white Goliath.
The David is Lesotho's prime minister,
Chief Leabua Jonathan, a tubby, balding
black statesman who torments the white
Goliath that surrounds his kingdom.
One of South Africa's most outspoken
critics, Jonathan has opposed as racist the
South African program of establishing inde
pendent tribal homelands, and he insists
that South Africa illegally lays claim to ter
ritories that rightfully belong to Lesotho.
Jonathan, who is 64, has attracted the
sympathy and support of countries of all po
litical leanings, both East and West. They
all have missions here to dispense millions
of dollars in aid to this Maryland-size
enclave that has few natural resources and
little fertile land.
Friend of all the world
To show that he is a friend of all the world
except South Africa, Jonathan has estab
lished diplomatic relations with both Chinas
and both Koreas. He established relations
with Cuba last year and the Soviet Union
this year. He is well-supported by the non-
Communist world as well. The United

States provided $13.1 million in aid last
year, including $800,000 for Peace Corps
programs.
International organizations put $96.6 mil
lion into the country in 1979, much of the
money spent for roads, to replace the foot
paths and pony trails, traditionally traveled
by Lesotho's 1.2 million people in their bleak
upland plateaus.
Ireland is Lesotho's most energetic
diplomatic partner. Sixty representatives
from Dublin are here to administer aid
projects, working in the barren hills and
eroded valleys just as enthusiastically as
they would in the green pastures and peat
bogs of Eire, according to Irish Counsul
Martin Greene. One project seeks to cross
Ireland's famed Conemara pony with the
Lesotho pony.
Problems to face
But all is not going well for Jonathan,
even though he has demonstrated a virtuoso
touch for capitalizing on his geographical
position in the midst of South Africa's white
supremacist society.
For one thing, Lesotho's value to the foes
of South African racism as an example to
others would be enhanced it its own govern
ment were democratic. The country has not
had an election since 1970, when Jonathan,
alleging irregularities in the voting, stopped
the ballot counting, suspended the constitu

tion. jailed his opponents and took power.
Although Jonathan recently offered a
qualified amnesty to his political foes, few
have accepted. His principal rival, Ntsu
Mokhehle, is in exile in nearby Zambia and
directs a low-scale but persistent guerrilla
war against the government. Last week
guerrillas attacked houses in a town 38
miles northeast of here, seriously wounding
a brother of the prime minister and killing
three women.
Armed followers
Mokhehle says he has a thousand armed
followers scattered in small units through
Lesotho's mountains, their leaders trained
in Libya.
To counter. Jonathan has enlarged his Po
lice Mobile Unit to 1500 men, and equipped it
with a few helicopters and light aircraft.
Such support reportedly was provided by
South Africa, and demonstrates Jonathan's
ambivalent relations with the country he
says he hates.
As an enclave, Lesotho remains almost
totally dependent on South Africa for its ec
onomic well-being. When the South African
government is upset by a black-power move
by Jonathan, it sometimes lowers the
priority for movement of Lesotho freight
over South African railroads to South
African ports. The same slow handling has
been given Lesotho's imports.
