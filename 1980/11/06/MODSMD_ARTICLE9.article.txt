# Unfreezing Iranian assets here may be long, difficult process

From the Dailv wire services
New York — Iranian assets
were frozen with the stroke of a
presidential pen in a simple and
sudden diplomatic move last
November. But unfreezing
them could prove to be a long
and complicated process.
Here are some questions and
answers on the issue.
How much money is in
volved?
The U.S. Treasury's original
estimate was $8 billion. More
recent private estimates exceed
$13 billion. It is an imprecise es
timate because many of the as
sets are in gold and securities
that change in value. And some
of the assets, those held by
American banks in their foreign
branches, have been seized and
liquidated by those banks to sat
isfy loans in which Iran has been
in default since the rupture of
relations with the United States.
Are the assets in the United
States all in one place? Could
they be turned over to the Ira
nians easily?
No. President Jimmy Carter
did not actually seize the assets,
although presidents have such
emergency power. He froze
them, which meant that the var
ious banks that held Iranian gov
ernment deposits, for instance,
could not allow them to be
withdrawn.
What exactly are these as
sets?
Probably the biggest single
chunk of them is the approx
imately $2 billion in official gold
and securities held by the Fed
eral Reserve Bank of New York.
The U.S. Treasury is believed to
hold $400 million in down
payments for arms purchases
later suspended. The rest is
scattered all over the financial
landscape in the form of out
right deposits with private U.S.
banks, Iranian accounts with
U.S. companies and other valu
ables.
But if the Iranians actually
own these assets and they were
never seized, then why is it so
difficult to give them back?
The trouble is that since the
president froze the assets, indi

viduals and corporations have
tiled more than 250 lawsuits in
various U.S. and state courts
seeking more than $5 billion in
claims and damages from the
Iranian gonverninent.
Why?
These are people and com
panies who claim Iran owes
them money. They include those
who had assets nationalized in
Iran, exporters who claim Iran
is refusing to pay for goods it or
dered — almost any people who
can claim that Iran owes them
money or has caused them dam
ages. American lawyers for the
Iranian government are disput
ing these claims. It is a process
that, left to itself, could take
years of litigation.
Meanwhile, the plaintiffs are
likely to provide stiff legal re
sistance to any move that would
allow Iranian assets to be spir
ited beyond the jurisdiction of
U.S. courts. Involved is the
ticklish question of the property
rights of these plaintiffs in addi
tion to the president's authority
to override either these rights
or orders of the courts.
Hut in the interest of the
hostages' safety could a new
presidential order override
these interests? If the president
is empowered to freeze the as
sets, isn't he empowered to re
turn them?
Lawyers are in wide dis
agreement on this point. And
since they are. it could mean a
whole new set of lawsuits
challenging the president's
right to unfreeze the assets or
take any action that might prej
udice these court cases.
Have foreign assets ever been
frozen in the IJnited States
before?
Yes, many times. Besides the
assets of nations with which the
country has actually been at
war, presidents have frozen the
assets of many nations with
which the United States has had
ongoing disputes, such as Cuba.
In most cases, the unfreezing of
assets and resumption of nor
mal relations has proved to be a
long and difficult process. One
of the biggest problems, as in

the case with Cuba, has been
what to do about the American
citizens who subsequently file
claims against the foreign gov
ernment in question But never
before have the lives of hostages
been involved which, together
with the size of Iranian assets
now in question, makes this case
different.
Isn't there a simpler solution
than waiting for the courts to
act?
It has been suggested that the
president, having frozen the as
sets, could now actually seize
them and take possession of
them under the authority of the
International Emergency Eco
nomic Powers Act. He could
then turn them over to the Ira
nians. Those with suits against
Iran c< uld then try to recover
their claims from the U.S. gov
ernment itselt. The trouble with
this suggestion is that it, too,
would be subject to legal
challenge and. therefore, long
delay.
What else could he done?
The United States could try to
guarantee some form of
payment to the claimants
against Iran. To have any
weight, however, such an under
taking might require an act of
Congress and a pledge that their
claims would receive just ad
judication with the govenment
footing the final bill, if neces
sary. Thus, in effect, our gov
ernment would be in a position
of taking Iran off the hook for all
the valid claims that Americans
have against it.
How about the assets of the
late shah of Iran? Would it he
easier to return them ?
Not really, especially since
they, too, are currently the sub
ject of a court case that no presi
dent can simply nullify. The Ira
nian government has filed suit
in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan to recover between
$20 and $26 billion of the shah's
assets that it claims belong to
Iran. The shah's heirs, naturally
enough, are resisting the suit,
just as the Iranian government
is resisting private suits to take
over its assets.
