It happened to secretaries first. Then lawyers, bookkeepers, waitresses.' *
cabbies, housewives, and businessmen succumbed to the beauty of our
Pilot Razor Point and Fineliner pens.
Some people felt it was sick to get so emotionally involved with our
pens But is it really so crazy to love a Pilot Razor Point pen that writes with
a sharp smooth line and costs a mere 79C? Is it nuts to flip over its unique
little metal collar that smartly helps to keep its point from going squish?
If it is crazy, it's going to surprise a whole lot of people. In fact, we
understand that Pilot Razor Point even has what it takes to score extra
points with football players.
It also comes to our attention that many
coaches are fans of the Pilot Fineliner
Along with all the other Razor
Point the 69C
Pilot Fineliner has
