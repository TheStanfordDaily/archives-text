A STATEMENT FROM ATHLETIC DIRECTOR
ANDY GBGER ON "SEAT SAVING" AT THE
USC FOOTBALL GAME
Dear Students,
We need your help in solving a problem that has surfaced in the student
section at our home football games.
We have received several complaints and petitions concerning rude
behavior on the part of students attempting to save large blocks of seats
for their friends.
It is not permissable for students to reserve seats in the student
section. The USC game is a complete sellout, and we expect an
early-arriving student crowd. "Seat Saving" will not be allowed.
The student gates will open at 11:00 A.M with kickoff now scheduled for
12:50 P.M. Students who wish to sit together in groups should arrive at
the Stadium together.
I thank you for your cooperation and assistance in making Stanford
football an enjoyable experience for all our students.
Sincerely Yours,
ANDY GBGER
Director of Athletics, Physical Education ami Recreation
