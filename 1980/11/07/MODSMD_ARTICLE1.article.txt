# Kennedy opens up on politics, patents
## 
### Peter Finch 
President Donald Kennedy, speak
ing on KZSU's Campus Conference
last night, discussed national and local
issues ranging from the election of
Ronald Reagan to a proposal for limit
ing freshmen involvement in varsity
sports.
Regarding the possibility of a loss in
federal support for the University be
cause of the overwhelming Re
publican victories across the nation
this week, Kennedy expressed his
opinion that there wiil probably be "no
significant effects-at least not for
awhile."
"We'll be watching the president
elect's statements carefully," Ken
nedy continued, "but there is no im
mediate reason to suspect different
policies (on that matter)."
With the election of Ronald Reagan,
it now seems likely that some mem
bers of the Hoover Institution may be
called on as presidential advisors, he
asserted.
"My guess is that some people from
Hoover will be active in the new gov
ernment, just as there were some in
the campaign," Kennedy said, al
though he would not speculate on who
they might be. "In the campaign, the
number (of advisors from Stanford)
was not as large as the press attention
to those people would suggest."
Kennedy declined to state his per
sonal opinion of Reagan, choosing
rather to "wait and see what he does in
the way of selecting a cabinet and
what moves he makes in terms of
changing or not changing the or
ganization of the office of president."
Kennedy stated, however, that he is
more concerned about other aspects
of last Tuesday's election than who
won the presidency.
"The targeting of particular sena
tors for defeat by groups of people in
terested in particular issues is troub
ling, no matter what you happen to
think of the issues," he said. "I'm not
troubled so much by who went down,
but what it says about the condition of
American politics."
Switching to campus issues, Ken
nedy was questioned about instituting
a program in which his performance
as president would be evaluated â€”
something he had mentioned previous
ly this year.
While he has made no such arrange
ments at this time, he explained, he
does welcome criticism.
"One thing people who are heads of
things don't get is honest, frank com
ments about how they're doing," he
said. "There's an old saying that goes
'It's not easy to speak truth to power.'
And that feeling denies people their
ability to comment on how I'm run
ning an office like this."
Kennedy was also questioned about

recent discussions involving the Uni
versity's treatment of patents for its
faculty, particulary in the field of sci
entific research.
The University policy with regard
to patents, he explained, has been to
give the rights to the researcher, but
also to provide them with "strong in
centive" to give their rights back to
the University through individual pat
ent agreements so Stanford can act as
a licensor for them.
No thought has been given to chang
ing that policy, he said, but he pointed
out that a more serious question re
volves around the possibility of form
ing a corporation that would not only
provide royalty income for the Uni
versity, but in which Stanford might
actually "own a piece of the action and
thereby corner a much larger share of
the fruits."
There are. of course, some serious
questions to consider before under
going such a project, according to
Kennedy. Among the problems in
starting such a corporation, he said,
are the feelings of faculty members in
other areas of research and the possi
bility of giving the appearance of fa
voritism in corporation appointments.
The president also addresed the
problems facing graduate students
here, especially with respect to hous
ing and social life.
"I think we'll improve the graduate
student life by constructing the new
dorms," he said. "This is not because
