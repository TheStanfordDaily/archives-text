# Kremlin hopes for peace and U.S. arms limitations
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The landslide election of Ronald Re
agan and a Senate dominated by conservative Re
publicans abruptly ushers in a new era for Soviet-
American relations after years of bilateral at
tempts to find common ground for cooperation un
der the rubric of "detente. "
The official Soviet reaction to what one
Western diplomatic source called "very sober
ing" election results for the Kremlin was to blink
and view the vote as a resounding defeat for Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's anti-Soviet policies.
But neither the media nor Soviets officials in
private contacts faced the fact that the election
turned out of office a number of Democratic sena
tors whose votes were crucial to ratification of the
long-delayed strategic arms limitation treaty
(SALT II).
The Soviets long have called the treaty, and the
complex negotiating process for limiting both
sides' strategic nuclear arsenals, the cornerstone
of "relaxation of tensions" between East and
West.
Both the Soviet commentators and officials in
analyzing the election results ignored the fact that
Carter in his final weeks of campaigning had
called the election a referendum on SALT 11,
which the president shelved for ratification after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan last December.
Reagan has said he would scrap the treaty and
seek to renegotiate it.
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev months ago
said the treaty, which he and Carter signed at
their June 1979 summit in Vienna, cannot be re
negotiated. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in
later declarations reasserted the Soviet position
that the Senate must ratify the agreement as
signed by the two heads of state.
One senior Soviet official told correspondents
Wednesday that Reagan may bring a "more busi
nesslike. but tougher" approach to bilateral rela
tions. But his remarks fell well short of serious
analysis of the sudden problem of the nuclear
weapons treaty. The Kremlin in March 1977 bit
terly rejected an attempt by then-secretary of
state Cyrus Vance on a special mission to Moscow
to reopen the basic tenets of the treaty and seek
instead an overall agreement for general reduc
tions in nuclear striking power.
SALT II is valued bv Moscow because it confers

strategic parity on the Soviets, who have devoted
enormous economic resources during Brezhnev's
16-year tenure to building up their strategic, as
well as conventional, forces.
Confronted bv the unmistakeably conservative
swing in the U.S. electorate Wednesday. Tass. the
Soviet news agency, described the outcome as a
victory for detente. It laid Carter's defeat on
"hundreds" of broken promises during his four
years, but emphasized that "the greatest damage
was inflicted by (his) turn in foreign policy from
the course towards detente to the course toward
heightening international tensions and dangerous
doctrines in the use of nuclear weapons."
Tass said that "the voters rejected the pro
vocative stand in respect to detente, demonstrat
ing their understanding of the irrefutable fact that
not a single question can now be resolved .Viong
the lines of the arms race."
The official version of Carter's defeat hewed to
the Soviet portrait drawn through months of bitter
denunciation of Carter as a man who abandoned
detente and sold out to the military-industrial
complex more than a year ago as a way of winning
re-election. Only President Lyndon Johnson dur
ing the Vietnam War has been so personally at
tacked by the tightly controlled media as Carter
among recent U.S. presidents.
The Tass dispatch from New York, the only sub
stantive official comment on Tuesday's election,
offered an olive branch to Reagan, in line with
what one senior Soviet journalist Wednesday as
serted is "traditional willingness to work with any
U.S. president." Tass said the Kremlin "has
always come out in favor" of Soviet-American re
lations "on the basis of the principles of peaceful
coexistence" as set forth at the 1972 Nixon-
Brezhnev summit.
Soviet sources Wednesday repeatedly asserted
the belief that Reagan, like Nixon, would move
from tough anti-communist campaigning to ex
ploring new cooperation with Moscow. Foreign
analysts here see the Kremlin taking satisfaction
from Reagan's obvious coolness toward China.
Moscow's arch-enemy and ideological rival. They
also see the Soviets intent on exploiting strains be
tween Washington and its West European allies to
restrain any Reagan impulses to direct confronta
tion with Moscow.

The Soviets long have called the treaty, and the
complex negotiating process for limiting both
sides' strategic nuclear arsenals, the cornerstone
of "relaxation of tensions" between East and
West.
Both the Soviet commentators and officials in
analyzing the election results ignored the fact that
Carter in his final weeks of campaigning had
called the election a referendum on SALT 11,
which the president shelved for ratification after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan last December.
Reagan has said he would scrap the treaty and
seek to renegotiate it.
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev months ago
said the treaty, which he and Carter signed at
their June 1979 summit in Vienna, cannot be re
negotiated. Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko in
later declarations reasserted the Soviet position
that the Senate must ratify the agreement as
signed by the two heads of state.
One senior Soviet official told correspondents
Wednesday that Reagan may bring a "more busi
nesslike. but tougher" approach to bilateral rela
tions. But his remarks fell well short of serious
analysis of the sudden problem of the nuclear
weapons treaty. The Kremlin in March 1977 bit
terly rejected an attempt by then-secretary of
state Cyrus Vance on a special mission to Moscow
to reopen the basic tenets of the treaty and seek
instead an overall agreement for general reduc
tions in nuclear striking power.
SALT II is valued bv Moscow because it confers

strategic parity on the Soviets, who have devoted
enormous economic resources during Brezhnev's
16-year tenure to building up their strategic, as
well as conventional, forces.

swing in the U.S. electorate Wednesday. Tass. the
Soviet news agency, described the outcome as a
victory for detente. It laid Carter's defeat on
"hundreds" of broken promises during his four
years, but emphasized that "the greatest damage
was inflicted by (his) turn in foreign policy from
the course towards detente to the course toward
heightening international tensions and dangerous
doctrines in the use of nuclear weapons."
Tass said that "the voters rejected the pro
vocative stand in respect to detente, demonstrat
ing their understanding of the irrefutable fact that
not a single question can now be resolved .Viong
the lines of the arms race."
The official version of Carter's defeat hewed to
the Soviet portrait drawn through months of bitter
denunciation of Carter as a man who abandoned
detente and sold out to the military-industrial
complex more than a year ago as a way of winning
re-election. Only President Lyndon Johnson dur
ing the Vietnam War has been so personally at
tacked by the tightly controlled media as Carter
among recent U.S. presidents.
The Tass dispatch from New York, the only sub
stantive official comment on Tuesday's election,
offered an olive branch to Reagan, in line with
what one senior Soviet journalist Wednesday as
serted is "traditional willingness to work with any
U.S. president." Tass said the Kremlin "has
always come out in favor" of Soviet-American re
lations "on the basis of the principles of peaceful
coexistence" as set forth at the 1972 Nixon-
Brezhnev summit.

the belief that Reagan, like Nixon, would move
from tough anti-communist campaigning to ex

restrain any Reagan impulses to direct confronta

Moscow — The landslide election of Ronald Re
agan and a Senate dominated by conservative Re
publicans abruptly ushers in a new era for Soviet-
American relations after years of bilateral at
tempts to find common ground for cooperation un
der the rubric of "detente. "
The official Soviet reaction to what one
Western diplomatic source called "very sober
ing" election results for the Kremlin was to blink
and view the vote as a resounding defeat for Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's anti-Soviet policies.
But neither the media nor Soviets officials in
private contacts faced the fact that the election
turned out of office a number of Democratic sena
tors whose votes were crucial to ratification of the
long-delayed strategic arms limitation treaty
(SALT II).
