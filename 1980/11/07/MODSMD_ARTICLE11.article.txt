# France to propose four-nation summit
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Paris — President Valerv Giscard
d Estaing is considering trying to arrange a
four-power summit with Ronald Reagan
shortly after his inauguration, informed
sources said here Wednesday.
Within hours after the Reagan victory be
came clear, the French president sent a
particularly warm message of congratula
tions to Reagan.
"I look forward to establishing with you
the dialogue which is natural between our
two countries, friends and allies always,
and I am confident that your future actions
will serve the cause of maintenance of
peace and the defense of freedom." he said.
According to sources, Giscard d'Estaing
is anxious to make personal contact with the
new American president as soon as prac
ticable after the inauguration on Jan. 20. He
thinks that a repeat of the four-power sum
mit conference which he hosted on the
French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe in
January of 1979, with President Jimmy
Carter. West German Chancellor Helmut

Schmidt and the then-Prime Minister
James Callaghan of Britain would be the
most effective arrangment the sources
said. This time the plan would be to meet at
the Caribbean island of Martinique.
Schmidt is due in Paris next Monday for a
bilateral meeting with the French presi
dent, and is then scheduled to fly to Wash
ington during the following week. If, as is
possible, Schmidt agrees to the idea of a
French-hosted summit, he will probably
then take up the proposal in Washington
with either George Schulz, a senior Reagan
adviser, or with Reagan himself if a meet
ing can be arranged.
Margaret Thatcher, the British prime
minister, would be consulted before any
soundings are taken with Reagan or his ad
visers.
There also would be a number of practical
political and diplomatic advantages in a
meeting with Reagan at the start of his ad
ministration.
In such a small gathering, it would be pos

sible for the new president to come to meet
intimately with the allied leaders with
whom he will have to work closely. More
importantly, he would get their reading of
the problems of East-West relations and
other questions which he must face in a few
short months.
Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford arranged quick tours of Europe, with
summit meetings at the headquarters of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brus
sels, soon after they entered the White
House — Nixon in February 1969 and Ford in
May 1975. Ford also met Giscard d'Estaing
for a bilateral conference at Martinique in
December 1974 before coming to Europe,
only four months after taking office on Nix
on's resignation.
So at the start of a new American admin
istration under a president who is virtually
unknown outside his own country and un
tried in foreign policy, Giscard d'Estaing
clearly hopes that his idea of a limited sum
mit will appeal to Reagan.
