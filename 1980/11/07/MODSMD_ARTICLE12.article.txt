"You are a world-famous
hunter attempting to kill the fa
mous man-eating Wumpus in
the face of such dangers as bot
tomless pits, superbats and of
course, the Wumpus. . .
"Wumpus" is one of many
computer games available at
LOTS (Low Overhead Time
Sharing), the student computer
center. LOTS is located on the
first floor of the CERAS build
ing and is available for all stu
dents and faculty to use.
No special knowledge of com
puters is needed to play these
games, but everyone is required
to open an account at LOTS, a
relatively simple process, prior
to playing.
According to Ralph Gorin, di
rector of LOTS, the games are
becoming increasingly popular
among students.
Gorin stresses, however, that
"LOTS exists for educational
purposes, and our first priority
is to ensure game playing does
not conflict with course work."
There are currently a wide
variety of games on file. Ac
cording to Gorin. most are ob
tained from outside sources, al
though some programs have
been developed by students in
their spare time.
"Galaxy," an outer space
war game, is played against oth
er people instead of the com
puter. If there is room,
"Galaxy" can be played by sev
eral students on different termi
nals.
"Adventure" is also one of
the most popular games at
LOTS, according to Gorin. The
"Adventure" program is de
scribed by the computer as a

"rather free-form treasure hunt
loosely based on the human
game 'Dungeons and
Dragons.' "
A takeoff on "Adventure."
"Fisk," is a new game de
veloped by two Stanford under
graduates. In addition to hunt
ing for treasure, "Fisk" in
volves fighting or outwitting
competitors.
"Lugi." another game de
veloped by Stanford students,
involves the exploration and es
cape from an alien embassy.
There is a time limit on this
game which makes for fast and
exciting play.
In "Animal." students have
an opportunity to teach the com
puter. Users are instructed to
think of an animal and then the
computer attempts, through
questioning, to guess, usually
unsuccessfully, the name of the
animal.
According to Gorin. the in
creasingly popular game
playing has affected the more
serious uses of LOTS. Several
steps have been taken, says
Gorin, to combat the possibility
that game playing may deny
some students the opportunity
to complete course work.
Game playing is allowed only
on local terminals, says Gorin.
Also, warnings asking the
player to stop are printed if the
load is too high or if at least two
people are waiting to use a ter
minal. Games will auto
matically be terminated if more
than three people are waiting
for a terminal.
Students who want to play
games should come at un
crowded hours, notes Gorin.
