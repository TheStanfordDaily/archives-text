# Managers hope for self-sufficiency this year
## Recyclers reduce waste, conserve resources 
### Gita van Heerden 
What's the purpose of those
bright green barrels
strategically stationed in your
dorm — the ones with the funny
symbol and "No garbage"
printed on them? They've all
been placed there by workers at
the campus Recycling Center,
whose main office is located on
the second floor of Tresidder
Union.
According to project man
agers Betsy Jordan and Steve
Lautze, the Recycling Center
was initiated in January 1978 as
a non-profit organization that
had several goals in mind . 1) to
reduce the quantity of solid
waste ending up in the rapidly
filling Palo Alto landfill; 2) to
potentially prevent University
disposal costs from increasing
at their present rates; and 3) to
conserve valuable natural re
sources as energy.
There are 22 students em
ployed by the center, with each
student working an average of
eight hours a week. Through
their efforts, and with Stanford
community cooperation, they
help recycle mixed paper, white
paper, computer paper,
cardboard, computer tab cards,
glass, aluminum, bi-metals and
automotive waste oil.
Each of the three bins at most
of the recycling pick-up points is
for different materials: glass,
aluminum cans and paper. Jor
dan points out that it is very im
portant not to mix the materials
because it takes time to sort
them out, reduces efficiency
and increases costs.
In an organization that runs a
tight budget and whose goal is to
break even, this can represent a
substantial setback, she says.
The center has received four fee
assessments since it was begun,
for a total of approximately
$40,000. This year's goal is to be
come self-sufficient, which
places added importance on ef
ficiency, according to Jordan.
The logistics of recycling are
relatively simple, according to
the managers. Monday through
Saturday the center makes at
least three pick-up runs a day —
one in the morning and two in
the afternoon. Employees load
two trucks with 12 empty bar
rels and drive to pre-de
termined pick-up points where
full barrels are replaced with
empty ones. -
Then the employees return to
the center and begin the task of
sorting the material. Aluminum
is sold to Coors West in
Redwood City and tin and bi
metal are taken to Palo Alto Re
cycling because the Stanford
center's quantity is too small to
sell to a market, according to

the project managers.
Wine bottles from California
are sent to a factory where they
are washed and sent back to the
wineries, while other glass is
sent to be crushed and remelted.
Paper is sent to various
places to be recycled, depending
on its type. White paper, com
puter paper and computer tab
cards are especially valuable if
they are separated from regular
mixed paper, says Jordan.
Cardboard is also a good money
maker, and the center has
purchased a cardboard baler,
since bales of cardboard are
much more profitable than
loose cardboard.

According to Jordan, all it
takes for efficiency in recycling
is to have at least one person per
house or dorm who will remind
others to recycle and will call
the center when the bins are
full. Bins are located at approx
imately 300 different locations.
Student response varies wide
ly, according to Jordan. "Biz
students," she says, "are one of
the worst recyclers. We've
taken the bins out of there.
"Co-ops are the best," she
adds, "because they recycle
almost everything." Jordan
says part of the problem with
general student awareness is
the broad geographical distribu
tion of the student body; certain

parts of the country are less en
vironmentally aware than oth
ers.
For example, she says she be
lieves there is more recycling
awareness in California than on
the East Coast.
According to the September
1980 "Update on ASSU Recycl
ing" by Jordan and Lautze, Palo
Alto landfill figures indicate
that Stanford generates roughly
915 tons of solid waste per
month. About half of this — 455
tons — has the potential to be re
cycled. The Recycling Center
estimates that it diverts just un
der 15 percent (68.25 tons) of
Stanford's recyclable wastes
away from the Palo Alto dump

and back into the economy.
Measures are currently being
taken by the center to increase
student awareness through
posters and advertising. For ex
ample. the center is featured in
a traveling slide show.
The Stanford Recycling Cen
ter. one of the largest campus
organizations in the country, ac
cording to Jordan, receives
many inquiries from other col
leges and universities concern
ing its accomplishments. Al
though staff members are
pleased with their reputation,
Jordan says, "It's come a long
way, but there is just so much
farther to go."

aluminum cans and paper. Jor
dan points out that it is very im
portant not to mix the materials
because it takes time to sort
them out, reduces efficiency
and increases costs.
In an organization that runs a
tight budget and whose goal is to
break even, this can represent a
substantial setback, she says.
The center has received four fee
assessments since it was begun,
for a total of approximately
$40,000. This year's goal is to be
come self-sufficient, which
places added importance on ef
ficiency, according to Jordan.
The logistics of recycling are
relatively simple, according to
the managers. Monday through
Saturday the center makes at
least three pick-up runs a day —
one in the morning and two in
the afternoon. Employees load
two trucks with 12 empty bar
rels and drive to pre-de
termined pick-up points where
full barrels are replaced with
empty ones. -
Then the employees return to
the center and begin the task of
sorting the material. Aluminum
is sold to Coors West in
Redwood City and tin and bi
metal are taken to Palo Alto Re
cycling because the Stanford
center's quantity is too small to
sell to a market, according to

the project managers.
Wine bottles from California
are sent to a factory where they
are washed and sent back to the
wineries, while other glass is
sent to be crushed and remelted.
Paper is sent to various
places to be recycled, depending
on its type. White paper, com
puter paper and computer tab
cards are especially valuable if
they are separated from regular
mixed paper, says Jordan.
Cardboard is also a good money
maker, and the center has
purchased a cardboard baler,
since bales of cardboard are
much more profitable than
loose cardboard.

According to Jordan, all it
takes for efficiency in recycling
is to have at least one person per
house or dorm who will remind
others to recycle and will call
the center when the bins are
full. Bins are located at approx
imately 300 different locations.
Student response varies wide
ly, according to Jordan. "Biz
students," she says, "are one of
the worst recyclers. We've
taken the bins out of there.
"Co-ops are the best," she
adds, "because they recycle
almost everything." Jordan
says part of the problem with
general student awareness is
the broad geographical distribu
tion of the student body; certain

parts of the country are less en
vironmentally aware than oth
ers.
For example, she says she be
lieves there is more recycling
awareness in California than on
the East Coast.
According to the September
1980 "Update on ASSU Recycl
ing" by Jordan and Lautze, Palo
Alto landfill figures indicate
that Stanford generates roughly
915 tons of solid waste per
month. About half of this — 455
tons — has the potential to be re
cycled. The Recycling Center
estimates that it diverts just un
der 15 percent (68.25 tons) of
Stanford's recyclable wastes
away from the Palo Alto dump

and back into the economy.
Measures are currently being
taken by the center to increase
student awareness through
posters and advertising. For ex
ample. the center is featured in
a traveling slide show.
The Stanford Recycling Cen
ter. one of the largest campus
organizations in the country, ac
cording to Jordan, receives
many inquiries from other col
leges and universities concern
ing its accomplishments. Al
though staff members are
pleased with their reputation,
Jordan says, "It's come a long
way, but there is just so much
farther to go."

Twice a week, ASSU Recycling Center student employees replace full collection barrels with empties and take cardboard, paper,
metal and glass for recycling.
What's the purpose of those
bright green barrels
strategically stationed in your
dorm — the ones with the funny
symbol and "No garbage"
printed on them? They've all
been placed there by workers at
the campus Recycling Center,
whose main office is located on
the second floor of Tresidder
Union.
According to project man
agers Betsy Jordan and Steve
Lautze, the Recycling Center
was initiated in January 1978 as
a non-profit organization that
had several goals in mind . 1) to
reduce the quantity of solid
waste ending up in the rapidly
filling Palo Alto landfill; 2) to
potentially prevent University
disposal costs from increasing
at their present rates; and 3) to
conserve valuable natural re
sources as energy.
There are 22 students em
ployed by the center, with each
student working an average of
eight hours a week. Through
their efforts, and with Stanford
community cooperation, they
help recycle mixed paper, white
paper, computer paper,
cardboard, computer tab cards,
glass, aluminum, bi-metals and
automotive waste oil.
Each of the three bins at most
of the recycling pick-up points is
for different materials: glass,
aluminum cans and paper. Jor
dan points out that it is very im
portant not to mix the materials
because it takes time to sort
them out, reduces efficiency
and increases costs.
