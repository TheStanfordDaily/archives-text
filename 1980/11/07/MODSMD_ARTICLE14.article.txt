# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Pam Howe Classics for critical analysis 
### 
Teresa Butzerin's condemna
tion of the Western Culture re
quirement ("Physics 50 is as
good as Western Culture" Dai
ly, Oct. 24) reflects the increas
ingly popular attitude that a
"classical" education is not
only unnecessary but also unfair
to students in the sciences. By
requiring students to gain a
background in the development
of Western civilization.
Butzerin seems to think that
Stanford is discriminating
against those people who find
engineering more rewarding
than philosophy.
She suggests that a technical
education is just as appropriate
a background as an examination
of classical literature, and if one
requires the classics of engi
neers. one should also require
Engineering of classicists.
Juvenile
Such arguments are. 1 think,
naive. Butzerin obviously con
siders Western Culture inap
propriate for scientists, and re
sponds with the rather juvenile
alternative. "If we have to take
their classes, they should have
to take ours."
That she questions the rela
tionship between the classics
and critical thinking is in
dicative of her confessed
• perfect authority on behalf of
ignorance." What is important
about Western Culture is not
just that the texts are. in her
words, "great vehicles for
critical insights." but that they
are approached in a very specif
ic manner.
There are several different
sequences which fulfill the
Western Culture requirement,
most of which vary in their
selection of "great books." The
very existence of these different
courses implies that WHAT

students read may not be nearly
as important as HOW students
read.
The real point of the Western
Culture requirement, which 1
think Butzerin misses, is to
teach a method of critical
analysis, a manner of asking
questions and placing ideas in
some historical or literary per
spective. That this critical
method is the best approach to
these works is clear to anyone
who has tried to comprehend
Plato. Machiavelli or Joyce;
that it can (and should> be ap
plied to other disciplines is, I
think, often overlooked.
Critical analysis
Butzerin also suggests that it
is unfair to require a historical
literary approach to critical
analysis over a scientific or
technical one. This is a surpris
ingly common complaint. I
think, however, that the de
velopers of the Western Culture
program did not mean to sug
gest that Shakespeare is superi
or to Einstein, or that Marxism
is more fundamental than dif
ferential calculus. (There were,
after all. scientific and techni
cal faculty members involved in
the decision as well.)
Rather, these developers rec
ognized a difference in the
analytical method. A technical
approach to criticism is neces
sarily scientific, logical,
mathematical : it delineates and
narrows in an attempt to cate
gorize. (I realize here I am guil
ty of gross overgeneralization.
but some distinction must be
made.)
The scientific method is fun
damental to understanding rela
tivity. for instance, and I would
agree with Butzerin that it is
also fundamental to any under
standing of modern technolog
ical society — but the fact re

mains that it is entirely inap
propriate for an analysis of the
U.S. Constitution. If Butzerin
must have a reason for the fac
ulty's choice, let her consider
that the historical approach can
be applied to all fields, technical
and non-technical alike (and
therefore it is perhaps much
more "fair" to a variety of stu
dents than the scientific meth
od. which, however valuable, is
not designed to provide a broad
perspective).
Distribution policy
I do not mean to belittle the
importance of either pure or ap
plied science. I am greatly in fa
vor. for example, of the Univer
sity's new distribution policy,
which requires not just one but
three courses in the sciences:
mathematics, natural science
and technology.
But I must dispute Butzerin's
rather highhanded notion that in
the long run. her engineering
courses would be more "enrich
ing" than the humanities and so
cial science courses the system
would "force" her to take.
Frankly. I find the assumption
that engineering is more ap
plicable to "real life" than his
tory rather insulting.
I realize that there are people
who feel (as Butzerin apparent
ly does) that any course they
buy books for should teach them
some technique directly ap
plicable to post-graduate em
ployment. But to assume that
Western Culture will teach noth
ing "useful" to these people is
absurd — and to dismiss the re
quirement as a necessary evil
is. I think, a frightening wasteof
a university education.
