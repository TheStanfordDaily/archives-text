## How the 'party’ failed Carter 
### 
I am a Democrat by convic
tion and standing, putting me in
the same category as two-thirds
of this country's registered vot
ers. Like many other Demo
crats. I am asking how a majori
ty party can lose the presidency
so decisively. The party, not the
candidate, must bear the re
sponsibility.
The important issue rests in
the margin of the Republican
victory, not the victory itself. If
President-elect Ronald Reagan
simply had nipped President
Jimmy Carter in a close race,
we could attribute his victory to
standard reasons — consti
tuents' frustration with the
economy, voters' dissatisfac
tion with what many perceive as
slipping American prestige, or
the power of traditional Re

publican funding.
When an incumbent of the
majority party suffers a land
slide defeat, however, we must
search for more substantia! an
swers.
Did the American public per
ceive that Carter committed a
major error during his term af
fecting the welfare or interna
tional standing of the nation?
Nobody has claimed as much.
Did an overwhelming majori
ty of Americans, Democrats in
particular, believe that Re
agan's major proposal for a
smaller government role in so
ciety would reverse their moun
ting economic frustration?
Since most voters, again partic
ularly Democrats, live in urban
and suburban areas, where
citizens have come to expect

ample government services,
and since the government em
ploys an ever-growing number
of citizens, this issue would not
seem to constitute a landslide
victory either.
Neither Carter's record nor
his stand on the issues forced his
conclusive defeat; Carter's ex
tremely poor image determined
his fate, and can be attributed to
the Georgia bureaucrats he sur
rounded himself with and to the
insensitive management of the
Democratic Party.
Carter won in 1976 with the
image of the honest, critical out
sider, free of the estab
lishment's corruption. He
focused his campaign on a
"bumbling" President Gerald
Ford, rather than his own
credentials. The tactic worked.

narrowly.
With the encouragement of
his staff and his party, he ap
plied the same strategy during
this year's bid for reelection.
However, the "negative cam
paign" failed because the Dem
ocrats did not understand that
the polls had turned: they were
now the establishment. They
were the party who needed to
defend its record and to display
pride, humility and dignity.
Yet. Carter viciously de
meaned Senator Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) on the issue of
personal integrity, causing
many rank and file Democrats
to reevaluate their esteem for
the president.
In the general election.
Carter unleashed his slur cam
paign on a seemingly choice
target. Reagan, however, who
owes much of his political suc
cess to his mastery of image and
stage presence, proved to be
more than a match for the presi
dent's challenge. Reagan's
"nice-guy" parleys of Carter's
attacks tainted the incumbent
as an invidious figure, who is
somewhat less than dignified.
Although many voters might
have supported the president in
view of the issues, and many
Democrats would have liked to
tote the party line, few probably
would wish to invite Carter over
for dinner. Essentially, on the
psychological level, Carter
failed to portray himself as a
confident leader, and this fail
ure dashed his chances to make
the election even close.
Indeed, the positive image of
leadership exhibited by John
Anderson explains much of his
success, undoubtedly _ at
Carter's expense. Take heed
Democratic Party Chairman
Robert Strauss. If the Demo
crats are to win against the
more unified, corporate-backed
Republicans, they must choose
a candidate who is willing to run
on the strength of his own mer
its rather than his opponent's
weaknesses.

I am a Democrat by convic
tion and standing, putting me in
the same category as two-thirds
of this country's registered vot
ers. Like many other Demo
crats. I am asking how a majori
ty party can lose the presidency
so decisively. The party, not the
candidate, must bear the re
sponsibility.
The important issue rests in
the margin of the Republican
victory, not the victory itself. If
President-elect Ronald Reagan
simply had nipped President
Jimmy Carter in a close race,
we could attribute his victory to
standard reasons — consti
tuents' frustration with the
economy, voters' dissatisfac
tion with what many perceive as
slipping American prestige, or
the power of traditional Re

publican funding.
When an incumbent of the
majority party suffers a land
slide defeat, however, we must
search for more substantia! an
swers.
Did the American public per
ceive that Carter committed a
major error during his term af
fecting the welfare or interna
tional standing of the nation?
Nobody has claimed as much.
Did an overwhelming majori
ty of Americans, Democrats in
particular, believe that Re
agan's major proposal for a
smaller government role in so
ciety would reverse their moun
ting economic frustration?
Since most voters, again partic
ularly Democrats, live in urban
and suburban areas, where
citizens have come to expect

ample government services,
and since the government em
ploys an ever-growing number
of citizens, this issue would not
seem to constitute a landslide
victory either.
Neither Carter's record nor
his stand on the issues forced his
conclusive defeat; Carter's ex
tremely poor image determined
his fate, and can be attributed to
the Georgia bureaucrats he sur
rounded himself with and to the
insensitive management of the
Democratic Party.
Carter won in 1976 with the
image of the honest, critical out
sider, free of the estab
lishment's corruption. He
focused his campaign on a
"bumbling" President Gerald
Ford, rather than his own
credentials. The tactic worked.

narrowly.
With the encouragement of
his staff and his party, he ap
plied the same strategy during
this year's bid for reelection.
However, the "negative cam
paign" failed because the Dem
ocrats did not understand that
the polls had turned: they were
now the establishment. They
were the party who needed to
defend its record and to display
pride, humility and dignity.
Yet. Carter viciously de
meaned Senator Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) on the issue of
personal integrity, causing
many rank and file Democrats
to reevaluate their esteem for
the president.
In the general election.
Carter unleashed his slur cam
paign on a seemingly choice
target. Reagan, however, who
owes much of his political suc
cess to his mastery of image and
stage presence, proved to be
more than a match for the presi
dent's challenge. Reagan's
"nice-guy" parleys of Carter's
attacks tainted the incumbent
as an invidious figure, who is
somewhat less than dignified.
Although many voters might
have supported the president in
view of the issues, and many
Democrats would have liked to
tote the party line, few probably
would wish to invite Carter over
for dinner. Essentially, on the
psychological level, Carter
failed to portray himself as a
confident leader, and this fail
ure dashed his chances to make
the election even close.
Indeed, the positive image of
leadership exhibited by John
Anderson explains much of his
success, undoubtedly _ at
Carter's expense. Take heed
Democratic Party Chairman
Robert Strauss. If the Demo
crats are to win against the
more unified, corporate-backed
Republicans, they must choose
a candidate who is willing to run
on the strength of his own mer
its rather than his opponent's
weaknesses.
