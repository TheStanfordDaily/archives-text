Tahoe Basin
With all the candidates and is
sues that were voted on Tues
day. one proposition went down
to a most unfair defeat. Proposi
tion 2 would have provided for
$85 million to buy up Tahoe land
in the interest of environmental
protection.
As a resident of Tahoma. a
small town on the lake's west
shore, I have watched the
thousands of tourists come
through and enjoy Tahoe's natu
ral beauty. But the beauty and
high quality of Tahoe are
slipping. Developments on the
shores of the lake are destroying
the natural water shed which
cleanses the water as it flows
down into the lake. The algae
growth in the lake has become
very noticeable in the last two to
three years.
Proposition 2 would have pro
vided funds to buy up existing
undeveloped lots to protect and
maintain the water shed from
further damage. The thought of
its not passing had never
crossed my mind.
Tahoe is one of nature's
greatest natural wonders, and
belongs to all the people of Cali
fornia. But if you. the people of
California, are unwilling to shell
out a few bucks to help save
Tahoe at a crucial time in its
history, then next time you plan
a vacation, go somewhere else.
You need the Tahoe Basin more
than it needs you.

Don't run alone
The Daily recently printed
two articles on running which
were interesting and in

formative, but left out a crucial
point. Running is a healthy sport
if done with others, but alone it
can be dangerous.
Stanford is not an ivory tow
er. violent acts periodically oc
cur in and around campus.
Women running alone in
isolated areas such as the dish, a
deserted Lake Lag, or running
at night risk the serious threat
of assault, indecent exposure
and rape. It has happened here
and the Daily has reported it.
The Daily also published in
the past a poignant column by a
female jogger who was raped.
The recent article did a major
disservice to the new members
of the student body by omitting
any reference to the potential
risks of jogging. Please, fellow
students, run in pairs or groups;
avoid in particular isolated
areas when alone, and don't run
anywhere alone at night. Don't
let exercise turn into a life
threatening experience.

Global 2000
Your interesting article about
"Global 2000'' (Daily, Oct. 20)
inspires us to point out that a
Stanford graduate (Michael
Wright, A.B. '66, J.D. '70) iscur
rently associate director of the
Council on Environmental Qual
ity's task force on Global 2000,
assigned to recommend to the
president a series of legislative
measures based on the Global
2000 report. Wright is on leave
from his regular post as vice
president of World Wildlife
Fund in Washington. His friends
may be interested to know of his
connection with this project;
Stanford students may be en

couraged to know that gradu
ates of this University can do
something important in the en
vironmental field. The authors
of this letter are of course, not
motivated by maternal and pa
ternal pride. Not entirely, any
way.

Two sided story
I have read the majority of
the editorial articles and letters
in the Daily since I arrived here
at the beginning of this quarter.
Some have been extremely well
written. others simply puerile
rhetoric. I have noticed a partic
ular trend, however, especially
in those articles which criticize
the conservative economic and
social proposals of Ronald Re
agan.
Much of this criticism has
been based not on objective
analysis but on name-calling,
particularly with reference to
the obvious lack of intelligence
and humanitarian principles
which surely characterize Re
agan and other conservatives.
This attitude is at best smugly
self-righteous, and could more
accurately be described as bla
tant arrogance. Let me combine
some platitudes to give a warn
ing: a little knowledge is a dan
gerous thing and often leads to
the "ivory tower - ' effect.
Although it may seem shock
ing to the self-proclaimed en
lightened who may have con
descended to read this, it is pos
sible to have a modicum of in
tellect and still maintain a be
lief in conservative theories; it
is possible to consider peace to
be the most precious and de
sirable of conditions (except
perhaps for freedom), and still

give credence to the theory that
a strong military deterrent is
the best means of securing that
peace.
Beware of ascribing all virtue
to your position, a trend which
seems to be prevalent among
those fond of labelling con
servatives as "reactionaries."
See Andrew Goldenkranz' col
umn (Daily, Nov. 3) as a graphic
example. Now that Reagan has
won, perhaps Goldenkranz will
carry through on his promise to
put his head in an oven, thus
sparing us having to read his
future futile attempts at writing
cogent essays.
Although it may be easier to
launch a political crusade if one
believes that the other guys are
all corporate-backed nasties
with only evil thoughts in their
small minds (racism, sexism,
uncontrolled nuclear prolifera
tion, an end to rock-and-roll, vi
olent death for whales, baby
seals, etc.), please restrict
yourself to valid arguments.
Everyone has ideals; everyone
has opinions — let's respect
that, and let's use the Daily as a
forum for intelligent debate, not
an arena for polemical invec
tive.

No landslide
I read with some surprise Will
von Kaenel's assertion that
John Anderson's supporters are
strictly "upper-middle class
college-educated liberals"
(Daily, Nov. 5). I was especially
surprised because I had thought
that most of us read about the
polls this summer which in
dicated that not only would An
derson fare better than 7
percent, but that he would win
the election — if voters thought
he could win. Clearly, such a
victory would be impossible
without votes from Americans
outside of von Kaenel's stere
otype.
Governor Ronald Reagan
won decisively on Tuesday, but I
question the widespread
reference to 51 percent of the
popular vote as "a landslide"
(i.e. an overwhelming victory).
Anderson, more centrally lo
cated on America's political
spectrum, might well have won
a true landslide against our un
popular incumbent, if given the
chance by the early Republican
primaries. It is indeed our two
party system, and not Ronald
Reagan or 'Middle America,'
that has defeated John An
derson.

No Armegeddon
There is much talk these days
about fighting and winning a nu

clear war. According to Presi
dential Directive No. 59 the
president and other national
leaders are to retreat to a center
under the mountains where they
can direct recovery after the
holocaust.
In the recent issue of
Daedalus Colin Gray, defense
advisor with the Hudson In
stitute, suggests that the U.S.
should consider the possibility
of initiating "central strategic
nuclear employment in expecta
tion of gain." The reason the
U.S. must do this is that similar
expressions are claimed to have
been found in the Russian liter
ature.
Discussions by such experts
seem to pay minimal attention
to the actual magnitude of the
deaths that would result from
such a war. However, one of our
foremost defense advisors,
Herman Kahn, also of the
Hudson Institute, states in his
book Thermonuclear war that
the U.S. and its NATO allies
would "reluctantly" accept 100
to 200 million casualties in a nu
clear exchange with the Soviets.
The number of missiles on
each side appears to grow ex
ponentially with a doubling time
of about 10 years. In his 1968
"military posture" speech Sec
retary of Defense Robert
McNamara gave an estimate of
the number of warheads needed
to decimate the population of
Russia. Two hundred equivalent
million tons would be needed.
As he spoke the Pentagon had in
its arsenal 5600 equivalent mil
lion tons.
Each side now has more than
twice this number. More recent
ly President Jimmy Carter in
his State of the Union Address
revealed that "a single one of
our Poseiden submarines car
ries enough warheads to destroy
every large and medium sized
city in the Soviet Union." We
have about 40 such submarines
and the Russians have even
more. Either side could totally
destroy the other in about 40
minutes using only a fraction of
its missiles.
One of the present fears is
that the Russians intend to take
over the world. Some years ago
they did succeed in subverting
China — one-fourth of the
wood's population. There was
great fear of the Sino-Soviet
Axis. However, when the Chi
nese got tired of the Russians
they seemed to have little dif
ficulty in throwing them out. A
similar course of events fol
lowed in Egypt, and will proba
bly follow the current Russian
adventures in other parts
Africa. Comparted NyHJi the Eng
lish, who spread their empire
over the whole world in the last
century, the Russians seem to
have little aptitude for such an
endeavor.
The present climate of fear

and the drive toward nuclear
war seem to me to have little
basis in reality. I remember
very well the atmosphere that
was created in this country
prior to our entry into World
War I. The evil nature of the
Kaiser's Germany was on every
page. We were told that a vic
tory by the Kaiser would mean
the end of civilization. Now
hardly anyone remembers what
the argument was about. Na
tional leaders tend to view each
new political dispute as the
Apocalypse, but time and
change usually prevail.
While science has now pro
vided them with weapons of in
finite destruction, political
leaders and their academic ad
visors continue to practice a
kind of demonology reminiscent
of the dark ages. Political "sci
ence" seems to have made little
progress since the time of
Machiavelli. I believe that we,
who are to be left above ground
during the planned Armaged
don, should ask the political ex
perts to put aside their history
books, and their learned airs,
and to come up with some new
ideas.
