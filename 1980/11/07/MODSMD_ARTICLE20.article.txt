Sacramento (AP) — California's Secretary of State says she
may seek nationwide simultaneous poll ciosings to keep quickly
announced presidential victories from cutting voter turnout in
the West.
March Fond Eu, a Democrat, said there was "a dramatic
falloff in voter participation Tuesday after television networks
began projecting the victory of Ronald Reagan as president.
Normally, about 15 percent of California's voters cast their
ballots between 5 p.m. and the 8 p.m. close. The network
projections began between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.. PST.
When President Jimmy Carter conceded, it was only about 7
p.m. in California, and Eu said many voters chose to stay away
from the polls.
"1 am strongly inclined to pursue legislation at the federal
level to require a universal closing time for polling places
throughout the nation. Failing that, 1 can pursue legislation in
California," Eu said in a statement.
She said Carter s "early concession of defeat, combined with
the even earlier projections of winners by the major networks,
resulted in a twin depressant effect on late-in-the-day voter turn
out in California and doubtless other states in the West.
"I have never heard of a presidential candidate for a major
party conceding defeat prior to the close of polls in the West,"
she said. "Presidential candidates know, or should know, full
well the deleterious effects the timing of such a concession can
have on the ultimate turnout of voters and the possible impact of
a diminished turnout on races other than their own."
