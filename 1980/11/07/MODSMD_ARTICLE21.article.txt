## Former FBI chief convicted of conspiracy 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Two former
high-ranking FBI officials were
found guilty yesterday of con
spiracy to violate individual civ
il rights by approving secret
break-ins in the hunt for
fugitives of the terrorist Weath
er Underground in 1972 and 1973.
After deliberating eight-and
a-half hours over a 2-day period,
a jury in the court of Chief U.S.
District Judge William Bryant
returned the verdicts against W.
Mark Felt, 67. once the FBl's
No. 2 man, and Edward Miller,
56, the bureau's former in
telligence chief.
Felt and Miller were the most
senior FBI officials ever prose
cuted for misconduct in the bu
reau's 56-year history. In reach
ing their decision, the jurors re
jected the argument of defense

attorneys that Felt and Miller
believed that the FBI had au
thority to search homes without
a warrant in cases of national
security or foreign intelligence.
The two retired officials
showed no emotion when jury
foreman Odell Valentine, a su
pervisor for the General Ser
vices Administration, an
nounced: "We find both defen
dants guilty."
Judge Bryant set Dec. 15 for
sentencing, with Felt and Miller
each facing a maximum pun
ishment of 10 years in prison and
a $10,000 fine. Defense attorneys
said the verdicts would be ap
pealed.
First vote conviction
Two jurors who were reached
for comment said that the con
victions were arrived at unani
mously on the first vote. One of

them. Forest Beale, said the
jury was impressed by prose
cution arguments that Felt and
Miller's actions violated the
Fourth Amendment's protec
tions against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
Beale said that the jury rec
ognized that the Weather Un
derground was a terrorist group
that claimed responsibility for
bombing buildings in the United
States, including the U.S.
Capitol and Pentagon, as a pro
test against the Vietman War.
But he suggested that the se
cret break-ins were offensive to
the jury because the FBI was
seeking clues to the fugitives'
whereabouts by searching
homes of their families and
friends.
"The families and peers were
the targets, not the Weath

ermen." Beale said.
The predominantly black
middle-class jury was com
posed of eight women and four
men.
Did what was necessary
Felt expressed disappoint
ment at the verdict, saying
"I've spent my entire adult life
working for the government and
doing what was right and in the
best interests of the country
Miller told reporters that
"the FBI is a great and grand
organization and has always
worked for the people of this
countrv.
"We did the job the only way
the job could be done," Miller
said.
Official approval
During the eight-week trial,
John Nields, the chief prose
cutor. sought to show that the

KBI had not asked nor obtained
approval from the attorney gen
eral or the president for the
Weatherman break-ins.
The defense argued that such
specific authorization was not
needed at that time, although
KBI and Department of .Justice
guidelines now require it.
Kelt, who took the witness
stand in his own behalf, readily
acknowledged that he had ap
proved 13 break-ins without a
court order in 1972 and 1973.
most of them directed at the
Weather Underground. But he
said he had received blanket au
thority from the acting director
of the KBI. L. Patrick Gray, to
use surreptitious entries to
gather intelligence in such na
tional security cases. Gray has
denied giving such approval.
