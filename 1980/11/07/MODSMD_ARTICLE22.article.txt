Berkeley, Calif. (AP) — Campus activists who
watched a rally against President-elect Ronald
Reagan dwindle into a sit-in over a hodgepodge of
university causes say they'll be back — and hope
to build a new nationwide student movement.
Fifty-two people were arrested Wednesday as
police dragged protesters out of a University of
California administration building. On Tuesday,
3000 people marched in the streets of Berkeley to
protest Reagan's victory.
Protesters said they planned another rally
Thursday.
One demonstration "probably won't do any
thing. But more and more demonstrations are
going to do something," said student Teresa
Clarke. Others shouted they hoped to spark a stu
dent movement similar to that of 15 years ago.
"We're going to be doing this a lot," said
satirist Stonev Burke, one of the protest or
ganizers.
Campus police arrested 35 students and de
tained 17 others after a 5-hour protest that moved
from Sproul Plaza, site of anti-war rallies of the
1960s and early 19705, to the campus ROTC build
ing and then to the administration building, where
150 people occupied a stairwell.
All 52 were charged with misdemeanor tres
passing and 10 were charged with resisting arrest.
They were released on their own recognizance

and no arraignment date was set.
Inside the building, the demonstrators chanted
defiance, but a reporter said he observed no vio
lence.
The demonstration began when several hun
dred people marched from Sproul Hall — site of
many anti-draft rallies in the late 1960s and early
1970s — to Peoples Park and on to the campus
ROTC building and the administration building.
At Sproul Plaza, speakers had exhorted the
crowd to "make sure Reagan can do as little as
possible to hinder human rights in the country."
The rally was called "to build an educational
movement against Reagan . . . when Reagan re
instates the draft and begins to cut back social
programs." said Joe Lambert of the Berkeley
Progressive Students Organization.
But the election was only a "catalyst" for a pro
test encompassing long-standing campus issues,
Clarke explained.
Inside the occupied California Hall, dissidents
denounced the campus ROTC — chanting "Hey,
hey. ho. ho, ROTC has got to go" — and demanded
an end to the university's involvement in nuclear
weapons research for the government, support
for a campus child care center and increased
Third World enrollment.
"I'm doing it (protesting) just to make a point
about what's going on," explained one student.
