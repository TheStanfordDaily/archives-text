# Feminists mourn conservative win
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — In the aftermath of a
sweeping conservative Republican victory,
both in the White House and in Congress,
most feminists reacted with predictable
gloom Wednesday over the fate of the Equal
Rights Amendment and pro-choice in abor
tion, while their conservative counterparts
heralded a return to "traditional" values of
family and the home.
"I'm on top of the world." said Phyllis
Schlafly, national chairman of Stop ERA
and a member of President-elect Ronald
Reagan's national security task force. "It's
a tremendous victory for the Republican
platform, which took a clear-cut stand
against ERA. and for a human life amend
ment to the constitution, and for traditional
family values."
However, Eleanor Smeal. president of
the National Organization for Women —
which did not endorse President Carter for
re-election — blamed feminist losses on is
sues which she said voters felt were more
critical than the GOP stands on ERA and
abortion.
"It is a catastrophic defeat." she said.
"But what really happened was that the
economy, foreign policy, inflation, un
employment and Iran — those were the
things people were voting on. They weren't

voting on social issues like abortion, ERA or
the return to yesteryear. The conservatives
are interpreting this as a mandate for their
social policies."
Bobbie Greene Kilberg. vice chair of the
Reagan-Bush women's policy board and a
member of the advisory board of the Na
tional Women's Political Caucus, said she
believes that a Reagan presidency will be
good for women.
"I think he will move legislatively and ad
ministratively to remove remaining dis
crinvnations against women." she con
tinued. "Look at Reagan s record in Califor
nia. He signed 14 pieces of legislation on
women's rights."
Smeal was not impressed with this
statistic. "There are 800 federal statutes
that discriminate on the basis of sex," she
said. "If we get 14 statutes in eight years, it
will take us 457 years to get equality."
Iris Mitgang, national chairwoman of the
National Women's Political Caucus, de
scribed the results for women as "mixed."
"We've been in politically difficult situ
ations since Seneca Falls in 1848." Mitgang
said. "The progress that women have made
is not going to be turned back The gains and
changes in our society for women are safely
enough entrenched that one election can't

change that."
Some of the forces on the other side did
not agree.
"If Reagan keeps his promises, the
American family has a great future," said
Connaught Marshner, editor of the Family
Protection Report, a publication of the Free
Congress Foundation, and chairman of the
Library Couret Group, a coalition of about
30 groups she describes as "pro-life, pro-de
cencv. pro-family and pro-religion."
i think we will see some movement on a
human life amendment and I think we'll see
some movement on the Family Protection
Act," Marshner said. "That's the bill in
troduced by Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), that
has some 38 different provisions covering
education, taxation, and welfare reform.
For instance, it would deny federation
education funds to states which did not have
some kind of mechanism for parents in the
community to review textbooks.
"I also hope we'll see the passage of tui
tion tax credits so that parents whose chil
dren are in non-public schools can get tax
credits," she continued. "If Reagan keeps
his promises, he'll clean out the IRS and the
attack on Christian schools will stop. I pray
to God we'll get some conservative Su
preme Court nominees. And I think ERA is
probably safe in its coffin."

scribed the results for women as "mixed."
"We've been in politically difficult situ
ations since Seneca Falls in 1848." Mitgang
said. "The progress that women have made
is not going to be turned back The gains and
changes in our society for women are safely
enough entrenched that one election can't

change that."
Some of the forces on the other side did
not agree.
"If Reagan keeps his promises, the
American family has a great future," said
Connaught Marshner, editor of the Family
Protection Report, a publication of the Free
Congress Foundation, and chairman of the
Library Couret Group, a coalition of about
30 groups she describes as "pro-life, pro-de
cencv. pro-family and pro-religion."
i think we will see some movement on a
human life amendment and I think we'll see
some movement on the Family Protection
Act," Marshner said. "That's the bill in
troduced by Sen. Paul Laxalt (R-Nev.), that
has some 38 different provisions covering
education, taxation, and welfare reform.
For instance, it would deny federation
education funds to states which did not have
some kind of mechanism for parents in the
community to review textbooks.
"I also hope we'll see the passage of tui
tion tax credits so that parents whose chil
dren are in non-public schools can get tax
credits," she continued. "If Reagan keeps
his promises, he'll clean out the IRS and the
attack on Christian schools will stop. I pray
to God we'll get some conservative Su
preme Court nominees. And I think ERA is
probably safe in its coffin."
