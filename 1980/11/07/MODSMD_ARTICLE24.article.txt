# Road to Mayfield paved with saloons
## Unique history characterizes Row 
### Susan Blaine 
Long before the Italian House
began serving pizzas, before
"Beta Nooners" became a Stan
ford tradition and before
freshmen staggered through the
first pledging ceremony on the
strip now known as "the Row,
Mayfield Avenue was a popular
trail.
In 1891, when the University
opened its doors, Mayfield Road
led students from the liquorless
campus to the small town of
Mayfield and its 13 famous
saloons
Stanford differed greatly
from the University of today in
that the faculty had a strong
prohibitionist leaning, and stu
dents with Bacchanalian in
clinations were forced to make
merry elsewhere. The San
Francisco Chronicle on Nov. 10,
1901, summed up May field's
role:
"There is a tavern in the town
of Mayfield, with a back room
where beer drinking can be car
ried on in safety, and this room
is the scene of much revelry on
Friday and Saturday nights. It is
only a little bare apartment,
with beer steins along the walls
by way of decoration and a pile
of empty decorations in one cor
ner. But tradition has made it
the most famous spot in the re
gion of the University. For the
past 10 years that ugly little
room has made university his
tory. It is mentioned in all the
student songs; it lives in all the
student traditions.
. . Oh, there's the road to May
field,
as plain as plain can be,
And if you want to see a wreck
just take a look at me:
For Fue been to Mayfield
and tasted of the beer,
And that is why my eyes are
weak —
I need to rest a year.
Leroy Ladd, '07
What became of this beloved
tavern and that congenial town
of Mayfield?
Both died at the hands of
teetotaler Leland Stanford.
In 1886, when the newly
elected senator decided to build
a University in memory of his
son, he approached the citizens
of Mayfield with his plans for
making that community his

"university town." His condi
tion was that the saloons be
closed down — a risk the short
sighted townspeople were un
willing to take. The decision
was the beginning of the end for
the town of Mayfield
Mayfield. now a part of South
Palo Alto, was founded in 1853
by -James Otterson alongside
the dirt highway known today as
El Camino Keal. Gold had been
discovered in California, and
streams of American settlers
rode the weekly fast coach ser
vice between San Francisco and
San Jose.
Otterson opened "Uncle
Jim's Cabin." a roadhouse. for
weary travelers. Located on
what is now the corner of El
Camino and California avenues,
it featured a saloon, an inn, a
stage shop and mail service.
Prosperity
In 1850. William Page, at age
18. left New York to try his luck
in California. Successful in min
ing, he returned to Mayfield two
years later to give lumber a try.
Page's Mill Road ran between
the stacks of piled redwood
lumber in his yard and the mills
of La Honda and the Alpine
Creek regions of the adjacent
Coastal Range.
By 1857. the flourishing com
munity of Mayfield contained a
butcher shop, a blacksmith
shop, a grocery store and a log
cabin school. A physician and a
judge were also part of this
growing community.
The 1870s were the peak of
prosperity for Mayfield, which
by then was an important

shipment point for logs, timber
and grain.
Hard times hit Mayfield at
the turn of the decade.
It was then that Sen. Stanford
approached its citizens with his
offer. According to the Palo
Alto Historical Association's
publication. The Story of May
field, 1850-1925, only the
saloons were thriving. The
townspeople could not bring
themselves to give up their se
curity on a venture as
"dubious" as a university.
When Mayfield refused to re
linquish its saloons, Stanford
took his business elsewhere.
'Dry' Palo Alto
In 1890, Palo Alto consisted of
one grainfield and 15 houses.
This obscure settlement was to
become the center for all the
housing and shopping needs of
those associated with the Uni
versity, and the realization of
Stanford's dreams.
Palo Alto grew rapidly — mi
nus alcohol. Sen. Stanford, with
the help of Timothy Hopkins,
succeeded in passing a "liquor
reversionary clause'' which was
intended to perpetually bar all
liquor sales from any part of the
ultimate City of Palo Alto. By
the end of the 19th century, Palo
Alto overshadowed Mayfield.
The Mayfield residents began
to eye their younger and more
prosperous neighbor with envy.
Prof. Arthur Clark, mayor-elect
in 1903. endorsed the prohibition
of alcohol, leading the towns
people 10 pass an ordinance,
similar to that of Palo Alto's

"strictly .or business
purposes."
When Mayfield went "dry,''
its liquor establishments trans
ferred their businesses to Menlo
Park, and thereafter, the "May
field Road" in the Stanford
story and song became the
"Road to Menlo "
Incorporation
Mayfield, however, did not
end until July 2. 19*25. when it
was finally incorporated into
Palo Alto. At the time of annex
ation, Palo Alto's population
was 9000. Mayfield's, 1700.
Today, the area once known
as Mayfield is ihe section in
South Palo Alto bordered by
California Ave.. El Camino
Real, Page Mill Road and the
railroad tracks.
The area boasts of neither
beauty nor charm. Tree-lined
streets cloak the homes and
businesses in quiet, and the old
and modern buildings sit side
by-side in reckless fashion. Cali
fornia Avenue is the only street
which hints of recent rejuvena
tion, bearing a resemblance to
Palo Alto's University Avenue.
A look around this part of
Palo Alto brings one surprising
fact to light. Within the perim
eter of the town which was once
famous for its saloons, there is
no tavern to be found
Mayfield Avenue, however, is
being used today for the same
purpose as the old "Road to
Mayfield" — on Friday and Sat
urday nights, students can still
be seen trekking along that path
in search of fun and festivity.

Real, Page Mill Road and the
railroad tracks.
The area boasts of neither
beauty nor charm. Tree-lined
streets cloak the homes and
businesses in quiet, and the old
and modern buildings sit side
by-side in reckless fashion. Cali
fornia Avenue is the only street
which hints of recent rejuvena
tion, bearing a resemblance to
Palo Alto's University Avenue.
A look around this part of
Palo Alto brings one surprising
fact to light. Within the perim
eter of the town which was once
famous for its saloons, there is
no tavern to be found
Mayfield Avenue, however, is
being used today for the same
purpose as the old "Road to
Mayfield" — on Friday and Sat
urday nights, students can still
be seen trekking along that path
in search of fun and festivity.
Long before the Italian House
began serving pizzas, before
"Beta Nooners" became a Stan
ford tradition and before
freshmen staggered through the
first pledging ceremony on the
strip now known as "the Row,
Mayfield Avenue was a popular
trail.
In 1891, when the University
opened its doors, Mayfield Road
led students from the liquorless
campus to the small town of
Mayfield and its 13 famous
saloons
Stanford differed greatly
from the University of today in
that the faculty had a strong
prohibitionist leaning, and stu
dents with Bacchanalian in
clinations were forced to make
merry elsewhere. The San
Francisco Chronicle on Nov. 10,
1901, summed up May field's
role:
"There is a tavern in the town
of Mayfield, with a back room
where beer drinking can be car
ried on in safety, and this room
is the scene of much revelry on
Friday and Saturday nights. It is
only a little bare apartment,
with beer steins along the walls
by way of decoration and a pile
of empty decorations in one cor
ner. But tradition has made it
the most famous spot in the re
gion of the University. For the
past 10 years that ugly little
room has made university his
tory. It is mentioned in all the
student songs; it lives in all the
student traditions.
. . Oh, there's the road to May
field,
as plain as plain can be,
And if you want to see a wreck
just take a look at me:
For Fue been to Mayfield
and tasted of the beer,
And that is why my eyes are
weak —
I need to rest a year.
Leroy Ladd, '07
What became of this beloved
tavern and that congenial town
of Mayfield?
Both died at the hands of
teetotaler Leland Stanford.
In 1886, when the newly
elected senator decided to build
a University in memory of his
son, he approached the citizens
of Mayfield with his plans for
making that community his

"university town." His condi
tion was that the saloons be
closed down — a risk the short
sighted townspeople were un
willing to take. The decision
was the beginning of the end for
the town of Mayfield
Mayfield. now a part of South
Palo Alto, was founded in 1853
by -James Otterson alongside
the dirt highway known today as
El Camino Keal. Gold had been
discovered in California, and
streams of American settlers
rode the weekly fast coach ser
vice between San Francisco and
San Jose.
Otterson opened "Uncle
Jim's Cabin." a roadhouse. for
weary travelers. Located on
what is now the corner of El
Camino and California avenues,
it featured a saloon, an inn, a
stage shop and mail service.
Prosperity
In 1850. William Page, at age
18. left New York to try his luck
in California. Successful in min
ing, he returned to Mayfield two
years later to give lumber a try.
Page's Mill Road ran between
the stacks of piled redwood
lumber in his yard and the mills
of La Honda and the Alpine
Creek regions of the adjacent
Coastal Range.
By 1857. the flourishing com
munity of Mayfield contained a
butcher shop, a blacksmith
shop, a grocery store and a log
cabin school. A physician and a
judge were also part of this
growing community.
The 1870s were the peak of
prosperity for Mayfield, which
by then was an important

shipment point for logs, timber
and grain.
Hard times hit Mayfield at
the turn of the decade.
It was then that Sen. Stanford
approached its citizens with his
offer. According to the Palo
Alto Historical Association's
publication. The Story of May
field, 1850-1925, only the
saloons were thriving. The
townspeople could not bring
themselves to give up their se
curity on a venture as
"dubious" as a university.
When Mayfield refused to re
linquish its saloons, Stanford
took his business elsewhere.
'Dry' Palo Alto
In 1890, Palo Alto consisted of
one grainfield and 15 houses.
This obscure settlement was to
become the center for all the
housing and shopping needs of
those associated with the Uni
versity, and the realization of
Stanford's dreams.
Palo Alto grew rapidly — mi
nus alcohol. Sen. Stanford, with
the help of Timothy Hopkins,
succeeded in passing a "liquor
reversionary clause'' which was
intended to perpetually bar all
liquor sales from any part of the
ultimate City of Palo Alto. By
the end of the 19th century, Palo
Alto overshadowed Mayfield.
The Mayfield residents began
to eye their younger and more
prosperous neighbor with envy.
Prof. Arthur Clark, mayor-elect
in 1903. endorsed the prohibition
of alcohol, leading the towns
people 10 pass an ordinance,
similar to that of Palo Alto's

"strictly .or business
purposes."
When Mayfield went "dry,''
its liquor establishments trans
ferred their businesses to Menlo
Park, and thereafter, the "May
field Road" in the Stanford
story and song became the
"Road to Menlo "
Incorporation
Mayfield, however, did not
end until July 2. 19*25. when it
was finally incorporated into
Palo Alto. At the time of annex
ation, Palo Alto's population
was 9000. Mayfield's, 1700.
Today, the area once known
as Mayfield is ihe section in
South Palo Alto bordered by
