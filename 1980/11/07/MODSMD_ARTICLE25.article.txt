# Bridge provides help for students' problems
## 
### Karen Springen 
The Bridge, the completely student-run and
organized peer counseling center here, offers
everything from general advice to help in
crisis situations.
The general peer counseling service has un
dergone several changes since it began as a
drug crisis center about 10 years ago. Recently
the Bridge has increasingly shifted its em
phasis to serve primarily students. Though
non-students are not turned away, the former
community service now only advertises on
campus.
The Bridge still suffers somewhat from its
stigma as a '60s hang-out, said Goldman. "But
it's very much a now' organization,'' he
added
The service tries to appeal to a diverse
group. The 30 staffers include frat men,
"earthy people," pre-meds and lit majors, said
Goldman.
But the Bridge wants to attract more gradu
ate students. "Graduate students have been ig
nored by a lot of the organizations," said Gold
man "They're a lot more independent from
the Stanford system." He added that they are
often "more set in their ways" than under
graduates.
According to senior Kathv Poling, publicity
director for the Bridge, "You have to present a
different image to appeal to them. Pro
fessional students like it more like a business."
She added. "This is very much an under
graduate campus in the way social activities
are set up."
Poling emphasized the informal basis and
equal level on which staffers talk with drop-ins
and phone callers. "Our whole ideology is that
we're not here to solve your problems — we're
here to help you solve them yourself."
Common problems dealt with include de
pression. relationships, alcohol, academic and
career decisions. Gay counseling is also avail
able.
All discussions are confidential and no re
cords are kept.

Bridge programs include a variety of work
shops. two peer counseling classes and campus
outreach
Workshop topics range from bread-baking to
massage to skin care to self-assertiveness. All
are offered for free except for
cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which has a $3
enrollment fee.
Two sections of a peer-counseling class are
taught each quarter One is offered for credit..
The two-unit training course in intensive peer
counseling is taught by Clinical Associate
Prof. Vincent D'Andrea, "the father of the
Bridge The non-credit course is taught by
peer counselors.
The course is a very good self-learning
process." said Goldman "People become re
ally aware of themselves."
the class teaches approaches to listening
and problem-solving. All staffers take the
course and go through a periud of co-staffing.
Interested course graduates can enter the
counseling, teaching or administrative side of
the Bridge
Staffing generally involves two to four hours
per week There are also seven coordinators
and four live-in staffers. Live-ins provide all
night phone duty in exchange for free boarding
at the Bridge.
Outreach, a service beyond the walls of the
Bridge, offers growth games and massage
workshops to interested dorms and organiza
tions. The games "increase personal and group
awareness and interaction," said Goldman.
Phone calls far outnumber drop-in visits.
The service receives about 900 phone calls per
quarter as opposed to about 120 drop-in vis
itors.
Senior Dave Claman, a two-year staffer,
said he is most often approached about prob
lems with relationships. Students are often un
able to discuss a problem on a grand scale with
their friends, he said.
The Bridge operates solely from the pro
ceeds of the Spring Fa ire. Coordinators are the
only paid staff members.
