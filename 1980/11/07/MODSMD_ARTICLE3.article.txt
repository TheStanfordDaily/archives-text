Los Angeles — President-elect
Ronald Reagan warned Iran yester
day that it would not get a better deal
from the United States by delaying re
lease of the 52 American hostages un
til after he takes office on Jan. 20.
"We want those people home," Re
agan said at his first news conference
since his landslide election victory
Tuesday.
But Reagan also made it clear that
he would not try to interfere with
President Jimmy Carter's handling of
the hostage problem.
"Foreign leaders must be aware
that the president is still the presi
dent," he said, while adding that he
would not hesitate to offer suggestions
to Carter if it would help speed up the
release of the hostages "by one
minute."
"I hope . . . that the Iranians will
not have any ideas that there will be
profit to them in waiting any period of
time," Reagan said, referring to the
two-and-a-half month interval until

his inauguration Iranian officials
were quoted Wednesday as saying that
Reagan's victory over Carter might
delay the negotiated release of the
hostages captured over one year ago.
Calm and composed, the former
California governor, with Vice Presi
dent-elect George Bush at his side, re
sponded to 33 questions in slightly
more than a half hour during a na
tionally televised news conference at
the Century Plaza Hotel here.
Moral majority
Reagan was asked whether, in
forming his Cabinet, he would give
special consideration to the views of
conservative groups and the Moral
Majority, a Christian organization
headed by the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who
strongly backed his candidacy.
"1 am going to be open to these peo
ple," he said. "I am going to want to
seek advice where I think that I can
get advice from those who are famil
iar with a particular problem. In other
words, I'm not going to separate my
self from the people who elected us."

But he said he would welcome rec
ommendations from "any group or
any individual" on Cabinet choices.
Tax cut
On the domestic front, Reagan in
vited the Democratic-controlled Con
gress to act immediately on his plan
for a 30 percent tax cut phased in over
three years during a post-election ses
sion starting Nov. 12.
"It would be just fine with me if
they don't wait," he said. Declaring
that his economic program was the
most important issue of his successful
campaign. Reagan added:
"I expect to move as swiftly as pos
sible ... I think it is what the Ameri
can people told us with their votes that
they wanted."
Hiring freeze
The president-elect also said he
would order a federal hiring freeze on
the day he takes office and would "ag
gressively pursue the subject of equal
rights for women."
Cabinet selections, Reagan said,
should be completed within a month,
by late November or early December.
Blacks and other minorities will be
considered for the Cabinet, he said,
but Reagan declined to discuss names
of possible appointees, turning away a
question, for example, on whether he
would consider Henry Kissinger for
secretary of state.
Foreign policy
The Republican winner, apparently
trying to reassure the nation and the
world about his conduct of foreign pol
icy, made these major points:
— Democrats could very well be in
his Cabinet because "I want the world
to know that there is no political
division that affects our foreign poli
cy"
— The Soviet Union's "policies of
aggression" must be discussed during
a new round of arms controls nego
tiations that he favors to replace the
SALT II treaty. "In other words, I be

lieve in linkage,' he said.
— "We believe in the importance of
the NATO alliance and will do every
thing we can to reassure them
(Western European allies) that we are
not going it alone."
— Three prominent Democrats —
Sen. Henrv Jackson (D-Wash.), Sen.
Richard Stone (D-Fla.h and Edward
Bennett Williams, a Washington law
yer and former Democratic Party
treasurer — were named to Reagan's
interim foreign policy board, joining a
group of Republicans including
former President Gerald F'ord and
Kissinger.
Jackson
Jackson, however, has made clear
that he would prefer being secretary
of state rather than secretary of de
fense, a post for which he is reportedly
under consideration.
On other foreign subjects, Reagan
avoided a direct answer on whether he
would see Prime Minister Menachem
Begin of Israel on Begin s scheduled
visit to the United States later this
month.
"There is a delicate point here as to
whether you seem to be. again, putting
yourself in the place that is not yet
mine, the presidency, and I wouldn't
want to do anything in any way that
would give that impression, and again
1 recognize the necessity of contact
but deciding when that is proper and
right, they haven't settled on." Re
agan said of a possible Begin meeting.
On another subject, Reagan de
clared his confidence in Sen. Howard
Baker (R-Tenn.), the GOP minority
leader who is expected to become ma
jority leader of the next Senate when it
convenes in January, since the Re
publicans have won 53 of the 100 seats.
"His position is solid.'' Reagan
said, asserting that there would be no
effort by conservative Republicans to
remove Baker from the leadership
position.
