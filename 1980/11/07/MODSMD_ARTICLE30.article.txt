# Traditional weddings come back
## 
### Mike Resnick 
Love has always been hard to define; it
has a different meaning for everyone. But to
an increasing number of people, love means
a traditional church wedding in a sentimen
tal place.
Last year there were 150 weddings at Me
morial Church; one every two hours on
almost every Saturday. Although only Stan
ford students, alumni, faculty, staff or their
children may be married at the church,
couples must file applications for their wed
dings at least six months in advance of the
ceremony.
Reverend Wendy Smith, associate dean
of Memorial Church and director of its wed
ding program, suggests that the resurgent
popularity of the traditional wedding re
flects the desire for stability at a time in
which "there is an uncertainty about values
in our country and about what is solid and
stable."
Smith says that despite this atmosphere,
"the values of the church have remained the
same."
In addition to having grown substantially
in frequency over the last 10 years, most
weddings at Memorial Church are now
more formal. The usual bride and groom no
longer write their own vows, but exchange

instead a more standard "I do." There are
few requests for garden ceremonies, says
Smith
Even so. each wedding is a unique prod
uct. Bride and groom must order flowers,
arrange for photographers, invite guests
and organize rehearsals. According to wed
ding coordinator Carol Burke, "putting on a
wedding is like opening night of a Broadway
show." With several "opening nights" a
week. Burke's office remains busy.
Tradition begins
The pace, however, didn't start out at that
rate. Reverend Robert Minto, chaplain of
the University until 1973, says that weddings
at Memorial Church didn't really become
popular until the 19205.
In 1903. the first year in which weddings
were performed in the church, there were
three. There were four and then two in 1904
and 1905.
There was only one wedding in the newly
reconstructed church in 1913. By 1927, 83
weddings were performed.
The first couple married in Memorial
Church, William Holt and Ethel Rhodes
Holt, were both members of the class of
1902. The Holts became staunch Stanford
supporters and they were so proud of the
tradition thev started that thev willed their

matching gold wedding rings to the Univer
sity.
One of the biggest weddings Minto recalls
was that of Bob Mathias, the two-time win
ner of the Olympic decathlon. Also in the
1950s was the double wedding of two sisters
and the marriages of two daughters of then-
Stanford president. J.E. Wallace Sterling.
Forgetful groom
At that time, weddings were not the pre
cisely orchestrated productions they are to
day. Minto remembers one particular in
stance in which the groom repeatedly forgot
to bring the marriage license to rehearsals.
Unfortunately, he also neglected to bring it
to the ceremony.
Minto had to stall the wedding for more
than an hour so that a friend of the groom
could bring the certificate to the church
before the service was over. "1 was never so
dignified and stately in all my life!"
Today, with Burke's help, most weddings
run smoothly. The cost of a Memorial
Church wedding, including the services of
both Burke and a minister is $300.
Weddings of any denomination can be
performed there although few non-Chris
tian weddings take place. And, like so many
other pursuits, a letter of application is re
quired.
