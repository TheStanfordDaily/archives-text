# Iraqi reactors closed to inspection

By The Washington Post
Paris — Iraq has blocked inspection of its
nuclear plants, raising uncertainties about
international safeguards over weapons
grade nuclear fuels in a war zone as well as
about the fate of two French-built reactors
near Baghdad.
A spokesman for the International Atom
ic Energy Agency (lAEA), which inspects
nuclear installations to guarantee against
illegal diversion of materials for military
purposes, said the agency was informed by
Iraq that its inspectors cannot come to
Baghdad to check the two reactors during
the current war.
Iraq has signed the nuclear non-prolifera
tion treaty and it has also concluded a spe
cial safeguards treaty with the Vienna
based agency that normally would make
such inspections mandatory. Neither agree
ment covers war situations, however.
There were reports that the Iraqi reac
tors may have been damaged by Iranian air
strikes during the first week of their current
war.
A spokesman for the lAEA said Iraq told
the agency that it "would be informed as
soon as safeguards inspections can be re
sumed." The spokesman said, "We will be
insisting again and again" on the resump
tion of inspections.

French officials are indicating extreme
embarrassment over the uncertainty sur
rounding the reactors, known as Osirac and
Isis, in a war situation. They say that it
places the whole problem of nuclear pro
liferation in a new light and that the prob
lem should be carefully examined by the in
ternational community.
"We are in a completely new situation
that was not foreseen in any international
treaties," said a knowledgeable French
source. "The problem is raised for interna
tional reflection just as sharply as it was in
1974 when India made its explosion."
Thought must now be given, he said, to
finding safeguards against diversion of ma
terials from nuclear facilities in war zones.
A spokesman for the lAEA said that in re
sponse to its request, Iraq had given its as
surance of "the integrity of all materials
subject to safeguards."
A French press report based on in
terviews with French nuclear technicians
repatriated from the Iraqi nuclear center
near Baghdad said that the 26 pounds of
highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium
fuel powering the research reactor Isis, the
smaller of the two reactors, has been re
moved and that the irradiated material is
being stored in water in an underground
canal.

Vienna agency inspectors normally are
on hand when nuclear fuel is loaded into a
reactor. They install closed-circuit tele
vision cameras with seals that are con
sidered to be tamperproof around the reac
tor core, and they visit the reactor on a regu
lar schedule to check the seals.
The French noted that once uranium fuel
is irradiated for use in a reactor, it cannot
be used for weapons production without
going through highly complicated reproc
essing that the Iraqis are not equipped to
perform. While the uranium fuel belongs to
Iraq, the French have made it known
privately on a number of occasions that if
the Iraqis ever tried to keep spent uraniurfi
fuel instead of returning it to France for re
processing, further supply would be im
mediately cut off.
If it were still useable, the uranium would
only be enough for one bomb. But the Iraqis
have bought from Italy a device, known as a
"hot cell," that permits technicians to learn
how to extract the plutonium needed to
make a bomb even from irradiated
uranium. The United States protested to Ita
ly the sale of that piece of equipment. It is
not large enough to extract enough
plutonium to matter in a reasonable period,
but experts say a scientist could learn how
to do it on a larger scale with the device.
