## Shepard offers dreams, despair 
### Richard Bliss 
Sam Shepard, whose play
Curse of the Starving Class is
the Drama Department's cur
rent production, cares for the
little man. His plays are full of
the extravagant dreams that
support the dregs and outcasts
of American society. Dreaming
is what makes his characters
real and involving; the failure of
their dreams and aspirations
gives Shepard's work its force
and urgency.
The broken-down family in
Curse of the Starving Class
dreams of escape. The daughter
(Electra McDowell) and the
father (Brian Woolliams) wish
to run for Mexico. Alaska, with
its icy emptiness, tempts the
son (Paul King), while the
mother (Margie Hilliard)
dreams of Europe with its
"castles and fancy food." Such
illusions are absurd and im
possible. We understand that
the family wishes to escape
from each other and, more im
portantly, from themselves.
Their escape turns on their
own dispossession. They at
tempt to cheat each other out of
the small farm which is all they
own in the world. Alliances
form and dissolve. The children
are caught in the middle. The
family members alternate be
tween savaging and supporting
one another. An oleaginous law
yer (Greg Raffelson) and a
greasy bar owner (Larry
Kaiser) join separate con
spiracies to take advantage of
the mother's greed and the
father's drunken incompetence,
but all the plans come to noth
ing. By the end of the play,

things are as bad as they can be.
Escape is no longer a possibility
â€” only perpetual retreat.
In the third act, the father at
tempts to rebuild his farm and
revitalize his family. He cooks
breakfast and does the laundry.
But it is too late. He is in too
deep to recoup his losses. Fami
ly life offers no more hope than
escape. The son realizes he can
only fill his father's shoes by re
peating his father's failures, not
by emulating his strength. The
daughter loses herself in a wild,
formless rebellion. The play
ends with a vivid image of
meaningless destruction. Hope
less despair and bloody
apocalypse are Shepard's two
options.
Shepard has a wonderful ear
for the coarse vulgarity of com
mon speech. His dialogue rings
true and fitfully achieves a pow
erful, graphic glow. Some of the
longer soliloquies would not suf
fer from harsh editing. The
highly-mannered emotional
style of acting with which the
play begins works against the
realistic element of the play.
Shepard heightens the vulgar
realism of his play by including
on-stage urination, male nudity
and live animals.
Electra McDowell, as the
daughter, excited by her new
found sexuality, and the brave,
sullen son (Paul King) are both
well acted, but the stage belongs
to Brian Woolliams (the
father). In the first and second
acts he is the perfect drunken,
dangerous, irrational old man.
In the third act his trans
formation to triumphant, tran
quil father is convincing.
