# XTC sings (atonally) of survival
## 
### David Lyon 
In the midst of Dadaistic surrealty, near
the flashing red nipples of a neon aphrodei
ty, and efflorescent erotographs of stages in
the night, where the Cal-dropout barker
urges, "It's disgusting; you'll love it,"and
the double-chinned Greek in a Shriner's cap
gurgles lasciviously and points to the door;
in the midst of such singular aspirations, we
sat, on the dirty, red carpcted floor of the
Stone's lowest tier, and waited to see XTC.
The club was nice enough, with a newly
cleared area next to the stage for dancing,
and waitresses, black-panted and mini
skirted, begging orders for $1.75 Buds and
sodas (for a quarter cheaper). Our English
dissonants were not the first to play, nor the
second, and at 9:30 Los Microwaves ap
peared, and we presumed they would be
done in 30, 45 or 60 seconds. So they began,
and the lead singer became embarrassed
and angry at dancing gracelessly alone, but
it wasn't our fault what with her unpleasant
yelling, uninspired songs, and mundane key
boardism. They had some moments, how
ever, like the reminders of African safari
movie soundtracks, and the fine unre

quested encore number, an instrumental.
Then a break, "No. nothing, thank-you,"
and then Oinga Boinga, who deserved a
show all their own. A less-jarring Pere Übu,
- their music displays a marvelous syn
cretism. embracing the '50s, '60s and '80s.
The vocalist had the dynamism of an early
David Byrne, with fine pitch modulations,
tone truncations and yodels. The incessant
brevity of the new wave, the beat of the '60s,
and the inanity and luxuriant saxophony of
the '50s were combined into a rich sound
void of nostalgia. As yet, they have only re
leased an EiP, Oinga Boinga.
"No, nothing," another break, and every
body waiting, and then the lights, and there
they were, and everybody standing, and
then they began, and everybody dancing and
clapping: Oh. the atonalities of XTC! The
acronvmous lads from England, with all the
political insight and social awareness of the
Gang of Four but with more talent, began
with "Outside World":
She has six swans singing in the sauna,
but she don't know what's going on,
In the outside world.
And Andy Partridge pointing outside to

Broadway, and leericising to the clang and
clatter of leapfrogging partials and ill
mated chords, but still the music was there,
like the butterfly in the roarshock, and this
was more than enduring and Faulkner
would have been proud. The songs were
from Drums and Wires, their third album,
and Black Zoo, their yet unreleased latest.
Andy Partridge was exuberant and scowl
ing, letting his lyrics slide into delirium, as
what were once words became long gnarled
groans, and no one stopped dancing. Even
Colin Moulding was energetic, unlike his
laconic performance a year ago.
The vibrant performance was enhanced
by the zig-zag scribble films, especially the
Venetian blind effect on the special long
version of "Scissorman," XTC's songs lend
themselves to development and variation:
the musical tension encouraging an in
strumental antagonism, which sings of sur
vival but not necessarily fitness.
The bands superb, the club accommodat
ing, we left, full of bourgeois de vie. Out
side, a marooned Impala bumped and
ground its way along the street, with air
shocks and a For Sale sign in the window.

yelling, uninspired songs, and mundane key
boardism. They had some moments, how
ever, like the reminders of African safari
movie soundtracks, and the fine unre

quested encore number, an instrumental.
Then a break, "No. nothing, thank-you,"
and then Oinga Boinga, who deserved a
show all their own. A less-jarring Pere Übu,
- their music displays a marvelous syn
cretism. embracing the '50s, '60s and '80s.
The vocalist had the dynamism of an early
David Byrne, with fine pitch modulations,
tone truncations and yodels. The incessant
brevity of the new wave, the beat of the '60s,
and the inanity and luxuriant saxophony of
the '50s were combined into a rich sound
void of nostalgia. As yet, they have only re
leased an EiP, Oinga Boinga.
"No, nothing," another break, and every
body waiting, and then the lights, and there
they were, and everybody standing, and
then they began, and everybody dancing and
clapping: Oh. the atonalities of XTC! The
acronvmous lads from England, with all the
political insight and social awareness of the
Gang of Four but with more talent, began
with "Outside World":
She has six swans singing in the sauna,
but she don't know what's going on,
In the outside world.
And Andy Partridge pointing outside to

Broadway, and leericising to the clang and
clatter of leapfrogging partials and ill
mated chords, but still the music was there,
like the butterfly in the roarshock, and this
was more than enduring and Faulkner
would have been proud. The songs were
from Drums and Wires, their third album,
and Black Zoo, their yet unreleased latest.
Andy Partridge was exuberant and scowl
ing, letting his lyrics slide into delirium, as
what were once words became long gnarled
groans, and no one stopped dancing. Even
Colin Moulding was energetic, unlike his
laconic performance a year ago.
The vibrant performance was enhanced
by the zig-zag scribble films, especially the
Venetian blind effect on the special long
version of "Scissorman," XTC's songs lend
themselves to development and variation:
the musical tension encouraging an in
strumental antagonism, which sings of sur
vival but not necessarily fitness.
The bands superb, the club accommodat
ing, we left, full of bourgeois de vie. Out
side, a marooned Impala bumped and
ground its way along the street, with air
shocks and a For Sale sign in the window.
