# Catch the Police
## 
### Mike Lopez 
Early in 1978, A&M Records
released a single by a group
called The Police to see if an
album was warranted. That sin
gle was called "Roxanne." And
as it turns out. The Police be
came the most successful new
wave act on the A&M label.
Since the single, The Police
have released Outlandos
D'Amour, Regatta De Blanc,
and their very recent album,
Zenyatta Mondatta.
This album seems to be the
next logical extension of The Po
lice's creative talents. Eight of
the album's 10 songs were writ
ten by bassist Sting (Gordon
Sumner), the remaining two by

guitarist Andy Summers. This,
in itself, makes itquite different
from Regatta I)e Blanc, where
Berkeley-bo rn-and-raised
drummer Stewart Copeland
was involved in writing half the
songs. Predictably enough.
Zenyatta Mondatta has the
sound of most Sting composi
tions, which include "Rox
anne." "I Can't Stand Losing
You" and "Message in a Bot
tle."
Even though they have only
exhibited their more esoteric
and "spacey" musical styles in
concert, The Police have in
corporated these styles in sev
eral 3ongs on the new album. In
particular, "Behind My Camel"
is a wandering, somewhat psy
chedelic. instrumental that is
clearly different from most Po
lice compositions. Most of the
other songs on the album are so
stereotypically Police-sounding
that there is no other way to de
scribe them.
As in past albums. The Police
produced and supervised the en
gineering of Zenyatta Mondat
ta. Though the technical quality
is very good, there are some
production techniques which
have detracted from the album.
In "Driven to Tears," the vocal
tracks were dubbed in a pecul
iar way, with the net effect of
making Sting's voice sound like
that of Bob Welch.
I think you will enjoy Zenyat
ta Mondatta, especially if you
are into any form of contem
porary rock. The Police repre
sent a new form in the rock mu
sic evolution, and are possibly
the most talented musical trio
to come out of England since
Cream. If you like to think of
yourself as someone who keeps
up on new music, then this is an
album to catch.
