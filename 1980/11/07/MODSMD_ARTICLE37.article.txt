## Sellout crowd, ABC-TV audience watch Cards hope for '30s revival vs. USC 
### 
By Chris Haft
Ronald Reagan, of all people,
provides Stanford with a fine ex
ample to follow in its crucial Pa
cific-10 Conference football
game against USC.
The president-elect often in
voked the memory of Franklin
D. Roosevelt's New Deal in his
victorious campaign
The Cardinals, for their part,
will actually try to succeed in
recapturing the halcyon '30s be
ginning at 12:50 p.m. tomorrow
at Stanford Stadium
The 6-0-1 Trojans, you see,
have not lost in 27 consecutive
games, tying a school mark es
tablished in 1933. The 26th game
of that initial streak was a 0-0 tie
with Oregon State. No. 27 was a
6-3 triumph over California.
Stanford, however, prevented a
28th consecutive conquest bv de
feating USC. 13-7.
The 26th game of USC's cur
rent streak was also a tie with
an Oregon school — a 7-7 dead
lock with the Ducks Oct. 18. And
Cal again served as the follow
ing victim in last Saturday's 60-7
demolition
So, before Stanford Stadium's
sold-out throng and ABC-TV's
near-national television au
dience, the Cards have the op
portunity to write a chapter in
Ripley's Believe It Or Not,
make lightning strike twice and
basically amaze the hell out of
everybody.
Stanford, of course, would
never admit that a victory over
USC would be an amazing feat.
Yet the Cards do imply that suc

cess will require a monumental
effort on both sides of the ball.
"1 think it will have to be our
best game of the year — from
the nose guard to the line
backers to the free safety," line
backer Tom Hall said.
"1 think the real test of our of
fense will be against USC,"
head coach Paul Wiggin added.
USC head coach John Rob
inson does not hesitate to toot
the Trojan horn. "You're
damned right I think we ought to
be ranked high." he said of his
fourth-ranked squad.
Though amazing would not
describe this year's Trojan
squad, impressive is not far off.
The two unbeaten streaks are
hallowed entries in USC's foot
ball bible. Its commandments:
feature a tailback that gains big
yardage behind a colossal of
fensive line, stifle the opposi
tion with an aggressive defense,
and win, win. win.
And though the Trojans vio
lated certain academic stan
dards, causing their one-year
suspension from post-season
play by the Pac-10, they have
not broken the rest of their cus
toms.
The fleet, sleek 1980 running
back model for USC is junior
Marcus Allen, who has gained a
Pac-10 leading 1080 yards. While
failing to possess the glamour
and even the talents of previous
Trojan tailbacks — O.J. Sim
pson, Ricky Bell, Charles
White, et. ai— Allen certainly
matches their effectiveness.
"He's a slashing runner, un

like Darrin (Nelson), unlike
(UCLA's Freeman) McNeil.
He's not a dancer." Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin said of
the nation's third-leading
rusher
Allen's 4.3 per-carry average
does not prompt drooling. Re
gardless, Wiggin called the 6-
foot-2, 202-pounder "an absolute
threat to us. On a consistent
plav-for-plav basis, he's pretty
good."
What enhances Allen's effec
tiveness is USC's overall effi
ciency. Wiggin pointed out that
the Trojans average a re
markable 7-yard gain on the
first play of an average of
fensive series. ' They get your
attention right now — they set
the tempo," the Card coach
said
Swiss watchmakers would do
well to incorporate the timing of
USC's notorious "student-body
sweep" rushing play in their
products. This play, where
carefully calculated blocks usu
ally spring the tailback for a
huge gain, has brought the Tro
jans infinite fame and first
downs.
"It is one of the most precise
ly run plays I've ever seen,"
Wiggin said.
The Cards are concerned not
only with Allen, but his of
fensive line. Because starting
Stanford nose guard Craig
Awbrey may miss tomorrow's
contest due to an injured knee.
Wiggin has been forced to move
right tackle Duker Dapper to
Awbrev's position and insert
freshman John Bergren at Dap
per's spot.
The problem: Bergren (6-5.
215) must face twin behemoths
Don Mosebar and Keith Van
Home (each 6-7, 265). When
asked if he thought Bergren
could handle the pressure and
the punishment, Wiggin had no
choice but to resort to humor.
"Bergren is a strong-charac
tered kid, but I've been telling
him to gain weight," Wiggin
said. "He came in (to fall prac
tice) at 230 and we've coached
him to 215."
Nobody jokes, however,
about Trojan flanker Kevin Wil
liams. With 25 career touch
down catches, the 5-foot-9. 165-
pound "Bug" is exceeded as a
receiving threat only by Stan
ford's dangerous duo.
"His great speed makes him
open a lot," Wiggin"said of Wil
liams. "He'll do the same thing
to our defense that Ken
Margerum and Andre Tyler do

to other teams."
However, other teams
haven't been able to do a lot to
lISC s defense. The Trojans al
low just 238.4 yards and 11.7
points per game They yield op
ponents just 2.7 yards per
rushing attempt and only 135
yards passing a game. Only five
touchdown passes have been
completed against them. Last
week, thev limited Cal to minus
28 yards rushing and tackled
Golden Bear ballcarriers 15
times for a loss.
Safety Ronnie Lott leads the
conference with six intercep
tions. and Wiggin says admir
ingly of sophomore nose guard
George Achica. "That is a de
fensive lineman." Small won
der Wiggin thinks tomorrow
will be a real test for Stanford's
offense
Vet Stanford. 6-3 overall and
3-2 in the Pac-10. poses a similar
challenge to USC. The Trojans
have not faced any quarterback
like John Elway, who has
thrown for 200 yards or more in
eight of the Cards' nine games
(the NCAA record is 10).
"He has the dominance that a
(Roger) Staubach or a (Bert)
Jones has," Robinson said of
Elway, comparing him to two
prominent NFL quarterbacks.
Nor has USC faced a running
back as multi-talented as
Nelson, who is threatening to
rush for 1000 yards and catch 50
passes in the same season (he's
the only player in collegiate his
tory to accomplish that) for the
third time.
"Nelson is the most exciting
combination of runner and re
ceiver in college football since
Johnny Rodgers. or maybe Bud
dy Young," Robinson said. "I
wish I weren't so afraid of him,
because he'd be fun to just
watch."
When asked about Stanford's
defense, however. Robinson
quickly said. "They're good,"
and changed the subject to extol
the Card offense. That's called
damning with faint praise.
The Cards, however, can still
be blessed with a Rose Bowl ap
pearance. But they must win
tomorrow to keep up with Wash
ington. which leads all eligible
Pac-10 teams with a 3-1 con
ference record.
"I'm just going to play until I
can't walk off the field, if that's
what it takes," said Margerum,
the team's quintessential clutch
performer.
Indeed, the chances are that's
what it will take.
