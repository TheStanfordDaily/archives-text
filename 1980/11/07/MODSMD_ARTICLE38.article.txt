# Darrin Nelson: Stanford's Big Man endures
## 
### 
(Editor's note: What can you
say about Darrin .Nelson? Not a
whole lot that is not already
known Nelson is Stanford's
big-man-on-campus. He's a
star. And deservedly so. The
five-foot-nine, 177-pound jun
ior is closing in on his third
](HH)-yard. 50-reception season.
No one else has even done that
once. It could just be that
Nelson is the finest all-purpose
running back in NCAA history.
But like we said, you knew
that. So why the interview?
Because Darrin Nelson en
dures. We like to hear from him
and about him. It makes us feel
good. Besides, who else can give
xou the inside scoop on this
year's team and tomorow's
crucial game better than the

team 's main focus? In this Fri
day Interview with Mike Oneal,
Darrin talks about his season,
the team, his future and USC.)
Daily: Has this been a satis
fying season for you?
Nelson: I think it's been my best
season so far. Even though I
didn't start off as well as in pre
vious years. I think that down
the stretch this has been my
best year.
Daily: What were your goals at
the beginning of the season?
Nelson: Basically my goal at
'he oeginning of the year was to
do as well in rushing and receiv
ing as I did in the two previous
years I played. That's coming
along pretty good — I think I
need only seven more recep
tions and about 120 more vards.

Daily: You mentioned that you
didn't start off as well as in pre
cious years. Why?
Nelson: Actually, I didn't really
have that slow a start. I think in
my first game I had 122 yards
and then it was sort of slow after
that. I think the reason for that
was that our offensive line was
still learning, I was still learn
ing. 1 had to learn to read things
all over again and things like
that. During the learning proc
ess, you don't do things as well.
Daily: You've had two NCAA
record setting seasons and are
closing on another. Essentially,
you've established yourself as
one of the premier all-purpose
hacks in the country over three
years of play. Rut at the same
time you are not being con

sidered seriously in the run for
the Heisman Trophy. Does that
bother you?
Nelson: No not really. Maybe I
would think about it if I had
played last year, but since I
didn't, it's like starting all over
again. So whether or not I'm
mentioned for the Heisman re
ally doesn't concern me because
it would be just like freshman
winning it.
Daily: Is the trophy something
every good running back thinks
about?
Nelson: I definitely think that a
running back that plays for a
good team and does a lot of good
things has it on his mind. But it's
something that you can't be
come preoccupied with because
otherwise your play starts to go

down in quality.
Daily: To the fans the fact that
you might get 1000 yards
rushing and 50 receptions for
the third time is very impor
tant. Are your stats that impor
tant to you? Do you think about
them very often?
Nelson: In some ways I have to
think about it. The reason I say
that is that there are so many
people on the team that think
about it also. The offensive line
is always talking about gaining
1000 yards and the receivers are
always talking about getting 50
receptions, so it's something
that is placed in my mind all the
time by other people. Then I
think about it because I've done
it before and I know I still have
the physical capabilities to do it
again, so it's something I think
about quite often.
But the most important thing
is to win the games and the sec
ond thing is whether I have a
good time or not. The reason I
play football is to have a good
time. I have a lot of fun when
I'm out there. I wish you guys
could come down in the huddle
and watch me sometimes. I
mean I basically have a really
good time, so I feel it's all
worthwhile.
Daily: How does this year's of
fense compare with the others
you've playedwith at Stanford
led by Guy Benjamin, Steve
Dils and Turk Schonert?
Nelson: I think our offense is
much more potent than those
you just mentioned. I think we
run the ball a lot better than we
used to and I think John (Elway)
is definitely a better quarter
back than Guy or Steve or even
Turk. He's not far and away a
lot better than they are but he is
better. As he matures and plays
longer he will prove that he is
quite a bit better.
Daily: What about the team? It
seems as though this year the
losses aren't quite as devas
tating to the team and the spir
it, considering all that has gone
wrong, is much better. Overall,
the team seems much more con
fident.
Nelson: I think the reason you
say that is that people are enjoy
ing the game and in general that
wasn't true last year because
there were so many other things
going on with the coaches that
took away from the game.
I definitely think that your
head coach can make your col
lege stay extremely enjoyable
or the worst thing in the world.
There are just some people that
really shouldn't be head
coaches, because they don't
have the personality to be a head
coach. You have to be able to re
late to people and I don't think
that's something coach (Rod)
Dowhower did very well.
Daily: Has Wiggin done that?
Nelson: Well, I think so. There
aren't any problems or griev
ances and I think that's how you
can measure a good coach.
Daily: What's the key to beat
ing USC tomorrow?
Nelson: The key is whether our
offense can move the ball
against their defense. It's also
important whether or not our
defense can hold them but I

think it's more important that
we move against them We want
to hold onto the ball and score to
keep their offense off the field.
If we can't, it's going to be a
long game.
Daily: Are you concerned this
week about the fact that you've
onlx had 47 career vards against
use?
Nelson: Yeah, that definitely
concerns me because I would
have liked to have contributed
more against SC. I'm not gonna
take the blame for that because
there's not much I can do. If
they control the line of scrim
mage, I'm gonna have a long
day. That's it — clear and
simple. But I hope this year I'm
able to contribute a little more
and hopefully do a lot better
than 47 yards.

Daily: Will you be back next
year?
Nelson: Yes.
Daily: Hate there ever been
times when you thought dif
ferently?
Nelson: Not really. There were
times when I really thought that
I should leave simply because I
thought I was standing in the
way of other people playing. It
was a conscience thing where I
was thinking that they recruited
Vincent White and Mike Dot
terer so they could play. The
main reason I was thinking that
way was that when they were
being recruited here, the
coaches told them that I'd be a
senior when they were
sophomores and they would
have two years to play. That's
really the only thing that both
ered me about staying.
But it will be my last year
playing college football and my
last year playing here. I'm gon
na try to make it the best year
possible for me and hopefully
for the team also.
