# Darrin Nelson: Stanford's Big Man endures
## 
### 
(Editor's note: What can you
say about Darrin .Nelson? Not a
whole lot that is not already
known Nelson is Stanford's
big-man-on-campus. He's a
star. And deservedly so. The
five-foot-nine, 177-pound jun
ior is closing in on his third
](HH)-yard. 50-reception season.
No one else has even done that
once. It could just be that
Nelson is the finest all-purpose
running back in NCAA history.
But like we said, you knew
that. So why the interview?
Because Darrin Nelson en
dures. We like to hear from him
and about him. It makes us feel
good. Besides, who else can give
xou the inside scoop on this
year's team and tomorow's
crucial game better than the

team 's main focus? In this Fri
day Interview with Mike Oneal,
Darrin talks about his season,
the team, his future and USC.)
Daily: Has this been a satis
fying season for you?
Nelson: I think it's been my best
season so far. Even though I
didn't start off as well as in pre
vious years. I think that down
the stretch this has been my
best year.
Daily: What were your goals at
the beginning of the season?
Nelson: Basically my goal at
'he oeginning of the year was to
do as well in rushing and receiv
ing as I did in the two previous
years I played. That's coming
along pretty good â€” I think I
need only seven more recep
tions and about 120 more vards.

Daily: You mentioned that you
didn't start off as well as in pre
cious years. Why?
Nelson: Actually, I didn't really
have that slow a start. I think in
my first game I had 122 yards
and then it was sort of slow after
that. I think the reason for that
was that our offensive line was
still learning, I was still learn
ing. 1 had to learn to read things
all over again and things like
that. During the learning proc
ess, you don't do things as well.
Daily: You've had two NCAA
record setting seasons and are
closing on another. Essentially,
you've established yourself as
one of the premier all-purpose
hacks in the country over three
years of play. Rut at the same
time you are not being con

sidered seriously in the run for
the Heisman Trophy. Does that
bother you?
Nelson: No not really. Maybe I
would think about it if I had
played last year, but since I
didn't, it's like starting all over
again. So whether or not I'm
mentioned for the Heisman re
ally doesn't concern me because
it would be just like freshman
winning it.
Daily: Is the trophy something
every good running back thinks
about?
Nelson: I definitely think that a
running back that plays for a
good team and does a lot of good
things has it on his mind. But it's
something that you can't be
come preoccupied with because
otherwise your play starts to go

down in quality.
Daily: To the fans the fact that
you might get 1000 yards
rushing and 50 receptions for
the third time is very impor
tant. Are your stats that impor
tant to you? Do you think about
them very often?
Nelson: In some ways I have to
think about it. The reason I say
that is that there are so many
people on the team that think
about it also. The offensive line
is always talking about gaining
1000 yards and the receivers are
always talking about getting 50
receptions, so it's something
that is placed in my mind all the
time by other people. Then I
think about it because I've done
it before and I know I still have
