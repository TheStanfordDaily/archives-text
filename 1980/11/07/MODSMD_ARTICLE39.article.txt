Long Beach State itoday, 3
p.m.) and USC (tomorrow
10:30 a.m.) provide this week
end's opposition at deGuerre
Pool, where the Cardinals have
lost just twice in five seasons.

If (iter polo

Long Beach, ranked seventh
in the country, has beaten pres

tigious teams such as UCLA and
i C-Santa Barbara.
They have the best team
they've had in years." Card
coach Dante Dettamanti said of
the 49ers. "In the past we could
beat them very easily, but now
we have to really work They
have guys who can really gun
the ball -i goalie John) (iansel
will be certainly put to the
test,"
Dettamanti described USC as
a particularly ambitious squad.
They're hoping this is their
NCAA championship team," he
said of the fourth-ranked Tro-

Jans "They've beaten every
bodv but us. California and UC-
Irvine—the top three teams."
Stanford, 22-1-1. defeated

ic-10 Conference Championship
for the Cards and a berth in the
NCAA championship tour

The match that still sticks in
Stanford s craw, however, is
last year's overtime loss to the
Trojans. "That game took awav

our No. 1 ranking and cost us the
league championships." Det
tamanti recalled "And it made
their vear-no. their last four or
five years."
What was so galling was the
way Stanford lost. Despite lead
ing by two goals with two
minutes to play and holding a
one-goal lead and possession of
the ball with 35 seconds left,
USC managed to fight i ack.
Stanford continues to receive
essential contributions from its
reserves, particularly Greg
Lambert, Maurice Mouchawar
and Brian Felix.
