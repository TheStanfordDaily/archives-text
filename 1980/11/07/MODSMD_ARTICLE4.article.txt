## Countries 'merely surviving' 
### Vance McMahan Gail Edmondson-Schares 
The sixth symposium in the series
"Living and Prospering between East
and West" held Wednesday focused on
Austria, Switzerland, and the Scan
dinavian countries, and their relations
with the U.S. and U.S.S R.
Prof. Edgar Andersson of San Jose
State University lectured on the Scan
dinavian countries, while Prof. J.
Murray Luck of Stanford discussed
Switzerland and Prof. Kurt Steiner
focused on Austria. The session was
chaired by Richard Gross of the
School of Education.
Andersson opened the symposium
by giving a whirlwind tour of the Scan
dinavian countries. In general, said
Andersson, Scandinavia cannot be
said to be living and prospering be
tween East and West, but merely sur
viving, because of competition be
tween the U.S. and the U.S.S R. for
Scandinavian favor and loyalty.
Andersson explained that the left
wing government in Greenland, while
officially an American ally, is becom
ing increasingly hostile toward the
U.S. because of American bases in
Thule and Sondre Stromfjord, Green
land.
Similarly. Iceland has become re
sentful of U.S. military presence
there, said Andersson. The country ac
cepts its NATO membership grudg
ingly while facing strong Soviet pres
sure to loosen its NATO ties.
Denmark is another hesitant NATO
member, said Andersson. calling the
country "a reluctant dragon" that re
gards its membership as a "cheap pro
tective blanket." Denmark's military
strength is very weak at this point,
said Andersson. which gives evidence
of the country's lack of commitment
to NATO concerns.
The U.S.'s best ally in Scandinavia
is Norway, according to Andersson.
"The Soviets are trying to penetrate
Norway ideologically and economical
ly but the centrist government just

won't permit it,"he said.
Andersson added that Norway does
face a constant reminder of Soviet
strength as three Russian divisions
are perched on the northern border.
Sweden, Norway's eastern neigh
bor, used to be the most stable country
in Scandinavia, stated Andersson.
However, the defiance of union lead
ers by striking workers and militants
angered by the imposition of heavy
taxes have altered Sweden's com
fortable posture.
Although American culture per
meates the Swedish lifestyle, said An
dersson, the Swedes regularly de
nounce American actions, because of
their "deep fear of Russia." "The
Swedes reason it is better to cuss
someone far away than to cuss some
one on their doorstep. "
Andersson said Finland is often
called "the poor adopted daughter" of
Scandinavia because of strong at
tempts by the Soviet Union to lure the
country away from the West. He cited
a 1948 defense treaty between the two
countries as evidence of the strong So
viet influence there.
However Andersson noted that
there are no Russian forces on Finnish
territory at the present. Furthermore,
his statement that Russia has applied
ideological pressure to Finnish youths
was countered by several Finns in the
audience.
Arto Lietoila, a Finnish graduate
student here, cited the fact that there
is no Russian taught in Finnish schools
as evidence opposing Andersson's
statement.
Lietoila ackowledged some Soviet
pressure on Finland's foreign policy,
as demonstrated by Finland's absten
tions from voting on the Afghanistan
issue in the United Nations But. said
Lietoila, "if you looked in the news
papers in Finland, there was daily pro
test over the invasion of Afghan
istan."
Lietoila said the cornerstone of Fin
nish foreign policy is "to stay away

from foreign crises in the world." Oth
er Scandinavians in the audience
painted similar pictures of the situ
ations in Norway and Sweden, saying
those countries also are minding their
own business and are far from the
crises that Andersson depicted.
Speaking on the subject of Switzer
land, Luck said the country, with a
firm commitment to perpetual neu
trality, shows "no sympathy what
soever" for what takes place in the So
viet Union. Rather, said Luck, the
Swiss have had to contend with the
problem of "foreignization" that
reached a peak in 1974 when every
sixth person in the country was a for
eigner.
Also. Luck added, the recent decline
in foreign workers left many menial
labor jobs open that the foreigners had
been willing to take, but which the
Swiss workers no longer want.

The Swiss economy is nevertheless
very stable, said Luck, with inflation
running at just 5 2 percent in 1979 and
unemployment at less than one
percent.
Turning to Austria. Steiner said un
til 1955. "East and West were in Aus
tria's own house." meaning the coun
try was occupied by the U.S. the
U.S.S.R . Great Britain and France.
The occupying countries withdrew
in 1955 after a thaw in East-West rela
tions, said Steiner. and Austria as
sumed a stance of "active, armed neu
trality." The country maintains a
standing army, said Steiner. with the
intent of making possible enemies
aware that the country is ready to re
sist any possible invasions.
Although Austria's neutrality is in
ternationally recognized, the Aus
trians are not in fact ideologically neu
tral. according to Steiner. "They are
part of the West and make no bones
about it."

Like Switzerland. Austria has a
stable economy, said Steiner, with
only 7 percent inflation, practically no
strikes and a comfortable trade bal
ance. "The Austrians never had it so
good and they know it," Steiner said.
"The country is indeed living and
prospering between the power
blocks."

is Norway, according to Andersson.
"The Soviets are trying to penetrate
Norway ideologically and economical
ly but the centrist government just

won't permit it,"he said.
Andersson added that Norway does
face a constant reminder of Soviet
strength as three Russian divisions
are perched on the northern border.
Sweden, Norway's eastern neigh
bor, used to be the most stable country
in Scandinavia, stated Andersson.
However, the defiance of union lead
ers by striking workers and militants
angered by the imposition of heavy
taxes have altered Sweden's com
fortable posture.
Although American culture per
meates the Swedish lifestyle, said An
dersson, the Swedes regularly de
nounce American actions, because of
their "deep fear of Russia." "The
Swedes reason it is better to cuss
someone far away than to cuss some
one on their doorstep. "
Andersson said Finland is often
called "the poor adopted daughter" of
Scandinavia because of strong at
tempts by the Soviet Union to lure the
country away from the West. He cited
a 1948 defense treaty between the two
countries as evidence of the strong So
viet influence there.
However Andersson noted that
there are no Russian forces on Finnish
territory at the present. Furthermore,
his statement that Russia has applied
ideological pressure to Finnish youths
was countered by several Finns in the
audience.
Arto Lietoila, a Finnish graduate
student here, cited the fact that there
is no Russian taught in Finnish schools
as evidence opposing Andersson's
statement.
Lietoila ackowledged some Soviet
pressure on Finland's foreign policy,
as demonstrated by Finland's absten
tions from voting on the Afghanistan
issue in the United Nations But. said
Lietoila, "if you looked in the news
papers in Finland, there was daily pro
test over the invasion of Afghan
istan."
Lietoila said the cornerstone of Fin
nish foreign policy is "to stay away

from foreign crises in the world." Oth
er Scandinavians in the audience
painted similar pictures of the situ
ations in Norway and Sweden, saying
those countries also are minding their
own business and are far from the
crises that Andersson depicted.
Speaking on the subject of Switzer
land, Luck said the country, with a
firm commitment to perpetual neu
trality, shows "no sympathy what
soever" for what takes place in the So
viet Union. Rather, said Luck, the
Swiss have had to contend with the
problem of "foreignization" that
reached a peak in 1974 when every
sixth person in the country was a for
eigner.
Also. Luck added, the recent decline
in foreign workers left many menial
labor jobs open that the foreigners had
been willing to take, but which the
Swiss workers no longer want.

The Swiss economy is nevertheless
very stable, said Luck, with inflation
running at just 5 2 percent in 1979 and
unemployment at less than one
percent.
Turning to Austria. Steiner said un
til 1955. "East and West were in Aus
tria's own house." meaning the coun
try was occupied by the U.S. the
U.S.S.R . Great Britain and France.
The occupying countries withdrew
in 1955 after a thaw in East-West rela
tions, said Steiner. and Austria as
sumed a stance of "active, armed neu
trality." The country maintains a
standing army, said Steiner. with the
intent of making possible enemies
aware that the country is ready to re
sist any possible invasions.
Although Austria's neutrality is in
ternationally recognized, the Aus
trians are not in fact ideologically neu
tral. according to Steiner. "They are
part of the West and make no bones
about it."

Like Switzerland. Austria has a
stable economy, said Steiner, with
only 7 percent inflation, practically no
strikes and a comfortable trade bal
ance. "The Austrians never had it so
good and they know it," Steiner said.
"The country is indeed living and
prospering between the power

The sixth symposium in the series
"Living and Prospering between East
and West" held Wednesday focused on
Austria, Switzerland, and the Scan
dinavian countries, and their relations
with the U.S. and U.S.S R.
Prof. Edgar Andersson of San Jose
State University lectured on the Scan
dinavian countries, while Prof. J.
Murray Luck of Stanford discussed
Switzerland and Prof. Kurt Steiner
focused on Austria. The session was
chaired by Richard Gross of the
School of Education.
Andersson opened the symposium
by giving a whirlwind tour of the Scan
dinavian countries. In general, said
Andersson, Scandinavia cannot be
said to be living and prospering be
tween East and West, but merely sur
viving, because of competition be
tween the U.S. and the U.S.S R. for
Scandinavian favor and loyalty.
Andersson explained that the left
wing government in Greenland, while
officially an American ally, is becom
ing increasingly hostile toward the
U.S. because of American bases in
Thule and Sondre Stromfjord, Green
land.
Similarly. Iceland has become re
sentful of U.S. military presence
there, said Andersson. The country ac
cepts its NATO membership grudg
ingly while facing strong Soviet pres
sure to loosen its NATO ties.
Denmark is another hesitant NATO
member, said Andersson. calling the
country "a reluctant dragon" that re
gards its membership as a "cheap pro
tective blanket." Denmark's military
strength is very weak at this point,
said Andersson. which gives evidence
of the country's lack of commitment
to NATO concerns.
The U.S.'s best ally in Scandinavia
is Norway, according to Andersson.
"The Soviets are trying to penetrate
Norway ideologically and economical
