# Jog-a-thon to benefit IM complex
## 
### Kirk Avery 
Take heart, all those who
have waited in vain for a rac
quetball court to open, or a
basketball court, or any other
intramural facility The Athlet
ic Department hears your plea.
And all they ask you do is run in
circles for an hour.
The Athletic Department is
sponsoring a jog-a-thon in Stan
ford Stadium Nov. 16, the first
day of Big Game Week A jog-a
thon, for those of you concerned
with its connotation, is not a
competitive race. Runners do
not have to submit their bodies
to unnecessary strain or pun
ishment. A jog-a-thon means no
more than devoting an hour of
your time to casual exercise.
Each runner will walk, jog. or
run around the stadium as many
laps as possible in one hour.
The amount of laps a person
finishes determines how much
money that person can make for
himself or for his group Fifty
percent of the total money goes
to the group or individual, with
the other half going toward the
construction of a new in
tramural complex — the pro
posed deGuerre Plaza
For many years now at the
University there has been a

shortage of athletic facilities,
and in particular intramural fa
cilities. Likewise, there is pres
ently an office space shortage in
the Athletic Department.
Many students have also had
difficulties associated with the
shortage. The intense demand
for basketball and volleyball
courts has often resulted in stu
dents playing intramural games
past midnight.
DeGuerre Plaza is considered
a necessary supplement to Stan
ford's outdated athletic facil
ities. The existing facilities. En
cina Gym (circa 1915) and the
Administration Building (1929),
are in good shape but cannot
possibly handle the increased
interest for sports and partici
pation in undergraduate and
graduate athletics.
The deGuerre complex,
scheduled to be completed by
September 1981, will consist of a
one-story open floor area meas
uring 110 by 180 feet and include
adjacent classrooms, offices
and an outdoor playing court.
The plaza will be built on the
site of the old Encina pools and
will serve as a recreation and
teaching center for the Athletic
Department. The classrooms

and additional office space will
help to alleviate the immediate
overcrowding problem
Of course, the main purpose
of the jog-a-thon is to raise mon
ey toward the $3 million needed
for construction. Approximate
ly 80 percent of that sum has
been donated, with Sydney de-
Guerre and an anonymous donor
the principal wallet-openers.
The remaining $600,000 will
come from other sources, one of
which is the jog-a-thon.
Upon completion, the com
plex will be able to accomodate
such intramural sports as
basketball, badminton, vol
leyball, wrestiling, tennis and
fencing. The additional ability
to hold varsity events and prac
tices in the minor sports allows
flexibility for many teams. The
field house floor features three
basketball/volleyball side-by
side or alternately, one long
court surrounded by folding
bleaches similar to those used in
Maples Pavilion.
The Athletic Department is
hoping for ample participation
in the jog-a-thon. Individuals or
groups may obtain registration
cards at the jog-a-thon office on
the second floor of the Athletic
Department.

Registration deadline is
Monday though sponsor forms
will be accepted up to the 10
a.m. starting time Nov. 16.
Upon registration, partici
pants may pick up sponsor
forms —either mail or "walk
around" — which will be used to
solicit pledges. The amount of
money made depends upon the
amount of money pledged per
lap. Incidentally, the Athletic
Department will handle all the
mailing and billing required to
solicit.
Any participant who com
pletes 25 mail-out forms or an
entire walk-around form will re
ceive a complimentary glass
mug embossed with the Big
Game Jog-A-Thon emblem.
The interest in the jog-a-thon
is reaching levels no one
dreamed of. Several people are
already worth more than $50 per
lap. One participant — former
track coach Payton Jordan —
has sponsors worth more than
$200 per lap.
Since an average person can
walk 12-15 laps in an hour and a
good runner can complete as
many as 45. it becomes clear
that a good deal of money will be
coming into the Athletic De
partment's coffers.

already worth more than $50 per
lap. One participant — former
track coach Payton Jordan —
has sponsors worth more than
$200 per lap.
Since an average person can
walk 12-15 laps in an hour and a
good runner can complete as
many as 45. it becomes clear
that a good deal of money will be
coming into the Athletic De
partment's coffers.
Take heart, all those who
have waited in vain for a rac
quetball court to open, or a
basketball court, or any other
intramural facility The Athlet
ic Department hears your plea.
And all they ask you do is run in
circles for an hour.
The Athletic Department is
sponsoring a jog-a-thon in Stan
ford Stadium Nov. 16, the first
day of Big Game Week A jog-a
thon, for those of you concerned
with its connotation, is not a
competitive race. Runners do
not have to submit their bodies
to unnecessary strain or pun
ishment. A jog-a-thon means no
more than devoting an hour of
your time to casual exercise.
Each runner will walk, jog. or
run around the stadium as many
laps as possible in one hour.
The amount of laps a person
finishes determines how much
money that person can make for
himself or for his group Fifty
percent of the total money goes
to the group or individual, with
the other half going toward the
construction of a new in
tramural complex — the pro
posed deGuerre Plaza
For many years now at the
University there has been a

shortage of athletic facilities,
and in particular intramural fa
cilities. Likewise, there is pres
ently an office space shortage in
the Athletic Department.
Many students have also had
difficulties associated with the
shortage. The intense demand
for basketball and volleyball
courts has often resulted in stu
dents playing intramural games
past midnight.
DeGuerre Plaza is considered
a necessary supplement to Stan
ford's outdated athletic facil
ities. The existing facilities. En
cina Gym (circa 1915) and the
Administration Building (1929),
are in good shape but cannot
possibly handle the increased
interest for sports and partici
pation in undergraduate and
graduate athletics.
The deGuerre complex,
scheduled to be completed by
September 1981, will consist of a
one-story open floor area meas
uring 110 by 180 feet and include
adjacent classrooms, offices
and an outdoor playing court.
The plaza will be built on the
site of the old Encina pools and
will serve as a recreation and
teaching center for the Athletic
Department. The classrooms

and additional office space will
help to alleviate the immediate
overcrowding problem
Of course, the main purpose
of the jog-a-thon is to raise mon
ey toward the $3 million needed
for construction. Approximate
ly 80 percent of that sum has
been donated, with Sydney de-
Guerre and an anonymous donor
the principal wallet-openers.
The remaining $600,000 will
come from other sources, one of
which is the jog-a-thon.
Upon completion, the com
plex will be able to accomodate
such intramural sports as
basketball, badminton, vol
leyball, wrestiling, tennis and
fencing. The additional ability
to hold varsity events and prac
tices in the minor sports allows
flexibility for many teams. The
field house floor features three
basketball/volleyball side-by
side or alternately, one long
court surrounded by folding
bleaches similar to those used in
Maples Pavilion.
The Athletic Department is
hoping for ample participation
in the jog-a-thon. Individuals or
groups may obtain registration
cards at the jog-a-thon office on
the second floor of the Athletic
Department.

Registration deadline is
Monday though sponsor forms
will be accepted up to the 10
a.m. starting time Nov. 16.
Upon registration, partici
pants may pick up sponsor
forms —either mail or "walk
around" — which will be used to
solicit pledges. The amount of
money made depends upon the
amount of money pledged per
lap. Incidentally, the Athletic
Department will handle all the
mailing and billing required to
solicit.
Any participant who com
pletes 25 mail-out forms or an
entire walk-around form will re
ceive a complimentary glass
mug embossed with the Big
Game Jog-A-Thon emblem.
The interest in the jog-a-thon
is reaching levels no one
dreamed of. Several people are
already worth more than $50 per
lap. One participant — former
track coach Payton Jordan —
has sponsors worth more than
$200 per lap.
