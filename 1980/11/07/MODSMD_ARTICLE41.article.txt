# Guest Greeks: the guys from CT

Editors' note: Don't these
kids look like the types you'd
want to introduce to your mom ?
You're right, they're not. Any
uay, Robert Stone and Steve
Odell, the creators of Cardinals
Today, the Daily supplement
distributed at home football
games, will hit the big time
tomorrow trhen their publica
tion reaches 85,000 pairs of
hands. So we thought we'd give
them an early taste of fame by
allowing them to be our Guest
Greeks of the Week. Their pro
nouncements follow:
OSU at WSU: Unfortunately
for Oregon State. WSU is far
lrom the level of ineptness the
Beavers are clinging to. OSU
coach Joe Avezzano was right
when he said the Beavers do not
know what it means to win a
football game. Unfortunately
for them, they will not get their
education tomorrow—just an
other lesson. Samoa Samoa
should roll roll.

Oregon at UCLA: Oregon has
come of age, and tomorrow is
the perfect opportunity for the
Ducks to prove it. Their de
fense, now healthy, is the only
one in the conference which is
capable of containing FYeeman
McNeil. The Bruins are defi
nitely a strong team, but they
were tripped last weekend in
Arizona and now are ready for
the fall.
Arizona at Washington: The
Wildcats are coming off a big
upset of UCLA, and will attempt
to carry the spirit to Seattle.
Washington, on the other hand,
can ill-afford a loss without hav
ing the scent of roses begin to
fade—they've got USC next
week in L.A. Reports from this
desk have it that Arizona's win
streak will end at one.
Cal at ASU: Without Rich
('ampbell. the Bears would have
trouble beating Palo Alto High,
let alone Arizona State. The Sun
Devils also have a couple of ov

erlooked blue-chippers in Mike
Pagel (second in the Pac-10 with
10 TD tosses) and running back
Willie Gittens (510 yards and a
5.7 rushing average), and
they're tough at home.
USC at Stanford: Should be a
barnburner as the conference's
two best offenses hook up. USC
will get most of its yardage on
the ground, but it won't be bor-

ing with Marcus Allen running
the football. When the Cards
have the ball, look for it to be in
the air. Stanford boasts the
three top receivers in the
Pac-10, and quarterback John
Elway is God-like. And don't
forget Darrin Nelson, who
missed last year's 21-21 tie. The
Trojans havfc all the defense,
but Stanford excels in big ones
like these.
