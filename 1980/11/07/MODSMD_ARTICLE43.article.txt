Both the Cardinals 9-10-1 ov
erall, and the Golden Bears,
7-8-1, will be striving to reach
the 500 mark
Stanford enjoyed glittering
records of 16-6 and 14-5-2 the
past two seasons, causing many
to say that this year represented
a regression.
Not so, claims Card coach
Nelson Lodge The reason for
Stanford's less-impressive re
cord, he explained, is its con
siderably more difficult sched
ule. Of the 21 games, Lodge
termed 17 of them "tough."
"We could be 14-0 if I wanted
it." Lodge said. "We could play
Sonoma and Azusa and San Luis
Obispo and Sacramento. But
there has to be a time when you
have to jump out and tangle "
Lodge implied that not many
other schools dared to put to
gether challenging schedules as
the Cards did.
"Nobody went Northwest, but
we went Northwest. Nobody
went East, but we went East,"
he said.
The coach added that Stan
ford managed to beat two teams
ranked in the nation's Top 20—

San Jose State i No. 17) and San
ta Clara (18th at the time Stan
ford beat them).
"I feel good about the sea
son," Lodge said. "If we win,
we can be the best 10-10-1 team
in the country "
The Cards, however, may be
without star Willie Giucci, who
is still bothered by a hip pointer
he suffered Oct. 26 against San
ta Clara.

Fencing vs. Gators

Stanford's unbeaten fencing
teams (2-0) put their un
blemished record on the line
tomorrow against upset-minded
San Francisco State at 11 a.m.
The Gators, 1-1 in NorCal
Conference play, need a victory
to stay in contention for the
league title. For the Cards, 1-0
in the conference, this is an im
portant preparation for their
key match-up against arch-rival
San Jose State Tuesday.
According to coach Jean
Helliwell, the Gators, like Stan
ford, lost heavily to graduation
but have been less able to fill in
the holes.
"We should be a definite fa
vorite on Saturday," Helliwell
said, "but we aren't taking
them for granted. We made that
mistake last Saturday and
almost paid dearly for it." The
Cardinals won a squeaker
against Cabrillo College last
weekend.
Leading the Stanford men's
effort are Jeff Gueble in sabre,

Gary Johnson in epee and Tom
Brannon in foil, while the
Cardinal women are being
paced by newcomers Cathy Cor
rea and Pam Henck.

Fencing vs. Gators

Stanford's unbeaten fencing
teams (2-0) put their un
blemished record on the line
tomorrow against upset-minded
San Francisco State at 11 a.m.
The Gators, 1-1 in NorCal
Conference play, need a victory
to stay in contention for the
league title. For the Cards, 1-0
in the conference, this is an im
portant preparation for their
key match-up against arch-rival
San Jose State Tuesday.
According to coach Jean
Helliwell, the Gators, like Stan
ford, lost heavily to graduation
but have been less able to fill in
the holes.
"We should be a definite fa
vorite on Saturday," Helliwell
said, "but we aren't taking
them for granted. We made that
mistake last Saturday and
almost paid dearly for it." The
Cardinals won a squeaker
against Cabrillo College last
weekend.
Leading the Stanford men's
effort are Jeff Gueble in sabre,

Gary Johnson in epee and Tom
Brannon in foil, while the
Cardinal women are being
paced by newcomers Cathy Cor
rea and Pam Henck.

Both the Cardinals 9-10-1 ov
erall, and the Golden Bears,
7-8-1, will be striving to reach
the 500 mark
Stanford enjoyed glittering
records of 16-6 and 14-5-2 the
past two seasons, causing many
to say that this year represented
a regression.
Not so, claims Card coach
Nelson Lodge The reason for
Stanford's less-impressive re
cord, he explained, is its con
siderably more difficult sched
ule. Of the 21 games, Lodge
termed 17 of them "tough."
"We could be 14-0 if I wanted
it." Lodge said. "We could play
Sonoma and Azusa and San Luis
Obispo and Sacramento. But
there has to be a time when you
have to jump out and tangle "
Lodge implied that not many
other schools dared to put to
gether challenging schedules as
the Cards did.
"Nobody went Northwest, but
we went Northwest. Nobody
went East, but we went East,"
he said.
The coach added that Stan
ford managed to beat two teams
ranked in the nation's Top 20—

San Jose State i No. 17) and San
ta Clara (18th at the time Stan
ford beat them).
"I feel good about the sea
son," Lodge said. "If we win,
we can be the best 10-10-1 team
in the country "
The Cards, however, may be
without star Willie Giucci, who
is still bothered by a hip pointer
he suffered Oct. 26 against San
ta Clara.
