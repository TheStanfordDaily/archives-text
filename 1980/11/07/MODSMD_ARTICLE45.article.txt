When Senator Alan
Cranston stopped at the
Bookstore last week tor an
hour of scribbling and smil
ing. he was joined by his sis
ter Eleanor Fowle. This was
not merely a brotherly
gesture, nor a coincidence —
Eleanor (H E.) is the author
of his biography: Cranston:
The Senator from Califor
nia.
When R E. Fowle began
the enormous task of writing
about her brother, she initial
ly planned to take one year to
complete the biography Six
years later, the entertaining
and informative collection of
anecdotes and political
scenarios is for sale.
What prompted her de
cision to undertake such a
comprehensive and often
delicate endeavor?
"I wanted to understand
his life," says Fowle. "He is
harr! to know. I saw his life as
a sequence of dramatic ups
and downs. The press always
describes him as 'dull.' I
wanted to dispell that il
lusion."
Fowle's unique vantage
point as a sibling allowed her
an obviously special glimpse
into Cranston's life. Yet. the
book seldom reveals a
negative side or admits a

criticism. Was she biased?
"My biggest problem was
that 1 had to show him warts
and all, but I always came
back with something in
nocuous. 1 can't point out any
faults. Someone else will
have to delve into it. but I
don't think the material is
there," she said.
Her consistently positive
portrayal of most politicians
and the political climate is
deliberate and one she de
fends.
"You always read about
the exceptions that are cor
rupt," she emphasized,
saying that she hoped the
book would change some peo
ple's perceptions about the
political process.
"1 wanted to interest peo
ple in politics. 1 am sorry
about all the apparent
cynicism today."
Fowle mentioned her de
sire to "weave an under
standing of recent California
history," one that she ac
complishes by drawing on
her prior experience as
former chair of the women's
division of the Democratic
State Central Committee,
Fowle and Cranston left
the bookstore last week; but,
Fowle left a book full of in
sights that's worth the time
she took writing, to read it.
