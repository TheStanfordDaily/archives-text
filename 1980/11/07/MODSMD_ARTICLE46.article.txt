California

By Aleen Zimberoff
The title explicity crowns him
the senator from California, and
after Tuesday's substantial vic
tory, Alan Cranston is assured
of another six years as such. So.
it is only appropriate that the
people of California have an op
portunity to meet the man
they've elected into national of
fice for three consecutive
terms.
And. Cranston: The Senator
from California is just the vehi
cle to encourage that acquain
tance. From the surprisingly re
freshing pages, we are afforded
an in-depth picture of the sena
tor that a brief handshake in a

Saturday morning shopping
mall could never hope to boast.
Fowle, the author of the book,
is Cranston's older sister and
she captures both the essence of
his personality and the politics
she convinces us he is so dedi
cated to.
We travel with Cranston from
his undergraduate days on "the
farm," through an exciting
jaunt as a foreign correspondent
to a front page back stage tour
of the past 24 decades of Cali
fornia politics.
Fowle acts as a magnifying
glass for the many elections,
campaigns and controversies
that Cranston has survived, if
not conquered, as we skim
through a political scrapbook
that reads like the Fledge of Al
legiance. Among the episodes
she recounts is Adolf Hitler's
suit against Cranston when

Cranston published an edition of
Mein Kampf with footnotes ex
plaining Nazi doctrine and in
tention
Fowle covers an enormous
amount of material in 300 pages
as we skip from Cranston's in
volvement with the World Fed
eralists to the founding of the
California Democratic Council
(CDC), stopping to sweat
through a controller race and
ending up with a seat in the sen
ate. Fowle skillfully sum
marizes his career with the
quote, "A man (Cranstoni who
attends to everything, from Los
Altos sewers to world govern
ment."
The book becomes more than
a gallery of egotistical memo
ries commemorating Cranston.
Though Fowle wastes no time in
relating the contributions he has
made, the vision she offers is far

more encompassing than a
mere chronological resume; the
chapters adopt an almanac-like
usefulness.
We are treated to a political

cocktail party where the one
liners stored in old diaries be
come an integral part of the
scenarios she describes.
The book is packed tight with
pure politics, but somehow
Fowle makes it seem to flow
with as much vitality as Hona
Barrett's sagas. Present is the
intrigue of the political process,
absent is any scent of scandal:
Instead, we are granted -a
guided tour through the de
cisions and debates that shaped
the political environment as we
know it today.
The book is valuable. It is not
a collection of "true con
fessions." It is an examination
of the last 25 years in California
seen "from the top " And. for
once, it is human enough to un
derstand, and credible enough
to believe Maybe Kowie should
run in '86.
