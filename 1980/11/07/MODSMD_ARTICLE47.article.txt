Why read about the tragedy of
a ruined relationship? The cov
er of He/She lures the reader
with promises of mended hearts
and new awareness: "He and
she untangle and reweave.
forming a newness that is . . .
free of the baggage of their his
tories. full of the promise of the
best that is in each of them."
Herbert Gold's novel ex
amines a theme which has run
throughout many unhappy mar
riages of this century: dis
covery by the woman that life as
a wife/mother, alone, is un
fulfilling.
Gold moves in on this scene
like a camera-eye, capturing
the fear and frustration of dis
content. the excruciating pain
and unreality of separation, and
the utterly human refusal to
abandon a shattered rela
tionship.
The plot is familiar. It is

Gold's control and manipulation
of detail which infuse the famil
iar with new vitality and im
pact.
The intimacy and intensity of
Gold's detail make his nameless
characters come alive: "She
had taken a lover. A churning in
the belly- A dizzy disconnection
of eyesight, hearing, touch,
smell, as with a fever. A clap of
heartbeat when he thought of
the rest of his life. His toes were
not straight; his feet did not
touch the earth properly. He
urinated frequently. He sat
groaning on the toilet. His
mouth was dry. He drank more
water. His throat felt con
stricted and his breath whistled
through it. A nerve on his eyelid
twitched ... his razor nicks
hurt . . . I'm going through the
normal difficulties, he
thought."
Other characters are in
troduced throughout the story
but except for their child, Cyn
thia, they serve their purpose
within a chapter or two. and do
not reappear. Gold focuses in

tightly on the couple and their
dilemma. She wants out — his
manner of loving negates her
He is bewildered and still deeply
in love with her.
Gold's observations are sharp
and penetrating: "Is this what
she wanted'.' She chose it'.' She

took her freedom? . . . Once
again, the aching nerve ripped
like a shark through his cheek.
She activated the destruction
under his eye. . he tried to stay
level his cheek was ripping
away."
The only scenes which are un
satisfying. and in some re
spects. dated, are the episodes
in which he and she seek mar
riage counseling from 1960s
type therapists.
Paul and Paula, the Gestalt
couple, and .Jehane of the
Dream Dharma Academy re
main unconvincing and distract
ing. But both he and she find the
therapists equally unconvinc
ing. The sessions merely under
score a desperate situation, and
provide comic relief to the trag
edy of a crumbling marriage.
By the last few chapters, one
begins to wonder where the
promised "newness" is. How
exactly do you "untangle and re
weave," and make all the pain
disappear?
At best, the ending is open to

interpretation. I was disap
pointed The "newness" is un
settling. and full with the pain of
the past. After separation and
divorce, he and she begin to see
each other again When she asks
him why "it had been good"
lately, he answers. "Because I
don't like you very much, my
darling "
To me, his indifference and
detachment are not revitaliz
ing. but disturbing and unsatis
fying. She is still confused and
he is still hurting.

But he falls short in depicting
the revitalization of love which
is so essential to the success of

He/She
Herbert Gold
Arbor House
213 pp. $9.95

Why read about the tragedy of
a ruined relationship? The cov
er of He/She lures the reader
with promises of mended hearts
and new awareness: "He and
she untangle and reweave.
forming a newness that is . . .
free of the baggage of their his
tories. full of the promise of the
best that is in each of them."
Herbert Gold's novel ex
amines a theme which has run
throughout many unhappy mar
riages of this century: dis
covery by the woman that life as
a wife/mother, alone, is un
fulfilling.
Gold moves in on this scene
like a camera-eye, capturing
the fear and frustration of dis
content. the excruciating pain
and unreality of separation, and
the utterly human refusal to
abandon a shattered rela
tionship.
The plot is familiar. It is

Gold's control and manipulation
of detail which infuse the famil
iar with new vitality and im
pact.
The intimacy and intensity of
Gold's detail make his nameless
characters come alive: "She
had taken a lover. A churning in
the belly- A dizzy disconnection
of eyesight, hearing, touch,
smell, as with a fever. A clap of
heartbeat when he thought of
the rest of his life. His toes were
not straight; his feet did not
touch the earth properly. He
urinated frequently. He sat
groaning on the toilet. His
mouth was dry. He drank more
water. His throat felt con
stricted and his breath whistled
through it. A nerve on his eyelid
twitched ... his razor nicks
hurt . . . I'm going through the
normal difficulties, he
thought."
Other characters are in
troduced throughout the story
but except for their child, Cyn
thia, they serve their purpose
within a chapter or two. and do
not reappear. Gold focuses in

tightly on the couple and their
dilemma. She wants out — his
manner of loving negates her
He is bewildered and still deeply
in love with her.
Gold's observations are sharp
and penetrating: "Is this what
she wanted'.' She chose it'.' She

took her freedom? . . . Once
again, the aching nerve ripped
like a shark through his cheek.
She activated the destruction
under his eye. . he tried to stay
level his cheek was ripping
away."
The only scenes which are un
satisfying. and in some re
spects. dated, are the episodes
in which he and she seek mar
