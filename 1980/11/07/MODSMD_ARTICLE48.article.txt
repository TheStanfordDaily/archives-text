Memories are a mixed bag.
Some we forget quickly; others
loiter longer than we wish We
welcome some, try to shake off
others. There is also an odd
bunch we not only fear holding
on to. but also fear losing: mem
ories which hurt us but if for
gotten would take an important
part of us with them. In his first
two books of poetry. Gregory
Orr crafted his poems around
such memories as these, around
the memory of accidentally kill
ing his brother and of having his
mother die not long after. Out of
these came a fine balance be
tween surrealism and realism.

the poems of a survivor hover
ing over two worlds.
In The Red House Orr again
probes those memories, though
the scope of his vision seerr* to
be much wider than in his
earlier books In evoking as the
epigraph to the title sequence
lines from Wordsworth's "Prel
ude" — "Fair seed-time had my
soul, and I grew up . . . Fostered
alike by beauty and by
fear. ..." — Orr appears more
ambitious, attempting to strike
a balance between contentment
and fear.
The poems in the first part of
the book reflect fairly well this
part's title, "A Bouvant Song "
They are not exactly carefree,
but they are lighter than much
of what came before in the
earlier books and what comes

after in this one. In the long,
meditative lines of "Indian
Summer." Orr makes present
the quiet slowness of that sea
son: "The juniper along the
fenceline blue with fruit. / The
peartree nude, its brown and
gold windfall rotting around it.
The woodpile built." And with
the third of "Three Biblical
Songs." he demonstrates his
haunting surrealism at its most
effective point. In the voice of
Doubting Thomas, one of
Christ's apostles, Orr says,
"Show me. I said, what / my fin
gers touch is true. / Then a
wound appeared in air itself,
like a tear in blue fabric, / and I
put my hand into the other
world."
The second part of the book
moves from the general poems

of the first part to poems more
in line with Wordsworth's
"Prelude." Many of the poems
— "Morning Song," "Work
Gloves," and "Sunday School
Picnic. What Endures," for ex
ample — deal with the powerful
sensuousness of childhood and
adolescence, the wonder at
sight and smell and touch.
Orr moves gradually from
these back to the theme of death
with "The Migrant Camp,"
"The Guns," "After a Death."
and "Song of Young
Murderers." in which he writes.
"I don't want any evidence /
against me / when I'm dead. Let
me be part of what your boot
stubs up: / the bandage, the
road."
Also in Part Two is "Lullaby
Elegy Dream." a poem perhaps

most reminiscent of Word
sworth. Orr opens, "Out of the
womb: a ghost, a small one.
Out of the wound / a tree with
gray bark smooth as wrist skin
rose toward the sky."
Part Three, "Walking,"
portrays adeptly the workings
of a person's mind while taking
a long country walk, mingling
the nature that is present to him
with the memories it conjures
up. "The Owl Tree," "Memo
ries of a Half-Dead Black
Cherry Tree Across the Road
from My Childhood House,"
"End of August." and "Walk
ing" do this especially well.
Again, though. Orr turns back
to the contemplation of his
"ghosts." In "After the Guest,"
he seems to be struggling to let

go of his memories of the dead.
And in the final poem in the
book. "A Last Address to My
Ghosts." Orr appears to have
come to the point where he can
free himself from them; "I've
seen the candles you carried /
going out, one by one, / in the
darkness of deep woods. / And
the path 9 The destination? /
There never was one. / I learned
that from you. / There was only
the light / edging the leaves, /
and now that's gone. / Branches
above my head / extend their
dark blessing."
Content, of course, cannot be
separated from form. And what
I have quoted above I felt to be
the most successful of Orr's lyr
ic poetry, at least in The Red
House.

Moving from his first to third
book. Orr has come from an
almost epigrammatic style to a
more sustained lyrical en
deavor. And at his best, say in
"Lullaby Elegy Dream," the
endeavor is consummate.
Unfortunately, this is not con
sistent. And the lapses seem to
occur when he tries most to
bring out significance. When he
lets the poem gradually arrive
at its own apex, there is no prob
lem. But when he tries to force
the poem too quickly into saying
something "important," the
lines become halting and the
content turns sentimental.
There are many instances of
this, though they are, for
tunately, outnumbered by well
crafted writing.
