The bawdy exuberance of
Fanny, in the picaresque tradi
tion of Fielding's Tom Jones, is
well-suited to Erica Jong's tal
ent for sexual frankness Not
only has Jong successfully ma
nipulated 18th century prose,
but she has done much more
than simply create a female
version of Fielding's sentimen
tal hero; Fanny is an 18th cen
tury heroine with a contem
porary feminist consciousness.
Jong defends this seeming
anachronism in the novel's af
terword. explaining her belief

that "in every age there are peo
ple whose consciousness tran
scends their own time. . .
Indeed. Fanny's insights into
the oppressive dilemmas con
fronting women of her era are
believable because the process
of her enlightenment' is deftly
handled. We are able to see Pen
ny's perceptions evolve as her
story unfolds.
The voluptuous 17-vear-old
Fanny is introduced to us on the
fateful night of her sexual initia
tion. It is a disturbing yet hu
morous scene; in one night.
Fanny is acosted by three men;
Alexander Pope, the poet whose
verses captivate Fanny but
whose physical person is re
pulsive; Daniel, her pimplv
faced step-brother; and finally
her own step-father. Lord

Bellars.
Fanny manages to repell the
approaches of both Pope and
Daniel, but Lord Bellars suc
cessfully seduces her, a vio
lation which ultimately spurs
her escape from her "Sweet
Home."
In her flight, under guise of
man's clothing. Fanny begins
her simple philosophizing on the
tribulations of her sex. as she
muses about "being free of the
Fear of Ravishment — which,
unless she dresses as a Man. a
Woman can ne'er, not e'en for a
Moment, forget."
Fanny's encounter with
witches further shapes her
world view, and is of symbolic
significance as well. Here. Jong
has effectively incorporated the
spirit of feminism into the char

acters Joan and Isobel.
In line with the work of the
late anthropologist Dr.
Margaret Murray, the
Goddess-worship that Jong de
scribes defies the notions of
Satanic cults, and Fanny is
taught about the matriarchal
roots and power of witchcraft.
" Tis my Belief that in An
cient Times, in the Pagan Al
bion of Old." explains Isobel,
"Women were not as they are
now, subservient to Men in ev'rv
Respect. Rather they were
Queens, and Priestesses, re
sponsible for the Fructification
of the Crops, and the Multi
plication of the Herds; they
were the Leaders of the Holy
Rituals —"
"E'en the very word
Witch,' " Joan interrupts, "de

rives from our Ancestors' Word
W'icca' meaning only Wise
Woman.' "
Thus Fanny's philosophy be
gins to expand, as she reasons.
"When, in the development of
Human Society . . . one Group.
Sex. or Class is given Dominion
o'er the Other, all the Members
of that Group become in some
Way Corrupted by that Un
reasoning Pow'r . . . Neither
Sex must have Dominion o'er
the Other!"
Life in a London brothel of
fers Fanny yet another
dimension to add to her under
standing of the world, and also
gives her the unique opportunity
to expose the sexual predilec
tions of a number of her notable
contemporaries.
.Jonathan Swift, for example,
is revealed as a man with an ex
ceptional passion for horses;

and John Cleland, we learn, has
a pronounced preference for
playing the "Virginal Maid"
while Fanny acts the part of the
"Swagg'ring Groom."
This latter business acquain
tance is of particular im
portance, since Fanny's disgust
over Cleland's Fanny Hill:
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleas
ure is, ostensibly, the principle
motivation for this auto
biography. She is enfuriated bv
the way his "simp'ring
Strumpet leaves the World to
think that the Whore's Life is
nought but a Bed of Roses."
It is only after her ex
traordinary adventures as a
pirate that P'anny is able to fully
understand the words of her
mentor Joan; "You yourself are
the Creator of your Destiny

. . and Fanny reaches her
final revelation:
"Whilst the Lady in myself
was quiv'ring and quailing in
Cowardice, the Pyrate was
itching to breathe free! ... If
Women could master their
Fates only thro' Pyracy, sobeit!
Banish the Lady from my Soul
for'er more! . . . only when I'd
kill'd the timorous Lady in my
self would I rise like the Phoenix
o'er the Ashes of my former
Life and become the Fanny I
was meant to be!"
Despite the occasional heavy
handedness of Jong's feminist
"message'' in the portrayal of a
woman determined to question
and overcome the prevailing Or
der of her time. Fanny remains
well-crafted, highly entertain
ing, and unabashedly colorful.

The bawdy exuberance of
Fanny, in the picaresque tradi
tion of Fielding's Tom Jones, is
well-suited to Erica Jong's tal
ent for sexual frankness Not
only has Jong successfully ma
nipulated 18th century prose,
but she has done much more
than simply create a female
version of Fielding's sentimen
tal hero; Fanny is an 18th cen
tury heroine with a contem
porary feminist consciousness.
Jong defends this seeming
anachronism in the novel's af
terword. explaining her belief

that "in every age there are peo
ple whose consciousness tran
scends their own time. . .
Indeed. Fanny's insights into
the oppressive dilemmas con
fronting women of her era are
believable because the process
of her enlightenment' is deftly
handled. We are able to see Pen
ny's perceptions evolve as her
story unfolds.
The voluptuous 17-vear-old
Fanny is introduced to us on the
fateful night of her sexual initia
tion. It is a disturbing yet hu
morous scene; in one night.
Fanny is acosted by three men;
Alexander Pope, the poet whose
verses captivate Fanny but
whose physical person is re
pulsive; Daniel, her pimplv
faced step-brother; and finally
her own step-father. Lord

Bellars.
Fanny manages to repell the
approaches of both Pope and
Daniel, but Lord Bellars suc
cessfully seduces her, a vio
lation which ultimately spurs
her escape from her "Sweet
Home."
In her flight, under guise of
man's clothing. Fanny begins
her simple philosophizing on the
tribulations of her sex. as she
muses about "being free of the
Fear of Ravishment — which,
unless she dresses as a Man. a
Woman can ne'er, not e'en for a
Moment, forget."
Fanny's encounter with
witches further shapes her
world view, and is of symbolic
significance as well. Here. Jong
has effectively incorporated the
spirit of feminism into the char

acters Joan and Isobel.
In line with the work of the
late anthropologist Dr.
Margaret Murray, the
Goddess-worship that Jong de
scribes defies the notions of
Satanic cults, and Fanny is
taught about the matriarchal
roots and power of witchcraft.
" Tis my Belief that in An
cient Times, in the Pagan Al
bion of Old." explains Isobel,
"Women were not as they are
now, subservient to Men in ev'rv
Respect. Rather they were
Queens, and Priestesses, re
sponsible for the Fructification
of the Crops, and the Multi
plication of the Herds; they
were the Leaders of the Holy
Rituals —"
"E'en the very word
Witch,' " Joan interrupts, "de

rives from our Ancestors' Word
W'icca' meaning only Wise
Woman.' "
Thus Fanny's philosophy be
gins to expand, as she reasons.
"When, in the development of
Human Society . . . one Group.
Sex. or Class is given Dominion
o'er the Other, all the Members
of that Group become in some
Way Corrupted by that Un
reasoning Pow'r . . . Neither
Sex must have Dominion o'er
the Other!"
Life in a London brothel of
fers Fanny yet another
dimension to add to her under
standing of the world, and also
gives her the unique opportunity
to expose the sexual predilec
tions of a number of her notable
contemporaries.
.Jonathan Swift, for example,
is revealed as a man with an ex
ceptional passion for horses;

and John Cleland, we learn, has
a pronounced preference for
playing the "Virginal Maid"
while Fanny acts the part of the
"Swagg'ring Groom."
This latter business acquain
tance is of particular im
portance, since Fanny's disgust
over Cleland's Fanny Hill:
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleas
ure is, ostensibly, the principle
motivation for this auto
biography. She is enfuriated bv
the way his "simp'ring
Strumpet leaves the World to
think that the Whore's Life is
nought but a Bed of Roses."
It is only after her ex
traordinary adventures as a
pirate that P'anny is able to fully
understand the words of her
mentor Joan; "You yourself are
the Creator of your Destiny

. . and Fanny reaches her
final revelation:
"Whilst the Lady in myself
was quiv'ring and quailing in
Cowardice, the Pyrate was
itching to breathe free! ... If
Women could master their
Fates only thro' Pyracy, sobeit!
Banish the Lady from my Soul
for'er more! . . . only when I'd
