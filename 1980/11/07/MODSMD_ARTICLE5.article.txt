# Crowley discusses Med Center's future
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The Stanford Medical Center will
"concentrate on quality" as an essen
tial complement to progress as it
moves into the 1980s. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Lawrence
Crowley told a gathering of the medi
cal school's faculty yesterday.
Crowley said the facility's "agenda
for the 80s' will include a shift away
from growth toward an attempt to
achieve a proper balance among the
"interdependent trinity:" the medical
school, clinic and hospital.
However, renovations, to be com
pleted in five or six years, will in
crease the medical center's facility
space by 40 percent, he said.The $100
million hospital expansion plan has
been approved by the University's
Board of Trustees, Crowley told the
faculty, and is proceeding on a "roll
forward basis."
Crowley also highlighted the ap
pointment of a new dean for the medi
cal school and the need to improve stu
dent-faculty relations as important
tasks ahead. Crowley's half-hour ad
dress to what he said was the "first
full faculty meeting in a decade"'
noted that the medical center ex
perienced its most marked growth fol
lowing its move to the campus in 1959,
attaining an "enviable status" in the
19605.
"In the '70s, however, there was a
pause in forward motion," Crowley
said, because of a decline in funding

resources. The decline, caused by ex
ternal forces like inflation, energy
costs and a nationwide fall-off in prod
uctivity. resulted in a substantial in
crease in the cost of providing medical
care.
Crowley said opportunities for addi
tional funding exist now in private in
dustry and will be actively pursued.
However, he warned that the Med
Center must keep in mind the fact
that, ' industry's goals are not neces
sarily identical with the Univer
sity's."
Crowley, who has been serving as
acting dean of the medical school
since being appointed vice president
of medical affairs for the University,
said he hopes the search committee
will recommend a new. permanent
dean by the end of this year.
Addressing the issue of faculty
salaries at the medical school.
Crowley reported that the facility
"must remain competitive with other
institutions in terms of salary." and
said the medical center's adminis
tration will be studying the salary
question in the near future.
Before Crowley spoke. l)r John
Collins, chairman of the Faculty Prac
tice Plan, noted that current staff
salaries at the medical school are just
at the level of the national average.
"Without putting too much pressure

on Larrv (Crowley)." Collins said,
"we intend to push in the direction of
raising salaries."
Addressing a sort of negative
growth factor associated with the Uni
versity. Crowley pointed out a "popu
lation shift" which will produce fewer
potential medical students in the next
two decades. "Education is no longer
a growth industry." he said, adding,
however, that the medical schools' ad
missions applicants have remained
high and probably will in the future.
In fact. Crowley said, a study spon
sored by the now-defunct Department
of Health. Education and Welfare
stated that by the year 1990, there will
be 70.000 too many physicians in the
United States. "The current trend
seems to be that there are more doc
tors than we need, " Crowley said.
In the area of student-faculty rela
tions, Crowley reiterated some of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
inaugural remarks and urged the med
ical school faculty to rebuild sound
student-faculty relations.
Crowley also expressed an "antipa
thy to unnecessary competition" in
medical and premedical students'
lives. He cited one study which re
ported 80 percent of the students in a
certain medical school had admitted
to cheating as undergraduates, with 50
percent admitting to have cheated in


Lawrence Crowley
medical school as well. "I'm certainly
for competition, but this is a problem
which is well-documented around the
country. - ' Crowley said. He did not
specify how faculty here should deal
with the problem.
With regard to grading, Crowley
said he favors "achievement-oriented
evaluations," stating that subjective
grading and the bell-shaped curve
"don't belong at Stanford."
"If 80 percent of the students per
form at a superior level, there is noth
ing wrong with saying that," Crowley
added.
He also said he favors a method of
teaching stressing "a broad view of
medicine so that their (students')
view won't be too narrow too soon."
In all areas related to the medical
school, Crowley added, "quality
should be the litmus against which we
measure progress."

United States. "The current trend
seems to be that there are more doc
tors than we need, " Crowley said.
In the area of student-faculty rela
tions, Crowley reiterated some of Uni
versity President Donald Kennedy's
inaugural remarks and urged the med
ical school faculty to rebuild sound
student-faculty relations.
Crowley also expressed an "antipa
thy to unnecessary competition" in
medical and premedical students'
lives. He cited one study which re
ported 80 percent of the students in a
certain medical school had admitted
to cheating as undergraduates, with 50
percent admitting to have cheated in


Lawrence Crowley
medical school as well. "I'm certainly
for competition, but this is a problem
which is well-documented around the
country. - ' Crowley said. He did not
specify how faculty here should deal
with the problem.
With regard to grading, Crowley
said he favors "achievement-oriented
evaluations," stating that subjective
grading and the bell-shaped curve
"don't belong at Stanford."
"If 80 percent of the students per
form at a superior level, there is noth
ing wrong with saying that," Crowley
added.
He also said he favors a method of
teaching stressing "a broad view of
medicine so that their (students')
view won't be too narrow too soon."
In all areas related to the medical
school, Crowley added, "quality
should be the litmus against which we
measure progress."
The Stanford Medical Center will
"concentrate on quality" as an essen
tial complement to progress as it
moves into the 1980s. Vice President
for Medical Affairs Lawrence
Crowley told a gathering of the medi
cal school's faculty yesterday.
Crowley said the facility's "agenda
for the 80s' will include a shift away
from growth toward an attempt to
achieve a proper balance among the
"interdependent trinity:" the medical
school, clinic and hospital.
However, renovations, to be com
pleted in five or six years, will in
crease the medical center's facility
space by 40 percent, he said.The $100
million hospital expansion plan has
been approved by the University's
Board of Trustees, Crowley told the
faculty, and is proceeding on a "roll
forward basis."
Crowley also highlighted the ap
pointment of a new dean for the medi
cal school and the need to improve stu
dent-faculty relations as important
tasks ahead. Crowley's half-hour ad
dress to what he said was the "first
full faculty meeting in a decade"'
noted that the medical center ex
perienced its most marked growth fol
lowing its move to the campus in 1959,
attaining an "enviable status" in the
19605.
"In the '70s, however, there was a
pause in forward motion," Crowley
said, because of a decline in funding

resources. The decline, caused by ex
ternal forces like inflation, energy
costs and a nationwide fall-off in prod
uctivity. resulted in a substantial in
crease in the cost of providing medical
care.
Crowley said opportunities for addi
tional funding exist now in private in
dustry and will be actively pursued.
However, he warned that the Med
Center must keep in mind the fact
that, ' industry's goals are not neces
sarily identical with the Univer
sity's."
Crowley, who has been serving as
acting dean of the medical school
since being appointed vice president
of medical affairs for the University,
said he hopes the search committee
will recommend a new. permanent
dean by the end of this year.
Addressing the issue of faculty
salaries at the medical school.
Crowley reported that the facility
"must remain competitive with other
institutions in terms of salary." and
said the medical center's adminis
tration will be studying the salary
question in the near future.
Before Crowley spoke. l)r John
Collins, chairman of the Faculty Prac
tice Plan, noted that current staff
salaries at the medical school are just
at the level of the national average.
"Without putting too much pressure

on Larrv (Crowley)." Collins said,
"we intend to push in the direction of
raising salaries."
Addressing a sort of negative
growth factor associated with the Uni
versity. Crowley pointed out a "popu
lation shift" which will produce fewer
potential medical students in the next
two decades. "Education is no longer
a growth industry." he said, adding,
however, that the medical schools' ad
missions applicants have remained
high and probably will in the future.
In fact. Crowley said, a study spon
sored by the now-defunct Department
of Health. Education and Welfare
stated that by the year 1990, there will
be 70.000 too many physicians in the
United States. "The current trend
seems to be that there are more doc
tors than we need, " Crowley said.
