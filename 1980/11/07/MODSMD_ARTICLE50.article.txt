2001: .4 Space Odyuey ****
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Evolution.
Stanley Kubrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelations finds
mankind ready to make a giant
leap into the unknown. What we're
leaping from is, in Kubrick's vi
sion, particularly bleak. His char
acters are engulfed in technology
that makes life comfortable and
boring. Surrounded by the splen
dours of space, they seem drained
and vacant: they've carried the
work ethic out between the
planets. Here, space must be a
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show tonight

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton s mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.
— Ron Lillejord
Coal Miner's Daughter
Sunday, Mem Aud
A pretty terrific
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eye for telling de
tail. Country star Loretta Lynn's
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as if the two had been best
friends; her performance sug
gests shared secrets and late-night
soul searching. Tommy Lee Jones
and Beverly (as Patsy
Cline) turn in superb supporting
perfomances.

Bijou, l'alo Alto
The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half-aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
into either world. Schepisi uses a
visual shorthand that is the
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose and he is able to con
vey the emotional tone of a scene
just bv the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly
sustained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy Lew
is. Angela Punch and Freddy Rey
nolds could scarcely be better.
This is a film of Sophoclean power
— a masterpiece.
- Steve Vineberg
Hopscotch
Old Mill. Mountain View
Walter Matthau plays Miles
Kendig, a CI A agent relegated to a
desk job. Matthau, with his lanky
teddy-bear looks and that cautious
mincing walk, is a peculiar choice
lor the role of a secret agent, but
he can get awav with it because we
know how clever (and sexy) he re
ally is.
Director Ronald Neame. an
Fnglishman, is a cold fish, but he
is competent and he keeps the pic
ture moving fairly quickly.
Hopscotch resembles some of the
British comedies of the '50s that
featured Alec Guinness and
Alistair Sim and were spun on neat
plot devices. It's not a great mov
ie. but one that will be remem
bered with pleasure.

three—most of them involving
singing, dancing, and suchlike
are choice. But to get those few
nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a
Teendged Chorus Line. All the fa
miliar faces are here , an ignorant
but-talented ghetto kid, a girl who
brings along a Jewish mother out
of a 40s comic strip, and a lonely

famous actress. All work to prove
that it takes an incredible amount
of talent to keep churning out
melodrama.

A great musical fantasy that s

Milos Forman (One Flew Over the

captures the timeless, rebellious,
rock'n'roll spirit of the '60s and
makes it live again. It's a fantasy
vision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might just be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made.

The Elephant Man ****
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick,
"The Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battlingour fear of the
unknown.
— Tom Taylor

Wiae Blood
New Varsity, Palo Alto
John Huston directed this adap
tation of Flannery O'Connor's first
novel. The movie's strongest point
is that it remains largely faithful
to the spirit of O'Connor's fiction.
What we see is unremittingly fan
tastic, a nightmare world peopled
with moral grotesques — yet
somewhere, up on the screen, we
see ourselves, too.
Brad Dourif gives a remarkable
performance as Hazel Motes, just
out of the army and determined to
start his own religion — The
Church of God Without Jesus
Christ. His rise and fall are truly
compelling.

The Electric Horseman
Fox. Redwood City
Sydney Pollack directed this
populist ode with an eye toward
pleasing the masses. Rodeo star
cereal spokesman Robert Redford
steals a $12 million racehorse in
order to set it free; jaded reporter
Jane Fonda strikes out after the
story and ends up falling in love in
stead. Willie Nelson's music com
pletes the package.
'Hie film's sweetness of tone al
lows it to rise above being merely
slickly inoffensive. It's evident
that the director and the per
formers are genuinely fond of
these characters, and some of that
warmth radiates from the screen.
For a package deal, that's not a
bad trick at all.

The Kids Are Alright ***
Old Mill. Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live
Rock" by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
came first: our generation or The
Who?

A Clockwork Orange ★★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred the
Anthony Burgess novel to the
screen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. The style of filmmaking
is as aggressive as the film's char
acters: Kubrick assaults us with
harsh lighting and jagged editing
strategies designed to disorient
the viewer.
A Clockwork Orange is a moral
ity play set in the near future,
when battlelines have been drawn
between the individual and the so
ciety that must protect that indi
vidual. Malcom MacDowell stars
as a man who enjoys Beethoven
and committing violent acts.

Hair ****

A great musical fantasy that s

Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest) works in a reck

captures the timeless, rebellious,
rock'n'roll spirit of the '60s and
makes it live again. It's a fantasy
vision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might just be
the truest picture of the '60s ever
made.

The Elephant Man ****
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major

"The Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de

John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite

a moving tale of human love and
compassion battlingour fear of the

John Huston directed this adap

successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and

over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know

A Clockwork Orange ★★★★

Stanley Kubrick transferred the

is as aggressive as the film's char

harsh lighting and jagged editing
strategies designed to disorient
the viewer.
A Clockwork Orange is a moral

An evolutionary primer, or:

Stanley Kubrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelations finds
mankind ready to make a giant
leap into the unknown. What we're
leaping from is, in Kubrick's vi

acters are engulfed in technology
that makes life comfortable and
boring. Surrounded by the splen

Director Robert Redford's

his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the

this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled

The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half-aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
into either world. Schepisi uses a
visual shorthand that is the
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose and he is able to con

just bv the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly

A Clockwork Orange ★★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
Stanley Kubrick transferred the
Anthony Burgess novel to the
screen by making a gruelingly vis
ual film. The style of filmmaking
is as aggressive as the film's char
acters: Kubrick assaults us with
harsh lighting and jagged editing
strategies designed to disorient
the viewer.
A Clockwork Orange is a moral
ity play set in the near future,
when battlelines have been drawn
between the individual and the so
ciety that must protect that indi
vidual. Malcom MacDowell stars
as a man who enjoys Beethoven
and committing violent acts.

An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying

Stanley Kubrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelations finds
mankind ready to make a giant
leap into the unknown. What we're
leaping from is, in Kubrick's vi
sion, particularly bleak. His char
acters are engulfed in technology
that makes life comfortable and
boring. Surrounded by the splen

work ethic out between the

Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler

The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half-aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
into either world. Schepisi uses a
visual shorthand that is the
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose and he is able to con
vey the emotional tone of a scene
just bv the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly
sustained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy Lew

his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton s mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

Coal Miner's Daughter
Sunday, Mem Aud
A pretty terrific
that way by some great per
formances and by director
Michael Apted's eye for telling de
tail. Country star Loretta Lynn's
rags-to-riches story is brought to
the screen with warmth and fine
humor. Even when, two-thirds of
the way through, the inevitable
heartbreak comes, the movie
glides through showbiz cliche and
comes out with its good nature in
tact.
Sissy Spacek portrays the
singer as if the two had been best
friends; her performance sug
gests shared secrets and late-night
soul searching. Tommy Lee Jones
and Beverly (as Patsy
Cline) turn in superb supporting
perfomances.

Bijou, l'alo Alto
The Australian director, Fred
Schepisi. has adapted a fine 1972
novel by Thomas Keneally about a
young half-white, half-aborigine
whose tragedy is his inability to fit
into either world. Schepisi uses a
visual shorthand that is the
equivalent of Keneally's dense yet
terse prose and he is able to con
vey the emotional tone of a scene
just bv the grouping of actors. The
film contains a bold, brilliantly
sustained operatic climax that is
certain to disturb many viewers.
The performances of Tommy Lew
is. Angela Punch and Freddy Rey
nolds could scarcely be better.
This is a film of Sophoclean power
— a masterpiece.

Hopscotch
Old Mill. Mountain View
Walter Matthau plays Miles
Kendig, a CI A agent relegated to a
desk job. Matthau, with his lanky
teddy-bear looks and that cautious
mincing walk, is a peculiar choice
lor the role of a secret agent, but
he can get awav with it because we
know how clever (and sexy) he re
ally is.
Director Ronald Neame. an
Fnglishman, is a cold fish, but he
is competent and he keeps the pic
ture moving fairly quickly.
Hopscotch resembles some of the
British comedies of the '50s that
featured Alec Guinness and
Alistair Sim and were spun on neat
plot devices. It's not a great mov
ie. but one that will be remem
bered with pleasure.

nice moments, you have to sit
through two hours of I was a

The Elephant Man ****
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now

"The Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de

John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite

a moving tale of human love and

compilation of concert footage and

over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest

harsh lighting and jagged editing

the viewer.
A Clockwork Orange is a moral

Stanley Kubrick's epic rewrite
of the Book of Revelations finds
mankind ready to make a giant
