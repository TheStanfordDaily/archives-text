Heavy fighting imperils Abadan
Beirut, Lebanon — Iraq pounded Iran's southwestern
stronghold of Abadan with mortars and artillery yester
day.the 46th day of the Persian Gulf war. and Iran claimed
counter-attacks against Iraqi-held Iranian territory there
and farther north along the 300-mile front.
Iran claimed its "soldiers of Islam" fought a fierce bat
tle along the Abadan-Mashahr Road about two miles east
of Abadan. and that its warplanes destroyed Iraqi posi
tions along the Bahmanshir River.
Iran also claimed its jets struck inside Iraq, hitting mili
tary equipment and installations at Sulavmaniyah, 145
miles north of Baghdad. Tehran Radio claimed Iranian
bombing runs on other Iraqi garrisons.
Iraq said an Iranian Phantom was shot down during
raids.
The Iranians held on to Abadan on the Shatt al-Arab wa
terway. but the Iraqis claimed their troops ringing Abadan
could take it at will. iNeither side reported any major
change of position.
Abadan is Iran's last stronghold on the disputed Shatt al-
Arab estuary and before the war provided two-thirds of its
petroleum needs. Its capture would give Iraq complete
control of the Shatt al-Arab. part of the pre-war border be
tween the two nations and Iraq's only waterway to the
gulf.
Tehran Radio reported heavy fighting where eastern
Abadan is bordered by the Bahmanshir. and admitted that
Iraqis had penetrated Abadan's eastern districts of
Zolfaqar and Fayvaziveh.

Hatfield to offer elections bill
Salem, Ore. — U.S. Sen Mark Hatfield i R-Ore.). will in
troduce a bill to forbid election officials from revealing re
sults until all polls in the United States are closed. Oregon
Secretary of State Norma Paulus said yesterday.
Paulus said Hatfield agreed to introduce the measure
that will be drafted by her office.
She said she favors that approach in response to com
plaints from people who believe President Jimmy
Carter's early concession speech caused many voters to
stay away from the polls on the West Coast.
Paulus said she disagrees with California Secretary of
State March Fong Eu. who says she may seek federal leg
islation to require all polls to close simultaneously.
Paulus acknowledged that eastern states' election of
ficials will likely protest attempts to force them to
withhold results for several hours after their polls close.
Gary Esgate. chief aide to state Senate Majority Leader
Fred Heard, i D-Klamath Falls), said Heard got numerous
calls after the election from people upset with Carter's
speech, which came nearly two hours before polls closed in
Oregon. Washington and California.
Anti-Reagan protest broken up
Berkeley — In a campus scene reminiscent of the 19605,
police led and dragged dissident students and others out of
the University of California administration building to
break up a sit-in sparked by Ronald Reagan's election.
Campus police arrested 35 students and 17 nonstudents

Wednesday night following the five-hour protest on the
Berkeley campus. No injuries were reported.
All 52 were charged with misdemeanor trespassing and,
in addition. 10 were charged with resisting arrest.
Although the demonstration had Reagan's presidential
election as a "catalyst," one protestor said, it later drifted
into a general protest centering on campus causes of long
standing.
The noisy occupation of the stairwell between the first
and second floors of California Hall started at about 2 p.m.
with 150 students and nonstudents. Police sealed off the
building. Two men were arrested then for allegedly tangl
ing with police.
As the protesters walked into the building, most of the
UC administrators walked out, but some minor damage
was reportedly done to the walls near Chancellor Michael
Hevman's office.
Soviets foresee tense relations
Moscow — New Soviet Premier Nikolai Tikhonov as
sailed the United States in his first major speech as prime
minister yesterday, clearly implying the Kremlin fore
sees tense relations with Ronald Reagan's administration
next year.
"American imperialism and its accomplices,"
Tikhonov declared , "have taken the path of undermining
detente, aggravating international tension, escalating the
arms race, of adventurist actions (around) the world, a
course of militant anti-Sovietism."
Although the Soviets want detente, Tikhonov asserted,
"we of course cannot but draw the proper conclusions for
ourselves from the intensification of trends in U.S. foreign
policy."
Meanwhile. Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev sent a
congratulatory telegram to President-elect Reagan, it
was disclosed yesterday, but the tone was far cooler than a
similar telegram sent to Carter four years ago.
Brezhnev expressed "the hope that your activity in this
high post will help improve relations between our coun
tries for the sake of the Soviet and American peoples and
the consolidation of peace."
Libyians step up war in Chad
Libya's Moammar Khadafy, suddenly escalating a for
gotten little African war, has dispatched columns of rein
forcements and Soviet-built bombers to strengthen his
troops fighting on one side of a bloody struggle for power in
neighboring Chad, it was reported yesterday.
The influx of additional Libyan troops and bombing runs
by Libyan warplanes brought Khadafy's commitment in
the long Chadian conflict to a new high and gave at least
temporary advantage to the forces of President Goukouni
Oueddei, son of a northern Moslem religious ruler with
sympathy for the pan-Islamic Khadafy government.
Khadafy has for years offered support to one Chadian
guerrilla group or another, sometimes two opposing bands
at the same time, in an effort to get a government sympa
thetic to his brand of Islamic nationalism.
Oueddei. at a news conference on Libyan soil broadcast
t y Libyan radio, hinted yesterday that the recent Libyan
buildup is aimed at permitting him to gain a decisive vic
tory over his opponents after months of indecisive blood
letting.
Thurmond eyes judiciary post
Washington — Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), pros
pective new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
pledged yesterday to seek a national death penalty law
next year and elimination of what he called unnecessary

environmental and other federal regulations.
Thurmond also told a news conference that blacks and
other minority groups have nothing to fear from a con
servative regime in 1981 when Republicans take command
of the Senate.
Blacks, he said, "have one of the best friends they could
have in me. 1 believe in equality for all. I've always tried to
treat them fairly and squarely."
Thurmond. 77, once staunchly opposed civil rights legis
lation and was prominent among the Southern Democrats
who. called Dixiecrats, opposed the civil rights platform
of the regular Democratic Party in 1948.
Thurmond switched his party affiliation to Republican
in September 1964 and campaigned for GOP presidential
nominee Barry Goldwater against President Lyndon John
son, who had pushed the Civil Rights Act through Congress
a couple of months earlier.
Today, Thurmond says civil rights advocates mis
construed his old Dixiecrat affiliation. The issue was "fed
eral power vs. state power" and not racial tolerance, he
said yesterday.
Thurmond's views assumed a new importance when Re
publicans seized control of the Senate in Tuesday's elec
tions. with the GOP taking over chairmanships of Senate
committees.
School censors Cal Poly paper
San Luis Obispo — About 7000 copies of the student
newspaper at California Polytechnic State University
were destroyed by university officials because the paper
carried an unsigned endorsement of President Carter, the
officials said.
Officials of the school's journalism department said the
paper violated a state administrative code that prohibits
use of state funds for political purposes. The paper re
ceives some of its financial support from the university.
"My gut level reaction is sorrow in having to do some
thing like that," said Randall Murray, acting head of the
journalism department. "But we honestly felt that the
best decision was to kill it, as we read the law."
Student editors said they decided not to challenge the
university's destruction of all copies of the election day is
sue, but said they were "outraged" by the decision.
"We were very angry at the law because we believe it's
censorship against the press," said Managing Editor Tom
Johnson.
A week ago. the paper was allowed to print its recom
mendations on state ballot propositions, and it does en
dorse candidates for student offices.
