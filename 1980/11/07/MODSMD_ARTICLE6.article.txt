# Local communists aim for support
## Militants advocate governmental overthrow 
### Will McClatchy 
Being a highly competitive, well-established
and expensive private institution, Stanford Uni
versity has no place for Marxist radicals, right?
Wrong, say members of The Friends of the
Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade. They
say the group is very active, and is probably the
most militant political organization on campus.
An offshoot of an international Marxist-
Leninist party, the FRCYB advocates the over
throw of the U.S. government and, if necessary,
the use of force to do so.
For the moment, however, violence is not part
of the program, say FRCYB members. Instead,
the group is directing its energy towards creating
public support. The group organizes rallies,
speeches by outside authorities and weekly in
formal discussion groups. Its members often sell
their newspaper. The Revolutionary Worker,

What separates the FRCYB from other leftist
groups, according to members, is its "ag
gressive" style. "We are a militant group." said
senior Dante Ruiz, adding that the general condi
tion of society warrants strong tactics.
Some students object to the FRCYB's ag
gressiveness. Graduate student Amy Rocha de-

scribed FRCYB members as "very pushy, often
obnoxious." Another student who wished to re
main anonymous said, "I like their politics but
not their style. I don't agree with their concept of
a vanguard party leading us to a new society."
Sohomore Chris Cale, a FRCYB member, said
students often insult him. But what really both
ers him, he added, is when students ignore him.
Ruiz agreed, saying. "By confronting the is
sues with us. people can come to understand whai
we stand for. We are not pro-Soviet but interna
tionalist."
But several students who said they were famil
iar with the group's political platform were
critical of the group's ideas. "They don't offer a
viable solution," said Rocha. Mike Shuman
added that "they are socially conservative even
though they have radical political beliefs."
FRCYB members said they understand that
they must seem out of place here. Ruiz said,
"From a bourgeois point of view, my presence
here would be contradictory.
"I don't think so," Ruiz said. "I'm a student
revolutionary and my presence here is neces
sary." Cale pointed out that if the draft begins,
many revolutionaries will enter the army to

spread their political beliefs.
Both Cale and Ruiz said they became Com
munists after they came to Stanford. In fact, both
had previously voted Republican. Said Cale, "I
was a Reagan man before I came to Stanford "
Although the FRCYB is highly critical of socie
ty in general, members said the University treats
them fairly. The University provides them with
office space in the Old Press Building and gives
them occasional grants to sponsor lectures
According to Patricia Brandt of the Office of
Student Activities, the group adheres to the Uni
versity's rules for student organizations. The
trustees, she said, specify that no student group
can be discriminated against because of political
affiliation.
FRCYB members did, however, have critical
words for the Daily. Calling the Daily "a propa
ganda organ," Cale said the wire service reports
that the Daily uses are "biased" and that the Dai
ly usually covers only moderate political groups
on campus.
Although he did not believe the Daily is inten
tionally malicious, the effect, said Cale, is still
the same. Ruiz added. "They (the Daily staff)
should be consciously aware that they should cov
er all sides of the issue."
