## Foreign reaction mixed to Reagan's election Mideast reacts with uncertainty 
### Washington Post 
_ Jerusalem — The election of
Ronald Reagan could put the
Camp David peace process into
a state of suspended animation
for as long as a year, and even
then alter its direction signifi
cantly. informed Israeli sources
said Wednesday.
► It appeared likely that the
trilateral U.S.-lsraeii-Egyptian
summit conference tentatively
planned for later this year wiil
be delayed until after Reagan is
inaugurated Jan. 20. and that
the moribund West Bank-Gaza
autonomy negotiations will not
find their way onto the new pres
ident's agenda until late spring,
observers here noted.
Moreover, it will take addi
tional time for the new Re
publican administration to fully
develop its Middle East oolicy
and put together a negotiating
team if the Camp David path is
to be followed, meaning the
process would begin to converge
with Israel's national elections
and become subject to further
delay. Israeli sources said.
President Anwar Sadat, un
derlined that the Camp David
accords were not signed in the
name of President Jimmy
Carter, but in the name of the
United States and said his offer
for a three-way summit still
stands. The Egyptian president,
in a speech in Cairo relayed by
wire services, congratulated
Reagan for "winning the con
fidence of his people'' and at the
same time had lavish praise for
Carter's efforts on behalf of
Egypt and peace in the Middle
East.
Reaction to Reagan's victory
was muted elsewhere in the
Arab world, but observers there
immediately pointed to the vic
tor's strong expressions of sup
port for Israel during the cam
paign and before. Reflecting
these fears, a spokesman for
Yasser Arafat, head of the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion. called the outcome a vic
tory for Israel, recalling that
Reagan has termed the PLO a

"band of thugs."
In Israel, officials also cen
tered on the results of con
gressional races, highlighting
traditional Israeli concern for
friends in the House and Senate
In the presidential contest,
Reagan's election also in
creased expectations among
politicians of a significant shift
in the focus of the peace process
that Carter began in September
1978 at Camp David.
The most talked-about possi
bility is that Reagan, at the urg
ing of former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger and other for
mal or informal advisers who
are not enamoured with the
Camp David theme, would turn
toward the Jordanian option, in
which the United States would
attempt to bring Jordan's King
Hussein into discussions with Is
rael for a negotiated return of
the occupied West Bank
