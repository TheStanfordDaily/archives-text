# Japan expects no policy change

### Washington Post 
Tokyo — Japanese govern
ment officials expressed sur
prise but no dismay Wednesday
at Ronald Reagan's big victory
and publicly doubted that a
change of administrations
would seriously affect relations
with the United States.
There was. however, an un
dercurrent of apprehension that
a Reagan administration would
press Japan harder than Presi
dent Jimmy Carter did to in
crease its defense spending to
become a stronger Pacific mili
tary force.
Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki
told the Japanese press he was
considerably surprised by the
size of Reagan's victory
margin, attributing it to the
U.S. economic problems and the
hostage issue.
Suzuki, in a message to Re
agan. said. "1 feel confident that
you will demonstrate outstand
ing leadership, courage and de
termination in guiding your

country, the leader of the free
world, in today's difficult in
ternational environment. Both
the United States and Japan
have vital responsibility of con
tributing to peace and prosper
ity of the international com
munity."
Foreign Minister Masavoshi
Ito told a parliamentary com
mittee this afternoon he does
not expect greater American
pressure for a Japanese defense
buildup. He referred obliquely
to a conversation he had here
last August with George Bush,
the vice president-elect. He
quoted Bush as having said that
a new Republican adminis
tration would deal with the Sovi
et Union on the basis of "peace
by force."
Reagan's generally hawkish
attitudes on defense and in
ternational security have led
some policy-makers, however,
to suspect Reagan will push for
a faster buildup of Japanese de
fensive forces to counter the

growing Soviet air and naval
power in the Ear East.
The Japanese business com
munity. which is usually satis
fied to see a business-oriented
Republican administration
come to power in the United
States, appeared to approve of
Reagan's victory.
Business sources expressed
confidence that the Reagan ad
ministration would strongly
support a policy of free trade
and said they saw no signs he
would turn toward a protec
tionist policy that might limit
Japanese exports to the United
States.
