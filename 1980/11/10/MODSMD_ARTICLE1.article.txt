# Trojans trounce Cards on home turf 34-9 as USC thoroughly dominates Stanford
## 
### Chris Haft 
Were it an election, it would have
been termed a landslide. Had it been a
boxing match, the end would have
been a knockout.
Instead, it was a USC football game,
and as is usually the case in such af
fairs, it featured near-thorough Tro
jan domination from start to finish,
from goal line to goal line. USC de
feated Stanford 34-9 Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, continually making its
superiority over the Cardinals evi
dent.
The Trojans' superiority was evi
dent on their first three possessions,
when they marched almost the entire
length of the field each time for touch
downs. Not until the second quarter
did they have to'face a third-down situ
ation. Not until the second half did
they deign to punt.
It was evident from the statistics,
which reflected just how badly Stan
ford needs a balanced offensive attack
to survive. USC buried the Cards' col
lective nose in the turf, holding them
to minus 13 yards rushing.

It was evident from the per
formances of starters like Marcus Al
len and Kevin Williams, and even
from second- and third-stringers like
James Hunter (who caught a 19-yard
pass on USC's second scoring drive)
and Anthony Gibson (who imitated Al
len nicely on one second-quarter play,
gaining 21 yards). And when reserve
fullback Bob McClanahan touched the
ball for the first time, all he did was
run 21 yards for a touchdown
USC's failures on four conversion
attempts only lent a touch of humor
ous irony to its controlled, efficient
play-
Stanford's only advantage came
during the pre-game coin flip, when
the presence of the entire team at mid
field outnumbered the three Trojan
captains
Otherwise, the action unfolded the
other way around — as if USC were
playing with 40 or 50 more men on the
field than Stanford. Card head coach
Paul Wiggin, whose team can stop
thinking about the Rose Bowl, realized
even beforehand that the Trojans' ex
cellence would be difficult to over

come.
"I think coming into this game we
had to have our very best day. Execu
tion-wise. we knew we couldn't make
many mistakes." Wiggin said. "I
think we met USC at their best."
"Our team is coming around a little
bit.' Trojan head coach .John Rob
inson deadpanned "Another month
and we 11 have it right."
Actually, the Trojans got it right
most of the time Saturday To limit
Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference
leading offense to 247 total yards, Rob
inson said that USC's top defensive
priority was to prevent quarterback
John El way from throwing downfield
on the run. thus denying the
sophomore one ot his favorite ploys
"Our whole process was to keep him
(Elway) contained." Robinson re
vealed. "I've never seen a more dan
gerous player ... we wanted to con
tain him and make him throw at a nor
mal rhythm."
Occasionally Elway couldn t throw
at all. for USC defenders sacked him
eight times. "Is this the sorest I ve
ever been after a game'.' Right now.

veah.'' he said Stanford scored its
only touchdown, significantly enough,
when Klwav was able to elude USC's
charging rush
Elway's explosiveness was further
defused by injuries to his most gifted
offensive mates — Damn Nelson and
Ken Margerum
Nelson had never enjoyed much suc
cess against the Trojans — only 49
rushing yards gained in two games —
and early in the first quarter he en
dured more bad luck, spraining his
right ankle He left the game at half
time after gaining just 21 yards in six
carries.
There's no question that Darrin's
absence affected our offense." Wiggin
stated
Nelson reacted somewhat bitterly
to his injury, implying that not every
Trojan tackle was clean
"All I know is that every time 1 hit
the ground, somebody was twisting
my ankle . . . tor) diving across it.
People do this all the time, but they
just got to me."

Wimmer (58, left) and Craig Zellmer (52, right) in goal-line action dur
ing the Trojans' 34-9 rout of the Cardinals Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
Margerum's ill fortune oc
curred almost immediately.
While catching an Elway pass
over the middle for 16 yards on
the first play from scrimmage,
the Card flanker suffered a
painful hip pointer that pre
vented him from jumping off his
right leg
"I was probably at 50 percent
(effectiveness) after that first
play." lamented Margerum.
who gamely continued to play,
with brief rests.
The Trojans, though, almost
never rested, displaying both
talent and wisdom.
"They're too quick." Nelson
said. "I'm trying to fight by one
guv. and there's three other
guys there." #
"We played three or four
freshmen sometimes, and
Duker Dapper had to play nose
guard for the first time in six or
seven weeks. They picked on the
key areas," tackle Doug Rogers
said.
For all USC's dominance, the
Cards maintained hopes for vic
tory until the third quarter,
when Trojan defensive back
Ronnie Lott "stole' the ball
from halfback Vincent White
and ran 45 yards for a touch
down, increasing USC's lead to
24-9 with 8:50 left in the period.
Because the ball went from
White's grasp to Lott's — it nev
er hit the ground — the play was
scored as an interception re
turn, though it was the
equivalent of a fumble.
"I came up on Vincent White
and I just wanted to make the
tackle." Lott recalled. "I know
he's got great moves — I just
wanted to catch him. I caught
him. he tried to struggle away
from me. and he wasn't holding
the ball that well."
Every Stanford player asked
referred to Lott's feat as the
play that settled matters.
"Right then. I said, 'There's no
way we're gonna beat them, the
way we're playing.'" Rogers
admitted.
Many of the 84,892 spectators
probably reached the same con
clusion after USC's first-half
touchdown drives of 95. 96 and 80
yards. Allen, who rushed for 195
yards and two TDs on 34 carries,
rarely absorbed contact until

having crossed two or three
yards past the scrimmage line.
Whenever Allen wasn't running
unimpeded, tight end Hoby
Brenner was making one
handed catches and Williams
was beating Stanford's secon
dary for 20-to-30 yard recep
tions.
The Cards had a chance to
steal some of USC's thunder
early in the second quarter. Af
ter Dave Morze and Kevin Mac-
Mil lan stopped Allen for no gain
at Stanford's 14-yard line, the
Trojans faced a fourth-and-two
situation
USC elected to try for the first
down and. with everybody in the
stadium expecting a running
play, quarterback Gordon
Adams faked to Allen and tossed
the ball down the sideline to
tight end Vic Rakhshani for an
11-yard gain Allen scored two
plays afterward for a 12-0 USC
lead.
"We were thinking run — eve
ry time Rakhshani is in the
game it's 90 percent run," Rog
ers said. "It was kind of weird
that they did pass the ball."
Stanford responded with its
only touchdown, a 46-yard bomb
that actually traveled more
than 60 yards from Margerum to
Elway. who experienced more
adventure on that play than
Robinson Crusoe ever did.
Back to pass on first-and-10,
Elway scrambled to his left and
barely escaped the unfriendly
clutches of linemen Dennis Ed
wards and George Achica.
Elway then scurried to his right,
and then back to his own 30. still
chased by Edwards. Achica and
also Byron Darby. Upon reach
ing his own 40, Elway spotted
Margerum all alone in the end
zone and hurled him the ball.
The play cut the Trojans' lead
in half, to 12-6. It did nothing,
however, to their strength.
NOTES: Besides
Margerum's and Nelson's in
juries, Stanford tight end Chris
Dressel also suffered a con
cussion and guard Mike Neill
twisted his knee. Nelson, in
cidentally, is expected to play
against California in two
weeks . . . The Cards' -13 yards
rushing was their lowest total
since 1972, when they had -16
against — who else? — USC.
