# Trojans trounce Cards on home turf 34-9 as USC thoroughly dominates Stanford
## 
### Chris Haft 
Were it an election, it would have
been termed a landslide. Had it been a
boxing match, the end would have
been a knockout.
Instead, it was a USC football game,
and as is usually the case in such af
fairs, it featured near-thorough Tro
jan domination from start to finish,
from goal line to goal line. USC de
feated Stanford 34-9 Saturday at Stan
ford Stadium, continually making its
superiority over the Cardinals evi
dent.
The Trojans' superiority was evi
dent on their first three possessions,
when they marched almost the entire
length of the field each time for touch
downs. Not until the second quarter
did they have to'face a third-down situ
ation. Not until the second half did
they deign to punt.
It was evident from the statistics,
which reflected just how badly Stan
ford needs a balanced offensive attack
to survive. USC buried the Cards' col
lective nose in the turf, holding them
to minus 13 yards rushing.

It was evident from the per
formances of starters like Marcus Al
len and Kevin Williams, and even
from second- and third-stringers like
James Hunter (who caught a 19-yard
pass on USC's second scoring drive)
and Anthony Gibson (who imitated Al
len nicely on one second-quarter play,
gaining 21 yards). And when reserve
fullback Bob McClanahan touched the
ball for the first time, all he did was
run 21 yards for a touchdown
USC's failures on four conversion
attempts only lent a touch of humor
ous irony to its controlled, efficient
play-
Stanford's only advantage came
during the pre-game coin flip, when
the presence of the entire team at mid
field outnumbered the three Trojan
captains
Otherwise, the action unfolded the
other way around — as if USC were
playing with 40 or 50 more men on the
field than Stanford. Card head coach
Paul Wiggin, whose team can stop
thinking about the Rose Bowl, realized
even beforehand that the Trojans' ex
cellence would be difficult to over

come.
"I think coming into this game we
had to have our very best day. Execu
tion-wise. we knew we couldn't make
many mistakes." Wiggin said. "I
think we met USC at their best."
"Our team is coming around a little
bit.' Trojan head coach .John Rob
inson deadpanned "Another month
and we 11 have it right."
Actually, the Trojans got it right
most of the time Saturday To limit
Stanford's Pacific-10 Conference
leading offense to 247 total yards, Rob
inson said that USC's top defensive
priority was to prevent quarterback
John El way from throwing downfield
on the run. thus denying the
sophomore one ot his favorite ploys
"Our whole process was to keep him
(Elway) contained." Robinson re
vealed. "I've never seen a more dan
gerous player ... we wanted to con
tain him and make him throw at a nor
mal rhythm."
Occasionally Elway couldn t throw
at all. for USC defenders sacked him
eight times. "Is this the sorest I ve
ever been after a game'.' Right now.

veah.'' he said Stanford scored its
only touchdown, significantly enough,
when Klwav was able to elude USC's
charging rush
Elway's explosiveness was further
defused by injuries to his most gifted
offensive mates — Damn Nelson and
Ken Margerum
Nelson had never enjoyed much suc
cess against the Trojans — only 49
rushing yards gained in two games —
and early in the first quarter he en
dured more bad luck, spraining his
right ankle He left the game at half
time after gaining just 21 yards in six
carries.
There's no question that Darrin's
absence affected our offense." Wiggin
stated
Nelson reacted somewhat bitterly
to his injury, implying that not every
Trojan tackle was clean
"All I know is that every time 1 hit
the ground, somebody was twisting
my ankle . . . tor) diving across it.
People do this all the time, but they
just got to me."
