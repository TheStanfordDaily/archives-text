# TMI stores own N-waste

Middletown, Pa. (AP) â€” In the wake of a
Washington state vote that will close off a nu
clear dump site to out-of-state wastes, officials
at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant
have begun making plans to store the damaged
plant's wastes on the island itself
"We've got a lot of acres on the island, so we
could keep storing the waste material here for
up to. say, 15 years." said Doug Bedell, a
spokesman for Metropolitan Edison, the plant
operator.
"But it would involve considerable costs,"
Bedell said "Given the current financial con
dition of the company, it's not the sort of ex
pense that could be handled well."
Met Ed has dug 120 concrete crypts on Three
Mile Island to temporarily house radioactive
wastes, officials said

Tractor-trailers have been hauling tightly
packaged radioactive debris about three times
a month cross-country from TMI to the Han
lord (Wash.) Federal Reservation, the only
waste disposal site in the nation that will ac
cept such material for burial.
Last week. Washington voters overwhelm
ingly approved a ballot initiative to bar out-of
state non-medical waste shipments to Han
ford, beginning next July.
The wastes being shipped from TMI include
work clothes and tools contaminated by radio
activity, and dried resin beads from the filtra
tion system used to decontaminate radioactive
waste water from the plant.
The Hanford Reservation has been a site for
plutonium production and nuclear weapons ex
perimentation since World War 11.
