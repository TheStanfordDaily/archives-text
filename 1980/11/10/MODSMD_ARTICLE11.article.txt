Washington — Ronald Reagan's campaign
pledge to decontrol natural gas prices faces a long
and difficult battle in Congress, but on the day he
takes office, Reagan will be able to take a big step
toward that goal simply by filling the available
seats on the agency that regulates the gas in
dustry. The terms of two of the five members
have expired, and Charles Curtis, who chairs the
commission, is widely believed to be looking for
another job.
Though scarcely a glamour agency, the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission has enormous
discretion over natural gas prices, production in
centives and markets, discretion that could be
used to achieve some of the effects of decontrol
long before price controls are scheduled to come
off in 1985.
"Some decisions the commission can make in
volve millions of dollars and in some cases billions
of dollars to the industry," one industry lawyer
said.
The actual schedule for decontrol of natural gas
prices was set out by the Natural Gas Policy Act
of 1978. and changing it would require action by
Congress.
Free market
By carefully filling the empty slots with com
missioners intent on promoting natural gas, Re
agan will be able to tailor the FERC to support his
energy policy, which puts greater emphasis on
production and market forces than the policy de
veloped under the Carter administration.
Here are some of the decisions that sources say
the industry might expect from a Reagan majori
ty on the commission:
— Looser rules for what costs can be excluded
from the ceiling prices set by the Natural Gas Pol-

icy Act. This issue has been one of the hottest con
troversies between the commission and the pro
ducers. A pending commission rule would apply a
strict limit on the negotiation of costs outside the
price ceilings, and industry sources say a Reagan
majority on the FERC would be expected to ease
those limits.
— More liberal interpretations of what con
stitutes high-cost gas. The P'ERC can set higher
prices for gas that is expensive to produce.
But some industry officials have urged more
liberal interpretations of what constitutes a tight
sand formation, which could extend the higher
price to other gas deposits.
— More liberal use of a part of the law that al
lows producers to receive a higher price — as long
as it is "just and reasonable" — in order to in
crease production from wells already under con
tract. As with the definition of high-cost gas, the
law doesn't define what Congress meant by "just
and reasonable."
Reduced paperwork
The FERC has increased the required paper
work for gas producers above that required by the
Natural Gas Policy Act. While some sources ques
tion how much the paperwork can be reduced,
some attempt to cut it back is expected under a
Reagan-appointed commission.
In anticipating such changes in direction, gas
industry sources say that Reagan's appointees to
the FERC may be more pro-industry than the
commission has been in the past, but that the
change probably won't be dramatic. Industry of
ficials generally give high marks to Curtis, the
FERC's present chairman, and identify the
FERC as the agency that is most responsive to in
dustry concerns among those within the Depart
ment of Energy.
