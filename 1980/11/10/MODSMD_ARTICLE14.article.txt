## Dealing with many rat races at once 
### 
Last week we had a rat on our
hall At least most of us swear
that it was a rat. for though
some protests of "mouse" have
been heard, the dude was just
too damn big.
Anyway, the point is that last
week we had a rat on the hall
and my roommate and 1 were
terrified We both had
"Willard" on the brain.
Moreover, she recalled, as in
Orwell's 1984, everyone is sus
ceptible to unholy terror when
faced with their biggest fear
My fear is stepping barefoot on
slugs; hers is sharing her space
with a rat.
Faced with the unpleasant
thought of a rat attack, my
roommate was slowly but sure
ly becoming obsessed with ter
ror, and I was not far behind in
concern. But faced, also, with
papers due the next day. neither
of us could afford the luxury of
hysteria.
So. rather spontaneously, we
began to get giddy We took our
paper and drew signs for the hall
and the closet into which the rat
had escaped Creatively we
warned the dorm. "Danger —
Killer Rat Inside." "Stop — Rat
Crossing." "Caution — Rat
Alert."
OK. so I admit, you had to be
there But the signs served their
purpose for we quickly calmed
down. Here was an effective,
pleasant, productive solution to
the problem.
To achieve an effective solu
tion to a problem is difficult. To
learn to be adaptive when in
stituting a solution is even more
difficult. It is necessary to allow
"give" in a solution in order for
changes in a problem to be
made
If. for example, the rat in our
hall had chosen to venture forth
into our room, instead of snooz
ing in the hall closet, our signs
wouldn't have been worthy pidd
ly-drip. though a machine-gun
might have been usful. Thus,
our solution well formed in the

Culture cannot escape a sense of frustration

apparently unalterable situation.

primary stage would have be
come ineffective or even absurd
in view of later developments.
Two new administrations
have entered into the life of the
Stanford student of the '80s. the
administrations of Donald Ken
nedy and President-elect
Ronald Reagan. It is imperative
that an awareness of the neces
sity for viable solutions be held
keenly in the forefront of the
consciousness of each leader.
Both Kennedy and Reagan
when faced with difficulties as
trying as those which face us
now. may be tempted to al
leviate these problems through
broad reaching regulation and
restriction, through a general
izing of the answers. Yet. how
ever well-based or thorough a
solution may be, too general an
application of its ideals may
lead to anachronistic or in
sensitive enforcement of inef
fective regulations.

The University, now run by
Kennedy, acknowledges in
many ways the merits of flex
ibility The opportunities af
forded the Stanford student for
designing his or her own major,
and the liberal attitude of the
University towards "stopping
out" are two prime illustrations
of the need to operate with the
final goal, rather than the en
forcement of a regulation in
mind
The new distribution require
ments which have been in
stituted in Kennedy's first year
also seem designed towards
shaping a student toward a less
rigidly prejudiced, if a more
regulated education. Regu
lation does not necessarily sig
nify rigidity, only if a regulation
fails to acknowledge the individ
ual does it become burdensome
to its goal
Kennedy has seen the neglect
of undergraduate education in
the humanities as one of the ma
jor academic difficulties facing
Stanford today. In response to
this problem, the program in
Western Culture has been de
veloped and instituted as a re
quirement for students of the
class of '84. In the program's de
velopment, the University has
taken into account individual
variations in student interests,
and as such, has offered a
number of course alternatives
with which one may fulfill the
requirement. By offering this
choice, the school commen
dably reflects an awareness of
the weakness of general solu
tions. •
Where the University seems
to fall short of such an aware
ness. however, is in respect to
the rigidity with which it has in
stituted the program in Western
Culture. Apparently in expecta
tion of a strong backlash of pro
test and complaints from the
students shouldering the
Western Culture requirement,
the formulators of the program

have adapted a "no budging"
policy towards changes in the
program for a time span of at
least three years.
This means that difficulties
now becoming apparent even in
the first quarter of Western Cul
ture. will not, in all likelihood be
responded to before that time.
Thus, although the depart
ment is conscientiously
monitoring student response to
the courses through question
naires and the like, the students
now involved in the program
cannot escape a sense of frus
tration when voicing their com
plaints in a now apparently un
alterable situation.
Interpersonal alienation as
encountered by students in
Western Culture is one of the
blatant dangers of instituting
rigid, master policies in re
sponse to a perceived general
need. The University per

petuates this difficulty by fol
lowing policies of similar rigidi
ty in other situations which al
though formulated with the pro
motion of flexibility in mind,
fail to reflect such flexibility
themselves
For example, the freshman
housing policy as practiced by
Residential Education supports
the need for freshman to learn
to adapt to unfamiliar situations
by stringently insisting on a pol
icy of "no housing changes' for
freshman students. Few if any
changes annually are allowed,
especially in mid-quarter or
first-quarter changes.
According to Residential
Education only a truly unique
situation could justify a mid
quarter switch, and no truly
unique situation has arisen in
five years. Such a figure could
hardly reflect reality. What it
does reflect is rigidity in per
petuating a policy in favor of the
recognition of the individual
Interpersonal alienation is
hardly the sole danger of rigid
solutions: growing ineffective
ness of a policy accompanied by
reactionary backlash are very
real dangers of such a solution
These dangers are exceptional
ly relevant to the national
scene, and should be acknowl
edged by the administration
which will be responsible for
formulation solutions to world
wide and national troubles in the
next four years.
Reagan will inevitably dis
cover that hard-nosed, rigid
lines, be they conservatively or

liberally aligned, seldom are ef
fective tools with which to ac
complish anything except tying
oneself into a bind This is true
especially with regard to for
eign policy, where rigid rejec
tion of communist or socialist
governments and leaders will
lead to the alienation of many of
our European and non-Western
allies, whose governments re
flect the strength of the Com
munist party in their country
Inflexible policies adapted at
home with respect to human
rights that will project the at
titudes of an interest group into
the freedom of the individual
will inspire human alienation
and dangerous angry response
The nation has chosen for itself
a conservative leaning, but it
may soon find cries of tem
perance in conservatism as
abounding as those which were
the response of the nation to the
radicalism of the '60s
So. we may soon see that
there is no better mousetrap (or
rat-trap as the case may be), no
panacea for the ills of a country
or a university. Then, what we
may do is formulate solutions as
best we can, and apply these
solutions remembering the
merits of flexibility. To be flex
ible is not to be weak or to be a
proponent of anarchy; it is to be
certain enough of one's goals as
to have the strength to acknowl
edge the weaknesses of one's
planned route in reaching them.
