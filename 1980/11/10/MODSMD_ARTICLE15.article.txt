No more inserts
When will the Daily stop lit
tering the campus with
thousands upon thousands of ad
vertising inserts? In an era and
on a campus very concerned
about recycling, pollution and
litter, the Daily continues to put
glossy inserts into its issues,
only to have them strewn across
the pavement and grass by
noontime.
Someone wrote to the Daily a
couple of years ago protesting
this creation of waste, only to be
told that the students who pick
up the Daily and leave the insert
on the ground are the causes,
and that the Daily needs the in
come.
Let's be realistic about this.
Of course, students do leave the
inserts. Who wants to carry
around Arbv's coupons all day?
But it is simplistic to assert that
students cause the problem If
there were no inserts, there
would not be a litter problem
The most efficient solution to
this problem is to adopt a policy
of no inserts in the Daily. The
Daily loses some money, but it
keeps the campus cleaner, and
saves the University (ultimate
ly. the students — who pay for
the Daily by their fee

assessments, incidentally) the
cost of cleaning up the mess.
How about some social con
sciousness?

Evers correct
The story on the con
gressional candidates' debate
on youth service (Daily, Nov. 3)
was troubling from a journal
istic standpoint. As a lawyer, I
can assure Daily readers that
Bill Evers was correct on the
impact of denial of a Supreme
Court hearing on constitutional
law. Congressman Pete Mc-
Closkey (R-Menlo Park) was
completely wrong.
What I cannot understand is
why in a case like this where one
person had to be right and the
other wrong, the Daily did not
interview a law professor like
(ierald Gunther or Paul Brest to
tell readers who was right.

Campus traffic
Both the Stanford University
administration and the harb

ingers of doom to pedestrians
seem to be almost as
thoughtless as the would-be
criminals, naively counting on
the wonders of human con
sideration for one's fellow man
to solve the problem.
Witness such consideration in
the way 200 bikes challenge any
one in a wheelchair to make it to
the door of Green Library!
Is campus traffic behavior
any different than what we see
on our highways? (We are told
how many thousands of lives are
saved by driving 55 and obeying
speed limits in general; notice
how many of your fellow
citizens are daily looking out for
your welfare')
Surely at one of the nation's
leading research institutions we
can do a little better than this.
How about safety bumps (such
as one rarely sees in parking lots
around here)? Or separate
painted corridors for pedestri
ans and bicyclists (also an un
heard-of in these parts)?
Admittedly, either alter
native will be expensive and
harmful to the aesthetics of the
University, but then so will a
lawsuit. A word to the wise
should be . . .
