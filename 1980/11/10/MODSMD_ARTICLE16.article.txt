## 'Ignorance is no excuse'

"To say that we will change
when and if circumstances de
mand it shows that we have not
even begun to understand what
is going on in the world. For two
billion people suffering from
malnutrition or actually starv
ing. the Apocalypse is not some
vague possibility in the distant
future; it has already arrived."
— Michael Jennings

Despite consistent increases
in global food production and
trade, much of sub-Saharan and
particularly East Africa are ex
periencing one of the most se
vere and widespread famines in
history. Long-term drought and
civil wars have coupled to
create starvation situations dif
ficult to relieve.
Civil wars in Ethiopia (exten
ding into Sudan), Zimbabwe,
Uganda and South Africa have
displaced millions of people, in
directly led to the decimation of
several million cattle (and oth
er herd animals) and wildlife,
and have caused significant
roadblocks for the United Na
tions and other aid agencies.
The United Nations estimates
that out of 12 million people sub
ject to severe malnutrition,
close to one million will perish
during the next few months It
appears that for Ethiopian
drought-victims and refugees
international relief efforts will
fall short by tens of thousands of
tons of grain needed to even sta
bilize their health conditions.
During the 19705, per capita
food production in Africa de

clined an average of one percent
each year. The recent drought
has reduced Kenya's food prod
uction by 40 percent. Kenya.
Zambia and Zimbabwe have all
had to become food importers.
Imagine the effect on the U.S.
economy of a 40 percent fall in
national output.
Meanwhile virtually no
cognizance of these matters is
displayed in the U.S. press or re
flected in either public intrest or
campaign rhetoric. The Econo
mist writes, "Aid agencies have
had little success in the
world to the impending trag
edy."
The Chronicle, the Daily,
Time Magazine, even Africa
Report have totally side
stepped any mention of these
problems in favor of local news,
government gossip and ideol
ogical discussions.
Does this reflect a changing
degree of concern by the U.S.
public?
Consider what was for me the
most depressing outcome from
last Tuesday's election: accord
ing to Bread for the World (an
independent U.S. hunger or
ganization ) only nine U.S. Sena
tors have voted consistently and
compassionately in favor of un
restricted (by politics) aid pro
grams. Of these, three Demo
crats were up for reelection and
only one was reelected (Alan
Cranston). Senators George
McGovern and John Culver
were replaced by conservatives
or moderates who often cen
tered attention on Panama
Canal senate votes.
In the U.S. "ignorance of the
law is no excuse." In pressing
moral problems can ignorance
be our rationale for inaction or
lack of concern?
Seven years ago several hun
dred thousand Ethiopians died
in a severe drought of which the
effects and severity were cov
ered up by the senile and ill
fated emperor, Haile Selassie.
At that time UN and relief or
ganizations felt compelled to co
operate with that coverup.

The present drought, how
ever. is complicated by prob
lems of a different sort.
Months ago. the Los Angeles
Times reported, "The UN Eco
nomic and Social Council . . .
called on governments and oth
er organizations to step up their
aid." Sufficient aid has not been
expected. But of the aid that has
been delivered, three problems
have obstructed its use.
First, expectedly, corrupt
government officials have di
verted aid to non-needy popu
lations and, indeed, to non
needy nations.
Second, as in Cambodia, war
itself has imposed harsher op
tions for rebelling areas. Refu
gees from Ogaden and Eritrea,
both at war with the govern
ment, are poorly taken care of.
In Djibouti, Eritrean refugees
are not permitted the same re
lief aid that the other hungry
qualify for.
Finally, such intense violence
has been rampant in Uganda
that aid organization workers
actually fear for their lives.
Newsweek reports, "In the
hard-hit Karamoja district of
northern Uganda, UN relief of
ficials have had to stop dis
tributing emergency food sup
plies because of the total col
lapse of law and order in the re
gion, including armed attacks
on their food convoys.
Ironically, and pathetically,
British aid organizations deeply
committed to food distribution
in Uganda must fear for the ef
fects on public opinion by such
reports. They reportedly worry
that donors back home would as
sume that further donations
would be useless reading that
the Karamoja convoys had
stopped.
It's true that no matter what
we do now, millions will die; but
is this an excuse for turning our
heads?
