# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## David Hendricks The 						Pack has struck again

Stanford students have a hab
it that is not only rude to their
professors, but may also show
the value students place on their
Stanford education: The Pack
Students quit taking notes and
start packing their books before
a professor has finished his lec
ture. This action may signify a
lack of communication between
students and faculty, or it may
indicate that students do not
seek knowledge for its own
sake.
First, let's see The Pack in
action. It is 9:48, Wednesday
morning, and the chemistry pro
fessor stands before 300 stu
dents. He writes molecular for
mulas and balances equations
on the blackboard while most of
the students look at their
notebooks, taking notes.
Some students watch the pro
fessor. while others look at the
clock , it now says 9:49. Papers
rustle, binders snap closed, and
more heads turn toward the
clock. Students shuffle
notebooks into packs, zippers
are zipped, and the professor
looks at the clock. He says, "Oh.
I'm out of time," gives his con
cluding remark, and walks
away from the blackboard. As

desks snag down, the students
stand up. congregate in the
aisles, and move out of the
auditorium The Pack has
struck again.
The Pack commonly occurs
at Stanford It not only happens
in large lecture classes, as in the
chemistry class just illustrated,
but also in smaller classes.
Many students are impatient to
get out of class. This is not man
ifested openly in smaller
classes: students might close
their notebooks, but they don't
want to attract attention to
themselves for fear the pro
fessor will glare at them.
In larger lecture classes,
however, most students present
anonymous faces to the pro
fessor. Consequently, students
can pack their books without
fearing disapproving looks from
the professor as he lectures. In
these large lecture halls. The
Pack rolls like a steamroller —
the professor cannot hold on to
the students' attention any long
er. and must yield to the stu
dents' desire to escape.
Most Stanford professors do
not approve of The Pack. This
may be a difficult statement for
a student to make, but I feel that
it can be justified. Most Stan
ford professors do research in
addition to teaching, so they are
enthusiastic about their work.
This enthusiasm corresponds to
a desire to teach other people
about their specialized subject,
whether it be chemistry,
philosophy or physics. Faced
with an audience of students,
most professors are excited by
the challenge of teaching, but
are disappointed when the au
dience starts packing to leave
before they have concluded.
This action shows the professor
that his students are not all in
terested in his lecture. The pro
fessor deserves respect for his
knowledge, and it is rude for the
students to belittle this respect.
Students may say they need to

get to their next class, but this
doesn't justify The Pack A stu
dent may leave class early if he
needs to, but it is unnecessary
for most students to start pack
ing while the professor speaks
If the student waits until the
professor finishes to put his
oooks away, he loses only 30sec
onds to the person who is ready
to go when the lecture ends. He
can also write down any impor
tant concluding remarks that
would normally get lost "in the
shuffle" if he tried to pack his
books before the lecture ended
Consequently, there does not
seem to be much point in stu
dents' putting their books away
early
If there is no justification for
The Pack, then why is it so popu
lar with the students? Maybe
The Pack illustrates a poor stu
dent-faculty relationship at
Stanford In his inauguration ad
dress, Stanford's president
Donald Kennedy said that stu
dent-faculty relations hit a low
note in the early '70s. The stu
dents no longer communicated
with the faculty as they had in
the '60s, according to Kennedy.
However, I think that the true
reason students practice The
Pack is not so simple. Poor stu
dent-faculty relations may be
part of the reason, but I think
that when students put their
books away while the professor
still lectures, they show how
they value a Stanford education.
They deprive themselves of the
opportunity to gain more knowl
edge in that class that day, so
maybe they do not look for
knowledge at Stanford, but
something else, like good
grades and success.
Are these laudable goals? As
Plato said, one should strive for
knowledge — it is more impor
tant than having power and
wealth.
