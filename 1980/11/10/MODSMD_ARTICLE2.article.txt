# Insurance option not used by students to prevent fiscal loss
## 
### Sherry Norman 
Sarah had been living in her first
floor dorm room two months when she
left one morning to play in an in
tramural football game. That after
noon a friend brought her home with a
broken leg.
Then, when Sarah pushed open the
door to her room with her newly-cast
leg. she found the room ransacked and
her brand-new stereo missing.
No doubt, Sarah spent the rest of the
day wondering what kind of insurance
policies she had to cover her health
and personal property.
All students here are guaranteed
non-hospital medical care at Cowell
Health Center. This includes neces
sary examinations, treatments and
physician visits, most laboratory and
x-ray tests and limited bedcare in the
infirmary. Psychological counseling
is also provided on a limited basis.
Supplementary plans
However, the University highly rec
ommends that students carry a sup
plementary policy to cover hospi
talization costs, fracture care, or ex
tended psychiatric care. Stanford of
fers a choice of two Blue Cross plans
which provide "hospitalization and
surgical care with provision for cov
erage of eligible dependents."
However, with the exception of for
eign students, who are required to
carry the high-level Blue Cross plan,
augmentation of the basic Cowell cov
erage is left to the individual. Accord
ing to Madelaine Smith, an adminis
trative assistant here, 75 percent of
students here choose not to take out a
supplementary policy.
Stanford's policies on student prop
erty insurance are stated in the resi
dence agreement students are re
quired to sign before moving in. Ac
cording to Bob Beth, director of the
Risk Management office, prohibitive
costs, duplication of coverage stu
dents should already have, and the
potential for litigation are the prima
ry reasons Stanford does not insure
the property of Univesity residents.
Beth urged students to obtain their
own coverage against theft, since
more than 200 property thefts were re
ported on University land in 1979.
Parents' policies
The great majority of students are
probably included on their parents'
homeowner policies and health plans.
However, according to a booklet pub
lished by Allstate Life Insurance, poli
cies vary and, depending upon idi
vidual needs, may not offer adequate
coverage.
For example, the extent of personal
property coverage under a home
owner's policy is generally based on
the amount for which the house is in
sured. Personal property off the pre
mises is covered for 10 percent of the
limit for personal property on the pre
mises. Thus a student whose parents
have insured their property for $50,000
would have his property covered for
up to $5000
However, the general rule-of-thumb
for property replacement is market
value less depreciation. This would re
sult in coverage amounting to perhaps
50 cents on the dollar.
Variety
After graduation, when dependency
status is terminated, students may
discover that the alternatives in
health and property insurance vary

widely in coverage and cost. However,
some generalizations can be made.
Group health care plans offered by
employers tend to be less expensive
than comparable policies an individ
ual could arrange with an insurance
company.
Most large corporations carry a
health insurance policy for all their
employees. Full time, and in some
cases part-time or non-salaried em
ployees as well, are automatically
covered. In these situations, individ
uals should determine what coverage
the group plans do not provide and se
cure additional insurance according to
their needs.
Almost all health plans offered by
employers include a conversion privi
lege (required by law in California).
This provides the option of trans
ferring health care from the group
plan to an individual policy, with no
minimum health requirements, when

employment is terminated.
Personal property coverage is gen
erally attached to residential insur
ance. Rental and condominium insur
ance which includes personal property
coverage is also available. Any item
can be appraised and scheduled on a
policy covering personal property
which insures replacement of the item
for its full value.
Across-the-board comparisons of
policies cannot be made. Research is
necessary to determine the best pos
sible plan in terms of coverage and
costs, and services such as Western
Insurance Information Service and In
surance Information Institute provide
information and counseling.
The first step is to outline your
needs. Then, compare available alter
natives. Finally, safeguard yourself
and the things you value against poten
tial injury or loss before the need for
coverage arises.
