# Force bests finesse at Stanford Stadium
## 
### Mike Oneal 
It was pegged as a contest
between one of the greatest
offensive teams in the corn
try and one of the nation's
finest defenses John Elwav's
Flying Circus vs. The Watts
Bruisers And as is often the
case in such situations, sheer
physical force took the field
right away from finesse —
USC beat Stanford right into
the ground.
Everyone on the Farm said
last week the key to a Stan
ford victory lay in scoring
early and forcing the Trojans
to play catch-up ball. The
problem Saturday was Stan
ford couldn't force USC to do
anything, and after the Tro
jans scored on their first two
drives. Elwav. Nelson and Co
were left trying to pick the
lock for the rest of the after
noon.
The old saying holds true
for the USC defense — "Man
for man. pound for pound,
there ain't no finer show
around." They are big. mean
and as Stanford head coach
Paul Wiggin said after the
game. "They came out
smokin'." He went on to say
that. "Coming in. we needed
our very best day We had to
be on a high 1 think we met
USC at their best and I think
the game films will show that
we weren't flat. But they
focused in and knew what
they were doing "
What they were doing was
dominating. Thev forced

Stanford out of their tradi
tional multi-faceted offense
by limiting their options.
When Dennis Smith hit
flanker Ken Margerum on the
first play of the game — a 16-
vard completion — one of the
Cards' most dangerous of
fensive alternatives was
pummelled to half-strength
Margerum suffered bruised
ribs and a hip pointer and said
later, "I was probably at 50
percent after that first play."
That was but one of a rash
of injuries that disabled Stan
ford Chris Dressel. the
durable tight end. went out
with a concussion in the first
half. Darrin Nelson was out
for the second half becausehis
ankle simply couldn't take
being trampled on any longer.
Guard Mike Neill suffered a
twisted knee
These were injuries that
came from tenacious de
fense. Those players were
forced to leave the game.
Margerum said that Smith hit
him cleanly and Nelson ex
plained that "They'd hit me
up top and then someone
would come and run over my
leg. Every game 1 play, peo
ple try to do that, but today
they really got to me."
The point is. USC doesn't do
things differently than other
teams, they just do them a lot
harder. At least they did Sat
urday.
With Margerum at half
speed and limited in his jump
ing ability (which usuallv al

lows him to sky over double
coverage). much of Stan
ford's long game was
stymied
Nelson could muster only
21 yards in the half he played,
which isn't bad when you con
sider Stanford finished with
minus 13 yards on the ground
Elway was sacked eight
times and forced out of the
pocket the rest of the time.
In essence. USC came up
with glue-like coverage down
field and a bull-like rush up
front In a typical drive, Stan
ford could only get one. may
be two long passes for good
yardage and had to resort to
short screens to the fullbacks
or abortive running plays the
rest of the time. The Cards
couldn't keep anything going
long enough to have a substan
tial effect on the scoreboard.
When it seemed, on occasion,
like they might have their
rhythm back, it was disrupted
up again by a penalty, sack,
broken play or fumble.
"They were just too big and
too fast," Nelson said.
"That's the only explanation I
can think of. At one point. Vin
cent (White) came over to the
sideline and asked What are
you supposed to do out there?"
They just wear you down. It's
definitely the best defense
I've ever seen."
Elway. who had developed
intimate relationships with
most of the Trojan defensive
line by the end of the game,
echoed the same frustration.

"The pass rush kept getting
stronger and stronger." the
quarterback said They did a
good job of holding the re
ceivers on the line at the be
ginning of a plav and I
couldn't hold it (the ball>that
long They were better than I
thought they'd be "
It seemed most of the team
felt they were simply out
played by a better team. That
includes Wiggin who said,
"History will prove that this

IS a tine USC football team."
Senior offensive tackle
Brian Holloway sang a sepa
rate tune
"They put pressure on us
and we didn't respond like we
usually do — like we've done
in the past." he said "We
beat ourselves."
Perhaps at 6-foot-7 and 270
pounds. Holloway was the
only Cardinal presented with
that option.

This wasn t a play from scrimmage, but it reflects the trou
bles Stanford's offense had with the football Saturday after
noon. Eric Mullins (left) and Vincent White (right, 22) bobble
a third-quarter kickoff.
It was pegged as a contest
between one of the greatest
offensive teams in the corn
try and one of the nation's
finest defenses John Elwav's
Flying Circus vs. The Watts
Bruisers And as is often the
case in such situations, sheer
physical force took the field
right away from finesse —
USC beat Stanford right into
the ground.
Everyone on the Farm said
last week the key to a Stan
ford victory lay in scoring
early and forcing the Trojans
to play catch-up ball. The
problem Saturday was Stan
ford couldn't force USC to do
anything, and after the Tro
jans scored on their first two
drives. Elwav. Nelson and Co
were left trying to pick the
lock for the rest of the after
noon.
The old saying holds true
for the USC defense — "Man
for man. pound for pound,
there ain't no finer show
around." They are big. mean
and as Stanford head coach
Paul Wiggin said after the
game. "They came out
smokin'." He went on to say
that. "Coming in. we needed
our very best day We had to
be on a high 1 think we met
USC at their best and I think
the game films will show that
we weren't flat. But they
focused in and knew what
they were doing "
What they were doing was
dominating. Thev forced

Stanford out of their tradi
tional multi-faceted offense
by limiting their options.
When Dennis Smith hit
flanker Ken Margerum on the
first play of the game — a 16-
vard completion — one of the
Cards' most dangerous of
fensive alternatives was
pummelled to half-strength
Margerum suffered bruised
ribs and a hip pointer and said
later, "I was probably at 50
percent after that first play."
That was but one of a rash
of injuries that disabled Stan
ford Chris Dressel. the
durable tight end. went out
with a concussion in the first
half. Darrin Nelson was out
for the second half becausehis
ankle simply couldn't take
being trampled on any longer.
Guard Mike Neill suffered a
twisted knee
These were injuries that
came from tenacious de
fense. Those players were
forced to leave the game.
Margerum said that Smith hit
him cleanly and Nelson ex
plained that "They'd hit me
up top and then someone
would come and run over my
leg. Every game 1 play, peo
ple try to do that, but today
they really got to me."
The point is. USC doesn't do
things differently than other
teams, they just do them a lot
harder. At least they did Sat
urday.
With Margerum at half
speed and limited in his jump
ing ability (which usuallv al

lows him to sky over double
coverage). much of Stan
ford's long game was
stymied
Nelson could muster only
21 yards in the half he played,
which isn't bad when you con
sider Stanford finished with
minus 13 yards on the ground
Elway was sacked eight
times and forced out of the
pocket the rest of the time.
In essence. USC came up
with glue-like coverage down
field and a bull-like rush up
front In a typical drive, Stan
ford could only get one. may
be two long passes for good
yardage and had to resort to
short screens to the fullbacks
or abortive running plays the
rest of the time. The Cards
couldn't keep anything going
long enough to have a substan
tial effect on the scoreboard.
When it seemed, on occasion,
like they might have their
rhythm back, it was disrupted
up again by a penalty, sack,
broken play or fumble.
"They were just too big and
too fast," Nelson said.
"That's the only explanation I
can think of. At one point. Vin
cent (White) came over to the
sideline and asked What are
you supposed to do out there?"
They just wear you down. It's
definitely the best defense
I've ever seen."
Elway. who had developed
intimate relationships with
most of the Trojan defensive
line by the end of the game,
echoed the same frustration.

"The pass rush kept getting
stronger and stronger." the
quarterback said They did a
good job of holding the re
ceivers on the line at the be
ginning of a plav and I
couldn't hold it (the ball>that
long They were better than I
thought they'd be "
It seemed most of the team
felt they were simply out
played by a better team. That
includes Wiggin who said,
"History will prove that this

IS a tine USC football team."
Senior offensive tackle
Brian Holloway sang a sepa
rate tune
"They put pressure on us
and we didn't respond like we
usually do — like we've done
in the past." he said "We
beat ourselves."
