mirrored their season, the Stan
ford soccer team started slow
but finished with a flourish in
defeating Cal 2-0 before 8.000
fans at Memorial Stadium Sat

dominated in the first half, they
came roaring back with two sec
ond-half goals to seal the vic

pened during the season for

Stanford.ln closing their season
with a five-game winning
streak, the Cards finally evened
their overall record at 10-10-1
and their conference slate at a
respectable 5-2 with a shot for
second place in the Pacific Soc
cer Conference.

Junior striker Ted Rafalovich
summarized the season by
saying. "We had a lot of tough

times this year with the eastern
road trip and all, but a lot of
things were made up for by the
last five games. We gained plen
ty of experience playing those
great teams (in the East) but I
think it showed in our league
play and hopefully it will carry
over into next season."
Besides finishing the season
with a savored victory over its
cross-bay rival. Stanford re
ceived more than just the satis
/ ni a. m v
faction of whomping on the
Bears. The Bronze Boot — soc
cer's answer to the Big Game
Axe — is the latest trophy to be
awarded by the schools. Given
the winner of the "Big Game in
soccer", the boot will be pres
ented to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger today by the seniors on
the soccer squad.
It may be the first year the
Bronze Boot has been awarded
to Stanford, but it is the fifth
consecutive season Cal has been
unable to defeat the Cards.
However, it was not just anoth
er in an easy string of victories
for Stanford.
Cal dominated the first half of
play. By marking up on Stan
ford's front line of Rafalovich,
Willie Giucci and Jorge Tit
inger, the Bears were able to
keep the Cards' offensive attack
in check. More importantly,
though, the Bears controlled the
ball for much of the time at
Stanford's end of the field.
The Cards were only able to
hold on with great defense by
goalie Jeff Jones and Jim
Witham, who, according to head
coach Nelson Lodge, "played

superbly and stopped a number
of key plays."
The second half commenced
with Stanford's strikers taking
their marks out of position, the
halfbacks moving into play and
the offense striking at the goal
better.
The game's first score came
on Giucci's corner kick (Doug
Clark assisting) with ten
minutes expired in the second
half. Almost seven minutes lat
er, Walter Kingston got the ball
to Rafalovich who turned and
put it into the net.
"I felt we had the advantage
coming into the second half,"
Rafalovich said. "I think when
they didn't score after domi
nating the first half, they had to
have become very frustrated.
Also, we've become more dan
gerous on the attack, we've been
scoring our chances, and our de
fense has become more confi
dent."
Though the team is hot, the
season is over. The victory
streak will have to be put on
"hold" for 10 months.

cer's answer to the Big Game
Axe — is the latest trophy to be
awarded by the schools. Given
the winner of the "Big Game in
soccer", the boot will be pres
ented to Athletic Director Andy
Geiger today by the seniors on
the soccer squad.
It may be the first year the
Bronze Boot has been awarded
to Stanford, but it is the fifth
consecutive season Cal has been
unable to defeat the Cards.
However, it was not just anoth
er in an easy string of victories
for Stanford.
Cal dominated the first half of
play. By marking up on Stan
ford's front line of Rafalovich,
Willie Giucci and Jorge Tit
inger, the Bears were able to
keep the Cards' offensive attack
in check. More importantly,
though, the Bears controlled the
ball for much of the time at
Stanford's end of the field.
The Cards were only able to
hold on with great defense by
goalie Jeff Jones and Jim
Witham, who, according to head
coach Nelson Lodge, "played

superbly and stopped a number
of key plays."
The second half commenced
with Stanford's strikers taking
their marks out of position, the
halfbacks moving into play and
the offense striking at the goal
better.
The game's first score came
on Giucci's corner kick (Doug
Clark assisting) with ten
minutes expired in the second
half. Almost seven minutes lat
er, Walter Kingston got the ball
to Rafalovich who turned and
put it into the net.
"I felt we had the advantage
coming into the second half,"
Rafalovich said. "I think when
they didn't score after domi
nating the first half, they had to
have become very frustrated.
Also, we've become more dan
gerous on the attack, we've been
scoring our chances, and our de
fense has become more confi
dent."
Though the team is hot, the
season is over. The victory
streak will have to be put on
"hold" for 10 months.
