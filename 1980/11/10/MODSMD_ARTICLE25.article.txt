Superlatives are fast becom
ing the only words to use in de
scribing Stanford's water polo
team. The Cardinals defeated
Long Beach State Friday after
noon 14-4 and fourth-ranked USC
9-2 Saturday with an absolute
barrage of scoring.
Water polo
The two victories clinched a
berth in the NCAA Cham
pionship Tournament for Stan
ford and gave the team a 24-1-1
overall record and an un
touchable 4-0 Pacific-10 Con
ference mark.
Alan Mouchawar played su
perman in Friday's contest at
deGuerre Pool, scoring seven
goals. Apparently Mouchawar
had warmed up his arm Thurs
day at practice, because his
teammates commented that he
had been putting something ex
tra on the ball.
"He was shooting incredibly
well in practice yesterday,"
Stanford head coach Dante Det
tamanti said. "Everybody was
commenting on how much
heat' he had on the ball, and
then he came out today just
humming."
The first half against Long
Beach was simply an endless
stream of Card counter-attacks
and fast breaks. Dettamanti
called it "one of the best starts
we've had in years."
Stanford's offensive effec
tiveness was matched by almost
invincible defensive play. Long
Beach managed only one goal by
the end of the half as several
Cards rose halfway out of the

water to pull down 49er shots or
passes and fire them down pool
to Mouchawar or Jody
Campbell for scores.
Stagnating somewhat during
the start of the second half, the
Cards outscored the 49ers by
only 3-2 in the third quarter.
Even so, the defense showed no
real letdown; the 49er scores
were more dependent on good
breaks than excellent play.
Campbell fouled out of the
game, upsetting the Cards
enough to slow their game
down.
"When Jody fouled out, it took
us three or four minutes to ad
just, get our usual game going
again. We had to slow things
down and get used to playing
with different people. Conse
quently, people started trying to
force the play, they threw balls
away and committed offensive
fouls," Dettamanti said. "It
was more a matter of strange
calls by the referee that did it.
Not poor defense, but circum
stances."
The Cards regained their
rhythm by the start of the fourth
quarter, outscoring the 49ers
5-0. Maurice Mouchawar, Brian
Felix and Greg Lambert made
positive contributions while fill
ing in for Campbell.
Maurice Mouchawar scored
twice in the fourth quarter,
slapping the ball in on a pass
from Bill Taylor and slamming
the ball home over the middle on
a pass from Chris Kelsey. Felix
also scored a goal, and Lambert
set up several counter-attacks
with his defensive play.
While Stanford cruised to an
easy victory, USC was trying to

keep its head above water
against California and losing the
battle. 5-3. which worried Det
tamanti to a certain extent
"They (the Trojans) will be
very angry." he said upon hear
ing the result from Berkeley.
"They're going to come over
here with fire in their eyes."
Between USC's anger and the
Cards' confidence, the first
quarter featured a series of
counter-attacks from both ends
of the pool, none of which were
effective. USC finally scored
first with eight seconds remain
ing when a Trojan got inside wa
ter and fired the ball past goalie
John Gansel.
The Cards were unable to cap
italize on their 6-on-5-man ad
vantages, a problem that has
plagued them all season.
Stanford finally tallied with
only 3:30 remaining in the half,
when James Bergeson capital
ized on a man-up advantage,
slamming the ball into the goal
from 4 meters.
From then on "fast-break"
became the word for the day.
Campbell scored twice more
before the half ended, once after

taking a counter-attack pass
from Alan Mouchawar at mid
pool. swimming the ball to the
goal and taking it in.
With 1:20 remaining,
Campbell took a long pass form
Gansel and went one-on-one
with the Trojan goalie, forcing
the goalie to commit himself to
the right side of the goal.
Campbell then split his arm in
two. reaching to the left and
tossing the ball in
Alan Mouchawar scored his
only goal of the game on the
very next play, taking a counter
attack pass from Gansel and fir
ing the ball into the left corner
of the goal from 2 meters.
The second half was all
Gansel. He racked up 18 saves,
far exceeding his average of 11.
When he wasn't throwing his
body across the goal, he was
tossing perfect passes down
pool on counter-attacks.
Four of Stanford's goals were
scored in that way, each of them
crucial in breaking the game
open.
