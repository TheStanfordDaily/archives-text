"I'm totally impressed,"
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin en
thused. "Every time they (the
Card golfers) would start to
falter, they'd recover. They're
extremely strong mentally —
they kept bringing themselves
back."
Pacillo impressed Baldwin
most of all. She outlasted San
Jose State's Julie Inkster (the
defending U.S. Amateur wom
en's champion) and USIU's
Philiippia Barry in a sudden
death playoff to capture the in
dividual title after tying them at
225 during regulation play.
At the first playoff hole, Stan
ford's par-4 10th, Pacillo turned
in what Baldwin called "one of
the most remarkable pars I've
ever seen in my life." Her sec
ond shot sailed into a sand trap
in front of the green, leaving
Pacillo in trouble, since the
greens were quite fast and the
pin was situated adjacent to the
trap.

However. Pacillo blasted out
of the trap to within five feet of
the pin and sank the putt for the
par.
Inkster was eliminated on
that hole, leaving Pacillo and
Barry, who missed a 15-foot putt
for a par on the next playoff hole
to give Pacillo the victory.
"Joanne is truly one of the
finest women amateurs in the
country." Baldwin said. The
coach also pointed out that
Pacillo played despite being
nagged by scratchy eyes caused
by her contact lenses and
burdened with midterms.
Spikers face toughies
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team — fresh off two
straight-game victories last
week — will go a long way
toward deciding its post-season
fate in the next two days.
The Cards moved their Nor-
Cal Conference record to 7-1 last

week with a 15-2, 15-12, 15-3
shellacking of USF and a like
wise handling of Santa Clara:
15-11, 15-4, 15-9.
While Santa Clara will get a
chance for revenge tonight at 6
p.m. at the Broncos' home
court, Stanford is readying for
tomorrow night's home match
against conference leader UOP.
With UOP at 9-0 in the con
ference. two Stanford wins
would pull the Cards into a tie
for first in NorCal play and
almost certainly set them up for
the AIAW regional playoffs lat
er this month. The conference
champion gets an automatic
berth in the eight-team field,
while the runner-up most likely
will get an at-large berth.
Crew 'four' wins
Oakland — Stanford's wom
en's four took a big victory over
Cal and several other northern
California schools in the Head of

the Estuary regatta this week
end.
The veteran crew of coxswain
Mary Swan. Margi P'etter (a
two-time junior national team
member). Jocelyn Keating,
Martha Hoffman and Anne
Cuthbertson rowed the three
mile course in less than 22
minutes.
The women's eight finished
fourth in an eight-shell field, but
ahead of all the non-Cal teams.

"I'm totally impressed,"
Stanford coach Tim Baldwin en
thused. "Every time they (the
Card golfers) would start to
falter, they'd recover. They're
extremely strong mentally —
they kept bringing themselves
back."
Pacillo impressed Baldwin
most of all. She outlasted San
Jose State's Julie Inkster (the
defending U.S. Amateur wom
en's champion) and USIU's
Philiippia Barry in a sudden
death playoff to capture the in
dividual title after tying them at
225 during regulation play.
At the first playoff hole, Stan
ford's par-4 10th, Pacillo turned
in what Baldwin called "one of
the most remarkable pars I've
ever seen in my life." Her sec
ond shot sailed into a sand trap
in front of the green, leaving
Pacillo in trouble, since the
greens were quite fast and the
pin was situated adjacent to the
trap.

However. Pacillo blasted out
of the trap to within five feet of
the pin and sank the putt for the
par.
Inkster was eliminated on
that hole, leaving Pacillo and
Barry, who missed a 15-foot putt
for a par on the next playoff hole
to give Pacillo the victory.
"Joanne is truly one of the
finest women amateurs in the
country." Baldwin said. The
coach also pointed out that
Pacillo played despite being
nagged by scratchy eyes caused
by her contact lenses and
burdened with midterms.
Spikers face toughies
The Stanford women's vol
leyball team — fresh off two
straight-game victories last

15-11, 15-4, 15-9.
