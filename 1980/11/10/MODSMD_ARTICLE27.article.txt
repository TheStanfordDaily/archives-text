Iran, Iraq war centers on oil targets
Beirut, Lebanon — Iran and Iraq traded air and sea
raids on each other's oil lifelines yesterday and both
claimed fresh gains in ground combat.
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr convened a
war council in an undisclosed city in the frontline province
of Khuzistan. Tehran radio reported
Shortly afterward the radio, monitored here, said Iran
would ration basic commodities, such as sugar and elec
tricity. to help the war effort and that the price of gasoline
in that oil-rich nation soon would be tripled
Iraq, meanwhile, said it would not free the captured Ira
nian oil minister and declared that any city the Iraqi
forces conquer in Khuzistan will be considered a "liber
ated territory."
Waves of helicopter gunships rocketed and set ablaze a
natural gas storage facility and a gas pipeline in Iran's
besieged oil refining city of Abadan in Khuzistan on the
eastern coast of the Shatt al-Arab waterway, an Iraqi com
munique said.
Cause of fatal mine explosion sought
Charleston, W.Va. — Safety inspectors began searching
yesterday for the cause of a methane gas explosion that
killed five men two miles deep inside a coal mine, com
pany officials said
The five miners, assigned to repair trolley tracks in an
unused section of the southern West Virginia mine, died
early Friday when a pocket of the gas exploded Rescue
te;.ms were unable to remove the bodies until late Satur
day night.
A spokesman at Westmoreland Coal Co.'s Ferrell No. 17
mine in Robinson said inspectors from the federal Mine
Safety and Health Administration, the state Department
of Mines, the United Mine Workers of America and the
company were assessing the damage and trying to de
termine why the mine's ventilation system allowed
methane to build up
Steve Anderson. Westmoreland's chief spokesman, said
the cause of the accident appeared to be "improper ven
tilation that was not carrying off the methane."
"There was not enough air flow." he said. "I don't know
why."
"It could be a long, drawn out affair," Jack Perry, pres
ident of UMW's District 17. said yesterday. "It's going to
take a week to thoroughly inspect things."
Polish union awaits court decision
Warsaw, Poland — Leaders of Poland's defiant trade
union "Solidarity" mapped strategy here yesterday in the
last hours before a Supreme Court session that could spark
a new wave of strikes in this Soviet-bloc nation.
At the same time, the communist government stepped
up its warnings of grave social and economic conse
quences of a strike. And Polish television showed film of
joint Polish-Soviet military exercises held in an area that
Western observers believe is in the country's north, near
the Baltic Sea.
Yesterday marked the third day of a sit-in by teachers,
doctors and health care workers at the district govern
ment headquarters in Gdansk. The protest began after
separate wage and benefit talks with senior government
negotiators broke down.
Officials of Solidarity barred reporters from the Club of
Catholic Intellectuals, site of Solidarity's national pre
sidium meeting, and refused comment when asked if nego
tiations with the government were under way or planned.

We must tell you that there will be no comment, no
statement." said Jan Litvnski. a member of the dissident
Committee for Social Self-Defense and an associate of the
union leadership
The Supreme Court is expected to rule today on Solidar
ity's petition to delete from the charter a district court-or
dered phrase affirming the leading role of the Communist
Party
Warsaw District Court inserted the clause last month
when it approved the union s application for official regis
tration The union said it does not oppose the concept of the
amendment, but that its insertion in the charter under
mines its independence, a right granted by the govern
ment after the crippling strikes two months ago
Search for lost freighter continues
New York — l .S. and Canadian aircraft searched the
Atlantic again yesterday for a freighter missing with a
crew of 33 for more than two weeks. Officials said a freak
storm may have caused its disappearance.
The 52'2-foot Poet was reported missing Oct. 25.the day
after it left Cape Henlopen. Del . with a load of corn bound
for Port Said. Egypt, the Coast Guard said.
As many as 10 aircraft from the U.S. Coast Guard and
Navy. Canada and other points have searched up to 400
miles offshore without sighting the freighter. The aircraft
have covered thousands of square miles of ocean.
The day after the Poet set out. a freak storm lashed the
sea off New York and Massachusetts, roughly the area the
ship was cruising High wind and waves and heavy rain
that day added a "possibly ominous element," a Coast
Guard spokesman said.
The Poet should have radioed its position daily, but as of
vesterday no contact had been made. It did not pass
through the Straits of Gibraltar on Saturday as scheduled.
The Poet, registered in the United States, is owned by
the Hawaiian Eugenia Corp of New York. No represent
ative of the company could be reached for comment yes
terday.
Baker calls for immediate tax cut
Washington — Sen Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) said yes
terday he believes Congress should enact a tax cut quickly,
without delaying until the federal budget can be balanced.
Baker, who is set to become majority leader when the
Republicans take control of the Senate in January, also
said he hopes the lame-duck congressional session conven
ing this week will be as brief as possible.
"I hope we're out of here by Thanksgiving," he said on
ABC's " Issues and Answers" program.
On the tax cut. Baker said: "Whether it should be done
now or in January. I think there should be tax relief
without waiting" until the budget is balanced.
Such a tax measure should help fuel "a big boost in eco
nomic activity in this country" during 1981, he said.
But. Baker added that he has "grave doubts" President
Jimmy Carter would sign any tax cut which might come
out of the lame-duck session.
Long-stranded Haitians to be rescued
Miami — A Bahamian government vessel leaves port to
day to begin the rescue of 102 Haitians stranded on a tiny
island for more than a month — a mission delayed because
ships were busy with "other priorities," a Bahamian
spokesman said.
"It was a matter of getting the government tender

scheduled to pick them up." Bahamian spokesman Bill
Kailis said by telephone from Nassau "It wasn't possible
to move any faster than that."
The Haitians were spotted Oct. 9 by the U.S. Coast
Guard. which notified Bahamian officials. Five Haitians
are believed to have starved before the Coast Guard dis
covered them and began weekly drops of food and water
The Bahamian government has jurisdiction over the is
land Kailis said the rescue ship would leave today, as had
been previously scheduled, and would reach the Haitians
on tomorrow
The Haitians were apparently hoping to reach the U.S.
bv boat when they were stranded on Cayo Lobos. a foot
ball-field size island off the northeastern coast of Cuba
some 300 miles from their homeland
There were other priorities for the (Bahamian) gov
ernment tender that is used for inter-island transport of
construction materials. . . . taking illegal immigrants
back to Haiti" and other purposes. Kailis said.
Voyager shots show more of Saturn
Pasadena — Voyager 1, its cameras examining Saturn
from 2 1 2 million miles away on yesterday, is sending pic
tures of subtle swirls of color on what Earth-bound ob
servers see only as a surface of golden clouds.
The giant, gaseous planet. 800 times as big as Earth, is
marked by spots and halos. twisting filigrees and swirling
ribbons of soft tans, yellows, oranges and browns moved
by the planet's winds.
"One begins to see more and more features that are
very, very similar to what we saw in the atmosphere of
Jupiter." where Voyager caught exotic and colorful im
ages in March 1979. photography team leader Bradford
Smith said yesterday.
The increasingly complex detail eased pre-encounter
fears that Voyager might see only bland, yellow clouds on
Saturn.
Earlier images — what Smith called "wild color pic
tures" — were enhanced by computer wizardry that great
ly exaggerated Saturn's subtle shadings.
The slightly less dramatic photos released yesterday
are "a bit closer to what we think Saturn really looks like,"
Smith said.
Begin in U.S. to meet with Carter
New York — Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
arrived in New York yesterday for a 10-day visit which is
to include get-togethers with the American Jewish com
munity and a farewell meeting with President Jimmy
Carter.
Begin, who spent the day resting at a Manhattan hotel
after arriving at Kennedy International Airport just
before 6 a.m., has said he does not expect to meet with
President-elect Ronald Heagan.
"I don't think this is a proper occasion for such a meet
ing and I assume it won't take place," the prime minister
told reporters upon his departure from the Tel Aviv air
port.
Begin aides had tried to set up the meeting, but Begin
said Reagan "was absolutely right when he explained that
it is a delicate matter since he has not yet taken over his
duties as president."
Begin, who did not speak with reporters upon his arrival
in Manhattan, had no scheduled appointments yesterday.
He planned to stay in New York until Wednesday when he
leaves for Washington.
The formal purpose of his visit is to attend a dinner to
day marking the 100 th anniversary of the birth of Ze'ev

Jabotinsky. founder of Begin s Herut political movement.
Age-old dispute over Luther revived
Bonn, West Germany — Martin Luther, the German the
ologian whose teachings split the Christian faith nearly 500
years ago. is at the center of a dispute between Roman
Catholics and Protestants arising during preparations for
a visit by Pope John Paul II
At issue is the treatment of the "Great Reformer,"
whose birthday 497 years ago is commemorated today, in a
book distributed to Roman Catholic parishes by the Ger
man Bishop's Conference before the pontiff's visit.
The criticism of Luther in the book by Roman Catholic
historian Remigius Baeumer angered some Protestant
leaders and threatened to mar a planned meeting between
the pope, who arrives Saturday, and Protestant represent
atives.
Luther, a 16th century Bible translator and leader of the
Protestant Reformation in Germany, simply rehashed be
liefs "as argued by most Catholic exegetes (Bible in
terpreters) of the Middle Ages," Baeumer writes in the
"Short History of the German Church."
Me implies Luther was partly responsible for starting
the bloody Peasant's War of 1524 and said even Luther's
friends were shocked by his marriage to a former nun.
Lutheran Church spokesman Dietrich Sattler, in an in
terview with W'estdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, said the
article "angered many Protestant leaders and had not
made members of the Lutheran Council eager to meet
with the pope."
But he said the appointment would be kept and the coun
cil would explain the importance of good ecumenical rela
tions to the pontiff.
