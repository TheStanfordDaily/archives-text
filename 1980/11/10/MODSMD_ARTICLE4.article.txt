# Dispute forseen in lame duck congress over tax cut
## 
### Associated Press 
Washington — Congress is return
ing to town this week for the first
lame-duck session in a presidential
election year in 32 years, giving Dem
ocrats thrown out of office the chance
for a last stand.
But whether they will be able to ac
complish anything before being inun
dated by the tidal wave sweeping Re
publicans into Congress in early Janu
ary is questionable.
Congress returns to town on
Wednesday in the first such post-elec
tion session since 1948, when Demo
cratic President Harry Truman, new
ly elected to a full four-year term,

summoned a reluctant "do-nothing"
GOP-controlled Congress back to
town.
But Congress recessed without act
ing on any of the legislation Truman
requested.
A test of whether the 1980 lame duck
Congress will be any more productive
may come on the proposed $39 billion
tax-cut bill being pushed by con
gressional Republicans — with the
blessings of President-elect Ronald
Reagan.
An immediate tax cut also has the
support of Senate Democratic Leader
Robert Byrd of West Virginia. But it is
opposed by the House Democratic

leadership and it appears doubtful it
will get the support of the tax-writing
House Ways and Means Committee.
Beyond this potential roadblock was
the prospect of a possible veto by
President Jimmy Carter of any Re
agan-style tax cut — a veto that proba
bly could be sustained by a Congress
that, at least for now, remains in Dem
ocratic hands.
Lame-duck Democrats may try to
push a number of pet projects, or hold
over legislation supported by the
Carter administration.
But Republicans have enough
parlimentary devices at their disposal
— especially in the Senate — to delay

action on any given bill for the rest of
the year.
And the Congress that returns in
early January will be a far different
body, with Repubicans holding 53-47
command of the Senate and Demo
crats clinging to a relatively narrow
243-192 margin of control in the House.
The difficulty of getting anything
controversial passed in the lame-duck
session has prompted a number of con
gressional leaders, including House
Speaker Thomas O'Neill, to suggest
tha' the session may be a short one —
involved mainly with bills needed to
keep the government functioninp
Congress this year still must pass 10

appropriations bills essential to allow
government agencies to meet payrolls
and pay their bills for fiscal 1981.
And Congress has yet to agree on an
overall budget for the federal govern
ment for fiscal 1981 — a budget Demo
crats earlier in 1980 hoped to balance
but which now will surely entail a mul
tibillion-dollar deficit.
The House Budget Committee be
gins work today on a final version of
that budget. Bickering between the
House and Sente and between Demo
crats and Republicans over where
budget cuts should be made has
stymied efforts so far to get a budget
approved.
