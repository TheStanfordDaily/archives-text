# Powerful quake shakes Humboldt County

From the Daily wire services
Eureka — While scientists compared data
yesterday about the weekend's terrifying
earthquake centering off Eureka's coast, resi
dents of the rattled region marvelled they had
escaped largely unscathed.
Life eased back to its quiet norm as after
shocks subsided in this sparsely populated
area about 250 miles north of San Francisco,
but anti-nuclear organizers worried fate
might not be so kind again.
Dislocated tombstones and a 300-foot hole in
a freeway overpass, which left six travellers
injured, were two reminders of the power
packed by the temblor, which rolled through
Humboldt County early Saturday morning.
The quake woke up people in San Francisco.
Scientists said it will be a few days before
they can determine a precise reading on the
Richter scale, a measure of a quake's intensi
ty. but estimates ranged from 6.6 to 7.1.
An earthquake registering 7.0 can do seri
ous damage. Experts agreed that the quake
was at least as powerful as one that killed 64
persons in the Los Angeles area in 1971.
Dr. Robert Uhrhammer, a seismologist at
the University of California's Seismographic
Station in Berkeley, said it was not im
mediately known which of the many active
faults in the area was involved.
By late Saturday, Uhrhammer had up
graded the intensity from 6.6 to 7.0. The larg
est of about a dozen aftershocks greater than
3.5 measured 5.2 and came at 8:10 p.m Satur
day
Geologists at the scene speculated damage

was light because the quake was believed to
have been unleashed miles beneath Pacific
Ocean floor. They placed the center of the
quake about 10 miles off the sparsely popu
lated coast.
'' Pacific Gas and Electric has all the power
problems squared away," said Eureka Fire
Capt. John McFarland. "Things are really un
der control."
A pickup truck and a car plunged through a
300-foot gap that opened in U.S. Highway 101
during the pre-dawn quake.
The truck driver was treated at a hospital
but the occupants of the car remained hospi
talized yesterday.
McP'arland said it was incredible that more
people weren't hurt.
"I went back and looked at the freeway in
daylight and was amazed." McFarland said.
Hospital officials reported that nine-year
old twins. Mark and Tom Mariani Jr.. were in
critical condition; their father, Tom. was in
stable condition; their mother. Marina, and
sister, Gina. were "doing very well."
Freeway travellers used a two-lane alter
nate route and California Highway Patrol of
ficials said that it might be "several months"
before the collapsed roadway is replaced.
Telephone lines were jammed yesterday as
earthquake anecdotes were exchanged, but a
Pacific Telephone spokesman said the quake
did not damage any equipment.
"I think we were really lucky," said Lisa
Pezzi, a dispatcher for the Eureka Police De
partment. "It was Mother Nature reminding
people."

Anti-nuclear forces who agreed called for
the permanent shutdown of the Humboldt Bay
power plant in nearby Salmon King.
"The earthquake shows higher (Richter
scale) ratings are possible in the area." said
an angry Carl Zichella of Redwood Alliance.
"We're just inviting tragedy" by keeping nu
clear fuel stored there.
He said that three active faults are located
less than a mile from the plant.
Pacific Gas and Electric officials could not
be reached to comment on the charge that the
plant could not withstand a quake on one of
those faults. The plant was shut down in 1976
after a critical government study, but the nu
clear fuel was permitted to be stored there,
pending a final decision.
Retired dairyman Jim Scalvini says he
knew Saturday's earthquake was a big one. It
blew part of an old. creaking seismograph
apart.
But the 60-year-old Scalvini, of Ferndale,
took the news calmly. "Whenever we have an
earthquake as powerful as this, the pins fly off
the machine," Scalvini said matter-of-factly.
The pins, he explained, are the wire arms
that trace the earthquake shocks on a drum of
recording paper.
The machine, donated to Ferndale by the
University of California in 1933 on the condi
tion that the town keep it working, showed a
small shock before the main quake hit at 2:28
a.m. PST Saturday morning.
"Then came the secondary shock." said
Scalvini. keeper of Ferndale's machine. "It

was very severe and lasted some seconds, but
the pins flew off."
He said the recordings made before the pins
scattered show that the quake was a major
tremor.
The earthquake upset supermarket shelves
in Kureka and neighboring communities when
it roared through Northern California, ac
cording to area shopkeepers.
Tim Dickinson, manager of the Trombetta
Liquor Warehouse in Areata, said he got to the
warehouse a half-hour after the quake. "The
power was off and 1 couldn't see anything —
all I could do was smell the liquor," he said
He discovered that 500 to 600 bottles of liq
uor had tumbled off their shelves leaving
pools of booze lying on the floor
The Areata Safeway Supermarket also re
ported losing "an awful lot of liquor and
wine," but the store opened at its regular time
Saturday morning
Fvo Fanucchi, who has lived in the Eureka
area for 60 years, remembered quakes that
struck the coastal community in 1935 and 1964.
"I believe the difference this time was that
it was a rolling kind of shake, not a 'jolting
one." said Fanucci. of Fields Landing. "If it
had been a jolting shake, we would have lost
almost all the houses around here." he said.
Fanucchis house was knocked several in
ches off its foundation.
"I'm still in shock," said Mary Brazil, an
elderly widow whose house next door was
thrown more than two feet from its founda
tion "1 didn't think the shaking was that bad.
until the last big jerk "
