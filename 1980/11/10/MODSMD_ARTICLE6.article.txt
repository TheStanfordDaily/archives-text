## Government needs tax revenues Colombia may legalize pot market 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bogota, Colombia — When
they talk about legalizing mari
juana in Colombia, they do not
mean letting someone light up a
joint in his living room with im
punity. They mean getting the
government involved in the
production and marketing of
marijuana.
The idea — and it is being se
riously debated — is to take over
a business that is estimated to
be worth at least $1.5 billion a
year.
The main proponent of legal
ization is the National Associa
tion of Financial Institutions, a
respected research organiza
tion that is sponsored by many
of Colombia's major banking
and industrial concerns.
Colombia is an important
marijuana source for smokers
in the United States who prize
the crop commonly known as
"Colombian gold." Because an
anti-drug effort in Mexico has
reduced the size of the mari
juana crop there, Colombia has
become an even more impor
tant source.
Hernando Ruiz, an official of
the Association of Financial In
stitutions, says that all efforts
to suppress the drug traffic have
been failures, and costly fail
ures at that.
Several factors
"There are several factors in
volved.-' he said in an interview.
"The cost of enforcement is
very high, we are losing impor
tant tax money, and there are
growing social, political and
moral costs as well."'
He said that the forces that
now control marijuana use
bribery and other forms of cor
ruption. Moreover, he went on.

marijuana contributes substan
tially to Colombia's inflation,
which is running at an annual
rate of 30 percent.
"Efforts to restrict the mon
ey supply have not worked." he
explained, "because the drug
business keeps pumping dollars
into the economy and the gov
ernment can't stop it."
He was talking about a quirk
in Colombian law that allows
anyone to trade dollars freely
for Colombian pesos at any
bank. As a result, the $1.5 billion
that drug sales pump into the
economy defeat the govern
ment's efforts to limit the
amount of money in circulation.
Fueling inflation
Furthermore, because the
Colombian drug magnates usu
ally spend their money in Col
ombia — financing construction
of office buildings and apart
ment houses as well as in other,
less dramatic ways — they are
financing a spending boom that
adds to inflation.
"Then there are the social
and political costs," Ruiz said.
"Corruption and bribery are se
rious problems here, as the
dealers seek to avoid
crackdowns. And now there is a
growing amount of violence con
nected with the drug trade."
Ruiz said that, according to
his research, there are about
60.000 families cultivating mari
juana on about 240.000 acres.
But processing and marketing,
he said, are controlled by about
200 people, known locally as
"the Mafia," although they
have little contact with the in
ternational crime syndicate of
that name.
Ruiz said the plan calls for
continued prosecution of the

people involved in processing
and marketing, and for the gov
ernment to take over that part
of the trade.
"Legalization would be car
ried out under very tight restric
tions," he said, adding that it
would also involve an effort to
get the growers to diversify, to
grow not only marijuana but
other crops as well.
Another — and controversial
— part of the plan calls for the
United States either to choke off
the importation of marijuana or
to legalize its use.
Until now. Ruiz said, the Col
ombian government has done
little to interfere with the
growers, most of whom are
peasants living in the Atlantic
coastal region. He said they
have grown marijuana because
the traffickers look after the
problems of getting it to market
— largely by plane to clan
destine airstrips.
"These people really don't
have any alternative," he said
Perhaps the most con
troversial part of the program is
the proposal that the United
States legalize the use of mari
juana.
"The problem is not really the
source." Ruiz said, "The prob
lem is the consumer. We don't
use the stuff, the United States
does. And America hasn't had
any more success in keeping
marijuana off the market than
we have had in stopping its prod
uction."
Ruiz thinks the peasant
growers would go along with le
galization. if for no other reason
than that they are now getting
only a tinv share of the profits.
According to Ruiz, the
peasant gets only about 1 cent of

ever dollar spent in the United
States for Colombian mari
juana; 19 cents goes to the Col
ombian trafficker, and 80 cents
stays in the United States.
Ruiz acknowledges that legal
ization is probably years away.
"Two years ago, nobody
would even talk about the prob
lem," he said. "Now, it is out in
the open. It is under serious con
sideration, because people are
realizing that drugs are a major
part of our economic and social
problems. Something has to be
done."
