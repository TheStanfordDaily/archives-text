# Afghanistan war grinds on outside the spotlight
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Whatever happened to "the most
serious threat to world peace since the second
world war?"
That was the way President Jimmy Carter, in
his State of the Union message to Congress last
January, described the Soviet invasion of Afghan
istan
In that same speech, the president pledged the
United Slates to defend the Persian Gulf against
any outside force, meaning the Soviet Union. A
buildup of U.S. forces in the region — already un
der way because of the Iran hostage crisis — was
speeded up Suddenly, there was talk of war in the
air. Presidential emissary Clark Clifford, during
a trip to New Delhi, warned gravely that the Rus
sians must know "that if part of their plan is to
move toward the Persian Gulf, that means war."
In recent weeks and months, however, Afghan
istan seems to have become the forgotten war, at
least in this country. In 90 minutes of debate two
weeks ago, neither Carter nor Republican
challenger Ronald Reagan mentioned it.
Since the Soviet invasion and occupation began
10 months ago. more than one million Afghan refu
gees have fled the fighting and their homeland.
Afghanistan's representative to the United Na
tions Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organiza
tion (UNESCO) startled delegates to a Belgrade
meeting last week by denouncing the Soviet ac
tions and then defecting to the West, claiming lat
er that more than a million other Afghans have
been killed, a figure that cannot be verified here
and which U.S. officials believe is exaggerated.
Nevertheless, the war faded from the headlines
and from administration rhetoric, overshadowed
by the election campaign, the new drama surroun
ding possible release of the U.S. hostages, and the
subsequent war between Iran and Iraq.
Behind the -scenes, Afghanistan has also been
overshadowed by a potentially more explosive sit
uation in Poland. At high levels throughout the
Carter administration, officials express the view
that the continuing clash between the Polish labor
movement and Communist Party authority, tak
ing place against the background of a seriously
troubled Polish economic situation, could lead to
Soviet military intervention — as a last resort —
in the year ahead.
Later this month, the U.N. General Assembly
in New York is expected to revive debate on Af
ghanistan, and the United States will once again

lend its backing to a resolution first offered last
January by 34 Moslem nations calling for the im
mediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Sovi
et troops.
The Soviets, however, clearly seem to be settl
ing in for both a long fight and a long stay in Af
ghanistan. and interviews with a number of ad
ministration officials here indicate there are no
new U.S. strategies shaping up to try and get them
out. Rather, the major effort seems to be aimed at
trying to preserve the existing strategy of grain,
technology and certain other trade restrictions
from being eroded by pressures in this country
and especially from allies in Western Europe and
Japan who have only reluctantly joined in some of
the curbs.
The problem facing the administration is that
the war in Afghanistan is far away and the public
seems to be losing interest in it.
Many administration officials also now private
ly acknowledge that the president's description of
the invasion as the gravest threat since World
War II was probably a bit overblown. Many Eu
ropean leaders at the time also questioned the
president's assessment, arguing that the Soviet
invasion of neighboring Afghanistan was most
likely aimed at heading off the overthrow of the
pro-Moscow regime in Kabul by a growing and
potentially volatile, anti-Soviet. Moslem-led in
surrection.
Yet, as one administration official puts it, even
if the Soviets went into Afghanistan because they
saw it as a threat along their border rather than as
a steppingstone to the Persian Gulf, "the fact is
that they are there. They have penetrated a buffer
region. They are physically nearer the Gulf with
85,000 troops. And if they come out of this with no
skin off their noses, they may indeed view this as a
precedent for future actions. It would be very
tempting."
Whether a decrease in outside interest and sup- |
port will have an effect on the rebels fighting the jj
Soviets in Afghanistan is another problem that J
will grow as the war drags on. Will the rebels at
some point conclude that further resistance is
fruitless? Though U.S. officials have frequently
given estimates of Soviet casualties in the fight
ing. it has b?en impossible to get an assessment of
rebel casualties. Most officials, however, believe
the rebel casualties are relatively light and that
they can fight on for some time.

tion (UNESCO) startled delegates to a Belgrade
meeting last week by denouncing the Soviet ac
tions and then defecting to the West, claiming lat
er that more than a million other Afghans have
been killed, a figure that cannot be verified here
and which U.S. officials believe is exaggerated.
Nevertheless, the war faded from the headlines
and from administration rhetoric, overshadowed
by the election campaign, the new drama surroun
ding possible release of the U.S. hostages, and the
subsequent war between Iran and Iraq.
Behind the -scenes, Afghanistan has also been
overshadowed by a potentially more explosive sit
uation in Poland. At high levels throughout the
Carter administration, officials express the view
that the continuing clash between the Polish labor
movement and Communist Party authority, tak
ing place against the background of a seriously
troubled Polish economic situation, could lead to
Soviet military intervention — as a last resort —
in the year ahead.
Later this month, the U.N. General Assembly
in New York is expected to revive debate on Af
ghanistan, and the United States will once again

lend its backing to a resolution first offered last
January by 34 Moslem nations calling for the im
mediate and unconditional withdrawal of all Sovi
et troops.
The Soviets, however, clearly seem to be settl
ing in for both a long fight and a long stay in Af
ghanistan. and interviews with a number of ad
ministration officials here indicate there are no
new U.S. strategies shaping up to try and get them
out. Rather, the major effort seems to be aimed at
trying to preserve the existing strategy of grain,
technology and certain other trade restrictions
from being eroded by pressures in this country
and especially from allies in Western Europe and
Japan who have only reluctantly joined in some of
the curbs.
The problem facing the administration is that
the war in Afghanistan is far away and the public
seems to be losing interest in it.
Many administration officials also now private
ly acknowledge that the president's description of
the invasion as the gravest threat since World
War II was probably a bit overblown. Many Eu
ropean leaders at the time also questioned the
president's assessment, arguing that the Soviet
invasion of neighboring Afghanistan was most
likely aimed at heading off the overthrow of the
pro-Moscow regime in Kabul by a growing and
potentially volatile, anti-Soviet. Moslem-led in
surrection.
Yet, as one administration official puts it, even
if the Soviets went into Afghanistan because they
saw it as a threat along their border rather than as
a steppingstone to the Persian Gulf, "the fact is
that they are there. They have penetrated a buffer
region. They are physically nearer the Gulf with
85,000 troops. And if they come out of this with no
skin off their noses, they may indeed view this as a
precedent for future actions. It would be very
tempting."
Whether a decrease in outside interest and sup- |
port will have an effect on the rebels fighting the jj
Soviets in Afghanistan is another problem that J
will grow as the war drags on. Will the rebels at
some point conclude that further resistance is
fruitless? Though U.S. officials have frequently
given estimates of Soviet casualties in the fight
ing. it has b?en impossible to get an assessment of
rebel casualties. Most officials, however, believe
the rebel casualties are relatively light and that
they can fight on for some time.
Washington — Whatever happened to "the most
serious threat to world peace since the second
world war?"
That was the way President Jimmy Carter, in
his State of the Union message to Congress last
January, described the Soviet invasion of Afghan
istan
In that same speech, the president pledged the
United Slates to defend the Persian Gulf against
any outside force, meaning the Soviet Union. A
buildup of U.S. forces in the region — already un
der way because of the Iran hostage crisis — was
speeded up Suddenly, there was talk of war in the
air. Presidential emissary Clark Clifford, during
a trip to New Delhi, warned gravely that the Rus
sians must know "that if part of their plan is to
move toward the Persian Gulf, that means war."
In recent weeks and months, however, Afghan
istan seems to have become the forgotten war, at
least in this country. In 90 minutes of debate two
weeks ago, neither Carter nor Republican
challenger Ronald Reagan mentioned it.
Since the Soviet invasion and occupation began
10 months ago. more than one million Afghan refu
gees have fled the fighting and their homeland.
