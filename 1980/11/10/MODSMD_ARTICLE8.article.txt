# SRI representative speaks on development
## Saudis face problems of rapid growth 
### Alya Al-Mufti 
Saudi Arabians are disturbed and pleased
at the same time by the rapid development,
said Elye Pitts, senior development plan
ner, Center for Urban and Regional Policy,
SRI International.
Speaking of the "Social and Cultural
Change in Saudi Arabia" at the Tuesday
luncheon series at Bechtel I-Center, Pitts
said the people he and other expatriates
meet in Saudi Arabia say life has improved
under the new system of developments,
while others contend that corruption and
lack of control exist because of the system.
Pitts said he saw a "transition and blend
ing of old and new in Saudi Arabia. It is a
country of abruptness and sharp contrast."
In some areas the extended family sys
tem is eroding, said Pitts. Young couples
are living alone in flats and young men live
alone in cities.
Other changes include dietary changes.
" Foodstuffs are arriving from all over the
world, even in the old suq (market)," he
said.
But in other cases tradition still exists.

"Traditional architecture is maintained,
but certain buildings reflect the lifestyle of
people living in them." Pitts also cited the
case where blocks of apartments built by a
German firm to cope with the housing short
age are still empty today because Saudi
Arabians are not used to living in such com
plexes.
In the early '70s "Saudi Arabia was a
Shangri-La for those studying the Middle
East," said Pitts, because it was difficult
for foreigners to get into the country.
After 1974 access to Saudi Arabia became
easier although expatriates do not often mix
with the Saudis. This is often because a
"large number of expatriates depend on the
entertainment facilities their companies
provide," said Pitts, as well as language
problems.
Pitts said an array of people are coming
to Saudi Arabia because of the wealth, from
the Arab world. Southeast Asia, Phillipines
and Korea. This can be seen clearly in the
sea port of Jidda, which underwent "tre
mendous urban development" in 1974.

However, the influx of wealth and migra
tion brought about problems.
"The ruling elite is committed to a policy
of social change." said Pitts. This is mainly
of how "to manage and control the change
within the ideal of Islam." This, he added, is
being exacerbated by movements of re
formist Islam, political instability, the
Palestinian issue and other power struggles
in the region.
The Saudi s major problem, according to
Pitts, is "how to maintain the rate of growth
and lessen its dependence on an expatriate
labor force."
Among the construction for building so-"
cial services, like hospitals, schools, univer
sities, "there is an attempt for national
parks and promoting internal tourism in the
southwest area," he said.
The diversity which exists in Saudi Ara-"
bia, from the red dust storms that envelope
the cities to the floods and deserts just out- -
side the cities, is also reflected in the com
position of the population, where people who
had come from other parts of the Islamic
world stayed.
