## Unusual election fooled pollsters 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The experts said it was too
close to call, but the voters — stubbornly ir
reverent as usual made it a landslide.
What happened this fall vividly demon
strates the limitations of polling as a means
of predicting election outcomes. The ex
perience of 1980 is a reminder that pollsters
can never predict exactly what distribution
of Americans will vote on Election Day. so
the polls can never be precisely right. Nor
can the pollsters overcome the
mathematical facts of life that govern their
trade, so they cannot eliminate the substan
tial. inevitable margins of error even if they
conduct perfect polls, which they seldom if
ever do.
This election also reaffirms the voters'
right to inflict surprises on all the experts, a
right they haven't exercised so dramati
cally since 1948. "Dewey Deemed Sure Win
ner Today." the headline in The Washing
ton Post trumpeted on Election Day in 1948.
This year most of the pollsters said "too
close to call." Both those mistakes reveal a
good deal about the fallibility of pollsters
and also the persistent unpredictably of
the American electorate.
However, the two candidates' private
pollsters, who continued to survey voters
through election eve. both did foresee the
final outcome accurately — The Washing
ton Post detei mined lhat fact last Tuesday,
before the votes were counted. Carter's
man. Pat Caddell of Cambridge Survey Re
search. predicted Monday night a 10-point
Reagan victory, right on the money. Rich
ard Wirthlin. Reagan's pollster, apparently
foresaw an eight- or nine-point margin.
The fact that Caddell and Wirthlin did get
it right will contribute to the myth that polls
really can be accurate predictors. In fact,
as the pollsters admit. when done with great
care by meticulous, intelligent people, polls
can produce results that probably come
close to predicting an election outcome in
some circumstances.

The basic statistical probabilities in poll
ing are seldom explained lp detail, but they
are important According to the laws of
mathematics, a perfectly designed, per
fectly executed poll of 1500 people ia com
mon size for a national survey) will reflect
true national sentiment on that issue at that
moment within a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percent 95 percent of the time.
With these mathematical facts in mind,
the performance of the pollsters in 1980
looks better than the way the pollsters
themselves and the news media described
their findings If the final Gallup poll, forex
ample, was accompanied by disclaimers
like the above, the 47-to-44 margin for Re
agan that Gallup predicted wouldn't look
bad. Given the margin of error. Gallup's 47-
to-44 result could have been 50 to 41. almost
exactly right Of course, if the margin of er
ror was stretched in the other direction,
that final Gallup Poll could have shown a 47-
to-44 Carter lead as well.
■ Polls are much better as explainers than
as predicters." according to Barry Sus
sman. The Washington Post's editor in
charge of polling.
As explainers the Post polls were reveal
ing; bv reinterviewing the same panels of
voters nationwide and in the big states at an
interval of several weeks, The Post polls
showed that 30 percent of the voters had
changed their minds during September and
October, and that 10 million still were un
decided less than a week before the election.
This last fact probably explains much of
the difficulty the pollsters had this year.
Another fact about this — or any — elec
tion that throws off the pollsters is the
makeup of the real electorate. Mitofsky at
CBS and Sussman at the Post, for example,
expected an electorate this time that would
be 52 or 53 percent women. In fact, the elec
torate that voted Tuesday consisted of 52 or
53 percent men, according to extensive poll
ing of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday.

Since men voted much more heavily for Re
agan than women, this change alone would
have added a point or two to Reagan's
strength in the final polls.
It the pollsters failed to explain in ad
vance what the voters would do Tuesday,
what does explain their behavior'.' It is prob
ably premature to suggest a definitive an
swer. but a few facts and a hunch or two
seem apt
First of all. the Reagan landslide was un
like any other in modern times The last two
landslide winners. Lyndon Johnson in 1964
and Richard Nixon in 1972, won more than6o
percent of the popular vote. Reagan won 51
percent Reagan piled up an electoral vote
landslide that made Jimmy Carter look like
Herbert Hoover, but he did so with the votes
of just 26.7 percent of the voting-age popu
lation of the United States — 51 percent of
the 52.3 percent turnout.
The exit polls also show that a lot of
Americans who ordinarily would have voted
— most of them for a Democrat in a "nor
mal" year — just stayed home, in 1976 the
electorate that voted was about 35 percent
independent. this year only a fourth of those
who voted called themselves independents.
This left a more partisan real electorate in a
year when about 90 percent of the Re
publicans voted for Reagan, but just 65
percent of the Democrats picked Carter
(This was another unexpected distortion in
the real electorate that helped throw off the
pollsters, too.) The fall-off in independent
voters who are generally more likely to be
ticket-splitters could help explain the unex
pected success of Republican candidates for
the Senate, too.
Second, people really did change their
minds a lot. The Post's resurvey of voters,
suggesting that 30 percent changed their
minds between September and the end of
October, is a good indicator. Also, high num
bers of voters stayed undecided far longer
than in other elections. Voters were genu
inely unsure.
