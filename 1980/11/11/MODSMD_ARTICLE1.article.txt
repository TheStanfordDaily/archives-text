# Arbiter vetoes pay in employee walkout

University officials do not have to
compensate five workers at the Cen
ter for Information Technology who
staged a walkout to protest building
and safety problems, according to ar
biter Armon Barsamian. a San Lean
dro attorney.
Barsamian ruled October 29 that the
workers are not entitled to back pay
for hours they did not work during the
walkout and subsequent litigation, be
cause they did not properly notify the
University of their intention to walk
out.
Otherwise, said Barsamian. the
workers were justified in their action.
The workers say they are pleased
with the tone of the ruling, because
they say it puts the blame on the Uni
versity tor forcing employees to work
in unsafe conditions.
Nevertheless, the state Labor Com
mission. which last May ruled th.it the
University had to pay the workers, has
tiled suit against the University on
behalf of four of the workers for back
pay. The fifth protester, a CETA em
ployee. has already been compensated
by the federal government.
"We're really happy with the de

cision. actually.'' said Bob Britton.
former president of the United Stan
ford Employees < USE > and one of the
workers who walked out
The greatest thing." he added, "is
that a building doesn't have to be un
safe for us to walk out now. As long as
we're acting in good faith and we real
ly believe it is unsafe, we won't be dis
ciplined."
University satisfied
Associate University Counsel Ross
Campbell said he is also "basically
quite happy" with the arbiter's de
cision for "a variety of reasons, the
most important of which is the in
terpretation of the contract and what
it requires in terms of safety prob
lems."
The original incident occurred June
2ti. 1979. when the workers walked off
the job at the newly constructed For
syth Building to protest what they
called poor working conditions.
At a hearing at the San Jose office of
the Division of Labor Standards En
forcement. under the state Depart
ment of Industrial Relations, the La
bor Commission told the University to
compensate the employees.

Workers at the Forsyth building walked out in June 1979 to protest unsafe work
ing conditions, caused by the building not being completedas seen here.
The University refused, claiming
th.it the Forsyth Building was safe and
that the workers had walked out
without justification.
Hazards cited
But Britton insisted the building
was dangerous, citing non-operative
air-conditioners, missing floor tiles,
leaking water coolers and the absence
of tire alarms or sprinklers.
After the walkout, said Britton. it
was discovered that the University
had not met certain fire standards and
thus had no permit to allow workers in
the building.
Britton was unable to get the Uni
versity to pay him and the other work
ers through the arbitration process, he
said, because of a "technical error."
' There were a couple people we
didn't get to testify that should have."
he explained, "but since we're going
to court on the matter, it's okay."
Both sides confident
Because of the favorable arbi
tration and the Labor Commission's
backing. Britton says he is "quite con
fident" he will win in court.
Campbell, however, foresees a vic
tory for the University.
"I remain confident that we'll pre
vail on it,"he said. The workers, he in
sisted. still have no proof that there
was any real hazard which would
force them to walk out on the job.
