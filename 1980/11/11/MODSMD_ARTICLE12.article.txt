someone else, said .loan Baez

International Law Society and
Humanitas International.
Macßride. recipient of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1974. told
the audience of about 1(H) that
the whole human rights issue
came to the forefront" after
the atrocities of World War II
were made public.
The Holocaust was a colos
sal indication of the breakdown
of morality in the world. It was
the worst perjod in the history of
mankind." he stated.
Macßride gave a brief history
of the human rights movement
from post World War II to the
present, calling the adoption of

Human Rights by the United
Nations in 1948. "the most im
portant human rights incident
that had been adopted."
Covenant needed
He expressed skepticism at
the declaration's effectiveness,
saying. "It is merely a declara
tion of intentions. We must
translate principles into binding
legal covenants.*' Macßride
criticized the United States for
its failure to ratify the declara
tion. and urged the public to
pressure the administration to
expedite ratification.
Ninh and Reque shared per
sonal accounts of the condition
of human rights in their respec
tive countries.
Ninh. a pediatric surgeon,
was one of the "boat people"
who fled Indochina after escap
ing from prison in Vietnam. He
contested several allegations
made bv the government in Ha
noi regarding the massive ex
odus of Vietnamese and ethnic
Chinese from that country.
Voicing protest against the gov
ernment which, he claimed,
"created an atmosphere of in
security and hopelessness that
drove Vietnamese, at all costs,
from their homeland. Ninh
contradicted the government's
claim that severe food short
ages and"the lure of American
life drove these people from
their country.
"They're not leaving because
of economic pressure or the lure
of an American society for
which they know nothing about.
Something else pushes them to
gamble their lives."
Ninh revealed that the Viet
namese government often
charges people for the "deathly
privilege" of passage as a boat

person, only to sabotage the
vessel He estimated that the
government has earned hun
dreds of millions of dollars"
from this practice
Violations witnessed
Ninh himself left on a boat al
ter escaping from a concent ra
tion camp where he witnessed a
number ol inhuman conditions
including men paralyzed from
vitamin deficiencies, deaths
due to severe beatings, humans
locked in boxes and exposed to
the sun and people crippled
from being forced to remove
mines with their bare hands
without mine detectors."
Ninh accused the government
of unconscionable violations of
human rights describing com
mon practices of "preventive
detention, unhuman detention
and detention without trial."
saying that all Vietnamese ex
pect opposition, hardship, bit
terness and fear."
Human rights violations
should always be condemned,
never excused for the sake of
doctrine whether that be cap
italism. communism or any oth
er ism." he said
Reque. former executive sec
retary of the Inter-American
Commission on Human Rights,
spoke on the current conditions
in the Latin American coun
tries. Reque emphasized that
there was ample machinery"
existing in Latin America to en
force the protection of human
rights but that "paper guaran
tees nothing He contended
that there has been a "decay in
the 19705" with political as
sassinations. kidnapping and
torture occuring in epidemic
proportions.
"In almost all of the countries
under military or authoritarian
governments, violations of hu
man rights is common — and

flourishing, he said
Torture has become an in
stitution. he stated, mention
ing electric shock and
cigarette burning.'" as common
methods ot torture.
Pessimism expressed
Ke<)ue said that the increas
ing number ot incidents ot the
disappearance ot dissidents was
another violation employed by
military governments against
political opponents Reque ex
pressed pessimism at the hope
ot change saving that the in
ternational investigatory com
mittees spend too much time on
the reports without taking any
action
The final panelist. Michael
Buckley, vehemently affirmed
that individuals must unite for
the common good of ensuring
universal human rights.
"The urgent problem before
us is not the relationship of theo
ry to tact, but of reason to ac
tion The central issue is not
what are human rights, but
what should we do. not simply a
continual reinterpretation of
the world the point is for us to
change it." said Buckley, an as
sociate professor at the .Jesuit
School of Theology at Berkeley.
Buckley attacked the attitude
that allows "such tales of hor
ror to continue. "If our charac
ter is essentially individualistic
in its sensibilities, there is no
toundation for hope that the mi
sery of those who suffer
throughout the world will be
very much changed . indif
ference to the misery of others
is obtained only through block
ing that kind of self-transcen
dence that makes me human,
he said
Buckley encouraged the Stan
ford community to recognize
that we are "already involved in
the lives of others whom we do
not see and will never meet."

Macßride. recipient of the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1974. told
the audience of about 1(H) that
the whole human rights issue
came to the forefront" after
the atrocities of World War II
were made public.
The Holocaust was a colos
sal indication of the breakdown
of morality in the world. It was
the worst perjod in the history of
mankind." he stated.
Macßride gave a brief history
of the human rights movement
from post World War II to the
present, calling the adoption of

claim that severe food short
ages and"the lure of American
life drove these people from
their country.
"They're not leaving because
of economic pressure or the lure
of an American society for
which they know nothing about.
