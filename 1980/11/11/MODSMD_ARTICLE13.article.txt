## Make predictions fair 
### 
Last week's early concession by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and the clarity of the
outcome two hours before polls closed in
the West deterred many potential voters
from casting their ballots. One of the con
clusions is that political technology and
computation are now so efficient that
some reform is needed in order to main
tain a modicum of fairness on election
day.
Outlawing polls or forcing networks to
wait until all votes are cast before they be
gin to predict outcomes is not only un
constitutional. it is unfair. The poll takers
who dominate the election months and the
networks who show such computer effi
ciency are only doing their jobs.
However, simultaneous poll closings —
at least for the continental United States
is an idea that is long-overdue. Under

this system, no part of the country could
unduly influence the remainder of the na
tion Action on such an idea should be a
high priority in the lame-duck Congress, if
for no other reason than that many
Western legislators were affected by the
early results last week
Another possible solution would be to re
quire election commissioners to withhold
preliminary returns until the polls have
closed throughout the nation
But many of those who are clamoring
for such reform are also the ones who
stayed away from the polls after the presi
dential outcome was .projected. They
must share in the responsibility for last
week's results. The other races were
crucial: the actions of the new Congress
may prove that painfully obvious.
