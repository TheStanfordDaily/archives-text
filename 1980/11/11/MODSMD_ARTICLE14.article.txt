## No turning back to blind obedience 
### 
Robert Greenberg's proposal
to annex Saudi Arabia as an
energy colony ("An American
takeover would be best." Daily,
Oct 23) read like another
absurd rightwing solution to our
complex national energy prob
lem
Like anti-abortion arguments
and the Laffer Curve, it offered
up a black-and-white fantasy
world for us. With only a short,
surgical invasion or. perhaps, a
well-orchestrated CIA coup (a
la overthrow of Iran's
Mossadegh by Kermit Roo
sevelt in 1953). it claimed we
could achieve not only peace
and security for the U.S., but
also increased happiness for all
those poor Saudis who don't
have the right to two corporate
senators and a hot-tub in every
back yard.
It was funny — like watching
Reefer Madness, it evoked an
ancient, immature national
mentality just far enough in our
past to sigh about or chuckle at
comfortably. Oh well. I thought,
people have now lived through a
McCarthy era. an arms race, a
Vietnam war. an Iranian revolu
tion and two recessions. Surely
they will dismiss these ideas as
just the frivolous vagaries of the
ultra-right.
Open eyes
Three weeks and a presiden
tial election later, my eyes have
been opened. You mean — the
rest of the country believes that
stuff? You mean — this fan
tastic world-view will be na
tional policy for the next four
years'? Like a hot-tubber whose
plug has suddenly been pulled. I
feel shocked, very cold, and
very alone.
I must be fair — Reagan has
not (yet) called for military in
tervention in Saudi Arabia. So
far (that is, in the last four
years), the list extends only to
Iran. Nicaragua. El Salvador.
Afghanistan. Angola and Cuba.
Like a re-run of the I Love
Lucy show, his calls for re
newed American assertiveness
based on some divine national
heritage and a born-again sense
of pride and honor are woefully
outdated. That these calls ori
ginated when they did — in a
dominant, arrogant and vic
torious post-war era—is under
standable. That they be invoked
now. after the decline of Ameri
can economic and military
power around the world, instead
of a progressive and peace
fostering policy is un
forgivable and unbelievable.
Right now. it is the people of

the Third World who must feel
cold and alone. No one polled the
2000 million of the world about
their choice for president,
though nearly every person,
place and thing in this country
was hit up for an opinion.
Yet it is they as much as (or
more than i we who are affected
by the direction this country
takes in the next four years, and
deserve the right to influence
that direction America, by con
suming 30 percent of the world's
energy and 40 percent of its oth
er natural resources, is the
single most important force in
shaping the planet's future and
the nature of its development.
If America abandoned its nu
clear energy and weapons pro
grams and actively renounced
its role in nuclear proliferation,
this sad affair would cease. If
America adopted a strict policy
of increased efficiency and con
servation, it would release
much of the pressure on global
markets that has been the
source of recent conflict. If the
resources liberated by these
acts were devoted to salvaging
the poorest nations from the
devastation they are presently
undergoing and assisting others
in building towards self-re
liance and stability, not only
would much tragedy be averted,
but the cause of peace would be
advanced.
Foreign policy
But Reagan will do none of
these things. Reagan will only
increase military expenditures
and. by simultaneously cutting
taxes and balancing the budget
i ha). sacrifice even those social
programs that benefit the less
fortunate in this country.
Reagan will prop up foreign
dictators regardless of their
popularity or tactics, so long as
they preserve favorable condi
tions for exploitation of their
countries' resources by foreign
capital. Already he has sent an
emissary to the dictator of Ar
gentina to apologize for the dis
respect this nation displayed un
der the Carter regime.
And. if need be. Re-Run Ron
will engage troops in the in
evitable Vietnams, Irans and
Nicaraguas that will occur in
the next four years as more na
tions strive for self-determina
tion. He will turn back the clock
to a time of false promises and
pretentions on the part of this
country, of manifest destiny and
of national self-righteousness.
And, perhaps, is his adven
turism. he will prompt a head
long and potentially

cataclysmic clash between the
two superpowers.
He will do these things if he is
not challenged by a cogent. prin
cipled and alert opposition will
ing to devote entire evenings,
years or careers to demonstrat
ing and advancing alternative
directions for the future. Ul
timately. the responsibility
rests with the individual, who
must always decide which is the
best course of action to follow.
Government policies are
enacted onlv to the extent that

people as individuals go along
with them. In the next four
years, each of us will more than
ever have to make basic person
al decisions about how to re
spond to the choices and situ
ations with which we are faced.
May the '80s not witness a re
vival of the naive and unques
tioning obedience of the '50s. for
it is 30 years later and there's no
turning back for the rest of the
world.

If America abandoned its nu
clear energy and weapons pro

its role in nuclear proliferation,
this sad affair would cease. If
America adopted a strict policy
of increased efficiency and con

much of the pressure on global
markets that has been the
source of recent conflict. If the
resources liberated by these
acts were devoted to salvaging
the poorest nations from the
devastation they are presently

would much tragedy be averted,

Foreign policy
But Reagan will do none of
these things. Reagan will only
increase military expenditures
and. by simultaneously cutting
taxes and balancing the budget
i ha). sacrifice even those social
programs that benefit the less
fortunate in this country.
Reagan will prop up foreign
dictators regardless of their
popularity or tactics, so long as
they preserve favorable condi
tions for exploitation of their
countries' resources by foreign
capital. Already he has sent an
emissary to the dictator of Ar
gentina to apologize for the dis
respect this nation displayed un
der the Carter regime.
And. if need be. Re-Run Ron
will engage troops in the in
evitable Vietnams, Irans and
Nicaraguas that will occur in
the next four years as more na
tions strive for self-determina
tion. He will turn back the clock
to a time of false promises and
pretentions on the part of this
country, of manifest destiny and
of national self-righteousness.
And, perhaps, is his adven
turism. he will prompt a head
long and potentially

cataclysmic clash between the
two superpowers.
He will do these things if he is
not challenged by a cogent. prin
cipled and alert opposition will
ing to devote entire evenings,
years or careers to demonstrat
ing and advancing alternative
directions for the future. Ul
timately. the responsibility
rests with the individual, who
must always decide which is the
best course of action to follow.
Government policies are
enacted onlv to the extent that

people as individuals go along
with them. In the next four
years, each of us will more than
ever have to make basic person
al decisions about how to re
spond to the choices and situ
ations with which we are faced.
May the '80s not witness a re
vival of the naive and unques

it is 30 years later and there's no

Robert Greenberg's proposal
to annex Saudi Arabia as an
energy colony ("An American
takeover would be best." Daily,
Oct 23) read like another
absurd rightwing solution to our
complex national energy prob
lem
Like anti-abortion arguments
and the Laffer Curve, it offered
up a black-and-white fantasy
world for us. With only a short,
surgical invasion or. perhaps, a
well-orchestrated CIA coup (a
la overthrow of Iran's
Mossadegh by Kermit Roo
sevelt in 1953). it claimed we
could achieve not only peace
and security for the U.S., but
also increased happiness for all
those poor Saudis who don't
have the right to two corporate
senators and a hot-tub in every
back yard.
It was funny — like watching
Reefer Madness, it evoked an
ancient, immature national
mentality just far enough in our
past to sigh about or chuckle at
comfortably. Oh well. I thought,
people have now lived through a
McCarthy era. an arms race, a
Vietnam war. an Iranian revolu
tion and two recessions. Surely
they will dismiss these ideas as
just the frivolous vagaries of the
ultra-right.
Open eyes
Three weeks and a presiden
tial election later, my eyes have
been opened. You mean — the
rest of the country believes that
stuff? You mean — this fan
tastic world-view will be na
tional policy for the next four
years'? Like a hot-tubber whose
plug has suddenly been pulled. I
feel shocked, very cold, and
very alone.
I must be fair — Reagan has
not (yet) called for military in
tervention in Saudi Arabia. So
far (that is, in the last four
years), the list extends only to
Iran. Nicaragua. El Salvador.
Afghanistan. Angola and Cuba.
Like a re-run of the I Love
Lucy show, his calls for re
newed American assertiveness
based on some divine national
heritage and a born-again sense
of pride and honor are woefully
outdated. That these calls ori
ginated when they did — in a
dominant, arrogant and vic
torious post-war era—is under
standable. That they be invoked
now. after the decline of Ameri
can economic and military
power around the world, instead
of a progressive and peace
fostering policy is un
forgivable and unbelievable.
Right now. it is the people of

the Third World who must feel
cold and alone. No one polled the
2000 million of the world about
their choice for president,
though nearly every person,
place and thing in this country
was hit up for an opinion.
Yet it is they as much as (or
more than i we who are affected
by the direction this country
takes in the next four years, and
deserve the right to influence
that direction America, by con
suming 30 percent of the world's
energy and 40 percent of its oth
er natural resources, is the

shaping the planet's future and
the nature of its development.
