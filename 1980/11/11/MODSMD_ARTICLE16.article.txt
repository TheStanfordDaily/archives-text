# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS

I hadn't seen him since high
school and he was silent
throughout our poll sci section
But his eyes indicated potential
membership. His pupils were
black basketballs which would
bounce madly from one face to
the next every 10 minutes or so
as if he had to make sure he
was doing his job right Over his
shoulder. I saw that his notepad
was smattered with non se
(|uitur subject headings which

failed to approximate the TA's
outline.
We had swum against each
other as seniors so we slid into a
casual conversation after class.
By the time we left Cubberley I
knew that he didn't feel dedi
cated enough to go out for the
team again this year and was
having second thoughts about
his econ major Definitely about
to join our ranks.
Although he knew where I
lived, we were well past Dink
when he said. "You don't have
to walk to this side of campus 1
don't want to goof you up
Obviously ready for some ac
climation. "Don't worry. I'm
perpetually goofed up. That sec
t ion sure was confusing. Can you
make any sense out of the Cold
War? I thought I knew more
before I took the class. "
"Well. I'm pretty familiar
with the material but what con
fuses me is the way everyone in
the class talks so sure of
himself. Man. I never under
stand how everyone around here
always seems so sure of
himself."
Charter member! Leadership
material!

I'd be the last to contradict
the promising image of Ap
pruat'hinn Stanford Our little
Farm is a marvelous "Build
your-own-future" erector set
And no feeling is more assuring
than the belief that you're mov
ing closer to the goal of what you
want to be.
However, some of us can't
read the blueprints for our per
sonal tomorrows. After awhile,
we feel \u: i ve're not ready for
Tinker Toys. This is a lonely
place to be aimless.
Few come to school with a
clear scale model of their
future, but after being super
achievers in high school, most
students quickly learn to pre
tend they're making progress.
I'm amazed by the air of con
tentment in which students as
semble their careers. They
calmly accept Sunday after
noons at Meyer and learn easily
to drink coffee during finals
week.
There exist, however, a few
shiftless creatures who aren't
so adaptable. Our freshman
Knglish papers are marked "Off
Topic" and we turn in physics
problems from the wrong
chapter. We can't comprehend

the use of a "study break.'' feel
like reading on the night of the
house party and sleep through
band rallies.
Many among the aimless
thrive on their abnormality.
Musicians, poets and
philosophers flourish while
psilocvbin explorers find the
most remote corners of the
galaxy. Thanks to the lenient
stopping out policy, others be
come professional free spirits
and ride llamas in the Andes.
Hut for some meandering ma
jors. irrelevance only feeds on
itself and becomes paralyzing.
Our favorite evening pastimes
include wandering through the
Quad glaring at buildings. Dur
ing winter quarter, we are often
found in the vicinity of the Dish
talking to cows.
1 therefore propose the crea
tion of yet another acrovnm —
S*F*L*A*T*S — Society of the
Professionally Lost At Stan
lord Let us pool our efforts that
we may walk proudly in circles.
Our meetings will be held on a
date to be decided and every so
often thereafter.
