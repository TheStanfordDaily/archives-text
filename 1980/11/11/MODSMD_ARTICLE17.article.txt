## Arms race threatens national security 
### 
In his two articles urging re
jection of SALT II and a massive
buildup of U.S. nuclear arma
ments. Scott Richter demon
strates a dangerous myopia re
garding "national security.'
Richter's polemic naively as
sumes that Soviet "nuclear
blackmail'' is the only signifi
cant threat to American secur
ity and ignores that his milita
ristic policies might themselves
pose three larger threats to "na
tional security" — accidental
nuclear war. economic hardship
and horizontal weapons pro
liferation
Richter's fears of the USSR
becoming a nuclear Napoleon
are rooted in its "throw-weight
advantage" — its 6000 to 9000
megatons to the U.S.'s 3000 to
6000 megatons. He fails to un
derstand. however, that this dis
parity is far more significant on
paper than in reality. Consider
that a single one-megaton air
burst could pulverize a 50
square mile area (Washington,
D C. size), incinerate 100 square
miles, inflict second-degree
burns over 250 square miles, and
disperse assuredly lethal doses
of fallout over 600 to 1000 square
miles.
An additional 4000 square
miles would receive significant
radioactive contamination,
causing enormous numbers of
cancers, birth defects, and oth
er radiation diseases — crowd
ing hospitals, asylums, soup
lines, prisons and cemetaries

for decades to come.
Richter's numbers obfuscate
the harsh reality that, if even
less than one percent of our
"throw-weight" survived a So
viet first strike, we could still
inflict unparalleled destruction
upon the USSR. To imply other
wise. Richter concocts a Soviet
first strike that would knock out
90 percent of our land missiles.
50 percent of our submarines,
and "a good share" of our B-52
bombers. He then simplistically
asserts that our remaining war
head would "not offer an accep
table response."
He concedes that we could
still destroy "some" Soviet
cities but deems this "no threat
to the Soviets at all." No threat?
Henry Kendall of MIT has
shown that in even a worse case,
in which the Soviets destroyed
93 percent of our land missiles
and all of our bombers and sub
marines. remaining U.S. forces
could still destroy the 22 largest
Soviet cities and their 32 million
inhabitants.
Suggestions that the Soviets
could endure such "limited"
U.S. retaliation tend to over
estimate the efficacy of their
civil defense, ignore the vulner
able concentration of the Soviet
population and industry, and un
derestimate long-term radio
logical. climatic, ecological and
agricultural impacts. How, for
example, would the USSR feed
itself should both its own and its
principal supplier's farmlands

be radioactivelv ruined''
Only in Richter's psychotic
fantasies can such un
precedented destruction be de
emed "no threat." A "mere 10
million deaths would be the
equivalent of 147,000 Johnstown
floods. 61.000 Southgate night
club fires. 17,000 Canary Island
air crashes, or 11.000
Jonestowns.
Three Mile Island killed vir
tually no one and yet
traumatized over tens of
thousands. Mt. St. Helens
erupted in a remote, moun
tainous area. 60 miles from the
nearest major population cen
ter. and yet paralyzed much of
the Pacific Northwest — psy
chologically as well as physi
cally. To think that a society
stricken with St. Helens vol
canoes erupting downtown in its
22 largest cities not only could
carry on "as usual" but also
could capture a global empire is
sheer madness.
Richter's recommendations,
however, are not only un
justified but also promise to
rend our national security in
three significant ways. First,
the complexity of overseeing a
large number of weapons sug
gests that the growth of weap
ons stockpiles enhances the pos
sibilities of bomb thefts or ac
cidental firings. Each year, the
military removes roughly 5000
nuclear weapons personnel for
alcoholism, drug addiction and
mental illness. The U.S. mili

t arv has also admitted to 60 ma
jor major accidents involving
both nuclear weapons and
launchers, the most recent of
which nearly gave Arkansas a
lunar-sized crater. As our stock
piles grow, so does the potential
for human fallibility to wreak
catastrophe. That false alarms
in the U.S. "early warning sys
tem nearly triggered nuclear
war three times this year sug
gests that the superpowers al
ready may have too many weap
ons for their own good.
Economic consequences
A second way a vigorous arms
race induces national insecurity
is in its economic consequences.
The USSR domestic economy
continues to deteriorate as it di
verts resources to its burgeon
ing military sector. Many in the
U.S. are also realizing that nu
clear weapons expenditures are
inflationary, job-destroying,
trade-disrupting and prod
uctivity-reducing.
U.S. defense industries are
plagued by chronic inefficiency,
poor competition among firms,
large cost overruns, and astoun
ding overheads. Military expen
ditures produce explosive
widgets of no welfare to the
American consumer. Each fam
ily should consider whether it
would perhaps prefer spending
the $19,400 it will surrender to
the military over the next five
years on other, more productive
goods and services.
The Council on Economic

Priorities has demonstrated
that spending the projected $34
billion cost of the MX missile in
stead on energy-saving meas
ures could cut imports 23 to 54
percent, reduce the trade defi
cit. stabilize the dollar, and
create 115.000 new jobs. Only by
defining "national security" in
Russophobic terms can Richter
evade the broader needs of U.S.
security.
A third consequence of
Richter's repudiation of SALT
II is the spread of nuclear weap
ons. Richter seems to think that
the USSR and U.S. are the only
countries in the world. He ig
nores that virtually every one of
the other hundred-plus nations
now has the technical capability
to build nuclear weapons.
The one barrier to their
"going nuclear" is the 1968 Nu
clear Non-I ruliferation Treaty
(NPT), in which nations not
possessing nuclear weapons
bound themselves not to obtain
them in exchange for a promise
by the nuclear weapons states to
disarm. Two months ago. at the
Second NPT Review Con
ference. many nonnuclear na
tions castigated the super
powers for not disarming and
spoke openly of disbanding the
treaty. U.S. rejection of SALT II
will certainly hasten the break
down of the NPT. Richter's de
termination to "insure strategic
stability" against Soviet
"blackmail" will spawn the
global chaos of a "nuclear
armed crowd."
Richter's blind spots will un
doubtedly inhere in our new
president's foreign policy. As
we adopt this reactionary, irra
tional vision of national secur
ity. we should remind ourselves
just Whose security will be
enhanced. Shortly after the So
viet invasion of Afghanistan,
only Business Week could re
joice in "the new cold war econ
omy." With his Stanford
JD/MBA degree, perhaps
Richter. too, can reap the prof
its of an invigorated arms race.
But in his small gains lies the
world's permanent loss.
