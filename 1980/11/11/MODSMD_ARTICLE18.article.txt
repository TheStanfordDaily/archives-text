Veiled error
I was shocked to note that a
student attending the Stanford
in-Paris program doesn't know
who Simone Veil is (Paris pro
tester can never forget. Daily,
Oct. 17). And 1 doubt that any
Frenchman, carrying a knife or
not. would say : "That's Simone
Veil He has numbers on his
arm . . ." simply because "Si
mone" couldn't be but a wom
an's name In fact I am not sure
that your correspondent was
even present at the place where
"Veil was greeted with sullen
silence as he appealed to the
crowd "
Veil is undoubtedly the most
prominent woman in French
politics. She has been minister
of health in Barre's cabinet until
she became president of the Eu
ropean Parliament, a position
which seems to be considered by
the author of the report < a wom
an' I as prima facie evidence
that Veil is a man.
it is also unfortunate that the
editor who reviewed Hajda's
letter could not spot anything
wrong with it.

Subtle wisdom
I thoroughly enjoyed your
front page coverage of the
World in Crisis seminar (I)aily,
Oct. 13) which I attended last
week I especially appreciated
the imaginative way in which
the article embodied the pro
ceedings. and captured the true
spirit of the Hoover Institution's
(and the Stanford community's)
academic interest in world af

fairs. It took tremendous
creative insight to convey sym
bolically the sexist way Pro
fessor Softer (the only woman
on a seven person panel > was in
sulted and later ignored by her
scholastic fellows — by leaving
her out of your account com
pletely!
How cunning it was to bury
your readers with the trivial
ideas of speakers who couldn't
see beyond their own ideol
ogies; to bring out the way that
those men have buried them
selves in conservativism and
pessimism And then to ignore
Prof. Softer's attempts to tran
scend closeminded academic
cliches, and address the issues
frankly and compassionately:
what a brilliant journalistic
comment on America's interna
tional perspective and foreign
policy! I for one will have to
start reading the Daily more
carefully, as up until now I've
been oblivious to the subtle wis
dom it contains.

Math critic
Professor Ralph Phillips has
a strange concept of teaching.
He seems to view instructors as
being n priori good or bad. re
gardless of the views of those
being taught. How can he
divorce the notion of "teacher"
from that of "student"? The ef
fectiveness of an instructor, by
definition, is determined by how
well he or she instructs, not bv
some abstract criteria.
Rather than accepting con
structive student criticism and
working to improve teaching
quality, as I believe many de

partments have. Phillips in
stead lashes out at student opin
ion of him and his department —
which he admits is "fairly low."
His attitude reminds me of
the simplistic response toward
student criticism of the then
proposed Albers' Wall, by cer
tain art authorities — basically,
"the students don't know what's
good for them." It seems as
though our ability to form sen
sible opinions and make rational
judgements is to be found some
where in the post-Stanford void.
Manv of the students I've

talked to about our math depart
ment have expressed dis
satisfaction with their Stanford
math education Granted. I may
not be hearing from the less vo
cal. more enthusiastic students,
as f'rof. Karlin pointed out in
the article. But the amount of
responsible student criticism of
Stanford's math department de
mands a response that is much
more rational, understanding
and constructive.
