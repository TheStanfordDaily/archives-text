### 
Five advisers to oversee power transfer

From the Uailv wire services
Washington— President-elect
Ronald Reagan's advisers have
divided the government into five
broad functional areas, and are about
to name coordinators to oversee the
transfer of power in each, aides said
yesterday. These coordinators will
provide liaison between the Reagan
hierarchy and small working teams to
be placed in all departments and agen
cies in the executive branch.
Sources in the Reagan camp say
that Elizabeth Dole, a former Federal
trade commissioner and the wife of
Sen Robert Dole (R-Kan. i would be
coordinator for "human resources."
Loren Smith, an associate professor of
constitutional law at Widner Univer
sity and the chief house counsel of the
Reagan campaign committee, will co
ordinate teams working on federal le
gal and regulatory agencies.
Richard Fairbanks, a former as
sociate director of the domestic coun
cil in the Nixon White House, will be
coordinator for resources and de
velopment, an area that encompasses
the Departments of Energy. Agricul
ture and Interior. Economic affairs,
both domestic and international, will
be coordinated by Stanley Anderson, a
Washington lawyer who is a deputy to
Reagan politcai aide William Tim
mons. David Abshire. former assis
tant secretary of state during the Nix
on administration, will coordinate ef-

forts of three teams in the national se
curity area at the Departments of
State and Defense and the Central In
telligence Agency.
Key appointments
Though a number of the so-called
"captains'' of the special working
teams that will actually move into
these departments have not yet been
named, sources say that two key ap
pointments in the national security
area are firm.
William Van Cleave, a former Pen
tagon official who served as Reagan's
senior defense adviser during the
campaign, will head the team that will
soon move into the Pentagon.
Robert Neumann, former am
bassador to Afghanistan and Jordan
and currently at Georgetown Univer
sity's Center for Strategic and In
ternational Studies, will head the
State Department working team.
Though no captain has been named
for the CIA team, sources say Reagan
campaign director William Casey is
certain to play a major role in the
workings of this group. Casey, who
was a European intelligence special
ist in the World War II Office of
Strategic Services, is also said to be a
leading possibility as CIA director in
the new administration.
Security adviser
Numerous Reagan advisers say
that, while no final decision has been
made by Reagan, they believe that

Richard Allen, the long-time senior
foreign policy adviser to the presi
dent-elect. will in fact be named to the
key post of national security adviser in
the White House That post is current
ly held bv Carter aide Zbigniew
Brzezinski and was formerly held by
Nixon aide Henry Kissinger
Allen resigned in the final days of
the election campaign after a news
paper article suggested that he had
used past government positions for
private gain. But Reagan said recent
ly that those charges had been looked
into, by his own staff and other news
papers. and no evidence of wrong
doing had been found At the same
time. Reagan gave a strong vote of
confidence to Allen.
Sources say that official public an
nouncement of the five coordinating
positions is expected this week. These
officials stress that the five coordi
nators will not necessarily wind up
with positions in a Reagan adminis
tration after the January 20. 1981, in
auguration.
These coordinators, according to
Reagan s aides, will serve as a funnel
through which detailed information
developed by the working teams will
be passed on to a newly created in

terim office of executive branch man
agement. That office is to be run by
Timmons. who is also deputy director
of the top-level Fieagan transition
team named by Reagan last Thurs
day. and it will play the central role in
managing the changing of the guard.
In terms of the practical effect on
the bureaucracy, however, the key
role is apt to be played by the smail
working teams that go into each de
partment. Aside from a team captain,
sources say each will have specialists
on budgetary affairs, policy, per
sonnel and congressional relations.
These teams wilt look at the bureau
cratic structure to see what, if any
thing. can and should be changed.
They are supposed to find out what de
cisions the Carter administration will
be making in its final weeks and where
various agencies are in the prepara
tion of the budget for fiscal 1982
Ultimately, officials say. these
teams will be drafting position papers
which are meant to define issues and
problems with which the incoming ad
ministration is apt to be confronted, to
outline the principal policies that have
been followed in the departments and
to lav out options for future possi
bilities.

Five advisers to oversee power transfer

From the Uailv wire services
Washington— President-elect
Ronald Reagan's advisers have
divided the government into five
broad functional areas, and are about
to name coordinators to oversee the
transfer of power in each, aides said
yesterday. These coordinators will
provide liaison between the Reagan
hierarchy and small working teams to
be placed in all departments and agen
cies in the executive branch.
Sources in the Reagan camp say
that Elizabeth Dole, a former Federal
trade commissioner and the wife of
Sen Robert Dole (R-Kan. i would be
coordinator for "human resources."
Loren Smith, an associate professor of
constitutional law at Widner Univer
sity and the chief house counsel of the
Reagan campaign committee, will co
ordinate teams working on federal le
gal and regulatory agencies.
Richard Fairbanks, a former as
sociate director of the domestic coun
cil in the Nixon White House, will be
coordinator for resources and de
velopment, an area that encompasses
the Departments of Energy. Agricul
ture and Interior. Economic affairs,
both domestic and international, will
be coordinated by Stanley Anderson, a
Washington lawyer who is a deputy to
Reagan politcai aide William Tim
mons. David Abshire. former assis
tant secretary of state during the Nix
on administration, will coordinate ef-

forts of three teams in the national se
curity area at the Departments of
State and Defense and the Central In
telligence Agency.
Key appointments
Though a number of the so-called
"captains'' of the special working
teams that will actually move into
these departments have not yet been
named, sources say that two key ap
pointments in the national security
area are firm.
William Van Cleave, a former Pen
tagon official who served as Reagan's
senior defense adviser during the
campaign, will head the team that will
soon move into the Pentagon.
Robert Neumann, former am
bassador to Afghanistan and Jordan
and currently at Georgetown Univer
sity's Center for Strategic and In
ternational Studies, will head the
State Department working team.
Though no captain has been named
for the CIA team, sources say Reagan
campaign director William Casey is
certain to play a major role in the
workings of this group. Casey, who
was a European intelligence special
ist in the World War II Office of
Strategic Services, is also said to be a
leading possibility as CIA director in
the new administration.
Security adviser
Numerous Reagan advisers say
that, while no final decision has been
made by Reagan, they believe that

Richard Allen, the long-time senior
foreign policy adviser to the presi
dent-elect. will in fact be named to the
key post of national security adviser in
the White House That post is current
ly held bv Carter aide Zbigniew
Brzezinski and was formerly held by
Nixon aide Henry Kissinger
Allen resigned in the final days of
the election campaign after a news
paper article suggested that he had
used past government positions for
private gain. But Reagan said recent
ly that those charges had been looked
into, by his own staff and other news
papers. and no evidence of wrong
doing had been found At the same
time. Reagan gave a strong vote of
confidence to Allen.
Sources say that official public an
nouncement of the five coordinating
positions is expected this week. These
officials stress that the five coordi
nators will not necessarily wind up

tration after the January 20. 1981, in
