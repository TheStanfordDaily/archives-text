When the Units began their
set at the Fabulous Mahuhay.
the audience momentarily al
lowed pogo overdrive to slip into
neutral. This was certainly not
typical behavior for that in
famous clientele Rampant en
thusiasm characterized the
scurvy minions who had
crowded their way into Dirk
Dirksen's Polynesian restaurant
turned New Wave mecca that
evening Fans who had seen the
I nits before moved to the front,
those who hadn't soon got the
idea The two-fold media show
was about to begin. Synthesizer
music, rolling over the audience
like a fog. accompanied by a col
lage of slide and video images,
placed everyone under sensory
house arrest. Not until later in
the show when the band phased
into some of its more gutsy
rockers did the pogoers manage
to disengage their attention long
enough to flail themselves into
submission.
The three person San Francis
co band features Scott Rvser on
synthesizer and vocals, the stun
ning Rachel Webber on svn

thesizer bass and vocals, and
Brad Saunders on drums.
Rvser. a James Deanish-look
ing character, flapped over his
assorted keyboards like a
plucked string Webber lacked
the intensity of Rvser but pre
sided over her bass synth with a
sultry, poutish look. Bent to his
task. Saunders pounded out any
thing from lengths of mass pro
duced symmetrical rhythms to
various Latin and African beats.
At the other end of the drum
heads, keyboards, and amps
came a surprisingly dense and
intricate sound for three instru
ments. The sequential sound of
the synthesizer was well suited
to the perculator melodies, and
Rvser and Webber's monotone
vocals droned away just as I
always imagined the I\A. voice
at Varian Labs might.
Projected onto two screens
behind the band was the visual
psyche of the songs being
played. The selection and se
quence of the images is no ran
dom process, and. in fact, it con
tinues to evolve with each per
formance. Passing before
curious eves were anything
from 1950s health education

films, to chromosomatic dia
grams of Downs Syndrome
i mongoloid i. to slow motion
footage of wild horses bucking
and rearing in a stream.
Units music leaves the lis
tener with a definite feel for the
hyper techno-electronic society
a la Devo Hut they present their
vision in a much more subtle
fashion than the mutatophiles
from Akron. No look-maT'm
barelv-sane-vocals or riot incit
ing footage of Boogie Boy elec
trocuting himself on the toaster
here. Instead the Units seem to
have established their vision
somewhere between Devo's late
night horror show angst and the
more spacy. lyrical meditations
of Vangelis. Look closer to
home they say. No need to twist
the imagination when a
'Silicone Valley Modernism"
provides enough examples of
humans caught in the narcosis
of applied technology. From the
title cut of their new album
Digital Stimulation:
. . Following her around with
a tape recorder / He put the in
formation in the first computer
/ Comparative analysis before
he knew her / Figured out a for

nuiln on how to make her. . .
But whereas a Devo album
can stand alone and apart from
the film shorts, the Units aren't
quite there yet. Some of the ex
tended synthesizer riffs on their
album failed to click, and the re
pitition lacked the manic antici
pation and gnashing of teeth
evoked by certain parts of
"Jocko Homo." However, on
stage, the Units do deliver. Not
always by shear strength of the
images or the heave-ho of musi
cal virtuosity, but always by
that interesting hybrid mix of
sight and sound.
Occasionally, one's attention
became more focused on the
screens when the music had
thinned. This is why Digital
Stimulation does not seem to
succeed on the level that a live
performance of '.he same songs
does.
See the Units live. Just like
the crossing of horse and jack
ass produces the intrepid mule,
one aspect of the show backed
up the other. It's physical mu
sic. and by the end of the show,
the pogoers were crashing into
each other at extended play.

But whereas a Devo album
can stand alone and apart from
the film shorts, the Units aren't
quite there yet. Some of the ex

album failed to click, and the re

evoked by certain parts of

always by shear strength of the
images or the heave-ho of musi

that interesting hybrid mix of
sight and sound.
