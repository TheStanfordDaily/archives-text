# Gang of Four
## Occidental rockers 
### Jay Martel 
What is America'' I'll tell you: America is a
place where the Gang of Four can perform in
public, as they did last Friday night at the Key
stone Palo Alto, ranting and raving their disso
nant social diatribes. In China, the Gang of
Four is either retired to a work farm or ground
into rice But here in America, they hammer
out their percussive guitar licks and pound
drums in what can only be viewed as tribal po
litical shake-vour-booty. And all this on the eve
of a Republican administration.
Preceding The Gang was Das Block, a group
led by a husky-voice guitarist who said
"Alright" 17 times. The band's music ranged
from three-chord rock to racev prom themes
such as Babv. I Need Your Loving." Despite
tight musicianship, the group was hopelessly
mired in tunefulness, providing a perfect con
trast to what followed. Then again, nearly any
band would have been a perfect contrast to
what followed.
The Gang of Four took the stage and. with
the first distinctive drumbeats leading into
"545," took the hearts of the packed-in pogoers
as well. Playing songs from their one album.
Entertainment, as well as four or five new dit
ties. the four lads from Leeds, England made
political dance music look easy.
In the song "I Found the Essence Rare,"
lead vocalist Jon King, who flopped around the
stage for most of the evening like an excited
dving goldfish, chanted: "The worst thing in
1954 was the Bikini See the girl in the Bikini /
She doesn't know it but she's dressed for the H
bomb."
Lead gutarist Andy Gill, stiff and unblink
ing. an android Peter O'toole, fired enough
frantic swipes at his instruments to give

vehemence and even credence to these and oth
er lyrics.
Drummer Hugo Burnham and bass player
Dave Allen make the Gang of Four a different
rock band from the bottom up. redefining the
traditional roles of their respective instru
ments. The rhythm section becomes the focus,
not the backup. Gill's dissonant leads served to
embellish, not to distract from, this throbbing
domination.
"We'd like to dedicate this song to Ronald
Reagan." Jon King said, and the band punched
out "Guns Before Butter.' Perhaps the Four's
days in the U.S. of A. are numbered. With spec
tacular underlighting effects, the band glowed
from the jowels up in menacing green and vi
olet shades. The net effect was a hypnotic
swarm of sensations capable of turning apes
into tool-wielders or Sigma Chis into Marxists
for that matter.
Vocalist King's performance was spec
tacular and a huge improvement over the
P'our's outting at the Keystone earlier this
year. His rantings. shot out of a reeling head
slick with sweat, worked as a violent coun
terpart to Gill's intensely stoic guitar work. As
punk rock's Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock, their
interplay loaded the stage with electricity.
Encore followed encore. When they ran out
of original songs, they played non-Four songs
such as "Sweet Jane," which was almost like
hearing Jane Fonda talk about basin, tub and
tile cleaner, but much easier to dance to.
After playing their fourth encore to a madly
pogoing and badly bruised crowd. King moved
to destroy a few microphone stands and the
drum set, but was quickly diverted by his
chuckling comrades. Destruction on this small
scale was an anti-climax after what the band
had done to the audience.
