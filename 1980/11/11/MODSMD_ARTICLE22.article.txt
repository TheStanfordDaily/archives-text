# Frankie and Johnnie
## Neither Ernie nor Bert 
### Stephen Nash 
When I first heard Billie Holliday sing
(one Saturday afternoon many years ago on
CBS radio), I wasn't too impressed. Just an
other jazisinger. with loose rhythm. Then a
few years later (after Diana Ross had made
Lady Sings the Blues and repopularized
Holliday s work), I heard her recordings
again. But this time. I was transfixed. I re
alized how personal her singing was, how
evocative her voice could be. and especially
what a terrific sense of rhythm she had.
It's been much the same with "Frankie
and Johnnie: The True Storv." a new per
formance piece by Winston Tong and Bruce
Gedulig at the Magic Theatre. During the
first part of the play. I wasn't quite sure
what was going on. and really didn't care
either It just seemed like a repeat of a lot of
old tricks I'd seen before, backed up by the
beautiful singing of Billie Holliday to give it
legitimacy and cohesion. By the end of the
play. I had conceded that Tong and Gedulig
had a number of nice ideas of their own, but
I was certainly not thrilled by the work as a
whole. By the next day. though, I was
amazed by what I had seen and heard, and
was convinced that "Frankie and Johnnie"
was very tightly and carefully constructed.
But I am running ahead of myself.
"Frankie and Johnnie" is a multi-media
work involving film (two projectors, with
both front and back projection),
soundtracks (13 Billie Holliday songs plus a
few conversations), two actors (Tong and
Gedulig i and two dolls. The play is based on
the famous American blues ballad "Frankie
and Johnny."
Frankie (Winston Tong) is in a mental in
stitution. (I think. The story lines are not
very clear.) He has a fixation for Billip
Holliday, and dresses like her for most of
the play. Using films and props, his doctor

(Bruce Gedulig i leads him back through the
story of how he murdered his lover Johnnie
(also played by Tong. but who only appears
in the films). The story is not told, but
evoked by the images on-stage. The closest
thing to a narrative sequence is the murder
scene.
There is a lot of built-in ambiguity in the
play: sometimes confusing, sometimes
evocative, and always mysterious. (I'm a
great fan of ambiguity — play bitonal music
and I'm ecstatic.) Even the title, with the
spelling of Johnnie's name blurring the sex
es of the characters, adds to the fogginess of
the work. But there are many other wonder
ful things, too.
There's the singing of Billie Holliday,
with its easing in and out of rhythm. The
back-projected shadows of a dinner at a res
taurant. with some of the shadows being on
tilm, and some being the true shadows of
Frankie. Frankie actually singing "Frankie
and Johnnie to the music of a Gerschwin
piano prelude (which meanders
chromatically between major and minor
keys) The film of Frankie and Johnnie spin
ning across the screen, blurring into one an
other. overlapping each other, easing from
side to side through each other. Frankie ma
nipulating the dolls of Frankie and Johnnie
in a sensual seduction scene.
Finally, there's the murder scene. The
scene is filled with the image of Frankie
lying in bed the morning after < to the tune of
"Gloomy Sunday"). As an inset to the larg
er image, the other projector shows Johnnie
with a woman going off to a motel room
somewhere. Then there's Frankie, standing
in front of the screen with a gun, getting
ready and finally shooting the image of
Johnnie. The multiple images and media act
as a metaphor for the multiple emotions of
love and betrayal running through Frankie.
The general idea of different levels of im

agerv is everywhere. There are the actors,
the dolls, the films, and the interactions of
these elements. And then the added blur of
Frankie dressed in drag as Billie Hollidav. I
enjoyed all these elements individually
when I first saw the play, but it was only lat
er that the cumulative effect hit me. When it
happened. I was astounded by what I had
seen.
i was confused during the first half,
though, and Tong and Gedulig risk losing
their audience at the beginning of the play.
Some of the early soundtracks are difficult
to make out (deliberately. I believe), and
there is some danger that a viewer will not
relax and just experience the work, the way
one often experiences jazz. un
fortunate. because what is going on is often
startling in its effect.
The other play on the program, 'The
Saints of Father Lyons" by John O'Keefe,
did not excite me at all — neither that night
nor later In fact, the more I think about that
play, the less impressed I am. It is a
monologue by a Catholic priest on the last
night of his life. The priest believes that
saints are trying to possess him, and he is
also afraid of dying. The play is written,
directed and performed by O'Keefe. Maybe
he should try editing it as well — some self
restraint would have been welcome.
I have never been a fan of slapstick hu
mor; I have always felt that a little under
statement never did any harm when it came
to acting and writing. Unrestrained per
formances make me pity the actor, much as
I would pity anyone who has suffered an em
barrassment in public. Seeing John O'Keefe
jump up and down, make mooing noises, and
wander randomly in and out of falsetto
voices and screams certainly evoked pity in
me. Some members of the audience liked it,
but I envied the two people sitting next to
me who left about half way through.
