# Beat Crazy
## Regular Joe grows up 
### Michelle Carter 
Last New Year's Eve I somehow found my
self in a circle of punk Tower Records clerks
who were batting around examples of the de
generation of new wave. Just as the discussion
was getting hot, one woman raised her voice
and said, "You think that's bad? Now we're
supposed to file Joe Jackson under new wave."
Barring sheer intimidation, I really wanted to
put in the good word for Joe; to say, sure he
only sings about mean women and exploitation
of the masses, but he's noble and he plays the
melodica. I didn't speak up for Joe then, but
here's the comeback, only 8 1 2 months late: say
gang, if you'd heard Joe's latest, you'd under
stand why.
The most wavey thing about Beat Crazy is
the production. It relies heavily on bass and
rhythms, yielding a clean, sharp and infectious
sound. Gone are the muddy shriekings of "Got
the Time" and "I'm the Man." Each of the cuts
on Beat Crazy sends out an undertow in the
first few measures that curls around your
ankles and tugs, whether it be the reggae
bongos on "Beat Crazy" or the 852-oid bass
progression on "Mad at You." But the most
surprising thing about the album is something
that lends greatly to its sophistication, but
can't help being a disappointment to the hard
core Joe Jackson fan — somehow, somewhere,
Joe grew up.
Nothing to be too alarmed about — take
heart, Joe's still the king of Bitter — but I'm
not sure how angry he is anymore. Gone are

the jubilant, self-indulgent waitings of "One
More Time," "Is She Really Going Out With
Him'.'" and "It's Different for Girls." in which
Joe plays dupe to the women of the world, all of
which are out to wring him dry and toss him
aside like a squeezed lemon. The new Joe Jack
son specializes in wry insights into social
malevolence. The women in Joe's life are still
giving him a hard time, but there's a crucial
difference: now it's Joe who's calling the
shots. He even takes up the case of womankind
a couple of times — in "Biology" he bombasts
sexual double-standards, and in "Fit" he sings
in defense of his outcasted "ugly sisters."
These are banners the old Joe did not seem
eager to wave.
Yet just because Joe's not blaming women
for his troubles anymore doesn't mean he's
given up complaining; he's just shifted the re
sponsibility. In "Pretty Boys" he curses
Madison Avenue. In "Fit" he wails on con
formity. In "Battleground" it's racism. In
"Evil p]ye" it's paranoia. Such an evolution in
his perspectives assuredly makes Joe more in
teresting and wry is nice; but it's distanced,
too. There's part of me that misses the angry
Joe.
Don't get me wrong — the album's slick,
gutsy and as "wave" as Joe's gonna get. But
don't plan on using the album for scream thera
py. or giving it to your ex-lover just to show
em the meaning of bitter. It won't work any
more — Joe's a big boy now.

sponsibility. In "Pretty Boys" he curses
Madison Avenue. In "Fit" he wails on con
formity. In "Battleground" it's racism. In
"Evil p]ye" it's paranoia. Such an evolution in
his perspectives assuredly makes Joe more in
teresting and wry is nice; but it's distanced,
too. There's part of me that misses the angry
Joe.
Don't get me wrong — the album's slick,
gutsy and as "wave" as Joe's gonna get. But
don't plan on using the album for scream thera
py. or giving it to your ex-lover just to show
em the meaning of bitter. It won't work any
more — Joe's a big boy now.
