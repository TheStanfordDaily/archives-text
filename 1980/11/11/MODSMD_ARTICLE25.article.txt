# Practice makes perfect
## Not a tiresome French farce

l*ractice Makes Perfect sounds like one of
those tiresome French farces in the Cousin,
Cousine vein that have saturated art house
audiences in the past few years, and so little
has been written about it that it may pass
almost entirely unnoticed Hut it is a won
derful little movie — and I use the word 'lit

tilm is extravagant neither in its statement
nor in its means, it is small-scale but not
meager — like a Chekhov short story.

carries on a conference about taxes with his
ever-present secretary.
