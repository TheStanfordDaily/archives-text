# Energy self-sufficiency stressed at conference
## 
### Sally Newman 
Becoming self-sufficient is the na
tion s highest energy priority — that's
the message brought back from Wash
ington I).C by four students who last
month attended the nationwide
Energy Future Conference sponsored
bv B nai B rith. a Jewish service or
ganization
Seniors Cordon Myers and Robert
Lipton and sophomores Shara Kron
mal and Audrey Levine received thick
notebooks crammed with facts and
figures when they arrived in the na
tion's capital.
But while there, they also gained
some sobering facts pertaining to
America's energy future — none, how
ever. pointing the way to a quick or
painless end to dependence on foreign
energy
"Forty-one percent of our imported
oil comes from unstable sources.'
said keynote speaker Bernard White.
Of those, he said Iran is the most
stable.
Levine pointed out that OPEC na
tions traditionally refuse to step up
production to meet Western demand,
opt ing instead to increase their politi
cal power by limiting production
"Essentially, we re at their (OPEC's)
mercy." she said
The students stressed that there is
no "cure-all" energy source, making
the situation look pretty grim But
they said the lectures made clear that
bv the year 2020 the United States will
have barely enough oil to cover its
petrochemical — let alone fuel —
needs, thus apparently setting the
stage for disaster.
However, they said the conference
stressed that if the country can fully
develop one or more new energy
sources, the "inevitable" may well be
averted
None of the speakers or workshop
leaders explicitly advocated nuclear
power as the only alternative — proba
bly. said Kronmal. in deference to the
predominately college-age gathering.

Rather, the vision that seems to
have emerged at the conference was
one favoring an "energy mix." blend
ing solar power, other "soft" energy
sources and nuclear energy with in
creased conservation of existing re
sources
While Kronmal pointed out that
there are limits to conservation
there's only so much you can con
serve" — it does have at least one
practical effect, according to Myers
"Conservation buys time for re
search." he said, adding that con
ference participants were urged to es
tablish or strengthen existing campus
conservation programs. The students
were also told of the need to "seek out
other groups with allied interests and
work with them" to alert people to the
seriousness ot the situation
The students emphasized that gen
eral education on energy issues is an
integral and immediate concern. And.
according to Harvard Business
School's 1979 "Report on Energy
Projects." Americans can use 30 to 40
percent less energy without radically
changing their lifestyles.
Assuming energy waste can be
eliminated. Mvers said conservation
will entail "virtually no penalty on the
way Americans live."
If. according to speaker Ellen
Laipson of the Congressional Re
search Service, "we become energy
independent. our reputation among
other, especially Third World, nations
will be greatly improved " She ex
plained that this would better rela
tions because "they'll see that we can
be relied on."
To that end. other speakers ad
vocated federal investments in long
term alternative energy projects, ac
cording to the students.
The four participants will discuss
the conference, their reactions to it
and conservation tips tommorrow at
Hillel's noon lunch discussion in the
Clubhouse.
