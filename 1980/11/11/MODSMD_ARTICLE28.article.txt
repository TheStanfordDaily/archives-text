Labor Party leader chosen
London — Former leader of the House of Commons
Michael Foot, an eloquent parliamentary orator and
crusader for nuclear disarmament, was chosen last night
to be the new leader of Britain's ideologically divided op
position Labor Party bv a 10-vote majority of the Labor
members of Parliament.
Foot, supported by the party's left-wing proponents of a
more radically socialist alternative to the right-wing Con
servative government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, beat Labor's right-wing candidate, former
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, by a vote of 139
to 129 in a runoff.
Foot. 67, a frail-looking former journalist and political
maverick with a gentle manner but a powerful presence as
a public speaker, steps up from the position of deputy lead
er to former Prune Minister James Callaghan. who re
tired as party leader last month at the age of 68.
With a surprisingly large margin of victory in the secret
balloting. Foot won votes in the tight contest from centrist
members who felt he was more likely than the sometimes
brusque and pugnacious Healey to be able to heal the par
ty's deep divisions.
Foot believes strongly in arms control and the welfare
state. He opposed Britain's entry into the Common Market
and supports the abolition of the House of Lords.
He has promised to try to pull the party together and
launch an immediate campaign "to transform the winter
of fear and desolation ahead of us into a hurricane of na
tional protest" against Thatcher's harsh monetarist eco
nomic policies.
Foot still faces questions about his age and image as
potential prime minister when Labor next has the op
portunity to challenge Thatcher's Conservatives at the
polls, which is not expected much before 1984. Foot, the
oldest man elected Labor leader in a half century, would
then be 70.
Violence erupts in Zimbabwe
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — At least 16 persons were killed
yesterday in Zimbabwe's worst factional violence since
the nation became independent seven months ago.
Residents of Bulawayo. the southwestern provincial
capital where the clashes are taking place, said thousands
of blacks were fleeing the surrounding African townships
as former guerrillas loyal to Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe battled followers of Home Affairs Minister
Joshua Nkomo.
Bulawayo police spokesman Piers Winter said 16 per
sons. including both "armed dissidents" and civilians, had
been killed and about 200 had been injured. Firing went on
all day in Entumbane township, where former guerrillas
of the two rival factions have been relocated. The situation
was "still highly charged" and was not under control by
nightfall, the spokesman said.
In a nationwide radio and television speech last night,
Mugabe said he had ordered police, army and air force re
inforcements to Bulawayo, 250 miles southwest of the cap
ital.
Nuclear planning zones widened
Sacramento — Disaster planning zones around three of
California's four nuclear power plants have been enlarged
to three times the size required by the federal govern
ment. the state Office of Emergency Services announced
yesterday.
The counties around the Rancho Seco, Diablo Canyon,
and San Onofre plants have until April to draw up new

emergency plans detailing how they would deal with a ma
jor nuclear power plant accident.
"When we are all finished, we will have the most com
prehensive emergency plan in the United States," said
OES Director Alex Cunningham
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission now re
quires uniform 10-mile planning zones around each nucle
ar power plant.
After the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in
1979. the Legislature passed a bill requiring the OtCS to
evaluate the possible consequences of serious accidents at
the state's plants and draw new zones.
The zones for the plants are different and have jagged
boundaries, depending on the plant, its surroundings,
nearby population, winds, and land use.
Each plant has a Basic Emergency Planning Zone, from
which people would have to be evacuated in the event of a
major accident, and an Extended Emergency Planning
Zone, where people could be told to stay indoors.
Rancho Seco and San Onofre are the only two nuclear
plants operating now in California. Diablo Canyon is seek
ing a federal license.
Fed rejects auto import block
Washington — The U.S. International Trade Com
mission yesterday turned down a plea for restrictions or
new taxes on imported cars and trucks, rejecting argu
ments by American automakers who blame foreign com
petition for financial losses and unemployment.
The panel, by a three-to-two vote, conceded that a rising
tide of imports — particularly from Japan — has seriously
damaged U.S. automakers, but not enough to justify trade
protections sought by Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto
Workers.
UAW spokesman Steve Schlossberg said the union will
appeal to President Jimmy Carter, although the com
mission's decision cannot be reversed. Carter could
pursue negotiations to try to persuade Japanese auto
makers to slow down shipments to the U.S. "We are confi
dent he will act." Schlossberg said.
"If we run into a stone block (at the White House), then
we will have to go to Congress," Schlossberg said. He
added that President-elect Ronald Reagan has "expressed
understanding of the problem."
Ford had asked for a temporary five-year quota to cut
by about 1 million per year the number of foreign cars al
lowed into the country, most from Japan. The UAW also
wanted the duty on imported cars raised to 20 percent and
asked that a 25 percent duty on trucks be maintained.
Stocks rise in quiet trading
New York — The stock market, paced by a smattering of
aerospace, oil and precious-metals issues, managed a
small gain yesterday in the quietest trading in two weeks.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
dropped more than 20 points last Thursday and Friday, re
covered 1.37 to 933.79.
New York Stock Exchange volume slowed to 35.72 mil
lion shares from 40.07 million Friday.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through tonight with a chance of sprinkles
and light showers. Mostly fair tomorrow. Lows today in
the upper 40s to low 50s and highs in the 60s. Chance of rain
20 percent through tonight.

to be the new leader of Britain's ideologically divided op
position Labor Party bv a 10-vote majority of the Labor
members of Parliament.
Foot, supported by the party's left-wing proponents of a
more radically socialist alternative to the right-wing Con
servative government of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, beat Labor's right-wing candidate, former
Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey, by a vote of 139
to 129 in a runoff.
Foot. 67, a frail-looking former journalist and political
maverick with a gentle manner but a powerful presence as
a public speaker, steps up from the position of deputy lead
er to former Prune Minister James Callaghan. who re
tired as party leader last month at the age of 68.
With a surprisingly large margin of victory in the secret
balloting. Foot won votes in the tight contest from centrist
members who felt he was more likely than the sometimes
brusque and pugnacious Healey to be able to heal the par
ty's deep divisions.
Foot believes strongly in arms control and the welfare
state. He opposed Britain's entry into the Common Market
and supports the abolition of the House of Lords.
He has promised to try to pull the party together and
launch an immediate campaign "to transform the winter
of fear and desolation ahead of us into a hurricane of na
tional protest" against Thatcher's harsh monetarist eco
nomic policies.
Foot still faces questions about his age and image as
potential prime minister when Labor next has the op
portunity to challenge Thatcher's Conservatives at the
polls, which is not expected much before 1984. Foot, the
oldest man elected Labor leader in a half century, would
then be 70.
Violence erupts in Zimbabwe
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — At least 16 persons were killed
yesterday in Zimbabwe's worst factional violence since
the nation became independent seven months ago.
Residents of Bulawayo. the southwestern provincial
capital where the clashes are taking place, said thousands
of blacks were fleeing the surrounding African townships
as former guerrillas loyal to Prime Minister Robert
Mugabe battled followers of Home Affairs Minister
Joshua Nkomo.
Bulawayo police spokesman Piers Winter said 16 per
sons. including both "armed dissidents" and civilians, had
been killed and about 200 had been injured. Firing went on
all day in Entumbane township, where former guerrillas
of the two rival factions have been relocated. The situation
was "still highly charged" and was not under control by
nightfall, the spokesman said.
In a nationwide radio and television speech last night,
Mugabe said he had ordered police, army and air force re
inforcements to Bulawayo, 250 miles southwest of the cap
ital.
Nuclear planning zones widened
Sacramento — Disaster planning zones around three of
California's four nuclear power plants have been enlarged
to three times the size required by the federal govern
ment. the state Office of Emergency Services announced
yesterday.
The counties around the Rancho Seco, Diablo Canyon,
and San Onofre plants have until April to draw up new

emergency plans detailing how they would deal with a ma
jor nuclear power plant accident.
"When we are all finished, we will have the most com
prehensive emergency plan in the United States," said
OES Director Alex Cunningham
The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission now re
quires uniform 10-mile planning zones around each nucle
ar power plant.
After the Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania in
1979. the Legislature passed a bill requiring the OtCS to
evaluate the possible consequences of serious accidents at
the state's plants and draw new zones.
The zones for the plants are different and have jagged
boundaries, depending on the plant, its surroundings,
nearby population, winds, and land use.
Each plant has a Basic Emergency Planning Zone, from
which people would have to be evacuated in the event of a
major accident, and an Extended Emergency Planning
Zone, where people could be told to stay indoors.
Rancho Seco and San Onofre are the only two nuclear
plants operating now in California. Diablo Canyon is seek

Fed rejects auto import block
Washington — The U.S. International Trade Com
mission yesterday turned down a plea for restrictions or
new taxes on imported cars and trucks, rejecting argu
ments by American automakers who blame foreign com
petition for financial losses and unemployment.
The panel, by a three-to-two vote, conceded that a rising
tide of imports — particularly from Japan — has seriously
damaged U.S. automakers, but not enough to justify trade
protections sought by Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto
Workers.
UAW spokesman Steve Schlossberg said the union will
appeal to President Jimmy Carter, although the com
mission's decision cannot be reversed. Carter could
pursue negotiations to try to persuade Japanese auto
makers to slow down shipments to the U.S. "We are confi
dent he will act." Schlossberg said.
"If we run into a stone block (at the White House), then
we will have to go to Congress," Schlossberg said. He
added that President-elect Ronald Reagan has "expressed
understanding of the problem."
Ford had asked for a temporary five-year quota to cut
by about 1 million per year the number of foreign cars al
lowed into the country, most from Japan. The UAW also
wanted the duty on imported cars raised to 20 percent and
asked that a 25 percent duty on trucks be maintained.
