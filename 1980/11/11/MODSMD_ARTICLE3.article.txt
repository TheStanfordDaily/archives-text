# Polish court ruling favors trade unions

From the Daily wire services
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's Su
preme Court ruled yesterday that the
country's leading independent trade
union Solidarity did not have to accept
changes made in its charter by a lower
court The union promptly called off
strikes that would have plunged the
nation into a serious new crisis.
The union, as part of a compromise
worked out over the last several days
by its lawyers, agreed, however, to at
tach an annex to its charter that in
directly affirms the leading role of the
Communist Party in Poland.
The surprise compromise, which
brought jubilation to members of the
10-million-worker union and relief to
Polish authorities, was hailed by both
sides as a victory for common sense
and for Poland's future.
After the ruling by the three-judge
court, Polish authorities lifted a ban
imposed Sunday on the entry of for
eign journalists into the country. The
sudden ban as well as hardline
criticism in the Polish and Soviet
press of the union s plan to strike if the
decision were unfavorable had raised
fears here of a serious new national
crisis.
"You can't speak of winners or
losers.' Lech Walesa, head of Solidar
ity and the leader of Poland's inde
pendent trade movement, said after
the Supreme Court's ruling "It was
the proper solution to the problem."
Warsaw authorities reaffirmed
their intention to work "in serious
partnership and cooperation" with the
new independent union, formed after a
series of summer strikes that began at
the huge Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk
and spread to other Baltic coast in

dustrial centers and across the coun
try.
After the high court declared that a
lower court had exceeded its authority
by writing a declaration of Com
munist Party domination into Solidar
ity's charter and deleting portions as
serting a right to strike, Walesa
emerged from the sandstone grey
court building beaming.
"We have achieved what we set out
to on Aug. 31," he said, referring to the
date on which government and strik
ing workers signed an agreement
guaranteeing the existence of inde
pendent trade unions in Poland.
"However, this is the beginning. In
front of us is a big line of work and eve
ryone has his own piece of this line . . .
Everyone has to go to work and work
hard."
Yesterday's court action marked a
formal end to the first phase of de
velopment of the new countrywide un
ion — the first independent labor union
in any Communist-ruled country —
and the working out of a new balance
of power in Poland. Walesa's
statement pointed to the second, and
likely more difficult, challenge the un
ion and the country now face: reviving
and reforming the Polish economy,
crippled after months of labor unrest
and years of mismanagement.
While the court's decision gave rise
to optimism about the ability of the
Communist Party and Solidarity to
work successfully together, the path
ahead remains filled with sensitive is
sues — including media access, wage
sc ales and national labor legislation —
that could easily spark new confronta
tions.
Both sides must wrestle with
divisive currents within their own
groups, complicating the problem of
relating to each other.
Solidarity, having expanded rapidly
from the small strike committee in
the Gdansk shipyard of last summer to
a nationwide organization, is still de
fining structure and tactics. The
Polish Communist Party, de
moralized by the labor upheaval, is
going through intense debate about
itself and vying for renewed authority.
Cautioning prudence and helping to
keep the peace between these two
evolving forces is Poland's third
power, the Roman Catholic Church.
Immediately after the court ruling.
Walesa and Solidarity's national coor
dinating committee went to see
Cardinal Stefan Wvszynski. Poland's
primate.
".Justice has begun to reign in the
country." Walesa declared, greeting
Wyszvnski in the cardinal's private
residence and handing him a bouquet
of flowers "The worst is over."
Until yesterday. Solidarity and the
government had appeared to be gear
ing up for a confrontation against a

background of an extensively pre
pared strike and threats by the gov
ernment of counteraction.
But in the small courtroom, the
mood turned conciliatory. The govern
ment prosecutor openly conceded that
the district court had overstepped its
prerogatives by interfering with Soli
darity's charter Solidarity's lawyers,
in turn, offered to attach an annex
that, among other points, included the
communist principles the government
had sought to have written into the
charter itself
The annex has two parts. One is a re
statement of the first seven points of
the Gdansk agreement, which say that
the new unions will recognize the lead
ing role of the party in the Polish state
and will respect Poland's interna
tional alliances. Union leaders had ob
jected to the insertion of this wording
into the actual charter, arguing that
this would imply the party played the
same role in the union's operation.
The second part of the annex in
cludes portions of the International
Labor Organization Convention guar
anteeing the rights of trade unions
against government interference and
outlining relations between em

plovers and employees.
The central sticking point had been
how to include in Solidarity's charter a
statement of Poland's basic com
munist principles. Reference to these
somewhere in the document was im
portant not only to the Warsaw leader
ship but particularly to Poland's Sovi
et-led allies, worried that the new free
unions will undermine Communist
control.
But two weeks ago. during his first
visit to Moscow since being named
Polish Communist Party chief in the
wake of the summer's strikes.
Stanislaw Kama appeared to win Sovi
et backing for Warsaw's own strained
efforts at trying to reach an under
standing with Solidarity.
Yesterday's compromise would
seem to strengthen the government's
hand here in showing it can deal on its
own with the country's determined la
bor movement.
"The government welcomes with
satisfaction the overcoming of the ten
sion which had arisen in connection
with the registration of Solidarity,"
the government said. "Resolving that
issue creates full conditions for nor
malization of the union's activity."
