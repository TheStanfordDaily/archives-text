# Polish court ruling favors trade unions

From the Daily wire services
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's Su
preme Court ruled yesterday that the
country's leading independent trade
union Solidarity did not have to accept
changes made in its charter by a lower
court The union promptly called off
strikes that would have plunged the
nation into a serious new crisis.
The union, as part of a compromise
worked out over the last several days
by its lawyers, agreed, however, to at
tach an annex to its charter that in
directly affirms the leading role of the
Communist Party in Poland.
The surprise compromise, which
brought jubilation to members of the
10-million-worker union and relief to
Polish authorities, was hailed by both
sides as a victory for common sense
and for Poland's future.
After the ruling by the three-judge
court, Polish authorities lifted a ban
imposed Sunday on the entry of for
eign journalists into the country. The
sudden ban as well as hardline
criticism in the Polish and Soviet
press of the union s plan to strike if the
decision were unfavorable had raised
fears here of a serious new national
crisis.
"You can't speak of winners or
losers.' Lech Walesa, head of Solidar
ity and the leader of Poland's inde
pendent trade movement, said after
the Supreme Court's ruling "It was
the proper solution to the problem."
Warsaw authorities reaffirmed
their intention to work "in serious
partnership and cooperation" with the
new independent union, formed after a
series of summer strikes that began at
the huge Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk
and spread to other Baltic coast in

dustrial centers and across the coun
try.
After the high court declared that a
lower court had exceeded its authority
by writing a declaration of Com
munist Party domination into Solidar
ity's charter and deleting portions as
serting a right to strike, Walesa
emerged from the sandstone grey
court building beaming.
"We have achieved what we set out
to on Aug. 31," he said, referring to the
date on which government and strik
ing workers signed an agreement
guaranteeing the existence of inde
pendent trade unions in Poland.
"However, this is the beginning. In
front of us is a big line of work and eve
ryone has his own piece of this line . . .
Everyone has to go to work and work
hard."
Yesterday's court action marked a
formal end to the first phase of de
velopment of the new countrywide un
ion — the first independent labor union
in any Communist-ruled country —
and the working out of a new balance
of power in Poland. Walesa's
statement pointed to the second, and
likely more difficult, challenge the un
ion and the country now face: reviving
and reforming the Polish economy,
crippled after months of labor unrest
and years of mismanagement.
While the court's decision gave rise
to optimism about the ability of the
Communist Party and Solidarity to
work successfully together, the path
ahead remains filled with sensitive is
sues — including media access, wage
sc ales and national labor legislation —
that could easily spark new confronta
tions.
