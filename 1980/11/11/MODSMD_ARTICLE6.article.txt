## Cuba advises Nicaragua to keep U.S. ties open 
### Washington Post 
Managua, Nicaragua — For all the interna
tional concern generated by the presence of about
2500 Cuban advisers, the gist of Fidel Castro's
counsel to the Nicaraguan revolution so far is that
it should take firm measures to avoid becoming
another Cuba.
Castro, the hero of Latin American leftists for
three decades, is considered to be one of the ruling
Sandinista movement's most trusted advisers.
But the advice he offers is so pragmatic, and often
so divorced from expected Marxist ideology, that
a friend of his recently declared: "In the old days,
he probably wouldn't have taken it himself."
The thrust of his message is that Nicaragua
should benefit from Cuba's mistakes.
A high Mexican official long interested in Cuba
said recently, "For years, Castro wanted to show
Moscow how you build a true socialist society,
more humane and more just than the Soviets. But
he bogged down. Like a doting father, he now
wants for the Nicaraguan revolution everything
he hasn't achieved in his own."
From interviews with Nicaraguan and Cuban
officials and Western diplomats, it appears that
Castro's private advice is a more biting version of
his public statements and a harsh judgment of his
own revolution. The Cubans reportedly are telling
the Sandinistas not to turn Nicaragua into an
isolated, bureaucratic, inefficient state and not to
become a Soviet satellite.
Leery of Soviet goods
On a more mundane level, the Cubans warn the
Sandinistas to be leery of imports from the Soviet
Bloc, necessarily the source of most Cuban capi
tal goods. Early this year, the Cubans were
shocked to learn that Nicaragua had contracted
for 800 East German trucks.
Cuba had found that, although the trucks were
offered on favorable terms, their performance
was low and spare parts hard to come by. When
the Cuban advisers suggested canceling the deal,
Nicaragua sent a mission to East Germany for
that purpose.
"A deal is a deal." East German Communist
Party chief Erich Honecker reportedly replied.
Nicaragua spent $18 million for the trucks, so
enraging one official that he called for breaking
relations with East Germany. The Nicaraguans
made clear that thev will consult the Cubans

before any more such purchases.
Castro's advice, some of it alluded to publicly,
is for the Sandinistas to maintain close relations
with the United States, the Vatican, private capi
tal and international financial institutions that
are a source of credibility as well as credit.
Need for Western markets
With Cuba's growth limited in part by the U.S.
boycott. Castro has underlined Nicaragua's needs
for Western machinery, financing, medicines and
markets.
But the Cubans' most repeated warnings are
against the creation of a stifling omnipresence of
the state in daily life. At home. Castro is trying to
cut back the role of the state and breathe new life
in the stagnant economy by reviving some private
enterprise.
The role of private enterprise in Nicaragua has
been hotly disputed since the Sandinistas over
threw President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
Private business not only should exist within the
Nicaraguan socialist revolution, said a high-rank
ing Cuban official, "it should be reactivated and
stimulated."'
Although much of Cuba's advice sounds re
assuring to U.S. diplomats here, the diplomats'
more serious concern is the Cuban advisers in the
areas of intelligence, communications and the
armed forces.
Reveal local problems
Some of the "don'ts" that the Cubans pass
along to Nicaragua are particularly revealing of
how the islanders perceive their home situation.
For example, Cuban advisers say a state distribu
tion system is more costly and less efficient than a
market system, while adding to unemployment
because it eliminates jobs in the vast network of
small producers, sellers and shopowners.
Further, rationing of food and other consumer
goods leads to black markets, they advise.
The planning sector, ever the favorite of social
ist economies, must be kept small, say the
Cubans. One of Castro's planners told
Nicaraguans that Cuba's big mistake was "that
we put all our good people in planning jobs behind
desks. They should have been kept in production."
While the Sandinistas insist they are deeply
grateful for help from Venezuela and Mexico, a
non-Marxist government economist said it "often
is not what we need. "

Need for Western markets
With Cuba's growth limited in part by the U.S.
boycott. Castro has underlined Nicaragua's needs
for Western machinery, financing, medicines and
markets.
But the Cubans' most repeated warnings are
against the creation of a stifling omnipresence of
the state in daily life. At home. Castro is trying to
cut back the role of the state and breathe new life
in the stagnant economy by reviving some private
enterprise.
The role of private enterprise in Nicaragua has
been hotly disputed since the Sandinistas over
threw President Anastasio Somoza in July 1979.
Private business not only should exist within the
Nicaraguan socialist revolution, said a high-rank
ing Cuban official, "it should be reactivated and
stimulated."'
Although much of Cuba's advice sounds re
assuring to U.S. diplomats here, the diplomats'
more serious concern is the Cuban advisers in the
areas of intelligence, communications and the
armed forces.
Reveal local problems
Some of the "don'ts" that the Cubans pass
along to Nicaragua are particularly revealing of
how the islanders perceive their home situation.
For example, Cuban advisers say a state distribu
tion system is more costly and less efficient than a
market system, while adding to unemployment
because it eliminates jobs in the vast network of
small producers, sellers and shopowners.
Further, rationing of food and other consumer
goods leads to black markets, they advise.
The planning sector, ever the favorite of social
ist economies, must be kept small, say the
Cubans. One of Castro's planners told
Nicaraguans that Cuba's big mistake was "that
we put all our good people in planning jobs behind
desks. They should have been kept in production."
While the Sandinistas insist they are deeply
grateful for help from Venezuela and Mexico, a
non-Marxist government economist said it "often
is not what we need. "
Managua, Nicaragua — For all the interna
tional concern generated by the presence of about
2500 Cuban advisers, the gist of Fidel Castro's
counsel to the Nicaraguan revolution so far is that
it should take firm measures to avoid becoming
another Cuba.
Castro, the hero of Latin American leftists for
three decades, is considered to be one of the ruling
Sandinista movement's most trusted advisers.
But the advice he offers is so pragmatic, and often
so divorced from expected Marxist ideology, that
a friend of his recently declared: "In the old days,
he probably wouldn't have taken it himself."
The thrust of his message is that Nicaragua
should benefit from Cuba's mistakes.
A high Mexican official long interested in Cuba
said recently, "For years, Castro wanted to show
Moscow how you build a true socialist society,
more humane and more just than the Soviets. But
he bogged down. Like a doting father, he now
wants for the Nicaraguan revolution everything
he hasn't achieved in his own."
From interviews with Nicaraguan and Cuban
officials and Western diplomats, it appears that
Castro's private advice is a more biting version of
his public statements and a harsh judgment of his
own revolution. The Cubans reportedly are telling
the Sandinistas not to turn Nicaragua into an
isolated, bureaucratic, inefficient state and not to
become a Soviet satellite.
Leery of Soviet goods
On a more mundane level, the Cubans warn the
Sandinistas to be leery of imports from the Soviet
Bloc, necessarily the source of most Cuban capi
tal goods. Early this year, the Cubans were
shocked to learn that Nicaragua had contracted
for 800 East German trucks.
Cuba had found that, although the trucks were
offered on favorable terms, their performance
was low and spare parts hard to come by. When
the Cuban advisers suggested canceling the deal,
Nicaragua sent a mission to East Germany for
that purpose.
"A deal is a deal." East German Communist
Party chief Erich Honecker reportedly replied.
Nicaragua spent $18 million for the trucks, so
enraging one official that he called for breaking
relations with East Germany. The Nicaraguans
made clear that thev will consult the Cubans

before any more such purchases.
Castro's advice, some of it alluded to publicly,
is for the Sandinistas to maintain close relations
with the United States, the Vatican, private capi
tal and international financial institutions that
are a source of credibility as well as credit.
