# USSR cracks down on dissidents
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — After years of
struggle, state security forces
have broken the back of interna!
political dissent in the Soviet
Union, leaving its future as
clouded as at any time since the
death of Stalin in 1953.
Ironically, this has been
achieved virtually on the eve of
the Madrid conference, which
opens today to review com
pliance with the provisions of
the 1975 Helsinki agreement on
European security and coopera
tion Soviet internal repressions
opened the door to likely bitter
wrangling there about Mos
cow's compliance with the hu
man-rights provisions of the ac
cord.
The pace of the KGB secret
police offensive against dissi
dents. which has gathered
momentum since 1977, esca
lated with the arrest and in
ternal exile of Moscow's most
famous human-rights cham
pion. Andrei Sakharov. in Janu
ary. It was given an added ur
gency by Kremlin determina
tion to silence dissenters before
and during last summer's Olym
pic Games here.
Since the Games ended Aug.
3, however, more than two
dozen trials producing convic
tions have been held and numer
ous new arrests were carried
out in a security sweep that left
the ever-dwindling dissident
movement frustrated, dis
heartened and leaderless.
A look at some recent
cases shows the thoroughness
with which the state is pursuing
the activists.
Three editors of the clan

destine journal Poiski
(Searchesi have been convicted
of state slander and sentenced
to three years imprisonment.
Yuri Grimm and Valerie
Abramkin were jailed, but
Viktor Sokirko's sentence was
suspended after he pleaded guil
ty and recanted his activities.
The six issues published during
the journal's two years of opera
tion included discussions of Eu
rocommunism, socialism, and
communist reform.
Nationalists:
Lithuanians Antanas
Terleckas and Julius
Sasnauskas were given three
years and 18 months respective
ly in labor camps, plus five
years internal exile each, for
their human-rights work. For
many years. Terleckas was a
major nationalist figure in the
Vilnius-based movement, and
with 44 other Baltic natives, in
cluding Sasnauskas. last year
signed a denunciation of the 1939
pact that gave Moscow control
of the Baltics. The condemna
tion thus struck at Soviet claims
to legitimacy there and de
manded reprisal.
Religious activists:
Having gained a televised
confession from dissident Rus
sian Orthodox priest Dmitri
Dudko in June — perhaps the
single greatest blow to broad
based and nationalist-oriented
church ferment — the author
ities followed up this fall with
confessions from Lev Regelson
and Viktor Kapitanchuk of the
Christian Committee for the De
fense of Believers' Rights. The
two. accused of anti-Soviet ac
tivities. pleaded guilty and re

ceived suspended five-year jail
sentences.
Human-rights activists:
Vyacheslav Bakhmin. of a
citizens' group that monitors
psychiatric abuses, was con
victed of anti-Soviet slander and
sentenced to three years im
prisonment. His group has been
devastated by several arrests.
The successful suppression of
dissidents, or "those who think
differently" in Russian, is the
work of a Kremlin leadership
determined to project the ap
pearance of total unanimity
among the diverse Soviet peo
ples at a time when this country
faces complex domestic and
foreign policy challenges.
Activism and detente
But the paring of a generation
of activists that emerged in the
1970s solves, for now, internal
problems connected with the
decade of detente, when
Brezhnev reversed long
standing Kremlin policy and ac
tively sought political, econom
ic and military "relaxation of
tensions" with the adversary
West in an attempt to modernize
the struggling Soviet economy.
Moscow s aim was to take the
technology, but insulate its pop
ulace from the dangerous ideas
that might encourage the re
ligious. nationalist, political
and social dissenters who had
always survived within the Sovi
et society.
The Kremlin proved equal to
the challenge. The activists
have been routed, and the Soviet
Union now enjoys wider eco
nomic ties with the West than
ever in its history.

At the same time, the leader
ship has succeeded in containing
detente's potential impact on
the masses. In fact, chiefly be
cause of renewed jamming of
Western radio broadcasts since
the Polish crisis, and shrill anti-
U.S. denunciations not heard
here since the Vietnam War. the
Soviet people seem more psy
chologically isolated from the
West than at any time in the past
15 years.
