## Japanese debate constitutional changes 
### Washington Post 
Tokyo â€” Kingo Machimura is a con
servative. nationalistic member of the
Japanese parliament who has never lived
comfortably with the fact that Japan's con
stitution was imposed by the American
post-war occupation forces.
"It was made almost without the hands of
the Japanese touching it," Machimura re
calls with a trace of emotion in his voice.
"This is something that is unforgivable for
the Japanese people."
A substantial minority of the ruling Liber
al Democratic Party holds similar views,
and it has succeeded this fall in making re
vision of the foreigners' constitution a ma
jor party issue. For the first time in nearly a
decade, constitutional revision is being seri
ously discussed within the party.
The post-war constitution renounced war
forever. Despite that. Japan has built up a
sizable military force, but it rests on shaky
legal underpinnings and the revisionists
such as Machimura think it is time to have a
lawful army.
"The preface of the constitution says that
the Japanese people pray for eternal peace

and so we must rely on the justice of nations
that want peace." observes Machimura.
"Considering the present situation, this is a
kind of dream."
The "present situation." as Japan's more
hawkish legislators see it, is that the United
States has lost military superiority over the
Soviet Union and might not be able to defend
Japan, especially if it were fighting in the
Middle East or Europe when Japan needed
help.
This sentiment was reinforced by two re
cent events One was the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, which strongly affected public
opinion here. A second was the steady
buildup of Soviet military forces on small is
lands north of Japan. Some Japanese be
lieve these troops could turn into an in
vasion force.
The hawks believe that Japan must be
able to defend itself independently, relying
on the United States and the mutual security
treaty merely for strategic nuclear protec
tion.
The constitutional muddle that
Machimura and his colleagues want to clear
up was a legacy of the American occupation

forces led by Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur.
They first insisted that Japan renounce war
and military force forever and succeeded in
forcing adoption of an article that did just
that in 1947.
Discussion was considered taboo until
this fall when an outspoken Cabinet mem
ber. Justice Minister Seisuke Okuno, blunt
ly appealed for public support of an "inde
pendent constitution."
His remarks touched off a furious debate
and placed Prime Minister Zenko Suzuki in
an embarrassing position. Suzuki even
tually responded with the decision that it
was acceptable for his party to discuss the
issue but that he had no intention of pushing
for a revision.
Nevertheless, a special party committee
has been established to debate the merits of
revision and meets regularly, usually with
less than a majority present. And the Japan
Socialist Party, which still argues for a posi
tion of unarmed neutrality, considers the
latest moves to endorse and legitimize a
military force so important that it has made
opposition to revision its major 1981 task.
