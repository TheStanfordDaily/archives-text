# Senator to push for defense budget rise
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The new Republican
White House and Senate will deliver
higher defense spending first and bal
anced budgets second. Sen. John Tow
er (R-Texas) predicted yesterday in
viewing the future from his new per
spective as incoming chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
The new administration and Con
gress should start with a $3 billion ad
dition to the $157 billion fiscal 1981
Pentagon budget still on the Hill and
then move on to big increases every
year after that. Tower said.
Those annual increases should
range between 9 percent and 13
percent a year after allowing for infla
tion. Tower said in his first Washing
ton news conference since the Re
publicans won control of the Senate
last week. The increases Tower vowed
to press for stand in contrast to the 5
percent "real" growth President Jim
my Carter had promised to build into
Pentagon budgets.
Speedup?
Tower conceded that such large in
creases in military spending might
look like a speedup in the arms race
with the Soviet Union. But he argued
that willingness to run such a race
would improve chances of negotiating
a better strategic arms limitation
treaty than the pending one. SALT 11.
We're probably going to have to re
negotiate the whole thing." Tower
said of SALT II If he becomes chair
man of the Senate Armed Services
Committee as expected, he would be
influential in determining what kind of
arms control treaty would be con
sidered safe for the United States to
sign.
Focusing on another controversial
arms control issue. Tower predicted
— although he said there is no way he
can be certain — that Ronald Reagan
would favor production of the neutron
warhead for missiles deployed in Eu
rope. That warhead, designed to kill
troops without destroying as many
structures as existing nuclear war
heads. "would raise the threshold of
risk to the Soviets," Tower said.
'Five-year plan'
Looking at how much would be
enough for defense beyond the current
fiscal year. Tower said that the $1.25
trillion the Senate Budget Committee
has projected for the five-year period
of fiscal 1981 through 1985 "seems to
me to be ball-park." That Senate
projection calls for a $294 billion mili
tary budget by 1985. he noted.
Tower laid claim to a big slice of
that trillion dollars by saying that, as
committee chairman, he would press
for:
— Military pay: add at least 2
percent to the 11.7 percent raise mili
tary people received for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. Tower said
military pay should be raised to keep
"at least even with inflation in future
years." This is the only way to stem
the exodus of experienced people from
the services, he said.

— Supplemental appropriation: in
crease the pending Pentagon budget
for fiscal 1981 by "as much as $3
billion." With this money he would fi
nance pay raises for middle-grade
military people, reserve war stocks,
such as ammunition and spare parts,
and extra fuel burned by the Navy in
covering the Indian Ocean.
— New bomber: build a manned
penetrating bomber that would "prob
ably be a B-l derivative." President
Jimmy Carter canceled the Rockwell
B-l bomber on the grounds that cruise
missiles would have an easier time
penetrating the Soviet Union. But Con
gress. uncomfortable about relying on
the aged B-52 bomber fleet, has or
dered the Pentagon to recommend
some kind of new bomber by March 15.
1981. and have the first one flving bv
1987.
MX land missile: continue de
veloping this blockbuster without
"foreclosing an alternative basing
mode" to the current plan, which calls
for hauling the MX around the valleys
of Nevada and Utah.
— Trident II submarine missile:
send this missile to sea as a follow to
the Trident 1. just starting to be
deployed in U.S. submarines.
Fighter planes: produce more of
them than the Carter administration
planned.
— Navy shipbuilding: accelerate
the present pace.
Asked how Reagan could do all this
for defense and still balance the
budget. Tower replied. "We didn't put
budget balancing as our No. 1 prob
lem. We put national security first."
He said that budget balancing would
come "ultimately."
However, he predicted that the al
liance of Reagan and congressional
lawmakers favoring a strong national

defense would make the changes "in
an orderly way. •
Cuts to offset the increases in de
fense programs would have to come
from other agencies of government
"When Joe Califano admits to a waste
of $7 billion in HEW (the old Depart
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare) it must be twice that," Tower
said.
Even if the United States takes
Tower's advice and spends the $1 25
trillion over the next five years, the
senator warned against expecting this
investment to put the United Staies
ahead of the Soviet Union militarily.

heads. "would raise the threshold of
risk to the Soviets," Tower said.
'Five-year plan'
Looking at how much would be
enough for defense beyond the current
fiscal year. Tower said that the $1.25
trillion the Senate Budget Committee
has projected for the five-year period
of fiscal 1981 through 1985 "seems to
me to be ball-park." That Senate
projection calls for a $294 billion mili
tary budget by 1985. he noted.
Tower laid claim to a big slice of
that trillion dollars by saying that, as
committee chairman, he would press
for:
— Military pay: add at least 2
percent to the 11.7 percent raise mili
tary people received for the fiscal
year that began Oct. 1. Tower said
military pay should be raised to keep
"at least even with inflation in future
years." This is the only way to stem
the exodus of experienced people from
the services, he said.

— Supplemental appropriation: in
crease the pending Pentagon budget
for fiscal 1981 by "as much as $3
billion." With this money he would fi
nance pay raises for middle-grade
military people, reserve war stocks,
such as ammunition and spare parts,
and extra fuel burned by the Navy in
covering the Indian Ocean.
— New bomber: build a manned
penetrating bomber that would "prob
ably be a B-l derivative." President
Jimmy Carter canceled the Rockwell
B-l bomber on the grounds that cruise
missiles would have an easier time
penetrating the Soviet Union. But Con
gress. uncomfortable about relying on
the aged B-52 bomber fleet, has or

1987.
MX land missile: continue de
veloping this blockbuster without
"foreclosing an alternative basing
mode" to the current plan, which calls
for hauling the MX around the valleys
of Nevada and Utah.
— Trident II submarine missile:
send this missile to sea as a follow to
the Trident 1. just starting to be
deployed in U.S. submarines.
Fighter planes: produce more of
them than the Carter administration
planned.
— Navy shipbuilding: accelerate
the present pace.
Asked how Reagan could do all this
for defense and still balance the
budget. Tower replied. "We didn't put
budget balancing as our No. 1 prob
lem. We put national security first."
He said that budget balancing would
come "ultimately."
However, he predicted that the al
liance of Reagan and congressional
lawmakers favoring a strong national

defense would make the changes "in
an orderly way. •
Cuts to offset the increases in de
fense programs would have to come
from other agencies of government
"When Joe Califano admits to a waste
of $7 billion in HEW (the old Depart
ment of Health, Education and Wel
fare) it must be twice that," Tower
said.
Even if the United States takes
Tower's advice and spends the $1 25
trillion over the next five years, the
senator warned against expecting this
investment to put the United Staies
ahead of the Soviet Union militarily.
Washington — The new Republican
White House and Senate will deliver
higher defense spending first and bal
anced budgets second. Sen. John Tow
er (R-Texas) predicted yesterday in
viewing the future from his new per
spective as incoming chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
The new administration and Con
gress should start with a $3 billion ad
dition to the $157 billion fiscal 1981
Pentagon budget still on the Hill and
then move on to big increases every
year after that. Tower said.
Those annual increases should
range between 9 percent and 13
percent a year after allowing for infla
tion. Tower said in his first Washing
ton news conference since the Re
publicans won control of the Senate
last week. The increases Tower vowed
to press for stand in contrast to the 5
percent "real" growth President Jim
my Carter had promised to build into
Pentagon budgets.
Speedup?
Tower conceded that such large in
creases in military spending might
look like a speedup in the arms race
with the Soviet Union. But he argued
that willingness to run such a race
would improve chances of negotiating
a better strategic arms limitation
treaty than the pending one. SALT 11.
We're probably going to have to re
negotiate the whole thing." Tower
said of SALT II If he becomes chair
man of the Senate Armed Services
Committee as expected, he would be
influential in determining what kind of
arms control treaty would be con
sidered safe for the United States to
sign.
Focusing on another controversial
arms control issue. Tower predicted
— although he said there is no way he
can be certain — that Ronald Reagan
would favor production of the neutron
warhead for missiles deployed in Eu
rope. That warhead, designed to kill
troops without destroying as many
structures as existing nuclear war
heads. "would raise the threshold of
risk to the Soviets," Tower said.
