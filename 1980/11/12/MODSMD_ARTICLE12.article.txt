The more time we take to clarify our in
terests. the easier it will be to find a job," said
Connie Ordway last Thursday night at the first
of a series of five workshops for Women of the
World, a new organization here designed to
help women entering the career world.
The subject of this year's first workshop was
job searching. Connie Ordway from the CPPC
began by first asking audience members what
year and major they were and what they
planned to do with their future Out of a group
of about 40 women consisting of mostly sen
iors. nobody said she knew exactly what she
wanted to do; however, approximately half the
women said they had some ideas.
Ordway began her first exercise of the eve
ning by leading the audience through a "guided
fantasy." "The purpose of this exercise," she
said, "is to break us out of modes and roles so
ciety imposes upon us. " She instructed the par
ticipants to disregard any of their inhibitions
and create a fantasy in which they would
awaken five years from now in an environment
of their choice. She asked that they notice not
only where they were, but also who the people
were that were around them, and how they re
acted to this new environment.
She then asked. "Was it really your dream'.'
Or someone else's?" She added. "If you liked
it. what did you have to do to get there? If you
didn't like it. what could you do to change it?"
She continued to identify inhibitions by pos
ing questions as to why people hadn't begun
their job search. Some of the barriers Ordway
had already anticipated were a lack of time,
purpose, motivation and tools and approach.
She stated that "whichever category you fall
into, your lack of actions is just admitting that
you're not in control."
Another exercise she led required the partic
ipants to list 10 characteristics which they val
ued about themselves, and what was good
about each characteristic. In this self
assessment exercise, patterns of interests ap
peared. allowing women to see which jobs
would fit their interests best.
Ordway encouraged women to search out in
formation once they had identified their in
terests. She mentioned the CPPC Library,
Bowman Alumni House and Bechtel Interna
tional Center as possible job sources.
She also stressed the importance of obtain
ing information "not only in getting a job. but
also in having people get to know your face. It's
a good way to feel you have a grasp on some
thing," she added.
The second half of the workshop focused on
four guest speakers, who shared their career

experiences.
The first speaker. Wendy Gibson. Stanford
student development director, said, "just
being at Stanford is good You're doing some
thing constructive by just being around other
people that are job searching " She also
stressed that when looking for a job a woman
should first ask for a job description in order to
find out what the options within the job are and
in what directions it will take her.
Nancv Pettingi 11 from Keller and Gannon
Consulting firm in San Francisco said that af
ter having held two enginering jobs that were
not taking her in " ideal directions," she had,
nevertheless, gained experience and was more
productive in her current job because of her
previous work But she added. "You really
have to be honest with yourself. ... A situ
ation you can't handle will really be a trap."
Pettingill stressed that it was extremely im
portant to talk to people, especially those in
professional societies of small and medium
sized companies In these businesses, jobs can
only be obtained strictly bv word of mouth, she
said
Hilda Korner. employment manager of
SLAC. claimed she had had "eight careers so
far and still planned on a ninth." She main
tained a realistic view of the job market for
women by stating that women must realize
that competition is extremely strong
"There are always jobs, but you have to de
cide if you're willing to make the compromise
for that job." she said.
The last speaker. Margaret Moulton, a coun
selor and administrator for New Ways to
Work, advised people to "look at every job and
career you might take, and look at the impact
it will have. She said that although money is a
big issue, being at ease with one's conscience is
important. "Take hold of your values." she ad
vised.
Moulton warned that women have to face a
kind of dualism in the business world. "Men
will expect you to perform as they do and give
up your feminine characteristics." she said
"Don't give in to that," she concluded.
According to Yvonne Hiltz, a key organizer
of Women of the World and November Career
Month for women, the workshops are being
held this week and next on Mondays and
Thursdays at 7 p.m. in Meyer Library Forum
Room.
Originally a project of Kappa Kappa Gam
ma sorority two years ago, the workshops of
Women of the World have since acquired spon
sorship from the Inter-Sorority Council, ASSU
Senate, the Council of Presidents and the Ca
reer Planning and Placement Center (CPPC).
