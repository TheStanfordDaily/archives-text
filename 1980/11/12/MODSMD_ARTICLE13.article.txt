# Companies proposed to protect University patents

### Washington Post 
Washington — F'our years ago,
Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at UC-San
Francisco, realized that his then-obscure
field of genetic engineering might some
day have commercial application So he
and a colleague formed a small com
pany.
Today, their company — Genentech —
is worth $600 million. Boyer has more
than $70 million in stock, and other firms
getting ready to use Genentech proc
esses anticipate making millions of
dollars more.
But so far, the university in whose fa
cilities it all began has earned nothing. If
it does eventually benefit from the
Boyer-Genentech boom, it is unlikely to
be on the scale that others will.
Stories like these can be heard at
almost any major university research
center. And they are getting increasing
attention from administrators of these
centers, many of whom are chronically

short of funds and more inclined to feel
entitled to a better return on technolog
ical advances springing from their labo
ratories.
Until five years ago. Harvard never at
tempted to patent any of its research. It
was all freely available for exploitation
by companies without having to give
Harvard a penny. At the same time, its
professors could earn huge sums based
on work done in Harvard labs. In fact,
one biochemistry professor was recently
offered "millions of dollars, literally,"
he said, to work in a biotechnology com
pany.
Now. in what appears to be developing
as a national trend, big universities — in
cluding Harvard. Yale, MIT and Stan
ford — have decided to try to plug these
profit leaks and find new ways to make
money from their research.
But predictably, the desire for money
and the purity of scholarship have
clashed. At Harvard, a furious debate

has begun over the boldest of the univer
sity plans: to found a genetic engineering
company and earn profits from it. The
company would stand virtually on cam
pus and have Harvard faculty as some of
its officers and consulting researchers.
Opponents say a commercial under
taking such as Harvard's might "change
the whole character of the university,"
turning it into what Kingman Brewster,
a former president of Yale, called "ser
vice station academics" — research
with the aim of selling products or ser
vices to the public.
Those favoring Harvard's plan see it
as a good way to earn money from work
done by Harvard, as well as a way of
making basic research available quickly
to the public. Under the jargon title of
"technology transfer," the government
has been urging all universities to find
better ways to get their findings to in
dustry and the marketplace.
In general, many have said the univer

sitv's mission is to carry on scholarship,
its aims determined only by the excite
ment of the questions it raises. They fear
that linking a commercial enterprise to
the university could draw research off in
directions more profitable than scholar
lv.
Another objection is that the free ex
change of information that has charac
terized research would be altered by the
kind of secrecy necessary in bitterly
competitive commercial markets.
Under current plans, Harvard would
set up the company, then become a mi
nority stockholder. There would be a
close link between the biochemistry de
partment and the new company, with
some Harvard faculty becoming leading
officers and researchers in the company.
(Tomorrow's Daily will feature a story
nn the possibility that Stanford may set
up a corporation to manage its patent
rights.)
