## Idealism for the future 
### 
Many problems plague our
modern civilization today as in
the past, and most are not new
As a species, we continue to
wrestle with such dilemmas as
war, political strife, famine,
crime, and human suffering, all
of which influenced our an
cestors back to the beginning of
recorded history. Our apparent
failure to successfully deal with
these obstacles to human
progress results from several
factors.
First and foremost is a seem
ing inability of homo sapiens to
learn from previous mistakes.
For example, human history
contains no account of weapons
of war which were constructed
on a massive scale but never
used. Yet. despite our guarded
acceptance of the belief that
man's sane judgement would
not permit a nuclear war to oc
cur. world governments con
tinue to build and test atomic
weapons under the false pre
tense that their intent is to pre
serve peace. A more wise ap
proach would be an attempt to
understand and correct the rea
son for our senseless self-decep
tion. Certainly our reason for
existence is not ultimate non-ex
istence.
A second important factor is
mankind's failure to solve basic
human problems lies in the fact
that we have never had a mean
ingful. defined goal. As our
world has become increasingly
complex, we have created and
solved many less important
dilemmas, without clearly de
lineating where we are going or
want to go. In the process, we
have lost sight of the forest due
to the trees.
Unregulated growth of the
world's population continually
challenges our attempts to im
prove the quality of the already
existing human lives on the
planet, the limits of which will
inevitably be tested. The ob
vious alternatives are an over
crowded world where the ma
jority have their wants unmet
vs. enforced population control;
unquestionably, the latter

would be a less troubled, albeit
less free, civilization
Fear of change
A third factor contributing to
human impotence in dealing
with basic problems is an ap
parent fear of change. Consider
the American political system
as an example. For nearly two
decades, the two-party elec
toral system has failed to pro
vide an effective, confidence-in
spiring national leader. Laws
are passed according to meth
ods adopted over 200 years ago.
when the country was young,
slower-paced and small The
success of our judicial system is
perhaps best delineated by the
fact that Sirhan Sirhan. who ma
liciously gunned down Robert
Kennedy before hundreds of
witnesses, will be roaming the
streets again in just 3 years.
It may be stated with some
confidence that even if better
methods were designed for con
ducting important social and po
litical activities, their adoption
into practice would be difficult
and unlikely. Unfortunately,
those who fear change to the
greatest degree are those in the
most favorable positions to
bring it about.
Human progress would be
vastly facilitated if we were
able to discard our caution in
trying new and perhaps un
orthodox methods on large
scale situations. The working
American woman has created a
new social problem: the neg
lected child. Simultaneously,
our fast-moving lifestyle has
left behind one very important
social group: the elderly.
Here is one example where
two problems might be mutual
ly solved. Millions of retired
citizens, experienced in child
care from raising their own. live
today in America with seeming
ly no life purpose. Many would
benefit psychologically from
the opportunity to care for a
youngster whose mother chose
to spend her days with a career,
perhaps for little or no wages.
Having received proper at
tention and stimulation as chil

dren. these better-adjusted
adolescents might then be ex
pected to serve as part time af
ter-school aids for the elderly
and crippled Provided with
such a purpose .these individ
uals will be left with a greater
understanding and respect for
adult goals and ideals, rather
than roaming the streets and
getting into trouble.
Current dilemmas
The same principle may be
applied to virtually all current
national or international dilem
mas. Every day. thousands of
San Jose commuters spend over
two hours behind the wheel to
get to and from their jobs in San
Francisco, while equal numbers
do the opposite on the other side
of the freeway. Time and
gasoline are wasted, personal
stress is created, the environ
ment is polluted, and traffic is
increased
Suppose that a job or resi
dence trade agency were estab
lished. so that individuals could
live closer to their place of em
ployment. perhaps within bicy
cling distance. Two happier,
healthier individuals with more
time to devote to constructive
pursuits would result.
Such proposals admittedly
sound idealistic, but perhaps
this is the attitude which we des
perately need to adopt in the
future. The decision-makers of
our species have traditionally
been those with "experience."
However, a tragic price is paid
in obtaining this entity, in that
conforming with accepted
methods and policies is a neces
sary accompaniment.
Our past and continuing fail
ures are an indication for
greater acceptance of new ideas
advanced by younger, less ex
perienced. but more concerned
minds. Simultaneously, how
ever. we need to recognize that
progress is only progress if it is
controlled, and utilized to the
benefit of all men.

our species have traditionally
been those with "experience."
However, a tragic price is paid
in obtaining this entity, in that
conforming with accepted
methods and policies is a neces
sary accompaniment.
Our past and continuing fail
ures are an indication for
greater acceptance of new ideas
advanced by younger, less ex
perienced. but more concerned
minds. Simultaneously, how
ever. we need to recognize that
progress is only progress if it is
controlled, and utilized to the
benefit of all men.
(David Sartoris is an intern in
diagnostic radiology.)
Many problems plague our
modern civilization today as in
the past, and most are not new
As a species, we continue to
wrestle with such dilemmas as
war, political strife, famine,
crime, and human suffering, all
of which influenced our an
cestors back to the beginning of
recorded history. Our apparent
failure to successfully deal with
these obstacles to human
progress results from several
factors.
First and foremost is a seem
ing inability of homo sapiens to
learn from previous mistakes.
For example, human history
contains no account of weapons
of war which were constructed
on a massive scale but never
used. Yet. despite our guarded
acceptance of the belief that
man's sane judgement would
not permit a nuclear war to oc
cur. world governments con
tinue to build and test atomic
weapons under the false pre
tense that their intent is to pre
serve peace. A more wise ap
proach would be an attempt to
understand and correct the rea
son for our senseless self-decep
tion. Certainly our reason for
existence is not ultimate non-ex
istence.
A second important factor is
mankind's failure to solve basic
human problems lies in the fact
that we have never had a mean
ingful. defined goal. As our
world has become increasingly
complex, we have created and
solved many less important
dilemmas, without clearly de
lineating where we are going or
want to go. In the process, we
have lost sight of the forest due
to the trees.
Unregulated growth of the
world's population continually
challenges our attempts to im
prove the quality of the already
existing human lives on the
planet, the limits of which will
inevitably be tested. The ob
vious alternatives are an over
crowded world where the ma
jority have their wants unmet
vs. enforced population control;
unquestionably, the latter

would be a less troubled, albeit
less free, civilization
Fear of change
A third factor contributing to
human impotence in dealing
with basic problems is an ap
parent fear of change. Consider
the American political system
as an example. For nearly two
decades, the two-party elec
toral system has failed to pro
vide an effective, confidence-in
spiring national leader. Laws
are passed according to meth
ods adopted over 200 years ago.
when the country was young,
slower-paced and small The
success of our judicial system is
perhaps best delineated by the
fact that Sirhan Sirhan. who ma
liciously gunned down Robert
Kennedy before hundreds of
witnesses, will be roaming the
streets again in just 3 years.
It may be stated with some
confidence that even if better
methods were designed for con
ducting important social and po
litical activities, their adoption
into practice would be difficult
and unlikely. Unfortunately,
those who fear change to the
greatest degree are those in the
most favorable positions to
bring it about.
Human progress would be
vastly facilitated if we were
able to discard our caution in
trying new and perhaps un
orthodox methods on large
scale situations. The working
American woman has created a
new social problem: the neg
lected child. Simultaneously,
our fast-moving lifestyle has
left behind one very important
social group: the elderly.
Here is one example where
two problems might be mutual
ly solved. Millions of retired
citizens, experienced in child
care from raising their own. live
today in America with seeming
ly no life purpose. Many would
benefit psychologically from
the opportunity to care for a
youngster whose mother chose
to spend her days with a career,
perhaps for little or no wages.
Having received proper at
tention and stimulation as chil

dren. these better-adjusted
adolescents might then be ex
pected to serve as part time af
ter-school aids for the elderly
and crippled Provided with
such a purpose .these individ
uals will be left with a greater
understanding and respect for
adult goals and ideals, rather
than roaming the streets and
getting into trouble.
Current dilemmas
The same principle may be
applied to virtually all current
national or international dilem
mas. Every day. thousands of
San Jose commuters spend over
two hours behind the wheel to
get to and from their jobs in San
Francisco, while equal numbers
do the opposite on the other side
of the freeway. Time and
gasoline are wasted, personal
stress is created, the environ
ment is polluted, and traffic is
increased
Suppose that a job or resi
dence trade agency were estab
lished. so that individuals could
live closer to their place of em
ployment. perhaps within bicy
cling distance. Two happier,
healthier individuals with more
time to devote to constructive
pursuits would result.
Such proposals admittedly
sound idealistic, but perhaps
this is the attitude which we des
perately need to adopt in the
future. The decision-makers of
our species have traditionally
been those with "experience."
