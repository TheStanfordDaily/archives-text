## Commoner's full of biomass 
### 
I thank Paul Ashin. DeWitt
Durham and peter Stromberg
for inquiring into the evidence
on Barrv Commoner (Daily,
Nov. 4). as I did not have room
to include it into my column of
Oct. 22.
The factual background for
my views is set forth in an arti
cle in the November edition of
Reason magazine. In it, I give
an eyewitness account of Com
moner's various scientific mis
demeanors at the last conven
tion of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Sci
ence. including the instance of
"fraudulent misrepresenta
tion" referred to in my column.
Briefly, what happened is
this. I asked Commoner what
grounds he had for claiming that
energy prices rise "exponen
tially." He replied by referring
me to some oil price projections
from a National Petroleum
Council report, a graph from
which he had reproduced as an
exhibit for his talk. The graph
showed some curves which
looked vaguely but arguably ex
ponential. but which I later dis
covered were not — a fact that
was perfectly evident from the
report's text.
A detailed examination of the
technical flaws in Commoner's
energy plan may be found in
Samuel McCracken's article in
Commentary, October 1979. I
should add that at least three or
four major flaws are mentioned
in my column, a fact which
seems to have been evident to
the editors of the Daily, if not
Messrs. Ashin. Durham and
Stromberg.
Had my critics read my col
umn more carefully, they would
have noted that I did not accuse

Commoner of being a vulgar
Marxist. Rather. I accused him
of not knowing any economics
beyond vulgar Marxism. In fact.
Commoner has admitted to not
having taken a course in college
economics. Furthermore, his
attempts to provide a theory of
energy economics in his book.
The Poverty of Power, were vir
tually demolished by Kenneth
Boulding's scathing critique, re
printed in Coevolution Quarter
ly, Summer 1977.
Boulding. a celebrated fore
father of environmental eco
nomics, who is scarcely known
for harsh words, described
Commoner's book as "very
bad" and "dishonest, adding
that it could do a great deal of
harm." Similar views have been
expressed by Prof. John
Holdren. a noted soft energy ad
vocate from Berkeley who. in a
lecture at Stanford last year,
joked "Commoner's program is
full of biomass."
As for Commoner's views on
ecology, I would refer to
Holdren and Erlich's powerful
critique of Commoners book.
The Closing Circle, which ap
peared in The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists ("One-
Dimensional Ecolog\," Ma\
1972).
I have interviewed several
people who are familiar with
Commoner's scientific work,
and the best 1 have heard is that
he is not well respected. The
worst has included accusations
of misrepresentation, evasion,
distortion, and trying to take
credit for the work of others.
If my critics will examine the
evidence, I think they will find
that every adjective in my col

umn is founded in fact. As to
who is the demagogue, myself
or Commoner. I would ask who
it is who went to the public for
votes, who tried to extract polit
ical advantage from his public
prestige as a scientist, who
chose to pontificate in fields
where he had no expertise? It
was not I who started it.

I thank Paul Ashin. DeWitt
Durham and peter Stromberg
for inquiring into the evidence
on Barrv Commoner (Daily,
Nov. 4). as I did not have room
to include it into my column of
Oct. 22.
The factual background for
my views is set forth in an arti
cle in the November edition of
Reason magazine. In it, I give
an eyewitness account of Com
moner's various scientific mis
demeanors at the last conven
tion of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Sci
ence. including the instance of
"fraudulent misrepresenta
tion" referred to in my column.
Briefly, what happened is
this. I asked Commoner what
grounds he had for claiming that
energy prices rise "exponen
tially." He replied by referring
me to some oil price projections
from a National Petroleum
Council report, a graph from
which he had reproduced as an
exhibit for his talk. The graph
showed some curves which
looked vaguely but arguably ex
ponential. but which I later dis
covered were not — a fact that
was perfectly evident from the
report's text.
A detailed examination of the
technical flaws in Commoner's
energy plan may be found in
Samuel McCracken's article in
Commentary, October 1979. I
should add that at least three or
four major flaws are mentioned
in my column, a fact which
seems to have been evident to
the editors of the Daily, if not
Messrs. Ashin. Durham and
Stromberg.
Had my critics read my col
umn more carefully, they would
have noted that I did not accuse

Commoner of being a vulgar
Marxist. Rather. I accused him
of not knowing any economics
beyond vulgar Marxism. In fact.
Commoner has admitted to not
having taken a course in college
economics. Furthermore, his
attempts to provide a theory of
energy economics in his book.
The Poverty of Power, were vir
tually demolished by Kenneth
Boulding's scathing critique, re
printed in Coevolution Quarter
ly, Summer 1977.
Boulding. a celebrated fore
father of environmental eco
nomics, who is scarcely known
for harsh words, described
Commoner's book as "very
bad" and "dishonest, adding
that it could do a great deal of
harm." Similar views have been
expressed by Prof. John
Holdren. a noted soft energy ad
vocate from Berkeley who. in a
lecture at Stanford last year,
joked "Commoner's program is
full of biomass."
As for Commoner's views on
ecology, I would refer to
Holdren and Erlich's powerful
critique of Commoners book.
The Closing Circle, which ap
peared in The Bulletin of the
Atomic Scientists ("One-
Dimensional Ecolog\," Ma\
1972).
I have interviewed several
people who are familiar with
Commoner's scientific work,
and the best 1 have heard is that
he is not well respected. The
worst has included accusations
of misrepresentation, evasion,
distortion, and trying to take
credit for the work of others.
If my critics will examine the
evidence, I think they will find
that every adjective in my col

umn is founded in fact. As to
who is the demagogue, myself
or Commoner. I would ask who
it is who went to the public for
votes, who tried to extract polit
ical advantage from his public
prestige as a scientist, who
chose to pontificate in fields
where he had no expertise? It
was not I who started it.
