## Landslide? It was a cakewalk 
### 
The moment I saw it, I knew I
had to have a piece. Two smiling
co-celebratOrs brought it out on
stage right after Reagan's vic
tory speech at the Century
Plaza hotel in Los Angeles. I had
watched television since voting
that afternoon, swearing I
wouldn't write a column on the
election. I knew it'd be too easy
to take cheap shots at either
winner. But when that cake
flashed across the screen behind
the candidate-elect. I wanted
my chance at a slice of history.
And I knew I'd have to act fast.
I was out of my chair and into
the kitchen in less time than it
took NBC to call the election. On
the phone, my friend in Los An
geles said she knew what I
wanted. She had seen the whole
thing on television, too. I asked
her to describe the cake for me.
Our television set is about draft
age. Purchased at the height of
the Quemoy and Matsu crisis,
the picture has got that peculiar
early-model fuzziness and black
and white indistinctness that
makes every presidential de
bate look like Nixon and Ken
nedy.

Consequently, I hadn't got
ten a very good impression of
anything about the cake but its
size. Monica confirmed my sus
picion that there was a map of
the United States drawn in red
on a four by five foot cake cov
ered with white icing. There
was a candle and a flag planted
firmly inside the boundaries of
each state. Neither of us were
sure, but I thought I'd noticed
that the candles in the few
states that were going for
Carter were unlit.
PSA strike or not. I had to get
down to Los Angeles that night
and get some of that cake. I
found a flight which, allowing
me time to rent a car at the air
port. would get me to Reagan's
victory celebration at the Cen
tury Plaza by 11 p.m. I didn't
think my Daily press pass would
get me close enough to the cake
to find out which room it was in.
Monica promised to try a
friend for some convincing
looking UPI passes that we'd
used a few times before. In any
event, she absolutely positively
knew she had been given tickets
to the main ballroom but had

tossed them somewhere with no
intention of going, and it was
just a matter of finding them. I
told her I'd see her in the Cen
tury Plaza lobby as soon as I
could get there.
I knew the fight would be
booked, so I called ahead for
reservations. Ever since that
night at the Red Carpet Room in
Kansas City when, under cir
cumstances better left un
disclosed. I discovered that the
number on John Connally's
American Express card was
only one digit different from
mine, I've had no problem with
overbooked flights.
Still, the best I could do was a
plane crowded with ecstatic Re
agan supporters. The first class
section looked like a cross be
tween a drunken country club
outing and a kindergarten re
cess. Christ, I thought to my
self. if this is what the plane is
like, the party at the Century
Plaza where everyone's been
drinking since midafternoon
should be a real zoo. I plugged
my earphones into Eerrant and
Teicher and looked out the win
dow the entire flight.
I wondered about the cake.
My roommates were certain it
was devil's food, but I wasn't
willing to be so cynical. At the
moment. I realized that to have
that cake would be to have an
edible piece of history that
would make my collection of
"Nixon Now'' pale by com
parison. It was a kind of wed
ding cake, celebrating a new un
ion of conservatism and na
tional leadership, of President
Ronald Reagan and the country.
The full horror of this image
didn't visit me until Chalk's
"morning after" cartoon a few
days later, but even if it had I
would still have wanted a tan
gible and sweet reminder of
what the countrv had done.

Monica had been able to get
the UPI counterfeits. She had
also scouted around to find out
who was going to eat the cake,
and where. Big as it was, it was
too small to offer the hungry
crowd of Right-to-Lifers, arms
dealers and General Electric
tvpees drunk with victory and
cheap punch in the main
ballroom. Monica had played a
hunch that it was in the room
with Reagan's private party.
She found a Reagan security
man who had played football at
her high school guarding the
door, and he admitted as much.
The same security geek was
not so willing to let the two of us
anywhere near the room as he
was to give information to
Monica alone. We spent half an
hour alternately cursing, teas
ing. and cajoling him before
some Osmond-like YAFer over
heard us and broke the news.
With the kind of gleeful grin that
only the self righteous who be
lieve they've just been proven
right seem to have, he said that
the cake was gone. The last few
pieces had just been sent by air
courier to Bush's celebration in
Houston.
Dejected, Monica and I drove
home along Wilshire Boulevard.
I had never liked Bush, and now
that preppie playing cowboy had
gotten the last slices and made
my whole trip futile. I swore I'd
tear the crocodile off the next
LaCoste shirt I saw. Monica put
a Jackson Browne tape on the
car stereo and gradually calmed
me down. About the time the
tape got to the final strains of
"The Pretender," we pulled
into a Winchell's and bought a
box of donut holes for breakfast.
