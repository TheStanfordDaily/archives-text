## From ignorance to intellect 
### 
I beg to differ with Teresa
Butzerin's article {Daily, Oct.
24) in which she said that the
Physics 50 series would make as
good a requirement as Western
Culture. I don't think that
Western Culture is better than
physics but. rather. I think it has
a different area of usefulness.
Physics is a discipline in
which one learns the develop
ment and the structure of the
present model of the universe.
Implicit in the presentation of
such a discipline is the idea that
this scientific model explains
what is "out there - ' and what is
"true" in the universe. A stu
dent may fail to recognize that
the theory which is presented is
just a model, a model which
happens to be the simplest one
for the empirical knowledge
available.
In Western Culture, one
focuses on the relationship of
the'culture at large to the pure
and practical sciences of the
day and on the breakdown of
these mutual ties during scien

tific and cultural revolutions.
By pure and practical sciences.
I mean not just physical sci
ences but also social sciences,
e.g., anthropology, psychology,
sociology, economics, business,
law, etc.
These were the sciences of
yesteryear (and to a certain ex
tent still today) that propounded
the "self-evident" fact of the in
feriority of women. This at
titude was not considered a
model for social relations but
rather a self-evident, that's-the
way-it.-is fact. On the other
hand, we must be careful not to
discuss the issue of the equality
of the sexes as if it were a self
evident fact either. This at
titude is also a model for social
relations.
I am in favor of this model be
cause I think it will bring forth
more humanized conditions,
i.e., freedom of self-develop
ment. to more people. Abstract
equality is not important and it
should not be our goal. I recog
nize that this is a value
judgment on my part.
As to the issue of the require
ments, Butzerin states that a

classical liberal education pro
vides an ignorant person the
knowledge to be a great intellec
tual so why require everyone to
attain such a level of achieve
ment. Implicit in this statement
is the fundamental mistake in
an approach to Westren Culture.
As Nietzsche points out in The
Use and the Abuse of History
(which I read in Western Cul
ture ) a life devoted to the attain
ment of historical knowledge is
an abuse of history and. there
fore, requiring everyone to
memorize certain historical
facts gives a nation a false sense
of cultural activity. One should
use historical knowledge as a
basis for reflections on ways of
living. It is in this sense that
everyone can benefit from the
exposure to Western Culture. It
is in the specialized, pure sci
ences that the knowledge at its
face value is of primary im
portance in the development of
the techniques for practical sci
ences. It is also the area in
which freedom to develop the
knowledge and the skill in the
field of one's choice is essential.
