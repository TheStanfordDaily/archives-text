Water balloons
This letter is in reference to
the unfortunate incident occur
ring in the Stanford student sec
tion at Saturday's USC game. It
seems that two fine Stanford
gentlemen were denied their
right of freedom of speech after
being evicted by a "S.W.A.T.-
like" force of Stanford Aux
illiary Special Events Police,
for merely catapulting water
balloons in an onslaught against
the most obnoxious marching

troop in the country.
To the men, we are proud of
you. To the Stanford police, how
are you going to protect yourself
from claims of false arrest
when 7000 Stanford students are
"certain" that you got the
wrong guys . . . ? Keep flingin'
guys, we're with you.
