# Mass media's influence 'dangerous,' says Golay
## 
### Jan Mireles 
Concern that over-communication
in the mass media may be "danger
ous" to individuals and society as a
whole was the principal topic dis
cussed yesterday in a lecture entitled
"Over-Communication: A Case Study
in Switzerland of the Intrusion of TV
and Radio on Society" presented by
guest speaker Jean-Pierre Golay.
More than 50 persons gathered at
the Bechtel International Center to
hear Golay speak about the influence
the media possess.
Golay. Head of the Centre of In
troduction to Cinema in Lausanne,
Switzerland, told the audience that
over-communication presents danger
on two levels — individuals' and socie
ty s ability to cope with reality.
Golay used the term "consistency"
to describe the pacifying effect the
media can have on the consciousness
of a person. He pa railed the level of
consistency present today to that ex
ercised bv the Nazi regime in 1938.
Golay attributed much of society's
desire for consistency to the patterns
established by television programs.
Forget real world
"On the personal level, if you are
addicted to television you don't relate
to the real world with all your person
ality. On the other level the danger is
related more to society and their
growing dependency on consistency,"
explained Golay.
In his lecture, Golay outlined the
different levels of interaction in me
dia. stressing the need to maintain au
tonomy from programming and to
maintain the ability to see discrepan
cies in programming presented.
He explained that when an individ

ual can view television and live vicari
ously through the experiences of the
characters, the individual can become
numb to reality over a period of time.
If the experience is pleasureable. the
process is more firmly reinforced.
Inconsistencies
Discrepancies require the individ
ual to face reality, whereas consistent
or "comfortable" programs allow the
individual to close out reality.
"An individual can avoid discrepan
cy by devoting more time to channels
that are consistent and promote con
tinuity," said Golay.
Golay questioned whether or not
"the process by which we improve ac
curacy in reality is biased if we avoid
discrepancy."
Critical of media
Golay says that at the Centre of In
troduction to Cinema, a 12-year old
creation of the Swiss Ministry of
Education, instructors are teaching
pupils of all ages to be critical of the
different media and welcome the op
portunity to evaluate discrepancies.
Students at the center participate in
a variety of media activities, such as
criticizing and creating films or
analyzing television programming.
Children meet with filmmakers and
producers to learn about the film and
television process. "We want children
to know TV is made by somebody."
said Golay.
"The major purpose of the in
stitute," he said, "is to help the people
save some autonomy when they deal
with the mass media."
The lecture was part of the continu
ing Tuesday luncheon series at
Bechtel International Center.
