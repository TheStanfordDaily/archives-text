# Air command warns against Soviets

### 
Washington (AP) — Air Force officers
concerned with defense of the continental
United States say the United States' shield
against a Soviet bomber attack has been
weakened over the past 15 years, to the point
where the country could be in serious trou
ble if Russia builds a major bomber force.
The North American Air Defense Com
mand puts it in less stark terms, saying that
"bomber defenses . . . are now geared to
guard against only a limited bomber at
tack."
NOR AD says this defensive system "suf
fers from high operating costs, vulner
ability to attack and coverage deficien
cies."
The stripping of U.S. air defenses to a thin

shield of old jet interceptors and obsoles
cent radar has gone virtually unnoticed.
"We're going to be in trouble in the
1980s," said one air defense specialist who
predicted the Russians will build several
hundred new Backfire bombers. The
Backfire, which the Russians contend is a
medium-range plane unintended for use
against the United States, has been a source
of concern for U.S. military officials since it
appeared in the mid-19705.
The thinning out of U.S. defenses against
Soviet bombers began in 19H4 when Pen
tagon officials concluded that the Russian
bomber threat feared in the 1950s had never
developed, and that the main menace to the
United States came from a growing force of
Soviet missiles.

The Soviet long-range bomber force nev
er did reach over 200 planes until the
Backfire appeared, but Air Force in
telligence experts are convinced the Rus
sians are working on an even more ad
vanced bomber that could appear by the
mid-1980s.
In the early 19605, the United States had
more than 1500 regular Air Force and Air
National Guard planes assigned to defend
the continental United States against Soviet
bomber attack. That total is now down to
about 320 aircraft, many dating of 1950s vin
tage.
In the intervening years, the United
States has also removed all batteries of
Army Hawk and Nike antiaircraft missiles
and has retired many ground radar posts.
