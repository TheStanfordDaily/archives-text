## Reagan may revise MX plan 
### 
Salt Lake City (AP) — Al
ready on shaky ground due to
spiraling costs and stiff opposi
tion in Utah and Nevada, the
MX missile system proposed by
the outgoing Carter adminis
tration appears headed for an
overhaul by incoming President
Ronald Reagan and his ad
visers.
"I'm not going to be tied to
it,"' said William Van Cleave,
Reagan's senior defense ad
viser and spokesman on MX
matters.
His boss, in a campaign ap
pearance this summer, prom
ised a full-scale review of the
MX if he were elected. Reagan
carried both Nevada and Utah
with ease in last week's elec
tion.
The first MX missiles would
not be deployed until 1986, and

that s if the project proceeds on
schedule. President Jimmy
Carter's proposal was devised
with SALT II in mind, but
SALT'S chances for Senate pas
sage were poor even before Re
publicans won control there.
The Carter administration
has proposed basing 200 MX
missiles on tracks to be shuttled
among 4600 shelters dug into the
vast desert of Utah and Nevada
— a space which would cover
the combined areas of Vermont,
New Hampshire. Massachu
setts, Connecticut and Rhode Is
land.
Huge trucks would haul the
95-ton missiles, each of which
would carry 10 warheads 100
times more explosive than the
bombs dropped on Japan in 1945,
along 8500 miles of heavy-duty
roads as yet unbuilt.
Cost estimates of Carter's
proposal range from the Pen
tagon's figure of $33.8 billion to
$68 billion by the General Ac
counting Office to more than
$100 billion in other quarters.
Air Force Brig. Gen. Guy
Hecker has called the MX
"man's largest project, larger
than the Great Wall, larger than
the Pyramids, larger than the
Alaska Pipeline or the Panama
Canal."
That's what bothers the peo
ple of Utah and Nevada.
Residents in eight Nevada
counties affected by the MX ov
erwhelmingly rejected the
project in a referendum vote
Nov. 4.
Utah's MX coordinator. Ken
Olson, said he fears the project
would dot the desert with trailer

camps, swell the welfare rolls
and send inflation soaring.
In Utah alone, it is estimated
the MX project would draw at
least 125,000 jobseekers and de
pendents — many of whom
would not be able to get MX jobs
— to a rural area now home to
about HO.OOO people who work
mostly in mining and agricul
ture.
Olson points to the Alaska
Pipeline project as an example
of what Utah and Nevada can
expect. The government told
Alaska to expect 5500 workers.
In the end, there were 22,500.
MX opponents say the
enormous construction project
would strain the two states' al
ready precarious water supply
and lower air quality to levels
below Clean Air Act standards,
preventing other projects from
being undertaken.
Oil shale, coal, uranium and
more than 90 percent of the
country's tar sands are located
in Utah, where the government
wants to develop synthetic
fuels.
Utah Gov. Scott Matheson. in
a recent speech to the Utah Min
ing Association, said, "The
State of Utah cannot be a major
source of energy growth . . .
while at the same time serving
as a national sacrifice area for
deployment of the MX missile."
Mining is even more impor
tant to Nevada, where Gov.
Robert List said of the MX: "I
just wish they could put it some
where else, and 1 wish they
would."
Van Cleave has said he is
looking at the possibility of

modifying existing Minuteman
HI silos to hold MX missiles.
Matheson. who says he talks
with Van Cleave two or three
times a week, also believes it
would be cheaper and quicker to
deploy the MX missiles in
Minuteman 111 silos.
The Air Force's environmen
tal impact statement on the MX
— due last July — is still not in
sight although the Pentagon is
now projecting it for sometime
in December
Matheson said Under
secretary of Defense William
Perry promised him the impact
statement would deal with al
ternatives to the MX
But in a recent speech. \ir
Force Chief of Stall Gen Lew
Allen said. "The time for debate
regarding the MX is past, the
search for alternatives is over
Further delay in fielding the
MX will jeopardize national se
curity. provide a rash of costly,
unsatisfactory alternatives and
lead ultimately to less capabili
ty at greater cost."
The Air Force says its en
vironmental statement will con
sider the "split-basing option,
whereby the Air Force deploys
half the missiles in Utah and Ne
vada and half in Texas and New
Mexico.
But Pentagon officials al
ready have said that would add
at least $3 billion to the cost be
cause it would have to buy
private land. In Utah and Ne
vada. the federal government
already owns the land.
For that reason. Olson said.
"I just can't imagine the Air
Force doing it."

tion in Utah and Nevada, the
MX missile system proposed by
the outgoing Carter adminis
tration appears headed for an
overhaul by incoming President
Ronald Reagan and his ad
visers.
"I'm not going to be tied to
it,"' said William Van Cleave,
Reagan's senior defense ad
viser and spokesman on MX
matters.
His boss, in a campaign ap
pearance this summer, prom
ised a full-scale review of the
MX if he were elected. Reagan
carried both Nevada and Utah
with ease in last week's elec
tion.
The first MX missiles would
not be deployed until 1986, and

that s if the project proceeds on
schedule. President Jimmy
Carter's proposal was devised
with SALT II in mind, but
SALT'S chances for Senate pas
sage were poor even before Re
publicans won control there.
The Carter administration
has proposed basing 200 MX
missiles on tracks to be shuttled
among 4600 shelters dug into the
vast desert of Utah and Nevada
— a space which would cover
the combined areas of Vermont,
New Hampshire. Massachu
setts, Connecticut and Rhode Is
land.
Huge trucks would haul the
95-ton missiles, each of which
would carry 10 warheads 100
times more explosive than the
bombs dropped on Japan in 1945,
along 8500 miles of heavy-duty
roads as yet unbuilt.
Cost estimates of Carter's
proposal range from the Pen
tagon's figure of $33.8 billion to
$68 billion by the General Ac
counting Office to more than
$100 billion in other quarters.
Air Force Brig. Gen. Guy
Hecker has called the MX
"man's largest project, larger
than the Great Wall, larger than
the Pyramids, larger than the
Alaska Pipeline or the Panama
Canal."
That's what bothers the peo
ple of Utah and Nevada.
Residents in eight Nevada
counties affected by the MX ov
erwhelmingly rejected the
project in a referendum vote
Nov. 4.
Utah's MX coordinator. Ken
Olson, said he fears the project
would dot the desert with trailer

camps, swell the welfare rolls
and send inflation soaring.
In Utah alone, it is estimated
the MX project would draw at
least 125,000 jobseekers and de
pendents — many of whom
would not be able to get MX jobs
— to a rural area now home to
about HO.OOO people who work
mostly in mining and agricul
ture.
Olson points to the Alaska
Pipeline project as an example
of what Utah and Nevada can
expect. The government told
Alaska to expect 5500 workers.
In the end, there were 22,500.
MX opponents say the
enormous construction project
would strain the two states' al
ready precarious water supply
and lower air quality to levels
below Clean Air Act standards,
preventing other projects from
being undertaken.
Oil shale, coal, uranium and
more than 90 percent of the
country's tar sands are located
in Utah, where the government
wants to develop synthetic
fuels.
Utah Gov. Scott Matheson. in
a recent speech to the Utah Min
ing Association, said, "The
State of Utah cannot be a major
source of energy growth . . .
while at the same time serving
as a national sacrifice area for
deployment of the MX missile."
Mining is even more impor
tant to Nevada, where Gov.
Robert List said of the MX: "I
just wish they could put it some
where else, and 1 wish they
would."
Van Cleave has said he is
looking at the possibility of

modifying existing Minuteman
HI silos to hold MX missiles.
Matheson. who says he talks
with Van Cleave two or three
times a week, also believes it
would be cheaper and quicker to
deploy the MX missiles in
Minuteman 111 silos.
The Air Force's environmen
tal impact statement on the MX
— due last July — is still not in
sight although the Pentagon is
now projecting it for sometime
in December

secretary of Defense William
Perry promised him the impact
statement would deal with al
ternatives to the MX

Force Chief of Stall Gen Lew
Allen said. "The time for debate
regarding the MX is past, the

Further delay in fielding the
MX will jeopardize national se
curity. provide a rash of costly,
unsatisfactory alternatives and
lead ultimately to less capabili
ty at greater cost."
The Air Force says its en
vironmental statement will con
sider the "split-basing option,
whereby the Air Force deploys
half the missiles in Utah and Ne
vada and half in Texas and New
Mexico.
But Pentagon officials al
ready have said that would add
at least $3 billion to the cost be
cause it would have to buy
private land. In Utah and Ne
vada. the federal government
already owns the land.
For that reason. Olson said.
"I just can't imagine the Air
Force doing it."
