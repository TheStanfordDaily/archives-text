### Bill Beyda 
Preventing Stanford from en
tering a tie for first place, the
UOP Tigers swept past the
Cardinals' women's volleyball
team last night 13-15, 15-1, 15-3
and 15-10 This puts the Tigers
two games ahead of the second
place Cards. The Tigers' NorCal
Conference record is now 10-0,
while Stanford dropped to 8-2 in
league play.

As the pre-game pep talk was
given by Stanford coach Fred
Sturm, a fan shouted "Baker's
hurt!" Freshmen Julie Baker,
who was performing outstand
ingly in the warm-ups a moment
earlier, was now sitting on the
bench, her ankle wrapped
"Julie got hurt in warm-ups."
said assistant coach Don Shaw.
"She twisted her ankle. This re
ally hurt us because we depend
on our outside hitters. Julie is
another one of our guns we like
to put in when we want to turn
the tide of the match."
Baker's injury was the begin
ning of a long night for the

Cardinals. The first game was
very close, with lead changing
hands several times. Finally,
with UOP ahead 12-10, Stanford
scored four straight points on
outstanding serving by
freshman Kerry Stuhr. After a
UOF point and five side-outs,
Stanford won the game 15-13.
The second and third games
were easily won by UOP, 15-1
and 15-3. "UOP played well
when they had to play well,"
Shaw said. "Perhaps we were
too tight, too up for this game."
UOP's blockers were outstan
ding, but "this is expected of
UOP," according to Shaw. "It's
their defensive strength in the
back line that was a surprise to
night." The Tigers turned back
spike after spike the Cardinals
hit.
The fourth game was also
close, and once again Stuhr
sparked the team with her serve
to take an 8-5 lead. UOP re
bounded quickly, however, and
went on to win the game 15-10.
Had the Cards won last night,
they would have been guaran
teed second place in the con
ference. If thev win their re

maining two games, however,
they will retain their second
place standing and stand a good
chance of getting an at-large
berth in the AIAW regionals lat
