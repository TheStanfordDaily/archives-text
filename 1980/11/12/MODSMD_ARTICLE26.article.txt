### Chris Haft Ivan Maisel 
The Stanford fencers were, if
you will excuse the expression,
foiled by the San Jose State
Spartans last night. In what was
expected to be a close match,
the Cards fell 17-10. suffering
their first loss of the season in
four matches.
Assistant coach Buzz Hurst
had doped out the meet knowing
the foil team would need a 5-4
win for Stanford to have a
chance at winning. However.
San Jose State crushed the
Cardinals 7-2. The Spartans also
won the sabre 6-3. but Hurst said
"They are a stronger team. I'm
satisfied with that.'"
Stanford took the epee 5-4 to
remain undefeated in that com
petition. despite the presence of
San Jose State two-time All-
America Pete Schifrin. Leading
the Cardinals were Gary John
son and Matt Foley.
"They've got a very strong
team," Hurst said. "I expected

the men's team to be real
close." The Spartans had
wrapped up the victory by the
end of the foil.
The Stanford women's team,
however, did not even last that
long. San Jose Slate has one of
the nation's top teams, and
proved it with a 16-0 rout of the
inexperienced Cardinals. All
five women have just started
their first full season on the
team, and Hurst acknowledged
that his team has a long way to
go.
"Their women's team fin
ished second in the nation last
year and first for the five years
before that." Hurst said. "They
were too much for us to han
dle."
Hurst hoped that by Stan
ford's return match with San
Jose State in January, things
might be different. "We will
have a lot more experience by
then.'' he said. "Tonight was not
necessarilv indicative."
