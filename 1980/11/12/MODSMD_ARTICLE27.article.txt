## Like it or not, Georgia, Bulldogs become No. 1 
### 
Athens, Ga. (API — The
Georgia Bulldogs aren't losing
their heads over their No. 1
ranking in the college football
polls — an honor that hasn't ex
actly been a lucky charm this
season

Sportfolio

The Bulldogs, the nation's
only unbeaten and untied major
team, earned top honors in The
Associated Press college foot
ball poll following their heart
stopping 26-21 comeback victory
over Florida last Saturday.
But Coach Vince Dooley —
noting the fate of the last two
No. 1 teams. Notre Dame and
Alabama — says that although
he's excited about being No. 1.
it's the postseason polls taken
after the bowl games that count.
"The significant thing about
us being number one is that we
have not lost yet," said Dooley.
"The only poll I'm really con
cerned with is the one in Janu
ary. That's what it's all about."
Alabama lost its top ranking
two weeks ago after losing 6-3 to
Mississippi State and the
Crimson Tide's successor.
Notre Dame, lasted only a
week, falling from favor after
being tied 3-3 by Georgia Tech.
Bulldog fans vented most of
their excitement last Saturday,
after Lindsay Scott pulled in a
Buck Belue pass for a 93-yard
touchdown play with just over a
minute left to give Georgia the

crucial victory over Florida.
But yesterday morning,
posters proclaiming the Bull
dogs' accomplishment proudly
were displayed in downtown
store windows and on banners
flying from fraternity and
sorority houses.
And tavern owners were
waiving cover charges and of
fering a free beer to customers
showing evidence of being Bull
dog fans.

The Ice Hockey Club breezed
to a 9-3 victory over the Marina
Otters at Monterey last Satur
day night. The match improved
the team's record to 2-0.
The Otters scored first after
eight minutes elapsed in the

first period, but with nine,
minutes remaining, Les
Landsberger drew two
defensemen toward him and
passed to an open Mark Winters,
who tied the score. By the end of
the period Stanford led 3-1.
Early in the second period,
two of Winters' slapshots found
their target, boosting Stanford's
lead to 5-1. David Wright then
took his turn, assisting on two
goals and scoring another to ex
tend Stanford's advantage to
8-1.

Stanford's Ultimate Krisbee

ever in a Western Regional tour
nament this past weekend in
Santa Cruz, winning three of
four games in the 16-team affair
before succumbing to the top
seed and eventual winner. Santa

Saturday, fifth-seeded Stan
ford breezed past Chabot Col
lege. 15-3, and the Woodland
Hills Hot Sox. 15-9. before meet
ing fourth-seeded Boulder for a

The Boulder game proved to
one of the most exciting of the
entire tourney. The lead see
sawed back and forth, each
team never leading by more
than three goals.

Athens, Ga. (API — The
Georgia Bulldogs aren't losing
their heads over their No. 1
ranking in the college football
polls — an honor that hasn't ex
actly been a lucky charm this
season

Sportfolio

The Bulldogs, the nation's
only unbeaten and untied major
team, earned top honors in The
Associated Press college foot
ball poll following their heart
stopping 26-21 comeback victory
over Florida last Saturday.
But Coach Vince Dooley —
noting the fate of the last two
No. 1 teams. Notre Dame and
Alabama — says that although
he's excited about being No. 1.
it's the postseason polls taken
after the bowl games that count.
"The significant thing about
us being number one is that we
have not lost yet," said Dooley.
"The only poll I'm really con
cerned with is the one in Janu
ary. That's what it's all about."
Alabama lost its top ranking
two weeks ago after losing 6-3 to
Mississippi State and the
Crimson Tide's successor.
Notre Dame, lasted only a
week, falling from favor after
being tied 3-3 by Georgia Tech.
Bulldog fans vented most of
their excitement last Saturday,
after Lindsay Scott pulled in a
Buck Belue pass for a 93-yard
touchdown play with just over a
minute left to give Georgia the

crucial victory over Florida.
But yesterday morning,
posters proclaiming the Bull
dogs' accomplishment proudly
were displayed in downtown
store windows and on banners
flying from fraternity and
sorority houses.
And tavern owners were
waiving cover charges and of
fering a free beer to customers
showing evidence of being Bull
dog fans.
