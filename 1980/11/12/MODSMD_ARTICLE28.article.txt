Madrid conference opens amid chaos
Madrid, Spain — After 18 hours of diplomatic wrangling
and confusion, the 35-nation conference to review the Hel
sinki accords on European Security opened formally yes
terday in a five-minute ceremony just before the deadline
midnight, still without any agreement on its agenda or pro
cedures.
The t : nited States delegate. Max Kampelman. stated
"We can go on without an agenda for two or maybe three
days of speech-making, but after that 1 don't know what
will happen."
Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Pedro Perez-Llorca ar
rived at the Palais de Congress here to preside over the
opening plenary session just before midnight in order to
meet the conference timetable that had been fixed at the
last Helsinki review conference held in Belgrade in
1977-78.
The atmosphere here was one of frustration, bitterness,
anger and weariness after weeks of diplomatic stonewall
ing by the Soviet Union over the agenda issues in tactics of
obstruction that have not been seen since the days of the
Cold War.
Preparatory work for the conference began in Madrid
nine weeks ago. with the Soviets insisting on a timetable
and procedural rules that would have cut the conference to
a mere four weeks and eliminated all discussions on sensi
tive questions such as human rights, the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan and the detente performance of the Soviet Un
ion The Western powers want six weeks of general debate
before Christmas and another six weeks in the new year
for discussion of new detente measures.
The preparatory meeting wrangled on until finally, late
last night, the delegates took a coffee break and during this
time the Spanish decided to send their foreign minister to
the conference hall to declare the full conference open on
schedule. Faced with this, the Soviets finally gave their
grudging consent allowing the conference to go forward
U.S. transmits reply to hostage terms
Washington - Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher left Algeria yesterday after delivering the U.S. re
sponse to Iran's conditions for freeing the 52 American
hostages, but there was no sign that an end to the captives'
plight is in sight.
The State Department issued a terse statement late in
the day announcing that Christopher was returning home
after two days of explaining the U.S. response to Algerian
Foreign Minister Mohammed Benyahia and other Alger
ian officials. It added that Algeria, designated by Iran as
its intermediary, had agreed to arrange •prompt trans
mittal" of the proposals to Tehran.
U.S. officials said privately that they had no informa
tion to indicate that the secret response, or an outline of its
contents, had been communicated to Iran as of last night.
The United States already has said it will not interfere in
Iranian affairs, and President Jimmy Carter has pledged
publicly to free the assets once the hostages are released.
However, the other two points — those relating to the
claims against Iran and the shah's wealth — involve legal
questions that may be beyond the president's power to re
solve.
In Algiers. Algerian officials said they did not expect a

quick resolution of the hostage problem, but they other
wise refused any comment on the next steps
Iraq again seeking arms in Moscow
Baghdad, Iraq — The Iraqi government said yesterday
that Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, one of President
Saddam Hussein's most trusted party collaborators, has
gone to Moscow for the second time since the war with
Iran began in September, reportedly seeking arms.
Aziz' visit, which was simply termed bv the Soviet Un
ion as a 'working visit." reinforced diplomatic specula
tion here that Baghdad is becoming increasingly dis
enchanted and concerned with Moscow's careful official
neutrality in the Persian Gulf conflict.
With the Iraqi army expending vast amounts of artillery
shells, bombs, ammunition, and vehicles in its slow mov
ing and increasingly stalemated campaign in Iran's oil
rich Khuzestan Province. Western defense experts here
have considered it only a matter of time before its supplies
begin to run down despite official insistence that plenty
were amassed for a long campaign
So far Moscow has sent Iraq no additional military sup
plies beyond what was previously on the way. according to
Western intelligence sources. Moscow has maintained it is
"neutral" in the conflict with Iran
Iraqi officials in private have expressed concern and
even worry about Moscow's lack of support. With most of
its army supplied with Soviet weapons, Moscow remains
the only place it can get new stocks in the quantities that a
long, drawn-out struggle will demand.
Bush names his head of staff
Washington — Vice President-elect George Bush
reached back into his days as intelligence chief and m.med
his former CIA sidekick, retired Adm. Daniel Murphy, as
his chief of staff when the Reagan administration takes
over in January.
Murphy, who was chief deputy when Bush served as CIA
director and who is now chief intelligence aide to Defense
Secretary Harold Brown, said he will leave his Pentagon
job in a week or so to direct the Bush transition operation
and build the rest of the vice presidential staff.
Murphy. 58. a University of Maryland graduate, has
worked in the Pentagon for Brown, a Democrat, as well as
for two Republican secretaries of defense, Melvin Laird
and Elliot Richardson. Murphy describes himself as
"purely apolitical." and says Bush's staff will have to
"look for political wisdom someplace else."
As Bush's deputy. Murphy earned a reputation as a
strong leader who can withstand bureaucratic and politi
cal pressures His reputation as a tough manager — and
his equality in military rank to the current CIA director,
Adm. Stansfield Turner — reportedly prompted Brown
early in the Carter administration to name Murphy his
deputy for intelligence.

Hostilities between rival military factions loyal to
Prime Minister Robert Mugabe and Home Affairs Min
ister Joshua Nkomo ended Monday night after Zimbabwe
air force jet fighters circled over the battle area and ele
ments of the newly integrated national army moved in to
separate the combatants.
The death toll, however, continued to mount yesterday
with police saying at least 43 persons had been killed and
about 3(H) injured
The violent outburst following a weekend of volatile po
litical rallies in Bulawavo was by far the worst since Zim
babwe achieved its independence seven months ago after a
seven-year war against white rule.
The violent outbursts were in response to a virtual call
to war against ZIPRA Sunday in Bulawayo by Mugabe's
outspoken finance minister. Enos Nkala.
Vote Moyo, a Nkomo aide, said "the whole trouble
started when Nkala asked his party members to take ac
tion" against the minority coalition partner.
Troops from Mugabe's ZANLA and Nkomo's ZIPRA
military organizations are dug in around their respective
housing areas only about half a mile apart, illustrating just
how tenuous the cease-fire is. National army troops are
patrolling the perimeter.
Iranians in U.S. face asylum delay
Washington - The State Department is refusing to proc
ess more than 8400 applications for political asylum filed
by Iranians fleeing the Islamic Republic of Iran because
U.S. officials fear reprisals against the 52 American
hostages, government sources say.
The delay, which has been in effect for months, is based
on the assumption that Islamic Republic officials might
interpret the granting of political asylum by the U.S. gov
ernment to Iranians, particularly those who were former
officials in the imperial government, as a provocation.
State Department officials are anxious to avoid any situ
ation that could pose a threat to the American hostages,
especially during the delicate, ongoing negotiations for
their release, they said.
The delay has caught hundreds of Iranian applicants in a
bureaucratic never-never land where they cannot leave
the country to visit wives and children, except in the rarest
of circumstances, because they would not be permitted to
re-enter the United States.
