# Money measures to dominate Congress
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — A Congress full of
well-plucked lame ducks will flock
back to town today for one last spin
around the pond — and possibly not
much more.
With the agenda of unfinished busi
ness largely rewritten by last week's
election results, the only certainty is
that money measures — the long-over
due budget spending plans and possi
bly a tax cut — will dominate the 96th
Congress until it adjourns.
So unexpected were the Republican
takeover of the Senate and big gains in
the House that it could take a day or
two. at least, for the still-shellshocked
Congress to find its bearings. Until it
does so. even the agenda will be in
doubt.
At stake are bills covering Alaska
lands, fair housing, nuclear and
chemical wastes, revenue sharing, ex
tra unemployment compensation,
criminal code revision, reclamation
policy, youth jobs, foreign aid. regu
latory reform and many others that
were pushed primarily bv the Demo
crats — along with a long list of judi
cial and administrative nominations
that the outgoing Carter adminis
tration submitted to Congress before
its defeat at the polls.
For some of these measures, it may
be now or never.

The ambitious housing bill, which
would strengthen the government's
hand in fighting residential dis
crimination. cannot be expected to
fare as well under the Senate Judi
ciary chairmanship of Strom
Thurmond ( R-S.C.). as it did under the
chairmanship of Kdward Kennedy (D-
Mass. >. And Reagan can be expected
to view Alaska lands protection far
differently than President Jimmy
Carter has.
For some dangling measuTes, there
is strong pressure for immediate ac
tion. Reauthorization of revenue shar
ing for local governments, which ex
pired Sept. 30. is an example.
However. House Majority Leader
Jim Wright (D-Tex.), said yesterday
that most of them — along with the tax
cut bill — will probably get left behind
as Congress pushes to adjourn before
Thanksgiving.
In addit ion to tax and spending bills.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Bvrd
(D-W.Va.). has listed the fair housing
measure and criminal code revision as
priority items for the lame-duck ses
sion. although their prospects are not
considered good if they get caught in
an adjournment rush.
Lame-duck theory
The theory of lame-duck sessions is
that the losers try to get all they can
before time runs out. But it may not be
all that simple this year. "Why risk
your neck in the last four minutes of a
losing game when the season's been a
disaster anyway?" groused a House
Democratic staffer when asked about
prospects for tax cut legislation.
Moreover, the House Budget Com
mittee's endorsement of President

elect Ronald Reagan's promised 2
percent spending cut and Wright's
preference for deferral of tax legisla
tion until next year indicate the Demo
crats will give the new administration
some time — and maybe a little rope
to show how it intends to deliver on
Republican campaign promises.
The last hurrah of the 9tith Congress
could be a long or short one. d epending
in large part on whether Reagan and
Senate leaders of both parties — over
the misgivings of the outgoing presi
dent and House leaders — push ahead
with the Senate Finance Committee's
tax cut bill before the end of the year
Reagan go-ahead
Reagan, who campaigned for a
broader 10 percent cut in income taxes
this year and in each of the next two
years, has nevertheless given the go
ahead to a Senate Finance Commit
tee-backed tax cut of $39 billion, in
cluding $22 billion for individuals and
$17 billion for businesses.
Russell Long (D-La.). and Bob Dole
(R-Kan.l, the outgoing and incoming
chairmen, respectively, of the Senate
Finance Committee, have said they
want to move ahead immediately with
the bill So have Senate Majority
Leader Bvrd and Minority Leader
Howard Baker < R-Tenn.). whose roles
will be reversed in January.
But the House Democratic leader
ship is against the idea, and House
Ways and Means Chairman A 1 Ullman
(D-Ore. I. while saying he won't stand
in the way of the Senate bill, has ex
pressed doubt that final action on a tax
cut is possible this year. So have some
House Republican leaders Moreover,
a Carter veto is possible.

Another complication is the second
budget resolution for fiscal 1981.
which Congress is legally bound — in
theory at least — to adopt before it ad
journs. The budget resolution should
have been approved by its target date
of Sept. 15. but pre-election skittish
ness over its anticipated hefty deficit,
coming only a few months after Con
gress promised the country a balanced
budget for the first time in 12 years,
caused the resolution to be shelved.
Budget Committee leaders in both
houses, fearful of the damage that
further delay might do to the already
heavily strained congressional budget
process, don't want to go home again
without a budget in hand. But if the job
proves too big. Congress can waive the
rules and go home empty-handed, dev
astating as this might be to the budget
system.
There are also all those nagging ap
propriations bills that Congress left
behind when it hit the campaign trail
in early October and, failing to see the
upheaval in its future, put most of the
government on stopgap financing until
it returned. Ten of 13 remain to be
enacted, even though the government
is two months into the 1981 fiscal year.
Some Republicans, who castigated
the Democrats earlier for dillydally
ing on the appropriations bills, now fa
vor more stopgap 112 inancing so Reagan
and the incoming Republican Senate
can leave their mark on spending for
1981 Such a delay could leave most of
the government without congressional
appropriations until near the end of
the first half of the fiscal year, which
would be unprecedented. But then the
delay thus far has also been un
precedented, at least in recent years.
