# Overselling not cause of stands crush
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
The old fad of stuffing people into
phone booths has found new life on the
Stanford campus. Only they are doing
it in Stanford Stadium, not in phone
booths.
If you were one of the sardines at
Saturday's USC-Stanford game, then
you realize the seeming overerowded
ness of the student section However,
the student section on the stadium's
east side extends 45 rows up from the
middle of the field to the end zone
Naturally, no one wants to sit in the
end zone. Therefore, the section sur
rounding the SU-vard line resembles a
subway train at rush hour.

.Yews analysis

The fault lies in unreserved seating
It is not one of overselling tickets,
according to ticket manager Bette
Robertson. "As a matter of fact, we
didn t sell as many tickets i for the
USC game i as we have in the section.
There are over 9000 seats for the stu
dents and our (the Athletic Depart
ment's) working crews. We don t ov
ersell."
Nor is it a problem of there not
being enough seats With about 12.000
students on campus. 9000 seats should
be (and usually isÂ» more than enough.
The fault lies in unreserved seating.
"The students want to sit closer to
the 50 so they just keep pushing.' Rob
ertson added. "You can't have over
8000 students wanting to sit over the
50."
The obvious answer is to go to re
served seating, a decision air '>dv im
plemented at several Pacific-10 Con
fererence schools, including Arizona.
Arizona State and USC. And. accord
ing to Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli. that option is being con
sidered by the Athletic Department
"One of the arguments for reserved
seating goes everyone would have a
reserved seat.'' Cavalli said "Now,
the ones who get there early come and
save blocks of seats for their friends.
The other one is everybody crowds in
at the 50 and doesn't spread out."
Mixed results
The two Los Angeles schools in the
Pac-10 have had different results with
reserved student seating USC im
plemented a system in the early 70s
that "works really well." according to
USC ticket manager PatTvner.
"We randomly sort the tickets dur
ing the summer in groups of one. two.
three and even numbers up to 16.
Tyner said "We scramble those as
well. The students can bring in
coupons from their student activities
book and exchange them for groups ot
student tickets or general admission
tickets in the low rows of the student
section."
Thus the quality of seats is left to
fortune. "If there are tickets left over,
the kids can come and exchange
tickets, if they got bad ones, on a first
come, first serve basis." Tvner added.
"Hut we usually don't have much
left."
Tyner said the students seem satis
fied. "A couple of years ago, the stu
dent senate wanted to bring the
number up to 40. but then it is not a
true lottery. Students think this is
more fair "
