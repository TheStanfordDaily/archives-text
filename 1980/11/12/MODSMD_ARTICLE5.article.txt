# Overselling not cause of stands crush

### Ivan Maisel 
The old fad of stuffing people into
phone booths has found new life on the
Stanford campus. Only they are doing
it in Stanford Stadium, not in phone
booths.
If you were one of the sardines at
Saturday's USC-Stanford game, then
you realize the seeming overerowded
ness of the student section However,
the student section on the stadium's
east side extends 45 rows up from the
middle of the field to the end zone
Naturally, no one wants to sit in the
end zone. Therefore, the section sur
rounding the SU-vard line resembles a
subway train at rush hour.

The fault lies in unreserved seating
It is not one of overselling tickets,
according to ticket manager Bette
Robertson. "As a matter of fact, we
didn t sell as many tickets i for the
USC game i as we have in the section.
There are over 9000 seats for the stu
dents and our (the Athletic Depart
ment's) working crews. We don t ov
ersell."
Nor is it a problem of there not
being enough seats With about 12.000
students on campus. 9000 seats should
be (and usually is» more than enough.
The fault lies in unreserved seating.
"The students want to sit closer to
the 50 so they just keep pushing.' Rob
ertson added. "You can't have over
8000 students wanting to sit over the
50."
The obvious answer is to go to re
served seating, a decision air '>dv im
plemented at several Pacific-10 Con
fererence schools, including Arizona.
Arizona State and USC. And. accord
ing to Associate Athletic Director
Gary Cavalli. that option is being con
sidered by the Athletic Department
"One of the arguments for reserved
seating goes everyone would have a
reserved seat.'' Cavalli said "Now,
the ones who get there early come and
save blocks of seats for their friends.
The other one is everybody crowds in
at the 50 and doesn't spread out."
Mixed results
The two Los Angeles schools in the
Pac-10 have had different results with
reserved student seating USC im
plemented a system in the early 70s
that "works really well." according to
USC ticket manager PatTvner.
"We randomly sort the tickets dur
ing the summer in groups of one. two.
three and even numbers up to 16.
Tyner said "We scramble those as
well. The students can bring in
coupons from their student activities
book and exchange them for groups ot
student tickets or general admission
tickets in the low rows of the student
section."
Thus the quality of seats is left to
fortune. "If there are tickets left over,
the kids can come and exchange
tickets, if they got bad ones, on a first
come, first serve basis." Tvner added.
"Hut we usually don't have much
left."
Tyner said the students seem satis
fied. "A couple of years ago, the stu
dent senate wanted to bring the
number up to 40. but then it is not a
true lottery. Students think this is
more fair "
UCLA went to reserved seat
ing in 1970, but backed off when
their system proved unsuc
cessful. Now the school uses re
served seats only for their an
nual game against USC.
UCLA ticket manager David
Lowenstein said the con
troversy was became one of
fairness. The school uses a
priority system for determining
who gets the best seats, but has
yet to find one acceptable
enough to implement for the
whole season.
"A large group such as a
fraternity can only get up to 20
seats together," Lowenstein
said, taking pains to point out
the decision was made "with
student output." Nonetheless,
the student body will only stand
for reserved seats for their big
gest game of the year.
Wouldn't have it
"We can't sell it for all the
other games. The groups would
not have it." Lowenstein said.
"We have a serious problem.
We came up with a rotation sys
tem by class, but no one liked it.
Then we said if you wanted to sit
together as a group you have to
sit from the 20-yard line to the
goal line. No one liked that be
cause you have to decide early
in the week if you want to go to
the game."
In addition to all these prob
lems. there are some additional
ones which would be peculiar to
Stanford.
One is the quarter system.

"The first couple of games are
played before the students are
coming back." Cavalli said.
"Do you sell those early on the
same basis even though most of
the students aren't around?
We've always sold them sepa
rately for the first game or two
and then sold the season tickets
on a unreserved basis."
Another is Stanford Stadium.
Said USC's Tyner: "You have
benches. We have seats (in Los
Angeles Coliseum). You can
crowd more than one person on
a bench. It's hard to do that with
a seat."'
Limit
In addition, the Athletic De
partment realizes students en
joy sitting with their friends.
Any limit, be it 16.20 or 40 seats,
is still a limit. Above all. Cavalli
said, the University wants to be
fair.
"When the student who ar
rives early gets the best seat,
there is some rationale for it,"
he said. "A blind lottery leaves
it totally to chance."
However, also left to chance
is the possibility of someone get
ting injured. If the pushing and
squeezing gets to be too much,
then reserved seating, which
Cavalli admitted is a "logistical
nightmare." will be im
plemented. As UCLA's Low
enstein said. "The problems are
the same. Unless something
happens with the pushing, noth
ing will be done. The students

Mixed results
The two Los Angeles schools in the
Pac-10 have had different results with
reserved student seating USC im
plemented a system in the early 70s
that "works really well." according to
USC ticket manager PatTvner.
"We randomly sort the tickets dur
ing the summer in groups of one. two.
three and even numbers up to 16.
Tyner said "We scramble those as
well. The students can bring in
coupons from their student activities
book and exchange them for groups ot
student tickets or general admission
tickets in the low rows of the student
section."
Thus the quality of seats is left to
fortune. "If there are tickets left over,
the kids can come and exchange
tickets, if they got bad ones, on a first
come, first serve basis." Tvner added.
"Hut we usually don't have much
left."
Tyner said the students seem satis
fied. "A couple of years ago, the stu
dent senate wanted to bring the
number up to 40. but then it is not a
true lottery. Students think this is
more fair "
UCLA went to reserved seat
ing in 1970, but backed off when
their system proved unsuc
cessful. Now the school uses re
served seats only for their an
nual game against USC.
UCLA ticket manager David
Lowenstein said the con
troversy was became one of
fairness. The school uses a
priority system for determining
who gets the best seats, but has
yet to find one acceptable
enough to implement for the
whole season.
"A large group such as a
fraternity can only get up to 20
seats together," Lowenstein
said, taking pains to point out
the decision was made "with
student output." Nonetheless,
the student body will only stand
for reserved seats for their big
gest game of the year.
Wouldn't have it
"We can't sell it for all the
other games. The groups would
not have it." Lowenstein said.
"We have a serious problem.
We came up with a rotation sys
tem by class, but no one liked it.
Then we said if you wanted to sit
together as a group you have to
sit from the 20-yard line to the
goal line. No one liked that be
cause you have to decide early
in the week if you want to go to
the game."
In addition to all these prob
lems. there are some additional
ones which would be peculiar to
Stanford.
One is the quarter system.

"The first couple of games are
played before the students are
coming back." Cavalli said.
"Do you sell those early on the
same basis even though most of
the students aren't around?
We've always sold them sepa
rately for the first game or two
and then sold the season tickets
on a unreserved basis."
Another is Stanford Stadium.
Said USC's Tyner: "You have
benches. We have seats (in Los
Angeles Coliseum). You can
crowd more than one person on
a bench. It's hard to do that with
a seat."'
Limit
In addition, the Athletic De
partment realizes students en
joy sitting with their friends.
Any limit, be it 16.20 or 40 seats,
is still a limit. Above all. Cavalli
said, the University wants to be
fair.
"When the student who ar
rives early gets the best seat,
there is some rationale for it,"
he said. "A blind lottery leaves
it totally to chance."
However, also left to chance
is the possibility of someone get
ting injured. If the pushing and
squeezing gets to be too much,
then reserved seating, which
Cavalli admitted is a "logistical
nightmare." will be im
plemented. As UCLA's Low
enstein said. "The problems are
the same. Unless something
happens with the pushing, noth
ing will be done. The students
like the freedom of the seating.
The old fad of stuffing people into
phone booths has found new life on the
Stanford campus. Only they are doing
it in Stanford Stadium, not in phone
booths.
If you were one of the sardines at
Saturday's USC-Stanford game, then
you realize the seeming overerowded
ness of the student section However,
the student section on the stadium's
east side extends 45 rows up from the
middle of the field to the end zone
Naturally, no one wants to sit in the
end zone. Therefore, the section sur
rounding the SU-vard line resembles a
subway train at rush hour.

The fault lies in unreserved seating
It is not one of overselling tickets,
according to ticket manager Bette
Robertson. "As a matter of fact, we
didn t sell as many tickets i for the
USC game i as we have in the section.
There are over 9000 seats for the stu

Nor is it a problem of there not
