# Voyager passes Saturn's mammoth moon
## Atmosphere like earth's three billion years ago 
### Washington Post 
Pasadena â€” Photographs taken yesterday of
Titan, the largest of Saturn's 15 moons and the
largest moon in the solar system, suggest that it
has an atmosphere like the one that gave birth to
life on earth more than 3 billion years ago.
"We think it's much too cold for life on Titan
but what we're seeing so far is quite similar to
what took place on earth and what still might be
taking place on Venus."' said Dr. Ciarrv Hunt as
he studied pictures from the Voyager spacecraft
moving close to Saturn. "We think Titan is a cold
and miniature version of the planets close to the
sun. especially Venus."
Twice the size of the earth s moon and the
brightest moon in the solar system. Titan has
long been looked on as one of the most fascinating
bodies in the heavens. It has a rich methane at
mosphere that reflects sunlight like a planet, not
like an airless moon. It may be the only moon in
the solar system large enough to have a grav
itational field with the strength to keep an at
mosphere.
One of the main goals of the Voyager mission
to Saturn is to observe Titan. The 1800-lb. space
craft will fly under the south pole of Titan, then
follow a curving path to bring it near the south
pole of Saturn and beyond the planet during the
late evening hours today.
Approaching Titan at 38,000 miles an hour,
Voyager sent back photographs yesterday of the
mysterious moon that showed a glowing gold
streaked globe whose atmosphere was covered
by a thick haze that reached out as much as 60
miles above its atmosphere. The northern hemi

sphere of Titan was darker than its southern half
and a dark patch that descended from the moon's
north pole made it look like Titan was divided
into three parts.
Scientists believe the dark patch at the pole is a
hood of ice rich in methane, ethane and acetylene
that grows so heavy sometimes that pieces break
off and fall into the lower atmosphere The dark
colors in the polar hood and in the region beneath
it were due to seasonal changes in the northern
hemisphere, which on Titan is just coming out of
a winter lasting almost 20 years.
Another reason colors in Titan's northern hem
isphere are so dark right now is that its upper at
mosphere is being bombarded by cosmic parti
cles raining on the moon out of the magneto
sphere that surrounds so much of Saturn The
magnetosphere. which extends more than 746.000
miles from the surface of Saturn, traps particles
that have streamed out to Saturn from the sun It
forms radiation belts around the planet powerful
enough to damage delicate electronics aboard a
passing spacecraft.
The protons and electrons that make up the
trapped particles are also believed to heat up the
upper reaches of the atmosphere of Titan as it
passes through the radiation belts. Enough of this
heating has been observed from earth for scien
tists to believe that the atmosphere of Titan is a
lot warmer than a moon more than a billion miles
from the sun should b<\
Hunt, a scientist at the University of London,
said that even though Titan revolves on its axis
>nly once every 16 days, the atmospheric heating
should be enough to generate windstorms on the

moon He said the weather patterns observed on
Titan might be quite similar to those observed on
Venus, where clouds in the upper atmosphere
whirl around the planet at more than 200 miles an
hour.
The haze that surrounded Titan yesterday was
so thick that scientists despaired of seeing
through it to the surface, which is believed to be
made up of liquid methane mixed in with lakes of
semi-frozen acetylene and ethane.
"We're not going to see through this northern
haze.'' Hunt said The only chance we'll have to
see the surface is when we pass under the south
pole some of the clouds might be moving so fast
they'll open up a hole in the haze for a little
while."
Scientists speculate that the heating of the at
mosphere gives Titan a surface temperature of
about ISO degrees above absolute zero, which is
at least 60 degrees warmer than it should be at its
distance from the sun While this is far below
zero Fahrenheit, it is not too much colder than it
gets at the North Pole on Earth in winter
Titan's atmosphere of methane and ammonia
is believed to be similar to the primitive at
mosphere of the Earth, which changed to what it
is today 3 billion years ago through the con
tinuous action of the Sun. violent electrical
storms and erupting volcanoes on its surface
