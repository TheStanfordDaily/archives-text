Describing her writing as "the glorious strug
gle to make words really count." author Tillie
Olsen. who wrote Tell Me a Riddle and Silences,
spoke to an overflowing crowd about her life and
work last Wednesday iri Terman Auditorium as
part of the CHOW series "Dialogues with West
Coast Women Writers."
Olsen expressed herself with extraordinary
passion and a unique eloquence; her stutters and
sighs seemed to reflect the tremendous amount of
emotion that she was struggling to share with the
audience.

Happily I do write better than I talk." Olsen
joked.
Marilyn Yalom. Olsen's interviewer in Wednes
day's dialogue, said afterward. "Talking with
Tillie Olsen is like talking to the ocean. . . . She
can't be condensed into one hour." Yalom, as
sociate director of CROW and teacher of Women's
Literature, will be editing the publication which is
to be based on this series of dialogues.
Olsen reflected briefly on her own periods of si
lence; Yonnondio: From the Thirties was pub

lished in 1974. 40 years after Olsen had written it —
after her long silence "that had to do with chil
dren. making a living, human limitations, human
tiredness. . . ."
The author spoke at length about her attempts
to address the fundamental issues of the human
condition, by "writing about what has consumed
human lives: work, and that other great work of
bearing and rearing human life — the possibility
of making life continue."
Olsen repeatedly emphasized her dislike of the
"putdown term" of "working class," insisting
that "as the old needs of humanity begin to be
taken care of. there are whole new working
classes of people who tlrnk of themselves as pro
fessionals."
When Yalom asked Olsen about her sense of
identity as a writer. Olsen said. "1 am a struggling
being trying to get my work done — to get down
some of what it has meant to have lived in my
time."
She stressed her commitment to the "language
of emotion," and quoted Blake: "A tear is an in
tellectual thing."
Style often involves struggle as well, Olsen
said, the struggle to "enmesh and embed emo
tion" in the content of her work. She explained
that she could not simply show what she could do
with language in an experimental form because
"I have things to say that are not being said, and
that puts pressure on your style."
"I am consumed with the unwritten, the unex
pressed." Olsdn continued. "How one's intellect,
love of beauty, sense of justice, and capacity to or
ganize are used in everday life."
Olsen stressed her belief that "Whenever we
come to what the world recognizes as achieve
ment, it's not by virtue of great innate capacity,
but by virtue of special, freaky luck." She said
that "innate in all of us is that blazing passion to
communicate."
She concluded with some advice for would-be
writers: "Trust your readers — they'll write your
work along with you. . . I assure you that I'm not
as good a writer as some of you think I am — it's
you and what you bring to what you read. . . ."
