# 'Stanford Genetics, Inc. 'not being considered: Kennedy
## 
### David Frank 
Stanford has no current plans to
form a genetic engineering company
for the purpose of enabling the Univer
sity to" profit directly from com
mercial development of recombinant
DNA research, according to President
Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy said yesterday he is unsure
about the wisdom of such a company
related to the University because he
believes the University has vet to de
velop "a way to uphold the values of an
educational institution while partici
pating in a business enterprise."
However, he said. "I wouldn't rule
out the possibility in the future."
Speculations that a Stanford-run ge
netic engineering company might be

in the offing arose nearly three weeks
ago when Harvard University an
nounced that it was considering such a
plan.
The company under consideration
at Harvard, in which the university
would hold a minority interest, would
use biological patents developed at the
university to compete with the grow-

ing number of private companies us
ing genetic engineering to create
drugs, such as insulin and interferon.
One Bay Area genetic engineering
firm. Genentech. of South San Fran
cisco. first sold stock on the open mar
ket a month ago. After only 90
minutes, the price rose from $35 to $89.
The firm was co-founded in 1976 by Dr.
Herbert Boyer. a UC-Berkelev pro
fessor.
Colleges have patented their re
searchers' inventions and licensed
them to companies for profit for a long
time. But licensing fees and royalties,
a Harvard public relations officer said
last week, are "peanuts "compared to
the income a commercial developer
can earn.
Proponents of the Harvard plan say
the profits from such a company could
relieve pressure on the university's
endowment income, support further
research and help slow the sharp in
creases in tuition costs.
Critics, however, have warned that
the proposed company, and the extra
income available, would divert facul
ty members from their primary
academic responsibilities of research
and teaching.
Kennedy noted. "I think we're al
ready seeing a group of scientists de
voting increasing amounts of time to
genetic-related matters." either in
forming their own genetic companies
(as with Boyer) or in consulting for
them.
As well. Kennedy pointed out. there
is a risk that university-operated busi
ness enterprises could cramp the free
exchange of information that charac
terizes the academic world. Although

he emphasized it is too early to chart
such a trend. Kennedy said he "knows
some scientists who already have
greater reservations to exchange in
formation than before. So we've paid
some price already."
Vice Provost and Dean of Research
Gerald Lieberman questioned
whether the formation of a genetic en
gineering firm would divert faculty
members from other responsibilities.
"Are we entitled to enlarge a facul
ty member's duties to include the de
velopment of patents? - ' Lieberman
asked "And if so. does that lead to a
reduction in time devoted to other
areas of their jobs such as teaching
and research?''
Prof. Robert Schimke. chairman of
the Biology Department, compared
the situation in biological research
with that of electronics. "Freedom of
information will always be a great
concern, but I don't think the in
creased interest in the biological field
is any different from that in elec
tronics.'' he said.
"What we're seeing now in biology
is simply a new era.'' Schimke con
tinued. "People in biological, medi
cal. and bio-medical fields are finding
that their expertise has commercial
value. And I know that the genetic
companies, like Genentech. are trying
very hard to maintain a free flow of in
formation.
"There is a clear realization that
without that free flow of information,
they (the companies' won't be able to
get good people to work or consult for
them." Schimke added.
But. said Schimke. "I hope scien
tists at Stanford will remember that
teaching of students and research are

their foremost responsibilities.'
Since 1970. the University's Office
of Technology License has handled the
licensing of research discoveries of
students and staff in a variety of
fields.
According to OTL Director Neils
Reimers, the office evaluates the
marketability of inventions disclosed
to it by the inventors, often contacting
private firms to work out licensing
agreements. Inventors are under no
obligation to license their patents
through the OTL, Reimers added.

One Bay Area genetic engineering
firm. Genentech. of South San Fran
cisco. first sold stock on the open mar
ket a month ago. After only 90
minutes, the price rose from $35 to $89.
The firm was co-founded in 1976 by Dr.
Herbert Boyer. a UC-Berkelev pro
fessor.
Colleges have patented their re
searchers' inventions and licensed
them to companies for profit for a long
time. But licensing fees and royalties,
a Harvard public relations officer said
last week, are "peanuts "compared to
the income a commercial developer
can earn.
Proponents of the Harvard plan say
the profits from such a company could
relieve pressure on the university's
endowment income, support further
research and help slow the sharp in
creases in tuition costs.
Critics, however, have warned that
the proposed company, and the extra
income available, would divert facul
ty members from their primary
academic responsibilities of research
and teaching.
Kennedy noted. "I think we're al
ready seeing a group of scientists de
voting increasing amounts of time to
genetic-related matters." either in
forming their own genetic companies
(as with Boyer) or in consulting for
them.
As well. Kennedy pointed out. there
is a risk that university-operated busi
ness enterprises could cramp the free
exchange of information that charac
terizes the academic world. Although

he emphasized it is too early to chart
such a trend. Kennedy said he "knows
some scientists who already have
greater reservations to exchange in
formation than before. So we've paid
some price already."
Vice Provost and Dean of Research
Gerald Lieberman questioned
whether the formation of a genetic en
gineering firm would divert faculty
members from other responsibilities.
"Are we entitled to enlarge a facul
ty member's duties to include the de
velopment of patents? - ' Lieberman
asked "And if so. does that lead to a
reduction in time devoted to other
areas of their jobs such as teaching
and research?''
Prof. Robert Schimke. chairman of
the Biology Department, compared
the situation in biological research
with that of electronics. "Freedom of
information will always be a great
concern, but I don't think the in
creased interest in the biological field
is any different from that in elec
tronics.'' he said.
"What we're seeing now in biology
is simply a new era.'' Schimke con
tinued. "People in biological, medi
cal. and bio-medical fields are finding
that their expertise has commercial
value. And I know that the genetic
companies, like Genentech. are trying
very hard to maintain a free flow of in
formation.
"There is a clear realization that
without that free flow of information,
they (the companies' won't be able to
get good people to work or consult for
them." Schimke added.
But. said Schimke. "I hope scien
tists at Stanford will remember that
teaching of students and research are

their foremost responsibilities.'
Since 1970. the University's Office
of Technology License has handled the
licensing of research discoveries of
students and staff in a variety of
fields.
According to OTL Director Neils
Reimers, the office evaluates the
marketability of inventions disclosed
to it by the inventors, often contacting
private firms to work out licensing
agreements. Inventors are under no
obligation to license their patents
through the OTL, Reimers added.
Stanford has no current plans to
form a genetic engineering company
for the purpose of enabling the Univer
sity to" profit directly from com
mercial development of recombinant
DNA research, according to President
Donald Kennedy.
Kennedy said yesterday he is unsure
about the wisdom of such a company
related to the University because he
believes the University has vet to de
velop "a way to uphold the values of an
educational institution while partici
pating in a business enterprise."
However, he said. "I wouldn't rule
out the possibility in the future."
Speculations that a Stanford-run ge
netic engineering company might be

in the offing arose nearly three weeks
