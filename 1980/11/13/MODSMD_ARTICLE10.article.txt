# Leaders express cautious optimism on Reagan future
## Europe hopes for greater U. S. cooperation

Paris â€” The future of the "Paris-Bonn
axis' that has dominated Western Europe
in the absence of U.S. leadership in the
Carter administration was at the center of
talks here Monday between visiting West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing.
They met the week before Schmidt is
scheduled to go to Washington to test the
American mood since the election of Ronald
Reagan as president. The Bonn leader is to
see President Carter and is also hoping to be
the first European figure to see the new
president.
France. Giscard said, will now strength
en its cooperation with Britain and Italy and
"very obviously with West Germany,
which, for reasons of the past and the pres
ent. is and will remain our first partner."
Election betting
French officials have let it be known that
when Giscard and Schmidt last met in Ger
many in .July, they bet on the U.S. elections,
with the French leader betting on Reagan
and the German on Carter, despite
Schmidt's widely known contempt for the
American incumbent.
Officials on both sides of the Rhine recog
nize. however, that it was to the real
or perceived vacuutn created by Carter that

France and Germany were able to form a
working relationship that has served as the
informal board of governors of the nine
member European Community. This ar
rangement has left Britain. Western Eu
rope's other major power, out of the inner
club that set the tone, among other things,
for the accommodating Continental attitude
toward the Soviet Union.
There are signs that mutually shared anx
ieties about Reagan's approach toward
Moscow may lead to an opening of the door
of the inner club to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. She is going to Bonn
Nov. 16 to see Schmidt two days before his
departure for Washington, meaning that the
chancellor will, in effect, be going to the
United States as the spokesman for Western
Europe. The prearranged calendar of
diplomatic voyages has created this unusual
situation, in which the British may for once
not be the first Europeans to get to a new
U.S. president, if Reagan agrees to see
Schmidt.
Arms questions
Despite Monday's warm welcome for re
newed American determination. French
analysts say they expect Schmidt, who has a
heavy political investment in arms control,
disarmament and East-West detente, to
have the most trouble of the major Europe
an allied leaders coming to terms with Re

agan's stated intention of strengthening
western defenses before resuming arms
limitations efforts with the Soviets.
French officials profess to be quite com
fortable with the idea that Reagan will
rearm first and talk later. "We want to be
intermediaries between the Americans and
the Russians.'' said a top French strategist.
That gives France an interest in a strong
America. A weak America makes us slide
toward the Soviet side rather than being
able to maneuver between the two."
The French view is that with Reagan's
election, it is time to return to the idea first
proposed by President Charles DeGaulle of
an inner directorate for the alliance, an ap
proach consistently rejected by U.S. presi
dents until Carter accepted a summit at
Guadeloupe with Giscard. Schmidt and
British Labour Prime Minister James
Callaghan in .January, 1979. Having
achieved their ambition to be at the table
with the Anglo-Saxon duo. the French and
German leaders backed away with what
they both privately indicated was horror
over Carter's lack of grasp of Iran and other
problems.
Giscard has apparently for some time
been putting out discreet feelers to the Re
agan camp, although the future candidate
was virtually snubbed when he visited
France two years ago.
