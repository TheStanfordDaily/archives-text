What was started here in the
1940s and has members repre
senting more than 20 countries'.'
No. the United Nations hasn t
moved to Stanford, but Bing
Nursery School has been here
since 1947, and its 330 students
come from all over the world,
speaking languages ranging
from Farsi to Korean to Hun
garian.
Bing is located at 850 Escon
dido Road and enrolls children
from throughout the Palo Alto
area, although about 40 percent
are children of Stanford faculty
and students. It offers 14 dif
ferent programs ranging from
parent-toddler play groups to
nursery school classes to an af
ter school day camp
What makes Bing different
from most nursery schools,
however, is that it also serves as
a research lab for the psy
chology and other departments
at Stanford According to Carol
Lou Young-Holt, the school's di
rector, any groups which are in
terested can observe and do re
search there.
Current studies are being run
by the psychology and
linguistics departments. Al
though some parents may worry
that their children will be used
as guinea pigs. Young-Holt feels
that "there's no sense of that at
all."
Researchers have observed
the children play with puppets,
board games and other media
which will keep their interest,
and have been allowed to ob
serve basic points of study.
Young-Holt said that almost
all child development research
in the psychology department is
done here, and that many world
renowned child development
theories were formulated out of
studies at Bing.
Currently, about 10 research
programs are in progress deal
ing with such areas as behav
ioral stereotypes and gender
labeling, shyness, word for
mation and language acquisi
tion. the delay of gratification
and the recognition and resolu
tion of ambiguity.
Records are kept in the
classrooms so that parents may
see which studies their children
have participated in and how
much time was spent in the
"game room," where most of
the research takes place.
Research approved
All programs must be ap
proved by faculty research su
pervisors. the University Hu
man Subjects Committee, and
Bing's research coordinator
before being implemented, and
children cannot participate

without parental consent
Young-Holt said that time spent
out of class with a researcher is
severely limited, although the
children look at the one-to-one
contact as a fun and special
event
Although Bing was originally
founded as a lab nusery school,
it is currently changing to take
care of developing family needs
by offering child-care services.
Bing children, as well as stu
dents from Nixon and Eseon
dido Elementary schools, can
stay after school until 5 30 p.m.
Although a casual feeling per
vades the school atmosphere,
instructors at Bing say that the
casual environment is really the
result of careful planning and
underlying structure Play is
stressed because the school
workers feel it is the basic in
gredient of children's learn
ing.''
Programs are set up to ex
pose the children to concrete ex
periences through interaction
with real objects. Constructive
toys, art materials, books, re
cords, animals, costumes and
large play yards are available
for the children to learn from
and to explore.
In addition, a large staff is
available with teacher-to-stu
dent ratios of one-to-five for the
two-year-olds, one-to-eight for
the three-year-olds and one-to
nine for the older children.
Class sizes range from 14 to 32
children. Young-Holt said she
believes that due to the
spaciousness ol the facilities,
the class, sizes are good and
I here are enough adults to pro
vide stimulating group projects.
Open all year
The school is based on the
Stanford academic year, with a
summer session as well. School
is also in session between quar
ters for child care needs.
Young-Holt said she has
"very strong feelings about pa
rental involvement" and
stresses that there are in
classroom opportunities for
participation, either as an assis
tant on a regular basis, or sim
ply to share special pro jects and
events. There is a parent-child
group on Fridays, and a parent
support group meets twice a
month, with parents and staff
discussing concerns about child
raising.
Young-Holt said she believes
that "parenting is an on-the-job
training. You can read about
child-raising to a certain point,
but when you have children, it
all changes. Some things you
just learn from doing, and some
times it's not easy." Conflicts

occur and parents need sup
, port They need to talk about
(their problems and con
cerns i." She feels parents can
gain relief from this sharing of
feelings.
The school also has quarterly
lectures on broad interest topics
which include current research,
children's literature and what
to look for in a kindergarten pro
gram.
Another project which brings
parents and staff together is the
Spring Pair, the school's annual
fund raiser at Bing. held in May
An entire area is dedicated to
ethnic foods, while other attrac
tions include puppet shows,
nickel games, a handicraft sale
and musical entertainment.
Financial aid available
Although Bing gets some
funds from the fair, most of its
income comes from student tui
tions These are paid monthly or
quarterly, and some scholar
ships are available Families in
need of financial assistance
may also participate in a work
exchange program.
Enrollment is done in the
spring previous to the year of
entry, and children are placed in
programs by Sept. 30.
Bing moved to its present lo
cation in 1%6. under the direc
tion of Dr. Edith Dowley. an in
ternational authority on early
childhood education and current
adviser to the human biology de
partment Bing was funded by
the National Science Founda
tion and a special grant from
Anna Bing Arnold and her son,
Peter Bing. who continue to
sponsor projects beyond the
school's basic needs. Young-
Holt said, "We're growing out of
our current space." and they
will be funding a new wing.
One of the main goals of the
school, aside from those of supe
rior child care, development of
strong bonds with parents, and a
good lab environment, is that of
incorporating more under
graduate students. Young-Holt
said she feels that although stu
dents are compatible, with
Bing s service and research pro
gram. they don't utilize it to its
fullest.
"The students who come here
absolutely love it. It's a neat ex
perience." she said. It adds life
to the theories learned in class,
and offers an excellent chance
for interaction with Bing's di
verse staff, according to Young-
Holt. Students can either work
for class credit, or through the
work-study program.
Students enthusiastic
Susie Abosch. a psychology
student, said she thinks "it's a

great program, but said she
feels it's unfortunate that so
many people don t know that it
exists. She said she enjoys the
class and has learned a great
deal
Maria Kavard another stu
dent. said she likes the way the
school is run.and Heckv Kidwell
pointed out that 1! anv of the
children have special problems,
there is plenty ot room and stall
to resolve them
One mother. I'riscilla
Monthes. said she is very happy
with the school and its patience
in working with her son who.
having recently moved here
with his family from Mexico,
was having trouble adjusting to
new surroundings Monthes said
she has already seen progress
since this summer, when he
started at Bing
Another mother. Liz Hood,
exclaimed. "There's no place
I'd rather be!" She was first ex
posed to Bing while caring for a
multi-handicapped child. She
said she was so impressed with
the facilities and staff, she en
rolled her daughter in Ming, and
now works there herself. She
claims that the school is "supe
rior to (her i expectations." and
