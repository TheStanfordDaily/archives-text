## The
						Big Con: Stanford's childish game 
### 
Alas, another academic year has
begun at this Great Western University.
It seems like only days ago when sweat
poured from, brows over spring quarter
finals. We are well underway, falling into
a routine that will make up much of our
Stanford experience. But. for too many
here, the "experience" means pointless,
trivial encounters with people you would
just as soon never see again.
It seems so simple to criticize the
place, but in the end. we all seem to jus
tify our presence at Stanford "No sense
being too harsh on the University. After
all. my problems here at Stanford are my
own doing, right?"
Well, just hold on. This is the thinking
of too many of us pompous, presump
tuous "academians. " Don't be so hard on
yourself. Perhaps the value of the so
called Stanford experience ought to be
reconsidered. A glance at some of the so
cial and academic situations will show
why.
You need not be a psychology or soci
ology major to understand the Stanford
mentality. Let's look at a frequent occur
rence at White FMaza . "Oh. hi Debbie â– 
how's it going? Oh. I'm fine. What are
your classes this quarter'.' Where are you
living*? Well, gotta go. see you later, il
hope not. he or she mutters under his or
her breath.) Bye!"
Now there's a tine example of a genu
ine Stanford student Always glad to see
you always looking his or her best, and
always extremely interested in your
well-being So how can we classify the
Stanford student in particular, and the
Stanford social life in general'.' ... a Big
Con.
Take a look. Our supposedly high in
telligence should help us see through
many of the social games that exist here.
For example, recall the average Stan
ford party, whether it be a frat house, or
dorm. They're all basically the same!
The typical sight as you walk in the

door is masses of people with unfamiliar
faces, all doing one thing: standing
around. Your first utterance is.
"Where's the beer' 1 " If beer exists,
there's a slight chance the party will be
worth your while without beer, you have
certainly wasted your time in coming.
Alcoholic beverages are all too often the
icebreaker for social situations. Without
a brew in his or her hand, the Stanford
student is incapable of nurturing his or
her fragile ego.
Having completed your trip to the
oasis of intoxication, the keg. you com
ment on the band i if there is one). These
comments often last the entire party,
making up the bulk of the conversation.
The dancing seems sparse, but that
doesn't bother you: you're used to it. As
the party draws to a close and the
number of new people met totals one or
two. you're ready to call it an evening.
Chalk up another fantastic time for a
Stanford weekend.
Surely there must be an alternative to
this scenario, or at least a way to im
prove these parties Why don't people
meet others more readily?
Perhaps a name-tag should be re
quired at all Stanford parties. Under
present conditions, the Stanford party is
a stagnant, unexciting routine. Students
choose to ignore such conditions, though.
This is probably because they have never
considered the meaninglessness of Stan
ford parties. -
Parties are not the only social settings
in which the Big Con is practiced Have
you ever noticed White Plaza in the late
morning and afternoon'' Picture the peo
ple at Tresidder. the "hangers-out." who
often, with an accompanying cup of cof
fee or pastry, are nominally studying.
But. their real reason for being there is
to be seen.
These people conduct a dozen or more
of the Hi. Debbie" conversations men
tioned earlier. At football games, count

the average number of "hi s" given by
any good-looking girl or guy. Re
member: it is very important to be seen
with just the right people.
In addition, we've all met those indi
viduals who seem to have a thousand and
one acquaintances, but no true friends.
These individuals are pathetically
artificial, and their goal is the ac
quiescence of large numbers of so-called
friends to be used later as stepping
stones to their own ends. There seems to
be a disproportionate number of such in
dividuals lurking about Stanford.
Concerning the female students:
haven't we heard enough about the diets
that they're always trying, when every
one damn well knows that they're
munching on cookies in their rooms?
Concerning the male students: haven't
we heard enough about the great parties
and wild times with wine, women and
song that they always enjoy, when 99
percent of the time they've fabricated
their stories?
Well, if there isn't much to the social
life at Stanford, then we can always fall
back on the academics, right? Look
again. Let's take a few typical academic
situations.
Have you ever noticed that students
rarely ask questions in el&ss. rather they
comment. This is a useful ploy to gain the
attention of and the envy of
fellow students. Lectures are not de
signed for the student's use as a forum
Much valuable time is wasted when a
student makes a trivial comment during
the middle of a lecture. Have you ever
wondered how early some students must
get up in order to obtain a first-row seat
in an 8 a.m. calculus class?
We all know that some students are
checking out all the books from the li
brary in a particular subject so that no
one else will have access to them. Ex
cuses such as. "But. I need all 16of these

books to get the information I need for
my paper." are common. Competition,
dishonesty, call it what you may. this
practice is more evidence of the Big Con
Kver noticed the people who can't stop
telling you how much work they have?
You stare at their artificially pathetic
eyes to such an extent that you are bored
stiff They exaggerate their all too com
mon symptoms in exchange for your pre
cious sympathy.
But. Stanford also has many students
on the other end of the spectrum. For
these characters, everything is always
going their way. when in actuality
they're extremely distressed
academically. Everyone at Stanford
cares about grades intensely, but it's a
rare occasion when anyone will admit to
it.
So. how are these grades sought? All
nighters. study groups, verbose papers,
and the old liberal arts major's stan
dard: regurgitating the professor's
words back to him. paraphrased, of
course. Conclusion? Academics are as
big a con at Stanford as the social life.
All these examples of Stanford behav
ior have many similarities. What mat
ters at Stanford is a person's image. The
goal of many students is to appear at
ease, well-groomed, under control and
constantly overworked. It is like
tightrope walking between studying,
good looks, partying and general socia
bility.
Thousands of students play this
absurd, childish game every day. The
student hunts for an elusive middle
ground, hiding his or hers (and the
school's) inadequacies behind a shield of
self-confidence. And the Stanford com
munity. by its competitive atmosphere,
perpetuates the con game that many stu
dents equate with survival.
