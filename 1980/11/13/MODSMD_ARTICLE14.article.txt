I submit for your approval, a
man A man in a gray suit, with
a gray face, withered with the
experience of 51 years as a
Democrat. His daddy was a
Democrat; but now Bonzo is 70.

cheeks, and swoons over Ameri

The Washington Monument
shines in his rose colored glit
tering eves. "Somehow I'll
make America whatever it used
to be.' he thinks to himself, as
he smiles in blissful ignorance.

He grabs his microphone and
commands his advisors to eat.
sleep and speak for him. After
all. working 9 to 5 isn't easy. He
is a hero, he is a president and
these are "Death Valley Days."
When he was young, tiiere
was no inequality, but the issue
became so heated that he was
forced to solve it In a rash
flourish, he eliminated the no
tion of equality.
He smiled at the silver badge,
clustered with an eagle, that he
pinned on his chest. The guard
ian of the Moral Majority reck
lessly climbed off his horse and
wiped his boots in the Oval Of
fice. His eyes glistened as he
scooped up four cents, left in the
tray of the Oval Office desk.
"How easy it is to balance the
budget around here." he said to
himself.
The buck stops here" no

ings of a once sharp 16-vear-old
mind emblazed the redwood

The office was draped with a

tree abuse and rehearsal for the
new Department of Perpetual
Presidency Campaigning took a
lot of time.
"Yes. he made a few
changes.'' he admitted to
himself as he stared at his
trophy wall. Unilaterally, his
advisors had decimated Politic
ly Amerieanus Donkey us, the
American Democrat. Gone
were the days of the Donkey and
Capitol ti\\\-billies. It wasn't
easy to make the transition into
office without the Donkeyus,
but it was done.
He remembered the fateful
evening of November 4 He re
membered the disasterous elec
tion night decimation of the
Democratic reign culminated in
mass concession and political
suicide. It smelled like victory.
Down the drain spilled the
Capitol Hill peanut farm, down
went Amy, the self-appointed
head of the NRC, down went the
cardigan industry.

In 12 years, the White House
had gone from heavy jowls, cats
and daughters to sons and dogs
to beer and brothers to ballet
dancers, horses and Gene
Autry.
He snapped out of his reverie.
His mission had begun. The
Calvin Coolidge dollar was
minted. Affirmative Action
went the way of all flesh, and the
Soviet Union became small,
think and very black. He
clustered the Supreme Court
with three brilliant jurists, each
a paragon of Bonzo's
philosophy: Chief Justice Strom
Thurmond, known for his liberal
interpretation of Civil Liberties
issues. Walter Cronkite for his
immutable grasp of the issues
and Danny Thomas, esteemed
for high ratings.
Life was a chore for Bonzo:
battleside chats, campaigning,
Hollywood, hamburger com
mercials. and his media image.
The media was. of course,
where it was.at. Horatio Alger
would have marveled at the me
dia magic: small bov from Illi
nois goes to Eureka College,
California, and the presidency.
The media convinced the Amer
ican people that Bonzo would
make everything all right again,
" cause if he wasn't telling the
truth, he couldn't say it." Even
the witch doctor agreed that
every one of Bonzo's words was
profoundly true.
The future was not as painless
as the people expected. Inflation
burgeoned, the market tipped,
the misery index was misery,
and the Social Welfare state was
eliminated in favor of the Gre
cian State. Bonzo died with a
smile on his face, knowing that
his "Fame, would live forever."
The American voters finally
met the full expectations of H.L.
Mencken and elected a garbage
collector. After all. he looked
good on the tube, thought a sepa
rate minimum wage for each
race was a good idea, and had no
interest in the principles or
heritage of American govern
ment He completed his prede
cessor's decree; he "made
America into what it used to be"
... a barren frozen wasteland.
And the hostage issue still
covered the front page.
