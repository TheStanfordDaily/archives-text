CPPC picketing
On October 31. a number of
concerned students picketed the
Career (Manning and Placement
Center (CPPC) to protest the
presence of several companies
involved in weapons production
These corporations were re
cruiting Stanford students for
jobs in the military-industrial
field. We oppose the work of
these companies in weapons
production and object to their
presence on campus.
These companies depend on
military contracts for their in
come. Because of this, weapons
manufacturers are one of the
strongest lobbying forces for
continual increases in military
spending Military equipment is
highly capital intensive — pro
viding few jobs for workers and
large profits for investors. Ex
penditures for weapons do not
recirculate in the economy to
the deprivation of other sectors.
A large part of the world's
population lives in poverty
while nations spend $450 billion
annually on warfare. These
companies directly undermine
world peace and stability: they
are the driving force behind the
arms race.
My allowing these companies
to use its facilities, the Univer
sity is giving tacit endorsement
to the work that they do. Rather
than aiding this work, the Uni
versity should set an example in
its approach to social problems.
We oppose the increased manu
facture and proliferation of
weapons and feel that weapons
manufacturers should not be
permitted the use of University
facilities
We urge the establishment of
a committee of students, facul
ty and workers to review the so
cial implications of the re
cruitment efforts of potential
interviewers. We invite the
CPPC board to meet with us and
discuss these issues.
Recruitment at Stanford is
but a small part of the increas
ing militarism in the U.S. Ac

tion we take on a local level has
impact on this worldwide prob
lem.

Fast for a day
Why a day of fasting?
How does one short day of
self-denial help the hungry?
Look inward first.
Only through experience do
we grow beyond intellectual
recognition "Gravity" gets off
the chalkboard and into our
lives with a drop of rain.
"Caloric undernutrition" like
wise stagnates as a nutri
tionist's definition until we per
sonally feel the first pains of
what is a daily condition for
much of the world. Things begin

to fall into place.
Impact is not impossible. The
translation of our experience
into restructuring of concerns
will build a dynamic foundation
for change. Personal dietary
modifications make sense; a
donation has meaning: a well
placed letter comes with care;
an extension of aid rests on a
shared concern.
Rhetoric is empty without un
derstanding.
Of course impact can't stop at
Stanford. Congress must learn
how we feel; business must be
come aware; technology must
adapt. Ignorance blocks the
solution. Our awareness has
power.
We can financially support
those who are directly involved
in the struggle against the social

roots of hunger. Organizations
like Oxlam and the Ecumenical
Hunger Project nn Palo Alto)
are making important gains,
but these depend entirely upon
individuals for their funding.
Donating money from our
food is far from token symbol
ism. Indeed, it transforms our
symbolism into effective ac
tion.
Please sign up for the fast.
Let yourself know hunger for
a day . show someone else you
know it. The hungry don't often
get a chance to speak for them
selves.

Surely Stanford will choose as
its symbol the fierce griffin over
run of the mill alternatives.
If so. then the fabulous beast
can promptly show its benign
side by giving its name to solve a
problem of confusion.
Every day numbers of mis
guided phone calls and visits are
made to the Med School's Hoo
ver Pavilion and to the Old
Pavilion. Change is painful, and
this could go on year after year
to the last bang or whimper.
But how glorious change
would be if the old. cavernous,
temple of sweat became Griffin
Oen.
