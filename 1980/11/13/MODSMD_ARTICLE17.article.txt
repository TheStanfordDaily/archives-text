After more than 30 years
without a squad. Stanford polo
players are again taking to the
field, as the perseverance of
senior Ainin and in
terested advisors and alumni
has led to the creation and rec
ognition by the athletic depart
ment of the Stanford Polo Club
Currently, about 16 men and
women are mounting up every
Sunday afternoon at nearby
Webb Ranch and learning the
' gentleman's game'' in which
they hope to be competing by
next spring.

Lakhani. the club's president,
had only played polo a few times
before last spring when he de
cided to place an ad in the Daily
staking persons interested in
forming a polo club
Meanwhile S IJasim Mehdi. a
senior research associate in the
chemistry department, had
been trying to revive polo here
for about four years. After he
saw ad. Mehdi con
tacted him and offered to assist
him both financially and in se
curing facilities and coaches
l-ast summer pres
ented a charter to the athletic
department which was recently
approved. Shirley School of the
athletic department said the
charter had all the necessary
elements ' including faculty ad
visers. financial support and "a
lot of student enthusiasm."
School said her only hesita
tion was the "safety factor."
but following Mehdi's assurance
that only experienced riders

would be actually playing the
game, thai all riding would be
strictly supervised and that pro
tective equipment would be
worn at all times. School said
she was satisfied the sport
would be safe "at least as safe
as football or rugby or some of
the other sports we have here "
Nlehdi. who has played polo
lor more than 30 years and for
merly ran the Oxford Univer
sity polo team in Kngland. ad
milted the high-speed sport is
dangerous, in fact he counted
eight broken bones attributable
to his hobby.
It's the only sport where
you're responsible for six legs,
two heads and a pair of hands."
\lehdi said, ' but the art of
training a team is to help the
students use the mallet as a
mallet and not as a sword We
can tram students to be safe."
The object of polo, which is
played on a four man or four

woman team > there is no co-ed
competition* is to hit a wooden
ball through a goal on a field 200
by 300 yards But — and this is
the tricky part the ball is hit
with a mallet by a rider
mounted on a horse travelling as

that the sport, which originated
in India and was brought to Kng
land and soon after America, in
the 19th century, demands from
its players unselfishness, the
ability to think ahead and faith
in one's teammates as well as
sound horsemanship and"the
ability to hit the ball at any
speed the horse can take you and
on all sides of the animal "

in the club now had had much
experience playing polo.
