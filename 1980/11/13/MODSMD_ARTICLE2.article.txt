Construction is scheduled to begin
next July on a new $36 million housing
facility which should be completed by
June. 1983. Dean of Residential
Education Norm Robinson told the
ASSU Senate last night.
The housing complex, which will be
situated to the west of Lagunita Court,
will consist of three independent
(row) houses, four connected houses
(with a single dining area), four
"suite'' buildings, four eating clubs
and one "program center.'' Robinson
said.
The independent houses will hold a
total of 180 students. The connected
houses, which resemble the present
Lagunita Court model, will hold a total
of 360. Finally, the suites will house
somewhere between 250 and 300 stu
dents. according to Robinson.
The program center will include a
photographic darkroom, music re
hearsal rooms and various storage
rooms.
Although the exact plans for inside
the buildings are far from being com
pleted. Robinson estimated that ap
proximately 50 percent of all the
rooms will be one room doubles. This
is largely due.he said, to the greater
expense of operating the more popular
two room doubles.
The suite buildings' rooms, how
ever. will be substantially different.
The suites will house from four to six
students. Each student will have a
small bedroom, but will share a com
mon living room with the rest of the
suite's members.
No kitchen
"The suite is essentially an apart
ment without a kitchen.'' Robinson ex
plained. "We think it takes the best
aspects of Manzanita and does away
with the greatest problem, which is
isolation.'"
Students who live in the suites
would belong to the eating clubs, he
said.
One thing students may notice right
away. Robinson continued, will be the
buildings' flat roofs. This, he ex
plained, will allow the new houses to
use solar power, should it become eco
nomically feasible.
"I don't know when it will be." he
said, "but the entire project will be
able to use solar power (if it were to
become affordable for the Univer
sity)."
All of the new housing will be co
