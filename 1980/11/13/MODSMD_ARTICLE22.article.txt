## Pavarotti of Puckermakes whistling art 
### Cindi Wheeler 
I'll have to admit. 1 had no
idea what to expect from a clas
sical whistler, and I approached
Tresidder lounge with trepida
tion But .lason Serinus. also
known as the "Pavarotti of
Pucker." captivated his au
dience last Thursday night with
what has to be one of the most
unique talents in this country
In a concert sponsored by
STARTS. Serinus. whistling to
an instrumental accompani
ment on tape, entertained a
group of about 30 people (ap
parently his concert here last
sflmmer attracted a larger
ctowd. free from the spectre of
niid-termsi with what he
termed the theme pieces of my
career."
.After doing some introduc
tory chatting with the audience.
Serinus began the performance
W'ith a rendition of an old Jean
ette Mac Donald tune. "San
Francisco." and dispelled any
apprehensions 1 might have had
His whistle sounded amazingly
like a real bird, albeit a very tal
ented one. Proving himself a
true performer, he danced and
sdft-shoed around the stage,
humming it up. throwing in
facial expression with his eyes
this mouth was. of course, oc
cupied i.
'Next, moving into the classi
cal repertoire for which he is fa
mous. he performed "Yoi Che
Sapete" from the Marriage of
Figaro by Mozart He enrap
tured the audience with his
pure, clear sopranic tone — an
opera singer could hardly have
done better. In contrast to his
previous number, this piece was
slow and dramatic. He literally
performed the part, his face
showing sadness, longing, and
the intense concentration that
would mark his whole per
formance.
Throughout the concert.
Serinus chatted with the au
dience. establishing a rapport
and setting an informal tone to
the evening. Interspersed be
tween numbers were anecdotes
about his start the began by
whistling Caruso), his career
(with performances ranging
from his debut on a radio station
in Berkeley to a recent ap
pearance on The John Davidson
Show), and several cynical
comments about the recent
election and the political scene.
Serinus also informed the au
dience that he had attended
Amherst College as an inde
pendent scholar until he decided
to "blow his life away. His
next number. "Somewhere

Over the Rainbow." convinced
the audience that his decision
was a blessing for music lovers
It it's possible tor a whistler.
Serinus showed the real emotion
of this .iuriv Garland song, and
his beautifully sustained high
notes were enough to send chills
up one's spine.
His next piece quickened the
pace and displayed his ver
satility — his rendition of Stevie
Wonder's You Are the Sun
shine of My Life" showed how
he has branched out from his be
ginning of only performing clas
sical music Hound it hard to be
lieve that 1 was listening to
someone whistling rather than
playing a musical instrument,
such was his command. He
tinally showed the toll that his
art takes on his mouth, reaching
for a glass of water several
times during the piece.
He followed this number with
the famous ior infamous i "Indi
an Love Call." The bizarre ac
companiment. which sounded
like a saw mimicking Jeanette
Mac Donald. sent the audience
into laughter. He ended the

piece by moving into the au
dience and serenading one wom
an while standing on a chair.
After a relaxing rendition of
James Taylor's "Up on the
Roof." Serinus moved back into
classical music. "D'amor
sillalli rosee" from II
Trovatore. a difficult piece
which he performed from mu
sic. showed an excellent com
mand ot the aria. ( He did admit,
though, that he wasn't always
sure if he performed the number
correctly, and for the first time
that evening sounded a little
breathv . i
' He then performed the piece
which he helped to win an
Emmy award; Puccini's "0
Mio Babbino Caro ' from the op
era (Hanni Schicci, which
Serinus performed for Woods
tock's debut in You're a Good
Shate. Charlie Broidn.
The slow romantic tempo of
this number." in which Serinus
again impressed the audience
with his powers of concentra
tion. led into the more modern,
but still laid back "Sunnv Side of
the Street." in which he re
marked while performing a bit

of soft-shoe that it made him
feel "debonair."
He began the second half of
the show with the slow, roman
tic Bachinanos Brasileiras No.
5." and then turned to "II
Miotersoro" from Mozart's Don
Giovanni.
Serinus then changed his
pace, and let the audience whis
tle along with him in "The Stars
and Stripes Forever." He then
performed a medley from Okla
homa. once again requesting au
dience participation.
His last three minutes, which
included one encore, exhibited
his perfect command of the aria
form and his affection for ro
mantic music. "Deindst Mein
Ganzes Herz" (Thine is My
Heart Alone) by Franz Lehar
was performed for the opening
of the new Boarding House in
San Francisco. his per
formance of it here was crystal
clear and moving. Puccini's
La Canzone di Doretta" from
La Rondine and Strauss's
"Standchen" ended the pro
gram in a romantic, melodic at
mosphere.
What made Serinus so memo

rable. was. besides the
uniqueness of his art. the fact
that he takes his whistling seri
ously. and makes his audience
respect his talent and skill rath
er than regard it as a joke. My
only complaint was that he
might have varied his pace
more, for the many arias proved
almost too relaxing for someone
who's not a great opera fan.
However, opera accounts for
only part of his repertoire, and
because this audience showed
an avid interest in classical mu
sic. this may have explained the
orientation of the concert
toward the aria.
.Jason Serinus's flexible ap
proach to whistling has led him
to perform for a variety of au
diences. ranging from children,
senior citizens and pop fans to
listeners at fairs, rodeos, wed
dings and even a funeral. It's too
bad that more people didn't take
advantage of the chance to hear
him last Thursday. His per
formance was truly entertain
ing ; and to the question. "But is
it art?" I would certainly have
to reply with an emphatic
"ves!"

Serinus then changed his
pace, and let the audience whis
tle along with him in "The Stars
and Stripes Forever." He then
performed a medley from Okla
homa. once again requesting au
dience participation.
His last three minutes, which
included one encore, exhibited
his perfect command of the aria
form and his affection for ro
mantic music. "Deindst Mein
Ganzes Herz" (Thine is My
Heart Alone) by Franz Lehar
was performed for the opening
of the new Boarding House in
San Francisco. his per
formance of it here was crystal
clear and moving. Puccini's
La Canzone di Doretta" from
La Rondine and Strauss's
"Standchen" ended the pro
gram in a romantic, melodic at
mosphere.
What made Serinus so memo

rable. was. besides the
uniqueness of his art. the fact
that he takes his whistling seri
ously. and makes his audience
respect his talent and skill rath
er than regard it as a joke. My
only complaint was that he
might have varied his pace
more, for the many arias proved
almost too relaxing for someone
who's not a great opera fan.
However, opera accounts for
only part of his repertoire, and
because this audience showed
an avid interest in classical mu
sic. this may have explained the
orientation of the concert
toward the aria.
.Jason Serinus's flexible ap
proach to whistling has led him
to perform for a variety of au
diences. ranging from children,
senior citizens and pop fans to
listeners at fairs, rodeos, wed
dings and even a funeral. It's too
bad that more people didn't take
advantage of the chance to hear
him last Thursday. His per
formance was truly entertain
ing ; and to the question. "But is
it art?" I would certainly have
to reply with an emphatic
"ves!"


Jason Serinus
I'll have to admit. 1 had no
idea what to expect from a clas
sical whistler, and I approached
Tresidder lounge with trepida
tion But .lason Serinus. also
known as the "Pavarotti of
Pucker." captivated his au
dience last Thursday night with
what has to be one of the most
unique talents in this country
In a concert sponsored by
STARTS. Serinus. whistling to
an instrumental accompani
ment on tape, entertained a
group of about 30 people (ap
parently his concert here last
sflmmer attracted a larger
ctowd. free from the spectre of
niid-termsi with what he
termed the theme pieces of my
career."
.After doing some introduc
tory chatting with the audience.
Serinus began the performance
W'ith a rendition of an old Jean
ette Mac Donald tune. "San
Francisco." and dispelled any
apprehensions 1 might have had
His whistle sounded amazingly
like a real bird, albeit a very tal
ented one. Proving himself a
true performer, he danced and
sdft-shoed around the stage,
humming it up. throwing in
facial expression with his eyes
this mouth was. of course, oc
cupied i.
'Next, moving into the classi
cal repertoire for which he is fa
mous. he performed "Yoi Che
Sapete" from the Marriage of
Figaro by Mozart He enrap
tured the audience with his
pure, clear sopranic tone — an
opera singer could hardly have
done better. In contrast to his
previous number, this piece was
slow and dramatic. He literally
performed the part, his face
showing sadness, longing, and
the intense concentration that
would mark his whole per
formance.
Throughout the concert.
Serinus chatted with the au
dience. establishing a rapport
and setting an informal tone to
the evening. Interspersed be
tween numbers were anecdotes
about his start the began by
whistling Caruso), his career
(with performances ranging
from his debut on a radio station
in Berkeley to a recent ap
pearance on The John Davidson
Show), and several cynical
comments about the recent
election and the political scene.
Serinus also informed the au
dience that he had attended
Amherst College as an inde
pendent scholar until he decided
to "blow his life away. His
next number. "Somewhere

Over the Rainbow." convinced
the audience that his decision
was a blessing for music lovers
It it's possible tor a whistler.
Serinus showed the real emotion
of this .iuriv Garland song, and
his beautifully sustained high
notes were enough to send chills
up one's spine.
His next piece quickened the
pace and displayed his ver
satility — his rendition of Stevie
Wonder's You Are the Sun
shine of My Life" showed how
he has branched out from his be
ginning of only performing clas
sical music Hound it hard to be
lieve that 1 was listening to
someone whistling rather than
playing a musical instrument,
such was his command. He
tinally showed the toll that his
art takes on his mouth, reaching
for a glass of water several
times during the piece.
He followed this number with
the famous ior infamous i "Indi
an Love Call." The bizarre ac
companiment. which sounded
like a saw mimicking Jeanette
Mac Donald. sent the audience
into laughter. He ended the

piece by moving into the au
dience and serenading one wom
an while standing on a chair.
After a relaxing rendition of
James Taylor's "Up on the
Roof." Serinus moved back into
classical music. "D'amor
sillalli rosee" from II
Trovatore. a difficult piece
which he performed from mu
sic. showed an excellent com
mand ot the aria. ( He did admit,
though, that he wasn't always
sure if he performed the number
correctly, and for the first time
that evening sounded a little
breathv . i
' He then performed the piece
which he helped to win an
Emmy award; Puccini's "0
Mio Babbino Caro ' from the op
era (Hanni Schicci, which
Serinus performed for Woods
tock's debut in You're a Good
Shate. Charlie Broidn.
The slow romantic tempo of
this number." in which Serinus
again impressed the audience
with his powers of concentra
tion. led into the more modern,
but still laid back "Sunnv Side of
the Street." in which he re
marked while performing a bit

of soft-shoe that it made him
feel "debonair."

the show with the slow, roman
tic Bachinanos Brasileiras No.

sical music Hound it hard to be
lieve that 1 was listening to
someone whistling rather than
playing a musical instrument,
such was his command. He
tinally showed the toll that his
art takes on his mouth, reaching
for a glass of water several
times during the piece.
He followed this number with
the famous ior infamous i "Indi
an Love Call." The bizarre ac
companiment. which sounded
like a saw mimicking Jeanette
Mac Donald. sent the audience
into laughter. He ended the

piece by moving into the au
dience and serenading one wom
an while standing on a chair.
After a relaxing rendition of
James Taylor's "Up on the
Roof." Serinus moved back into
classical music. "D'amor
sillalli rosee" from II
Trovatore. a difficult piece
which he performed from mu
sic. showed an excellent com
mand ot the aria. ( He did admit,
though, that he wasn't always
sure if he performed the number
correctly, and for the first time
that evening sounded a little
breathv . i
' He then performed the piece
which he helped to win an
Emmy award; Puccini's "0
Mio Babbino Caro ' from the op
era (Hanni Schicci, which
Serinus performed for Woods
tock's debut in You're a Good
Shate. Charlie Broidn.
The slow romantic tempo of
this number." in which Serinus
again impressed the audience
with his powers of concentra
tion. led into the more modern,
but still laid back "Sunnv Side of
the Street." in which he re
marked while performing a bit

of soft-shoe that it made him
feel "debonair."
He began the second half of
the show with the slow, roman
tic Bachinanos Brasileiras No.
5." and then turned to "II
Miotersoro" from Mozart's Don
Giovanni.
Serinus then changed his
pace, and let the audience whis
tle along with him in "The Stars
and Stripes Forever." He then
performed a medley from Okla
homa. once again requesting au
dience participation.
His last three minutes, which
included one encore, exhibited
his perfect command of the aria
form and his affection for ro
mantic music. "Deindst Mein
Ganzes Herz" (Thine is My
Heart Alone) by Franz Lehar
was performed for the opening
of the new Boarding House in
San Francisco. his per
formance of it here was crystal
clear and moving. Puccini's
La Canzone di Doretta" from
La Rondine and Strauss's
"Standchen" ended the pro
gram in a romantic, melodic at
mosphere.
What made Serinus so memo

rable. was. besides the
uniqueness of his art. the fact
that he takes his whistling seri
ously. and makes his audience
respect his talent and skill rath
er than regard it as a joke. My
only complaint was that he
might have varied his pace
more, for the many arias proved
almost too relaxing for someone
who's not a great opera fan.
However, opera accounts for
only part of his repertoire, and
because this audience showed
an avid interest in classical mu
sic. this may have explained the
orientation of the concert
toward the aria.
.Jason Serinus's flexible ap
proach to whistling has led him
to perform for a variety of au
diences. ranging from children,
senior citizens and pop fans to
listeners at fairs, rodeos, wed
dings and even a funeral. It's too
bad that more people didn't take
advantage of the chance to hear
him last Thursday. His per
formance was truly entertain
ing ; and to the question. "But is
it art?" I would certainly have
to reply with an emphatic
"ves!"
