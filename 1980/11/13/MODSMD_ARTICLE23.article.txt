# Women's plays miss the mark

### Hillary Hall 
Art generally gains in in
tensity by limitation, but this
is not the case with the One
Act Theatre Company of San
Francisco's series Three
Women Playwrights. The
three plays — American
Modern by Joanna Glass,
Scream Your Head Off by
Deborah Rogin and Ques
tionnaire by Leslie Brodv —
are funny and pertinent
analyses of the loss of human
dignity in modern society,
but there are certain dra
matic failings in each that
lessen the impact of their
pertinency.
Each contains the neces
sary components of a suc
cessful one-act play — the
narrow focus, the single set
ting that draws on an implied
outside world, and unique
characters that are yet close
enough to stereotype to sug
gest overarching human
traits — but they lack the ori
ginal voice that earmarks a
good play.
The first. American
Modern, picks away at the
comfortable facade of the
happy and successful
modern American couple,
revealing the ignominy of
that success. It is a witty
study of urban blight — "I
may be crazy, but at least
I'm articulate" — in which
the husband takes a lover and
composes suicide notes in his
spare time while his wife
spends her days collecting
bits of paper and glass from
Long Island gutters to "fill
the empty spaces." At the
end they accept each other
very lyrically, separated in
their sorrows but content at
oeing thus cubby-holed to
gether.
But there are structural
and thematic problems with
this play which undermine
its dramatic success. There
is nothing really startling
(outside of the deft, witty
dialogue) about either the
author s analysis or the ac
tors' portrayal of character.
Mike, the husband, played by
Ronald Meszaros. is a
sparsely developed charac
ter whose flatness stands out
against the richness of the
wife (Wanda McCaddon).
The realism of the play,
which generally follows in
the Ibsen tradition, is signifi

cantlv weakened in two
places late in the play where
direct addresses to the au
dience break the mode and
atmosphere of the play.
Kogin's Scream Your
Head Off is flawed as well in
being not only another play
about a Vietnam vet's psy
chosis. but in being an over
zealous and therefore inef
fective attempt. Rogin does
not provide us with a suffi
cient objective correlative
for the pathos she intends
Scream Your Head Off so vi
olently to convey. It is alter
nately funny and frightening,
which allows for a full girth
of facial contortions, but is a
bit too obvious a manipu
lation and ultimately falls
short of impact. This is most
ly a thematic problem —
trying to write originally
about an already exploited
subject matter The actors
respond well to the variety of
emotions they are asked to
express.
In the final play. Question
naire, playwright Leslie
Brodv puts American con
sumer culture under an
amusing but unpenetrating
spotlight. Two women, one
an agoraphobic, frightened
by cancerous streets and sus
tained by news clips and Jun
ior Mints, and the other an
old bawd whose once lusty
life has degenerated into the
dustbin existence of a late
night janitor, are visited by a
third who goes from house to
house with a questionnaire
interviewing people about
the last time they went to the
grocery store. It is all very
funny, but it means very lit
tle. Brodv is only playing on
the surface of the alienation
that these characters feel.
Like both of the other
plays. Questionnaire is es
sentially well-crafted, but it
and the others lack the con
sistency and originality
which mark a truly good
play. These are young plavs
written by low profile play
wrights who are still ex
perimenting with the form.
Focus and scope are not as
sharply defined as they
might be. and the authors'
voices not as unique. But
they are enjoyable plavs. and
the One Act Theatre Com
pany is to be commended for
recognizing them.
