# 'Three Acts' highlights possibilities of connection

### Stephen Nash 
Botho Strauss is a young Ger
man expressionist playwright
He has written four plays The
Hypochondriac (1971); Famil
iar Faces, Mixed Fccltogs
(19741. Three Acts of Recog
nition (197H); and Hifi and Little
(1978i Unfortunately. Strauss's
work has rarely been performed
in this country, and (except for
Rig and Little and his novel De
votion) is not available in Kng
lish translation
Strauss is part of an active ex
pressionist movement in thea
ter. literature, and film in Ger
many and Austria today. His
work is reminiscent of the plays
and novels of Feter Handke. and
the films of Fassbinder and
Herzog. One goal of this move
ment is to make us more con
scious of. and to help us to un
derstand. the commonplaces in
our lives This is done in many
ways, by taking very common
events out of context and high
lighting them, by using very
stylized acting techniques; by
putting common events into un
usual settings; and by having
everyday events acted out by
unfamiliar characters (this
technique has been used very ef
fectively by Fassbinder).
Because our everyday act ions
and speeches are often made
without a great deal of thought,
devices such as these are neces
sary in order to force us to think
about them. In fact, the actions
are often so familiar that we are
frequently not even conscious of
what we are saying and doing.
Three Acts of Recognition (at
the Julian Theatre in San Fran
cisco) uses the first of these
techniques — taking very com
mon events out of context and
highlighting them. Strauss has
set Three Acts of Recognition in
an art gallery during the pre
view showing of a new exhibit
entitled "Capitalist Realism."
The play shows moments in the
lives of the 17 people at the gal
lery that afternoon. One of the
paintings in the exhibit bitterly
satirizes one of the gallery di
rectors. In order to avoid the
scandal of censoring one paint
ing. the directors are trying to
close the whole show. The con
troversy over the painting,
though, is far less significant
than the interchanges among

the people at the gallery
As the title suggests, the play
is in three acts (entitled "Little
Society." No one m Farticu
lar and "Good Connections").
The play is further subdivided
into 1H small scenes, and vet
further into about 50 "shots 1 I
say "shots' because the techni
ques used are very cinematic.
Most of the shots are separated
by blackouts, giving the effect
of rough-cuts; the rest are sepa
rated by changing the group of
characters on stage, giving the
effect of different camera an
gles.
There are other reasons why I
use the terminology of film to
describe this play. Because the
running time of the play is ap
proximately three hours (if you
include the pfologue), and the
time within the play is also
about three hours, this play sug
gests cinema write. The in
significance of certain shots
(one shot just has the charac
ters searching on the floor for a
packet of film > also hints at this
genre. There are obvious par
allels to Robert Altman and (as
I mentioned above) filmmakers
such as Fassbinder and Herzog.
The characters are on stage
mingling through the gallery
while the audience is being
seated and during in
termissions. This serves sever
al purposes. First of all. it in
forms us. even before the play
begins, that the scenes are
merely fragments out of the
characters' lives. Strauss has
chosen revealing speeches out
of a much larger collection of in
terchanges in order to help us
understand (or at least get to
know) the characters on stage.
Another important purpose of
this device is that it helps us to
become familiar with the char
acters before the play begins. In
a play with 17 roles, just keeping
track of the people on stage
could have been very confusing.
Strauss does not seem to want
us to identify with the charac
ters on stage, but merely to rec
ognize them. They are certainly
recognizable. During in
termissions. it was easy to mix
up members of the cast with
members of the audience. But
the style of dialogue, with topics
changing very abruptly and
sometimes absurdly, makes

identification difficult
Many of the characters do not
have great individuality but
merely represent functional
types of people In his later play
Big and Little i and especially in
the scene "Ten Rooms" from
that collection, where Strauss
again uses the blackout techni
que i. this idea is carried much
further The dialogue there is
even more absurdist and many
of the characters do not have
names — they are referred to
only by their function, such as
Fat Woman, Guitar Flayer and
Research Assistant (bovi.
Straliss is very pessimistic
about the possibilities for indi
viduals making solid emotional
connections with one another. In
this play, there are couples, but
there are no successful rela
tionships. and communication

between people seems difficult
or hopeless.
Strauss does not treat this
topic m a very depressing way
He thinks that when we are
having trouble communicating
with other people, we may pos
sibly be able to see ourselves
more clearly The absurdity of
our actions at times of isolation
is very revealing The quotation
chosen to preface the plav reads
i il my rough translation is to be
trusted). "When in my fearful
heart an absurdity awakens, an
eye opens in the middle of my
skull.''
The characters in Three Acts
of Recognition are constantly
trying to make contact with one
another, using whatever clumsy
means are at their disposal.
Often this takes the form of

abrupt and awkward attempts
at sexual contact with other peo
ple. But sometimes it is in the
form of cocktail-partv con
versation. artv' pronounce
ments. or (and this is often the
most successful) arguments
1 sense that Strauss is not
worried that people are not
making effective contact with
one another; he seems more
concerned that we might think
that we should be making more
effective contact with one an
other For Strauss, lack of com
munication is the more natural
situation With many lines like
Where are there any connec
tions'.'' Live from one separa
tion to the next and "No one
else is concerned with your
life." Strauss's point of view
seems quite clear I admit that
some of these lines refer to the

art exhibit rather than to the
characters, but there is con
siderable evidence (such as the
last line of the play i that the
characters and situations in the
plav are to be treated as part of
the exhibit as well
In a play entitled Three Acts
of Recognition involving 17
characters. 50 shots, and many
topics, there is a great danger
that you will only recognize the
ideas you understand or that are
familiar to you I have ignored
here, for instance, the political
issues surrounding the satirical
painting But I think that the
emphasis of the dialogue, and
the technical structure of the
play, is on the separation be
tween people. The blackouts,
tor example, tend to separate
incidents which are not actually
separate (the blackouts do not

always represent the passage of
time or the end of a conversa
tion! Thus, the audience is
forced to focus on small frag
ments i»l time And the absence
of a successful couple in every*
thing I have read bv Strauss is
quite remarkable
Many authors have discussed
the alienation common in the
late 2()th century society. So
many, in tact, that it has be
come something of a joke.
Strauss is a better playwright
than most Like a good photog
rapher. he has an excellent
sense of which" images are il
luminating He has a good ear
for natural speech patterns His
plays flow well, with many light
touches of absurdist humor And
he has certainly tilled his gal
lery with an interesting collec
tion of people
