# Sayles' folks hold on as prospects fade
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
Nostalgia tor the l%os is so popular
now that it may be difficult to keep in
mind that because those of us who grew
up in those years are still so close to them
- and still so young — our perspective is
bound to be off center, filtered through
the lingering traces of the romanticism
of those times John Sayles s Return of
the Secaucus Seven is not an attempt to
recapture the mood of the '60s like the
disastrous .A Small Circle of Friends — it
is about a group of friends who ex
perienced the 60s together and now. at SO
or thereabouts, are confronting crises
separation from lovers ino one in the
group is married i. friends' separating
trom lovers, career decisions (which for
these people, who strive to cling to their
anti-establishment ideals, involves a
high degree of moral anxiety i.the fading
prospect of having children with any fa
cility. This must be the best way for a
refugee from that decade to write about
it now.
Sayles. who is nearing 30 himself,
wrote, produced, directed, edited and
took a supporting role in Secaucus Sev
en, and. mostly relying on funds he
earned by writing screenplays for Roger
t'orman. he brought the picture in for
$60,000 It ;s very badly directed, the
sound is inconsistent, and at times the
lighting is so poor that we can't make out
the characters in a scene right away: it
looks, in short, like a home movie. But it
is wonderful

was nominated for a National Book

mini-societies that, either because they
are comprised ot eccentrics or are highly
specialized ot considered passe, reside,
emotionally and spiritually, on the per
iphery of the country while seeming to
participate in it Sayles seems to have an
insider's view of the truckers in l-80Ne

lines that catch not only the turns of
phrase of individuals but their speech
rhythms as well, and the tensions that
direct these rhythms
The generation of the '60s talked more
loudly and more openly about more top
ics. probably, than any that preceded it.
this latitude ot potential for dialogue has
clearly inspired Sayles. who provides
some of the wittiest, most original con
versation in American movies. There
are virtual monologues in which charac
ters express their worries, dialogues in
which two people attempt to get at the
cause of the hostility between them, ten
tative. probing explorations of sexual
possibilities, jokey routines from TV and
radio and old movies; playful exchanges
during games ot charades, volleyball,
basketball and Clue i has there ever been
a generation of more avid game
players 'i; reminiscences of a very spe
cial nature. Sayles examines his c harac
ters' efforts to be warm without being
sentimental, what provokes them, what
embarrasses them, what rekindles their
old enthusiasms. Secaucus Seven is so

enormously entertaining that one may
