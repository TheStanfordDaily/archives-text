Reagan prepares for budget cuts
Washington — Advisers to President-elect Ronald Re
agan have drawn a list of possible government cutbacks to
taling nearly 6 percent of the 1981 federal budget, a princi
pal aide to Reagan disclosed yesterday.
The areas where the cuts would be made were not dis
closed. although it was indicated that none would be made
in the defense budget.
Edwin Meese. who is directing the Reagan transition

into the White House, sard a spending control task force
drew up the list so that Reagan could fulfill a campaign
pledge to cut the budget by 2 percent
Democrats on the House Budget Committee challenged
Reagan to honor that promise by voting Tuesday to set a
budget celling that would force the president-elect to cut
spending by $17 billion from the current budget drafted by
the committee's staff
The committee action would reduce the budget from
$648 7 billion t05631 7 billion and reduce the projected defi
cit from $38 4 billion to $25 billion
A budget reduction of 6 percent in 1981 would equal near
ly $39 billion, enough to wipe out the entire deficit
One of Reagan's top campaign pledges was to trim fed
eral spending by 2 percent by eliminating fraud, waste,
abuse and mismanagement from the budget
Asked how the new president would accomplish that
goal. Meese said a special task force already had targeted
areas relating to "specific tightening up. specific cutting
ot administrative overhead rather than cutting of whole
programs." although "some minor programs'' may be
eliminated altogether.

Gas tax increase proposed
San Francisco — Claiming that California's transporta
tion system could be more than $1 billion in debt by 1986.
state officials yesterday recommended increasing reven
ues by hiking the gasoline tax and Motor Vehicle Depart-

ment fees
The California Transportation Commission proposed
raising the tax on gas at the pump from 7 cents a gallon to 8
percent of the total purchase For example, if gasoline
costs $1 25 a gallon, the new tax would be 10 cents
Estimates of the potential deficit in the 1981-1986 State
Transportation Improvement Program budget ranged
from $915 million by the Department of Transportation to
as much as $2 4 billion by state Legislative Analyst Wil
liam Hamm
It has become painfully apparent that the state trans
portation program is no longer capable of generating
stable or sufficient revenues." Commission Chairman
Dean Meyer told a hearing of the state Senate Transporta
tion Committee.
Diet helps sickle cell anemia patients
Boston — Agonizing pam that is one of sickle cell
anemia's worst side effects may be prevented by a new
form o! treatment that slightly changes the chemical
makeup of the victims' blood, doctors have found.
The treatment is not a cure for sickle cell anemia, but
the researchers say it appears to be a relatively simple
way to tree victims of their most painful symptoms.
So far. however, they have tested the new treatment on
only three patients and the doctors stress that more stud-

les are needed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the
treatment before it is widely used
Doctors developed the new method, which uses medi
cine and diet to lower sodium levels in the victims' blood,
at two Harvard-affiliated hospitals in Boston Their re
search was published in today's issue of the .Vew England
