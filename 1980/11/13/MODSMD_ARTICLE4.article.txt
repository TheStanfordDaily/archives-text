# Campus goes for Carter, other Democrats
## Stanford bucks conservative trend 
### Cameron Smith 
Although he predicted victory for
himself with the quip. "As Stanford
goes, so goes the nation," former In
dependent presidential candidate
John Anderson proved to be wrong on
two counts.
The nation, first of all. did not go
with Stanford.
Furthermore, the Stanford com
munity. which in a pre-election straw
poll chose the maverick Illinois con
gressman by a decisive margin, ended
up voting by an even wider margin for
Democratic President Jimmy Carter.
In other races, Stanford voters
bucked the national trend toward Re

publican candidates and conservative
politics by opposing the draft, favor
ing the establishment of smoking and
non-smoking areas in public places,
and supporting several Democratic
candidates.
Returns from the nine precincts on
campus and in the "faculty ghetto."
obtained at the Santa Clara County
Registrar of Voters, showed Stanford
selected Carter by 45.7 percent over
Anderson, who received 28.7 percent.
California may be "Reagan Coun
try" on the whole, but the Republican
president-elect, who won 51 percent of
the national vote, garnered just 21.3
percent here.

Stanford's presidential vote liter
ally turned its straw poll results up
side down, at least between Anderson
and Carter. In that ASSU-sponsored
vot3 on Oct. 29. Anderson defeated
Carter 42.4 to 25.6 percent.
The precincts represent 5986 regis
tered voters, of whom 4356. or 73
percent, voted last Tuesday. These
figures thus do not tell how off-campus
and absentee voters behaved at the
polls, and perhaps reflect primarily
the undergraduate on-campus vote.
But this cross-section of faculty and
student voters still provides the
closest possible estimate of the "Stan
ford vote."

The community's solid support for
Republican Congressman Paul
"Pete'' McCloskev was an exception
to it's predominately democratic
vote. In the race between McCloskev
and his three opponents. Stanford vot
ers chose McCloskev. though by a
smaller winning margin than in the
district as a whole.
Stanford's margin of victory for
Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston, who
until Nov. 4 was Senate Majority whip,
was substantially larger than that giv
en him by the state electorate. Univer
sity voters chose the leading liberal
over Republican tax crusader Paul
Gann by 83 to 13 percent.
Similarly, voters here gave a huge
margin to Democrat Byron Sher. a
Stanford Law professor and former
two-term mayor of Palo Alto, in his
successful state assembly bid over
Republican Greg Morris.
Stanford overwhelmingly favored
Measure C. which asked Santa Clara
County voters if they opposed peace
time military conscription. The vote
in the county as a whole, however,
showed county voters favoring the
peacetime draft by a large per
centage.
On Proposition 10. which would
have required separate smoking and
non-smoking areas in public places.

Stanford again differed with the state
electorate, which narrowly defeated
the measure.
Third party candidates did slightly
better among Stanford voters than the
general public, but even here their
tallies were generally quite low. In the
presidential race. Libertarian Ed
('lark and Citizen's Party candidate
Harry Commoner each received about
two percent of the Stanford vote, and
Libertarians David Bergland. Hill Ev
ers and Chuck Olson each placed third
in the senatorial, congressional and
assembly races, respectively.
The voter turnout of 73 percent was
significantly higher than nationwide,
but lagged somewhat behind both the
county and state figures.
