How does a couple in which both
partners work decide who takes out
the garbage, or who fixes the dinner?
The distribution of domestic responsi
bilities was one of several topics ad
dressed at a lecture/symposium
called "The Dual-Career Couple:
Making it Work,'' which was spon
sored by the Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) last Tues
day night.
Other topics addressed included the
division of time between career and
family, competition and jealousy in
careers, and employer helpfulness or
hindrance in dual-career rela
tionships. The two-hour presentation
was led by a panel of three couples. Al
though the three couples were mar
ried. the presentation was intended to
apply to any couple living together.
Richard Reis, who coordinated the
presentation with his wife Iris, called
the symposium "an introduction to the
situation of dual-career couples and
how people deal with it." He said he
and his wife chose couples with differ

ing circumstances to offer a diverse
selection of ways to make a dual-ca
reer situation work.
Ken and Sarah Church have been
married just over one year and are
both in their mid-30s. Because they
both were single for a long time, their
marriage has combined two independ
ent lifestyles, the Churches said.
Both Churches are employed in pub
lic schools — she as a teacher and he
as a counselor — which allows them to
spend a good deal of time together.
Furthermore. Ken Church said he
does not consider his job a "career."
"My wife is my first priority," Church
said.
Keith and Sue Gilbert are both high
ly paid corporate executives. They
have one six-year-old child, and said
that "one is enough."
The Gilberts both stressed the im
portance of planning for the time
necesssarv to raise a child while
pursuing a career. (Sue Gilbert thinks
of herself as a "package deal'' with
her husband and daughter and all in
clusive responsibilities.)

Both Gilberts said they feel for
tunate to work for firms that are un
derstanding of their family situation.
Since they are both in managerial
positions, they said thev can help sub
ordinates work out the problems of
dual-career family responsibilities.
Rolf and Florence Hier have had ex
tensive experience in raising a family
in a dual-career environment. Mar
ried while attending Stanford 31 years
ago. they have raised three children
;ind now enjoy devoting their time ex
clusively to their careers.
"Florence got the short end of the
stick in developing her career poten
tial." said Rolf, noting that she had to
change her job many times to accom
modate her children's schedules as
well as her husband's mobile occupa
tion
Most recently, however, it was a job
opportunity for her that brought the
Hiers out to California from Michigan.
All three couples agreed that divid
ing their domestic responsibilities
equally is the hardest part of dual-ca-
