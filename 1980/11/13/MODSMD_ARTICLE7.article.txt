Pasadena — Voyager I soared past
Saturn's banded yellow cloud tf ps yes
terday. buzzed about a half-dozen
cratered, frozen moons and shocked
busy scientists with a bizarre
"braided" ringlet within the planet's
shining rings. It then began a long,
lonely journey toward the stars.
"The results have been just
absolutely astounding.'" said Bradford
Smith, head of the Voyager camera
team. "We're seeing new things so re
mote from our experience that we're
not able to come up with even a hint of
a suggestion as to what some of them
are."
The fast-paced tour of Saturn's ex
otic realm climaxed an exploratory
voyage of 38 months and 1.24 billion
miles. Scientists will be analyzing and
arguing for years to come over the
hundreds of pictures and mountains of
data.
The robot spaceship made its
closest approach to Saturn — about
77.CHK) miles from the planet — at 3 :46

p.m. PST. but radio signals announc
ing the successful passage needed an
hour and 25 minutes to cover the 947
million miles from Saturn to the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory here.
Ringlets
Sailing beneath the famous rings,
where Voyager already had revealed
puzzling complexity, the ship found
two narrow ringlets that almost ap
pear entwined like crude braids and
"it boggles the mind that that even ex
ists." Smith said.
He said scientists could not explain
the strange structure which was dis
covered in the narrow, outer ribbon,
called the F ring.
Voyager, reaching speeds of more
than 56.500 mph, showed earthbound
scientists complex motions within the
softly colored clouds that are Saturn's
only surface. As the planet grew
before Voyager's cameras, the
washed-out yellowish sphere dis
played ribbons and swirls, halos and
spots where winds played with the
haze-covered atmosphere

En route to its rendezvous with
Saturn, a gas-filled ball big enough to
hold 800 Earths, the ship turned its
cameras and instruments on some of
the 15 Saturnian moons. Except for
giant Titan, they seem to be made of
what one scientist called "dirty ice."
Images showed details never seen
before on the moons' icy surfaces: a
long, deep canyon cutting across 500
miles of Tethvs; a peaked hill sur
rounded bv a huge crater spread over
nearly a fourth of Mimas: circular
meteoritic craters surrounded by
bright rays on Dione: and the pocked,
streaked and blotchy surface of Hhea
Search for moons
As Voyager sped away from Saturn,
it also searched the region for any as
yet undiscovered moons and probed
the broad rings for clues to the size and
composition of the particles that com
pose them
Late yesterday President Jimmy
Carter telephoned his congratulations
to the Voyager team for "a superb sci

Voyager I transmitted this picture of Saturn to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena as it sped by the planet's
turbulent surface. Voyager II will reach Saturn in August, 1981.
