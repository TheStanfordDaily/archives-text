Tehran,lran Agence France-
Presse — Iran, which already
was facing consumer shortages,
entered a war economy Mon
day. following recent official
austerity decisions

ing ration cards, whose colors
vary according to family size.
The cards are for five different
types of consumer goods, one of
which is already known: sugar
Other recently announced
measures, like the tripling of
the price of gasoline and tighter
exchange controls, are said by
the government also to aim at
cutting import costs because of
the fall in oil revenue, at a time
when the war with Iraq is mak
ing inflation and unemployment
worse.
The authorities seem equally
determined to control in a more
systematic manner the distribu
tion of scarce consumer goods

in certain districts of Tehran
have been issuing "protein
cards" that also facilitate the
purchase of soap powder, min
eral oil and cigarettes.

and scooters, is tripled and for
private vehicles gasoline is ra
tioned at about eight gallons a
week. Domestic fuel, the coun

limited to about five gallons a
week

want to travel abroad will only
be allowed to take a maximum
of $100
Shortages, whose most man
ifest signs are the long lines of
cars outside gasoline stations
along with electricity cuts, are
experienced in different ways,
according to various Tehran dis
tricts.

find certain imported products
like eggs. meat. rice, and soap,
in the bourgeois northern dis
trict than in southern Tehran,
where the poor live.

Domestic sacrifices
Tehran,lran Agence France-
Presse — Iran, which already
was facing consumer shortages,
entered a war economy Mon
day. following recent official
austerity decisions
Monday the banks began issu
ing ration cards, whose colors
vary according to family size.
The cards are for five different
types of consumer goods, one of
which is already known: sugar
Other recently announced
measures, like the tripling of
the price of gasoline and tighter
exchange controls, are said by
the government also to aim at
cutting import costs because of
the fall in oil revenue, at a time
when the war with Iraq is mak
ing inflation and unemployment
worse.
The authorities seem equally
determined to control in a more
systematic manner the distribu
tion of scarce consumer goods
For the past two weeks mosques
in certain districts of Tehran
have been issuing "protein
cards" that also facilitate the
purchase of soap powder, min
eral oil and cigarettes.
The price of gasoline for cars.

excepting taxis, utility vehicles
and scooters, is tripled and for
private vehicles gasoline is ra
tioned at about eight gallons a
week. Domestic fuel, the coun
try's main means of heaitng. is
limited to about five gallons a
week
In addition. Iranians who
want to travel abroad will only
be allowed to take a maximum
of $100
Shortages, whose most man
ifest signs are the long lines of
cars outside gasoline stations
along with electricity cuts, are
experienced in different ways,
according to various Tehran dis
tricts.
It is easier, for instance, to
find certain imported products
like eggs. meat. rice, and soap,
in the bourgeois northern dis
trict than in southern Tehran,
where the poor live.
