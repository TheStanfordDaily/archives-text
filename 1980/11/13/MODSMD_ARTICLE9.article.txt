New Delhi, India â€” Brahma Chellanev. a
graduate student, received the first propagan
da broadside only two months after enrolling in
the disarmament studies program at
Jawaharlal Nehru University here
It was from the U.S. International Com
munications Agency, formerly the U.S. In
formation Agency. The following day. a vol
ume entitled "The Great Speeches of Leonid I
Brezhnev'' arrived, compliments of the Soviet
Embassy.
Within weeks the West Germans were send
ing Chellaney a weekly magazine about Indo-
German affairs. From the British came an oc
casional item highlighting their involvement
with India. Next came invitations to lectures,

"I never asked for any of it."he said. "It just

It is the superpowers, the United States and
the Soviet Union, that dominate this struggle
and they do so with completely opposite
strategies, tactics and styles.
For the Soviets. India is a top-priority na

tural exchanges and mountains of paper to pep

message that the Soviet Union is a nation that
cares about people, cares about India and will
continue to be a reliable ally.
Although their efforts are often un
sophisticated and crude, their message ap

Washington counters with a highly sophisti

With the help of a computer, the Interna

such issues as North-South economics and in

The U.S. program, which used to be far more
broadly based, narrowed its focus in the early

6000 so-called highest-priority contacts who
are considered to be the keepers of India's na
