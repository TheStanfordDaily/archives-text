# Proper care can preserve expensive equipment

The sounds are all too famil

from the cassette drops to a low
hum, then to a quicker gargling
noise, and finally . . . silence.

the listener dives for his
cassette deck to save his
cassette from a cruel fate. But
alas, it is too late. The deck has
already digested the ribbon into
its rollers and mangled it
beyond repair. Cursing his mali
cious tape player, the listener
does not realize that, because of
poor stereo maintenance, he is
the true criminal.

maintenance of the
turntables themselves,
not much can he done

Although faulty stereo equip
ment and flawed tapes or re
cords are occasionally the cause
of damage to tapes and discs, it
is usually poor maintenance
that incurs the malfunction. Be
cause of the expense of stereo
equipment, tapes and records,
proper care for a music system
can save money in the long run,
as well as guarantee a better
sound.
Concerning the maintenance

of the two most widely used
forms of music — tapes
(cassette and eight-track) and
records — experts have offered
a number of suggestions.
Although records offer the
best reproduction of sound,
commonly called "fidelity,"
they are also the quickest to
wear out. Because of the cons
tant wear on the record caused
by the turntable's needle, the
gradual deterioration of the disc

is unavoidable, but can be
slowed down.
Dust and lint are the enemies
of most stereo goods and re
cords are no exception. The
most commonly used method of
preventing a dust buildup on the
record is the use of a disc
washer. A cushioned fabric with
tiny velvet-like fingers, the disc
washer picks up the dust as one
applies it to the rotating record.
A few drops of discwashing solu

tion applied to the fabric
beforehand is suggested for
maximum effectiveness.
A similar cleaning method,
but different tool, is employed
in cleaning the stylus, more
commonly known as the needle.
Regularly applied, the small
stiff-fibered brush should keep
the stylus free of dirt and allow
for better sound
After a year and a half to two
years of regular use, the stylus

may become worn, resulting in
poor fidelity. If this is suspected
to be the problem, the cartridge
should be inspected by a stereo
service person for replacement
With regard to the main
tenance of the turntables them
selves, not much can be done
without a degree in electronics.
For belt-driven turntables, the
belt may become stretched out
over a period of time causing a
variance in speed of the music.
In this case, installation of a
new belt is necessary.
When discussing cassettes, it
is important to distinguish be
tween pre-recorded tapes, those
tapes produced by the record
company with music already re
corded. and blank tapes which
are thought by many to be supe
rior Good quality blank tapes
are known to have a better abili
ty to hit the music's high and
low notes than the pre-recorded
tape, from which a slight hiss
ing sound can be heard as a re-

suit of their mass production In
addition, blank tapes usually
last longer than those that are
pre-recorded. In order to com
bine the high fidelity of an
album with the durability of the

cassette, many stereo owners
record a new album onto a tape,
keeping the album clean and un
used while they use the tape.
In the upkeep of cassette and
eight track players, two clean
ing devices should be regularly
used — the head cleaner and the
demagnitizer.
When a tape is "eaten." a
term describing the folding and
creasing of the tape inside the

machine, it is usually because
dirt has built up on the ma
chine's heads which causes the
tape to stick to them. This can
be avoided by the use of a head
cleaner, a cassette that can be
placed in the machine for a few
seconds where it will remove
the dust buildup. While the head
cleaner may be more useful for
hard to get to parts such as in a
car's tape deck. Q-tips dipped in
head cleaning solution and ap
plied to the home deck's parts

are a more economical way to
remove dirt. Though alcohol is
used by many in place of head
cleaner, some experts warn that
the alcohol can deterioriate the
machine's rubber rollers.
While a tape is being run over
the machine's heads, a magnet
ic substance tends to accum
mulate on the heads. If the
buildup is allowed to continue,
high and low tones can be
blocked out and. at worst, parts

of the tape may become erased.
In order to guard against this,
cassette demagnitizers can be
inserted in the players to re
move the magnetic buildup It is
suggested that the de
maganitizer be used after every
20 to 30 hours of cassette play.
Because of magnetic buildup
that can take place even when
the power is not on, no tape
should be left in the machine af
ter it is played.

the listener dives for his
cassette deck to save his
cassette from a cruel fate. But
alas, it is too late. The deck has
already digested the ribbon into

does not realize that, because of
poor stereo maintenance, he is
the true criminal.

turntables themselves,

Although faulty stereo equip
ment and flawed tapes or re
cords are occasionally the cause
of damage to tapes and discs, it
is usually poor maintenance
that incurs the malfunction. Be
cause of the expense of stereo
equipment, tapes and records,
proper care for a music system
can save money in the long run,
as well as guarantee a better
sound.
Concerning the maintenance

of the two most widely used
forms of music — tapes
(cassette and eight-track) and
records — experts have offered
a number of suggestions.
Although records offer the
best reproduction of sound,
commonly called "fidelity,"
they are also the quickest to
wear out. Because of the cons
tant wear on the record caused
by the turntable's needle, the
gradual deterioration of the disc

is unavoidable, but can be
slowed down.
Dust and lint are the enemies
of most stereo goods and re
cords are no exception. The
most commonly used method of
preventing a dust buildup on the
record is the use of a disc
washer. A cushioned fabric with
tiny velvet-like fingers, the disc
washer picks up the dust as one
applies it to the rotating record.
A few drops of discwashing solu

tion applied to the fabric
beforehand is suggested for
maximum effectiveness.
A similar cleaning method,
but different tool, is employed
in cleaning the stylus, more
commonly known as the needle.
Regularly applied, the small
stiff-fibered brush should keep
the stylus free of dirt and allow
for better sound
After a year and a half to two
years of regular use, the stylus

may become worn, resulting in
poor fidelity. If this is suspected
to be the problem, the cartridge
should be inspected by a stereo
service person for replacement
With regard to the main
tenance of the turntables them
selves, not much can be done
without a degree in electronics.
For belt-driven turntables, the
belt may become stretched out
over a period of time causing a
variance in speed of the music.
In this case, installation of a
new belt is necessary.
When discussing cassettes, it
is important to distinguish be
tween pre-recorded tapes, those
tapes produced by the record
company with music already re
corded. and blank tapes which
are thought by many to be supe
rior Good quality blank tapes
are known to have a better abili
ty to hit the music's high and
low notes than the pre-recorded
tape, from which a slight hiss
ing sound can be heard as a re-

suit of their mass production In
addition, blank tapes usually
last longer than those that are
pre-recorded. In order to com
bine the high fidelity of an
album with the durability of the

cassette, many stereo owners
record a new album onto a tape,
keeping the album clean and un
used while they use the tape.
In the upkeep of cassette and
eight track players, two clean
ing devices should be regularly
used — the head cleaner and the
demagnitizer.
When a tape is "eaten." a
term describing the folding and
creasing of the tape inside the

machine, it is usually because
dirt has built up on the ma
chine's heads which causes the
tape to stick to them. This can
be avoided by the use of a head
cleaner, a cassette that can be
placed in the machine for a few
seconds where it will remove
the dust buildup. While the head
cleaner may be more useful for
hard to get to parts such as in a
car's tape deck. Q-tips dipped in
head cleaning solution and ap
plied to the home deck's parts

are a more economical way to
remove dirt. Though alcohol is
used by many in place of head
cleaner, some experts warn that
the alcohol can deterioriate the
machine's rubber rollers.
While a tape is being run over
the machine's heads, a magnet
ic substance tends to accum
mulate on the heads. If the
buildup is allowed to continue,
high and low tones can be
blocked out and. at worst, parts

of the tape may become erased.
