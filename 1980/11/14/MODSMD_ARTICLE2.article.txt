# Proper care can preserve expensive equipment

The sounds are all too famil
iar to the experienced music lis
tener. The high fidelity music
from the cassette drops to a low
hum, then to a quicker gargling
noise, and finally . . . silence.
Immediately recognizing the
sound of a tape being "eaten."
the listener dives for his
cassette deck to save his
cassette from a cruel fate. But
alas, it is too late. The deck has
already digested the ribbon into
its rollers and mangled it
beyond repair. Cursing his mali
cious tape player, the listener
does not realize that, because of
poor stereo maintenance, he is
the true criminal.

maintenance of the
turntables themselves,

Although faulty stereo equip
ment and flawed tapes or re
cords are occasionally the cause
of damage to tapes and discs, it
is usually poor maintenance
that incurs the malfunction. Be
cause of the expense of stereo
equipment, tapes and records,
proper care for a music system
can save money in the long run,
as well as guarantee a better
sound.
Concerning the maintenance

of the two most widely used
forms of music — tapes
(cassette and eight-track) and
records — experts have offered
a number of suggestions.
Although records offer the
best reproduction of sound,
commonly called "fidelity,"
they are also the quickest to
wear out. Because of the cons
tant wear on the record caused
by the turntable's needle, the
gradual deterioration of the disc

is unavoidable, but can be
slowed down.
Dust and lint are the enemies
of most stereo goods and re
cords are no exception. The
most commonly used method of
preventing a dust buildup on the
record is the use of a disc
washer. A cushioned fabric with
tiny velvet-like fingers, the disc
washer picks up the dust as one
applies it to the rotating record.
A few drops of discwashing solu

tion applied to the fabric
beforehand is suggested for
maximum effectiveness.
A similar cleaning method,
but different tool, is employed
in cleaning the stylus, more
commonly known as the needle.
Regularly applied, the small
stiff-fibered brush should keep
the stylus free of dirt and allow
for better sound
After a year and a half to two
years of regular use, the stylus

may become worn, resulting in
poor fidelity. If this is suspected
to be the problem, the cartridge
should be inspected by a stereo
service person for replacement
With regard to the main
tenance of the turntables them
selves, not much can be done
without a degree in electronics.
For belt-driven turntables, the
belt may become stretched out
over a period of time causing a
variance in speed of the music.
In this case, installation of a
new belt is necessary.
When discussing cassettes, it
is important to distinguish be
tween pre-recorded tapes, those
tapes produced by the record
company with music already re
corded. and blank tapes which
