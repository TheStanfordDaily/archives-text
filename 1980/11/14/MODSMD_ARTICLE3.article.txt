# New prospering tape players
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
I'm at the Stanford Football
Stadium and 1 have just passed
by a young girl with these min
iature earphones on her head
that aren t connected to any
thing 1 walk back and look at
her again The earphones are
connected, after all. to a small
box placed at her beltline This
box. about 4 in wide and 5 in
long, is actually a sample of the
new line of portable tapeplayers
which, with their small size and
their feather-weight earphones,
are indeed portable
The idea of the portable
cassette players was begun in
order to open the market for
people involved in recreational
sports or activities, such as
skiing or jogging The portables

can be kept in any small con
tainer. placed in a shirt-pocket
or even carried in the hand. Due
to their small size, and minimal
weight, they allow a person to
enjov their favorite songs while
doing almost any form of physi
cal activity.
The first few of these portable
tape player models were placed
on the market last fall The two
most popular models are the
Sony "Walkman"' and the Pan
asonic J3. The Walkman seems
to sell a little better than other
models. It uses a regular sized
tape but. strangely enough, it
doesn t have a built-in speaker.
It is made to be used only with
headphones. Another unique
aspect of this model is that it has
a "hot line" button which mutes

the sound in the earphones and,
at the same time, links a built-in
microphone to the earphones
themselves. Thus, when two
people have earphones linked to
the same Walkman, one of them
can press the hot-line button,
speak through the mike, and
send a message to his or her
companion.
The Walkman has a pretty
good price for its size. It costs
about $200 and this includes the
Walkman itself, and the feath
er-weight headphones. Other
accessories include a combina
tion of radio and stereo speakers
for about $220 and extra
earphones which sell for $50.

las the same style of head-
Ihones and the same tape func
lions as the Walkman. It is
Iriced at about $140 with
lihones. cheaper than its com
petitor. and. note this, it is con
sidered by some people to pro
duce a better sound. This, of
bourse, is simply a matter of
each person's ear for music.

Cybernet carries a model
which is slightly larger than the
Panasonic. It has a high-bias
button which allows for special
high-bias tapes that give a bet
ter quality of sound. The
Cybernet sells for around $200.
Sony has another model
besides the Walkman, called the
rCM-111, which doesn't have a
hot-line. However, it does have
a built-in speaker along withthe
earphones. Otherwise, the
rCM-111. costing $110. is simi
lar to the Walkman.
The Sony headphones come in
two models: the MDR-3, which
■ s included with the Walkman
and other models, and the
MDR-7. The latter is larger than
the ML)R-3 and has a normal 1
4-inch phone-jack which can be
adapted to the miniature RCA
•pin-jack), normallv used in
these portables. The MDR-7
sells for $80

"They are selling
fantastic, and Vm not
exaggerating. They
actually sell
themselves."

All of these prices have prac
tically no variation among
places close to campus, the
Stanford Shopping Center, or
1 stereo equipment stores in the
Palo Alto area.
As a customer. I inquired at
the shopping center as to how
the public was reacting to the
Walkman and its counterparts.
One salesperson told me that
"they are selling fantastic, and
I'm not exaggerating. They ac
tually sell themselves." Anoth
er salesperson said the portable
cassette players are expected to
sell very well this Christmas be
cause "they fit well as presents
and are indeed, very portable."

their feather-weight earphones,
are indeed portable
The idea of the portable
cassette players was begun in
order to open the market for
people involved in recreational
sports or activities, such as
skiing or jogging The portables

can be kept in any small con
tainer. placed in a shirt-pocket
or even carried in the hand. Due
to their small size, and minimal
weight, they allow a person to
enjov their favorite songs while
doing almost any form of physi
cal activity.
The first few of these portable
tape player models were placed
on the market last fall The two
most popular models are the
Sony "Walkman"' and the Pan
asonic J3. The Walkman seems
to sell a little better than other
models. It uses a regular sized
tape but. strangely enough, it
doesn t have a built-in speaker.
It is made to be used only with
headphones. Another unique
aspect of this model is that it has
a "hot line" button which mutes

the sound in the earphones and,
at the same time, links a built-in
microphone to the earphones
themselves. Thus, when two
people have earphones linked to
the same Walkman, one of them
can press the hot-line button,
speak through the mike, and
send a message to his or her
companion.
The Walkman has a pretty
good price for its size. It costs
about $200 and this includes the
Walkman itself, and the feath
er-weight headphones. Other
accessories include a combina
tion of radio and stereo speakers
for about $220 and extra
earphones which sell for $50.

Cybernet carries a model
which is slightly larger than the
Panasonic. It has a high-bias
button which allows for special
high-bias tapes that give a bet

Cybernet sells for around $200.
Sony has another model
besides the Walkman, called the
rCM-111, which doesn't have a
hot-line. However, it does have
a built-in speaker along withthe
earphones. Otherwise, the
rCM-111. costing $110. is simi
lar to the Walkman.
The Sony headphones come in
two models: the MDR-3, which
■ s included with the Walkman
and other models, and the
MDR-7. The latter is larger than
the ML)R-3 and has a normal 1
4-inch phone-jack which can be
adapted to the miniature RCA

these portables. The MDR-7
sells for $80

fantastic, and Vm not

All of these prices have prac

places close to campus, the
Stanford Shopping Center, or

Palo Alto area.
As a customer. I inquired at
the shopping center as to how
the public was reacting to the
Walkman and its counterparts.
One salesperson told me that
"they are selling fantastic, and
I'm not exaggerating. They ac
tually sell themselves." Anoth
er salesperson said the portable
cassette players are expected to
sell very well this Christmas be
cause "they fit well as presents
and are indeed, very portable."
