# New prospering tape players
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
I'm at the Stanford Football
Stadium and 1 have just passed
by a young girl with these min
iature earphones on her head
that aren t connected to any
thing 1 walk back and look at
her again The earphones are
connected, after all. to a small
box placed at her beltline This
box. about 4 in wide and 5 in
long, is actually a sample of the
new line of portable tapeplayers
which, with their small size and
their feather-weight earphones,
are indeed portable
The idea of the portable
cassette players was begun in
order to open the market for
people involved in recreational
sports or activities, such as
skiing or jogging The portables

can be kept in any small con
tainer. placed in a shirt-pocket
or even carried in the hand. Due
to their small size, and minimal
weight, they allow a person to
enjov their favorite songs while
doing almost any form of physi
cal activity.
The first few of these portable
tape player models were placed
on the market last fall The two
most popular models are the
Sony "Walkman"' and the Pan
asonic J3. The Walkman seems
to sell a little better than other
models. It uses a regular sized
tape but. strangely enough, it
doesn t have a built-in speaker.
It is made to be used only with
headphones. Another unique
aspect of this model is that it has
a "hot line" button which mutes

the sound in the earphones and,
at the same time, links a built-in
microphone to the earphones
themselves. Thus, when two
people have earphones linked to
the same Walkman, one of them
can press the hot-line button,
speak through the mike, and
send a message to his or her
companion.
The Walkman has a pretty
good price for its size. It costs
about $200 and this includes the
Walkman itself, and the feath
er-weight headphones. Other
accessories include a combina
tion of radio and stereo speakers
for about $220 and extra
earphones which sell for $50.
The Panasonic model J3 is
slightly different than the Walk-
