# 'Natural' album used to mask noise
## 
### Ben Lloyd 
While you listen to the sound
of your neighbor's stereo blast
ing megawatts of "music"
through walls that seem to
amplify rather than mute,
would you rather be at the
beach? Or in a park" 1 Or in a
snug cabin with a roaring fire to
dispel the chill of the wind
rushing past the window?
In the time that it takes to put
on a record, you can be far
away. No conventional music
with its plastic world of
rhythmic constraints can match
the soothing sounds of Nature. A
recording of Environmental
Sounds can give you just that re
lease from the pains of reality.
No drugs, just sounds.
Crickets, birds, dogs, wind,
rain and many other natural
sounds are yours, surrounding,
touching, convincing, and you
are there.
A chorus of birds sings its
mysteriously intricate composi
tion outside your door, and the
riot in the next room subsides to
suggest simply a distant, human
interruption into your pastoral
soliloquy.
Besides inducing this com
plex psychological reaction,
these recordings simply mask
extraneous noise with less no
ticeable (and possibly more
pleasant) sounds.
The most pure of these mask
ing sounds is termed "white
noise." It results from the si
multaneous production of
simple, "pure" tones (like those
produced by an organ with no
stops) at all audible frequency
levels (10-20,000 Hz). It sounds
like the static between stations
on your FM dial. Though cer
tainly not an extremely pleas
ant noise, it has been found to be

conducive to studying under
conditions which would nor
mally be considered inhibiting
due to excessive noise.
White noise and pink noise

want to do is study, they can be
helpful, however. Expensive
($5O) white and pink noise gen
erators can be purchased from
companies such as Edmund Sci
entific. These generators also
produce soothing noises re
sembling waves or wind to help
induce sleep.
It is more practical, and less
expensive to tune your radio be
tween stations, which produces
essentially the same effect. The
volume should be set so that the
masking noise is "Just a little
louder than the interfering one.
You will find that as you con
tinue studying, both noises will
seem to disappear. This is a
well-noted psychological effect
which has been applied in noisy
factories with great success. It
has been suggested, though not
demonstrated, that this prac
tice may even combat hearing
loss from industrial noise.
If you want to get away, not
just to a book, but to a well-re
moved auditory setting, any one
of the 13 Environmental Sounds
records, available in larger re
cord stores such as Tower. Dis
count or Wherehouse Records,
and at libraries with sizeable re
cord collections (Meyer, for in
stance). will more than serve
the purpose
All of these recordings are
taken from actual natural set
tings, and are very realistic.

Particularly interesting is the
"Be-in" of 1969. recorded in
Central Park in New York, a
collection of various "people"

speech, whistles and many
more You can almost see the
crowds of people; hippies, cops,
giggling high school students,
and Hari Krishnas singing as

they all push by. You can feel
the hot midsummer sun
scorching the back of your neck,
and the heat of the sidewalks
dissolving into the cool grass.
You even speak to the man giv
ing out flowers and saving.
Peace, man."
If your house just voted not to
turn the heat on. and you are

shivering in liberal, energy-sav
ing silence, the sound of a warm
fire inside your room actually
seems to send light flickering on
the walls as the warm glow
spreads throughout your body.
Other recordings of the same
genre include synthesized re
productions of such sounds as
heartbeats, bells, waves and

rain. These can provide an at
mosphere almost physical, and
an environment almost natural.
The record company suggests
several uses for these natural
and unnatural "environments."
ranging from setting a pleasant
surrounding for entertaining
guests, to creating an organic
rhythm for interpersonal rela
tionships between friends and
lovers.
Though the practical uses of
these sounds may not be quite so
well-defined, their value as es
cape valve can not be under
stated. tio to a library, and lis
ten to one. It may not change
your life, but it might add a little
color to your world.
