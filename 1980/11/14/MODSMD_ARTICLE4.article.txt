# 'Natural' album used to mask noise
## 
### Ben Lloyd 
While you listen to the sound
of your neighbor's stereo blast
ing megawatts of "music"
through walls that seem to
amplify rather than mute,
would you rather be at the
beach? Or in a park" 1 Or in a
snug cabin with a roaring fire to
dispel the chill of the wind
rushing past the window?
In the time that it takes to put
on a record, you can be far
away. No conventional music
with its plastic world of
rhythmic constraints can match
the soothing sounds of Nature. A
recording of Environmental
Sounds can give you just that re
lease from the pains of reality.
No drugs, just sounds.
Crickets, birds, dogs, wind,
rain and many other natural
sounds are yours, surrounding,
touching, convincing, and you
are there.
A chorus of birds sings its
mysteriously intricate composi
tion outside your door, and the
riot in the next room subsides to
suggest simply a distant, human
interruption into your pastoral
soliloquy.
Besides inducing this com
plex psychological reaction,
these recordings simply mask
extraneous noise with less no
ticeable (and possibly more
pleasant) sounds.
The most pure of these mask
ing sounds is termed "white
noise." It results from the si
multaneous production of
simple, "pure" tones (like those
produced by an organ with no
stops) at all audible frequency
levels (10-20,000 Hz). It sounds
like the static between stations
on your FM dial. Though cer
tainly not an extremely pleas
ant noise, it has been found to be

conducive to studying under
conditions which would nor
mally be considered inhibiting
due to excessive noise.

want to do is study, they can be
helpful, however. Expensive
($5O) white and pink noise gen
erators can be purchased from
companies such as Edmund Sci
entific. These generators also
produce soothing noises re
sembling waves or wind to help
induce sleep.
It is more practical, and less
expensive to tune your radio be
tween stations, which produces
essentially the same effect. The
volume should be set so that the
masking noise is "Just a little
louder than the interfering one.
You will find that as you con
tinue studying, both noises will
seem to disappear. This is a
well-noted psychological effect
which has been applied in noisy
factories with great success. It
has been suggested, though not
demonstrated, that this prac
tice may even combat hearing
loss from industrial noise.

just to a book, but to a well-re
