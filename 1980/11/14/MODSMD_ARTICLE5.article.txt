# Phonographs, records available in Meyer

First you hear the Rolling
Stones. Then the Beatles. No,
you're not necessarily at a party
at the Phi Delts — you could be
at the Meyer listening lab.
The listening room offers
albums, instructional tapes and
taped lectures. Most albums are
requested by faculty for classes.
Thus the selection has a classi
cal emphasis.
In addition to these selec
tions, the Meyer audio lab ser
vices libraries that do not have
listening facilities. There are 29
libraries on campus.
According to Roxanna Siefer.
head of circulation services,
"the materials that are
purchased for Meyer support
the academic program for un-

writing papers on folk
music and rock.'

dergraduates." A small number
of materials are purchased on
student request.
"The things that are
purchased for pleasure are usu
ally from the suggestion box or
for the balance of the collec
tion," said Siefer. She added
that the percent of albums
purchased for pleasure listening
is equivalent to the percent of
books purchased for leisure
reading.
"We do have students writing
papers on folk music and rock,"
she said.
Students may bring their own
materials to the listening room.
But they may only use the facil
ities if there is available equip
ment in the room. Priority goes
to users of the library's audio
visual equipment since those
materials do not circulate out of

the room.
"The primary function of the
room is to make AV materials
available to students," em
phasized Siefer.
Materials are purchased by
the librarians within five sub
ject backgrounds. Buying de
cisions are based on faculty in
put. student requests, and the li
brarians' personal criteria.
According to Siefer, the audio
room is used most heavily for
course reserves.
The total collection of phono
discs, cassettes, reel-to-reel
tapes and slides includes over
5000 titles. But the collection is
even larger because of some du
plications.
The audio room does not oper
ate under a separate budget
from the rest of the library. "It
is very integrated into the li
brary system," said Siefer.
Selections are listed in the li
brary-wide catalog system
along with the books.
The room has been open since
the building began operation 16
years ago. Much of the equip
ment has become out-dated. As
a result, said Siefer, "We've
been replacing equipment for
the past five years."
Solid State equipment is part
of the upgrading process. Tube
equipment was used previously.
"This year we're expecting to
get amplifiers under the
tables." added Siefer.
New equipment requests are
submitted along with requests
such as those for new carpeting
or furniture.
Both single and multiple lis
tening tables are available in
the room. As many as four peo
ple can listen to a single record

ing at a multiple listening sta
tion. According to senior Melan
ie Julian, she began using the
lab to listen to missed biology
labs. Then she started going to
the lab to hear show music, like
Pippin, while she studied.
Senior Hank Strub used the

lab for practice sessions in a
non-credit LAC course in in
creasing reading speed.
Tresidder formerly had two
listening rooms. But they were
closed over a year ago and con
verted to offices because of lack
of space. Tresidder maintains
onlv a reading room now

The listening lab, located on
the main floor, is open during
regular library hours.
The foreign language lab, also
on the main floor of Meyer, is
separate from the audio-visual
room and operates on its own
hours.

"We do have students writing

Students may bring their own
materials to the listening room.
But they may only use the facil

to users of the library's audio
visual equipment since those
materials do not circulate out of

the room.
"The primary function of the
room is to make AV materials
available to students," em

Materials are purchased by
the librarians within five sub

According to Siefer, the audio
room is used most heavily for
course reserves.
The total collection of phono
discs, cassettes, reel-to-reel
tapes and slides includes over
5000 titles. But the collection is
even larger because of some du
plications.
The audio room does not oper
ate under a separate budget
from the rest of the library. "It
is very integrated into the li
brary system," said Siefer.
Selections are listed in the li
brary-wide catalog system
along with the books.
The room has been open since
the building began operation 16
years ago. Much of the equip

a result, said Siefer, "We've
been replacing equipment for
the past five years."
Solid State equipment is part
of the upgrading process. Tube
equipment was used previously.
"This year we're expecting to
get amplifiers under the
tables." added Siefer.
New equipment requests are
submitted along with requests
such as those for new carpeting
or furniture.
