# Composers on computers

It's night.
The remote concrete struc
ture stands alone in the Stanford
foothills — a semi-circular
building whose brightly lit halls
are draped with abstract art. In
contrast, the dimly lit rooms
are barren. In one, there is noth
ing save three computer termi
nals and two huge speakers. A
few notes are scribbled on a
chalkboard, on one wall hangs a
poster of the earth — suspended
in outerspace.
Suddenly, sound swells from
the speakers; it's an eerie, dis
embodied sound, the sound of a
child crying.
"Mom-ma!"
It's a long, drawn-out cry —
the cry of a computer.
At the Center for Computer
Research in Music and Ac
coustics. scholars labor over the
study of fluctuations in air pres
sure that we call "sound," using
computers to create new and old
sounds
"I tell the computer what to
do, the computer tells the syn
thesizer, and the synthesizer
plays the sound." explained
graduate student and computer
composer. David Jaffe.
The center, under the direc
tion of music department Pro
fessor John Channing since the
mid-19605, houses researchers
from the music, engineering,
and speech and hearing depart
ments.
Computerized composition is
a major activity at the center. It
is- in essence the creation of syn
thetic sound Special computer

programs can be adjusted to im
itate sounds of reality. One com
position might sound like the
roar of a jet as it takes off. while
another closely resembles a
child calling, "Mom-ma" — ex
amples of the wide diversity of
computerized composition
A recent development in com
puterized music known as
digital recording allows com
puter composers to refine their
music to a greater degree.
"Digital recording lets us be
much more precise." said
Jaffe.
Digital recording is seen as an
advantage over its predecessor,
analog recording, because un
like analog, digital recording is
"discreet." Discreet refers to
the ability to take sound and
sample it in very small units of
time.
"It's similar to a film," ex
plained Jaffe "You don't ac
tually see a continuous move
ment — what you see is a series
of still pictures run together
very fast. Sound can be stored
like that." he said
Digital recording gains its
precision advantage because it
is stored as numbers. Jaffe
credits this use of mathematics
with creating further flexibili
ty.
"It's like the difference be
tween cutting cake with a sledge
hammer or using a razor blade.
We can use mathematics ex
plicitly to change or adjust
pitches without changing
length, ' said Jaffe.
The actual task of composing

a piece can be a long and in
volved process. First the com
poser must define an "instru
ment." An instrument in this
context generally refers to the
technique used for producing
sound. A list of notes is then fed
into the computer terminal and
allowed to interact with the spe
cific instrument's program
The interaction results in
mathematical numbers, which
are then ready to be decoded as
sound The digital recording is
then transferred back to analog
and synthetic sound is heard
through one or several of the
eight speakers at the center.
It is necessary to transfer
from digital to analog for the
same reasons that still pictures
are strung togemer in frames
for films Just as films are com
posed of continuous frames of
still pictues. sound is composed
of the continuous sample of the
sound wave form. Digital re
cording as explained by .Jaffe.
"Takes small samples of
sounds, while analog looks at
the continuous sound."
.Jaffe is part of a new era of
computer composers. The ter
minal is his keyboard The notes
in his head are transmitted to
computer programs and are
sent from the computer to the
synthesizer
Turning back to his terminal,
the bearded composer stressed
that the method creates "a new
way of listening." From all in
dications. the end result also
marks a new way of creating
sound


Graduate students programming music onto the computer in the artificial intelligence lab of the Computer
Science department. The Music department's Center for Research in Music and Acoustics has a similar pro
gram, but one in which the composers "create" their own instruments on the computers.

Computerized composition is
a major activity at the center. It
is- in essence the creation of syn
thetic sound Special computer

programs can be adjusted to im
itate sounds of reality. One com
position might sound like the
roar of a jet as it takes off. while
another closely resembles a
child calling, "Mom-ma" — ex
amples of the wide diversity of
computerized composition
A recent development in com
puterized music known as
digital recording allows com
puter composers to refine their
music to a greater degree.
"Digital recording lets us be
much more precise." said
Jaffe.
Digital recording is seen as an
advantage over its predecessor,
analog recording, because un
like analog, digital recording is
"discreet." Discreet refers to
the ability to take sound and
sample it in very small units of
time.
"It's similar to a film," ex
plained Jaffe "You don't ac
tually see a continuous move
ment — what you see is a series
of still pictures run together
very fast. Sound can be stored
like that." he said
Digital recording gains its
precision advantage because it
is stored as numbers. Jaffe
credits this use of mathematics
with creating further flexibili
ty.
"It's like the difference be
tween cutting cake with a sledge
hammer or using a razor blade.
We can use mathematics ex
plicitly to change or adjust
pitches without changing
length, ' said Jaffe.
The actual task of composing

a piece can be a long and in
volved process. First the com
poser must define an "instru
ment." An instrument in this
context generally refers to the
technique used for producing
sound. A list of notes is then fed
into the computer terminal and
allowed to interact with the spe
cific instrument's program
The interaction results in
mathematical numbers, which
are then ready to be decoded as
sound The digital recording is
then transferred back to analog
and synthetic sound is heard
through one or several of the
eight speakers at the center.
It is necessary to transfer
from digital to analog for the
same reasons that still pictures
are strung togemer in frames
for films Just as films are com
posed of continuous frames of
still pictues. sound is composed
of the continuous sample of the
sound wave form. Digital re
cording as explained by .Jaffe.
"Takes small samples of
sounds, while analog looks at
the continuous sound."
.Jaffe is part of a new era of
computer composers. The ter
minal is his keyboard The notes
in his head are transmitted to
computer programs and are
sent from the computer to the
synthesizer
Turning back to his terminal,
the bearded composer stressed
that the method creates "a new
way of listening." From all in
dications. the end result also
marks a new way of creating
sound
