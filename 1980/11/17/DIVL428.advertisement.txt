Planning to Move Out of
Your Residence
Next Quarter'?
Single students who are currently living in a University
residence and who plan not to return for winter quarter
should notify their local residence office of their plans. A
"termination of occupancy" form should be filed by every
resident who plans to (a) graduate, (b) go to an overseas
studies center, (c) stop out, or (d) get married.
Students who fail to notify their office by November 21 by
filing a termination of occupancy card will lose their $50
housing deposits.
Residents of Escondido Village who have monthly rental
agreements should plan to give thirty days notice to the
Escondido Village Office before moving out of residence.
