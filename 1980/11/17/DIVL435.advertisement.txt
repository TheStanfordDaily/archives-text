GOOD THINGS
COME IN SMALL
PACKAGES!
AND Advanced Micro Devices gives it a whole new meaning. Aside from the fact that,
(as one of the nation's fastest growing integrated circuits manufacturers), our products
are "small packages," we like to think our company is a "small package" too in that we
don't claim to be the biggest in floor space, or number of employees. HOWEVER, we
are the best when it comes to friendly people, personal growth, and rapid career advance
ment within our company. That's what we mean when we say fastest growing. You'll
find no impersonal, large corporation atmosphere here.
Advanced Micro Devices started out a little over a decade ago with only 8 of the best
people in the industry and a lot of dreams. Today, we are considered at the top in the
field of integrated circuits manufacturing; with 8,000 of the best people in the industry,
$225 Million in sales, and over 700 products.
We currently have openings fn the fields of:

people, nlaybe even looked around our facilities and gotten the details important to
your career, you'll want to join us.
