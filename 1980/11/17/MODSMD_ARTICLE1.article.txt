## 
### Theresa Simons 
The second annual "Issues of the
80s conference focused on the years
1981-H5 and included key speakers on
I nited States defense, energy and for
eign policy.
More than 400 persons attended the
Saturday conference in Kresge
Auditorium.
Six professors and one alumnus
spoke on topics including: the dollar in
world economy, health care costs, the
international refugee crisis, and a
forecast of U.S. energy demand.
On the international front, Ronald

McKinnon, a professor of economics
specializing in international finance
and economic problems of less de
veloped countries, attributed the re
cessions of the '70s to obsolete eco
nomic policies based on the miscon
ception of a closed U.S. economy.
"The stability of the Eisenhower
years acclimated our economists to an
insular economy and a policy of benign
neglect of world exchange rates," he
said Cooperation among the in
dustrialized countries is vital to the
control of the international money
base and to future economic stability,
according to McKinnon.
Freedom in short supply'
Victor Palmieri, ambassador-at
large for refugee affairs under Presi
dent Jimmy Carter, described the cur
rent international refugee problem as
persistent He said the international
community must assume responsi
bility for its refugees.
"Freedom is in short supply the
world over, and that supply is shrink
ing everyday," he said People will
continue to be drawn to the few re
maining countries of freedom and eco
nomic opportunity."
He explained the cause of the refu
gee exodus from Southeast and
Southwest Asia. Africa. Latin Ameri
ca.the Caribbean and Pakistan in
terms of push and pull migration.
Rapidly increasing populations in
these areas are not matched by a suffi
cient increase in employment op
portunies and people are forced to
leave their countries to seek jobs
elsewhere.
Communications technology —
which shows the world what life is like
in the in the United States — draws
many of these people to this country,
according to Palmieri.
The U.S. is now the leading source
for direct aid to troubled areas and is
the largest refugee resettlement site,
he said.
Palmieri said resettlement in the
U S. is no longer the organized, prear
ranged process it once was. In the
past, housing, jobs and education were
arranged before refugees arrived, but
now. we are seeing them come
ashore in a disorderly way. . . this has
changed the tone of our public's think
ing." Palmieri said.
He noted that the refugees, as well
as illegal aliens and immigrants,
create economic activity in this coun

try and are desired by employers be
cause they will work for substandard
wages in substandard conditions. But
because of housing pressures and a
tight job market, there is a need for
control. Palmieri said
I think we have to have limits, con
trols. It will not do to be impotent." he
said "At the same time, our policy
will have to be humane and I hope it
will err on the side of generosity."
falmieri observed that refugee con
trols entail financial and civil liberty
costs. Kffective policing of U.S.
borders would cost billions of dollars,
he said, and national identification
cards would raise serious problems
for civil liberty. The Keagan adminis
tration will have tremendous difficul
ty reducing immigration levels, how
ever. with so many people fleeing op
pression. he said.
Alan Piatt, professor of political
science and visiting fellow at the Hoo
ver Institution, said he expected the
tone and direction" of the Keagan
administration's foreign policy to be
"a bolder, more forceful kind of for
eign policy. He said this approach
was favored by the American people
and the Congress, but said it was un
clear how the rest of the world would
respond.
Piatt predicted that Keagan would
spend more on defense than Carter did
-as much as $150 billion in the next
live years—and said it was question
able it the SALT II treaty could be
salvaged.
No deal
It. is hard to believe the Keagan
team will be able to go back to the So
viet Union and extract unilateral con
cessions." Piatt commented.
Not only would the treaty put a cap
on arms buildup if adopted, but it
could also pave the way to a SALT 111
treaty which would further advance
arms control, according to Piatt. He
added that it would take several years
to devise a new treaty if SALT II was
scrapped.
Piatt predicted that Keagan could
have problems with U.S. allies and the
Third World. "If we exert heavy
handed pressure, we run the risk of ex
acerbating anti-Americanism," he
said Piatt said he expects the Keagan
administration to pay less attention to
human rights in Third World ally coun
tries than the Carter administration,
and to emphasize foreign investment.
