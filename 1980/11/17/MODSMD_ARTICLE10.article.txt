# Zim babwe faces close election

### Los Angeles Times 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Local elections to be
held soon throughout Zimbabwe have increased
rivalry between the country's two principal tribal
groups and may precipitate more clashes like the
one in Bulawayo this week which resulted in 51
deaths.
This is the assessment of knowledgeable ob
servers here. They believe the dominant party,
headed by Prime Minister Robert Mugabe, is de
termined to extend the party's control in the coun
tryside by winning decisively in elections for 14
city councils and 55 rural district councils.
The aim is to crush the main opposition party,
headed by Home Affairs Minister Joshua Nkomo,
who like Mugabe was a guerrilla leader during the
seven-year insurgency that ended white rule in
Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) last January.
Now the men are political rivals.
The tribal split is equally bitter. Mugabe has
the support of the majority Shona tribal group,
while Nkomo has his following among the smaller
Ndebele tribal group.
These will be the first all-race elections since
the country came under full black rule in April

and will end the last vestige of white political
domination in the cities. City councils have been
composed of whites, and blacks had their repre
sentation only in suburban townships. The black
population of Zimbabwe is 7 million; whites
number only a little over 200,000.
"We are seeking to extend our political control
(of local government)," acknowledged Eddison
Zvobgo. a prominent member of Mugabe's party,
Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front. Zvobgo is also the Cabinet minister for lo
cal government and housing, and therefore is in
charge of conducting the elections.
The Mugabe party is so confident of its popu
larity that it will contest fully the elections in
western Zimbabwe, where Bulawayo is situated.
The pro-Nkomo Ndebele tribes are dominant in
the region, but there is also a sizable Shona popu
lation in some areas.
In Bulawayo's city council race, most of the 23
seats, aside from a few that whites will win in
white suburbs, are being bitterly contested by
both Shona and Ndebele candidates. Nkomo's
Ndebele candidates are favored.
"If Nkomo can't win in Bulawayo, he and his
party are doomed," Zvobgo declared.
