and hatters. "

Oil is. in a sense, the life
blood of your car It cools,
cleans and lubricates the en
gine. Dirt in the oil interferes
with all these processes
An oil and filter change and
lube job costs about $20 at a ser
vice station, and there are very
few ways you can tell if the work
has been correctly done.
Since the job is simple to do
yet very important, it makes
sense to learn to do it yourself.
You'll have the satisfaction of
knowing the job has been done
properly and you'll save money,
too.
These tasks should be per
formed as often as your owner's
manual suggests, but the oil and
filter should be changed at least
every 6000 miles or six months
and the chassis should be lubri
cated at least every 12,000 miles
of 12 months.
These are the tools you will

need for the job and their ap
proximate costs:
Hand held grease gun $3 50
Adjustable wrench $1 50
Oil filter wrench $1-2
Oil spout $1
Funnel & 6 qt plastic pan $2
Total tool cost: $9-10
To save money, shop at a dis
count auto store instead of a de
partment store. The oil filter
wrench and grease gun should
be name brands; buy the other
items as inexpensively as pos
sible because generic and store
brands will be just as good
Each time you will have to
buy a new oil filter and five
quarters of oil i this amount var
ies on some cars — check your
owner's manual), but the tools
can be used over and over, so the
$10 will be recovered the first
time you change the oil
A brand-name oil filter can be
purchased on sale for $2. and
brand-name oil costs $1 a can
separately, less by the case. The
type of oil you need depends on
your car and the climate, check
the owner's manual. The auto
store can tell you what size

filter fits your car
First, you must locate the fol
lowing items If you can t find
them, ask a gas station atten
dant or a friend to show them to
you
1) Oil pan plug — a bolt lo
cated on the oil pan. directly un
der the engine
2)011 filter — usually on
driver's side, accessible from
either under the hood or from
under the car
31 Dipstick and oil filler cap
— located near the top of the en
gine and accessible from under
the hood.
The procedure for changing
the oil is as follows:
11 Run the engine for about
five minutes so the oil will
warm up and flow freely.
2) Position the pan under the
oil-pan plug
3) Loosen the plug, first with
the adjustable wrench, and then
with your hand
4) When oil starts to drip
from the hole, finish loosening
the plug and quickly pull the
plug away to avoid having hot oil
run down your arm.

51 Let the oil drip into the pan
for at least 15 minutes, while
you change the filter
Some oil pan plugs have a
gasket (washer* to ensure a
tight seal If your car has one.
take care not to lose it
The oil filter should be
changed every time you change
your oil. Some people recom
mend changing the filter every
other time but if you change the
oil without changing the filter,
you leave a quarter of dirty oil
stored there. Considering the
cost of an oil filter compared to
the cost of major engine repair,
it is not a bad idea to change the
filter every time
To change the filter
1 > Loosen filter with filter
wrench and turn it upside down
as soon as it is completely un
screwed. so that oil stored in the
filter does not pour out.
21 Using your finger, coat the
gasket (rubber washeri on the
new filter with a dropof oil This
insures a tight seal
3) Hand tighten don't use
the wrench or else you won't be
able to get the filter off next

tune until you feel a slight re
sistance This is the gasket mak
ing contact with the engine
Make a reference mark on the
tilter. and tighten it according
to the instructions on the pack
age It varies from brand to
brand Some require an addition
3 4 turn, some a 1 2 turn Do not
overtighten' In this case, more
is not better
By now. the oil should have
dripped into the pan. and there
should be no more oil. or just a
few drops, flowing from the
hole. It the plug has a gasket,
coat it with oil and replace it
when you replace the plug Be
sure to screw the plug in
straight, or else you may strip
the threads. Tighten the plug un
til it is snug, but do not over
tighten. or you will damage the
pan
Add four quarters of oil down
the oil-filler opening, close the
cap. and run the engine. The
"oil" light will stay lit for a few
seconds, and should go off as son
as normal oil pressure is
reached.
Check for oil leaks at the
tilter and plug Turn the engine

oft immediately it you see a
leak Tighten the offending item
and test tor leaks again
Cheek the dipstick The car
should he one quart low on oil If
it is not. this means you didn't
allow all of theoldoil todnpout
This is not a disaster, but keep it
in mind for next time
Add oil slowly, running the
engine in between, until the
dipstick is between "safe and
full It you don't know how to
check the dipstick, a service
station attendant can show you
how
You are done with the oil and
I liter change now Throw away
the filter The used oil should be
placed in a gallon jug and taken
to the \SSI' Recycling Center
The lubrication of the front
chassis is simple alter you have
found the proper lubrication
points You can look this up in an
auto manual in a library it you
don't know someone who has
done some maintenance, and
will show you
Some cars must be jacked up
in front to reach the lubrication
points. Do this, but never go un
derneath a car held up by just a

jack Kither use a jack stand or
set the car on blocks Also,
make sure the parking brake is
set and put blocks behind the
rear wheels so they don't roll
back while you're working
It you have a lot of trouble lo
cating them, take your car to a
service station and pay the $5 or
so the station will charge for h
lube job Insist on watching
where the mechanic injects
grease You will know exactly
where to lubricate the car in the
future
Once you've located the'
grease points, known as grease;
tittings. attach the nozzle of the
grease gun to a point, pump the
gun until the rubber behind the
titting begins to expand. You
have now displaced the old
grease with new grease Repeat.'
at each titling
The money you save after the.
tirst oil change, when you pavl
for the tools, is about $7 to $15-
each time, tor about an hours
work Rut more than saving
money, you'll have the satisfac
i ion ot knowing your car is being
properly maintained.
