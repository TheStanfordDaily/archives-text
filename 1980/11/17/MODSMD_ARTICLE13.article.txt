"There is a piece of me that would love
to be a stand-up comedian. - ' said author
Jessamyn West, speaking Wednesday as
part of CHOW's "Dialogues with West
Coast Women Writers" series. And she
proved herself to be quite an entertainer.
Her sense of humor kept the audience
laughing along with her as she related
some personal anecdotes about her life
and work.
Jennifer Chapman, an undergraduate
here and an intern at CROW, acted as
West's interviewer and did her best to
get some straight answers from her wit
ty subject.
West spoke about some of the impor
tant influences on her writing. Tillie
Olsen and Janet Lewis, two other CROW
series speakers, and her own bout with
tuberculosis, which had a profound im
pact on her life.
"I won't say God bless TB." West said,
"but I might not have written if not for
that experience. I thought at that time
that my life was over, and instead it was
the beginning of my life."

West also spoke about the importance
of her mother during the period of her ill
ness: She would lie to me about my tem
perature. telling me I was getting better
... I was afraid to die with her
around.. .
Her mother was a source of inspiration
for West's writing as well. "She would
have made a far better writer than I."
she said, describing her mother's
storytelling about leaving the East to
settle in California.
West explained that although she had
always wanted to write, she thought this
was a "vain and pretentious . . . almost
sacreligious" goal, and didn't tell anyone
about this desire when she was young.
Her most recent book, Double Dis
covery, is about a trip she made to Eng
land in 1929. before she told anyone she
wanted to write. West said she was then
keeping a journal and writing letters
home to her mother; after her mother's
death. West found out that her mother
had saved all of her letters.
So. 50 years later, West wrote about
herself, the "older woman, discovering

the young woman who was discovering
travel. Europe. Oxford ... a double dis
covery."
She talked about the significance of
being a writer in the West; despite her
romantic ties to the East reflecting her
mother's homesickness. West said she
"could not tolerate a land where earth
and skv had no chance to meet â€” why
didn't someone cut down some of the
trees?" she teased.
She characterized the West as a place
where "earth and sky touch," and said.
"I want space; I want light. I like the sea.
the desert, the openness and mountains
on the horizon."
Although West has written more than
18 books, a number of which have been
translated into other languages, she first
published at the age of 43. Reflecting on
her Quaker background. West discussed
the unusual amount of freedom Quaker
women had: "They could preach from
the beginning, they went to jails to read
to the men . . they went on missionary
tours with men other than their husbands
.1 should have had the nerve and the
backbone to start writing! "
