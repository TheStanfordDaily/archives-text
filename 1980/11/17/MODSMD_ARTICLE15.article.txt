# Class members compete in tournaments
## Debate team places fourth 
### Jeff Sims 
Four Stanford students competed in a three-day
debate tournament held through Nov. 2 at UC-
Berkeley. Freshmen entrants Cynthia Ellis and
Kip Kolkmeier advanced to the quarterfinals and
placed fourth out of 25 teams representing Ne
vada. Utah and California schools.
The topic "Should the United States increase
foreign military commitments '" was designated
this year's "national debate topic" to be used in
all collegiate debates.
"It's a really good topic and especially relevant
right now." said Ellis, who had participated in her
first college debate after a year of high school de
bating. She said most of her time preparing for the
debate was spent writing a "case" — a positive
and a negative argument on the topic.
Logic important
The tournaments are judged on objective rules
and criterion, said debate coach Mariann
Bverwalter. a junior here. In college "judges con
sider public speaking and logical arguments more
important than in high school, where theory and
debating rules often take precedent." she said.
"We basically try to think of logical correlates
instead of a lot of facts." said Bverwalter "In
some respects we have an advantage over teams
that tend to concentrate on too many details in
stead of on logical arguments."
Class offered
Bverwalter. who won a national tournament
held in Illinois last year, is currently teaching an
Undergraduate Special debate class that will con
tinue next quarter The class numbers 25 students
and is offered for two units.
"The class isessentially our debate team." said
Bverwalter. explaining that class members are
encouraged to enter tournaments. Responsi
bilities are divided among the class members, she

said. Each person works on researching the de
bate topic, and then everything is compiled."
Despite the success at UC-Berkeley, the debate
program here is really struggling, said
Bverwalter
Lack of funding
Bverwalter identified funding as the program's
main problem. "Many junior colleges have more
equipment and backing than we do." she said.
Berkeley has three paid, full-time debate
coaches. Because of this, schools like Berkeley
and USC tend to be the debate powerhouses."
The team relies for funding on the proceeds of a
workshop it sponsors each year for high school de
baters. which last summer earned a profit of
about $1000, according to Bverwalter. This year
the team is also applying for funding from the
ASSU Senate's discretionary fund and from the
Office of Student Activities. If the funds are not
granted, said Bverwalter. the team will be lim
ited to intramural debates.
Lack of recognition of the debate program is
also a major problem, said Bverwalter. "The fact
that there is a debate program here seems to be
a well-kept secret.'
The next debate tournament Stanford's team
plans to enter will be held at the University of San
Francisco next quarter. "There are other debate
tournaments every weekend but they will have to
be skipped due to our financial situation." said
Bverwalter.
Intramural debates
Starting next quarter, the debate team plans to
sponsor a program of intramural debates.
"Hopefully the intramural debates and more fun
ding will help our program." said Bverwalter.
Debating can be valuable in life," she said.
"Debating can help with public speaking, good
presentation, poise and organization."

plans to enter will be held at the University of San
Francisco next quarter. "There are other debate
tournaments every weekend but they will have to
be skipped due to our financial situation." said
Bverwalter.
Intramural debates
Starting next quarter, the debate team plans to
sponsor a program of intramural debates.
"Hopefully the intramural debates and more fun
ding will help our program." said Bverwalter.
Debating can be valuable in life," she said.
"Debating can help with public speaking, good
presentation, poise and organization."
