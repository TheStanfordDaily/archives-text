# Warships guard oil route
## 
### Washington Post 
New Delhi — The United States would act on its
own to keep open the vital oil route through the
Straits of Hormuz even if other nations refused to
help, a high American military official said here
Saturday.
The official said America would ask other na
tions — including some along the Indian Ocean
such as India who have opposed a U.S. naval pres
ence in this area — to help remove any blockade to
the straits, through which 40 percent of the non
communist world's oil flows.
"If the U.S. is unable to get the cooperation. I
would expect we will act unilaterally," added the
military official, who under ground rules of a
briefing held at the American ambassador's of
ficial residence here, could not be further identi
fied.
He said the forces now in the Indian Ocean and
the Arabian Sea are adequate to do the job at the
present time.
Commander tours region
The commander of all U.S. military forces in
the Pacific and Indian oceans, Adm. Robert Long,
yesterday concluded a four-dav visit to India
which is part of a tour of the region that he said is
aimed at getting views of top officials and ex
plaining the U.S. policies to them. Long has al
ready visited Bangladesh and Pakistan and will
leave here today for Sri Lanka.
The official's comments take on added signifi
cance here, where the government of Prime Min
ister Indira (iandhi never has condemned the So
viet invasion almost 11 months ago of Afghanistan
and has implied its belief that Moscow was forced
to move because of a buildup of American forces
in the area.
The Afghan military official characterized

Long's talks with Indian Defense and Foreign
Ministry officials — the admiral did not see
Gandhi as a cordial exchange of views.
He said that keeping open the straits, a 26-mile
wide waterway thai leads from the Persian Gulf
to the Arabian Sea. "is clearly in India's own in
terest. and said the United States would be in
terested in having help from India. But he made it
clear there was little chance of that.
Other nations, however, have moved ships into
the Indian Ocean Arabian Sea — Persian Gulf
region as a result of the eight-week-old gulf war
between the two OPEC nations of Iraq and Iran
that has threatened to spill over into the straits,
closing that waterway.
60 warships nearby
At least 60 warships, slightly more than half of
them American, are now in the area, some sent
specially by Britain, France and Australia
France, reacting specifically to a possible threat
to close the straits, has sent minesweepers to the
region
The allied force is not under a unified com
mand. although there have been reports in Wash
ington that its formation was part of a coordi
nated effort. In all. the force of 60 Western ships Is
about twice as many as the Soviet fleet of 29 ships
reported in the region
U.S. ships moved in
To build up its fleet in the Indian Ocean after
Iran seized the U.S. hostages a year ago and the
Soviets invaded Afghanistan last Dec. 27. Ameri
ca has moved in ships from other parts of the
world. Moreover, a lack of port facilities in this
region means that American ships have been at
sea longer than they should be. the official said.
(>ne ship, the aircraft carrier Eisenhower, was at
sea for six months without a port call.
