## Chatter about the chance of snow 
### 
This is for all the other home
sick Easterners, a look back at
what you. a senior at the local
high school, would be doing at
this time last year:
The nearly naked oaks des
perately cling to their last few
shreads of leaves. The
monotonous, milkv-gray sky is
disturbed bv only occasional Vs
of birds, pointing the way to
warmth The grass, once soft,
thick, green, is now dead straw.
Shrieking, the sound of the
alarm snaps your eyes open.
The thick pile of blankets you so
carefully laid over your bed and
were so happy to snuggle into
last night, are now a tangled
wad. a wool Boa winding around

your shaking body. Eventually,
you stagger out the door.
Stomping your feet to keep
the blood moving, the school bus
is. as usual, late. You breathe
heavy just to see the cloud of
frost billow from your mouth,
the only diversion from the
cruel cold At school, you and
your friends chatter about the
cold, the gray skies and the
chance of snow.
Most claim that November is
too early, but the sparkle in
their eyes betrays their words
and reveals their hope By noon
the predicted flurries, no more
than little white dots, waft down
to earth. No one really expects

the snow to live once it lands,
but everyone, including you col
lege-bound seniors gaze out the
window.
By the time school is over, the
flurries have turned to flakes,
all thick and wet. An inch now
quilts the ground, not enough to
shovel, not even enough to cover
the grass, but enough to take
away the traction from your
sneakers, and enough to put
smiles on the faces of even the
most cynical.
When the bus comes, you pelt
it with scraped up snowballs, all
the while praising the snow for
its wet. fluffiness, its "pack
ability." Everyone, it seems, is
an expert in snowball construc
tion techniques.
Someone has smuggled
pocketsfull of snow onto the
school bus and a war breaks out
between the front half of the bus
and the back. Everyone, from
the little freshmen to the big.
bad seniors, leap about the bus.
madly scurrying for those little
white chunks of ammo. The
driver, a young guy with dark
sunglasses, is cool and does not
really mind: besides, no one
takes his threats of stopping the
"bus seriously.
At home, you and your friends
resume the skirmish, covering
each other with blankets of the
wet flakes, scooping out am
munition from the now two in

ches of snow cover, leaving bare
patches of brown earth. But
when someone mentions hot
chocolate, there is immediate
talk of a truce.
Out of breath and giddv. eve
ryone marches into your house
to mooch your hot chocolate
and brag about their successful
shots: the one you chucked
from way down the street and
would've pegged Ben with, if he
hadn't moved; the one Danny
whipped at you and would've
creamed your face, if you hadn't
ducked.
Everybody wants to light a
fire, only the fireplace is filled
with the planters you brought in
for your mom two weeks ago.
Danny lights some crumpled up
newspapers in an ashtray while
you are in the kitchen making
cocoa. Luckily nothing burns
except the cocoa which every
one drinks anyway, just for
nostalgia's sake.
You've been having these
same snowball fights with each
other since the sixth grade, and
none of you care if others deem
it childish or immature because
it's 112 un. It's relatively
harmless, and it takes your
mind off that one. all important
question. "Even though I'm not
the class president, can 1 still
get into Stanford '"
