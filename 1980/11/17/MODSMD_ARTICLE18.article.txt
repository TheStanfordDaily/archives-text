# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS

In inv earlier articles 1 stressed that more par
ticipation in decision-making is an important step
toward resolving the structural problems that
we face at the University and throughout society
Less clear, but equally important, is the rela
tionship between those structural barriers to
meaningful activity and the psychological, even
spiritual. anf>st that such an inaccessible or
ganization imposes. 1 submit today that the demo
cratization. the socialization, the retooling of our
institutions will manifest itself in more, not less,
individual responsibility: and that the results of
such a process will not only improve the physical
well-being of its members, but also strengthen the
social and spiritual health of all concerned.

Students at Stanford exist under what amounts
to a pseudo-collective bargaining agreement with
the University. This is to say nothing more than
that students have some representative body,
namely, the ASSU. which is supposed to act on
their behalf. This says nothing about the effective
ness of such an agent.
There is. in fact, a critical element missing in
the ability of the ASSU to effectively serve its
membership: strength that comes from accoun
tability — not the accountability of the ASSU lead
ership — but of the decision to those who are af
fected bv it. That is. between the ASSU and the ac
tual decision.
The result of no accountability? Examples are
students on committees making anti-student de
cisions dike the Lomita Drive extension), the
University sidestepping the ASSU by choosing
their own representative students" in important
advisory capacities, the University making other
decisions with no input at all from students.
Beyond these examples lie the more fundamen
tal questions: what is the strength in numbers of
students land workers) on University commit
tees? Is there some system of balance that can be
developed to ensure real voice for students? How
would it operate? How would it be ensured, in
sured. safeguarded'.' Could students cope with the
tremendous responsibility that comes with help
ing to govern Stanford University in a real way?
Most importantly, will this change lead to im
proved results? Will our decisions be better than
the ones presently made? Just how do we go about
democratizing our school?

Let's compare the contract procedures be
tween a i the University and its workers, repre
sented by their union, and bi the University and
its students, represented by the ASSU. Both the
students and the union choose their negotiating
teams democratically: either through direct elec
tion or by having the elected leadership choose ne
gotiators.
The union gets equal representation with man
agement in negotiating sessions. Students have
weak minority membership on many important
committees, none on others. Students have a ma
jority on one advisory committee. Student Ser
vices, but that is not a decision-making body in
that its recommendations are not binding to the
dean of student affairs.
Occasionally task forces initiated by students

and with a majority of students have led to some
real changes teaching evaluations, the Coffee
House takeover. These changes were initiated
outside the permanent structure, however; and.
their high success rate indicates that student ma
jorities are not anathemic to effectiveness or effi
ciency. as some people feel The committee com -
position must be changed to more fully accom
modate students.
Union membership ratifies the contract in or
der for it to go into effect. Students don't. The
committee structure must be changed so that
committee decisions are tracked through the stu
dent senate for acceptance as well as through the
Faculty Senate The essence of a contract is its ac
ceptance by all sides involved
Unions have outside remedies to use if the Uni
versity stalls negotiations, delays decisions,
sidesteps the selection procedures, etc. They can
file unfair labor practice charges and they can
sue. The ASSU Legal Counseling Service is barred
from initiating action against the University.
Kither this restraint must be lifted or the ASSU
must develop some legal or paralegal staff to pre
serve some continuity of research on University
affairs I Wait a minute. Wepay for the LCO, and it
can't even represent us?) and not hesitate to
challenge the University if the issue warrants it.
The union contract is in writing, and is a docu
ment that is readily obtainable. The student "con
tract'' is a series of vague agreements, some
coded, others not. and in some state of disarray, if
not existence.
The union contract has an explicit grievance
procedure to interpret the contract. Theistudents'
doesn't. »
If all else fails, the union goes out on strike.
They withhold their labor. Students can also
strike, in a way. They can withhold their tuition.

Ooops. I've let it out.
Students can reject the "take it or leave it" at
titude that presently surrounds University de
cisions (You applied here, right? You can just
pack up and leave). This message is effective in
diffusing dissension when directed at the individ
ual. but if thousands of students answered that
challenge with a mass tuition deferment, we
might see a few changes made.
Scenario: Students call for
— full and legal recognition by the University
of the ASSU as exclusive bargaining agent;
— parity in all University committees;
— ASSU ratification of all policy changes and
late hikes; and
— a legal staff to consider external remedies
where established procedure failed;
and backed these proposals with a possible $50
million deficit? We don't even have to strike; just
appear organized enougli to get them to believe
that we would.
The effects stagger the imagination and may in
fluence the course of American education for
many years. We can begin to utilize our potential
as leaders of the future -by recognizing our
strength and using it for justice.
