A charged idea
1 notice from your columns
that the mascot issue has come
right alive. 1 would much rather
not add something more to the
slew if 1 didn't have a strong
case in point. And yes. you
guessed it — the "Stanford elec
trons."
Whatever on earth has Stan
ford got to do with electrons?
Actually a lot. Stanford owes
much of its post-war reputation
to its innovations and achieve
ments in electronics education
and research. Besides, this area
is one of the leading centers of
the electronics industry.
Before the wail of protests
that this is too parochial a sym
bol start welling up, let us pause
and take a look at electrons

themselves.
Electrons are charged,
dynamic, light and swift — all
attributes befitting a high pow
ered offense like that of Stan
ford's. In this same vein not
much could be said of the de
fensive powers of either party.
Wouldn't it be nice to read
"Stanford electrons bombard
and split USC nucleus'' (though
it is a lot of wishful thinking > ?
Besides, why drag in the
archaic griffin (or is it griffon'.')
or the unimaginative tree'.' We
have to be in tune with the
times.
Still, how does one identify
oneself with something as in
tangible as an electron? Let us
face it; what are more universal
than electrons? As for those who

ask how to represent the mascot
symbol. 1 would shoot them with
an electron gun
All right then, let's get the
"electrons" excited. Physics
tells us the result should be noth
ing less than a quantum jump of
state.

In response to Scnell, et al.
(Daily, Nov. 12), I agree that
USC has "the most obnoxious
marching troop in the country."
1 don't agree, however, that that
justifies flinging water balloons
at them.
I d like to remind them that it
hurts to get nailed by a water
balloon And that's just when
the 12-vear-old down the street
throws one at you. Using a "sl
ingshot" from 20 rows up in
creases the force of those things
several times. Not to mention
the fact that if one hits some
one's instrument that person
could go home with a broken
tooth (or a broken instrument —
expensive).
That surgical tubing doesn't
make for particularly good aim,
either; a short fling could hit
one of our Band members (who
doesn't have one of those
helmets to protect his head).
My last comment has to do
with the claim by Schnell, et al.
that the balloon flingers "were
denied their right of freedom of
speech." Where does the First
Amendment say it's OK to in
jure someone?

No coal protest?
Over the weekend five men
died in a methane gas explosion
in a West Virginia coal mine.
Across the country, during the
last six weeks. 26 people have
died in coal mining accidents. A
couple of years ago 50 people
died in a Japanese coal mine. I
would like to ask why are there
no protests? Why isn't anybody
chanting "nocoalies"? Why are
the newspaper stories' which
covered these tragedies put on
page 197

If the deaths had been radi
ation-related editors would
have made it the biggest story of
the year. The president would
have taken some emergency ac
tion; "no-nuke" protests would
have swept the country.
I ask those against nuclear
power: why do you spend so
much energy trying to shut
down atomic power plants be
cause of their potential danger
when people are already dying
in coal mines? What's the mat
ter? Isn't coal eerie enough for
you?
Do you like radiation's popu
larity in science fiction'.' Do you
want to get on the protesting
bandwagon with the beautiful
Jane Fonda'.' Or are you just
content to let a few hundred peo
ple die every year for our
energy?
Anti-nukes and news editors,
you are not seeing things prop
erly when you protest the dan
gers of nuclear energy, but qui
etly dismiss five men dying in a
coal mine.

Word of caution
I read with great interest a
letter to the editor (Daily, Nov.
13) from the members of Roses
Against a Nuclear Environ
ment. Their cause is noble and I
admire their idealism. But I
must disagree with their sug
gestion that Stanford ban com
panies involved with weapons
production from recruiting at
CFFC.
My objections to their sugges
tion involves a question of free
dom of speech. Allowing some
companies to recruit while not
allowing defense firms abridges
the rights of students wanting to
interview with those firms.
Also, how would we decide on
whether a company is involved
in weapons production? What
criteria should we use: of
fensive systems, defensive,
strategic, tactical, nuclear,
conventional or all of the above?
What about companies like
Boeing? Boeing builds com
mercial jets but also builds
AWACS and will produce the
Air-Launched Cruise Missile.

Should we only let Boeing
divisions involved with civilian
systems recruit? Or should we
base our decision upon per
centage of profits from defense
related products?
If we deny campus facilities
to this one group, we can deny
campus facilities to others:
RCYB. gays, or any other "un
desirable" group; undesirable
in the opinion of some of the
Stanford community.
I would caution the members
of Roses Against a Nuclear En
vironment against imposing
their "morality" upon others.
It's Orwellian and I would reject
it. as I also reject 1) the Moral
Majority telling my children
when to pray, 2) the Catholic
Church telling my wife when she
can bear children, and 3) Jimmy
Carter telling me to register for
the draft!
These are all groups intent on
abridging my freedoms. Don't
let the Roses tell you who you
can and cannot talk to.

Marching band
As a member of the
L.5.J.11.M B. I am amazed at
the warlike mentlity with which
certain Stanford heroes
catapult water balloons at visit
ing bands! Who can blame other
schools for catapulting an on
slaught of roke bottles, ice, and
oranges ut the most obnoxious
marching troop in the world
when we visit other schools?
The L.S.J.LJ.M.B. strongly dis
courages abusing other bands
and thanks the lacrosse team
not only for their defense of us,
but also for their defense of
Berkeley's visiting band at last
year's Big Game!
Five seconds of warlike glory
and sadistic pleasure does not
justify the day's discomfort and
the possible injury to the one
being hit.

No coal protest?
Over the weekend five men
died in a methane gas explosion
in a West Virginia coal mine.
Across the country, during the
last six weeks. 26 people have
died in coal mining accidents. A
couple of years ago 50 people
died in a Japanese coal mine. I
would like to ask why are there
no protests? Why isn't anybody
chanting "nocoalies"? Why are
the newspaper stories' which
covered these tragedies put on
page 197

If the deaths had been radi
ation-related editors would
have made it the biggest story of
the year. The president would
have taken some emergency ac
tion; "no-nuke" protests would
have swept the country.
I ask those against nuclear
power: why do you spend so
much energy trying to shut
down atomic power plants be
cause of their potential danger
when people are already dying
in coal mines? What's the mat
ter? Isn't coal eerie enough for
you?
Do you like radiation's popu
larity in science fiction'.' Do you
want to get on the protesting
bandwagon with the beautiful
Jane Fonda'.' Or are you just
content to let a few hundred peo
ple die every year for our
energy?
Anti-nukes and news editors,
you are not seeing things prop
erly when you protest the dan
gers of nuclear energy, but qui
etly dismiss five men dying in a
coal mine.

Word of caution
I read with great interest a
letter to the editor (Daily, Nov.
13) from the members of Roses
Against a Nuclear Environ
ment. Their cause is noble and I
admire their idealism. But I
must disagree with their sug
gestion that Stanford ban com
panies involved with weapons
production from recruiting at
CFFC.
My objections to their sugges
tion involves a question of free
dom of speech. Allowing some
companies to recruit while not
allowing defense firms abridges
the rights of students wanting to
interview with those firms.
Also, how would we decide on
whether a company is involved
in weapons production? What
criteria should we use: of
fensive systems, defensive,
strategic, tactical, nuclear,
conventional or all of the above?
What about companies like
Boeing? Boeing builds com
mercial jets but also builds
AWACS and will produce the
Air-Launched Cruise Missile.

Should we only let Boeing
divisions involved with civilian
systems recruit? Or should we
base our decision upon per
centage of profits from defense
related products?
If we deny campus facilities
to this one group, we can deny
campus facilities to others:
RCYB. gays, or any other "un
desirable" group; undesirable
in the opinion of some of the
Stanford community.
I would caution the members
of Roses Against a Nuclear En
vironment against imposing
their "morality" upon others.
It's Orwellian and I would reject
it. as I also reject 1) the Moral
Majority telling my children
when to pray, 2) the Catholic
Church telling my wife when she
can bear children, and 3) Jimmy
Carter telling me to register for
the draft!
These are all groups intent on
abridging my freedoms. Don't
let the Roses tell you who you
can and cannot talk to.

Marching band
As a member of the
L.5.J.11.M B. I am amazed at
the warlike mentlity with which
certain Stanford heroes
catapult water balloons at visit
ing bands! Who can blame other
schools for catapulting an on
slaught of roke bottles, ice, and
oranges ut the most obnoxious
marching troop in the world
when we visit other schools?
The L.S.J.LJ.M.B. strongly dis
courages abusing other bands
and thanks the lacrosse team
not only for their defense of us,
but also for their defense of
Berkeley's visiting band at last
year's Big Game!
Five seconds of warlike glory
and sadistic pleasure does not
justify the day's discomfort and
the possible injury to the one
being hit.

A charged idea
1 notice from your columns
that the mascot issue has come
right alive. 1 would much rather
not add something more to the
slew if 1 didn't have a strong
case in point. And yes. you
guessed it — the "Stanford elec
trons."
Whatever on earth has Stan
ford got to do with electrons?
Actually a lot. Stanford owes
much of its post-war reputation
to its innovations and achieve
ments in electronics education
and research. Besides, this area
is one of the leading centers of
the electronics industry.
Before the wail of protests
that this is too parochial a sym
bol start welling up, let us pause
and take a look at electrons

themselves.
Electrons are charged,
dynamic, light and swift — all
attributes befitting a high pow
ered offense like that of Stan
ford's. In this same vein not
much could be said of the de
fensive powers of either party.
Wouldn't it be nice to read
"Stanford electrons bombard
and split USC nucleus'' (though
it is a lot of wishful thinking > ?
Besides, why drag in the
archaic griffin (or is it griffon'.')
or the unimaginative tree'.' We
have to be in tune with the
times.
Still, how does one identify
oneself with something as in
tangible as an electron? Let us
face it; what are more universal
than electrons? As for those who

ask how to represent the mascot
symbol. 1 would shoot them with
an electron gun
All right then, let's get the
"electrons" excited. Physics
tells us the result should be noth
ing less than a quantum jump of
state.

In response to Scnell, et al.
(Daily, Nov. 12), I agree that
USC has "the most obnoxious
marching troop in the country."
1 don't agree, however, that that
justifies flinging water balloons
at them.
I d like to remind them that it
hurts to get nailed by a water
balloon And that's just when
the 12-vear-old down the street
throws one at you. Using a "sl
ingshot" from 20 rows up in
creases the force of those things
several times. Not to mention
the fact that if one hits some
one's instrument that person
could go home with a broken
tooth (or a broken instrument —
expensive).
That surgical tubing doesn't
make for particularly good aim,
either; a short fling could hit
one of our Band members (who
doesn't have one of those
helmets to protect his head).
My last comment has to do
with the claim by Schnell, et al.
that the balloon flingers "were
denied their right of freedom of
speech." Where does the First
Amendment say it's OK to in
jure someone?

it. as I also reject 1) the Moral
Majority telling my children
when to pray, 2) the Catholic
Church telling my wife when she
can bear children, and 3) Jimmy
Carter telling me to register for
the draft!
These are all groups intent on
abridging my freedoms. Don't
let the Roses tell you who you

Marching band
As a member of the
L.5.J.11.M B. I am amazed at
the warlike mentlity with which
certain Stanford heroes
catapult water balloons at visit
ing bands! Who can blame other
schools for catapulting an on
slaught of roke bottles, ice, and
oranges ut the most obnoxious
marching troop in the world
when we visit other schools?
The L.S.J.LJ.M.B. strongly dis
courages abusing other bands
and thanks the lacrosse team
not only for their defense of us,
but also for their defense of
Berkeley's visiting band at last
year's Big Game!
Five seconds of warlike glory
and sadistic pleasure does not
justify the day's discomfort and
the possible injury to the one
being hit.

A charged idea
1 notice from your columns
that the mascot issue has come
right alive. 1 would much rather
not add something more to the
slew if 1 didn't have a strong
case in point. And yes. you
guessed it — the "Stanford elec
trons."
Whatever on earth has Stan
ford got to do with electrons?
Actually a lot. Stanford owes
much of its post-war reputation
to its innovations and achieve
ments in electronics education
and research. Besides, this area
is one of the leading centers of
the electronics industry.
Before the wail of protests
that this is too parochial a sym
bol start welling up, let us pause
and take a look at electrons

themselves.
Electrons are charged,
dynamic, light and swift — all
attributes befitting a high pow
ered offense like that of Stan
ford's. In this same vein not
much could be said of the de
fensive powers of either party.
Wouldn't it be nice to read
"Stanford electrons bombard
and split USC nucleus'' (though
it is a lot of wishful thinking > ?
Besides, why drag in the
archaic griffin (or is it griffon'.')
or the unimaginative tree'.' We
have to be in tune with the
times.
Still, how does one identify
oneself with something as in
tangible as an electron? Let us
face it; what are more universal
than electrons? As for those who

ask how to represent the mascot
symbol. 1 would shoot them with
an electron gun
All right then, let's get the
"electrons" excited. Physics
tells us the result should be noth
ing less than a quantum jump of
state.

Bleacher antics
In response to Scnell, et al.
(Daily, Nov. 12), I agree that
USC has "the most obnoxious
marching troop in the country."
1 don't agree, however, that that
justifies flinging water balloons
at them.
I d like to remind them that it
hurts to get nailed by a water
balloon And that's just when
the 12-vear-old down the street
throws one at you. Using a "sl
ingshot" from 20 rows up in
creases the force of those things
several times. Not to mention
the fact that if one hits some
one's instrument that person
could go home with a broken
tooth (or a broken instrument —
expensive).
That surgical tubing doesn't
make for particularly good aim,
either; a short fling could hit
one of our Band members (who
doesn't have one of those
helmets to protect his head).
My last comment has to do
with the claim by Schnell, et al.
that the balloon flingers "were
denied their right of freedom of
speech." Where does the First
Amendment say it's OK to in
jure someone?

No coal protest?
Over the weekend five men
died in a methane gas explosion
in a West Virginia coal mine.
Across the country, during the
last six weeks. 26 people have
died in coal mining accidents. A
couple of years ago 50 people
died in a Japanese coal mine. I
would like to ask why are there
no protests? Why isn't anybody
chanting "nocoalies"? Why are
the newspaper stories' which
covered these tragedies put on
page 197

If the deaths had been radi
ation-related editors would
have made it the biggest story of
the year. The president would
have taken some emergency ac
tion; "no-nuke" protests would
have swept the country.
I ask those against nuclear
power: why do you spend so
much energy trying to shut
down atomic power plants be
cause of their potential danger
when people are already dying
in coal mines? What's the mat
ter? Isn't coal eerie enough for
you?
Do you like radiation's popu
larity in science fiction'.' Do you
want to get on the protesting
bandwagon with the beautiful
Jane Fonda'.' Or are you just
content to let a few hundred peo
ple die every year for our
energy?
Anti-nukes and news editors,
you are not seeing things prop
erly when you protest the dan
gers of nuclear energy, but qui
etly dismiss five men dying in a
coal mine.

Word of caution
I read with great interest a
letter to the editor (Daily, Nov.
13) from the members of Roses
Against a Nuclear Environ
ment. Their cause is noble and I
admire their idealism. But I
must disagree with their sug
gestion that Stanford ban com
panies involved with weapons
production from recruiting at
CFFC.
My objections to their sugges
tion involves a question of free
dom of speech. Allowing some
companies to recruit while not
allowing defense firms abridges
the rights of students wanting to
interview with those firms.
Also, how would we decide on
whether a company is involved
in weapons production? What
criteria should we use: of
fensive systems, defensive,
strategic, tactical, nuclear,
conventional or all of the above?
What about companies like
Boeing? Boeing builds com
mercial jets but also builds
AWACS and will produce the
Air-Launched Cruise Missile.

Should we only let Boeing
divisions involved with civilian
systems recruit? Or should we
base our decision upon per
centage of profits from defense
related products?
If we deny campus facilities
to this one group, we can deny
campus facilities to others:
RCYB. gays, or any other "un
desirable" group; undesirable
in the opinion of some of the
Stanford community.
I would caution the members
of Roses Against a Nuclear En
vironment against imposing
their "morality" upon others.
It's Orwellian and I would reject
it. as I also reject 1) the Moral
Majority telling my children
when to pray, 2) the Catholic
Church telling my wife when she
can bear children, and 3) Jimmy
Carter telling me to register for
the draft!
These are all groups intent on
abridging my freedoms. Don't
let the Roses tell you who you
can and cannot talk to.
