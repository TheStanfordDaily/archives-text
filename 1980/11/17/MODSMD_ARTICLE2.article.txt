# Domestic problems presented

### Hank Waxman 
Health care, energy and defense
were the domestic issues addressed in
Saturday's Issues ol the Eighties"
symposium sponsored by the Alumni
Association.
"Combating the high cost of Health
Care" was the title of Medical and
Business School Prof. Alain Entoven's
presentation. He explained that the
$250 billion spent on health care last
year was 9.5 percent of the nation's
gross national product. Public sector
spending on health care has risen from
$56 billion to $100 billion since 1975, he
said.
Entoven attributed the boom in
costs to a lack of competition which
encourages maximum spending at all
levels of the medical industry. "Doc
tors receive more revenue for provid
ing more treatment whether or not it
does more for the patient. Hospitals
are reimbursed for their expenditures
and are thereby encouraged to spend
more per patient than is necessary,"
he said.
Need competition
Entoven said the best defense
against spiralling costs is competitive
pricing.
He proposed two specific measures
to introduce competition into the
Health ('are industry and cut "flat of
the curve" spending.
"Matching resources to the
needs of those served": the avail
ability of surgeons in a given area is
proportional to the number of
surgeries done in that area. But,
many unnecessary surgeries are
presently performed in areas where
there are too many surgeons." En
toven said
Regional concentration of cost
ly. specialized services" if major
surgeries were concentrated in a few
hospitals, specialists could be kept
busy and could afford to charge less.
Also, hospitals could be specialized to
handle such operations more efficient
ly.
Entoven warned that making the
medical industry competitive is dif
ficult because the insurance com
panies. organized labor, and the
American Medical Association all
benefit from the current system. How
ever. "the competition school should
be better represented in the next Con
gress. " he said.
Energy from coal
Thomas Connolly, associate chair
man of the Mechanical Engineering
Dept.. spoke next. He predicted that
coal will play an increasing role in the
U.S. energy supply. He projected an
increase in coal production from the
current seven to eight million tons per
vear to 15 to 16 million by the year
20(H).
He said he also expects American
dependence on oil imports to continue
