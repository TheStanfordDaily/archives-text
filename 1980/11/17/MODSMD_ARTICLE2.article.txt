# Domestic problems presented
## 
### Hank Waxman 
Health care, energy and defense
were the domestic issues addressed in
Saturday's Issues ol the Eighties"
symposium sponsored by the Alumni
Association.
"Combating the high cost of Health
Care" was the title of Medical and
Business School Prof. Alain Entoven's
presentation. He explained that the
$250 billion spent on health care last
year was 9.5 percent of the nation's
gross national product. Public sector
spending on health care has risen from
$56 billion to $100 billion since 1975, he
said.
Entoven attributed the boom in
costs to a lack of competition which
encourages maximum spending at all
levels of the medical industry. "Doc
tors receive more revenue for provid
ing more treatment whether or not it
does more for the patient. Hospitals
are reimbursed for their expenditures
and are thereby encouraged to spend
more per patient than is necessary,"
he said.
Need competition
Entoven said the best defense
against spiralling costs is competitive
pricing.
He proposed two specific measures
to introduce competition into the
Health ('are industry and cut "flat of
the curve" spending.
"Matching resources to the
needs of those served": the avail
ability of surgeons in a given area is
proportional to the number of
surgeries done in that area. But,
many unnecessary surgeries are
presently performed in areas where
there are too many surgeons." En
toven said
Regional concentration of cost
ly. specialized services" if major
surgeries were concentrated in a few
hospitals, specialists could be kept
busy and could afford to charge less.
Also, hospitals could be specialized to
handle such operations more efficient
ly.
Entoven warned that making the
medical industry competitive is dif
ficult because the insurance com
panies. organized labor, and the
American Medical Association all
benefit from the current system. How
ever. "the competition school should
be better represented in the next Con
gress. " he said.
Energy from coal
Thomas Connolly, associate chair
man of the Mechanical Engineering
Dept.. spoke next. He predicted that
coal will play an increasing role in the
U.S. energy supply. He projected an
increase in coal production from the
current seven to eight million tons per
vear to 15 to 16 million by the year
20(H).
He said he also expects American
dependence on oil imports to continue
lor the rest of the century The prob
lem is not a shortage of energy as
much as a shortage of liquid fuels." he
said
Although oil substitutes are now
available, they are of limited use. ac
cording to Connolly Synthetic fuels
can now be extracted from oil shale
and coal But rapid development of
these energy sources, as planned by
President Jimmy Carter's Synfuel
Bill of Energy Security Act. would be
an inefficient use of investment be
cause of insufficient technology, he
said
Electricity demand high
Connolly also expressed concern
about the ability of power plants to
keep pace with the increasing demand
tor electricity. "Ever since 1973. the
growth rate of electricity consump
tion has stayed well ahead of primary
energy in general. This presents a
problem of whether we can support it
or not.' he said.
(liven the already large invest
ments made in nuclear development,
nuclear power plants "will open an ec
onomic wound from which we will
bleed" if they are not utilized. For ex
ample. Connolly said the Diablo Ca
nyon plant, not in service now due to
litigation, could replace 20 million
barrels of oil a year.
In conclusion. Connolly emphasized
that the U.S. energy future is unclear.
"I hope the Reagan administration
will be able to convince people things
are really serious." he said.
Manley's election results
John Manley, Political Science
Dept chairman, said the results of the
election were not as much a con

servative mandate as a referendum on
the Carter presidency
"Economics, not ideology, decided
the presidential election." he said
The result will be a "shift from south
ern Democratic conservatism to
western conservatism — the dif
ference is only a matter of degree,"
Manlev said
He expects the Keagan adminis
tration to abolish wage-price
guidelines — a measure Manley said
will matter little — and to cut taxes by
10 percent and government spending
by 2 percent Immediate results are
extremely unlikely." he noted. "(Re
agan) will face the same problems
Carter failed to solve, no Draconian
measures are likely. "
Business School Prof. Henry Rowen
criticized the recent "U.S. emphasis
of arms control and our view of arms
agreements with the Soviet Union as
bilateral " He claimed that this policy
has yielded, isolation of the U.S.
from its allies and fueled the growth of
neutralism in Europe."
There's nothing to be gained by
pursuing a SALT 11-like agreement be
cause the Soviet Union is totally unaf
fected by the SALT treaties so the en
deavor is totally asymmetrical," he
said
Rowen predicted "there's going to
be a struggle with the Soviet Union for
resources." Describing the Soviets'
policy, he said. The first tenet of that
system is to have a superior mili
tary."
According to Rowen. our first de
fense priority should be to improve
both our access to the Persian Gulf
and our posture in that area through
agreements with Israel. Turkey and
Egypt.
He explained that the U.S. is now
spending about 5 percent of the GNP
on defense — the lowest figure of the
post-war era. He claimed the U.S.
could increase defense spending
without raising the national budget by
reversing Carter's massive realloca
tion of spending to the public sector
and gross allocations for transfer
payments."

Manley's election results
John Manley, Political Science
Dept chairman, said the results of the
election were not as much a con

servative mandate as a referendum on
the Carter presidency
"Economics, not ideology, decided
the presidential election." he said
The result will be a "shift from south
ern Democratic conservatism to
western conservatism — the dif
ference is only a matter of degree,"
Manlev said
He expects the Keagan adminis
tration to abolish wage-price
guidelines — a measure Manley said
will matter little — and to cut taxes by
10 percent and government spending
by 2 percent Immediate results are
extremely unlikely." he noted. "(Re
agan) will face the same problems
Carter failed to solve, no Draconian
measures are likely. "
Business School Prof. Henry Rowen
criticized the recent "U.S. emphasis
of arms control and our view of arms
agreements with the Soviet Union as
bilateral " He claimed that this policy
has yielded, isolation of the U.S.
from its allies and fueled the growth of
neutralism in Europe."
There's nothing to be gained by
pursuing a SALT 11-like agreement be
cause the Soviet Union is totally unaf
fected by the SALT treaties so the en
deavor is totally asymmetrical," he
said
Rowen predicted "there's going to
be a struggle with the Soviet Union for
resources." Describing the Soviets'
policy, he said. The first tenet of that
system is to have a superior mili
tary."
According to Rowen. our first de
fense priority should be to improve
both our access to the Persian Gulf
and our posture in that area through
agreements with Israel. Turkey and
Egypt.
He explained that the U.S. is now
spending about 5 percent of the GNP
on defense — the lowest figure of the
post-war era. He claimed the U.S.
could increase defense spending
without raising the national budget by
reversing Carter's massive realloca
tion of spending to the public sector
and gross allocations for transfer
payments."
Health care, energy and defense
were the domestic issues addressed in
Saturday's Issues ol the Eighties"
symposium sponsored by the Alumni
Association.
"Combating the high cost of Health
Care" was the title of Medical and
Business School Prof. Alain Entoven's
presentation. He explained that the
$250 billion spent on health care last
year was 9.5 percent of the nation's
gross national product. Public sector
spending on health care has risen from
$56 billion to $100 billion since 1975, he
said.
Entoven attributed the boom in
costs to a lack of competition which
encourages maximum spending at all
levels of the medical industry. "Doc
tors receive more revenue for provid
ing more treatment whether or not it
does more for the patient. Hospitals
are reimbursed for their expenditures
and are thereby encouraged to spend
more per patient than is necessary,"
he said.
Need competition
Entoven said the best defense
against spiralling costs is competitive
pricing.
He proposed two specific measures
to introduce competition into the
Health ('are industry and cut "flat of
the curve" spending.
"Matching resources to the
needs of those served": the avail
ability of surgeons in a given area is
proportional to the number of
surgeries done in that area. But,
many unnecessary surgeries are
presently performed in areas where
there are too many surgeons." En
toven said
Regional concentration of cost
ly. specialized services" if major
surgeries were concentrated in a few
hospitals, specialists could be kept
busy and could afford to charge less.
Also, hospitals could be specialized to
handle such operations more efficient
ly.
Entoven warned that making the
medical industry competitive is dif
ficult because the insurance com
panies. organized labor, and the
American Medical Association all
benefit from the current system. How
ever. "the competition school should
be better represented in the next Con
gress. " he said.
Energy from coal
Thomas Connolly, associate chair
man of the Mechanical Engineering
Dept.. spoke next. He predicted that
coal will play an increasing role in the
U.S. energy supply. He projected an
increase in coal production from the
current seven to eight million tons per
vear to 15 to 16 million by the year
20(H).
He said he also expects American
dependence on oil imports to continue
lor the rest of the century The prob
lem is not a shortage of energy as
much as a shortage of liquid fuels." he
said
Although oil substitutes are now
available, they are of limited use. ac
cording to Connolly Synthetic fuels
can now be extracted from oil shale
and coal But rapid development of
these energy sources, as planned by
President Jimmy Carter's Synfuel
Bill of Energy Security Act. would be
an inefficient use of investment be
cause of insufficient technology, he
said
Electricity demand high
Connolly also expressed concern
about the ability of power plants to
keep pace with the increasing demand
tor electricity. "Ever since 1973. the
growth rate of electricity consump
tion has stayed well ahead of primary
energy in general. This presents a
problem of whether we can support it
or not.' he said.
(liven the already large invest
ments made in nuclear development,
nuclear power plants "will open an ec
onomic wound from which we will
bleed" if they are not utilized. For ex
