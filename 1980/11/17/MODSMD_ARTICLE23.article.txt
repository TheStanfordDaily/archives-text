Washington (AP) — President-elect Ronald
Reagan and the new Congress should take a
harder line against domestic radicals, includ
ing reviving congressional internal security
committees like the ones active during the Mc-
Carthy era of the 19505, an influential con
servative research group said Saturday.
The Heritage Foundation called for the
stepped-up activities against dissidents as part
of a blueprint for conservative policies that
was presented Thursday to top officials of the
Reagan transition team, some of whom have
close connections with the Washington-based
foundation.
"The threat to the internal security of the
Republic is greater today than at any time
since World War II," the Heritage report said
in recommending "presidential emphasis on
the nature of the threat.... the reality of sub
version and emphasis on the un-American na
ture of much so-called dissidence. "
Besides calling for the revival of the House
Internal Security Committee, formerly known
as the House Un-American Activities Commit
tee. the conservative group called for ending

restrictions that ban mail openings by the FBI,
require prior approval from the president and
attorney general before the FBI can conduct
break-ins. and only permit investigation of po
litical groups when they are suspected of crim
inal activity.
The Heritage Foundation listed among
groups that should be put under tighter sur
veillance communist parties, radical and New
Left groups, "anti-defense and anti-nuclear
lobbies." and white racist groups like the Ku
Klux Klan.
II added: "Clergymen, students, busi
nessmen. entertainers, labor officials, jour
nalists and government workers may engage
in subversive activities without being fully
aware of the extent, purpose or control of their
activities."
The Keagan transition office declined to
comment on the role that the Heritage study
will play beyond repeating an earlier
statement that the report had "no official sta
tus" and noting that "we're paying attention to
a lot of different reports."
