# Scholars praise U.S. in Vietnam
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
When Ronald Reagan in a
campaign speech last August
called the Vietnam War a
noble cause." he drew a
scornful response from many.
Some political observers con
sidered the. remark a gaffe and
wondered how he could have
said such a thing.
As it happens. Reagan wasn t
so far out on a limb. Among a
small but increasingly vocal mi
nority of scholars, a "new re
visionism' about America's in
volvement in Vietnam has al
ready begun
The catalyst has been the Ha
noi government's actions, and
related events, since the fall of
Saigon in April 1975.
The revisionists note that Ha
noi's occupation of Cambodia,
domination of Laos and recent
incursion into Thailand were
precisely what many feared
would happen if South Vietnam
was lost.
Other fears also have been re
alized. they say: Southeast Asia
is unstable and facing growing
Soviet domination: the United
States' power abroad is
diminished, and Hanoi has
caused worse suffering than
South Vietnam President
Nguyen Van Thieu's regime by
confining tens of thousands to
"re-education camps," forcing
the "boat people" to the sea and
badly mismanaging the econo
my.
Honorable concerns
Virtually all scholars still say
America should never have got
ten involved in Vietnam because

the costs were too high and the
goals unachievable Hut some
now argue that, although the
war effort was badly misguided,
recent events prove the con
cerns of the pro-war camp to be
honorable and legitimate.
And. once in the war. U.S.
prestige and credibility as a ma
jor power were on the line, the
pro-war camp argued
Since 1975. some have argued,
all this has happened Laos and
Cambodia are under Vietnam
ese control: Thailand has asked
American troops to leave its
country: the Philippines has
asked for a review of the future
status of U.S. bases there, and
Indonesia's foreign minister
speaks of "cooperation" with
the communist regimes.
They talk of America's
"weakened will" since Vietnam
and "diminished power" in the
world, and link this to every
thing from Soviet strategy in the
Middle East to the taking of
hostages in Iran. They fear that
the real danger is not that Mos
cow will achieve hegemony in
the Third World but that re

gional balances ot power will be
upset and thus the threat of war
increased
Historical verdirt
Might riot history decide that
the loss of Vietnam led indirect
ly to losses elsewhere in Asia
and Africa
In explaining the last live
years' events, most scholars re
peatedly use such phrases as
historical perspective" and
traditional patterns." What
has happened, they say. will be
seen years from now as the in
evitable flow of history, a cur
rent that could not have been al
tered even if it should have
been They believe these condi
tions tinallv will be seen as the
historically inevitable result of
what they call the 20th Cen
tury's major shaping forces
decolonization and nationalism
and not as a result of Viet
nam
Hanoi's current alignment
with the Soviet Union is a
"forced necessity." and not an
inevitable result of the wai said
Dave Klliott. an assistant pro

lessor of government and in
ternational relations at Pomona
College in California. "It was
caused bv the alliance between
the I nited States and China, and
by the failure of the United
States to recognize and nor
malize relations with Hanoi
Involvement
It anything, these scholars
said, what we are now seeing
may be a result of America's in
volvement in the war. not its de
feat.
Elliott said. "The United
States found itself in an un
precedentedlv dominant posi
tion in the post-World War II
world, partly because the other
ma jor countries were weakened
by the war Some people just as
sumed that the situation was
permanent, that the United
States was to be the colossus
world power. But in fact, our
position then was a tem-orarv
historical accident, an aberra
tion Other countries recovered,
and the United States fell back
to its normal position as a power
among other powers."
