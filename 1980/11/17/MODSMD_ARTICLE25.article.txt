# Federal budget slashed
## 
### Washington Post 
Los Angeles— Ronald Re
agan's chief economic advisers
are urging the president-elect to
make an immediate, hard as
sault on federal spending next
year, including cuts in some re
tiree programs that have been
considered off-limits by past
Republican and Democratic ad
ministrations.
Although the new plan will be
based on the economic pro
posals Reagan and his advisers
agreed on in September, it
pushes much harder, advisers
said
It reflects the advisers' belief
that Reagan's election coin
cides with a sharp conservative
turn by the nation, giving Re
agan the power to challenge
Congress with demands for deep
cuts in spending and broader
tax-cut proposals.

The advisers would not dis
cuss specific spending recom
mendations on a list prepared
for Reagan by Caspar Wein
berger. former director of the
Office of Management and
Budget and one of the 13 ad
visers. But when Weinberger
was asked Saturday if the cuts
included reductions in the auto
matic cost-of-living adjustment
in federal payments to retirees,
he responded. "Yes."
More than a simple trimming
'of administrative fat in the
budget is being planned. Wein
berger said. "Substantial legis
lative changes will have to be
made." he told reporters.
Assault on budget
Several of Reagan's advisers
said an assault on the federal
budget has become the center
piece of the strategy they are
drafting They see that as the
only way a Reagan adminis
tration can bring down the
double-digit interest rates on
long-term borrowing by corpo
rations and the government.
Long-term rates will not
come down until investors be
lieve the government has a
credible plan for reducing infla
tion. not just next year but
three, four and five years ahead,
said Alan Greenspan, a top Re
agan adviser and former chair
man of the Council of Economic
Advisers under President
Gerald Ford. And the only way
to send that message is to cut
back hard immediately on gov

ernment spending programs,
reducing their impact not only
on the 1981 budget but also on
future budgets, he added.
Greenspan said that in his
view the focus on long-term rate
reduction is critical and must be
pursued even if tax and spend
ing decisions cause short-term
interest rates to remain high
temporarily. "Maybe that's a
necessary condition for getting
significantly lower rates six or
nine months out.'' he said.
Weinberger has said the new
administration will seek to hold
spending in the current fiscal
year to $620 billion — the target
proposed in September. That
task appears much harder now
than it did in September, be
cause of an accelerating trend
in federal spending.
Tax cut
The Reagan camp's growing
optimism about the new presi
dent's political clout also has
led to recommendations for a
broader tax-cut plan, advisers
said.
One adviser wouldn't spell out
the plan, but he said he still fa
vors the Reagan campaign pro
posal for 10 percent reductions
in individual income taxes in
each of the next three years —
the controversial Kemp-Roth
proposal that Reagan advisors
say will lead to significant in
creases in savings and invest
ments. That was Reagan's in
itial plan, and he is expected to
stick to it.
