# Backroads of Portola Valley offer cyclists variety, change of scenery
## 
### Elizabeth Newberry 
Step up. push off. swing your
leg over, start pedaling and
you're off on your bike to nearby
Portola Valley, where forests,
mansions and even towns wait
to be discovered
With a halfway decent bike
and a minimal sense of direc
tion. these backroads are within
easy reach It takes only 10 to 15
minutes to get out of town, and
these clear November days are
a great time to start exploring
Main loop 15 miles
We'll start with the main
route through Portola Valley.
This ride rolls very gently
around the base of the foothills
and makes a loop of about 15
miles.
Leave campus going north on

.Junipero Serra Road and at the
stoplight turn left onto Alpine
Road Alpine leads you toward
the hills for the next four miles,
complicated only by an en
counter with Interstate 280 and
by some recent road construc
tion farther on
At the top of a very gradual
climb. Alpine meets Portola
Road, where there is a gas sta
tion with a water faucet for
those who didn't bring water
bottles.
After turning right on
Portola. you 11 find the road
slopes more down than up until
you reach the base of Sand Hill
Road This climb looks much
worse than it really is. and often
a tailwind will help you get over
it.

Klv down the other side, but
after passing over the freeway,
watch the cars merging from
your right It is usually easier to
stay to the left and let the traffic
pass. rather than hurrying
across in front of it.
Sand Hill climbs once more,
past 280. and then it is all down
hill to the intersection with San
ta Cruz Avenue on the left and
Alpine Road on the right Veer
right here, watching traffic
again so you can get immediate
ly into the left lane. .Just around
the bend this becomes the left
turn lane that will return you
back to .lunipero Serra. the loop
completed.
Reverse route
The route actually makes two
rides, because in each direction
the terrain, scenery and even
colors can differ greatly In re
verse the Portola Valley loop in
volves somewhat more climb
ing. though it is all still gradual
To make this loop a little long
er and more scenic, start by rid
ing south about one mile on
.Junipero Serra to Page Mill
Road Turn right here, and
make another quick right,
through the narrow opening to
Old Page Mill Road.
This more rural route avoids
the climb on Page Mill and of
fers a break from the heavy
traffic. Toward the end of it.
look to the *teft for the round
brick structure known as
Frenchman's Tower
At the first intersection past
Interstate 280. turn right onto
Arastradero Road. It rolls up
and down to a short climb over
the crest of a hill and into a
quick descent. At the bottom
you may spot the beehive in an
oak tree on your right.
A bit farther and the road
ends about three quarters of the

way up Alpine Turning left here
will take you back around the
Portola Valley loop, or you can
turn right and head back to cam
pus. completing a loop of about
10 miles.
Extend the loop
A further extension of the
Portola Valley loop can be made
by going into the city of Woods
ide Before going over Jasper
Ridge at the north end of the
loop and onto Sand Hill, turn left
on Portola and veer left again at
the following fork to Highway
84 This is a heavily traveled
road, but very smooth and
scenic.
Turning right at the fork on
Portola leads to a more rural
backroad. as its name suggests:
Mountain Home Road. There is
no mountain here, though, and
after about two miles you
emerge in Woodside.
From Woodside take Whiskey
Hill Road, a right turn past the
old-fashioned yellow building at
the top of town. You'll recognize
where you come out on Sand
Hill, and you can then complete
the Portola Valley loop.
Combinations possible
Combining these roads in var
ious loops and directions will
open up a large area to explore,
and they provide access to many
other rides in the area.
If you prefer to join an or
ganized outing, there are sever
al group rides available each
week for cyclists. Tuesdays and
Thursdays at 7 a.m. the Stan
ford Cycling Club leaves the
Stanford Post Office for a 1 1 2-
hour ride of about 20 miles. Sat
urday mornings a moderately
paced, perhaps longer ride
leaves the post office at 9:30
a.m. and faster-paced rides
leave on Mondays. Wednesdays
and Fridavs at 7 a.m.


Cyclists who enjoy racing their two-wheeled contraptions around campus are ready to hit the wide
open roads of the nearby foothills. Portola Valley offers bikers several scenic routes of moderate
length and elevation gain, and campus groups welcome riders who want join in exploring the area.
