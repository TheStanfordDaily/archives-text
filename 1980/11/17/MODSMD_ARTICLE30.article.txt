going when he popped the ball in
over the middle on a pass from
James Bergeson Bv the end of
the quarter the Cards had
scored three more goals in only
2'a minutes
Bergeson scored the second
goal with 2:35 remaining in the

By the end of the half Stanford
had shocked the fans, the Bears
and themselves by moving out
in front 7-3. On the first Stanford
offensive play Chris Kelsev

skipped the ball in from five
meters behind a Bergeson pick
