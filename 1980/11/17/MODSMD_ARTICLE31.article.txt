# Stanford hopes for a Georgia Peach

Since Stanford will not be going to Pasadena January 1, the Cards
are aiming their sights tor Atlanta's Peach Bowl the day after. But
as Rhett Butler learned, getting a Georgia Peach to commit herself
is not the easiest thing in the world to do.
Though the Peach Bowl selection committee meets today, it
seems that Stanford won't learn until after Saturday's Big Game
whether or not it will be invited to face Virginia Tech. If invited, the
school would accept, according to Athletic Director Andy Geiger.
Peach Bowl committee member Art Gregory said yesterday that
today's meeting will be used to "get a pecking order established for
the other half of the bowl.''
According to Gregory, other teams in the running include Indi
ana. Miami (Fla.). Kansas and LSU. The committee is considering
two qualifications: ability to sell tickets and ability to catch a na
tionwide viewing audience on CBS-TV.
"Certainly Stanford would be accomodating to our major
network contract." Gregory said, "and keeping CBS happy is a big
part of our objective. As far as television, Stanford is No. 1.
"The thing that would mitigate against Stanford is geography,"
Gregory added. "There is a disadvantage in getting fans to Atlanta.
We want to structure the bowl to pay the biggest payout we can. In
ticket ranking. Stanford is at the bottom of the spectrum."
However, even with a capacity crowd in Atlanta Stadium (58,000)
for last year's matchup between Baylor and Clemson, the Peach
Bowl would not have ranked eighth among the 15 bowls in payout
without CBS-TV's money. This is the final year in a three-year con
tract between CBS-TV and the Peach Bowl, and the network has
never gotten outstanding ratings in its coverage of the game.
Thus with the contract in renegotiation, one might think the bowl
officials would do all they could to keep CBS-TV happy. That means
inviting Stanford. As one Atlanta sportswriter told the Daily , "They
(the bowl and CBS-TV) were far apart on the contract. I imagine
they are farther apart after getting Virginia Tech.''
Gregory said the bowl would not give the television factor any
more meaning than the ticket sales, saying there was no question
that CBS-TV would complete renegotiation of the present contract.
And he admitted that if Stanford is invited, ticket sales will be writ-
