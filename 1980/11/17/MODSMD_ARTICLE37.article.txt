# KZSU speaker: peaceful Reagan presidency possible
## 
### Kimberly Brown 
President-elect Ronald Reagan's war-hawk
image is overcharged and exaggerated, said Dr.
Seymour Martin Lipset on KZSU's Campus
Conference Thursday night.
Lipset. a professor of political science and so
ciology. and senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. analyzed the election and its implications
in a program entitled. "President Reagan, what
does it mean?"
He said Reagan may seem highly doctrinaire
but is more pragmatic in practice. "It's the
dynamics of politics. Once a person gets into
power and is faced with problems, ideologies be
come much less important." said Lipset.
Citing a "foreign policy law of politics" which
says "if you want something, vote for the other
guy." Lipset suggested that once elected, a can
didate may do exactly the opposite of their cam
paign stands.
"A pattern of conversion" exists based on the
conflict of two principles, he said "One is that
we re anti-communist, and the other is that we

want peace."
"The people identified as hawks don't have to
prove they're anti-communist — they have to
prove they want peace The doves don't have to
prove they re for peace — they have to prove
they're anti-communist."
Lipset said that since doves try to show
they 're tough and hawks try to show they're soft,
fear of Reagan may prove unwarranted.
Asked to interpret the meaning of the presi
dential election. Lipset said it was clearly a vote
against Jimmy Carter.
He said the 1980 electorate faced a dilemma:
it wanted to get rid of Carter yet feared a Re
agan presidency. Thus, the Republican's main
campaign problem was not convincing the pub
lic that "Carter was hopeless." but that "Re
agan wasn't a monster."
' The problem is that we can't just vote
against somebody but have to vote for an alter
native — and sometimes, no matter how much
we like the incumbent, the other side looks
worse." Lipset said.

He believes most European leaders view the
situation from the same standpoint as Ameri
cans. Our western allies see Carter as incompe
tent and strongly preferred someone else. How
ever. they see Reagan as militaristic, he said.
When asked about the president-elect's two-
Chinas stance. Lipset said Reagan will probably
deal with the situation "more or less like Carter
did. and suspects he'll "get along very well
with the mainland Chinese."
"There's no other regime in the world as mili
tarily hostile to the USSR, so this election is
probably welcome there rather than feared," he
said.
In regard to the Middle East. Lipset predicts
Reagan will follow the pattern of his predeces
sors.
Recent presidents have all run on pro-Israeli
tickets, as did Reagan, who garnered a surpris
ing amount of the Jewish vote.
According to Lipset, "Each president gets
into office and discovers this Middle East dis
pute takes up an enormous amount of his time.

He decides to do something about it once and for
all during the first one or two years of his term."
In an effort to deal with the Arabs, the presi
dent begins putting pressure on Israel. At that
point. Congress steps in and the thing becomes
an unsolvable problem, he said.
Concerning Reagan's probable Cabinet
choices. Lipset said he's "almost beginning to
think we may see a replay'' of the Nixon years.
Lipset said there are a number of prime can
didates for the cabinet here at Stanford. Among
them, he cited: Martin Anderson, economist and
senior fellow at Hoover; George Shultz, Busi
ness School professor; Mike Boskin, economics
professor; Henry Rowen. Business School pro
fessor; Tom Moore. Business School lecturer
and senior fellow at Hoover. He also named a
number of other economists from the Business
School, the Economics Dept. and the Hoover In
stitution as possible choices for cabinet posi
tions.

want peace."
"The people identified as hawks don't have to
prove they're anti-communist — they have to
prove they want peace The doves don't have to
prove they re for peace — they have to prove
they're anti-communist."
Lipset said that since doves try to show
they 're tough and hawks try to show they're soft,
fear of Reagan may prove unwarranted.
Asked to interpret the meaning of the presi
dential election. Lipset said it was clearly a vote
against Jimmy Carter.
He said the 1980 electorate faced a dilemma:
it wanted to get rid of Carter yet feared a Re
agan presidency. Thus, the Republican's main
campaign problem was not convincing the pub
lic that "Carter was hopeless." but that "Re
agan wasn't a monster."
' The problem is that we can't just vote
against somebody but have to vote for an alter
native — and sometimes, no matter how much
we like the incumbent, the other side looks
worse." Lipset said.

He believes most European leaders view the
situation from the same standpoint as Ameri
cans. Our western allies see Carter as incompe
tent and strongly preferred someone else. How
ever. they see Reagan as militaristic, he said.
When asked about the president-elect's two-
Chinas stance. Lipset said Reagan will probably
deal with the situation "more or less like Carter
did. and suspects he'll "get along very well
with the mainland Chinese."
"There's no other regime in the world as mili
tarily hostile to the USSR, so this election is
probably welcome there rather than feared," he
said.
In regard to the Middle East. Lipset predicts
Reagan will follow the pattern of his predeces
sors.
Recent presidents have all run on pro-Israeli
tickets, as did Reagan, who garnered a surpris
ing amount of the Jewish vote.
According to Lipset, "Each president gets
into office and discovers this Middle East dis
pute takes up an enormous amount of his time.

He decides to do something about it once and for
all during the first one or two years of his term."
In an effort to deal with the Arabs, the presi
dent begins putting pressure on Israel. At that
point. Congress steps in and the thing becomes
an unsolvable problem, he said.
Concerning Reagan's probable Cabinet
choices. Lipset said he's "almost beginning to
think we may see a replay'' of the Nixon years.
Lipset said there are a number of prime can
didates for the cabinet here at Stanford. Among
them, he cited: Martin Anderson, economist and
senior fellow at Hoover; George Shultz, Busi
ness School professor; Mike Boskin, economics
professor; Henry Rowen. Business School pro
fessor; Tom Moore. Business School lecturer
and senior fellow at Hoover. He also named a
number of other economists from the Business
School, the Economics Dept. and the Hoover In
stitution as possible choices for cabinet posi
tions.
President-elect Ronald Reagan's war-hawk
image is overcharged and exaggerated, said Dr.
Seymour Martin Lipset on KZSU's Campus
Conference Thursday night.
Lipset. a professor of political science and so
ciology. and senior fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion. analyzed the election and its implications
in a program entitled. "President Reagan, what
does it mean?"
He said Reagan may seem highly doctrinaire
but is more pragmatic in practice. "It's the
dynamics of politics. Once a person gets into
power and is faced with problems, ideologies be
come much less important." said Lipset.
Citing a "foreign policy law of politics" which
says "if you want something, vote for the other
guy." Lipset suggested that once elected, a can
didate may do exactly the opposite of their cam
paign stands.
"A pattern of conversion" exists based on the
conflict of two principles, he said "One is that
we re anti-communist, and the other is that we

want peace."
"The people identified as hawks don't have to
prove they're anti-communist — they have to
prove they want peace The doves don't have to
prove they re for peace — they have to prove
they're anti-communist."
Lipset said that since doves try to show
they 're tough and hawks try to show they're soft,
