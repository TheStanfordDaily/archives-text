# ASSU typing service
## Rates raised to defray deficit 
### Doug Jehl 
A revamped ASSI : Typing Service
raised its prices by 50 percent this
year in an attempt to avoid last year's
financial deficit
The basic rate increased from $1 to
$1.50 per page.
The service lost between $1800 and
$2000 last year. Because of this. ASSU
Financial Manager Steve Davis ex
plained. "We thought about not bring
ing the service back because to do so
was kind of a risky proposition But we
decided that the program had met its
major objectives last year that the
main problem had been that we
weren't charging enough.'
Mike Orsack. who took over as
project director last April, said. Last
year, we wanted to provide students
with good service at reasonable and
competitive rates — we thought that
the rate of $1 per page would be suffi
cient."
But this rate proved to be too com
petitive. We later realized that the
bulk ot our competition was charging
$1.25 to $1.75 a page, and that we'd do
well to increase our rates.'' Orsack
said The service remained open dur
ing part of the summer, and ex

perimented with prices between $1.15
and $1.25 per page.
The service closed for most of the
summer, however, because demand
was low During this period. Davisand
others evaluated the program.
Steve felt that since the program
was meeting its objectives - it was
providing a valuable service at rea
sonable rates and was close to break
ing even — that it should be eon
tiriued.' Orsack said.
Orsack said that most of last year's
loss came during fall and winter quar
ter. While the service experimented
with rates during spring and summer
it lost only $100.
He said this was the result of start
up costs from opening the business.
You expect to lose money at first, he
said.
The typing service also suffered
other problems. Typists were toonice.
according to Council of Presidents
member Nancy Takahashi. She said
many of the students who used the ser
vice last year were foreigners with
poor English and that typists worked
overtime editing and correcting
grammar.
Takahashi said the service charges

bv the page but pays its typists by the
hour Last year's practices, she said,
forced the service to absorb the loss.
Takahashi said she agreed with
Davis s decision to continue the pro
gram.
We all thought that it was a useful
service and many people depend on it.
Last year was the first year and things
often don't go right the first year. Our
projects are meant to break even, not
to make money it would have been
unfair to close it down, she said.
The $90,000 loss that ASSU Special
Kvents suffered didn't affect the de
cision on the typing service. "You
can't allow losses in one area to pre
vent you from providing services in a
totally different one We could afford
to take a chance with the typing ser
vice — it's just one small chunk in the
budget." Takahashi said.
This year, there has been a large de
mand for the service. Davis reported,
"We have had problems getting a full
time typist, someone who can be in the
office all the time — consequently, we
haven't been able to match the de
mand. We have an interim typist now,
though, who is doing the job until we
find someone to take over.
Fluctuations in demand are a basic
problem for the typing service There
is little typing to be done except during
mid-terms and finals, when the ser
vice handles a large amount
"Soon we may experiment with dis
counts — maybe we'll charge less for
work done at non-peak times," Davis
said. But first we have to break even
- then we can turn around and estab
lish that kind of thing.
Or sack has plans for immediate
changes. We're getting ready to drop
the rate to $1 25 for work that we're
given a few days to complete. This will
become effective in the near future.
The price for the overnight service,
will remain at $1.50 per page," he
said.
The typing service competes for
business with many individuals both
on and off-campus, who charge vari
ous rates for their work and conve
nience The ASSU believes their ser
vice offers three advantages: conve
nience (because of its location in Tres
idder Union), the fast overnight ser
vice and quality.
"We feel that we can compete with
anyone," Davis said. "And there's a
large enough demand to keep every
one going We're not trying to put
them out of business, but we can't go
broke either All we want to do is
break even so we can keep providing
the typing service."

totally different one We could afford
to take a chance with the typing ser
vice — it's just one small chunk in the
budget." Takahashi said.
This year, there has been a large de
mand for the service. Davis reported,
"We have had problems getting a full
time typist, someone who can be in the
office all the time — consequently, we
haven't been able to match the de
mand. We have an interim typist now,
though, who is doing the job until we
find someone to take over.
Fluctuations in demand are a basic
problem for the typing service There
is little typing to be done except during
mid-terms and finals, when the ser
vice handles a large amount
"Soon we may experiment with dis
counts — maybe we'll charge less for
work done at non-peak times," Davis
said. But first we have to break even
- then we can turn around and estab
lish that kind of thing.
Or sack has plans for immediate
changes. We're getting ready to drop
the rate to $1 25 for work that we're
given a few days to complete. This will
become effective in the near future.
The price for the overnight service,
will remain at $1.50 per page," he
said.
The typing service competes for
business with many individuals both
on and off-campus, who charge vari
ous rates for their work and conve
nience The ASSU believes their ser
vice offers three advantages: conve
nience (because of its location in Tres
idder Union), the fast overnight ser
vice and quality.
"We feel that we can compete with
anyone," Davis said. "And there's a
large enough demand to keep every
one going We're not trying to put
them out of business, but we can't go
broke either All we want to do is
break even so we can keep providing
the typing service."
A revamped ASSI : Typing Service
raised its prices by 50 percent this
year in an attempt to avoid last year's
financial deficit
The basic rate increased from $1 to
$1.50 per page.
The service lost between $1800 and
$2000 last year. Because of this. ASSU
Financial Manager Steve Davis ex
plained. "We thought about not bring
ing the service back because to do so
was kind of a risky proposition But we
decided that the program had met its
major objectives last year that the
main problem had been that we
weren't charging enough.'
Mike Orsack. who took over as
project director last April, said. Last
year, we wanted to provide students
with good service at reasonable and
competitive rates — we thought that
the rate of $1 per page would be suffi
cient."
But this rate proved to be too com
petitive. We later realized that the
bulk ot our competition was charging
$1.25 to $1.75 a page, and that we'd do
well to increase our rates.'' Orsack
said The service remained open dur
ing part of the summer, and ex

perimented with prices between $1.15
and $1.25 per page.
The service closed for most of the
summer, however, because demand
was low During this period. Davisand
others evaluated the program.
Steve felt that since the program
was meeting its objectives - it was
providing a valuable service at rea
sonable rates and was close to break
ing even — that it should be eon
tiriued.' Orsack said.
Orsack said that most of last year's
loss came during fall and winter quar
ter. While the service experimented
with rates during spring and summer
it lost only $100.
He said this was the result of start
up costs from opening the business.
You expect to lose money at first, he
said.
The typing service also suffered
other problems. Typists were toonice.
according to Council of Presidents
member Nancy Takahashi. She said
many of the students who used the ser
vice last year were foreigners with
poor English and that typists worked
overtime editing and correcting
grammar.
Takahashi said the service charges

bv the page but pays its typists by the
hour Last year's practices, she said,
forced the service to absorb the loss.
Takahashi said she agreed with
Davis s decision to continue the pro
gram.
We all thought that it was a useful
service and many people depend on it.
Last year was the first year and things
often don't go right the first year. Our
projects are meant to break even, not
to make money it would have been
unfair to close it down, she said.
The $90,000 loss that ASSU Special
Kvents suffered didn't affect the de
cision on the typing service. "You
can't allow losses in one area to pre
vent you from providing services in a
totally different one We could afford
to take a chance with the typing ser
vice — it's just one small chunk in the
budget." Takahashi said.
