Energy, the envnonment and corporate responsi
bility were topics discussed last weekend by speak
ers and panelists at the "Symposium on Corporate
Environmental Decision-Making."
Prominent representatives from business, gov
ernment and public interest organizations examined
how private industry decision-makers can preserve
both the environment and economic growth.
The key speakers of the program were Robert An
derson. the Atlantic Richfield Company's board
chairman, and Hazel Henderson, an independent ad
viser to the Ford Foundation Energy Policy Project.
Anderson defined the past decade as the "environ
mental era. - ' He cited three major areas of concern
— air. water and soil — as irreplaceable resources.
It is amazing the regenerative capacity of our
natural system, if we give it a chance,' he said. But
damage to these three areas often cannot be cor
rected. he added.
Anderson called coal the only real alternative to
petroleum although it "only aggravates the situ
ation." He said, "Given the present mood of the
country, the nuclear road is not likely to be one we
will see in the near future
Anderson emphasized the need for cooperation.

"We are a nation full of single-purpose interest
groups." he said. "We can't become a nation that is
deadlocked into inaction and inactivity."
Anderson said he feels President-elect Ronald Re
agan. as an outdoorsman. is highly committed to the
environmental issue.
While Anderson saw solar energy as a supplement
to other energy sources. Henderson talked about the
dawning solar age. "
Henderson blasted private industry's efforts to
maintain old. unsustainable resources rather than
develop new alternatives She called the crisis ' sys
temic" and criticized the priority placed on im
mediate energy supply
Henderson, who called Anderson a "corporate
dinosaur." said. Many of us feel we must now call
the bluff of many of the old order."
According to Henderson, "those who live by the
monetary illusion may die by the monetary il
lusion." She pointed to corporations' "belief in end
less paper profit."
The task lies in "facing up to the unsustainabilitv
of our value systems," she said.
The centralized power of the old world system is
becoming impossible to maintain
Henderson and Anderson did. however, agree that

I he Third World is now and will continue to play an
increasing role in determining the future of world
energy.
Barbara Heller, deputy undersecretary of the De
partment of the Interior, addressed the improve
ment of government representation of the public m
terest in environmental decision-making. "The role
•if government. as I see it. is to protect people." she
said.
Corporations do not feel responsible enough, she
said Changes must come from new corporate re
sponsibility As for the president's role. Heller said,
the context for leadership is created by voters."
The role of government is to strike a balance
among the multitudes of public. She expressed con
cern with the "me-first" attitude prevalent today.
People want to develop their own states at everyone
else's expense, she said.
Government regulations and policies must be re
oriented rather than eliminated, she said. Eliminat
ing regulations would result in more money spent in
litigation and in cleaning up, she emphasized
Government regulations won't disappear over
night. ' she said. But regulations will be less neces
sary if individuals assume more responsibility.
There will be more time left for innovation." she
concluded.
