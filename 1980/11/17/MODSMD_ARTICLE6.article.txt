# Diplomat advocates 'ethical' policy
## Oil exploitation continues to strain U.S.-Mexico relations 
### Clay Moltz 
The United States should pursue an "ethical" policy
towards Mexico and its new oil wealth. U.S. diplomat Wil
liam Sullivan said here Friday.
Sullivan said it would be an "enormous" mistake for the
U.S. to attempt to exploit Mexico by inducing overproduc
tion of Mexican oil.
As the former U.S. Ambassador to Iran (1977 to 1979),
Sullivan said the events in Iran show that political
destabilizatiOn can directly result from mismanagement
of oil wealth.
Speaking before an audience of 100 persons, Sullivan
outlined problems and suggested new policies for Mexi
can-U.S. relations
Although Mexico did not sign the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs <G A T T ), Sullivan called this an
"artificial blockage" between normalizing U.S.-Mexican
trade relations He said the current trade situation is un
structured and thus "potentially unstable." But arguing
about tl A T T. membership and rules is unproductive, he
said

Illegal Mexican aliens in the U.S. also presents prob
lems for normalizing relations. Unless this problem is
solved. "We are sitting on a time-bomb that could explode
to the detriment of both nations." he said.
Sullivan denounced the "second class" treatment of
Mexicans in the U.S.. especially by American employers.
He said that the U.S. government should not treat Mexican
job-seekers as criminals and added that, in the interest of
both countries, the present quota system should be
changed Sullivan suggested a general amnesty for pres
ently illegal aliens.
The Mexican government, he said, should initiate a
close working relationship with the new Reagan adminis
tration Sullivan said Mexico has views on U.S. policy
towards such countries as Nicaragua, El Salvador.
Guatemala and Cuba, that "behooves us to take into ac
count " He said the Mexican government could gain the
Reagan administration s respect by taking the first step in
establishing close relations.
Sullivan said he hopes that once in office. President
elect Ronald Reagan's advisers will learn some "collegian
lessons that will lead them awav from some of the more

extreme statements that emanate from the Hoover In
stitution." Mexico, he said, can offer the U.S. some "spe
cial insights" into this area of the world.
Sullivan noted that the sharp divergence between the in
coming administration's views and those of the Mexican
government could be the first difficulty between the two
countries.
Sullivan chastised the U.S. education system for its neg
lect of foreign languages. Spanish, he said, should be
tairght not just in colleges and universities, but "on the
first day youngsters go to school in the United States."
Throughout his discussion of the proper course" for
American foreign policy, Sullivan alluded to its roots in
the Declaration of Independence and its ideals Sullivan
stressed the duty of the United States to pursue policies of
cooperation rather than exploitation.
Sullivan said California should take a leading role in
bringing the United States closer to Mexico, due to its
"special responsibility" as a state historically in
tertwined with Mexico.
In a brief question and answer period following the com

pletion of his 40-minute speech, Sullivan said Mexico faces
a domestic labor problem because it loses many skilled
and semi-skilled workers who emigrate to the U.S.
However, immigration could provide a "safety valve"
for Mexico's recent population explosion, he said
Sullivan said the U S. "has to be very careful not to push
too hard on Mexico when it pressures its southern neigh
bor to produce more oil
"We should rejoice that Mexico has enormous proven
resources of petroleum." he said Mexico's oil stock pro
vides the potential for the sort of economic development
which will give Mexico the type of political stability that is
important to its own ethos." Sullivan predicted
Early in his speech, Sullivan called himself a
fraudulent" speaker on Mexican-American relations. Al
though he served as U S Ambassador to Laos U964 to
1%9i. to the I'hillipines (1973 to 1977). and most recently in
Iran, he said he was never an ambassador to Mexico. How
ever. he did participate in a two-year study of Mexican-
U.S. relations in his present post as head of the American
Assembly at Columbia University
