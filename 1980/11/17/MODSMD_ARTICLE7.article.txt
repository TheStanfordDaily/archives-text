## Japan's Komei party losing strength Indictments split opposition party 
### Los Angeles Times 
Tokyo — For most of the last 20 years,
Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist laymen's group,
has enjoyed a reputation as Japan's richest,
strongest and fastest-growing religious or
ganization. a group with increasing political
influence.
Soka Gakkai, or Value-Creating Society,
had only a few followers in the period just
after World War 11. At its peak, according to
its leaders, it had 6 million, most of them
people isolated from the mainstream of so
ciety.
It established its own political party, the
Komei (Clean Government) Party, which
became the second largest opposition group
in Parliament.
And it built up chapters overseas, under
the name Nichiren Shoshu. including one in
the United States that it says has 100,000
members, many of them in Southern Cali
fornia.
Successful leadership
This success was attributed to the leader
ship of one man. Daisaku Ikeda. 52. who
served as president of the organization from
1960 to 1979. Now, as honorary president,
Ikeda is still thought to hold the reins of
power.
Idolized by members of the organization,
Ikeda has courted heads of state, political

leaders, ambassadors and scholars around
the globe. For years, he and Soka Gakkai ap
peared to be above reproach.
Now all that has changed. Soka Gakkai
finds its dirty linen being aired on a broad
scale, not only in the often-sensational
weekly magazines but in the highly re
spected daily press as well.
He is involved in three court cases and
has asked the police to investigate charges
that could result in additional court cases.
Protest rallies
Last Aug. 24. an unprecedented anti-Soka
Gakkai rally was held in Tokyo, and 201
priests who defied orders to stay away were
punished—by Nichiren leaders.
Then, on Nov. 7, about 7000 Budhists dem
onstrated in the streets, demanding that
Ikeda be summoned to Parliament to be in
terrogated on a host of charges. The demon
strators. including 500 Buddhist priests,
presented a petition to the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party urging action against
Ikeda. Twenty-three Liberal Democratic
members of Parliament showed up to ac
cept the petition.
The charges being hurled at Ikeda. all of
which Soka Gakkai denies, run the gamut
from misappropriation of Soka Gakkai
funds to womanizing to distorting Buddhist
teachings.

Respected daily newspapers that are said
to have feared that Soka Gakkai members
might start subscriber boycotts have begun
covering the controversy because of the
men who are making the accusations.
Old charges including some that involve
documented attempts to suppress publica
tion of books and articles criticizing Ikeda
and Soka Gakkai, have been resurrected.
The most prominent involves a former
prime minister, Kakuei Tanaka. when he
was secretary-general of the Liberal Demo
cratic Party in 1969.
Tanaka, now on trial on charges of accep
ting a bribe from the Lockheed Corp., tried
to persuade the author of a book critical of
Soka Gakkai to forgo publication. Tanaka's
aim was to win the political cooperation of
the Komei Party.
Already the rebellion in the ranks has
weakened the political arm of Soka Gakkai.
In an election last June 22, the Komei Party
lost 24 of the 58 seats it had held in the lower
house of Parliament.
Whatever the outcome of the court cases,
the split in the nation's largest religious or
ganization promises to hamper efforts to re
cruit new followers. It also promises to
damage the credibility of the Komei Party,
which is trying to rally the opposition
parties in a bid to overcome the Liberal
Democratic majority.

Lech Walesa, leader of the Solidarity union organization, is congratulated by supporters as he arrives
in a Warsaw theater last Monday after the Polish Supreme Court upheld an appeal by his union move
ment against changes imposed by a lower court in the union's charter. The increase in Solidarity's
strength may correspond to the rise in dissent within the Polish Communist Party.
