schemes, such as the creation of a giant veg
etable oil complex at Cumere, on the basis

The sources said that at the time of the
coup late Friday. Cabral. 50. was on the is
land of Bubaque on the Bijagos Archipelago
off the Guinea Bissau coast, where he owns
a small home. An officer reportedly asked
him to give up power and remain at the
house.
Cabral came to power when the former
Portuguese colony declared its independ
ence in 1973. Portugal granted the territory
independence in September 1974.
New constitution
The coup came in the wake of a vote in the
People's National Assembly last Monday
approving a new constitution, which was
scheduled to become effectve on Jan. 1.
This constitution envisaged bringing

about union between Bissau and the Cape
Verde Islands, which are both run by the
same political party, the Paige (The
African Party for the Independence of
Guinea Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands >
In Lisbon, an unofficial source from the
Cape Verde Islands said the islands' armed
forces was put on alert when the news of the
coup reached them
On Friday, the commanders of the two
countries' armed forces were reportedly
meeting in the Cape Verde capital of Praia,
the source added
Bissau Interior Minister Constantino
Teixeira. who is currently visiting Lisbon,
meanwhile said he had no knowledge of the
whereabouts of President Cabal.
Consolidation of power
The main reason for the overthrow of
Cabral appears to be the new consitution.
which was to have consolidated the constitu
tional powers of the president. Under the
new constitution, the chairman of the State
Council, the country's highest government
authority, was to become both head of state
and head of government
This amendment continued a trend under
which Cabral. as council chairman, was as
suming more and more power. Decisions,
which in theorv should have been made bv

its executive arm. the Council of Com
missars. were in fact being made by the
president himself
The same sources said that opposition to
the increase in the president's constitu
tional powers also stemmed from the fact
that some of his decisions were challenged
as being against the interests of the people.
For example, he had been accused of per
sonally sanctioning a number of grandiose
schemes, such as the creation of a giant veg
etable oil complex at Cumere, on the basis
of disadvantageous loans, while the life of
ordinary people became more and more dif
ficult.

Bissau. He was one of the leaders of the 14-

president and since 1978, prime minister.
