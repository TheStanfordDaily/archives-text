Warsaw, Poland (AP) — The
strikes that created communist
Poland's first independent
trade unions and forced a major
shakeup in the government ap
pear to have jarred loose a new
group of malcontents — bright,
young rank-and-file Communist
Party members seeking a
greater voice in party affairs.
Sources within the party told
The Associated Press a 'second
current'' has emerged within
lowest level party cells made up

of well-educated Poles who be
lieve in Marxist-Leninist ideol
ogy but are upset at the way the
party has managed the affairs
of the nation.
The new leadership that as
sumed power during the sum
mer strikes allowed formation
of unions independent of party
and government control and
showed a willingness to work
with the new trade organiza
tions — all the while warning
that further labor unrest would
severely damage Poland's
shortage-plagued and im
poverished economy.
Communist Party Chief
Stanislaw Kania met face-to
face for the first time Friday
with Lech Walesa, leader of the
largest independent union. Soli
darity. The Polish news agency
PAP said the two discussed "the

social and economic situation in
the country'' and quoted Kania
as saying Solidarity could be
come an important factor for
social democracy" in Poland.
Independence in party
Party sources said the yearn
ing for independence reaches
beyond the trade union move
ment and into the party struc
ture itself.
The party organization at
Warsaw Polytechnic College,
for example, announced it
would hold new elections for its
officers if the party head
quarters did not call general
party elections by the end of the
year
So far, informed sources said.
17 out of 49 regional party secre
taries have been removed, but
apparently members in other
districts also are demanding

that their local bosses step
down
Trust lost
In another example of the new
spirit, the party organization
within the propaganda agency
Interpress recently told Kania
that the "alienated" leadership
was no longer trusted by the
party rank-and-file.
The Interpress group,sources
said, strongly criticized a re
cent decision to withdraw visas
for visiting foreign reporters,-
saying it showed "a lack of uni
formity of action within the par
ty leadership."
The order, issued last Sunday
on the eve of a showdown with
Solidarity, was rescinded the
next day when the union group
called off a nationwide strike.
