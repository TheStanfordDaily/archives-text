# Graduate students travel different route

### Joan O'Connell First in a series 
Each fall a contingent of red-shirted volunteers
storm the San Francisco International Airport to
welcome, steer and befriend the incoming freshman
class. From there the new students are thrust into
an action-packed week featuring everything from
Band rallies to campus tours.
Few undergraduates forget that week, and while
they may complain of registration hassles and
roommate problems, they can t deny that they re
ceived a royal welcome to the Farm.
Another group of new students also arrives each
fall, a bit older perhaps, somewhat more serious and
not so wide-eyed. But this group, too, needs to be
come acclimated to new surroundings and to feel
part of the academic community.
Graduate students compose roughly half of the
student population here. Graduate programs in the
humanities and sciences as well as the professional
law, business and medical schools account for ap
proximately 6000 students.
Yet, according to many sources, this group faces
a host of unique problems which are not being ade
quately addressed by the University. In fact, there
exists no one overriding group or body which takes
responsibility for graduate student affairs, especial

ly in non-academic matters. "Grad student affairs
are basically no one's realm," said ASSU Council of
Presidents member Marc Ventresca.
Typical problems cited by graduate students in
clude the difficulty of finding housing, the lack of a
general orientation to the University, and the
absence of a graduate student center or active as
sociation. Students also cite personal problems such
as the stress of reentering an academic environ
ment alter a period of working and the pressures on
personal relationships which can cause isolation,
tension and marital strife.
According to a report by Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) of the Cowell Student
Health Center, graduate students seem to use CAPS
the most.
For several years, Stanford has had a Graduate
Student Association (GSA), charged to "promote
the welfare of Stanford graduate students." How
ever, the association has never really served as a
strong union here, a fact which Debbie Then, the
newly appointed graduate intern in the Office of Stu
dent Activities, is trying to turn around. Then, who
heads the GSA, said she sees "establishing strong
effective leadership in the association'' as one of her
highest priorities
One of the major aims of this effort, said Ven

tresca, is to establish an orientation program for all
graduate students. Currently, most graduate
schools run their own orientation programs The
Business School, for example, runs an orientation
program complete with housing assistance and so
cial activities which students say is very good.
"The Business School was very accommodating
as far as getting us adjusted," said business student
Tom Shannon. He said business students are advised
to arrive at least three weeks before classes start in
order to secure housing and get established in the
area.
The ASSU is also addressing issues such as hous
ing. financial aid requirements, an Approaching
Stanford handbook and a lounge fora potential grad
uate student activities center.
Craig Richards, former president of the Escon
dido Village Council, said, "there is no one main
problem" (facing graduate students), rather a
series of interrelated components caused primarily
bv the housing situation.
The sides of graduate student life here are com
plex to be sure, and as a part of a series focusing on
Stanford's graduate population, the Daily will ex
amine both the students' perspectives and feelings
and also how the University and student groups are
addressing the matter.

effective leadership in the association'' as one of her
highest priorities
One of the major aims of this effort, said Ven

tresca, is to establish an orientation program for all
graduate students. Currently, most graduate
schools run their own orientation programs The
Business School, for example, runs an orientation
program complete with housing assistance and so
cial activities which students say is very good.
"The Business School was very accommodating
as far as getting us adjusted," said business student
Tom Shannon. He said business students are advised
to arrive at least three weeks before classes start in
order to secure housing and get established in the
area.
The ASSU is also addressing issues such as hous
ing. financial aid requirements, an Approaching
Stanford handbook and a lounge fora potential grad
uate student activities center.
Craig Richards, former president of the Escon
dido Village Council, said, "there is no one main
problem" (facing graduate students), rather a
series of interrelated components caused primarily
bv the housing situation.
The sides of graduate student life here are com
plex to be sure, and as a part of a series focusing on
Stanford's graduate population, the Daily will ex
amine both the students' perspectives and feelings
and also how the University and student groups are
addressing the matter.
