Two important, but frequent
ly overlooked parts of an auto
mobile are the cooling system
and the battery The cooling sys
tem and the battery, when oper
ating properly, keep the engine
working the way the manufac
turer intended. Both, if over
looked. can cause unnecessary
surprises that can cause break
downs in very inopportune
places. A few minutes of ob
servation everv month will in-

sure that a breakdown will not
occur.
The battery stores the car's
electrical power. For the bat
tery to operate efficiently, the
battery terminals, or posts, and
the cable ends must be free of
corrosion. A simple wire brush
can be purchased for about $1.50
that cleans the terminals and
posts.
Some of the newer "main
tenance free" batteries have
cables that attach to the side of
the battery, rather than on top.
as other batteries do. These

newer batteries only need to be
brushed off occasionally, be
cause the battery acid has less
chance of splashing on the side
of the batteries than on the top.
It is the conventional, top
mounted terminals that cause
the most trouble.
To clean the top-mounted ter
minals. follow these pro
cedures:
1) Remove the cables with a
wrench. Remove the negative
cable first to avoid potential
electric shock. If the cables are
extremely hard to remove,

purchase a battery terminal
puller, which costs about $4.
2) Brush both the cables and
the terminals (posts) with the
battery brush
3) Attach the cables Be sure
to attach the positive cable first
to avoid potential electric
shock.
4i Coat the terminals and
cable ends with petroleum jelly
or spray them with a special
battery terminal spray, which
costs about $1.50
Another important part of

battery maintenance is the wa
ter level This does not apply to
the new maintenance free bat
teries The water level on older
batteries can be checked and ad
justed very simply. It is very
important to remember that
batteries contain sulfuric acid
Always wear safety goggles and
work gloves and never smoke
when working on a battery
If the acid gets on your hand
or eye, flush with water im
mediately If it gets in your eye.
a doctor shold be consulted im
mediately to avoid possible
long-term damage. The fumes
released from a battery are
very flammable, hence a flame
of any kind could cause the bat
tery to explode, sending plastic
fragments and dangerous bat
tery acid in all directions.
To check the water level,
carefully remove the caps on
top of the battery. The water
should reach to the bottom of
the tubes you are looking in. The
plates, which are visible
through the holes, should be cov
ered with water.
If there is insufficient water,
add distilled water to the proper
level. While the caps are off. you
might want to check your bat
tery's efficiency using a battery
hydrometer, costing $1.50. In
structions for use are on the
package.
The cooling system keeps the
engine from overheating as well
as from freezing in very cold
weather.
It is important to remember
that the cooling system is pres
surized. and that removal of the

radiator cap when the engine is
warm can cause the coolant to
vaporize and spray in all direc
tions. causing severe burns.
Always allow the car to cool
down before working on the ra
diator.
If the radiator is too hot to
touch, don't even consider open
ing the cap When you do open
the cap.use a rag. so that if any
coolant starts spraying, the rag
will absorb it and you can jump
back out of the way quick
enough to avoid getting burned
An anti-freeze hydrometer,
costing $1.50, should be
purchased to check the density
of the coolant. Instructions are
provided on the package. If the
hydrometer indicates that there
is insufficient boil-over protec
tion. simply add some anti
freeze and check the readings
after the engine has been used
and the newly added anti-freeze
has had time to mix thoroughly.
The level of the coolant should
be at the level marked under the
hood. Some cars have plastic ov
erflow bottles, which are trans
parent and will have the FULL
marking right on them Other
cars have a FULL mark en
graved on the radiator itself,
and you have to remove the cap
and see if the coolant is up to the
mark. If not. add some coolant
to the proper level Coolant is a
mix of anti-freeze and water,
according to the climate of your
area. See your owner's manual
for details.
The radiator cap should be in
spected to see if the rubber seal

is intact and is not drying out If
the rubber seal is damaged, the
radiator will not hold the proper
pressure and the car will "boil
over.' Replace the cap with one
of a proper pressure. Also, while
the hood is open, check the rub
ber hoses and belts, looking for
signs of wear or leaks. Hoses
and belts are difficult to replace
if you have never seen the pro
cedure done before. Take the
car to a mechanic and watch
what he does. After watching
the mechanic, you will probably
be able to do it yourself next
time At least by spotting a worn
fan belt or a brittle hose you will
have avoided a breakdown on
the road through preventive
maintenance.
If the coolant appears brown
or rust colored, or has many sol
id particles in it.it is undoubted
ly time to flush the system. The
best and easiest method is to
buy a "Flush and Fill kit,'
which sells for about $3 This kit
installs permanently in the car
and makes future flushing even
easier. Follow the directions on
the kit. and add the anti-freeze
and water in the proper ratio.
You will be able to see the dirty,
rusty coolant completely re
placed by clean coolant. Keep
ing the coolant in top condition

not clog with rust.
Keeping the cooling system
and battery in proper working
order will help your car run bet
ter aÂ»well as save you money by
helping you avoid expenses such
as purchase of a new battery or
a new radiator.

Two important, but frequent
ly overlooked parts of an auto
mobile are the cooling system
and the battery The cooling sys
tem and the battery, when oper
ating properly, keep the engine
working the way the manufac
turer intended. Both, if over
looked. can cause unnecessary
surprises that can cause break
downs in very inopportune
places. A few minutes of ob
servation everv month will in-

sure that a breakdown will not
occur.
The battery stores the car's
electrical power. For the bat
tery to operate efficiently, the
battery terminals, or posts, and
the cable ends must be free of
corrosion. A simple wire brush
can be purchased for about $1.50
that cleans the terminals and
posts.
Some of the newer "main
tenance free" batteries have
cables that attach to the side of
the battery, rather than on top.
as other batteries do. These

newer batteries only need to be
brushed off occasionally, be
cause the battery acid has less
chance of splashing on the side
of the batteries than on the top.
It is the conventional, top
mounted terminals that cause
the most trouble.
To clean the top-mounted ter
minals. follow these pro
cedures:
1) Remove the cables with a
wrench. Remove the negative
cable first to avoid potential
electric shock. If the cables are
extremely hard to remove,

purchase a battery terminal
puller, which costs about $4.
2) Brush both the cables and
the terminals (posts) with the
battery brush
3) Attach the cables Be sure
to attach the positive cable first
to avoid potential electric
shock.
4i Coat the terminals and
cable ends with petroleum jelly
or spray them with a special
battery terminal spray, which
costs about $1.50
Another important part of

battery maintenance is the wa
ter level This does not apply to
the new maintenance free bat
teries The water level on older
batteries can be checked and ad
justed very simply. It is very
important to remember that
batteries contain sulfuric acid

work gloves and never smoke
when working on a battery
If the acid gets on your hand
or eye, flush with water im

a doctor shold be consulted im
mediately to avoid possible
long-term damage. The fumes
released from a battery are
very flammable, hence a flame
of any kind could cause the bat
tery to explode, sending plastic
fragments and dangerous bat
tery acid in all directions.
To check the water level,
carefully remove the caps on
top of the battery. The water
should reach to the bottom of
the tubes you are looking in. The
plates, which are visible
through the holes, should be cov
ered with water.
If there is insufficient water,
add distilled water to the proper
level. While the caps are off. you
might want to check your bat
tery's efficiency using a battery
hydrometer, costing $1.50. In
structions for use are on the
package.
The cooling system keeps the
engine from overheating as well
as from freezing in very cold
weather.
It is important to remember
that the cooling system is pres
surized. and that removal of the

radiator cap when the engine is
warm can cause the coolant to
vaporize and spray in all direc
tions. causing severe burns.
Always allow the car to cool
down before working on the ra
diator.
If the radiator is too hot to
touch, don't even consider open
ing the cap When you do open
the cap.use a rag. so that if any
coolant starts spraying, the rag
will absorb it and you can jump
back out of the way quick
enough to avoid getting burned
An anti-freeze hydrometer,
costing $1.50, should be
purchased to check the density
of the coolant. Instructions are
provided on the package. If the
hydrometer indicates that there
is insufficient boil-over protec
tion. simply add some anti
freeze and check the readings
after the engine has been used
and the newly added anti-freeze
has had time to mix thoroughly.
The level of the coolant should
be at the level marked under the
hood. Some cars have plastic ov
erflow bottles, which are trans
parent and will have the FULL
marking right on them Other
cars have a FULL mark en
graved on the radiator itself,
and you have to remove the cap
and see if the coolant is up to the
mark. If not. add some coolant
to the proper level Coolant is a
mix of anti-freeze and water,
according to the climate of your
area. See your owner's manual
for details.
The radiator cap should be in
spected to see if the rubber seal

is intact and is not drying out If
the rubber seal is damaged, the
radiator will not hold the proper
pressure and the car will "boil
over.' Replace the cap with one
of a proper pressure. Also, while
the hood is open, check the rub
ber hoses and belts, looking for
signs of wear or leaks. Hoses
and belts are difficult to replace
if you have never seen the pro
cedure done before. Take the
car to a mechanic and watch
what he does. After watching
the mechanic, you will probably
be able to do it yourself next
time At least by spotting a worn
fan belt or a brittle hose you will
have avoided a breakdown on
the road through preventive
maintenance.
If the coolant appears brown
or rust colored, or has many sol
id particles in it.it is undoubted
