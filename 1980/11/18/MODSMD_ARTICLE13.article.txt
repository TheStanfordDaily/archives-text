# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Robert Greenberg He hoped to be an affable donkey 
### 
Once upon a time there was a
very nice donkey named Jim
my. He was a good donkey; he
always tpied to make those
around him happy, and at
tempted to better himself each
and every day. Jimmy tried to
be like ail the other donkeys in
the Zoo. He was always careful
not to make jokes about the size
of bird beaks in public, always
treated brown bears as equals
despite pressure from some of
his friends in the southern part
of the Zoo. and never made the
mistake of talking to any of the
hateful, greedy elephants in
public. He wouid even form his
opinions and part his hair on the
same side as his colleagues, just
to realize his goal — to be a well
liked donkey.
But Jimmy wasn't really like
his other slow-moving friends.
Because of his obsession to be
well-liked, he had trouble under
standing the issues of the
animal kingdom, and as a re
sult. never could make de
cisions. Besides that, he had
thick, fleshy lips that often
caused him to say the wrong
things at the wrong times.
Luckily, he also had a huge,
brimming smile that he exposed
on those jumbled occasions, in
an attempt to make up for his
mistakes. (Thus, the term
"Grin and bear it.") Somehow,
someway, this amnesia-provok
ing smile and seemingly sincere
way helped Jimmy along his
path to success.
A strange sequence of events
spurred Jimmy's rise in the Zoo.
Since the great war, all the
donkeys and elephants had been
extremely wary of what the oth
er side was doing. All sorts of in
sects evolved to "listen" to the
enemy. One year, the donkeys
decided, in a desperation move,
to expose this process that had
been going on for years. All of
the cages shook when the naive
animals found out — the Zoo was
in disarray.
Jimmy decided to capitalize
on this pachvdermic mistake.
During a period where the
animals weren't quite sure who
they could trust, Jimmy
emerged as a basic donkey that
truly had all four feet on the
ground, it wasn't long after that
Jimmy the Donkey was elected
Leader of the Zoo.
Jimmy the Donkey was very
pleased to be Leader of the Zoo.
He promised never to lie to the
other animals, and that he
would make sure all of the
animals had good jobs that
would allow them to earn
enough Zoo tokens to live well.
He promised to balance the Zoo
budget and to keep the yearly in
crease in .the cost of Zoo tokens
to a minimum. He also prom
ised to bring back a solid moral
concept among animals, based
on honesty, sincerity and trust.
It wasn't long before Jimmy
realized that it was impractical
to believe that a donkey could do
all these things. This made Jim
my very sad. The animals in the
Zoo Congress wouldn't listen to
Jimmy. In fact, they overrode
his veto twice, even though most
of the Congress-animals were
donkevs. ITie Zoo started to

split: donkey against donkey,
elephant against donkey, and all
the other zoos in the world
laughed at the problems Jim
my's once powerful Zoo was
having.
Jimmy had trouble deciding
how to relate to animals in other
zoos. One month, he would talk
of peace and brotherhood; the
next, he would approve the sale
of millions of dart guns and
Uranium stones to the animals
in the East. One day, he would
talk of world-wide "animal
rights," the next, he would de
fend established dictators and
tyrants, allowing them into the
Zoo for safety.
He couldn't decide what to do
about arming his own zoo,
either. He fought the B-l
Uranium stone dropper, but was
in favor of the cruising Uranium
missiles and shuttle bombs. No
one could ever predict what
Jimmy the Donkey would do
next.
All of the animals in the Zoo
were getting upset with Jim
my's mistakes — their cages
were getting colder and colder
each winter, and Zoo tokens
were losing their worth each
day. Jimmy's wavering on Zoo
token policy had caused the
token to erode in worth in every
zoo in the world, causing what
was once the leading zoo to be
come the second or third best.
The future of the Zoo looked
more and more dismal as days
passed.
About halfway through Jim
my's term as Leader of the Zoo.
the animals started to think
about who should be their next
leader. Jimmy, now a "much
more experienced" donkey, by
his own account, rose to the oc
casion and said he wanted to try
again. Some of the other
donkeys, seeing that Jimmy
was having problems, argued
that a different donkey should
run for Leader of the Zoo.
Teddy the Donkey decided to
challenge Jimmy's status as
head ass. Despite his dogged ef
forts. he proved to be no match
for Jimmy on the campaign
trail. Teddy was never able to
swim past Jimmy's political
clout, as he had trouble treading
water in the turbulent political
seas Jimmy created. Through a
careful progression of Tuesday
morning animal press con
ferences and a spending spree
tour, going cage to cage with
billion token improvement pro
grams, Jimmy "whipped Ted
dy's ass." pushing him over the
bridge and thereby securing the
donkey nomination,
During all this time, the
elephants watched with smiles
under their trunks at the
divisive donkey actions. Jimmy
the Donkey had left a scattered
trail of political peanuts during
his tenure, and the elephants
were now eager to go after this
new food.
Ready to take control of the
Zoo, they picked their oldest and
wisest member, Ronald to lead
them to the White Cage. Ronald
the Elephant was delighted to
be chosen — he believed he
could make the Zoo great again.
Ronald campaigned long and

hard on a platform bragging less
government and more prosper
ity. Little by little, the animals
in the Zoo started to listen to
Ronald's words.
All of this scared Jimmy the
Donkey. Paranoid that the
animals might not re-elect him.
he did everything in his power to
silence the pounding of the
elephant herds as they neared
the White Cage But like most of
his previous actions, the result
was inevitably bungled.
When he attempted to create
an image of a strong leader, ad
vocating military might, he
leaked the development of the
Zoo's special radar-evading
planes, an action that gave oth
er zoos a chance to step even
further ahead in the Uranium
stone race. Jimmy the Donkey
spoke of how Ronald the
Elephant would split the Zoo
into pieces, while he was doing
exactly that.
As the token rate spiraled out
of sight, and animals were los
ing their jobs, things began to
get worse for Jimmy the
Donkey. His brother, Billy
Donkey, was chosen at random
for a beer loan from an enemy
zoo. an action that caused all the

animals to wonder and question
Jimmy's once-pure sense of mo
rality.
Despite these errors. Jimmy
continued to fight on in his quest
to remain Leader. He debated
and spoke all over the Zoo about
what he was trying to do. defen
ding his own actions.
All of his effort turned out to
be in vain. When the election
finally came, it proved to be a
donkey disaster. Elephants
stomped through the Zoo. and
the donkeys were crushed under
the weight of the political move
ment.
At first, Jimmy the Donkey
was very sad. But then, when he
started to think ahead, he felt
lucky that he would now be able
to do things that all ex-Leaders
do, like walk along beaches in
Bermuda shorts with a geiger
counter, and play golf in Palm
Cage Springs.
These thoughts brought Jim
my's famous smile to his lips,
and he was happy again. Anti
Ronald the Elephant made the
Zoo great again, and everyone
lived happily ever after.
