## Sweeping bitterness displayed 
### 
I would like to address myself to Blake Brown
and Kent Allen, co-authors of the article. "The
Big Con Stanford's childish game'' (Daily, Nov.
13).I found this article to be little more than a long
rendition of a tedious cliche describing the fatal
facade of the Stanford student and the entire Uni
versity as a whole While I cannot argue that one
will find a completely warm and authentic at
mosphere on this campus. I do think that the case
presented in this article was exaggerated to the
point of being ridiculous
The authors accuse White Plaza relationships
of being "big cons"; these quick hello-goodbve
conversations are supposedly nothing more than
an exercise in game playing. I would like to ask
Brown and Allen a question.
Debbie was in my freshman dorm. I have not
had any contact with her in over two years. I have
just bumped into her in White Plaza. What do you
expect me to say'.' "Oh hello, let's get heavy." Or
do you think that I should just walk by her without
saying anything at all?
I am the first person to admit that by the 100 th
time I am sick and tired of telling someone about
my summer vacation. However, I think that chit
chat plays a vital role in communication between
human beings: it allows a person to be pleasant
with very little effort, and in today's world there
is a lot to be said for pleasantness.
Furthermore, often the 100 th person who asks
about my vacation is truly interested.
It seems as though the authors are guilty of one
of the academic offenses that they describe as
products of Stanford's liberal arts education.
They talk to hear their own voices. How else can
one explain the exaggerated extreme to which
they carry their arguments?
"Without a brew in his or her hand (at a party),
the Stanford student is incapable of nurturing his
or her fragile ego." "At football games, count the
average number of hi's given by any good-looking
girl or guy." "Women talk about diets, and men
talk about great parties and wild times with wine,
women and song." experiences that are almost
always fabricated.

Certainly, at any university in the country we
can find people who fit into the cliches illustrated
above. We can also find people who don't and this
is a fact that Brown and Allen fail to recognize.
There are many people, who. like the authors,
find that the social scene at Stanford can be both
artificial and disappointing. However, many of
these people, myself included, have decided that
with a little effort this barrier of artificiality can
be broken
It is easy to write an article like " The Big Con. "
It is not as easy to admit that often the facade that
is the root of this con is only a facade, and it is up
to the individual to find out what is underneath
There are a lot of parties whose successes are not
due to alcohol consumption. There are many peo
ple who really do share healthy friendships with
some of their peers.
1 cannot end before commenting on the authors'
remarks about academics. Again, we see the
same mistake: they take one aspect of the situ
ation and decide that it is representative of the en
tire system. Of course there are students who are
overly competitive and obnoxiously ostentatious.
But there are even more students who are not.
The students in the latter category are the stu
dents who comment in class because they think
that they have something interesting to say. They
are the students who find study groups productive
and who take the chance by writing tests and pa
pers that are not paraphrased regurgitations of
professors' words.
Cynicism, to a degree, is healthy for it is only
with a certain amount of cynicism that we can
ever develop a realistic optimism. However, in
discriminate bitterness, such as that displayed
throughout Brown and Allen's article, is not only
uncalled for. but also counter-productive.
Very few people would claim that Stanford has
little room for growth, both socially and
academically. Unfortunately, though, the un
reasonable self-righteous extent to which the au
thors carry their point undermines the entire va
lidity of their argument.
