## Is our source of inner strength threatened? 
### 
Agriculture in the United
States is so efficient that most
of us needn't give it a thought; it
is taken for granted. Never
theless, it is one of the most
critical elements of our econo
my, and is not so invulnerable
that we can afford to ignore it.
At the heart of all economies
lies one activity: the production
of food. A human society cannot
survive without a reasonably
stable and efficient agriculture.
The more efficient agriculture
becomes in terms of yield per
unit cultivated land and per unit
labor, the more diversified the
economy (and society) can be
come. The labor saved can be in
vested in other productive ac
tivities.
By the 19205, the United
States had progressed tremen
dously in its agricultural effi
ciency. Flows and animal power
were replaced by tractors and
other machinery. Migration to
the cities occurred in response
to industrial growth and an ex
panding job market. Roughly 30
percent of the population was
engaged in the production of
food.
By 1977, the character of
American agriculture had
changed drastically. Only 4
percent of the population was
active in agricultural prod
uction: yet. yields were so high
that huge surpluses existed. In
response to this excess prod
uctive capacity, the U.S. gov
ernment supports farm prices.
This policy has the dual bene
fit of keeping farmers in busi
ness and maintaining a surplus
for export. Today, the U.S. is the
world's largest exporter of food.
In a period of industrial decline,
agriculture has remained a re
liable source of strength.
Furthermore, the potential to
expand production is substan
tial.
The importance of a healthy
agricultural system in this

country cannot be overem
phasized. Its efficiency is the
cornerstone of our highly diver
sified economy. Its productive
capacity makes the U.S. the
heart of the world food econo
my, which greatly enhances our
ability to influence events
abroad. However, the vitality of
American agriculture is being
threatened.
The tremendous efficiency of
American agriculture owes to
the substitution of fossil energy
and mechanization for human
and animal labor, the develop
ment of high-yield varieties of
grain (the Green Revolution)
and the widespread use of
petrochemical fertilizers and
pesticides. The rising price of
petroleum and its increasingly
tenuous availability is one of the
main threats to U.S. agricul
ture.
Petroleum and petroleum
products are crucial elements
of all phases of agricultural
production. Petroleum fuels the
machinery which the farmer
uses to work his land, runs the
transportation systems which
move grains from farm to mar
ket. and is the key ingredient in
the fertilizers and pesticides
which Green Revolution grains
require.
As the price of oil rises, the
productivity of the American
agricultural system will be
markedly reduced. Moreover,
as our dependency on foreign oil
increases, the productivity of
American agriculture will like
wise become dependent on for
eign resources.
More alarming than the oil
threat is the problem of erosion.
Topsoil, a complex mixture of
minerals and organic debris,
forms very slowly. Food crops
derive the nutrients which sus
tain them from the topsoil.
Prior to the advent of heavy
fertilization, the productivity of
land was primarily determined

bv the quality of the topsoil. To
day. much land that was con
sidered marginal is highly prod
uctive due to the use of
fertilizer.
Certain crops, such as corn
and soybeans, are very taxing to
the soil. Not only do they deplete
nutrients rapidly, they are
grown in rows which leave most
of the soil exposed to wind and
rain, the agents of erosion.
Erosion of topsoil is proceeding
at a very rapid rate in much of
the U.S.. partly due to farming
practices and partly due to the
economics of farming.
The capital investment in
land and machinery has grown
to the point that a standard
sized farm of 360 acres repre
sents a million-dollar invest
ment. In order to maintain their
investment, farmers are com
pelled to grow the crops which
bring the highest prices: corn
and soybeans. Thus, the prob
lem o: erosion is exacerbated.
Moreover, crops are grown
continuously, not allowing for a
fallow period during which the
soil will naturally replenish
itself. This in turn increases the
reliance on fertilizers to main
tain the productivity of the soil.
The loss of fertility resulting
from the erosion of topsoil has
been masked by the use of
fertilizers. In the long-term,
however, this loss will become
critical.
Agriculture in the U.S.. as
practiced today, is oriented
toward short-term goals.
Farmers are concerned with
protecting their investment and
are compelled to produce crops
which tend to deplete the soil.
Economic pressure also re
duces the incentive for farmers
to take topsoil conservation
measures. Should present prac
tices continue, the soil will be
come irreversibly depleted
within 20 years, and the
fertilizers used to fortify it will

be expensive and/or un
available. Even now. many
trained observers fear that con
ditions are ripe for another Dust
Bowl.
There are means available to
avoid crisis. It is essential that
action be taken immediately to
begin the process of reform. The
government should act to ma
nipulate the economic incen
tives affecting farmers, as well

as to instigate an aggressive soil
conservation program. Inaction
cannot be tolerated considering
the stakes Both the Mesopota
mian and Mavan civilizations
crumbled in the wake of agricul
tural collapse.

More alarming than the oil
threat is the problem of erosion.
Topsoil, a complex mixture of
minerals and organic debris,
forms very slowly. Food crops
derive the nutrients which sus
tain them from the topsoil.
Prior to the advent of heavy
fertilization, the productivity of
land was primarily determined

bv the quality of the topsoil. To
day. much land that was con
sidered marginal is highly prod
uctive due to the use of
fertilizer.
Certain crops, such as corn
and soybeans, are very taxing to
the soil. Not only do they deplete
nutrients rapidly, they are
grown in rows which leave most
of the soil exposed to wind and
rain, the agents of erosion.
Erosion of topsoil is proceeding
at a very rapid rate in much of
the U.S.. partly due to farming
practices and partly due to the
economics of farming.
The capital investment in
land and machinery has grown
to the point that a standard
sized farm of 360 acres repre
sents a million-dollar invest
ment. In order to maintain their
investment, farmers are com
pelled to grow the crops which
bring the highest prices: corn
and soybeans. Thus, the prob
lem o: erosion is exacerbated.
Moreover, crops are grown
continuously, not allowing for a
fallow period during which the
soil will naturally replenish
itself. This in turn increases the
reliance on fertilizers to main
tain the productivity of the soil.
The loss of fertility resulting
from the erosion of topsoil has
been masked by the use of
fertilizers. In the long-term,
however, this loss will become
critical.
Agriculture in the U.S.. as
practiced today, is oriented
toward short-term goals.
Farmers are concerned with
protecting their investment and
are compelled to produce crops
which tend to deplete the soil.
Economic pressure also re
duces the incentive for farmers
to take topsoil conservation
measures. Should present prac

come irreversibly depleted
within 20 years, and the
fertilizers used to fortify it will

be expensive and/or un
available. Even now. many

Agriculture in the United
States is so efficient that most
of us needn't give it a thought; it
is taken for granted. Never
theless, it is one of the most
critical elements of our econo
my, and is not so invulnerable
that we can afford to ignore it.
At the heart of all economies
lies one activity: the production
of food. A human society cannot
survive without a reasonably
stable and efficient agriculture.
The more efficient agriculture
becomes in terms of yield per
unit cultivated land and per unit
labor, the more diversified the
economy (and society) can be
come. The labor saved can be in
vested in other productive ac
tivities.
By the 19205, the United
States had progressed tremen
dously in its agricultural effi
ciency. Flows and animal power
were replaced by tractors and
other machinery. Migration to
the cities occurred in response
to industrial growth and an ex
panding job market. Roughly 30
percent of the population was
engaged in the production of
food.
By 1977, the character of
American agriculture had
changed drastically. Only 4
percent of the population was
active in agricultural prod
uction: yet. yields were so high
that huge surpluses existed. In
response to this excess prod
uctive capacity, the U.S. gov
ernment supports farm prices.
This policy has the dual bene
fit of keeping farmers in busi
ness and maintaining a surplus
for export. Today, the U.S. is the
world's largest exporter of food.
In a period of industrial decline,
agriculture has remained a re
liable source of strength.
Furthermore, the potential to
expand production is substan
tial.
The importance of a healthy
agricultural system in this

country cannot be overem
phasized. Its efficiency is the
cornerstone of our highly diver
sified economy. Its productive
capacity makes the U.S. the
heart of the world food econo
my, which greatly enhances our
ability to influence events
abroad. However, the vitality of
American agriculture is being
threatened.
The tremendous efficiency of
American agriculture owes to
the substitution of fossil energy
and mechanization for human
and animal labor, the develop
ment of high-yield varieties of
grain (the Green Revolution)
and the widespread use of
petrochemical fertilizers and
pesticides. The rising price of
petroleum and its increasingly
tenuous availability is one of the
main threats to U.S. agricul
ture.
Petroleum and petroleum
products are crucial elements
of all phases of agricultural
production. Petroleum fuels the
machinery which the farmer
uses to work his land, runs the
transportation systems which
move grains from farm to mar
ket. and is the key ingredient in
the fertilizers and pesticides
which Green Revolution grains
require.
As the price of oil rises, the
productivity of the American
agricultural system will be
markedly reduced. Moreover,
as our dependency on foreign oil
increases, the productivity of
American agriculture will like
wise become dependent on for
eign resources.
