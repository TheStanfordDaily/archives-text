Don't walk alone
I am a woman. I am angry and
1 am scared. Someone is impos
ing on my freedom and I've nev
er felt such hatred in my life.
How dare he?
B]verything is fine until about
5 p.m. Then, like other women. I
start to feel a sense of anxiety.
How will I get home? Which way
has the most traffic and the best
lighting? Who is going in the
same direction?
After the age of seven, we're
proud of our new independence.
Mommy doesn't have to hold
our hands while crossing the
street anymore. Now. however,
our lives are dominated by that
constant nagging thought, once
it starts getting dark.
Having read about the recent
rape on campus, a famous ad

vertisement came into my
head: "Just when you thought it
was safe to go back into the wa
ter." Just when you thought it
was safe to walk alone.
This is a plea to other women
on campus. Don't be deluded by
the setting in which we're liv
ing. Don't be embarrassed to
call SURE or a guy at your
house to walk you home. Please.

I was proud of the Stanford
team at their game with USC in
spite of the adverse conditions
under which they played.
The adverse conditions about
which I speak were not the USC
football team, but the Stanford
students and alumni. They sat
dead on their butts when they
should have been cheering.
The only time I heard a cheer
emit from the Stanford sup
porters was as the result of a
success or a penalty against the
opposition. The latter I might
add is poor sportsmanship.
Your team not only has to be
lieve you are behind them; they
have to feel and hear you behind
them.
I sincerely think if the
cheerleaders would learn
cheers such as "Push em back,
Harder, Harder" or "Hold that
Line" at the time and in the face
of the adversity we may have
won instead of lost.
What do you think the score
would have been if the team had
16ft the stadium in the third and
fourth quarter as too many Stan
ford students did?
The team is getting their
heads battered in; the least the
students can do to contribute is
to donate their lungs and larynx,
and maybe even a little spirit.
