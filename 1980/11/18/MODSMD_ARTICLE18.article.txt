## Comedy Cafe Split sides and busted guts 
### Bruce Handy 
In some ways, too much good
comedy is a harder thing to en
dure than even a modicum of
bad comedy. To watch some
poor goon flailing away about at
his old neighborhood ("My old
neighborhood was so angst-rid
den that . . ."> can at least be
morbidly fascinating: how
much longer can he keep it up?
what kind of a childhood, how
ever wretched, could prompt a
man to subject himself to such
abuse? does he know he's stink
ing the place up'.' And if the ten
sion becomes too much, one can
always talk to one's date, or
smoke a cigarette, or leave.
But the horrors of a large dose
of truly funny comedians: our
eyes can't leave the stage and
each successive laugh stretches
the diaphragm into an ever
tightening drumhead intensity
so that soon enough your
laughter sounds like a beatnik
pad replete with bongos and tu
berculean efforts at respiration
To see a person literally split his
side laughing is one of the
grosser sights known to man
kind.
The paramedics then were
truly busy Saturday night dur
ing and after Student Arts at
Stanford's (STARTS) Comedy
Cafe which was held at the Cof
fee House. God knows how long
it took the weary Coffee House
employees to clean up the
