# Everyman coming
## 
### 
Very few plavs have charac
ters like Kindred. Intellect,
Good Deeds and Five Wits (not
a Chinese soup). Certainly Neil
Simon, although he often deals
with everyday suburban lives of
average suburban people, never
wrote a play with Everyman as
the featured role. Are we deal
ing with some avant-garde prod
uction where the actors perform
in garbage cans and the lines are
spoken in Tagalog?
No.
On December 1 through 5, the
Company, heroes of last year's
Jesus Christ Superstar and this
year's fantastic <4 Midsummer
Night's Dream, will be pres
enting Everyman, a 15th cen
tury morality play that many
may have read in Medieval Lit
survey classes.
Morality plays, very popular
in their day, were essentially
vehicles that instructed their
audiences in how to act — ac
cording to the doctrines of the
15th century church, of course.
God. who appears in the play
along with Five Wits, et al., dis
patches Death to fetch Every
man up to Paradise, where the
Heavenly Hosts are presumably

having quite a party. At any
rate. Everyman is not too sure
about this, tries to hold on to his
worldly possessions (Goods,
Beauty) but in the end realizes
what's "sooth" and what's not
in the Medieval scheme of
things.
And it's not at all as boring as
one might think at first thought.
The author of the play, the pro
lific Anonymous, had a flair for
both the dramatic and the com
ic, although these plays were
taken extremely seriously in
their time. As director Tom
Engelman says, the play will be
produced "in such a way that
people can see how the drama
was originally done — and have
an exciting theatrical ex
perience as well." Appropriate
ly the play will be produced in
Memorial Church and will fea
ture Medieval songs and
melodies scored by Music Pro
fessor William Mahrt.
Scott Leland will play Every
man. God will be portrayed by
Kevin Hearle, and Fred Bender
has the thankless role of Death.
Tickets, available at the Tres
idder Ticket Office and in White
Plaza, are $1.
