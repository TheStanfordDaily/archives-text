# Students hindered without language proficiency
## 
### Neil MacFarquhar First of two parts 
Berkeley has one. Harvard has one.
So does Columbia.
In fact, according to Assoc. Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, head of the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies (CUS),
Stanford may be the only leading U.S.
university that has no language re
quirement.
This, combined with recent
statistics showing that only one-third
to one-fourth of students here enroll in
foreign language courses, has
prompted the CUS to search for ways
to encourage language study.
Declining foreign language en
rollment here appears to be part of a
nationwide trend. The Modern Lan
guage Association of America (MLA),
in its most recent published three
year study, reports a continual decline
in the total number of hours of univer
sity foreign language courses from
1974 to 1977.
The Presidential Commission on
Foreign Languages last year called
the country's incompetence in lan

guages "scandalous." Its report
deplored what it called an "epidemic
elimination of language require
ments" and urged reinstatement of
such requirements and other interna
tional education programs.
There is increasing concern that
Americans will not be able to compete
in international business and that
diplomacy suffers, according to Hoy
Chustek of the MLA. For example, he
said, of the 60 diplomats in the Tehran
embassy at the time of its seizure one
year ago, fewer than five spoke Farsi,
the main Iranian language.
Stanford dropped its University
wide language requirement in 1969,
when many rigid academic programs
were eliminated. Today, aside from
language departments, only nine de
partments have language require
ments for graduation. One of them,
the history department, permits stu
dents to fulfill the requirement with
computer science courses.
Many University officials and facul
ty members have argued in favor of
foreign language study, but most also

have expressed reservations about re
instating the requirement.
Lougee said the study of languages
is important for its value in interna
tional trade and diplomacy and be
cause it is "an indispensable element
of a liberal arts education."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon, recognizing that the means
to encourage language study is a con
troversial issue, said he believes "a
liberal arts education ought to consist
of a working knowledge of at least one
foreign language."
Dr. Clara Bush. Special Language
Program coordinator, argues for a
language requirement because "part
of our gravest difficulties stem from
our lack of knowledge of the rest of the
world."
And Prof. Robert Keohane, chair
man of the political science depart
ment. said any step towards encourag
ing languages would be a positive one
as "Americans are generally much
too provincial and language is an en
tree to learning more about other cul
tures."

The CUS determined that the fac
tors which contribute to low en
rollment in foreign language courses
include a low esteem for foreign lan
guage study in the United States, poor
preparation in high schools and little
incentive at Stanford to study lan
guages.
First and second year language
courses were initially accepted for
fulfilling the humanities requirement
under the 1977 distribution system.
Later they were removed from the hu
manities category because they did
not contain enough literature.
When the distribution requirements
were revised this year, language
courses were not included for the
same reason â€” not enough literature
or linguistics. Introductory Slavic,
however, does meet the requirement
because it includes linguistic study.
In general, said Lougee, languages
are eliminated because they are con
sidered "not intellectually com
parable to other courses in the univer
sity."
