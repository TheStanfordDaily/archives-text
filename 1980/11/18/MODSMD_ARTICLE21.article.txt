# Rockpile running out

### Bruce Handy 
You'd think that by now all
the catchy pop songs that could
he written would have been
written Maybe someday some
beatific bard will write some
three chord dittie, any three
chord dittie. and suddenly musi
cians will go the way of black
smiths and alchemists This is.
in fact, a distinct possibility.
Consider: there are only so
many notes, right? So there
must be only so many ways to
arrange said notes And. as mu
sicians have been writing music
for what can now be con
servatively called a long time, it
does not take a great leap of im
agination to realize that we may
soon be approaching the deple
tion of our song reserves.
Conservation is of the es
sence Perhaps if all the Green
peacers, anti-nukers, pro
choicers, and pro-lifers (it's a
matter of life or choice?) could
be diverted from their relative
ly trivial interests, the music in
dustry could be forced into a
moratorium, or at the least a
slowdown, on song production.
p'ortunately, at least for the
ignorant insatiable consumer,
there are many extremely clev

er musicians out there doinp
their best at exploration and de
velopment And perhaps two of
the cleverest of these musicians
are Nick Lowe and Dave Ed
munds.
These two, healthily in mid
dleage judging from the cover of
their new album, have been
around for quite a while, moving
from the British pup circuit in
the mid-'6os to quasi-stardom
with their band Rockpile. While
both have been members of this
four piece band for some time,
until now they have released
separate albums and gone on
separate tours as either Nick
Lowe and Rockpile or Dave Ed
munds and Rockpile performing
either one or the other's songs.
Seconds of Pleasure is the first
strictly-Rockpile album.
That the album comes with an
EH of Everlv Brothers covers
should be a clue to what the
album contains: sliding, wailing
vocals and that thin plucky kind
of guitar playing that is usually
only heard on KFRC's Golden
Weekends. The boys do some
covers of period songs including
Chuck Berry's "Oh What a
Thrill," and another by Joe Tex.
but as promised by the long pre

amble to this review, there are
plenty of originals, and catchy
ones at that
What's odd is that this co
laboration with songs written in
the main by Lowe actually
sounds more like an Edmunds
album. Missing are the slick,
almost syrupy pop tunes of
Lowe's two previous albums
and instead we've been treated
to the Edmunds' brand of rock
a-billy and early '60s pop
Lowe has always written
goofy songs, like a tribute to an
old Hollywood star who died in
her apartment and then was
gobbled by her starving
Dachshund: "She was a winner
that became the doggie's din
ner." But Sounds of Pleasure
finds Lowe with a pared-down
writing style that replaces
goofiness with pure dumbness.
In a genre that, keep in mind, in
cludes the Ramones and the
B-52's, no one is as dumb as
Lowe and Rockpile.
To keep the superlatives at a
minimum, suffice it to say that
Seconds of Pleasure is dumb as
shit. Yet to quote from Cheech
and Chong. shit can indeed be
"great" and only the good die
dumb.
