# Jim Carroll acts up
## 
### Peter Finch 
One would generally assume that making
the change from award-winning author and
poet to hard-driving rock and roller would be
tough. And the result would probably be much
like the results of most of the rockers who've
tried their hand at acting (i.e., miserable).
But New York's Jim Carroll, author of the
acclaimed Basketball Diaries and Living at
the Movies, is now the leader of his own band.
And if his debut album, entitled Catholic Boy,
is any indication. Carroll's career as a musi
cian should far surpass the cinematic careers
of his contemporaries.
Catholic Boy rocks. I suppose you could call
it New Wave, for lack of anything better, but
this is really the music of the streets.For the
most part it's simple, bass and drums-oriented
rock and roll. Brian Linsley and Terrell Winn
play slicing guitars that seem to encircle and
accentuate Carroll's vocals. Occasionally Car
roll throws in a piano (used masterfully on
"Day and Night" and"I Want the Angel" ) or a
saxopohone. but mostly it's just the basics:
guitars, bass, drums and Carroll's voice.
But don't be misled. This is not an album of
1970 s doldrum rock. It's full of catchy,
eminently danceable. syncopated rhythms. No
long, boring solos here. The band plays tight,
relatively short songs. And they all sound great
at maximum volume. Carroll, who at times
sounds like any combination of Lou Reed.
Graham Parker. Bob Dylan and Tom Petty,
doesn't actually sing, per se. More accurately,
he "talks" his songs.
But there are few people who can talk with
Carroll's seeming conviction. His voice, like
his lyrics, conveys more emotion than most
genuine singers. You can sense, at times, that

he really has been through the trials and tribu
lations his songs are about. When, in "People
Who Died,'' Carroll laments the death of his
friend Kddie. you're compelled to believe that
there really is an Eddie and that perhaps he did
just get "slit in the jugular vein."
The album's 10 songs, all of which were writ
ten at least in part by Carroll, convey their au
thor's urgency best throught their lyrics.
These songs, in the tradition (and the approx
imate words) of Bruce Springsteen, are about
the opera on the turnpike and the ballet being
fought out on the alley. They're songs about life
and death (one of Carroll's favorite themes) on
the street and in the seedy tenements of Ameri
ca's ghettos.
Carroll's biggest problem on the album is re
petitiveness. Specifically, a couple of the songs
double back on their lyrics when it seems that
it might have been better to just add a couple
more verses.
But for a musical unknown like Carroll, the
album seems to be doing very well. It's sin
gle."People Who Died."(which seems to be
either loved or hated by most who hear it) is
getting a lot of Bay Area airplay.
Catholic Boy's success is due in part to the
build up Carroll was given this summer in Roll
ing Stone. Newsweek and other magazines and
papers. And Carroll also has some very famous
iriends. Namely Keith Richards, who was
scheduled to produce the album but had to
withdraw when the Rolling Stones' Emotional
Rcscue was being delayed.
This is not to overlook the fact that Carroll
has indeed made an excellent debut album. It
will be interesting to see where he goes from
here. Who knows, maybe he could try a career
in the movies.

in the movies.
One would generally assume that making
the change from award-winning author and
poet to hard-driving rock and roller would be
tough. And the result would probably be much
like the results of most of the rockers who've
tried their hand at acting (i.e., miserable).
But New York's Jim Carroll, author of the
acclaimed Basketball Diaries and Living at
the Movies, is now the leader of his own band.
And if his debut album, entitled Catholic Boy,
is any indication. Carroll's career as a musi
cian should far surpass the cinematic careers
of his contemporaries.
Catholic Boy rocks. I suppose you could call
it New Wave, for lack of anything better, but
this is really the music of the streets.For the
most part it's simple, bass and drums-oriented
rock and roll. Brian Linsley and Terrell Winn
play slicing guitars that seem to encircle and
accentuate Carroll's vocals. Occasionally Car
roll throws in a piano (used masterfully on
"Day and Night" and"I Want the Angel" ) or a
saxopohone. but mostly it's just the basics:
guitars, bass, drums and Carroll's voice.
But don't be misled. This is not an album of
1970 s doldrum rock. It's full of catchy,
eminently danceable. syncopated rhythms. No
long, boring solos here. The band plays tight,
relatively short songs. And they all sound great
at maximum volume. Carroll, who at times
sounds like any combination of Lou Reed.
Graham Parker. Bob Dylan and Tom Petty,
doesn't actually sing, per se. More accurately,
he "talks" his songs.
But there are few people who can talk with
Carroll's seeming conviction. His voice, like
his lyrics, conveys more emotion than most
genuine singers. You can sense, at times, that

he really has been through the trials and tribu
lations his songs are about. When, in "People
Who Died,'' Carroll laments the death of his
friend Kddie. you're compelled to believe that
there really is an Eddie and that perhaps he did
just get "slit in the jugular vein."
The album's 10 songs, all of which were writ
ten at least in part by Carroll, convey their au
thor's urgency best throught their lyrics.
These songs, in the tradition (and the approx
imate words) of Bruce Springsteen, are about
the opera on the turnpike and the ballet being
fought out on the alley. They're songs about life
and death (one of Carroll's favorite themes) on
the street and in the seedy tenements of Ameri
ca's ghettos.
Carroll's biggest problem on the album is re
petitiveness. Specifically, a couple of the songs
double back on their lyrics when it seems that
it might have been better to just add a couple
more verses.
But for a musical unknown like Carroll, the
album seems to be doing very well. It's sin
gle."People Who Died."(which seems to be
either loved or hated by most who hear it) is
getting a lot of Bay Area airplay.
Catholic Boy's success is due in part to the
build up Carroll was given this summer in Roll
ing Stone. Newsweek and other magazines and
papers. And Carroll also has some very famous
iriends. Namely Keith Richards, who was
scheduled to produce the album but had to
withdraw when the Rolling Stones' Emotional
Rcscue was being delayed.
This is not to overlook the fact that Carroll
has indeed made an excellent debut album. It
will be interesting to see where he goes from
here. Who knows, maybe he could try a career
in the movies.
