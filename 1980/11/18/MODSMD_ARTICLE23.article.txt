# Symphony celebrates Isaac Stern
## 
### Mary Loeffelholz 
Isaac Stern celebrated his
45th year as a performer last
week when he returned to San
Francisco, the site of his or
chestra debut in 1936, to play
four classics of the violin reper
toire with the San Francisco
Symphony.
Friday's program began with
Stravinsky's Greeting Include,
played in honor of composer
Aaron Copeland's 80th birthday,
and in anticipation of Isaac
Stern's 60th. The Greeting Prel
ude is nothing more or less than
a two-minute long canonic
treatment of Happy Birthday.
In Stravinsky's hands, it sounds
like the theme music to a Na
tional Geographic television
special — brassy, uplifting and
very brief.
In further honor of Aaron
Copeland's birthday, the Sym
phony performed his Short
Symphony, composed in 1932-33
and given its first performance
in Mexico City in 1934. The
Short Symphony is seldom
heard in concert, being more
often passed over in favor of
Copeland's familiar pro
gramatic works. The San Fran
cisco Symphony for the most
part coped well with the techni
cal difficulties of the piece, par
ticularly with its metrical com
plexity. The first violin section
was only loosely coordinated.
unfo r tunatelv. on some of the

first movement's exposed pas
sages. The acoustics of Davies
Hall were unkind to the upper
strings and showed the lower
strings and woodwinds to much
better advantage.at least as the
hall was tuned Friday night. In
the second movement, the hall's
acoustics complemented
Copeland's scoring, as cellos,
violas and woodwinds carried
the lyric melody. The third
movement returned to lively
rhythms and metrical vari
ation, more adroitly handled
this time by the first violins,
particularly in the col legno pas
sages.
The first half of Friday's pro
gram was interesting but slight;
the audience and the orchestra
both seemed eager to move on to
the two works featuring Isaac
Stern. Stern played both the
Mozart Violin Concerto No. 3
and the Brahms Violin Concerto
from memory, sometimes bend
ing over as if to talk to the con
certmaster. at other times lean
ing past Edo deWaart on the
podium to catch the eye of the
first cellist. His tempos in the
Mozart were energetic but un
rushed. Stern played his own
cadenzas, of which the first was
especially interesting, entirely
double-stopped and romantic in
feeling. In the third movement
Stern overreached himself
slightly, flawing his tone on the
forte entrance to the country

dance, but his reading of the
concerto was by and large re
strained.
In the Brahms concerto, how
ever. Stern took more risks,
with mixed results. The opening
movement, after a meditative
orchestral introduction, breaks
into urgently repeated figures in
the strings. At the entrance of
the soloist the orchestra sub
sides into sustained chords, and
the solo violin gathers up all the
orchestra's tension, then sub
limates it into a calmly con
trolled. singing theme. Stern
managed the transition with im
peccable authority.
The woodwinds's opening in
the Adagio movement was a
show-stealer. as it has been
since the Brahms concerto's
first performance. After the or
chestra's precision and control
in the opening, Stern's tone
seemed slightly overdone, his

shifting at times greasy. In the
final movement Stern again ov
erreached himself, as he had in
the Mozart. The forte entrances
were frequently harshly
sounded, the bowing not under
the gracious control Stern com
manded in the previous move
ments. The Brahms concerto
was nonetheless the high point
of the program, both in terms of
magnitude and execution, and
was warmly received by the au
dience. The house rose to a
standing ovation as Stern re
turned for his curtain calls, and
the orchestra — the most dif
ficult audience for any soloist —
joined in the enthusiastic ap
plause.
The Symphony's program No
vember 19 through November 23
features Isaac Stern in the
Mozart Violin Concerto No. 4
and the Tchaikovsky Violin
Concerto.
