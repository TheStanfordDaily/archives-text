Iran claims Iraqis repulsed
Baghdad, Iraq — Iran claimed its forces threw back the
Iraqi invaders of Susangerd on yesterday, driving them
into retreat with a wave of tank-led reinforcements and
helicopter gunships after three days of intense fighting for
the Iranian border town Claims of enemy casualties there
from both sides totalled more than 1300 in 48 hours
A Baghdad military command communique did not
mention withdrawal, instead claiming successful heli
copter and fighter raids on Iranian installations at Sus
angerd Farlier it claimed heavy damage against Iranian
land and naval forces there.
Tehran radio said more than 200 Iraqis were killed yes
terday in addition to 650 the day before. Baghdad earlier
claimed 511 Iranian dead in two days There was no way to
confirm the figures. Tehran radio said the Iranians suf
fered tens of martyrs" and Iraq said it lost 34 men yester
day in Susangerd.
Fears that the two-month-old war between Iran and Iraq
would spread to other oil nations on the Persian Gulf
mounted with Kuwait's formal protest to Iran over the
second aerial rocket attack in five days on an Kuwaiti
border post.
Prime rate soars to six-month high
New York — Most American banks raised their prime
lending rate to 16.25 percent yesterday, a three-quarters of
a percentage point rise that took the key rate to its highest
level since mid-May.
The increase, linked to the Federal Reserve's latest
credit-tightening moves, could signal higher interest rates
for consumers in coming weeks
And some Wall Street analysts said the nearly 34-
month-long round of prime rate increases was not finished
yet.
"The prime rate's going to have to go higher." perhaps
as high as 17 percent, by "late in the week or early next

week," said economist Bob Sinche at the brokerage house
of Bear. Stearns & Co
Yesterday's increases followed last Friday's announce
ment by the Federal Reserve of a full-point increase to 12
percent in its discount rate, the rate it sets on direct loans
to banks, and a 2 percent surcharge on the discount rate for
some large borrowers.
The Fed acted to slow a rapid money-growth rate that
could touch off a new wave of inflation in coming months.
The central bank's actions resulted in increased business
borrowing rates because they raised the banks' own costs
of acquiring funds.
Rates on consumer loans and home mortgages are not
tied to the prune. But the business loan rate's movements
reflect money-market conditions that eventually can af
fect the cost or availability of loans to consumers.
Reagan to meet with Carter, others
Washington — President-elect Ronald Reagan was
flying to Washington yesterday for a week of meetings, in
cluding a face-to-face session with President Jimmy
Carter, discussions with congressional leaders and a tour
of his new home — the White House.
Reagan cautioned that he did not expect to make over
night changes as president, adding that he will have no
control over the federal budget until his inauguration.
The president-elect's schedule in Washington this week
includes two national security briefings, a visit with
Carter at the White House on Thursday, five separate
meetings with congressional leaders and several sessions
with political supporters and aides.
LA fires still burn, but winds easing
Los Angeles — Some of the fires that burned almost
50.000 acres of brushland and damaged or destroyed about
100 homes in Southern California surged out of control for a
second day yesterday, but firefighters got a break when
the hurricane-force winds calmed down.

At the height of the weekend fire siege, which left one
man dead, firefighters stood by almost helpless as winds
gusting up to HO mph sent flames racing through bone-dry
brush, trees and rooftops
The most destructive of the blazes still was burning out
of control yesterday, a day after it destroyed 49 homes and
damaged 27 others for a total loss of at least $25 million in
the exclusive Bradburv-Duarte area about 20 miles north
east of downtown Los Angeles.
Kire officials yesterday downgraded the estimate of the
acreage destroyed in that blaze from 12,000 acres to 6168
acres and said the flames were headed north towards the
Angeles National Forest, away from residential areas.
High Court extends religious curbs
Washington — The Supreme Court on yesterday out
lawed the posting of the Ten Commandments on classroom
walls in public schools.
By a 5-4 vote, the nation's highest court struck down a
Kentucky law that required such postings. The court's nar
row majority said in an unsigned opinion that the law vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom.
The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Com
mandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in na
ture.' the court said in reversing a Kentucky Supreme
Court ruling.
Under the 1968 law. no tax money could be spent for the
posted copies. Private donations were called for.
In other matters yesterday, the court took these ac
tions:
Ruled that the Long Island, N.Y., town of South
ampton. and by extension all other communities na
tionwide with similar ordinances, cannot ban door-to-door
solicitation by Unification Church members.
— Told Alaska officials they must wait, at least for a few
months, before distributing to state residents some $130
million in state revenue dividends. The distribution plan is
under constitutional attack.
Women stage protest at Pentagon
Washington — An estimated 1300 women staged a dem
onstration yesterday at the Pentagon, saying they were
protesting the arms race, militarism and violence against
women.
The Defense Department press office said about 100

people were arrested for trying to block entrances to the
building The protest was part of a morning-long demon
stration that began at daybreak at nearby Arlington Na
tional Cemetery.
The protest then moved to the Pentagon with partici
pants carrying signs and banners with slogans such as
"Stop The Arms Race" and "No Nukes."
The demonstration was planned by women from the
New England Conference on Women and Life On Earth,
according to a spokeswoman, Ynestra King. She said
about 30 women's groups, primarily from Northeastern
states, joined the demonstration
"This is a peace demonstration," King said. "We
wanted to make the link between militarism and violence
against women We see the military consciousness as part
of a macho, masculine consciousness — lack of respect for
life, for people, for nature We see that as the same con
sciousness that brings rape and brutality."
Stock trading heavy, volatile
New York — The stock market, absorbing news of
higher interest rates and credit tightening moves by the
Federal Reserve, closed mixed yesterday in volatile trad
ing.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped
more than 11 points soon alter the market opened but man
aged to recover almost all of that by the close.
Trading remained active yesterday at 50.26 million
shares but was down from Friday's unusually heavy 71.63
million turnover.
Weather
Fair and mild through tomorrow with cool nights and af
ternoon haze Lows in the 40s and low 50s and highs in the
60s. Winds will be light.

of control yesterday, a day after it destroyed 49 homes and
damaged 27 others for a total loss of at least $25 million in
the exclusive Bradburv-Duarte area about 20 miles north

High Court extends religious curbs
Washington — The Supreme Court on yesterday out
lawed the posting of the Ten Commandments on classroom
walls in public schools.
By a 5-4 vote, the nation's highest court struck down a
Kentucky law that required such postings. The court's nar
row majority said in an unsigned opinion that the law vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom.
The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Com
mandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in na
ture.' the court said in reversing a Kentucky Supreme
Court ruling.
Under the 1968 law. no tax money could be spent for the
posted copies. Private donations were called for.
In other matters yesterday, the court took these ac
tions:
Ruled that the Long Island, N.Y., town of South
ampton. and by extension all other communities na
tionwide with similar ordinances, cannot ban door-to-door
solicitation by Unification Church members.
— Told Alaska officials they must wait, at least for a few
months, before distributing to state residents some $130
million in state revenue dividends. The distribution plan is
under constitutional attack.
Women stage protest at Pentagon
Washington — An estimated 1300 women staged a dem

women.
The Defense Department press office said about 100

people were arrested for trying to block entrances to the
building The protest was part of a morning-long demon
stration that began at daybreak at nearby Arlington Na
tional Cemetery.
The protest then moved to the Pentagon with partici
pants carrying signs and banners with slogans such as
"Stop The Arms Race" and "No Nukes."
The demonstration was planned by women from the
New England Conference on Women and Life On Earth,
according to a spokeswoman, Ynestra King. She said
about 30 women's groups, primarily from Northeastern
states, joined the demonstration
"This is a peace demonstration," King said. "We
wanted to make the link between militarism and violence
against women We see the military consciousness as part
of a macho, masculine consciousness — lack of respect for
life, for people, for nature We see that as the same con
sciousness that brings rape and brutality."

Iran claims Iraqis repulsed
Baghdad, Iraq — Iran claimed its forces threw back the
Iraqi invaders of Susangerd on yesterday, driving them
into retreat with a wave of tank-led reinforcements and
helicopter gunships after three days of intense fighting for
the Iranian border town Claims of enemy casualties there
from both sides totalled more than 1300 in 48 hours
A Baghdad military command communique did not
mention withdrawal, instead claiming successful heli
copter and fighter raids on Iranian installations at Sus
angerd Farlier it claimed heavy damage against Iranian
land and naval forces there.
Tehran radio said more than 200 Iraqis were killed yes
terday in addition to 650 the day before. Baghdad earlier
claimed 511 Iranian dead in two days There was no way to
confirm the figures. Tehran radio said the Iranians suf
fered tens of martyrs" and Iraq said it lost 34 men yester
day in Susangerd.
Fears that the two-month-old war between Iran and Iraq
would spread to other oil nations on the Persian Gulf
mounted with Kuwait's formal protest to Iran over the
second aerial rocket attack in five days on an Kuwaiti
border post.
Prime rate soars to six-month high
New York — Most American banks raised their prime
lending rate to 16.25 percent yesterday, a three-quarters of
a percentage point rise that took the key rate to its highest
level since mid-May.
The increase, linked to the Federal Reserve's latest
credit-tightening moves, could signal higher interest rates
for consumers in coming weeks
And some Wall Street analysts said the nearly 34-
month-long round of prime rate increases was not finished
yet.
"The prime rate's going to have to go higher." perhaps
as high as 17 percent, by "late in the week or early next

week," said economist Bob Sinche at the brokerage house
of Bear. Stearns & Co
Yesterday's increases followed last Friday's announce
ment by the Federal Reserve of a full-point increase to 12
percent in its discount rate, the rate it sets on direct loans
to banks, and a 2 percent surcharge on the discount rate for
some large borrowers.
The Fed acted to slow a rapid money-growth rate that
could touch off a new wave of inflation in coming months.
The central bank's actions resulted in increased business
borrowing rates because they raised the banks' own costs
of acquiring funds.
Rates on consumer loans and home mortgages are not
tied to the prune. But the business loan rate's movements
reflect money-market conditions that eventually can af
fect the cost or availability of loans to consumers.
Reagan to meet with Carter, others
Washington — President-elect Ronald Reagan was
flying to Washington yesterday for a week of meetings, in

Reagan cautioned that he did not expect to make over
night changes as president, adding that he will have no
control over the federal budget until his inauguration.
The president-elect's schedule in Washington this week
includes two national security briefings, a visit with
Carter at the White House on Thursday, five separate
meetings with congressional leaders and several sessions

LA fires still burn, but winds easing
Los Angeles — Some of the fires that burned almost

the hurricane-force winds calmed down.

At the height of the weekend fire siege, which left one

Prime rate soars to six-month high
New York — Most American banks raised their prime
lending rate to 16.25 percent yesterday, a three-quarters of
a percentage point rise that took the key rate to its highest
level since mid-May.
The increase, linked to the Federal Reserve's latest
credit-tightening moves, could signal higher interest rates
for consumers in coming weeks
And some Wall Street analysts said the nearly 34-
month-long round of prime rate increases was not finished
yet.
"The prime rate's going to have to go higher." perhaps
as high as 17 percent, by "late in the week or early next

week," said economist Bob Sinche at the brokerage house
of Bear. Stearns & Co
Yesterday's increases followed last Friday's announce
ment by the Federal Reserve of a full-point increase to 12
percent in its discount rate, the rate it sets on direct loans
to banks, and a 2 percent surcharge on the discount rate for
some large borrowers.
The Fed acted to slow a rapid money-growth rate that
could touch off a new wave of inflation in coming months.
The central bank's actions resulted in increased business
borrowing rates because they raised the banks' own costs
of acquiring funds.
Rates on consumer loans and home mortgages are not
tied to the prune. But the business loan rate's movements
reflect money-market conditions that eventually can af
fect the cost or availability of loans to consumers.

LA fires still burn, but winds easing
Los Angeles — Some of the fires that burned almost
50.000 acres of brushland and damaged or destroyed about
100 homes in Southern California surged out of control for a
second day yesterday, but firefighters got a break when
the hurricane-force winds calmed down.

At the height of the weekend fire siege, which left one
man dead, firefighters stood by almost helpless as winds
gusting up to HO mph sent flames racing through bone-dry
brush, trees and rooftops
The most destructive of the blazes still was burning out
of control yesterday, a day after it destroyed 49 homes and
damaged 27 others for a total loss of at least $25 million in
the exclusive Bradburv-Duarte area about 20 miles north
east of downtown Los Angeles.
Kire officials yesterday downgraded the estimate of the
acreage destroyed in that blaze from 12,000 acres to 6168
acres and said the flames were headed north towards the
Angeles National Forest, away from residential areas.
High Court extends religious curbs
Washington — The Supreme Court on yesterday out
lawed the posting of the Ten Commandments on classroom
walls in public schools.
By a 5-4 vote, the nation's highest court struck down a
Kentucky law that required such postings. The court's nar
row majority said in an unsigned opinion that the law vio
lated the Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom.
The pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Com
mandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in na
ture.' the court said in reversing a Kentucky Supreme
Court ruling.
Under the 1968 law. no tax money could be spent for the
posted copies. Private donations were called for.
In other matters yesterday, the court took these ac
tions:
Ruled that the Long Island, N.Y., town of South
ampton. and by extension all other communities na
tionwide with similar ordinances, cannot ban door-to-door
solicitation by Unification Church members.

months, before distributing to state residents some $130
million in state revenue dividends. The distribution plan is
under constitutional attack.

pants carrying signs and banners with slogans such as
"Stop The Arms Race" and "No Nukes."

New England Conference on Women and Life On Earth,
according to a spokeswoman, Ynestra King. She said

states, joined the demonstration

sciousness that brings rape and brutality."
