The items auctioned ranged from

ceed by former 49'ers quarterback
John Brodie
"The auction was geared to the
family. said Linda Meier, who
chaired the auction. "We wanted to
promote a healthy, outdoor image."
All of the items were donations and
included athletic equipment, an
tiques. cars, clothes, travel packages
and Stanford memorabilia.
A week of low-altitude balloon
flying and wine tasting in the French
countryside was one of the many
unique opportunities offered. This
travel package included two first

class round trip tickets to Paris and
went tor over $20,000. Other sought-af
ter items were a membership to the
Stanford Golf Course which sold for
$16,000 and an entry into the Crosby
Pro-Am Golf Tournament which sold
for $12,000.
Due to NCAA regulations the club
was unable to actually sell John
Elwav's shirt but a jersey bearing his
number — 7 — sold for $1800.
Other items of interest were an old
San Francisco Chronicle delivery
truck, an Arabian horse and a rental
car which changes with the seasons.
Members of the Cardinal Club were
delighted by the number of well
known personalities who donated their
time such as Willie McCovev. who of
fered to spend a day at Candlestick
Park with a family. Henrv Winkler of
fered a personal tour of Paramount
Studios. A backpacking trip with Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo Parki and
lunch at the U.S. Capitol with Sen
Mark Hatfield (R-Oregon) were
among other contributions.

women's sports. The two-year-old
club, raised $210,000 last year for
women's sports. Its goal this year is to
raise $300,000.
iNancv Dietz, head of the Cardinal
Club, emphasized the need to earn
even more than this amount since it is

which went to women's athletic schol
arships last year — was taken from
the Department of Athletic s reserve
fund. This year 71 women are receiv
