# Energy speaker paints bleak picture

The international oil market has
just about broken down because of the
uncertain political situation in the
Middle East, according to Charles Eb
inger of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
The former vice-president of Con
ant & Assoc.. an international energy
consulting firm, painted a bleak pic
ture of the world's energy situation to
a small audience in Terman
Auditorium yesterday.
The government and leading finan
cial institututions are taking an un
realistic and dangerous "business as
usual" attitude toward U.S. depen
dence on Mideast oil. he said, and this
dependence has become much too dan
gerous for U.S. national security.
The United States is simply un
prepared for any major disruption of
oil flow, according to Ebinger. The
current strategic reserve gives the
country "a breathing space" of nine to
eleven days and the current record
levels of stockpiled oil will buy some
more time. If a disruption of oil prod
uction occurs as it did in 1979, it will be
"a much graver crisis." he said.
The fall of the late shah in Iran has
not only meant the downfall of a major
U.S. ally, said Ebinger. but also a
sharp decrease in Iranian oil prod
uction by four million barrels per day.
The Iran-Iraq war has resulted in a

further reduction of three million bar
rels a day, he added.
Some producers, like Saudi Arabia,
have increased production to fill the
gap, Ebinger said, but many pro
ducers are diverting their sales to the
spot market making prices much
more volatile and planning much
more difficult. While the oil com
panies have been treated as
scapegoats, according to Ebinger,
their control over oil production has
been diminishing
"Oil producers have learned from
the past, " Ebinger said, and they
have made their contracts more re
strictive. This and the emergence of
state-owned oil companies have re
sulted in a free-for-all competition
which has pushed up spot market
prices, he said. Prices that in 1978
were around $12 per barrel are now as
high as $37 on the international spot
market, according to Ebinger.
High prices will hurt less developed
countries the most, he said, and may
even cause some of them to default on
their loans, which would "generate
ripples through the international
banking system."
"In the wake of the Iran-Iraq war
we can no longer rely on OPEC prod
uction to meet our needs," Ebinger
continued. But, he said, given the fact
of U.S. dependence, the nation must

take a more realistic view of politics
in the Middle East as the western Eu
ropean allies have.
Ebinger said the United States has
taken several stands which has alien
ated "moderate" OPEC members
such as Saudi Arabia. He said the
freezing of Iran's assets has made
America's Arab "friends" reconsider
their investment policies, in fear that
their investments could be used to
hold them hostage.
The proposed sale of arms to Iran
"would be a cardinal error" according
to Ebinger, given the support of Iraq
in the Arab world.
Ebinger also called for a more "bal
anced" view of the Palestinian ques
tion rather than "unequivocal support
of Israel."
Ebinger believes decontrol of oil
has been a positive step because drill
ing has increased to record levels. But
he pointed out that the reserve-prod
uction ratio continues to decline.
"What is lost in the debate is how
much we would have to discover each
year in order to keep up with demand.
At least four billion barrels a year
would have to be discovered over the
decade but in the previous we have
never found more then three billion in
any year. It is like having to find a
north slope of Alaska every six
months," said Ebinger.

eleven days and the current record
levels of stockpiled oil will buy some
more time. If a disruption of oil prod
uction occurs as it did in 1979, it will be
"a much graver crisis." he said.
The fall of the late shah in Iran has
not only meant the downfall of a major
U.S. ally, said Ebinger. but also a
sharp decrease in Iranian oil prod
uction by four million barrels per day.
The Iran-Iraq war has resulted in a

further reduction of three million bar
rels a day, he added.
Some producers, like Saudi Arabia,
have increased production to fill the
gap, Ebinger said, but many pro
ducers are diverting their sales to the
spot market making prices much
more volatile and planning much
more difficult. While the oil com
panies have been treated as
scapegoats, according to Ebinger,
their control over oil production has
been diminishing
"Oil producers have learned from
the past, " Ebinger said, and they
have made their contracts more re
strictive. This and the emergence of
state-owned oil companies have re
sulted in a free-for-all competition
which has pushed up spot market
prices, he said. Prices that in 1978
were around $12 per barrel are now as
high as $37 on the international spot
market, according to Ebinger.
High prices will hurt less developed
countries the most, he said, and may
even cause some of them to default on
their loans, which would "generate
ripples through the international
banking system."
"In the wake of the Iran-Iraq war
we can no longer rely on OPEC prod
uction to meet our needs," Ebinger
continued. But, he said, given the fact
of U.S. dependence, the nation must

take a more realistic view of politics
in the Middle East as the western Eu
ropean allies have.
Ebinger said the United States has
taken several stands which has alien
ated "moderate" OPEC members
such as Saudi Arabia. He said the
freezing of Iran's assets has made
America's Arab "friends" reconsider
their investment policies, in fear that
their investments could be used to
hold them hostage.
The proposed sale of arms to Iran
"would be a cardinal error" according
to Ebinger, given the support of Iraq
in the Arab world.
Ebinger also called for a more "bal
anced" view of the Palestinian ques
tion rather than "unequivocal support
of Israel."
Ebinger believes decontrol of oil
has been a positive step because drill
ing has increased to record levels. But
he pointed out that the reserve-prod
uction ratio continues to decline.
"What is lost in the debate is how
much we would have to discover each
year in order to keep up with demand.
At least four billion barrels a year
would have to be discovered over the
decade but in the previous we have
never found more then three billion in
any year. It is like having to find a
north slope of Alaska every six
months," said Ebinger.
The international oil market has
just about broken down because of the
uncertain political situation in the
Middle East, according to Charles Eb
inger of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.
The former vice-president of Con
ant & Assoc.. an international energy
consulting firm, painted a bleak pic
ture of the world's energy situation to
a small audience in Terman
Auditorium yesterday.
The government and leading finan
cial institututions are taking an un
realistic and dangerous "business as
usual" attitude toward U.S. depen
dence on Mideast oil. he said, and this
dependence has become much too dan
gerous for U.S. national security.
The United States is simply un
prepared for any major disruption of
oil flow, according to Ebinger. The
current strategic reserve gives the
country "a breathing space" of nine to
eleven days and the current record
levels of stockpiled oil will buy some
more time. If a disruption of oil prod
uction occurs as it did in 1979, it will be
"a much graver crisis." he said.
