# Clericals refused University recognition; appeal to NLRB
## 
### Bill Beyda 
The Office Staff Organizing Com
mittee last Friday filed more than
1 000 signatures with the National La
bor Relations Board (NLRB) in Oak
land, seeking the right to represent
2000 clerical workers.
The petition was filed just one day
after the University refused to recog
nize OSOC as a collective bargaining
unit, telling the committee it should
follow normal NLRB procedures.
Citing U.S. Supreme Court de
cisions and NLRB rules. University
Staff Counsel Priscilla Wheeler said
the University would not recognize
OSOC until a secret ballot election de
termines whether the union would
have majority support.
According to OSOC. the majority of
workers signed cards in favor of form
ing a collective bargaining unit within

the United Stanford Employees
(USE), which is Local 715 of the Ser
vice Employees International Union.
AFL-dO. USE now represents 1 400
technical, maintenance and service
workers.
'Showing of interest'
NLRB procedures require the union
to have authorization cards from 30
percent of those in the proposed
bargaining unit as a "showing of in
terest.
Had the University examined even
a few of the cards, it could have
opened the way for union recognition,
according to NLRB rules.
If the NLRB confirms the signa
tures. a decision will have to be
reached on the makeup of the bargain
ing unit, or the "appropriate unit."
Another question is whether the work
ers have a "community of interest"
even though they work in different
parts of the University.
Momentum up
"The process could take a year and
a half." said OSOC chairperson Joyce
Tipps-Coates. "The University knows
our momentum is up. Their strategy is
to drag things out. as long as possible."
she added.
One of the problems facing the of
fice workers on campus, at the Medi
cal School and the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center is their pay. Current

ly. they have no one to represent them
and. according to Tipps-Coates, each
employee is dependent on his or her
supervisor for pay increases. There is
no standard pay scale for all Univer
sity employees
The OSOC has been preparing to
petition for union recognition for 15
months. It began in June 1979 and
gained widespread attention at a rally
held in August 1979 which drew over
300 people
Lower wages
The OSOC has been discussing
many issues with the clerical workers,
95 percent of whom are women. The
OSOC claims that the University
clericals are paid much less than their
counterparts in industry and local gov
ernment and other institutions. They
also earn hundreds of dollars less per
month than their unionized coun
terparts at the University, according
to OSOC.
Last year OSOC acted in an unof
ficial capacity when it solved five or
six grievances through University
procedures.
The group is now examining other
issues such as retirement funds, medi
cal benefits, child care, promotion op
portunities. working conditions, flex
ible hours and health and safety stan
dards.
