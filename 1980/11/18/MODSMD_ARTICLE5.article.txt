# Good, better, best: Will diploma honors be next?

Unlike many universities which
confer honors on their graduates using
three levels of distinction. Stanford
uses just one level of general distinc
tion.
That's a fact which Dean of Ad
missions Fred Hargadon. among oth
ers. would like to see changed.
In determining gradations of gradu
ation honors as well as the percentage
of honors recipients, Stanford policy
differs sharply from other schools.
Just less than 25 percent of Stanford
graduates receive a Bachelor's
Degree with Distinction, compared
with half or more of each graduating
class at many Ivy League Schools.
At Harvard. Yale and Princeton,
graduates are accorded honors based
largely on grade point average, with
the highest ranking students receiving
highest honors sum ma cum laude hon
ors. followed by high honors magna
cum laude and honors cum laude.
The system here has not always
been University policy. Hargadon and
others have called for an overhaul.
Disservice
He suggested that by not recog
nizing finer levels of achievement
Stanford may be performing a dis
service to deserving students.
"There are a small number of stu
dents each year who epitomize, by the
breadth and depth of their academic
accomplishments, the ideal of the lib
erally educated student at Stanford,
the equivalent of a scholar in resi
dence. Although we have students who
win departmental honors and Phi Beta
Kappa, among that group there are
some who are the most distinguished
of all," he said.
Identifying and honoring exemplary

scholarship could even act as incen
tive to high achievement for others,
Hargadon said.
Furthermore. Hargadon argued
that Stanford students competing for
outside awards such as Rhodes Schol
arships may be at a disadvantage be
cause of the absence of a highest dis
tinction award.
Previous systejn
Until the late '60s Stanford dist
inguished its top graduates using two
levels of honors — distinction and
great distinction with approximately
five percent receiving the latter honor
and 15 percent receiving the former,
according to Registrar Sally
Mahoney. a member of the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and Achieve
ment (C-AAA).
In the early "70s. however, in the
wake of campus unrest, Stanford
broke with tradition by moving away
from bi-level distinctions and into the
current system.
An average of 22 to 25 percent of
each graduating class is accorded a
Bachelors Degree with distinction.
The honor is bestowed on the basis of
recommendations from department
faculties, but not necessarily GPA.
The 25 percent average is a
guideline, not a quota, according to
Mahoney. who stressed that the per
centage of honors students vary by de
partment. She said departments or
programs graduate from as low as
zero to as high as 60 percent of their
students with distinction each year.
Other honors
In addition to distinction honors,
graduates are eligible for several oth
ers, such as:
