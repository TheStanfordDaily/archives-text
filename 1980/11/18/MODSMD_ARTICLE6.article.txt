## Official slats on Cultural Revolution reveal abuses 
### Washington Post 
Beijing — Chinese authorities
Sunday provided the first of
ficial sampling of the human
costs of the cultural revolution,
asserting that more than 34,000
innocent people were killed and
500,000 persecuted in just a
handful of incidents allegedly
inspired by the "Gang of Four"
and other radical disciples of
Mao Zedong.
The death and casualty count
for Cultural Revolution ac
tivities in a dozen provinces of
China in the late 1960s was con
tained in the second installment
of a criminal indictment against
Mao's widow and nine surviving
radicals who steered the 10-vear
campaign through some of its
more violent stages.
The 10 disgraced radicals who
held the highest political and
military posts in China until
their downfall in 1976 are ex
pected to stand trial within days
on charges of plotting to as
sassinate Mao. persecuting par
ty and state officials and plan
ning an armed coup d'etat.
Their trial has broad political
significance both as a final ver
dict on the bloody and economi
cally disastrous Cultural Revo
lution era. and as a catalyst for
the pragmatic leaders who have
run China in the pas;. tour years
and seek to root out the last ves
tiges of radicalism
Although Chinese authorities
have roughly estimated that as
many as 1 million deaths are at
tributable to the Cultural Revo
lution. the accounting in Sun

day's set of charges is the first
official effort to document the
human wreckage left by young
Red Guards who were ordained
bv Mao to inject "revolutionary
zeal" in Chinese politics and so
ciety.
The specificity of charges in
the isolated cases cited Sunday
— while largely unsubstantiated
— indicates the thoroughness
with which the government
plans to prosecute the case as
well as official attempts to
portray the forthcoming trial as
a fair, criminal matter, and not
a political vendetta.
The latest accusations also
reveal some fresh details about
the activities of Mao's widow.
Jiang Qing. who allegedly dis
patched 40 friends posing as Red
Guards to break into and ran
sack the homes of five Chinese
artists and writers in search of
old letters and photos that ap
parently incriminated her past.
Jiang's past
Jiang Qing. who was a film
actress in the 1930s before she
married Mao and eventually be
came the leader of the Gang of
Four, is accused of supervising
the burning of materials found
in the break-ins.
One of the homes allegedly
ransacked belonged to the late
Zhao Dan. a leading screen and
stage actor in the 19305, who co
starred with Jiang Qing in a
production of The Doll's House.
Many of the break-ins occur
ring during the Cultural Revolu
tion. according to the indict
ment. were performed by a se

cret organization directed by
former Communist Party Vice
Chairman Zhang Chunqiao This
shadowy group specialized in
kidnappings, interrogation and
torture to obtain information,
said the charges.
Charged with beatings
Zhang's organization, it is
charged, was responsible for
some of the "beating, smashing
and looting'' of hundreds of
thousands of officials and or
dinary citizens, including mem
bers of the army, trade unions.
Communist Youth* League,
women's federation, press and
returned overseas Chinese.
The indictment contains bare
details for each of the incidents
in the late 1960s that allegedly
resulted in deaths and casual
ties.
In the southern province of
Yunnan, for example, where in
tense fighting between Red
Guards and local army units
raged during 1968. the indict
ment simply blames the slan
dering of the provincial party
secretary as the cause of "per
secution of large numbers of
cadres and ordinary people"
and over 14.000 deaths.
In Inner Mongolia, the indict
ment charges, fighting between
local party leaders and Red
Guards was instigated by the
late Kang Sheng and Xie Fuzhi,
two radical leaders. "False
cases concocted" by the two
men, it asserts, led to per
secutions of more than 346.000
cadres and ordinary citizens, of
whom 16.222 died.
