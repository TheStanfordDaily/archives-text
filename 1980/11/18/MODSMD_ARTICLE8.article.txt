# Military rulers afraid to loosen grip on freedoms
## 'Peronism' lingers, threatens Argentine dictatorship 
### Los Angeles Times 
Buenos Aires, Argentina — Peronism.
It is not so much a name, or even a move
ment. as it is a religion, a huge cult tht
holds the political life of Argentina in
thrall.
Juan Peron. the founder, is dead. So is
Evita Peron. whose personality
enchanted millions of Argentines. Maria
Estela. Peron's second wife and suc
cessor. is under house arrest.
Yet the legacy remains, a vibrant
force that in many ways controls the life
of the country.
"If we held elections today, a Peronist
would win."
The speaker was not a member of any
of the Peronist groups that still exist as a
sort of underground. He was a ranking
member of the military government that
has ruled Argentina since the overthrow
of the Peronists in 1976.
"It is a matter of the heart," the of
ficial went on "Argentines are ruled by
the heart, not the mind."
No democracy
What that means politically, accord
ing to several observers, is that there
will be no early return to democracy in
Argentina.
"Argentina's president for the year
2000 is still in the military academy," a
former navv officer and determined foe

of Peronism said.
"There is no chance that we could
have elections.'" another government of
ficial said, "at least not any including
Peronist parties. If we did. Mrs. Peron
would name the president.
Maria Estela Martinez de Peron was
her husband's vice president and served
as president for two years following his
death until the military revolt of March
1976. In 1978 she was convicted of em
bezzling public money, but has not been
sentenced. She has been held at her coun
try estate about 40 miles southwest of
Buenos Aires, and could still be tried on
additional charges involving money.
"They keep her totally isolated." a
diplomat said. "They are hoping that if
she is out of sight she will drop from the
minds of the people."
"The government is as much a pris
oner of Peronism as Mrs. Peron is a pris
oner of the government, because of the
certainty that elections would mean a re
turn to Peronism." according to a
diplomat.
Economic shackles
Peronism also shackles the govern
ment in areas other than politics, notably
economics.
Since Gen Jorge Rafael Videla be
came president, his government has
struggled to stabilize an economic sys

tem plagued by inflation, inefficiency
and falling productivity. But the effort
has had limited success. The fault ap
pears to be due largely to the govern
ment's failure to come to grips with the
system installed by Peron
During his rule, from 1946 to 1955 and
again in the early 19705. Peron embraced
a mixture of fascism and welfarism.
Wages were increased regularly, while
prices were frozen. Everyone was prom
ised a job and every worker received
dozens of paid holidays.
Union membership was mandatory
and employers paid the dues, along with
the cost of pensions and health care. The
Perons made certain that the cost of
meat was kept down, thus fulfilling the
average Argentine's greatest wish —
steaks twice a day.
Crippled economy
The result of all this came at the end of
Mrs. Peron's regime, when inflation was
more than 1000 percent, strikes crippled
production and the economy was
bankrupt.
The Videla government has brought
inflation down to about 100 percent, im
proved its international debt position,
and has ended the strikes by repressing
unions. '
"But it hasn't had the nerve to take on
the basics of Peronist economics," an

American banker said, "so Argentina
still has no unemployment, but prod
uctivity stinks Its industries can't sell
overseas and business is inefficient
beyond belief."
So the country goes on, dragging after
it the legacy of a man dead since 1974,
and faced with more of the same for
years to come. Why? Why does Peronism
live when some of the legendary
strongmen of the time — Mao and Stalin,
for example — have been successfully
set aside by their successors?
The answer, if there is one. lies partly
in history. According to many students of
Argentina, it is a country that has always
been attracted more to strength and per
sonality than to ideas. But a prominent
sociologist, who like nearly everyone
who talks about Peronism asked not to be
named, looks to the cultural makeup of
the country for an answer.
"Argentina was settled for the most
part by southern Europeans who don't
have a democratic tradition," he said.
"They look for and expect the govern
ment. particularly a strongman, to run
their lives."
Another part of the answer is found in
Peron himself. An obscure army colonel,
he entered the government in 1943 as a
Cabinet minister. Three years later, he
was the unquestioned ruler of the nation.
