# Schmidt awaits Reagan advisers
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Bonn, West Germany â€”
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt will
probably not realize his wish to
meet Ronald Reagan during his
visit to the United States this
week, but he is likely to see
some of the president-elect's
friends and advisers.
And these individuals are
what Schmidt and other West
Germans like best about Re
agan. They are well-known from
the days they served in the ad
ministrations of former presi
dents Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford.
Schmidt created a diplomatic
flap during the 1976 presidential
election campaign by indicating
his preference for Ford over
Jimmy Crter. This time
Schmidt did not disclose his
choice but there were indica
tions that he preferred Carter to
Reagan because of the latter's
perceived hawkish views.
"Besides." a Schmidt aide
said, "you get used to working
with some people even if you are
not quite happy with the rela
tionship."
Nuclear controversy
The issues of nuclear weap
ons and of Reagan's stand in fa
vor of increasing American and
Western military strength are
likely to be the initial chief
source of controversy between
West Germany and the Reagan
administration. They will be the
main topics during Schmidt's
visit to the United States today
through Thursday.
Schmidt wants to meet with
Reagan, but the president-elect
is said to have turned him down
in order to avoid appearing to
encroach on Carter's pre
rogatives.
The trip was planned before
the American election. Schmidt
will go to New York to receive a
humanitarian award from the
Society for the Family of Man
before going to Washington to
meet with Carter.
Members of Schmidt's of
ficial delegation will meet with
members of Reagan's transi
tion and advisory teams during
the trip. It is expected that For
eign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher will also be visiting
Washington.
Delight expressed
Genscher has expressed de
light over Reagan's promise to
consult regularly with Ameri
ca's allies on foreign policy mat
ters. The West Germans and
other allies were critical of
what they considered to be
Carter's failure to consult them.
But it is the people with whom
Reagan is expected to surround
himself who give Schmidt and
his colleagues their highest
hopes for the new adminis
tration.
The chancellor reportedly

said he would "jump for joy to
the ceiling" if George Shultz be
came secretary of state in the
Reagan administration.
Schmidt and Shultz, considered
a major prospect for the job, are
long-time friends. Their rela
tionship dates back to the days
when Schmidt was West Ger
man finance minister and Shultz
was secretary of labor and then
treasury secretary in the Nixon
administration
Familiar faces
There are many other faces
familiar to Schmidt and other
West Germans among the Re
agan associates, many of them
members of the president
elect's transition and advisory
teams.
Alexander Haig. White House
chief of staff late in the Nixon
administration and former
commander of NATO, is well
known and respected among
West Germans. A member of
the Reagan interim foreign poli
cy team. Haig is also considered
in the running for secretary of
state.
Then there is former Secre
tary of State Henry Kissinger
who, though not expected to hold
a formal position in the new ad
ministration. is likely to remain
an influential adviser to the new
president. Kissinger is well
known to the West Germans and
though they may not always
agree with him, they respect
him as a professional.
Schmidt himself referred to
Kissinger, Shultz and Haig as
"calculable, reliable and
proven." Others referred to
people they expect Reagan to
appoint to top jobs as "sober
businessmen," "experienced
advisers." "a most dist
inguished team," "experienced
experts," "very respectable
conservatives."
Professionals, preachers
One West German commen
tator put it more bluntly: "The
professionals come as the
preachers go."
West Germans say that the
most serious shortcoming of the
Carter administration has been
its "inconsistency and
amateurism," what one source
called "Carter's incalculabili
ty."
This has affected the rela
tionship between Schmidt and
Carter, according to sources
here. Despite the two men's
protestations to the contrary, it
is a relationship that has been
continually under strain.
The strain involved the per
sonalities of the two most pow
erful Western leaders, and a
knowledgeable American
source said. "Carter and
Schmidt simply had the wrong
chemistry in their personal re
lations. Any relationship with
Reagan can only go up."
