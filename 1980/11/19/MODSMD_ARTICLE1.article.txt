# Foreign policy split foreseen
## 
### Cameron Smith 
Associated Press State Department
correspondent Robert Cullen yester
day predicted that a divisive fac
tionalism may emerge in the foreign
policy establishment of the Reagan
administration.
Cullen told an audience of 90 at
Bechtel International Center that de
pending on whom President-elect
Ronald Reagan appoints, division
could develop between those under the
influence of former secretary of state
Henry Kissinger and those more
closely tied to the Reagan campaign
and the Republican right-wing.
In addition, he predicted increased
support for right-wing regimes in the
Third World and the possible re
instatement of the draft as a less ex
pensive way to beef-up the military
than pay increases for technical per
sonnel.
Currently one of 12 pro
fessional journalists on leave to study
in a graduate program with the com
munication department here, Cullen
has covered diplomatic affairs for
A.P since 1978 and hopes to even
tually serve in the Moscow bureau.
While Reagan won't "risk the ire of
conservative Republicans" by naming
Kissinger to a prominent foreign poli
cy position, said Cullen, "Kissinger's
infuence may be substantial if his ex
lieutenants get important positions."
And, according to some Reagan sup
porters, several of Kissinger's men
are now jockeying for some of the 100
to 200 policy making positions Reagan
will appoint, said Cullen.
To avoid embarrassing foreign poli
cy blunders, Reagan, like past presi
dents. will not live up to his promise to
appoint only "new faces," but instead
will to choose mostly experienced of
ficials, predicted Cuilen.
Cullen predicted Reagan will hand
the State Department helm over to
either George Shultz, vice chairman
of Bechtel Inc. and former Nixon cabi
net member, or Alexander Haig,
former NATO chief and White House
Chief of Staff under Nixon from 1973 to
'74 Cullen said both are highly re
spected by West European leaders.
Richard Allen, foreign policy cam
paign adviser to Reagan, is the most
likely choice to head the National Se
curity Council (NSC), and is also a
strong foe of Kissinger, said Cullen.
In addition to the potential Kissin
ger/right-wing split, Cullen said "the
natural rivalry between the NSC and
the State Department will be ex
acerbated enormously," if Reagan
doesn't weaken the NSC. This could
make President Jimmy Carter's for
eign policy organization look "harmo
nious," he said.
Cullen said the Soviet Union, while
aware that Republican anti-com
munist campaign rhetoric hides a
pragmatic moderation, remains un
flexible in its ability to make con
cessions on arms limitations. This, he
said, could create difficulties for Re
agan, who hopes to renegotiate SALT
11, and could possibly lead to a re
newed arms race which could bring
"us closer in times of crisis to nuclear
war than ever before."
In general, Reagan will be forced to
confront the realities of international
issues and act with moderation, said
Cullen. This will confine his more ide
ological tendencies to "symbolic
gestures," such as providing "some
Flss to Taiwan or some other plane
they like" or hosting Soviet exile
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn for dinner at
the White House.
