# Animal research involves 50,000 mice, hamsters, cats... and Molly

On the fifth floor of the
Psychology Department
building. Molly, an Asian
monkey, plays a "search and
find" game with a computer.
Molly must pick out the
green squares from an array
of red diamonds. When she
picks a green square, the
computer feeds her a banana
pellet
As Molly decides which ob
ject to choose, the computer
monitors the activity in her
brain A superstructure built
into Molly's skull connects
the different parts of her
brain to the computer.
Molly is one of about 50,000
research animals who live at
Stanford for a one month pe
riod. said Dr. James
Dewson, the director of the
Division of Laboratory
Animal Medicine (D-LAM)
at Stanford
'That's a lot of animals."
Dewson said, "but to put that
in perspective, probably 98
percent of them are mice or
rats."
Other animals used in
Stanford's $20-million-a-year
research program include
cats, frogs, turtles calves old
and new world monkeys,
salamanders, dogs, goats,
guinea pigs, hamsters, pigs,
rabbits and owls.
The animals occupy about
30,000 square feet of special
facilities plus six additional
acres — all on campus.
Dewson said that D-LAM
is responsible for every
animal used for research.
"We are responsible to in
sure that research done on
animals is ethical and hu
mane."
During a normal one
month period about 120 in
vestigators from the Medical
Center, the Psychology De
partment and the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences
use animals in their re
search.
'' Whether the in
vestigators care for their
own animals, or this division
cares for them, ultimately
the buck stops here," said
Dewson.
His department must
meet standards set by gov
ernment agencies including
Health and Welfare, Na
tional Institutes of Health,
Department of Agriculture,
Food and Drug Adminis

tration, State Department of
Health and California Fish
and Game.
The agencies inspect Stan
ford's facilities to make sure
the animals are not over
crowded. underfed, or sub
jected to pain. Dewson said
that violations of govern
ment standards here are
often ones of negligence.
For example, he said,
"much of the regulation has
to do with how much space an
animal should have, so that a
violation occurs when there
is overcrowding, and that
then becomes a facilities
problem. It's not anyone
being actively cruel or brutal
to animals."
D-LAM works continually
to meet government stan
dards. Dewson said, because
regulations change all the
time.
"You don't get busted for
violations," he said, "the
regulations can just be put
down much faster than you
can respond to them. But you
have to just try and keep your
shop in order."
Stanford has been keeping
its shop in order, according
to Dr. William Utterback, a
government inspector who
enforces the Animal Welfare
Act. His organization in
spects facilities here once a
year.
"During our last inspec
tion, some things were
pointed out where Stanford
needed to make correc
tions." Utterback said. "But
nothing serious was found —
mostly housekeeping things
that could be corrected
quickly."
In general, he said. Stan
ford is in compliance with
the regulations of the Animal
Welfare Act.
In addition to government
agencies, an administrative
panel here regulates animal
research. The panel oversees
D-LAM and makes recom
mendations to President
Donald Kennedy.
Sharon Ullman, the stu
dent member on the panel,
said the committee dis
cusses new ideas about han
dling animals, adminis
trative ideas that might
make D-LAM more efficient,
as well as any violations that
occur.
The committee's biggest
problem is housing, Ullman

said. "So many people want
to use animals in their re
search. we just don't have
room for all of them."
The committee also deals
with the issue of pain in
volved in research. Accord
ing to Dewson, researchers
must alleviate all pain from
suffering animals through
the use of local and general
anesthetics. They must also
relieve any post-operative
pain.
Animals must not suffer
painful deaths. For mice and
rats, the most painless death
is by decapitation. Though
the method may seem cruel,
the Peninsula Humane Socie
ty approves it because it is
quick.
Warren Broderick, of the
Santa Clara division of the

Humane Society said, "Even
though decapitation is not
aesthetically pleasing, it is
the fastest and best way."
Since Broderick's depart
ment has no jurisdiction over
animal testing at univer
sities, he has no specific
evidence of cruelty here.
However, he said there are
potential areas of cruelty
whenever animal research is
performed.
"Often psychological tes
ting is cruei," he said "It
can be Pavlov revisisted,
only 10 times worse."
Dewson refuted any
charges of cruelty to animals
at Stanford Every re
searcher must sign a paper
saying he will live up to all
ethical standards, he said.
Dewson argued against

groups who oppose the use of
animals for research. "If
they got their way our $20-
miilion-a-year program
would go down the tubes. You
can't go and rip hearts out of
students."
He emphasized the gains
that researchers have made
as a result of animal testing.
Dogs and horses are helping
in the field of sleep dis
orders. Calves are used to
help Stanford's world-re
nowned heart transplant pro
gram.
Even Molly the monkey is
helping researchers. Dr.
Bruce Bolster, a neu
ropsychology researcher,
said Molly is providing data
that may some day improve
treatment of hyperkinetic
children and schizophrenics.

salamanders, dogs, goats,
guinea pigs, hamsters, pigs,

The animals occupy about
30,000 square feet of special
facilities plus six additional
acres — all on campus.
Dewson said that D-LAM
is responsible for every
animal used for research.
"We are responsible to in
sure that research done on
animals is ethical and hu
mane."
During a normal one
month period about 120 in
vestigators from the Medical
Center, the Psychology De
partment and the Depart
ment of Biological Sciences
use animals in their re
search.
'' Whether the in
vestigators care for their
own animals, or this division
cares for them, ultimately
the buck stops here," said
Dewson.
His department must
meet standards set by gov
ernment agencies including
Health and Welfare, Na
tional Institutes of Health,
Department of Agriculture,
Food and Drug Adminis

tration, State Department of
Health and California Fish
and Game.
The agencies inspect Stan
ford's facilities to make sure
the animals are not over
crowded. underfed, or sub
jected to pain. Dewson said
that violations of govern
ment standards here are
often ones of negligence.
For example, he said,
"much of the regulation has
to do with how much space an
animal should have, so that a
violation occurs when there
is overcrowding, and that
then becomes a facilities
problem. It's not anyone
being actively cruel or brutal
to animals."
D-LAM works continually
to meet government stan
dards. Dewson said, because
regulations change all the
time.
"You don't get busted for
violations," he said, "the
regulations can just be put
down much faster than you
can respond to them. But you
have to just try and keep your
shop in order."
Stanford has been keeping
its shop in order, according
to Dr. William Utterback, a
government inspector who
enforces the Animal Welfare
Act. His organization in
spects facilities here once a
year.
"During our last inspec
tion, some things were
pointed out where Stanford
needed to make correc
tions." Utterback said. "But
nothing serious was found —
mostly housekeeping things
that could be corrected
quickly."
In general, he said. Stan
ford is in compliance with
the regulations of the Animal
Welfare Act.
In addition to government
agencies, an administrative
panel here regulates animal
research. The panel oversees
D-LAM and makes recom
mendations to President
Donald Kennedy.
Sharon Ullman, the stu
dent member on the panel,
said the committee dis
cusses new ideas about han
dling animals, adminis
trative ideas that might
make D-LAM more efficient,
as well as any violations that
occur.
The committee's biggest
problem is housing, Ullman

said. "So many people want
to use animals in their re
search. we just don't have
room for all of them."
The committee also deals
with the issue of pain in
volved in research. Accord
ing to Dewson, researchers
must alleviate all pain from
suffering animals through
the use of local and general
anesthetics. They must also
relieve any post-operative
pain.
Animals must not suffer
painful deaths. For mice and
rats, the most painless death
is by decapitation. Though
the method may seem cruel,
the Peninsula Humane Socie
ty approves it because it is
quick.
Warren Broderick, of the
Santa Clara division of the

Humane Society said, "Even
though decapitation is not
aesthetically pleasing, it is
the fastest and best way."
Since Broderick's depart
ment has no jurisdiction over
animal testing at univer
sities, he has no specific
evidence of cruelty here.
However, he said there are
potential areas of cruelty
whenever animal research is
performed.
"Often psychological tes
ting is cruei," he said "It
can be Pavlov revisisted,
only 10 times worse."
Dewson refuted any
charges of cruelty to animals
at Stanford Every re
searcher must sign a paper
saying he will live up to all
ethical standards, he said.
Dewson argued against

groups who oppose the use of
animals for research. "If
they got their way our $20-
miilion-a-year program
would go down the tubes. You
can't go and rip hearts out of
students."
He emphasized the gains
that researchers have made
as a result of animal testing.
Dogs and horses are helping
in the field of sleep dis
orders. Calves are used to
help Stanford's world-re
nowned heart transplant pro
gram.
Even Molly the monkey is
helping researchers. Dr.
Bruce Bolster, a neu
ropsychology researcher,
said Molly is providing data
that may some day improve
treatment of hyperkinetic
children and schizophrenics.
