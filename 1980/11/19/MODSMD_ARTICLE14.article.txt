# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Dale Gieringer A 						voice for the New Right 
### 
Let's face it A lot of us, my
self included, did not get what
we voted for on Election Day.
According to the returns, only 21
percent of Stanford voters cast
their ballots for Ronald Reagan
It would be flattering, but
presumptuous, to assume that
this shows Stanford is somehow
more enlightened than the rest
of the country On the contrary,
as pointed out in a recent letter
bv William Wrav {Daily, Nov
31. many of the attacks on Re
agan appearing in the Daily
seemed based more on name
calling than on enlightened
analysis
There is in the end a certain
inconsistency, one might even
say hypocrisy, in those supposed
liberals who attack the New
Right for bigotry, while at the
same time referring to Reagan
as "Ronnie" and "Bonzo." One
can imagine their indignation if
the same language they use
against the New Right were
directed instead at their favor
ite minority groups
Once it is understood that the
New Right is in many ways a
cultural minority group in its
own right, it is hard to see why it
should not have a voice in the
government. The problem is
that many of us simply disagree
with them. For example, when
it comes to such issues as abor
tion. homosexual rights, and
equal rights for women, there
are few of us who want the stan
dards of the Moral Majority im
posed on us from Washington
But the question might well
be asked, how many of us in the
past have been content to let
Washington impose the values
of liberalism upon the Moral
Majority, in such matters as

school busing, education cur
riculum. or federal funding of
abortion"' Over the past twenty
years and more, liberals have
enthusiastically sought to ex
tend federal power over states
and local communities in order
to promote their own social
goals Where they have been un
able to implement their policies
through Congress, they have
frequently sought to do so by
less democratic means through
the courts and regulatory agen
cies
The legacy of this era of liber
al rule has been mixed Certain
ly one of its greatest ac
complishments has been to re
lieve minorities and women of
some of the burdens of unjust
discrimination and stere
otyping This has been as much
a cultural as a political ac
complishment. however, and
there is little reason to believe
that the incoming adminis
tration has any desire to reverse
it. much less that it can
The economic legacy of liber
alism is more problematical,
however Since the Vietnam
War. successive Democratic
Congresses have been unwilling
or unable to balance the budget
or control government spend
ing. Just to list the names of the
cabinet departments that have
been set up since the Johnson
Administration is to repeat a
litany of unsolved and de
teriorating problems: Educa
tion. Energy, Transportation.
Housing and Urban Develop
ment. It is the public monopoly
power of such agencies, not the
long-vanished private trusts and
monopolies of liberal folklore,
which stand at the crux of our
current economic and social dif

ficulties
In the 50 years since the
founding of the New Deal, liber
alism itself has become a vested
interest — vested in the machin
ery of government From this
perspective, it was Carter and
his liberal supporters who were
the true conservatives in this
election While many of yester
year's radicals, like Tom
Hay den. Andy Young and Sam
Brown, tried fruitlessly to rally
the country behind four more
years of the status quo, the elec
torate for once turned radical,
ending not only Carter's admin
istration. but liberal control of
the Senate as well
This change, while long over
due. came at the unfortunate
price of sweeping in an altogeth
er new set of scoundrels from
the New Right. Whether they
can redeem their mandate with
useful reform remains to be
seen It would obviously be pre
mature to assert that a second
New Deal is nigh, but the possi
bility cannot be completely dis
counted.
The New Right senators may
be uncouth, but so were many of
the southern and northern ma
chine politicians who backed
Roosevelt. Many of the latter
were naturally offensive to the
well-educated sensibilities of
college students in the '30s.
In fact. Carter's two-to-one
margin over Reagan at Stanford
had its precendent in Hoover's
similar margin over Roosevelt
in 1932. Then as today, college
campuses were a bastion of
privileged elites.

Snide attitude
I felt uncomfortable reading
the column by Brown and Allen
in Wednesday's Daily. It wasn't
until the next day. however, that
the snide attitude apparent in
the article really got to me. I
wonder whether the two authors
realize just how haughty they
are toward people's everyday
greetings. Indeed, I wonder
whether they themselves speak
only profundities. They write
With great disdain for others
who say, "Hi," to one another
on meeting and then launch into
conversation about their
courses, their studying, etc.
Just what do these self-ordained
critics talk about when they run
into an acquaintance? There is a
time and place for everything,
to coin a phrase, and it isn't im
mediately clear to me that a
chance encounter should be the
occasion for a "deep" dis
cussion. I would be interested in
seeing a follow-up column in
structing us ordinary mortals in
the niceties of conversation dur
ing such a chance meeting.
With respect to cocktail
parties, many consider them
vacuous, but there is a simple
solution — don't go.

Snide attitude
I felt uncomfortable reading
the column by Brown and Allen
in Wednesday's Daily. It wasn't
until the next day. however, that
the snide attitude apparent in
the article really got to me. I
wonder whether the two authors
realize just how haughty they
are toward people's everyday
greetings. Indeed, I wonder
whether they themselves speak
only profundities. They write
With great disdain for others
who say, "Hi," to one another
on meeting and then launch into
conversation about their
courses, their studying, etc.
Just what do these self-ordained
critics talk about when they run
into an acquaintance? There is a
time and place for everything,
to coin a phrase, and it isn't im
mediately clear to me that a
chance encounter should be the
occasion for a "deep" dis
cussion. I would be interested in
seeing a follow-up column in
structing us ordinary mortals in
the niceties of conversation dur
ing such a chance meeting.
With respect to cocktail
parties, many consider them
vacuous, but there is a simple
solution — don't go.

Let's face it A lot of us, my
self included, did not get what
we voted for on Election Day.
According to the returns, only 21
percent of Stanford voters cast
their ballots for Ronald Reagan
It would be flattering, but
presumptuous, to assume that
this shows Stanford is somehow
more enlightened than the rest
of the country On the contrary,
as pointed out in a recent letter
bv William Wrav {Daily, Nov
31. many of the attacks on Re
agan appearing in the Daily
seemed based more on name
calling than on enlightened
analysis
There is in the end a certain
inconsistency, one might even
say hypocrisy, in those supposed
liberals who attack the New
Right for bigotry, while at the
same time referring to Reagan
as "Ronnie" and "Bonzo." One
can imagine their indignation if
the same language they use
against the New Right were
directed instead at their favor
ite minority groups
Once it is understood that the
New Right is in many ways a
cultural minority group in its
own right, it is hard to see why it
should not have a voice in the
government. The problem is
that many of us simply disagree
with them. For example, when
it comes to such issues as abor
tion. homosexual rights, and
equal rights for women, there
are few of us who want the stan
dards of the Moral Majority im
posed on us from Washington
But the question might well
be asked, how many of us in the
past have been content to let
Washington impose the values
of liberalism upon the Moral
Majority, in such matters as

school busing, education cur
riculum. or federal funding of
abortion"' Over the past twenty
years and more, liberals have
enthusiastically sought to ex
tend federal power over states
and local communities in order
to promote their own social
goals Where they have been un
able to implement their policies
through Congress, they have
frequently sought to do so by
less democratic means through
the courts and regulatory agen
cies
The legacy of this era of liber

complishments has been to re
