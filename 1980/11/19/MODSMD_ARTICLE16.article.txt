## The
						only security is in our conscience 
### 
Someone asked me before the
election that if Carter. Reagan
and Anderson were in a boat in
the middle of the ocean and it
was sinking, who would be
saved? Seeing that I didn't know
the answer, he said. "The
American people!" This answer
reminded me of a remark that
Albert Einstein made once re
garding the downfall of the Unit
ed States: "Everywhere, in the
economic as well as in the politi
cal life, the guiding principle is
one of ruthless striving for suc
cess at the expense of one's fel
low men."
Such ruthless striving is re
vealed in the competition for
grades among university stu
dents. A student told me that he
had preferred difficult courses
in order to learn. To his dismay,
he achieved only a C average
and is now at a loss to find a job.
whereas many others taking
easier courses were immediate
ly given jobs after graduation
because of their higher grade
points.
Einstein's vision of the de
mise of the United States is also
borne out by the fact that the av
erage intelligence among the
students has decreased twenty
percent in the last twenty years
due to television and parental
neglect. A student of theology
told me that 80 percent of his
classmates are demoralized
often to the point of suicide.
I myself can attest to this: A
German student, who wanted to
spend some three months in
Stanford, typed for me in order
to pay for his room and board.
One day he said that he did not
need to come anymore since he
had found a girlfriend in a stu
dent house to take care of him.
That he shared her room did not
shock me. although I do not be
lieve that such togetherness
furthers the nobility of thought
in the student house. What
startled me was a conversation
between two students who sat
beside me at a dinner I was in
vited to in that house. One young
man boasted to his friend, "I
slept with ten girls this week,
and every one was different."
With the decay of ethics goes
hand-in-hand the deterioration
of health. The food in American
universities in general is such a
nutritional disaster — sweet,
greasy and synthetic — that it
caused a dean of a medical
school to remark, "I know this,

but cannot help it. We have to
find room for courses in
pacemakers and other elec
tronic devices, so how can we
add nutrition courses?"
I experienced this medical
machine mind when 1 was ad
mitted to the Stanford hospital
for a minor operation a couple of
years ago. I was so disturbed by
the constant calls for doctors
over the loudspeaker that I
couldn't sleep. When I closed
the door to my room, the nurse
reprimanded me, saying it was
against hospital regulations for
the door to be closed. By morn
ing I was such a nervous wreck
that I told my smiling doctor, "I
refuse to be operated upon in
this condition. If I suffer a
stroke or heart attack, it's
simple for you to write on your
report: 'Surgery successful, pa
tient dead.'"
Naturally the American mass
mind, demoralized and sick as it
is, can easily be steered into a
military mentality, which
Bertrand Russell has termed,
"trust in the naked power." The
daughter of one of the U.S.
hostages in Iran recently told us
in the Bechtel International
Center how she deplores the
U.S. foreign policy toward Iran,
which "has been pretty ugly
from a moral point of view."
The question may now be
asked, how can we regenerate
ourselves so that such a joke of

the sinking boat becomes mean
ingless? Einstein said to me
shortly before his death that our
only hope is to change the heart
of man and create a cosmic hu
manity We must learn that our
only security is our conscience.
To distinguish this "still small
voice" from lower influences of
the ego or group we must learn
to test the spirits.
I present you the poem
"Americana," inspired by
Bertrand Russell's last warn
ing: "No previous age has had
as great a need as ours has of
men who will proclaim how life
should be lived, no matter how
loudly the holders of power may
howl for death. Never before
has all mankind been threat
ened .... It is your duty — or
rather your privilege — to pro
test in every way likely to be ef
fective. You are likely to suffer
by doing so. But even in suffer
ing. you will be able to preserve
a deep happiness not open to the
prosperous engineers of dis
aster."
Americana
O you are fine? How nice of you.
And all is fine at home, how
nice.
The children fine and sweet and
nice,
all functions well like the ma
chine.
And Sundays you kneel in the
pew —
God is fine. too.

And our well chosen politician
how tough his job. how sweet his
smiles.
the cocktail parties, airplane
trips
and tender-fingered secretar
ies.
and. above all. his White House
vision —
o holy mission!
Wave the star-spangled flag, my
son.
the school and television teach
you fifty words, more you don't
need.
Let three words be your life and
soul.
they'll make your heart beat
fast, feet run:
"Money, icebox, fun!"
And our American lifestyle, o
brother!
Suicidal-tvpe behavior smiles,
the President smiles, the
surgeon smiles,
the hospital smiles, no more
room to die.
The pill smiles, too. Who wants
to be a mother?
How we love each other!
Come food-geared tongues, lust
evermore.
The time is short. Saint Helen
blows
the black-skinned fury on your
crops.
on atom carriers in the east.
Too long life was your whore:
Justice knocks at your door.

fessor emeritus.
