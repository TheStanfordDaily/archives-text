## Left needs action, not apathy 
### 
We rjow know that Ronald Re
agan will be our next President
and that the likes of Jesse
Helms and Strom Thurmond
will head a newly reactionary
Senate. For workers, minor
ities, women, and others con
cerned with social justice, the
next four years threaten to be
devastating, and the devas
tation may extend far into the
future. Longstanding foes of
women's and minorities' rights
are already planning anti-abor
tion amendments, roll-backs of
ERA, cuts in welfare, and pres
sure on minimum wages. Re
agan and the Senate will possi
bly approve as many as four new
Supreme Court justices.
In the face of all this, the left
is divided and dispirited. In
deed. the rightward tilt in Wash
ington owes much of its motion
to past lack of cohesiveness and
innovative responses among
progressive groups to the pres
ent economic crisis. Without a
political party of its own, or
even control of the more broad
ly based Democrats, the Ameri
can left lacks the focal point for
creative new analyses or a con
crete strategy for implement
ing needed social and economic
change.
Societal injustice
People are most effective po
litically when addressing issues
which directly concern them.
But the fundamental in
terdependence of the injustices
which plague our society neces
sitates an integrated analysis —
a comprehensive and forward
looking perspective which ties
together our various struggles
and offers a coordinated
strategy for social progress.
Here at Stanford the situation
among progressive groups and
individuals is characterized by
much of the same fragmenta
tion and frustration seen at the
national level. Numerous small
groups work dedicatedly for
progressive awareness and
change, but they work largely in
isolation. Contact among them
is intermittent at best, and

much of that contact em
phasizes areas of disagreement
rather than their many common
concerns.
What should bring us together
is the shared perception that our
struggles are interconnected
and linked to the same basic
roots. Individual groups' are vi
tal, but they can no longer be
separated contextually. They
must be joined in a tolerant,
open-minded fashion, mindful
of previous errors and in
sensitivities.
Communication, analysis
In this spirit, we have formed
the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA). SPA's purpose is
to facilitate communication and
mutual support among the vari
ous progressive groups and peo
ple at Stanford. Our aim is to
foster a comprehensive analysis
necessary for a more unified
and effective movement.
Our initial goals center on co
ordination and educational out
reach. Education is best trans
mitted through direct ex
perience; thus SPA will con
tinue to sponsor activities like
our election night rally, ac
tivities which help bring togeth
er the many progressive ele
ments of the Stanford
progressive community.
The variety of interests and
ideas which characterize the
groups joined together to create
SPA attest to the need for an in
clusive and non-dogmatic ap
proach to the present crisis.
SPA means discussions between
anti-nuclear, anti-draft, minor
ity. and women's groups; it
means students talking to work
ers and faculty talking to com
munity organizers. As a coali
tion. we can use our many areas
of agreement as a context to dis
cuss and resolve disagreements.
The approach has succeeded
beyond our most optimistic
hopes. But to build a truly mean
ingful movement, we must
reach out to even more groups
and individuals.
In an effort t.o broaden the
base of our progressive coali
tion and increase understanding
of each others' struggles, we

have planned four educational
forums between now and the
end of the quarter. We see these
forums as a means to gain im
portant insights and to expand
our various political per
spectives. Developing some of
these analytical tools will
enable us to put together a com
prehensive strategy that ad
dresses our mutual concerns.
Range of issues
In the forums, students, pro
fessors, workers and communi
ty members will address a
broad range of issues related to
the current American political
situation and the impact of the
Reagan administration. The
format will consist of presenta
tions, synopses of recent politi
cal organizations involved with
these issues, and general dis
cussion.
The first of the forums -
today at 4:30 in the Old
Press Room — will focus on la
bor, minorities, and corporate
responsibility. In subsequent
weeks we will examine: energy,
the environment, and nuclear
weaponry; the Third World, for
eign policy, and the draft; and
women's and gay people's
movements. Open to the entire
community, the forums offer a
unique opportunity to educate
while building important al
liances in the process.
The recent move to the right
in this country can either push
us further into apathy or stimu
late us into alternative
strategies and action. The 1970s
are called the "me" decade, a
conservative period. The Re
agan victory and the new Senate
majority requires that we ex
plore new solutions and take ac
tion.
As students, we share a
unique opportunity to act to
gether. Recognizing our poten
tial as activists is the first step
toward such action, and the
time for recognition is now. We
have no further to look for alter
natives than to ourselves.

the current American political
situation and the impact of the
Reagan administration. The
format will consist of presenta
tions, synopses of recent politi
cal organizations involved with
these issues, and general dis
cussion.
The first of the forums -
today at 4:30 in the Old
Press Room — will focus on la
bor, minorities, and corporate
responsibility. In subsequent
weeks we will examine: energy,
the environment, and nuclear
weaponry; the Third World, for
eign policy, and the draft; and
women's and gay people's
movements. Open to the entire
community, the forums offer a
unique opportunity to educate
while building important al
liances in the process.
The recent move to the right
in this country can either push
us further into apathy or stimu
late us into alternative
strategies and action. The 1970s
are called the "me" decade, a
conservative period. The Re
agan victory and the new Senate
majority requires that we ex
plore new solutions and take ac
tion.
As students, we share a
unique opportunity to act to
gether. Recognizing our poten
tial as activists is the first step
toward such action, and the
time for recognition is now. We
have no further to look for alter
natives than to ourselves.

We rjow know that Ronald Re
agan will be our next President
and that the likes of Jesse
Helms and Strom Thurmond
will head a newly reactionary
Senate. For workers, minor
ities, women, and others con
cerned with social justice, the
next four years threaten to be
devastating, and the devas
tation may extend far into the
future. Longstanding foes of
women's and minorities' rights
are already planning anti-abor
tion amendments, roll-backs of
ERA, cuts in welfare, and pres
sure on minimum wages. Re
agan and the Senate will possi
bly approve as many as four new
Supreme Court justices.
In the face of all this, the left
is divided and dispirited. In
deed. the rightward tilt in Wash
ington owes much of its motion
to past lack of cohesiveness and
innovative responses among
progressive groups to the pres
ent economic crisis. Without a
political party of its own, or
even control of the more broad
ly based Democrats, the Ameri
can left lacks the focal point for
creative new analyses or a con
crete strategy for implement
ing needed social and economic
change.
Societal injustice
People are most effective po
litically when addressing issues
which directly concern them.
But the fundamental in
terdependence of the injustices
which plague our society neces
sitates an integrated analysis —
a comprehensive and forward
looking perspective which ties
together our various struggles
and offers a coordinated
strategy for social progress.
Here at Stanford the situation
among progressive groups and
individuals is characterized by
much of the same fragmenta
tion and frustration seen at the
national level. Numerous small
groups work dedicatedly for
progressive awareness and
change, but they work largely in
isolation. Contact among them
is intermittent at best, and

much of that contact em
phasizes areas of disagreement
rather than their many common
concerns.
What should bring us together
is the shared perception that our
struggles are interconnected
and linked to the same basic
roots. Individual groups' are vi
tal, but they can no longer be
separated contextually. They
must be joined in a tolerant,
open-minded fashion, mindful
of previous errors and in
sensitivities.
Communication, analysis
In this spirit, we have formed
the Stanford Progressive Al
liance (SPA). SPA's purpose is
to facilitate communication and
mutual support among the vari
ous progressive groups and peo
ple at Stanford. Our aim is to
foster a comprehensive analysis
necessary for a more unified
and effective movement.
Our initial goals center on co
ordination and educational out
reach. Education is best trans
mitted through direct ex
perience; thus SPA will con
tinue to sponsor activities like
our election night rally, ac
tivities which help bring togeth
er the many progressive ele
ments of the Stanford
progressive community.
The variety of interests and
ideas which characterize the
groups joined together to create
SPA attest to the need for an in
clusive and non-dogmatic ap
proach to the present crisis.
SPA means discussions between
anti-nuclear, anti-draft, minor
ity. and women's groups; it
means students talking to work
ers and faculty talking to com
munity organizers. As a coali
tion. we can use our many areas
of agreement as a context to dis
cuss and resolve disagreements.
The approach has succeeded
beyond our most optimistic
hopes. But to build a truly mean
ingful movement, we must
reach out to even more groups
and individuals.
In an effort t.o broaden the
base of our progressive coali
tion and increase understanding
of each others' struggles, we

have planned four educational
forums between now and the
end of the quarter. We see these
forums as a means to gain im
portant insights and to expand
our various political per
spectives. Developing some of
these analytical tools will
enable us to put together a com
prehensive strategy that ad
dresses our mutual concerns.
