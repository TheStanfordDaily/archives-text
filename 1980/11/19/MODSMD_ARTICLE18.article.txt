## Demos give GOP a chance 
### Washington Post 
Washington — Still groping through the dark of
political midnight, a dozen moderate con
gressional Democrats met privately at a
Chesapeake Bay retreat last week to ponder their
shrinking world.
It was a sobering session.
in January, for the first time in 26 years, Demo
crats will not be running the congressional show.
They will be out of power in the Senate, their
House majority will be diminished and Ronald
Reagan will be in the White House.
Yet for all the morning-after hurt from Nov. 4, a
fascinating political brew already has begun to
cook as Democrats move from their role as in
itiators and orchestrators to the minority role of
opposition and holders-of-the-line.
From the Chesapeake retreat to congressional
corridors. Democrats were talking with unac
customed vigor about uniting their party, re-ex
amining their ideas and, in the spirit of good
losers, letting Republicans trip over their own
promises.
Cooperation
Uniformly, in one interview after another,
Democrats from House Speaker Thomas "Tip"
O'Neill (D-Mass.), on down talked about cooper
ating with President-elect Ronald Reagan and
giving the GOP a chance.
And while Democrats expect a Republican-con
servative assault on some of their favorite social
programs, no one anticipates wholesale
emasculations, for not even the new majority is of
one mind on what should go.
While Republicans will hold a whip hand in the
Senate and the executive branch, some senators
such as moderate Gary Hart of Colorado are not
so sure that the GOP will readily find ways to

fulfill its promises.
He said Republicans campaigned against feder
al regulations as though they had "sprouted up
from nowhere, rooted in nothing," rather than
being dictated by laws Congress had passed.
Party unity
Sen. Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, another of the
moderate Democrats, speculated that his party
may profit from its new minority role.
"There were indications in our caucus this
week that Democrats already are beginning to
think more in terms of party," Matsunaga said.
"It may strengthen our party structure to the
point that those who abandon party line will suf
fer."
In due time, he said, "the new Senate leader
ship and the president will begin to realize they
will need the support of Democrats, and they will
need to cater to the new minority. My experience
is that the Senate deals across party lines much
more than the House."
New right
There is another element in the GOP rise to
power that Democrats are watching intensely —
the role the New Right will play and whether it
will capture the Reagan administration.
Most Democrats think this will not occur and
that Reagan, to prevent it from happening, will
need a friendly hand from time to time from the
loyal opposition. To get that hand, he will have to
trade favors.
Otherwise a difficult period lies ahead, cau
tioned Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.). Without nam
ing names, he said the GOP tide has elected
"some people with no sense of history or why the
Senate even exists, people running for their own
ego gratification or the gratification of single-is
sue groups."

house the Institution — the familiar Hoover Tower and the newer Hoover Pavilions. President-elect
Ronald Reagan has already drawn several top advisers from the Institution's ranks and is expected
to appoint several more Hoover members to government positions.
