# Reagan brings Hoover out of exile

Bv The Los Angeles Tunes
Palo Alto — Only a favored few would
have caught the significance of Ed Meese's
necktie when the No 1 aide to President
elect Ronald Reagan was being interviewed
on national television a few weeks ago The
design was the logo of the Hoover Institution
at Stanford University, and the buildings
that resembled at first glance the Washing
ton Monument and the White House were
the landmark Hoover tower on the Stanford
campus and the twin Hoover buildings
It was just another subtle reminder of the
kinship that has developed in the past few
years between the president-elect and his
staff and the 61-year-old think tank that
often has been described as a conservative
governrnent-in-exile. It also was a good in
dication that the ascendency of Reagan to
the White House means the exile is over.
The Ronald Reagan connection to Hoover
dates back to 1975 when he was appointed an
honorary fellow on the Hoover staff and de
posited the papers from his eight years as
California governor at the Hoover library.
And the institution's Board of Overseers in
cludes such close Reagan associates and
friends as Anne Armstrong, former U.S.
Ambassador to Britain; Joseph Coors, Colo
rado beer magnate; Alan Greenspan, econ
omist and former Ford administration of
ficial; William Simon, former Treasury
secretary, and Gordon Luce, who served in
the Reagan administration in Sacramento
and now is a savings and loan executive in
San Diego.
Narrow purpose
For years after it was founded with a
$50,000 gift from Stanford alumnus Herbert
Hoover in 1919 as a repository for research
material from Russia and Eastern Europe,
the Hoover Institution languished in the
backwaters of academe, locked into a
stridently anti-Marxist mentality and

scorned by educators for its narrowness of
purpose
Its problems were compounded in the late
1950s when the aging Hoover defined what
he saw as its mission
He declared "The purpose of this institu
tion must be. by its research and publica
tions. to demonstrate the evils of the doc
trines of Karl Marx — whether com
munism. socialism, economic materialism
or atheism — thus to protect the American
way of life from such ideologies, their con
spiracies. and to reaffirm the validity of the
American system."
Under the guidance of W Glenn
Campbell, named director 20 years ago,
Hoover has broadened both its research and
its base financial support and has moved
toward intellectual respectability, widely
recognized for sound research from a con
servative viewpoint much as the work at
Harvard and at the Brookings Institution ir
Influential book
Throughout this campaign year, Reagan
turned to Hoover to provide intellectual sub
stance to his conservative views on a broad
range of domestic and international issues.
Now. as he starts to shape a new adminis
tration. he is expected to lean heavily on the
institution for both personnel and policy ad
vice.
Two top-ranking Reagan advisers,
domestic affairs specialist Martin An
derson and Darrell Trent, who was director
of the Office of Emergency Preparedness in
Richard Nixon's administration, are on
leaves of absence from Hoover. Other Hoo
ver staff members, including director W
Glenn Campbell, are serving on a variety of
Reagan transition task forces, and an 868-
page book recently published by the institu
tion. The United States in the 1980s, is a

strong reflection of the Reagan view of the
future
The book is a collection of essays by 32 ex
perts on domestic and foreign issues. 20 of
whom have served in one capacity or anoth
er as advisers to Keagan, and the central
theme is a call for less government, lower
taxes, stronger national defense and dis
trust of Soviet intentions.
Conservative advisers
In many cases, the book elaborates on
things that Keagan said or goals that he out
lined during the course of his campaign as
he borrowed heavily on Hoover ideas and
philosophy For example:
—A chapter on welfare reform, by Martin
Anderson, calls for establishing and enforc
ing a clear work requirement for welfare re
cipients and shifting authority and responsi
bility for welfare programs to local govern
ments.
Senior fellow and economist Thomas
Moore, an adviser to Reagan on government
regulation, writes that the solution to the
nation's energy needs and to heavy depen
dence on imported oil is to deregulate the
energy industries and let the marketplace
set prices.
—Senior research fellow and Nobel Prize
winning economist Milton Friedman calls
for limiting government spending and cut
ting taxes to restore a healthy economy.
—Hoover's associate director, former
Marine Col Richard Staar. a hardline anti-
Cornmunist who heads Hoover's interna
tional studies program and advises Reagan
on the Soviet Union and Kastern Europe,
writes that no SALT II treaty at all may be
better than one that "shackles the United
States.'*'Staar calls for "tough bargaining"
with the Soviets, predicting that Soviet lead
ership in the 1980s "will continue to be semi
educated. cynical, unscrupulous and dedi
cated to the pursuit of power."

Its problems were compounded in the late
1950s when the aging Hoover defined what

He declared "The purpose of this institu

Influential book
Throughout this campaign year, Reagan
turned to Hoover to provide intellectual sub
stance to his conservative views on a broad
range of domestic and international issues.
Now. as he starts to shape a new adminis
tration. he is expected to lean heavily on the
institution for both personnel and policy ad
vice.
Two top-ranking Reagan advisers,
domestic affairs specialist Martin An
derson and Darrell Trent, who was director
of the Office of Emergency Preparedness in
Richard Nixon's administration, are on
leaves of absence from Hoover. Other Hoo
ver staff members, including director W
Glenn Campbell, are serving on a variety of
Reagan transition task forces, and an 868-
page book recently published by the institu
tion. The United States in the 1980s, is a

strong reflection of the Reagan view of the
future
The book is a collection of essays by 32 ex
perts on domestic and foreign issues. 20 of
whom have served in one capacity or anoth
er as advisers to Keagan, and the central
theme is a call for less government, lower
taxes, stronger national defense and dis
trust of Soviet intentions.
Conservative advisers
In many cases, the book elaborates on
things that Keagan said or goals that he out
lined during the course of his campaign as
he borrowed heavily on Hoover ideas and
philosophy For example:
—A chapter on welfare reform, by Martin
Anderson, calls for establishing and enforc
ing a clear work requirement for welfare re
cipients and shifting authority and responsi
bility for welfare programs to local govern
ments.
Senior fellow and economist Thomas
Moore, an adviser to Reagan on government
regulation, writes that the solution to the
nation's energy needs and to heavy depen
dence on imported oil is to deregulate the
energy industries and let the marketplace
set prices.
—Senior research fellow and Nobel Prize
winning economist Milton Friedman calls
for limiting government spending and cut
ting taxes to restore a healthy economy.
—Hoover's associate director, former
Marine Col Richard Staar. a hardline anti-
Cornmunist who heads Hoover's interna
tional studies program and advises Reagan
on the Soviet Union and Kastern Europe,
writes that no SALT II treaty at all may be
better than one that "shackles the United
States.'*'Staar calls for "tough bargaining"
with the Soviets, predicting that Soviet lead
ership in the 1980s "will continue to be semi
educated. cynical, unscrupulous and dedi
cated to the pursuit of power."

Palo Alto — Only a favored few would
have caught the significance of Ed Meese's
necktie when the No 1 aide to President
elect Ronald Reagan was being interviewed
on national television a few weeks ago The
design was the logo of the Hoover Institution
at Stanford University, and the buildings
that resembled at first glance the Washing
ton Monument and the White House were
the landmark Hoover tower on the Stanford
campus and the twin Hoover buildings
It was just another subtle reminder of the
kinship that has developed in the past few
years between the president-elect and his
staff and the 61-year-old think tank that
often has been described as a conservative
governrnent-in-exile. It also was a good in
dication that the ascendency of Reagan to
the White House means the exile is over.
The Ronald Reagan connection to Hoover
dates back to 1975 when he was appointed an
honorary fellow on the Hoover staff and de
posited the papers from his eight years as
California governor at the Hoover library.
And the institution's Board of Overseers in
cludes such close Reagan associates and
friends as Anne Armstrong, former U.S.
Ambassador to Britain; Joseph Coors, Colo
rado beer magnate; Alan Greenspan, econ
omist and former Ford administration of

secretary, and Gordon Luce, who served in
the Reagan administration in Sacramento
and now is a savings and loan executive in
San Diego.
