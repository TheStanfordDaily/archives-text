# Genetic corporations: universities find new ventures too hot an issue
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
As the science of genetic engineering becomes big busi
ness, making some biochemists multimillionaires, Ameri
can universities are trying to figure out a way to share in
the profits without subverting their academic mission.
Harvard, which last month disclosed that it was think
ing of going into the gene-splicing business for itself, drew
such a firestorm of protest that it announced this week
that it was abandoning the idea.
UCLA, whose researchers casually passed around some
material that they had engineered genetically, is now in
volved in litigation with two companies that are using the
fruits of the research and refusing to pay royalties.
The problem is not new. Only the size of the stakes and
the names of the players are. The computer and elec
tronics industries were spawned at universities, which
shared little in the private profits that were made. But this
is the first time that biologists have had a chance to turn
their research into fortunes, and the universities want a
piece of the action.
For the universities, the situation is fraught with danger
as well as with promise. If UCLA loses its case, there are
fears that the spirit of free and open communication
among scientists will be dealt a mortal blow. If biological
ideas turn out to be worth a lot of money, researchers will
patent first and publish second, if at all.
"There are a set of new ethical strains appearing in
what has been a fairly happy collegial framework," Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy said in a telephone in
terview.
"A lot of those have to be resolved by the scientists act
ing as a professional peer group," he said. "The univer
sities can't . . . bar consulting, and they can't prevent the
formation of successful commercial ventures outside the
institutional framework."
Concern about the relationship of universities to the
gene-splicing business was heightened by the enormous
stock market success of Genentech, Inc., the company
that was formed by biologists at the University of Califor
nia Medical Center in San Francisco, to commercialize the
results of genetic engineering research.
Genentech, which has so far not produced a single prod
uct, recently offered 1.1 million shares to the public, which
snapped them up and made the company worth more than
$750 million at the highest price. The stock is currently
worth about $500 million.
At Harvard, Walter Gilbert, who recently was awarded
the Nobel Prize for his genetic engineering research, is a
founder of another company. Biogen of Switzerland, which
also seeks to market the products of designer genes.
The gold in the hills of genetic engineering has whetted
the appetites of universities from coast to coast. Last

month Derek Bok, president of Harvard, told the faculty
that the university was considering not only investing in
but taking an active hand in the management of, and re
search for, a new genetic engineering company.
Said Kennedy: "I would worry a lot about the univer
sity's role were it to be an equity participant in a company
that had faculty members involved as researchers and-or
persons participating in the governance of that company.
"The university ought to be the kind of institution that is
promoting ideas according to intellectual merit, and not
according to rate of return."
Albert Barber, vice chancellor for research at UCLA,
agreed.
"In terms of freedom of inquiry," he said, "in terms of
having faculty and students work on the broad range of
topics for the advancement of knowledge, the extent to
which a commercial venture would compete in that arena
would divert the university's mission."
Kennedy, Barber and others said that having a univer
sity as the research lab of a private company would be in
imical to its broad intellectual aims.
In the end, Harvard agreed, too.
"The preservation of academic values is a matter of
paramount importance to the university," Bok said in a
statement withdrawing the idea, "and owning shares in
such a company would create a number of potential con
flicts with these values."
But Harvard remains tempted by the potential riches
and refused to slam the door on commercial enterprise.
Licensing — or royalties, at least — is at the heart of
UCLA's suit with Genentech and Hoffman-La Roche,
which have joined forces to manufacture interferon, the
antiviral substance that is thought to have cancer-fighting
properties.
Genentech's interferon production is based on material
derived from a cell line that was discovered at UCLA by
David Golde and Phillip Koeffler in the spring of 1978.
Golde and Koeffler gave the cell line, called KG-1, to
Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute for his re
search. UCLA says Gallo agreed not to give it to anyone
else, a point disputed by Genentech.
In any case, Gallo gave the line to Sidney Pestka of Hoff
man-La Roche, and a derivative of it is now an integral
part of Genentech's interferon-producing process.
UCLA, claiming unauthorized use, is seeking damages.
Genentech and Hoffman-La Roche, in their court pa
pers, maintain that Golde expressly authorized Gallo to
give the material to Pestka.
The university contends that if it loses the case, the
basic scientific enterprise will be damaged.

sity's role were it to be an equity participant in a company
that had faculty members involved as researchers and-or
persons participating in the governance of that company.
"The university ought to be the kind of institution that is
promoting ideas according to intellectual merit, and not
according to rate of return."
Albert Barber, vice chancellor for research at UCLA,
agreed.
"In terms of freedom of inquiry," he said, "in terms of
having faculty and students work on the broad range of
topics for the advancement of knowledge, the extent to
which a commercial venture would compete in that arena
would divert the university's mission."
Kennedy, Barber and others said that having a univer
sity as the research lab of a private company would be in
imical to its broad intellectual aims.
In the end, Harvard agreed, too.
"The preservation of academic values is a matter of
paramount importance to the university," Bok said in a
statement withdrawing the idea, "and owning shares in
such a company would create a number of potential con
flicts with these values."
But Harvard remains tempted by the potential riches
and refused to slam the door on commercial enterprise.
Licensing — or royalties, at least — is at the heart of
UCLA's suit with Genentech and Hoffman-La Roche,
which have joined forces to manufacture interferon, the
antiviral substance that is thought to have cancer-fighting
properties.
Genentech's interferon production is based on material
derived from a cell line that was discovered at UCLA by
David Golde and Phillip Koeffler in the spring of 1978.
Golde and Koeffler gave the cell line, called KG-1, to
Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute for his re
search. UCLA says Gallo agreed not to give it to anyone
else, a point disputed by Genentech.
In any case, Gallo gave the line to Sidney Pestka of Hoff
man-La Roche, and a derivative of it is now an integral
part of Genentech's interferon-producing process.
UCLA, claiming unauthorized use, is seeking damages.
Genentech and Hoffman-La Roche, in their court pa
pers, maintain that Golde expressly authorized Gallo to
give the material to Pestka.
The university contends that if it loses the case, the
basic scientific enterprise will be damaged.
As the science of genetic engineering becomes big busi
ness, making some biochemists multimillionaires, Ameri
can universities are trying to figure out a way to share in
the profits without subverting their academic mission.
Harvard, which last month disclosed that it was think
ing of going into the gene-splicing business for itself, drew
such a firestorm of protest that it announced this week
that it was abandoning the idea.
UCLA, whose researchers casually passed around some
material that they had engineered genetically, is now in
volved in litigation with two companies that are using the
fruits of the research and refusing to pay royalties.
The problem is not new. Only the size of the stakes and
the names of the players are. The computer and elec
tronics industries were spawned at universities, which
shared little in the private profits that were made. But this
is the first time that biologists have had a chance to turn
their research into fortunes, and the universities want a
piece of the action.
For the universities, the situation is fraught with danger
as well as with promise. If UCLA loses its case, there are
fears that the spirit of free and open communication
among scientists will be dealt a mortal blow. If biological
ideas turn out to be worth a lot of money, researchers will
patent first and publish second, if at all.
"There are a set of new ethical strains appearing in
what has been a fairly happy collegial framework," Stan
ford President Donald Kennedy said in a telephone in
terview.
"A lot of those have to be resolved by the scientists act
ing as a professional peer group," he said. "The univer
sities can't . . . bar consulting, and they can't prevent the
formation of successful commercial ventures outside the
institutional framework."
Concern about the relationship of universities to the
gene-splicing business was heightened by the enormous
stock market success of Genentech, Inc., the company
that was formed by biologists at the University of Califor
nia Medical Center in San Francisco, to commercialize the
results of genetic engineering research.
Genentech, which has so far not produced a single prod
uct, recently offered 1.1 million shares to the public, which
snapped them up and made the company worth more than
$750 million at the highest price. The stock is currently
worth about $500 million.
At Harvard, Walter Gilbert, who recently was awarded
the Nobel Prize for his genetic engineering research, is a
founder of another company. Biogen of Switzerland, which
also seeks to market the products of designer genes.
The gold in the hills of genetic engineering has whetted
the appetites of universities from coast to coast. Last

month Derek Bok, president of Harvard, told the faculty
that the university was considering not only investing in
but taking an active hand in the management of, and re
search for, a new genetic engineering company.
