# Soviet pipeline gets U.S. approval
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington —The Carter administration has cleared the way for
one of the biggest Soviet-American business deals ever.
The Caterpillar Tractor Co., under a license the administration
approved on Friday, could end up selling Russia $1 billion in equip
ment for laying a natural-gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Eu
rope.
President-elect Ronald Reagan, who has assailed President Jim
my Carter for imposing only a selective trade embargo on the Sovi
et Union after it invaded Afghanistan, may well take a dim view of
the Caterpillar negotiations.
The main pipeline would run from gas fields in Eastern Siberia to
Western Europe, easing the dependence of NATO allies there on
Middle East oil for energy. The line would branch out from West
Germany to other NATO countries.
Some U. S. military leaders feel the Russia-to-NATO pipelines
could constitute pressure points Moscow could push for advantage
in any East-West crisis.
Trade sanctions
A State Department official who participated in the Caterpillar
review said the administration decided to "validate" the com
pany's export license because the sale would not violate the admin
istration's post-Afghanistan trade sanctions, would not give the So
viet Union anything it could not buy from other nations such as
Japan, and was not considered high technology equipment of any
direct military value.
On the strength of the administration's go-ahead, Soviet officials
flew to the Caterpillar headquarters in Peoria, 111., Monday to look
at the equipment and discuss the possible sale.

Caterpillar figures the full $1 billion sale to the Soviet Union
would mean 2000 jobs for each of the five years.
State Department officials said the White House National Secur
ity Council and the Commerce Department were among the govern
ment agencies that assessed whether the Caterpillar equipment
would violate any of the various export strictures. Asked if Carter
himself made the decision, a State official would say only: "You
can assume it was reviewed at a very high level."
Export act
Pipe-laying equipment was not among the exports embargoed af
ter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, State said. But the
Caterpillar request had to pass muster under the Export Adminis
tration Act of 1979.
Congress, as part of the aftermath of the controversy over the
Carter administration's letting Dresser Industries of Dallas sell so
phisticated oil-drilling equipment to the Soviet Union, said pipe
laying equipment should not be exported without reviewing the for
eign-policy implications.
In a related development West German Finance Minister Hans
Matthoefer said in Bonn Monday that his government was consider
ing underwriting a huge loan to the Soviet Union by a consortium of
German banks to finance construction of the Siberia-to-Europe
pipelines.
The West Germany press reported the loan may be as big as $5.4
billion, to be repaid in gas deliveries. Up to one-third of Germany's
natural gas would come from the Soviet Union once the 3100-mile
pipeline was in place, along with branches to other European coun
tries. according to the West German magazine Der Spiegel.
