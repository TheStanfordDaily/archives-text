## A
						revisionist look at (yawn) Big Game 
### 
Stanford (6-4) versus Cali
fornia (2-8). A Big Game?
Come on now. A Fun Game
hopefully, but a Big
Game . . . forget it. Only
diehard alums, normal eve
ryday college students and
public relations men can re
ally get worked up about as
potentially a zilch game as
this season's Stanford-Cal
matchup.

Commentary

After all. look at all the
thrilling questions tfiat will
be answered this Saturday
afternoon in UC-Berkeley's
Memorial Stadium
☆ Will Stanford play well
enough to earn that all-im
portant Peach Bowl berth
(against none other than the
vaunted Virginia Tech
Hokies)?
☆ Will the Cards' All-Uni
verse sophomore John
Elway imitate Portland
State's Neil Lomax and
throw 17 touchdown passes in
the first quarter?
☆Can the Golden Bears'
Kleenex defense — certainly
one of the worst in captivity
— keep Stanford's mammoth
(6-foot-7. 270 pounds) of
fensive tackle Brian
Holloway out of Cal's de
fensive backfield'.'
☆ Can Stanford's swiss
cheese defense (next-to-last
in the Pacific-10 Conference
in total defense) muffle a
quarterback named J
Torchio?
☆ Can the Bears' un
speakable running "attack"
(92.6 yards per game, 2.9
yards per carry) pick up in a
full game what Georgia
freshman phenom Herschel
Walker manages in a quar
ter?
☆ Will this really be the last

hurrah for the Bears' embat
tled third-year head coach
Roger Theder — whose two
apparent mistakes at Cal
have been to lose 18 of 32
games and care about his
athletes as students (his
predecessor, the more de
vious Mike White, fashioned
a 1975 powerhouse team
around running back Chuck
Muncie. whose class atten

dance was. shall we sav.
spotty'' t
☆Will the Sar < rancisco
Chronicle's Glenn Dickey,
an ardent seeker of Theder s
scalp, finally unleash the
headline he is seemingly
building toward - namelv.
WHY ROGER THEDER
SHOULD DIE"?
About the only thing Cal
can do to hold onto the svm

bolic Axe for a second
straight year is to get lucky
— very lucky.
If Stanford s high-powered
offense gets bogged down
with turnovers, if Stanford's
defense goes completely toes
up. if the injuries thai star
tailback Damn Nelson
i ankle) and All-America
flanker Ken Margerum ihip >
sustained against DSC have

not healed sufficiently, then
maybe — maybe — the Bears
can pull a surprise
Nevertheless, these are
too many ifs Nelson at 80
percent is still good enough
to torture Cal. And if the
Bears' secondary plays to
form, then using Margerum
against them may seem like
so much overkill anyhow If
Kich Campbell (Cal's superb
quarterback) was healthy,
the home team would proba
bly be competitive in this
game Now. even that seems
unlikely.
There is just too much in
centive for Paul Wiggin s
squad to run it up on Cal to
imagine this game going any
other way
With an effort of 112 yards
rushing and three pass recep
tions Saturday. Nelson can
become the first college foot
ball player to gain 1000 yards
and catch 50 passes three
times (only San Jose State's
Gerald Willhite has done it
once). Stanford fans want
this honor for Nelson almost
as much as he wants it
Furthermore, even if the
Peach Bowl is thousands of
miles from Pasadena — both
in geography and prestige —
it is still a bowl game, and
better vet national television
exposure (CBS-TV).
After the 34-9 fiasco
against USC. Elway et al
would greatly appreciate an
other shot at national atten
tion. If this attention can be
had by hammering Cal then
it is likely the Bears will get
theirs Saturday.
If none of this appeals to
you, there is always the Sat
urday TV doubleheader —
Michigan-Ohio State and the
Probation Bowl (USC
UCLA). For this year, at
least, those are Big Games.
