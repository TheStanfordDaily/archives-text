## Player views on Big Game vary

Mention the Big Game to dif
ferent Stanford football
players, and you receive some
different answers.
To some, it is a bitterly waged
war steeped in tradition tooth
ers. it is just a lot of fun. to oth
ers still, it is high-flying emo
tionalism that makes the game
special; and. to some, it is just
another game
W'e give it the same im
portance anybody who's ever
gone to Stanford places in the
game." senior offensive tackle
Brian Hollowav said "I know
that when 1 come across Stan
ford people in the future, they'll
all ask when did 1 graduate and
did we win the Big Game that
year'.' I want those bragging
rights badly."
Kor Holloway. the game is
"an obsession. I'll do anything
in my power to win it. The game
goes beyond friendly competi
tion. There's a deep-seated bit
terness involved.
"That's what made last
year's loss so hard to take."
Holloway continued "If we'd
won the game it would have
made an otherwise unsuccessful
feeling bearable — that's how
much the game can mean. But
losing the game left us with a
painful knot inside us. a disease.
This year, I want to leave that
knot with somebody else. I want
to be able to carry the Axe."
So. for one player, in his last
year on the Farm, the Big Game
means a hard-fought war. with
Stanford tradition serving as in
centive.
But to others, the Big Game is
not so grave a matter. Junior
linebacker Jay Summers, for
one. said. "I don't really feel
any hatred or anything like that
for Cal around Big Game. I get
up for it simply because it's the

most fun game for a football
player at Stanford to play. The
buiid-up around school all the
week before the game puts all
the Stanford people into a really
good frame of mind It's just a
lot of fun to be involved."
To senior kicker Ken Naber,
what distinguishes the Big
Game is the intensity of the
emotion in and all around it.
"As a freshman."' he said, "I
can remember not really under
standing Big Game at first. As
far as i was concerned, it was
just another game. But as the
week wore on. I could feel the
excitement picking up all
around Stanford That's what
makes Big Game — all the emo
tion of the Stanford community
meeting all the emotion of the
Cal community and climaxing
in this one game. And when
you've got that much emotion in
a game, talent doesn't mean a
thing Look back over the his
tory of the Big Game and you'll
see that the teams with the best
talent have not always pre
vailed A game with that
kind of intensity has got to be
fun to play."
So Big Game is a momentous
time for all players, an individ
ually important event, right?
Wrong There are those players
whose understanding of the
event is quite the opposite. Sen
ior flanker Ken Margerum is
one.
" I don't feel any differently
about this game than I do about
any other.'' the All-America
said. "I can't say I want to beat
Cal any more than I wanted to
beat Washington. USCorUCLA.
All the games we play are im
portant."
This might appear surprising,
but Margerum reveals senti
ments that are even more startl
