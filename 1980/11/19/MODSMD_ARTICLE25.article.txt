Stanford was forced to play
the No 1- and No 3- ranked
teams in the nation in last week
end's Wendy's Classic Tour
nament at thie University of the
Pacific, and the results were
predictable Though no slouches
themselves (being ranked 10th
nationallyi. the Cards lost to
USC in the opening round and
UCLA in the consolation round
The top-ranked Trojans
showed no mercy Saturday,
trouncing Stanford 15-3,15-4 and
15-3 Was it the Cat ds'worst loss
this season? "Bv far." coach
Fred Sturm said He called it
"the most embarrassing mo
ment of my sports career, as a
player and a coach
At least the Trojans were at
their best in beating Stanford
For nearly the past month. USC
had been playing without two
key starters. Kathy Steukel and
Anna Maria Lopez Steukel s
loss, in Sturm's opinion, was a
particularly significant one —
"Playing without her would be
like playing without (John)
Elway." the coach said
Steukel and Lopez returned to
face the Cards, however, and
help lead the Trojan rout
Stanford came back strong
against UCLA Sunday, but ul
timately fell in five games.
"It was really good to see that
the players had enough pride —
they were tired of losing.''

Sturm said

respectable opponent of the sea

vious meets to give experience
to the younger swimmers, par
ticularly the freshmen In its
last meet against the Pleasant
Hill AAU club, however, the en
tire team competed, and Dietze
says that the Cards will need a
total effort to beat the Bears

ishing in the nation s top 10 can
be classified as a good team
"Most of the major programs'
goal is to make the top 10."
Dietze explained Cal, with a
lOth-place AIAW finish a year
ago. fills the bill
"Cal would like nothing bet
ter than to win. I'm sure."
Dietze said. "It's not a meet
we're going to take lightly."'
Dietze expects the Bears to be
strong in the breaststroke
events and the freestyle sprints
and distance competitions
As for the Cards. Dietze said
he will "look for a little bit more
out of the older swimmers.''
such as co-captains Patty Spees
and Zena Herrmann One of the
newcomers Dietze will look to
for a strong performance is
walk-on Krissie Bush, who has
been impressive in the 1500-yard

be typical of all Stanford-Cal

Cal, he said he does not treat the Big Game any differently than a
big game.
