### 
New York (AP) — George
Brett. Kansas City's slugging
third baseman who flirted with
the coveted 400 mark in leading
the Royals to their first league
championship in history, was
named yesterday as the Ameri
can League's Most Valuable
Player for the 1980 season.
Brett, whose batting mark
was over 400 late in the season,
finished the with a 390 av
erage — the highest in the major
leagues since Boston's Ted Wil
liams batted 406 in 1941. He was
a runaway winner, receiving 335
points in balloting by the
Baseball Writers' Association
of America.
Brett received 17 first-place
votes, nine seconds and two
thirds from the BBWAA's 28-
inember panel — two from each
league city — in becoming the
first Kansas City player ever to
win the coveted award
Outfielder Reggie Jackson of
the New York Yankees, winner
of the MVP in 1973 when he was

with Oakland, was a distant sec
ond in the balloting this time
with 234 points including five
first-place votes.
Relief ace Goose Gossage of
the Yankees was third with four
first-place ballots and 218
points. Outfielder Willie Wilson
of Kansas City collected one
first-place vote and 169 points
for fourth place. He was fol
lowed by first baseman Cecil
Cooper of the Milwaukee
Brewers with 160 points, first
baseman Eddie Murray of the
Baltimore Orioles with 106
points and catcher Rick Cerone
of the Yankees with one first
place vote and 77 points.
Points were awarded on a
14-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 basis.
Outfielder Don Baylor of the
California Angels, last year's
MVP. did not receive a point in
this season's balloting. He
missed most of the season with
injuries.
Baltimore's Steve Stone, win
ner of the 1980 Cy Young Award
as the league's outstanding
pitcher, finished ninth in the
MVP balloting with 53 points.
The left-handed hitting Brett,
winner of his second American
League batting title — he won in
1976 with a .333 average — had a
legitimate shot at becoming

baseball's first .400 hitter in 39
years until the final two weeks
of the season, when he faltered
slightly.
However, he did produce
some other eye-popping figures.
He tied the major league re
cord for batting average by a
third baseman, matching the
.390 that the legendary John
McGraw hit for Baltimore in
1899.
The 27-year-old Brett became
only the 15th player in American
League history to win both the
batting crown and the slugging
percentage title in the same
year, leading the league with a
.664 slugging mark.
He became the first player
since 1950 to average at least
one run batted in per game for a
player with a minimum of 100
RBI. driving in 118 runs in 117
games. Only Cooper, with 122,
had more RBI than Brett.
The Royals' star also led the
league in on-base percentage
( 461), finished among the
league leaders in seven other of
fensive categories, including
runs scored (87), doubles (33).
triples (9), home runs (24) and
game-winning hits (14), and had
a 30-game hitting streak.
He did all this despite missing
45 games because of injuries.
