Soviets drop booby-traps on Afghans
Peshawar, Pakistan — Soviet helicopters have strewn
much of mountainous eastern Afghanistan with hundreds
of thousands of small, booby-trapped anti-personnel ex
plosives in an apparent attempt to restrict movements of
Afghan guerrillas, according to reports reaching here.
Large-scale drops of the devices were reported in the
border provinces of Paktia and Kunar during the past sev
eral days, according to refugees and insurgents arriving in
Peshawar.
While there is evidence that these explosives are at least

partly responsible for an increase in the number of casual
ties suffered bv guerrilla forces recently, most indications
are that so far. they have failed to significantly cut into the
mobility of the resistance groups.
Initial reports of the Soviet tactic came three to four
months ago when insurgents and refugees traveling from
Paktia reported small, colorful devices along routes link
ing that Afghan border province with neighboring Paki
stan.
They said some looked like toy watches and cameras,
while others were butterfly-shaped. They exploded when
picked up or accidentally kicked, according to the reports.
Other refugee accounts described low-flying helicopters
dropping thousands of small objects.
Members of a guerrilla groups hand-carried two live ex
plosives back to their Peshawar headquarters in a wool
lined basket

Soviets drop booby-traps on Afghans
Peshawar, Pakistan — Soviet helicopters have strewn
much of mountainous eastern Afghanistan with hundreds
of thousands of small, booby-trapped anti-personnel ex
plosives in an apparent attempt to restrict movements of
Afghan guerrillas, according to reports reaching here.
Large-scale drops of the devices were reported in the
border provinces of Paktia and Kunar during the past sev
eral days, according to refugees and insurgents arriving in
Peshawar.
While there is evidence that these explosives are at least

partly responsible for an increase in the number of casual
ties suffered bv guerrilla forces recently, most indications
are that so far. they have failed to significantly cut into the
mobility of the resistance groups.
Initial reports of the Soviet tactic came three to four
months ago when insurgents and refugees traveling from
Paktia reported small, colorful devices along routes link
ing that Afghan border province with neighboring Paki
stan.
They said some looked like toy watches and cameras,
while others were butterfly-shaped. They exploded when
picked up or accidentally kicked, according to the reports.
Other refugee accounts described low-flying helicopters
dropping thousands of small objects.
Members of a guerrilla groups hand-carried two live ex
plosives back to their Peshawar headquarters in a wool
lined basket
