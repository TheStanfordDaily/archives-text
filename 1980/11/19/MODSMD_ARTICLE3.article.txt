# Demand for operating rooms means longer hours at hospital
## 
### David Frank 
The shortage of operating room
space at Stanford Hospital severely
strains surgery schedules, but not
enough to adversely affect the quality
of health care, according to officials
at the Medical Center
Stanford Hospital currently has 16
operating rooms, all of which are used
during peak hours — 7 a m. to 3 p.m.,
Monday through Friday But because
of the backlog of operations. 10 rooms
are used until 7 p.m. on weekdays, ac
cording to Dr. John Collins, chief of
surgery at the hospital.
Despite the evening hours, surgeons
often must scramble for additional op
erating room time when the load of
emergency cases increases This
forces the doctors to delay some other
operations up to several days, which
usually is an emotional burden for the
patients, their families and friends.
"The situation is difficult." Collins
said, ' but we give highest priority to
ensuring the quality of care, and we
are doing a good job of that."
Part of the overcrowding problem
can be attributed to the nature of the
beast. Collins said Stanford Hospital
is an "acute care institution." This
means there is a "much higher per

centage of cases — such as cancer
and heart surgery — requiring a long
er than-average period of time per op
eration and post-operation treatment,
he said
In addition, Collins added, the Hos
pital is a "regional referral" center,
meaning it tends to receive the most
difficult cases from the western Unit
ed States, if not the entire country and
the world "The operations we do are
probably three times as long as in a
community hospital," he added
Yet another difficulty, according to
Dr. William Fielder, deputy chief of
surgery at the hospital, is that Stan
ford Hospital is a private institution
and that it shares its facilties with
community physicians. (60 percent of
the operating time at the hospital goes
to Stanford doctors, and 40 percent
goes to others.)
"Few universities have the dual
function of taking care of university
and community patients, not to men
tion housing a medical school and
high-level research, all in the same
center. That's a big financial and ad
ministrative obligation." Fielder
said
He noted Harvard University as an
example of a school that has "well-de
fined" arrangements for using neigh
boring private and public hospitals for
surgery.
Stanford Hospital's problem,
Fielder said, "is that it is the only ma
jor hospital in the immediate area I
don't think there's another wav. We're

not in San Francisco, where I under
stand there are a number of empty
hospital beds' and more operating
rooms, he said
I don't think there's another way
for Stanford. - ' Fielder concluded.
"I'm just saying we should recognize
that there s only one hospital here "
In efforts to alleviate the over
crowding problems, the Board of
Trustees — who also serve as general
members of the Hospital Corporation
approved a $114 8 million mod
ernization plan last month By 1986,
according to a tentative schedule, the
hospital would get 12 new operating
rooms, and nine to 11 existing rooms
would be renovated, bringing the oper
ating room total to at most 23.
In the meantime, the overcrowding
— and accompanying problems — will
persist.
Dr Collins said it remains a ques
tion how far five to seven new operat
ing rooms will go toward solving the
problems, though hospital officials
are hopeful.
The outlook is not entirely op
timistic. however. Collins noted that
the "pattern of change in health care
for acute care institutions over the
past 20 years has been one of increas
ing need for time in operating rooms"
per case
In addition, he said, the population
of the United States is growing rela
tively older And that, he added, would
mean an increasing need for health
care.

emergency cases increases This
forces the doctors to delay some other
operations up to several days, which
usually is an emotional burden for the
patients, their families and friends.
"The situation is difficult." Collins
said, ' but we give highest priority to
ensuring the quality of care, and we
are doing a good job of that."
Part of the overcrowding problem
can be attributed to the nature of the
beast. Collins said Stanford Hospital
is an "acute care institution." This
means there is a "much higher per

centage of cases — such as cancer
and heart surgery — requiring a long
er than-average period of time per op
eration and post-operation treatment,
he said
In addition, Collins added, the Hos
pital is a "regional referral" center,
meaning it tends to receive the most
difficult cases from the western Unit
ed States, if not the entire country and
the world "The operations we do are
probably three times as long as in a
community hospital," he added
Yet another difficulty, according to
Dr. William Fielder, deputy chief of
surgery at the hospital, is that Stan
ford Hospital is a private institution
and that it shares its facilties with
community physicians. (60 percent of
the operating time at the hospital goes
to Stanford doctors, and 40 percent
goes to others.)
"Few universities have the dual
function of taking care of university
and community patients, not to men
tion housing a medical school and
high-level research, all in the same
center. That's a big financial and ad
ministrative obligation." Fielder
said
He noted Harvard University as an
example of a school that has "well-de
fined" arrangements for using neigh
boring private and public hospitals for
surgery.
Stanford Hospital's problem,
Fielder said, "is that it is the only ma
jor hospital in the immediate area I
don't think there's another wav. We're

not in San Francisco, where I under
stand there are a number of empty
hospital beds' and more operating
rooms, he said
I don't think there's another way
for Stanford. - ' Fielder concluded.
"I'm just saying we should recognize
that there s only one hospital here "
In efforts to alleviate the over
crowding problems, the Board of
Trustees — who also serve as general
members of the Hospital Corporation
approved a $114 8 million mod
ernization plan last month By 1986,
according to a tentative schedule, the
hospital would get 12 new operating
rooms, and nine to 11 existing rooms
would be renovated, bringing the oper
ating room total to at most 23.
In the meantime, the overcrowding
— and accompanying problems — will
persist.
Dr Collins said it remains a ques
tion how far five to seven new operat
ing rooms will go toward solving the
problems, though hospital officials
are hopeful.
The outlook is not entirely op
timistic. however. Collins noted that
the "pattern of change in health care
for acute care institutions over the
past 20 years has been one of increas
ing need for time in operating rooms"
per case
In addition, he said, the population
of the United States is growing rela
tively older And that, he added, would
mean an increasing need for health
care.
The shortage of operating room
space at Stanford Hospital severely
strains surgery schedules, but not
enough to adversely affect the quality
of health care, according to officials
at the Medical Center
Stanford Hospital currently has 16
operating rooms, all of which are used
during peak hours — 7 a m. to 3 p.m.,
Monday through Friday But because
of the backlog of operations. 10 rooms
are used until 7 p.m. on weekdays, ac
cording to Dr. John Collins, chief of
surgery at the hospital.
Despite the evening hours, surgeons
often must scramble for additional op
erating room time when the load of
emergency cases increases This
forces the doctors to delay some other
operations up to several days, which
usually is an emotional burden for the
patients, their families and friends.
