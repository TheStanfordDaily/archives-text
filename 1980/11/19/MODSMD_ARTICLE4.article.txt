# Foreign language study changes debated

Declining enrollment in foreign lan
guage courses has led the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) to
consider ways of encourag
ing language study.
Following national trends, foreign
language enrollment has declined
here since the University dropped the
language requirement for all students
in 1969. More recently, foreign lan
guage courses have been eliminated
from the list of courses which fulfill
the humanities distribution require
ment because these classes do not
teach enough literature or linguistics.
Although some faculty members
feel that including more literature in
introductory language courses would
solve this problem. Prof. Ralph
Hester, who chairs the French and
Italian department, disagrees.
He said students are motivated by
"the desire to be able to communicate
in a language — to understand and to
speak it." More literature at an early
stage, he argued, would "go against
the grain and kill off the motivation to
speak."
Assoc. History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee. who chairs the CUS, said it is
difficult to add distribution require
ments because "students with techni
cal majors such as engineering don't
have room in their schedules."
But one petroleum engineering stu
dent. while admitting he had too many
requirements, said he would like to
study another language anyway. He
said he was discouraged, though, be
cause "employers question the value
of language study for an engineering
curriculum."

The student added that the engi
neering departments are "career ori
ented and not oriented toward educa
tion — they adopt the same attitude as
the employers."
Because of the difficulty of includ
ing language courses in the distribu
tion requirements, the CUS is explor
ing other possible incentives to in
crease foreign language proficiency.
One possibility is to make prior for
eign language study a requirement for
admission to the University. Another
is to make proficiency a requirement
for graduation
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon
does not consider an entrance require
ment a viable alternative. Most stu
dents here have already had language
courses anyway, he said, because only
those students with the strongest
academic programs are selected for
admission
Hargadon added that he considers it
"unnecessary" to try to "persuade
secondary schools to do more in lan
guage training when they are facing a
funding crisis."
Formalizing the admissions re
quirements is unlikely, according to
Hester, because "the faculty here is
skeptical of the real value of high
school courses." He said he too sees
"great differences in language in
struction at the high school level."
Hester instead argued that the most
meaningful incentive would be a profi
ciency requirement which students
could choose how to fulfill.
Prof Elizabeth Traugott, who
chairs the linguistics department,
also favors a simple proficiency re
quirement which could be fulfilled
"here or elsewhere."
Another idea, posted by Prof. Rob
ert Keohane. chairman of the political
science department, is to tie language
experience with admittance to certain
seminars.
He said he opposes language course
requirements not only because there
are some people for whom it would be
inappropriate, but also because
"there will be guaranteed resistance
just because it is a requirement."
Most other schools require a min
imum amount of class time devoted to
languages. Under UC-Berkeley's new
requirements, students must have
three years of language study prior to
entrance or must complete an
equivalent amount while they are en
rolled.
