# Reagan ready to raid Institution
## What hath Hoover wrought? 
### Samuel Howe 
Back in April 1928, when Stan
ford was still the senator's "col
lege on a farm" and the women all
lived in Roble and the men in En
cina, an alumnus wrote to the
Stanford Illustrated magazine to
urge those with any ties to the Uni
versity to support Herbert Hoo
ver's quest for the presidency:
"Hoover's candidacy ... is an
event which cannot fail to excite
the interests of every Stanford
graduate.
"The truth about Hoover is
enough, and its general acceptance
and approval by Stanford gradu
ates will materially help his
chances."
The letter, written by John
Switzer of New York City, an 1898
Graduate, went on to urge all Stan
ord graduates to make the Univer
sity "unanimous" for Hoover.
Switzer also said that whenever a
graduate of a University runs for
such a high public office, "it has
become custom for practically

every man and woman from his
school, even almost regardless of
previous party affiliations, to
throw their influence to his cause.
It may be several generations
before Stanford men and women
again have the opportunity to work
for one of their fellow graduates
for the presidency. It is one op
portunity in a lifetime."
Switzer has been correct so far.
Although John Kennedy was a vis
iting student here in 1940 and vari
ous alumni such as Frank Church
have declared for the nation's
highest office, no Stanford gradu
ate since Herbert Hoover has
made a serious run for the presi
dency.
However, in just two months, a
69-year-old honorary fellow at
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, which
President Hoover founded, will as
sume the office. He is expected to
bring with him to Washington at
least a few advisers from the In
stitution.

Thus, Stanford will receive a
share of publicity in the new ad
ministration approaching that the
University enjoyed, or endured,
during Hoover's tenure.
Herbert Hoovet- made use of
Stanford in a way more nostalgic
than anything else. He returned to
the University often, and had built
a house for himself on the campus
a few years before he became pres
ident. To an audience of several
thousand in Stanford Stadium, he
made his acceptance speech for
the Republican nomination, in Au
gust 1928, and on the day of the No
vember election he voted in Palo
Alto.
When, by evening, it had become
clear that Hoover had won the elec
tion, the Stanford band and
thousands of Stanford students
gathered outside his house on cam
pus for a rally, according to a con
temporary report in Liberty maga
zine. "The lights were turned full
upon them and the band played a

And in a 1928 letter. Robert Lit
tler. chairman of the Stanford Uni
versity Hoover Club, said that "as
a college student 'Hoover) sat at
the feet of (first Stanford Presi
dent i David Starr Jordan As a
world statesman, many of Hoo
ver's ideas are traceable to the
germ of that early inspiration."
Ronald Reagan's ties to the Uni
versity are not so lofty, and his af
fection is not quite the love affair
which Herbert Hoover engaged in
during his long life. The ties are

certainly consequential, as mem
bers of the Hoover Institution,
which has gained international
prominence as a conservative
think tank." are expected to play
a large role in shaping the presi
dent-elect's policy.
However, during Hoover's can
didacy. and to a certain extent af
ter his election. Stanford was a
large factor in the candidate's
mystique, and that was certainly a
unique experience for the student
body at the time.
According to another contem
porary report by Squire Behrens. a
graduate of the 1914 class. "Stan
ford University suddenly became
the political center of the Re
publican party" when Hoover ar
rived on campus on July 20.1928. to
wait for the news of his nomi
nation.
When candidate settled down to
campaign business, he did a lot of it
on the grounds of the University.
Decisions were made here, con
ferences held and receptions
hosted, according to Behren s arti
cle.
Hoover was fond of fishing trips
and other vacations with Wilbur
among other Stanford friends, and

in 1931 he held a reunion at the the
White House for the 1894 fotball
team of which he had been man
ager.
Although the University was rel
atively new and without great na
tional reputation. Hoover did give
Stanford prominence if only by his
attention to the place, and he cer
tainly augmented the stature of the
school's president by putting him
in the cabinet.
After his defeat at the polls in
1932. Hoover returned to work on
the Hoover War Library here, and
soon changed its name to the Hoo
ver Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace.
To whatever extent he used the
University while he was president,
politically or symbolically, it does
seem clear that Hoover's tenure
was approached with more en
thusiasm than students now are
willing to accord to President
elect Reagan. But whether future
generations of Stanford students
will actually get to judge the mer
its of a fellow alumnus for the na
tion's top political office remains
to be seen.
