# Reagan ready to raid Institution
## What hath Hoover wrought? 
### Samuel Howe 
Back in April 1928, when Stan
ford was still the senator's "col
lege on a farm" and the women all
lived in Roble and the men in En
cina, an alumnus wrote to the
Stanford Illustrated magazine to
urge those with any ties to the Uni
versity to support Herbert Hoo
ver's quest for the presidency:
"Hoover's candidacy ... is an
event which cannot fail to excite
the interests of every Stanford
graduate.
"The truth about Hoover is
enough, and its general acceptance
and approval by Stanford gradu
ates will materially help his
chances."
The letter, written by John
Switzer of New York City, an 1898
Graduate, went on to urge all Stan
ord graduates to make the Univer
sity "unanimous" for Hoover.
Switzer also said that whenever a
graduate of a University runs for
such a high public office, "it has
become custom for practically

every man and woman from his
school, even almost regardless of
previous party affiliations, to
throw their influence to his cause.
It may be several generations
before Stanford men and women
again have the opportunity to work
for one of their fellow graduates
for the presidency. It is one op
portunity in a lifetime."
Switzer has been correct so far.
Although John Kennedy was a vis
iting student here in 1940 and vari
ous alumni such as Frank Church
have declared for the nation's
highest office, no Stanford gradu
ate since Herbert Hoover has
made a serious run for the presi
dency.
However, in just two months, a
69-year-old honorary fellow at
Stanford's Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution and Peace, which
President Hoover founded, will as
sume the office. He is expected to
bring with him to Washington at
least a few advisers from the In
stitution.

Thus, Stanford will receive a
share of publicity in the new ad
ministration approaching that the
University enjoyed, or endured,
during Hoover's tenure.
Herbert Hoovet- made use of
Stanford in a way more nostalgic
than anything else. He returned to
the University often, and had built
a house for himself on the campus
a few years before he became pres
ident. To an audience of several
thousand in Stanford Stadium, he
made his acceptance speech for
the Republican nomination, in Au
gust 1928, and on the day of the No
vember election he voted in Palo
Alto.
When, by evening, it had become
clear that Hoover had won the elec
tion, the Stanford band and
thousands of Stanford students
gathered outside his house on cam
pus for a rally, according to a con
temporary report in Liberty maga
zine. "The lights were turned full
upon them and the band played a
