Modern methods of birth con
trol allow people to make
choices about pregnancy and
family planning Many options
are available to suit individual
needs
A frequently asked question
about contraception is "how ef
fective is it?' The answers tend
to be confusing and inconsis
tent. because two effectiveness
rates have been determined for
each method
Theoretical effectiveness re
fers to the maximum effective
ness — when the method is used
consistently and without error
Actual use effectiveness in
cludes human error and care
lessness

ual for medical personnel, coun
selors and laypeople compiled
by doctors and health
educators It provides a com
plete overview of available
birth control methods, and is the
primary source of information
for this article
The Pill
The combined oral contracep
tive. generally known as "the
Pill." is a popular and highly ef
fective method of contracep
tion. (Theoretical: 99.6 percent:
Use: 90 to 96 percent i Accord
ing to Contraceptive Technolo
gy, "The Pill is now used by 25 to
50 million women throughout
the world including some five to
eight million women in the Unit
ed States "
The combined pill contains
synthetic female hormones,
estrogen and progestin, which
alter the natural hormone levels
and inhibit egg development.
Correct usage involves a conti

nuing sequence of taking one pill
every day for 21 days and then
taking either a placebo or no pill
for seven days A medical pre
scription is required
The Pill has been available to
the public for only 15 years and
long-term side effects have not
been conclusively evaluated
Studies do indicate a greater oc
currence of blood clots, strokes
and heart attacks These risks
increase for smokers and wom
en over 35
Minor side effects are com
mon Contraceptive Technolo
gy reports About 40 percent of
Pill users have side effects of
one kind or another." Users
may experience nausea, weight
gain, mood changes and an in
crease or decrease in acne Ben
eficial side effects include
lessened menstrual cramps, de
creased flow and regular peri
ods
Mini-pill
Many of the adverse side ef
fects of the combined pill are
due to its estrogen content Pro
gestin only "mini-pills'" can al
ternatively be prescribed The
effectiveness of this method is
slightly lower than that of the
Pill (Theoretical 99 percent:
Use: 90 to 95 percent). Com
plications often include ir
regular flow and duration of
menstrual periods.
lUD
Intrauterine devices are
small plastic devices inserted
into a woman's uterus. Effec
tiveness rates are high. (Theo
retical: 97 to 99 percent; Use:
95 percent). The mechanism of
the lUD is not fully known It
may act as a mechanical bar
rier to the fertilized egg, pre
venting its implantation in the
uterine wall, or it may react
with the woman's body to pre
vent implantation
A prescription is required,
and insertion must be done by
trained technicians Once in
serted, a woman needs only to

check periodically that it is still
in place Replacement is neces
sary ever one to five years de
pending on the type of lUD Cur
rently five types of lUD have
PDA approval
Side effects commonly in
clude increased menstrual
cramping and flow Increased
incidences of pelvic inflam
matory disease and ectopic
pregnancies (implantation out
side of the uterusi have also
been reported
Diaphragm
"In 1882. when invented, the
diaphragm was a major break
through in the liberation of
women from unwanted preg
nancies.'' reported the Boston
Women's Health Collective in
the book Our Bodies, Ourselves
Diaphragms continue to be a
popular means of contracep
tion. Theoretical effectiveness
is estimated at 97 percent, while
the actual use rate isB3 percent.
A diaphragm is a dome
shaped rubber cup with a flex
ible rim It is filled with a
spermicidal cream or jelly and
then placed into the vagina at
the opening of the uterus The
diaphragm itself is an in
complete mechanical barrier,
but the spermicidal agents pre
vent sperm from further travel.
Correct usage includes addi
tional applications of
spermicidal agents before each
successive act of intercourse.
The diaphragm should be left in
place for six hours after sexual
activity.
The diaphragm requires a
prescription and must be fitted
by a trained clinician. One will
generally last about two years.
Side effects are minimal.
Some find the use of a
diaphragm disrupts sexual
spontaneity, and women often
cite the post-coital discharge of
spermicidal agents as an an
noyance.
A method currently used out
side of the United States is the

cervical cap This works as a
mechanical barrier much in the
same way as the diaphragm
Though it has not yet received
FDA approval, some doctors in
the United States have begun to
prescribe it
Condom
The condom is a method of
contraception worn by the man
It is a sheath, made of thin rub
ber or animal tissue that is
placed over the erect penis !o
prevent sperm from entering
the woman's body When used
alone, the theoretical effective
ness rate is 97 percent, use rate
90 percent. Effectiveness in
creases when the condom is
used in conjunction with
spermicidal foam (Theo
retical: 99 percent; Use: 95
percent).
Condoms are inexpensive and
can be obtained at a drugstore
without a prescription They are
also useful in preventing trans
mission of venereal disease
The disadvantage cited most
frequently by men is decreased
sensitivity. In addition, some
couples object to interrupting
foreplay to put on the condom
Vaginal spermicides
Vaginal spermicides come in
a variety of forms: creams,
jellies, suppositories and foam.
Jellies and creams are general
ly used in conjunction with the
diaphragm, while foam and sup
positories can be used alone as
complete contraceptive meth
ods.
Theoretical effectiveness for
foam is 97 percent; use effec
tiveness is 78 percent The theo
retical rate for suppositories is
97 percent, also. User rates are
75 to 80 percent
Foam is inserted into the
vagina with an applicator prior
to intercourse. Suppositories
placed deep within the vagina
spread their spermicide either
by melting or effervescing.
These require no prescrip
tion.

Fertility awareness methods
focus on cyclic signals of fertili
ty in a woman's body During
fertile periods, abstinence is ad
vocated rather than mechanical
or chemical devices
The calendar, or rhythm,
method predicts future fertility
based on past menstrual record
Cyclic irregularities can cause
method failure (Theoretical:
87 percent; Use 79 percent).
The basal body temperature
method relies on the fact that
most women experience a slight
rise in temperature at their
most fertile point, ovulation
This method does not predict ov
ulation; thus, effectiveness
rates can be increased when the
method is used in coordination
with the calendar method When
used alone, theoretical effec
tiveness is 93 percent, and use
effectiveness is 80 percent.
Sterilization
A more permanent approach
to birth control is voluntary
sterilization Though not per
fectly effective. 100 percent ef
fectiveness is approached. Ster
ilization generally is not re
versible.
The most common method of
male sterilization is the vasec
tomy. This operation involves
cutting and sealing the sperm
transport tubes. This is usually
performed in a doctor's office,
and the man walks out after a
brief recovery period. Com

plication rates are low
A comparable operation for
women is the tubal ligation In
this case, the egg transport
tubes are cut and cauterized
The operation can be performed
through two small abdominal
incisions or through the
vagina A slightly greater in
cidence of complications is as
sociated with the vaginal ap
proach
Withdrawal
Coitus interruptus. or the
withdrawal method, has long
been used as a contraceptive
technique Prior to ejaculation,
the man withdraws his penis.
The theoretical effectiveness is
91 percent, while actual use
rates are 75-85 percent
This method has distinct ad
vantages. It requires no prior
planning, no devices or
chemicals It is not reliable,
however, as a regular method of
birth control. Pre-ejaculatorv
fluids often contain enough
sperm to cause pregnancy
Post-coital methods
The morning-after pill is used
as an emergency measure in the
instance of unprotected mid
cycle intercourse. "It is not a
regular method of birth con
trol.'' according to Contracep
tive Technology. This treat
ment involves a series of high
doses of synthetic estrogen
which inhibit implantation by
the fertilized egg
Side effects include severe

nausea and vomiting If the
treatment is unsuccessful,
many doctors urge a thera
peutic abortion because of the
fetus' exposure to high levels of
hormones
No long-term adverse side ef
fects on the users have been
demonstrated
Abortion is another post
coital method of preventing un
wanted births The type of oper
ation performed depends on how
far the pregnancy has
progressed Karlv operations
tend to be easier to perform,
safer, less expensive, and less
physically and emotionally
traumatic for the woman. Sec
ond trimester abortions gener
ally involve hospitalization and
greater risks Abortions are
rarely performed after the sec
ond trimester unless the wom
an's health demands it.
New methods
A great deal of research is
being conducted developing and
testing new methods. Chemical
inhibition of sperm production
and motility, as well as internal
reversible barriers, are being
studied as methods of male con
traception Most of these meth
ods are still in the developmen
tal stages.
For women, much of the re
search centers around new
methods of application or inges
tion of synthetic hormones.
Many of these methods are al
ready being tested

birth control methods, and is the

The Pill
The combined oral contracep
tive. generally known as "the
Pill." is a popular and highly ef
fective method of contracep
tion. (Theoretical: 99.6 percent:
Use: 90 to 96 percent i Accord
ing to Contraceptive Technolo
gy, "The Pill is now used by 25 to
50 million women throughout
the world including some five to
eight million women in the Unit
ed States "
The combined pill contains
synthetic female hormones,
estrogen and progestin, which
alter the natural hormone levels
and inhibit egg development.
Correct usage involves a conti

nuing sequence of taking one pill
every day for 21 days and then
taking either a placebo or no pill
for seven days A medical pre
scription is required
The Pill has been available to
the public for only 15 years and
long-term side effects have not
been conclusively evaluated
Studies do indicate a greater oc
currence of blood clots, strokes
and heart attacks These risks
increase for smokers and wom
en over 35
Minor side effects are com
mon Contraceptive Technolo
gy reports About 40 percent of
Pill users have side effects of
one kind or another." Users
may experience nausea, weight
gain, mood changes and an in
crease or decrease in acne Ben
eficial side effects include
lessened menstrual cramps, de
creased flow and regular peri
ods
Mini-pill
Many of the adverse side ef
fects of the combined pill are
due to its estrogen content Pro
gestin only "mini-pills'" can al
ternatively be prescribed The
effectiveness of this method is
slightly lower than that of the
Pill (Theoretical 99 percent:
Use: 90 to 95 percent). Com
plications often include ir
regular flow and duration of
menstrual periods.
lUD
Intrauterine devices are
small plastic devices inserted
into a woman's uterus. Effec
tiveness rates are high. (Theo
retical: 97 to 99 percent; Use:
95 percent). The mechanism of
the lUD is not fully known It
may act as a mechanical bar
rier to the fertilized egg, pre
venting its implantation in the
uterine wall, or it may react
with the woman's body to pre
vent implantation
A prescription is required,
and insertion must be done by
trained technicians Once in
serted, a woman needs only to

check periodically that it is still
in place Replacement is neces
sary ever one to five years de
pending on the type of lUD Cur
rently five types of lUD have
PDA approval
Side effects commonly in
clude increased menstrual
cramping and flow Increased
incidences of pelvic inflam
matory disease and ectopic
pregnancies (implantation out
side of the uterusi have also
been reported
Diaphragm
"In 1882. when invented, the
diaphragm was a major break
through in the liberation of
women from unwanted preg
nancies.'' reported the Boston
Women's Health Collective in
the book Our Bodies, Ourselves
Diaphragms continue to be a
popular means of contracep
tion. Theoretical effectiveness
is estimated at 97 percent, while
the actual use rate isB3 percent.
A diaphragm is a dome
shaped rubber cup with a flex
ible rim It is filled with a
spermicidal cream or jelly and
then placed into the vagina at
the opening of the uterus The
diaphragm itself is an in
complete mechanical barrier,
but the spermicidal agents pre
vent sperm from further travel.
Correct usage includes addi
tional applications of
spermicidal agents before each
successive act of intercourse.
The diaphragm should be left in
place for six hours after sexual
activity.
The diaphragm requires a
prescription and must be fitted
by a trained clinician. One will
generally last about two years.
Side effects are minimal.
Some find the use of a
diaphragm disrupts sexual
spontaneity, and women often
cite the post-coital discharge of
spermicidal agents as an an
noyance.
A method currently used out
side of the United States is the

cervical cap This works as a
mechanical barrier much in the
same way as the diaphragm
Though it has not yet received
FDA approval, some doctors in
the United States have begun to
prescribe it
Condom
The condom is a method of
contraception worn by the man
It is a sheath, made of thin rub
ber or animal tissue that is
placed over the erect penis !o
prevent sperm from entering
the woman's body When used
alone, the theoretical effective
ness rate is 97 percent, use rate
90 percent. Effectiveness in
creases when the condom is
used in conjunction with
spermicidal foam (Theo
retical: 99 percent; Use: 95
percent).
Condoms are inexpensive and
can be obtained at a drugstore
without a prescription They are
also useful in preventing trans
mission of venereal disease
The disadvantage cited most
frequently by men is decreased
sensitivity. In addition, some
couples object to interrupting
foreplay to put on the condom
Vaginal spermicides
Vaginal spermicides come in
a variety of forms: creams,
jellies, suppositories and foam.
Jellies and creams are general
ly used in conjunction with the
diaphragm, while foam and sup
positories can be used alone as
complete contraceptive meth
ods.
Theoretical effectiveness for
foam is 97 percent; use effec
tiveness is 78 percent The theo
retical rate for suppositories is
97 percent, also. User rates are
75 to 80 percent
Foam is inserted into the
vagina with an applicator prior
to intercourse. Suppositories
placed deep within the vagina
spread their spermicide either
by melting or effervescing.
These require no prescrip
tion.

Fertility awareness methods
focus on cyclic signals of fertili
ty in a woman's body During
fertile periods, abstinence is ad
vocated rather than mechanical
or chemical devices
The calendar, or rhythm,
method predicts future fertility
based on past menstrual record
Cyclic irregularities can cause
method failure (Theoretical:
87 percent; Use 79 percent).
The basal body temperature
method relies on the fact that
most women experience a slight
rise in temperature at their
most fertile point, ovulation
This method does not predict ov
ulation; thus, effectiveness
rates can be increased when the
method is used in coordination
with the calendar method When
used alone, theoretical effec
tiveness is 93 percent, and use
effectiveness is 80 percent.
Sterilization
A more permanent approach
to birth control is voluntary
sterilization Though not per
fectly effective. 100 percent ef
fectiveness is approached. Ster
ilization generally is not re
versible.
The most common method of
male sterilization is the vasec
tomy. This operation involves
cutting and sealing the sperm
transport tubes. This is usually
performed in a doctor's office,
and the man walks out after a
brief recovery period. Com

plication rates are low
A comparable operation for
women is the tubal ligation In
this case, the egg transport
tubes are cut and cauterized
The operation can be performed
through two small abdominal
incisions or through the
vagina A slightly greater in
cidence of complications is as
sociated with the vaginal ap
proach
Withdrawal
Coitus interruptus. or the
withdrawal method, has long
been used as a contraceptive
technique Prior to ejaculation,
the man withdraws his penis.
The theoretical effectiveness is
91 percent, while actual use
rates are 75-85 percent
This method has distinct ad
vantages. It requires no prior
planning, no devices or
chemicals It is not reliable,
however, as a regular method of
birth control. Pre-ejaculatorv
fluids often contain enough
sperm to cause pregnancy
Post-coital methods
The morning-after pill is used
as an emergency measure in the
instance of unprotected mid
cycle intercourse. "It is not a
regular method of birth con
trol.'' according to Contracep
tive Technology. This treat
ment involves a series of high
doses of synthetic estrogen
which inhibit implantation by
the fertilized egg
Side effects include severe

nausea and vomiting If the
treatment is unsuccessful,
many doctors urge a thera
peutic abortion because of the
fetus' exposure to high levels of
hormones
No long-term adverse side ef
fects on the users have been
demonstrated
Abortion is another post
coital method of preventing un
wanted births The type of oper
ation performed depends on how
far the pregnancy has
progressed Karlv operations
tend to be easier to perform,
safer, less expensive, and less
physically and emotionally
traumatic for the woman. Sec
ond trimester abortions gener
ally involve hospitalization and
greater risks Abortions are
rarely performed after the sec
ond trimester unless the wom
an's health demands it.
New methods
A great deal of research is
being conducted developing and
testing new methods. Chemical
inhibition of sperm production
and motility, as well as internal
reversible barriers, are being
studied as methods of male con
traception Most of these meth
ods are still in the developmen
tal stages.
For women, much of the re
search centers around new
methods of application or inges
tion of synthetic hormones.
Many of these methods are al
ready being tested

Modern methods of birth con
trol allow people to make
choices about pregnancy and

are available to suit individual
needs

birth control methods, and is the
primary source of information
for this article
The Pill
The combined oral contracep
tive. generally known as "the
Pill." is a popular and highly ef
fective method of contracep
tion. (Theoretical: 99.6 percent:
Use: 90 to 96 percent i Accord
ing to Contraceptive Technolo
gy, "The Pill is now used by 25 to
50 million women throughout
the world including some five to
eight million women in the Unit
ed States "
The combined pill contains
synthetic female hormones,
estrogen and progestin, which
alter the natural hormone levels
and inhibit egg development.
Correct usage involves a conti

nuing sequence of taking one pill
every day for 21 days and then
taking either a placebo or no pill
for seven days A medical pre
scription is required
The Pill has been available to
the public for only 15 years and
long-term side effects have not
been conclusively evaluated
Studies do indicate a greater oc
currence of blood clots, strokes
and heart attacks These risks
increase for smokers and wom
en over 35
Minor side effects are com
mon Contraceptive Technolo
gy reports About 40 percent of
Pill users have side effects of
one kind or another." Users
may experience nausea, weight
gain, mood changes and an in
crease or decrease in acne Ben
eficial side effects include
lessened menstrual cramps, de
creased flow and regular peri
ods
Mini-pill
Many of the adverse side ef
fects of the combined pill are
due to its estrogen content Pro
gestin only "mini-pills'" can al
ternatively be prescribed The
effectiveness of this method is
slightly lower than that of the
Pill (Theoretical 99 percent:
Use: 90 to 95 percent). Com
plications often include ir
regular flow and duration of
menstrual periods.
lUD
Intrauterine devices are
small plastic devices inserted
into a woman's uterus. Effec
tiveness rates are high. (Theo
retical: 97 to 99 percent; Use:
95 percent). The mechanism of
the lUD is not fully known It
may act as a mechanical bar
rier to the fertilized egg, pre
venting its implantation in the
uterine wall, or it may react
with the woman's body to pre
vent implantation
A prescription is required,
and insertion must be done by
trained technicians Once in
serted, a woman needs only to

check periodically that it is still
in place Replacement is neces
sary ever one to five years de
pending on the type of lUD Cur
rently five types of lUD have
PDA approval
Side effects commonly in
clude increased menstrual
cramping and flow Increased
incidences of pelvic inflam
matory disease and ectopic
pregnancies (implantation out
side of the uterusi have also
been reported
Diaphragm
"In 1882. when invented, the
diaphragm was a major break
through in the liberation of
women from unwanted preg
nancies.'' reported the Boston
Women's Health Collective in
the book Our Bodies, Ourselves
Diaphragms continue to be a
popular means of contracep
tion. Theoretical effectiveness
is estimated at 97 percent, while
the actual use rate isB3 percent.
A diaphragm is a dome
shaped rubber cup with a flex
ible rim It is filled with a
spermicidal cream or jelly and
then placed into the vagina at
the opening of the uterus The
diaphragm itself is an in
complete mechanical barrier,
but the spermicidal agents pre
vent sperm from further travel.
Correct usage includes addi
tional applications of
spermicidal agents before each
successive act of intercourse.
The diaphragm should be left in
place for six hours after sexual
activity.
The diaphragm requires a
prescription and must be fitted
by a trained clinician. One will
generally last about two years.
Side effects are minimal.
Some find the use of a
diaphragm disrupts sexual
spontaneity, and women often
cite the post-coital discharge of
spermicidal agents as an an
noyance.
A method currently used out
side of the United States is the

cervical cap This works as a
mechanical barrier much in the
same way as the diaphragm
Though it has not yet received
FDA approval, some doctors in
the United States have begun to
prescribe it
Condom
The condom is a method of
contraception worn by the man
It is a sheath, made of thin rub
ber or animal tissue that is
placed over the erect penis !o
prevent sperm from entering
the woman's body When used
alone, the theoretical effective
ness rate is 97 percent, use rate
90 percent. Effectiveness in
creases when the condom is
used in conjunction with
spermicidal foam (Theo
retical: 99 percent; Use: 95
percent).
Condoms are inexpensive and
can be obtained at a drugstore
without a prescription They are
also useful in preventing trans
mission of venereal disease
The disadvantage cited most
frequently by men is decreased
sensitivity. In addition, some
couples object to interrupting
foreplay to put on the condom
Vaginal spermicides
Vaginal spermicides come in
a variety of forms: creams,
jellies, suppositories and foam.
Jellies and creams are general
ly used in conjunction with the
diaphragm, while foam and sup
positories can be used alone as
complete contraceptive meth
ods.
Theoretical effectiveness for
foam is 97 percent; use effec
tiveness is 78 percent The theo
retical rate for suppositories is
97 percent, also. User rates are
75 to 80 percent
Foam is inserted into the
vagina with an applicator prior
to intercourse. Suppositories
placed deep within the vagina
spread their spermicide either
by melting or effervescing.
These require no prescrip
tion.

Fertility awareness methods
focus on cyclic signals of fertili
ty in a woman's body During
fertile periods, abstinence is ad
vocated rather than mechanical
or chemical devices
The calendar, or rhythm,
method predicts future fertility
based on past menstrual record
Cyclic irregularities can cause
method failure (Theoretical:
87 percent; Use 79 percent).
The basal body temperature
method relies on the fact that
most women experience a slight
rise in temperature at their
most fertile point, ovulation
This method does not predict ov
ulation; thus, effectiveness
rates can be increased when the
method is used in coordination
with the calendar method When
used alone, theoretical effec
tiveness is 93 percent, and use
effectiveness is 80 percent.
Sterilization
A more permanent approach
to birth control is voluntary
sterilization Though not per
fectly effective. 100 percent ef
fectiveness is approached. Ster
ilization generally is not re
versible.
The most common method of
male sterilization is the vasec
tomy. This operation involves
cutting and sealing the sperm
transport tubes. This is usually
performed in a doctor's office,
and the man walks out after a
brief recovery period. Com

plication rates are low
A comparable operation for
women is the tubal ligation In
this case, the egg transport
tubes are cut and cauterized
The operation can be performed
through two small abdominal
incisions or through the
vagina A slightly greater in
cidence of complications is as
sociated with the vaginal ap
proach
Withdrawal
Coitus interruptus. or the
withdrawal method, has long
been used as a contraceptive
technique Prior to ejaculation,
the man withdraws his penis.
The theoretical effectiveness is
91 percent, while actual use
rates are 75-85 percent
This method has distinct ad
vantages. It requires no prior
planning, no devices or
chemicals It is not reliable,
however, as a regular method of
birth control. Pre-ejaculatorv
fluids often contain enough
sperm to cause pregnancy
Post-coital methods
The morning-after pill is used
as an emergency measure in the
instance of unprotected mid
cycle intercourse. "It is not a
regular method of birth con
trol.'' according to Contracep
tive Technology. This treat
ment involves a series of high
doses of synthetic estrogen
which inhibit implantation by
the fertilized egg
Side effects include severe

nausea and vomiting If the
treatment is unsuccessful,
many doctors urge a thera
peutic abortion because of the
fetus' exposure to high levels of
hormones
No long-term adverse side ef
fects on the users have been
demonstrated
Abortion is another post
coital method of preventing un
wanted births The type of oper
ation performed depends on how
far the pregnancy has
progressed Karlv operations
tend to be easier to perform,
safer, less expensive, and less
physically and emotionally
traumatic for the woman. Sec
ond trimester abortions gener
ally involve hospitalization and
greater risks Abortions are
rarely performed after the sec
ond trimester unless the wom
an's health demands it.
New methods
A great deal of research is
being conducted developing and
testing new methods. Chemical
inhibition of sperm production
and motility, as well as internal
reversible barriers, are being
studied as methods of male con
traception Most of these meth
ods are still in the developmen
tal stages.
For women, much of the re
search centers around new
methods of application or inges
tion of synthetic hormones.
Many of these methods are al
ready being tested
Editor's note This is the second
in a series of three articles See
next Wednesday's Daily for
"Part 111 Stanford statistics. "

Modern methods of birth con
trol allow people to make
choices about pregnancy and
family planning Many options
are available to suit individual
needs
A frequently asked question
about contraception is "how ef
fective is it?' The answers tend
to be confusing and inconsis
tent. because two effectiveness
rates have been determined for
each method
Theoretical effectiveness re
fers to the maximum effective
ness — when the method is used
consistently and without error
Actual use effectiveness in
cludes human error and care

The combined oral contracep
tive. generally known as "the
Pill." is a popular and highly ef
fective method of contracep
tion. (Theoretical: 99.6 percent:
Use: 90 to 96 percent i Accord
ing to Contraceptive Technolo
gy, "The Pill is now used by 25 to
50 million women throughout
the world including some five to
eight million women in the Unit
ed States "
The combined pill contains
synthetic female hormones,
estrogen and progestin, which
alter the natural hormone levels
and inhibit egg development.
Correct usage involves a conti

nuing sequence of taking one pill
every day for 21 days and then
taking either a placebo or no pill
for seven days A medical pre
scription is required
The Pill has been available to
the public for only 15 years and
long-term side effects have not
been conclusively evaluated
Studies do indicate a greater oc
currence of blood clots, strokes
and heart attacks These risks
increase for smokers and wom
en over 35
Minor side effects are com
mon Contraceptive Technolo
gy reports About 40 percent of
Pill users have side effects of
one kind or another." Users
may experience nausea, weight
gain, mood changes and an in
crease or decrease in acne Ben
eficial side effects include
lessened menstrual cramps, de
creased flow and regular peri
ods
Mini-pill
Many of the adverse side ef
fects of the combined pill are
due to its estrogen content Pro
gestin only "mini-pills'" can al
ternatively be prescribed The
effectiveness of this method is
slightly lower than that of the
Pill (Theoretical 99 percent:
Use: 90 to 95 percent). Com
plications often include ir
regular flow and duration of
menstrual periods.
lUD
Intrauterine devices are
small plastic devices inserted
into a woman's uterus. Effec
tiveness rates are high. (Theo
retical: 97 to 99 percent; Use:
95 percent). The mechanism of
the lUD is not fully known It
may act as a mechanical bar
rier to the fertilized egg, pre
venting its implantation in the
uterine wall, or it may react
with the woman's body to pre
vent implantation
A prescription is required,
and insertion must be done by
trained technicians Once in
serted, a woman needs only to

check periodically that it is still
in place Replacement is neces
sary ever one to five years de
pending on the type of lUD Cur
rently five types of lUD have
PDA approval
Side effects commonly in
clude increased menstrual
cramping and flow Increased
incidences of pelvic inflam
matory disease and ectopic
pregnancies (implantation out
side of the uterusi have also
been reported
Diaphragm
"In 1882. when invented, the
diaphragm was a major break
through in the liberation of
women from unwanted preg
nancies.'' reported the Boston
Women's Health Collective in
the book Our Bodies, Ourselves
Diaphragms continue to be a
popular means of contracep
tion. Theoretical effectiveness
is estimated at 97 percent, while
the actual use rate isB3 percent.
A diaphragm is a dome
shaped rubber cup with a flex
ible rim It is filled with a
spermicidal cream or jelly and
then placed into the vagina at
the opening of the uterus The
diaphragm itself is an in
complete mechanical barrier,
but the spermicidal agents pre
vent sperm from further travel.
Correct usage includes addi
tional applications of
spermicidal agents before each
successive act of intercourse.
The diaphragm should be left in
place for six hours after sexual
activity.
The diaphragm requires a
prescription and must be fitted
by a trained clinician. One will
generally last about two years.
Side effects are minimal.
Some find the use of a
diaphragm disrupts sexual
spontaneity, and women often
cite the post-coital discharge of
spermicidal agents as an an
noyance.
A method currently used out
side of the United States is the

cervical cap This works as a
mechanical barrier much in the
same way as the diaphragm
Though it has not yet received
FDA approval, some doctors in
the United States have begun to
prescribe it
Condom
The condom is a method of
contraception worn by the man
It is a sheath, made of thin rub
ber or animal tissue that is
placed over the erect penis !o
prevent sperm from entering
the woman's body When used
alone, the theoretical effective
ness rate is 97 percent, use rate
90 percent. Effectiveness in
creases when the condom is
used in conjunction with
spermicidal foam (Theo
retical: 99 percent; Use: 95
percent).
Condoms are inexpensive and
can be obtained at a drugstore
without a prescription They are
also useful in preventing trans
mission of venereal disease
The disadvantage cited most
frequently by men is decreased
sensitivity. In addition, some
couples object to interrupting
foreplay to put on the condom
Vaginal spermicides
Vaginal spermicides come in
a variety of forms: creams,
jellies, suppositories and foam.
Jellies and creams are general
ly used in conjunction with the
diaphragm, while foam and sup
positories can be used alone as
complete contraceptive meth
ods.
Theoretical effectiveness for
foam is 97 percent; use effec
tiveness is 78 percent The theo
retical rate for suppositories is
97 percent, also. User rates are
75 to 80 percent
Foam is inserted into the
vagina with an applicator prior
to intercourse. Suppositories
placed deep within the vagina
spread their spermicide either
by melting or effervescing.
These require no prescrip
tion.

Fertility awareness methods
focus on cyclic signals of fertili
ty in a woman's body During
fertile periods, abstinence is ad
vocated rather than mechanical
or chemical devices
The calendar, or rhythm,
method predicts future fertility
based on past menstrual record
Cyclic irregularities can cause
method failure (Theoretical:
87 percent; Use 79 percent).
The basal body temperature
method relies on the fact that
most women experience a slight
rise in temperature at their
most fertile point, ovulation
This method does not predict ov
ulation; thus, effectiveness
rates can be increased when the
method is used in coordination
with the calendar method When
used alone, theoretical effec
tiveness is 93 percent, and use
effectiveness is 80 percent.
Sterilization
A more permanent approach
to birth control is voluntary
sterilization Though not per
fectly effective. 100 percent ef
fectiveness is approached. Ster
ilization generally is not re
versible.
The most common method of
male sterilization is the vasec
tomy. This operation involves
cutting and sealing the sperm
transport tubes. This is usually
performed in a doctor's office,
and the man walks out after a
brief recovery period. Com

plication rates are low
A comparable operation for
women is the tubal ligation In
this case, the egg transport
tubes are cut and cauterized
The operation can be performed
through two small abdominal
incisions or through the
vagina A slightly greater in
cidence of complications is as
sociated with the vaginal ap
proach
Withdrawal
Coitus interruptus. or the
withdrawal method, has long
been used as a contraceptive
technique Prior to ejaculation,
the man withdraws his penis.
The theoretical effectiveness is
91 percent, while actual use
rates are 75-85 percent
This method has distinct ad
vantages. It requires no prior
planning, no devices or
chemicals It is not reliable,
however, as a regular method of
birth control. Pre-ejaculatorv
fluids often contain enough
sperm to cause pregnancy
Post-coital methods
The morning-after pill is used
as an emergency measure in the
instance of unprotected mid
cycle intercourse. "It is not a
regular method of birth con
trol.'' according to Contracep
tive Technology. This treat
ment involves a series of high
doses of synthetic estrogen
which inhibit implantation by
the fertilized egg
Side effects include severe

nausea and vomiting If the
treatment is unsuccessful,
many doctors urge a thera
peutic abortion because of the
fetus' exposure to high levels of
hormones
No long-term adverse side ef
fects on the users have been
demonstrated
Abortion is another post
coital method of preventing un
wanted births The type of oper
ation performed depends on how
far the pregnancy has
progressed Karlv operations
tend to be easier to perform,
safer, less expensive, and less
physically and emotionally
traumatic for the woman. Sec
ond trimester abortions gener
ally involve hospitalization and
greater risks Abortions are
rarely performed after the sec
ond trimester unless the wom
an's health demands it.
New methods
A great deal of research is
being conducted developing and
testing new methods. Chemical
inhibition of sperm production
and motility, as well as internal
reversible barriers, are being
studied as methods of male con
traception Most of these meth
ods are still in the developmen
tal stages.
For women, much of the re
search centers around new
methods of application or inges
tion of synthetic hormones.
Many of these methods are al
ready being tested
