# Announcing the winner of the Great Daily Study Break contest: "The Roman Bath"
## 
### 
House members and their guests will
come in out of the chill evening air into the
steaming warmth of the Whitman House
lounge where they will shed their heavy
coats and wade into the warm sudsy water
filling the sunken lounge behind the fire
place where a roaring fire heats the room.
On the ledge extending from the fireplace
out over the waters of the bath rests a giant
fondue pot filled with molten chocolate. Ar
rayed around the fondue pot are assorted
fruits, melons, raisins, marshmallows,
grapes and frozen bananas waiting to be
dipped into the chocolate and enjoyed to the
fullest along with wine and punch as we re
cline in the warm water and enjoy the eve
ning.
As to the guests: we won't leave them to
chance; they are selected by a computer
dating program specially written to make

the happiest couples. All that's necessary is
for those who want to join us in our merri
ment to fill out a computer-data sheet and
have the luck to be matched to some resi
dent of Whitman House. Those interested
can pick one up at Whitman House today.
As the hour of the study break draws near
and the last of the hot water flows into the
bath, we pour in the soap and stir up the
suds, light the fire, set out the fondue pot
and the food and drinks, and turn up the ster
eo. The guests arrive and we eat. drink and
be merry.
The Whitman House entry was chosen
because of its outrageousness, originality
and sense appeal, and especially because it
offers everyone on campus the chance to
join in on the fun.
Congratulations, Whitman, see you
Thursday night!
