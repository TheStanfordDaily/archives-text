# Trial-period proposed to end impasse on sororities' status
## 
### Victor Goetz 
The long impasse over sorority rec
ognition here could be resolved if local
chapters would ask their nationals to
allow them a two-year test period un
der University guidelines, suggested
Norm Robinson, associate dean of stu
dent affairs for residential education.
Speaking to a meeting of about 100
sorority members in Bishop
Auditorium yesterday, Robinson said
that such a trial might be enough to
convince national organizations that
University regulations are not incom
patible with the objectives of the re
spective chapters.
The heart of the recognition issue
since a 33-year ban of sororities was
lifted in 1977 has been the University's
insistence on local autonomy for
sororities on campus.
' The University feels that it is very
inappropriate for people outside of

Stanford to have control over which
students will have access to Univer
sity resources," Robinson said
Audience questions during the hour
long meeting revealed two different
attitudes among frustrated members.
Some members asked Res Ed to take
more account of the benefits individ
ual members derive from their sorori
ty regardless of national affiliation
Others proposed that locals direct
their efforts more toward swaying the
nationals to accept University
guidelines.
Diana Conklin, row director and ad
viser to sororities and fraternities,
said she encountered her share of frus
tration in dealing with the problem,
too.
"On several occasions when I have
found an unacceptable point in some
chapters' constitutions, the chapter
has brought an explanation back from
their national, and I have been forced
to say 'thank you, but an explanation
doesn't resolve the problem.' " said
Conklin.
The local chapters do not entirely
agree with Conklin's views. "There is
a real discrepancy between what is ac
tually practiced and what is written in
the constitution," said Intersorority
Council Vice President Melissa
Foster.
Another major point of discussion
was the difference in University at
titudes toward fraternities and
sororities.
"There is no question that groups
that are already here are dealt with a
little differently," said Robinson, in
answer to an inquiry as to why rules
were bent to allow Theta Xi fraternity
to retain its house despite failing to
meet rush quotas for three years, Res
Ed's normal limit.
"When we are discussing ending an
existing group we want to give them

all the chances possible New groups
need a good strong foundation." said
Conklin. adding that Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity had to go through the same
rigorous procedure in which the
sororities , are currently engaged
before it was recognized last spring.
The breakthrough for Phi Kappa Psi
was a letter from its national waiving
all the constitutional points Res Ed
found troublesome
A similar letter has brought one
sorority very close to recognition,
though some disagreement still re
mains.
The process Conklin has been fol
lowing since taking over as sorority
adviser in December of 1979 involves
lengthy discussion with represent
atives of each chapter to go over their
respective constitutions line by line.
Each point in conflict with University
policy is cited.
It is then the chapter's job to iron
out the conflicts with its national of
fice. "Our relationship is with the stu
dents." she said "We do not negotiate
directly with the nationals."
Conklin said upon reading the con
stitutions she "found some of the stip
ulations to be quite shockingly con
trolling in very minute detail."
Among several examples she cited
one organization whose national presi
dent had theauthoritv to reject any in
dividual's membership in a local
chapter.
Both Robinson and Conklin said the
tone of fraternity and sorority con
stitutions differed noticeably. In dis
cussions with representatives of other
schools, Robinson said, "to a person
they talked about the difference in re
lations between national and local
fraternities and relations between na
tional and local sororities."
Robinson assured the women that
