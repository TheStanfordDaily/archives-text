# Albania attempts development in isolation
## 
### Washington Post 
Tirana, Albania — After 2 decades of ex
treme isolation, Albania, strategically situ
ated at the mouth of the Adriatic, is under
economic and political pressure to emerge
from its shell. But its longtime ruler, Enver
Hoxha, and his hard-line disciples are de
termined to control the process as best they
can.
The harsh repression that for many years
was the hallmark of Hoxha's rule has been
relaxed for some time now, but the Albanian
leader still identifies his own peculiar brand
of communism with the cause of Albanian
independence. The Western-educated son of
a middle-class Moslem landowner, he ap
pears to believe that Albania can survive as
an independent nation only by cutting itself

off from the rest of the world.
His dilemma — and a problem that his
successors will face even more acutely — is
that Albania needs the outside world in or
der to develop.
Since the communist takeover of Albania
following World War 11, a rudimentary in
dustrial structure has been built up from
virtually nothing. But labor productivity is
desperately low and Albania needs foreign
partners if it is to modernize its industry or
transform itself into a consumer society.
Since its break with China, Albania has
turned to Western Europe and its neighbor
Yugoslavia for badly needed machinery and
technological expertise. Trade, cultural and
sporting contacts have expanded enormous
ly-
Nevertheless, there are strict limits to

this opening-up. Albanians are not allowed
to travel abroad except as members of an
official delegation. Diplomatic relations
with both the United States and the Soviet
Union — both classified by Tirana as "im
perialist superpowers" — have been ruled
out. And apart from the occasional ethnic
Albanian, no United States citizen may
enter the country.
According to Western estimates, the Chi
nese provided Albania with around $800 mil
lion in econmic assistance during the 17-
year alliance. Western experts with knowl
edge of the Albanian economy believe that
the sudden departure of the Chinese, leaving
many projects unfinished, set back the
country's development plans by a couple of
years.
