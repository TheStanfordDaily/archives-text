# Med Center symposium hosted
## 
### Brian Sprague 
Some of the world's leading
experts in cancer research will
meet at the Sherman Fairchild
Auditorium in the Medical Cen
ter today and tomorrow to dis
cuss advances in the defining of
causes, immunization, treat
ment and the essential nature of
malignant lymphomas, such as
Hodgkin's disease. The sym
posium, which begins at 8 this
morning, entitled "Advances in
Malignant Lymphomas," is
sponsored by the Bristol Myers
company.
Dr. Saul Rosenberg, pro
fessor and director of oncology,
who will co-chair the sym
posium with Dr Henry Kaplan,
professor of radiology, said,
"it's part of a five year general
support program for cancer re
search instituted by Bristol
Myers." The company has been
giving unrestricted support for
cancer research to Stanford for
at least three years now.
In the same program, Bristol
Myers contributes to two Eu
ropean and four other U.S. uni
versity medical centers includ
ing Yale University School of
Medicine, the University of Chi
cago, Baylor College of Medi
cine and the John Hopkins Uni
versity School of Medicine, ac
cording to Rosenberg. Each
year, he said, one of the univer
sities given support, sponsors a

symposium in its specific field
of interest in cancer research.
The Stanford Symposium will be
the third in this series, he said.
These contributions form the
largest donation by any one cor
poration toward cancer re
search Rosenberg commended
the company stating, "It's a
precedent for corporations to
help universities in medical sup
port." He also emphasized that
the support "is not linked to any
profit motive."
"The symposium will consist
of 40 to 45 speakers, 15 to 20 of
whom are from Stanford," Ro
senberg said. "And I can assure
you that those speakers are the
leaders in their fields from
around the world," he added.
More than 400 people will show
up for the symposium from Eu
rope and North America, he
said, but due to capacity con
straints, a similar number will
be turned away.
It's not odd that the sym
posium centers on malignant
lymphomas, because Kaplan
and Rosenberg "were the real
pioneers in this field," accord
ing to Michael Sapozink, a resi
dent in radiation therapy.
Through a combination of ra
diation and chemotherapy
treatments developed by the
doctors, a victim of Hodgkin's
disease now has almost a 90
percent chance of complete re
covery. said a radiology assis

tant. According to a medical
center publication, in the 19405,
only 25 percent of Hodgkin's vic
tims survived five years
Hodgkin's disease, explained
Sapozink, is a malignant tumor
of the lymph system. It often
presents itself as an enlarge
ment of a lymph node in the
neck, he said. Approximately
10,000 Americans contract the
disease each year, he added,
with young adults being the ones
most commonly affected.
The increase in survival rate
among Hodgkin victims is due
to the "many advances in ma
lignant lymphoma research,"
said Rosenberg. For example,
he said, in the 1950s Kaplan con
ceived of the use of a linear elec
tron accelerator to battle
cancer. "It produces 'super
voltage' radiation therapy"
which destroys the cancerous
cells, according to Rosenberg.
There are now three ac
celerators being used at the
medical center; the original is
on display at the Smithsonian
Institution.

said Rosenberg. For example,
he said, in the 1950s Kaplan con
ceived of the use of a linear elec
tron accelerator to battle
cancer. "It produces 'super
voltage' radiation therapy"
which destroys the cancerous
cells, according to Rosenberg.

Some of the world's leading
experts in cancer research will
meet at the Sherman Fairchild
Auditorium in the Medical Cen
ter today and tomorrow to dis
cuss advances in the defining of
causes, immunization, treat
ment and the essential nature of
malignant lymphomas, such as
Hodgkin's disease. The sym
posium, which begins at 8 this
morning, entitled "Advances in
Malignant Lymphomas," is
sponsored by the Bristol Myers
company.
Dr. Saul Rosenberg, pro
fessor and director of oncology,
who will co-chair the sym
posium with Dr Henry Kaplan,
professor of radiology, said,
"it's part of a five year general
support program for cancer re
search instituted by Bristol
Myers." The company has been
giving unrestricted support for
cancer research to Stanford for
at least three years now.
In the same program, Bristol
Myers contributes to two Eu
ropean and four other U.S. uni
versity medical centers includ
ing Yale University School of
Medicine, the University of Chi
cago, Baylor College of Medi
cine and the John Hopkins Uni
versity School of Medicine, ac
cording to Rosenberg. Each
year, he said, one of the univer
sities given support, sponsors a

symposium in its specific field
of interest in cancer research.
The Stanford Symposium will be
the third in this series, he said.
These contributions form the
largest donation by any one cor
poration toward cancer re
search Rosenberg commended
the company stating, "It's a
precedent for corporations to
help universities in medical sup
port." He also emphasized that
the support "is not linked to any
profit motive."
"The symposium will consist
of 40 to 45 speakers, 15 to 20 of
whom are from Stanford," Ro
senberg said. "And I can assure
you that those speakers are the
leaders in their fields from
around the world," he added.
More than 400 people will show
up for the symposium from Eu
rope and North America, he
said, but due to capacity con
straints, a similar number will
be turned away.
It's not odd that the sym
posium centers on malignant
lymphomas, because Kaplan
and Rosenberg "were the real
pioneers in this field," accord
ing to Michael Sapozink, a resi
dent in radiation therapy.
Through a combination of ra
diation and chemotherapy
treatments developed by the
doctors, a victim of Hodgkin's
disease now has almost a 90
percent chance of complete re
covery. said a radiology assis

tant. According to a medical
center publication, in the 19405,
only 25 percent of Hodgkin's vic
tims survived five years
Hodgkin's disease, explained
Sapozink, is a malignant tumor
of the lymph system. It often
presents itself as an enlarge
ment of a lymph node in the
neck, he said. Approximately
10,000 Americans contract the
disease each year, he added,
with young adults being the ones
most commonly affected.
The increase in survival rate
among Hodgkin victims is due
to the "many advances in ma
lignant lymphoma research,"
said Rosenberg. For example,
he said, in the 1950s Kaplan con
ceived of the use of a linear elec
tron accelerator to battle
cancer. "It produces 'super
voltage' radiation therapy"
which destroys the cancerous
cells, according to Rosenberg.
