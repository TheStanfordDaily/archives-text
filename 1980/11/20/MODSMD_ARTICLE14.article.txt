# More full-time jobs, continuing discrimination reported
## Poll reveals changed attitudes concerning women 
### Gail Edmondson Schares 
In 1970, research showed only
a minority of American women
approved of efforts to strength
en and change the status of
women in society. Ten years lat
er, the group of women (and
men) favoring a change in socie
tal status for women has grown
to a majority of 64 percent.
These findings are drawn
from the 1980 Virginia Slims
American Women's Opinion
Poll which assessed where the
American woman is today, how
her status has changed in the
past 10 years, and where it
seems to be heading in the
future.
The 1980 poll is the fourth
study commissioned by Virginia
Slims since 1970. Virginia Slims
again chose the well-respected
Roper Organization to conduct
its research.
The opinions and changes re
portedly by the Roper Organiza
tion reflect a representative na
tionwide sample of 3000 women
age 18 and above and a control
group of 1000 men 18 and above.
One key element in the move
ment towards equality for
American women today, said
the Roper report, is the trend of
assuming full-time jobs. In 1980,
twice as many women, one out
of three, are working at full
time jobs as did in 1970. And
more working women today (45
percent) plan to make their jobs

full-time careers than planned
to do so in 1970 (39 percent).
Thirty-six percent of women
with full-time jobs are con
cerned about achieving success
in their careers compared with
45 percent of employed men.
Discrimination felt
In terms of rising within one's
profession, the research showed
that most women still feel dis
criminated against â€” in busi
ness (57 percent), top govern
ment jobs (55 percent), and the
professions (52 percent). How
ever. according to the Roper re
port, 66 percent of all working
women and men in America
claim that it makes no dif
ference to them whether they
have a male or female boss. Sev
enty-eight percent of women
would vote for a qualified wom
an for U.S. president and 69
percent of men agree.
The Roper Organization
found that women's careers
continue to have an impact on
family life, but that the changes
imposed are not threatening. In
1974, only 35 percent of Ameri
can women preferred an outside
job to homemaking. The 1980
poll shows that nearly half (46
percent) now prefer work out
side the home.
"In a major shift of opinion
from a decade ago, three quar
ters of the women (75 percent)
and two-thirds of the men (66
percent) today say they would

favor the establishment of addi
tional day-care centers." said
the report. By contrast, in 1970,
63 percent of women and only 49
percent of men favored an in
crease in day-care facilities.
Husband's job important
But American women in 1980
still place their husband's job
above their own. According to
the Roper report, 77 percent of
women said that a wife should
seriously consider giving up her
job if her husband has to re
locate. A smaller percentage of
men (68 percent) agreed that
this self-sacrifice would be ap
propriate.
Based on the Roper report, 10
percent of women think that the
husband should turn down the
possibility of career advance
ment through relocation in fa
vor of his wife's job, and 4
percent think that in case of re
location, the husband and wife
should live apart and see each
other whenever they can.
By an almost three-to-one
margin (47 percent to 16
percent), working women in
America feel they are just as
good mothers as they would be
had they not gone to work, the
report said. Forty-three percent
feel they make up for lost time
by improving the quality of time
they spend with their children.
Role redefined
According to the Roper re
port. the definition of the role of

women within the family has
changed over the past decade.
Six years ago, women who per
ceived marriage as a responsi
bility to be shared by both part
ners were in the minority (46
percent). A majority of Ameri
can women in 1980 (52 percent)
view marriage as a shared re
sponsibility with both husband
and wife earning salaries and
sharing family and household
responsibilities. In 1980. only 41
percent of American women
said they would lose respect for
a male homemaker compared
to 68 percent in 1970.
"Being in love" is still recog
nized as one of the most impor
tant factors in a healthy mar
riage, the report said, but fewer
women (46 percent) cited hav
ing children as one of the prima
ry factors in a good marriage,
compared to 51 percent six
years ago.
More than four out of every
five women today (82 percent)
said that children are not essen
tial for a full and happy mar
riage, said the report. However,
51 percent of American women
are in favor of having two chil
dren.
The Roper Report also re
vealed that support for divorce
as an acceptable solution to an
unsuccessful marriage has
grown from 52 percent in 1970 to
62 percent in 1980.
Regarding financial inde

pendence. the report showed
that the majority of American
women (51 percent) think they
are discriminated against when
applying for loans, mortgages
and charge accounts.
Continued change
Looking ahead to the 19905,
the Roper Report indicates that
the status of women will con
tinue to change. Sixty percent of
women today think it likely that
women will be drafted into
army combat units.
Surprisingly, the report re
vealed that nearly half of Amer
ican women today (49 percent)
think it likely that the institution
of lifetime marriage will van
ish. This figure contrasts with 94
percent of women who regard
marriage as a favored way of
life in 1980.
Based on the continuing iirv
petus for change, the 1980 Vir
ginia Slims Women's Opinion
Poll predicts that women will
obtain their primary goal: full
equality between themselves
and men.
The Roper Organization in
terviewed respondants in their
homes during the latter part of
1979 but before incidents such as
the seizure of our embassy in
Iran, the Russian intervention
in Afghanistan and President
Jimmy Carter's call for draft
registration of both men and
women. The response rate for
men and women was 98 percent.
