## Raising spectre of McCarthyism 
### 
This morning (Sunday) as I
sat down to read the San Jose
Mercury, nursing down my
morning cup of tea (two sugars,
cream) I ran into a series of
articles which reminded me of a
bumper sticker I saw this sum
mer: "Voting Republican"' Re
member the last time''" In
quick succession I encountered
an article about an important
secret meeting between John
Connally and Ronald Reagan
which speculated on a cabinet
post for the former Treasury
Secretary, and articles labeled
"Reagan staffer linked to secret
Nixon plot." and "Con
servatives push for internal se
curity (subtitled: Hard line
against dissidents)."
While I don't want to
harangue people about the ut
terly foolish choice they made in
electing Ronald Reagan to the
presidency, and while I. as
somebody who is learning to be
a "professional political scien
tist." should allow the new Re
publican administration some
time to prove itself, already in
the short while since the elec
tion we can see one of the
hallmarks of the Nixon presi
dency rearing its ugly head: the
systematized attack on individ
ual liberties, coupled with ov
ert attempts to turn the ex
ecutive branch into a political
tool (well beyond the normal,
but still questionable, favor
itism to be expected).

The apparent courtship of
Connally and Henry Kissinger
shows that the Republicans
have no problems in bringing
back into government people
who. while never convicted of
criminality, nevertheless sym
bolized deceit in the highest
levels of the federal govern
ment. It also shows that the Re
publican party is the same old
party it has always been, with
the same old people, while it is
trying to put on a show of re
spectability and innovation.
The story about Stanton An
derson. who tried to develop a
comprehensive plan for using
various executive departments
specifically for the reelection of
Richard Nixon, being a member
on Reagan's transition staff
only irked me slightly. It was to
be expected.
What upset me the most was
the final article, in which the
Heritage Foundation submitted
a report to the Reagan team
calling for the reduction of civil
liberties for Americans. It
stated that the U.S. faced the
biggest security threat since
World War II and that "it is ax
iomatic that individual liberties
are secondary to the require
ment of national security and in
ternal civil order."
It was to be expected that the
report would call for an end to
most of the progressive social
legislation of the last two dec
ades. But to call for the abridg

ing of the rights by which we de
bate the country's future raises
the spectre of McCarthyism
once again
Even worse, under the il
lusion of a "mandate from the
voters."the Republican govern
ment might feel that it can get
away with it this time. Once
again we have to fight the forces
of right-wing repression which
were so prevalent during the
Nixon years
According to the Mercury,
Edwin Meese, head of the Re
agan transition team and soon
to-be a top counselor to Presi
dent Reagan, has received the
report and is said to be sympa
thetic with it This should not be
very surprising since Meese
contributed to early drafts of
the report Thus, instead of
being an incident of some
marginal organization reaching
for headlines, this is an example
of the type of advice likely to be
listened to by the new adminis
tration
If Reagan truly believes in
civil liberties, he will disavow
the report If not. we can look
forward to another era of mail
openings, illegal break-ins. and
domestic surveillance.
Surely, this is only one report
being presented to an adminis
tration just being organized.
But. that still is no reason for us
to complacently watch while
those who would destroy our
civil rights advise the president.

If the Mercury is correct, we
all have reason to be concerned,
if not alarmed at this type of re
port The implementation of
even a portion of this document
could do more harm than free
debate, of which the Heritage
Foundation and Meese seem so
frightened.
The ghosts of Richard Nixon
and Joseph McCarthy can not be
allowed to once again take con
trol of the apparatus of our gov
ernment. so that its awesome
power can be unleashed on its
citizens.
