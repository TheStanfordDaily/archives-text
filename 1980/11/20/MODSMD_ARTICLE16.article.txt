## The 						unwanted 'Big Brother' 
### 
As Americans, we take pride in rooting for the
underdog. Very little excites us more than seeing
a favored team upset by another team that is vir
tually unknown or. if known, not very highly re
garded. It is unfortunate that this attitude does
not extend to our dealings with other nations. The
attempts of the United States to play "Big
Brother" to the Western and Third World nations
succeed only in making this country one of hypo
crites.
Instead of allowing other countries to run their
own affairs, the United States constantly in
terferes. The claim of past administrations that
we have been helping democracy has long since
been exposed as fraud with the examples of Chile,
and. more recently, Iran. Our support of the shah
is an example of an act committed solely in our
own selfish interests, with no regard to the wishes
of the people of that country. As the present
hostage situation proves, American intervention
in Iran was not appreciated.
c
We have no "right" to bully Mexico and the
countries of Central and South America. We can
not assume that we have a "right" to Mexican and
Venezuelan oil. It is just such thinking that makes
this country seem imperialistic to the rest of the
world.
The Monroe Doctrine is old — very old. This
country is no longer the protector that it once was,
but, rather, is seen as an aggressor. It is time for
our officials to open their eyes and see the world
as it is todav.

The type of attitude held by President-elect
Ronald Reagan and his fellow conservatives,
epitomized by the slogan, "Let's Make America
Great Again," is an example of this country's
misguided attempts to lead a world unwilling to
follow. Dictating our will to other countries will
not make America great, as Reagan seems to
think, but. will only make us hated even more than
we presently are.
Times have changed and other countries want
to determine their own policies, free from U.S. in
tervention. They have every right to do so and
should not be hindered by a country which prides
itself on its belief in democracy.
I strongly agree with former Ambassador Wil
liam Sullivan's comment during a recent speech
that the United States should pursue an "ethical"
policy towards Mexico and its new oil wealth. This
policy should be directed not only toward Mexico,
but to the whole world. It is time that this country
fulfills its responsibility by recognizing other
countries as equals and not playing the unwanted
"Big Brother" part.
Why should it be that Americans support under
dogs. in general, but try to subjugate under
developed and underdog countries? U.S. foreign
policy is in need of drastic changes. Our unique
brand of hypocrisy is no longer welcomed by the
other countries of this world. If we intend to co
exist with others in the future, we must modify
our views and mind our own business.
