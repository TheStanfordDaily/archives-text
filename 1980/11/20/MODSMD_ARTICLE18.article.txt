# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Leah Halper Confounded by food and the time of year 
### 
I don't like Thanksgiving. I quit en
joying it two years ago as I measured rice
into food baskets for East Palo Alto fami
lies. My partner, who was pouring and bag
ging beans, complained that she hadn't
eaten since breakfast, felt "starved," and
wanted to quit her new diet. We filled the
last bags, fastened them, and wiped our
hands.
It occurred to me. in those moments, that
Americans will never be able to deal con
structively with hunger on an international,
national or local level until our own per
ceptions of food change. Those baskets were
important to the families they fed, of
course, but charity projects will remain
charity projects, dependent upon public
spirit, until a deeper problem is resolved —
why the affluent are so insensitive to, so
confounded and embarrassed by hunger.
What worse time to seek change than at
Thanksgiving? If ever there was a holiday
for the white, the affluent and the male, this
is it. Native Americans have nothing to cele
brate. Welfare mothers cannot feel very
thankful. And women who cook for family
gatherings only collapse at day's end with
aching feet, dishpan hands and the guilty
feeling that they overate again.
On the other hand. Thanksgiving appears
to appeal to certain myths common among
many affluent men: the myth that a vaca
tion means a beer and a football game, that
too much food proves good providership,
and that overeating is not so much a ques
tion of health or ethics as of digestive abili
ty-
No one is more afraid of hunger than
those who have never been hungry. Food is
tangled up with perceptions of status, con
trol. comfort, nostalgia and (especially for
women) physical attractiveness. These as
sociations accompany us from the dining
room, giving rise to two patterns for avoid
ing hunger issues.
The first, and perhaps more common pat
tern, is to become wrapped up in any
number of hang-ups about food which block

a broader consideration of hunger. When
food inspires passion, either as the enemy or
the most dependable pleasure, it is being ac
knowledged (if negatively) for all its physi
cal, cultural, social and psychological im
portance. But being a slave to one's appetite
can be paralyzing.
More women than men seem to fall into
this pattern. No wonder; most women I
know have a special, and not always pleas
ant, relationship to food. Many women
spend inordinate amounts of time choosing,
preparing and working off their meals.
Women more often than men eat out of ner
vousness or depression, stash, binge, plan
social occasions around food, and believe si
multaneously in the fixative powers of a
good meal and a strict diet.
And women are just supposed to know
about food. It is always assumed, when peo
ple are cooking, that the women should be
consulted on spicing the soup, and in fact,
women are often the only ones who know.
No one forms these habits out of thin air,
of course. Even women who have family
power beyond cooking and cleaning are
targeted for constant courtship by the
bright packages and recipe-mongering of
manufacturers, and the female subculture
of the supermarket is a seductive invitation
to over-purchase.
While the food industry, with its dupes
and counterdupes, encourages female con
sumers (prime purchasers for the Ameri
can family) to eat heartily, the fashion,
diet, exercise, entertainment and insurance
industries feature slender women who are
by implication standards of happiness and
physical or mental health.
Having always assumed that where there
is hunger there is also oppression, I look at
the many hungry American women on diets.
I know affluent women who refuse to eat in
public, who have daily cries over food, who
cook for others without allowing themselves
to eat, who stuff themselves with costly diet
"foods" made of carcinogenic chemicals,
and who square off at dinner with other

women in silent bouts to see who can eat
less.
The horrible "willpower" necessary for
such grim dieting makes me question the
value Americans place on women's wills —
perhaps willpower is praised because wom
en have historically been diverted from so
many other powers.
Regardless, willpower is wasteful of both
food and human energy. Dieters leave full
plates attesting to their willpower.
Willpower curdles enjoyment of special
holidays, makes exercise punishing, and
transforms the temptation for some potato
chips into a major battle between reason,
self esteem and emotion.
The second pattern of reaction to hunger
is evident in the questions non-dieters tor
ment dieters with, as, "Why is it such a big
deal to eat one cookie?" and, "Why don't
you just quit caring about food?" The well
fed have the luxury of acting indifferent
towards food, and by trivializing concerns
about it, they may trivialize hunger also.
When food is just another object, there
are a thousand creative ways to waste it.
Animal House louts fight with it. Women
make cosmetics out of it, pasting oatmeal,
yogurt, eggs or avocado to their faces.
Grammar-school classes lacquer it and glue
it to picture frames.
And we perfect the art of rationalizing
waste — carved pumpkins are traditional,
Stern food is "bad" so it's okay to waste it,
and foods that are advertised as fun are
served from political and social questions.
I don't like this time of year because I
sometimes join others of my background in
rationalization and superficiality.
This, not hunger, confounds me: instead
of cultivating a genuine consciousness, a
thankfulness that cannot be contained by a
single day, we are fighting ourselves and the
damage we do our own hearts and minds is
hurting other people too.

the many hungry American women on diets.
I know affluent women who refuse to eat in
public, who have daily cries over food, who
cook for others without allowing themselves
to eat, who stuff themselves with costly diet
"foods" made of carcinogenic chemicals,
and who square off at dinner with other

women in silent bouts to see who can eat
less.
The horrible "willpower" necessary for
such grim dieting makes me question the
value Americans place on women's wills —
perhaps willpower is praised because wom
en have historically been diverted from so
many other powers.
Regardless, willpower is wasteful of both
food and human energy. Dieters leave full
plates attesting to their willpower.
Willpower curdles enjoyment of special
holidays, makes exercise punishing, and
transforms the temptation for some potato
chips into a major battle between reason,
self esteem and emotion.
The second pattern of reaction to hunger
is evident in the questions non-dieters tor
ment dieters with, as, "Why is it such a big
deal to eat one cookie?" and, "Why don't
you just quit caring about food?" The well
fed have the luxury of acting indifferent
towards food, and by trivializing concerns
about it, they may trivialize hunger also.
When food is just another object, there
are a thousand creative ways to waste it.
Animal House louts fight with it. Women
make cosmetics out of it, pasting oatmeal,
yogurt, eggs or avocado to their faces.
Grammar-school classes lacquer it and glue
it to picture frames.
And we perfect the art of rationalizing
waste — carved pumpkins are traditional,
Stern food is "bad" so it's okay to waste it,
and foods that are advertised as fun are
served from political and social questions.
I don't like this time of year because I
sometimes join others of my background in
rationalization and superficiality.
This, not hunger, confounds me: instead
of cultivating a genuine consciousness, a
thankfulness that cannot be contained by a
single day, we are fighting ourselves and the
damage we do our own hearts and minds is
hurting other people too.

I don't like Thanksgiving. I quit en
joying it two years ago as I measured rice
into food baskets for East Palo Alto fami
lies. My partner, who was pouring and bag
ging beans, complained that she hadn't
eaten since breakfast, felt "starved," and
wanted to quit her new diet. We filled the
last bags, fastened them, and wiped our
hands.
It occurred to me. in those moments, that
Americans will never be able to deal con
structively with hunger on an international,
national or local level until our own per
ceptions of food change. Those baskets were
important to the families they fed, of
course, but charity projects will remain
charity projects, dependent upon public
spirit, until a deeper problem is resolved —
why the affluent are so insensitive to, so
confounded and embarrassed by hunger.
What worse time to seek change than at
Thanksgiving? If ever there was a holiday
for the white, the affluent and the male, this
is it. Native Americans have nothing to cele
brate. Welfare mothers cannot feel very
thankful. And women who cook for family
gatherings only collapse at day's end with
aching feet, dishpan hands and the guilty
feeling that they overate again.
On the other hand. Thanksgiving appears
to appeal to certain myths common among
many affluent men: the myth that a vaca
tion means a beer and a football game, that
too much food proves good providership,
and that overeating is not so much a ques
tion of health or ethics as of digestive abili
ty-
No one is more afraid of hunger than
those who have never been hungry. Food is
tangled up with perceptions of status, con
trol. comfort, nostalgia and (especially for
women) physical attractiveness. These as
sociations accompany us from the dining
room, giving rise to two patterns for avoid
ing hunger issues.
The first, and perhaps more common pat
tern, is to become wrapped up in any
number of hang-ups about food which block

a broader consideration of hunger. When
food inspires passion, either as the enemy or
the most dependable pleasure, it is being ac
knowledged (if negatively) for all its physi
cal, cultural, social and psychological im
portance. But being a slave to one's appetite
can be paralyzing.
More women than men seem to fall into
this pattern. No wonder; most women I
know have a special, and not always pleas
ant, relationship to food. Many women
spend inordinate amounts of time choosing,
preparing and working off their meals.
Women more often than men eat out of ner
vousness or depression, stash, binge, plan
social occasions around food, and believe si
multaneously in the fixative powers of a
good meal and a strict diet.
And women are just supposed to know
about food. It is always assumed, when peo
ple are cooking, that the women should be
consulted on spicing the soup, and in fact,
women are often the only ones who know.
No one forms these habits out of thin air,
of course. Even women who have family
power beyond cooking and cleaning are
targeted for constant courtship by the
bright packages and recipe-mongering of
manufacturers, and the female subculture
of the supermarket is a seductive invitation
to over-purchase.
While the food industry, with its dupes
and counterdupes, encourages female con
sumers (prime purchasers for the Ameri
can family) to eat heartily, the fashion,
diet, exercise, entertainment and insurance
industries feature slender women who are
by implication standards of happiness and
physical or mental health.
