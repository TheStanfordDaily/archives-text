Moral monopoly?
On November 13. the Daily
published a letter from mem
bers of Roses Against a Nuclear
Environment (RANE) about
their October 31 picketing of the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC). RANE was
demonstrating its concern by
protesting the presence of re
cruiters from several com
panies involved in the prod
uction of weapons. It is very
American of RANE members,
in fact, to exercise the freedom
of speech and peaceful as
sembly guaranteed by our Con
stitution.
Unfortunately, the letter also
contained a suggestion I find
dangerous and disturbing: that
the University in general and
CPPC in particular accept input
from RANE and others, with an
eye toward prohibiting weapons
producers from recruiting on
campus. I feel that even if the
majority of the Stanford com
munity should sympathize with
RANE, this sympathy would be
irrelevant to the matter of on
campus recruiting.
Let's look at a hypothetical
parallel. Suppose a group which

believes that the use of birth
control pills is immoral wants
CPPC to refuse the use of its fa
cilities to Syntex. the corporate
parent of the celebrated pill.
Should CPPC be expected to
bow to such external pressure,
thus inconveniencing students
who have no moral objections to
seeking employment with a
firm whose products happen not
to be universally welcomed?
I submit that in all that is re
levant to the issue of on-campus
recruiting, the real no-nukes
campaign and the hypothetical
no pills campaign involve simi
lar forces and identical rights.
If you would deny this paral
lelism, let me remind you that
there are people who feel that
contraception, by removing a
restriction on the sexual activi
ty of others, is destructive to the
world as they would like it to be.
I admit that the cause I
hypothesize might be locally
less popular than RANE.
CPPC's purpose is to assist
students in obtaining the em
ployment of their choice RANE
would like to restrict the
choices available by making it
inconvenient to meet and in
terview with representatives of

certain corporations. In this
manner, RANE wants to im
pose its morality on others. The
freedom of making a moral de
cision of whether or not it is
right to work for a given corpo
ration. be it Megadeaths In
ternational or Peace and Love,
Incorporated, should be left to
the individual. It should not be
usurped by the University,
CPPC. RANE, or anyone else.
The press has devoted much
attention to the apparently
growing conservatism in Amer
ica and the potential impact of
the influence of the "Moral-
Right" segment. Let us not
think that the right has a
monopoly on trying to make
moral decisions for others.
RANE. by seeking to exercise ,
control over CPPC and to limit
your choices, has demonstrated
that it is equally eager to make
decisions for you. Trying to con
trol your own life is rather like
crossing the street: While you
are busy looking out for danger
from the right, be careful, lest
you be blind-sided from the left.

Direct criticism
In Carl Madson's letter of
Nov. 11. he seems to be respond
ing to the poor account of my
position set forth in the article
by Kim Rachmeler {Daily, Oct.
15). If he had read my letter of
Oct. 23, he would have seen that
I do indeed believe in the truism
that the effectiveness of an in
structor is determined by how
well he or she instructs, and that
I am amenable to constructive
student criticism. However, I
oppose the use of student eval
uations as a way of judging
teaching performance on the
following grounds.
1) Controlled experiments
show that how a student rates an
instructor is no indication of
what he learned in the course; in
fact, the correlation between
ratings and amount learned is
negative.
2) Since only half of the stu
dents turn in evaluations, a
statistical study of the ratings
does not provide reliable in
formation.
3) Ratings for a particular in
structor sometimes range from
1 to 7. When figures have a wide
spread, averaging them does
not necessarily provide a mean
ingful figure, especially when it
is not known whether it is the
good students or poor ones who
have given the extreme ratings.
4) I suspect that when the
course is unpopular because it is
required, or because it is dif
ficult. students who are spoon
fed will rate their teachers
more highly than students who
are required to do independent
thinking. If instructors of such
courses are pressured into im
proving their ratings, they may
be tempted to lower their stan
dards below what a first rate
university should require
It has not escaped my notice
that there is such a thing as bad
teaching. Students should feel
free to direct criticism either to
the instructor himself or to ad
ministration, in person or In
writing. It is not the criticism
that I object to. It is the system
being used to evaluate instruc
tors that I object to, since I do
not think it accomplishes its
purpose

In conclusion I would like to
point out to Mr. Madson that I
am not all bad. since I agree
with the student critics of the
Albers Wall.

Sick of it
I'm glad that the Daily finally
printed such a deep, brilliant
analysis as Kent's and Blake's
"The Big Con: Stanford's child
ish game.''
Like Kent and Blake, I'm sick
of the social games at Stanford.
When someone says "Hi" to me,
I ignore him/her unless I think
that he/she is a deep person.
Rather than going to any dull
parties and having a few belts, I
stay in my room and get thor
oughly soaked on Southern Com
fort. I'm tired of hearing people
say things that we damn well
know aren't true and I'm damn
well fed up about it and I damn
well tell them so.
It's too bad that despite the
fact that Kent and Blake and I
have transcended mortal being,
other people have to spoil our
good time at Stanford. It's a
good thing that the rest of the
world is different.

The biggest story
If Allen fox's opinion pre
vails (Daily, Nov. 17), I and my
"anti-nuke" buddies will
metamorphosize, turning into
beings radiating with proud sat
isfaction over the wonders of nu
clear fission. Our permutation
will result not accidentally, but
from one simple realization:
namely, more people have died
in coal mines than in nuclear
plants.
Fox's "metamorphosis"
argument fails, because it
touches the surface but not the
heart of the nuclear question.
The heart of it is potential. A
meltdown is not yet in the his
tory books, but if it joins the
pages many millions of us may
follow with it.
Likewise, stored radiation

has not been leaked in huge
quantities, though our con
tainers are rusting, above
ground and in the ocean; these
containers must last hundreds
of thousands of years to prevent
disaster. The potential, even the
distant possibility of incom
prehensible destruction is the
essence of the nuclear debate.
This transcends current mortal
ity rates as vividly as a world
war transcends the Labor Day
motor collision level.
Explosions in nuclear plants
have, in fact, been the cause of
death. One occurred in January
1961 in a government reactor in
Idaho F'alls, Idaho. Three tech

nicians were killed. It was hard
ly "the biggest story of the
year." as Fox suggests.
We still have much to learn
about nuclear power. Presum
ably because of this, private in
surance companies refuse to in
sure even the "safest" nuclear
plants. "The biggest story of the
year" will occur if and when we
do learn, first hand, the actual
capacities of nuclear power.
That would be a bit like the
products of late Saturday night
studying: knowledge I'd rather
not acquire.
