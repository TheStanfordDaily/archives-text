### Peter Finch 
The results of a survey conducted by
the ASSU Task Force on Contem
porary Entertainment showed con
clusively that students here want
campus-wide and big name events, ac
cording to Doug Mitchell, ex-officio
Task Force member.
The survey, taken during the week
of Oct. 21. was an attempt at judging
student attitudes towards contem
porary entertainment here.
Fifteen hundred of the surveys,
which asked students what they en
joyed as entertainment and which ac
tivities they would support, were dis
tributed in White Plaza, Meyer Li
brary and the Sunday Flicks. Accord
ing to Mitchell, 600 of them were re
turned.
"We were trying to find out what
kind of entertainment the ASSU
should think about providing,"
Mitchell said. "A lot of people said
they wanted concerts. In that group

was jazz, classical and rock." The
most popular style of music re
quested, according to Mitchell, was
"soft rock."
The Task Force, consisting of eight
voting and six ex-officio members,
was set up at the beginning of this
quarter to investigate the possibility
of finding a suitable replacement for
now-defunct ASSU Special Events.
The survey was only a small part of
the investigation the Task Force is un
dertaking.
By January. Mitchell said, the Task

Force will make a recommendation to
the ASSU regarding a possible alter
native.
People have been coming up with
ideas that the Task Force has been
looking into, Mitchell explained. "A
few people said they wanted comedy
so we looked into what that involves â€”
what it means to bring comedians on
campus," he said.
"The greatest demand was for con
certs here," Mitchell continued. "I
don't know if ASSU should provide
them or not."
Presently, the Task Force is looking
at several options for bringing back
concerts. One, Mitchell said; is to
present shows of a smaller magnitude.
Having ASSU co-sponsor its concerts
with other University groups or with
outside interests is another possibility
that has been suggested. Finally, he
said, they could recommend that a
program similar to the old Special
Events be established.
Further tallies from the survey
show that two-thirds of the students
questioned said they would like to see
a contemporary entertainment con
sulting service here. Through such a
