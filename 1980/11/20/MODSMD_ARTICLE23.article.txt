# Workshop defines problems of women in grad school; Keohane's adviceâ€”pack along your sense of humor
## 
### Ann Pedreira 
"When you pack your bags for
graduate school, don't forget
your sense of humor," said
Assoc. Political Science Prof.
Nannerl Keohane at last Thurs
day's Women of the World
Workshop. The third in its
series, this workshop dealt with
women in graduate schools and
the types of problems they
might face.
Keohane, who is the first
woman to chair the Faculty Sen
ate at Stanford, provided living
proof that these problems can
be overcome.
She opened her talk with two
pieces of good news for women
interested in going to graduate
schools. She said that "even
though there are still obstacles
to women, this is less true than
it used to be."
Secondly, she pointed out that
today it can be an advantage to
be a woman. "Women are
looked upon a lot more sympa
thetically," she said. Saying she
realizes the doubts this might
cause women to have about
themselves, nonetheless, "it's a
heck of a lot better than not get
ting in because you're a wom
an."
Keohane also advised women
to take advantage of pre-pro
fessional counseling and to talk
to professors about possible op
tions for academic graduate
work.

"When applying," she said,
"an adviser's assessment of you
is going to be very important.
Make sure you have made your
self known to a variety of pro
fessors in your field."
Timing important
Timing is also something to
be considered, she said. "Fol
low your own gut reactions,"
she advised, but added, "Don't
let yourself keep putting it off;
pressure has to be self-in
stilled."
She continued, "As a woman,
nobody will ask you why you
don't go." Although this lack of
pressure will allow a woman
more freedom with her time,
she said, it will cause a woman
to be taken less seriously. "Our
society imposes upon us ambi
tion for men," she said, "but not
for women. You have to think
about making your own con
tract, your own bargain," she
said.
In graduate or pre-pro
fessional school she said that
while men will feel the com
pulsion to go on, women will
question it, and maybe stop out.
Once you stop out, she warned,
it's hard to go back.
In choosing a school, she ad
vised women to investigate the
school's treatment of women.
One indication of the school's at
titude can be detected in the
number of women in the faculty
and student body. But, she said,

the best option is to talk to a
woman who attended the grad
school and to get her reactions.
One shouldn't neglect to find
out how competitive and how
structured the school is, she
said, adding that "this will
make a huge difference in the
quality of life once you get
there."
Discrimination exists
Keohane warned that "even
at the best schools you will en
counter some professors who
will put you down because
you're a woman." She advised
that women find some kind of
"tolerance threshold," some
where between ignoring it com
pletely and getting really con
cerned about it. She hoped that
all women attending grad
schools would find an environ
ment sensitive to the problems
facing women.
Cecil Andrews, a graduate
student in education at Stanford

who is involved in feminist stud
ies. was the next speaker at the
workshop. She said that, for her,
returning to grad school after
having raised a family "was a
hard decision.''
Although Andrews said she
overcame any barriers she had
keeping her from pursuing her
goals, she said that women in
general have "a lot lower
aspiration level than our male
counterparts." She cited the
book Doctors Wanted, No
Women Need Apply by Mary
Walsh, in which the author, af
ter interviewing a number of
National Merit Scholars, found
that although women's expecta
tions of future careers were
high in high school, they
dropped very noticeably in col
lege. "Maybe you should think a
couple of steps further than you
are right now." Andrews told
those attending the workshop.
Keohane added that in

Rhodes-Marshal 1 , interviews
"men tend to have a much
stronger self-concept. Women
on the other hand," she said,
"almost always come into grad
uate schools thinking they're
not as good, even if they're fan
tastic."
Andrews continued by saying
that for everyone going to grad
uate school the first year will be
far from easy. "Almost every
one feels like they're going to
die," she said. "This is the rea
son why it's good to get to know
the school," she added, remind
ing women that when the going
gets rough, "don't think it's only
you."
The next speaker, Prue
Schaefer from Planned Parent
hood, said she didn't seek her
masters degree until after she
married and had children. She
said she felt her family "really
bent over backwards" for her.
She added, however, that it

"might be best to sit out awhile.
That's what worked best for
me."
No problems
She said her experience in
grad school at San Jose State
was one in which she
"didn't encounter any prob
lems." Although she admitted
that she felt "a little bit of in
timidation from professors,"
she said she nevertheless gained
a great deal of confidence in
working for her degree.
Schaefer said that although
she didn't start work at Planned
Parenthood with a degree, she
found it necessary after a few
years, and said she couldn't
break into her field today
without one.
Women of the World, a group
designed to help women in the
career world, will conclude No
vember Career Month with a
sherry hour this evening in
Meyer Forum Room at 7.
