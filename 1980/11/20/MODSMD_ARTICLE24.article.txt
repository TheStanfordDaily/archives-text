"I don't think missing out on a
day's food is a great inconve
nience." said Matt Nichols,
Sigma Chi resident He was
speaking of the Sigma Chi
fraternity's "Starvation Day"
for UNICEF, the world hun
ger organization, held on No
vember 5
In spite of the fact that the
fast was held during mid-terms,
more than half of the house's 44
members participated. Sigma

Chi deducted $6 60 per faster
(for three meals) from the
house's board receipts, and
raised over $150 for the
UNICEF.
According to Joe Kennedy,
organizer of the fast, the idea
came out of a letter from
UNICEF requesting some
sort of fund-raiser to aid the or
ganization's annual Halloween
drive.
Kennedy brought up the pro

posal of a day of fasting at
Sigma Chi's bi-weeklv house
meeting and reports: "The guys
were really receptive.'' Twen
ty-three house members volun
teered to fast and the project
was launched
The Sigma Chi fast. Kennedy
said, was not linked to the Uni
versity food service Fast Day
which will take place next Tues
day. November 25 Rather, it
was an independent effort,
taken on as one of a number of
community service projects the
fraternity undertakes each
year
The amount of money raised
by Sigma Chi per person is sig
nificantly more than that which
the University food service will
rebate per faster next week.
Like other fraternities,
Sigma Chi runs its own meal
service. Kennedy noted that
"we're pretty flexible," and
said that the preparations for
the fast were not difficult.
Public service activities like
this one are common at many
fraternities, although "Starva
tion Day" seems to be the first
of its kind. "I don't know of any
other frats that have raised this
idea in particular." said Ken
nedy.
However, judging from the
success of "Starvation Day" at
Sigma Chi, similar projects
may be held at other
fraternities, according to Ken
nedy.
"I think it will become an an
nual event at Sigma Chi," he
said.
The donation this year is ex
pected to go into a UNICEF
community-assistance food
project, most likely in the Third
World.
