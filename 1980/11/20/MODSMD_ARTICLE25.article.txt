## 'Eyolf' pretty, but inconsistent 
### Hep Joon Cho 
The current Drama Dept. production of
Henrik Ibsen s Little Eyolf points up sever
al tendencies apparent in the Department's
presentations over the last few years. The
technical values — costumes, set. and light
ing — are excellent. The production is
always good to look at. But it isn't always so
good to watch, because once again the per
formances are not up to the same standard.
This is probably to be expected. Sets and
lighting tend to be done, or at least super
vised, by faculty members, often pro
fessionals in their fields. The actors aren't
— shouldn't be — professionals. While there
is nothing wrong with this situation, the dif
ferences in quality can be hard for the
viewer to reconcile.
Little Eyolf takes place at the head of a
fjord, and William Eddelman has designed
a wonderful, abstract mountain valley that
hems in the action and the characters' lives
alike White cardboard tubes of uniform
length hang by white string in varying
slopes around and behind the stage, which
consists of one large and one small platform
which alternately serve as morning-room,
seashore, and upland meadow. The com
bination of abstract scenerv and staidly re

alistic furniture (in the first two acts) gives
a nice sense of simplicity without bareness
The costumes are somewhere between
these two extremes. Designer Douglas Rus
sell has submerged the characters in the
same watery domain that claims little
Eyolf in the play's first act. Painted
"waves" on the silk dresses and suits shim
mer under the green and blue spotlights,
making the action seem always a little out
of focus.
Little Eyolf is one of Ibsen's late plays,
and to my mind not a very successful one. It
is nominally concerned with the Allmers
family: Alfred, the father, a sometime
writer, his wife Rita, his half-sister Asta,
and his son Eyolf Eyolf has been lamed by
an accident suffered while his parents suc
cumbed to passion nearby, and Alfred has
never forgiven himself or his wife. Alfred is
a cold fish in general, where his wife is con
cerned , and when Eyolf drowns , Alfred
leaves the human plane altogether.
The play operates on realistic and sym
bolic levels, and the symbolic aspects are a
little obtrusive. I'd have enjoyed the play a
lot more if it had been about incest and
adultery and guilt; while those things were
in the plot, the play is more concerned with

human responsibility and the mean
inglessness of life and man's proper occupa
tions. and two hours of pontificating on
those subjects gets a little tiring.
It also handicaps the actors. The dialogue
is so dead that more-than-normal talent
would be required to bring it to life Karyn
Dietz, who plays Alfred's half-sister, has
more than enough; she perfectly captured
Asta's air of light-hearted reserve. Steve
Vineberg, as Alfred, and Gail Anderson, as
his wife Rita, did not fare so well. Vineberg
brought too much energy to his role, over
playing most of his scenes; he seemed to get
more keyed-up as the play went on, stepping
on several of his wife's lines in the climactic
scene. Vineberg did give us a coherent sense
of his character, something which Anderson
did not. Rita is the play's most demanding
role, and Anderson projected the same
snide bitchiness whether the role called for
her to be a sex-kitten or loving wife.
Despite problems of performance, the
Drama Dept. production of Little Eyolf is
interesting and attractive. It runs through
Sunday in the Nitery (Old Union), with per
formances tonight, tomorrow night and Sat
urday at 8 and Saturday and Sunday
matinees at 2:30 p.m.

alistic furniture (in the first two acts) gives
a nice sense of simplicity without bareness
The costumes are somewhere between
these two extremes. Designer Douglas Rus
sell has submerged the characters in the
same watery domain that claims little
Eyolf in the play's first act. Painted
"waves" on the silk dresses and suits shim
mer under the green and blue spotlights,
making the action seem always a little out
of focus.
Little Eyolf is one of Ibsen's late plays,
and to my mind not a very successful one. It
is nominally concerned with the Allmers
family: Alfred, the father, a sometime
writer, his wife Rita, his half-sister Asta,
and his son Eyolf Eyolf has been lamed by
an accident suffered while his parents suc
cumbed to passion nearby, and Alfred has
never forgiven himself or his wife. Alfred is
a cold fish in general, where his wife is con
cerned , and when Eyolf drowns , Alfred
leaves the human plane altogether.
The play operates on realistic and sym
bolic levels, and the symbolic aspects are a
little obtrusive. I'd have enjoyed the play a
lot more if it had been about incest and
adultery and guilt; while those things were
in the plot, the play is more concerned with

human responsibility and the mean
inglessness of life and man's proper occupa
tions. and two hours of pontificating on
those subjects gets a little tiring.
It also handicaps the actors. The dialogue
is so dead that more-than-normal talent
would be required to bring it to life Karyn
Dietz, who plays Alfred's half-sister, has
more than enough; she perfectly captured
Asta's air of light-hearted reserve. Steve
Vineberg, as Alfred, and Gail Anderson, as
his wife Rita, did not fare so well. Vineberg
brought too much energy to his role, over
playing most of his scenes; he seemed to get
more keyed-up as the play went on, stepping
on several of his wife's lines in the climactic
scene. Vineberg did give us a coherent sense
of his character, something which Anderson
did not. Rita is the play's most demanding
role, and Anderson projected the same
snide bitchiness whether the role called for
her to be a sex-kitten or loving wife.
Despite problems of performance, the
Drama Dept. production of Little Eyolf is
interesting and attractive. It runs through
Sunday in the Nitery (Old Union), with per
formances tonight, tomorrow night and Sat
urday at 8 and Saturday and Sunday
matinees at 2:30 p.m.


A happy moment for Allmers (Steve Vineberg) and Asta (Karen Dietz) in the Drama Dept. production
of Ibsen's "Little Eyolf."
The current Drama Dept. production of
Henrik Ibsen s Little Eyolf points up sever
al tendencies apparent in the Department's
presentations over the last few years. The
technical values — costumes, set. and light
ing — are excellent. The production is
always good to look at. But it isn't always so
good to watch, because once again the per
formances are not up to the same standard.
This is probably to be expected. Sets and
lighting tend to be done, or at least super
vised, by faculty members, often pro
fessionals in their fields. The actors aren't
— shouldn't be — professionals. While there
is nothing wrong with this situation, the dif
ferences in quality can be hard for the
viewer to reconcile.
Little Eyolf takes place at the head of a
fjord, and William Eddelman has designed
a wonderful, abstract mountain valley that
hems in the action and the characters' lives
alike White cardboard tubes of uniform
length hang by white string in varying
slopes around and behind the stage, which
consists of one large and one small platform
which alternately serve as morning-room,
seashore, and upland meadow. The com
bination of abstract scenerv and staidly re

alistic furniture (in the first two acts) gives
a nice sense of simplicity without bareness
