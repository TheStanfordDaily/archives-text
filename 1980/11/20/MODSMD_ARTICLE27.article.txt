# UC-Berkeley's "Henry IV" fair
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
There is an obsession with madness in
modern art. Luigi Pirandello's drama Hen
ry IV is very much in that tradition.
Perhaps much of what was novel and rev
olutionary in 1922 has become a worn-out
metaphor. In the age of psychodrama and
primal scream therapy need we be re
minded that all of our social realities are
masks?
We have been bombarded by the existen
tialists, the absurdists, the dadaists, the
minimalists, etc. (not necessarily in that or
der), each of whom have been exalting the
absurdity of life, telling us how little sepa
rates us from those we choose to call mad.
Some fans of Phillipe de Broca's King of
Hearts may even claim that the roles of the
sane and the mad have been reversed. It is
the mad that are closer to reality. Henry IV
argues along the same lines.
Pirandello had first-hand experience with
madness. His wife's mental health de
teriorated until she had to be put away. He
told a journalist: "There is nothing fixed
and determined. We have in us every possi
bility, and suddenly, unexpectedly, the thief
or the lunatic can jump out of any of us."

There is another and subtle point the play
makes which the current production by the
UC-Berkeley Drama Dept. misses by set
ting the play in contemporary times rather
than in the '20s, a period of rising fascism in
Italy. Henry IV is a criticism of the social
"madness" Pirandello saw around him.
The play follows the attempted cure of an
aging aristocrat, who as a result of an un
fortunate accident believes himself to be
Henry IV. the 11th-century German em
peror.
His madness was caused by a concussion
suffered when he fell from a horse during a
masquerade procession 20 years earlier.
He and all his friends were dressed up as
famous aristocrats of history of their own
choosing. While the others changed back to
their normal selves, Henry IV remained
Henry IV, surrounding himself with a group
of courtiers robed in medieval costumes to
complete the illusion. Henry IV re-lived his
tory according to the book, isolated in his
Umbrian villa.
The problem is that for the past seven
years Henry IV has been cured but has de
liberately continued to live in his imaginary
world, unable to face the real one. He even

begins to take pleasure in his performance.
He cannot face the world that has lived 12
years which for him did not exist at all.
The Cal Drama Dept. production is fair,
but discrepancies in cast quality make it dif
ficult to take the production seriously.
For a student production. Jeffrey Mason
as Henry IV and Robin Schild as Baron Tito
Belcredi do very well, but Margaret Rvnn
as Frida and Stephen Sloane as the Marquis
Carlo di Nolli do not escape looking like two
high school students trying their best.
William Oliver's direction does a good
deal of harm to the play. For some reason
Oliver has the idea that all Italians are
chain smokers. So the actors fumble in their
pockets, light each other's cigarettes, steal
them from each other, try gracefully to put
them out with pretended finesse that looks
more like clumsiness. This cigarette ex
travaganza goes on throughout the play, fill
ing the stage with a dense cloud of smoke
(they should be glad that Proposition 10 has
been defeated).
If you are interested in seeing a play of
ideas and are too lazy to read Henry IV then
this production is for you. Otherwise it is
probably not worth the trip to Berkeley.

olutionary in 1922 has become a worn-out
metaphor. In the age of psychodrama and
primal scream therapy need we be re
minded that all of our social realities are
masks?
We have been bombarded by the existen
tialists, the absurdists, the dadaists, the
minimalists, etc. (not necessarily in that or
der), each of whom have been exalting the
absurdity of life, telling us how little sepa
rates us from those we choose to call mad.
Some fans of Phillipe de Broca's King of
Hearts may even claim that the roles of the
sane and the mad have been reversed. It is
the mad that are closer to reality. Henry IV
argues along the same lines.
Pirandello had first-hand experience with
madness. His wife's mental health de
teriorated until she had to be put away. He
told a journalist: "There is nothing fixed
and determined. We have in us every possi
bility, and suddenly, unexpectedly, the thief
or the lunatic can jump out of any of us."

There is another and subtle point the play
makes which the current production by the
UC-Berkeley Drama Dept. misses by set
ting the play in contemporary times rather
than in the '20s, a period of rising fascism in
Italy. Henry IV is a criticism of the social
"madness" Pirandello saw around him.
The play follows the attempted cure of an
aging aristocrat, who as a result of an un
fortunate accident believes himself to be
Henry IV. the 11th-century German em
peror.
His madness was caused by a concussion
suffered when he fell from a horse during a
masquerade procession 20 years earlier.
He and all his friends were dressed up as
famous aristocrats of history of their own
choosing. While the others changed back to
their normal selves, Henry IV remained
Henry IV, surrounding himself with a group
of courtiers robed in medieval costumes to
complete the illusion. Henry IV re-lived his
tory according to the book, isolated in his
Umbrian villa.
The problem is that for the past seven
years Henry IV has been cured but has de
liberately continued to live in his imaginary
world, unable to face the real one. He even

begins to take pleasure in his performance.
He cannot face the world that has lived 12
years which for him did not exist at all.
The Cal Drama Dept. production is fair,
but discrepancies in cast quality make it dif
ficult to take the production seriously.
For a student production. Jeffrey Mason
as Henry IV and Robin Schild as Baron Tito
Belcredi do very well, but Margaret Rvnn
as Frida and Stephen Sloane as the Marquis
Carlo di Nolli do not escape looking like two
high school students trying their best.
William Oliver's direction does a good
deal of harm to the play. For some reason
Oliver has the idea that all Italians are
chain smokers. So the actors fumble in their
pockets, light each other's cigarettes, steal
them from each other, try gracefully to put
them out with pretended finesse that looks
more like clumsiness. This cigarette ex
travaganza goes on throughout the play, fill
ing the stage with a dense cloud of smoke
(they should be glad that Proposition 10 has
been defeated).
If you are interested in seeing a play of
ideas and are too lazy to read Henry IV then
this production is for you. Otherwise it is
probably not worth the trip to Berkeley.
