# Making sex more than a method
## 
### 
By Stephen Nash
Several years before Freud,
and several decades before the
current sexual revolution,
Frank Wedekind was writing
about sex. Not sex as a rather
private activity which leads to
child-bearing, but as a powerful
natural force trying to assert
itself in a very repressed socie
ty. Not surprisingly, Wedekind
did not have much success get
ting his plays produced (al
though Pandora's Box was
made into a silent film by Pabst
in 1928).
Spring Awakening,
Wedekind's first play, is cur
rently being performed by the
San Francisco Actor's En
semble. Since it has rarely been
staged in the 90 years since it
was written, this local per
formance is something of an
event. The play describes how a
group of 14-year-old school chil
dren discover their own sexual
ity, and how the inhibited socie

ty they live in tries to destroy
them because of their dis
coveries.
The central characters, two
schoolboys,Moritz and Melcior.
are best friends but have little in
common. Moritz is struggling to
keep up with his work and, when
he fails to be promoted to the
next level in school, he kills
himself. Investigating the rea
sons for his suicide, his teachers
discover a report entitled "On
Copulation" written for him by
Melchior. Because of this re
port, and because he made the
schoolgirl Wendla pregnant.
Melchior is sent to a re
formatory. Running away from
the reformatory, Melchior
comes upon the graves of Moritz
and Wendla (who died as a re
sult of an abortion). In the
graveyard. Moritz's ghost tries
to convince Melchior to join him
in death, but Melchior is per
suaded to continue living by the
Man in the Mask (presumably
Wedekind himself).
Wedekind's sympathies are
clearly with the children in this
play. Only one adult (Melchior's
mother) is portrayed natural
istically. Most of the others are
hideous caricatures and (in this
production) generally wear
masks. The schoolchildren are
innocents, victims of the adults
who constantly try to suppress
emotions and sexuality. The
most colorful character in the
play is Ilse. She is 15 years old,
has left school, and unabashedly
recounts her many and varied
experiences to Moritz just
before he kills himself.
Although originally written in
three acts, in this production the
play has been reduced to two by
deleting the first intermission.
As a result, act one now leads to
the suicide of Moritz, and act
two leads to the near suicide of
Melchior. In addition, many of
the minor roles have been re
moved from the play, either by
transferring speeches to other
characters, or by deleting small
sections of text. Both of these
changes have tightened the
play: the first by pointing out
more clearly the correspon

dence between Moritz and
Melchior. the second by remov
ing distracting characters and
by improving dramatic flow.
The directing (by Randall
Bianchi) worked to
clearly point out some of
Wedekind's ideas. Having the
adults wear masks helped to in
dicate Wedekind's contempt for
suppression of emotion. Be
cause many of the adults' lines
were removed in this prod
uction. it would be difficult to
make this point through acting
techniques alone. Bianchi's
direction also clarified the chil
dren's roles. For them, sexuali
ty is just one of many ideas run
ning through their heads. It may
be one of the ideas they under
stand least, but it is certainly
not the only issue at stake.
Seeing the children move casu
ally from exercising to picking
flowers to doing homework to
kissing each other was effective
in pointing this out.
In general, the children s
roles were well performed. I
was especially pleased by
Felicia Von Drak (Wendla),

Randall Stuart (Moritz), and
Blaine Palmer (Melchior). who
did a good job of expressing the
confusion of puberty. Shelley
Fine was appropriately lusty as
Use With the exception of
Jamie Lerner as Melchior's
mother. I was less pleased with
the adults. The actors seemed to
have trouble playing the
caricatured roles with convic
tion.
In the years since it was writ
ten. Spring Awakening has lost
much of its shock value This is
not such a bad thing. In 1980. we
are able to treat Wedekind's
ideas as something more than
cultural dynamite. Wedekind
was radicai not just because he
dared have a character say
"penis and vagina," but also be
cause he realized that sex was
more than just a method for hus
band and wife to produce chil
dren Even when he was only 26
years old, way back in 1890, he
knew that sex was a way for any
two people to communicate
with each other, and that sex
had many strong connections
with power and violence.

coveries.
The central characters, two

are best friends but have little in
common. Moritz is struggling to
keep up with his work and, when
he fails to be promoted to the
next level in school, he kills
himself. Investigating the rea
sons for his suicide, his teachers
discover a report entitled "On
Copulation" written for him by
Melchior. Because of this re
port, and because he made the
schoolgirl Wendla pregnant.
Melchior is sent to a re
formatory. Running away from
the reformatory, Melchior
comes upon the graves of Moritz
and Wendla (who died as a re
sult of an abortion). In the
graveyard. Moritz's ghost tries
to convince Melchior to join him
in death, but Melchior is per
suaded to continue living by the
Man in the Mask (presumably
Wedekind himself).
Wedekind's sympathies are
clearly with the children in this
play. Only one adult (Melchior's
mother) is portrayed natural
istically. Most of the others are
hideous caricatures and (in this
production) generally wear
masks. The schoolchildren are
innocents, victims of the adults
who constantly try to suppress
emotions and sexuality. The
most colorful character in the
play is Ilse. She is 15 years old,
has left school, and unabashedly
recounts her many and varied
experiences to Moritz just
before he kills himself.
Although originally written in
three acts, in this production the
play has been reduced to two by
deleting the first intermission.
As a result, act one now leads to
the suicide of Moritz, and act
two leads to the near suicide of
Melchior. In addition, many of
the minor roles have been re
moved from the play, either by
transferring speeches to other
characters, or by deleting small
sections of text. Both of these
changes have tightened the
play: the first by pointing out
more clearly the correspon

dence between Moritz and
Melchior. the second by remov
ing distracting characters and
by improving dramatic flow.
The directing (by Randall
Bianchi) worked to
clearly point out some of
Wedekind's ideas. Having the
adults wear masks helped to in
dicate Wedekind's contempt for
suppression of emotion. Be
cause many of the adults' lines
were removed in this prod
uction. it would be difficult to
make this point through acting
techniques alone. Bianchi's
direction also clarified the chil
dren's roles. For them, sexuali
ty is just one of many ideas run

be one of the ideas they under

not the only issue at stake.
Seeing the children move casu

in pointing this out.

Several years before Freud,
and several decades before the
current sexual revolution,
Frank Wedekind was writing
about sex. Not sex as a rather
private activity which leads to
child-bearing, but as a powerful
natural force trying to assert
itself in a very repressed socie
ty. Not surprisingly, Wedekind
did not have much success get
ting his plays produced (al
though Pandora's Box was
made into a silent film by Pabst
in 1928).
Spring Awakening,
Wedekind's first play, is cur
rently being performed by the
San Francisco Actor's En
semble. Since it has rarely been
staged in the 90 years since it
was written, this local per
formance is something of an
event. The play describes how a
group of 14-year-old school chil
dren discover their own sexual
ity, and how the inhibited socie

ty they live in tries to destroy
them because of their dis
coveries.
