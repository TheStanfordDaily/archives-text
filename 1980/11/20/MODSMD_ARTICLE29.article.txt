# Godard gives no easy answers

### Jim Mattson 
The credits tell us that Every
Man for Himself is a film "com
posed by" Jean-Luc Godard
The description is an accurate
one; the movie feels like a con
cert piece, albeit a very unusual
one. Godard. the most political
ly active of the French New
Wave filmmakers, has or
chestrated a bleak, disturbing
vision of human dependence and
independence. The characters
are as locked into their lives and
lifestyles as notes in a sym
phony.
Every Man For Himself is
Godard's first feature film in
eight years. In the past. Godard
has gone out of his way to show
us that film is not life; charac
ters in his movies turn to the
camera rebelliously and remind
us that they're really actors in
disguise. His films became car
toon caricatures of films: their

outlines became coarser and
their messages turned into
balloons over characters'
heads.
refuses to allow his
audiences to remain passive:
his viewers must constantly in
terpret. and reevaluate, the im
age on the screen. A film like
Weekend was (an intertitle in
formed us) a film "found on a
trash heap." and any value it
possessed came from what we
gave it. (Godard would have
been pleased. I think, by a Stan
ford audience's reaction to
Weekend a few years ago: mid
way through they began to
chant, "stop the film, stop the
film J" He had provoked a pas
sive audience into revolution.)
At first, Every Man for
Himself seems to mark a return
to a classical narrative form.
The characters never tell us
they're only characters: the ed
iting strategies are more-or
less in the standard pattern of
shot/reaction shot. The movie
seems to be moving some

where: there is a ghost of a
story about a video producer's
unhappy love affair and a prosti
tute's search for a better life It
may be autobiographical (the
producer's name is "Paul God
ard"); it may be about the craft
and contrivance of film itself
(the prostitute, played stun
ningly by Isabelle Huppert, is
named "Isabelle").
But, the more we try to under
stand the plot the more confus
ing the movie becomes. In some
ways, this may be Godard's
least accessible film. By pin
ning his themes onto a tortu
ously convoluted story, he
draws us into the film only to
stop us cold when we become
too involved He introduces new
characters and deemphasizes
the ones that have become fa
miliar; he superimposes the
thoughts of one character over

the actions of a second, making
characters blend and shift
before our eyes
The key to Every Man for
Himself is to accept this push
pull effect as part of the mean
ing of the film: this is a case of
structure mirroring theme.
Godard materializes desire and
frustration by employing stop
motion and slow motion
throughout the film, literally
turning human emotions into
mechanical actions. Our ex
perience with the film's story
makes us feel as locked-in and
trapped as the characters. God
ard is orchestrator of the film's
images; he is also the or
chestrator of our reactions to
them.
Every Man for Himself
presents a vision of human rela
tionships that is shatteringly
cold The characters speak at,
not to. each other: all rela
tionships — husband and wife,
father and daughter, friend and
friend — seem to be based on
power plays and dreams of emp

tv passion
Godard gives us an incredible
amount to look at and think
about; all seems somehow re
lated to a more general theme
but it's not always clear (rath
er, it's almost never clear) how
to interpret it. A woman named
Denise is working on a novel;
her thoughts often drift over the
soundtrack like laundry lists:
"tomorrow I will paint that
room. The next day . Music
plays on the soundtrack, and
characters look up in surprise:
"what's that music?" The char
acter Godard visits his young
daughter, and the two exchange
insults and sexual slurs. All
seem to be indicative of a gener
al anomie — theirs is a state of
displacement, of being uncom
fortable with how things are
going but being powerless to
enact a change.
Three scenes stand out as
being crucial ones. All involve
the prostitute. Isabelle; she is at
once the most self-driven char
acter in the film and the most
oppressed. Her scenes have an
emotional power lacking in the
rest of the film: we identify with
her stoicism and with her fear.
In one scene, we see her
dragged into her pimp's car and
beaten for not turning over what
she has made. No one is inde
pendent. he tells her (and makes
her repeat) — not the waitress,
nor the college girl, nor the
bourgeoise. His conclusion is
that the only one who is inde
pendent is the banker.
In a later scene. Isabelle goes
to a banker's apartment. Still
talking on the phone, he has her
undress; he fondles her while
making deals with his
anonymous agent. He hangs up.
and has Isabelle go out into the
hall and come in again to whis
per obscenities to her invisible
"mother." The scene ends with
Isabelle again out in the hall, ov
erhearing what we must assume
is the banker's wife telling him
that he never does the right
thing. This banker, at least, is
not independent either: though
he makes deals and controls oth
er people's lives, he himself is
sadly repressed He has power ;
it is self-respect that he lacks.
In a third scene. Isabelle goes
to another banker's apartment.
Waiting for her is the banker,
his assistant, and another pros
titute. This banker seems more
successful than the one in the
earlier scene: he manipulates
his assistant and the prostitutes
into following his wishes. At the
scene's conclusion, he sets up a
sexual roundel that has him as
its beginning and end. The only
"reward" he receives is having
his lips painted with Isabelle's
lipstick: his sexual gratification
comes from knowing that he has
total control of those around
him.
In these three scenes. Godard
brilliantly works out a
scnematic of power. The
bankers are the ones who can af
ford to be independent, and they
use their independence only to
manipulate the lives of others.
This sense of the arbitrariness
of power pervades Every Man

for Himself. The film is vir
tually crystalline in its ex
pression of patterns of repres
sion — the characters are
locked into their places in life
and cannot escape This film
"composed by" Godard is most
musical when it is darkest his
is a symphony of despair.
This makes the end. with its
suggestion of hope, all the more
striking (One suspects, how
ever. that this might appear to
be hope only because the rest of
the film is so utterly bleak.)
Godard is struck by a car while
his ex-wife and daughter look
on They leave him there, and
walk on out of his life. They
pass byan orchestra which has
inexplicably appeared on the
street: for the first time they
(and we) see the "source" of the
music that runs through the
film. We must acknowledge
some of the conventions of nar
rative cinema (like the
waitress, the moviegoer is not
independent — the only one who
is independent is the director).
Seeing the orchestra playing,
we begin to realize how the film
has manipulated us — and we
come a little closer to being
free.
Every Man for Himself gives
us no easy answers; every pos
sible solution is flanked by prob
lems. Godard's aim is to engage
and enrage us. He succeeds, ad
mirably.

now playing at the Aquarius
Theater. Palo Alto.)
