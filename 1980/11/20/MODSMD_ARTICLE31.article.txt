# Feather talks of jazz women's fix
## 
### Leo Dawber 
Jazz fans must be uncomfortably aware
of the profound psychological and pro
fessional barriers to acceptance, even to
day. of women as jazz musicians. It is ironic
that a medium which did so much to break
down racial barriers (on the bandstand and
in the audience, as jazz clubs were the first
place where interracial couples could relax
safely in public) remains so dominated by
men Women musicians throughout the his
tory of jazz have struggled against social re
strictions opposing their entering the some
times seamy jazz life, as well as the con
flicts of family and career.
This topic was the theme of Tuesday
night's lecture and film presentation by
Leonard Feather, the first of three by the
noted critic and producer. Feather spoke
briefly of the role of women in jazz and their
particular hardships, but the films he
showed spoke more pointedly than any lec
ture could have about the ways that black
women had to perform in order to entertain
the white audiences of 20 and more years
ago.
Not surprisingly, the most obnoxious ex
ample of this was the oldest film, a 1929
short called St. Louis Blues, starring Bessie
Smith, arguably the greatest blues singer
ever. There is a 10-minute plot to set up the
performance of the title song, complete
with craps game, shuffling janitor, and a
slippery, two-faced Sportin' Life character
as the male lead. After Bessie's man dumps
her, she retreats to a bar, where she sings
the blues, as the customers form a ridicu
lous gospel chorus to back her. Yet in spite
of the ugly plot and tasteless musical ar
rangement, the power and magnificence of
her voice and the blues prevail, especially

when she is allowed to solo.
The most natural setting was. surprising
ly, a 1962 television show that simply re
corded serious musicians at work. Steve Al
len produced a half-hour series called Jazz
Scene USA, and we were treated to a show
featuring the Vi Redd Septet. This show was
notable not only because a woman was the
headliner, but because Redd played a hot
alto saxophone and sang, rather than re
stricting herself to the traditional female
roles of pianist or vocalist. She had ex
cellent support, including Herb Ellis on
guitar and Carmell Jones on trumpet, plus a
real surprise: a very young Roy Avers on
vibes, before he entered his "easy-listen
ing" phase. Although a little wooden at
first, she loosened up for excellent solos on
"1 Remember Bird" and "Anthropology,"
the latter containing some very pointed pro
civil rights lyrics contributed for the occa
sion by Leonard Feather. It is dismaying,
but perhaps not surprising, that Vi Redd's
two albums are now unavailable, and that,
unable to make a living in jazz, she is now a
school teacher.
Short examples of the work of Sarah
Vaughan. Pearl Bailey and, best of all,
Billie Holliday were also shown. "God Bless
the Child" was sung with all the beauty and
radiance of Holliday's voice, and we can
look forward to another clip of hers to be
shown at a later lecture.
Finally, Feather apologized for departing
from the theme of the evening, but was hap
pily forgiven by the audience for showing
the only existing film of the great Charlie
Parker—a television clip in which he and
Dizzy Gillespie were presented the 1951
downbeat awards. They blazed away at
"Hot House," accompanied by an inaudible

rhythm section, but their own solos were
well preserved. Parker appeared complete
ly sedate, remaining amazingly motionless
daring the most demanding or expressive
sections of his wonderful solo. Gillespie, on
the other hand, eyed the camera
malevolently, showing none of the charm
and showmanship that distinguishes his per
formances. This was fascinating history.
Because, as Feather pointed out, jazz was
never the subject of scholarly research until
recently, the jazz film legacy is dismal.
Bigotry and ignorance on the part of film
producers prevented them from recog
nizing early jazz as an art form worthy of
preserving for those who were not there to
hear it. Yet, the clips we do have give con
crete. striking evidence of the musical ex
citement of their times at the same time as
they testify to the sad state of the American
music business. It is unfortunate that we
cannot point to contemporary improve
ments in the status of women in jazz, but Vi
Redd's position is probably true of women
musicians today (20 years later): they are
considered prodigies or novelties, and are
passed over for the meat-and-potato jobs
that are a musician's livelihood.
Feather mentioned Fostina Dixon, Ann
Patterson and Ursula Dudziak as three
young women who are making significant
contributions to today's scene. To this list
may be added the more mature talents of
Mary Lou Williams. Marian McPartland,
Sarah Vaughan. Betty Carter and Toshiko
Akiyoshi as undervalued musicians. Per
haps their careers will benefit from the suc
cesses of the feminist movement and from
the recent Women in Jazz festivals held an
nually in Kansas City. Let us hope so, for
there is much to be gained.

rangement, the power and magnificence of
her voice and the blues prevail, especially

when she is allowed to solo.
The most natural setting was. surprising
ly, a 1962 television show that simply re
corded serious musicians at work. Steve Al
len produced a half-hour series called Jazz
Scene USA, and we were treated to a show
featuring the Vi Redd Septet. This show was
notable not only because a woman was the
headliner, but because Redd played a hot
alto saxophone and sang, rather than re
stricting herself to the traditional female
roles of pianist or vocalist. She had ex
cellent support, including Herb Ellis on
guitar and Carmell Jones on trumpet, plus a
real surprise: a very young Roy Avers on
vibes, before he entered his "easy-listen
ing" phase. Although a little wooden at
first, she loosened up for excellent solos on
"1 Remember Bird" and "Anthropology,"
the latter containing some very pointed pro
civil rights lyrics contributed for the occa
sion by Leonard Feather. It is dismaying,
but perhaps not surprising, that Vi Redd's
two albums are now unavailable, and that,
unable to make a living in jazz, she is now a
school teacher.
Short examples of the work of Sarah
Vaughan. Pearl Bailey and, best of all,
Billie Holliday were also shown. "God Bless
the Child" was sung with all the beauty and
radiance of Holliday's voice, and we can
look forward to another clip of hers to be
shown at a later lecture.
Finally, Feather apologized for departing
from the theme of the evening, but was hap
pily forgiven by the audience for showing
the only existing film of the great Charlie
Parker—a television clip in which he and
Dizzy Gillespie were presented the 1951
downbeat awards. They blazed away at
"Hot House," accompanied by an inaudible

rhythm section, but their own solos were
well preserved. Parker appeared complete
ly sedate, remaining amazingly motionless
daring the most demanding or expressive
sections of his wonderful solo. Gillespie, on
the other hand, eyed the camera
malevolently, showing none of the charm
and showmanship that distinguishes his per
formances. This was fascinating history.
Because, as Feather pointed out, jazz was
never the subject of scholarly research until
recently, the jazz film legacy is dismal.
Bigotry and ignorance on the part of film
producers prevented them from recog
nizing early jazz as an art form worthy of
preserving for those who were not there to
hear it. Yet, the clips we do have give con
crete. striking evidence of the musical ex
citement of their times at the same time as
they testify to the sad state of the American
music business. It is unfortunate that we
cannot point to contemporary improve
ments in the status of women in jazz, but Vi
Redd's position is probably true of women
musicians today (20 years later): they are
considered prodigies or novelties, and are
passed over for the meat-and-potato jobs
that are a musician's livelihood.
Feather mentioned Fostina Dixon, Ann
Patterson and Ursula Dudziak as three
young women who are making significant
contributions to today's scene. To this list
may be added the more mature talents of
Mary Lou Williams. Marian McPartland,
Sarah Vaughan. Betty Carter and Toshiko
Akiyoshi as undervalued musicians. Per
haps their careers will benefit from the suc
cesses of the feminist movement and from
the recent Women in Jazz festivals held an
nually in Kansas City. Let us hope so, for
there is much to be gained.
Jazz fans must be uncomfortably aware
of the profound psychological and pro
fessional barriers to acceptance, even to
day. of women as jazz musicians. It is ironic
that a medium which did so much to break
down racial barriers (on the bandstand and
in the audience, as jazz clubs were the first
place where interracial couples could relax
safely in public) remains so dominated by
men Women musicians throughout the his
tory of jazz have struggled against social re
strictions opposing their entering the some
times seamy jazz life, as well as the con
flicts of family and career.
This topic was the theme of Tuesday
night's lecture and film presentation by
Leonard Feather, the first of three by the
noted critic and producer. Feather spoke
briefly of the role of women in jazz and their
particular hardships, but the films he
showed spoke more pointedly than any lec
ture could have about the ways that black
women had to perform in order to entertain
the white audiences of 20 and more years
ago.
Not surprisingly, the most obnoxious ex
ample of this was the oldest film, a 1929
short called St. Louis Blues, starring Bessie
Smith, arguably the greatest blues singer
ever. There is a 10-minute plot to set up the
performance of the title song, complete
with craps game, shuffling janitor, and a
slippery, two-faced Sportin' Life character
as the male lead. After Bessie's man dumps
her, she retreats to a bar, where she sings
the blues, as the customers form a ridicu
lous gospel chorus to back her. Yet in spite
of the ugly plot and tasteless musical ar
rangement, the power and magnificence of
her voice and the blues prevail, especially

when she is allowed to solo.
