Reagan meets with Washington
Washington - President-elect Ronald Reagan played the
role yesterday of a Very Important Tourist, dining in a fa
mous Senate hearing room with his Republican allies and
telling them "we have a mandate not so much . . to gov
ern as a mandate to serve."
"The people of this country have told us, all of us now,
they want something different They want a change. They
want an America that serves them." Reagan said
He promised, in an apparent break with tradition in
which presidents visit Congress only for formal speeches,
to travel up Capitol Hill for consultations with the House
and Senate.
While a constant claque of tourists gawked at his com
ings and goings in the nation's sun-bathed capital, thepres
ident-elect, in the midst of a triumphant introduction to
Washington, continued to familiarize himself with the
city's competing power centers.
After the Capitol Hill luncheon, he held a private au
dience with eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court
and later was visited at his temporary residence near the
White House by Sen. John Tower, said to be at the top of his
list of candidates for secretary of defense, and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
Sen. Kennedy, who ran unsuccessfully for
the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters as
he left his meeting with Reagan, "I do believe now that the
American people want cooperation and I came here today
to express mine."
Kennedy, who had asked for the meeting, said the dis
cussion touched on the economy and the need to eliminate
government waste. He also said he expressed "full sup
port" for Reagan's efforts to reach a strategic arms
agreement with the Soviet Union
Israeli no confidence vote defeated
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin rallied
his dwindling political forces yesterday to defeat a motion
of no confidence in his government's economic policy, but
former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman dealt a sharp
blow to Begin by voting to bring down the government.
Begin's coalition survived on a 57-54 vote with two
abstentions — the slimmest margin in a no-confidence bid
since he became Israel's prime minister in 1977.
Begin cut short a U.S. visit to cast his vote against a mo
tion offered by the opposition Labor Party to protest an an
nual inflation rate of more than 130 percent and a con
sumer price increase of 11 percent in October.
Government policy also was under attack from Israeli
liberals over the shooting and wounding of 10 Palestinian
student demonstrators Tuesday during clashes with the
army in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
Iran seeks 'decisive victory'
Baghdad, Iraq —Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
said yesterday his people were determined to achieve a
"decisive victory" in the war against Iraq while Iraq
vowed to "cut off the hand" that attacks Kuwait or any
other Arab country. Iran claimed to be pushing Iraqi
forces back from tv o Iranian cities.
On the diploma; ic front, former Swedish Prime Min
ister Olaf Palme, on a peace-seeking mission in Tehran for
the United Nations, will meet today with Bani-Sadr and

Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai, a U.N. spokesman
in New York said The spokesman said Palme conferred
yesterday with Cuban Ambassador Alberto Valasquez,
whose country is spearheading non-aligned peace efforts.
Palme is to travel to Baghdad later this week
"Our nation is prepared for the hardships and sacrifices
of the war. but it is in no way prepared to accept the condi
tions of (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's govern
ment." Bani-Sadr told a religious holiday crowd estimated
at one million in Tehran, according to the Iranian news
agency Pars.
Pope confronted by youth leader
Munich, West Germany — A Catholic youth
leader confronted Pope John Paul II yesterday, attacking
"too many prohibitions" in church teachings on sex and
the Vatican's confining role for women. The pontiff sat six
feet away with bowed head and clasped hands, and did not
respond when she had finished.
Barbara Engl, 29. local chairwoman of the League of
German Catholic Youth, lectured the pope in front of an
audience of a half million greeters just a few hours before
he departed for Rome.
She told the pope in a clear, steady voice that "youths'
questions on friendship, sexuality partnership are often
answered with prohibitions rather than understanding."
Ms. Engl asserted that many young people failed to un
derstand the church "because it clings fearfully to the sta
tus quo" on matters of sex, marriage, priestly celibacy
and the role of women.
Special election for canal considered
Sacramento — A Southern California legislator said yes
terday he will introduce a bill to set a special election on
the Peripheral Canal referendum for next June 2.
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Anaheim), said waiting
until the 1982 primary would inflate cost of the $600 million
canal by $90 million.
The plan to build a 43-mile canal around the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta to carry Sacramento River wa
ter to the California Aqueduct for export south was ap
proved narrowly by the Legislature earlier this year.
Opponents qualified a referendum for the next state
wide ballot .giving the people a chance to approve or reject
the Legislature's action. It is the first referendum to quali
fy for a California ballot since 1952.
The project is automatically delayed until the referen
dum is voted upon. Opponents say construction could not
start for more than two years anyway.
The next statewide vote will be in June 1962 unless the
governor, or the Legislature, calls a special election
earlier.
Meanwhile, a group of Northern California legislators
said they had urged Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. not to call a
special election, but to wait for the June 1962 primary. And
they said they didn t think Johnson could muster the neces
sary two-thirds vote to get a special election bill through
the Legislature
The northerners, led by Sen. John Nejedly (R-Walnut
Creek). said a special election would cost $8 to $12 million,
would bring out fewer voters than the primary, and would
deprive canal opponents of time needed to "educate"
Southern Californians about the cost of the project.

PG&E abandons plans for oil port
San Francisco — After seven years of pitched battle
with environmentalists and bureaucrats. Pacific Gas &
Electric Co decided yesterday to abandon plans to build a
new offshore oil tanker mooring in Monterey Bay.
"We continue to believe a new terminal would offer
positive environmental, operational and economic bene
fits." Donald Brand, PG&E vice president of engineering,
said in a prepared statement.
"However, the prospects of further regulatory delay,
caused in part bv public concern about the safety of larger
oil tankers operating in Monterey Bay. has prompted us to
discontinue the project." Brand said
The mooring, built in 1949. is used to supply crude oil
from seagoing tankers to the utility's huge Moss Landing
power plant, one of the world's largest oil-burning power
production facilities. PG&E wanted to build a new moor
ing that could handle tankers weighing up to 90,000 tons.
The utility had defended its plans, saying the new facility
would reduce the risk of oil spills in the bay because the use
of larger tankers would mean fewer ships would use the
mooring.

Market slips back after gains
The stock market retreated yesterday, yielding to some
late selling after the Dow Jones industrial average made a
brief foray past the 1000 level for the first time in almost
four years.
The widely recognized average of 30 blue chips, coming
off an 11.69 gain Tuesday, pushed past the 1,000 mark
shortly after 11 a.m.
But a little more than an hour later it began to slip back.
By the close it stood at 991.04, down 6.91 from Tuesday.
New York Stock Exchange volume of 69.23 million
shares was the sixth heaviest total on record, though it fell
a bit short of Tuesday's 70.38 million.
The average reached its record closing high of 1,051 70
on Jan. 11, 1973.
Today's Weather
Fair and hazy through Friday. Lows in the 40s to low 50s
Highs in the mid 60s to low 70s. Northwest winds to 15 mph

Reagan meets with Washington
Washington - President-elect Ronald Reagan played the
role yesterday of a Very Important Tourist, dining in a fa
mous Senate hearing room with his Republican allies and
telling them "we have a mandate not so much . . to gov
ern as a mandate to serve."
"The people of this country have told us, all of us now,
they want something different They want a change. They
want an America that serves them." Reagan said
He promised, in an apparent break with tradition in
which presidents visit Congress only for formal speeches,
to travel up Capitol Hill for consultations with the House
and Senate.
While a constant claque of tourists gawked at his com
ings and goings in the nation's sun-bathed capital, thepres
ident-elect, in the midst of a triumphant introduction to
Washington, continued to familiarize himself with the
city's competing power centers.
After the Capitol Hill luncheon, he held a private au
dience with eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court
and later was visited at his temporary residence near the
White House by Sen. John Tower, said to be at the top of his
list of candidates for secretary of defense, and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
Sen. Kennedy, who ran unsuccessfully for
the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters as
he left his meeting with Reagan, "I do believe now that the
American people want cooperation and I came here today
to express mine."
Kennedy, who had asked for the meeting, said the dis
cussion touched on the economy and the need to eliminate
government waste. He also said he expressed "full sup
port" for Reagan's efforts to reach a strategic arms
agreement with the Soviet Union
Israeli no confidence vote defeated
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin rallied
his dwindling political forces yesterday to defeat a motion
of no confidence in his government's economic policy, but
former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman dealt a sharp
blow to Begin by voting to bring down the government.
Begin's coalition survived on a 57-54 vote with two
abstentions — the slimmest margin in a no-confidence bid
since he became Israel's prime minister in 1977.
Begin cut short a U.S. visit to cast his vote against a mo
tion offered by the opposition Labor Party to protest an an
nual inflation rate of more than 130 percent and a con
sumer price increase of 11 percent in October.
Government policy also was under attack from Israeli
liberals over the shooting and wounding of 10 Palestinian
student demonstrators Tuesday during clashes with the
army in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
Iran seeks 'decisive victory'
Baghdad, Iraq —Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
said yesterday his people were determined to achieve a
"decisive victory" in the war against Iraq while Iraq
vowed to "cut off the hand" that attacks Kuwait or any
other Arab country. Iran claimed to be pushing Iraqi
forces back from tv o Iranian cities.
On the diploma; ic front, former Swedish Prime Min
ister Olaf Palme, on a peace-seeking mission in Tehran for
the United Nations, will meet today with Bani-Sadr and

Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai, a U.N. spokesman
in New York said The spokesman said Palme conferred
yesterday with Cuban Ambassador Alberto Valasquez,
whose country is spearheading non-aligned peace efforts.
Palme is to travel to Baghdad later this week
"Our nation is prepared for the hardships and sacrifices
of the war. but it is in no way prepared to accept the condi
tions of (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's govern
ment." Bani-Sadr told a religious holiday crowd estimated
at one million in Tehran, according to the Iranian news

Pope confronted by youth leader
Munich, West Germany — A Catholic youth
leader confronted Pope John Paul II yesterday, attacking
"too many prohibitions" in church teachings on sex and
the Vatican's confining role for women. The pontiff sat six
feet away with bowed head and clasped hands, and did not
respond when she had finished.
Barbara Engl, 29. local chairwoman of the League of
German Catholic Youth, lectured the pope in front of an
audience of a half million greeters just a few hours before
he departed for Rome.
She told the pope in a clear, steady voice that "youths'
questions on friendship, sexuality partnership are often
answered with prohibitions rather than understanding."
Ms. Engl asserted that many young people failed to un
derstand the church "because it clings fearfully to the sta
tus quo" on matters of sex, marriage, priestly celibacy
and the role of women.
Special election for canal considered
Sacramento — A Southern California legislator said yes
terday he will introduce a bill to set a special election on
the Peripheral Canal referendum for next June 2.
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Anaheim), said waiting
until the 1982 primary would inflate cost of the $600 million
canal by $90 million.
The plan to build a 43-mile canal around the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta to carry Sacramento River wa
ter to the California Aqueduct for export south was ap
proved narrowly by the Legislature earlier this year.
Opponents qualified a referendum for the next state
wide ballot .giving the people a chance to approve or reject
the Legislature's action. It is the first referendum to quali
fy for a California ballot since 1952.
The project is automatically delayed until the referen
dum is voted upon. Opponents say construction could not
start for more than two years anyway.
The next statewide vote will be in June 1962 unless the
governor, or the Legislature, calls a special election
earlier.
Meanwhile, a group of Northern California legislators
said they had urged Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. not to call a
special election, but to wait for the June 1962 primary. And
they said they didn t think Johnson could muster the neces
sary two-thirds vote to get a special election bill through
the Legislature
The northerners, led by Sen. John Nejedly (R-Walnut
Creek). said a special election would cost $8 to $12 million,
would bring out fewer voters than the primary, and would
deprive canal opponents of time needed to "educate"
Southern Californians about the cost of the project.

PG&E abandons plans for oil port
San Francisco — After seven years of pitched battle
with environmentalists and bureaucrats. Pacific Gas &
Electric Co decided yesterday to abandon plans to build a
new offshore oil tanker mooring in Monterey Bay.
"We continue to believe a new terminal would offer
positive environmental, operational and economic bene
fits." Donald Brand, PG&E vice president of engineering,
said in a prepared statement.
"However, the prospects of further regulatory delay,
caused in part bv public concern about the safety of larger
oil tankers operating in Monterey Bay. has prompted us to
discontinue the project." Brand said
The mooring, built in 1949. is used to supply crude oil
from seagoing tankers to the utility's huge Moss Landing
power plant, one of the world's largest oil-burning power
production facilities. PG&E wanted to build a new moor
ing that could handle tankers weighing up to 90,000 tons.
The utility had defended its plans, saying the new facility
would reduce the risk of oil spills in the bay because the use
of larger tankers would mean fewer ships would use the
mooring.

Market slips back after gains
The stock market retreated yesterday, yielding to some
late selling after the Dow Jones industrial average made a
brief foray past the 1000 level for the first time in almost

The widely recognized average of 30 blue chips, coming

oil tankers operating in Monterey Bay. has prompted us to
discontinue the project." Brand said
The mooring, built in 1949. is used to supply crude oil
from seagoing tankers to the utility's huge Moss Landing
power plant, one of the world's largest oil-burning power
production facilities. PG&E wanted to build a new moor
ing that could handle tankers weighing up to 90,000 tons.
The utility had defended its plans, saying the new facility
would reduce the risk of oil spills in the bay because the use
of larger tankers would mean fewer ships would use the
mooring.

Market slips back after gains
The stock market retreated yesterday, yielding to some
late selling after the Dow Jones industrial average made a
brief foray past the 1000 level for the first time in almost
four years.
The widely recognized average of 30 blue chips, coming
off an 11.69 gain Tuesday, pushed past the 1,000 mark
shortly after 11 a.m.
But a little more than an hour later it began to slip back.
By the close it stood at 991.04, down 6.91 from Tuesday.
New York Stock Exchange volume of 69.23 million
shares was the sixth heaviest total on record, though it fell
a bit short of Tuesday's 70.38 million.
The average reached its record closing high of 1,051 70
on Jan. 11, 1973.

Reagan meets with Washington
Washington - President-elect Ronald Reagan played the
role yesterday of a Very Important Tourist, dining in a fa
mous Senate hearing room with his Republican allies and
telling them "we have a mandate not so much . . to gov
ern as a mandate to serve."
"The people of this country have told us, all of us now,
they want something different They want a change. They
want an America that serves them." Reagan said
He promised, in an apparent break with tradition in
which presidents visit Congress only for formal speeches,
to travel up Capitol Hill for consultations with the House
and Senate.
While a constant claque of tourists gawked at his com
ings and goings in the nation's sun-bathed capital, thepres
ident-elect, in the midst of a triumphant introduction to
Washington, continued to familiarize himself with the
city's competing power centers.
After the Capitol Hill luncheon, he held a private au
dience with eight of the nine justices of the Supreme Court
and later was visited at his temporary residence near the
White House by Sen. John Tower, said to be at the top of his
list of candidates for secretary of defense, and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
Sen. Kennedy, who ran unsuccessfully for
the Democratic presidential nomination, told reporters as
he left his meeting with Reagan, "I do believe now that the
American people want cooperation and I came here today
to express mine."
Kennedy, who had asked for the meeting, said the dis
cussion touched on the economy and the need to eliminate
government waste. He also said he expressed "full sup
port" for Reagan's efforts to reach a strategic arms
agreement with the Soviet Union
Israeli no confidence vote defeated
Jerusalem — Prime Minister Menachem Begin rallied
his dwindling political forces yesterday to defeat a motion
of no confidence in his government's economic policy, but
former Defense Minister Ezer Weizman dealt a sharp
blow to Begin by voting to bring down the government.
Begin's coalition survived on a 57-54 vote with two
abstentions — the slimmest margin in a no-confidence bid
since he became Israel's prime minister in 1977.
Begin cut short a U.S. visit to cast his vote against a mo
tion offered by the opposition Labor Party to protest an an
nual inflation rate of more than 130 percent and a con
sumer price increase of 11 percent in October.
Government policy also was under attack from Israeli
liberals over the shooting and wounding of 10 Palestinian
student demonstrators Tuesday during clashes with the
army in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
Iran seeks 'decisive victory'
Baghdad, Iraq —Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
said yesterday his people were determined to achieve a
"decisive victory" in the war against Iraq while Iraq
vowed to "cut off the hand" that attacks Kuwait or any
other Arab country. Iran claimed to be pushing Iraqi
forces back from tv o Iranian cities.
On the diploma; ic front, former Swedish Prime Min
ister Olaf Palme, on a peace-seeking mission in Tehran for
the United Nations, will meet today with Bani-Sadr and

Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Rajai, a U.N. spokesman
in New York said The spokesman said Palme conferred
yesterday with Cuban Ambassador Alberto Valasquez,
whose country is spearheading non-aligned peace efforts.
Palme is to travel to Baghdad later this week
"Our nation is prepared for the hardships and sacrifices
of the war. but it is in no way prepared to accept the condi
tions of (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein's govern
ment." Bani-Sadr told a religious holiday crowd estimated
at one million in Tehran, according to the Iranian news
agency Pars.
Pope confronted by youth leader
Munich, West Germany — A Catholic youth
leader confronted Pope John Paul II yesterday, attacking
"too many prohibitions" in church teachings on sex and
the Vatican's confining role for women. The pontiff sat six
feet away with bowed head and clasped hands, and did not
respond when she had finished.
Barbara Engl, 29. local chairwoman of the League of
German Catholic Youth, lectured the pope in front of an
audience of a half million greeters just a few hours before
he departed for Rome.
She told the pope in a clear, steady voice that "youths'
questions on friendship, sexuality partnership are often
answered with prohibitions rather than understanding."
Ms. Engl asserted that many young people failed to un
derstand the church "because it clings fearfully to the sta
tus quo" on matters of sex, marriage, priestly celibacy
and the role of women.
Special election for canal considered
Sacramento — A Southern California legislator said yes
terday he will introduce a bill to set a special election on
the Peripheral Canal referendum for next June 2.
Assemblyman Ross Johnson (R-Anaheim), said waiting
until the 1982 primary would inflate cost of the $600 million
canal by $90 million.
The plan to build a 43-mile canal around the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta to carry Sacramento River wa
ter to the California Aqueduct for export south was ap
proved narrowly by the Legislature earlier this year.
Opponents qualified a referendum for the next state
wide ballot .giving the people a chance to approve or reject
the Legislature's action. It is the first referendum to quali
fy for a California ballot since 1952.
The project is automatically delayed until the referen
dum is voted upon. Opponents say construction could not
start for more than two years anyway.
The next statewide vote will be in June 1962 unless the
governor, or the Legislature, calls a special election
earlier.
Meanwhile, a group of Northern California legislators
said they had urged Gov. Edmund Brown Jr. not to call a
special election, but to wait for the June 1962 primary. And
they said they didn t think Johnson could muster the neces
sary two-thirds vote to get a special election bill through
the Legislature
The northerners, led by Sen. John Nejedly (R-Walnut
Creek). said a special election would cost $8 to $12 million,
would bring out fewer voters than the primary, and would
deprive canal opponents of time needed to "educate"
Southern Californians about the cost of the project.

PG&E abandons plans for oil port
San Francisco — After seven years of pitched battle
with environmentalists and bureaucrats. Pacific Gas &
Electric Co decided yesterday to abandon plans to build a
new offshore oil tanker mooring in Monterey Bay.
"We continue to believe a new terminal would offer
positive environmental, operational and economic bene
fits." Donald Brand, PG&E vice president of engineering,
said in a prepared statement.
"However, the prospects of further regulatory delay,
