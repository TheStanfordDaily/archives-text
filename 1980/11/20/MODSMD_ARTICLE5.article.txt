# 'Some surprises 'promised
## Reagan receives cabinet ideas 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The capital's great
quadrennial guessing game — who's
going to get what job in the new Cabi
net? — has intensified now that Presi
dent-elect Ronald Reagan has re
ceived from his closest advisers a list
of semi-finalists for top government
jobs.
The list of about 30 names, hand
carried yesterday from California
where it was drafted by a transition
advisory panel, includes Nixon-Ford
era officials, several longtime Cali
fornia friends and advisers of Reagan,
a sprinkling of blacks and women and,
one source said, "some surprises."
It arrived in Washington as Reagan
moved through a round of meetings
with Republican members of the
House and Senate, Supreme Court jus
tices, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) and others, and as he prepared

to call on President Jimmy Carter at
the White House today.
Even before Reagan received the
list, trial balloons blossomed for some
prominent Republicans who. one of
Reagan's closest advisers said, were
actively campaigning for top-level
positions.
Aides said Reagan probably would
not focus on his Cabinet choices until
this weekend, when he will be back in
California and when his Cabinet ad
visory committee meets again in Los
Angeles. They said that the president
elect may add names of his own to the
list, and that consideration is being
given to announcing all Cabinet
choices shortly after Thanksgiving.
Several Reagan advisers and
spokesmen insisted that no final de
cisions have been made. But in
terviews with several sources, includ
ing some who claimed to have seen the

list, yielded some clear front-runners
for several top jobs.
George Shultz, who served as both
secretary of the Treasury and of La
bor during the Nixon and Ford years,
was reported to be the leading choice
for secretary of state. Others listed as
under consideration for the top foreign
policy post included Alexander Haig
Jr., former NATO commander who
was White House chief of staff when
Richard Nixon resigned; and Caspar
Weinberger, former secretary of
health, education and welfare and fed
eral budget director who servrd as
California's finance director when Re
agan was governor of that state.
William Simon, who was said to be
more interested in the Pentagon's top
slot, is considered to be the prime can
didate for Treasury secretary, a posi
tion he held during the Ford adminis
tration.
