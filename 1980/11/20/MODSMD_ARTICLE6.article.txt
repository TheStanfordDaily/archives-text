# Profs discuss changes in Spain after Franco
## 
### Cici Oremland 
Spain, as a developing Western na
tion, is experiencing both positive and
negative effects of its recent change of
regime from the fascist Franco dec
ades to the present parliamentary
monarchy of King Juan Carlos, ac
cording to academic experts who
spoke yesterday at a panel discussion
as part of the World in Crisis lecture
series.
The major problem, said panelists,
remains how to reconcile the pro-right
attitude of Carlos with the more mili
tant leftist faction of Prime Minister
Adolfo Suarez.
Prof. Gabriel Jackson of UC-San Di
ego stressed Franco's death, which
signalled the end of fascism in Spain,
was "a miracle that no one antici
pated ... but whether it will last is
something else."
Jackson said that under the two
year-old constitution instituted in De
cember 1978, regions of Spain are to be
granted local self-government.
Though not implemented yet on a wide
scale, Jackson said the Spanish cen
tral government is aiding in the areas'
desires for autonomy.
Jackson also cited evidence that the
average member of the Spanish public
is more articulate now in his dis
cussion of liberty and human rights.
With the new governmental leniency
toward freedom of expression, Jack
son also said that Spain has fewer po

litical prisoners today in exile and in
fact, there are currently more politi
cal refugees from other countries in
Spain.
"It isn't all black (in Spain) today,
pardons and absolutions occur," said
Prof. Richard Herrof UC-Berkeley.
But despite these trends, said Herr.
there are no new laws on the books and
existing laws are still utilized to a cer
tain degree.
The four panelists were quick to
elaborate on the current social and po
litical problems existing in Spain to
day. They were in agreement on what
the problems in Spain are, though each
panelist described different causes for
today's strife.
All panelists gave high priority to
the economic situation. Jackson said
there are two million unemployed peo
ple in Spain today, approximately 15
percent of the population. He said
tourism and its revenues are declining
and that Spanish workers abroad are
returning home because of the general
slowdown on the European financial
scene.
Prof. Joan Ullman of the University
of Washington attributed the econom
ic problem to an expansion of econom
ic goals without proper industrializa
tion of the Spanish people to assure ef
ficiency of Spanish society.
Jackson also mentioned the dis
illusionment of the Spanish populace
who had expected spiritual and cul
tural changes that have not yet mate
rialized.
Prof. Luis Ponce de Leon of Califor
nia State University at Hayward
elaborated on this notion by discussing
the fears of the Spanish middle class.
He said they fear the political ter
rorism and violence in the city streets.
The people are disappointed over the
high unemployment rate and the de
cline of tourism, he explained.
"It seems to me that they don't un
derstand the mechanisms of certain
things . . . they blame the new system
even though it is not directly its fault,"
he said.

quate — especially that for off-cam
pus events.
De Leon said graffiti signs saying
"Franco come back, we forgive you
all' are indicative of the feelings of
many members of the middle class.
Ullman said that the actions and
words of the Spanish government are
greatly divergent but she attributed
problems to those of structure. She
said the current acts of violence are
reflections of anger that little is being
done to alleviate unemployment, un
equal distribution of wealth, and lack
of sufficient education for all those
without money for private schooling.

Spain, as a developing Western na
tion, is experiencing both positive and
negative effects of its recent change of
regime from the fascist Franco dec
ades to the present parliamentary
monarchy of King Juan Carlos, ac
cording to academic experts who
spoke yesterday at a panel discussion
as part of the World in Crisis lecture
series.
The major problem, said panelists,
remains how to reconcile the pro-right
attitude of Carlos with the more mili
tant leftist faction of Prime Minister
Adolfo Suarez.
Prof. Gabriel Jackson of UC-San Di
ego stressed Franco's death, which
signalled the end of fascism in Spain,
was "a miracle that no one antici
pated ... but whether it will last is
something else."
Jackson said that under the two
year-old constitution instituted in De
cember 1978, regions of Spain are to be
granted local self-government.
Though not implemented yet on a wide
scale, Jackson said the Spanish cen
tral government is aiding in the areas'
desires for autonomy.
Jackson also cited evidence that the
average member of the Spanish public
is more articulate now in his dis
cussion of liberty and human rights.
With the new governmental leniency
toward freedom of expression, Jack
son also said that Spain has fewer po

litical prisoners today in exile and in
fact, there are currently more politi
cal refugees from other countries in
Spain.
"It isn't all black (in Spain) today,
pardons and absolutions occur," said
Prof. Richard Herrof UC-Berkeley.
But despite these trends, said Herr.
there are no new laws on the books and
existing laws are still utilized to a cer
tain degree.
The four panelists were quick to
elaborate on the current social and po
litical problems existing in Spain to
day. They were in agreement on what
the problems in Spain are, though each
panelist described different causes for
today's strife.
All panelists gave high priority to
the economic situation. Jackson said
there are two million unemployed peo
ple in Spain today, approximately 15
percent of the population. He said
tourism and its revenues are declining
and that Spanish workers abroad are
returning home because of the general
slowdown on the European financial
scene.
Prof. Joan Ullman of the University
of Washington attributed the econom
ic problem to an expansion of econom
ic goals without proper industrializa
tion of the Spanish people to assure ef
ficiency of Spanish society.
Jackson also mentioned the dis
illusionment of the Spanish populace
who had expected spiritual and cul
tural changes that have not yet mate
rialized.
Prof. Luis Ponce de Leon of Califor
nia State University at Hayward
elaborated on this notion by discussing
the fears of the Spanish middle class.
He said they fear the political ter
rorism and violence in the city streets.
The people are disappointed over the
high unemployment rate and the de
cline of tourism, he explained.
"It seems to me that they don't un
derstand the mechanisms of certain
things . . . they blame the new system
even though it is not directly its fault,"
he said.
