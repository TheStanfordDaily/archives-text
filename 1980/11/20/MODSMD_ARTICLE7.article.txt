A new organ will soon be installed in Memorial
Church, and the church wall facing the Quad will
be renovated, according to Robert Hamerton-
Kelly. dean of the chapel. The total cost of the
project, it is estimated, will be $1.6 million.
The new organ was purchased from the
Charles Fisk Co. of Boston for $450,000.
The present organ, which, according to Uni
versity organist Herb Nanny, has a rich, rolling
tone, will remain in Memorial Church. Termed a
Romantic organ because it was built to play mu
sic from the late 19th century, it will be sup
plemented by the new Baroque organ which will
add a thinner and more precise tone and enable
playing of older compositions.
Nanny, professor of music here since 1947, said
he is pleased with the acquisition of the new or
gan.
"It has a silvery tone which will contrast nice
ly to the existing sound," commented Nanny.
"We will be able to play more music from
Mozart's period."
Two separate donations of $400,000 will finance
the renovation project which will begin in April
1981 and continue until the following December.
The organ will be completely installed and ready
to play bv the end of 1983, according to Hamerton-
Kellv.

The Fisk Company is owned and operated by
Charles Fisk, a graduate of Harvard who came to
Stanford in 1950 as a graduate student in physics.
He became interested in the organ in Memorial
Church and after taking a tour up through its
works, he began taking lessons from Nanny.
"Fisk studied with me and played the organ in
service on Sundays," recalled Nanny.
Fisk left Stanford before completing his
degree in physics to establish an organ company
in Boston, Mass., with the help of Nanny.
"He is perhaps one of the leading American or
gan builders. . . and now he's come home to build
an organ where it all started from," commented
Dean Hamerton-Kelly.
The donations for the organ were made by two
parties with long-time interest in Memorial
Church. They both specified the money be used to
improve the musical qualities of the church.
The first donation of $400,000 was from the es
tate of Evelyn Turrentine, who was a faithful
worshipper at Sunday services and performed
many other duties, according to Hamerton-Kel
ly
"She was the official wedding hostess of the
church many years ago," he said.
The second donation of $400,000 was made by
Mr. and Mrs. George Morrell, who designated
the proceeds from the sale of property to be used

for renovation of the church. The Morrells regu
larly attend church services also. Both donations
will cover the cost of the organ and assist in fi
nancing of the remaining $1.2 million renovation
project.
The renovation project consists of strengthen
ing the north wall of the church which faces the
Quad. Horizontal and vertical steel beams will be
placed inside the wall to brace it for the weight of
the new organ, which will be placed in the center
of the existing choir loft.
The project will disrupt traffic in the Quad, but
Dean Hamerton-Kelly said he sees the problem
as "workable."
"We will seal off the whole north area with
plastic drop cloths and use side entrances to wor
ship in the church," he explained.
In addition to strengthening of the north wall,
installation of the new organ will require renova
tion of the acoustics system of the church.
The right acoustics will necessitate reinforce
ment of high and low tones of the old and new or
gans. explained Nanny.
The acoustics will be altered by removal of
burlap cloth from the ceiling of the church —
placed there when the church was built — and ad
dition of various beams and other materials.
"Acoustics is an elusive art," commented
Hamerton-Kelly. "When you install a new organ,
the whole acoustical configuration is changed "
