## Speakers voice resistance to South African military 
### Carol Rose 
Unified opposition to South African military op
pression was the central theme of a discussion
held Monday at the Bechtel International Center.
Entitled Voices of Resistance in Southern Africa,
the dialogue featured Ellen Musialela of the South
West Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO), the
liberation movement of Namibia, and Mike
Morgan, a white South African War resister.
"Namibia was the last country to be colonized
on the African continent and today is the last to be
still colonized by a foreign power." said Musi
alela.
Musialela. who was forced into exile at the age
of 18. has lived and worked for the last 12 years in
exile military bases, refugee camps and SWAPO
offices in Angola and Zambia. She is a mother of
two children and co-founder of the SWAPO Wom
en's Council.
According to Musialela, the Germans occupied
Namibia in 1884 and ruled thtough "terror and
genocide."
"When the German soldiers were defeated by
the British in South Africa, the British continued
to exploit the black people of South Africa. They
promised that they would later grant free
dom."she said.
But because of the wealth of mineral resources
of the country, Namibia was not liberated, and in
dependence is still in question today," Musialela
said.

"The black people of Namibia are not allowed
to have a voice in government. The people cannot
choose where to live and they must live under the
pass system," according to Musialela.
According to Musialela, the blacks in South
Africa are required to pay for their education, but
whites receive free education.
"In South Africa the white children are taught
white supremacy," according to Morgan.
"The South African history books say that the
whites arrived there first and that they met the
blacks in central Africa." he said.
Drafted after completing school, Morgan
served in the South African Defense Force
(SADF) in Northern Namibia, where Musialela's
family lives.
"Revolted" by the injustice of apartheid and
the war, Morgan deserted the SADF and was
forced into exile in 1977 in order to avoid prose
cution. He now works to encourage the white war
resistance movement through the South African
Military Refugee Aid Fund.
U.N. negotiations
In 1978 the United Nations and five major world
powers; the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, and West Germany, agreed to help
Namibia negotiate independence from South
Africa.
According to Musialela, SWAPO (representing
Namibia) requested five conditions for nego

tiations — withdrawal of South African troops, re
nunciation of all South African claims to Namibia,
release of Namibian political prisoners, U.N. su
pervision of the transition and fair elections.
Their conditions were refused, according to
Morgan.
"South Africa will never be backed by the peo
ple of Namibia. This April, 80 per cent of the peo
ple said that they would vote for SWAFO if free
elections were held," Musialela said.
"Rather than risk a SWAFO government, the
Western powers continued to steal our uranium,
diamonds and minerals, and then installed a pup
pet government — the D.T.A. (Democratic Turn
halle Alliance)," Musialela said.
SWAPO resistance
In South Africa. SWAPO is one of the vanguard
movements of resistance to the South African war
machine." said Morgan.
"South Africa, with the strongest military
force in Africa and in the Southern Hemisphere
uses its military to support apartheid and as a
weapon against national liberation movements,"
he said.
"They can support this military only with the
aid of illegal arms shipments from the West and
from a strict draft of all the people of South
Africa," according to Morgan.
"The United States also turns a blind eye to
open recruitment of U.S. mercenaries to fight for
racism in South Africa. A conservative estimate
is that 2000 North Americans were fighting for lan
Smith in Zimbabwe, and many have now moved to
South Africa," he said.
"Most of these mercenaries are recruited by
the Soldiers of Fortune magazine, which is pub
lished by Phoenix Associates and is a CIA front,"
Morgan said.
Accusations of terrorism
"If the whites find themselves losing, they fly
U.S. and British bombers into Angola to try and
keep the Angolan economy down so that the
Angolans do not want SWAPO troops in their coun
try. They (the whites) call us terrorists," Musi
alela said.
"I was with the troops who followed up the air
attacks in Namibia, and the role of terrorist in
South Africa is not played by SWAPO. but by the
apartheid state." he said.
Commenting on the new Reagan adminis
tration, Musialela said,"They have already rec
ognized the Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) who fight against Namibia and
they said that they are going to lift the arms em
bargo."
"I am very afraid that the third world war will
erupt in Southern Africa if the United States sends
in troops," she said.
The program was co-sponsored by the Ameri
can Friends Service Committee, the Stanford
African Student Union, the Black Student Union
and the Bechtel International Center.

program, entitled "Voices of Resistance in South Africa," also fea

Unified opposition to South African military op
pression was the central theme of a discussion
held Monday at the Bechtel International Center.
Entitled Voices of Resistance in Southern Africa,
the dialogue featured Ellen Musialela of the South
West Africa Peoples Organization (SWAPO), the
liberation movement of Namibia, and Mike
Morgan, a white South African War resister.
"Namibia was the last country to be colonized
on the African continent and today is the last to be
still colonized by a foreign power." said Musi
alela.
Musialela. who was forced into exile at the age
of 18. has lived and worked for the last 12 years in
exile military bases, refugee camps and SWAPO
offices in Angola and Zambia. She is a mother of
two children and co-founder of the SWAPO Wom
en's Council.
According to Musialela, the Germans occupied
Namibia in 1884 and ruled thtough "terror and
genocide."
"When the German soldiers were defeated by
the British in South Africa, the British continued
to exploit the black people of South Africa. They
promised that they would later grant free
dom."she said.
But because of the wealth of mineral resources
of the country, Namibia was not liberated, and in
dependence is still in question today," Musialela
said.
Voices not heard
"The black people of Namibia are not allowed
to have a voice in government. The people cannot
choose where to live and they must live under the
pass system," according to Musialela.
According to Musialela, the blacks in South
Africa are required to pay for their education, but
whites receive free education.
"In South Africa the white children are taught
white supremacy," according to Morgan.
"The South African history books say that the
whites arrived there first and that they met the
blacks in central Africa." he said.
Drafted after completing school, Morgan
served in the South African Defense Force
(SADF) in Northern Namibia, where Musialela's
family lives.
"Revolted" by the injustice of apartheid and
the war, Morgan deserted the SADF and was
forced into exile in 1977 in order to avoid prose
cution. He now works to encourage the white war
resistance movement through the South African
Military Refugee Aid Fund.
U.N. negotiations
In 1978 the United Nations and five major world
powers; the United States, Britain, Canada,
France, and West Germany, agreed to help
Namibia negotiate independence from South
Africa.
According to Musialela, SWAPO (representing
Namibia) requested five conditions for nego

tiations — withdrawal of South African troops, re
nunciation of all South African claims to Namibia,
release of Namibian political prisoners, U.N. su
pervision of the transition and fair elections.
Their conditions were refused, according to
Morgan.
"South Africa will never be backed by the peo
ple of Namibia. This April, 80 per cent of the peo
ple said that they would vote for SWAFO if free
elections were held," Musialela said.
"Rather than risk a SWAFO government, the
Western powers continued to steal our uranium,
diamonds and minerals, and then installed a pup
pet government — the D.T.A. (Democratic Turn
halle Alliance)," Musialela said.
SWAPO resistance
In South Africa. SWAPO is one of the vanguard
movements of resistance to the South African war
machine." said Morgan.
"South Africa, with the strongest military
force in Africa and in the Southern Hemisphere
uses its military to support apartheid and as a
weapon against national liberation movements,"
he said.
"They can support this military only with the
aid of illegal arms shipments from the West and
from a strict draft of all the people of South
Africa," according to Morgan.
"The United States also turns a blind eye to
open recruitment of U.S. mercenaries to fight for
racism in South Africa. A conservative estimate
is that 2000 North Americans were fighting for lan
Smith in Zimbabwe, and many have now moved to
South Africa," he said.
"Most of these mercenaries are recruited by
the Soldiers of Fortune magazine, which is pub
lished by Phoenix Associates and is a CIA front,"
Morgan said.
Accusations of terrorism
"If the whites find themselves losing, they fly
U.S. and British bombers into Angola to try and
keep the Angolan economy down so that the
Angolans do not want SWAPO troops in their coun
try. They (the whites) call us terrorists," Musi
alela said.
"I was with the troops who followed up the air
attacks in Namibia, and the role of terrorist in
South Africa is not played by SWAPO. but by the
apartheid state." he said.
Commenting on the new Reagan adminis
tration, Musialela said,"They have already rec
ognized the Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) who fight against Namibia and
they said that they are going to lift the arms em
bargo."
"I am very afraid that the third world war will
erupt in Southern Africa if the United States sends
in troops," she said.
