# Economic, political instability threaten Portilla
## Gas costs pose problem in Mexico 
### Los Angeles Times 
Mexico City — The govern
ment of President Jose Lopez
Portillo is nearing a decision on
the crucial question of raising
domestic gasoline prices, cur
rently among the world's low
est. But higher prices would risk
the government's popular sup
port as well as its control of the
economy.
Legislative leaders an
nounced last Friday that no in
crease would be imposed this
year for fear of exacerbating
what is expected to be a record
level of inflation for 1980. But
they were immediately con
tradicted by officials of Lopez
Portillo's administration. One
high-ranking source said that a
consensus had been reached to
raise prices "to a level that is
competitive with the price of
gasoline in the United States."
The decision will affect, not
only millions of Mexicans but
also thousands of Americans
who cross the border to buy
gasoline.
In Mexico, gasoline costs
about 46 cents a gallon, com
pared with an average U.S.
price of $1.19.
More importantly, the de
cision will have profound eco
nomic and political implica
tions, because higher gasoline
prices would stimulate infla
tion.
Unrest
The issue poses a political
dilemma for Lopez Portillo be
cause, at worst, a steep increase
in gasoline prices could touch

off labor unrest and business
dissatisfaction that would de
stroy the remarkable political
consensus he has enjoyed since
he replaced President Luis
Echeverria in the chaotic clos
ing months of 1976.
To do nothing, however,
would be to risk wasting much
of the nation's most precious re
source. oil. at a time when Mexi
co is urging other countries to
step up conservation measures
at all costs.
With their economy growing
at the rate of 8 percent a year,
largely on the strength of oil ex
ports, Mexicans have been
spared the economic hardships
of other Third World countries.
Reasons for price hike
Mexican officials who favor a
price increase cited a number of
factors to support their case, in
cluding what they said was an
alarming increase in gasoline
consumption along the border,
attributed primarily to U.S.
buyers.
"The rate of gasoline con
sumption along some parts of
our border has been growing at
a rate of more than 50 percent a
year." a Cabinet official said.
"That's intolerable."
In 1979. the level of gasoline
consumption in Mexico rose by
nearly 16 percent, a rate that
most officials here consider ex
cessive.
Mexican and U.S. officials
alike say that the issue of higher
gasoline prices has been under
scrutiny here for years, but fear
of the economic and political

consequences has forestalled a
decision.
In an unpublicized meeting
with U.S. government officials
last month in Baja California, a
Pernex official pointed out that
219 million liters of unleaded
Mexican gasoline (55 million
gallons) had been sold since
Jan. 1 in that area alone — 30
percent of the total Pemex out
put. Pemex is the Mexican gov
ernment-owned oil company.
The report noted that Mexi
can officials have asked the U.S.
government to impose restric
tions on the importation of large
quantities of Mexican fuel, a re
quest that has gone unheeded.
Although higher gasoline
prices will undoubtedly make
mass transit systems more at
tractive to the average Mexi
can. they also will stimulate
Mexico's most pressing eco
nomic problem, inflation.
Gustavo Romero Kolbeck,
the director general of the Bank
of Mexico, predicted in a recent
speech that inflation would
reach 27 percent this year, well
above the government goal of no
more than 20 percent.
Problems of inflation
Despite efforts to keep the
cost of living under control,
Mexican officials said there was
no immediate prospect of suc
cess. A rise in gasoline prices
may induce what Lopez Portillo
referred to in his State of the
Union speech as "the whirlwind
of inflation."
A key element of Lopez
Portillo's political success thus

far has been the support of the
labor movement.
But the unprecedented level
of inflation this year and the
fear of a new round of price in
creases stimulated by a rise in
the cost of gasoline has created
a mood of defiance. The Con
federation of Mexican Workers,
the dominant labor organiza
tion. has already asked for an in
crease of 35 percent in the min
imum wage.
"Any way you look at it," an
American economist said,
"they are between a rock and a
hard place. Even if the low price
benefits the poor, it's causing
them to do the wrong thing —
buying too many cars, for exam
ple.

with U.S. government officials
last month in Baja California, a
Pernex official pointed out that
219 million liters of unleaded
Mexican gasoline (55 million
gallons) had been sold since
Jan. 1 in that area alone — 30
percent of the total Pemex out
put. Pemex is the Mexican gov
ernment-owned oil company.
The report noted that Mexi
can officials have asked the U.S.
government to impose restric
tions on the importation of large
quantities of Mexican fuel, a re
quest that has gone unheeded.
Although higher gasoline
prices will undoubtedly make
mass transit systems more at
tractive to the average Mexi
can. they also will stimulate
Mexico's most pressing eco
nomic problem, inflation.
Gustavo Romero Kolbeck,
the director general of the Bank
of Mexico, predicted in a recent
speech that inflation would
reach 27 percent this year, well
above the government goal of no
more than 20 percent.
Problems of inflation
Despite efforts to keep the
cost of living under control,
Mexican officials said there was
no immediate prospect of suc
cess. A rise in gasoline prices
may induce what Lopez Portillo
referred to in his State of the
Union speech as "the whirlwind
of inflation."
A key element of Lopez
Portillo's political success thus

far has been the support of the
labor movement.
But the unprecedented level
of inflation this year and the
fear of a new round of price in
creases stimulated by a rise in
the cost of gasoline has created
a mood of defiance. The Con
federation of Mexican Workers,
the dominant labor organiza
tion. has already asked for an in
crease of 35 percent in the min
imum wage.
"Any way you look at it," an
American economist said,
"they are between a rock and a
hard place. Even if the low price
benefits the poor, it's causing
them to do the wrong thing —
buying too many cars, for exam
ple.
Mexico City — The govern
ment of President Jose Lopez
Portillo is nearing a decision on
the crucial question of raising
domestic gasoline prices, cur
rently among the world's low
est. But higher prices would risk
the government's popular sup
port as well as its control of the
economy.
Legislative leaders an
nounced last Friday that no in
crease would be imposed this
year for fear of exacerbating
what is expected to be a record
level of inflation for 1980. But
they were immediately con
tradicted by officials of Lopez
Portillo's administration. One
high-ranking source said that a
consensus had been reached to
raise prices "to a level that is
competitive with the price of
gasoline in the United States."
The decision will affect, not
only millions of Mexicans but
also thousands of Americans
who cross the border to buy
gasoline.
In Mexico, gasoline costs
about 46 cents a gallon, com
pared with an average U.S.
price of $1.19.
More importantly, the de
cision will have profound eco
nomic and political implica
tions, because higher gasoline
prices would stimulate infla
tion.
Unrest
The issue poses a political
dilemma for Lopez Portillo be
cause, at worst, a steep increase
in gasoline prices could touch

off labor unrest and business
dissatisfaction that would de
stroy the remarkable political
consensus he has enjoyed since
he replaced President Luis
Echeverria in the chaotic clos
ing months of 1976.
To do nothing, however,
would be to risk wasting much
of the nation's most precious re
source. oil. at a time when Mexi
co is urging other countries to
step up conservation measures
at all costs.
With their economy growing
at the rate of 8 percent a year,
largely on the strength of oil ex
ports, Mexicans have been
spared the economic hardships
of other Third World countries.
Reasons for price hike
Mexican officials who favor a
price increase cited a number of
factors to support their case, in
cluding what they said was an
alarming increase in gasoline
consumption along the border,
attributed primarily to U.S.
buyers.
"The rate of gasoline con
sumption along some parts of
our border has been growing at
a rate of more than 50 percent a
year." a Cabinet official said.
"That's intolerable."
In 1979. the level of gasoline
consumption in Mexico rose by
nearly 16 percent, a rate that
most officials here consider ex
cessive.
Mexican and U.S. officials
alike say that the issue of higher
gasoline prices has been under
scrutiny here for years, but fear
of the economic and political

consequences has forestalled a
decision.
