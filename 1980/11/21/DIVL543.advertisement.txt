Did you know
we can find
a breast cancer
as small as tbe
head of apin?
â– Hr
Suoh a tiny cancer can
almost always be cured.
Mammography, a technique
of low-dose breast x-ray, can
detect a cancer long before a
lump can be felt. While it is
still higHy curable.
If you are over 50 or
have special reasons to be
concerned with breast
cancer, ask your doctor
about mammography.
