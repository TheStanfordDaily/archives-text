# Soviets reassess policies toward U.S. and Europe
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — Soviet-American
relations have entered a long pe
riod of chilled dormancy as the
Kremlin, like Washington, un
dertakes a deep reassessment
of its bilateral positions and
cautiously awaits a tnove from
the other superpower.
With the U.S. government
now headed by a lame duck and
president-elect Ronald Reagan
only beginning to sift through
policy options, the Soviets are
now reviewing their own
domestic and foreign policies in
preparation for the 26th Com
munist Party congress next
February, when new national
economic and political goals
will be adopted.
The process suggests Soviet
interest in new approaches to
such troublesome bilateral
problems as strategic arms lim
itation. East-West trade. Mid
east peace and Third World ad
venturing.
No quick moves
But there are compelling rea
sons to believe that beyond quiet
exploration of differences with
the Reagan administration, the
Kremlin will not volunteer any
initiatives of its own in the fore
seeable future.
In part, this is the lesson of
the past decade. Detente truly
began only after the Kremlin
and the Nixon administration
had dealt with each other for a
number of years.
Now, if Reagan feels that
bilateral detente has run its

course, the Soviets might not
mind The Soviet Union has
greatly expanded its trade with
the West. and. through the 1975
Helsinki agreement, legit
imized its rule over Eastern Eu
rope
Defense disputes
These factors all bolster Sovi
et President Leonid Brezhnev's
original policy. The present dis
pute between Washington and
its North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization allies over defense
spending strengthens Moscow's
conviction that Europe, for
whatever reasons, has at last
identified basic interests that
are in conflict with Washing
ton's in relation to the Soviet
Union.
The importance of the Eu
ropean connection cannot be un
derestimated in assessing Mos
cow's position on Afghanistan,
the principal cause of grim
bilateral relations. Largely be
cause of trade ties developed
through detente, the Kremlin
has had considerable success in
blunting the impact of the grain
embargo and the high technolo
gy trade sanctions imposed by
President Jimmy Carter in re
taliation for the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
If Reagan relaxes or removes
the sanctions, the Kremlin will
trumpet it as acceptance of the
status quo in Afghanistan — an
effortless victory that will only
reaffirm Soviet leaders'
judgment that they could in
tervene without lasting adverse

consequences.
The Soviets are now treating
Reagan in a friendly manner,
part of general leadership poli
cy to await any new leader's ac
tual accession to power.
Not a word can be heard of
ficially here about Reagan's
post-election press conference
in which he promised to con
front Moscow with its "policies
of aggression." Brezhnev's
statement underscores Soviet
hopes that Reagan will turn out
to be a centrist like Richard
Nixon, capable of finding ac
commodation behind a facade of
tough, anti-communist politic
king.
With plenty of economic trou
bles of their own in addition to
the complex political-economic
troubles of Poland, the Kremlin
is not eager to anger the presi
dent-elect in a way that could be
seen as challenging him to un
dertake the all-out arms race he
said he favored during the cam
paign.
At the same time, Moscow
cannot publicly acknowledge
that the SALT 11 treaty signed
by Carter and Brezhnev is dead,
as Reagan and his advisers say
it is. The most positive stance
they can take is to make
statements such as Brezhnev
did Monday night and firmly put
the new administration in the
position of requesting that
changes be made, a weaker
bargaining point from which to
start.

The importance of the Eu

the principal cause of grim
bilateral relations. Largely be

has had considerable success in
blunting the impact of the grain
embargo and the high technolo
gy trade sanctions imposed by
President Jimmy Carter in re
taliation for the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
If Reagan relaxes or removes
the sanctions, the Kremlin will
trumpet it as acceptance of the
status quo in Afghanistan — an

Nixon, capable of finding ac

With plenty of economic trou

said he favored during the cam
paign.
At the same time, Moscow
cannot publicly acknowledge
that the SALT 11 treaty signed
by Carter and Brezhnev is dead,
as Reagan and his advisers say
it is. The most positive stance
they can take is to make
statements such as Brezhnev
did Monday night and firmly put
the new administration in the
position of requesting that
changes be made, a weaker
bargaining point from which to
start.
Moscow — Soviet-American
relations have entered a long pe
riod of chilled dormancy as the
Kremlin, like Washington, un
dertakes a deep reassessment
of its bilateral positions and
cautiously awaits a tnove from
the other superpower.
With the U.S. government
now headed by a lame duck and
president-elect Ronald Reagan
only beginning to sift through
policy options, the Soviets are
now reviewing their own
domestic and foreign policies in
preparation for the 26th Com
munist Party congress next
February, when new national
economic and political goals
will be adopted.
The process suggests Soviet
interest in new approaches to
such troublesome bilateral
problems as strategic arms lim
itation. East-West trade. Mid
east peace and Third World ad
venturing.
No quick moves
But there are compelling rea
sons to believe that beyond quiet
exploration of differences with
the Reagan administration, the
Kremlin will not volunteer any
initiatives of its own in the fore
seeable future.
In part, this is the lesson of
the past decade. Detente truly
began only after the Kremlin
and the Nixon administration
had dealt with each other for a
number of years.
Now, if Reagan feels that
bilateral detente has run its

course, the Soviets might not
mind The Soviet Union has
greatly expanded its trade with
the West. and. through the 1975
