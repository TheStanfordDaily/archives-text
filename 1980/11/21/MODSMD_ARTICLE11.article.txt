# Britain hit by increasing criminal violence
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
London — For generations. Britain
has been regarded as one of the world's
safer countries, a model of civility, with
quiet streets and a largely unarmed po
lice force.
But in recent months police officials
and sociologists have been alarmed by a
rising tide of violence. Crimes against in
dividuals have soared, and parts of the
British Isles on some days resemble bat
tlefields.
"Crime is becoming a real threat to
our way of life," commented Chief Con
stable Ken Oxford of Merseyside, which
includes the city of Liverpool. "If we
cannot prevent this dreadful increase, or
contain it.the freedoms we have been ac
customed to for so long will vanish."
Police officials point to statistics to
tell the grim story. In the first six months
of this year in Merseyside. violent crime
rose by 28.5 percent. There has been a 32
percent rise in the number of people in
jured in violent crimes.
Homicides double
In the last 10 years, the homicide rate
in England and Wales has doubled, and
the number of wounded in assaults has
risen from 35,362 to 92.802.
Further, the police say, many inci
dents of violence are not reported.
After dark, women are afraid to walk
the streets of some of the poorer sections
of London because of the sharp increase
in the incidence in muggings.

Public attention was focused on this
when Lord Home and Lord Chalfont were
attacked, in separate incidents, not far
from Parliament.
Buses attacked
About 700 workers on London buses
were attacked last year and injured se
verely enough to require time off. The
drivers are now equipped with two-way
radios.
"It is not confined to the late service,
when drunks stagger home from the
pubs.'" one official said. "On many day
routes we have to be prepared for attacks
by boys and girls coming back from
school. We have instances of children
pulling knives and of gang fights."
Gang fights are not new in Britain.
Once it was the Mods and Rockers; more
recently it has been the Punks and Skin
heads. But the intensity of their clashes
has increased, and hospital attendants
say that only modern surgical technique
has kept the death rate down.
The rise in violence has many causes,
the experts say, with one of the more im
portant being the rise in unemployment.
Unemployment is leading to alienation
and disillusionment among teenagers,
according to the annual report of the Na
tional Association for the Care and Re
settlement of Offenders.
The association's chairman, Tony
Christopher, said, "It could lead to prob
lems that would far outweight the efforts
of all the agencies dedicated both to the

containment and prevention of criminal
behavior."
In London, for instance, 50 percent of
last year's arrests involved youths under
20 years age.
Another reason for the crime increase
is a lessening of parental control. Alco
hol also plays a part, particularly among
the young. Liquor-related offenses
among 18-and 19-year-olds have risen
sharply, and under-age drinking is soar
ing.
Prof. Derek McClintock, head of thhe
criminology deparment at Edinburgh
University, Scotland, said, "There is
great concern about the apparent as
sociation between the very big increase
in alcohol consumption by the young and
violence in Western Europe, North
America and even Eastern European
countries."
While violence can occur anywhere, it
is often most visible at important soccer
games. Sometimes soccer fans seem to
turn out not so much for the contest as for
the chance to tangle with the opposition
fans.
In the last two years, eight deaths have
been attributed to violence directly con
nected with soccer games. There have
been nearly 90 major disorders at the sta
diums. and hundreds of people have been
injured.
To some extent, the violence ori
ginates among the player, whose un
sportsmanlike conduct has provided a

bad example for the fans.
"Anybody with any degree of common
sense would realize." one official said,
"that voung spectators emulate the be
havior of those footballers holding a spe
cial place in their lives."'
Neo-fascism
In another development, neo-fascist
groups have been making Nazi gestures
against teams with black players. The
Neo-fascist National Front has been
handing out hate literature at games in
London, and some groups of
taken to shouting "Sieg heil!" — the cry
of Nazi Germany.
Home Secretary William Whitelaw
has proposed that the courts be given
broader powers to administer "short,
sharp shocks" to young offenders.
Under his proposal, magistrates
would have more latitude to detain
youthful offenders and they could fine
parents for offenses committed bv those
17 or younger.
In order to make room in the prisons
for those who commit crimes of vio
lence. the courts would be authorized to
give wider probationary sentences to
people convicted of non-violent crimes.
Other officials insist that parental dis
cipline must be restored.
Whatever the reason for the violence,
it is undoubtedly increasing, and it wor
ries officers of the law. most of whom be
lieve that more constables are needed to
deal with the problem.
