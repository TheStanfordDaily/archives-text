# Axe madness began with crazy Billy Erb, became a tradition
## 
### Glenn Garvin 
Billy Erb holds a secure place in Stanford
history.
Just what this place is. though, is open for
debate Erb may have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to attend this Uni
versity — or he may have been the biggest im
becile ever to set foot on campus.
Either way. he's certainly among the
weirdest.
Erb is the man responsible for all this "axe
madness." You see. in 1899, he feared Stan
lord was about to blow a three-game baseball
series to Cal. Being a man of great spirit (and
a hallback on Stanford's football team), Erb
decided to single-handedly prevent this dis
grace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe with a 15-inch
blade to a pre-game rally and amused the
crowd by hacking up a dummy bear. Then
Erb. who was the kind of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre if
he were around today, took the axe to the
game and spent a few hours chopping up blue
and gold ribbons.
To break up the monotony, he occasionally
tnreatened Berkeley band members with de
capitation.
Game and axe lost
But it was a miserable day for Stanford
sports fans. Not only did the Cards lose the
game, 9-7. but the axe was lost. A group of
thugs jumped Erb and the other guardians and
raced off with the axe.
Boarding a butcher wagon, the Cal students
headed for North Beach. There they sawed off
the axe's handle in a butcher shop before head
ing for the ferry that would take them home to
Berkeley. Stanford students valiantly formed
a battleline around the San Francisco Ferry
Building to search Cal students as they
boarded the ferry for Oakland. But in the con
fusion. a student, with the axe tucked inside
his overcoat, slipped through the Stanford
crowd hand-in-hand with a woman ac
complice.
If you think Erb was unique, then brace
yourself. He had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. and in any discussion of Stanford history,
Dutton's name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal axe-nappers returned to their
campus, they held a spontaneous rally. Enter

Harry Dutton. just as dedicated to God, flag
and Stanford as Erb Dutton, on horseback,
rode into the middle of the crowd and sug
gested to the Cal men that they hand him the
axe so that everyone could see it.
They agreed But unfortunately for but
ton's rescue attempt, the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were afraid it would
shy and run away.
Dutton was not so ready to give up. After
the rally, the axe was taken to the Chi Fhi
fraternity house, and Dutton turned up there
in a false mustache with a note instructing the
frat men to turn the axe over to him so he
could paint it. The painfully naive Cal students
handed him the axe.
Then his mustache fell off Dutton barely
got away with his life, much less the axe,
which remained at the house.
House raided
Now Erb plunged back into the fray. He was
no dummy and didn't consider it his destiny to
go down in history as the man who lost Stan
ford's axe.
So late one night, Chi Phi men awoke to the
gentle sounds of a battering ram smashing
down their door. Erb was leading a raiding
party in a desperate last-ditch attempt to re
gain the axe.
Charlie Pringle. Cal's football captain, saw
the group enter. He snatched an ancient army
sword from the wall and snarled. "I'll kill the
first man who starts up these stairs." Ob
viously. he didn't know Erb. A flower vase
whizzed by his ear and he retreated in disar
ray.
The Stanford men ransacked the house, but
they couldn't find the axe. Sadder, (but proba
bly no wiser), they returned to the Farm emp
ty-handed. Not until 1930 would honor and jus
tice be restored to Stanford.
Enter the Immortal 21
Erb and Dutton were out of the picture by
this time, of course. Now the Immortal 21 took
over the quest. For three years they schemed
and plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930, they
were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Grange posed as
newspaper photographers promising fame
and fortune to the dimwitted Cal freshmen
who were carrying the axe from a pep rally.
But when the flashbulbs went off, they turned

out to be tear-gas bombs - the first time dur
ing the long Stanford-Cal rivalry that anyone
ever resorted to c hemical warfare
Howard Avery snatched the axe, tossed it
into the waiting car and then headed back for
Palo Alto at a torrid 65 miles per hour Other
members of the Immortal 21 posed as Cal stu
dents and formed search parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape rout*}
It worked When the Immortal 21 got back
to campus, the celebration began
— classes were cancelled for two days;
— the campus partied all night.
— the University presented them with block
"S" letters, the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and special gold-axe
watch charms.
But the taste of victory quickly turned bit
ter Amid talk of possible violence by Cal stu
dents. the Stanford administration signed a
pact with Cal. making the axe into a trophy

that would go to the winner of each autumn s
Big Game
Since 1930. the axe has been stolen eight
times. But only one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in the grand tradi
tion of Erb. Dutton and the Immortal 21
They called themselves the Infamous
Three Residents of Theta Delta Chi. they de
cided that Cal didn t deserve possession of the
axe for its last-second 24-21 victory in 1972 in a
game since known as the Mud Bowl. Justice
demanded that the axe be returned to Stan
ford. they concluded. So they devised a plot to
bring it back
Looking back at the plot, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid. that's why they're there.
Briefly, this was the plan someone would
call the ('al student union, claiming to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the axe could be
photographed with two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's in Palo

Alto.
We didn t really know what he sounded
like, but we figured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu. a member of the In
famous Three It worked perfectly the stu
dent union manager agreed to hand over the
axe But when Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it turned out
that Cal's axe commission had removed the
axe
Suliteanu and Conway gave a tear-jerking
performance to the student union manager,
who agreed to call the axe commission and get
the axe — except the guards insisted it go to
I'alo Alto in their car Thinking fast, Con
way's older brother. Tun. used his last dime to
call for reinforcements at Ming's. But when
the car pulled into Ming's parking lot, there
were no Theta Delts in sight.
Suddenly they appeared from behind
parked cars. It was no contest; the axe was
back.
"Except for some jail time, we had nothing
to lose.' the Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft. "It had only
been:50-odd years since the last theft, and the
axe was only encased in a nuclear-attack
proof case with an alarm system What should
it matter that it was Big Game Week, and the
axe was the center of attention for the entire
community?" they added
After losing the axe under such circum
stances. the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back The Infamous Three, feeling very pow
erful after such a brazen theft, issued a list of
non-negotiable" demands to the Stanford ad
ministration that had to be met before the axe
would be returned. They included $6000 cash,
Thanksgiving dinner with President Kichard
Lvrnan, admission to the Stanford graduate
Sv nool of their choice and the services of Law
Prof. John Kaplan as their defense counsel.
Only after two meetings with University ad
ministrators. did the Three drop their de
mands, and the axe was returned to Cal just
before 1973's Big Game, won by Stanford.
(Jur story comes to a close, with the axe cur
rently in Cal hands — the result of last year's
14-21 loss. The rest will be history.
Billv Erb would have been proud to hear of
all the excitement he's caused.

Looking back at the plot, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid. that's why they're there.

call the ('al student union, claiming to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the axe could be
photographed with two "football players" at a

said David Suliteanu. a member of the In

Stanford yell leaders display the axe before the Big Game three years ago. The Cardinals
kept this prized possession until last year.
Billy Erb holds a secure place in Stanford
history.
Just what this place is. though, is open for
debate Erb may have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to attend this Uni
versity — or he may have been the biggest im
becile ever to set foot on campus.
Either way. he's certainly among the
weirdest.
Erb is the man responsible for all this "axe
madness." You see. in 1899, he feared Stan
lord was about to blow a three-game baseball
series to Cal. Being a man of great spirit (and
a hallback on Stanford's football team), Erb
decided to single-handedly prevent this dis
grace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe with a 15-inch
blade to a pre-game rally and amused the
crowd by hacking up a dummy bear. Then
Erb. who was the kind of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre if
he were around today, took the axe to the
game and spent a few hours chopping up blue
and gold ribbons.
To break up the monotony, he occasionally
tnreatened Berkeley band members with de
capitation.
Game and axe lost
But it was a miserable day for Stanford
sports fans. Not only did the Cards lose the
game, 9-7. but the axe was lost. A group of
thugs jumped Erb and the other guardians and
raced off with the axe.
Boarding a butcher wagon, the Cal students
headed for North Beach. There they sawed off
the axe's handle in a butcher shop before head
ing for the ferry that would take them home to
Berkeley. Stanford students valiantly formed
a battleline around the San Francisco Ferry
Building to search Cal students as they
boarded the ferry for Oakland. But in the con
fusion. a student, with the axe tucked inside
his overcoat, slipped through the Stanford
crowd hand-in-hand with a woman ac
complice.
If you think Erb was unique, then brace
yourself. He had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. and in any discussion of Stanford history,
Dutton's name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal axe-nappers returned to their
campus, they held a spontaneous rally. Enter

Harry Dutton. just as dedicated to God, flag
and Stanford as Erb Dutton, on horseback,
rode into the middle of the crowd and sug
gested to the Cal men that they hand him the
axe so that everyone could see it.
They agreed But unfortunately for but
ton's rescue attempt, the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were afraid it would
shy and run away.
Dutton was not so ready to give up. After
the rally, the axe was taken to the Chi Fhi
fraternity house, and Dutton turned up there
in a false mustache with a note instructing the
frat men to turn the axe over to him so he
could paint it. The painfully naive Cal students
handed him the axe.
Then his mustache fell off Dutton barely
got away with his life, much less the axe,
which remained at the house.
House raided
Now Erb plunged back into the fray. He was
no dummy and didn't consider it his destiny to
go down in history as the man who lost Stan
ford's axe.
So late one night, Chi Phi men awoke to the
gentle sounds of a battering ram smashing
down their door. Erb was leading a raiding
party in a desperate last-ditch attempt to re
gain the axe.
Charlie Pringle. Cal's football captain, saw
the group enter. He snatched an ancient army
sword from the wall and snarled. "I'll kill the
first man who starts up these stairs." Ob
viously. he didn't know Erb. A flower vase
whizzed by his ear and he retreated in disar
ray.
The Stanford men ransacked the house, but
they couldn't find the axe. Sadder, (but proba
bly no wiser), they returned to the Farm emp
ty-handed. Not until 1930 would honor and jus
tice be restored to Stanford.
Enter the Immortal 21
Erb and Dutton were out of the picture by
this time, of course. Now the Immortal 21 took
over the quest. For three years they schemed
and plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930, they
were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Grange posed as
newspaper photographers promising fame
and fortune to the dimwitted Cal freshmen
who were carrying the axe from a pep rally.
But when the flashbulbs went off, they turned

out to be tear-gas bombs - the first time dur
ing the long Stanford-Cal rivalry that anyone
ever resorted to c hemical warfare
Howard Avery snatched the axe, tossed it
into the waiting car and then headed back for
Palo Alto at a torrid 65 miles per hour Other
members of the Immortal 21 posed as Cal stu
dents and formed search parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape rout*}
It worked When the Immortal 21 got back
to campus, the celebration began
— classes were cancelled for two days;
— the campus partied all night.
— the University presented them with block
"S" letters, the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and special gold-axe
watch charms.
But the taste of victory quickly turned bit
ter Amid talk of possible violence by Cal stu
dents. the Stanford administration signed a
pact with Cal. making the axe into a trophy

that would go to the winner of each autumn s
Big Game
Since 1930. the axe has been stolen eight
times. But only one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in the grand tradi
tion of Erb. Dutton and the Immortal 21
They called themselves the Infamous

So late one night, Chi Phi men awoke to the
gentle sounds of a battering ram smashing
down their door. Erb was leading a raiding
party in a desperate last-ditch attempt to re
gain the axe.
Charlie Pringle. Cal's football captain, saw
the group enter. He snatched an ancient army
sword from the wall and snarled. "I'll kill the
first man who starts up these stairs." Ob
viously. he didn't know Erb. A flower vase
whizzed by his ear and he retreated in disar
ray.
The Stanford men ransacked the house, but
they couldn't find the axe. Sadder, (but proba
bly no wiser), they returned to the Farm emp
ty-handed. Not until 1930 would honor and jus
tice be restored to Stanford.
Enter the Immortal 21
Erb and Dutton were out of the picture by
this time, of course. Now the Immortal 21 took
over the quest. For three years they schemed
and plotted. Finally, on April 3, 1930, they
were ready.
Ray Walsh and Warren Grange posed as
newspaper photographers promising fame
and fortune to the dimwitted Cal freshmen
who were carrying the axe from a pep rally.
But when the flashbulbs went off, they turned

out to be tear-gas bombs - the first time dur
ing the long Stanford-Cal rivalry that anyone
ever resorted to c hemical warfare
Howard Avery snatched the axe, tossed it
into the waiting car and then headed back for
Palo Alto at a torrid 65 miles per hour Other
members of the Immortal 21 posed as Cal stu
dents and formed search parties to go in the
opposite direction of the escape rout*}
It worked When the Immortal 21 got back
to campus, the celebration began
— classes were cancelled for two days;
— the campus partied all night.
— the University presented them with block
"S" letters, the highest symbol of Stanford
valor and achievement, and special gold-axe
watch charms.
But the taste of victory quickly turned bit
ter Amid talk of possible violence by Cal stu
dents. the Stanford administration signed a
pact with Cal. making the axe into a trophy

that would go to the winner of each autumn s
Big Game
Since 1930. the axe has been stolen eight
times. But only one group has pulled off a heist
that can be truly said to be in the grand tradi
tion of Erb. Dutton and the Immortal 21
They called themselves the Infamous
Three Residents of Theta Delta Chi. they de
cided that Cal didn t deserve possession of the
axe for its last-second 24-21 victory in 1972 in a
game since known as the Mud Bowl. Justice
demanded that the axe be returned to Stan
ford. they concluded. So they devised a plot to
bring it back
Looking back at the plot, it seems far too
stupid to ever succeed. But remember: Cal
students are stupid. that's why they're there.
Briefly, this was the plan someone would
call the ('al student union, claiming to be Bear
coach Mike White and ask if the axe could be
photographed with two "football players" at a
football writer's banquet at Ming's in Palo

Alto.
We didn t really know what he sounded
like, but we figured no one else did either,"
said David Suliteanu. a member of the In
famous Three It worked perfectly the stu
dent union manager agreed to hand over the
axe But when Suliteanu and Tim Conway
showed up in Cal letter jackets, it turned out
that Cal's axe commission had removed the
axe
Suliteanu and Conway gave a tear-jerking
performance to the student union manager,
who agreed to call the axe commission and get
the axe — except the guards insisted it go to
I'alo Alto in their car Thinking fast, Con
way's older brother. Tun. used his last dime to
call for reinforcements at Ming's. But when
the car pulled into Ming's parking lot, there
were no Theta Delts in sight.
Suddenly they appeared from behind
parked cars. It was no contest; the axe was
back.
"Except for some jail time, we had nothing
to lose.' the Infamous Three said in a
statement issued after the theft. "It had only
been:50-odd years since the last theft, and the
axe was only encased in a nuclear-attack
proof case with an alarm system What should
it matter that it was Big Game Week, and the
axe was the center of attention for the entire
community?" they added
After losing the axe under such circum
stances. the Bears very nearly didn't get it
back The Infamous Three, feeling very pow
erful after such a brazen theft, issued a list of
non-negotiable" demands to the Stanford ad
ministration that had to be met before the axe
would be returned. They included $6000 cash,
Thanksgiving dinner with President Kichard
Lvrnan, admission to the Stanford graduate
Sv nool of their choice and the services of Law
Prof. John Kaplan as their defense counsel.
Only after two meetings with University ad
ministrators. did the Three drop their de
mands, and the axe was returned to Cal just
before 1973's Big Game, won by Stanford.
(Jur story comes to a close, with the axe cur
rently in Cal hands — the result of last year's
14-21 loss. The rest will be history.
Billv Erb would have been proud to hear of
all the excitement he's caused.

Stanford yell leaders display the axe before the Big Game three years ago. The Cardinals
kept this prized possession until last year.
Billy Erb holds a secure place in Stanford
history.
Just what this place is. though, is open for
debate Erb may have been one of the most
crafty, dedicated men ever to attend this Uni
versity — or he may have been the biggest im
becile ever to set foot on campus.
Either way. he's certainly among the
weirdest.
Erb is the man responsible for all this "axe
madness." You see. in 1899, he feared Stan
lord was about to blow a three-game baseball
series to Cal. Being a man of great spirit (and
a hallback on Stanford's football team), Erb
decided to single-handedly prevent this dis
grace.
So he brought a 10-pound axe with a 15-inch
blade to a pre-game rally and amused the
crowd by hacking up a dummy bear. Then
Erb. who was the kind of guy who would have
starred in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre if
he were around today, took the axe to the
game and spent a few hours chopping up blue
and gold ribbons.
To break up the monotony, he occasionally
tnreatened Berkeley band members with de
capitation.
Game and axe lost
But it was a miserable day for Stanford
sports fans. Not only did the Cards lose the
game, 9-7. but the axe was lost. A group of
thugs jumped Erb and the other guardians and
raced off with the axe.
Boarding a butcher wagon, the Cal students
headed for North Beach. There they sawed off
the axe's handle in a butcher shop before head
ing for the ferry that would take them home to
Berkeley. Stanford students valiantly formed
a battleline around the San Francisco Ferry
Building to search Cal students as they
boarded the ferry for Oakland. But in the con
fusion. a student, with the axe tucked inside
his overcoat, slipped through the Stanford
crowd hand-in-hand with a woman ac
complice.
If you think Erb was unique, then brace
yourself. He had a friend named Harry Dut
ton. and in any discussion of Stanford history,
Dutton's name must be mentioned. Loudly.
When the Cal axe-nappers returned to their
campus, they held a spontaneous rally. Enter

Harry Dutton. just as dedicated to God, flag
and Stanford as Erb Dutton, on horseback,
rode into the middle of the crowd and sug
gested to the Cal men that they hand him the
axe so that everyone could see it.
They agreed But unfortunately for but
ton's rescue attempt, the Cal men held onto
the horse because they were afraid it would
shy and run away.
Dutton was not so ready to give up. After
the rally, the axe was taken to the Chi Fhi
fraternity house, and Dutton turned up there
in a false mustache with a note instructing the
frat men to turn the axe over to him so he
could paint it. The painfully naive Cal students
handed him the axe.
Then his mustache fell off Dutton barely
got away with his life, much less the axe,
which remained at the house.
House raided
Now Erb plunged back into the fray. He was
no dummy and didn't consider it his destiny to
go down in history as the man who lost Stan
ford's axe.
So late one night, Chi Phi men awoke to the
gentle sounds of a battering ram smashing
down their door. Erb was leading a raiding
party in a desperate last-ditch attempt to re
gain the axe.

the group enter. He snatched an ancient army
sword from the wall and snarled. "I'll kill the

whizzed by his ear and he retreated in disar
