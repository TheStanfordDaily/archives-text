It's got drama and humor; music, excitement,
dancing, singing and a cast of. . . well, tens. And
all those involved in Rams Head's production of
Gaieties '80 say that they have a show that will
amaze and amuse audiences — "Big Game Beach
Blanket Bingo."
The show is "totally original," according to
producer Doug Schuetz, and has been written, or
chestrated. choreographed, costumed, directed,
and produced by students. Gaieties, described by
Schuetz as "a show put on before Big Game that
rags on Cal." is part of a tradition that dates back
69 years.
The first Gaieties was performed in 1911 and
was an annual event until 1971. The original musi
cal revue was held four or five times during the
week before Big Game and was called the foot
ball Follies, patterned after the Ziegfield Follies.
Later the show progressed toward parodies and
satire.
A handbill for the 1938 Gaieties boasted, "All of
the important dramatic talent of the Stanford
campus will be seen in original satirical sketches,
songs and specialty acts, augmented by a dancing
chorus of 24 specimens of feminine pulchritude.
Cast of 100. "
In 1962. the theme of Gaieties was "Captain
Midnight - The Frozen Orange Vendor." It took a
satirical look at the people in the stands at Big
Game.
The production of Gaieties in 1971 had a spoof on
Dracula that bombed (according to a review in
the Daily.) The theme song was "Transylvania"
sung to the tune of "Oklahoma."
"Sometimes they flopped, but they did them
anyway," said Keith Light, producer of Gaieties
in 1977. the year it was revived after a six-year
absence.
Last year's offering. "Big Games We Play,"
was an attempt at producing a full-length musi
cal. The show satirized Stanford social life, in
stead of Cal or the traditional school rivalry. This
subject matter, along with the length of the prod
uction. led to mixed responses.

This year. Gaieties has tried to find a middle
ground between the full-scale musical and some
of the less structured shows of the past, according
to Schuetz. "Last year's show was ridiculously
long." he said. Gaieties '80 should last about an
hour and a half.
"What we're aiming for," said Schuetz, "is a
show that hits you in the stomach real quick, and
then it's over. We want to start things rolling and
peak out."
Gaieties has been known for its impromptu
manner of organization. Rehearsals for some of
the shows started only two weeks before show
time. The director of the 1954 Gaieties left an ac
countofhis experiences as a warning for future di
rectors:
"The big thing to say for this year's show, or
chestration-wise, is that we did have all the music
in our hands for the final dress rehearsal. We did
not sight read anything on opening night." he
wrote.
Schuetz credits staff organization and com
munication for the success of this year's prod
uction. "The staff has worked amazingly well to
gether. There is no big rush to get things done at
the last minute. Gaieties has a history of opening
nights with the paint still wet, but not this time,"
he said.
Schuetz feels that the new design of the miking
system will allow everybody to hear what is going
on. And he thinks that they will like what they
hear. The music, written by Andy Fehrenbach and
Andrew Shields, is "great," according to Schuetz.
"I think everybody will really enjoy it,"he said.
Gaieties will present two shows today, one at 2
p.m. and the other at 5 p.m. Last night's and to
night's shows were sold out.
"Big Game Beach Blanket Bingo" is directed
by Kevin Reidy, with choreographer Veronique
Lee and costume designer Karen Christensen.
Sam Liu is the technical director, with Vince
Foecke. Paul Lewkowicz and Ed Fisher also on
the production staff. "It's been a really good ex
perience," said Schuetz of Gaieties '80, "and
we've got a really great show."

uction. led to mixed responses.

This year. Gaieties has tried to find a middle
ground between the full-scale musical and some
of the less structured shows of the past, according
to Schuetz. "Last year's show was ridiculously
long." he said. Gaieties '80 should last about an
hour and a half.
"What we're aiming for," said Schuetz, "is a
show that hits you in the stomach real quick, and
then it's over. We want to start things rolling and
peak out."
Gaieties has been known for its impromptu
manner of organization. Rehearsals for some of
the shows started only two weeks before show
time. The director of the 1954 Gaieties left an ac
countofhis experiences as a warning for future di
rectors:
"The big thing to say for this year's show, or
chestration-wise, is that we did have all the music
in our hands for the final dress rehearsal. We did
not sight read anything on opening night." he
wrote.
Schuetz credits staff organization and com
munication for the success of this year's prod
uction. "The staff has worked amazingly well to
gether. There is no big rush to get things done at
the last minute. Gaieties has a history of opening
nights with the paint still wet, but not this time,"
he said.
Schuetz feels that the new design of the miking
system will allow everybody to hear what is going
on. And he thinks that they will like what they
hear. The music, written by Andy Fehrenbach and
Andrew Shields, is "great," according to Schuetz.
"I think everybody will really enjoy it,"he said.
Gaieties will present two shows today, one at 2
p.m. and the other at 5 p.m. Last night's and to
night's shows were sold out.
"Big Game Beach Blanket Bingo" is directed
by Kevin Reidy, with choreographer Veronique
Lee and costume designer Karen Christensen.
Sam Liu is the technical director, with Vince
Foecke. Paul Lewkowicz and Ed Fisher also on
the production staff. "It's been a really good ex
perience," said Schuetz of Gaieties '80, "and
we've got a really great show."
It's got drama and humor; music, excitement,
dancing, singing and a cast of. . . well, tens. And
all those involved in Rams Head's production of
Gaieties '80 say that they have a show that will
amaze and amuse audiences — "Big Game Beach
Blanket Bingo."
The show is "totally original," according to
producer Doug Schuetz, and has been written, or
chestrated. choreographed, costumed, directed,
and produced by students. Gaieties, described by
Schuetz as "a show put on before Big Game that
rags on Cal." is part of a tradition that dates back
69 years.
The first Gaieties was performed in 1911 and
was an annual event until 1971. The original musi
cal revue was held four or five times during the
week before Big Game and was called the foot
ball Follies, patterned after the Ziegfield Follies.
Later the show progressed toward parodies and
satire.
A handbill for the 1938 Gaieties boasted, "All of
the important dramatic talent of the Stanford
campus will be seen in original satirical sketches,
songs and specialty acts, augmented by a dancing
chorus of 24 specimens of feminine pulchritude.
Cast of 100. "
In 1962. the theme of Gaieties was "Captain
Midnight - The Frozen Orange Vendor." It took a
satirical look at the people in the stands at Big
Game.
The production of Gaieties in 1971 had a spoof on
Dracula that bombed (according to a review in
the Daily.) The theme song was "Transylvania"
sung to the tune of "Oklahoma."
"Sometimes they flopped, but they did them
anyway," said Keith Light, producer of Gaieties
in 1977. the year it was revived after a six-year
absence.
Last year's offering. "Big Games We Play,"
was an attempt at producing a full-length musi
cal. The show satirized Stanford social life, in
stead of Cal or the traditional school rivalry. This
subject matter, along with the length of the prod
uction. led to mixed responses.
