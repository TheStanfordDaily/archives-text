# Hate Stanford!
## 
### 
The most celebrated day in
campus history may be the one
on which the Immortal 21 stole
back the axe from UC-
Herkeley.
The axe had been stolen from
Cardii al yell leader Billy Erb
on April 15, 1899 and for 31
years remained on the Berkeley
campus But on April 3, 1930 a
clever ri sp by 21 Stanford men
that usrd exploding teargas
flashbulbs and fast get-away
cars helped bring the axe back.
William Hudson, editor of
the Daily Californian, wrote the
following editorial in frustra
tion the day after the big heist.
"Stanford is likely to wake up
on a different campus this
morning. Th clever boys who
stole the axe may have returned
to paint the town red. but they
may find the place painted blue
and gold before t le night is over.
"Hate Stanford! Catch the eu
phony of that sentence, notice
its essential accuracy! Hate
Stanford! Repe it it over and

over in your mind; formulate it
with your lips' HATE STAN
FORD!
"We have always had a notion
as to the sort of people that in
habit the God-forsaken campus
40 miles south, and our notion is
now confirmed. The rally com
mittee, though it may have
erred in alowing the armored
car to be too far in advance of
the scanty freshman guard, can
not be blamed for being routed
by the most carefuly planned
racketeer robbery in local his
tory. Stanford, despairing of an
honest burglary, imported Chi
cago methods. Tear bombs may
be fair play at Stanford â€” but
then, that is Stanford! HATE
STANFORD!
"We are nurturing one spe
cial animosity, and that is for
Stanford. And we won't be very
sorry if the Stanford bovs find
their Quad a deserted ruin this
morning, and the campus re
turned to the desert from which
it came.
