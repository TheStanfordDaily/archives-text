## Communication needed? 
### 
Last week, 1400 students at Williams
College in Massachusetts met to discuss
recent campus uprisings directed against
blacks there. Cited among the dis
turbances were cross burnings as well as
threatening letters, including one sent to
the student body president, who is black.
Last spring similar uprisings occured at
Amherst College.
While nothing of this magnitude has oc
cured here, it may be beneficial to ques
tion whether people at Stanford feel that
the channels of communication among dif
ferent groups here are open.
Because the cry for civil rights that in
tensified in the '60s has been less vocal in
recent years, it might be necessary for the
entire Stanford community to discuss the
need to develop inter-group relations. In
an atmosphere where each person is striv
ing to "make it" on a very individual
basis, it is easy to disregard many aspects
of "community".
We assume that the need for theme
houses and cultural centers is not an issue
here. Such organizations are necessary
supports for any group that wants to de
velop and maintain cultural integrity.
These centers provide many important in
formational and learning experiences and

instill a sense of pride, strength and his
tory which otherwise might not be found
at the University.
What we are questioning is the at
mosphere of the University as a whole. As
an almost entirely Anglo organization, the
Daily's perspective is admittedly limited.
But from our perspective it seems that the
avenues of communication do not exist
here as perhaps they should.
No well-established intermediary or
ganizations yet exist through which dif
ferent groups can exchange perspectives
or can vent frustrations. This seemed to
be part of the source of the tension that
broke out at Williams last week.
Problems will of course need to be dis
cussed within the groups themselves. But
perhaps steps also need to be taken to de
velop a structure in the University admin
istration that would facilitate exchange
and dialogue as well.
Before any organizations or committees
are formed, it would be necessary to de
termine whether there is a desire among
the various groups here to participate.
Any action could only be productive if the
groups involved were receptive to the
needs and requirements of the other
causes represented.
