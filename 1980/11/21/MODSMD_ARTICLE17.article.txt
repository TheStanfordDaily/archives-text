## Leave affirmative action intact 
### 
Long before the ballot boxes
had closed a couple of weeks
ago. conservative forces began
placing their agenda and
priorities before Ronald Re
agan. It is amazing, but believ
able. that with all the problems
facing the United States and the
world, one of the first recom
mendations made by these
forces was the dismantlement
of affirmative action programs.
According to the Associated
Press, the recommendations
.are that (1) no employment data
be collected according
to race, sex or ethnic origin, and
(2) employment suits be ended.
The consequences of these two
steps, quite likely to be adopted
by Reagan, are ominous. No
factual information about race
and sex in employment
statistics, from which en
lightened and effective
divisions could be made and pro
grams designed, would be avail
able. Of equal concern is that
the civil rights of victims of ra
cism and sexism would be
almost indefensible.
There are probably a large
number of people who will agree
that racism and sexism do ex
ist; there is also probably a
large number who believe ra
cism and sexism are justified.
There are individuals who be
lieve racism and sexism are not

justified. and that something
must be done to counter them;
that something, that concept, is
affirmative action.
One must be forthright in
stating that most of the pro
grams that have been designed
in the name of that concept have
been deliberately fallacious and
weak at their core, inept in their
implementation, or both. Nev
ertheless, the concept of af
firmative action is and has
always been sound: the pro
grams have not been. If anyone
believes that an effective af
firmative action program can
not be designed and im
plemented. I ask them to look at
the number of white males in
the University's adminis
tration.
As one who has closely fol
lowed the affirmative action
program at Stanford. I can truly
state that the University has
never had an effective program,
and the program it has had has
been nonexistent as it pertains
to black staff, exempt and non
exempt. at all levels, on the
main campus and the medical
center. The program has been a
disgrace to this segment of the
minority community.
I invite the reader who might
be interested to (ai promenade
about the inner quad, the hub of
the university, and count the

number ot black employees. I
further invite the reader, upon
receipt of the 1980-81 Facul
ty Staff Directory, to count the
number of black employees in
the front section lists of
academic officers and
academic executive officers.
Lastly. I invite the reader to
study the University's af
firmative action report for
1979-80. whenever it is dis
seminated. and then ask the
popular Reaganian question:
Were black employees better
off at Stanford in '79-80 than
they were four years ago? Of
course, this is a rhetorical ques
tion. The answer will be. ob
viously not.
As stated above, the af
firmative action program at
Stanford has worked to some
degree for some minorities and
women, but black employees
are not among them. I caution
those temporarily benefitting
from the program not to be
smug. There are many people
throughout the University who
believe that they. too. and not
just Reagan, received a
mandate to *ake aim at minor
ities. all of them, and women.
I am left with the conclusion
that the Affirmative Action Of
fice at Stanford might even be
advantageous to blacks by its
absence. I would share the like

lv view of Keagan that the
affirmative action program at
Stanford has been fraudulent. It
would be generous to say that
the program here has ac
complished nothing; it would be
factual to state that it probably
has been counterproductive; it
would be laughable to state that
it has resulted in reverse dis
crimination as some may
charge.
Stanford has a new leader,
and many will wait to see if the
complexion of the University's
officers will change, for af
firmative action, if it is to suc
ceed. must be from and at the
top. In years past, the Univer
sity has boasted that it has done,
and would do many things rela
tive to minorities in spite of, and
not because of. federal pro
grams and mandates.
Many will wait to see if Stan
ford will join the ranks of faint
hearted institutions that will
dismantle their affirmative ac
tion programs on or before Jan
uary 21. It should be done here
if that office is continued as it
has in the past. Affirmative ac
tion is a concept that deserves to
live, and a concept from which
effective programs can be de
signed and implemented, if the
administration so desires.

be interested to (ai promenade
about the inner quad, the hub of
the university, and count the

number ot black employees. I
further invite the reader, upon
receipt of the 1980-81 Facul
ty Staff Directory, to count the
number of black employees in
the front section lists of
academic officers and
academic executive officers.
Lastly. I invite the reader to
study the University's af
firmative action report for
1979-80. whenever it is dis
seminated. and then ask the
popular Reaganian question:
Were black employees better
off at Stanford in '79-80 than
they were four years ago? Of
course, this is a rhetorical ques
tion. The answer will be. ob
viously not.
As stated above, the af
firmative action program at
Stanford has worked to some
degree for some minorities and
women, but black employees
are not among them. I caution
those temporarily benefitting
from the program not to be
smug. There are many people
throughout the University who
believe that they. too. and not
just Reagan, received a
mandate to *ake aim at minor
ities. all of them, and women.
I am left with the conclusion
that the Affirmative Action Of
fice at Stanford might even be
advantageous to blacks by its
absence. I would share the like

lv view of Keagan that the
affirmative action program at
Stanford has been fraudulent. It
would be generous to say that
the program here has ac
complished nothing; it would be
factual to state that it probably
has been counterproductive; it
would be laughable to state that
it has resulted in reverse dis
crimination as some may
charge.
Stanford has a new leader,
and many will wait to see if the
complexion of the University's
officers will change, for af
firmative action, if it is to suc
ceed. must be from and at the
top. In years past, the Univer
sity has boasted that it has done,
and would do many things rela
tive to minorities in spite of, and
not because of. federal pro
grams and mandates.
Many will wait to see if Stan
ford will join the ranks of faint
hearted institutions that will
dismantle their affirmative ac
tion programs on or before Jan
uary 21. It should be done here
if that office is continued as it
has in the past. Affirmative ac
tion is a concept that deserves to
live, and a concept from which
effective programs can be de
signed and implemented, if the
administration so desires.

Long before the ballot boxes
had closed a couple of weeks
ago. conservative forces began
placing their agenda and
priorities before Ronald Re
agan. It is amazing, but believ
able. that with all the problems
facing the United States and the
world, one of the first recom
mendations made by these
forces was the dismantlement
of affirmative action programs.
According to the Associated
Press, the recommendations
.are that (1) no employment data
be collected according
to race, sex or ethnic origin, and
(2) employment suits be ended.
The consequences of these two
steps, quite likely to be adopted
by Reagan, are ominous. No
factual information about race
and sex in employment
statistics, from which en
lightened and effective
divisions could be made and pro
grams designed, would be avail
able. Of equal concern is that
the civil rights of victims of ra
cism and sexism would be
almost indefensible.
There are probably a large
number of people who will agree
that racism and sexism do ex
ist; there is also probably a
large number who believe ra
cism and sexism are justified.
There are individuals who be
lieve racism and sexism are not

justified. and that something
must be done to counter them;
that something, that concept, is
affirmative action.
One must be forthright in
stating that most of the pro
grams that have been designed
in the name of that concept have
been deliberately fallacious and
weak at their core, inept in their
implementation, or both. Nev
ertheless, the concept of af
firmative action is and has
always been sound: the pro
grams have not been. If anyone
believes that an effective af
firmative action program can
not be designed and im
plemented. I ask them to look at
the number of white males in
the University's adminis
tration.
As one who has closely fol
lowed the affirmative action
program at Stanford. I can truly
state that the University has
never had an effective program,
and the program it has had has
been nonexistent as it pertains
to black staff, exempt and non
exempt. at all levels, on the
main campus and the medical
center. The program has been a
disgrace to this segment of the
minority community.
