News analysis?
On October 28 The Wall
Street Journal reported that
Harvard was thinking about
founding a gene-splicing firm: "
. . . Harvard would establish
and hold a minority interest in a
proposed genetic-engineering
corporation. That company
would use biological patents
that the university holds to com
pete with a growing number of
speculative companies working
with this research to create a
wide range of drugs
On November 13 the Daily re
ported on the possibility of Stan
ford beginning a similar
project. An article labeled
"News analysis" stated that
"The company under considera
tion at Harvard, in which the
university would hold a minor
ity interest, would use
biological patents developed at
the university to compete with
the growing number of private

companies using genetic engi
neering to create drugs
The Journal said "If suc
cessful. such a venture could re
lieve pressure on the univer
sity's limited endowment funds,
support further research and
help slow rising tuition costs,
proponents say."
Tlie Daily article continued
"Proponents of the Harvard
plan say the profits from such a
company could relieve pressure
on the university's endowment
income, support further re
search, and help slow the sharp
increases in tuition costs."

Apology
This is an open letter of
apology to those members of the
community who may have been
upset by the photograph of a
young actor from the cast of

Every man standing on the altar
in Memorial Church (Daily,
Nov. 18). While the production
does intend to make use of the
exciting and unusual spaces of
fered by the church, we have no
intention of staging the play in
such a way as might offend any
one's sensibilities. The photo
graph was not taken in re
hearsal. and was obviously
staged with disregard for the
potentially upsetting conse
quences. We must accept total
responsibility for the promo
tional aspects of our production.
Therefore, we hope that the
Stanford community will accept
our sincere apology for this un
fortunate incident.
On behalf of the Company
Staff of Everyman.

Noble stallions
As we ponder this name-and

mascot issue, let us give thought
to "Stanford Stallions." Look at
the advantages:
1. Alliteration. Not essential,
but attractive. Witness Pit
tsburg Pirates, Buffalo Bills,
Seattle Seahawks.
2. Uniqueness. Nobody is now
using "Stallions" as a name or
mascot, so far as I know.
3. Overtones. Strength,
drive, exuberance, endurance,
gallantry — the stallion has all
of these, and more.
4. Drama. Can you see the
picture? — a noble stallion step
ping out on the field at halftime,
ahead of the Stanford Band.
5. Feminine counterpart.
Our women's teams can be
known as "Stanford Fillies."
It's a natural, folks — a natu
ral!
