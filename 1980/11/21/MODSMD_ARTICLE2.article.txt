# Grad students' problems vary
## 
### Joan O'Connell Second in a scrips 
Dealing with the problems of gradu
ate students can be a complex matter,
yet according to many it is a necessary
and often neglected aspect of life at
the University.
The treatment and attention gradu
ate students receive here "can make
you feel like a non-person," said Nor
ma Henderson, a graduate student in
engineering.
Henderson echoed the feelings of
many grad students. Some of the prob
lems mentioned included school pres
sures, problems with personal rela
tionships and meeting people and un
certainty about the future.
"Unfortunately there's a per
ception of graduate students as being
some kind of different animal," said
Neil Kidkiff. a third-year grad stu
dent. "It's a bad idea to say that grad
students are somehow less needing of
help and interaction than other stu
dents."
But one factor which quickly be
comes apparent when speaking of
"graduate students," is the folly of
lumping them together under that
heading. As Dr. David Dorosin of Cow
ell Health Center's Counseling and
Psychological Services, explained,
"there is no one problem common to
all grad students.There are many
divisions and subsets — age is certain
ly one. but it's not the only one."
Dorosin and his staff annually see
about 10-12 percent of the graduate
population here, as opposed to seven
or eight percent of the undergraduates
on campus. Dorosin said this doesn't
necessarily mean graduate students
have more problems than under
graduates, because it may be that
"help-seeking behavior can be less
threatening to graduates than under
graduates." He did say there are some
definite problems which show up
among the graduate group.
"While undergrads may have some
amount of tension and uncertainty
about their futures, grads worry have
I made the right decision?"' Dorosin
said. He also cited internal and social
pressures which create an ambiguity

among students. Studenthood creates,
he explained, "a stretched out period
of dependency from childhood where
one is dependent to adulthood where
one is autonomous,'' he said.
Different needs
Graduate student needs differ in
many ways. There are a wide variety
of different ages among grad students,
and other differences include the vari
ous studies pursued, living situations,
marital status and in general different
personalities and outlooks.
For instance, one activity which
some say would help graduate stu
dents greatly is some kind of orien
tation at the beginning of the year.
Debbie Then of the Graduate Student
Association and COP member Marc
Ventresca, who is heading a renewed
effort by the ASSU to try to serve the
graduate community, both said some
kind of orientation is a top priority.
"We don't need people to come to
the airport and hold our hands/.'
Kidkiff said, "but all I got before I got
here, practically, was a letter which
said which bus to take from the air
port."
At the same tune, however, there
are graduate students like Jaganan
than Ganisan who, when asked about
the need for a campus-wide orien
tation program and more structured
social activites, said simply "tell that
to the kids. We're older and we're not
interested in those kinds of activites."
Loneliness
Single students especially complain
of feelings of loneliness and isolation
and the difficulty of meeting people.
Then said. But married students have
their own share of problems, especial
ly related to stress in their rela
tionships. said Dorosin.
Discontinuous students, those who
have left high-paying, high-status jobs
often have a problem adjusting, he
said. "Families which were used to
stable, attractive homes now have one
member spending most of his time in
the library or laboratory. It's a big ad
justment. and it's straining."
However, for other students like
Tom Shannon from the business
school, "social life and parties are

there if you want them.
"You're not talking about a groupof
18-vear-olds. Graduate students range
from about 22 to 35. It's difficult to ap
peal to all sectors," he said.
Dorosin said the one thing he
thought would be a great aid to gradu
ate students here is the encourage
ment by different schools of peer sup
port systems. Dorosin said that the
professional schools — business, law
and medicine — already had "rich"
support, systems and orientation pro
grams which benefited students. In
fact, one instance of this kind of effort,
Dorosin said, was the "well-being of
medical students" committee at the
medical school."
'Follow interests'
For off-campus students who might
feel lonely and isolated, Dorosin sug
gested that the best thing was "follow
interests." For married students hav
ing trouble adjusting to relationships,
he suggested "don't take it personally
and negotiate."
But Dorosin, like most of those
trying to deal with the graduate stu
dent question, acknowledged that the
situation is very complex. "In the cal
culus of human needs, serving this
group is a very complicated equa
tion," he said.

necessarily mean graduate students
have more problems than under
graduates, because it may be that
"help-seeking behavior can be less
threatening to graduates than under
graduates." He did say there are some
definite problems which show up
among the graduate group.
"While undergrads may have some
amount of tension and uncertainty
about their futures, grads worry have
I made the right decision?"' Dorosin
said. He also cited internal and social
pressures which create an ambiguity

among students. Studenthood creates,
he explained, "a stretched out period
of dependency from childhood where
one is dependent to adulthood where
one is autonomous,'' he said.
Different needs
Graduate student needs differ in
many ways. There are a wide variety
of different ages among grad students,
and other differences include the vari
ous studies pursued, living situations,
marital status and in general different
personalities and outlooks.
For instance, one activity which
some say would help graduate stu
dents greatly is some kind of orien
tation at the beginning of the year.
Debbie Then of the Graduate Student
Association and COP member Marc
Ventresca, who is heading a renewed
effort by the ASSU to try to serve the
graduate community, both said some
kind of orientation is a top priority.
"We don't need people to come to
the airport and hold our hands/.'
Kidkiff said, "but all I got before I got
here, practically, was a letter which
said which bus to take from the air
port."
At the same tune, however, there
are graduate students like Jaganan
than Ganisan who, when asked about
the need for a campus-wide orien
tation program and more structured
social activites, said simply "tell that
to the kids. We're older and we're not
interested in those kinds of activites."
Loneliness
Single students especially complain
of feelings of loneliness and isolation
and the difficulty of meeting people.
Then said. But married students have
their own share of problems, especial
ly related to stress in their rela
tionships. said Dorosin.
Discontinuous students, those who
have left high-paying, high-status jobs
often have a problem adjusting, he
said. "Families which were used to
stable, attractive homes now have one
member spending most of his time in
the library or laboratory. It's a big ad
justment. and it's straining."
However, for other students like
Tom Shannon from the business
school, "social life and parties are

there if you want them.
"You're not talking about a groupof
18-vear-olds. Graduate students range
from about 22 to 35. It's difficult to ap
peal to all sectors," he said.
Dorosin said the one thing he
thought would be a great aid to gradu
ate students here is the encourage
ment by different schools of peer sup
port systems. Dorosin said that the
professional schools — business, law
and medicine — already had "rich"
support, systems and orientation pro
grams which benefited students. In
fact, one instance of this kind of effort,
Dorosin said, was the "well-being of
medical students" committee at the
medical school."
'Follow interests'
For off-campus students who might
feel lonely and isolated, Dorosin sug
gested that the best thing was "follow
interests." For married students hav
ing trouble adjusting to relationships,
he suggested "don't take it personally
and negotiate."
But Dorosin, like most of those
trying to deal with the graduate stu
dent question, acknowledged that the
situation is very complex. "In the cal
culus of human needs, serving this
group is a very complicated equa
tion," he said.
Dealing with the problems of gradu
ate students can be a complex matter,
yet according to many it is a necessary
and often neglected aspect of life at
the University.
The treatment and attention gradu
ate students receive here "can make
you feel like a non-person," said Nor
ma Henderson, a graduate student in
engineering.
Henderson echoed the feelings of
many grad students. Some of the prob
lems mentioned included school pres
sures, problems with personal rela
tionships and meeting people and un
certainty about the future.
"Unfortunately there's a per
ception of graduate students as being
some kind of different animal," said
Neil Kidkiff. a third-year grad stu
dent. "It's a bad idea to say that grad
students are somehow less needing of
help and interaction than other stu
dents."
But one factor which quickly be
comes apparent when speaking of
"graduate students," is the folly of
lumping them together under that
heading. As Dr. David Dorosin of Cow
ell Health Center's Counseling and
Psychological Services, explained,
"there is no one problem common to
all grad students.There are many
divisions and subsets — age is certain
ly one. but it's not the only one."
Dorosin and his staff annually see
about 10-12 percent of the graduate
population here, as opposed to seven
or eight percent of the undergraduates
on campus. Dorosin said this doesn't
necessarily mean graduate students
have more problems than under
graduates, because it may be that
"help-seeking behavior can be less
threatening to graduates than under
graduates." He did say there are some
