# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Rachelle Marshall Israel occupies Palestinian schools

ln the past several years the
Stanford community has re
peatedly expressed concern for
academic freedom beyond its
borders. Faculty and students
have protested the persecution
of scientists and teachers in the
Soviet Union, Chile, Iran. South
Korea,, and elsewhere, rightly
recognizing that the first task of
a repressive government is to
silence its intellectuals.
Unfortunately almost no at
tention has been given to the
plight of students and faculty
members in areas occupied by
Israel. Since 1967 Israel has de
ported nearly 1500 Palestinians
from their homes on the West
Bank. According to a report is
sued by the American Friends
Service Committee the de
portees have consisted mainly
of journalists, writers, doctors,
lawyers, and especially teach

ers.
In November 1974, Dr Hanna
Nasir. a U.S.-educated physicist
and chancellor of Bir Zeit Uni
versity. was arrested in the
middle of the night, handcuffed
and blindfolded, and driven to
the Israeli border, where he was
unshackled and ordered to walk
into Lebanon. Dr. Nasir's ex
pulsion followed a protest dem
onstration by students at Bir
Zeit. but New York Times cor
respondent Terence Smith re
ported that during the demon
stration he had seen Nasir make
strenuous efforts to disperse the
students and to calm the situ
ation.
Israeli authorities closed
down Bir Zeit for two months in
1979 after a protest against the
shooting of one of its students by
an Israeli civilian. A smaller
school. Bethlehem University,
was closed at the same time,
along with several secondary
schools. Some were per
manently shut down, including
two teacher-training institutes
for women.
A few days ago. on November
17. Israeli soldiers fired into a
crowd of students at Bethlehem
University and wounded 11 of
them, including the 14-year-old
daughter of the acting president
of Bir Zeit. The students had
been throwing stones at Israeli
cars and armored vehicles be
cause Bir Zeit had been closed
yet again - this time during a
series of events called
"Palestine Week," which fea
tured speeches and songs that
Israeli military authorities con
sidered "anti-israel."
Since the Israeli occupation in
1967 West Bank schools have
been subject to strict regu
lations and often harassment.
Students frequently demon
strate against the occupation
army, but the disproportionate
Israeli response only increases
their resentment. According to
one West Bank college dean, oc
cupation authorities routinely
set up military checkpoints at
university gates, where stu
dents have to stand in the sun for
several hourse before being al

lowed to enter the campus. It is
impossible to maintain an or
derly class schedule under these
conditions.
After Camp David a number
of students who expressed op
position to the agreements were
arrested, held without charges,
and interrogated for several
hours before being released.
Several claimed they had been
beaten.
A United Nations task force
has concluded that the occupa
tion has led to "restrictions of
movement, assembly, speech,
and cultural activities, as well
as to shortages in qualified
teachers, suitable textbooks and
educational programmes and
facilities." Dr. Nasir told an in
terviewer in 1979 that Israeli oc
cupation authorities had made
it difficult for visiting pro
fessors at Bir Zeit to get work
permits, which in turn made it
difficult for the university to re
cruit qualified faculty from
abroad. The second greatest
problem, he said, was the re
striction on reading material:
"Almost all Arab periodicals
are banned, and what particu
larly disturbs our sense of hu
man rights is that periodicals
banned from the Bir Zeit library
are readily available at the
Hebrew University library."
Last July Israel amended the
Jordanian education laws and
brought the three West Bank
universities - Bir Zeit, Najaj
University, and the Islamic
Studies Institute of Hebron - un
der control of the Israeli mili
tary. From now on these institu
tions will be subject to the same
restrictions as secondary
schools: faculty members, cur
ricula, and textbooks must all
be approved by the military gov
ernment, and any professor
called in by authorities for ques
tioning will be disqualified from
teaching, even if no charges are
filed. Under the new regulations
universities must apply each
year for a special permit to op
erate.
These restrictions are clearly
intolerable to the Palestinians
who. next to the Israelis, are the

most highly educated people in
the Middle East. The former
mayor of Bethlehem, Elias
Kriej. said last June: "The Is
raeli hand is so heavy. The peo
ple can't breathe. They are suc
ceeding in destroying all
bridges of understanding be
tween Arabs and Jews." A
Washington Post correspon
dent who interviewed Freij de
scribed him as "the consum
mate Arab moderate and cham
pion of co-existence and cooper
ation between Arabs and Jews."
By cracking down on West
Bank schools Israel may suc
ceed in driving from the area all
those who want an education
and are able to go abroad for it.
The immediate effect will un
doubtedly be the elimination of
most of the potential leadership
on the West Bank. But the end
result will be increasing bitter
ness and extremism, with both
Israelis and Palestinians even
tually paying the price.
Several distinguished Ameri
cans. including Richard Falk,
Noam Chomsky, Marcus
Raskin, and I F. Stone, recently
sent a message to the Israeli
ambassador to the United
States, Ephraim Evron, pro
testing Israeli military in
tervention into the academic
life of Palestinian universities.
Similar action by Stanford stu
dents and faculty, many of
whom have close and construc
tive ties with Israeli colleagues,
could offer hope of reversing the
situation. Such action would
also reaffirm Stanford's conti
nuing dedication to academic
freedom regardless of where it
is threatened.
