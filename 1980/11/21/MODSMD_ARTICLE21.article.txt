## What is the greatest evil? 
### 
What, specifically, is the
evilist thing in the world to you?
This is the question I would like
you to ponder both now and dur
ing the upcoming Stanford day
of fasting, Monday night
through Tuesday night.
For thousands of students and
other Stanford residents the day
of fasting represents that one
time each year for really com
ing to grips with our role in the
world.
However, for me, as an or
ganizer of the same, it repre
sents something far different. It
represents the extreme absurdi
ty that half a dozen typical un
dergraduates concerned about
an incredibly hideous tragedy
must devote so much time for
nothing less than getting others
around them to just think about
what is right and wrong.
I would hope that most of my
readers can appreciate that it is
deeply evil that hundreds of mil
lions of human beings must fore
go the joys of life (indeed, of
being alive) due to severe mate
rial deprivation.
And yet, the question I must
ask myself every day of fasting
is why, why. why it seems so
hard to generate any sustained
care and action on the part of
the peoples of this nation.
I am not speaking for the
Committee on Hunger when I
say this, but my objective when
organizing the fast and its con
comittant activities, is not to
raise money, it is not to in
fluence people to set aside one
day out of many to indulge in
pity. It is to try, perhaps beyond
reasonable hope, to spark some
thing much larger, to spark the
entire public into the sustained
belief that we can and that we
must eliminate hunger, op
pression, homelessness, and
war once and for all.
Few analysts today contend
that the world is presently fac
ing absolute scarcities in either
food products or living space.
Actually, while demographers
are noting that birth rates are
finally declining in many Third
World nations, geneticists and
engineers are optimistic about
the future technological capaci
ty for expanded food production.
And yet, things are getting
worse. Although we are no long
er dealing with the periodic and
enormously deadly famines
which devastated China and In
dia during the 18- and early

1900s, we are instead confronted
with an unprecendentedly large
(and growing) international
population of chronically
malnourished. By the end of this
century it is estimated that the
world caloric deficit (the nutri
tional measure of extant under
nutrition) will increase by 23
percent.
So. I ask you; what can I do to
awaken our sleeping giant?
There is no logical reason in the
world why we. as a privileged
people, cannot mightily reduce
the plight of others. We can do
so much more.
No one can question our ca
pacity. In terms of basic simple
food output alone, we produce
enough grain within the U.S.,
beyond our present caloric and
protein consumption, to double
the caloric intakes of at least 1
billion of the world's poorest-fed

people.
The power of our industry, the
creativity of our research, the
enormous amounts of energy we
direct and control, the trillions
of dollars of capital we invest or
spend could be so much more
crucial to the lives and cultures
of peoples we only try to forget.
Perhaps it's to simple for me
to see: we can't care. Evil
things can only occur to us, not
to others. It is simply irrelevant
what happens to people we'll
probably never meet.
For me, the evilest thing in
the world is a toss-up between
the tragedy of the poor and des
titute, and the enormous
callousness on the part of so
many of us toward them.

is why, why. why it seems so
hard to generate any sustained
care and action on the part of
the peoples of this nation.
I am not speaking for the
Committee on Hunger when I
say this, but my objective when
organizing the fast and its con
comittant activities, is not to
raise money, it is not to in
fluence people to set aside one
day out of many to indulge in
pity. It is to try, perhaps beyond
reasonable hope, to spark some
thing much larger, to spark the
entire public into the sustained
belief that we can and that we
must eliminate hunger, op
pression, homelessness, and
war once and for all.
Few analysts today contend
that the world is presently fac
ing absolute scarcities in either
food products or living space.
Actually, while demographers
are noting that birth rates are
finally declining in many Third
World nations, geneticists and
engineers are optimistic about
the future technological capaci
ty for expanded food production.
And yet, things are getting
worse. Although we are no long
er dealing with the periodic and
enormously deadly famines
which devastated China and In
dia during the 18- and early

1900s, we are instead confronted
with an unprecendentedly large
(and growing) international
population of chronically
malnourished. By the end of this
century it is estimated that the
world caloric deficit (the nutri
tional measure of extant under
nutrition) will increase by 23
percent.
So. I ask you; what can I do to
awaken our sleeping giant?
There is no logical reason in the
world why we. as a privileged
people, cannot mightily reduce
the plight of others. We can do
so much more.
No one can question our ca
pacity. In terms of basic simple
food output alone, we produce
enough grain within the U.S.,
beyond our present caloric and
protein consumption, to double
the caloric intakes of at least 1
billion of the world's poorest-fed

people.
The power of our industry, the
creativity of our research, the
enormous amounts of energy we
direct and control, the trillions
of dollars of capital we invest or
spend could be so much more
crucial to the lives and cultures
of peoples we only try to forget.
Perhaps it's to simple for me
to see: we can't care. Evil
things can only occur to us, not
to others. It is simply irrelevant
what happens to people we'll
probably never meet.
For me, the evilest thing in
the world is a toss-up between
the tragedy of the poor and des
titute, and the enormous
callousness on the part of so
many of us toward them.

What, specifically, is the
evilist thing in the world to you?
This is the question I would like
you to ponder both now and dur
ing the upcoming Stanford day
of fasting, Monday night
through Tuesday night.
For thousands of students and
other Stanford residents the day
of fasting represents that one
time each year for really com
ing to grips with our role in the
world.
However, for me, as an or
ganizer of the same, it repre
sents something far different. It
represents the extreme absurdi
ty that half a dozen typical un
dergraduates concerned about
an incredibly hideous tragedy
must devote so much time for
nothing less than getting others
around them to just think about
what is right and wrong.
I would hope that most of my
readers can appreciate that it is
deeply evil that hundreds of mil
lions of human beings must fore
go the joys of life (indeed, of
being alive) due to severe mate
rial deprivation.
And yet, the question I must
ask myself every day of fasting
is why, why. why it seems so
hard to generate any sustained
care and action on the part of
the peoples of this nation.
I am not speaking for the
