## Many contenders for key Secretary of State spot Reagan lines up Cabinet possibles 
### Washington Post 
Washington - William Casey, who helped
run American intelligence operations be
hind enemy lines in World War 11. is ex
pected to be nominated to become the next
director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
authoritative sources said Wednesday.
And President-elect Ronald Reagan met
Wednesday with Sen John Tower (R-Tex.),
a leading contender for secretary of de
fense, but neither would confirm that Tower
will be offered the Pentagon job.
A congressional source, however, said
Tower is "all but certain - ' to be selected as
Reagan's defense secretary.
Casey, slated to take over the CIA, served
under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford as chairman of the Securities and Ex
change Commission, undersecretary of
state for economic affairs and president.of
the Export-Import Bank Henry Kissinger
forced him out of the State Department job.
Now 67, Casey worked for the Office of
Strategic Services (OSS) — the ClA's or
ganizational grandfather — during World
War 11. He served in London as chief of se
cret intelligence in Europe, with direct re
sponsibility for penetrating Nazi Germany
with secret agents in the waning days of the
war.
Kitchen cabinet
Reagan will meet soon, perhaps this
weekend, with the informal advisers, known
as his "kitchen cabinet," who have been
weighing possible Cabinet nominations.
This group already has sent the president
elect a list of several possible nominees for
each Cabinet post, with a tally of the votes
each person on the list received from mem
bers of the "kitchen cabinet."
The Reagan camp has promised to an
nounce Cabinet nominees by the first week
of December.
Allocating the job of secretary of state
now appears to be the key to Reagan's Cabi

net-building efforts. There has been no
shortage of candidates. Casey, who now is
expected to go to the CIA. wanted it. in
formed sources said, as do Gen Alexander
Haig. former Office of Management and
Budget director Caspar Weinberger,
former Treasury secretary William Simon,
former Texas governor John Connallv and
former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
Weinberger, long a Reagan confidant and
a member of Reagan's gubernatorial ad
ministration in Sacramento, still may be in
the running for the State Department,
though Keagan transition team sources say
it is much more likely that he will return to
the OMB.
However, informed sources say that
Weinberger does not want to go back to
OMB; he could end up as a counselor to the
president with Cabinet rank or in some oth
er role putting him close to Reagan. Rep.
David Stockman (R-Mich.i, is an active
candidate for the OMB job. and is supported
by many of Reagan's most ardent con
servative supporters. Stockman is also con
sidered a possible secretary of energy,
though he has told Reagan transition of
ficials that he would not take that post.
George Shultz. former Labor and Treas
ury secretary, has been mentioned per
sistently as the leading candidate for secre
tary of state, but he reportedly has said he
does not want the job and that his position on
the Middle East as vice chairman of the
Bechtel Corp., a multinational construction
firm, might preclude his taking it. (Shultz
has taken a more pro-Arab position than Re
agan did during the campaign.)
Opposition
William Simon apparently has been
eliminated by a decision — all but final,
sources say — to nominate him for secre
tary of the Treasury again. Still under con
sideration for the Treasury job are two oth
er former treasury secretaries — George

Shultz and John Connally. and Walter
Wriston. chairman of Citicorp.
Kissinger is fiercely opposed by con
servative politicians and groups that were
important Heagan backers in the campaign.
Connally. according to sources close to him,
may have been ruled out as a member of the
Reagan Cabinet, in part because of concern
that he was tainted bv his 1975 indictment
for taking an illegal gratuity in connection
with the raising of milk price supports in the
Nixon administration. Connally was ac
quitted.
A senior Reagan aide disclosed Wednes
day that the new administration will retain
William Webster as FBI director. Webster
was appointed to his 10-vear term by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and career FBI officials
reportedly were anxious that he not be re
moved by the new administration.
Education
In another bulletin Wednesday from the
rumor mill, word was passed that a number
of prominent Republicans in Congress are
backing Carolyn Warner, a Democrat who
holds the top education job in Arizona, to be
come secretary of education
Warner, who has criticized the Depart
ment of Education for regulatory proposals
she regarded as "incursions" into local
school affairs, said Wednesday she had been
contacted about the job by "congressional
Republicans," but not by the Reagan camp,
which is known to be interested in finding a
woman for the education post.
Ronald Reagan's personal lawyer, Wil
liam French Smith, is the clear choice to be
come attorney general in the new adminis
tration.
Smith, a New Hampshire native who re
ceived his law degree from Harvard Univer
sity. is a senior partner in the law firm of
Gibson. Dunn and Crutcher.

Education
In another bulletin Wednesday from the
rumor mill, word was passed that a number
of prominent Republicans in Congress are
backing Carolyn Warner, a Democrat who
holds the top education job in Arizona, to be
come secretary of education
Warner, who has criticized the Depart
ment of Education for regulatory proposals
she regarded as "incursions" into local
school affairs, said Wednesday she had been
contacted about the job by "congressional
Republicans," but not by the Reagan camp,
which is known to be interested in finding a
woman for the education post.

Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, left, talks with Henry Kissinger in Washington recently. Kissin
ger, the Secretary of State under President Richard Nixon, has been mentioned as a possibility for
the same office under Ronald Reagan. Other possible candidates are former director of the office
of Management and Budget Caspar Weinberger; former Labor and Treasury secretary George
Schultz; former Texas governor John Connally; former Treasury secretary William Simon; and Gen.
Alexander Haig.
Washington - William Casey, who helped
run American intelligence operations be
hind enemy lines in World War 11. is ex
pected to be nominated to become the next
director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
authoritative sources said Wednesday.
And President-elect Ronald Reagan met
Wednesday with Sen John Tower (R-Tex.),
a leading contender for secretary of de
fense, but neither would confirm that Tower
will be offered the Pentagon job.
A congressional source, however, said
Tower is "all but certain - ' to be selected as
Reagan's defense secretary.
Casey, slated to take over the CIA, served
under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford as chairman of the Securities and Ex
change Commission, undersecretary of
state for economic affairs and president.of
the Export-Import Bank Henry Kissinger
forced him out of the State Department job.
Now 67, Casey worked for the Office of
Strategic Services (OSS) — the ClA's or
ganizational grandfather — during World
War 11. He served in London as chief of se
cret intelligence in Europe, with direct re
sponsibility for penetrating Nazi Germany
with secret agents in the waning days of the
war.
Kitchen cabinet
Reagan will meet soon, perhaps this
weekend, with the informal advisers, known
as his "kitchen cabinet," who have been
weighing possible Cabinet nominations.
This group already has sent the president
elect a list of several possible nominees for
each Cabinet post, with a tally of the votes
each person on the list received from mem
bers of the "kitchen cabinet."
The Reagan camp has promised to an
nounce Cabinet nominees by the first week
of December.
Allocating the job of secretary of state
now appears to be the key to Reagan's Cabi

net-building efforts. There has been no
shortage of candidates. Casey, who now is
expected to go to the CIA. wanted it. in
formed sources said, as do Gen Alexander
Haig. former Office of Management and
Budget director Caspar Weinberger,
former Treasury secretary William Simon,
former Texas governor John Connallv and
former secretary of state Henry Kissinger.
Weinberger, long a Reagan confidant and
a member of Reagan's gubernatorial ad
ministration in Sacramento, still may be in
the running for the State Department,
though Keagan transition team sources say
it is much more likely that he will return to
the OMB.
However, informed sources say that
Weinberger does not want to go back to
OMB; he could end up as a counselor to the
president with Cabinet rank or in some oth
er role putting him close to Reagan. Rep.
David Stockman (R-Mich.i, is an active
candidate for the OMB job. and is supported
by many of Reagan's most ardent con
servative supporters. Stockman is also con
sidered a possible secretary of energy,
though he has told Reagan transition of
ficials that he would not take that post.
George Shultz. former Labor and Treas
ury secretary, has been mentioned per
sistently as the leading candidate for secre
tary of state, but he reportedly has said he
does not want the job and that his position on
the Middle East as vice chairman of the
Bechtel Corp., a multinational construction
firm, might preclude his taking it. (Shultz
has taken a more pro-Arab position than Re
agan did during the campaign.)
Opposition
William Simon apparently has been
eliminated by a decision — all but final,
sources say — to nominate him for secre
tary of the Treasury again. Still under con
sideration for the Treasury job are two oth
er former treasury secretaries — George

Shultz and John Connally. and Walter
Wriston. chairman of Citicorp.
Kissinger is fiercely opposed by con
servative politicians and groups that were
important Heagan backers in the campaign.
Connally. according to sources close to him,
may have been ruled out as a member of the
Reagan Cabinet, in part because of concern
that he was tainted bv his 1975 indictment
for taking an illegal gratuity in connection
with the raising of milk price supports in the
Nixon administration. Connally was ac
quitted.
A senior Reagan aide disclosed Wednes
day that the new administration will retain
William Webster as FBI director. Webster
was appointed to his 10-vear term by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter and career FBI officials
reportedly were anxious that he not be re
moved by the new administration.
