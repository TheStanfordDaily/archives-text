# Congress approves budget
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Senate and House conferees
agreed yesterday on far-reaching legislation that
could sharply curtail the use of busing to achieve
racial balance in the nation's public schools.
At the same time, the conferees rejected a pro
vision in an appropriations bill that would have de
nied President Carter funds to enforce the grain
embargo he imposed against the Soviet Union af
ter the Soviet invasion of Aghanistan.
Action on the appropriations measure was
taken as:
—Congress gave final approval to a $632.4
billion federal budget for fiscal 1981 that antici
pates enactment of a $35 billion to $40 billion tax
cut next year.
—Top Senate leaders predicted Senate passage
next week of a "superfund" bill to clean up aban
doned chemical dumps as well as oil and chemical
spills in the nation's waterways.
Appropriations bill
Both the anti-busing and grain embargo pro
visions on which the conferees acted had been at
tached as riders to an appropriations bill provid
ing funds for the State, Justice and Commerce de
partments and the federal judiciary in the fiscal
year that started Oct. 1.
The conferees fixed the spending ceiling in the
bill at slightly over $9 billion and then forwarded
the measure to the Senate and House for their ex
pected approval. It will then go to the president,
who opposes the anti-busing rider but has not said
whether he will veto the bill.
Although the administration opposed both of
the riders, it had no chance of eliminating the
anti-busing amendment in conference because it
had been approved earlier by both houses. Rejec
tion of the grain embargo rider was easier be
cause only the Senate had approved it and the
House conferees refused to accept it.
The anti-busing rider would bar the Depart

ment of Justice from spending any of its funds to
initiate or implement court suits requiring busing
to overcome racial imbalances in the schools.
Although opponents of the rider contend that it
is unconstitutional, both they and the rider's pro
ponents agree that it will cripple the use of busing
as a remedy for racial imbalance.
Court busing
"This doesn't circumscribe the courts from or
dering busing, nor does it affect the rights of
citizens or private groups from initiating busing
suits, but it does freeze out the Justice Depart
ment and that is the agency that has borne the
burden thus far," said a legal aide to Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn), the principal opponent of the
busing rider.
Although the rider does not appear to affect fed
eral busing orders already in effect, the Weicker
aide said they also might become involved "be
cause the orders are enforced by U.S. marshals
and they are part of the Justice Department."
Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti had said
that if Congress approved the anti-busing rider he
would recommend that Carter veto the entire bill.
The quick adoption of the congressional budget
resolution came as a quiet climax to months of po
litical wrangling. Because the resolution is an in
ternal congressional matter, it does not require
approval by the president.
The action came amid Republican charges that
the budget plan's projected deficit of $27.4 billion
for the year ending next Sept. 30 was un
realistically low and could easily reach $38 billion.
Sen. Henry Bellmon (R-Okla.), said that ap
propriations bills passed by the Senate or House
already exceed the budget resolution's $632.4
billion spending ceiling by several billion dollars.
Thus, under the 1975 Budget Act. Congress will
either have to go back and trim money from those
bills or raise the just-adopted spending ceiling in a
new budget resolution.
