# Auburn Dam given tentative nod
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington â€” Outgoing
Secretary of the Interior
Cecil Andrus said Wednes
day that the controversial
Auburn Dam northeast of
Sacramento, could be built
safely and that he would de
cide in the next 10 days
whether the project is justi
fied on environmental and
economic grounds.
"I think the Auburn Dam
will be built." Andrus said
during an interview.
A key problem, which
must be resolved before An
drus approves the project, is
whether the $1.4 billion dam
can release enough water
into the lower American
River to meet environmen
tal concerns.
While Andrus's decision
about the safety of the con
crete gravity design for the
dam removed a hurdle to its
construction, design and
funding for the structure
will have to be re-authorized
by Congress.

While stressing that he did
not intend to "create min
efields" through his de
cisions for President-elect
Ronald Reagan and for his
successor as secretary of
the Interior, Andrus said,
'Tin not going to stop doing
what we have scheduled to
do . . . we're going to con
tinue to administer the fed
eral government "
Scenic rivers
In another move impor
tant for California water re
sources, Andrus said he
would act by mid-December
on Gov. Edmund Brown's
hotly contested request to
have five California rivers
declared part of the national
wild and scenic river sys
tem.
The secretary of the in
terior has the authority to
designate the rivers as part
of the national system
without congressional ap
proval if he decides the
streams meet federal wild
river criteria. The rivers, all
in Northern California, are

the Smith, major portions of
the Klamath, Trinity and
Eel river system, and the
lower American River from
Nimbus Dam downriver to
the Sacramento River con
fluence on the outskirts of
Sacramento. The rivers are
alrtjdv part of the state's
wild and scenic river sys
tem.
The designation of the
rivers as part of the national
system would mean that
much less of their waters
would be available for ir
rigation projects and munic
ipal and industrial use.
Opposition
Brown's request for fed
eral designation has been op
posed bv Northern Califor
nia county officials. San Joa
quin Vailey farmers, the
Metropolitan Water District
of Southern California, Sen.
S.I. Hayakawa (R-Calif.),
and Sen. James MeClure < R-
Idaho). prospective chair
man of the Senate Energy
and Natural Resources
Committee.

In response to a suit filed
by local water users, U.S.
District Judge William In
gram placed a restraining
order on Andrus Tuesday
preventing him from mak
ing a decision on the desig
nation of the rivers pending
a Nov. ,5 court hearing in
San Jose, Calif.
As for the Auburn Dam,
Andrus said he had decided
that the curved, concrete
gravity design would pro
vide safety from earth
quakes. An earlier thin-arch
concrete design was jet
tisoned by the department,
partly because a 5.7 magni
tude earthquake cracked the
earth 40 miles northwest of
the Auburn site in 1975. The
new design is intended to
withstand a magnitude 6.5
earthquake.
Another factor in An
drus's final decision on the
dam will be whether or not
there are signed water con
tracts for delivery of im
pounded water before the
dam is built.
