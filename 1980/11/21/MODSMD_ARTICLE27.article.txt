# Relics reveal Israel's cultural background
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Jerusalem — A vast palace, the cavern
hideouts of rebels against Home, parts of
a 10th Century BC harbor, a biblical-era
health farm, a whole city gate from Old
Testament times — all this has emerged
this year from Israel's past.
Israeli and foreign archeologists,
winding up the 1980 digging season at one
of the world's richest troves of hidden
artifacts, are looking back on one of their
best years ever.
But as the scientists ponder their dis
coveries, complaints mount from the
Arab world and UNESCO — the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul
tural Organization — against this un
covering of the past.
The government television station in
neighboring Jordan recently told its
Middle East audience that archeological
exploration in Jerusalem and Israel "is
merely another form of Zionist im
perialism, an attempt to discover the
nonexistent roots of a Jewish presence in
the land of Palestine."
The ancestors of the Israelis arrived
here around 2000 BC,. and the ancestors
of the Arabs arrived about AD 630, which

gives the Israelis a certain historic
priority. What counts above all else,
however, is that Israel holds the land —
land on which Israel, its detractors con
tend, can do no right.
UNESCO, which is dominated '.
Third World nations, regularly con
demns Israel. At its 21st general con
ference in Belgrade, in September, it
adopted — for the 12th time — a resolu
tion opposing Israeli archeology, ex
pressly the work in Jerusalem The reso
lution said:
"... Israel is persisting, under various
pretexts, with its policy of altering and
destroying the historical and cultural
character of the occupied city of Jerusa
lem with a view to its Judaization."
Israeli archeologists dismiss such
criticism, pointing out that the scientists
digging here, Israelis and foreigners
alike, conscientiously uncover and save
the relics of all the peoples that have
lived in what is now Israel. In Jerusalem,
there are signs of 14 different cultures —
and all. the Israelis insist, including ear
ly Arab ruins, are being restored as
painstakingly as those from Israelite
times.
Yigael Yadin, the restorer of the Dead

Sea Scrolls, the Fortress of Masada and
the biblical citadel of Hazor. said:
"It is the job of the archeologist to
seek the truth and to unearth what is
thprp We are giving scientific attention
derthal, Moslem and Christian
; iiiu . much as when we discover a syn
agogue. The archeological standard is
very high."
Yadin, a well-known archeologist, is
deputy prime minister in the govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin. He scoffs at Arab statements that Is
raeli archeology is seeking to justify Is
rael's possession of the land.
"Unless there are roots, there is noth
ing to discover," he said. "But the
archeologist is a human being and a
citizen of his own country. If the U.S.
archeologist could discover anything
pre-Columbian showing an early Europe
an element in the United States, as a
root, wouldn't they be pleased to dis
cover it?
Look at the Arabs themselves. The
Egyptians and the Iraqis have been ex
cavating ruins in their countries with no
connection — linguistically, historically
or ethnically — between those who built
the pyramids and the Ziggurats and

those who are uncovering them and
trying to call them their roots.'
"The Jews were here, and no one can
deny it."
Yadin says that although greater ex
cavations have been made at temples
and cities in Egypt and ancient
Mesopotamia than in Israel, more sites
have been discovered, surveyed and
probed here than in any other part of the
vsorld.
"There are thousands of ancient
places," he said. "Those touched by the
spade, even in a small way, run into the
hundreds."
Of the 1980 discoveries, he finds the
most striking the uncovering at Tel Dan,
in what is now northern Israel, of an in
tact city gate, with towers at each side,
dating back about 4000 years.
Avraham Biran, who made the dis
covery during his 14th season of digging
at Tel Dan. agrees enthusiastically.
"An archeologist will take you to a site
and show you foundation stones, and tell
you there was a tower here, or a gate
here, he said "But all you can see is the
outline on the ground. At Tel Dan, we un
covered the whole structure, intact, and
you can see what it actually looked like."

you can see what it actually looked like."
Jerusalem — A vast palace, the cavern
hideouts of rebels against Home, parts of
a 10th Century BC harbor, a biblical-era
health farm, a whole city gate from Old
Testament times — all this has emerged
this year from Israel's past.
Israeli and foreign archeologists,
winding up the 1980 digging season at one
of the world's richest troves of hidden
artifacts, are looking back on one of their
best years ever.
But as the scientists ponder their dis
coveries, complaints mount from the
Arab world and UNESCO — the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cul
tural Organization — against this un
covering of the past.
The government television station in
neighboring Jordan recently told its
Middle East audience that archeological
exploration in Jerusalem and Israel "is
merely another form of Zionist im
perialism, an attempt to discover the
nonexistent roots of a Jewish presence in
the land of Palestine."
The ancestors of the Israelis arrived
here around 2000 BC,. and the ancestors
of the Arabs arrived about AD 630, which

gives the Israelis a certain historic
priority. What counts above all else,
however, is that Israel holds the land —
land on which Israel, its detractors con
tend, can do no right.
UNESCO, which is dominated '.
Third World nations, regularly con
demns Israel. At its 21st general con
ference in Belgrade, in September, it
adopted — for the 12th time — a resolu
tion opposing Israeli archeology, ex
pressly the work in Jerusalem The reso
lution said:
"... Israel is persisting, under various
pretexts, with its policy of altering and
destroying the historical and cultural
character of the occupied city of Jerusa
lem with a view to its Judaization."
Israeli archeologists dismiss such
criticism, pointing out that the scientists
digging here, Israelis and foreigners
alike, conscientiously uncover and save
the relics of all the peoples that have
lived in what is now Israel. In Jerusalem,
there are signs of 14 different cultures —
and all. the Israelis insist, including ear
ly Arab ruins, are being restored as
painstakingly as those from Israelite
times.
Yigael Yadin, the restorer of the Dead

Sea Scrolls, the Fortress of Masada and
the biblical citadel of Hazor. said:
"It is the job of the archeologist to
seek the truth and to unearth what is
thprp We are giving scientific attention
derthal, Moslem and Christian
; iiiu . much as when we discover a syn
agogue. The archeological standard is
very high."
Yadin, a well-known archeologist, is
deputy prime minister in the govern
ment of Prime Minister Menachem Be
gin. He scoffs at Arab statements that Is
raeli archeology is seeking to justify Is
rael's possession of the land.
"Unless there are roots, there is noth
ing to discover," he said. "But the
archeologist is a human being and a
citizen of his own country. If the U.S.
archeologist could discover anything
pre-Columbian showing an early Europe
an element in the United States, as a
root, wouldn't they be pleased to dis
cover it?
Look at the Arabs themselves. The
Egyptians and the Iraqis have been ex
cavating ruins in their countries with no
connection — linguistically, historically
or ethnically — between those who built
the pyramids and the Ziggurats and

those who are uncovering them and
trying to call them their roots.'
"The Jews were here, and no one can
deny it."
Yadin says that although greater ex
cavations have been made at temples
and cities in Egypt and ancient
Mesopotamia than in Israel, more sites
have been discovered, surveyed and
probed here than in any other part of the
vsorld.
"There are thousands of ancient
places," he said. "Those touched by the
spade, even in a small way, run into the
hundreds."
Of the 1980 discoveries, he finds the
most striking the uncovering at Tel Dan,
in what is now northern Israel, of an in
tact city gate, with towers at each side,
dating back about 4000 years.
Avraham Biran, who made the dis
covery during his 14th season of digging
at Tel Dan. agrees enthusiastically.
"An archeologist will take you to a site
and show you foundation stones, and tell
you there was a tower here, or a gate
here, he said "But all you can see is the
outline on the ground. At Tel Dan, we un
covered the whole structure, intact, and
you can see what it actually looked like."
