# P.A. city council to fill Sher's seat next month
## 
### Samuel Howe 
The Palo Alto City Council spent
most of Monday night rejecting re
quests for amendments to a long
range comprehensive plan which re
quires some local merchants to move
their businesses by 1993. However
there is at least one request which the
council will have to answer in the
near-future.
With Vice Mayor and Stanford law
professor Byron Sher due to leave the
council in December to take over the
state assembly seat which he won in
this month's election, the council will
have to decide on a replacement for
Sher's seat, and then select a new vice
mayor from among its ranks.
Sher, a Democrat who won the as
sembly seat by a large margin, will
leave soon for Sacramento, where he
will represent the 21st district, which
includes Palo Alto and Stanford. He is
one of two members on the nine-mem
ber city council who work at Stanford.
Of those most likely to fill Sher's
seat, none has any significant connec
tion with the University. Several of
those who have expressed interest are
currently on city boards such as the
Planning Commission or the Palo Alto
Housing Corp.. and others include a
shoe store owner and a former presi
dent of Co-Op supermarkets.
The council is expected to choose
the new member sometime in Decem
ber. If it is unable to come up with five
votes in favor of any one candidate,
the vote may be put to a special public
election in the spring, although this is
considered unlikely by council mem
bers.
Four of the council members
up for reelection in Novemberjnext
year.
In other recent business, the council
approved a revised land-use designa
tion for some 2400 acres of Stanford
land in the foothills which would per
mit "low-intensity" academic jfik
velopment there.
The area, on the west sidP ot

.Junipero Serra Road between Page
Mill and Alpine roads < known by many
as "the way up to the Dish"), had been
designated as open space, but Stan
ford officials argued that the land
should be classified as "academic re
serve," which would allow moderate
use.
University Planning Director Phil
Williams told the council that Stan
ford's long-range plans could include
"think tank, isolated academic uses,"
for the foothills land, but "nothing
with a campus-like intensity."
In other moves, the city council
voted a week and a half ago to tone
down local statutes which obligate
landlords to offer tenants one-year
leases with renew options. The revised
ordinance says landlords must con
tinue to offeV year-long leases to ten
ants. but do not have to offer renewal
to them.
The measure, which is designed to
prevent landlords from arbitrarily
evicting tenants without cause, is un
likely to have an adverse impact on
Stanford undergraduates, although it
could affect faculty and staff, and con
tinuing graduate students who rent off
campus.
In fact, the opposite of the meas
ure's design has sometimes plagued
undergraduates, many of whom are
required bv their landlords to sign
year-long leases. These students then
must continue to live in the house or
apartment, or find subletters if they
move back on campus or leave the
University.

The Palo Alto City Council spent
most of Monday night rejecting re
quests for amendments to a long
range comprehensive plan which re
quires some local merchants to move
their businesses by 1993. However
there is at least one request which the
council will have to answer in the
near-future.
With Vice Mayor and Stanford law
professor Byron Sher due to leave the
council in December to take over the
state assembly seat which he won in
this month's election, the council will
have to decide on a replacement for
Sher's seat, and then select a new vice
mayor from among its ranks.
Sher, a Democrat who won the as
sembly seat by a large margin, will
leave soon for Sacramento, where he
will represent the 21st district, which
includes Palo Alto and Stanford. He is
one of two members on the nine-mem
ber city council who work at Stanford.
Of those most likely to fill Sher's
seat, none has any significant connec
tion with the University. Several of
those who have expressed interest are
currently on city boards such as the
Planning Commission or the Palo Alto
Housing Corp.. and others include a
shoe store owner and a former presi
dent of Co-Op supermarkets.
The council is expected to choose
the new member sometime in Decem
ber. If it is unable to come up with five
votes in favor of any one candidate,
the vote may be put to a special public
election in the spring, although this is
considered unlikely by council mem
bers.
Four of the council members
up for reelection in Novemberjnext
year.
In other recent business, the council
approved a revised land-use designa
tion for some 2400 acres of Stanford
land in the foothills which would per
mit "low-intensity" academic jfik
velopment there.
The area, on the west sidP ot

.Junipero Serra Road between Page
Mill and Alpine roads < known by many
as "the way up to the Dish"), had been
designated as open space, but Stan
ford officials argued that the land
should be classified as "academic re
serve," which would allow moderate
use.
University Planning Director Phil
Williams told the council that Stan
ford's long-range plans could include
"think tank, isolated academic uses,"
for the foothills land, but "nothing
with a campus-like intensity."
In other moves, the city council
voted a week and a half ago to tone
down local statutes which obligate
landlords to offer tenants one-year
leases with renew options. The revised
ordinance says landlords must con
tinue to offeV year-long leases to ten
ants. but do not have to offer renewal
to them.
The measure, which is designed to
prevent landlords from arbitrarily
evicting tenants without cause, is un
likely to have an adverse impact on
Stanford undergraduates, although it
could affect faculty and staff, and con
tinuing graduate students who rent off
campus.
