# Drinking binges may damage heart

### 
New York (AP) — That
New Year's Eve party or
that drinking binge every
now and then may be damag
ing to your heart even if your
overall consumption of alco
holic beverages is moderate,
a new study says.
The finding is an impor
tant warning in light of re
cent evidence that mild
drinking may help prevent
heart disease, according to
researchers from the Medi
cal College of Wisconsin.
Their report was being
presented today to the
American Heart Association
scientific meeting in Miami
Beach. Fla.
"While there seems to be a
protective effect of alcohol
at moderate levels, it's prob
ably countered by drinking
occasional large amounts."
said Dr. Harvey Gruchow.
the biostatistician who
headed the study.
•"Our study suggests that
this 'binge effect' is inde
pendent of total consump
tion. The crucial variable
is not so much how much
they're drinking as the dif
ference between what they
usually drink and the amount
they drink on these special
occasions." he said.
Several recent studies —
including one in last Thurs

day's New England. Journal
of Medicine — have shown
that moderate drinking
seems for unknown reasons
to be associated with a lower
risk of heart disease.
These studies, however,
have measured only the ov
erall consumption of alco
hol. not drinking habits,
Gruchow said.
To see whether drinking
habits mattered, re
searchers examined the
drinking history of 225 men
who underwent a procedure
called coronary angio
graphy.
Ninety-six of the men
were classified as "binge"
drinkers, meaning that eve
ry now and then — less often
than once a week — they
drank more than usual, and
that this amount exceeded
the equivalent of five ounces
of pure alcohol.
The researchers found
that those who drank much
more on a "binge" night
than on a normal night
tended to have more heart
disease.
For example, men on a
"binge" who drank three
times their normal amount
had 50 percent more heart
blockage than those whose
"binges" involved drinking
only about twice the normal
amount.
