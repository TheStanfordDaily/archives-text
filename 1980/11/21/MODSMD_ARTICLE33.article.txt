## 
### Lori Roback 
' The courts are in trouble."
said Judge Edward Skoyan in a
lecture Monday on the future of
the court system
Skoyan, a Stanford Law
School alumnus, worked as an
attorney for 15 years before he
was appointed judge by Gov.
Pat Brown in 1965 He has spent
the past 15 years working in the
Santa Clara Judicial District.
"One of the greatest revolu
tions is occurring in the legal
system, especially in the trial
courts." said Skovan to a

gathering of Stanford-in-Law
members. This is creating a
shortage of judges, staff per
sonnel and trial attorneys, he
added.
He further explained that the
courts have become swamped
with problems of the private
sector In essence, the courts
have developed a supervisory
function, he c' m (1 Citing
many case examples, he said
people see "no other place to
turn, so they turn to the courts
The reason for the increase in
the number of private cases

coming into court. Skoyan said,
is the high emphasis placed on
individual rights He pointed out
that people now see the court
system as a vehicle to defend
their rights.
Unfortunately, he added, this
plethora of cases congests the
courts, reducing the system's
efficiency.
One member of the audience
questioned whether crowding
reduced the defendant's chance
for a fair trial, and Skoyan as
sured her the integrity of the
courts is upheld regardless of

the number of cases In the long
run.the taxpayer shoulders
most of the financial burden, he
explained
Another change in the system
Skovan cited was created by the
Supreme Court ruling of "inade
quate representation This rul
ing allows the defendant to ap
peal his sentence on the grounds
that his attorney did not repre
sent him to the best of his or her
abilities
The dramatic increase in ap
peals resulting from this ruling
is illustrated by the fact that 78
percent of sentences are cur
rently appealed in Los Angeles,
said Skovan. an increase that
cost taxpayers $800,000 last
year.
"The decision has to be
made: how much court do you
wa/it?" the judge said. "If you
want it to operate as it operates
at the present time, you must
grit your teeth. We need more
judges, public defendants, and
the rest."
Skovan mentioned communi
ty arbitration as a viable alter
native He explained that this
system allows the community to
deal directly with some of its
own problems while alleviating
the overcrowding in the courts.
He said the real solution, how
ever. is to increase public
awareness. According to
Skoyan. people must look past
the headlines and truly under
stand the impact of what goes on
