# Soviet moonlighting profitable
##

Kroin the Daily wire services
Moscow — Moonlighting is a growing Soviet
custom, and it provides a solution to the problem
of where to find skilled labor
Moonlighters repair cars, fix plumbing and
paint apartments. Because they never report
their earnings to the authorities, they are techni
cally evading income tax and are considered to be
working illegally.
The skilled worker sent by a state enterprise
often arrives days or weeks late and his work is
often sub-standard. On the other hand, the moon
lighter is punctual and carries out his work
scrupulously.
Little surprise, then, that Soviet citizens turn
more and more to him for their repairs, even
though he may cost three or four times more than
the state worker.
Naturally, a skilled worker like a plumber is in
a privileged position — his official monthly pay
averages about $210 and he can easily boost this by
moonlighting to $1120 And many skilled workers
find that they can moonlight during official work
ing hours, using state tools and equipment.
Private individuals aren't the only ones to turn
to moonlighters for help — state firms and farms
use the services of moonlighters as well To meet
production quotas, they find they need extra
workers — and work contracts with moonlighters

are usually made on the side and never reported
officially, saving tax.
The moonlighter has produced a strange
phenomenon in the Soviet Union: the
"shabashniki," or work brigades which go from
one factory in central Asia for a few months to a
lumber camp in Siberia for a few more months.
These brigades are ready to go anywhere in the
Soviet Union where extra skilled labor is re
quired. and are rewarded by bonuses.
The press has frequently criticized this prac
tice. but it appears to be tolerated by authorities
because a lack of skilled labor in remote areas
would hinder planned economic development.
Skilled workers can earn more than a Soviet
academician by moonlighting, a practice in
dulged in these days even by intellectuals. Many
doctors, for instance, will give private consulta
tions, outside the state health system.
Some university graduates have no scruples
about writing a thesis for another wanting a doc
torate. charging about $2100 for their expertise.
"Writing a thesis for somebody who is incompe
tent to do so is frankly less painful and much more
profitable than teaching classes.' according to a
physicist in his 40's who boasted that he has writ
ten six theses for young graduates.
Moonlighting is as much a part of everyday life
as the black market in the Soviet Union.
