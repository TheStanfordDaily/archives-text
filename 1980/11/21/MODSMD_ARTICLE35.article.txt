Dear Hun Me,
Tell me. whose idea was it
to blacktop the Quad in
terior? Has it always been
utfly? Is anyone in the ad
ministration preparing a
facelift for the area ?
H H
Believe it or not. the in
terior of the Quad has
changed little over the past
88 years. According to the
plan for University land
scaping developed at the turn
of the century by Frederick
Law Olmsted, the parts of
the Quad now in gravel or
blacktop were to be covered
with brick or stone pavers.
Hut in 1912 Stanford went
ahead and did it in asphalt.
Eventually much of the pave
ment was covered with grav
el.
In 1914, a decade after
Olmsted's death, his nephew
and stepson. John Charles
Olmsted, came out to Stan
ford to offer advice on the
continuing development of
the University landscape.
Apparently he was not at all
pleased that the senior
Olmsted's instructions had
been ignored, and demanded
that something be done.
And that's the way it's

been ever since Those parts
of the Quad not paved with
concrete or occupied by the
planting circles look as ugly
as ever, and people keep de
manding that something be
done Your Bug was told this
remarkable story by Direc
tor of Planning Phil Wil
liams. He explained why the
Quad still looks like an aban
doned airfield.
"The improvements
would be costly, and there is
always the problem of com
petition for funds with
academic programs and oth
er projects. In addition, it's
hard to get over the inertia
after all these years. Im
provement of the Quad has
never received high enough
priority to qualify for Uni
versity plant improvement
funds , nor has it ever stirred
up much interest among
donors.
Nonetheless, a new plan
was drawn up two or three
years ago that would be fair
• iy economical: The planting
circles would be enlarged,
and the areas of crumbling
blacktop would be repaved in
asphalt with the addition of
decorative stone. This plan
was expected to cost about

$300,000 at that time Now, of
course, it would cost more.
To follow Olmsted's plan
would be even more ex
pensive
Lately more interest has
been expressed in the
project, and it will be added
to the general plant improve
ment request this year. Per
haps. I suggested, this col
umn might inspire a wealthy
philanthropist to donate the
necessary funds. Williams
sighed and said. "We were
hoping that someone like
that would notice the prob
lem at President Kennedy's
inauguration and offer to
help. But we haven'l heard a
thing."
What about a Greening of
the Quad'.' It sounds good, but
a lawn would never survive
the pedestrian traffic that
criss-crosses it. The only
way to add greenery would
be to expand the planting
circles
