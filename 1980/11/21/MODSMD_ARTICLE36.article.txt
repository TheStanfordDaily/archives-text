# ‘Angell Ancients’ enjoy daily runs
## 
### Jonathan Traugott 
It's high noon at Angell Field. A few suf
fering souls are sacrificing their lunch hour
to do grueling laps in the mid-dav heat.
There is a look of pain on many of these
sweaty faces as they round the track.
Meanwhile, another group is forming
along the side of the field. Smiles and greet
ings abound as they arrive by twos and
threes from Kncina Gym. A few jokes are
told as everyone warms up. This good hu
mor and enthusiasm mark a sharp contrast
to the grim tenacity with which the other
runners confront the track.
After a few more minutes of laughter,
someone in the group finally shouts. "Let's
go!" And 20 bodies jubilantly head off for
the hills.
These are the Angell Field Ancients, a
collection of faculty, staff and students who
manage to associate exercise with pleasure
during their noontime runs from Angell
Field.
All ages represented
Although one member jokingly refers to
the Ancients as "a bunch of leathery old
men." the running club harbors joggers of
all ages, men and women.
The group s motto,, "Start out slow and
taper off." is as deceptive as the group's
name. Graduate-division winners of this
year's intramural cross-country race, the
group includes'many who regularly dist
inguish themselves in other Bay Area com
petitions. There are more than 10 mara
thoners among the 45 regulars, according to
Civil Engineering Prof. Jim Gere, a mem
ber
But the group is by no means exclusive. "I

don't want to scare people off." says Gere.
"There are plenty of good runners, but when
we start out. people break into groups of
varying abilities so slow runners will
always find company."
Mutual support
Although many of the Ancients compete
in running events, most of them say mutual
support rather than personal competition is
at the heart of the group. "The person you
really have to beat is yourself." says former
Olympic javelin thrower Phil Connelly.
"People genuinely care about each other's
successes." he adds. Gere echoed this opin
ion. noting that the emphasis is not so much
on outdoing other runners as in setting per
sonal records.
French Prof. Alphonse Juilland says the
Ancients are an inspiration to older runners
since several senior members have set na
tional records. .Juilland is perhaps the most
renowned of all members as holder of the 50-
years-and-over world records in in both the
1(H)- and 200-meter sprints since 1972.
Last year the Ancients placed second in
Hayward State's California Faculty-Staff
Intercollegiate Track Meet and were win
ners of the University of Nebraska's "Kun
by Mail'' competition, held in 1976 and 1977.
In this contest, different university running
clubs sent in their results for specified races
and points were awarded for the best times.
In this way, university employees from all
over the country could compete against
each other while avoiding the prohibitive
cost of a centralized track meet.
Not all is geared toward training and
competition, however. Fun and games are

an integral part of the club. Adjunct Elec

joys thinking up team and handicap races
that allow runners of different abilities to
compete while providing laughs for all.
In one event, teams of two share the use of
a single bicycle to help get them both across
the finish line. There are various strategies
for sharing the bikes and humorous com
plications often arise, especially if the
riders are of different stature, explained
Carpenter. ,
Gere noted that in addition to their daily
activities, the Ancients have been active in
promoting running at Stanford by organiz
ing campus runs and raising more than
$1000 for improvements to the stadium
track.
Social barriers cut
Another positive aspect of the club is that
it cuts across social barriers set up by Uni
versity hierarchy.
"The club brings faculty and staff from
many parts of the University together," ex
plained Gere. "This is not a group of famous
professors. We used to have four guys from
the mail room. When you run, there's no so
cial status: everybody's the same."
Whatever your age, ability or social
standing, if you enjoy running and good
company, the Ancients welcome you to join.
Simply show up at Angell Field any week
day noon and join the crowd.
But watch out — running is addictive, so
you might be skipping lunch for some time
to come.

activities, the Ancients have been active in
promoting running at Stanford by organiz
ing campus runs and raising more than
$1000 for improvements to the stadium
track.
Social barriers cut
Another positive aspect of the club is that
it cuts across social barriers set up by Uni
versity hierarchy.
"The club brings faculty and staff from
many parts of the University together," ex
plained Gere. "This is not a group of famous
professors. We used to have four guys from
the mail room. When you run, there's no so
cial status: everybody's the same."
Whatever your age, ability or social
standing, if you enjoy running and good
company, the Ancients welcome you to join.
Simply show up at Angell Field any week
day noon and join the crowd.
But watch out — running is addictive, so
you might be skipping lunch for some time
to come.

The Angell Ancients warm up before their noontime runs. This group, composed of faculty, staff and
students, includes 10 marathoners among its 45 "regulars."
It's high noon at Angell Field. A few suf
fering souls are sacrificing their lunch hour
to do grueling laps in the mid-dav heat.
There is a look of pain on many of these
sweaty faces as they round the track.
Meanwhile, another group is forming
along the side of the field. Smiles and greet
ings abound as they arrive by twos and
threes from Kncina Gym. A few jokes are
told as everyone warms up. This good hu
mor and enthusiasm mark a sharp contrast
to the grim tenacity with which the other
runners confront the track.
After a few more minutes of laughter,
someone in the group finally shouts. "Let's
go!" And 20 bodies jubilantly head off for
the hills.
These are the Angell Field Ancients, a
collection of faculty, staff and students who
manage to associate exercise with pleasure
during their noontime runs from Angell
Field.
All ages represented
Although one member jokingly refers to
the Ancients as "a bunch of leathery old
men." the running club harbors joggers of
all ages, men and women.
The group s motto,, "Start out slow and
taper off." is as deceptive as the group's
name. Graduate-division winners of this
year's intramural cross-country race, the
group includes'many who regularly dist
inguish themselves in other Bay Area com
petitions. There are more than 10 mara
thoners among the 45 regulars, according to
Civil Engineering Prof. Jim Gere, a mem

But the group is by no means exclusive. "I

don't want to scare people off." says Gere.
"There are plenty of good runners, but when
we start out. people break into groups of
varying abilities so slow runners will
always find company."
Mutual support
Although many of the Ancients compete
in running events, most of them say mutual
support rather than personal competition is
at the heart of the group. "The person you
really have to beat is yourself." says former
Olympic javelin thrower Phil Connelly.
"People genuinely care about each other's
successes." he adds. Gere echoed this opin
ion. noting that the emphasis is not so much
on outdoing other runners as in setting per
sonal records.
French Prof. Alphonse Juilland says the
Ancients are an inspiration to older runners
since several senior members have set na
tional records. .Juilland is perhaps the most
renowned of all members as holder of the 50-
years-and-over world records in in both the
1(H)- and 200-meter sprints since 1972.
Last year the Ancients placed second in
Hayward State's California Faculty-Staff
Intercollegiate Track Meet and were win
ners of the University of Nebraska's "Kun
by Mail'' competition, held in 1976 and 1977.
In this contest, different university running
clubs sent in their results for specified races
and points were awarded for the best times.
In this way, university employees from all
over the country could compete against
each other while avoiding the prohibitive
cost of a centralized track meet.

In one event, teams of two share the use of
a single bicycle to help get them both across
the finish line. There are various strategies

riders are of different stature, explained
