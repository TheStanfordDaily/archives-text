The Philadelphia Story
Tonight. Kresge
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people trying to
define what is and isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashed translation
of Philip Barry's stage play, but by
any definition, it makes an exceed
ingly entertaining movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing it to
the screen The director was
George Cukor. a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine per
formances out of seemingly any
actor. And the actors are by no
means ordinary: the cast includes
Katharine Hepburn, nostrils flar
ing and indignation aflame; Cary
Grant, cominc sense perfectly in
tune: and James Stewart, drunk
enlv singing Over the Kainbow"
as if he'd stake his reputation on it.
— Jim Mattson

Tonight. Kresge
George Cukor directed Cary
Grant and Katharine Hepburn in
this intelligent, elegant, very fun
ny 1938 comedy. Grant is engaged
to be married to a snooty heiress;
Hepburn is the heiress' oddball sis
ter. As you might expect, eccen
tricity and true love turn out to be
very nearly the same thing.
Cukor was able to take Philip
(The Philadelphia Story) Barry's
stage play and make it seem in
herently cinematic. His method
was not to "open up" the on-screen
action but to make it seem even
more intimate because of the pres
ence of the camera. His is the quiet
humor of an anecdote shared
among friends; its subtlety makes
it all the more appealing.
Edward Everett Horton. the
greatest eccentric of them all, is
featured.

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★
Sunday. Mem Aud
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. Using the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of
almost frighteningly correct in
stincts named Justin Henry, Ben
ton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study.
But the movie is seriously
flawed in its treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streepi? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little too neat for its own good.
Yet, in the main, Benton has
done a superb job of taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of depth and complexity.
The superb composition is the
work of cinematographer Nestor
Almendros.
— Ron Lillejord

The Great Santini **
Aquarius. Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that s come before Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so g00d... but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
for another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.
— Bob Dawson
La Cage Aux holies ★★★
Fox. Redwood City
When your future father-in-law
is the undersecretary for public
morality, how do you explain the
six-foot dildo in the living room?
Or the fishnet stockings on the but
ler? Or your mother's beard?
A Guess Who's Coming to Din
ner for the '70s. but much funnier
and much less offensive. Ugo
Tagnazzi and Michel Serrault star.
Starts next Thursday, with Out
rageous!.
— Mike Hale
Every Man for Himself ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The credits tell us that Every
Man for Himself is a film "com
posed by" Jean-Luc Godard. The
verb is an accurate one; the movie
feels like a concert piece, albeit a
very unusual one. Godard, the
most politically active of the
French New Wave filmmakers,
has orchestrated a bleak, disturb
ing vision of human dependence
and independence. The characters
are as locked into their lives and
lifestyles as notes in a symphony.
Every Man for Himself gives us
no easy answers; every possible
solution is flanked by problems.
Godard's aim is to engage and
enrage us. He succeeds, ad
mirably.
- J.M.
Dr. Slranpelove ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.
Plays Saturday through Mon
day.
- J.M.

/
2001: A Spare Odyssey ★★★★
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Hook of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant , they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, liary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show tonight and tomor
row night.
- J.M.
The Kids Are Alright ***
Old Mill. Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live
Rock" by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
came first: our generation or The
Who?
Late show this weekend.
- J.M.

Hoing There ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Hal Ashbv (Coming Home,
Hound for Glory ) directed this af
fecting. gentle satire about a man
whose innocence becomes a valu
able commodity. The late Peter
Sellers plays Chance the gar
dener ; this may have been his best
performance since his portrayal of
Quilty in Kubrick's Lolita.
living There is so tied to
Chance's deadpan, sim
plemindedly literal world-view
that the audience leaves the thea
ter a little dazed — our thought
processes have begun to slow and
stretch to match his. Shirley
MacLaine and Melvyn Douglas
(who won an academy award for
his efforts) turn in fine supporting
characterizations.
Plays Saturday through Mon
day with Dr. Strangelove.
- J.M.

The Elephant Man ****
Park Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick.
The Elephanl Man Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battling our fear of the
unknown

Stardust Memories ★★★★
I'alo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors; the structure is as loose as
Hananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline, Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantic
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories -some great ones but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline.

Every Man for Himself ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The credits tell us that Every
Man for Himself is a film "com
posed by" Jean-Luc Godard. The
verb is an accurate one; the movie
feels like a concert piece, albeit a
very unusual one. Godard, the
most politically active of the
French New Wave filmmakers,
has orchestrated a bleak, disturb
ing vision of human dependence
and independence. The characters
are as locked into their lives and
lifestyles as notes in a symphony.
Every Man for Himself gives us
no easy answers; every possible
solution is flanked by problems.
Godard's aim is to engage and
enrage us. He succeeds, ad
mirably.

Dr. Slranpelove ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.
Plays Saturday through Mon
day.

2001: A Spare Odyssey ★★★★
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Hook of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant , they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.

Lockwood and a computer named

The Kids Are Alright ***
Old Mill. Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma

the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live

creation of a public image. Which

Stardust Memories ★★★★
I'alo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors; the structure is as loose as
Hananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline, Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantic
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories -some great ones but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust

The Philadelphia Story
Tonight. Kresge
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people trying to
define what is and isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashed translation
of Philip Barry's stage play, but by
any definition, it makes an exceed
ingly entertaining movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing it to
the screen The director was
George Cukor. a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine per
formances out of seemingly any
actor. And the actors are by no
means ordinary: the cast includes
Katharine Hepburn, nostrils flar
ing and indignation aflame; Cary
Grant, cominc sense perfectly in
tune: and James Stewart, drunk
enlv singing Over the Kainbow"
as if he'd stake his reputation on it.

Holiday ***★
Tonight. Kresge
George Cukor directed Cary
Grant and Katharine Hepburn in
this intelligent, elegant, very fun
ny 1938 comedy. Grant is engaged
to be married to a snooty heiress;
Hepburn is the heiress' oddball sis
ter. As you might expect, eccen
tricity and true love turn out to be
very nearly the same thing.
Cukor was able to take Philip
(The Philadelphia Story) Barry's
stage play and make it seem in
herently cinematic. His method
was not to "open up" the on-screen
action but to make it seem even
more intimate because of the pres
ence of the camera. His is the quiet
humor of an anecdote shared
among friends; its subtlety makes
it all the more appealing.
Edward Everett Horton. the

Writer-director Robert Ben

Hoffman and a youngster of
almost frighteningly correct in
stincts named Justin Henry, Ben
ton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study.
But the movie is seriously
flawed in its treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streepi? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little too neat for its own good.

done a superb job of taking slender
movie material and creating a

Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now

Stardust Memories ★★★★
I'alo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors; the structure is as loose as
Hananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline, Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantic
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories -some great ones but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a

The Philadelphia Story
Tonight. Kresge
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people trying to
define what is and isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashed translation
of Philip Barry's stage play, but by
any definition, it makes an exceed
ingly entertaining movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing it to
the screen The director was
George Cukor. a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine per
formances out of seemingly any
actor. And the actors are by no
means ordinary: the cast includes
Katharine Hepburn, nostrils flar
ing and indignation aflame; Cary
Grant, cominc sense perfectly in
tune: and James Stewart, drunk
enlv singing Over the Kainbow"
as if he'd stake his reputation on it.
— Jim Mattson
Holiday ***★
Tonight. Kresge
George Cukor directed Cary
Grant and Katharine Hepburn in
this intelligent, elegant, very fun
ny 1938 comedy. Grant is engaged
to be married to a snooty heiress;
Hepburn is the heiress' oddball sis
ter. As you might expect, eccen
tricity and true love turn out to be
very nearly the same thing.
Cukor was able to take Philip
(The Philadelphia Story) Barry's
stage play and make it seem in
herently cinematic. His method
was not to "open up" the on-screen
action but to make it seem even
more intimate because of the pres
ence of the camera. His is the quiet
humor of an anecdote shared
among friends; its subtlety makes
it all the more appealing.
Edward Everett Horton. the
greatest eccentric of them all, is
featured.

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★
Sunday. Mem Aud
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. Using the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of
almost frighteningly correct in
stincts named Justin Henry, Ben
ton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study.
But the movie is seriously
flawed in its treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streepi? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little too neat for its own good.
Yet, in the main, Benton has
done a superb job of taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of depth and complexity.
The superb composition is the
work of cinematographer Nestor
Almendros.

Every Man for Himself ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The credits tell us that Every
Man for Himself is a film "com
posed by" Jean-Luc Godard. The
verb is an accurate one; the movie
feels like a concert piece, albeit a
very unusual one. Godard, the
most politically active of the
French New Wave filmmakers,
has orchestrated a bleak, disturb
ing vision of human dependence
and independence. The characters
are as locked into their lives and
lifestyles as notes in a symphony.
Every Man for Himself gives us
no easy answers; every possible
solution is flanked by problems.
Godard's aim is to engage and
enrage us. He succeeds, ad
mirably.

Dr. Slranpelove ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever made

that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.

bleak. His characters are engulfed

Stardust Memories ★★★★
I'alo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors; the structure is as loose as
Hananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline, Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantic
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan, Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories -some great ones but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline.

The Philadelphia Story
Tonight. Kresge
This is one of those movies that
gives headaches to people trying to
define what is and isn't
"cinematic." The Philadelphia
Story is an unabashed translation
of Philip Barry's stage play, but by
any definition, it makes an exceed
ingly entertaining movie.
The solution can only be found in
the talent involved in bringing it to
the screen The director was
George Cukor. a gifted craftsman
capable of bringing fine per
formances out of seemingly any
actor. And the actors are by no
means ordinary: the cast includes
Katharine Hepburn, nostrils flar
ing and indignation aflame; Cary
Grant, cominc sense perfectly in
tune: and James Stewart, drunk
enlv singing Over the Kainbow"
as if he'd stake his reputation on it.
— Jim Mattson
Holiday ***★
Tonight. Kresge
George Cukor directed Cary
Grant and Katharine Hepburn in
this intelligent, elegant, very fun
ny 1938 comedy. Grant is engaged
to be married to a snooty heiress;
Hepburn is the heiress' oddball sis
ter. As you might expect, eccen
tricity and true love turn out to be
very nearly the same thing.
Cukor was able to take Philip
(The Philadelphia Story) Barry's
stage play and make it seem in
herently cinematic. His method
was not to "open up" the on-screen
action but to make it seem even
more intimate because of the pres
ence of the camera. His is the quiet
humor of an anecdote shared
among friends; its subtlety makes
it all the more appealing.
Edward Everett Horton. the
greatest eccentric of them all, is
featured.

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★
Sunday. Mem Aud
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. Using the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of
almost frighteningly correct in
stincts named Justin Henry, Ben
ton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study.
But the movie is seriously
flawed in its treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streepi? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little too neat for its own good.
Yet, in the main, Benton has
done a superb job of taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of depth and complexity.
The superb composition is the
work of cinematographer Nestor
Almendros.

Every Man for Himself ★★★★
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The credits tell us that Every
Man for Himself is a film "com
posed by" Jean-Luc Godard. The
verb is an accurate one; the movie
feels like a concert piece, albeit a
very unusual one. Godard, the
most politically active of the
French New Wave filmmakers,
has orchestrated a bleak, disturb
ing vision of human dependence
and independence. The characters
are as locked into their lives and
lifestyles as notes in a symphony.
Every Man for Himself gives us
no easy answers; every possible
solution is flanked by problems.
Godard's aim is to engage and
enrage us. He succeeds, ad
mirably.

Dr. Slranpelove ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alto
The greatest comedy ever made
about the end of the world by nu
clear holocaust (it's even funnier
than Panic in the Year Zero, and
that's funny).
This is a saga of a nuclear war
started by a madman (Rip Torn)
and finished by high government
officials, most of whom are played
by Peter Sellers. We watch man
kind's hopes for survival being
sealed off, one by one; director
Stanley Kubrick wipes out the hu
man race with manic glee. Dr.
Strangelove is a wonderfully sus
tained exercise in misanthropy —
the threat of nuclear war is so
frightening that the only way to
deal with it is with derisive
laughter.
Plays Saturday through Mon
day.

2001: A Spare Odyssey ★★★★
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying

Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Hook of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant , they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.

The Kids Are Alright ***
Old Mill. Mountain View
The Kids Are Alright is like an

the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place. This chronicle of the long,
successful life of The Who is a
compilation of concert footage and
interviews—much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span. What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don't know
all the words from "Long Live

ly becomes an examination of the
creation of a public image. Which
