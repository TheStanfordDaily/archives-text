# Speaker fears 'human life amendment'

"We're in trouble," asserted Nan
Bostick of the Children bv Choice
Coalition of San Mateo County. "I
think passage of the Human life
amendment' is very feasible."
Bostick lamented the threats to the
Fro-Choice movement at an informal
discussion Tuesday afternoon which
was sponsored by Stanford's Fro-
Choice Alliance. It was the Alliance's
first event of the year.
Bostick emphatically denied that
the Fro-Choice movement is pro-abor
tion as well. Most women who are
members of her coalition and others
like it would not have an abortion
themselves, whether for religious or
moral reasons, she said.
Instead. Bostick said, they advocate
the position that every woman has the
Constitutional and human right to
chose freely whether or not she wants
to continue pregnancy.
"The press says we're pro-abortion,
but we're not. What we fight for is the
right for everyone to make that de
cision in accordance with their own
beliefs and support systems." she
said.
Acording to Bostick. for centuries
there were no laws restricting abor
tion. "The Catholic Church didn't op
pose abortions until the end of the
1800 s," she said. Restrictions were
passed finally in order to protect preg
nant women due to the serious health
hazards of primitive abortions.
Because abortions in the first
trimester (the first three months of
pregnancyÂ» are now "very simple and
safe." the issue of abortion has now
become a moral and religious battle,
she said.
Bostick explained that the 1973 Su
preme Court ruling on abortions
basically said that since little health
risk is involved in first trimester abor
tions, the decision would be up to the
individual, with input from doctors,
family members and others.
Each state's power to establish its
own restrictions on abortions
progressively increases in cases of
second and third trimester pregnan

cies. Bostick said.
Though "about 90 percent of the
American public supports the 1973 de
cision," said Bostick. the decision s
validity is in danger from two direc
tions: those who want to make an
amendment to the Constitution out
lawing abortions i the so-called human
rights amendment). and those who are
trying to restrict eligibility require
ments for abortions and in general
make the process of obtaining an abor
tion difficult.
Last week the Reverend Jerry
Falwell. the leader of the con
servative religious movement Moral
Majority, said his group would "pres
sure the government" in 1981 for a hu
man rights amendment outlawing
abortions on demand. Such an amend
ment would have to be passed by both
houses of Congress and approved by
two-thirds of the state legislatures.
Bostick declared the amendment
now has a greater chance of passing in
Washington and in state legislatures
because of the gains made by con
servative candidates in this month's
election
"Before, no anti-abortion amend
ment could even get introduced in
committees because Democrats were
the heads of them." she stressed.
Another movement against abor
tion would force the elimination of
public funding of abortions. "Anti
abortion people are appealing to tax
burdened Americans to make public
funding illegal." Bostick said.
Since the Hyde Amendment (an ap
propriations bill that restricts federal
abortion funding to cases of life en
dangerment. severe and long-lasting
health damage, rape or incest) was
upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court last
summer, the battle over funding has
moved to the state level, where the
monetary responsibility of states for
funding abortion is still undecided.
"Akron laws." the name given to a
type of law originating in Akron, Ohio,
pose another threat to the Fro-Choice
movement, said Bostick Stipulations
of these laws are threefold: all women
who are considering abortions must be

mformed by a physician of what the
fetus looks like at the time of the abor
tion as well as of the physical effects
of the abortion on the fetus and the
woman; minors must have the con
sent of both parents before obtaining
an abortion, both parents of a minor
must be notified of the abortion at
least four days prior to the procedure.
Though the inform-and-consent
stipulations of these laws have been
seen by the Courts as harrassment of
minors and have thought to increase
health risks as well, Bostick said she
believes that these same criticisms
apply to the notification stipulation.
"Minors will postpone the decision
as to whether or not to have an abor
tion" because of the fear associated

with their parents finding out, said
Bostick. This increases the health risk
when the abortion is finally per
formed.
In addition, this law infringes on the
confidentiality between the patient
and the physician. Bostick stated.
Bostick said Pro-Choice alliances
will be working very hard to increase
public awareness of the human life
amendment, as well as to convince the
California Legislature that the ma
jority of people in this state oppose the
amendment.
"I think that the Fro-Choice move
ment in this area will rally against the
human life amendment. This issue
will bring out the majority of people
from our communitv," Bostick said.
