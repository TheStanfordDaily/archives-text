The Stanford community will be
able to enjoy a new intramural recrea
tion complex beginning in about Au
gust. 1981. Ground-breaking for the
new fieldhouse. to be built next to Old
Encina Gym, is scheduled for next
month.
The fieldhouse will contain a gym
with three basketball courts, an out
door play area, a classroom-office
wing, and an outdoor picnic area.
Director of Athletics Andy Geiger
said the fieldhouse is being built "to
expand recreational and intramural
facilities.
"We hope to relieve the congestion
we have now and to expand non-col
legiate programs. With the new facil
ity, intramurals will not have to be
scheduled at such bad times," said
Geiger.
While an occasional inter-collegiate
gymnastics meet or volleyball game
may be held there, the facility is in
tended primarily for recreational and
intramural use and will include facil
ities for basketball, volleyball, fenc
ing and gymnastics, Geiger added.
The building will be located behind

Old Encina Gym where intramural
volleyball courts are now and where
the old Encina pool used to be. New
volleyball courts have already been
completed in the eucalyptus grove
across Arguello Way from Encina
Gym.
Funds for the project have come en
tirelv from private donors. An
anonymous Stanford alumnus, who is
a member of the Athletic Department
advisory board, is donating the funds
for the basic external structure of the
fieldhouse.
The Stanford Athletic Department
is paying for the interior lighting,
heating and bleachers. The money for
this is coming from alumni who sup
port the Athletic Department with
large gifts.
The cost of the project is $2.15 mil
lion. The anonymous donor does not
want the cost of the fieldhouse shell to
be known.
Stanford alumni have played a ma
jor role in this project. In addition to
the shell donor, the architect and con
tractor are also Stanford alumni.
Architect Donald Crosby, of
Crosby, Thornton and Marshall As

sociates, is contributing his services
in designing the shell. He was hired by
the anonymous donor, and is also
being hired by Stanford, at a reduced
fee. to design the rest of the facility.
Contractor Allen Brown, head of the
firm Vance Brown and Sons, is also
contributing his services by reducing
his normal profit. Both Crosby and
Brown are undertaking the project at
cost.
Stanford's project manager Clif
ford Morse said the donor, architect,
and contractor have worked together
in the past and so the project has gone
very smoothly.
The facility was the brainchild of
Geiger. Morse said. A study last year
indicated the Athletic Department
had four needs: a new fieldhouse, a
new office building, refurbishing Old
Encina Gym, and refurbishing the
present Athletic Department office
building.
The anonymous donor volunteered
to sponsor the first phase.
Although the shell donor has re
quested anonymity, Morse said once
the fieldhouse is completed, it will
probably be named in his honor.
