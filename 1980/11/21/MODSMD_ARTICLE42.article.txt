The ifs have been haunting Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin all week long.
If only this were any other week. If
only this were any other sniveling 2-8
opponent. If only this were any other
game But, of course, it isn't.
This isn't any other week. It's Big
Game week, a time when his oppo
nent's school will be shaking the walls
of the Greek Theatre working up a
hate for Wiggin s Stanford Cardinals.
This isn't any other sniveling 2-8 op
ponent. Stanford has had a penchant
this season for kicking the infirmed,
for stepping on the NCAA's poor rela
tions. Stanford's 54-13 slaughter of Or
egon State was so inhumane that
Greenpeace is considering switching
its attention from baby seals to
Beavers. But this is Cal.
This is not any other game. If you
have heard it once this week, you've
heard it a thousand times. "You can
throw all the records out the window
this week, fans. This is the Big
Game."
Like the man said, cliches became
cliches because they were a good way
to describe something. And you really
can throw the record books out the
window tomorrow, fans.
The Big Game — 1947. Stanford was
winless in eight games, the Bears 8-1
and favored by 40 points. Yet the Indi
ans were ahead 18-14 with three
minutes remaining and Cal bottled up
at its own 20. Yet Jackie Jensen took a
lateral, pulled up and passed to Paul
Keckley all alone at the 35. Keckley
went the remaining 65 yards, and Cal
had a miracle 21-18 win.
The Big Game — 1970. Jim Plunkett
was leading the Indians to the Hose
Bowl, but not before a disappointing
Cal team got its last shot. They made
the most of it, winning 22-14 and sack
ing Plunkett four times in a sobering
loss for Stanford.
The Big Game — 1972. Mike White's
first season was clearly a rebuilding
one. The Bears. 2-8, hosted Hose Bowl
Champion Stanford, who was adjust
ing to a new coach (Jack Chris
tiansen) and mascot (Cardinals).
Stanford seemed to have a 21-18 win
locked up when Heggie Sanderson in
tercepted late in the game. But Cal
took over on downs with 1:13 to go and
freshman quarterback Vince Fer
ragamo led the Bears to a touchdown,
hitting Steve Sweeney in the corner of
the end zone with three seconds left.

The 1972 Big Game may have the
most relevance to tomorrow's con
test. Once again, the Bears are 2-8,
and head coach Roger Theder, in his
third year, is still sweeping out the
remnants of the Mike White regime.
Theder wants to do it his way. This
year that has meant starting 13
freshmen and sophomores.
The results have been predictable.
When the opposing team hasn't Mack
trucked the Bears, as in USC's 60-7
deluge, the Bears have beaten them
selves.
It is not something that has im
proved with time, either. It happened

m the third game of the year, when Cal
blew a 21-3 halftime lead to lose to Ari
zona 31-24. It happened last week,
when the Bears used penalties and
turnovers to lose their fourth straight
game and prevent Washington State
from blowing a 31-17 victory.
There are many Cal fans who feel
the only way the football team will im
prove is with a new head coach.
Theder is under considerable heat.
While UC-Berkeley Athletic Director

Dave Maggard has gone out on a limb
to stress that Theder deserves time,
many think he is holding a saw behind
his back. If Cal loses big tomorrow,
Maggard just might become a lumber
jack.
The importance of the game has not
been lost on Theder. "This is my 13th
Big Game." said Theder, who has
coached from both sides of the Big
Game field (he was an assistant under
Stanford head coach John Halston). "I
think maybe it is my most important

Big Game, and not from a job security
standpoint.
"We started the season with great
expectations. Many things did not hap
pen the way we wanted them to, but a
win could do things for recruiting and
for an off-season emphasis. It's impor
tant to these kids — they need a psy
chological lift," Theder added.
Wide receiver Matt Bouza, an All-
Conference candidate at the beginning
of the season, is one of the kids who

could use a lift. He will be the first to
admit it.i ll always remember last
year < when Cal turned back a last
minute Stanford rally at the Cal 1 to
win 21-14i. With our season, nothing
would be better than winning the Big
Game. It could turn it around."
Bouza is one of the few Bears who
can boast this year. The senior has
caught 41 passes, averaging 15 yards
per catch. Yet even his statistics belie
the kind of season Cal is having. Bouza
is tied for the team lead in touchdown
catches with two.
Nonetheless, it has been a trying
year for the soft-spoken Bouza. "After
Saturday's loss to Washington State. I
just felt numb.'' Bouza said. "From
week to week, we keep coming out on
bottom. You've got to know what it's
like on the bottom to know what it's
like on the top. but we gotta get the
hell out."
The Bears' misfortunes are not all
due to ineptitude. Injuries have hurt
Cal and one in particular — the liga
ment tear in Hieh Campbell's knee
suffered in the USC game — silenced
what there was of Cal's offense. Now
directing the Cal attack is J Torchio. a
sophomore who Theder hoped to
redshirt this season.
Torchio also went down with a knee
injury courtesy of the Trojans, but
stayed out for only one week. Last
week he completed 18 of 30 passes for
241 yards, and caught the respect of,
among others, Paul Wiggin.
"Torchio is not as good as
Campbell, but everyone makes out the
kid as being horrible. I think he's done
pretty good. He makes the offense go
pretty well." Wiggin said.
But, as Wiggin said, he is no
Campbell, which comes as quite a re
lief to the Stanford defense. Coupled
with Cal's absolute lack of a running
game (the team averages more than
six yards less than Darrin Nelson),
Jack Harbaugh's charges should do a
respectable job.
That leaves it to the health of the
Stanford offense. USC danced the
same waltz on Stanford's offense as
they did on Cal's. but the week off has
allowed the Cards to heal. Nelson's
ankle, twisted by the Trojan defense,
should be fully healed by tomorrow.
Ken Margerum. named All-Ameri

ea for the second consecutive year
Wednesday bv the nation's football
writers, has been fighting a virus all
week in addition to the hip pointer he
suffered against USC. However, he is
expected to start
All of which spells trouble for
Theder. "Their football team is .of
fensively unbelievable," the
beleaguered Cal coach said of John
Klwav and friends. The same inight be
said of Cal's defense, albeit with a dif
ferent connotation Though they have
given up about 10 yards less than Stan
ford. the Bears are surrendering 30
points per game.
The most suspect part of the de
fense is the backfield. which sports

one senior, two sophomores and a
treshrnan. Theder is well aware of the
problems his defense should have. "If
we can close the door once in a while it
could be a great game."
No matter what occurs on the
artificial turf at Memorial Stadium
tomorrow, it will be a great game. As
Wiggin said: "My senior year (Cal
coach) Pappy Waldorf announced an
hour before the game that this would
be his last game His team was an un
derdog but we lost. Emotion plays a
lot in this particular game."
Or. as the man said, you can throw

pretty good. He makes the offense go
pretty well." Wiggin said.

The ifs have been haunting Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin all week long.
If only this were any other week. If
only this were any other sniveling 2-8
opponent. If only this were any other
game But, of course, it isn't.
This isn't any other week. It's Big
Game week, a time when his oppo
nent's school will be shaking the walls
of the Greek Theatre working up a
hate for Wiggin s Stanford Cardinals.
This isn't any other sniveling 2-8 op
ponent. Stanford has had a penchant
this season for kicking the infirmed,
for stepping on the NCAA's poor rela
tions. Stanford's 54-13 slaughter of Or
egon State was so inhumane that
Greenpeace is considering switching
its attention from baby seals to
Beavers. But this is Cal.
This is not any other game. If you
have heard it once this week, you've
heard it a thousand times. "You can
throw all the records out the window
this week, fans. This is the Big
Game."
Like the man said, cliches became
cliches because they were a good way
to describe something. And you really
can throw the record books out the
window tomorrow, fans.
The Big Game — 1947. Stanford was
winless in eight games, the Bears 8-1
and favored by 40 points. Yet the Indi
ans were ahead 18-14 with three
minutes remaining and Cal bottled up
at its own 20. Yet Jackie Jensen took a
lateral, pulled up and passed to Paul
Keckley all alone at the 35. Keckley
went the remaining 65 yards, and Cal
had a miracle 21-18 win.
The Big Game — 1970. Jim Plunkett
was leading the Indians to the Hose
Bowl, but not before a disappointing
Cal team got its last shot. They made
the most of it, winning 22-14 and sack
ing Plunkett four times in a sobering
loss for Stanford.
The Big Game — 1972. Mike White's
first season was clearly a rebuilding
one. The Bears. 2-8, hosted Hose Bowl
Champion Stanford, who was adjust
ing to a new coach (Jack Chris
tiansen) and mascot (Cardinals).
Stanford seemed to have a 21-18 win
locked up when Heggie Sanderson in
tercepted late in the game. But Cal
took over on downs with 1:13 to go and
freshman quarterback Vince Fer
ragamo led the Bears to a touchdown,
hitting Steve Sweeney in the corner of
the end zone with three seconds left.

The 1972 Big Game may have the
most relevance to tomorrow's con
test. Once again, the Bears are 2-8,
and head coach Roger Theder, in his
third year, is still sweeping out the
remnants of the Mike White regime.
Theder wants to do it his way. This
year that has meant starting 13
freshmen and sophomores.
The results have been predictable.
When the opposing team hasn't Mack
trucked the Bears, as in USC's 60-7
deluge, the Bears have beaten them
selves.
It is not something that has im
proved with time, either. It happened

m the third game of the year, when Cal
blew a 21-3 halftime lead to lose to Ari
zona 31-24. It happened last week,
when the Bears used penalties and
turnovers to lose their fourth straight
game and prevent Washington State
from blowing a 31-17 victory.
There are many Cal fans who feel
the only way the football team will im
prove is with a new head coach.
Theder is under considerable heat.
While UC-Berkeley Athletic Director

Dave Maggard has gone out on a limb
to stress that Theder deserves time,
many think he is holding a saw behind
his back. If Cal loses big tomorrow,
Maggard just might become a lumber
jack.
The importance of the game has not
been lost on Theder. "This is my 13th
Big Game." said Theder, who has
coached from both sides of the Big
Game field (he was an assistant under
Stanford head coach John Halston). "I
think maybe it is my most important

Big Game, and not from a job security
standpoint.
"We started the season with great
expectations. Many things did not hap
pen the way we wanted them to, but a
win could do things for recruiting and
for an off-season emphasis. It's impor
tant to these kids — they need a psy
chological lift," Theder added.
Wide receiver Matt Bouza, an All-
Conference candidate at the beginning
of the season, is one of the kids who

could use a lift. He will be the first to
admit it.i ll always remember last
year < when Cal turned back a last
minute Stanford rally at the Cal 1 to
win 21-14i. With our season, nothing
would be better than winning the Big
Game. It could turn it around."
Bouza is one of the few Bears who
can boast this year. The senior has
caught 41 passes, averaging 15 yards
per catch. Yet even his statistics belie
the kind of season Cal is having. Bouza
is tied for the team lead in touchdown
catches with two.
Nonetheless, it has been a trying
year for the soft-spoken Bouza. "After
Saturday's loss to Washington State. I
just felt numb.'' Bouza said. "From
week to week, we keep coming out on
bottom. You've got to know what it's
like on the bottom to know what it's
like on the top. but we gotta get the
hell out."
The Bears' misfortunes are not all
due to ineptitude. Injuries have hurt
Cal and one in particular — the liga
ment tear in Hieh Campbell's knee
suffered in the USC game — silenced
what there was of Cal's offense. Now
directing the Cal attack is J Torchio. a
sophomore who Theder hoped to
redshirt this season.
Torchio also went down with a knee

his back. If Cal loses big tomorrow,
Maggard just might become a lumber
jack.
The importance of the game has not
been lost on Theder. "This is my 13th
Big Game." said Theder, who has
coached from both sides of the Big
Game field (he was an assistant under
Stanford head coach John Halston). "I
think maybe it is my most important

Big Game, and not from a job security
standpoint.
"We started the season with great
expectations. Many things did not hap
pen the way we wanted them to, but a
win could do things for recruiting and
for an off-season emphasis. It's impor
tant to these kids — they need a psy
chological lift," Theder added.
Wide receiver Matt Bouza, an All-
Conference candidate at the beginning
of the season, is one of the kids who

could use a lift. He will be the first to
admit it.i ll always remember last
year < when Cal turned back a last
minute Stanford rally at the Cal 1 to
win 21-14i. With our season, nothing
would be better than winning the Big
Game. It could turn it around."
Bouza is one of the few Bears who
can boast this year. The senior has
caught 41 passes, averaging 15 yards
per catch. Yet even his statistics belie
the kind of season Cal is having. Bouza
is tied for the team lead in touchdown
catches with two.
Nonetheless, it has been a trying
year for the soft-spoken Bouza. "After
Saturday's loss to Washington State. I
just felt numb.'' Bouza said. "From
week to week, we keep coming out on
bottom. You've got to know what it's
like on the bottom to know what it's
like on the top. but we gotta get the
hell out."
The Bears' misfortunes are not all
due to ineptitude. Injuries have hurt
Cal and one in particular — the liga
ment tear in Hieh Campbell's knee
suffered in the USC game — silenced
what there was of Cal's offense. Now
directing the Cal attack is J Torchio. a
sophomore who Theder hoped to
redshirt this season.
Torchio also went down with a knee
injury courtesy of the Trojans, but
stayed out for only one week. Last
week he completed 18 of 30 passes for
241 yards, and caught the respect of,
among others, Paul Wiggin.
"Torchio is not as good as
Campbell, but everyone makes out the
kid as being horrible. I think he's done
pretty good. He makes the offense go
pretty well." Wiggin said.
But, as Wiggin said, he is no
Campbell, which comes as quite a re
lief to the Stanford defense. Coupled
with Cal's absolute lack of a running
game (the team averages more than
six yards less than Darrin Nelson),
Jack Harbaugh's charges should do a
respectable job.
That leaves it to the health of the
Stanford offense. USC danced the
same waltz on Stanford's offense as
they did on Cal's. but the week off has
allowed the Cards to heal. Nelson's
ankle, twisted by the Trojan defense,
should be fully healed by tomorrow.

The ifs have been haunting Stanford
head coach Paul Wiggin all week long.
If only this were any other week. If
only this were any other sniveling 2-8
opponent. If only this were any other
game But, of course, it isn't.
This isn't any other week. It's Big
Game week, a time when his oppo
nent's school will be shaking the walls
of the Greek Theatre working up a
hate for Wiggin s Stanford Cardinals.
This isn't any other sniveling 2-8 op
ponent. Stanford has had a penchant
this season for kicking the infirmed,
for stepping on the NCAA's poor rela
tions. Stanford's 54-13 slaughter of Or
egon State was so inhumane that
Greenpeace is considering switching
its attention from baby seals to
Beavers. But this is Cal.
This is not any other game. If you
have heard it once this week, you've
heard it a thousand times. "You can
throw all the records out the window
this week, fans. This is the Big
Game."
Like the man said, cliches became
cliches because they were a good way
to describe something. And you really
can throw the record books out the
window tomorrow, fans.
The Big Game — 1947. Stanford was
winless in eight games, the Bears 8-1
and favored by 40 points. Yet the Indi
ans were ahead 18-14 with three
minutes remaining and Cal bottled up
at its own 20. Yet Jackie Jensen took a
lateral, pulled up and passed to Paul
Keckley all alone at the 35. Keckley
went the remaining 65 yards, and Cal
had a miracle 21-18 win.
The Big Game — 1970. Jim Plunkett
was leading the Indians to the Hose
Bowl, but not before a disappointing
Cal team got its last shot. They made
the most of it, winning 22-14 and sack
ing Plunkett four times in a sobering
loss for Stanford.
The Big Game — 1972. Mike White's
first season was clearly a rebuilding
one. The Bears. 2-8, hosted Hose Bowl
Champion Stanford, who was adjust
ing to a new coach (Jack Chris
tiansen) and mascot (Cardinals).
Stanford seemed to have a 21-18 win
locked up when Heggie Sanderson in
tercepted late in the game. But Cal
took over on downs with 1:13 to go and
freshman quarterback Vince Fer
ragamo led the Bears to a touchdown,
hitting Steve Sweeney in the corner of
the end zone with three seconds left.

The 1972 Big Game may have the
most relevance to tomorrow's con
test. Once again, the Bears are 2-8,
and head coach Roger Theder, in his
third year, is still sweeping out the
remnants of the Mike White regime.
Theder wants to do it his way. This
year that has meant starting 13
freshmen and sophomores.
The results have been predictable.
When the opposing team hasn't Mack
trucked the Bears, as in USC's 60-7
deluge, the Bears have beaten them
selves.
It is not something that has im
proved with time, either. It happened

m the third game of the year, when Cal
blew a 21-3 halftime lead to lose to Ari
zona 31-24. It happened last week,
when the Bears used penalties and
turnovers to lose their fourth straight
game and prevent Washington State
from blowing a 31-17 victory.
There are many Cal fans who feel
the only way the football team will im
prove is with a new head coach.
Theder is under considerable heat.
While UC-Berkeley Athletic Director

Dave Maggard has gone out on a limb
to stress that Theder deserves time,
many think he is holding a saw behind
his back. If Cal loses big tomorrow,
Maggard just might become a lumber
jack.
The importance of the game has not
been lost on Theder. "This is my 13th
Big Game." said Theder, who has
