## The 						Old Man still steps sprightly 
### 
Through personification,
one can picture the Big
Game as if it were a living,
breathing being Tomorrow
marks his 83rd birthday, yet
he continues to walk with a
sprightly step. All that crisp
autumn weather seems to
have preserved his youth.
Old Man Big Game is going
to be around for a long time.
He possesses an air of self
importance, and rightly so:
though he actually appears
only once a year, people talk
about him all the time. They
anticipate his arrival as
eagerly as they would Santa
Claus'. Indeed, on the calen
dar of local college football,
the Big Game is Christmas.

Commentary

Today, however. Old Man
Big Game wears a look of an
noyance. People always cel
ebrate his appearances with
parties, marches and song,
but hp's beginning to believe
that some of the revelry is
becoming forced. He sees
people shouting and dancing
because they ought to, not be

cause they want to. He has
inspired tradition, and now
he is trapped by it. bound per
haps forever to these planned
activity schedules: "7 30
p.m — Departure for San
Francisco for Big Game Ral
ly; 8 30 p.m — Meet at Un
ion Square; 9 p m — Rally to
the Civic Center.'' etc.
Somewhat wistfully, a lit
tle jealously, he wishes he
could be more like the UCLA
and USC games. The en
thusiasm they inspire is
spontaneous, fresh, genuine
Old Man Big Game admires
the way students found vari
ous ways of traveling to Los
Angeles, and his heart leaps
when he remembers how
those "Go Stanford
Go to Hell USC caps sud
denly sprung up on campus.
Those affairs. Old Man Big
Game thinks, are like sur
prise parties — I'm just like
Thanksgiving, where Grand
ma has to come over, and
turkey has to be served.
Regaining some of his
pride. Old Man Big Game ob
serves how most attempts to
commercialize what he

stands for have failed Rare
ly, if ever, does that med
dlesome ABC-TV get a hold
of trie, he sniffs "If they
want to come see me. let
them wait in long lines, fight,
or pay big money for a
ticket!", he exclaims aloud
He guffaws when he thinks of
the Big Game mugs that the
Bookstore tried to sell last
year — and is trying to give
away with clothing

\o other campus event provokes such a
jubilee

purchases this year. No. Old
Man Big Game hasn't turned
into a media event or a capi
talistic venture yet.
Mention the Axe to Old
Man Big Game, though, and
he'll immediately become
disgruntled. He considers it
positively ridiculous that
able-bodied young men
should spend their energies
just to gain possession of an
old, dull blade attached to a
piece of wood. What kind of
trophy is that? Those boys

deserve something better
than that piece of junk — a
keg of beer, maybe, or free
tickets to the symphony.
Nevertheless, because of
Old Man Big Game,
thousands of students are
going to troop into San Fran
cisco tonight and raise hell
Because of Old Man Big
Game, normally mild-man
nered young men will behave
like iunatics, and young

women who have never been
drunk before will be Be
cause of Old Man Big Game,
thousands will endure
Berkeley's non-existent
parking and Memorial Stadi
um's cramped seating And
because of Old Man Big
Game, many of the players
on the field will drive them
selves to the limits of their
efforts, to the heights of their
talents.
It is easy to write all that
off as "fun." because that is

certainly what it is. But it is a
special kind of fun — Old
Man Big Game s kind No
other campus event, not even
the end of finals, provokes
such a jubilee
The Big Game is the quin
tessential collegiate holiday.
Like other holidays, some of
its aspects may appear
hackneyed at times. Yet
holidays aren't celebrated
unless they are cared about.
People always end up caring
enough about Old Man Big
Game to pay him a visit.
The lack of bowl game con
sequence and the California
team's apparent debility
mean nothing That's why
tomorrow's Stanford-Cal
game has been sold out for
months. That's why many
people will have hoarse
voices by the time the final
gun sounds. That's why hun
dreds. even thousands, will
linger in Memorial Stadium
for more than an hour after
wards. listening to the bands
play, wanting to prolong the
Big Game's glory. Old Man
Big Game is as immortal as
he is old.
