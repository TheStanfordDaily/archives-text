# Paul Wiggin: a season older, a season wiser
## 
### 
(Editor's note: Paul Wiggin will
end his first regular season as
Stanford head coach tomorrow.
In his own words (and every
body else's) this Cardinal team
has had its 'ups and downs'. So
it goes.
More importantly though,
Stanford found a new leader.
The Farm adopted someone
who understands and ap
preciates the needs of a Stan
ford football team and someone
who has built a base from which
the program can grow. As corny
as all that sounds, it's true.
Stanford is back on the road.
In this Friday Interview with
Mike Oneal, Wiggin talks about
this year's team, the problems
it has had, its future and what
his first year as acollege head
coach has been like.)
Daily: What has been your ov
erall impression of this season?
Wiggin: Well, we've had highs
and lows. I think every coach
has dreams that in most cases
don't materialize quite as much
as he had hoped they would. We
put together the parts this year
and hoped some good things
would happen and some good
things did — but not as many as
we had hoped. We had hoped
that we wouldn't have four
losses at this point. We had
hoped that possibly we would be
in the Rose Bowl. We knew a lit
tle bit what our strengths were
and what our weaknesses were
before we went into the season.

Now we know a lot more about
our football team.
I think overall it's been a good
year. The relationship of
players to coaches and coaches
to players has been excellent
and the environment for football
has been excellent. From my
standpoint, it's at least proved
to me that I can relate to young
people on this level. For me it's
been a great year — it's been a
great year in my life. Even
though we didn't fulfill all of our
dreams, it's still been a good
year.
Daily: It seems as though your
transition into the head
coaching job has been extreme
ly smooth. Even though the
team does have four losses so
far. there seems to be a lot of op
timism surrounding this team.
Does that surprise you ?
Wiggin: Yeah, I think there is a
positive feeling. 1 think the
whole athletic department has
done a great job of putting to
gether a staff that works well
with young people. 1 like being
around them, and if I like them,
the players probably will. I
think there's a feeling among
our players that they're in a
very positive environment. As
the players and coaches get to
know each other better. 1 think
some good things are going to
happen.
It's not easy because you're
dealing with a high level of
academics and the highest form

of athletics. When you put those
two together, it's not an easy
package. Then you add a third
element — the Stanford life
style, which is one of freedom.
We don't believe in blind obe
dience.
I think the kind of people we
have on our staff and the young
people we have that relate to
that staff and the overall goals
of the athletic program as set by
(Athletic Director) Andy
Geiger, are all blending toward
some positive things happening
here.
Daily: So do you feel solidly a
part of Stanford now?
Wiggin: I do because I went to
school here. They even still have
a picture or two around here of
me. I love this place. I didn't
have to generate anything for
this new experience — I've
always had that.
Daily: Where will Stanford
football be two or three years
down the road?
Wiggin: I see this recruiting
year telling me a lot about
where we are and what our situ
ation is. because then I will have
completed one full cycle here. I
haven't been here a full year
yet. I've noticed that recruiting
is one of the most important
things about football at Stan
ford's level. I don't care who you
are. if you don't have a good
team, you're not going to have
success. There are a lot of good
coaches who have bad teams

that can't win I really believe
that.
So. the first thing we have to
do is build a good team (through
recruiting) and secondly we have
to build up the players we have
develop in them better foot
ball qualities. There's a lot of
things in front of us. but we'll be
a better football team next year.
Daily: Did the problems with
the defense this season surprise
you ?
Wiggin: Well, you always hope
for better. The defense, if you
look at the statistics, was the
part (of the team* we were dis
appointed in. Again, it was a
problem of personnel. I think
our coaches did an outstanding
job of coaching and preparing
they put together the parts.
But defense is a difficult
thing. Some people think that if
someone like < Defensive Coor
dinator) Jack Harbaugh just
walks in the defense is going to
get better. It doesn't just hap
pen. Defense adjusts to what
other people do. I think people
misunderstand that. Offense is
dealing. You deal on offense.
You say "This is what we're
going to do. You stop us. " On of
fense you're in the driver's seat.
Sometimes when you're playing
a team with great people like
USC. they deal on defense But
from our standpoint, we try to
deal on offense.
Because of the magnitude of
the kind of student-athlete we

have here, we can deal pretty
well. We've got a great concept
and when things are going right,
we can put a team in a kind of
Catch-22 — a damned if you do,
damned if you don't situation. A
defense doesn't do that.
Daily: What does this year's
ttili (lame mean to you ?
Wiggin: It means a lot to me. It
means a lot to this season But
particularly, in my situation, it
means a lot. My Dad went to Cal
so 1 knew the magnitude of the
game when 1 was a kid. Then
when 1 grew up 1 missed the turn
or something and went to Stan
ford — which was a great move
for me. 1 got the opportunity to
play in the game and to feel
what it really meant.
it's more than just a game. It
has to do with two great institu
tions representing themselves
on the athletic field. It goes
farther than just a football
game. When you look at it on the
spectrum of what this whole uni
versity life is all about, it's just
a little piece. But on a given day.
it's very meaningful. I had the
opportunity as a player and now
as a coach. I'm looking forward
to it.
