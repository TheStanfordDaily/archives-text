# Big Guest Greek for Big Game
## 
### 
Editors' note: Since the Big
(lame is the top event of the
football season, it is only fitting
that the Daily seek out the Uni
versity's top man to be this
week s (luest Greek.
Donald Kennedy is as athlet
ic as anybody that is mentioned
on our sports pages. When at
Harvard. Kennedy partici
pated in and coached skiing.
His enthusiasm for jogging and
volleyball have been
documented. And today, Stan
ford's president crowns his
sporting career by wearing the
honored mantle of Guest Greek
of the Week. Kennedy's in
cisive, witty comments on
tomorrow's Pacific-10 Con

ference games follow:
Washington at Washington
State: Logical upset prospect in
view of locale, explosive WSU
offense, possible UW letdown
from last week. But Huskies
hold on to win conference out
right. prove that Virtue can be
more than merely its own re
ward.
Arizona at Oregon State: The
Beavers deserve better, but Ari
zona last week revealed an un
expected penchant for sadism
that is likely to carry over. Up
set possibility here is that the
game might not be held due to
lack of interest.
Oregon at Arizona State: The
week's mild surprise gives

Eugene sportswriter A 1 Liter
ation his all-time best headline
opportunity: "Devils Dump De
hydrated Ducks in Desert".
USC at UCLA: The
scoreboard is forgotten as the
southland sportsmen vent their
frustration on one another in a
matchup only an orthopedist
could love. At game's end, A 1
Davis saves a year's worth of le
gal fees by giving the survivors
silver and black jerseys in a
brief ceremony at midfield.
Stanford at California: A fine
day for the seniors: both Kens
extend their records, the de
fense shines, and the Axe comes
back home.
