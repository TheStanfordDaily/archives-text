# This game's a personal vendetta
## 
### Sally Jenkins 
This time it's strictly person
al The Stanford water polo
team will try and defeat UC-
Berkeley at the Bears' Harmon
pool for only the second time in
ten years tomorrow morning at
10:30 a.m.
The Cardinals captured the
Facific-10 Conference cham
pionship and the No. 1 seed in
the NCAA championships when
they embarrassed Cal last week
10-5 at deGuerre pool. Thus,
both sides have a revenge
motive tomorrow: Stanford for
losing eight of the last nine at
Harmon pool, and Cal for last
week's one-sided loss.

Water polo

It has become a personal ven
detta.
"We are going over there to
win this game." Cardinal coach
Dante Dettamanti said "We
were in the exact same situation

position two years ago We
didn't have to win the game be
cause we had beaten them twice
earlier in the season, and we fig
ured we would play them in the
nationals the following week
We decided to go over there not
worrying about it. If we won
fine, but we were saving up for
nationals."
Cal won that game, however,
the only blemish on 1978 na
tional champion Stanford s oth
erwise perfect record. Det
tarnanti is looking at this year's
game differently.
' This year we don't know if
we will face Cal in the finals,''
Dettamanti said. "We are going
over there with the attitude that
we can beat them at that pool."
Stanford has a hard time win
ning at Berkeley because the
Bears' pool is only 25 yards
long; a regulation-sized pool is
30 meters long. The smaller
sized pool could inhibit the
Cardinals' primary weapon.

Stanford's counterattack has
been good for at least three
goals per game this season In a
contest that usually is decided
by one goal, such a disadvan
tage could be crucial
However, Dettamanti thinks
the disadvantage might be
turned around to Stanford s fa
vor.
It could be an advantage for
us because we have (three-time
All-America John i Gansel in the
goal on defense and a great of
fense The problem will be the
little things, like learning how to
play the pool in terms of posi
tioning." Dettamanti said
In order to better prepare the
team for the contest Dettamanti
has worked them out in the
smaller of the deGuerre pools
for the last two days of practice
The problem lies in the danger
of preparing the team so well
tor Cal that it might have trou
ble readjusting to a regulation
pool by the time of the NCAA's

'over Thanksgiving
We don't want to spend so
much time in the small pool that
our game changes." the coach
said. When you play 26 games
in a regulation-sized pool you
acquire certain ingrained
playing habits. They are hard to
break You almost have to re
train yourself But the team has
adjusted well I think."
The game could have even
more personal significance for
the Cardinals than last week's
victory, because this is the last
season Cal will play in the 25-
vard pool; the school plans to
enlarge it. Winning the last
game at Harmon pool would be
oh so sweet.
Dettamanti predicted that
should Stanford win. it will be a
one-goal margin. But he added
with laugh. "I guess beating
them there by one goal and beat
ing them here by five is about
the same thing."

game differently.
' This year we don't know if
we will face Cal in the finals,''
Dettamanti said. "We are going
over there with the attitude that
we can beat them at that pool."
Stanford has a hard time win
ning at Berkeley because the
Bears' pool is only 25 yards
long; a regulation-sized pool is
30 meters long. The smaller
sized pool could inhibit the
Cardinals' primary weapon.

Stanford's counterattack has
been good for at least three
goals per game this season In a
contest that usually is decided
by one goal, such a disadvan
tage could be crucial
However, Dettamanti thinks
the disadvantage might be
turned around to Stanford s fa
vor.
It could be an advantage for
us because we have (three-time
All-America John i Gansel in the
goal on defense and a great of
fense The problem will be the
little things, like learning how to
play the pool in terms of posi
tioning." Dettamanti said
In order to better prepare the
team for the contest Dettamanti
has worked them out in the
smaller of the deGuerre pools
for the last two days of practice
The problem lies in the danger
of preparing the team so well
tor Cal that it might have trou
ble readjusting to a regulation
pool by the time of the NCAA's

'over Thanksgiving
We don't want to spend so
much time in the small pool that
our game changes." the coach
said. When you play 26 games
in a regulation-sized pool you
acquire certain ingrained
playing habits. They are hard to
break You almost have to re
train yourself But the team has
adjusted well I think."
The game could have even
more personal significance for
the Cardinals than last week's
victory, because this is the last
season Cal will play in the 25-
vard pool; the school plans to
enlarge it. Winning the last
game at Harmon pool would be
oh so sweet.
Dettamanti predicted that
should Stanford win. it will be a
one-goal margin. But he added
with laugh. "I guess beating
them there by one goal and beat
ing them here by five is about
the same thing."
