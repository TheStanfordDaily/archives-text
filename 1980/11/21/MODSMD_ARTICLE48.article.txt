# Leonard alters plan for Duran
##

New Orleans (AP) — Good
fighters learn by experience. So
what did Koberto Duran and
Sugar Ray Leonard learn about
one another in Montreal that
will help them in their rematch
for the World Boxing Council
welterweight championship
Tuesday night in the Super
dome?
Duran, who won the title on a
close but unanimous decision
June 20. is cagy when asked.
"I learned a lot," said the
Panamanian Wednesday. "I'll
show you at the fight."
As for what Leonard learned
that might be useful in the re
match. Duran said, "I don't
think he can do anything more
than he did in the first fight. If
he does anything more, I'll be
ready for it.
' There have not been any
drastic changes," Leonard said
of battle plans. "I just found out
I have a left jab* I'll just pace
myself more carefully this
time."
• ' The left hand will be in play
this time," said Angelo Dundee,
who trains Leonard. Dundee and

Janks Morton, another Leonard
aide, feel Leonard didn't jab and
move enough in the first fight
and that he shouldn't have tried
to fight it out in the early rounds
when Duran gained his winning
edge.
We're going to fight him. but
this time later on when Kay has
taken the steam out of Duran,"
said Dundee.
Freddy Brown, who helps
train Duran, doesn't think it
matters what strategy Leonard
employs. "Duran will fight the
other guy's fight," said Brown.
When Duran walks into the
ring, he's the boss."
Ray Arcel. another of
Duran's strategists, feels the
first fight might have left a scar
on Leonard. "It affected
Leonard mentally,'' sad Arcel.
"It took all the guts out of him.
It's a boy in against a man."
"The 15 rounds with Duran is
all he needed,'' said Dundee.
"He knows Duran now. He's
seen Duran. Duran doesn't
punch a lot . . . two-punch com
binations and everything else is
a foul. He does everthing in

there."
Morton chimed in that
Leonard "learned he butts a lot.
He learned he holds a lot. That's
the main thing. He learned he
uses his head more than he
punches."
The Leonard camp was not
happy with referee Carlos
Padilla in Montreal, claiming
he let Duran maul and wouldn't
separate the fighters. There
also was disatisfaction over the
judging. One judge scored 10
even rounds and the other two
called five rounds and four
rounds even, respectively.
"I'm not concerned about the
referee or the judges," said
Leonard. "My main concern is
Sugar Kay Leonard. I have to
make the results happen."
The referee and three judges
will be appointed by the WBC
and announced at fighttime.
"I'm here to fight and to de
fend the championship, and this
time Mr. Leonard is going to
kiss the floor of the ring." said
Duran. "I want a referee who
knows how to count from one to
10."
