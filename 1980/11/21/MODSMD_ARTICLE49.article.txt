third place in the 100- and 200-
meter backstroke
Olympian Linda Jezek paced

the team with four victories.
She won the 100- and 400-meter
individual medleys and the 100-

"first major opponent" for the

Cards, according to women's

And Dietze was happy with
the team's performance. "I am
extremely pleased with our
sprint events," he said. Dietze
praised the 50-meter per

won the event in 24.00 seconds, a
time which qualifies her for the
AIAW national championships.

performances by Patty Spees.

Jones and Traci Stewart, who
finished one-two in both the one
meter and three-meter events,
accounting for 16 of the team's

Dietze emphasized, however,
that the Cards' victory was a
team effort. "We were not de
pending on any one person," the
coach said. He was also pleased
with the fact that this was the
first meet in which every team
member swam, as well as the
results of the team's hard train
ing both in the weight room and
in the pool.
