Increasing graduate enrollment,
specifically in Ph.D. programs, and
better efforts at recruitment were the
primary priorities mentioned by Pres
ident Donald Kennedy in a speech de
livered to the black community yes
terday.
Speaking to a crowd of about 100 in
Tresidder, Kennedy provided a his
torical perspective on Stanford's af
firmative action record, charting
numbers of graduate admissions as
compared with eventual enrollment,
minority faculty appointments and
the proportion of minorities among
senior staff members.
"There was a quick rise with con
spicuously high numbers in the
mid-'7os and there's been a plateau
since then," Kennedy said. However,
he assured the audience that Stan
ford's record for minority representa
tion is "equal to or greater than" oth
er campuses, citing Harvard, Yale,
University of Chicago and the Univer
sity of California system as specific
examples.
Kennedy added that other campus's
statistics are often aggregated, with
one figure representing the total mi
nority population, so that bottom line
figures for specific minority popu
lations are unclear. "To track our
progress in our affirmative action
planning, we must disaggregate,'' he
said, in order to ascertain trends for
each minority group.
Proper interpretation of af
firmative action progress, Kennedy
said, requires comparisons of both the
number of minority students that are
admitted to the University and the

number that eventually enroll.
He cited discrepancies in admit
tance enrollment ratios in the medi
cal and law schools. Admissions of mi
nority applicants to the law school
have risen from 23 to 41 in the last
three years, with the number of stu
dents who enrolled rising from 6 to 20.
However, while medical school ad
missions rose from 12 to 23 over the
last three years, actual enrollments
have decreased from 9 to
Kennedy emphasized that re
cruitment methods must be improved
to assure increased enrollment of mi
nority students, especially given the
competition that exists between Stan
ford and other universities competing
for the same qualified candidates.
Kennedy said low enrollment in doc
toral programs is another problem,
and that it must be analyzed separate
ly from enrollments in professional
schools.
"Blacks that prove especially
capable in biology and who can choose
between medical school, where they
can eventually go into private prac
tice. and a research or Ph.D. pro
gram, tend to choose in the direction
of professional activities." Kennedy
said
He attributed this movement away
from the pursuit of academically-ori
ented disciplines to the lack of current
role models in the University environ
ment who are choosing academic ca
reers. It is a "vicious cycle," said
Kennedy, that can only be arrested by
more successful recruitment efforts.
In examining the numbers of minor
ity staff members in senior positions.
Kennedy said he is committed to in
creased consideration of outside can

didates and a greater effort at promot
ing young minority staff members.
"There are not enough Hispanic or
black people in senior positions," he
declared. "We have to improve the
impression for outsiders that there's
room at the top."
Additionally. Kennedy mentioned
the action being taken by the Commit
tee on Committees toward the crea
tion of a permanent Affirmative Ac
tion Committee.
In addition to pure numerical
statistic improvement. Kennedy cited
increased "mutual understanding" as
a goal of his administration.
"We must combine together to in
fluence attitudes so that our institu
tional objectives are met." he said.
"All of us profit from having the plu

ralism of American society repre
sented in the institution where we seek
higher education."
Kennedy alluded to conversations
he has had with students that resulted
in an impression of "uncomfortable
ness" when discussing minority is
sues. He said he believes that feeling
needs to be confronted. "There is an
inadequacy with mere tolerance. Sim
ply coexisting isn't enough," he said.
In responding to questions about the
demography of the black population
here, specifically regarding alleged
increases in admissions of upper or
middle class blacks from pre
dominantly white environments, Ken
nedy asked for specific evidence and
promised to investigate admissions
policies.

Kennedy, that can only be arrested by
more successful recruitment efforts.
In examining the numbers of minor
ity staff members in senior positions.
Kennedy said he is committed to in
creased consideration of outside can

didates and a greater effort at promot
ing young minority staff members.
"There are not enough Hispanic or
black people in senior positions," he
declared. "We have to improve the
impression for outsiders that there's
room at the top."
Additionally. Kennedy mentioned
the action being taken by the Commit
tee on Committees toward the crea
tion of a permanent Affirmative Ac
tion Committee.
In addition to pure numerical
statistic improvement. Kennedy cited
increased "mutual understanding" as
a goal of his administration.
"We must combine together to in
fluence attitudes so that our institu
tional objectives are met." he said.
"All of us profit from having the plu

ralism of American society repre
sented in the institution where we seek
higher education."
Kennedy alluded to conversations
he has had with students that resulted
in an impression of "uncomfortable
ness" when discussing minority is
sues. He said he believes that feeling
needs to be confronted. "There is an
inadequacy with mere tolerance. Sim
ply coexisting isn't enough," he said.
In responding to questions about the
demography of the black population
here, specifically regarding alleged
increases in admissions of upper or
middle class blacks from pre
dominantly white environments, Ken
nedy asked for specific evidence and
promised to investigate admissions
policies.
Increasing graduate enrollment,
specifically in Ph.D. programs, and
better efforts at recruitment were the
primary priorities mentioned by Pres
ident Donald Kennedy in a speech de
livered to the black community yes
terday.
Speaking to a crowd of about 100 in
Tresidder, Kennedy provided a his
torical perspective on Stanford's af
firmative action record, charting
numbers of graduate admissions as
compared with eventual enrollment,
minority faculty appointments and
the proportion of minorities among
senior staff members.
"There was a quick rise with con
spicuously high numbers in the
mid-'7os and there's been a plateau
since then," Kennedy said. However,
he assured the audience that Stan
ford's record for minority representa
tion is "equal to or greater than" oth
er campuses, citing Harvard, Yale,
University of Chicago and the Univer
sity of California system as specific
examples.
Kennedy added that other campus's
statistics are often aggregated, with
one figure representing the total mi
nority population, so that bottom line
figures for specific minority popu
lations are unclear. "To track our
progress in our affirmative action
planning, we must disaggregate,'' he
said, in order to ascertain trends for
each minority group.
Proper interpretation of af
firmative action progress, Kennedy
said, requires comparisons of both the
number of minority students that are
admitted to the University and the

number that eventually enroll.
He cited discrepancies in admit
tance enrollment ratios in the medi
cal and law schools. Admissions of mi
nority applicants to the law school
have risen from 23 to 41 in the last
three years, with the number of stu
dents who enrolled rising from 6 to 20.
However, while medical school ad
missions rose from 12 to 23 over the
last three years, actual enrollments
have decreased from 9 to
Kennedy emphasized that re
cruitment methods must be improved
to assure increased enrollment of mi
nority students, especially given the
competition that exists between Stan
ford and other universities competing
for the same qualified candidates.
Kennedy said low enrollment in doc
toral programs is another problem,
and that it must be analyzed separate
ly from enrollments in professional
schools.
"Blacks that prove especially
capable in biology and who can choose
between medical school, where they
can eventually go into private prac
tice. and a research or Ph.D. pro
gram, tend to choose in the direction
of professional activities." Kennedy
said
He attributed this movement away
from the pursuit of academically-ori
ented disciplines to the lack of current
role models in the University environ
ment who are choosing academic ca
reers. It is a "vicious cycle," said
Kennedy, that can only be arrested by
