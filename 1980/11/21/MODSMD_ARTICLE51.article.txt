is "an escape . . . from de

delight in tackling such "baggy

Polhemus suggests the
meaning of the arresting, if
somewhat puzzling, title of
his latest critical study.
Comic Eaith. Polhemus'
thesis is that a connection ex
ists between the "comic in
tentions" of writers from
Austen to Joyce and what are
usually termed "religious
concerns."
While the great social up
heavals of the nineteenth
century made it
progressively more difficult
to accept Orthodox Chris

thought of as •religious. - '
such as providing hope, ex
orcising guilt, and encourag
ing people to accept their
often miserable fates.
The corollarv to this thesis

is equally important: after
1800. Polhemus asserts, com
ic fiction with its "built in
feminist bias" became a
means of exploring previous
ly unexplored territory:
women's individuality and
the possibility of self-de
velopment
Despite its impressive
scholarship. Comic Faith is
never ponderous, tenden
tious. or dull. Polhemus'
prose is energetic: he takes a
commendably childlike de
light in tackling such "baggy
monsters" of English fiction
as Vanitx Fair and Martin

and traditional way of view
ing them Never adopting a
timid or self-protective ap
proach. Polhemus argues so
forcefully — even while em
ploying a prose style which
bristles with fun — that the
most skeptical reader will be
hooked
Beginning with his ex
ploration of Jane Austen's
Emma, Polhemus states
that the novel reflects
Austen's ambivalence be
tween "her urge to be tunny
and her will to uphold moral
orthodoxy At once sympa
thetic and ridiculous. Emma
belongs to a comic tradition
whose forbearers include the
Wife of Bath. Rosalind, and
Millamant. Although argu
ing that Emma celebrates
■ 'self-fulfillment.'"
Polhemus' discussion of the
ending — Emma's marriage
to the frustratinglv wise and
noble Knightley — may
strike the reader as wistful
or overly optimistic.
Polhemus' interpretation
of Vanity Eair is probably
the most provocative
chapter of the book. In "The
Comedy of Shifting Per
spectives,'' Polhemus takes
on the nineteenth century's
Scarlett O'Hara, Becky
Sharp, and convincingly par
allels certain aspects of her
iconoclastic behavior with

that of another social climb

her as wearing a three-cor

Discussing Trollope's
Barchester Towers, a novel
which features a collection
of clerics, occasional doc

such as "Who will be the next

the essence of the communi

in the novel, as he christens
Barchester a 'Church of

their connection with the

deadpans that they would be
