Even Kichard Brautigan
can't get away with breaking
rules all the time. True to his

anti-literary tradition,
Brautigan has contrived a plot
less novel, but the deliberate vi
olation of conventions of fiction
in The Tokyo-Montana Express
doesn't always work.
Brautigan says: "Though the
Tokyo-Montana Express moves
at a great speed, there are many
stops along the way. This book is
those brief stations: some confi
dent, others still searching for
their identities."
It turns out that the book is a
collection of short pieces dis
coursing on topics ranging from
umbrellas to Groucho Marx to
the men on Death How in San
Quentin. There is clearly no
sense of travelling from Tokyo
to Montana or vice versa, but
rather a random assortment of
encounters, humorous anec
dotes, "a series of flea-like ag- >"
gravations and pimple disap
pointments," and occasionally
a moving and effective vignette.
"Another Texas Ghost
Story," for example, effectively
manages to compress 40 years

of life into a few pages and
leaves a haunting image be
hind: "Contents for Good Luck"
achieves a kind of Jungian quali
ty as it traces the feelings of a
husband toward his unfaithful
wife back to primitive man;
"The Closest i Have Been to the
Sea Since Evolution." "Um
brellas," "Marching in the Op
posite Direction of a Pizza,"
and "Rubber Bands' 1 ' are all
variations of Brautigan's play
ful irreverence.
Still, there are moments of
pretentiousness — when
Brautigan says "1 am also the
only person who ever thought of
this," and times when
Brautigan's self-indulgence
tangles in obsessions that be
come quickly annoying.

Groucho Marx pops up re
peatedly. for instance, but nev
er makes a lasting impression
Perhaps the most distinctive
feature of Brautigan s writing is
his eccentric use of metaphor,
his attempt to intermingle the
real with the fantastic until they
are indivisible. Although his im
ages are often bizarre, they usu
ally work:
"... it smelled like a sinking
dead lazy doughnut about the
size of a moving van . . . "
" . My dreams were shak
ing like a pair of false teeth in an
old-folks home during an earth
quake."
"The eels swam in circles like
science-fiction children of
spaghetti."
And then of course, there are

the images that almost work "1
just stand there as peaceful as a
banana ..."
Brautigan is highly suc
cessful with his descriptions of
hangovers, whether in a brief
but clever image — "1 woke up
alone in bed with a classic hang
over like feeding time in an ant
eater grotto and you're it.
buster." or when he discusses
one at length, as in "Hangover
as Folk Art "
"The folk art took the shapes
of badly carved, smelly little
dolls, undesirable tainted
trinkets constructed from rusty
beer cans and coal, paintings of
alligator shit on swmap bark,
and of course, last but not least,
colorful native shirts woven out
of the underwear removed from

corpses by albino grave robbers
who can only rob graves on full
moon nights . . . "
While Bruatigan poems are
often surprisingly intimate rev
elations of himself, this book
seems less personal "The Tin
this book is the voice of the sta
tions along the tracks of the To
kvo-Montana Express,"
Hrautigan says Only intermit
tently do some autobiographical
undertones appear: twice he re
fers to being rruddle-aged. one
piece is called "Self Portrait as
an Old Man ' and at one point he
writes:
"Sometimes when I finish
writing something, perhaps
even this. 1 feel as if I am hand
ing out useless handbills. . .
It is almost ironic: the
haphazard eccentricities of
Brautigan's style lend him a pe
culiar eloquence, but at the
same time, randomness and in
consistency undermine the ov
erall effectiveness of his work
The Tokyo-Montana Express
offers readers a bumpy and un

even ride — many of the stops
are sudden, brief, and for
gettable. gone as soon as the
page is turned
Ultimately, the book is proba
bly best read as though it were a
collection of poems; glance
over the route of the Tokyo-
Montana Kxpress. pick your
own timetable, and take a ride
to the places that appeal to your
imagination
