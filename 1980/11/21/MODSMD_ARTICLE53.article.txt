Where would you invest
$97,000 of someone else's mon
ey'' That's what the 11 under
graduate members of the
Charles R Blyth Fund dis
cussed at their meeting last
Tuesday evening
The fund presented Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
with a check for $4108.29. to be
used for scholarships from the
fund's recent gains
According to Ahmed Sami.
chairman of the fund, two years
ago Charles Blyth set up a fund
containing $75,000 for Stanford
students to invest He says the
money made on the investments
is divided as follows 50 percent
to the expense fund. 25 percent
for University scholarships, and
the remaining 25 percent re
turns to the fund A similar fund
was started at Occidental Col

lege four years ago Stanford
has quickly taken the lead, and
now has $97,000. compared to
Occidental's $91,000
The undergraduates who
manage the fund decide how
much of the money to invest in
bonds, stocks, and other areas,
according to Sami Most of the
fund i $80.0001 is in a ready as
sets trust account, which earns
interest without risk of loss. The
remainder of the money is in
stocks, bonds, and other items
which may lose money, but so
far, have been doing very well
for the fund, says Sami Most of
the investments have been con
servative. and at no time have
the undergraduates been confi
dent enough in any one stock to
invest a large sum, such as
$20,000, commented Sami
The fund raisers' strategy at

the moment is to purchase
stocks in high technology and
natural resources firms, rang
ing from electronics firms to oil
refineries.
Recently, the 11 members
have broken into "option
groups.'' each responsible for
certain investments "it is
much easier to get a few people
together on an hour's notice
than all 11." said Sami. This has
produced some friendly com
petition among the groups in ad
dition to permitting quick de
cisions. which often can mean
hundreds or thousands of dollars
worth of difference, he said
Fund members are chosen
through a careful process, and
are limited to two years A
sense of responsibility and hon
or are more important than in
vestment backgrounds, accord
ing to Margaret Ann Fuller, as
sistant dean of student affairs,
who interviewed every one of
the current members during the
selection process. Last year, ac
cording to Fidler, there were six
positions filled from the over 60
applicants.the other five were
filled by old members. Fidler
added that a strong interest, a
willingness to make a 3-10 hour a
week commitment, and leader
ship skills are important. A bal
ance of ethnic groups and ma
jors is also sought, according to
Fidler.
