# Designer jeans ads stir up controversy
## 
### Los Angeles Tunes 
Jeans manufacturers are
quickly discovering that ad
vertising is not kid stuff.
Their numerous TV com
mercials featuring children
in sexually suggestive
dialogue and motions have
stirred so much controversy
that some manufacturers
have changed or even
withdrawn their advertise
ments.
Some have done so volun
tarily. Others did so at the
suggestion of the Children's
Advertising Review I'nit of
the National Advertising
Division of the Council of
Better Business Bureaus.
Kathleen McGowan. direc
tor of the New York-based
unit, said more than 100 con
sumer complaints about the
ads — "which is a lot for our
unit" — have been received
during the past three to four
months.
"We're trying to eliminate
or get off the air those ads
that are most controversial.
A lot of them < jean manufac
turers! have cleaned up their
act." she said.
Jordache Enterprises
Inc.. is one example. It
withdrew a print advertise
ment showing a girl straddl
ing the back of a boy — an im
itation of its adult version ad
— after it appeared only once
in a special fashion supple

ment in The New York
Times
Joseph Nakash. president,
said the company did not
receive any complaints
about the ad. but it was de
emed "too controversial' by
those within the organiza
tion Jordache's new print ad
features five or six young
sters in more childlike poses.
However, the manufac
turer is still using a TV com
mercial showing children in
a disco ogling each other,
which has drawn criticism
from consumers.
But Jet Set Jeans Inc. of
New York, which manufac
tures Goldiggers brand
jeans, pulled its original TV
commercials showing chil
dren dancing in a soda foun
tain after receiving "a half a
dozen phone calls." says
President Charles Mamiye.
He says the commercial
was intended as a satire on
the explosion in adult jean
commercials " But as a con
servative. 25-year-old manu
facturer of children's wear.
Mamiye said that when the
firm realized the com
mercial was being misun
derstood. "we immediately
changed it. Had we been an
adult-wear manufacturer
with kids on the sideline, we
might have been less sensi
tive."
