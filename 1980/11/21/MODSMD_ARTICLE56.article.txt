The 1979-1980 Alumni Fund Drive raised $8,057,000.
more money than ever before. According to Dave
Fulton, director of development. 35.062 alumni gave
gifts to the University ranging from an average gift of
$222 to "special gifts" of $10,000 to $25,000: to "major
gifts" of $25,000 to $500,000; and finally, "principal
gifts" of over $500,000.
Of all alumni. 26 percent donated to the fund. Accord
ing to Fulton, this proves "the old truism that 90
percent of the money comes from about 10 percent of
the people." In comparison, about 60 percent of
Dartmouth's alumni give to their fund, "which gives us
something to work for," he said.
The office has nothing to complain about, though, for
the sum of their efforts came to a grand total of
$60,132,000 in gifts to the University. According to
Fulton, corporations gave $10.9 million to the school,
foundations gave $16.15 million, and associations gave
$2.9 million. The amount received from bequests came
to $7.06 million.
An interesting point about bequests is that some
times the donors have no connection with Stanford, said
Fulton, "they just think it's a neat school."
What are the plans for the money raised in the drive?
The larger gifts, for instance the "major." "special,"
and principal" gifts, are usually designated for a spe-

cific purpose.
Unrestricted funds will be spent at the adminis
tration's discretion on faculty salaries, scholarships,
and major priority objectives such as "the music build
ing and Cardiovascular Research Center," according
to Fulton.
The Alumni Fund Drive is not a one-time shot for
money. According to Fulton, the drive is a continuing
process that runs throughout the fiscal year < beginning
Sept. 1) and is divided into programs that end at dif
ferent times.
These programs include the general appeal program
iconducted by mail and telephone), the personal solic
itation program (conducted on a one-on-one basis —
Fulton said that this program is the most successful),
reunion giving (asking classes to give a special reunion
gift), student development (which appeals to students
currently enrolled) and parents.
Some programs are geared to particular schools: the
business, engineering, earth sciences, medical, and
law schools. The School of Humanities and Sciences
falls into the class fund. There are also two athletic
funds — the Bucks and the Cardinals.
The Office of Development, consists of about 65 pro
fessionals. including people from the various schools.
Unlike some universities such as Cornell or Yale, which
have regional fundraising offices all over the country.

Stanford's of fice is centered here.
The office is continually looking for means of im
proving its fund-raising methods. Fulton, along with
.John Hays, director of the Annual Fund and approx
imately six others, attended a "conference of fun
draisers" this fall at Dartmouth, where represent
atives from the Ivy League schools. MIT and Stanford
met to discuss fundraising techniques and mutual prob
lems. According to Fulton, "the most valuable part of
the conference, 1 felt, was talking informally in the
halls after the organized meetings."
The Wall Street ■Journal published an article last
year on the extreme lengths to which Yale fundraising
researchers supposedly go to find possible donors, up to
and including digging into autopsy reports and living
arrangements. How does this report relate to Stan
ford's methods of research? "It doesn't," Fulton stated
flatly. "We know the characteristics of our donors" as
a whole, he said, but the office does not delve into per
sonal records.
Instead, researchers here refer to books such as
"Who's Who. to find available public information;
they also check on proxy statements to find facts con
cerning the salaries of top corporate officers who are
possible donors.
