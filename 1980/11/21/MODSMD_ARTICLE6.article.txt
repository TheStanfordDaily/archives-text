## 
### Gale Warner 
As part of his plan to improve Stanford's undergraduate
programs. President Donald Kennedy has created the
Cabinet on Undergraduate Education.
The cabinet, made up of administration, faculty, and
student representatives, will meet monthly to discuss var
ious undergraduate concerns
"It's something I saw a need for," said Kennedy The
group, he explained, is composed of the people who have
"operational responsibility" for undergraduate educa
tion. and as such are already involved in making policy de
cisions that affect undergraduates.
"Its function will be to compare direct experiences and
get problems to the surface quickly," Kennedy said.
Herant Katchadourian. vice-provost and dean of under
graduate studies, will help set the agenda for the group.
Acting Provost Albert Hastorf will chair any meetings
that Kennedy cannot attend.
Faculty and administration members of the Cabinet
will include: Fred Hargadon. dean of admissions; Sally
Mahoney. associate provost and registrar; James Lyons,
dean of student affairs; Prof. Carolyn Lougee. head of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies; Prof. Halsey
Hoyden, dean of humanities and sciences; Prof. William

Kays, dean of engineering; and Prof. Allen Cox, dean of
earth sciences. ASSU senate chair Doug Mitchell and a
representative from the Council of Presidents will fill the
student positions on the cabinet.
A group of similar makeup has met informally, accord
ing to Mahoney, since Kennedy became provost. "It gives
him a handle on what's going on among the various under
graduate programs," Mahoney said. "The question asked
is. are the programs conflicting or are they working to
gether to meet long-range goals."
"I'm excited about the idea of a cabinet," said Mitchell.
"I hope to keep the group in touch with student priorities,
such as housing, financial aid. and Tresidder, which aren't
necessarily faculty and staf priorities."
Mitchell remarked that the Kennedy administration
seems very interested in gathering student opinion
"My impression is that Kennedy is very open and wants
to stay close to the students," he said.
Kennedy mentioned residential education and the ef
fects of housing and the housing draw on students as two
topics the cabinet may discuss.
"I have great hopes for it,"he said.
Asked if anything similar exists at Harvard or other
prestigious universities. Kennedy said he didn't know, but
would be "a little surprised" if it did.
