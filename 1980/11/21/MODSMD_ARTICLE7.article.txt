# Menlo Park city council limits house occupancy
## 
### Monika Guttman 
The Menlo Park City Council passed
an ordinance Tuesday night requiring
groups of unrelated people sharing a
single-family home in Menlo Park to
file for a permit before they move into
the house.
The new ordinance appends a ten
year-old city law which had prohibited
more than three unrelated adults from
sharing a home.
Last May the state Supreme Court
determined that a Santa Barbara law
similar to the old Menlo Park law was

unconstitutional. The court ruled that
city laws may not arbitrarily restrict
the number of unrelated people living
in a house because in doing so they in
fringe on the right-to-privacy clause of
the state constitution
"There is an intensity of use when
unrelated people share a home," said
city attorney Jack Jorgenson in sup
port of the ordinance. "People tend to
have their own cars, own stereos, own
dogs, their own lives built around
themselves.
"We are concerned with problems
created by the number of cars, noise,
and so forth."
"I said to the city council that this
was an opportunity to relax the terms
of the ordinance and reexamine our
threshold of three." said Jorgenson.
The ordinance may not withstand a
legal test. Jorgenson admitted at the
council meeting Tuesday night. City
Council member Peg (iunn also said
she thought the ordinance may be un
constitutional
Attorney Pee Jordan, a member of
the board of the Midpeninsula Citizens
for Pair Housing (MCKH), said the
new ordinance is "clearly unconstitu
tional".
"Part of the Supreme Court de
cision says that people have a right to
privacy, and it implies that use per
mits are just as unconstitutional as
outright bans because they are just as
intrusive."
Jordan also said the ordinance vio
lates the Unruh Civil Rights Act of the
state civil code which says it is illegal
to discriminate in housing on the basis
of marital status.
"I think the council was trying to
make it easy to deal with times when
many people live in a house and create
disturbances." said James Clendenin,
also a board member of MCKH and an
opponent of the ordinance. "This gives
them a lot of power, but it's unequal
because it only treats a certain class."
Gunn said she voted for the or
dinance in an effort to "prevent abuse
of Menlo Hark property."
She added that, although the or
dinance may be potentially mislead
ing in some respects. "We are not
trying to legislate morality.
"There are many houses where un
related people live together and eve
rything is fine." she said. "The or
dinance doesn't require people who

live together to be married."
Gunn said she would have preferred
to increase enforcement of current
housing and parking ordinances which
deal with many of the same problems.
Hut. she said. "1 decided to vote for
the new ordinance to give teeth to the
others."
When asked what the effect of the
new ordinance would be on students.
Jorgenson said. "That's the $64,000
question
"if you have a four-bedroom house
and six students want to rent it.it
makes sense for both the landlord and
the students. Hut 1 don't know how it
would work for the neighborhood, un
less all the students studied all the
time and rode bicycles. There might
be too much noise, too much traffic,"
he said.
He added, however, that Menlo
Hark hasn't had problems with Stan
ford students. "The ordinance is not
aimed at Stanford," he said.
Clendenin said the council has no in
tention of enforcing the law unless
they get a serious complaint.
Therefore, he said. "Their inten
tions are honorable, but it's a bad law.
"I have a whole lot of questions
about how this thing is applied in am
biguous situations."
Sarita Berry, also of the MCFH.
said there are some nuclear families
where there are actually more people
living together than in residen
ces shared by unrelated adults.
"Our concern is how tight the hous
ing market is and not having arbitrary
roadblocks set up to block housing op
portunities," she said.
Jorgenson said on applications for
the license the city would be looking at
the property involved and the number
of people applying for the license, and
at how the two correspond.
'' if they say they're living as a fami
ly, we're not concerned," he said.
"We'd have to take their word for it.
We couldn't second guess them."

fringe on the right-to-privacy clause of
the state constitution
"There is an intensity of use when
unrelated people share a home," said
city attorney Jack Jorgenson in sup
port of the ordinance. "People tend to
have their own cars, own stereos, own
dogs, their own lives built around
themselves.
"We are concerned with problems
created by the number of cars, noise,
and so forth."
"I said to the city council that this
was an opportunity to relax the terms
of the ordinance and reexamine our
threshold of three." said Jorgenson.
The ordinance may not withstand a
legal test. Jorgenson admitted at the
council meeting Tuesday night. City
Council member Peg (iunn also said
she thought the ordinance may be un
constitutional
Attorney Pee Jordan, a member of
the board of the Midpeninsula Citizens
for Pair Housing (MCKH), said the
new ordinance is "clearly unconstitu
tional".
"Part of the Supreme Court de
cision says that people have a right to
privacy, and it implies that use per
mits are just as unconstitutional as
outright bans because they are just as
intrusive."
Jordan also said the ordinance vio
lates the Unruh Civil Rights Act of the
state civil code which says it is illegal
to discriminate in housing on the basis
of marital status.
"I think the council was trying to
make it easy to deal with times when
many people live in a house and create
disturbances." said James Clendenin,
also a board member of MCKH and an
opponent of the ordinance. "This gives
them a lot of power, but it's unequal
because it only treats a certain class."
Gunn said she voted for the or
dinance in an effort to "prevent abuse
of Menlo Hark property."
She added that, although the or
dinance may be potentially mislead
ing in some respects. "We are not
trying to legislate morality.
"There are many houses where un
related people live together and eve
rything is fine." she said. "The or
dinance doesn't require people who

live together to be married."
Gunn said she would have preferred
to increase enforcement of current
housing and parking ordinances which
deal with many of the same problems.
Hut. she said. "1 decided to vote for
the new ordinance to give teeth to the
others."
When asked what the effect of the
new ordinance would be on students.
Jorgenson said. "That's the $64,000
question
"if you have a four-bedroom house
and six students want to rent it.it
makes sense for both the landlord and
the students. Hut 1 don't know how it
would work for the neighborhood, un
less all the students studied all the
time and rode bicycles. There might
be too much noise, too much traffic,"
he said.
He added, however, that Menlo
Hark hasn't had problems with Stan
ford students. "The ordinance is not
aimed at Stanford," he said.
Clendenin said the council has no in
tention of enforcing the law unless
they get a serious complaint.
Therefore, he said. "Their inten
tions are honorable, but it's a bad law.
"I have a whole lot of questions
about how this thing is applied in am
biguous situations."
Sarita Berry, also of the MCFH.
said there are some nuclear families
where there are actually more people
living together than in residen
ces shared by unrelated adults.
"Our concern is how tight the hous
ing market is and not having arbitrary
roadblocks set up to block housing op
portunities," she said.
Jorgenson said on applications for
the license the city would be looking at
the property involved and the number
of people applying for the license, and
at how the two correspond.
'' if they say they're living as a fami
ly, we're not concerned," he said.
"We'd have to take their word for it.
We couldn't second guess them."

After a month of "top secret" preparation, students from ATO house stormed
San Francisco's historic Coit Tower to inform City residents in advance of the
outcome of this weekend's Big Game. The banner was stealthfully transported
to the tower's top in backpacks, and remained for all to see for over one-half
hour.
The Menlo Park City Council passed
an ordinance Tuesday night requiring
groups of unrelated people sharing a
single-family home in Menlo Park to
file for a permit before they move into
the house.
The new ordinance appends a ten
year-old city law which had prohibited
more than three unrelated adults from
sharing a home.
Last May the state Supreme Court
determined that a Santa Barbara law
similar to the old Menlo Park law was

unconstitutional. The court ruled that
city laws may not arbitrarily restrict
the number of unrelated people living
in a house because in doing so they in
