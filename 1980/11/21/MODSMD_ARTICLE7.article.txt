The Menlo Park City Council passed
an ordinance Tuesday night requiring
groups of unrelated people sharing a
single-family home in Menlo Park to
file for a permit before they move into
the house.
The new ordinance appends a ten
year-old city law which had prohibited
more than three unrelated adults from
sharing a home.

similar to the old Menlo Park law was

unconstitutional. The court ruled that
city laws may not arbitrarily restrict
the number of unrelated people living

the board of the Midpeninsula Citizens

new ordinance is "clearly unconstitu

"Part of the Supreme Court de
cision says that people have a right to
privacy, and it implies that use per

outright bans because they are just as
intrusive."
Jordan also said the ordinance vio

state civil code which says it is illegal
to discriminate in housing on the basis
of marital status.
"I think the council was trying to
make it easy to deal with times when
many people live in a house and create
disturbances." said James Clendenin,
