## Hussein's future rests on gulf war 
### Washington Post 
Baghdad, Iraq — In his cam
paign to justify to the world his
two-month-old war against rev
olutionary Iran, President Sad
dam Hussein of Iraq has
progressively elevated the his
toric importance of the conflict.
, VJ At first, when a quick victory
seemed imminent, Hussein pic
tured the war as a highly local
ized affair with strictly limited
aims. When it bogged down in
front of Iran's fanatically de
fended cities, the Iraqi presi
dent switched tack, calling the
war a struggle of the Arab na
tion as a whole against the "in
fidel Persians" who have been
the Arab's antagonists since an
tiquity.
When that did not prove
strong enough. Hussein took the
argument a theological step
further by proclaiming the con
flict a Moslem holy war. or
jihad, to reimpose true Islam on
the "heretic" mullahs who rule
Iran.
The real rationale for the
war. however, is both simpler
and more troubling. As the 43-
year-old president never lets his
people forget on the wallposters
they must read and the tele
vision propaganda they are
bombarded with daily, the war
is Hussein's own personal
crusade, or in the lexography of
the times here, "Saddam's
Qadisiya."
Qadisiya. as every Iraqi
knows, is the grubby little vil
lage in southern Iraq where in
the year 635 the Arabs, riding
out of Mecca with Koran and
sword, first met and defeated
the Persians of the decadent
Sassanian empire that had ruled
over what today is modern Iraq.
Personal identification
Such a personal identification
With the war is of course a
double-edged sword that can cut
against Hussein's enemies as
Well as against himself. By
making the war "his war." the
Iraqi president has tied his po
litical longevity to the success
of his armies in the field.
The Iraqi army retains an ad
vantage over the still-dis
organized and badly led Ira
nians. But Saddam Hussein is
still searching for a "Qadisiya"
that would still any internal dis
sent within the army or party hi
erarchy as well as allow him to
present himself to the rest of the
Arab world as a major political
and military leader in the area.
~ Should the army falter, or the
war fail to achieve its stated
aim of forcing the Iranians to
recognize Iraqi sovereignty
over the disputed Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, then. Western and
Arab observers here believe.
Hussein would become politi
cally vulnerable — as a
scapegoat put up for sacrifice
by rivals and enemies in his own
secretive Arab Baath Socialist
Party, or by disgruntled Army
officers full of frustration at the

political decisions that guided
them in battle
Problems of long war
"The longer the war drags
on," worries one of the best in
formed Western diplomats in
the Iraqi capital, "the more dif
ficult will be Saddam Hussein's
position." »•
Aside from a few minor
border posts, in most cases
abandoned before the Iraqi ad
vance. the Iraqi army's only
real victory so far has been the
capture of the commercial port
of Khorramshahr on the banks
of the Shatt-al-Arab.
The capture of nearby
Abadan. site of the Middle
East's biggest oil refinery com
plex. could be the Qadisiya
class victory that Hussein is
seeking But so far its defen
ders. reinforced with regular
army units and tanks during the
siege of Khorramshahr. have
proven tenacious and it is con
sidered unlikely that the city
will fall any time soon, despite
Iraqi claims to have the city sur
rounded and cut off from any re
supplv.
That leaves the provincial
capital of Ahwaz to the north.
But Ahwaz has also proven well
defended and Hussein's main
army, moving from the south
with a full armored brigade,
motorized infantry, long-range
artillery and other accoutre
ments of war. is still, after sev
en weeks of inching advance,
four miles from the city's south
ern suburbs. From past ex
perience the real difficult fight
ing only begins at the city limits
behind which the Iranians have
chosen to dig in in force.
It is this prospect that, ac
cording to diplomatic analysts
here, has now led Hussein to or
ganize a major offensive
against the small Khuzestan
town of Susangerd on the banks
of the Kharkeh River.
By itself Susangerd is not sig
nificant. But its capture,
claimed Tuesday by the Iraqis
and denied by the Iranians after
what was probably the biggest
battle of the war. would put the
Iraqis in a position to try to
launch a pincer movement
against Ahwaz.
Hussein, who covets recog
nition as the major power of the
Persian Gulf, would like to
achieve his own Qadisiya vic
tory. Not only would it give him
the influence he has long sought
in the Arab world, but it would
also negate any plotting or
grumbling by his Baath Party
colleagues, many of whom are
known to be resentful of the cult
of personality he has built
around himself and would no
doubt be prepared to try to ex
ploit any chinks they might find
in his political armor.
A failure to come up with a
major victory could in fact pro
vide them with the chink they
may be looking for.
