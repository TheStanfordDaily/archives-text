A confidential source reports that Ronald
Reagan. Margaret Thatcher, and Anwar Sadat
recently met at the White House to discuss
international affairs. However, terrorists burst
into the oval office and quickly hauled them
outside
Margaret Thatcher was lined up in front of a
firing squad as they raised their rifles, sensing
her impending doom, she yelled "Ear
thquake," whereupon she jumped across a
wall and escaped to safety while the terrorists
scurried tor their lives.
Sadat was then positioned before the rifle
men As the guns were poised, he shouted
"flood" which caused the terrorists to seek
' shelter while he sprinted away.
Finally Reagan was told tb stand before the
firing squad. After observing Thatcher and
Sadat, Reagan sensed a good idea. As the
rifles were raised, and the command was
about to be given. Reagan yelled "FIRE"!
I was walking down the street trying to im
press my new girt when she saw a diamond
necklace in a jewelry store window. She told
me how beautiful she thought the necklace
was. I told her she should have it, took out a
brick, smashed the window, and gave the
necklace to her.
We had walked just a little further when she
•m a fur coat in the window that she said she
would do anything to have. I took out another
brick, threw it through the window and grabbed
the fur coat tor her.
I was glad to have made her happy but, —
when she saw a dress in a store window that
she wanted, I had had enough. I told her off,
but good. I told her. "Do you think thai I am
MADE of Brickes!"
