# Cal Bears axe Stanford, 28-23
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Berkeley — There are few teams in
the nation you can flat-out give two
touchdowns and still expect to defeat
Every bookie from Las Vegas to Long
Island, as well as every armchair
quarterback from Moraga to Morgan
Hill, thought one of those teams this
week was the California Golden
Bears.
Not this week
Parlaying two Stanford fumbles in
side the Cardinals' 5-vard line into
touchdowns, the 15-point underdog
Bears may have won the biggest
gamble of head coach Koger Theder's
coaching career Saturday, upsetting
Stanford 28-23 in the 83rd Big Game.
The first fumble came in the second
quarter when Kirk Karacozoff
punched the ball out of quarterback
John Elwav's hands and Keggie Camp
fell on it at the Card 4 Fullback John
Tuggle's 2-yard dive gave Cal a 21-7
halftime lead.
The second fumble occurred with
less than five minutes in the game.
Elway handed off to Vincent White at
the Card 5. but White never got the
ball Dupre Marshall fell on it, and one
play later, quarterback J Torchio put
the Bears ahead for good with a 3-vard
bootleg for the winning touchdown.
It was Cal's 34th Big Game win
against 39 losses and 10 ties. It was
Stanford's way of saying they did not
want to go the Peach Bowl. It was also
a win that called the Old Blue dogs off
Theder.
The Bears finished 3-8 on the year, a
record that caused many Cal football
partisans to howl for Theder to get the
Axe, literally. But that third win not
>nly saved the Axe from going to Stan
ord. it saved Theder from collecting
.lis pennies in the unemployment line,
at least temporarily.
Theder may be 15-19 in his three
years of coaching Cal, but he is 2-1 in
Big Games. Even Cal Athletic Direc
tor Dave Maggard, who is not a mem
ber of the Save Koger Theder Club to
which his whole football team
belongs, would not fire a coach who
had just won one of the biggest game's
in his school's history
As for Theder, he was, as always,
happier for his players than for
himself. "It's worth it just to see those
kids walk out with smiles," he hoarse
ly said in the post-game locker room
"It's so discouraging to play careless
football week after week. It was ob
vious today what we're capable of."
"I didn't think anything could com
pare to last year," said Karacozoff of
last year's 21-14 last-second Big Game
win. "but I'm so elated I can't even
see straight. The season hadn't gone
as expected, and we had bent, but we
wouldn't let Stanford take the game
from us."
All Stanford took away from a wet,
chilly Memorial Stadium was its fifth
loss of the season against six wins. The

Cards finish Pacific-10 Conference
play at 3-4. and will watch Miami, Fla
take what they thought was their spot
in the Peach Bowl against Virginia
Tech Jan. 2.
The game started ominously for
Stanford On Cal's fifth play from
scrimmage, Torchio, who filled in ad
mirably for the injured Rich Campbell
with an 11-for-22, 186-vard afternoon,
hit tight end Don Sprague for what
looked to be first-down yardage over
the middle
However. Stanford free safety
Kevin MacMillan turned the wrong
way and executed a perfect block on
teammate Steve Lemon. Sprague had
an open field and rambled down to the
Stanford 15 before Pete St. Geme
wrestled him down. Tuggle bulled in to
score on the next play for his first of
two touchdowns The sophomore from
San Jose gained 110 yards in 27 carries
Saturday, the first and only Cal runner
to go over 100 yards in a game this
year.
Stanford struck back quickly, going
97 yards in 13 plays to tie it. White
scored the first of his three touch
downs from one yard out. The
sophomore from Denver came as
close as he could to making people

forget about Damn Nelson, still side
lined (though he came m for three
plays i by a sprained ankle he suffered
in the USC game White gained 83
yards on the ground and caught 9
passes for 109 yards.
Cal moved ahead quickly in the sec
ond quarter, getting two touchdowns
within two minutes
The first culminated a 69-yard
drive Tyrone Portee broke out of first
Vaughn Williams' and then Kick
Gervais' tackles to go in on a 19-vard
pass from Torchio.
The next touchdown came on
Klway's fumble recovered by Camp at
the Card 4
By the third quarter the Cards
began to stifle Cal's offense, holding
the Bears to only two first downs early
in the quarter Stanford was suc
cessful by blitzing heavily in general,
and Williams in particular.
"They came out in the third quarter
and blitzed and that was hurting us,"
Torchio admitted "We didn't have
time to get out of what we were doing
and shift. In the fourth quarter we got
on the sidelines and ligured out what
we were going to do."

Cal's offense had plenty of
time on the sidelines in the
fourth quarter, because Stan
ford dominated the offense in
the second half. The Cards, how
ever, stopped themselves twice,
once at the Cal 19 when Elway
fumbled the center snap and
once at the 32, when Ken Naber
hooked a 48-vard field goal at
tempt wide.
At the end of the third quarter
Stanford began a drive that
finally ended up with a score.
The play was vintage Darrin
Nelson, only the antics belonged
to White. On first-and-10 from
Cal's 32. White took Elwav's
flare pass on the right sideline
at the 30. juked inside past two
Bear defenders at the 15, cut
back outside past two more at
the 10 and stumbled in for the
score.
After forcing Cal to punt from

midfield. the Cards tied it up in
10 plays, with the officials con
tributing the biggest assist.
At the Cal 44. White slithered
around right end. was hit and
fumbled, with Cal recovering.
But the man in black-and-white
maintained Stanford kept
possession, either because
White was out-of-bounds (which
he was not > or because his for
ward progress had stopped
(which it had noti.
Thus reprieved, the Cards
went 74 yards to tie the score
21-21. White did the same flare
pass-and-go routine to move the
ball from the Cal 25 to the 8. and
Karacozoff's late hit moved the
ball to the 4. White scored from
four yards out with 7 :14 to go.
Cal'move'd the ensuing kickoff
to its own 45 before punting.
Bear kicker Mick Luckhurst
bounced his punt at the 30-yard
line and it rolled all the way to

the Stanford 5. On first down.
Elway handed off to White, but
White never got control. The
ball slid down his hip and
Marshall recovered it three
yards from the goal.
Torchio bootlegged left on
first down and scored, and with
4:37 to go. it became obvious
that the unbelievable might oc
cur in the Big Game once again.
In the Stanford offense, how
ever. four minutes-plus is plenty
of tune. Elway moved the Cards
to the Cal 45 in five plays, then
hit White on a sideline left pat
tern for 41 yards to Cal's 4, first
and-goal.
Elway tried a sprint-out pat
tern on first down, but had to
throw the ball away with no one
open. White burrowed inside the
two on a misdirection play, and
it was third down.
White carried the ball to the
line on the left side. "I didn't

turn it outside. I was bounced
back out," White said. "I was
just trying to get back in there."
White went around left end, but
defensive back Fred Williams
tackled him at the 6-vard line.
After a Stanford timeout.
Elway faded to pass, looking to
his right and right into the eyes
of blitzing defensive back Kevin
Moen. "I came outside and
thought the halfback would pick
me up but he kept going by me.
Elway rolled right into me and I
got my hand in his face," Moen
said.
Thus hurried. Elway let go of
a wobbler that fell dead five
yards short of the goal, and
much farther short of a victory,
the Peach Bowl and success in
the Big Game.
The Bears took over on downs
and tried to run the clock out.
but Stanford used its remaining
timeouts to force them to a
fourth down. Cal set up in punt
formation and intentionally cen
tered the ball out of the end zone
to give the Cards their final two
ooints.
Stanford took the free kick at
its own 37 with 20 seconds to
play. The last gasp lasted three
plays. Elway's first-down side
line pass to White almost ac
complished the impossible.
"The defensive back shed the
ball," White said. "I couldn't
see it. I didn't touch it, it just
went right through my hands."
Two plays later, with two sec
onds left in the game, Elway's
Hail Mary pass to Don Lons
inger in the end zone was de
flected out of bounds and the
game was over.

less than five minutes in the game.
Elway handed off to Vincent White at
the Card 5. but White never got the
ball Dupre Marshall fell on it, and one
play later, quarterback J Torchio put
the Bears ahead for good with a 3-vard
bootleg for the winning touchdown.
It was Cal's 34th Big Game win
against 39 losses and 10 ties. It was
Stanford's way of saying they did not
want to go the Peach Bowl. It was also
a win that called the Old Blue dogs off
Theder.
The Bears finished 3-8 on the year, a
record that caused many Cal football
partisans to howl for Theder to get the
Axe, literally. But that third win not
>nly saved the Axe from going to Stan
ord. it saved Theder from collecting
.lis pennies in the unemployment line,
at least temporarily.
Theder may be 15-19 in his three
years of coaching Cal, but he is 2-1 in
Big Games. Even Cal Athletic Direc
tor Dave Maggard, who is not a mem
ber of the Save Koger Theder Club to
which his whole football team
belongs, would not fire a coach who
had just won one of the biggest game's
in his school's history
As for Theder, he was, as always,
happier for his players than for
himself. "It's worth it just to see those
kids walk out with smiles," he hoarse
ly said in the post-game locker room
"It's so discouraging to play careless
football week after week. It was ob
vious today what we're capable of."
"I didn't think anything could com
pare to last year," said Karacozoff of
last year's 21-14 last-second Big Game
win. "but I'm so elated I can't even
see straight. The season hadn't gone
as expected, and we had bent, but we
wouldn't let Stanford take the game
from us."
All Stanford took away from a wet,
chilly Memorial Stadium was its fifth
loss of the season against six wins. The

Cards finish Pacific-10 Conference
play at 3-4. and will watch Miami, Fla
take what they thought was their spot
in the Peach Bowl against Virginia
Tech Jan. 2.
The game started ominously for
Stanford On Cal's fifth play from
scrimmage, Torchio, who filled in ad
mirably for the injured Rich Campbell
with an 11-for-22, 186-vard afternoon,
hit tight end Don Sprague for what
looked to be first-down yardage over
the middle
However. Stanford free safety
Kevin MacMillan turned the wrong
way and executed a perfect block on
teammate Steve Lemon. Sprague had
an open field and rambled down to the
Stanford 15 before Pete St. Geme
wrestled him down. Tuggle bulled in to
score on the next play for his first of
two touchdowns The sophomore from
San Jose gained 110 yards in 27 carries
Saturday, the first and only Cal runner
to go over 100 yards in a game this
year.
Stanford struck back quickly, going
97 yards in 13 plays to tie it. White
scored the first of his three touch
downs from one yard out. The
sophomore from Denver came as
close as he could to making people

forget about Damn Nelson, still side
lined (though he came m for three
plays i by a sprained ankle he suffered
in the USC game White gained 83
yards on the ground and caught 9
passes for 109 yards.
Cal moved ahead quickly in the sec
ond quarter, getting two touchdowns
within two minutes
The first culminated a 69-yard
drive Tyrone Portee broke out of first
Vaughn Williams' and then Kick
Gervais' tackles to go in on a 19-vard
pass from Torchio.
The next touchdown came on
Klway's fumble recovered by Camp at
the Card 4
By the third quarter the Cards
began to stifle Cal's offense, holding
the Bears to only two first downs early
in the quarter Stanford was suc
cessful by blitzing heavily in general,
and Williams in particular.
"They came out in the third quarter
and blitzed and that was hurting us,"
Torchio admitted "We didn't have
time to get out of what we were doing
and shift. In the fourth quarter we got
on the sidelines and ligured out what
we were going to do."

Cal's offense had plenty of
time on the sidelines in the
fourth quarter, because Stan
ford dominated the offense in
the second half. The Cards, how
ever, stopped themselves twice,
once at the Cal 19 when Elway
fumbled the center snap and
once at the 32, when Ken Naber
hooked a 48-vard field goal at
tempt wide.
At the end of the third quarter
Stanford began a drive that
finally ended up with a score.
The play was vintage Darrin
Nelson, only the antics belonged
to White. On first-and-10 from
Cal's 32. White took Elwav's
flare pass on the right sideline
at the 30. juked inside past two
Bear defenders at the 15, cut
back outside past two more at
the 10 and stumbled in for the
score.
After forcing Cal to punt from

midfield. the Cards tied it up in
10 plays, with the officials con
tributing the biggest assist.
At the Cal 44. White slithered
around right end. was hit and
fumbled, with Cal recovering.
But the man in black-and-white
maintained Stanford kept
possession, either because
White was out-of-bounds (which
he was not > or because his for
ward progress had stopped
(which it had noti.
Thus reprieved, the Cards
went 74 yards to tie the score
21-21. White did the same flare
pass-and-go routine to move the
ball from the Cal 25 to the 8. and
Karacozoff's late hit moved the
ball to the 4. White scored from
four yards out with 7 :14 to go.
Cal'move'd the ensuing kickoff
to its own 45 before punting.
Bear kicker Mick Luckhurst
bounced his punt at the 30-yard
line and it rolled all the way to

the Stanford 5. On first down.
Elway handed off to White, but
White never got control. The
ball slid down his hip and
Marshall recovered it three
yards from the goal.
Torchio bootlegged left on
first down and scored, and with
4:37 to go. it became obvious
that the unbelievable might oc
cur in the Big Game once again.
In the Stanford offense, how
ever. four minutes-plus is plenty
of tune. Elway moved the Cards
to the Cal 45 in five plays, then
hit White on a sideline left pat
tern for 41 yards to Cal's 4, first
and-goal.
Elway tried a sprint-out pat
tern on first down, but had to
throw the ball away with no one
open. White burrowed inside the
two on a misdirection play, and
it was third down.
White carried the ball to the
line on the left side. "I didn't

turn it outside. I was bounced
back out," White said. "I was
just trying to get back in there."
White went around left end, but
defensive back Fred Williams
tackled him at the 6-vard line.
After a Stanford timeout.
Elway faded to pass, looking to
his right and right into the eyes
of blitzing defensive back Kevin
Moen. "I came outside and
thought the halfback would pick
me up but he kept going by me.
Elway rolled right into me and I
got my hand in his face," Moen
said.
Thus hurried. Elway let go of
a wobbler that fell dead five
yards short of the goal, and
much farther short of a victory,
the Peach Bowl and success in
the Big Game.
The Bears took over on downs
and tried to run the clock out.
but Stanford used its remaining
timeouts to force them to a
fourth down. Cal set up in punt
formation and intentionally cen
tered the ball out of the end zone
to give the Cards their final two
ooints.
Stanford took the free kick at
its own 37 with 20 seconds to
play. The last gasp lasted three
plays. Elway's first-down side
line pass to White almost ac
complished the impossible.
"The defensive back shed the
ball," White said. "I couldn't
see it. I didn't touch it, it just
went right through my hands."
Two plays later, with two sec
onds left in the game, Elway's
Hail Mary pass to Don Lons
inger in the end zone was de
flected out of bounds and the
game was over.

Big Games. Even Cal Athletic Direc
tor Dave Maggard, who is not a mem
ber of the Save Koger Theder Club to
which his whole football team
belongs, would not fire a coach who
had just won one of the biggest game's
in his school's history
As for Theder, he was, as always,
happier for his players than for
himself. "It's worth it just to see those
kids walk out with smiles," he hoarse
ly said in the post-game locker room
"It's so discouraging to play careless
football week after week. It was ob
vious today what we're capable of."
"I didn't think anything could com
pare to last year," said Karacozoff of
last year's 21-14 last-second Big Game
win. "but I'm so elated I can't even
see straight. The season hadn't gone
as expected, and we had bent, but we
wouldn't let Stanford take the game
from us."
All Stanford took away from a wet,
chilly Memorial Stadium was its fifth
loss of the season against six wins. The

Cards finish Pacific-10 Conference
play at 3-4. and will watch Miami, Fla
take what they thought was their spot
in the Peach Bowl against Virginia
Tech Jan. 2.
The game started ominously for
Stanford On Cal's fifth play from
scrimmage, Torchio, who filled in ad
mirably for the injured Rich Campbell
with an 11-for-22, 186-vard afternoon,
hit tight end Don Sprague for what
looked to be first-down yardage over
the middle
However. Stanford free safety
Kevin MacMillan turned the wrong
way and executed a perfect block on
teammate Steve Lemon. Sprague had
an open field and rambled down to the
Stanford 15 before Pete St. Geme
wrestled him down. Tuggle bulled in to
score on the next play for his first of
two touchdowns The sophomore from
San Jose gained 110 yards in 27 carries
Saturday, the first and only Cal runner
to go over 100 yards in a game this
year.
Stanford struck back quickly, going
97 yards in 13 plays to tie it. White
scored the first of his three touch
downs from one yard out. The
sophomore from Denver came as
close as he could to making people

forget about Damn Nelson, still side
lined (though he came m for three
plays i by a sprained ankle he suffered
in the USC game White gained 83
yards on the ground and caught 9
passes for 109 yards.
Cal moved ahead quickly in the sec
ond quarter, getting two touchdowns
within two minutes
The first culminated a 69-yard
drive Tyrone Portee broke out of first
Vaughn Williams' and then Kick
Gervais' tackles to go in on a 19-vard
pass from Torchio.
The next touchdown came on
Klway's fumble recovered by Camp at
the Card 4
By the third quarter the Cards
began to stifle Cal's offense, holding
the Bears to only two first downs early
in the quarter Stanford was suc
cessful by blitzing heavily in general,
and Williams in particular.
"They came out in the third quarter
and blitzed and that was hurting us,"
Torchio admitted "We didn't have
time to get out of what we were doing
and shift. In the fourth quarter we got
on the sidelines and ligured out what
we were going to do."

Cal's offense had plenty of
time on the sidelines in the
fourth quarter, because Stan
ford dominated the offense in
the second half. The Cards, how
ever, stopped themselves twice,
once at the Cal 19 when Elway
fumbled the center snap and
once at the 32, when Ken Naber
hooked a 48-vard field goal at
tempt wide.
At the end of the third quarter
Stanford began a drive that
finally ended up with a score.
The play was vintage Darrin
Nelson, only the antics belonged
to White. On first-and-10 from
Cal's 32. White took Elwav's
flare pass on the right sideline
at the 30. juked inside past two
Bear defenders at the 15, cut
back outside past two more at
the 10 and stumbled in for the
score.
After forcing Cal to punt from

midfield. the Cards tied it up in
10 plays, with the officials con
tributing the biggest assist.
At the Cal 44. White slithered
around right end. was hit and
fumbled, with Cal recovering.
But the man in black-and-white
maintained Stanford kept
possession, either because
White was out-of-bounds (which
he was not > or because his for
ward progress had stopped
(which it had noti.
Thus reprieved, the Cards
went 74 yards to tie the score
21-21. White did the same flare
pass-and-go routine to move the
ball from the Cal 25 to the 8. and
Karacozoff's late hit moved the
ball to the 4. White scored from
four yards out with 7 :14 to go.
Cal'move'd the ensuing kickoff
to its own 45 before punting.
Bear kicker Mick Luckhurst
bounced his punt at the 30-yard
line and it rolled all the way to

the Stanford 5. On first down.
Elway handed off to White, but
White never got control. The
ball slid down his hip and
Marshall recovered it three
yards from the goal.
Torchio bootlegged left on
first down and scored, and with
4:37 to go. it became obvious
that the unbelievable might oc
cur in the Big Game once again.
In the Stanford offense, how
ever. four minutes-plus is plenty
of tune. Elway moved the Cards
to the Cal 45 in five plays, then
hit White on a sideline left pat
tern for 41 yards to Cal's 4, first
and-goal.
Elway tried a sprint-out pat
tern on first down, but had to
throw the ball away with no one
open. White burrowed inside the
two on a misdirection play, and
it was third down.
White carried the ball to the
line on the left side. "I didn't

turn it outside. I was bounced
back out," White said. "I was
just trying to get back in there."
White went around left end, but
defensive back Fred Williams
tackled him at the 6-vard line.
After a Stanford timeout.
Elway faded to pass, looking to
his right and right into the eyes
of blitzing defensive back Kevin
Moen. "I came outside and
thought the halfback would pick
me up but he kept going by me.
Elway rolled right into me and I
got my hand in his face," Moen
said.
Thus hurried. Elway let go of
a wobbler that fell dead five
yards short of the goal, and
much farther short of a victory,
the Peach Bowl and success in
the Big Game.
The Bears took over on downs
and tried to run the clock out.
but Stanford used its remaining
timeouts to force them to a
fourth down. Cal set up in punt
formation and intentionally cen
tered the ball out of the end zone
to give the Cards their final two
ooints.
Stanford took the free kick at
its own 37 with 20 seconds to
play. The last gasp lasted three
plays. Elway's first-down side
line pass to White almost ac
complished the impossible.
"The defensive back shed the
ball," White said. "I couldn't
see it. I didn't touch it, it just
went right through my hands."
Two plays later, with two sec
onds left in the game, Elway's
Hail Mary pass to Don Lons
inger in the end zone was de
flected out of bounds and the
game was over.

Berkeley — There are few teams in
the nation you can flat-out give two
touchdowns and still expect to defeat
Every bookie from Las Vegas to Long
Island, as well as every armchair
quarterback from Moraga to Morgan
Hill, thought one of those teams this
week was the California Golden
Bears.
Not this week
Parlaying two Stanford fumbles in
side the Cardinals' 5-vard line into
touchdowns, the 15-point underdog
Bears may have won the biggest
gamble of head coach Koger Theder's
coaching career Saturday, upsetting
Stanford 28-23 in the 83rd Big Game.
The first fumble came in the second
quarter when Kirk Karacozoff
punched the ball out of quarterback
John Elwav's hands and Keggie Camp
fell on it at the Card 4 Fullback John
Tuggle's 2-yard dive gave Cal a 21-7
halftime lead.
The second fumble occurred with
less than five minutes in the game.
Elway handed off to Vincent White at
the Card 5. but White never got the
ball Dupre Marshall fell on it, and one
play later, quarterback J Torchio put
the Bears ahead for good with a 3-vard
bootleg for the winning touchdown.
It was Cal's 34th Big Game win
against 39 losses and 10 ties. It was
Stanford's way of saying they did not
want to go the Peach Bowl. It was also
a win that called the Old Blue dogs off
Theder.
The Bears finished 3-8 on the year, a
record that caused many Cal football
partisans to howl for Theder to get the
Axe, literally. But that third win not
>nly saved the Axe from going to Stan
ord. it saved Theder from collecting
.lis pennies in the unemployment line,
at least temporarily.
Theder may be 15-19 in his three
years of coaching Cal, but he is 2-1 in
Big Games. Even Cal Athletic Direc
