# Cal Bears axe Stanford, 28-23
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Berkeley — There are few teams in
the nation you can flat-out give two
touchdowns and still expect to defeat
Every bookie from Las Vegas to Long
Island, as well as every armchair
quarterback from Moraga to Morgan
Hill, thought one of those teams this
week was the California Golden
Bears.
Not this week
Parlaying two Stanford fumbles in
side the Cardinals' 5-vard line into
touchdowns, the 15-point underdog
Bears may have won the biggest
gamble of head coach Koger Theder's
coaching career Saturday, upsetting
Stanford 28-23 in the 83rd Big Game.
The first fumble came in the second
quarter when Kirk Karacozoff
punched the ball out of quarterback
John Elwav's hands and Keggie Camp
fell on it at the Card 4 Fullback John
Tuggle's 2-yard dive gave Cal a 21-7
halftime lead.
The second fumble occurred with
less than five minutes in the game.
Elway handed off to Vincent White at
the Card 5. but White never got the
ball Dupre Marshall fell on it, and one
play later, quarterback J Torchio put
the Bears ahead for good with a 3-vard
bootleg for the winning touchdown.
It was Cal's 34th Big Game win
against 39 losses and 10 ties. It was
Stanford's way of saying they did not
want to go the Peach Bowl. It was also
a win that called the Old Blue dogs off
Theder.
The Bears finished 3-8 on the year, a
record that caused many Cal football
partisans to howl for Theder to get the
Axe, literally. But that third win not
>nly saved the Axe from going to Stan
ord. it saved Theder from collecting
.lis pennies in the unemployment line,
at least temporarily.
Theder may be 15-19 in his three
years of coaching Cal, but he is 2-1 in
Big Games. Even Cal Athletic Direc
tor Dave Maggard, who is not a mem
ber of the Save Koger Theder Club to
which his whole football team
belongs, would not fire a coach who
had just won one of the biggest game's
in his school's history
As for Theder, he was, as always,
happier for his players than for
himself. "It's worth it just to see those
kids walk out with smiles," he hoarse
ly said in the post-game locker room
"It's so discouraging to play careless
football week after week. It was ob
vious today what we're capable of."
"I didn't think anything could com
pare to last year," said Karacozoff of
last year's 21-14 last-second Big Game
win. "but I'm so elated I can't even
see straight. The season hadn't gone
as expected, and we had bent, but we
wouldn't let Stanford take the game
from us."
All Stanford took away from a wet,
chilly Memorial Stadium was its fifth
loss of the season against six wins. The

Cards finish Pacific-10 Conference
play at 3-4. and will watch Miami, Fla
take what they thought was their spot
in the Peach Bowl against Virginia
Tech Jan. 2.
The game started ominously for
Stanford On Cal's fifth play from
scrimmage, Torchio, who filled in ad
mirably for the injured Rich Campbell
with an 11-for-22, 186-vard afternoon,
hit tight end Don Sprague for what
looked to be first-down yardage over
the middle
However. Stanford free safety
Kevin MacMillan turned the wrong
way and executed a perfect block on
teammate Steve Lemon. Sprague had
an open field and rambled down to the
Stanford 15 before Pete St. Geme
wrestled him down. Tuggle bulled in to
score on the next play for his first of
two touchdowns The sophomore from
San Jose gained 110 yards in 27 carries
Saturday, the first and only Cal runner
to go over 100 yards in a game this
year.
Stanford struck back quickly, going
97 yards in 13 plays to tie it. White
scored the first of his three touch
downs from one yard out. The
sophomore from Denver came as
close as he could to making people

forget about Damn Nelson, still side
lined (though he came m for three
plays i by a sprained ankle he suffered
in the USC game White gained 83
yards on the ground and caught 9
passes for 109 yards.
Cal moved ahead quickly in the sec
ond quarter, getting two touchdowns
within two minutes
The first culminated a 69-yard
drive Tyrone Portee broke out of first
Vaughn Williams' and then Kick
Gervais' tackles to go in on a 19-vard
pass from Torchio.
The next touchdown came on
Klway's fumble recovered by Camp at
the Card 4
By the third quarter the Cards
began to stifle Cal's offense, holding
the Bears to only two first downs early
in the quarter Stanford was suc
cessful by blitzing heavily in general,
and Williams in particular.
"They came out in the third quarter
and blitzed and that was hurting us,"
Torchio admitted "We didn't have
time to get out of what we were doing
and shift. In the fourth quarter we got
on the sidelines and ligured out what
we were going to do."
