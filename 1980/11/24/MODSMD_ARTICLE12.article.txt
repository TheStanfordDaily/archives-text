# Color analyst stresses professional image
## 
### Fred Wainwright 
Companies spend twice as
much money packaging new
products as they do making
them, according to Sue Mc-
Collum. professional color
analyst and image consultant.
She said that since you are your
most important product, how
you package yourself is vitally
important.
These ideas form the basis of
the course "Creating Your Pro
fessional Image," which Mc-
Collum is offering here this
quarter.
McCollum, who writes a
weekly column for the San Jose
Mercury that deals exclusively
with the professional image, has
also appeared on television. She
has participated in seminars
sponsored by companies such as
United Airlines and IBM.

"We live in a world where vis
ual images are very important.
You never get a second chance
to make a good first im
pression," McCollum said. "I
had been teaching the essence of
the course privately and in jun
ior college," she added.
McCollum asked the ASSU to
help her create the course. This
quarter is th,e first time that it
has been offered It will be of
fered spring quarter and will
also remain a no-credit course.
"I think people are becoming
visually aware of themselves,
partly because of television,"
McCollum stated. "For exam
ple," she continued, "the politi
cal candidates were very in
terested in their visual presen
tation this election."
This quarter, the class is com
posed of 10 students. It meets

weekly for 2 1 2-hour sessions.
"We enjoy the class," said Mc-
Collum. "I have a lot of slide
presentations dealing with the
significance of the corporate
image and visual charts for the
study of color harmony."
The class, which lasts six
weeks, is based on a building
block of subjects. It begins with
the concept of the type of image
that a person wishes to project.
This is followed by the study of
several optional styles in dress
ing. each suitable to a certain
type of job.
Color harmony, which is cur
rently being studied in the class,
deals with the most attractive
colors for a person that are, at
the same time, not based on
fashions and trends. Following
body proportions, wardrobe
planning becomes the last and

most important subject.
The main reasons I am
teaching this course are to help
people put together a credible
business image as well as to
save time, money and frustra
tion when creating their ward
robe." said McCollum.
"In an average job in
terview she continued, "what
you say is 5 percent of the in
terviewers' criteria, while 40
percent of these criteria are
based on how you say some
thing. Non-verbal communica
tion. essentially how you dress
and how you act, make up 55
percent of the criteria.
"Your academic resume
when you graduate from Stan
ford is superior," said Mc-
Collum, "but I think it is helpful
to have a visual resume as well.
I'm not sell ins clothes; I want to

help students get to where they
want to go.'
"The class provides students
an opportunity to learn about
their personal style versus the
fashions and trends," said class
member Tim Quilter, who is not
a Stanford student but plans to
enter a junior college.
Sophomore Cindy Leyport
said she believes that "it is real
ly good to have a class that you
can use in the outside world."
"The class is very personal."
remarked Mark Everson, a
graduate student planning to
bcome a clinical psychologist,
"and it will key you only to your
own image." Ah economics ma
jor planning to enter business
school. David Speer. said he
took the course because he is a
junior and will be entering the
job market soon.
