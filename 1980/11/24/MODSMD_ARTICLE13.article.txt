# VD hotline staffers attend workshops, take calls

People around the nation know Palo
Alto as the home of more than Stanford
University. The small city is also the
headquarters of the VD National Hot
line, operated by the American Social
Health Association.
Only two criteria are necessary to get
the often-asvmptomatic disease: sexual
activity and an infected partner.
According to Reiny Lazarowicz, assis
tant director of the hotline, common
questions concern the nature and symp
toms of VD. Callers also ask how VD is
contracted and if they actually have the
disease.
The hotline emphasizes getting people
into clinics for tests. "We're trying to
break the chain," said Lazarowicz.
Since opening over a year ago, more
than 120 volunteers have gone through
the 15-hour training period. About 45 vol
unteers, ranging in age from 14 to 47, are
currently active. About eight of these are
Stanford students, said Lazarowicz.
Instruction and experience
Training involves learning through
both instruction and experience. Role
playing, for example, is part of the class.
Classes stress values clarification,

communication skills and decision-mak
ing. Volunteers must be sensitive and
particularly careful not to make value
judgments on the callers' actions, said
Lazarowicz.
Students also spend two hours listen
ing to other volunteers on the line after
the 15-hour training period. "Most peo
ple don't feel real comfortable jumping
right into the phones," said Lazarowicz.
The next volunteer training class will
meet from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Dec. 1, 2,
4. 8 and 10. Credit for volunteer work at
the hotline is available through SCIRE.
According to Lazarowicz, "the train
ing is a self-selection process." Angela
Macfarlane, a volunteer from Palo Alto
High School, said. "Some people go
through training and then say they
couldn't handle it."
Tests given
Volunteers take a pre-test and several
quizzes on the reading. "We don't harp,"
said Lazarowicz. "If you're here and
you're interested, you'll read it. Stations
are equipped with "cheat sheets" and
handbooks. A supervisor is always on
duty.
The hotline asks volunteers for a min
imum of four hours a week and a three

month commitment.
Senior Philip Feliciano worked at the
hotline last year for medical experience.
But, he said, "often times it was more
psychological than medical."
Callers are usually referred to one of
2000 crisis intervention centers or to one
of 5000 clinics throughout the United
States. But Feliciano said callers often
want the anonymity of the phone rather
than a face-to-face encounter.
Volunteers operate under a four- to
five-minute time restraint per call. But
Lazarowicz added that herpes calls, for
example, take longer because of the
complicated nature of the disease.
Many calls
The hotline receives over 11,000 calls
per month. This is an average of over 300
calls a day. The number once sky
rocketed to over 700 the day after Dear
Abby put the number in her column, said
Lazarowicz.
Of these calls, more are from males
than from females. "Most females don't
have symptoms," said Lazarowicz. But
symptoms are often absent for both sex
es. For example, 80 percent of women
and 20 to 40 percent of men with gonor
rhea are asymptomatic.

The highest number of calls is from the
20- to 24-year-old age group, followed by
15 to 19 and 25 to 29.
Most calls concern VL) in general, fol
lowed by herpes, gonorrhea, crabs.
N'GU, trichomoniasis and syphilis.
The number of calls from a state gen
erally corresponds to its population. Un
surprisingly, the majority of calls are
from New York and California, with few
from South Dakota and Wyoming.
The hotline is in live operation from 8
a.m. to 8 p.m.. Monday through Friday,
and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends. About
65 percent of calls are received week
days between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Calls re
ceived when operators are not on duty
are answered by a recorded message giv
ing general VD information, emergency
procedures and hotline hours.
According to Lazarowicz, the lines are
busiest in the early morning and after
noon. He added that the heavy number of
callers on Mondays and Wednesdays is
probably the result of the three to five
day incubation period for gonorrhea.
The hotline operates under a $280,000
budget. It received $220,000 this year
from government grants and United
Wav.
