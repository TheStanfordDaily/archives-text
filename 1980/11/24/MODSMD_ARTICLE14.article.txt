# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Do not eat tomorrow! 
### 
What are the tools of change? We are
often faced with a shortage of effective op
tions. Though many argue that one day of
fasting is a trivial act of symbolism, it can
instill in individuals a heightened aware
ness of the hunger problem. The Stanford
Committee on Hunger has chosen person
al involvement as a possible means to
change.
By participating in the fast, each person
will experience an unusual day. There will
be no way to escape the feeling of hunger.
Individuals may then understand how this
feeling is experienced daily around the
world.
Personal identification can lead to a
personal commitment to change, possibly

manifested in involvement in hunger re
lief programs or in less individual food
waste.
The money collected through the day of
fasting will produce important results:
more people will be fed. These contribu
tions are valuable.
But the vast and complex hunger prob
lem will never be solved without the help
of personally committed individuals
working together.
Please participate in the fast which
lasts from sunset tonight until sunset
tomorrow. Turn in your meal cards today;
hunger organizations will still receive the
Food Service rebates even if you have not
signed up in advance.
