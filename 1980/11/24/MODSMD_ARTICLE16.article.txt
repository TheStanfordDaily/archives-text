## The 						great migration suffers air trouble 
### 
Inspired by the remarkable
explorations of NASA's Voy
ager probe, hundreds of Stan
lord students will be hazarding
a journey of similar daring this
week. We will be flying home for
Thanksgiving.
We students, like Voyager I,
will be lacing uncertain sched
uling, a hostile environment,
taxing budgetary demands:
and, yet we will strive undaun
tedly towards our goal. "Real
food" and a bath can lure us
through just about anything.
Society has the technology.
We shot a probe to the fifth
planet and beyond. It arrived,
clicked off a few shots to send to
the kids, sent off a couple of
notes on the weather, then scut
tled away at 32,000 miles per
hour.
We have (lie technology, but
we have seen the enemy and it is
the airlines.
With no Titan moons to round
or braided rings to weave by,
one might feel justified in ex
pecting little problem in zipping
through coast to coast connec
tions. A trip to Australia usually
makes a swing around the block
look easy.
Unfortunately, the airlines
have demonstrated that it is
quite possible to muddle up our
society's major long distance
transportation system. "I'm
Becky, come fly me and I'll fly
you like you've never been flown
before." Too bad. Becky. We
know beforehand exactly how
our adventure in the air will
flow.
Its course follows an equation
of "givens" leaving only the
time of your flight and its desti
nation as the insignificant vari
ables.
Given: the Inverse Law of
Scheduling of Flights â€” no mat
ter where you want to go or
when, the scheduled flights by
the airlines are inversely re
lated to your plans.
Given: the end of an airline's
line inevitably leads to ... a
line. Airline Anatomy: the
ticket line's connected to the
check-in line . . . the check-in
line's connected to the seating
line . . the seating line's con

nected to the boarding line . . .
and at the most difficult time,
they're all connected to the
lavatory line.
Given: the longer your legs,
the closer situated the seat in
front of you; the closer the seat
in front of you, the more likely
its occupant really grooves on
reclining for a transcontinental
cat nap.
Given: in spite of the fact that
most airline personnel are
genuinely nice people, they en
counter major difficulties main
taining such an attitude when
faced with the pressured and
frustrated customers. It would
be like smiling at a charging
herd of angry bull elephants.
Given: your baggage will
always end up going to a more
exciting destination than you
are.
Now. with all these negative
"givens" one might expect that
the equation would add up to an
extremely low result. "Not so,"
booms the voice of the airlines,
as they tack on a very high price
tag to the privilege of flying. It's
a good thing that expectations
are cheap, because flying very
definitely is not.
The price of airline tickets is
expected to almost double at the
beginning of next year. Presum
ably the airlines are now mak
ing up for. or cashing in on the
merchandising draws that filled
the friendly skies throughout
the year. "Kids fly free, mate
flies at half-fare" has gone the
way of the four-prop com
mercial plane. Fun for the pas
sengers but a stress on the ever
expanding pocketbook of the
airlines.
Though we as consumers are
made to feel helpless at the
whims of the airline con
glomerates. we can at least at
tempt to formulate an under
standing of the situation. For
example, I have formulated the
following hypothesis.
I suspect that the airlines are
controlled by a monopoly far
more extensive than the system
we ever dared to imagine. The
true controlling force behind the
airlines comically dwarfs the
jumbo companies such as Pan-

Am or TWA that we usually as
sociate with power in the skies.
The members of the board of
directors of this airline power*
are of an eclectic and dist
ingished group, each member
having been rewarded responsi
bility for his/her own particular
field of expertise. Entertain
ment. for example, is handled
by none other than Mr. Walt Dis
ney. and it is he who arranges
everything from cross-airport
five-minute connections to the
cleverly scheduled bumps,
shakes and shimmers that

always appear as meal trays are
being passed out.
Richard Nixon has found
fulfillment in his retirement in
supervising the recording of the
"event of an emergency" tapes
that greet us at the onset of each
flight. Rome's Brutus has been
put in charge of co-pilot selec
tions.
Now that you know you're in
good hands, sit back, relax and
enjoy your flight.
