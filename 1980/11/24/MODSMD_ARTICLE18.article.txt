## Israel: a land of strife and strike 
### 
The Day of the Land was re
cently shown at Tresidder. This
film documents the causes and
effects of the general strike of
March 30. 1976. by the Palesti
nians living inside Israel. The
relationship between those
Palestinians and the Israeli so
ciety in general and its govern
ment in particular has been
greatly neglected in the dis
cussion and understanding of
the Arab-Israeli conflict. The

Day of the Land is important in
bringing into the open the prob
lems and prejudices faced by
the Arab minority inside Israel.
Discrimination against the
Arab minority in Israel stems
from the doctrine of Zionism,
upon which the State of Israel is
founded. Zionism sought to es
tablish and strengthen a Jewish
state in Palestine. That
Palestine is the homeland of the
Jews precludes it from being a
homeland for the non-Jews, and
particularly from being a home
land for the Christian and
Moslem Palestinians who have
been the predominant majority
in Palestine for centuries.
The practical experience of
Israeli treatment of its Arab mi
nority confirms this line of
analysis. Soon after the estab
lishment of the state of Israel
(1948), the Palestinian minority
was subjected to the rule of mil
itary governors.
The notorious emergency
regulations were used to
enclose the areas where the
Palestinians are dominated. A
permit was required for travel
outside these areas, which af
fected many people. Many Arab

villages were demolished, and
villagers were resettled in other
areas. Farmland was con
fiscated by the military govern
ment in order to establish Jew
ish settlements. Without land to
farm, many peasants were
forced to become wage-earners
in the Jewish factories.
The military government that
ruled the Arab minority in Is
rael was abolished in 1966. But
the process of land confiscation
and demographic trans
formation of the Galilee, where
most of the Arabs lived, con
tinued well beyond that year.
The number of Jewish settle
ments that were established on
confiscated Arab land was in
creased in the early and middle
'70s. This paralleled a process of
increasing political awareness
among the Palestinians living
inside Israel.
Both of the above factors led
to the declaration of a general
strike in the Arab villages and
towns in Israel on March 30,
1976. The particular purpose of
the strike was to protest Israeli
confiscation of privately owned
Arab land; that day was thus
called the"Day of the Land."

The general motivation for
the strike was to protest the ra
cial discrimination of the
Palestinian Arabs in Israel. The
reaction of the Israeli govern
ment was quite violent; army
units were sent to Arab villages
to quell the strike. Six villagers
were killed, and many more
were injured.
The conflict between the
Palestinian minority and the Is
raeli government has not come
to a resolution yet. The Israeli
government continues its policy
of discrimination and harass
ment of any political group that
would express the national
aspirations of the Palestinian
minority.
On the other hand, the politi
cal awareness of this minority
and their resistance to the racist
policies of the Israeli govern
ment have led them to associate
more strongly with the rest of
the Palestinian people in their
struggle against racism and for
the right to national self-de
termination.
