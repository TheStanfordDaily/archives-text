## 'Our community is the target' 
### 
I thank Jim Miller for his comments (Daily,
Nov. 17) concerning a letter from Roses Against a
Nuclear Environment (Daily, Nov. 13). He raised
several points not specifically addressed in the
first letter calling for an end to on-campus re
cruiting by weapons manufacturers.
To cast this issue in terms of freedom of speech
and association, as Miller does, is to obscure the
real issue. In the face of the ultimate oppression
of war, questions of individual freedom loose their
meaning. The process of arms escalation certain
ly threatens the freedom of all individuals, partic
ularly those of the Third World who may become
its target, but also our own. I view weapons prod
uction as a direct threat to world peace — nothing
short of an aggressive act of violence.
There can be no pretense that military esca
lation is needed for the defense of the U.S. Even
military advocates now speak primarily of "de
fending our vital interests" abroad. This is a thin
ly veiled call for overseas adventurism to wrest
natural and economic resources from other na
tions — what used to be called colonial im
perialism. The freedom that I am working for is
not the freedom that the U.S. sought to bring to
Korea, Vietnam, Chile and Iran.
I seek freedom for all the world s people from
the threat that U.S. and Soviet militarism repre
sents. Those who choose to work in the weapons
industry should consider what price the rest of the
world will pay for their precious individual free
dom.

The question of access to campus facilities is an
important one. I fully support the free expression
of all political viewpoints and see this as an impor
tant role for the University. However, if any
group or individual was distributing arms on cam
pus and advocating their use for personal gain, I
certainly hope that the community would act.
State sanctioned violence does not seem so dif
ferent to me than the personal violence that we
struggle so hard to drive from our society, except
in its vastly greater destructive capability.
Though the present situation is not so extreme, we
must not forget that weapons manufacturers are
selling the tools of destruction — at a profit. I can
not see this activity as compatible with the
purpose of a university.
There is no easy response to the problem Miller
raises of deciding which companies should be per
mitted to recruit on campus. The weapons in
dustry is deeply entwined with the civilian econo
my. Few corporations deal solely in defense con
tracts though literally tens of thousands have
some business in this area.
In targeting protest actions R.A.N.E. has
chosen companies whose primary business in
volves weapons — particularly nuclear weapons.
The real target of these actions is of course the
Stanford community at large. Though no small
group can hope to influence the policy of a large
institution, their attempt to alert the community
to this issue is vital.
