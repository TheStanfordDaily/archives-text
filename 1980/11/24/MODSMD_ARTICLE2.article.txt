# Book abuse by borrowers
## Library stacks may be closed 
### Karen Sakanashi 
Stanford students damage or de
stroy more than 11.000 books each
year, an average of almost one book
per student. Damages range from
highlighted pages to broken bindings
to books chewed up by dogs or dropped
in the mud.
"Some of the damages are due to
just wear and tear, but others are due
to abuse." explained Ella Harsin,
head of the University library sys
tem s binding and finishing division.
Sally Buchanan, library conserva
tion officer, said that much of the
damage occurs by way of accidents
while other damages occur simply be
cause the user is careless or in
considerate.
"Many of the damaged books can be
repaired but others are so bad that
they have to be replaced," explained
Buchanan, whose office handles the
more delicate repairs and serious
damages.
The University spends roughly
$40,000 each year to repair damaged
books. Buchanan said. "It costs $5 to
$15 to have an ordinary book rebound
and about $40 dollars to buy. catalogue
and reshelve a new one." said Harsin.
However, according to Buchanan,
many of the damaged books are com
pletely irreplaceable. "Some of the
books are out of print or were pub
lished in very small numbers," she ex
plained. These books must be either
microfilmed or photocopied. Both
processes cost about $40.
If the damaged book can be traced

to the borrower, he or she is charged
for the cost of repair or replacement.
But Harsin said because books are
checked out to so many people, it is
often hard to tell if a particular person
mistreated the book or if the damage
came from normal wear and tear
"Many of the books that turn up
damaged were never even checked
out." commented Buchanan. The
University must absorb the costs of
such damages.
According to Buchanan, the abuse
and damage of books in the Univer
sity's libraries is getting worse.
"Since the (Cecil B.) Green library
opened the losses have gone up," she
said
"If this trend keeps up something
will have to be done," she added
What effect might this have on Stan
ford students?
Possible measures could include
stricter regulation at library check
outs and check-ins, or closing the
stacks.
"Many other major libraries have
closed their stacks," explained Bu
chanan, noting that UC-Berkeley has
closed many of its stacks.
This means that students are not al
lowed to browse through or get their
own library books off the shelves. In
stead they fill out cards and workers
get the books for them.
"Patrons should take more respon
sibility for the books. I don't like the
idea of locking the books up," said
Harsin.
Making library users more respon

sible and more careful is one goal of
the six-month-old conservation office
The office launched a drive for "pre
ventive conservation" of library ma
terials by distributing bookmarkers
and hanging up posters around the li
braries.
Buchanan explained that "little"
things like putting a pencil in a book or
pressing books flat on a photocopier
can seriously damage books. The con
servation office hopes it can cut down
on damages to materials by making
the library users more aware of how
they are damaging books.
"All we ask is for a minimum
amount of thoughtfulness when han
dling library materials," said Buchan
an.
