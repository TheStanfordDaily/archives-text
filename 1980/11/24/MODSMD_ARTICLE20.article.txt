Stadium disaster
I would like to share with you
the experience my wife, daugh
ter and I had at the Stanford-
USC game.
It took us 35 minutes to get
through our assigned Gate 5.
Our ticket then directed us to
Stair 20. which also was at a
standstill, and people were
walking up the dirt hill paral
leling the stairway. We saw that
practically no one wasatGate4.
which was closest to Stair 20,
while Gate 5 was still jammed.
It took us 15 minutes to nego
tiate Stair 20 and to get to our
seats. Once there, we were
greeted with dry-rotted, splin
tered wooden benches ready to
ignite with any stray match.
There was no leg room; my
knees were against the back of
the person in front of me. It was
a triumph of the Martial Arts to
leave the seat during the game.
The aisles were clogged with
seated people, and the narrow
exit/entry tunnels were further
compromised by people stand
ing and talking. At no time did
we ever see an usher or any
crowd-control personnel. Long
lines confronted everyone at the
restrooms.
My wife stated that the whole
place gave her the feeling of a
disaster time-bomb. Frankly,
the experience was scary.
It's a shame that a university
of Stanford's stature, with a sta
dium in such a beautiful setting,
doesn't bring it up to modern
standards. I sincerely hope that
someone will address them
selves to this matter.

I for one would like to thank
Dow Woodward for his article
on intellectual racism (Daily,
Nov. 14). It sheds light on a
much needed area of examina
tion.
Assigning unwarranted
amounts of validity to I.Q. and
other such "intelligence" tests,

if any is warranted at all, is a
critical problem, particularly in
competitive environments such
as this where test scores and
grades are often elevated to un
believable heights of im
portance. The time is long over
due to begin questioning the
methods used for supposedly
testing "intelligence" and re
alizing its harmful effects.
As a black student. I can read
ily see the negative by-products
of such tests. There are few, if
any. more debilitating assump
tions of society about black
youth than blacks who are "in
tellectually capable," are the
exceptions, not the rule. It is not
difficult to imagine what hap
pens to self-confidence and self
expectations in the wake of such
beliefs.
But. the burden lies on both
sides of the track. How can
there ever be even any
semblance of harmony or "so
cial progress" in a society
where so many youths' dreams
are stillborn, only to be replaced
by destructive frustration?

Last Sunday the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (ac
tually a subset thereof), with
three matched Dollies, played,
danced, marched and punned
for a SLAC celebration. I am
writing this to thank them for
myself and the rest of the au
dience of SLACers and spouses.
I know the applause was thin at
the time — our apologies! — but
we were all standing with a
glass in one hand.
Lacking a voice amplifier, the
LSJUMB resorted to a Greek
chorus for their wit and it is in
deed rare to have humor aired
at the Highest Factor rather
than the Lowest Common De
nominator Example, directed
to one Dollie: "What's the dif-

ference between Deedee and a
sine wave?" (". . .
two, three, four!") "A half
wave rectifier!" (Consult your
local physicist for translation.)
The music and the Dollies
were, naturally, incomparable.
But those who have only seen
the band at half-time should
stand close enough for the big
drum to punch holes in your
chest and to savor those in
credibly complex rhythms.

Anger expressed
We are women and we are an
gry, too. But then we grew up on
planet Earth and we think that'.s
part of the deal.
And when we are not angry,
we go see movies. That's part of
the deal, too. "Just when you
thought it was safe to go back
into the water" is hype for one
of those movies, hype designed
to instill fear. But that's okay,
because great white sharks are
few and far between and it's fun
to jam our knees into the theater
seats in front of us as we jump
and scream, surprised and
scared.
Rapists are not so few and far
between. Rape is not so fun. And
fear is the last thing we need
here.
We conquer our fear. We re
alize the dangers of walking
alone at night. We walk in
groups if we can. We learn a lit
tle self-defense. We don't wear
spike heels and tight dresses
when we might be in a situation
where mobility is crucial. We
accept the thought of kicking a
rapist in the balls or gouging his
eyes out.
These are mean streets. But
we are not staying off them, be
cause they are ours.
You re telling us not to be em
barrassed to call SURE or a guy

from our "house," not to be de
luded by the setting in which
we're living. SURE, the guy, the
"house," the setting, they are
temporary. What happens on
planet the big bad world
when there's no chivalrous big
brother to donate two hours of
his study time to look out for lit
tle ol' us?
We sit at home with the doors
triple-bolted and dead-locked?
We get a husband to look after
us, a permanent escort service?
no thanks.

Women, get yourselves
educated in rape prevention and
in coping with rape in case you
become a victim.
But don't live as a victim.
Don't let them frighten you. You
can walk alone and meet the

I would like to share with you
the experience my wife, daugh
ter and I had at the Stanford-
USC game.
It took us 35 minutes to get
through our assigned Gate 5.
Our ticket then directed us to
Stair 20. which also was at a
standstill, and people were
walking up the dirt hill paral
leling the stairway. We saw that
practically no one wasatGate4.
which was closest to Stair 20,
while Gate 5 was still jammed.
It took us 15 minutes to nego
tiate Stair 20 and to get to our
seats. Once there, we were
greeted with dry-rotted, splin
tered wooden benches ready to
ignite with any stray match.
There was no leg room; my
knees were against the back of
the person in front of me. It was
a triumph of the Martial Arts to
leave the seat during the game.
The aisles were clogged with
seated people, and the narrow
exit/entry tunnels were further
compromised by people stand
ing and talking. At no time did
we ever see an usher or any
crowd-control personnel. Long
lines confronted everyone at the
restrooms.
My wife stated that the whole
place gave her the feeling of a
disaster time-bomb. Frankly,
the experience was scary.
It's a shame that a university
of Stanford's stature, with a sta
dium in such a beautiful setting,
doesn't bring it up to modern
standards. I sincerely hope that
someone will address them
selves to this matter.

I for one would like to thank
Dow Woodward for his article
on intellectual racism (Daily,
Nov. 14). It sheds light on a
much needed area of examina
tion.
Assigning unwarranted
amounts of validity to I.Q. and
other such "intelligence" tests,

if any is warranted at all, is a
critical problem, particularly in
competitive environments such
as this where test scores and
grades are often elevated to un
believable heights of im
portance. The time is long over
due to begin questioning the
methods used for supposedly
testing "intelligence" and re
alizing its harmful effects.
As a black student. I can read
ily see the negative by-products
of such tests. There are few, if
any. more debilitating assump
tions of society about black
youth than blacks who are "in
tellectually capable," are the
exceptions, not the rule. It is not
difficult to imagine what hap
pens to self-confidence and self
expectations in the wake of such
beliefs.
But. the burden lies on both
sides of the track. How can
there ever be even any
semblance of harmony or "so
cial progress" in a society
where so many youths' dreams
are stillborn, only to be replaced
by destructive frustration?

Last Sunday the Incom
parable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band (ac
tually a subset thereof), with
three matched Dollies, played,
danced, marched and punned
for a SLAC celebration. I am
writing this to thank them for
myself and the rest of the au
dience of SLACers and spouses.
I know the applause was thin at
the time — our apologies! — but
we were all standing with a
glass in one hand.
Lacking a voice amplifier, the
LSJUMB resorted to a Greek
chorus for their wit and it is in
deed rare to have humor aired
at the Highest Factor rather
than the Lowest Common De
nominator Example, directed
to one Dollie: "What's the dif-

ference between Deedee and a
sine wave?" (". . .
two, three, four!") "A half
wave rectifier!" (Consult your
local physicist for translation.)
The music and the Dollies
were, naturally, incomparable.
But those who have only seen
the band at half-time should
stand close enough for the big
drum to punch holes in your
chest and to savor those in
credibly complex rhythms.

Anger expressed
We are women and we are an
gry, too. But then we grew up on
planet Earth and we think that'.s
part of the deal.
And when we are not angry,
we go see movies. That's part of
the deal, too. "Just when you
thought it was safe to go back
into the water" is hype for one
of those movies, hype designed
to instill fear. But that's okay,
because great white sharks are
few and far between and it's fun
to jam our knees into the theater
seats in front of us as we jump
and scream, surprised and
scared.
Rapists are not so few and far
between. Rape is not so fun. And
fear is the last thing we need
here.
We conquer our fear. We re
alize the dangers of walking
alone at night. We walk in
groups if we can. We learn a lit
tle self-defense. We don't wear
spike heels and tight dresses
when we might be in a situation
where mobility is crucial. We
accept the thought of kicking a
rapist in the balls or gouging his
eyes out.
These are mean streets. But
we are not staying off them, be
cause they are ours.
You re telling us not to be em
barrassed to call SURE or a guy

from our "house," not to be de
luded by the setting in which
we're living. SURE, the guy, the
"house," the setting, they are
temporary. What happens on
planet the big bad world
when there's no chivalrous big
brother to donate two hours of
his study time to look out for lit
tle ol' us?
We sit at home with the doors
triple-bolted and dead-locked?
We get a husband to look after
us, a permanent escort service?
no thanks.

Women, get yourselves
educated in rape prevention and
in coping with rape in case you
become a victim.
But don't live as a victim.
Don't let them frighten you. You
can walk alone and meet the
world head-on.
