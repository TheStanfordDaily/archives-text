# It's fun; it's frenzy; it's... Big Game Weekend 1980
## Cards fire up; the Band plays on 
### Jan Mireles 
Overhead a red banner bear
ing the name Stanford hung
proudly — a remnant of opening
night Gaieties '80.
On stage the white canvas
backdrop rose slightly to reveal
more than 100 pair of strangely
clad feet.
An electrifying charge ran
through the audience.
Suddenly the backdrop disap
peared and the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band rushed for
ward.
Instinctively 1500 bodies
leaped from the red cushioned
seats in Memorial Auditorium
to greet the Band. Like so many
times before, the applause was
deafening. Amidst screams and
cheers the Band convinced the
dancing crowd that it was "All
Right Now."
While students danced in the
aisles the Band played on,
momentum building. A
drumstick flew out of a zealous
drummer's hand and into the
near wild crowd. One student
reached out and retrieved the
stick, now destined to a place of
honor in an Arroyo dorm room.
It was evident that once again
the Band was in control. There's
something special about the
part of Stanford that calls itself
The Band — something that
goes beyond the crazy fashions
and drugged-out reputation. The
mere mention of The Band can
cause the most sane Stanford
student to drop his books and

force all academic thoughts
from his mind. When it plays,
you have to listen; when it calls,
you have to follow.
So when The Band urged the
crowd to follow them to Bran
ner, to Wilbur, to the Row, to
Flo Mo and finally to Lake Lag,
there was no hesitating.
The expectant crowd poured
out of Mem Aud eager to begin
an adventure ala The Band.
They were not disappointed.
As the Band bounced, danced,
snaked and played its way
around campus, the crowd
swelled. Dorm lights flicked on
as students along the route hung
out of windows, danced on
ledges and cheered from
balconies.
Bandmembers dressed in
everything possible from a pale
orange evening gown to a flan
nel nightgown paired with yel
low rainboots and slicker,
mesmerized the crowd with
wild antics.
Cameras flashed as, much to
the crowd's delight, the Dollies
performed routine after rou
tine. Pom pons flashing in the
cold night air, the Dollies suc
cessfully enticed the growing
crowd to join them in their
dance.
The crowd poured down into
the dusty basin of Lake Lag. The
Band positioned itself on the
boat house dock and roof. The
Dollies took their places behind
spotlights. In the center of the
lake workers made ready for
the fireworks to come.

The drums set the beat. A sea
of clapping hands reached into
the dark. Trombones glistened
in the moonlight as players
swayed back and forth over the
dock railing. Friends greeted
each other with hugs and hearty
backslaps. Bottles touched lips
and quenched parched throats
strained from cheering.
Football supporters
circulated through the crowd
distributing stickers reading
"Reach for the Peach." Team
members promised victory and
students promised support.
The moment hung suspended
in time. Energy coursed
through the throng. No one was
unaffected. In every corner
friends linked arms and reveled
in the music. Lines formed and
students weaved in and out of
the maze of people — always in
beat with the Band.
Fireworks cascaded down
from a cloudy sky often framing
the near-full-moon in illuminat
ing colors of pink, green and yel
low.
The lights dimmed. The Band
turned away from the dock. The
last firework sparked and
fizzled; The crowd grew still.
The distant sound of crickets
chirping penetrated the silence
as the crowd dispersed. And as
the last cloud of dust stirred up
by the happy throng settled to
the lake's floor, the moment
passed. Big Game weekend
passed, too, but despite the dis
appointing defeat at Berkeley
Saturday, the power and memo
ry of the Band remains.

through the throng. No one was
unaffected. In every corner
friends linked arms and reveled
in the music. Lines formed and
students weaved in and out of
the maze of people — always in
beat with the Band.
Fireworks cascaded down
from a cloudy sky often framing
the near-full-moon in illuminat
ing colors of pink, green and yel
low.
The lights dimmed. The Band
turned away from the dock. The
last firework sparked and
fizzled; The crowd grew still.
The distant sound of crickets
chirping penetrated the silence
as the crowd dispersed. And as
the last cloud of dust stirred up
by the happy throng settled to
the lake's floor, the moment
passed. Big Game weekend
passed, too, but despite the dis
appointing defeat at Berkeley
Saturday, the power and memo
ry of the Band remains.

Overhead a red banner bear
ing the name Stanford hung
proudly — a remnant of opening
night Gaieties '80.
On stage the white canvas
backdrop rose slightly to reveal
more than 100 pair of strangely
clad feet.
An electrifying charge ran
through the audience.
Suddenly the backdrop disap
peared and the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior Univer
sity Marching Band rushed for
ward.
Instinctively 1500 bodies
leaped from the red cushioned
seats in Memorial Auditorium
to greet the Band. Like so many
times before, the applause was
deafening. Amidst screams and
cheers the Band convinced the
dancing crowd that it was "All
Right Now."
While students danced in the
aisles the Band played on,
momentum building. A
drumstick flew out of a zealous
drummer's hand and into the
near wild crowd. One student
reached out and retrieved the
stick, now destined to a place of
honor in an Arroyo dorm room.
It was evident that once again
the Band was in control. There's
something special about the
part of Stanford that calls itself
The Band — something that
goes beyond the crazy fashions
and drugged-out reputation. The
mere mention of The Band can
cause the most sane Stanford
student to drop his books and

force all academic thoughts
from his mind. When it plays,
you have to listen; when it calls,
you have to follow.
So when The Band urged the
crowd to follow them to Bran
ner, to Wilbur, to the Row, to
Flo Mo and finally to Lake Lag,
there was no hesitating.
The expectant crowd poured
out of Mem Aud eager to begin
an adventure ala The Band.
They were not disappointed.
As the Band bounced, danced,
snaked and played its way
around campus, the crowd
swelled. Dorm lights flicked on
as students along the route hung
out of windows, danced on
ledges and cheered from
balconies.
Bandmembers dressed in
everything possible from a pale
orange evening gown to a flan
nel nightgown paired with yel
low rainboots and slicker,
mesmerized the crowd with
wild antics.
Cameras flashed as, much to
the crowd's delight, the Dollies
performed routine after rou
tine. Pom pons flashing in the
cold night air, the Dollies suc
cessfully enticed the growing
crowd to join them in their
dance.
The crowd poured down into
the dusty basin of Lake Lag. The
Band positioned itself on the
boat house dock and roof. The
Dollies took their places behind
spotlights. In the center of the
lake workers made ready for
the fireworks to come.

The drums set the beat. A sea
of clapping hands reached into
the dark. Trombones glistened
in the moonlight as players
swayed back and forth over the
dock railing. Friends greeted
each other with hugs and hearty
backslaps. Bottles touched lips
and quenched parched throats
strained from cheering.
Football supporters
circulated through the crowd
distributing stickers reading
"Reach for the Peach." Team
members promised victory and
students promised support.
The moment hung suspended
in time. Energy coursed
through the throng. No one was
unaffected. In every corner
friends linked arms and reveled
in the music. Lines formed and
students weaved in and out of
the maze of people — always in
beat with the Band.
