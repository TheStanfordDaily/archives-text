Berkeley — Losing the Big
Game feels terrible. That's all
there is to it. Regardless of what
anyone said last week about how
little this one meant in the grand
scheme of college football, Big
Game is always something spe
cial. This year's version, de
spite records or statistics, be
came an event.
From a Cardinal perspective,
the problem with all that Big
Game spirit Saturday was that
it transformed Cal from 15-point
underdogs into five-point win
ners. The Golden Bears came
roaring onto the field in Memo
rial Stadium like they'd bor
rowed some whites from the
frenetic Cal band. The same de
fense which gave up 41 points to
Florida (who?), 38 to Michigan
and 60 to USC frustrated one of
the nation's top 10 offenses all
day long. Stanford simply
couldn't do what it likes to do —
mix it up on offense.
What happened this weekend
was that the Big Game turned
into what no one thought it
would be — a big game. As All-
America flanker Ken
Margerum said, "That's the

way this game is." And that
makes losing it all the more
painful.
Junior split end Andre Tyler,
who was held to two catches for
19 yards on the day, said in a
somber Stanford locker room
after the game. "Yeah. I'm re
ally disappointed. I was think
ing about leaving next year and
trying out the draft, but this
game made me want to come
back and do it right. I've just got
a gut feeling right now that I
can't leave. It's unfortunate for
the seniors. They have to go out
losing like this."
That seemed to be the feeling
throughout the locker room — a
sense that something just didn't
work this season coupled with
the frustration and disgust that
the spirit of Norman, Oklahoma
was never too far away. There
wasn't any sign of despair — it
was a fun season for Stanford. It
seemed more like a sense of dis
appointment that the new pro
gram's potential couldn't be ex
ploited this year.
"I can't wait until next
year," said the season's won
derboy, John Elway. "I have a
great respect for (Cal head

coach) Roger Theder and I'm
looking forward to the game
next year. Considering the
Peach Bowl, I guess this was
kind of a double loss. I've never
had a loss like this before —
things just didn't click today.
Maybe it had something to do
with the week off, I don't
know."
Darrin Nelson, who was ham
pered for the last two games by
an ankle injury and consequent
ly kept from achieving a third
1000-yard, 50-reception season,
was characteristically casual
after the game.
"I'mkinda upset," he said. "I
wanted to go to a bowl game all
four years I was here. I really
want a 9-2 season bad. That's the
only reason I'm coming back.
I'm not any more disappointed
that I didn't get the 1000 yards
than I am that we lost the
game."
For the Cardinal seniors, of
course, there is no next year.
The frustration, it seemed, was
compounded by two years of in
dividual and team success
stymied by two more of team
disappointment. It's hard to
have it and then lose it.

Margerum. when asked if he
had used a pain-killer for the hip
injured in the USC game, said,
"I didn't want to play with an
other shot — it's not worth it to
me. I'm disappointed. I'm sad
that we couldn't go to the Peach
Bowl and have a better record. I
would have liked to play with
these guys again.''
Offensive tackle Brian
Holloway, who came into his
own this season despite the
problems with the team, said,
"No comment — I'm dead seri
ous about that. It was an un
timely end to my career."
Outside linebacker Milt
McColl was more talkative. "I
feel lousy," he said. "There's a
big difference between a 6-5 and
7-4 record. This was barely a
winning season and that hurts.
Two years ago I liked winning
the Big Game, but as a senior it
would have been really special.
I guess life's rough in the big
city."
Linebacker Tom Hall, a sen
ior with another year of
eligibility, put it to the point as
well. "Wow.'' he said. "That's
not a very nice way to end the
year."
