# Bears had a little help in closing door on Stanford
## 
### Ivan Maisel 
Berkeley — Roger Theder
said early last week that if
Cal could "close the door" on
Stanford's explosive offense,
then it could be "one heckuva
football game." While the
Bears deserve a lot of the
credit for keeping that of
fensive door locked.they had
some help.
Injuries to starting run
ning backs Darrin Nelson
and Jim Brown gave Stan
ford. with the exception of
John Elway. a second-string
backfield. While both full
back Jeff Haile and especial
ly halfback Vincent White
had the game of their ca
reers. Cal nonetheless could
afford to lay off the Stanford
running game and concen
trate on the pass.
The Bears did so by drop
ping eight and sometimes
nine men off the line of
scrimmage to stop the two
weapons remaining in the
Cardinal arsenal: John
Elway's passing and John
Elway's scrambling
The ninth man in the pass
defense is known as the
"cop." His job is to arrest
Elway should he tresspass
across the line of scrim
mage. "The cop hits the cen
ter and then plays like a line
backer." said nose guard,
and cop. Dupre Marshall.
"All our defensive backs are

on the wide receivers. The
main job is to stop him
(Elway I when he decides to
scramble."
Using a lot of nickel" de
fense. that is. five defensive
backs, the Bears choked off
the Stanford passing attack
to wide receivers Ken
Margerum and Andre Tyler
Elway had to dump off a lot
of passes to his running
backs when he was not
scrambling to save his own
life and limb.
At halftime Elway was the
leading rusher with 41 yards
and Mark Mordell. who
shared time with Haile at
fullback, led all receivers
with five catches. That is not
the Stanford offense. That is
known as role reversal.
The Cards began to solve
the Cal defense in the second
half by going almost ex
clusively to flare passes to
the running backs on the
right side of the field. The
running backs often had 10 or
15 yards in front of them af
ter catching the ball.
"The (defensive) end who
had that flat would come
down with the receiver and
then the back would re
lease." Cal safety Ron Coc
cimiglio said. "Only the end
didn't follow the receiver."
By the end of the game
White. Mordell and Haile had
21 catches between them

while Margerum and Tyler
shared but five receptions.
Elway finished with a re
spectable but un-Elway-like
27 completions in 44 attempts
and one touchdown He did
break Steve Dils' 1978 record
for completions in a season,
finishing with 248.
Then there were the mis
takes Stanford has been
near the top of the Pacific-10
Conference in turnover
margin all season. Cal has
beaten itself week after
masochistic week by fumbl
ing here, getting penalized
there The Cards lost three of
four fumbles, giving the
Bears two touchdowns. Cal
was error-free.
In the end it was a question
of who wanted it more. Stan
ford wanted to go to the
Peach Bowl, though re
portedly there was some
grumbling among the
players about having to prac
tice over the holidays in
preparation for a Jan. 2 bowl
game.
But Cal had more than a
bowl game on the line. The
Bears, and Theder especial
ly, have been put through the
wringer all season long. Win
ning the Big Game could
make it all palatable. "There
have been a lot of downs this
year," Coccimiglio said.
"The ups have been few, but
fine."

A factor in Stanford's loss was the Cards' inability to get the
ball to Ken Margerum, who managed to catch this one . . .
