# Cards still No. 1 going into NCAAs
## Unmotivated Stanford falls victim to fired-up Cal 9-7 
### Sally Jenkins 
Berkeley — It was a cold, rot
ten day for a lousy defeat. The
Stanford water polo team was
unable to overcome the home
pool disadvantage, an obnoxious
Berkeley crowd and a severe
case of apathy Saturday, losing

to Cal 9-7 at Harmon pool.
The contest was of no special
significance to the Cardinals
other than the chance to con
vince the other seven schools
entered in the NCAA cham
pionship tournament that Stan
ford is without a doubt the No. 1

team in the nation.
Instead, the loss slightly
weakened the Cards going into
this weekend's tournament. As
early as Sunday morning Cal
ace Kevin Robertson was as
serting in a San Francisco paper
that the Cardinals can be
beaten.
"We wanted to win to show
people that we really are No. 1,"
said Cardinal coach Dante Det
tamanti. "It would have been a
tremendous psychological ad
vantage going into the tour
nament next week. Instead, the
other teams are going to be
thinking that we can be beaten."
It was not a championship
team that showed up at Harmon
pool. Stanford looked sluggish,
even disorganized throughout
most of the contest. Cal took an
immediate two-goal lead and re
linquished it only once, during
the second quarter.
The Bears held Stanford
scoreless throughout the first
quarter. It was not until halfway
through the second period that
the Cards were able to tie the
game at 3-3, when Chris Kelsey
scored twice and Jamie
Bergeson once. Robertson put
the Bears ahead 4-3 with a goal
in the final seconds of the half.
The third quarter was even
more dismal than the first, as
Cal outscored Stanford 3-0. Rob
ertson hit with a lob over goalie
John Gansel to make the score
5-3. It was the "back-breaking"
point of the game, according to
Dettamanti. "That's what
killed us. Robertson scored
three unanswered goals after
we tied it up and it really broke

our backs," Dettamanti said
Robertson's unorthodox
shooting style was a constant
source of exasperation for Det
tamanti. Apparently the
smaller pool Cal competes in is
more complementary to the
type of shot with which Robert
son scored four goals in the con
test.
"The guy throws junk up
there," a frustrated Dettamanti
said. "He's an excellent player,
but he never throws a direct
shot. It's always junk. We can
neutralize him in a regulation
sized pool, but on defense at Cal
we were too slow to react. We
gave him shots."
Robertson scored his final
goal of the game with yet anoth
er lob to make the score 6-3 at
the midpoint of the fourth quar
ter. Stanford did outscore the
Bears 4-2 from that point on, but
the Cards were unable to come
back from the demoralizing
scores of the first half. Kelsey
had his third goal. Alan and
Maurice Mouchawar scored one
each, and Greg Lambert scored
the final Cardinal goal in the
closing seconds.
Dettamanti was unable to
pinpoint one single thing that
caused the Cardinals' poor per
formance. He denied that the
smaller pool and large Cal
crowd were enough to unsettle
his team, at least to such an ex
treme degree.
"We just didn't play well," he
said. "Every year we go over
there and play the same kind of
game. R's really frustrating,
and I just don't understand it. I
thought we were up for the

game and we were going to play
well, but we simply didn't."
The primary problem seemed
to be one of motivation. It very
well could be that Cal won sim
ply because they had everything
to gain, and Stanford had noth

ing but a little bit of pride to
carry them through.
"We simply were not as
motivated as Cal. There was
nothing there besides the pride
because the game didn't mean
anything," the coach added.

"This team knows it can beat
anybody, and there will be no
motivation problem. The guys
are ready," Dettamanti said,
"and there is no doubt in my
mind that we will play well in
the NCAAs."

entered in the NCAA cham
pionship tournament that Stan
ford is without a doubt the No. 1

team in the nation.
Instead, the loss slightly
weakened the Cards going into
this weekend's tournament. As
early as Sunday morning Cal
ace Kevin Robertson was as
serting in a San Francisco paper
that the Cardinals can be
beaten.
"We wanted to win to show
people that we really are No. 1,"
said Cardinal coach Dante Det
tamanti. "It would have been a
tremendous psychological ad
vantage going into the tour
nament next week. Instead, the
other teams are going to be
thinking that we can be beaten."
It was not a championship
team that showed up at Harmon
pool. Stanford looked sluggish,
even disorganized throughout
most of the contest. Cal took an
immediate two-goal lead and re
linquished it only once, during
the second quarter.
The Bears held Stanford
scoreless throughout the first
quarter. It was not until halfway
through the second period that
the Cards were able to tie the
game at 3-3, when Chris Kelsey
scored twice and Jamie
Bergeson once. Robertson put
the Bears ahead 4-3 with a goal
in the final seconds of the half.
The third quarter was even
more dismal than the first, as
Cal outscored Stanford 3-0. Rob
ertson hit with a lob over goalie
John Gansel to make the score
5-3. It was the "back-breaking"
point of the game, according to
Dettamanti. "That's what
killed us. Robertson scored
three unanswered goals after
we tied it up and it really broke

our backs," Dettamanti said
Robertson's unorthodox
shooting style was a constant
source of exasperation for Det
tamanti. Apparently the
smaller pool Cal competes in is
more complementary to the
type of shot with which Robert
son scored four goals in the con
test.
"The guy throws junk up
there," a frustrated Dettamanti
said. "He's an excellent player,
but he never throws a direct
shot. It's always junk. We can
neutralize him in a regulation
sized pool, but on defense at Cal
we were too slow to react. We
gave him shots."
Robertson scored his final
goal of the game with yet anoth
er lob to make the score 6-3 at
the midpoint of the fourth quar
ter. Stanford did outscore the
Bears 4-2 from that point on, but
the Cards were unable to come
back from the demoralizing
scores of the first half. Kelsey
had his third goal. Alan and
Maurice Mouchawar scored one
each, and Greg Lambert scored
the final Cardinal goal in the
closing seconds.
Dettamanti was unable to
pinpoint one single thing that
caused the Cardinals' poor per
formance. He denied that the
smaller pool and large Cal
crowd were enough to unsettle
his team, at least to such an ex
treme degree.
"We just didn't play well," he
said. "Every year we go over
there and play the same kind of
game. R's really frustrating,
and I just don't understand it. I
thought we were up for the

game and we were going to play
well, but we simply didn't."
The primary problem seemed
to be one of motivation. It very
well could be that Cal won sim
ply because they had everything
to gain, and Stanford had noth

ing but a little bit of pride to
carry them through.
"We simply were not as
motivated as Cal. There was
nothing there besides the pride
because the game didn't mean
anything," the coach added.

"This team knows it can beat
anybody, and there will be no
motivation problem. The guys
are ready," Dettamanti said,
"and there is no doubt in my
mind that we will play well in
the NCAAs."

Bears beat Lambert and his teammates Saturday for the first time
this year 9-7.
Berkeley — It was a cold, rot
ten day for a lousy defeat. The
Stanford water polo team was
unable to overcome the home
pool disadvantage, an obnoxious
Berkeley crowd and a severe
case of apathy Saturday, losing

to Cal 9-7 at Harmon pool.
The contest was of no special
significance to the Cardinals
other than the chance to con
vince the other seven schools
