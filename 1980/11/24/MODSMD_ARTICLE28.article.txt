# Winning Cards host tough Bruins

### Robert Stone 
A display of offensive fire
power led the Stanford women's
basketball team to first place in
the Cal Poly Tournament at San
Luis Obispo over the weekend.
The Cardinals will try to re
peat that effort tonight when
they face nationally-ranked
UCLA in the home opener at
Maples Pavilion. The game be
gins at 7 p.m.
"We're getting scoring out of
everyone. The team effort is in
credible," said head coach Dot
ty McCrea of her squad's per
formance. "It was a good way to
start the season."
Stanford defeated Azusa Pa
cific, UC-Santa Barbara, and
Cal Poly-SLO for the tourney
championship, and placed jun
ior center Louise Smith and
sophomore Kim Kupferer on the
All-Tournament team.
Stanford swept Azusa Pacific
73-42 behind leading scorer De
nise McGuire's 14 points.

Against UC-Santa Barbara the
Cardinals were paced by the six
foot-one Smith who tossed in 30
points. Kupferer, sophomore
Meg Metzger, and junior Ann
Miller scored in double figures
to lead Stanford to an 86-70 vic
tory.
After leading Cal Poly at the
half by 17 the Cards staved off a
second-half rally to overcome
the Mustangs 64-59. Smith again
led the way with 26 points, while
Miller chipped in 11 and
Metzger added nine. McCrea
was especially pleased with the
Cal Poly victory. "We showed a
lot of poise holding on to the
lead," she said.
As for her impressions of the
team's showing in the tour
nament McCrea said, "Overall
the picture looked good, al
though we need to work on our
man-to-man (defense). With the
point guards combining for 10-12
points a game it's like a dif
ferent team."

Smith pointed out that the
team played with concentra
tion. "I thought we looked pret
ty good, we showed intensity.
We were a little disorganized on
offense but the defense was
pretty good," she said.
The Cards will need to con
tinue their scoring against the
formidable Bruins tonight.
UCLA possesses one of the best
players anywhere in two-time
Kodak All-America Denise
Curry. The 6-foot-l senior, a 1980
Olympic Team member, was
the only American to make the
All-World team at the Olympic
Qualifying Tournament in Bul
garia last May.
Numerically her achieve
ments last year included a 28.5
points per game average (sec
ond in the nation) and a .893 free
throw percentage (best in the
nation). Curry and former
Bruin standout Kareem Abdul-

Jabaar are the only players in
UCLA history to score over 2000
career points.
The key to tonight's game will
be to exhibit the same scoring
offense against UCLA as Stan
ford did against the tournament
teams. "Denise Curry is one of
the best players in the country.
We're going to have to score,"
McCrea said. "We can't stop
her."
Although UCLA has been
ranked as high as eighth in some
pre-season polls McCrea in
dicated that might be a little ov
errated. "They're definitely in
the top 20, but they have a lot of
young players with not that
much experience," she said.
However, McCrea added, "You
can never count them out."
Smith added about the game,
"I think we're going to have to
play our best to beat them, but
we definitely can beat them."
