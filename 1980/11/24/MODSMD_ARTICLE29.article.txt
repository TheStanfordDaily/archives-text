# Spikers get playoff berth

Capping an extremely satis
fying season, Stanford's wom
en's volleyball team received a
bid to the WAIAW Region 8 tour
nament beginning Friday at
Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion.
No school in the eight-team
field, however, will have an
easy time of it. Consider the fact
that Stanford, which finished
29-13, is the eighth and bottom
seed in the tourney, despite
being ranked ninth nationally.

"It's a pretty awesome field,"
Stanford head coach Fred
Sturm admitted. "The regional
tournament is definitely
stronger than the nationals."
The Cardinals are fortunate
that the Region 8 is a double
elimination tourney, for they
have to play No. 1-ranked USC
in the opening round. In last
week's Wendy's Classic, the
Trojans destroyed Stanford
15-3, 15-4 and 15-3.
Sturm said that if the Cards
can beat USC or one of the other
teams seeded in the top four —
UOP, Hawaii and UCLA — they
would go to the WAIAW finals,
since four teams will be
selected from the region. "Eve
ry match is important," he em
phasized.

This will be Stanford's first
post-season appearance since
1977. The Cards ended the regu
lar season successfully Friday
night in Berkeley's Harmon
Gym, defeating the Golden
Bears 15-8, 15-5 and 15-10.
"Berkeley is having problems
— they've had a lot of injuries
and a lot of illnesses," Sturm
said. "But in the past, we have
had trouble winning there."
Fencers triumph
Stanford's men's fencing
team improved its record to 5-1
Friday with a 21-9 triumph over
San Francisco State. The men's
foil squad outlasted the Gators
5-4, the sabre specialists won 8-4 ,
and the epee group prevailed
8-1.
The women tied San Francis
co 8-8, but the Gators were given
the victory because they had
more "touches" given than re
ceived. The outcome dropped
Stanford's record to 2-3.
