# Congress passes national budget- in the red again
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — This was to have
been the Year of the Balanced Budget,
the ultimate vindication of Congress'
usually creaky, often snarled and
always endangered budget control
process.
Instead, Congress last week passed
yet another red-ink budget, a hastily
slapped-together spending blueprint
that was as hard to pin down as the
leaves falling outside the Capitol.
"This," said Sen. Henrv Bellmon
(R-Okla ), a man of plain-spoken wis
dom when it comes to budgets, "was
not a banner year."
Yet for all the faults that its sup
porters readily concede, the process
that produced the $632.4 billion spend
ing ceiling and $27.4 billion deficit for
fiscal 1981 was not a total failure.
In retrospect, with a recession in
the offing, it was economic folly and
political delusion to think that a deficit
could be avoided. Measured against
other achievements of the outgoing
%th Congress, the budget process
might even be a modest success.
The budget process itself cannot
force Congress to spend less The only
discipline in it lies in requiring Con
gress to acknowledge and put its name

to whatever deficit its spending in
stincts and economic judgment com
bine to produce. But this requirement
is important.
Priorities
It forced Congress to focus as never
before on its priorities and begin to
tame its spending appetites, at least
on the domestic side.

!\ews analysis

It required cuts in existing pro
grams. although less than originally
planned, to meet budget goals
And it resulted in a budget ceiling,
unrealistic as it may be. that will
press the incoming Reagan adminis
tration and new Congress to deal
swiftly with even bigger spending
cuts.
Perhaps most important of all, it
caused pain among the powerful and it
survived.
Rep. Leon Panetta ( D-Calif.), who
ranks with Bellmon among the more
thoughtful congressional budgeteers.
believes it was a mixed record. but one
that proves a need for the process to
continue in strengthened form
Congress' failure to meet its earlier
spending targets — and to do so by the

deadlines it prescribed for itself —
meant a "gradual erosion of the basic
discipline of the process and more fuel
for the arguments of those who would
abandon it." said Panetta in summing
up the record.
But Congress' use for the first time
of the so-called "reconciliation
mechanism to force cutbacks in exist
ing programs — coupled with the dis
cipline inherent in trying to balance
the budget — were significant gains.
Panetta added.
It can be argued, in fact, that Con
gress played pretty well until the last
few minutes of the game, when it sim
ply fell back and punted.
It can also be argued that it did the
right thing for the wrong reasons.
Hardly anyone on Capitol Hill be
lieves that the "final" budget resolu
tion that Congress adopted last week
in a rush to end its lame-duck miseries
by Dec. 5 will actually turn out to be
final Many lawmakers. Democrats as
well as Republicans, believe another
budget resolution is likely for fiscal
1981 next year.
According to House Budget Com
mittee estimates, the budget assumes
$18 billion in spending cuts that
Bellmon. for one. thinks will be im

possible to achieve despite reassuring
sounds out of the Reagan camp.
"Any talk of $18 billion incuts is just
so much rhetoric," said Bellmon, who
is retiring this year and hence has no
stake in self-delusion.
Double impact
For one thing, the fiscal year run
ning from October 1980 to September
1981 will be about half over before the
cuts can be made — in effect doubling
their impact on programs and ser
vices.
If that weren't bad enough, the sup
posed budget ceiling is $7.2 billion
below appropriations bills already
passed by the House and $2.5 billion
below projected Senate spending,
meaning that Congress was well on its
way to busting its budget ceiling
before it was even adopted.
Moreover. Bellmon says interest on
the public debt is underestimated by
$1.7 billion, entitlement programs by
$2.5 billion, disaster relief by $1 billion
and other costs by enough to add $11.2
billion more on top of the deficit. In a
letter to President-elect Ronald Re
agan. Bellmon warned of a likely $45-
to-$5O-billion total deficit, only slight
ly less than the $59 billion deficit for
fiscal 1980

The House-Senate budget com
promise was patched together in such
haste, with no relish for any more hag
gling over priorities, that the two
houses simply agreed to disagree on
many criticai details, including basic
economic assumptions and guidelines
for spending cuts.
This has the effect of giving Reagan
and the 97th Congress an unusual
degree of latitude for formulating
spending as well as tax plans from the
start, taking seriously Reagan's an
nounced plans for a spending cut of 2
percent or more as well as a tax cut.
But the function-bv-function spend
ing totals envisoned in the balanced
budget resolution of last spring had an
impact long before the final resolution
was adopted — producing, among oth
er things, defense spending that in
creased more than twice as much as
spending for domestic programs.
And. according to Senate Budget
Committee Chairman Ernest Boilings
<D-S.C ), overall spending actually
declined by 1 4 percent in terms of real
dollars, discounted for inflation. For
most discretionary domestic pro
grams. the real-dollar decrease was
more than 15 percent, he told the Sen
ate last week.
