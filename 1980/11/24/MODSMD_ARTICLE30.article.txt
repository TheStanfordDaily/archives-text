Las Vegas hotel fire kills 83
Las Vegat — The chairman of the board of MGM
Grand Hotels Inc. said yesterday that the failure of
fire alarms in the hotel fire that killed 83 people and
injured more than 500 "may have been a blessing in
disguise" that saved some lives.
Fred Benninger, answering questions at a news
conference, said he believed the fact that fire
alarms did not go off in the fire Friday at the 26-
story hotel may have saved the lives of other guests.
"It may have been a blessing in disguise that it
didn't go off," Benninger said. "A lot of guests
would have gone into the hallways and suffocated
from the smoke. Staying in their rooms may have
saved them."
The death count was 83 yesterday after repeated
room-to-room searches at the MGM, the once-glit
tering Strip centerpiece ravaged by fire and smoke
in the nation's second-worst hotel fire.
Authorities said they believe they have pinpointed
the fire's cause as electrical, but many unanswered
questions remained.
The fire began in electrical circuitry above a deli
catessen on the main floor of the hotel.
The smoldering electrical fire could have been
halted by sprinklers required under current codes,
Fire Capt. Mike Patterson said, but he added,
"Eighty percent of the buildings in the United States
are similarly out of date in their safety procedures."
Italy quake kills 60, injures 150
Naples, Italy— A killer earthquake ripped
through southern Italy yesterday evening, collaps
ing buildings in several cities and crippling com
munication with the stricken region. Police and Ital
ian news reports said more than 60 people perished
and at least 150 were injured.
The national radio and television network re
ported up to 50 people were killed in the small town
of Balvano 75 miles east of Naples.
Some rail links, roads and phone communications
to the area were blocked.
Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport halted traffic
for 40 minutes when air controllers fled their
swaying 195-foot-high control tower.
Eight bodies were removed from a collapsed
building in Potenza, 15 miles east of Balvano, police
said, and a television reporter there said Potenza s
hospital was filled with injured.
Police reported at least eight persons also were
killed in Naples, including a child who suffered skull
fractures when a wall fell on him. An apartment
building here believed to have housed 20 families
collapsed and rescue teams feared some of the ten
ants were killed.
Sadat warns Reagan on Egypt
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
in his first hint of concern, warned President-elect
Ronald Reagan yesterday that his plans for a
harder-line U.S. foreign policy should not penalize
Egypt or else "he will lose us."
Sadat's comment, in an interview distributed by
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency, ap
peared to grow from fears reported in Cairo that the
Reagan administration could allow Egyptian con
cerns — particularly the Palestinian autonomy talks
— to be overshadowed by its desire to reassert
American national interests overseas.

"I want to tell the American people at this mo
ment in particular that when they urge President
Reagan to follow a hard-line policy toward us, he
will lose us and lose our feelings. The American peo
ple should tell Reagan that we are sincere friends ..
and. therefore, we expect the other side to be sin
cere with us and to respect our pride and national
ambitions "
Iran, Iraq each claim success
Baghdad. Iraq — Iraq said yesterday that para
troopers supported by waves of helicopter gunships
smashed an Iranian counterattack on the northern
war front and Iran claimed its forces crushed an
Iraqi attempt to overrun the town of Susangerd to
the south.
Iran's official news agency said Iraqi artillery
bombardment of the giant oil refinery at Abadan
had started new fires and black smoke billowed
from the oil facilities of the besieged Iranian city
near the northern tip of the Persian Gulf.
Olaf Palme of Sweden, a U.N. special envoy seek
ing ways to stop the two-month-old war, was in
Baghdad for talks with Iraqi leaders after Iran re
jected his mission as a "waste of time."
Iraq said 50 Iranians were killed in an attempt to
counterattack Iraqi positions and that four tanks
and three other vehicles were knocked out by Iraqi
helicopters. Iraq also reported 32 enemy dead in
earlier fighting and said 63 more Iranian soldiers
were killed in fighting further south.
Iran claimed that Iraqi troops and tanks tried to
mount a major offensive aimed at Susangerd, pre
ceeded by heavy artillery and mortar bombard
ments. Iran said its forces crushed the Iraqi attack,
"killed large numbers of the enemy" and captured
17 Iraqi soldiers. "The infidels fled in chaos, leaving
behind scores of burning tanks." the Iranian news
agency reported.
Iran: clarify hostage response
Iran asked the United States yesterday to clarify
its response to Iran's conditions for freeing the 52
American hostages, a spokesman for Prime Min
ister Mohammad Ali Rajai said in Tehran.
The Iranian message was delivered to an Algerian
delegation acting as intermediary in the U.S.-Ira
nian negotiations, and Rajai's spokesman told
Western reporters that Iran seeks "clear and ex
plicit answers" from Washington on the four condi
tions set by Iran's Parliament on Nov. 2 for release
of the hostages.
Greek Radio and Television quoted Ahmad Azizi,
public relations director of the prime minister's of
fice, as saying Iran wants a clear answer — "either
positive or negative." The Iranian Parliament's
terms for the release are: unfreezing Iranian assets
in the United States, withdrawal of all private and
public claims against Iran, a pledge of non-in
terference in Iranian affairs and return to Iran of the
late shah of Iran's wealth.
The United States sent a team of officials to Al
giers Nov. 10 to present the American response to
Iran. Details of the American reply were not made
public, but there have been reports that the United
States pointed out that the American government
would have legal and technical problems in halting
public and private legal claims by Americans
against Iran and in confiscating and transferring to
Iran property of the late shah.

Security meeting works on issues
•
Madrid, Spain — After 10 days of rhetoric and pub
lic name calling, delegates to the European security
conference will go behind closed doors this week as
working groups meet on proposals for expanding
East-West cooperation.
The 35-nation conference is reviewing agree
ments signed in Helsinki in 1975 on economic cooper
ation. human rights and cultural ties.
The conference opened Nov. 11 after weeks of hag
gling over an agenda, and the first sessions were
marked by American attacks on Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan and the Soviet record on the human
rights provisions of the agreements.
Chrysler may need more loans
Washington — The new Reagan administration
early next year will be caught between a rock — its
own economic policies — and a hard place — its po
litical interests in the future of Chrysler Corp. and
other troubled American automakers.
Although Reagan endorsed the government bail
out of Chrysler in the presidential campaign, revers
ing his initial position, he has not changed his fun
damental belief that companies should stand on
their own without government backing, aides say.
And Chrysler, the nation s No. 3 automaker, is not
exactly standing on its own. It already has received
$800 million in federally guaranteed loans and soon
will need another transfusion, probably a large
share of the remaining $700 million approved by
Congress.
The new K-cars, on which the company's survival
depends, are selling far below the minimum rate set
out in the company's plan for recovery. The com
pany had hoped to begin making a profit by the end of
this year, but now faces continued losses running
into 1981.
We were glad to see you, Mae
Hollywood — Friends and admirers plan to bid a
final farewell this week to sultry movie queen Mae
West, whose sexy walk and sexy talk made her a
Hollywood legend.
West died Saturday at her home at age 87. She had
spent the past three months in a hospital recuperat
ing from a mild stroke.
In the 19305, West made herself a sex goddess with
her hour-glass figure, brassy blonde hair and sexy
walk. Her image sometimes got her into trouble
and, once, even into jail.
West made her stage debut in vaudeville at 5 in a
singing and dancing act in which she was known as
"Baby Vamp."
Her 1926 appearance in a play called, "Sex," got
her an 80-day term in New York's city jail, but she
went in 1928 she went on to the role of "Diamond
Lil," a character which built the Mae West image.
Her name even found its way into the dictionary
after pilots of the Royal Air Force began calling
their inflatable lifejackets, "Mae Wests," in honor
of her physique.
Today's Weather
Variable clouds with local fog and drizzle this
morning, partly to mostly sunny this afternoon.
Lows in the 40s to low 50s, highs in the 60s. Afternoon
westerly winds to 15 mph.

"killed large numbers of the enemy" and captured
17 Iraqi soldiers. "The infidels fled in chaos, leaving
behind scores of burning tanks." the Iranian news
agency reported.
Iran: clarify hostage response
Iran asked the United States yesterday to clarify
its response to Iran's conditions for freeing the 52
American hostages, a spokesman for Prime Min
ister Mohammad Ali Rajai said in Tehran.
The Iranian message was delivered to an Algerian
delegation acting as intermediary in the U.S.-Ira
nian negotiations, and Rajai's spokesman told
Western reporters that Iran seeks "clear and ex
plicit answers" from Washington on the four condi
tions set by Iran's Parliament on Nov. 2 for release
of the hostages.
Greek Radio and Television quoted Ahmad Azizi,
public relations director of the prime minister's of
fice, as saying Iran wants a clear answer — "either
positive or negative." The Iranian Parliament's
terms for the release are: unfreezing Iranian assets
in the United States, withdrawal of all private and
public claims against Iran, a pledge of non-in
terference in Iranian affairs and return to Iran of the
late shah of Iran's wealth.
The United States sent a team of officials to Al
giers Nov. 10 to present the American response to
Iran. Details of the American reply were not made
public, but there have been reports that the United
States pointed out that the American government
would have legal and technical problems in halting
public and private legal claims by Americans
against Iran and in confiscating and transferring to
Iran property of the late shah.

Security meeting works on issues
•
Madrid, Spain — After 10 days of rhetoric and pub
lic name calling, delegates to the European security
conference will go behind closed doors this week as
working groups meet on proposals for expanding
East-West cooperation.
The 35-nation conference is reviewing agree
ments signed in Helsinki in 1975 on economic cooper
ation. human rights and cultural ties.
The conference opened Nov. 11 after weeks of hag
gling over an agenda, and the first sessions were
marked by American attacks on Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan and the Soviet record on the human
rights provisions of the agreements.
Chrysler may need more loans
Washington — The new Reagan administration
early next year will be caught between a rock — its
own economic policies — and a hard place — its po
litical interests in the future of Chrysler Corp. and
other troubled American automakers.
Although Reagan endorsed the government bail
out of Chrysler in the presidential campaign, revers
ing his initial position, he has not changed his fun
damental belief that companies should stand on
their own without government backing, aides say.
And Chrysler, the nation s No. 3 automaker, is not
exactly standing on its own. It already has received
$800 million in federally guaranteed loans and soon
will need another transfusion, probably a large
share of the remaining $700 million approved by
Congress.
The new K-cars, on which the company's survival
depends, are selling far below the minimum rate set
out in the company's plan for recovery. The com
pany had hoped to begin making a profit by the end of
this year, but now faces continued losses running
into 1981.
We were glad to see you, Mae
Hollywood — Friends and admirers plan to bid a
final farewell this week to sultry movie queen Mae
West, whose sexy walk and sexy talk made her a
Hollywood legend.
West died Saturday at her home at age 87. She had
spent the past three months in a hospital recuperat
ing from a mild stroke.
In the 19305, West made herself a sex goddess with
her hour-glass figure, brassy blonde hair and sexy
walk. Her image sometimes got her into trouble
and, once, even into jail.
West made her stage debut in vaudeville at 5 in a
singing and dancing act in which she was known as
"Baby Vamp."
Her 1926 appearance in a play called, "Sex," got
her an 80-day term in New York's city jail, but she
went in 1928 she went on to the role of "Diamond
Lil," a character which built the Mae West image.
Her name even found its way into the dictionary
after pilots of the Royal Air Force began calling
their inflatable lifejackets, "Mae Wests," in honor
of her physique.

Las Vegas hotel fire kills 83
Las Vegat — The chairman of the board of MGM
Grand Hotels Inc. said yesterday that the failure of
fire alarms in the hotel fire that killed 83 people and
injured more than 500 "may have been a blessing in
disguise" that saved some lives.
Fred Benninger, answering questions at a news
conference, said he believed the fact that fire
alarms did not go off in the fire Friday at the 26-
story hotel may have saved the lives of other guests.
"It may have been a blessing in disguise that it
didn't go off," Benninger said. "A lot of guests
would have gone into the hallways and suffocated
from the smoke. Staying in their rooms may have
saved them."
The death count was 83 yesterday after repeated
room-to-room searches at the MGM, the once-glit
tering Strip centerpiece ravaged by fire and smoke
in the nation's second-worst hotel fire.
Authorities said they believe they have pinpointed
the fire's cause as electrical, but many unanswered
questions remained.
The fire began in electrical circuitry above a deli
catessen on the main floor of the hotel.
The smoldering electrical fire could have been
halted by sprinklers required under current codes,
Fire Capt. Mike Patterson said, but he added,
"Eighty percent of the buildings in the United States
are similarly out of date in their safety procedures."
Italy quake kills 60, injures 150
Naples, Italy— A killer earthquake ripped
through southern Italy yesterday evening, collaps
ing buildings in several cities and crippling com
munication with the stricken region. Police and Ital
ian news reports said more than 60 people perished
and at least 150 were injured.
The national radio and television network re
ported up to 50 people were killed in the small town
of Balvano 75 miles east of Naples.
Some rail links, roads and phone communications
to the area were blocked.
Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport halted traffic
for 40 minutes when air controllers fled their
swaying 195-foot-high control tower.
Eight bodies were removed from a collapsed
building in Potenza, 15 miles east of Balvano, police
said, and a television reporter there said Potenza s
hospital was filled with injured.
Police reported at least eight persons also were
killed in Naples, including a child who suffered skull
fractures when a wall fell on him. An apartment
building here believed to have housed 20 families
collapsed and rescue teams feared some of the ten
ants were killed.
Sadat warns Reagan on Egypt
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
in his first hint of concern, warned President-elect
Ronald Reagan yesterday that his plans for a
harder-line U.S. foreign policy should not penalize
Egypt or else "he will lose us."
Sadat's comment, in an interview distributed by
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency, ap
peared to grow from fears reported in Cairo that the
Reagan administration could allow Egyptian con
cerns — particularly the Palestinian autonomy talks
— to be overshadowed by its desire to reassert
American national interests overseas.

"I want to tell the American people at this mo
ment in particular that when they urge President
Reagan to follow a hard-line policy toward us, he
will lose us and lose our feelings. The American peo
ple should tell Reagan that we are sincere friends ..
and. therefore, we expect the other side to be sin
cere with us and to respect our pride and national
ambitions "
Iran, Iraq each claim success
Baghdad. Iraq — Iraq said yesterday that para
troopers supported by waves of helicopter gunships
smashed an Iranian counterattack on the northern
war front and Iran claimed its forces crushed an
Iraqi attempt to overrun the town of Susangerd to
the south.
Iran's official news agency said Iraqi artillery
bombardment of the giant oil refinery at Abadan
had started new fires and black smoke billowed
from the oil facilities of the besieged Iranian city
near the northern tip of the Persian Gulf.
Olaf Palme of Sweden, a U.N. special envoy seek
ing ways to stop the two-month-old war, was in
Baghdad for talks with Iraqi leaders after Iran re
jected his mission as a "waste of time."
Iraq said 50 Iranians were killed in an attempt to
counterattack Iraqi positions and that four tanks
and three other vehicles were knocked out by Iraqi
helicopters. Iraq also reported 32 enemy dead in
earlier fighting and said 63 more Iranian soldiers
were killed in fighting further south.
Iran claimed that Iraqi troops and tanks tried to
mount a major offensive aimed at Susangerd, pre
ceeded by heavy artillery and mortar bombard
ments. Iran said its forces crushed the Iraqi attack,
"killed large numbers of the enemy" and captured
17 Iraqi soldiers. "The infidels fled in chaos, leaving

Las Vegas hotel fire kills 83
Las Vegat — The chairman of the board of MGM
Grand Hotels Inc. said yesterday that the failure of
fire alarms in the hotel fire that killed 83 people and
injured more than 500 "may have been a blessing in
disguise" that saved some lives.
Fred Benninger, answering questions at a news
conference, said he believed the fact that fire
alarms did not go off in the fire Friday at the 26-
story hotel may have saved the lives of other guests.
"It may have been a blessing in disguise that it
didn't go off," Benninger said. "A lot of guests
would have gone into the hallways and suffocated
from the smoke. Staying in their rooms may have
saved them."
The death count was 83 yesterday after repeated
room-to-room searches at the MGM, the once-glit
tering Strip centerpiece ravaged by fire and smoke
in the nation's second-worst hotel fire.
Authorities said they believe they have pinpointed
the fire's cause as electrical, but many unanswered
questions remained.
The fire began in electrical circuitry above a deli
catessen on the main floor of the hotel.
The smoldering electrical fire could have been
halted by sprinklers required under current codes,
Fire Capt. Mike Patterson said, but he added,
"Eighty percent of the buildings in the United States
are similarly out of date in their safety procedures."
Italy quake kills 60, injures 150
Naples, Italy— A killer earthquake ripped
through southern Italy yesterday evening, collaps
ing buildings in several cities and crippling com
munication with the stricken region. Police and Ital
ian news reports said more than 60 people perished
and at least 150 were injured.
The national radio and television network re
ported up to 50 people were killed in the small town
of Balvano 75 miles east of Naples.
Some rail links, roads and phone communications
to the area were blocked.
Rome's Leonardo da Vinci airport halted traffic
for 40 minutes when air controllers fled their
swaying 195-foot-high control tower.
Eight bodies were removed from a collapsed
building in Potenza, 15 miles east of Balvano, police
said, and a television reporter there said Potenza s
hospital was filled with injured.
Police reported at least eight persons also were
killed in Naples, including a child who suffered skull
fractures when a wall fell on him. An apartment
building here believed to have housed 20 families
collapsed and rescue teams feared some of the ten
ants were killed.
Sadat warns Reagan on Egypt
Washington — Egyptian President Anwar Sadat,
in his first hint of concern, warned President-elect
Ronald Reagan yesterday that his plans for a
harder-line U.S. foreign policy should not penalize
Egypt or else "he will lose us."
Sadat's comment, in an interview distributed by
Egypt's official Middle East News Agency, ap
peared to grow from fears reported in Cairo that the
Reagan administration could allow Egyptian con
cerns — particularly the Palestinian autonomy talks
— to be overshadowed by its desire to reassert
American national interests overseas.

"I want to tell the American people at this mo
ment in particular that when they urge President
Reagan to follow a hard-line policy toward us, he
will lose us and lose our feelings. The American peo
ple should tell Reagan that we are sincere friends ..
and. therefore, we expect the other side to be sin
cere with us and to respect our pride and national
ambitions "
Iran, Iraq each claim success
Baghdad. Iraq — Iraq said yesterday that para
troopers supported by waves of helicopter gunships
smashed an Iranian counterattack on the northern
war front and Iran claimed its forces crushed an
Iraqi attempt to overrun the town of Susangerd to
the south.
Iran's official news agency said Iraqi artillery
bombardment of the giant oil refinery at Abadan
had started new fires and black smoke billowed
from the oil facilities of the besieged Iranian city
near the northern tip of the Persian Gulf.
Olaf Palme of Sweden, a U.N. special envoy seek
ing ways to stop the two-month-old war, was in
Baghdad for talks with Iraqi leaders after Iran re
jected his mission as a "waste of time."
Iraq said 50 Iranians were killed in an attempt to
counterattack Iraqi positions and that four tanks
and three other vehicles were knocked out by Iraqi
helicopters. Iraq also reported 32 enemy dead in
earlier fighting and said 63 more Iranian soldiers
were killed in fighting further south.
Iran claimed that Iraqi troops and tanks tried to
mount a major offensive aimed at Susangerd, pre
ceeded by heavy artillery and mortar bombard
ments. Iran said its forces crushed the Iraqi attack,
"killed large numbers of the enemy" and captured
17 Iraqi soldiers. "The infidels fled in chaos, leaving
behind scores of burning tanks." the Iranian news
agency reported.
Iran: clarify hostage response
Iran asked the United States yesterday to clarify
its response to Iran's conditions for freeing the 52
American hostages, a spokesman for Prime Min
ister Mohammad Ali Rajai said in Tehran.
The Iranian message was delivered to an Algerian
delegation acting as intermediary in the U.S.-Ira
nian negotiations, and Rajai's spokesman told
Western reporters that Iran seeks "clear and ex
plicit answers" from Washington on the four condi
tions set by Iran's Parliament on Nov. 2 for release
of the hostages.
Greek Radio and Television quoted Ahmad Azizi,
public relations director of the prime minister's of
fice, as saying Iran wants a clear answer — "either
positive or negative." The Iranian Parliament's
terms for the release are: unfreezing Iranian assets
in the United States, withdrawal of all private and
public claims against Iran, a pledge of non-in
terference in Iranian affairs and return to Iran of the
late shah of Iran's wealth.
The United States sent a team of officials to Al
giers Nov. 10 to present the American response to
Iran. Details of the American reply were not made
public, but there have been reports that the United
States pointed out that the American government
would have legal and technical problems in halting
public and private legal claims by Americans
against Iran and in confiscating and transferring to
Iran property of the late shah.

Security meeting works on issues
•
Madrid, Spain — After 10 days of rhetoric and pub
lic name calling, delegates to the European security
conference will go behind closed doors this week as
working groups meet on proposals for expanding
East-West cooperation.
The 35-nation conference is reviewing agree
ments signed in Helsinki in 1975 on economic cooper
ation. human rights and cultural ties.
The conference opened Nov. 11 after weeks of hag
gling over an agenda, and the first sessions were
marked by American attacks on Soviet intervention
in Afghanistan and the Soviet record on the human
rights provisions of the agreements.
Chrysler may need more loans
Washington — The new Reagan administration
early next year will be caught between a rock — its
own economic policies — and a hard place — its po
litical interests in the future of Chrysler Corp. and
other troubled American automakers.
Although Reagan endorsed the government bail
out of Chrysler in the presidential campaign, revers
ing his initial position, he has not changed his fun
damental belief that companies should stand on
their own without government backing, aides say.
And Chrysler, the nation s No. 3 automaker, is not
exactly standing on its own. It already has received
$800 million in federally guaranteed loans and soon
will need another transfusion, probably a large
share of the remaining $700 million approved by
Congress.
The new K-cars, on which the company's survival
depends, are selling far below the minimum rate set
out in the company's plan for recovery. The com
pany had hoped to begin making a profit by the end of
this year, but now faces continued losses running
into 1981.
We were glad to see you, Mae
Hollywood — Friends and admirers plan to bid a
final farewell this week to sultry movie queen Mae
West, whose sexy walk and sexy talk made her a
Hollywood legend.
West died Saturday at her home at age 87. She had
spent the past three months in a hospital recuperat
ing from a mild stroke.
In the 19305, West made herself a sex goddess with
her hour-glass figure, brassy blonde hair and sexy
walk. Her image sometimes got her into trouble
and, once, even into jail.
West made her stage debut in vaudeville at 5 in a
singing and dancing act in which she was known as
"Baby Vamp."
Her 1926 appearance in a play called, "Sex," got
her an 80-day term in New York's city jail, but she
went in 1928 she went on to the role of "Diamond
Lil," a character which built the Mae West image.
Her name even found its way into the dictionary
after pilots of the Royal Air Force began calling
their inflatable lifejackets, "Mae Wests," in honor
of her physique.
Today's Weather
Variable clouds with local fog and drizzle this
morning, partly to mostly sunny this afternoon.
Lows in the 40s to low 50s, highs in the 60s. Afternoon
westerly winds to 15 mph.
