# Whales die in Florida
## 
### 
St. Augustine, Fla. (AP) — Ten
sperm whales were found dead in a
shallow inlet in northern Florida and
puzzled biologists said yesterday the
mammals may have gotten lost on
their way back to deep seas.
But preliminary studies of the
carcasses revealed no clear cause for
Saturday's mass beaching in
Camachee Cove, just a narrow inlet
away from the safe, deep water of the
Atlantic Ocean, the experts said.
They were as puzzled over the
beaching as they were last year when
41 huge sperm whales died after com
ing ashore near Florence, Ore.
"These are normally a deep-ocean
whale," said Ed Asper, a marine
biologist and curator of a marine at
traction near Orlando, Fla. "Why they
headed this way is a question mark."
One would-be rescuer described the
sperm whales as "the kind you think of
when you think of Moby Dick."
The whales entered the inlet near
this coastal town shortly after day
break Saturday and were dead within
13 hours, despite attempts to herd
them back to deeper water. They
ranged in length from 14 to just over 30
feet, and the largest weighed as much
as six or seven tons.
Initial reports indicated as many as
15 whales entered the inlet.

Asper, fellow workers from Ocean
World Inc. and other marine experts
from state and federal agencies spent
the night cutting open the 10 whales
stranded in the cove, taking tissue
samples and vital organs.
"We didn't find anything obvious,"
Asper said. "It will be a couple of
weeks before we get any results from
the tissue studies."
Even then, he said, there may be no
clear picture on why the whales
beached themselves.
Beachings by deep-water animals
such as sperm whales and certain
species of dolphins occur from time to
time but are not common, Asper said.
Beachings by shallow-water or
coastal animals, such as pilot whales
and dolphins, are more common.
