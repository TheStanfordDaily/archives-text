# Presidential education policy changes forseen
## 
### Brad Crystal 
President-elect Ronald Reagan's
program for education should re
semble the restrained, laissez-faire
approach of the Nixon administration
as opposed to President Jimmy
Carter's activism, according to
Education Professor Michael Kirst, a
leading education spokesman at Stan
ford s Center for Advanced Studies in
the Behavioral Sciences.
"I think Reagan's policies on educa
tion will be very similar to those of
President (Richard) Nixon's," said
Kirst, an education adviser to the
Johnson administration.
Regan can be expected to loosen
federal regulations, restrict budg
etary increases, grant greater auton
omy to state and local authorities, and
put less emphasis on public school in
tegration and bilingual education pro
grams, Kirst said.
Kirst said Carter played "too pre
scriptive" a role in controlling educa
tion by creating excess federal regu
lation.
Too many rules
"The Democrats just went too far
with government regulation and
they've set themselves up for a coun
terreaction from the education com
munity," he said.
Reagan may pursue the opposite ex
treme. he warned.

"As I see it, the Reagan adminis
tration will have too little federal
presence in education and will be too
compliant and accommodating to
state and local wishes and whims," he
said
"One thing we can say about this
election for sure." said Kirst, "is that
the National Education Association's
dream — that the federal share of the
public education budget would in
crease from, say. 8 percent to 20
percent or even a third — is down the
drain for the foreseeable future."
Department to go
Calling Keagan a man true to his
commitments. Kirst predicted he will
act quickly to abolish the Department
of Education, established by Carter
one year ago. Conservatives saw the
department's creation as unhealthy
government centralization.
Kirst said the short-term benefits of
the department are almost nil but in
the long run it could "provide more co
ordinated administration, give the
field of education a better and more
direct line to the White House and
create a more coherent national lead
ership."
Kirst said he does not believe those
benefits will be sufficient to change
Reagan's rrund about dismantling the
department.
"My experience with Reagan out
here is that when he makes a very spe
cific commitment, he tries very hard
and he follows through with it — and
he has made a very specific commit
ment to abolish the Department of
Education."
Private school tax cut
Whether Reagan will follow through
on a campaign proposal to implement
tuition tax credits for parents sending
their children to private schools is less
certain, Kirst said.
Kirst said tuition credits would
create "a tremendous amount of con
troversy" because they are a "decla
ration of war on the elementary and
secondary education establishment."
Those arguing against the tax cred
its say they would encourage well-to
do families to remove their children
from public schools.
Tax credits would "spur private
education at a time when public
education is really vulnerable in
terms of public support," said Kirst.
These tax credits received mixed
reviews at the college level, said
Kirst, although Stanford adminis
trators consistently oppose them.
Many educational observers believe
tuition tax credits would force drastic
cutbacks in financial aid to students
from lower and middle income fami

lies.
To finance tax credits the govern
ment would "have to take monies out
of programs that are genuinely valu
able. such as need-based financial aid
grants." said Robert Kosenzweig.
University vice president for public
affairs.
"Tax credits would make it harder
for us to attract and finance needy stu
dents." he warned.
But the tax proposal may be thrown
out of the federal budget anyway.
Large government spending needed
to finance the credits may ultimately
determine how forcefully Reagan at
tempts to win Congressional enact
ment. said Kirst.
"This is not a commitment of Re
agan's. He thinks credits are a good
idea, but he's not sure they can be im
plemented in the current economic
conditions (in which) we find
ourselves," he said.
The Reagan camp, however, re
mained silent last week on its pro
gram for education.
In an interview with the Daily Fri
day, W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution and chairman
of Reagan's education policy task
force, refused to disclose what recom
mendations the task force will make
in its report.
"We operate under strict secrecy,"
said Campbell.

Education Professor Michael Kirst, a
leading education spokesman at Stan
ford s Center for Advanced Studies in
the Behavioral Sciences.
"I think Reagan's policies on educa
tion will be very similar to those of
President (Richard) Nixon's," said
Kirst, an education adviser to the
Johnson administration.
Regan can be expected to loosen
federal regulations, restrict budg
etary increases, grant greater auton
omy to state and local authorities, and
put less emphasis on public school in
tegration and bilingual education pro
grams, Kirst said.
Kirst said Carter played "too pre
scriptive" a role in controlling educa
tion by creating excess federal regu
lation.
Too many rules
"The Democrats just went too far
with government regulation and
they've set themselves up for a coun
terreaction from the education com
munity," he said.
Reagan may pursue the opposite ex
treme. he warned.

"As I see it, the Reagan adminis
tration will have too little federal
presence in education and will be too
compliant and accommodating to
state and local wishes and whims," he
said
"One thing we can say about this
election for sure." said Kirst, "is that
the National Education Association's
dream — that the federal share of the
public education budget would in
crease from, say. 8 percent to 20
percent or even a third — is down the
drain for the foreseeable future."
Department to go
Calling Keagan a man true to his
commitments. Kirst predicted he will
act quickly to abolish the Department
of Education, established by Carter
one year ago. Conservatives saw the
department's creation as unhealthy
government centralization.
Kirst said the short-term benefits of
the department are almost nil but in
the long run it could "provide more co
ordinated administration, give the
field of education a better and more
direct line to the White House and
create a more coherent national lead
ership."
Kirst said he does not believe those
benefits will be sufficient to change
Reagan's rrund about dismantling the
department.
"My experience with Reagan out
here is that when he makes a very spe
cific commitment, he tries very hard
and he follows through with it — and
he has made a very specific commit
ment to abolish the Department of
Education."
Private school tax cut
Whether Reagan will follow through
on a campaign proposal to implement
tuition tax credits for parents sending
their children to private schools is less
certain, Kirst said.
Kirst said tuition credits would
create "a tremendous amount of con
troversy" because they are a "decla
ration of war on the elementary and
secondary education establishment."
Those arguing against the tax cred
its say they would encourage well-to
do families to remove their children
from public schools.
Tax credits would "spur private
education at a time when public
education is really vulnerable in
terms of public support," said Kirst.
These tax credits received mixed
reviews at the college level, said
Kirst, although Stanford adminis
trators consistently oppose them.
Many educational observers believe
tuition tax credits would force drastic
cutbacks in financial aid to students
from lower and middle income fami

lies.
To finance tax credits the govern
ment would "have to take monies out
of programs that are genuinely valu
able. such as need-based financial aid
grants." said Robert Kosenzweig.
University vice president for public
affairs.
"Tax credits would make it harder
for us to attract and finance needy stu
dents." he warned.
But the tax proposal may be thrown
out of the federal budget anyway.
Large government spending needed
to finance the credits may ultimately
determine how forcefully Reagan at
tempts to win Congressional enact
ment. said Kirst.
"This is not a commitment of Re
agan's. He thinks credits are a good
idea, but he's not sure they can be im
plemented in the current economic
conditions (in which) we find
ourselves," he said.
The Reagan camp, however, re
mained silent last week on its pro
gram for education.
In an interview with the Daily Fri
day, W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution and chairman
of Reagan's education policy task
force, refused to disclose what recom
mendations the task force will make
in its report.
"We operate under strict secrecy,"
said Campbell.
President-elect Ronald Reagan's
program for education should re
semble the restrained, laissez-faire
approach of the Nixon administration
as opposed to President Jimmy
Carter's activism, according to
