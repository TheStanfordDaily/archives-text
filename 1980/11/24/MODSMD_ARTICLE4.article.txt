# Presidential education policy changes forseen

### Brad Crystal 
President-elect Ronald Reagan's
program for education should re
semble the restrained, laissez-faire
approach of the Nixon administration
as opposed to President Jimmy
Carter's activism, according to
Education Professor Michael Kirst, a
leading education spokesman at Stan
ford s Center for Advanced Studies in
the Behavioral Sciences.
"I think Reagan's policies on educa
tion will be very similar to those of
President (Richard) Nixon's," said
Kirst, an education adviser to the
Johnson administration.
Regan can be expected to loosen
federal regulations, restrict budg
etary increases, grant greater auton
omy to state and local authorities, and
put less emphasis on public school in
tegration and bilingual education pro
grams, Kirst said.
Kirst said Carter played "too pre
scriptive" a role in controlling educa
tion by creating excess federal regu
lation.
Too many rules
"The Democrats just went too far
with government regulation and
they've set themselves up for a coun
terreaction from the education com
munity," he said.
Reagan may pursue the opposite ex
treme. he warned.

"As I see it, the Reagan adminis
tration will have too little federal
presence in education and will be too
compliant and accommodating to
state and local wishes and whims," he
said
"One thing we can say about this
election for sure." said Kirst, "is that
the National Education Association's
dream — that the federal share of the
public education budget would in
crease from, say. 8 percent to 20
percent or even a third — is down the
drain for the foreseeable future."
Department to go
Calling Keagan a man true to his
commitments. Kirst predicted he will
act quickly to abolish the Department
of Education, established by Carter
one year ago. Conservatives saw the
department's creation as unhealthy
government centralization.
Kirst said the short-term benefits of
the department are almost nil but in
the long run it could "provide more co
ordinated administration, give the
field of education a better and more
direct line to the White House and
create a more coherent national lead
ership."
Kirst said he does not believe those
benefits will be sufficient to change
Reagan's rrund about dismantling the
department.
