# New interest in old records
## Reagan files reside at Hoover Institution 
### Alan Crystal 
For five days this fall, members of
the Democratic National Committee
(L)NC) pored over Hoover Institution
archives. In particular, they sifted
through eight cubic feet of documents
collected during Ronald Reagan's
governorship in California.
Molly Sturges, curator of the collec
tion. said that ever since Reagan's
campaign for president, "interest in
the collection has risen tremen
dously .'' The number of people looking

into the documents has doubled, she
said.
Reagan donated his official papers
to the Hoover Institution in 1975. The
collection includes about 1634 linear
feet of speeches, press conferences
and press releasesfrom Reagan'sgov
ernorship â€” 21 tons of material in all.
The huge quantity of documents
prompted the Hoover Institution to
find someone familiar with them to
take charge. The Institution asked
Sturges to take charge of the papers

because she collected them originally.
Reagan hired Sturges in 1973 to col
lect information on his governorship.
She said Reagan gave her "carte
blanche" to learn all she could about
the administration, permitting her to
sit in on meetings, interview members
of Reagan's cabinet, and, eventually,
gather a truckload of documents.
"When the truckload arrived at
Stanford. I was the only one who knew
exactly what information was in
which box," Sturges said.

Sturges said she was best qualified
to retrieve information from the docu
ments since she collected them.
"If someone calls in to ask about
Reagan's stand on pesticides, for ex
ample,'' she said, "I know where to
look for that information. - '
Sturges said most of the recent jn
terest in the documents has been from
voters who want specific information.
"Many times John Q. Citizen calls in
to ask for Reagan's stand on some top
ic." she said, "and I honor specific re
quests whenever I can."
Political groups also have been in
terested in the papers, she said Both
the DNC and the Reagan Campaign
Committee had access to the docu
ments during the presidential cam
paign.
Sturges said she has access to the
public collection, but she must get per
mission from Reagan trustees to give
out information from the private col
lection. However, she said, most peo
ple. including the DNC, are satisfied
with information from the public col
lection
"People don't need access to the
private papers unless they are doing
in-depth research on Reagan's gov
ernorship," she said Students work
ing on master's or doctoral theses
sometimes need information from the
private collection.
Sturges said the collection will
always be open to students Reagan s
papers are no longer the president
elect's property and cannot be taken
back if in the future Reagan decides to
open a presidential library.
Rut copies of the documents may be
given to Reagan if he opens such a li
brary. she said
Sturges said she enjoys retrieving
information from the collection. "It's
like a marvelously big jigsaw puzzle
that you re constantly piecing togeth
er."
