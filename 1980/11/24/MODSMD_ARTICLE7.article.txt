# Government power consolidating
## Violence increasing in Nicaragua 
### 
Managua, Nicaragua — The
killing of one of Nicaragua's
most prominent business lead
ers by government security
agents, amid allegations that he
was involved in a massive plot
to overthrow Sandinista rule,
has provoked the most severe
crisis here since the revolution
16 months ago.
Talk of cooperation between
the private sector and the leftist
government — vitally needed to
restore the battered economy —
has given way to bitterly
divisive charges of political
crimes and coup attempts, pro
voking a level of tension and
mistrust many Nicaraguans had
hoped was gone with the defeat
of dictator Anastasio Somoza.
At a news conference Satur
day, the Sandinista chief of
state security. Lenin Cerna. at
tempted to clear up some of the
circumstances surrounding the
death last Tuesday of Jorge
Salazar, 41, vice president of the
influential Superior Council of
Private Enterprise.
Cerna presented three al
leged conspirators, who con
fessed to working with Salazar
in an attempt to obtain arms and
enlist the cooperation of ele
ments inside and outside the
country to launch a coup this
month.
One of the three, Leonardo
Somarriba, himself an influen
tial businessman, said he and
Salazar arranged meetings with
some of Somoza s former com
manders as well as with the for
eign minister of El Salvador,
Fidel Chavez Mena, and
Salvadoran junta member
Jaime Abdul Gutierrez in unsuc
cessful attempts to generate
support for the coup.
The attempt would have in

cluded an invasion by pro-
Somoza exiles and an internal
uprising, Cerna said. But he did
not explain the exact circum
stances in which Salazar was
killed — an act that private sec
tor leaders here have said
"shows all the characteristics
of a political crime."
According to the official ver
sion of Salazar's death, he was
meeting with Ernesto Montada
at a gas station outside of Mana
gua when the two of them were
surprised by Sandinista security
agents.
Montada allegedly fired a
pistol. The security agent also
fired. Montada was captured
unhurt. Salazar. described as
unarmed, was shot seven times.
Only later were six automatic
rifles allegedly discovered in
the back of his car.
It was by mere accident that
Salazar was killed and Montada
lived, according to Cerna and
other officials.
But few of Salazar's friends
and acquaintances accept that
account.
"Whether Jorge was involved
in a plot or not," said one as
sociate of Salazar's, "you don't
kill a guy who was unarmed.
And if Jorge Salazar was in
volved it shows the desperation
of people like him."
Desperation has indeed been
growing among former sup
porters of the Sandinistas — es
pecially the private sector — for
several months. The economy
has failed to reach the projected
levels. Production is off. And
political freedoms are rapidly
diminishing.
Since the Sandinista guer
rilla-led revolutionaries cele
brated their first year of the
revolution July 19 with a

massive rally and a display of
military organization.
Nicaragua has taken several
steps to consolidate power while
increasingly restricting the op
position.
It had been expected that on
July 19 the Sandinistas would
announce a fixed date for an
election. They did not.
Instead, on Aug. 23 it was an
nounced that elections would
not be held until 1985 and that no
campaigning would be allowed
until 1984. the economic situ
ation was given as the reason for
the delay.
On Nov. 9. opposition leader
Alfonso Hobelo. a former mem
ber of the five-person revolu
tionary junta, was forbidden to
hold a rally at the town of Nan
baime. Shortly thereafter, a
Sandinista youth group sacked
the offices of Robelo's
Nicaraguan Democratic Move
ment in Managua.
On Nov. 17. U.S. Ambassador
Lawrence Pezzullo said, "It's a
much more brittle Nicaragua
than it was six months ago. The
level of compromise is lower.
The situation could easily de
generate and just get more and
more fractionalized."
Arturo Cruz, the middle-of
the-road non-Sandinista who re
placed Robelo on the junta, said
Friday that there is indeed a
problem of credibility on both
sides now.
"It's true that the govern
ment has hardened its posi
tion,' said Cruz, "but mostly in
response to the private sector's
attitude. Sometimes the dissen
ters create a situation where the
revolutionary leadership might
feel — I hate to use the word —
blackmailed."

No one here sees an im
mediate solution to the crisis
and no one seems certain of
where it will lead. As newspaper
editor Pedro Chamorro, the ob
ject of many gov§rnment at
tacks because of his paper's out
spoken opposition to the Sand
inista leadership and some of its
policies, said, "1981 will be a
vear of crisis."

in an attempt to obtain arms and
enlist the cooperation of ele
ments inside and outside the
country to launch a coup this
month.
One of the three, Leonardo
Somarriba, himself an influen
tial businessman, said he and
Salazar arranged meetings with
some of Somoza s former com
manders as well as with the for
eign minister of El Salvador,
Fidel Chavez Mena, and
Salvadoran junta member
Jaime Abdul Gutierrez in unsuc
cessful attempts to generate
support for the coup.
The attempt would have in

cluded an invasion by pro-
Somoza exiles and an internal
uprising, Cerna said. But he did
not explain the exact circum
stances in which Salazar was
killed — an act that private sec
tor leaders here have said
"shows all the characteristics
of a political crime."
According to the official ver
sion of Salazar's death, he was
meeting with Ernesto Montada
at a gas station outside of Mana
gua when the two of them were
surprised by Sandinista security
agents.
Montada allegedly fired a
pistol. The security agent also
fired. Montada was captured
unhurt. Salazar. described as
unarmed, was shot seven times.
Only later were six automatic
rifles allegedly discovered in
the back of his car.
It was by mere accident that
Salazar was killed and Montada
lived, according to Cerna and
other officials.
But few of Salazar's friends
and acquaintances accept that
account.
"Whether Jorge was involved
in a plot or not," said one as
sociate of Salazar's, "you don't
kill a guy who was unarmed.
And if Jorge Salazar was in
volved it shows the desperation
of people like him."
Desperation has indeed been
growing among former sup
porters of the Sandinistas — es
pecially the private sector — for
several months. The economy
has failed to reach the projected
levels. Production is off. And
political freedoms are rapidly
diminishing.
Since the Sandinista guer
rilla-led revolutionaries cele
brated their first year of the
revolution July 19 with a

massive rally and a display of
military organization.
Nicaragua has taken several
steps to consolidate power while
increasingly restricting the op
position.
It had been expected that on
July 19 the Sandinistas would
announce a fixed date for an
election. They did not.
Instead, on Aug. 23 it was an
nounced that elections would
not be held until 1985 and that no
campaigning would be allowed
until 1984. the economic situ
ation was given as the reason for
the delay.
On Nov. 9. opposition leader
Alfonso Hobelo. a former mem
ber of the five-person revolu
tionary junta, was forbidden to
hold a rally at the town of Nan
baime. Shortly thereafter, a
Sandinista youth group sacked
the offices of Robelo's
Nicaraguan Democratic Move
ment in Managua.
On Nov. 17. U.S. Ambassador
Lawrence Pezzullo said, "It's a
much more brittle Nicaragua
than it was six months ago. The
level of compromise is lower.
The situation could easily de
generate and just get more and
more fractionalized."
Arturo Cruz, the middle-of
the-road non-Sandinista who re
placed Robelo on the junta, said
Friday that there is indeed a
problem of credibility on both
sides now.
"It's true that the govern
ment has hardened its posi
tion,' said Cruz, "but mostly in
response to the private sector's
attitude. Sometimes the dissen
ters create a situation where the
revolutionary leadership might
feel — I hate to use the word —
blackmailed."

No one here sees an im
mediate solution to the crisis
and no one seems certain of
where it will lead. As newspaper
editor Pedro Chamorro, the ob
ject of many gov§rnment at
tacks because of his paper's out
spoken opposition to the Sand
inista leadership and some of its
policies, said, "1981 will be a
vear of crisis."
Managua, Nicaragua — The
killing of one of Nicaragua's
most prominent business lead
ers by government security
agents, amid allegations that he
was involved in a massive plot
to overthrow Sandinista rule,
has provoked the most severe
crisis here since the revolution
16 months ago.
Talk of cooperation between
the private sector and the leftist
government — vitally needed to
restore the battered economy —
has given way to bitterly
divisive charges of political
crimes and coup attempts, pro
voking a level of tension and
mistrust many Nicaraguans had
hoped was gone with the defeat
of dictator Anastasio Somoza.
At a news conference Satur
day, the Sandinista chief of
state security. Lenin Cerna. at
tempted to clear up some of the
circumstances surrounding the
death last Tuesday of Jorge
Salazar, 41, vice president of the
influential Superior Council of
Private Enterprise.
Cerna presented three al
leged conspirators, who con
fessed to working with Salazar
