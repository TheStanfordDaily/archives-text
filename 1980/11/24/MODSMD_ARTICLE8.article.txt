# Major rifts threaten unity at Arab summit meeting
## 
### Washington Post 
Amman, Jordan — Arab foreign ministers de
cided here Saturday to go ahead with next week's
scheduled unity summit conference of Arab heads
of state, despite Syrian demands for a post
ponement that would allow bitter disputes among
the Arab states to be resolved first.
Immediately after the decision was made to go
ahead with the summit talks here next Tuesday,
Syrian Foreign Minister Abdel Halim Khaddam
announced that President Hafez Assad would not
attend.
Khaddam also said he was calling a meeting in
Damascus of representatives of Algeria, Libya,
South Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization — the so-called Steadfastness Front —
plus Lebanon, to urge their leaders to join Syria in
boycotting the summit. If they did, their absence
would greatly diminish the Amman summit's
aims of presenting united and coordinated Arab
front facing Israel and the world.
Farouk Khaddoumi, the PLO's representative
at the foreign ministers conference that has been
meeting here since Tuesday, and who supported
Syria's call for a summit postponement, said Sat
urday that the PLC's 15-member executive com
mittee would also hold a meeting in Damascus
this weekend to determine whether PLO Chair
man Yasser Arafat would attend the summit or
join the boycott.
The Syrian decision not to attend the con
ference lias put the PLO in a particularly difficult
position. It generally supports Syria, which domi
nates the PLO leadership, but it is being pres
sured to attend the conference by Saudi Arabia
and other Arab oil states who subsidize the PLO's
operations.
Despite the rift in the facade of Arab unity
created by the Syrian action Saturday, summit
conference officials insisted on calling the foreign
ministers' meeting a resounding success because
not only had a decision been made to hold the sum
mit as planned but also two basic documents on a
long-term joint Arab political and economic
strategy were approved unanimously — including
bv Syria.

The two policy documents are expected to be
adopted with little change by the Arab kings,
sheikhs and presidents who will attend the sum
mit and will become the expressed basis of Arab
political and economic strategy in the region and
the world at large for at least the next half decade,
Conference delegates hailed the strategy plans
as a major step toward strengthening Arab unity
bv formulating plans for the coordination of joint
political action in the future in the Arab world's
confrontation with Israel as well as in its dealings
with the West. It also is to establish plans for
creating a balanced and independent Arab econo
my.
"What will make this conference a historic
event," said conference spokesman Naif Mawla,
is that "in the past our summits have taken ac
tions as reactions to other events that have af
fected us, like Camp David. This time we are tak
ing the initiative and formulating our own
strategy and policies for the future."
Syria and its Steadfastness Front allies, Alger
ia, Libya, South Yemen and the PLO, played a key
role in formulating the two strategy documents in
the foreign ministers' meeting here.
Syria's opposition to the summit conference
stemmed not from its stated aim of formulating
such joint Arab policies for confronting Israel and
its foreign supporters, most notably the United
States, but from Assad's unwillingness to attend a
conference with his Iraqi rival, President Saddam
Hussein.
Because of Syria's longstanding differences
with Iraq, ruled by a rival branch of the Baath So
cialist Party, Syria has supported Iran in its war
with Iraq. Syria's ally, Libya, as well as Algeria
and South Yemen have also sided with Iran, a non-
Arab but Moslem nation. Arab analysts here said
that, aside from the explosiveness of the
chemistry between Assad and Hussein, the Syrian
president, faced with major economic and politi
cal problems at home, also did not want to attend
a summit in which his isolation among the majori
ty of his fellow Arabs might be shown up publicly
because of his support of Iran in its fight against a
fellow Arab.

The Syrian decision not to attend the con
ference lias put the PLO in a particularly difficult
position. It generally supports Syria, which domi
nates the PLO leadership, but it is being pres
sured to attend the conference by Saudi Arabia
and other Arab oil states who subsidize the PLO's
operations.
Despite the rift in the facade of Arab unity
created by the Syrian action Saturday, summit
conference officials insisted on calling the foreign
ministers' meeting a resounding success because
not only had a decision been made to hold the sum
mit as planned but also two basic documents on a
long-term joint Arab political and economic
strategy were approved unanimously — including
bv Syria.

The two policy documents are expected to be
adopted with little change by the Arab kings,
sheikhs and presidents who will attend the sum
mit and will become the expressed basis of Arab
political and economic strategy in the region and
the world at large for at least the next half decade,
Conference delegates hailed the strategy plans
as a major step toward strengthening Arab unity
bv formulating plans for the coordination of joint
political action in the future in the Arab world's
confrontation with Israel as well as in its dealings
with the West. It also is to establish plans for
creating a balanced and independent Arab econo
my.
"What will make this conference a historic
event," said conference spokesman Naif Mawla,
is that "in the past our summits have taken ac
tions as reactions to other events that have af
fected us, like Camp David. This time we are tak
ing the initiative and formulating our own
strategy and policies for the future."
Syria and its Steadfastness Front allies, Alger
ia, Libya, South Yemen and the PLO, played a key
role in formulating the two strategy documents in
the foreign ministers' meeting here.
Syria's opposition to the summit conference
stemmed not from its stated aim of formulating
such joint Arab policies for confronting Israel and
its foreign supporters, most notably the United
States, but from Assad's unwillingness to attend a
conference with his Iraqi rival, President Saddam
Hussein.
Because of Syria's longstanding differences
with Iraq, ruled by a rival branch of the Baath So
cialist Party, Syria has supported Iran in its war
with Iraq. Syria's ally, Libya, as well as Algeria
and South Yemen have also sided with Iran, a non-
Arab but Moslem nation. Arab analysts here said
that, aside from the explosiveness of the
chemistry between Assad and Hussein, the Syrian
president, faced with major economic and politi
cal problems at home, also did not want to attend
a summit in which his isolation among the majori
ty of his fellow Arabs might be shown up publicly
because of his support of Iran in its fight against a
fellow Arab.
