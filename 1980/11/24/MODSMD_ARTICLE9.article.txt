# China hopes for cooperation with Reagan
## 
### 
Beijing — The Chinese government has
made a new offer to cooperate with the in
coming Reagan administration but has
coupled it with a sharp warning that the ap
proval of new arms sales to Taiwan by
Washington will endanger Chinese-Ameri
can diplomatic ties.
In the first extended comment by a senior
Chinese official on Sino-American relations
since Ronald Reagan's election, Vice For
eign Minister Zhang Wenjin acknowledged
in an interview last week that China was
concerned that the United States might go
too far in selling new arms to Taiwan after
the change of power in Washington Jan. 20.
On another subject, Zhang indicated pub
licly for the first time that China was pre
pared to lessen its political support for the
Khmer Rouge forces of Pol Pot if this move
would get Vietnam to end its military oc
cupation of Cambodia. But he ruled out a
deal that would totally exclude the Khmer
Rouge.
Zhang, the Foreign Ministry's top official
on American affairs, made the remarks in a
relaxed 90-minute interview in a reception
room of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
Problem areas
Washington's response to Taiwan's direct
appeal to the American president-elect
earlier this month for more sophisticated
fighter aircraft was cited as one of several
potential problem areas in foreign policy
that Beijing will be watching to determine
the new administration's over all inten

tions. Others included:
— Expanded military cooperation with
Beijing. Zhang said China needs modern de
fense technology to counter Soviet ex
pansionism in Asia, and hoped the United
States will make it available soon.
— Continued U.S. encouragement of
Japan to continue increasing its defense
spending.
— Increased pressure on Vietnam to get
out of Cambodia and more support for Cam
bodian resistance forces, which could bene
fit by uniting behind someone other than Pol
Pot's forces.
— A new American determination to con
front what Zhang described as the Soviet
drive south into the Persian Gulf and the
Middle East. He said the Reagan adminis
tration should show more understanding for
the Arab case if it wants to bring peace to
the Middle East.
Reaffirmation of relations
Zhang confirmed that recent press
statements offering to work with Reagan
despite his campaign promises of closer ties
with Taiwan constitute an official hope that
the new administration as one of its first ac
tions will reaffirm the 1979 agreement that
normalized relations and the Shanghai com
munique of 1972, which formally ended
three decades of hostility.
But he indicated that China believes it is
the time for ending all American arms
shipments to Taiwan, and that any increase
in the sophistication of arms delivered will

seriously affect the ties between Washing
ton and Beijing.
Echoing commentaries issued earlier
this year by the official New China News
Agency, Zhang said that any arms de
liveries at all violated the normalization
agreement, which Zhang helped negotiate.
He said that the United States had told Beij
ing that the problem of arms deliveries to
Taiwan would disappear with the passage of
time.
Americans who think China is so fright
ened of the Soviet Union that it will accept
any move the' United States makes are seri
ously mistaken, he said. United States of
ficials had to be aware that the benefits of
normalization are as important for Ameri
ca as for China, he said.
He did not offer specifics, but he said at
one point that meeting the Soviet global mil
itary threat was the basis for the relations
between the United States and China.
He also returned several times to the con
tinuing war in Cambodia, saying the United
States had to pressure Vietnam and the So
viet Union to seek an end to the war.
China has strongly supported the Khmer
Rouge since Vietnam's 1979 invasion of its
Southeast Asian neighbor. But visits here in
recent weeks by the prime ministers of
Thailand and Singapore suggest that Beij
ing is having trouble getting other countries
to continue extending diplomatic recog
nition of the Pol Pot government because of
its controversial human rights record.
