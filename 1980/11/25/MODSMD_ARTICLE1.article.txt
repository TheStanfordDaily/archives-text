From the Daily wire services
Naples, Italy — The death toll
climbed above 1000 yesterday in the
earthquake that spread destruction
and terror in poverty-stricken south
ern Italy. Rescuers searched 97 dam
aged towns, villages and cities for
more victims from Italy's worst
quake in 50 years.
The government said rescue work
ers reported they had found 1 012 bod
ies by last night. Several thousand
people were reported injured in the
quake that hit Sunday night.
Thousands more were homeless.
Rescue efforts were hampered by
blocked roads, downed telephone lines
and heavy fog. But as rescuers
reached isolated mountain areas east
of Naples, the full scope of the disaster
became clear.
Damage spread over 10,156 square
miles, an area including Naples,
Salerno. Mount Vesuvius and the ruins
of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
The village of Balvano, 60 miles
east of Naples, was badly hit.
Searchers found 59 bodies, half of
them children, and said about 100 peo
ple were missing. Most of those killed
were crushed when the roof of the
Church of Santa Maria Assunta caved
in during evening Mass.
"There was a terrible shaking,
clouds of dust so thick we couldn't
see," said Angela Enza, a widow clad
in the black dress, scarf and black
stockings traditional in Italy's under
developed south. "They screamed, oh
did they scream, it was worse than
hell," she said.
Reports from Sant' Angelo dei Lom
bardi in Avellino province said 300
people died in that town and
Pescopagano, another poverty
stricken town in the province, re
ported 70 bodies had been found.
Chilled survivors huddled in
makeshift camps and tent cities, light
ing fires to keep warm. Temporary
morgues were set up.
Seismologists said the quake, meas
uring 6.8 on the Richter scale, jolted
an area of 10,156 square miles in the
Naples-Salerno area with a total popu

lation of 7 million.
The area is at the ankle of the Ital
ian boot.
The government rushed in 10,000
troops and 1 500 firemen and ordered
sleeper trains moved in to provide
temporary housing for the thousands
who lost their homes.
In Naples, where 11 persons were
killed in the collapse of a 10-story
apartment house, shops and restau
rants were closed and many of the ho
tels were either closed or not accept
ing guests in upper floors. No buses,
taxis or streetcars were running.
Thousands of Neapolitans, fearing
new quakes, remained on the streets,
in parks or the San Paolo soc.cQ^stach
um.
"I am terrified. 1 have a strange
feeling that another quake will hit the
city." said Carmela Attanasio, a 55-
year-old mother of three sons, who
drove around the city with her family
in a small Fiat 127.
"I was with the children watching
animal cartoons on television when
suddenly the light dimmed and the liv
ing room floor began moving up and
down and the ceiling lamp shook vio
lently. I thought when the quake hit.
the building is supposed to move side
ways and not up and down. The wall
plaster began falling off. There was a
terrifying noise — the kind of low and
heavy vibration and deafening noise
that shakes you from inside out. It was
terrible."
The government declared a day of
national mourning and Premier
Arnaldo Forlani and President Sandro
Pertini flew to visit the stricken area.
Pope John Paul II expressed his
"shock" at the unspeakable suffer
ing" of the population and named a
special representative bishop to coor
dinate church relief efforts.
Doctors canceled a nationwide
strike scheduled yesterday and re
ported to hospitals or went to the dis
aster area.
It was Italy's worst earthquake
since 1930 when 1.400 people perished
in a quake in the same area of southern
Italy. Italy's worst quake in this cen

tury occurred on Dec. 28, 1908, when
123,000 people were killed in the
Messina-Reggio Calabria area of
eastern Sicily and southernmost Italy.
Fertini and Forlani toured the scene
yesterday afternoon, after an emer
gency government meeting had re
viewed the situation. The cost of re
building and repairing the damage
could prove staggering. Seven million
people live in the stricken area.
There were immediate demands for
an investigation of building standards.
Although the quake destroyed some
seven-centuries-old town centers, not
all the buildings that collapsed were
old.
In towp after town, rescuers found
more than half the buildings in ruins.
Half the residents of some small set
tlements were dead.
The 500-vear-old bell tower of Santa
Maria di Casaluce in Aversa, near
Caserta, collapsed, killing the priest,
his mother and at least one other per
son in the church below.
Almost all of the historic center of
Potenza. with buildings dating to the
14th century, was levelled.
In one mountain town, a fireman
crawled through a space hardly larger
than his body to reach three children
trapped under the stones.
A boy pulled from a building in
Baronissi after being trapped 10 hours
recalled vividly what had happened:

Trying to read books on reserve is a frustrating experience for many students. Common complaints are the insufficient
number of books and the two-hour time limit.
