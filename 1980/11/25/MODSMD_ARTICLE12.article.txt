# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Cary Rosenzweig Being afraid of half the human race 
### 
Men. we have a problem:
rape Rape is not just a woman's
problem; it is a community
problem.
Within the last two weeks,
two women have been assaulted
in the Quad, the same Quad that
we all ride our bikes through,
laugh and play in, and consider
the intellectual heart of our
community.
1 would like to focus on a par
ticular kind of rape with the full
understanding that sudden, vi
olent assaults on women trav
eling alone are only one facet of
a complex issue which stems
from a culture that teaches men
to be aggressive and dominating
and women to be submissive
and accommodating.
Men. members of our com
munity are being attacked. The
fact that we men are not the ob
ject of these assaults should not
alter our perceptions of the
crime being committed. Rape is
not an act of lust; it is not an ov
erzealous attempt of passion.
Rape is a violent, aggressive as
sault.
Imagine. You are walking to
your dorm after an evening of
studies. You are alone, thinking
about the cold night air and a
nice warm bed. Seemingly from
nowhere, you are confronted by
three men. What do they want?
Money?
You are in pretty good shape,
so you decide to run for it. You
are caught and knocked to the
ground Fists crash into your
face. The wind is kicked from
your lungs. Dazed more than
hurt, you attempt to scream out
but freeze in response to the
cold steel pressed against your
neck. Silently, the men take
turns sodomizing you.
What do you feel? Terror.
Disgust. Weakness. Rage. Ha

tred. Violated Is it not the same
for women'' We men are not the
only human beings whose sense
of confidence, dignity and com
mand can be violated by vio
lence and terror
Even if some of us were in
human enough not to care about
the assaults on members of our
community, we could not es
cape the ugly fact of rape as re
ality in our relationships with
women Women often fear us. I
do not want to be feared.
There's no difference between
being raped
and going head first through a
windshield
except that afterward you are
afraid
not of cars
but of half the human race.
(This is an excerpt from "Rape
Poem'' by Marge Piercy, which

is partially reprinted in an ex
cellent. highly recommended
24-page booklet entitled Work
ing Against Rape.)
To meet the very real prob
lem on campus, the community
has developed, though under
used. self-defense classes,
awareness programs,
dormitory programs, and escort
services such as Students Unit
ed For Rape Elimination
i SURE) Their use should be en
couraged
While they do not solve the
cause of rape attacks and rape
acceptance in our community,
they do. hopefully, help prevent

the violent symptoms of the
problem.
Many men, however, still do
not acknowledge the threat and
partial loss of freedom to wom
en due to the ever-present dan
ger of rape
To these men I ask, would you
let your mother or sister walk
alone through the Quad at night,
knowing that two attacks have
taken place in two weeks there?
Would you let your lover? Would
you let the women in your
dorm?
I call for sensitivity. The
women of our community have
enough trouble in their fight for
equality, let alone their safety.
Please do not force your women
friends to ask you. a big, strong
man. to escort them, small,
frail, and defenseless.
First of all. women are not de-

lf e cannot escape. . . rape as reality in our
relationships with women. Women often
fear us. I do not want to be feared.

fenseless; they can learn to de
fend themselves. But a would-be
rapist will not know if his poten
tial victim is a black belt in
karate unless he attacks.
Our goal should be to deter
the attack from taking place. In
this regard, it is not so impor
tant that one of you has 19 inch
biceps as that there are at least
two people. Hence, two women
are usually as effective a deter
rent as a man and a woman.
The truth is that women get
raped, and it is men who rape
them Therefore, if a woman
friend of yours is going some
where alone at night, offer to go

with her, or offer to find some
one. female or male, who will go
with her. .
Is there any woman in your
dorm or house whom you would
like to see raped? Do you care
about the dignity of yourself,
your friends, and your com
munity? Then help deter the
threat of rape Let your friends
know that you care about them
by offering your aid before they
have to ask you.
Offer cheerfully in the spirit
of cooperation to ensure our
community's safety. Make an
announcement at dinner akin to.
"I'm going to Green at 7 p.m.
Would anyone care to join me?"
Rape is a community prob
lem. Let us work together,
women and men, to make Stan
ford the safe community it de
serves to be.

Rape is a community prob

women and men, to make Stan
ford the safe community it de
serves to be.

Men. we have a problem:
rape Rape is not just a woman's
problem; it is a community
problem.
Within the last two weeks,
two women have been assaulted
in the Quad, the same Quad that
we all ride our bikes through,
laugh and play in, and consider
the intellectual heart of our
community.
1 would like to focus on a par
ticular kind of rape with the full
understanding that sudden, vi
olent assaults on women trav
eling alone are only one facet of
a complex issue which stems
from a culture that teaches men
to be aggressive and dominating
and women to be submissive
and accommodating.
Men. members of our com
munity are being attacked. The
fact that we men are not the ob
ject of these assaults should not
alter our perceptions of the
crime being committed. Rape is
not an act of lust; it is not an ov
erzealous attempt of passion.
Rape is a violent, aggressive as
sault.
Imagine. You are walking to
your dorm after an evening of
studies. You are alone, thinking
about the cold night air and a
nice warm bed. Seemingly from
nowhere, you are confronted by
three men. What do they want?
Money?
You are in pretty good shape,
so you decide to run for it. You
are caught and knocked to the
ground Fists crash into your
face. The wind is kicked from
your lungs. Dazed more than
hurt, you attempt to scream out
but freeze in response to the
cold steel pressed against your
neck. Silently, the men take
turns sodomizing you.
What do you feel? Terror.
Disgust. Weakness. Rage. Ha

tred. Violated Is it not the same
for women'' We men are not the
only human beings whose sense
of confidence, dignity and com
mand can be violated by vio
lence and terror
Even if some of us were in
human enough not to care about
the assaults on members of our
community, we could not es
cape the ugly fact of rape as re
ality in our relationships with
women Women often fear us. I
do not want to be feared.
There's no difference between
being raped
and going head first through a
windshield
except that afterward you are
afraid
not of cars
but of half the human race.
(This is an excerpt from "Rape
Poem'' by Marge Piercy, which

is partially reprinted in an ex
cellent. highly recommended
24-page booklet entitled Work
ing Against Rape.)
To meet the very real prob
lem on campus, the community
has developed, though under
used. self-defense classes,
awareness programs,
dormitory programs, and escort
services such as Students Unit
ed For Rape Elimination
i SURE) Their use should be en
couraged
While they do not solve the
cause of rape attacks and rape
acceptance in our community,
they do. hopefully, help prevent

the violent symptoms of the
problem.
Many men, however, still do
not acknowledge the threat and
partial loss of freedom to wom
en due to the ever-present dan
ger of rape
To these men I ask, would you
let your mother or sister walk
alone through the Quad at night,
knowing that two attacks have
taken place in two weeks there?
Would you let your lover? Would
you let the women in your
dorm?
I call for sensitivity. The
women of our community have
enough trouble in their fight for
equality, let alone their safety.
Please do not force your women
friends to ask you. a big, strong
man. to escort them, small,
frail, and defenseless.
First of all. women are not de-

lf e cannot escape. . . rape as reality in our
relationships with women. Women often
fear us. I do not want to be feared.

fenseless; they can learn to de
fend themselves. But a would-be
rapist will not know if his poten
tial victim is a black belt in
karate unless he attacks.
Our goal should be to deter
the attack from taking place. In
this regard, it is not so impor
tant that one of you has 19 inch
biceps as that there are at least
two people. Hence, two women
are usually as effective a deter
rent as a man and a woman.
The truth is that women get
raped, and it is men who rape
them Therefore, if a woman
friend of yours is going some
where alone at night, offer to go

with her, or offer to find some
one. female or male, who will go
with her. .
Is there any woman in your
dorm or house whom you would
like to see raped? Do you care
about the dignity of yourself,
your friends, and your com
munity? Then help deter the
threat of rape Let your friends
know that you care about them
by offering your aid before they
have to ask you.
Offer cheerfully in the spirit
of cooperation to ensure our
community's safety. Make an
announcement at dinner akin to.
