## Gone is the age of Woodstock

As evidenced by the
statements and conclusions
made bv the ASSU Task Force
on Contemporary Entertain
ment. there is little under
standing concerning the history
of problems faced by ASSU Spe
cial Events. To draw "con
clusively" that students would
"support" big name entertain
ment through the results of 600
surveys suggests preposterous
naivete. In the business of enter
tainment "support" is meas
ured in only one way, ticket
sales. Clearly. 10 years of a Spe
cial Events program at Stanford
and nine years of associated fi
nancial losses have been a more
realistic and sobering indica
tion of support.
As any freshman in Econom
ics 1 could tell you. "demand" is
the desire to buy goods or ser
vices at a given prire Sure, a lot
of people want concerts. I would'
also guess that a lot of people
would like sport cars. too. Suf
fice to say that the results of
such surveys say nothing about
the success of the business ven
ture.
The committee fails to men
tion other easily found sources
that do. however, tell us some
thing about demand. "Fans are
deserting concerts in droves."
reports a Wall Street Journal
article recently, leading to a 30
percent decrease in revenues
from 1979 and hardships for pro
moters.
Although I realize ASSU task
forces are inherently fond of
questionnaires, the fact that ap
proximately 90 percent of past
Special Events's audiences
were non-Stanford-students,
further suggests that these find
ings should be considered more

seriously.
An ASSU entertainment pro
gram is extremely sensitive to
these industry changes. Due to
our positioning in the Bay Area
market behind large promoters
such as Bill Graham Presents.
Stanford acquires medium
caliber acts which are most af
fected by demand changes.
Although people still find the
time and money to go to the real
big-name acts as shown by the
recent migration to Oakland for
the Bruce Springsteen concert,
the lesser known artists are the
first to be omitted from enter
tainment budgets.
Furthermore, since Stanford
will never produce as many
shows as the professionals, our
facilities are less well known
As in the prestige of acts, better
known and attended facilities
are chosen over lesser known
ones. As shocking as it may
sound to Stanford students,
there are a good number of peo
ple who do not know where to
find Frost Amphitheater.
But demand is only half the
problem, the committee needs
to understand the costs as well.
Although inflation is causing all
costs to rise, especially in the
entertainment industry, ASSU
will inherently incur greater
cost for producing shows.
First, entertainment costs
will be higher. Since the enter
tainment industry is based on
personal relationships, bid
awards are often made based on
"favors" and affiliation rather
than money. Students, due to
their lack of continuity and ex
perience, are in a poor position
to enter such relationships and
thus pay a higher premium for
acts or worse, are used by the
agent to support a "limp" act.

In addition, production costs
will also be higher. Stanford is
an educational institution and
therefore puts a higher priority
on activities most directly re
lated to academics. It should not
be surprising that the Univer
sity infrastructure is not de
signed with rock and roll con
certs in mind. Therefore it
should similarly be expected
that the University technical
staff and students are more
costly and less efficient than
professional concert "roadies."
Ten years ago the idea of hav
ing a Special Events program
sponsored by students sounded
great. In the age of Woodstock
the "concert scene" was "in"
and entering promoters could
not produce enough concerts.
Thus, it seemed reasonable that
a student association enter the
action not only to provide enter
tainment for the students but to
raise money for the association
as well.
Looking back on the project
history, in only one year both
goals were achieved. Before I
left last year as student finan
cial manager. Special Events
had lost $55,000 on gross re
ceipts of more than $500,000 rep
resenting a 10 percent loss on
revenues. The years 1978 and
1979 were similarly character
ized by 10 percent losses.
Given the industry wide cir
cumstances of last year it would
seem just as reasonable to ask
of the 1980 loss, "Why so little?"
as "Why so much?" In the
future, I doubt we would be
quite so lucky.

1979-1980 ASSU financial man
ager. He will graduate this fall
with a degree in mechanical en
gineering.)

will inherently incur greater
cost for producing shows.
First, entertainment costs
will be higher. Since the enter
tainment industry is based on
personal relationships, bid
awards are often made based on
"favors" and affiliation rather
than money. Students, due to
their lack of continuity and ex
perience, are in a poor position
to enter such relationships and
thus pay a higher premium for
acts or worse, are used by the
agent to support a "limp" act.

In addition, production costs
will also be higher. Stanford is
an educational institution and
therefore puts a higher priority
on activities most directly re
lated to academics. It should not
be surprising that the Univer
sity infrastructure is not de
signed with rock and roll con
certs in mind. Therefore it
should similarly be expected
that the University technical
staff and students are more
costly and less efficient than
professional concert "roadies."
Ten years ago the idea of hav
ing a Special Events program
sponsored by students sounded
great. In the age of Woodstock
the "concert scene" was "in"
and entering promoters could
not produce enough concerts.
Thus, it seemed reasonable that
a student association enter the
action not only to provide enter
tainment for the students but to
raise money for the association
as well.
Looking back on the project
history, in only one year both
goals were achieved. Before I
left last year as student finan
cial manager. Special Events
had lost $55,000 on gross re
ceipts of more than $500,000 rep
resenting a 10 percent loss on
revenues. The years 1978 and
1979 were similarly character
ized by 10 percent losses.
Given the industry wide cir
cumstances of last year it would
seem just as reasonable to ask
of the 1980 loss, "Why so little?"
as "Why so much?" In the
future, I doubt we would be
quite so lucky.

1979-1980 ASSU financial man
ager. He will graduate this fall

gineering.)
As evidenced by the
statements and conclusions
made bv the ASSU Task Force
on Contemporary Entertain
ment. there is little under
standing concerning the history
of problems faced by ASSU Spe
cial Events. To draw "con
clusively" that students would
"support" big name entertain
ment through the results of 600
surveys suggests preposterous
naivete. In the business of enter
tainment "support" is meas
ured in only one way, ticket
sales. Clearly. 10 years of a Spe
cial Events program at Stanford
and nine years of associated fi
nancial losses have been a more
realistic and sobering indica
tion of support.
As any freshman in Econom
ics 1 could tell you. "demand" is
the desire to buy goods or ser
vices at a given prire Sure, a lot
of people want concerts. I would'

would like sport cars. too. Suf
fice to say that the results of
such surveys say nothing about
the success of the business ven
ture.

thing about demand. "Fans are
deserting concerts in droves."

article recently, leading to a 30
percent decrease in revenues
from 1979 and hardships for pro
moters.
Although I realize ASSU task
forces are inherently fond of
questionnaires, the fact that ap
proximately 90 percent of past
Special Events's audiences
were non-Stanford-students,
further suggests that these find
ings should be considered more

seriously.
An ASSU entertainment pro
gram is extremely sensitive to
these industry changes. Due to
our positioning in the Bay Area
market behind large promoters
such as Bill Graham Presents.
Stanford acquires medium
caliber acts which are most af
fected by demand changes.
Although people still find the
time and money to go to the real
big-name acts as shown by the
recent migration to Oakland for
the Bruce Springsteen concert,
the lesser known artists are the
first to be omitted from enter
tainment budgets.
Furthermore, since Stanford
will never produce as many
shows as the professionals, our
facilities are less well known
As in the prestige of acts, better
known and attended facilities
are chosen over lesser known
ones. As shocking as it may
sound to Stanford students,
there are a good number of peo
ple who do not know where to
find Frost Amphitheater.
But demand is only half the
problem, the committee needs
to understand the costs as well.
Although inflation is causing all
costs to rise, especially in the
entertainment industry, ASSU
