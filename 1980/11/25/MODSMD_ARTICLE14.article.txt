Since our "Big Con" article
(Daily, Nov. 13), we have re
ceived a great deal of reaction,
particularly in this paper. We
realize that we have hit a tender
spot in many students' hearts.
Our "indiscriminate bitter
ness" irked many otherwise
sympathizing students.
We disagree however, that
our points were indiscriminate.
For instance, we never denied
the fact that many people do
break through the barrier of
artificiality, both socially and
academically.
By far the most stringent dis
approval of our article has con
cerned the White Plaza "Hi
Debbie" routine. A common in
terpretation has been that one
should either ignore or institute
a profound conversation with

whomever one has met. This, of
course, is absurd.
Often one is truly interested
in another's well-being, and po
lite, routine questions are in or
der. What we object to are the
situations in which individuals
display fake enthusiasm and
artificial sincerity, which are
quite common.
In response to the idea that
"chit-chat" is socially neces
sary, we feel that such an idea
only proves our point about the
invalidity of social situations.
We believe intelligent conversa
tion is necessary; chit-chat, op
tional, but strongly dis
couraged.
One more clarification needs
to be made One rebuttal sug
gested that we didn t acknowl
edge game-playing and various
con-like activities in other uni

versities and in society in gener
al. We never made that claim in
our article.
We said that game playing is a
more frequent occurrence at
Stanford than at other univer
sities and in society in general.
We made this claim after much
observation on our part.
As for claims that we dis
played self-righteousness, we
deny ever having said that we
were above the game-playing.

I feel compelled to respond to
something which occurred at

Big Game on Saturday. The
loudness of a million Berkeley
fans screaming was impressive.
Their card show equally so. And
yes, it is depressing to let Cal
keep the axe for one more year.
But I resent the comment
which flashed upon the
scoreboard after our defeat:
"The Stanford Band has no
class," along with the yell from
Cal fans that "The Band is not
funny anymore."
I'm afraid the Leland Stan
ford Junior University
Marching Band is too classy for
Cal and they are just plain
jealous. The fact is the Band
utilizes its chance to act as a fo
rum criticizing or praising
critical social and political
events and conditions
This season there have been

farces that were apolitical, anti
establishment, ridiculing the
Pac—lo which dwindled to the
Pac-5, etc. Sometimes seeing
truth in a band formation is hard
to bear (no pun intended). It's
too bad so many bands limit
themselves and waste the op
portunity to say what they be
lieve. Cause the times they are
a-changin'.
While two bands outblowing
each other may have been
asinine, the post-game rally
which lasted long after the Cal
students had gone home showed
the unity of the Stanford spirit.
We'll never forget your dead
Trojan horse. I say keep
