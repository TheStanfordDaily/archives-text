## What's the purpose of the fast? 
### 
I'm enjoying a typical sophomore slump —
thriving on uncertainty. "Why are we here? Why
have our minds been deemed so worthy of refining
that we receive 16 years of quality education
though most of us have worked about one year of
our lives 9 "
Somebody out there thinks we're a worthwhile
investment That's why we enjoy four years of
country club accommodation at a prestigious uni
versity We're here to hone our talents to make a
positive impact on the world, right? Hence the
common aspiration to become a doctor, teacher
or public official.
I applaud Joe Stanford Student for what I like to
perceive as a genuine streak of altruism. Al
though school does not nurture a selfless outlook
toward one's future, most everyone here wants to
do something positive with his life; even if that in
clination only shows up every Sunday after
church.
However. I concur with Steve Hansch's column
(Daily, Nov. 21): "It (today's Day of Fasting)
represents the extreme absurdity that half a
dozen typical undergraduates concerned about an
incredibly hideous tragedy must devote so much
time for nothing less than getting others around
them to just think about what is right and wrong."
We want to contribute to society, but we never
think about the most important thing we can do —
help the world's hungry. Our intentions may be
worthy, but our priorities are jumbled.
Almost a third of the members of my eating
club signed up to fast today in observance of world
hunger. Many of us will attend one of seven lec
tures and discussions on campus where we'll
learn:
— The average American consumes about five
times as much grain as the average person in the

Third World
— About 80 percent of the corn grown in this
country feeds livestock
— If the world s food supply were equitably dis
tributed. hunger would be virtually eliminated.
But resources follow money supply in the interna
tional food market and provide luxury foods to the
First World while over 700 million people suffer
from caloric undernutrition
Although we're conscientious and informed, we
still care more about our midterms than the lives
we could save just by reducing our personal con
sumption. So the members of my eating club
won t notice that the hundred of us throws away
eoough food each day to double the caloric intake
of 100 people in the Third World. And we'll never
realize that by cutting one pound of meat out of
our diet each week we would liberate seven
pounds of grain in the world food supply.
For most of those who participate, today's Day
of Fasting will be like the Jewish Yom Kippur — a
day of atonement. Our sympathy will run deep for
a day. but our concern will evaporate at sundown
when our penance is complete. We'll never realize
how the purpose of today's fast links to the only
worthwhile reason for our being at Stanford.
If you share my uncertainty, you frequently re
assess your individual road to success. Perhaps a
"C-" in Human Bio forebodes that there's some
thing else you want to do with your talents besides
becoming a doctor
Then rearrange your efforts. You'll probably
save more lives by becoming a vegetarian. .
