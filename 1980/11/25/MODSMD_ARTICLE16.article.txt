## Don't overemphasize the sexual 
### 
A FAIRY leapt upon my knee
Singing & dancing merrily;
I said, 'Thou thing of patches,
rings,
Pins, Necklaces, & such like
things,
Disguiser of the Female Form,
Thou paltry, gilded, poisonous
worm!' <
â€” William Blake
Paul and I have a curious
power. We both have something
of a reputation, but together we
are recognized by most of the
student body as a pair of fag
gots. Wherever we go on cam
pus we seem to cause a ruckus.
The furtive glances, terror
stricken faces, and desperate
whisperings indicate that peo
ple are afraid of us, afraid that
we'll talk to them or smile at
them or wink at them or in any
way draw attention to the fact
that they are interacting with a
practicing homosexual. We
have the power of the plague
victim.
I can understand these reac
tions. I used to have them my
self before I came out. When I
was in high school I was gener
ally accepting of gays, mildly
disgusted by the thought of what
they did in bed, and deathly
afraid that one of them might
proposition me. I thought that
being gay meant that you
wanted to do nasty things to

your best friend. I loved my best
friend, liked to be with him,
liked to look at his body, but I
wouldn't let myself even con
sider nasties. That was how I
was able to convince myself
that I wasn't gay.
My problem then was that I
was over-emphasizing the sex in
homosexual. Because I wasn't
comfortable with the idea of
"homosexual acts," I wasn't
comfortable with being gay. I
think Paul and I attract atten
tion for the same reason. To
quote the current cliche, we are
guilty of "flaunting our sexuali
ty." The idea is that by reveal
ing the fact that we're gay we
have revealed intimate details
of our sex lives.
I never cease to be amazed at
how often people make this mis
take. The attitude that is fast be
coming the "proper" attitude to
have towards gays is that it's
okay to be gay as long as you
keep it in the bedroom. Even
Anita Bryant has now adopted
this stance. The implication is
that people shouldn't go around
advertising the fact that they
are gay ("Straight people don't
advertise their sex lives, why do
gays?").
This is the same convoluted
logic as before. Telling someone
that you are gay does not neces
sarily imply anything about

your sex life. Being gay means
that you love and are attracted
to people of the same sex. It
doesn't say anything about how
you deal with those feelings
(i.e., your sex life).
Another place where this mis
take crops up is in the argument
that homosexuality is a life
style, a choice. Again this is
over-emphasizing the sexual. A
person can be celibate and still
be gay. The essence of being gay
is the feelings and desires that a
person experiences. Those have
nothing to do with his or her life
style and are certainly not a
matter of choice. One chooses to
pattern one's lifestyle accord
ingly, but being gay dictates the
lifestyle, not the other wav

around.
I wish that people would stop
and think before they voice such
absurd arguments. I wear a but
ton that says"I like boys" (per
haps one of the reasons for my
reputation). If you aren't com
fortable with my gay feelings,
fine. I can handle that. But dear
god. don't accuse me of reveal
ing my sex life to you. It's a
simple statement. I like boys. I
like to look at them. I like to talk
to them, I like to be around
them. That's all the button says.
It doesn't say what I like to do
to them, or even whether or not I
ever do. It simply says that I
like them, that I'm gay.
