## The Stranglers: artistes or skull bashers?
### Bill Glenn 
"The Stranglers?? They must
be one of those punk groups,
right?"
Sigh. Urggh.
Yes, I explain, the Stranglers
have some very strong views
about social and political issues.
And they will literally fight to
defend their rights to voice
those opinions.
But they don't wear safety
pins, spit on their audience, or
vomit in public. They're not
young kids taking a stab at rock
and roll notoriety. They are ded
icated artists who take what
they do very seriously.
The audience at the Stone in
San Francisco Saturday night
learned just that. This is only
the band's second visit to the
U.S. from England, and only a
fraction of the crowd could have
seen them 2V2 years ago. The
curious and the dedicated in
termingled; the tall blond
surfer on my left was having as
much fun as the pale, leather
jacketed woman on my right.
After a long wait topped off by
an excruciatingly cute and

lengthy ditty over the PA en
titled "Stand up and Cheer for
Ronald Reagan,'' the lights
went down and a prerecorded
overture filled the room. It was
like a funeral march for a
clown, melancholy with a trace
of whimsy. A lumbering bass
line bounced behind a darkly
melodic calliope as shadows of
band members walked onstage.
Someone at the controls woke
up, and the introduction finally
faded as a synthesizer floated
forth an eerie Middle Eastern
wail. A springy bass line crept
to full volume, drums crashed
into life, and white light bathed
the black-clad figures on stage.
Guitarist Hiugh Cornwell
filled in the sound with a coun
terrhythm of opposing notes,
and the band shifted musical
gears into the twisting rhythm
of "Shah Shah A Go Go." Lithe
bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel
lurched into his characteristic
stage movements as Cornwell
intoned: "Did you hear about
the man / Used to live out in Iran
/ He was luxury's greatest fan /
People ate out of his hand / Peo

ple ate out of his hand / Shah
Shah A Go Go. . .
The crowd bounced through
the set, intent on watching the
band and unable to dance wildly
to the shifting rhythms within
songs. Cornwell maintained a
caged-in tenseness and urgency
throughout the set, in contrast
to Burnel's intent stare, eternal
pout, and complete physical in
volvement in his playing.
"Shah Shah" was slowly
transformed into the melodic
keyboard blips and broken
movement of "Ice," as Burnel
whispered/sang the cryptic lyr
ics laden with Japanese im
agery. The crowd screamed ap
proval as Cornwell followed
with the biting guitar intro to
the mini-epic "Toiler on the
Sea" from the group's third
album. Black and White.
Scraggly-bearded Jet Black
(who is rumored to be pushing
40) provided a solid foundation
on drums. His almost hypnotic
intro to "Genetix," the closing
song, was one of the highlights
of the set.
Dave Greenfield's keyboard

work is one of the hallmarks of
the band's sound, and has in the
past prompted comparison with
the Doors. Unfortunately, his
playing Saturday was uneven,
and paled in light of his outstan
ding studio work.
The Stranglers' songs are a
unique mixture of reality and
fantasy. "Genetix" is a creepy,
singsong tribute to human
audacity in pursuit of gene regu
lation. The v four-movement
"Down in the Sewer" is a dryly
funny, sleazy dip into darkness
and the survival capabilities of
rats. "The Raven," from their
recent album of the same name,
conjures up images of times
long ago in a culture that is one
of the band's fascinations: the
Vikings. "My friend you're
black and when you fly you're
wild / I am white sometimes I
behave just like a child / The
northern seas are cold but
they're our own / We'll sail your
southern seas before too long."
JJ Burnel drove the band,
belting out his meaty brand of
bass rhythms while constantly
moving with the firm grace of a

small man with a black belt in
karate. Cornwell wrenched out
twisting guitar notes and rough
edged chords through an un
treated guitar.
It's hard to say whether or not
the Stranglers will ever tour the
States again. The band's an
tagonistic (to say the least) re
lationship with the press has
hindered any efforts to gain a
following in this country. This
tour was almost scrapped when
every piece of equipment that
the band had brought along was
stolen from a truck in New
York, and had to be replaced as
well as possible.
But what is certain is that the
Stranglers should come back.
The uncluttered complexity of
their music and their skill in
songwriting make them one of
the most unique bands in recent
vears.
