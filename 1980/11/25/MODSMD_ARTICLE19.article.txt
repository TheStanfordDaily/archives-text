# James Brown's soul
## Autonomous or predetermined? 
### Mike Wilkins 
Aren't reviews silly? Here
they are, trying to get you to ex
perience something you didn't
see, or to relive the wild concert
you did see, hut all they end up
doing is removing you one more
step from reality. In the time
it's taking you to read reviews,
you could be enjoying a felt, im
mediate union with your cereal
and toast, or salad if you read
during lunch.
What we need, I think, as a
compromise, is some sort of
logical atomism, at least on the
Entertainment Page. As Rus
sell says ". .. in a logically cor
rect symbolism there will
always be a certain fundamen
tal identity of structure be
tween a fact and the symbol for
it; and . . . the complexity of
the symbol corresponds very
closely with the complexity of
the facts symbolized by it. "
Can one find a logically cor
rect symbolism for James
Brown? One immediately
thinks of the term "soul," but is
one then speaking of the Judeo-
Christian individual soul, or the
all-engulfing Buddhist soul? In
deed, the idea that there is even
such an entity as soul is one open
for debate. What is not open for
debate is James Brown's talent:
after two decades of per
forming, he can still whip a
crowd into a frenzy. This he did
at The Keystone Thursday
night.
Brown's warm-up tape was
Stanley Clarke's Schooldays.
Clarke led his band through a
variety of tight, very listenable
jazz-rock offerings. Schooldays
was given 4''2 stars by down
beat magazine, and I agree.
Stanley Clarke is superb.
Following this. James
Brown's band. The J.B.'s, took
the stage and played a set of
loud, funky and crowd-pleasing,
but forgettable pieces. The
J.B.'s got people in the mood to
sweat, and when they were
done, the place was hopping.
The two women next to me or

dered more white wine Was it
anticipation or cigarette smoke
that hung in the air?
Before the audience was al
lowed to see the star, however,
they had to put up with two
songs by his backup singers who
did lame covers of the already
lame "He's So Shy." and "Up
side-down." Mercifully their set
was short.
It was time. Time to see his
tory up close Time to see the
man that went on television dur
ing the riots in Washington so
that people would stay in and
watch him rather than going
outside to break things. With a
great fanfare, he took the stage
along with another of his
Muhammad Ali-like entourage,
the female dancing machine.
Lola Love.
The place erupted. Lots of
people started dancing Others
grooved in amazement, watch
ing this souled timer sing, and
yell and plead. His face is older
looking in person than on his
albums, and his hair-do is more
suited for a female B-52's fan
He holds his dick against his left
leg when he sings.
The scene would have been
pathetic if one watched without
sound. But. my oh my can he
sing! He sang the hard stuff, he
sang the love songs and I can say
now that 1 saw James Brown do
"Sex Machine" live. True, he
has a little trouble getting back
to his feet after doing one of his
patented leap-splits, but he still
sends chills up female spines
when he sings "Please, Please,
Please," and he still sends chills
up white spines when he sings
"The Big Payback."
When he was done with his
show the crowd hung on, not be
lieving that he would not do an
encore. No one had had enough,
me included.
A James Brown concert is
something everyone should ex
perience. And, I guess, that is
the purpose of reviews. To get
you to see something great
before the philosophers get to it.
And ruin it.
