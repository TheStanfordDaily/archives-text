From the Daily wire services
San Diego — Minority students will
sue the state of California if the state
requires proficiency tests for high
school diplomas as planned, an As
sembly hearing was told yesterday.
"To deny diplomas to high school
seniors who were the victims of dis
crimination based on wealth is to deny
them equal protection of the law,"' op
ponents claimed.
Class of 1981 is first to face the
test. But the legislators were told
"preliminary test results indicate
that minority students are failing the
tests en masse." The state Depart
ment of Education recently issued a
similar report.
A statement read at the hearing
said 89 percent of blacks and 77
percent of the Mexican-Americans at
Sequoia Union High School failed the
writing portion of the test.
A total of 61 percent of the students
passed at the predominantly white
Skyline High School in Oakland while
16 percent did well at minority-domi
nated Oakland Tech.
In California, public schools are
preparing to give the tests with differ
ing standards, said the report pres
ented by Feter Hoos of the Mexican-
American Legal Defense and Educa
tional Fund.

A student with a 132 math score in
the Basic Skills Assessment test
would pass in the Sacramento Unified
School District "but would fall far
short of the 154 requirement in the
Yuba City Unified School District,"
Hoos said.
But the California Supreme Court
has ruled, he noted, that "accidents of
geography and arbitrary boundary
lines of local government can afford
no grounds for discrimination among
a state's citizens."
The report was also prepared by
Stephan Rosenweiz of the Legal Aid
Society of Alameda County, Dick
Tomoca. a law student at the Univer
sity of California at Davis, and Ellen
Feter of California Rural Legal As
sistance.
If the proficiency tests become a re
quirement for graduation, they pre
dicted multiple lawsuits filed by the
wealthy as well as the poor, whites as
well as minorities, the stationary as
well as the transient."
"Federal law requires that a handi
capped student have access to an
educational program until the age of
21," they said, adding: "The evidence
. , . indicates that the competency
tests in most California cities are like
ly to disproportionately deny
diplomas to minority students."
