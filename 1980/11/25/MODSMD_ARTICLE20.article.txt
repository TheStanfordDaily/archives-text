after fire crews finished pumping water out of the area, which
housed an underground parking garage.
Clark County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said a search of two of the
final three elevator shafts revealed no bodies.
Parrish. asked about a report quoting a city fire battalion chief
that as many as 40 bodies might yet remain in elevator shafts,
said he did not agree
"It does seem unlikely to me." Parrish said
Parrish pointed out that it was unlikely that anyone would have
been in the basement at the time the electrical fire erupted ex
plosively in flames at 7:15 a.m. Friday after smoldering for
hours
Iran continues Iraqi counterattack
Baghdad, Iraq — Iran said it pressed counterattacks against
Iraqi positions all along the 300-mile war front, claiming hundreds
of Iraqi casualties in five cities. Both countries attacked each oth
er's oil installations.
U.N. Special Envoy Olof Palme ended his peace efforts and left
Baghdad with no apparent expectation of an early cease-fire. He
held talks in Iran last week but was told by Prime Minister
Mohammad Ali Rajai the effort was a "waste of time."
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said Iranian forces re
pulsed a new Iraqi offensive on the Iranian border city of Sus
angerd. 30 miles northwest of the Khuzistan provincial capital
Ahwaz, according to an interview at the front by the news agency

Muskie: quick hostage release unlikely
Washington — Secretary of State Edmund Muskie said yester
day he does not expect a quick breakthrough in efforts to free the
52 Americans held hostage in Iran and that negotiations may be
lengthy.
"Our posture now is that we are holding and circling," he told
reporters as he waited for a response from Tehran to U.S. pro
posals for a settlement of the 55-week crisis.

Operating through Algerian intermediaries, the Carter admin
istration two weeks ago gave Iran its proposals for breaking the
deadlock over the American hostages. The U.S. proposals were a
response to terms set Nov. 2 by Iran.
In Algeria, sources said Iran has requested a further explana
tion of the U.S. reply Iranian officials said Sunday the U.S. reply
was unsatisfactory and reports from Tehran indicate the Iranians
wanted a "clear and explicit" yes or no answer to their demands.
"Each day's wait is a disappointment," Muskie said. Then,
projecting further delay, he said he does not expect a yes or no
reply from Iran or a short-term solution.
"We know they want some information external to the proposal
itself," he said. "We know there are some five lists of information
in their request."
Calif, air fares twice national average
San Francisco — Intrastate air fares nationwide have been on
the increase in the two years since Congress deregulated the air
line industry, but ticket prices within California have soared
twice as high as the national average.
A study bv the state Public Utilities Commission says airline
deregulation "was intended to encourage competition among air
lines and thus, by the action of the free market place, produce a
reduction in fares. This did not happen in California," the PUC
said
As a result, it now costs more to fly from San Francisco to Los
Angeles than it does from New York to Washington, D C. — a situ
ation that for a long time was dramatically reversed.
Two years ago. a passenger could probably purchase a ticket
for the San Francisco-Los Angeles run for $28; now. the fare
would be about $60.
Intrastate fares rose 73 percent from September 1978. to
March 1980, the PUC study found. The fares, "with the en
couragement of the Civil Aeronautics Board, are rising to meet
the standard industry fare level established by the CAB," the re
port concluded

Thompson from the office building to a parking lot where a prison
security van was parked As they reached the van. a man sitting
on a bench outside the doctor's office approached and pulled the
gun. Madding said.

The most serious was the 8000-acre Panorama fire that started
about 75 miles east of Los Angeles in the Upper Waterman Canyon

by the high, northeasterly Santa Ana winds, that blaze swept
down the hills and stormed through a 10-square-block area within
city limits.

was believed arson-caused.
No deaths and only minor injuries were reported.

Fire crews search Las Vegas hotel
Las Vegas, Nev. — Making their final search for bodies, fire
crews pumped six feet of water from the MGM Grand Hotel's
basement and workmen sawed open elevators that plummeted
from higher floors during Friday's fire. Officials said they
doubted the death toll would climb much beyond 84
The teams of men with saws went into the basement moments
after fire crews finished pumping water out of the area, which
housed an underground parking garage.
Clark County Fire Chief Roy Parrish said a search of two of the
final three elevator shafts revealed no bodies.
Parrish. asked about a report quoting a city fire battalion chief
that as many as 40 bodies might yet remain in elevator shafts,
said he did not agree
"It does seem unlikely to me." Parrish said
Parrish pointed out that it was unlikely that anyone would have
been in the basement at the time the electrical fire erupted ex
plosively in flames at 7:15 a.m. Friday after smoldering for
hours
Iran continues Iraqi counterattack
Baghdad, Iraq — Iran said it pressed counterattacks against
Iraqi positions all along the 300-mile war front, claiming hundreds
of Iraqi casualties in five cities. Both countries attacked each oth
er's oil installations.
U.N. Special Envoy Olof Palme ended his peace efforts and left
Baghdad with no apparent expectation of an early cease-fire. He
held talks in Iran last week but was told by Prime Minister
Mohammad Ali Rajai the effort was a "waste of time."
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr said Iranian forces re
pulsed a new Iraqi offensive on the Iranian border city of Sus
angerd. 30 miles northwest of the Khuzistan provincial capital
Ahwaz, according to an interview at the front by the news agency
Pars.
Muskie: quick hostage release unlikely
Washington — Secretary of State Edmund Muskie said yester
day he does not expect a quick breakthrough in efforts to free the
52 Americans held hostage in Iran and that negotiations may be
lengthy.
"Our posture now is that we are holding and circling," he told
reporters as he waited for a response from Tehran to U.S. pro
posals for a settlement of the 55-week crisis.

Operating through Algerian intermediaries, the Carter admin
istration two weeks ago gave Iran its proposals for breaking the
deadlock over the American hostages. The U.S. proposals were a
response to terms set Nov. 2 by Iran.
In Algeria, sources said Iran has requested a further explana
tion of the U.S. reply Iranian officials said Sunday the U.S. reply
was unsatisfactory and reports from Tehran indicate the Iranians
wanted a "clear and explicit" yes or no answer to their demands.
"Each day's wait is a disappointment," Muskie said. Then,
projecting further delay, he said he does not expect a yes or no
reply from Iran or a short-term solution.
"We know they want some information external to the proposal
itself," he said. "We know there are some five lists of information
in their request."
Calif, air fares twice national average
San Francisco — Intrastate air fares nationwide have been on
the increase in the two years since Congress deregulated the air
line industry, but ticket prices within California have soared
twice as high as the national average.
A study bv the state Public Utilities Commission says airline
deregulation "was intended to encourage competition among air
lines and thus, by the action of the free market place, produce a
reduction in fares. This did not happen in California," the PUC
said
As a result, it now costs more to fly from San Francisco to Los
Angeles than it does from New York to Washington, D C. — a situ
ation that for a long time was dramatically reversed.
Two years ago. a passenger could probably purchase a ticket
for the San Francisco-Los Angeles run for $28; now. the fare
would be about $60.
Intrastate fares rose 73 percent from September 1978. to
March 1980, the PUC study found. The fares, "with the en
couragement of the Civil Aeronautics Board, are rising to meet
the standard industry fare level established by the CAB," the re
port concluded

Harold Ruffin, Madding said.
After the doctor's appointment, Holmstrom and Kuffin led
Thompson from the office building to a parking lot where a prison
security van was parked As they reached the van. a man sitting
on a bench outside the doctor's office approached and pulled the
gun. Madding said.

Flames rage in Southern California
San Bernardino — Winds howling up to 95 mph sent three fires
roaring through 13,500 tinder-dry acres of forest and brush yester
day, setting 100 to 200 houses aflame and forcing hundreds of foot
hill residents to flee.
The most serious was the 8000-acre Panorama fire that started
about 75 miles east of Los Angeles in the Upper Waterman Canyon
in the San Bernardino National Forest north of the city. Fanned
by the high, northeasterly Santa Ana winds, that blaze swept
down the hills and stormed through a 10-square-block area within
city limits.
U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Debbie Salow said the fire
was believed arson-caused.
No deaths and only minor injuries were reported.
