# 'Biggest hassle at Stanford'
## Reserved reading problematic 
### Kimberly Brown 
The reserved reading system — to
many students it's a leading contender
for the "Biggest Hassle at Stanford"
award.
Nevertheless, students have man
aged to devise ways to deal with the
system, such as reading ahead, hunt
ing down materials in other libraries
or simply not doing the readings.
Of course, many people find the sys
tem efficient enough, accept that cer
tain problems are inherent to any li
brary system, and resign themselves
to the inconveniences bound to arise
now and then.
Yet certain complaints are often
voiced, including an insufficient
number of copies kept on reserve, the
listing of books as "unavailable" in
the catalogue and the two-hour time
limit. Students also complain of bot
tlenecks in the check-out area during
periods such as Dead Week when eve
ryone is scrambling for the same ma
terial.
Difficulties vary with how big a
class is. how long its readings are and
how many are required as reserves.
Heaviest course
The course with the heaviest re
serve list (Pol. Sci. 138W> has 150
items on file. Students estimate that
one to three readings each week are
unavailable.
Generally, students in smaller

classes, seminars and colloquia have a
harder time than those in large lecture
courses.
One student related the experience
of having only one copy of a book for a
seminar The professor suggested that
the class organize into time slots and
share the book, but this proved highly
impractical and most of the class ap
parently never read the material
Professors' problems
Students aren't the only ones trying
to cope with the situation. Professors
deal from the other end. where several
difficulties exist as well.
One professor who asked not to be
identified maintains he hasn t had a
quarter yet where there hasn't been
some problem.
Terming the system "basically un
reliable." he said his problems began
with his first class here over a decade
ago, when students told him a certain
reading was nowhere to be found.
When he confronted library personnel,
they told him they "didn't think one
book would make a difference," he
said.
"They don't seem to realize how es
sential they are to an undergraduate
education, but are more concerned
with their own notions of bureaucratic
systems," he said
Political Science Prof. Robert
Keohane said the system runs into
more snags during the first weeks of

the quarter, before students reading
patterns are spread out
Keohane described the first week
end of his course, "How Nations Deal
With Each Other, as a zoo scene at
Meyer library, since the first three
readings of the quarter were on re
serve.
However, he said, "there are bound
to be structural problems with any re
serve system my own view is that
Meyer does a pretty good job.'
History Prof. Alexander Dallin.
who chaired the University Commit
tee on Libraries from 1975 to 78. ad
mitted that the reserve system pres
ents difficulties. He said some can be
traced back to professors, but others
are simply technical matters.
Library personnel
Just as professors can become ex
asperated with the library, library
personnel often become just as ex
asperated with their antagonizers.
Sally Hoggia. associate librarian at
Meyer, said. "Our system is already
very responsive, but some professors
are hard to please."
All materials from campus librar
ies are recorded on a central com
puter. and any item can be placed on
reserve within 24 hours. However,
said Hoggia. many faculty members
feel the 24 hour period poses a barrier
in itself.
