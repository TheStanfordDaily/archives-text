# Patrols, march, follow latest attacks on women

### Peter Finch 
Because of two recent attacks on
Stanford women, campus police have
stepped up patrolling of certain areas
and are urging students to be more
careful about where and with whom
they travel at night.
The most recent attack occurred
last Wednesday behind Hoover Tower
at approximately 8 p.m. The motive,
according to Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, was probably rape
"The guy just lunged at her and
tried to get her off her bike." he said,
"but she just kept on riding."
The woman, who reportedly noticed
her assailant in the dark by the side of
the road as she approached him. re
ceived what Herrington called a "su
perficial cut" in the brief scuffle. For
tunately, she was moving at a rapid
enough pace to speed past the man
"Probably what saved her was that
she was moving at a fair clip,' Her
rington said.
Earlier attack
Prior to that, a woman was raped
near the Quad shortly after the
Stanford-USC football game on Nov. 8
A drawing of the attacker is vet to be
completed. Herrington said, largely
because of the unavailability of an ar
tist and the desire of the victim not to
be identified.
"I put out a plainclothes team about
five or six days ago," Herrington said.
"So far they haven't found anybody.
There have been no attacks. But we re
going to continue with (the plain
clothes team) for some time."
Although the most recent attack
happened so quickly that the victim
didn't get a good look at her assailant,
the police are guessing that it was the
same man in both cases.
"I can't say positively that it was
the same person," Herrington said,
"but they were fairly close in terms of
area and they were both about the
same time of the evening."
'Take Back' march
Last week's assault inspired an im
promptu "Take Back the Night"
march Thursday night, involving
about 25 people who met at the Wom
en's Center. Organizer Diana Swift

said the march was meant to em
phasize that campus violence "is a
community problem and everybody in
the community should watch out for
each other, regardless of gender." She
said women should not be made to feel
weak when they request to be accom
panied at night.
Herrington, meanwhile, is en
couraging students to be aware of the
dangers involved in walking alone at
night and mentioned several meas
ures they should take to avoid being at
tacked.
"I really caution women not to
travel in the dark alone in deserted
areas." he said. "I know that's dif
ficult. but 1 encourage people to use
the escort services available to
them."
Herrington also stressed that stu

dents who cannot find anyone to travel
with should at least try to walk in well
traveled areas.
"Don't go the shortest way if it
takes you to a deserted area," he
warned. "Side walks adjacent to road
ways where there's autos to see you if
you need help are the best."
Hiding a bicycle, according to Her
rington, is "some degrees'" better
than walking because riders are more
difficult to attack.
But Vic Menon, director of Students
United for Hape Elimination
(SUHE), disagreed, calling Her
rington's assertion a "misconcep
tion."
Bike danger
"Women are more vulnerable on
bikes than on foot." he asserted. "It's
very easy to throw a stick or a rock in

the spokes and throw the bicycle off
balance. Then the woman is not only
on the ground, but she may be injured
as well."
Menon noted that two women walk
ing together is relatively safe, at least
compared to walking alone.
"Statistics show that as long as
you're accompanied, the chances of an
attack are drastically reduced." he
said.
There are several ways to find ac
companiment here. Menon explained.
First, students can ask their friends to
walk with them. Second, they can use
the SUHE Escort Service which is in
operation from 8:30 p.m. until 12:30
a.m., Sunday through Thursday
nights. And third, he said, dorms often
set up their own informal escort ser
vices.
