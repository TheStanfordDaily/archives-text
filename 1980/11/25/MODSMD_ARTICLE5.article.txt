From the Daily wire services
Washington — Carter adminis
tration officials quietly questioned
President-elect Heagan's naming of
defense industry representatives to
the Pentagon transition team, sug
gesting it might raise the appearance
of a conflict of interest, adminis
tration sources said.
But the sources, who asked not to be
identified, said no formal protest was
lodged because it was not the outgoing
administration's responsibility to po
lice the practices of the newcomers.
Heagan's 13-member transition
team at the Defense Department in
cludes four men who work for defense
contractors, including the deputy
team leader, Ben Ply male. He is an
employee of the Boeing Co., the na
tion's seventh largest defense con
tractor.
The sources said that although they
did raise the question of possible con
flicts of interest, they did not claim
the use of employees of defense con
tractors was either illegal or un
ethical
"Our only role is to point out to them
in a friendly manner about the ap

pearance of things," said one source.
"It creates the possibility of ap
pearances that might be embarrass
ing. It's a judgment matter for them."
James Brady, spokesman for the
Heagan team, said the team had been
careful to avoid potential conflicts of
interest even though federal conflict
of-interest laws do not apply to transi
tion officials.
"To maintain integrity and ap
pearances ... we decided to proceed as
if the conflict-of-interest laws did app
ly," said Brady.
He said that if a member of a transi
tion team worked for a company with
an interest in the policies of an agen
cy, that person would be excluded
from that specific area of the agency's
activities.
A member of the defense transition
team, who asked not to be identified,
said that restriction had been applied
to the four men affiliated with defense
contractors, but he declined to specify
how it affected their transition work.
"We're bending over backwards not
to have a conflict of interest," the
team member said "But we're not
going to say what areas these people

are working on You'll just have to
take our word on that."
Fred Fielding, who was deputy
White House counsel under convicted
Watergate conspirator John Dean and
who now handles conflict-of-interest
questions for the incoming adminis
tration, said the limited role of the
transition teams effectively makes
conflicts of interest irrelevant.
"If these people were going in and
making policy, that would be one
thing," Fielding said "But they're not
making policy recommendations per
se. They're saying (to the incoming
Heagan officials), These are the
problems you face. "
Two members of the defense transi
tion team — William Graham and
Howland Herbst — work for H&D As
sociates, a California-based research
and development firm that does busi
ness with the military Hobert Silver
stein. another team member, is a vice
president for market analysis at the
Northrop Corp., the nation s 13th larg
est defense contractor Ply male, the
deputy team leader, and Graham,
