## Sinai farmers fear forced resettlement 
### Washington Post 
Yamit, Occupied Slnat — Em
bittered by what they feel is a
betrayal by their government
and troubled by the uncertainty
of their future, militant Jewish
settlers in this desert communi
ty have vowed to blockade the
only road linking Israel and
Egypt and wreck the peace trea
ty before the last third of the Si
nai is returned to Egypt in 17
months.
The resistance movement
represents only a small minor
ity of the 3500 settlers who have
moved to the Sinai Peninsula
since Israel captured it from the
Egyptians in the 1967 Six-Day
War. Most have become re
signed to moving and are con
cerned mostly about how much
compensation they can extract
from the government in Jerusa
lem.
But the holdouts' determina
tion approaches fanaticism.
Many are armed, which pres
ents a nightmarish dilemma to
the government of Prime Min
ister Menachem Begin.
If he fails to forcibly remove
the settlers, he could undermine
normalization of relations with
Egypt, the major accomplish
ment of his first term of office.
But if he does force them out, he
faces in an election year the
grisly specter of Jews fighting
Jews on land that many Israelis
regard as part of the Jewish
biblical legacy.
Refusal to wait
"Today Yamit, tomorrow Je
rusalem. This is where we make
our stand." Rabbi Yisrael Ariel,
spiritual leader of a group
called MAOZ, said in an in
terview. "Wc are not going to
wait until they take us out of
here in 1982."
MAOZ. an acronym of the
Hebrew words for "struggle, in
itiative and identity," is the nu
cleus of several resistance
movements that have been
forming in this seaside develop
ment town and the 13 surround
ing agricultural settlements, all
of which are scheduled to be
closed after the current school
year ends in June.
Ariel, head of a Jewish semi
nary here, would not discuss de
tails of his group's resistance
plans, saying they are being
held secret for the tactical ad
vantage of surprise.
Organized demonstrations
"But we will bring here
thousands of people, who are al
ready organizing to demon
strate. We know the places. We
are just waiting for the exact
time," said Ariel, who said
MAOZ has 60 families involved
in the effort.
Another MAOZ leader, Avi
Farhan, a 33-year-old native Is
raeli who was carrying a .38-
caliber revolver in his waist
band, also spoke of "measures
we can't publicize." But he
vowed, "We are not leaving
Yamit peacefully, I can assure
vou of that."

The opening salvo in the
struggle could come as soon as
Nov. 25, the deadline set by a
group of settlement farmers for
the government to come to
terms with their demands for
compensation.
The farmers say they are
willing to leave the Sinai if of
fered enough money to under
write comparable enterprises in
Israel. But. they insist that if Be
gin refuses to meet with them
when he returns from his visit to
the United States, they will cut
off all traffic on the Sinai
coastal road.
Threatened normalizations
Shaoul Sela, who owns a house
and 20 acres of tomato crops in
the Moshav Sedot agricultural
cooperative across the road
from Yamit, said the demon
strations could lead to serious
tensions between Israel and
Egypt and ruin normalization of
relations between the two coun
tries.
"All it takes is one stone
thrown at an Egyptian diplomat
in his car. We will cut the road
with tractors, trucks and every
thing we have. We have lots of
equipment, and nothing will
move on that road for weeks,"
Sela said.
The settlers offered a pre
view of the disruption last year
protesting turnover of the cen
tral Sinai, including the nearby
Arab town of El Arish. Scores of
flatbed trucks and tractors were
driven onto the highway and left
there in a hopelessly entangled
jumble of equipment, as the
farmers walked away with their
ignition keys. Some erected
makeshift barriers and burned
tires.
Sela and many other farmers
here say they hope it will not
come to that again. But they say
they have become embittered
and depressed because the gov
ernment is not offering them
enough to resettle elsewhere.
The farmers are particularly
torn, they say, because when
they moved here with the
pioneering spirit of Zionism,
they had to toil ceaselessly and
invest all their money into con
verting the land from sand
dunes to productive soil.
"This isn't soil; it's sand. And
any money I've made I've had to
invest back into it for equip
ment, water and other things.
Why should I bother to put more
money into it now, when it is
going to be given to the Egyp
♦ians?" Sela asked.
"People are becoming very
bitter. More and more of them
are becoming fanatic as the
deadline gets closer. The land
we're talking about is a fraction
of the Sinai. Why can't Israel
keep it? Egypt isn't going to go
to war over some tomatoes.
People fight wars over oil, not
tomatoes."
