# Chinese press attempts to legitimize Jiang's trial
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Strong indication emerged Saturday
that the current trial of Jiang Qing, the widow of
Mao Zedong, and other leaders from China's Cul
tural Revolution is not fully accepted despite the
radicals' prolonged vilification here.
The Communist Party newspaper People's Dai
ly devoted a third of its front page to a commen
tary justifying the trial, which began last week af
ter lengthy delays, as the prosecution of danger
ous criminals and not simply political retribution
by those now in power.
"The crimes in the indictment are really shock
ing.'' the commentary said. "They show that
Jiang Qing and her ilk do not just have different
political views or have committed mistakes in
their political line, but are counterrevolutionary
criminals whose hands are stained with the blood
of tens of thousands of people."
This is a principal point of the trial — proving
that the radicals abused their power so greatly
that they had crossed the line into crime — but the
whole People's Daily commentary, the biggest
and most prominent since preparations for the
trial began, was directed at a significant audience
that apparently does not accept this outlook
Political losers
Some people continue to believe that the radi
cals are simply the losers in the power struggle
that ensued with Mao's death and are guilty of
nothing more, an editor of the party newspaper re
marked Saturday; others feel that the radicals'
policies were basically correct, though there
were certainly mistakes in the way they were car
ried out for which the whole party bears responsi
bility.
"The number of these people is few, but their
influence is still considerable," a senior editor of
another leading Chinese newspaper added during
a discussion of the trial. "We hope that the trial
will enable everyone to distinguish between politi-

cal mistakes and criminal activities. This is even
more important for our future work than for eval
uating the past."
Citing the charge that Jiang ordered the arrest
and torture of 11 persons, two of whom died as a
result, in order to concoct evidence against Liu
Shao-chi. the former chief of state, the People's
Daily commentary asked. "What mistake in polit
ical line is this? There were so many frameups
that led to tens of thousands and hundreds of
thousands of deaths — what mistake in political
line caused them?"
More than disfavor
But the lengthy list of kidnappings, secret ar
rests. torture victims and premeditated murders,
personally ordered by those on trial now, the Peo
ple's Daily continued, should convince everyone
that they are criminals and not just today's politi
cal outs.
Jiang's refusal to cooperate with the author
ities delayed the trial nearly a month beyond its
scheduled opening. Chinese sources have con
firmed. and there is still concern about the impact
of her defense that "whatever I did was done on
orders from Chairman Mao."
Deng Xiaoping, a party vice chairman, who has
pushed the trial despite the misgivings of other
members of the current leadership, said in a tele
vision interview broadcast here last week that
Mao's role in the Cultural Revolution would in
evitably be examined during the trial, but that the
party Central Committee would pass judgment on
him at its next meeting when it sums up the les
sons of the past 30 years.
When the trial resumes early this week, the
court will break into two sections, one to hear the
evidence against Jiang, other members of the
(iang of Four and Chen Boda, Mao's old political
adviser, and the other to try the five generals
charged with plotting to murder Mao in 1971 in a
military coup d'etat that failed.
