We have some words of dissent on last
week's Quad courtyard column from Kathy
Hemenway. a graduate student in the Psy
chology Department. In Urban Studies 165 last
spring, she and two other students, Jim
Marsho and Augusto Failde. took up the ques
tion of how best to resurface the Inner Quad.
Their conclusion was contrary to the re
asphalting proposal developed by the Planning
Office.
This counter-proposal was explained in the
June 11 issue of Campus Report. It recom
mends that the crumbling asphalt and gravel
now covering most of the Quad be replaced not
by new blacktop, but with brick, tile or paving
stones. And instead of merely enlarging the
present planting circles, their plan would add
four more. These would be planted mostly with
grass to provide comfortable and relaxing
places to sit, yet they would be raised above
ground level to discourage bicycles.
Hemenway is vociferously opposed to repay
ing in asphalt. "There are a hundred and one
reasons against it. It would change the entire
ecology of the Inner Quad. Imagine the heat in
summer from 147,000 square feet of asphalt! It
should not even be a consideration. In terms of
heat absorption it would be worse than what we
have now. Donors should be presented with a
plan for something really desirable, even if it
will cost more."
Here is a question of the keeps-you-up-at
night variety.
Dear Bug Me,
My knowledge of German is at best
fragmentary and certainly rusty. Every time I
pass Haus Mitteleuropa, however, the name
strikes me as a flagrant Gallicism, modelled
inappropriately after "Casa Italiana" and
"Maison Francaise." It bugs me. Surely the
German theme house should be called "Mit
teleuropahaus," shouldn't it?
D.H.P.
No, it shouldn't. "Italiana" and "Fran
caise" are adjectives referring to "house,"
and are placed, as the languages prescribe, af
ter the noun. "Mitteleuropa" is a proper noun,
not an adjective.
Here's where things get tougher. Since in
German nouns in the genetive case follow the
noun referred to, one might suspect that "Mit
teleuropa" is in the genetive (as in "House of

Middle Europe") and sits right where it
belongs. But we are dealing with German here,
not just any foreign language, so such an easy
and pleasing analysis is most certainly incor:
rect.
I base this reply on the statements of several
instructors in the German Studies department.
Professor Walter Lohnes, who was responsible
for inventing the name, claims that "Mit
teleuropahaus" never even occurred to him."
His colleagues agree with his judgment —
"Mitteleuropahaus" would be correct as a
compound noun, but sounds awful. Lohnes felt*
that "Mitteleuropahaus" is a word that con-1
notes just any old German clubhouse, whereas
•'Haus Mitteleuropa" is a real name. Since
both words are nouns in the nominative case,'
either arrangement is correct; the one in use is -
simply more elegant. I was given the example '
of Hotel Vier Jahrzeiten - The Hotel Four Sea
sons in Hamburg - as a similar example. Like
wise. one might think of Hotel George V in Par
is. Good company, as you can see.
People who ask questions like this should be
required to decline some German adjectives or
decipher a paragraph from a scholarly text as
penanc&.
What? You wish to know where they got
"Mitteleuropa" in the first place? According
to Lohnes, the German Studies Department is
not just for Germans; it concerns itself with
other German-speaking countries as well. So
for the sake of an international spirit, as well
as euphony, the founders decided against "das
Deutsche Haus." Sind Sie zufrieden?
Dear Bug Me,
What happened to the ride board in Tres
idder?
Hank
David Yob, president of Alpha Phi Omega,
the campus service organization, replies that
Tresidder Union had the board taken down at
the beginning of the quarter for aesthetic rea
sons. A temporary arrangement can now be
found on the large bulletin board opposite the
old ride board location. A new map and better
sign will be added by the end of this quarter.

fragmentary and certainly rusty. Every time I
pass Haus Mitteleuropa, however, the name
strikes me as a flagrant Gallicism, modelled
inappropriately after "Casa Italiana" and
"Maison Francaise." It bugs me. Surely the
German theme house should be called "Mit
teleuropahaus," shouldn't it?
D.H.P.
No, it shouldn't. "Italiana" and "Fran
caise" are adjectives referring to "house,"
and are placed, as the languages prescribe, af
ter the noun. "Mitteleuropa" is a proper noun,
not an adjective.
Here's where things get tougher. Since in
German nouns in the genetive case follow the
noun referred to, one might suspect that "Mit
teleuropa" is in the genetive (as in "House of

Middle Europe") and sits right where it
belongs. But we are dealing with German here,
not just any foreign language, so such an easy
and pleasing analysis is most certainly incor:
rect.
I base this reply on the statements of several
instructors in the German Studies department.
Professor Walter Lohnes, who was responsible
for inventing the name, claims that "Mit
teleuropahaus" never even occurred to him."
His colleagues agree with his judgment —
"Mitteleuropahaus" would be correct as a
compound noun, but sounds awful. Lohnes felt*
that "Mitteleuropahaus" is a word that con-1
notes just any old German clubhouse, whereas
•'Haus Mitteleuropa" is a real name. Since
both words are nouns in the nominative case,'
either arrangement is correct; the one in use is -
simply more elegant. I was given the example '
of Hotel Vier Jahrzeiten - The Hotel Four Sea
sons in Hamburg - as a similar example. Like
wise. one might think of Hotel George V in Par
is. Good company, as you can see.
People who ask questions like this should be
required to decline some German adjectives or
decipher a paragraph from a scholarly text as
penanc&.
What? You wish to know where they got
"Mitteleuropa" in the first place? According
to Lohnes, the German Studies Department is
not just for Germans; it concerns itself with
other German-speaking countries as well. So
for the sake of an international spirit, as well
as euphony, the founders decided against "das
Deutsche Haus." Sind Sie zufrieden?
Dear Bug Me,
What happened to the ride board in Tres
idder?
Hank
David Yob, president of Alpha Phi Omega,
the campus service organization, replies that
Tresidder Union had the board taken down at
the beginning of the quarter for aesthetic rea
sons. A temporary arrangement can now be
found on the large bulletin board opposite the
old ride board location. A new map and better
sign will be added by the end of this quarter.

We have some words of dissent on last
week's Quad courtyard column from Kathy
Hemenway. a graduate student in the Psy
chology Department. In Urban Studies 165 last
spring, she and two other students, Jim
Marsho and Augusto Failde. took up the ques
tion of how best to resurface the Inner Quad.
Their conclusion was contrary to the re
asphalting proposal developed by the Planning
Office.
This counter-proposal was explained in the
June 11 issue of Campus Report. It recom
mends that the crumbling asphalt and gravel
now covering most of the Quad be replaced not
by new blacktop, but with brick, tile or paving
stones. And instead of merely enlarging the
present planting circles, their plan would add
four more. These would be planted mostly with
grass to provide comfortable and relaxing
places to sit, yet they would be raised above
ground level to discourage bicycles.
Hemenway is vociferously opposed to repay
ing in asphalt. "There are a hundred and one
reasons against it. It would change the entire
ecology of the Inner Quad. Imagine the heat in
summer from 147,000 square feet of asphalt! It
should not even be a consideration. In terms of
heat absorption it would be worse than what we
have now. Donors should be presented with a
plan for something really desirable, even if it
will cost more."
Here is a question of the keeps-you-up-at
night variety.
