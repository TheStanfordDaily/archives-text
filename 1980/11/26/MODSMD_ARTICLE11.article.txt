# Positive pregnancy tests up 300% since 1973 at Cornell

### Sue Katz Donna Young 
In the last 12 months, Cowell
Student Health Center proc
essed 196 positive pregnancy
tests. This is twice the number
in 1975 and three times the

number in 1973, when Dr. John
Dorman, staff physician, began
keeping count.
Of the 105 women who filled
out questionnaires last year, 71
percent said that the pregnan
cies were unplanned. Three
fourths of the unplanned preg
nancies were to single women.
The small sample size and the
fact that Stanford students can
go outside of Cowell for preg
nancy tests make general
izations about the entire Stan
ford community difficult.
Dorman, however, compared
earlier Cowell data with his
more recent results.
Despite the increase since
1973, said Dorman. "The preg
nancy rate at Stanford is low
compared to other colleges."
In a previous article and in a
recent interview, Dorman sug
gested the increase is due to a
greater tendency for women to
use diaphragms rather than the
Pill or lUD, "and while regular
diaphragm use with therapeutic
abortion as a backup is a viable
alternative to pill use, irregular
diaphragm use or no method is
not; unfortunately, one of the
principal inherent defects of the
diaphragm is that it requires in
itiative and motivation each
time intercourse occurs."
The women who participated
in last year's study were also

questioned about their future
plans. Most (60 percent) of the
married women with unplanned
pregnancies indicated a desire
to continue the pregnancy to
term. There seemed to be no dif
ference between dependents
(wives of students > and married
students. Thirty-five percent
wanted abortions, and five
percent were undecided at the
time of the questionnaire.
Nearly three-fourths of the
single students with unplanned
pregnancies wanted abortions.
Seven percent planned to keep
their babies, and the others
were undecided.
Of the 74 women with un
planned pregnancies, two were
on the Pill, seven had lUD's, 30
reported use of the diaphragm,
four used foam and condom,
seven used condoms alone, eight
used withdrawal, 17 used the
rhythm method, and 11 used no
method. (Some women cited
more than one method.)
For comparison, Dorman col
lected information on birth con
trol methods from a control
group.
He interviewed 132 con
secutive patients, and of 100 who
were sexually active, 41 used
diaphragms, 28 were on the Pill,
12 had lUD's, and seven used no
contraception.
