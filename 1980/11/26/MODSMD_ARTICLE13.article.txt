# Fountain a spectacle of light, sound
## 
### Kim Brown 
A tangled spoke and handlebar sculpture
once dominated the courtyard between the
Green and Meyer libraries. Overflowing the
bike racks and spilling onto the brick pat
terned walkway, it still stands as a free
form statement of self-discipline and the
pressures of university life.
But recently, a dramatic sculptural foun
tain, donated to the University by Forrest
and Patsy Shumway, class of 1950, was com
pleted. Now the two share the same area —
the web of bicycles as a reminder of the in
tense environment, and the fountain as a
pleasant escape from it all.
Surrounded on three sides by steps rising
in amphitheater style, the fountain is invit
ing and intimate, drawing people toward it
for a little while or maybe longer.
On a Thursday afternoon, five people are
enjoying the spectacle of water, light and
sound. The water falls in a cylindrical veil
from a rich-red steel pipe, suspended can
tilevered fashion, eight feet above a 30-foot
pool. The sculpture is shaped by two tubes of
the piping, a foot in diameter, which rise
from the concrete pool and swing apart at
right angles, forming a horizontal circle.
The effect is of a round room of water gen
tly moving in the breeze and creating a soft,
steady sound as it cascades into the pool
below. Stare at the curtain of shimmering
rivulets for a moment, and they become
almost mesmerizing. The water appears to
be running simultaneously up and down, or
simply vibrating in stationary strands.
2:38 p.m. The sun is high in the sky and
casts short shadows down the steps surroun
ding the fountain. It's a natural gathering
place, and people are talking quietly in
pairs. The atmosphere is soothing and in
timate.
2:43. Two newcomers arrive. What do
they think of the fountain? "1 like the sound
of the water all the time —it's like the ocean
— except I've never seen an ocean before.''
"The color's tone is such a deep red, too

deep for the Spanish tile on the other build
ings. It sort of pulsates — but don't get me
wrong, I like it all in all," says the other.
"1 think the University needed something
unique like this."
"Well, it's nice, but the money could've
been put to better use."
3:00. The first pair has disappeared. An
other fountain sitter arrives alone: "This is
my first time here, but I'll be back. I'm a
hydrophiliac. It's very easy to sit here lis
tening and letting the sound isolate me from
the pressures out there so I can think."
3:08. Another lone contemplator says,
"The sound reminds me of a creek near
where I used to live ... I like it. But when
you look at the thing, you know it's not going
to work in a couple of months. Look, some of
the nozzles are plugged up already."
3:13. A boy, about five or six years old,
walks up with his father. "Daddy," he ex
claims, "it looks like someone from out
erspace brought a ring from Saturn here in a
UFO."
3:15. The sun is lower in the sky, and
clouds are moving in. The air has grown
cool The people here a half hour ago have
all left, but others come and go.
The shadows that were only beginning to
move down the steps in the early afternoon
have now darkened them completely. The
cement amphitheater, a definite part of the
entire effect, already shows traces of vis
itors — a sprinkling of cigarette butts, a
bookslip from Meyer, a torn and weathered
baggie.
3:20. Someone reading on the grass
nearby says,"I sit here cause I like the
bells, the ones in Hoover Tower. The foun
tain? I don't know, between the color and
the shape I don't really like it ... it does
sound nice.though."
3:23. Someone else, reading on the nearby
grass, comments, "It sounds nice and lives
up to its function as a relaxing background,
but the tubes are too thick. The red tubes

should be of a smaller circumference since
the individual streams of water are so thin. I
do think the color is nice, though. Every
thing else around here is so muted. "
3:30. A student on his way into Green Li
brary has stopped for a moment: " You want
my honest opinion? OK, I think it looks like a
shower — a pleasant shower Some night
soon I'm planning to come back with a bar of
soap."
The water rushes over earth-toned tiles
lining the bottom of the pool. Brownish
foam is already collecting around the edges
and bobbing along in small clumps.
3:45. The sun has re-emerged from behind
the clouds. The fountain, viewed with the
sun behind it, is ablaze, each . trand of water
illuminated, the spray like white sparks.
3:55. Someone sitting on the steps fac
ing into the sun is trying to read a book. "It's
a nice sound, kind of like a waterfall, but I
wish it had been more aesthetically de
signed. What do I mean by aesthetically? I
prefer more realistic types of images —
fish, turtles, cherubs — you know, the kind
spitting out water, as opposed to an iron
sausage. Yes, I'm serious.
"The color doesn't really bother me. I
like red. and I think it fits in here ... a prop
er memorial to another rich person's fan
tasy. I don't think utilitarianism would be
the end of people's fantasies. I think we need
to spend even more money on art. We spend
too much now on military budgets."
4:15. The sun drifts behind the edge of
Cubberley, and the fountain is cast in com
plete shadow. The air grows chill The steps
feel damp.
Everyone has left, except for one last
fountain-sitter. The strands forming the veil
of water, the sound, the total effect, seem to
have hypnotized him.
"No, this is the first time I've really sat
here. Why am I here now? To tell you the
truth, I was on mv way into the library and
