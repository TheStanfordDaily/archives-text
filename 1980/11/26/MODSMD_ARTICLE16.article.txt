## In search of the ideal idol 
### 
The Stanford mascot search, one of the fore
most concerns of this year s devoted student gov
ernment. will culminate in a historic election this
spring, wherein the ten-year quest for the ideal
idol may finally be resolved It is now the respon
sibility of all current class members to carefully
contemplate this monumental decision, con
tribute any idol ideas, and prepare to support the
victorious mascot Thus will pass the era of the
generic Stanford T-shirt
Although having to elect our own mascot may
somewhat diminish its sense of historic continui
ty. what we lack in tradition will be compensated
for by virtue of democratic representation. While
other schools must concede to an arbitrary
legacy, our generation has the unique opportunity
to instigate a truly representative heritage, so
there's no reason we can't conjure up some new
mascot even more symbolic than the obsolete' In
dians."
Come to think of it. I don't think "Indians" was
ever very representative of the University any
way. so we shouldn't have any trouble coming up
with a more appropriate mascot I mean I could
understand Stanford "Coolies." but what did Indi
ans ever do for this place, except perhaps just die
off and thus inadvertently relinquish their
birthright to the proprietorship of the University?
On second thought, that's really all little Leland
ever did for us and he got the wbole thing named
after him!
The problem remains one of determining the
quintessential mascot from the slew of sugges
tions available. Though proposals so far range
from Stanford "Doobies" to Stanford "Drug
gies," no really definitive choice has yet
emerged. Perhaps at this point it would be helpful
to systematically investigate the mascot poten
tial of some of the more prominent suggestions
Here follows my assessment of the mascot alter
natives.
The Stanford "Trees" are one natural choice
for the new mascot, with support already wide
spread and growing. They are upstanding, fresh,
and in fact the worst thing that can be said about
trees is that they just aren't very offensive. I
mean, trees can be cut down, burned, pulverized,
or uprooted, and subjected to unglamorous abuse
by such rivals as bears, beavers, and huskies. Los
ing the Big Game would be an especially cutting
blow, for if we ever "got the Axe." we would all
really be board Frankly, though I think trees
make great logos, they're just not mascot materi
al.
Then what about the Griffins? Although this
choice for a mascot also seems very popular. I re
ally don't see its qualifications. It has been argued
that Griffins suposedly "eat" bears, I admit this
is of consumate importance when we play Cal. but
what about our other competition - ' How could we
be sure Griffins could hold down the Trojans, or do
the job on the Beavers?
One very obviously suitable suggestion for our
mascot is the Stanford "Alligators." It has been
pointed out that the transition would be very
smooth as the place is already crawling with

them Although this seems like a good idea. 1 just
can't see prescribing to a non-exclusively Stan
ford fashion trend While we obviously have a
plentitude of preppies here, we've hardly a
monopoly on the uniform, so choosing our mascot
to be the Stanford "Alligators'' would be as ludi
crous as calling ourselves the Stanford
"Topsiders," which come to think of it. might be
even more appropriate
Speaking of appropriation, one very candid pro
posal for the Stanford mascot is "Robber
Barons But although this one may appeal very
much to one's sense of poetic justice. 1 question
whether we really want to be this frank and judg
mental There's no telling what grave truths may
lie buried within the fortune which begot this Uni
versity. so perhaps it's best just to let dead men
lie
Of course the "Cardinals" has supposedly
served us as surrogate mascot, since the demise
of the Indian, yet it seems the idea has never real
ly taken off One suggestion to rouse more student
interest is to resign ourselves to the "Cardinal
Sins This certainly sounds more tempting than
straight "Cardinals." and is sure to entice more
student commitment, but the alumni would prob
ably never forgive us.
Besides these suggestions, there remain many
more intriguing propositions which deserve more
attention than they have so far received. That of
the Stanford "Studs." (short for students. I pre
sume i. is certainly worthy of mention, though
none too exciting. Another suitable suggestion,
the Stanford "Coppertones." I think well ex
emplifies the climate of the University and would
sort of "rub it in" for our frigid Eastern coun
terparts.
Of course the Stanford WASPS is a very ap
propriate possibility, but for the benefit of those
not particularly religious among us, I would only
recommend one minor alteration "Theology Op
tional" in place of "Protestants" would render us
the Stanford "WASTOS."
There are many more worthy proposals, yet of
the wealth of suggestions for mascot, the Stanford
Bucks" seems to me the most truly character
istic of the principles of the University. Although
we'd have to change our colors < we couldn't be the
team "in the red" >, it would be worth it to always
have green backs on our side. The metaphorical
possibilities would be priceless; dollar signs
playing before our eyes . . . flagrantly flaunting
our bucks at the Big Game; that it is so blatant
lends a kind of integrity to the overall crassness of
the idea.
The Stanford "Buck" would be a profoundly
symbolic mascot, as we'd be putting our values on
the line at every game. I'm sure it would hold the
interest of the entire University and in fact. I'm
only concerned that it may become gradually less
effective each year. Even so. I have great faith
that with the Stanford "Bucks" we'll be able to re
cover any deficits, make up any loss, and be richer
for the experience, as long as we keep our cents of
identity.

choice for a mascot also seems very popular. I re

what about our other competition - ' How could we

plentitude of preppies here, we've hardly a

to be the Stanford "Alligators'' would be as ludi

Of course the "Cardinals" has supposedly
served us as surrogate mascot, since the demise
of the Indian, yet it seems the idea has never real

interest is to resign ourselves to the "Cardinal

straight "Cardinals." and is sure to entice more
student commitment, but the alumni would prob

Besides these suggestions, there remain many
more intriguing propositions which deserve more

none too exciting. Another suitable suggestion,
the Stanford "Coppertones." I think well ex

Of course the Stanford WASPS is a very ap

possibilities would be priceless; dollar signs

our bucks at the Big Game; that it is so blatant

The Stanford "Buck" would be a profoundly
symbolic mascot, as we'd be putting our values on
the line at every game. I'm sure it would hold the
interest of the entire University and in fact. I'm
only concerned that it may become gradually less
effective each year. Even so. I have great faith
that with the Stanford "Bucks" we'll be able to re
cover any deficits, make up any loss, and be richer
for the experience, as long as we keep our cents of

The Stanford mascot search, one of the fore
most concerns of this year s devoted student gov

Come to think of it. I don't think "Indians" was
ever very representative of the University any
way. so we shouldn't have any trouble coming up
with a more appropriate mascot I mean I could
understand Stanford "Coolies." but what did Indi
ans ever do for this place, except perhaps just die
off and thus inadvertently relinquish their
birthright to the proprietorship of the University?

The problem remains one of determining the

to systematically investigate the mascot poten

Here follows my assessment of the mascot alter
natives.
The Stanford "Trees" are one natural choice
for the new mascot, with support already wide
spread and growing. They are upstanding, fresh,
and in fact the worst thing that can be said about
trees is that they just aren't very offensive. I
mean, trees can be cut down, burned, pulverized,
or uprooted, and subjected to unglamorous abuse
by such rivals as bears, beavers, and huskies. Los
ing the Big Game would be an especially cutting
blow, for if we ever "got the Axe." we would all
really be board Frankly, though I think trees
make great logos, they're just not mascot materi
