## Blanket accusations discriminate 
### 
It seems that many people be
lieve discrimination can only be
afflicted upon women and mi
norities. I will admit they have
received the worst of it, but cer
tainly discrimination is not lim
ited to these two groups
Rather, discrimination oc
curs whenever someone is not
treated equally or fairly — and
this includes men. That's right,
men can be and are dis
criminated against.
I would specifically cite Leah
Halper's columns in the Daily
as blatantly discriminatory. In
her columns she repeatedly
tries to make me and other men
feel guilty for being a white
male. When I read her columns I
become offended — and this
type of discrimination is no
more right than discrimination
against women or minorities.
In her initial column this
year, Halper said that she could
not trust any man because she
feared he might want to rape
her ; but this is hardly the case. I

realize that rape is a serious
problem but by and large it is
not a problem caused by Stan
ford men. and certainly it is a
problem that is isolated in a
select group of men Not all men
are rapists and it is unfair to
place a blanket accusation on
the male population This clear
ly is a form of discrimination.
Halper continued her re
marks in her latest column
(Daily, Nov. 20) when she
claimed that Thanksgiving is a
holiday for "white, affluent
males." This is absurd. She
lurther tries to link a female's
perverse dietary habits with
men but it is quite apparent that
her logic and argumentation
cannot be taken seriously. Once
again she applies a general un
warranted criticism to the male
population.
It seems that Halper's inten
tions are solely to attack males
for a historical problem, yet her
criticism is directed at the
wrong people. For the most

part, Stanford students are not
the ones who discriminate
against women and the men she
describes are not the typical
students of Stanford. Her at
titude is both irresponsible and
deeply offensive.
Not too long ago Halper wrote
to the Daily and complained
that the Jules Feiffer cartoons
were offensive to women and
should be discontinued. To avoid
a hypocritical double standard I
suggest that Halper's articles
be discontinued because they
are offensive to men Everv oth

er week I am subjected to a de
nunciation of my character —
solely on the basis of my gender.
Discrimination in any form is
wrong and Halper has no right to
condemn harsh treatment of
women and at the same time
continually to attack men. It
seems that she does not want
equality with men — she wants
superiority. Please, Halper.
stop pointing your finger at in
nocent males.
