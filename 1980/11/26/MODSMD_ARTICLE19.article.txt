Spoon feeding?
Ralph Phillips, Professor of
Mathematics, stated in a letter
iDaily, Nov. 20), "I suspect that
when the course is unpopular be
cause it is required, or because
it is difficult, students who are
spoon fed will rate their teach
ers more highly than students
who are required to do inde
pendent thinking." I find this
statement to be very offensive
and somewhat irresponsible.
Contrary to Professor Phil
lips' remark, I, and my col
leagues here at Stanford, have
found "spoon fed'' classes to be
just as educationally poor as
any other class. I believe that
most students who go on to sec
ondary education have a sincere
desire to learn. Frequently, it is
the manner in which the materi
al is presented which pre
cipitates the lower rating on the
evaluation.
I think there is an inherent
problem in any university which
is a major research institution':
researchers double as pro
fessors. In some cases, it be
comes obvious in their lectures
that these professors are
brilliant people who know the
subject matter but who have a
difficult time imparting their
knowledge to the student r In
my estimation, this constitutes
a bad professor, and hence, a
poor rating on the evaluation.
It is not my intention to place
students in a guiltless position.
Unfortunately, there is a minor
ity who act in precisely the fash
ion outlined by Professor Phil
lips. However, I think it is an un
fair generalization that students
prefer to be "spoon fed." Stu
dents who go on to college are
striving to establish a future for
themselves. To say that stu
dents want to have their future

"spoon fed" to them is an insult
to their integrity.

I could discuss grade techni
calities and their relationship to
our academic social structure in
"Good, better, best: will
diploma honors be next?" (Dai
ly, Nov. 18). If I did, not only
would I make a fool out of my
self, but I would probably step
on the wrong people's toes!
Why does Stanford have to re
semble "Harvard, Yale and
Princeton" as the sources
quoted in the article suggest?
University policy at the "elite"
schools is becoming a "cloned"
affair. We are not the "Harvard
of the West." but rather we are
Stanford of the Silicon Valley!
I wrote this letter "late at
night'' and therefore was not too
concerned with the article's
specifics. There was an in
teresting flavor to it. Are we
going to taste more "alka
seltzer" in the future?
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon thinks that "honoring
exemplary scholarship could
even act as incentive to (sic)
high achievement for (sic) oth
ers." If this is true, then inflat
ing academic honors may be
justified
However, we shouldn't try to
change this University into the
image of some red brick build
ing. Please, don't "Christopher
Langdellize" my under
graduate education!
