# Escondido Village housing in demand
## Donald Kennedy 
### Joan O'Connell Third in a series 
The 4000 residents of Escondido Vil
lage, the major graduate housing fa
cility here, are among the most di
verse group anywhere on campus;
they speak over 30 different languages
and range in age from a few months
old on up. Some are married, some are
single, some have children, some are
children, and about 1600 are students
at the Universityas well.
The wait to get into the Village is
more than six months and students liv
ing in the two other graduate housing
facilities — Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial — say it is the best
place graduates can live. Married stu
dents with children especially ap
preciate Escondido, because of both
the Village school, day care services
and yards in which the children can
play.
Jan Marx, assistant dean of stu
dents and director of Escondido Vil
lage, said the Village houses about one
fourth of Stanford's more than 6000
graduate students. Marx was just ap
pointed last year to the position; for
merly the Village had been treated
simply as a business, she explained,
whereas now the University is at
tempting to integrate it into the hous
ing system.
Yesterday University President
Donald Kennedy spoke to Village resi
dents about their problems. Kennedy
came to the dorm, Marx said, in an ef
fort to "touch bases" with different
residences.
The predicted 14.5 percent rent in
crease for Village residents and what
many of the students felt were ine
qualities in the graduate stipends giv
en by the University highlighted most
of the meeting, which at times found
Kennedy having to defend both his and
the University's position in the face of
clearly frustrated opponents.
In one exchange, engineering grad
uate student Marian Smith protested
the University's plans to house gradu
ate students in Manzanita Park after
the new dorpiitory is built. Smith,,
who said she had lived there herself,
called the trailers "horrible."
Kennedy said that while the trailers
are not in the same shape they were in
1970, "they are by no means mi
serable."
Kennedy said it was the nature of
temporary housing that the need re
mains constant although the facility
outlives its predicted life.

' "I predict after they (graduate stu
dents) live therefor a while, they will
want to keep it."
"They will have no choice; where
can you go off campus?" Smith re
plied.
Other students expressed dis
satisfaction with the percentage of
their rent increase which will fund the
building of the new undergradate
dormitory.
Kennedy said the University also
would like to build a 1600-unit facility
which would house a good number of
graduate students, but that currently
plans for such a facility are entangled
in local politics.
Although he recognized the needs of
the graduate community, Kennedy
said the University saw "a higher
priority to fill the unfulfilled needs of
undergraduates than those of gradu
ates," at this time.
The meeting, which lasted over an
hour, also included a short discussion
of the alienation and isolation which
some graduate students said they felt
as the result of no strong graduate stu
dent association and lack of a good ori
entation program for graduate stu
dents.
Kennedy noted that isolation seems
less prevalent among the professional
schools and sciences — "there is a cer
tain fellowship of the bench" — than
among graduate students in the hu
manities, but he said he thought ef
forts at making students feel a part of
the University should begin within the
departments.
"I think a strong graduate student
association is essential (for fostering
interaction among graduate students
of different departments and schools)
and I will try to talk up initiatives for
people to do that," he said.
Following the meeting, the group
seemed to have mixed reactions. One
student said she felt "frustrated,"
while another said she thought Ken
nedy "answered all the questions
straightforwardly and wasn't afraid
to say what he thought."
Although the meeting only at
tracted about 25 people, Marx said she
was "enthused for the people who did
come and got a chance to talk with
President Kennedy."
"Improvement comes slowly," she
said.
Part of the restructuring of the Vil
lage has been the separating of the
1299 apartments, both low and high
rise, into 22 neighborhoods, "to en

courage a sense of local identity,"
Marx said. In eight of the neighbor
hoods. the Office of Residential
Education has funded "neighborhood
coordinator" positions basically,
Marx explained, "to create a neigh
borhood network which people can
plug in and out of if they want to." This
network plans social activites. dis
cusses problems of concern to Village
residents and tries to deal with every
day situations like childcare and
maintenance problems.
Marx, in trying to plan activites for
the diverse group, daily faces the
problem, as graduate student Leslie
Swetnam put it, of "you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make hiir.
drink. You can plan all kinds of ac
tivites for graduate students but many
of them just won't go."
For instance "married students
with young children might get very en
thused about an Easter Egg hunt, but
that wouldn't have much appeal for
single students," Marx laughed.
"There is no prescription for what
should happen in each neighborhood —
you must give people freedom and just

make it a place where an idea can take
root."
"We don't need a recreation chair
man with a whistle ordering every
body into the pool." Marx added,
saying that most of the activities in
volve trying to welcome new students
to the Village.
The neighborhood coordinators, in
turn, provide different services for
their respective clusters or buildings.
Debbie Laßue, a neighborhood coordi
nator for Barnes, has created a neigh

borhood newsletter called "The
Tusk." The newsletter features items
of interest to residents like rent in
creases. employment opportunities,
etc.
Laßue is not only active within her
neighborhood, but is also an outspoken
advocate of graduate students as a
whole, especially in regard to housing.
Graduate students have been neg
lected too long," she said. "Graduate
students' rent money pours into the
housing system that funds both grad
and undergrad residences. But grad
students receive little or no benefits in
terms of housing available, staff and
* program money. It's time graduate
students get a fair share of housing,
staff and recognition from the Univer
sity," she said.

turn, provide different services for
their respective clusters or buildings.
Debbie Laßue, a neighborhood coordi
nator for Barnes, has created a neigh

borhood newsletter called "The
Tusk." The newsletter features items
of interest to residents like rent in
creases. employment opportunities,
etc.
Laßue is not only active within her
neighborhood, but is also an outspoken
advocate of graduate students as a
whole, especially in regard to housing.
Graduate students have been neg
lected too long," she said. "Graduate
students' rent money pours into the
housing system that funds both grad
and undergrad residences. But grad
students receive little or no benefits in
terms of housing available, staff and
* program money. It's time graduate
students get a fair share of housing,
staff and recognition from the Univer
sity," she said.

The 4000 residents of Escondido Vil
lage, the major graduate housing fa
cility here, are among the most di
verse group anywhere on campus;
they speak over 30 different languages
and range in age from a few months
old on up. Some are married, some are
single, some have children, some are
children, and about 1600 are students
at the Universityas well.
The wait to get into the Village is
more than six months and students liv
ing in the two other graduate housing
facilities — Crothers Hall and
Crothers Memorial — say it is the best
place graduates can live. Married stu
dents with children especially ap
preciate Escondido, because of both
the Village school, day care services
and yards in which the children can
play.
Jan Marx, assistant dean of stu
dents and director of Escondido Vil
lage, said the Village houses about one
fourth of Stanford's more than 6000
graduate students. Marx was just ap
pointed last year to the position; for
merly the Village had been treated
simply as a business, she explained,
whereas now the University is at
tempting to integrate it into the hous
ing system.
Yesterday University President
Donald Kennedy spoke to Village resi
dents about their problems. Kennedy
came to the dorm, Marx said, in an ef
fort to "touch bases" with different
residences.
The predicted 14.5 percent rent in
crease for Village residents and what
many of the students felt were ine
qualities in the graduate stipends giv
en by the University highlighted most
of the meeting, which at times found
Kennedy having to defend both his and
the University's position in the face of
clearly frustrated opponents.
In one exchange, engineering grad
uate student Marian Smith protested
the University's plans to house gradu
ate students in Manzanita Park after
the new dorpiitory is built. Smith,,
who said she had lived there herself,
called the trailers "horrible."
Kennedy said that while the trailers
are not in the same shape they were in
1970, "they are by no means mi
serable."
Kennedy said it was the nature of
temporary housing that the need re
mains constant although the facility
outlives its predicted life.

' "I predict after they (graduate stu
dents) live therefor a while, they will
want to keep it."
"They will have no choice; where
can you go off campus?" Smith re
plied.
Other students expressed dis
satisfaction with the percentage of
their rent increase which will fund the
building of the new undergradate
dormitory.
Kennedy said the University also
would like to build a 1600-unit facility
which would house a good number of
graduate students, but that currently
plans for such a facility are entangled
in local politics.
Although he recognized the needs of
the graduate community, Kennedy
said the University saw "a higher
priority to fill the unfulfilled needs of
undergraduates than those of gradu
ates," at this time.
The meeting, which lasted over an
hour, also included a short discussion
of the alienation and isolation which
some graduate students said they felt
as the result of no strong graduate stu
dent association and lack of a good ori
entation program for graduate stu
dents.
Kennedy noted that isolation seems
less prevalent among the professional
schools and sciences — "there is a cer
tain fellowship of the bench" — than
among graduate students in the hu
manities, but he said he thought ef
forts at making students feel a part of
the University should begin within the
departments.
"I think a strong graduate student
association is essential (for fostering
interaction among graduate students
of different departments and schools)
and I will try to talk up initiatives for
people to do that," he said.
Following the meeting, the group
seemed to have mixed reactions. One
student said she felt "frustrated,"
while another said she thought Ken
nedy "answered all the questions
straightforwardly and wasn't afraid
to say what he thought."
Although the meeting only at
tracted about 25 people, Marx said she
was "enthused for the people who did
come and got a chance to talk with
President Kennedy."
"Improvement comes slowly," she
said.
Part of the restructuring of the Vil
lage has been the separating of the
1299 apartments, both low and high
rise, into 22 neighborhoods, "to en

courage a sense of local identity,"
Marx said. In eight of the neighbor
hoods. the Office of Residential
Education has funded "neighborhood
coordinator" positions basically,
Marx explained, "to create a neigh
borhood network which people can
plug in and out of if they want to." This
network plans social activites. dis
cusses problems of concern to Village
residents and tries to deal with every
day situations like childcare and
maintenance problems.
Marx, in trying to plan activites for
the diverse group, daily faces the
problem, as graduate student Leslie
Swetnam put it, of "you can lead a
horse to water but you can't make hiir.
drink. You can plan all kinds of ac
tivites for graduate students but many
of them just won't go."
For instance "married students
with young children might get very en
thused about an Easter Egg hunt, but
that wouldn't have much appeal for
single students," Marx laughed.
"There is no prescription for what
should happen in each neighborhood —
you must give people freedom and just

make it a place where an idea can take
root."
"We don't need a recreation chair
man with a whistle ordering every
body into the pool." Marx added,
saying that most of the activities in
volve trying to welcome new students
to the Village.
