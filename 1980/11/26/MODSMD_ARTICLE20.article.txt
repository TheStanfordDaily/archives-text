## Don Willenburg Only justice suffered at Greensboro

Last Monday, an all-white
jury in Greensboro. North Caro
lina acquitted four Ku Klux
Klansmen and two Nazis of the
murder of five Communist
Workers Party members killed
during a CWF "Death to the
Klan" rally at a black housing
project there November 3. 1979.
It took the jury of six men and
six women seven days to decide
that the Klansmen and Nazis
had acted in self-defense. Said
one juror after the verdict,
"How can you say one side is
guilty when both sides are guil
ty? Both sides were*guilty and
there were aggressive actions
bv both sides."

It seems true that the CWP in
vited a confrontation by
challenging the Klan to appear
at the rally. Videotapes taken by
four television stations covering
the rally showed a stick fight
fight escalate into a gun battle
as men with rifles and shotguns
fired at men and women less
well armed (but armed, none
theless) a few yards away.
The results of the battle â€”
five dead communists, all
Klansmen and Nazis still alive
-- makes it difficult to believe
that the provocation was intense
enough to justify a homicidal
response. Simple criminal trials
seldom achieve national
notoriety unless they are im
bued with controversial politi
cal overtones. The Greensboro
case became a test case for ra
cial violence* Both racists and
communists were attaching
great significance to the ver
dict : both hoped to use it to their
political advantage. Both sides
won; only justice suffered at the
Greensboro trial.
After the verdict, the Klan
and Nazis claimed a "victory
for white America." In the face
of calls for a special federal in
vestigation of possible civil
rights violations in connection
with the killings, Nazi leader
Harold Covington of Raleigh
called for the secession of North
and South Carolina from the
United States. Covington said
his proposed new nation, the
"Carolina Free State." would
deport everyone of "non-white,
.Jewish, or mixed racial
makeup," and that the Nazis
are already importing "white
racialists" from around the
country to the Carolinas.
The CWF is a tiny, semi
choate Maoist organization that
originated in a communist study
group in New York's Chi
natown The group began mov
ing to the Southeast several
years ago in an attempt to or
ganize labor in the factories.
They found the North Carolina
workers resistant to com
munism and early last year de
cided on a shift in strategy. The
CWF targeted the Klan in an at
tempt to engage support by op

position to increased racial vio
lence throughout the South. In
July, the CWP, then called the
Workers Viewpoint Organiza
tion. disrupted a Klan meeting
at China Grove, North Carolina.
The "Death to the Klan" rally
was only the latest in a series of
attempts by the CWP to paint
itself as the only alternative to
the Klan.
After the killings, the CWP
attempted to capitalize on the
publicity they generated. The
group assumed its current name
and in cities across the country
distributed posters com
memorating the five dead
"freedom fighters." The party
became more militant, more
vocal, claiming responsibility
for both the disturbance at the
Democratic National Conven
tion and the assault on John An
derson with an egg in Colorado.
From the outset, the CWP
labeled the Greensboro trial a
sham and refused any involve
ment in its prosecution. The
CWP claimed that a govern
ment Klan-Nazi conspiracy
would exonerate the killers and
that it was refusing to partici
pate in a "whitewash."
Conspiracy or not, it was
clear that there was little sym
pathy for the CWP in the
Guilford County Court. Nazi
leader Covington, in between
press conferences warning
about the dangers of com
munism and the need for a re
sponse by working-class patri
ots, said that his colleagues on
trial "couldn't have found a
more sympathetic jury." One
juror said he felt that Klansmen
and Nazis were basically patri
otic and that the communists
were out for publicity and
needed a martyr.
The CWP's actions hardly en
couraged a different interpreta
tion. By refusing even to testify,
the CWP helped guarantee the
acquittal of the Nazis and
Klansmen, and now seeks to
take advantage of the outrage
generated by that acquittal. The
CWP seems concerned with a
justice greater than mere crim
inal penalties for assailants and

murderers. They prefer, in
stead, to attack businessmen
and politicians as inherently in
sensitive and to proclaim them
selves the vanguard of a rising
proletarian revolt.
There has been considerable
outrage engendered by the ver
dict in Greensboro. Dr. Joseph
Lowery. president of the South
ern Christian Leadership Con
ference, sent telegrams to Pres
ident Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan in which he said that
American justice is in a "co
matose state," and demanded a
Justice Department investiga
tion. Dr. George Simpkins, j
president of the Greensboro/
chapter of the NAACP, said the
verdict is "tantamount to giving
the Nazis a license to kill."
These would seem overstate
ments were it not for the fact
that the Klan and Nazis are ap
parently also willing to accept
them as true. The verdict seems
more important to black and ra
cist perceptions when it is
linked to a recent rash of de
cisions in racially sensitive
cases. An all-white jury in Mi
ami acquitted policemen ac
cused of beating a black insur
ance salesman to death over a
minor traffic violation. Another
all-white jury in Chattanooga
acquitted Klansmen of shooting
black women. Some Klansmen
and Nazis have already pro
claimed that these verdicts rep
resent an endorsement of their
policies and a green light for
further violence.
If these verdicts are. in fact, a
signal that 'it's open season on
niggers," the CWP has been giv
ing away hunting licenses. As
coldhearted as Klan and Nazi vi
olence is, the CWP is ready to
sacrifice the very people in
whose interest it claims to act to
advance its philosophy and or
ganization. Blood spilled by
Klan and Nazi groups spreading
their philosophy of hate will be
blood spilled by the CWP in its
futile and heartless quest for
recognition.
