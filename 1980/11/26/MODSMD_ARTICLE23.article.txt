## Government regulation hampers business Reagan will cut federal red tape 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — As he
crisscrossed the country in his
quest for the White House,
Ronald Reagan promised at
almost every stop that one of
his highest priorities would be
getting the federal government
off the backs of the American
people.
Now. as President-elect, Re
agan is sending his transition
teams burrowing into the Cabi
net departments'and independ
ent agencies responsible for all
those thousands of regulations,
the question agitating bureau
crats, businessmen and liberal
activists alike is: Just what
does Reagan really want to do.
and how much will he actually
be able to do?
The answer, apparently, is:
quite a bit.
Planned changes
Talks with business officials
and regulators suggest that the
Reagan administration's agen
da for deregulation will in
clude:
—Rewriting the Clean Air
Act. which expires next year, to
remove what are seen as ob
stacles to industrial activity,
making it easier to build new

factories or expand existing
plants, and to increase the
burning of coal.
—Curbing the Occupational
Safety and Health Adminis
tration. the Environmental
Protection Agency, and the Na
tional Highway Traffic Safety
Administration which are per
ceived by conservatives as
harassing business.
—Reviewing government
equal opportunity policies, es
pecially with respect to so
called reverse discrimination
in favor of women and minor
ities. "It is getting to the point
where it's difficult to get a job if
you're a white male," said Rep.
Thomas Evans (R-Del.), an im
portant adviser to Reagan and
his liaison officer with the
House of Representatives.
— Encouraging domestic
energy production through a big
increase in the amount of feder
al land available for oil and gas
exploration. In a companion
move, price controls on U.S.
crude oil will be allowed to ex
pire in September, completing
a process started by President
Jimmy Carter.
—Supporting legislation to

give Congress veto power over
individual rules and regulations
promulgated by federal agen
cies
Advantages
While Carter also labored to
reduce government regu
lations. Reagan has some ad
vantages over his predeces
sors.
Unlike Carter, he does not
have to worry about the Demo
cratic Party's traditional com
mitment to an active role for
government. Unlike Presidents
Kichard Nixon and Gerald
Ford. Reagan will have a more
compliant Congress, with Re
publicans controlling the Sen
ate and a cautious Democratic
majority in the House inclined
to cooperate with a con
servative administration
Reagan has another advan
tage — Carter's civil-service
reform. In return for the
chance to get higher pay and to
enjoy occasional bonuses,
many of the highest-ranking ca
reer officials joined the Senior
Executive Service, surrender
ing some of their job security.
They now can be transferred
to other jobs or sent to other
agencies. Reagan adminis
tration leaders will have un
precedented power to exile or
demote officials who do not
carry out White House policies.
Normally. Congress passes
the laws and lets the executive
branch carry them out with
minimal intervention. Bureau
crats write the rules implemen
ting the laws.
In rare cases. Congress has
found a rule to be so onerous
that only a legislative remedy
would suffice.
Angry at the Federal Trade
Commission, Congress last
year put into law a provision
giving itself the right to cancel
any individual FTC regulation.
Carter has taken the position
that a legislative veto over
agency and department rules
would endanger the separation
of powers among the branches
of government. Reagan may be
much more sympathetic to the
idea.
Early passage of a law giving
Congress such power could give
the Reagan administration a
powerful weapon against inde
pendent agencies still domi
nated by Democrats. The elec
tion gives the new president the
ability to name the chairmen of
those agencies, but he cannot

replace sitting commissioners
until their terms expire or they
leave for other reasons.
One of Reagan's earliest op
portunities will come at the In
terstate Commerce Com
mission. where he can fill six of
the 11 seats within a year.
Carter believed the Com- 1
mission's size was too un
wieldy. and he never filled
more than seven seats. At the
Federal Communications Com
mission, Reagan will choose
three of the seven members,
probably including a re
placement for activist Chair
man Charles Ferris, who is ex
pected to resign although his
term runs until 1984. ,
At some agencies, there will
be no immediate vacancies.
Michael Pertschuk, who heads
the Federal Trade Com
mission. and Susan King, who
chairs the Consumer Product
Safety Commission, will relin
quish their titles but remain as
commissioners. Reagan, there
fore, will be forced to choose a
new chairman from the two Re
publican commissioners al
ready serving at the agencies
rather than bringing in some
one from the outside who might
be a stronger advocate of his
point of view.
Consumer and environmen
tal groups have already in
dicated that they will be using
the courts more often in fight
ing their battles now that a less
sympathetic administration is
taking power.
One of the greatest changes
inside the regulatory agencies
will be the mass exodus of anti
establishment, public interest
lawyers and consumer activist
jtaff members. Since the 19605,
many of those people have
gravitated through organiza
tions like Ralph Nader's Center
for the Study of Responsive
Law into state legislatures and
more recently into federal poli
cy-making positions.
