# Busing concerns blacks
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles — President-elect Ronald Re
agan, faced with growing concern among
some black leaders about his views on school
busing and poverty programs, said Sunday
that blacks should be reassured by his record
as governor of California.
"I think my record indicates (a concern for
blacks)," Reagan said outside the Bel-Air
Presbyterian Church in Los Angeles. "And I
hope to do even better on the national level."
Reagan was asked about his plans for the
nation's blacks after two prominent black
leaders this weekend warned that a Reagan
administration presents troubling prospects
for minorities for the next four years.
Benjamin Hooks, executive secretary of the
National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said Saturday that there is a
"near hysteria" in the black communities of
this nation about what Reagan will do about
desegregation and poverty once he takes over
the Oval Office. Hooks appealed to Reagan to
go on national television in the next few weeks
to assure blacks of his concern for their wel
fare.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson, head of Operation
PUSH in Chicago, also warned that blacks
must begin making their fears and views
known to the president-elect before he is in
augurated Jan. 20.
Busing
The growing concern among blacks, over 80
percent of whom voted for Reagan's opponent.
President Jimmy Carter, in this month's elec
tion, was heightened last week when Reagan

said that he was against busing to desegregate
schools.
Reagan told reporters on Capitol Hill last
Tuesday that it he were president he would
sign an appropriations bill, now being con
sidered. that included an amendment against
busing.
At the time. Reagan said that: "Busing has
been a failure and is not accomplishing the
purpose, the worthwhile purpose, that gave it
birth. So therefore I think there are better
ways to achieve the end than by continuing
these programs."
California record
While Reagan did not elaborate Sunday on
his record concerning blacks while he was
governor, he has been criticized by some black
organizations for the number of black appoin
tees in his administration from 1968 to 1974.
Those critics note that there were no blacks in
his Cabinet, and no blacks appointed to the
state Supreme Court by Reagan. Only 3
percent of Reagan's judicial appointments
over the eight years also were black.
However. Reagan's defenders have said
that he appointed more blacks and Hispanics
in his administration than did his predecessor.
Gov. Edmund Brown
Reagan, who spent the weekend in Los An
geles winnowing down the names of potential
Cabinet members, expects to meet with top
aides Monday to continue the process of pick
ing 13 top administration officials.
Asked whether he would make any decisions
at Monday's meeting. Reagan said, "We're
going to do our best."
