# Compromise language averts filibuster
## Superfund established for chemical clean-up 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington— The Senate
passed a vastly scaled-back
"superfund" bill Monday to fi
nance the cleanup of abandoned
chemical dumps and toxic
chemical spills.
Passage was by voice vote af
ter the Senate, by a roll call vote
of 78-9, adopted compromise
language that marked a dra
matic resurrection for legisla
tion that its sponsors had re
garded as dead as recently as
last Thursday. But the final
product was a far cry from what
the sponsors originally sought.
Faced with a possible
112 ilibuster in the waning days of
the lame-duck session of Con
gress, backers of the bill agreed
to drop those provisions most
strongly opposed by the
chemical and oil industries.
As passed by the Senate, the
bill would create a $1.6-billion
special fund — financed mainly
through new taxes on various

chemicals — to pay for the
cleanup of toxic wastes that im
peril public health and the en
vironment. Sponsors had ori
ginally proposed a $4.2-billion
fund.
To overcome the filibuster
threat, the sponsors also
dropped provisions that would
have provided for the cleanup of
oil spills and for payment of
medical expenses to victims of
toxic contamination..
Committee
The Senate bill now goes to a
Senate-House conference com
mittee for attempts at reconcil
iation with two separate "su
perfund" bills passed by the
House in September. The House
measures would create funds to
taling $1.95 billion to clean up
both abandoned chemical
dumps and oil and chemical
spills and to provide compensa
tion to victims.
Although the 96th Congress is
scheduled to end a week from

Friday, sponsors of the Senate
bill expressed confidence that a
compromise could be reached
with the House in time to send
the final product to President
Jimmy Carter for his signature.
Although the administration
backed a more sweeping bill, it
endorsed the Senate com-

promise in the interests of get
ting something passed.
While hailing the bill as
"landmark legislation." Sen.
Jennings Randolph (D-W.Va.),
chairman of the Senate En
vironment and Public Works
Committee and chief sponsor of
the bill, said that more needed
to be done. He said that an at
tempt to strengthen the legisla
tion would be made next year.
In the meantime, Randolph

urged passage of the com
promise bill, declaring "wecan
not afford another Love Canal."
He referred to the dumping of
toxic chemical wastes in an
abandoned canal near Niagara
Falls. N.Y., an incident that
gave impetus to the superfund
legislation.

The filibuster threat had been
led by Sen. JoSse Helms, <R-
N.C.), one of several senators
who objected to the more far
reaching terms in the original
bill sponsored by Rando'lph and
Sen. Robert Stafford. (D-Vt).
Under the Senate bill, the
chemical industry would be tax
ed for a sum not to exceed $1.38
billion over a five-year period to
provide the bulk of the $1.6
billion in the superfund. The bal

ance would come from the fed
eral treasury.
The tax would be imposed on
various chemical products that
would range from $4.87 a ton on
such items as acetylene, butane
and ethylene to a low of 22 cents
a ton on potassium hydroxide.
Sen. George Mitchell (D-
Maine), who has sought to as
sume the environmental role
vacated by his predecessor, Ed
mund Muskie. now secretary of
state, called the bill "a mean
ingful first step."
But Mitchell said the bill was
deficient because it did not pro
vide for compensation of medi
cal expenses to victims.
Then, referring to a provision
that would require industry to
pay damages of not more than
$50 million to federal or state
governments for destruction or
loss of natural resources,
Mitchell said:
"This Senate has made the
judgment that property is more
significant than human beings."

bill sponsored by Rando'lph and

Under the Senate bill, the
chemical industry would be tax
ed for a sum not to exceed $1.38
billion over a five-year period to
provide the bulk of the $1.6
billion in the superfund. The bal

ance would come from the fed
eral treasury.
The tax would be imposed on
various chemical products that
would range from $4.87 a ton on
such items as acetylene, butane
and ethylene to a low of 22 cents
a ton on potassium hydroxide.

deficient because it did not pro

that would require industry to
pay damages of not more than
$50 million to federal or state
governments for destruction or

Washington— The Senate
passed a vastly scaled-back
"superfund" bill Monday to fi
nance the cleanup of abandoned
chemical dumps and toxic
chemical spills.
Passage was by voice vote af
ter the Senate, by a roll call vote
of 78-9, adopted compromise
language that marked a dra
matic resurrection for legisla
tion that its sponsors had re
garded as dead as recently as
last Thursday. But the final
product was a far cry from what
the sponsors originally sought.
Faced with a possible
112 ilibuster in the waning days of
the lame-duck session of Con
gress, backers of the bill agreed
to drop those provisions most
strongly opposed by the
chemical and oil industries.
As passed by the Senate, the
bill would create a $1.6-billion
special fund — financed mainly
through new taxes on various

chemicals — to pay for the
cleanup of toxic wastes that im
peril public health and the en
vironment. Sponsors had ori
ginally proposed a $4.2-billion
fund.
To overcome the filibuster
threat, the sponsors also
dropped provisions that would
have provided for the cleanup of
oil spills and for payment of
medical expenses to victims of
toxic contamination..
Committee
The Senate bill now goes to a
Senate-House conference com
mittee for attempts at reconcil
iation with two separate "su
perfund" bills passed by the
House in September. The House
measures would create funds to
taling $1.95 billion to clean up
both abandoned chemical
dumps and oil and chemical
spills and to provide compensa
tion to victims.
Although the 96th Congress is
scheduled to end a week from

Friday, sponsors of the Senate
bill expressed confidence that a
compromise could be reached
with the House in time to send
the final product to President
Jimmy Carter for his signature.
Although the administration
backed a more sweeping bill, it
endorsed the Senate com-

While hailing the bill as
"landmark legislation." Sen.
Jennings Randolph (D-W.Va.),
chairman of the Senate En
vironment and Public Works
Committee and chief sponsor of
the bill, said that more needed
to be done. He said that an at
tempt to strengthen the legisla
tion would be made next year.
In the meantime, Randolph

urged passage of the com
promise bill, declaring "wecan
not afford another Love Canal."
He referred to the dumping of
toxic chemical wastes in an
abandoned canal near Niagara
Falls. N.Y., an incident that
gave impetus to the superfund
legislation.
