# ASSU Senate meeting draws small attendance
## 
### Peter Finch 
Few senators turned out for last
night's pre-Thanksgiving ASSU Sen
ate meeting, the agenda filled mostly
with finish-up type business.
ASSU Financial Manager Steve
Davis announced that the new Coffee
House is doing well.
. "We're speeding up service and
trying to maintain a low mark-up on
everything we sell," he said. "We
make, in essence, no money. We're es
sentially just a service to students."
Council of Presidents member Dick
Butterfield also noted that all students
here are "shareholders" in the Coffee
House and as such should refrain from
stealing objects from the premises.
"We've already lost $900 in cups so
far," he said. "If people started to feel
like this was ours,' maybe they
wouldn't walk out with stuff."
Andre Mann, speaking on behalf of
the absent Gary Reiff, reported to the
Senate on the results of the Finance
Committee's last meeting. At that

meeting, he said, it was designated
that the ASSU Academic Organiza
tions Board (AOB) was experiencing
some difficulties that should be in
vestigated.
Instead of working as an advising
body for University academic or
ganizations, Mann said, it seems to be
serving only as a "monetary-dispens
ing organization," actually meeting
with campus groups only when they
need funds
Senator Dave Phelps was selected
by the Finance Committee to look into
how the AOB might better serve its
members.
In other Finance Committee busi
ness, the Armenian Cultural Associa
tion received $40 from the Program
Fee Discretionary Fund for what was
termed "a very successful presenta
tion on Armenian culture."
Under new business, several mem
bers of the Task Force On Contem
porary Entertainment gave the Sen
ate a brief overview of what they have

been doing this quarter.
Again, their three goals —providing
entertainment at Stanford, remaining
in sound financial condition and
"educating students and providing
student employment" — were re
iterated.
"We've handed out the surveys and
we've been conducting interviews
with promoters, past Special Events
and Financial Managers and any or
ganization that's worked with Special
Events in the past," said Alec Peters,
Task Force member.
Last Friday, Peters continued, the
Task Force met with various mem
bers of the University administration
that could give them some new ideas.
"It was a good meeting." he said.
"We presented them with some find
ings we have so far and they were very
helpful. They're not against us. We re
alized that we have to stop trying to
fight these people. They're there to
help us."
Next week the Task Force will

make its final recommendations to the
Senate Finance Committee.
Speaking as a special guest to last
night's meeting was Ellie Oppenheim,
the Director of Tresidder Union. She
gave a 45-minute speech on the history
of Tresidder, touching somewhat on
the problems that confront the union
today.
The biggest problems for Tresidder,
Oppenheim said, include its yearly fi
nancial losses, its difficulty recruiting
student help and its trouble finding
enough space to house student ac
tivities.
According to Oppenheim. the Union
will be greatly improved by cleaning
up the appearance of the building
itself.
"The place needs to look better,"
she said. "Not just from a cleanliness
standpoint, but it needs fresh paint
and tasteful furniture. We're making
up now for years of deferred main
tenance."'
