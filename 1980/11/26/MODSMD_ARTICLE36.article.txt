# Cagers open Saturday against Air Force
## Cards must make transitions in '80-'81 SPORTS 
### Chris Haft 
Basketball success rests
neither with offense nor with de
fense. but with switching quick
ly and efficiently from one to the
other. Coaches call this the
"transition" phase. "You've
got to make the transitions from
offense to defense, and vice-ver
sa," they tell players, re
porters. and anyone else within
Besides these kinds of transi
tions, Stanford's men's basket
ball team faces an even greater
adjustment The Cardinals, who
open their 1980-81 season Satur
day in Maples Pavilion against
Air Force, must make the tran
sition from playing with a stand
out performer to playing
without one.

Kimberly Belton. whose 18 7
points and 9 8 rebounds a game
last year prevented Stanford
from finishing 11th in the Pacif
ic-10 Conference, was only the
most recent Card around whom
the team usually revolved
Two seasons ago it was Wolfe
Perry. Before that the names
were Mike Bratz, Rich Kelley
and Claude Terry. Stanford has
nearly always had one player
the opposition had to stop This
year that player no longer ex
ists. which might suggest that
last season's dismal 7-19 show
ing will be repeated
That, however, won't happen
First of all. it will be impossible
for the Cards to lose 19 of 26
games, because this season they
play 27. Second, head coach

Dick Dißiaso hopes that the
trend the Cards set last Febru
ary. when they won three games
in a row at one point, will con
tinue. with Belton's departure
offset by the improvement of
the veterans and the contribu
tions of four freshmen
"We feel that we became a
better team last February,"
Dißiaso said, it's logical to say
that Belton had a great Febru
ary. but we were telling our
players to throw him the ball in
January." meaning that the
Cards began to perform the
basics — passing, rebounding,
defending — better.
Stanford will have to continue
its proficiency with the fun
damentals. for it won t win
many games on raw talent.
Dißiaso's opening-game lineup
features three forwards, and un
less 6-foot-10 center David
Nussbaum improves enough
against pre-season competition
to earn a starting job, the Cards
will face a size disadvantage in
most of their Pac-10 games.
Dißiaso said that against
their first three foes — Air
Force, Wyoming and Marquette
— the Cards won't confront seri
ous height problems. But the
coach still wishes Nussbaum
could permanently become
Stanford's pivot man. "You
have to have a big, good, strong
center in this league to be suc
cessful," Dißiaso stated.
For now, however, Stanford's
front line includes 6-foot-7 Brian
Welch. 6-foot-8 Orlando Ward
and 6-foot-7 John Revelli.
Welch averaged 14.5 points a
game last year, the highest fig
ure for any sophomore in the
Pac-10. The co-captain's ac
curate. picturesque outside shot

remains his strongest court as
set.
Brian is one of the best pure
shooters in the conference, if
not in the country. said
Dißiaso. who experimented
with Welch as a guard at the be
ginning of last season After a
revealing six-game trial,
Dißiaso moved Welch back to
the front line. "Welch is now
forever a forward," the coach
said with a tinge of embarrass
ment recently.
Ward, a junior like Welch, av
eraged 8.2 points and 5 9 re
bounds a game last season, but
must conquer the streaks of er
ratic play that have character
ized his game the past two sea
sons.
He is a good shooter,"
Dißiaso said in defense of Ward.
"He just has a tendency to shoot
different ways each time he
shoots the bail."
Admittedly. Ward has been
hampered by having to play cen
ter occasionally. We hope we
don t have to move him back to
the middle," Dißiaso said.
Revelli, Stanford's top
freshman recruit, ought to
strengthen the Cards' rebound
ing efforts. The Scarsdale,
N.Y., native made Basketball
Weekly s All-State team and ap
peared on Basketball Times'
list of the nation's top 70 high
school prospects while averag
ing 26.7 points and 14.0 rebounds
a game for Scarsdale High.
Stanford can count on lots of
hustle from its starting guards.
Doug Marty and Terry Smith,
with the 6-foot-2 Marty acting as
the team's primary ballhandler.
Marty was prematurely
thrown into the point guard's
role after the filth game of last

season, when Darvle Morgan
fractured a bone in his toot I n
able to handle the position s
pressures and responsibilities
initially. Marty suffered fre
quent humiliation at opponents'
hands, causing the Cards tor
tunes to suffer in turn
"When he (Marty) inhaled,
they exhaled, said Dißiaso
They were right inside his
jock."
By the end of the season, how
ever. Marty was functioning
comfortably and competently in
the backcourt. He will continue
to direct Stanford's offense this
year
Smith, meanwhile, provides
the Cards with size (b-foot-4 >
and quickness from the guard
spot. He scored the winning
basket in Stanford's home open
er last year, a 54-52 triumph
over Wyoming, and notched 13
essential points in a big 75-74
victory at California.
Two freshmen will back up
Marty and Smith: 6-foot-2 Keith
.Jones, the Arizona State Player
of the Year last season, and ti
foot-5 Roger Lemons, a second
team All-CIF selection from
Anaheim.
"All four can handle the ball
reasonably well." Dißiaso said.
Hans Wicharv. a ti-foot-9
freshman from San Diego, will
be Stanford's first forward off
the bench
Three of the other reserves,
seniors Steve Crandell (the
team's co-captain along with
Welch), Peter Lallas and Jeff
Ryan, all have three years of
varsity experience.
Experienced or not. all the
Cards will have to make the
transitions — big and little — to
escape last year's fate.
