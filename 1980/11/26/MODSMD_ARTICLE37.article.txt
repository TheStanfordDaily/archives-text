Much to the delight of many college basketball fans, the UCLA
dynasty crumbled last season. But that was only temporary — it
was reconstructed during the NCAA playoffs in March, and the
future looks bright.
UCLA, playing under first-year Coach Larry Brown, dropped out
of the nation's top 20 teams last season for an extended length of
time, the first time that's happened since 1966.
The freshman-laden Bruins got off to a slow start and eventually
finished fourth in the Pacific-10 Conference, the first non-cham
pionship UCLA team in 13 seasons.
But UCLA was extended an at-large berth in the NCAA playoffs,
and made the most of it, advancing to the finals before losing a
heart-breaker to Louisville.
Returning for the Bruins, who wound up 22-10, are last year's four
freshmen — guards Rod Foster and Michael Holton, swing man
Darren Dave and forward Cliff Pruitt.
Junior forward Mike Sanders, a key to UCLA's late surge, is also
back, and two prep Ail-Americans have been added — forward Ken
ny Fields and guard Ralph Jackson. Fields scored 33 points in a re
cent intra-squad game.
The Bruins, ranked sixth in the Associated Press preseason poll,
will probably find that getting their league championship back
won't be easy. Oregon State won the title a year ago and the
Beavers, rated seventh, look formidable again.
The Beavers finished 1979-80 with a 26-4 record and their big guns
—■ center Steve Johnson, guards Ray Blume and Mark Radford and
forwards Rob Holbrook and Jeff Stoutt, all return.
A legitimate challenger to both the Bruins and Beavers figures to
be Arizona State, which was 22-7 and second in the Pac-10 last win
ter. Alton Lister, a 7-footer. returns, as do forwards Sam Williams
and Johnny Nash and guards Byron Scott and Lafayette Lever.
Washington was 18-10 a year ago. but doesn't seem as strong this
season The Huskies' top player is guard Bob Fronk. They seem to
lack sufficient size to compete for the league title and will start
three forwards with no player designated as a center.
Arizona fell to 12-15 after seven straight winning seasons under
Coach Fred Snowden. How much it improves probably depends on
whether 6-11 sophomore David Mosebar. 6-10 sophomore Frank
Smith and 6-7 senior Ron Davis can rebound with the opposition.
Washington State was 22-6 in 1979-80, but Coach George Raveling
is starting from scratch. All five Cougar starters graduated.
Southern Cal. 12-15, might improve if 6-10 freshman Clayton
Olivier can help immediately and last year's leading scorer and re
bounder. Purvis Miller, is recovered from a knee injury.
Oregon and California were also-rans a year ago and that proba
bly won't change.
