						shocker: Duran quits, gives Leonard title
## 
### 
New Orleans (AP) â€” Sugar
Ray Leonard regained the
World Boxing Council wel
terweight championship in
shocking fashion last night when
Roberto Duran quit in the eighth
round in what he later said was
his last fight.
"I will never fight again. 1 am
retiring from boxing now," said
Duran, who suffered only his
second loss in a brilliant career.
But the loss was surprising
beyond imagination.
Duran was very much in the

tight when suddenly late in the
eighth round he turned his body
and walked away. The referee
tried to motion the fighters back
into action, obviously not believ
ing what he was seeing.
But Duran shook his head and
said: "No." It was all over.
Duran later said he had
cramps in his stomach and right
arm.
"1 got so weak I couldn't go
on," he said. "Leonard was
weak but I didn't have the
strength to pressure him."

WBC officials announced they
would hold a meeting as soon as
the night's card was completed
but they would not reveal the
subject.
A source said the meeting
was to officially announce the
great fighter's retirement.
The fight ended at 2:44 of the
eighth round. It was a strange
ending to what was Durans sec
ond loss in a brilliant career that
had seen him win 72 times and
intimidate opponents to the
point that he had become one of

boxing's most feared fighters.
Duran had won the title from
Leonard on a unanimous de
cision last June 20 in Montreal
by bullying Leonard into the
ropes and working him over. He
tried to do it again in the Super
dome but his tactics did not
work as Leonard used his hand
and foot speed to great advan
tage.
Two judges had Leonard
ahead HH-66 after seven rounds
and another had Leonard ahead
68-67.

Leonard, at 24 tive years
younger than Duran. camc out
circling and moving in and out.
It became obvious he came to
use the whole ring, unlike he did
in Montreal. At the end of the
first round. Leonard landed a
solid 1-2 to Imuran's head.
In the second round. Leonard,
who weighed 146. the same as
Duran. landed three good rights
to the head and two stiff jabs at
the bell while effectively tying
up Duran inside.
Then, in the third round.
Duran began to come on a bit
bullying Leonard into the ropes
and looking like a man who had
no thought about losing. There
certainly was no thought in any
one's mind that instead of run
ning his championship fight re
cord to 14-0. Duran would leave
the ring, his career in jeopardy,
with boos ringing in his ears.
Roberto Duran. the man who
made so many opponents qui
left the ring a quitter
In that third round. Duran.
who held the lightweight cham
pionship for most of the UfiOs,
landed some good body shots
and he continued his bullying,
body-punching tactics in the
fourth round. At one point,
Duran fell as he pusher! Leonard.
In the seventh. Leonard went
into his mugging, dancing rou
tine. Before the fight. Duran
had said Leonard was a clown
and he didn t like clowns in box
ing. He said Leonard tried to im
itate Ali and ' Imitators are
losers.''
Sugar Hay Leonard wasn't a
loser this night, although it took
several seconds for it to dawn on
him that he was a winner In
fact, he hit Duran with a right to
the stomach when Duran turned
his body after signaling he was
through.
