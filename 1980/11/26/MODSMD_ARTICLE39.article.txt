## 
### Robert Stone 
A span of five minutes possibly spelled
the difference between victory and defeat in
the women's basketball team's 78-67 loss to
nationally ranked UCLA Monday night at
Maples Pavilion.
The lapse occurred about eight minutes
into the second half with the Bruins ahead
52-51. Until that time both teams traded
field goals evenly and neither squad domi
nated the floor, although Stanford held an
edge in ball control in the first half.
At that point, however, the Bruins opened
up behind the scoring of center Necie
Thompson and All-America forward Denise
Curry as Stanford momentarily lost its
poise. Instead of answering the UCLA
scores. Stanford's shots fell short or
bounced off the rim The Cardinals were
able to get on track again, but UCLA held on
to the deciding margin.
Even in defeat, the emotional Cardinals
played a scrappy game and held the upper
hand for most of the first half, impressing
both coaches.
"For about four minutes we stopped
being aggressive," said Stanford head
coach Dotty McCrea. explaining the loss.
However, she added. "But we controlled the
outside. They're (UCLA) a tough bunch We
played very, very well."
UCLA's head coach, Billie Moore,

agreed "Stanford played very well. They
showed great patience pn offense and did a
good job with their 1-3-1 (defense). In the
second half we opened up the game a little
more and played the way we wanted to. In
the last three or four years it was the best
game I ve seen Stanford play. They are very
much a contender." she said.
The first half saw a hustling Stanford con
trol the ball and the offensive boards more
than UCLA. Cardinal point guard Debi Gore
led the game with five assists as she suc
cessfully worked the ball inside the UCLA
defense to center Louise Smith and forward
Kim Kupferer. Besides providing scoring,
the tandem also snagged 15 rebounds.
The Cards were also able to draw fouls as
they threaded the Bruin defense. Kuplerer
attracted fouls early in the game while re
bounding and sank three of four free throws
to help Stanford take a 16-12 lead. Gore
added two more points on a fast-break lavup
to give the team a six-point advantage, the
largest it would possess.
Curry, however, came alive and led the
Bruins out of their slump. With the inside
closed to her for the majority of the half
Curry got her team rolling with a couple of
15-18 footers. When UCLA did get inside
Stanford's 1-3-1 it was Curry and Thompson
who were powering their way in. Point
guard Mary Hegarty also did her share of

outside work by connecting on several shots
from the top of the key.
The first half ended with UCLA ahead
36-35 after the lead changed hands three
times.
Stanford began the second half in control
again. Smith and Kupferer helped the Cards
to a quick 41-40 lead before Hegartv scored
on a fast break to put the Bruins up by one.
The teams continued to trade baskets until
Stanford's lapse, although the Bruins held
on to the lead for the rest of the game. Ex
plaining the breakdown. Kupferer said,
"They were scoring and we lost our intensi
ty for a few minutes."
The ti-1 sophomore also pointed out that
the offense made great strides since last
weekend's Cal Poly Tournament. "The first
half was almost flawless—we executed our
offense very well. It was a big improvement
from San Luis Obispo," Kupferer said.
Curry demonstrated why she's an Olym
pian by sinking 13 of 15 field goal attempts
and scoring a game-high 28 points altogeth
er. Kupferer led Stanford with 23 points and
nine rebounds, while Smith added 18 points
and Gore scored 17. Gore's total included
seven free throws in nine attempts.
The game dropped Stanford's record to
3-1 while UCLA improved its mark to 4-0.

showed great patience pn offense and did a
good job with their 1-3-1 (defense). In the

the last three or four years it was the best
game I ve seen Stanford play. They are very
much a contender." she said.
