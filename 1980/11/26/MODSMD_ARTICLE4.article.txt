whipped wildfires raced across the
face of Southern California yesterday,
wreaking havoc on homes and wild
lands and for the first time claiming
lives.
Two elderly persons were burned to
death and two other persons apparent
ly died of heart attacks brought on by
the strain of the so-called Panorama
fire in and around the city of San
Bernardino, about 90 miles east of Los
Angeles.
At least 320 homes and other struc
tures were reported destroyed or
damaged by noon Tuesday.
About 40.000 acres of forest and
brushlands were either ablaze or
blackened by earlier firestorms.
Thousands of people who fled the vari
ous fires were being put up in evac
uation centers.
Fire officials said a total of 173
crews, each of about 20 men. were bat
tling the various fires. Three hundred
engine companies, 29 fixed wing air
craft and nine helicopters were work
ing the fires.
Total manpower was estimated at
about 4 000 from throughout Califor

nia and the Western United States.
Dave Hillman. spokesman for the
joint federal-state Operations Coordi
nation Center in Riverside, denied re
ports of manpower shortages He said
the Southern California fires are the
only ones going in the West and crews
are readily available He said 95
percent of firefighters who were on
vacation for Thanksgiving have been
located and thrown into the battle
Howling Santa Ana winds, con
siderably reduced from Monday's
peak velocities of up to 90 mph, were
still scattering embers, pushing fire
fronts, hampering firefighters on the
ground and in the air By noon, winds
were blowing at 30 to 50 mph, general
ly out of the northeast, gusting up to 60
mph in some places.
The first fatalities of the current
fire siege were all from an area of San
Bernardino that was swept by the Pan
orama fire, the most destructive of all
the blazes.
The victims were identified as Earl
Welty, 83. and his wife Edith. 82;
Joseph Benjamin. 54, and Rosa Myers.
Assistant Coroner Leo Reyes said
the badly burned bodies of the W'eltys
were found in front of their home

a shed. The old man was holding a
dead puppy in his arms.
