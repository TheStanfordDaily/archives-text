# Favored poloists head for NCAAs

As Stanford's football
team found out Saturday
against California, being
heavily favored going into a
contest does not insure vic
tory. Emotional letdowns,
untimely errors, injuries and
bad breaks can change even
the most sure win into a dev
astating defeat.
Stanford's water polo
team is out to combat these
self-defeating elements

when they travel to Long
Beach this weekend for the
1980 NCAA Championships
The Cards, seeded No. 1 in
the tournament, open Satur
day morning against eighth
seeded Loyola of Chicago If
Stanford wins, it will play in
the semi-finals that night
against the winner of the
IJSC-Pepperdine game The
finals are slated for Sunday
evening
Card coach Dante Det

tamanti feels confident that
his team will bring home the
championship they won in
1978 but lost last year, when
they finished third
"It's hard to make a pre
diction. but we're going in
with the attitude that we're
going to win it," Dettamanti
said. "If we play our best and
the rest of the teams play
their best, then we should
take it."
The Cards have relied on

their fast-break offense to
bring them success all year,
and Dettamanti does not see
any reason to change
strategies now
We're just going to play
good, basic, fundamental
water polo and do the things
that we do well." he said.
"We're going to play our
game. We'll rely on the fast
break to get it going for us
and make other people try
and stop us."
As their 25-2-1 regular-sea
son record indicates, the
Cards have not been stopped
very often this year. One of
their losses was to UC-Irvine
at the beginning of the season
after less than one week of
practice. The other, how
ever. came last Saturday at
Cal. 9-7.
But Dettamanti said that
going into the tourney off of a
loss will have no ill effect.
"1 think it's made them
want to win even more. They
want to prove that they are
the best." the coach said
In fact. Dettamanti could
regard losing to Cal as a good
omen. In 1978, under similar
circumstances, Stanford lost
to the Bears and went on to
take the NCAA title.
For history to repeat
itself, Dettamanti said, "We
just have to play the way
we're capable of. I'm sure
we will. We're really
psyched."
