North By Northwest ****
Saturday. Palo Alto Cultural
Center Theater
This superb Hitchcock thriller
tinds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual —
the working title was not North By
Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln 's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi
nessman forced into flight after he
is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties. plays a woman (whose
loyalties are dubious at best) who
finds her life thrown into the same
alphabet soup (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehman's
dialogue is polished and witty, and
Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.
Starts tomorrow night.
— Jim Mattson
The 39 Steps
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
train; she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat's too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moores, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buehan novel.
Starts tomorrow.

Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master~
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

The Empire Strikes Hack **
Old Mill. Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor Every
thing has become deadly serious
bigger. brighter, splashier, and
dull
All the old performers are back,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned muppet
creature that, lor an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of inagic and
expectation. The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending—
jeepers. George, couldn't you
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work ?

2001: A Space Odyssey ★ ★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show tonight and tomor
row night.

Walter Matthau plays Miles
1 Kendig. a CIA agent relegated to a
desk job. Matthau, with his lanky
teddy-bear looks and that cautious
mincing walk, is a peculiar choice
for the role of a secret agent, but
he can get away with it because we
know how clever (and sexy) he re

Englishman, is a cold fish, but he

The Great Santini **
Aquarius. Palo Alto
An interesting, often wonderful
movie run aground by an ending
that renders pointless everything
that's come before. Robert Duvall
plays a Marine colonel who ac
cuses his wife of mollycoddling his
sons. He abuses his family in what
he thinks is their best interests,
and risks alienating them all in the
process. So much, so g00d... but
then those lousy last five minutes
go and screw everything up. You
might want to consider going out
tor another tub of popcorn when it
becomes apparent that the mov
ie's drawing to a close.

Jill Clayburgh plavs Kate Gun

Bergstein s screenplay — her first

beings who speak the best dialogue
heard in an American movie since
Breaking Away. The acting of the
three principals is excellent, but
Claudia Weill, the director, is so
unimaginative that she practically
sabotages the movie

The Elephant Man ***★
Park, Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick.
"The Elephant Man " Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battling our fear of the
unknown.
— Tom Taylor
Bye Bye Brazil
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing' so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mfre of poverty and lost dreams
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town m the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cyncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from

them The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
survive. Director Diegues does a
fine job ol highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

Stardust Memories ★***
Palo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors.: the structure is as loose as
Bananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline. Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantit
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan. Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline
Double-billed with Honey -

Nelson.

2001: A Space Odyssey ★ ★★★
Old Mill, Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea, Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show tonight and tomor
row night.

Director David Lynch does a

"The Elephant Man " Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de

John Hurt is absolutely believable

convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and

Bye Bye Brazil
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing' so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mfre of poverty and lost dreams
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town m the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cyncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from

them The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
survive. Director Diegues does a
fine job ol highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

Stardust Memories ★***

In this reexamination of his own

everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re

The mood is as disturbing as In

before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline. Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantit

After the premiere of Manhat

North By Northwest ****
Saturday. Palo Alto Cultural
Center Theater
This superb Hitchcock thriller
tinds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual —
the working title was not North By
Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln 's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi
nessman forced into flight after he
is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties. plays a woman (whose
loyalties are dubious at best) who
finds her life thrown into the same
alphabet soup (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehman's
dialogue is polished and witty, and
Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.
Starts tomorrow night.

The 39 Steps
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
train; she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat's too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moores, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buehan novel.
Starts tomorrow.

Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master~
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its

Bye Bye Brazil
Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing' so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mfre of poverty and lost dreams
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town m the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cyncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from

them The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
survive. Director Diegues does a
fine job ol highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

Stardust Memories ★***
Palo Alto Square
In this reexamination of his own
career. Woody Allen reassesses
everything he's done before.
Stardust Memories marks a re
turn to zero in order to begin anew.
The mood is as disturbing as In
teriors.: the structure is as loose as
Bananas. The final result is dif
ferent from anything Allen's done
before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline. Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantit
interludes.
After the premiere of Manhat
tan. Allen maintained that his next
film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
Memories is a drama without a
storyline
Double-billed with Honey -

Nelson.

North By Northwest ****
Saturday. Palo Alto Cultural
Center Theater
This superb Hitchcock thriller
tinds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual —
the working title was not North By
Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln 's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi
nessman forced into flight after he
is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties. plays a woman (whose
loyalties are dubious at best) who
finds her life thrown into the same
alphabet soup (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehman's
dialogue is polished and witty, and
Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.
Starts tomorrow night.

The 39 Steps
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
train; she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat's too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moores, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buehan novel.
Starts tomorrow.

Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master~
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its

North By Northwest ****
Saturday. Palo Alto Cultural
Center Theater
This superb Hitchcock thriller
tinds the master's tongue even
more firmly in cheek than usual —
the working title was not North By
Northwest but The Man in Lin
coln 's Nose.
Cary Grant plays a busi
nessman forced into flight after he
is mistaken for a spy and a
murderer Eva Marie Saint,
among the best of Hitchcock's ice
beauties. plays a woman (whose
loyalties are dubious at best) who
finds her life thrown into the same
alphabet soup (the CIA, the
FBI . . . ) as Grant's.
Everything gels — the per
formances are smooth,
scriptwriter Ernest Lehman's
dialogue is polished and witty, and
Bernard Herrmann's score is
brilliantly flamboyant.
Starts tomorrow night.
— Jim Mattson
The 39 Steps
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
One of the later films, and per
haps the greatest, that Alfred
Hitchcock made before leaving
Britain for the United States. This
is a masterpiece of the under
stated. high-spirited blend of hu
mor and suspense that Hitchcock
was so gifted at creating. Robert
Donat stars as a man who inad
vertently becomes involved with a
group of spies; he must flee over
what seems to be nearly all of
Great Britain before he manages
to prove his innocence. Madeleine
Carroll is a woman he picks up on a
train; she thinks he's a murderer,
and Donat's too busy to convince
her otherwise. It's only after the
two are handcuffed together, and
left to wander about the Scottish
moores, that she realizes he might
not be so villainous after all.
Based, very loosely, on the John
Buehan novel.
Starts tomorrow.

Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master~
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother. But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul—its
guts.

Old Mill, Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick's rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward. What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak. His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets. Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind

John Hurt is absolutely believable

Aquarius, Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing' so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mfre of poverty and lost dreams
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town m the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cyncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from

them The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to

In this reexamination of his own

The mood is as disturbing as In

before: freed from the confines of
a strict storyline. Allen runs wild
through half-forgotten fantasies
and half-remembered romantit

After the premiere of Manhat

film would be a comedy without
jokes. There are jokes in Stardust
Memories—some great ones—but
Allen's prediction captures the
feel of his latest film. Stardust
