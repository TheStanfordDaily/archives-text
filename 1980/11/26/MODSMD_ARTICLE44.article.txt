A. Sabella's
Corner of Taylor and Jef

Fisherman's Wharf
San Francisco
771-6775
If there is such a thing as
pedigree among restaurants,
then A. Sabella's on Fish
erman's Wharf in San Francisco
has got to belong to one of the
finest lineages. This estab
lishment now boasts the success
of .four generations of ex
perience in the restaurant busi
ness, and can boast with good
reason.
Its history goes back to before

the turn of the century when Lu
ciano Sabella emigrated to San
Francisco and became a fish
erman. In 1920 his son An tone
opened the restaurant now
known as Sabella-La Torre. Lat
er, in 1939, the family expanded
the business to a still larger es
tablishment on the corner of
Taylor and Jefferson and called
it A. Sabella's.
A five-alarm fire destroyed
this business in 1964, but Lucien
(Antone's son, who has been in
charge since 1950) and his fami
ly were determined to rebuild it.
In 1967, the $1.5 million, three
story building re-opened for
business.
The building is fashioned af
ter the Mediterranean style,
with arched windows for the
third floor dining room. The din
ing room overlooks the bay and
much of the surrounding wharf.
The interior is very elegant but
not stilted; plush but not gaudy.
Every table has a view, and is
set with linen, silver, china and
a lamp that sheds a soft, cozy
light.
Waiters wore formal attire
and their manner was attentive

and efficient Their professional
standards were very apparent.
They were amiable and accom
modating hosts — not stuffy or
self-impressed, and not even
above harmonizing a round of
"Happy Birthday" for one of the
patrons.
My guest and I began our
meal with the crab louie salad.
We ordered one salad for the
two of us, as the salad is quite a
meal in itself for just one per
son. There was more crab in this
heavenly salad than I have seen
in any two salads anywhere
else. What made it even better
was that they did not overdo the
dressing on the salad.

Our waiter kept our bread
basket full of the customary
sourdough bread. We chose
Johannisberg Riesling-In
glenook wine. It was a good
choice; dry enough to be a com
plement to a succulent meal,
but as my friend commented,
"not so dry that it makes you
pOcker."
As a creature of habit, I or
dered scallops, choosing the
bordelaise dish. These were tru
ly the best scallops I have ever
tasted. They were sauteed in
dry white wine and butter,
carefully seasoned and served
in the broth. Each bite was ex
quisite, and the serving was
generous — I was delighted.
My friend ordered abalone,
which is also prepared several
different ways. Our waiter rec
ommended a combination that
proved to be a good one: a light
egg batter over the abalone,
basted and cooked delicately
with a light garlic butter.
The wine list was quite com
plete without offering too many
choices. The specialty dinners
on the menu came with the
chef's suggestion from the wine

list. This pleasantly personal
touch was very helpful.
All seafood is served fresh at
A. Sabella's when in season. The
menu always offers at least five
fresh choices of entrees when
possible. Steak, veal and pasta
are offered, but it is primarily a
highly specialized seafood
menu.
If the crab louie sets the pre
cedent for the other seafood
salad selections, they are all
magnificent. Each salad is a
meal in itself, with generous
amounts of whatever shellfish
or condiment it boasts. They av
erage $8 a plate. A la carte din
ner salads are available for less,
and seafood cocktails and ap
petizers average $3.50.
Grilled and broiled specials
are offered for those with
simpler tastes. Choices include
trout, salmon, frog legs and sea
bass, to name a few, and range
in price from $6.50 to $9.50.
A. Sabella's has an extensive
offering of all shellfish dinners,
prepared any way you desire.
Clams and scallops will run
$8-8.50; crab, shrimp and
prawns are a little more,
averaging $9.75 a plate. Lobster
and abalone are comparably
higher.
Specialty dinners, which have
all been created by some mem
ber of the talented Sabella en
tourage, range widely in price
and selection. All are complete
dinners which you can enjoy for
as little as $6 for the Calimari
Siciliano (sauteed squid with
mushrooms, tomato and gar
lic ), or as much as $15.50 for the
Shrimp Siciliano. This specialty
is definitely the one if you are up
for "the works:" Italian green
salad, jumbo shrimp sautee,
Italian vegetables, ravioli,
cheese and fruit. Inglenook wine
is included with this as well.
As one who is always in the
mood for seafood, but not neces
sarily in the mood for the same
type of seafood, I find A.
Sabella's to be first rate in the
versatility of its menu. Any
shellfish can be found prepared
at least three different ways,

and most other entrees with at
least two. This is a gratefully
praised switch from many res
taurants which serve only one or
two preparations of the dif
ferent shellfish and seafoods,
and offer much less selection.
Our Thursday evening out at
A. Sabella's was wonderful. The
restaurant was well-occupied
even at 8:30, but not packed. We
were warned that weekend tour
ist crowds make a little bit of
difference in the atmosphere.
Regardless, it is a highly recom
mended experience. The
simplest to the most sophisti
cated palate will be happily sat
isfied at A. Sabella's, and all the
aesthetic pleasures of fine din
ing will be found there as well.

lishment now boasts the success
of .four generations of ex
perience in the restaurant busi
ness, and can boast with good
reason.
Its history goes back to before

the turn of the century when Lu
ciano Sabella emigrated to San
Francisco and became a fish
erman. In 1920 his son An tone
opened the restaurant now
known as Sabella-La Torre. Lat
er, in 1939, the family expanded
the business to a still larger es
tablishment on the corner of
Taylor and Jefferson and called
it A. Sabella's.
A five-alarm fire destroyed
this business in 1964, but Lucien
(Antone's son, who has been in
charge since 1950) and his fami
ly were determined to rebuild it.
In 1967, the $1.5 million, three
story building re-opened for
business.
The building is fashioned af
ter the Mediterranean style,
with arched windows for the
third floor dining room. The din
ing room overlooks the bay and
much of the surrounding wharf.
The interior is very elegant but
not stilted; plush but not gaudy.
Every table has a view, and is
set with linen, silver, china and
a lamp that sheds a soft, cozy
light.
Waiters wore formal attire
and their manner was attentive

and efficient Their professional
standards were very apparent.
They were amiable and accom
modating hosts — not stuffy or
self-impressed, and not even
above harmonizing a round of
"Happy Birthday" for one of the
patrons.
My guest and I began our
meal with the crab louie salad.
We ordered one salad for the
two of us, as the salad is quite a
meal in itself for just one per
son. There was more crab in this
heavenly salad than I have seen
in any two salads anywhere
else. What made it even better
was that they did not overdo the
dressing on the salad.

Our waiter kept our bread
basket full of the customary
sourdough bread. We chose
Johannisberg Riesling-In
glenook wine. It was a good
choice; dry enough to be a com
plement to a succulent meal,
but as my friend commented,
"not so dry that it makes you
pOcker."
As a creature of habit, I or
dered scallops, choosing the
bordelaise dish. These were tru
ly the best scallops I have ever
tasted. They were sauteed in
dry white wine and butter,
carefully seasoned and served
in the broth. Each bite was ex
quisite, and the serving was
generous — I was delighted.
My friend ordered abalone,
which is also prepared several
different ways. Our waiter rec
ommended a combination that
proved to be a good one: a light
egg batter over the abalone,
basted and cooked delicately
with a light garlic butter.
The wine list was quite com
plete without offering too many
choices. The specialty dinners
on the menu came with the
chef's suggestion from the wine

list. This pleasantly personal
touch was very helpful.
All seafood is served fresh at
A. Sabella's when in season. The
menu always offers at least five
fresh choices of entrees when
possible. Steak, veal and pasta
are offered, but it is primarily a
highly specialized seafood
menu.
If the crab louie sets the pre
cedent for the other seafood
salad selections, they are all
magnificent. Each salad is a
meal in itself, with generous
amounts of whatever shellfish
or condiment it boasts. They av
erage $8 a plate. A la carte din
ner salads are available for less,
and seafood cocktails and ap
petizers average $3.50.
Grilled and broiled specials
are offered for those with
simpler tastes. Choices include
trout, salmon, frog legs and sea
bass, to name a few, and range
in price from $6.50 to $9.50.
A. Sabella's has an extensive
offering of all shellfish dinners,
prepared any way you desire.
Clams and scallops will run
$8-8.50; crab, shrimp and
prawns are a little more,
averaging $9.75 a plate. Lobster
and abalone are comparably
higher.
Specialty dinners, which have
all been created by some mem
ber of the talented Sabella en
tourage, range widely in price
and selection. All are complete
dinners which you can enjoy for
as little as $6 for the Calimari
Siciliano (sauteed squid with
mushrooms, tomato and gar
lic ), or as much as $15.50 for the
Shrimp Siciliano. This specialty
is definitely the one if you are up
for "the works:" Italian green
salad, jumbo shrimp sautee,
Italian vegetables, ravioli,
cheese and fruit. Inglenook wine
is included with this as well.
As one who is always in the
mood for seafood, but not neces
sarily in the mood for the same
type of seafood, I find A.
Sabella's to be first rate in the
versatility of its menu. Any
shellfish can be found prepared
at least three different ways,

and most other entrees with at
least two. This is a gratefully
praised switch from many res
taurants which serve only one or
two preparations of the dif
ferent shellfish and seafoods,
and offer much less selection.
Our Thursday evening out at
A. Sabella's was wonderful. The
restaurant was well-occupied
even at 8:30, but not packed. We
were warned that weekend tour
ist crowds make a little bit of
difference in the atmosphere.
Regardless, it is a highly recom
mended experience. The
simplest to the most sophisti
cated palate will be happily sat
isfied at A. Sabella's, and all the
aesthetic pleasures of fine din
ing will be found there as well.
