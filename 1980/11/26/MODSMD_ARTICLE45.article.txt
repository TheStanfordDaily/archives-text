# Watch, then savor: a pizza tradition

Try what you will, but you cannot get the
pizza-makers at Ramona's to crack a smile at
you through the front window. Make faces,
wear a hat with an arrow through it, carry a
machine gun or bring in Cheryl Ladd — they
still are not phased. But they are busy making
some of the best pizza near campus.
Plan on having a wait at this popular estab
lishment, especially on a Saturday night. We
went early (at 6 p.m.) and were.seated after
about 20 minutes. Don't let this time go to
waste, though. You can use it to have a glass of
wine or to enjoy the great selection of imported
beer. Beers include Guiness Stout, Heineken,
Kirin, Molson Ale, Moosehead and San Miguel.
We chose Carlsberg Elephant, but they're all
good a $1.35 a bottle. Ramona's also serves Dr.
Brown's for soft drink connoisseurs.
Expect to see a few friends in the crowd
here. About 60 people filled the tables and
about 20 were enthusiastically waiting to take
their places.
The atmosphere at Ramona's is busy but in
formal and relaxed. The waitresses have a
very easy-going air about them, and never
seemed to push to get people in and out, unlike
many busy restaurants. Wooden tables and
hanging plants contributed to the fresh, natu
ral setting.
Ramona's specializes in pizza and sand
wiches but also offers a wide selection from
the grill. Pizzas, in an amazing number of vari
eties, and smothered in a generous amount of
cheese and other toppings, run from $3.25 to

$5.95 for a small, $5.35 to $8.75 for a medium
and from $7.65 to $11.55 for a 16-inch large. Sub
marine and deli sandwiches, also prepared in
ample portions, run from $2.25 to $3.50.
We started our meal with a trip to the salad
buffet, a bar stocked with delicious garnishes
and dressings. We heaped tomatoes, onions,
bacon, Cheddar cheese and other fresh offer
ings on our plates.
For a change from traditional pizza, we
opted for calzone ($3.95), a whole wheat crust
filled with a delicious combination of
mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, linguica,
Italian sausage, mushrooms and onions. It can
also be ordered vegetarian style. The con
glomeration of delectable ingredients was
baked in a huge, round, enclosed whole wheat
crust.
We also selected a more American entree,
the steak dinner ($6.95). The New York steak
was good-sized, but our favorite part of this
platter was the fantastic French-fried potato
slices. My guest also gave a particularly rave
review to the freshly sauteed mushrooms in
cluded in the steak dinner.
We didn't have room for any more food, but
Ramona's also sells desserts for the am
bitious. Bavarian style cheesecake and Just
Desserts carrot and chocolate fudge cakes are
all priced at just over $1.00.
Full carry-out service is available. Reserva
tions are not taken, so call ahead on weekends
to avoid a wait.
Next time you are walking along Ramona
Street in Palo Alto, try to do something crazy
to make the pizza makers acknowledge your
existence. If it works, please let me know.
