Interest rates boost inflation
Washington — Consumer prices shot up a full percent
again last month, or 12.6 percent at an annual rate, the gov
ernment said yesterday Higher mortgage interest rates
were the main culprit. increased housing costs accounted
tor about three-fifths of the one-month increase.
The figures underscored what economists of all per
suasions have been saying: persistently high inflation will
be one of the major problems President-elect Ronald Re
agan will face when he takes office in January Further
price increases, particularly for food and oil. are already
on the way and will be pushing up the inflation rate over
the coming months
Yesterday's price figures probably exaggerate the in
flationary impact of higher mortgage interest rates. Most
economists agree that the housing component of the con
sumer price index both overstates and delays the effect of
changing interest rates on inflation.
Analysts are divided about the likely course of rates in
the next few months. Many believe that the 17 percent
prime rate now being charged by the major banks to their
best customers is the peak, and that rates may comedown
somewhat in the new year. But the huge increases in the
money supply and rapidly rising interest rates so far this
fall have taken most economists by surprise.
Many economists now believe that the economy may
slow down again next year, after the recovery in the sec
ond half of 1980 High interest rates could choke off de
mand for housing and autos. and a large rise in payroll tax
es. scheduled for January, could also dampen consumer
spending.
New Polish strikes threatened
Warsaw, Poland — In a major escalation of Poland's in
dustrial unrest, the independent trade union movement
Solidarity yesterday demanded reform of the country's se
curity apparatus and threatened a general strike in the
Warsaw region unless six detained activists are released.
The stage appears set for a new confrontation between
Solidarity and the government, with both sides under pres
sure from their own supporters not to back down. The un
ion's latest demands pose the most serious challenge to the
communist authorities since a crisis over Solidarity's le
gal registration two weeks ago.
At least five factories in the Warsaw region, including
the giant tractor plant at Ursus, staged strikes yesterday
to protest against the detention of a young Solidarity ac

tivist. Jan Narozniak. who is under investigation for re
vealing state secrets
Industrial troubles worsened in other parts of the coun
try with miners at nine coal mines in southern Poland stag
ing a warning two-hour strike over a pay dispute. Railway
workers, too. who stopped commuter services in Warsaw
and (Jdansk for four hours yesterday, have threatened to
step up their disruption
The affair has suddenly assumed much wider propor
tions. with the union demanding a full-scale investigation
into the power of the security services and the release of
political dissidents.
The latest crisis was triggered off by a police raid on Sol
idarity's Warsaw headquarters last Thursday. The police
confiscated a copy of a letter signed by the prosecutor-gen
eral that Solidarity claims outlined guidelines for the
harassment and prosecution of union activists and dissi
dents.
Jarozniak's arrest, and the publication of the "secret"
document by Solidarity, have brought growing resentment
among union activists of what they regard as police
harassment to a head The union's Warsaw branch, which
is supported by the central organization, has now evidently
decided to make a stand on the issue while at the same
time attempting to curb police powers.
Iranian Parliament mum on hostages
Beirut, Lebanon — The speaker of the Iranian Par
liament said yesterday that Iran was discussing with Al
gerian intermediaries ways the United States might meet
its terms for the release of the 52 hostages. He declined to
say whether the demands were negotiable.
Parliamentary speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani addressed
a news conference here as U.S. officials in Washington
awaited an Iranian message said to request a further ex
planation of the U.S. position.
The message was being kept secret until handed over to
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie. but officials in Wash
ington said they didn't expect it to amount to a ves-or-no
response to U.S. proposals flown to Algiers by Deputy Sec
retary of State Warren Christopher.
Rafsanjani. speaking in Arabic, told Lebanese reporters
that "discussions are under way in Tehran between the
Iranian government and an Algerian delegation on how the
terms can be met. If America meets Iran's terms, we will
set the hostages free."
He made no mention of the contents of the Iranian

message and dodged a question on whether Iran's terms
tor the captives release were negotiable, saying: "The
demands have been voted by the Majlis (Parliament).
They are just demands and once they are met by the Unit
ed States, we shall give them the hostages."
Iran, Iraq war claims differ
Baghdad, Iraq — Iran claimed yesterday to have cut
into Iraqi positions along the entire 300-mile battlefront
and to have cracked the Iraqi siege of the oil-refining city
of Abadan
Iraq, meanwhile, said it had held back Iran's coun
terattacks and that Abadan was in a "tightening
stranglehold.''
Iraq's Foreign Minister Saadoun Hammadi was quoted
as saying life was returning to normal in most of Iraq de
spite Iranian claims of approaching victory and reports of
heavy fighting inside Iran.
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, meanwhile,
told pilots at Isfahan's airbase in central Iran that his
forces were "approaching the point of forcing the Iraqi
government to concede defeat," the official Pars news
agency reported.
Arab Summit opens with disunity
Amman, Jordan — King Hussein formally opened the
Arab world's most divisive summit in a decade yesterday
as Arab leaders planned one last-ditch mediation effort to
coax an important bloc of boycotting hardliners to join the
session in a final face-saving gesture of the Arab unity.
Speaking center to the 15 rulers and prime ministers
who gathered here, the Jordanian king called for Arab soli
darity and a united strategy for defending Palestinian
rights, but his speech had a hollow ring in view of the fact
that six chairs — including that of the Palestine Liberation
Organization tPLO) — were empty, underlining the dis
unity that has all but doomed the conference.
Aware that the absence of the so-called "Steadfastness
Front" of Syria. Algeria, Libya, South Yemen, and the
PLO, joined this time by Lebanon, made any real dis
cussion of the planned united Arab political strategy for
confronting Israel meaningless, yesterday's conference
limited itself to two brief sessions. Then it adjourned for 24
hours to allow Arab leaders to mount one last mediation
effort to convince the boycotters to come to the con
ference.
In all, the 15 leaders of the 21-nation Arab league met
here for only a little over three hours — two of which were
given over to routine opening speechmaking.

Libya close to victory in Chad
Washington — To the distress of U.S. government of
ficials. Libya's Moammar Khadafy appears on the verge
of winning his first significant military victory outside his
own borders. Some 3000 of his troops are wresting it for
him in the little African country of Chad on Libya's south
ern border.
Libya's display of force has sent shudders through
neighboring African countries but has been largely
eclipsed in western capitals by news of Iran, Iraq, and Af
ghanistan.
Even though Khadafy has sent troops and armor deep
inside Chad and is launching air attacks from three dif
ferent air fields within the country, this big military pres
ence is difficult for other African countries to condemn be
cause. officials said, Khadafy, a radical who constantly
assails the United States, is fighting on the side of the
coalition backed by the Organization of African Unity.
