# New pain drug found effective
## 
### David Frank 
A Stanford anesthesiologist has
proven a new pain-killing drug to be
more effective than morphine in al
leviating post-surgery discomfort.
What makes this information so sig
nificant, explained Dr. William
Forrest, associate professor of
anesthesia, is that the drug —
zomepirac sodium — can be taken
orally.
'Here is a drug that has the poten
tial of opening a new door." Forrest
said, noting that zomepirac sodium
can be swallowed, unlike morphine
which is administered by injection. As
well, he said studies have shown
zomepirac to produce mild side ef
fects. Therefore, he added, physicians
can prescribe the drug to patients who
do not require hospitalization follow
ing certain surgical procedures or
clinical treatments.
But Forrest noted that zomepirac
sodium was approved by the federal
Food and Drug Administration only a
few weeks ago, so until it is prescribed
to the general population, it still is too
early to tell if the drug will produce
undesirable side effects. "Right now.
we can only say the drug has great
potential because of the promise of the
research and testing." Forrest said.
According to Forrest, nearly five
years of testing the drug on both labo
ratory animals and post-operative hu
man patients seems to indicate the
drug's effectiveness in treating a
range of pain conditions.

Forrest's own study dealt specifi
cally with the difference in
zomepirac's analgesic effects on post
operative patients as compared to the
effects produced by morphine, a com
mon pain-killing drug. The study in
volved 104 patients who had recently
undergone abdominal, bone or joint
surgery and were suffering from
either severe or moderate pain.
Forrest reported the results of the
study in the Nov. '21 issue of the Jour
nal of the American Medical Associa
tion.
Patients were administered four
treatments of either zomepirac (in a
pill) or of morphine (by injection).
The medication was given in a " double
blind" manner: patients received
both a pill and a shot when treated, so
as not to know whether the actual
pain-killer was in the pill or in the
shot.
Two dose levels of zomepirac — 100
and 200 milligrams — and morphine —
four and eight milligrams — were ad
ministered. Forrest said five to ten
milligrams of morphine is a common
prescription for post-operative pain.
The effects were determined by
trained nurse observers, who asked
the patients how well a treatment re
lieved the pain
The results, wrote Forrest: . .
both doses of oral zomepirac . . . pro
vided greater alleviation of pain than
either of the intramuscular morphine
treatments."
Zomepirac allowed patients in the

study to go longer without having to
ask for more pain killer. Forrest said.
The results of the study showed that at
least 61 percent of the patients being
treated with zomepirac lasted six
hours without remedication, whereas
only 11 and 16 percent of the morphine
treatment group (four mg. and eight
mg. respectively) did not need medi
cation within six hours.
Forrest likened the side effects of
zomepirac to those of aspirin or co
deine. His study reported that the
most common side effect produced by
zomepirac was sleepiness. The study
showed some 75 percent of the pa
tients with signs of drowsiness or
sedation — with a similar incidence in
both zomepirac and morphine groups.
A feature of zomepirac shown in
other studies on human patients,
Forrest noted, is that zomepirac ap
parently produces no dependence or
addiction as can be the case with
morphine.
Forrest also told the Daily about
different constraints on his study
sampling. One was the small size of
the sampling — 104 persons. Another
were FL)A rules: one required that
women in the study be of child-bearing
age . another rule stipulated that the
patients being tested be in good health
— aside from the affliction that re
quired them to have surgery.
Therefore, Forrest said the study
results are not necessarily indicative
of what may happen when zomepirac
is prescribed among the general popu
lation.
