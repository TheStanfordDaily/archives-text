From the Daily wire services
Naples, Italy — Desperate rescue
workers hacked at piles of rubble with
shovels and picks yesterday and tried
to reach isolated mountain villages
shattered by an earthquake that of
ficials estimated killed more than
3 000 people in southern Italy.
"Dig. dig here please. My brother is
underneath," a little girl in a dirty
dress told rescue workers in Avellino.
23 miles east of Naples.
There was still no count of victims
in some mountain villages, reported 90
percent destroyed bv the quake that
struck Sunday night. Rescue teams
could not drive bulldozers or trucks up
narrow roads, many of which are
blocked by fallen rocks.
"A helicopter came down this
morning and a man asked us what we
needed," said a young man in Conza. a
village 54 miles east of Naples. "We
said we needed everything and he left.
"There are about 150 alive here. I
don't know anything about the others.
There were 700 of us before. Maybe
they're all dead."
The Italian military command esti
mated the death toll as at least 3132 af
ter learning of isolated villages devas
tated in the mountains behind Naples
and Salerno. That would make it Ita
ly's worst earthquake since 1915, when
30,000 people died in the Avezzano re

gion of central Italy.
Giuseppe Zamberletti, director of
relief operations, said 1750 were
known dead and there was little hope
of finding alive an additional 570 who
were missing. Thousands were in
jured and 100,000 were homeless.
At Laviano, in Salerno province,
only three buildings were left standing
and local officials could not account
for an estimated 1000 people. Nearby
Santomenna was virtually demolished
and a thousand were missing there as

well.
Two strong aftershocks around mid
day toppled more buildings in the
quake zone. Those and additional,
weaker shocks panicked survivors
shivering in tents, cars or makeshift
shelters.
Pope John Paul II toured the quake
zone by helicopter, visiting a hospital
and the village of Balvano, where as
many as 100 died when the Roman
Catholic Church collapsed during eve
ning Mass.
"I have come as your brother and
pastor." the pontiff said as he kissed a
girl with*a bandaged head. "You are
surrounded by the compassion of eve
rybody."
His face reflecting the tragedy he
was seeing yesterday, the pope went
among the survivors of the Sunday
night earthquake with a message of
solidarity for the suffering.
It was one of those rare papal ap
pearances when no hand clapped, no
voice cheered.
The pope refused a car and walked
among the people of Potenza as he
made his way to the hospital that con
tained, among others, survivors of the
church collapse.
The -white-robed pontiff wanted to
visit the site of the church, but police
and soldiers kept him away for fear
that aftershocks would topple the
ruins.
Even as he visited the area, the of
ficial count of the dead went above
2000, and the toll was expected to go
higher.
Aerial surveys showed four hamlets
with a combined population of 8 500 to
tally destroyed, and nine others vir
tually destroyed.
But survivors were still being found
in the mountains of rubble.
More than 100.000 remained without

shelter yesterday as military and ci
vilian aircraft started an airlift from
northern Italy to the airport here car
rying tents and other emergency sup
plies. Some areas remained without
help on yesterday afternoon, however,
and in some urban areas, including
Salerno, there was a shortage of food.
The magnitude of the region af
fected, and the size of the population
involved — seven million — had over
whelmed early rescue efforts. Prime
Minister Arnaldo Forlani has called a
second emergency meeting of the
Council of Ministers for today to try to
improve the rescue and assistance ef
fort.
"I can bring you nothing," the pope
told survivors in Potenza, where he
spent an hour and 15 minutes yester
day afternoon.
"I am here with you with my pres
ence, my blessing, my prayers," he
added.
As he moved through the silent
crowd both he and the people reflected
the high emotion of his mission.
He spoke of the "solidarity of the
church with suffering" and added that
"pain sanctifies and makes men more
brotherly as death brings us closer to
the death of Christ and through it to
the Resurrection."
Another of the pope's stops was at
Avellino, where he visited a hospital
its functions transferred from the
damaged and abandoned building to

tents nearby.
The quake damaged 109 cities,
towns and villages in the poverty
stricken area at the ankle of the Ital
ian boot. The quake registered 6.8 or.
the Richter scale.
Rescuers were out of touch with
many towns because phone lines were
still down. The state-owned telephone
company SIP said it had not yet lo
cated all the linebreaks.
The United States lent Italy four
helicopters for relief operations and
the U.S. Embassy in Rome said the
American government had allocated
$1.5 million for relief.
Here in Naples, less seriously af
fected than the areas near the
epicenter to the east, life began to re
sume its chaotic normalcy, although
some residents continued to sleep in
cars parked in the piazzas or to camp
in sports stadiums rather than return
to their apartments.
