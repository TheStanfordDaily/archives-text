Naples, Italy â€” Desperate rescue
workers hacked at piles of rubble with
shovels and picks yesterday and tried
to reach isolated mountain villages
shattered by an earthquake that of
ficials estimated killed more than
3 000 people in southern Italy.
"Dig. dig here please. My brother is
underneath," a little girl in a dirty
dress told rescue workers in Avellino.
23 miles east of Naples.
There was still no count of victims
in some mountain villages, reported 90
percent destroyed bv the quake that
struck Sunday night. Rescue teams
could not drive bulldozers or trucks up
narrow roads, many of which are
blocked by fallen rocks.
"A helicopter came down this

of finding alive an additional 570 who
were missing. Thousands were in

At Laviano, in Salerno province,
only three buildings were left standing
and local officials could not account
for an estimated 1000 people. Nearby
Santomenna was virtually demolished
and a thousand were missing there as

well.
Two strong aftershocks around mid
day toppled more buildings in the
quake zone. Those and additional,
weaker shocks panicked survivors
shivering in tents, cars or makeshift
shelters.
Pope John Paul II toured the quake
zone by helicopter, visiting a hospital
