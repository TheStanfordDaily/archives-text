# Business school bans firm from recruitment
## 
### Samuel Howe 
A prestigious consulting firm has
been prohibited from interviewing
any first-year Graduate School of
Business (GSB) students here after
the firm knowingly violated a rule
against recruiting first-year students
before February.
The firm has since written a letter
to Business School students justifying
the action.
The restriction, in effect for the re
mainder of the academic year, is the
first to come about as a result of re
cruiting guidelines developed last
year, according to Richard Johnson,
director of placement at the GSB, who
authorized the restriction.
Specifically, the guidelines do not
permit any interviews of first-year
students for summer work until the
middle of February. According to
Johnson, these guidelines were de
veloped for two reasons. "We wanted
to support our academic priorities and
we wanted to promote fair recruiting"
among competitors.
Boston Consulting Group (BCG)
vice president Anthony Miles, how
ever, charged in the letter to students
that the policy made it difficult for his
firm to interview foreign students and
refer them to overseas branches of the
company, which could then interview
prospective employees over the
Christmas vacation.
Miles said that the BCG, which has
overseas offices in London, Munich,
Paris and Tokyo, as well as a West
coast office in Menlo Park, conscious
ly violated the guidelines because ex
emptions of first-year foreign stu
dents from a beginning interview date
had been allowed in the past, and the
removal of that exemption presented

"a number of disadvantages."
While the decision to bar BCG from
first-year recruiting presents no real
hardships, and interviews originally
scheduled at Stanford will now take
place in the firm's Menlo Park office,
the incident does point up a concern
about the aggressiveness of some re
cruiters.
"This is a highly competitive situ
ation and each organization is striving
to be first," said placement director
Johnson in a Los Angeles Times in
terview shortly after the incident.
Consulting groups, which customarily
take about 30 percent of graduating
MBAs. hire first-year students for the
summer as a prelude to considering
them for jobs after graduation which
pay as much as $40,000 per year.
Miles called the ban "a serious pen
alty. and highly unusual." He also said
that the guidelines could force poten
tial foreign employees who return
home for Christmas to return home
once more for interviews later in the
winter because they would not have
been able to be selected for interviews
before that time.
The placement center contends it is
important that students focus on the
academic program during the first
weeks of school and not on summer job
possibilities.
Johnson said yesterday that wheth
er the students themselves mind the
restrictions is "an open-ended ques
tion. They were put in place last year,
after discussion with students, faculy
and recruiters." He also said that con
cern for students and their academic
prospects "really was the key con
sideration" behind the guidelines.
