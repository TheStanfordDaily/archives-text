# Judy Grahn speaks on role as poet
## 
### Liz Rosner 
"My intention is to write poetry for every
one," poet Judy Grahn said last Wednes
day in Terman Auditorium The last speak
er in the CROW series "Dialogues with
West Coast Women Writers," she was in
terviewed by English Professor John
Felstiner.'
Grahn, who has published several vol
umes of poetry, including Edward the
Dyke, A Woman is Talking to Death, and
her most recent collection, The Work of a
Common Woman, spent the noon hour read
ing and discussing a number of her poems,
and discussing her commitment to poetry as
a means of understanding the world
She spoke about the historical role of
poets and their ability "to enlighten us and
use language in its most potent form."
Grahn's reading of a poem about Marilyn
Monroe had a powerful impact on her au
dience; she sneered as she read, and her
voice sounded angry, sardonic and almost
vicious as she expressed contempt for socie
ty's treatment of Monroe.
"I'm really talking about all of us who
want to succeed and see a symbol of Holly
wood success commit suicide ... I don't

want that to happen to any of us again,"
Grahn said
Commenting on what Grahn read,
Kelstiner said that some of his students who
had read the poem had "wondered about its
tone ..."
"Now they know." Grahn replied, half
jokingly.
After reading her poem "Vera: From My
Childhood." (a poem about her mother from
the Common Woman series written in
1969). Grahn explained that the "multi
plicity of meanings" implied by the word
"common" — common whore, commons of
England and Boston, cross-connections we
have in common — gave the poems an ex
tra impetus."
"The reclamation of the word's full value
is the target I've aimed at," Grahn said.
Grahn told the audience she was an "ec
centric child — a combination tomboy and
poet " who began writing poetry at the age of
six.
In response to Felstiner's question about
acquiring experience by "bumming
around," Grahn said:
"As a female, a woman of little means
and little secretarial skills, and a militant

lesbian ... it was more than bumming
around, it was getting kicked around and
floating around."
(Jrahn discussed her role in helping to
found the institution of Separatism (the rad
ical feminist movement espousing com
plete segregation of men and women) in
1969; at that time, she began writing specifi
cally about women's issues and lives, feel
ing she couldn't learn about those things
from men.
"For women, separatism has been a
home base for launching various issues into
society." Grahn explained.
She also said that "men would dress up as
women to come to my poetry readings —
that really astonished me."
There was a period in her life when she
was very ill with brain fever, Grahn said. "I
went into a coma; I couldn't remember any
thing or name anything . . . but I was very
happy.
"During that time. I realized I would have
to take every risk there was," she said.
"I bought a notebook, a very strange hat,
went to a bar and told everyone I was a poet.
I was 25 years old, and I decided I'd never
again do what I didn't want to do."
