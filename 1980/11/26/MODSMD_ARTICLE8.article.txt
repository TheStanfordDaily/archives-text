# Injuries cost $14.4 billion per year
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Medical bills and lost earnings caused by
motor vehicle injuries amount to $14.4
billion a year — a money toll far greater
than is attributable to either heart attacks
or strokes — a new economic study pub
lished today indicates.
Only cancer — with an estimated annual
cost of $23 1 billion in lost income and medi
cal expenses — outstrips motor vehicle
crashes among four leading causes of death
and disability for Americans, the new re
search concludes.
There should be a clear message in this,
the study's principal author contended yes
terday. even for a conservative Republican
administration comitted to the need for
clear economic benefits from government
regulation.
Federal rules mandating everything
from motorcycle helmet use to automobile
air bags should be strengthened and not cut.
since — unlike cancer, heart disease and
stroke — motor vehicle injuries constitute
an almost entirely preventable medical
problem, the researcher argued.
The new study is published in the Decem
ber issue of the American Journal of Public
Health. The cost computations were per
formed by a Belmont. Mass., research com
pany and an expert at the Harvard Univer
sity School of Public Health.
The study is the first major work in more
than 14 years that attempts to compute ac
tual economic costs for significant Ameri
can medical problems. A more detailed re
port of the new research is scheduled for
publication in book form early next year.
The Massachusetts-based researchers
contend that, while the fiscal toll of motor

vehicle accidents is enormous, the role of
motor vehicle injuries in the national medi
cal-cost spiral has been largely ignored.
"People seem to assume that accident in
juries are just a cost of doing business," ob
served Charles Smart, the study's principal
author. "Ironically, they do not feel the
same way about heart attacks, for instance,
being something that represents a cost of
our lifestyle."
To arrive at their cost figures, Smart and
two other researchers analyzed economic
data for 1975, employing new and apparent
ly reliable methods never before used in the
economics of medicine.
Among the key findings:
—In addition to the cost tolls for cancer
and motor vehicle injuries, heart disease
generated economic losses in medical bills
and lost earnings of $13.7 billion, and stroke
$6.5 billion.
—Because motor vehicle accident in
juries peak in the 15-24 age bracket, lost
earnings figures for victims are far higher
than for any of the three major illnesses. A
young person killed or seriously hurt in a
crash stands to lose an average of $222,283
in future income, versus $159,745 for a some
what older heart attack victim and $105,409
for a cancer victim under 34.
—Because motor vehicle accident in
juries are often severe — and require costly
medical care — treatment costs for surviv
ing accident victims in the year after they
are injured amount to an estimated $2.8
billion. First-year cancer treatment is more
costly, the study concluded, amounting to
$4.1 billion.

—Motor vehicle deaths — 44,000 a year —
outnumber new cases of five of the most
deadly forms of cancer, including leukemia.
Release of the new figures, however,
comes as more states are repealing or wa
tering down laws that require the use of mo
torcycle helmets — a key example of a safe
ty regulation. Smart said. Twenty-eight
states already have done so, the National
Safety Council has reported.
As action to repeal the helmet laws has in
creased — at one time, only two states did
not have strict helmet laws — motorcycle
fatalities have jumped from 3370 in 1974 to
4850 last year. Almost all of the increase is
blamed on head injuries.
Colorado, the safety council found, ex
perienced a 260 percent increase in severe
head injuries after its helmet law was re
pealed. Deaths increased more than 50
percent in that state. But the laws have
fallen victim to political pressures from
motorcycle rider groups.
"Even though you might have a condition
like cancer that is more costly," Smart
said, "there is not a great deal you can do
about that. But with motor vehicle injuries
and deaths, we have a great many options,
like air bags, better automatic safety-belt
systems and motorcycle helmets."
Smart said that the incoming adminis
tration of President-elect Ronald Reagan
should examine the cost-benefit aspect of
increased federal regulation of motor vehi
cle safety.
The new study was financed by the Wash
ington-based Insurance Institute for High
way Safety.
