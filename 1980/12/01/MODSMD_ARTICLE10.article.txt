# North Ireland prisoners protest UK rule

From the Daily wire services
Belfast, Northern Ireland — The
threat of renewed violence hangs over
Ulster, where seven Irish Republican
Army prisoners yesterday entered their
sixth week of a hunger strike.
The seven detainees in Cell Block H at
Long Kesh Prison here are reported to be
seriously weakened, but unfaltering in
their determination to strike "until
death," according to the IRA political
wing, Provisional Sinn Fein.
Meanwhile, the Catholic community
holds vigil. The sight of a coffin could
furnish them with a new "martyr," trig
gering another episode in a country
scarred by often fatal outbreaks during
10 years of political impasse.
the strikers, sentenced to long terms
for murder, attempted murder or
possession of arms or explosives, are
leading the bid on behalf of their 350 fel
low prisoners for the reinstatement of
the political prisoner status, abolished in
1976.
Should one of the strikers die, the IRA
has made it known that his fast will be

taken up by another prisoner.
This "hunger marathon." the latest in
the Irish nationalist combat against
"British occupation," has united the
Catholic community in Northern Ireland.
Each week solidarity demonstrations
are held in the streets of Belfast, London
derry and other Ulster towns, recalling
the massive demonstrations of 10 years
ago.
Today, three Republican detainees in
the Armagh women's prison, 30 miles
southwest of here, will add a new thrust
to the movement when they join the hun
ger strike to demand advantages given to
political prisoners in the past.

In Cell Block H, the hunger strike has
mobilized extremist Protestant pris
oners. "We are at war," a leader of the
paramilitary group, Ulster Defense As
sociation. said this week. He warned that
any IRA attempt to use violence to ex
ploit the tension sparked by the hunger
strike would be answered with an attack
on the Republican zones. "We will
eliminate them," he said.

Already, one person was killed and
three injured during so-called intimida
tion raids by armed, masked men into a
Catholic neighborhood here during the
first few days of the strike.
The major political parties, both here
and in London, for once all agree in sup
porting Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's decision to refuse to grant the
"criminals" political status.
Yet no new hopes for a political settle
ment are in sight. Ulster has been under
the direct rule of the British Parliament
since 1974. Despite the persistent support
by British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland Humphrey Atkins over
the last year for the re-establishment of a
provincial government in Belfast, the
major stumbling block remains intact:
The Catholic minority and the Protestant
majority cannot agree on how to share
the power.
This failure, and mounting tension
since the strike, have hardened the
parties' intransigence, once again
dashing hopes for a reconciliation.
