# Colleges try the cost-benefit game
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — New York Uni
versity (NYU) deliberately
doubled the size of many classes
in the 19705. The reason: with 10
students, a college course bare
ly collects enough tuition to pay
the professor; with 20, it may
turn a profit.
Now, colleges all over the
country are putting more and
more stress on night school and
summer school because these
programs can be taught by part
time teachers and run at a sur
plus.
University administrators
also are looking hard at the cost
benefit ratios of various sub
jects : NYU junked its costly en
gineering school and got rid of
the faculty during a financial
crisis; Duke University may
wipe out its nursing school be
cause its outlays per student are
too high.
And money-hungry colleges
are getting into businesses not
directly related to education:
George Washington University
is into real estate, with two of
fice buildings producing reven
ue and three others under con
struction; NYU owned a noodle
factory, Mueller's macaroni,
but sold it and put the money in
securities to boost income from
$2 million to $10 million a year;
Duke runs summer athletic
camps for youngsters at $150 a
week.
Education is big business
Higher education today is one
of the biggest businesses in the
country, with operating reven
ues of $52 billion, about 11.5 mil
lion students and 1.8 million em
ployees. And, like some other of
the nation's basic industries,
it's in trouble.
The culprits are inflation and
a declining market. Colleges
and universities are finding that
their costs are rising faster than
their incomes, and it is happen
ing at a time when the nation's

population is growing older, and
the number of student-age peo
ple smaller.
So where once universities
thought of themselves as com
munities of scholars, heedless
of commercial pressures, today
their administrators are talking
of "cost centers" and "profit
centers" on campus.
The most acute problem is in
flation. Although the prices paid
by universities for the things
they need haven't risen quite as
fast as the consumer price in
dex, the market basket of what
colleges buy, ranging from
teacher salaries to books, peri
odicals. electricity and fuel, has
jumped 85 percent from 1971 to
1980 as measured by the higher
education price index.
Endowment income lags
Colleges and universities
have had to scramble to keep
pace, particularly because their
endowment income, which may
constitute 15 or 20 percent of dis
cretionary income for a private
institution, has lagged, return
ing an average of only 4.77
percent during the 19705.
To meet the crisis, colleges
have used three principal meth
ods:
— Private institutions have
raised tuition dramatically, as
many parents are ruefully
aware. Harvard boosted tuition
from $2 600 in 1970-71 to $6 000
now. George Washington went
up from $1 900 to $3 400. Duke
jumped from $2 000 to $4 740.
Public colleges, financed by
state appropriations instead of
tuition, have had to seek sub
stantially more money from the
legislatures.
— Colleges have held faculty
salaries down in real terms. Ac
cording to a gloomy report by
the American Association of
University Professors, salaries
by rank rose 67 percent over the
19705, but consumer prices rose
so much faster that salaries ac

tually dropped 18 to 19 percent in
real value
— Colleges have deferred
both maintenance and invest
ment in new plant and equip
ment. particularly investment
in new ••state-of-the-art" scien
tific instruments for the most
sophisticated kinds of research.
One recent study estimated
that, in constant dollars, annual
investment of all types dropped
from $8 billion in 1966-67 to $5
billion a decade later. Median
age of university research in
strumentation is now estimated
at double that of commercial
laboratories.
But even these policies
haven't been enough to meet the
financial pressure, so colleges
and universities, quietly and
with little fanfare, have started
doing a lot of other things to cut
costs and generate "surpluses"
in some of their activities (the
word "profit" is rarely used).
Some of these policies are
central to the educational proc
ess and begin with a set of
shared perceptions about the
costs of different university
functions, outlined in a series of
interviews with Duke Univer
sity Chancellor Kenneth Fye
and Vice Chancellor Joel
Hleischman, GW's director of
planning William D. Johnson,
NYU vice president for finance
Allan Claxton. David Breneman
of the Brookings Institution and
Jerold Roschwalb of the Na
tional Association of State Uni
versities and Land Grant Col
leges. Not all agree on every
point, but this is the consensus:
— A university or college is
"a vast system of cross-sub
sidization," as Breneman put it.
Some functions or schools pay
for themselves or even return a
surplus. Others are tremendous
losers and drain money from
elsewhere in the institution.
Thus, one money-saving de
vice is to put more students in

each class The extra tuition is
pure gravy, though educational
quality must be watched,
— Another money-saving de
vice is to use more low-paid,
part-time or non-tenured facul
ty. often graduate students, in
stead of replacing high-paid
tenured faculty when they re
tire. This is being done in many
places, according to the Ameri
can Association of University
Professors.
— In general, off-campus and
continuing education courses,
both degree and non-degree pro
grams. are a strong possibility
to make money. They use low
rent or no-rent facilities, meet
ing in places like the Pentagon,
an office building, or the univer
sity's own empty classrooms at
night. They often use relatively
low-paid, part-time teachers
who get no fringe benefits and
much smaller salaries per
course than regular professors.

in the 19705. The reason: with 10
students, a college course bare
ly collects enough tuition to pay
the professor; with 20, it may
turn a profit.
Now, colleges all over the
country are putting more and
more stress on night school and
summer school because these
programs can be taught by part
time teachers and run at a sur
plus.
University administrators
also are looking hard at the cost
benefit ratios of various sub
jects : NYU junked its costly en
gineering school and got rid of
the faculty during a financial
crisis; Duke University may
wipe out its nursing school be
cause its outlays per student are
too high.
And money-hungry colleges
are getting into businesses not
directly related to education:
George Washington University
is into real estate, with two of
fice buildings producing reven
ue and three others under con
struction; NYU owned a noodle
factory, Mueller's macaroni,
but sold it and put the money in
securities to boost income from
$2 million to $10 million a year;
Duke runs summer athletic
camps for youngsters at $150 a
week.
Education is big business
Higher education today is one
of the biggest businesses in the
country, with operating reven
ues of $52 billion, about 11.5 mil
lion students and 1.8 million em
ployees. And, like some other of
the nation's basic industries,
it's in trouble.
The culprits are inflation and
a declining market. Colleges
and universities are finding that
their costs are rising faster than
their incomes, and it is happen
ing at a time when the nation's

population is growing older, and
the number of student-age peo
ple smaller.
So where once universities
thought of themselves as com
munities of scholars, heedless
of commercial pressures, today
their administrators are talking
of "cost centers" and "profit
centers" on campus.
The most acute problem is in
flation. Although the prices paid
by universities for the things
they need haven't risen quite as
fast as the consumer price in
dex, the market basket of what
colleges buy, ranging from
teacher salaries to books, peri
odicals. electricity and fuel, has
jumped 85 percent from 1971 to
1980 as measured by the higher
education price index.
Endowment income lags
Colleges and universities
have had to scramble to keep
pace, particularly because their
endowment income, which may
constitute 15 or 20 percent of dis
cretionary income for a private
institution, has lagged, return
ing an average of only 4.77
percent during the 19705.
To meet the crisis, colleges
have used three principal meth
ods:
— Private institutions have
raised tuition dramatically, as
many parents are ruefully
aware. Harvard boosted tuition
from $2 600 in 1970-71 to $6 000
now. George Washington went
up from $1 900 to $3 400. Duke
jumped from $2 000 to $4 740.
Public colleges, financed by
state appropriations instead of
tuition, have had to seek sub
stantially more money from the
legislatures.
— Colleges have held faculty
salaries down in real terms. Ac
cording to a gloomy report by
the American Association of
University Professors, salaries
by rank rose 67 percent over the
19705, but consumer prices rose
so much faster that salaries ac

tually dropped 18 to 19 percent in
real value
— Colleges have deferred
both maintenance and invest
ment in new plant and equip
ment. particularly investment
in new ••state-of-the-art" scien
tific instruments for the most
sophisticated kinds of research.
One recent study estimated
that, in constant dollars, annual
investment of all types dropped
from $8 billion in 1966-67 to $5
billion a decade later. Median
age of university research in
strumentation is now estimated
at double that of commercial
laboratories.
But even these policies
haven't been enough to meet the
financial pressure, so colleges
and universities, quietly and
with little fanfare, have started
doing a lot of other things to cut
costs and generate "surpluses"
in some of their activities (the
word "profit" is rarely used).
Some of these policies are
central to the educational proc
ess and begin with a set of
shared perceptions about the
costs of different university
functions, outlined in a series of
interviews with Duke Univer
sity Chancellor Kenneth Fye
and Vice Chancellor Joel
Hleischman, GW's director of
planning William D. Johnson,
NYU vice president for finance
Allan Claxton. David Breneman
of the Brookings Institution and
Jerold Roschwalb of the Na
tional Association of State Uni
versities and Land Grant Col
leges. Not all agree on every
point, but this is the consensus:
— A university or college is
"a vast system of cross-sub
sidization," as Breneman put it.
Some functions or schools pay
for themselves or even return a
surplus. Others are tremendous
losers and drain money from
elsewhere in the institution.
Thus, one money-saving de
vice is to put more students in

each class The extra tuition is
pure gravy, though educational
quality must be watched,
— Another money-saving de
vice is to use more low-paid,
part-time or non-tenured facul
ty. often graduate students, in
stead of replacing high-paid
tenured faculty when they re
tire. This is being done in many
places, according to the Ameri
can Association of University
Professors.
— In general, off-campus and
continuing education courses,
both degree and non-degree pro
grams. are a strong possibility
to make money. They use low
rent or no-rent facilities, meet
ing in places like the Pentagon,
an office building, or the univer
sity's own empty classrooms at
night. They often use relatively
low-paid, part-time teachers
who get no fringe benefits and
much smaller salaries per
course than regular professors.
