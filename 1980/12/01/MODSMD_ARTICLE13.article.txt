■ We just want people to make an informed
choice" said Julie Barnard, a leading member
of Stanford Against Conscription (SAO.
speaking of the road show sessions the
group is conducting in University dorms and
residences
The road shows are particularly focused at
18-year-old males who face required regis
tration in January Yet. SAC also hopes the
shows will reach other students. "We want to
get across in the road shows that this is an issue
that affects all of us. said Barnard
The most recent SAC show was held in the
Alondra lounge at Florence Moore last Monday
evening SAC member John Stacy opened the
meeting by asking the members of the au
dience to introduce themselves to the rest of
the group The atmosphere informal; as Stacy
explained. We want to find out how people
feel about the draft."
The new Alondra road show was conducted
by four SAC members, each of whom spoke on
a different aspect of draft registration
After Stacy's introductory words about
SAC's two-and-a-half-year history at Stanford,
SAC member Jack Landv gave a detailed his
tory of conscription in the United States.
Landy explained that the first peace time
draft registration was instituted in 1940, in a
highly contested bill that passed Congress by
only one vote, in spite of the fact that the Unit
ed States entered World War II only a few
months later
The present registration system, Landy
said, was pushed through Congress last spring,
even though it violates recent federal legisla
tion For example, in its requirement that each
registrant disclose his social security number,
Landy claims the registration act violated the
Federal Privacy Act of 1974. In addition, the
present system went into effect only after a
staying order by Supreme Court Justice Wil
liam Brennan temporarily waving the regis
tration act's compliance with federal sex-dis
crimination legislation — specifically, against
males.

The next SAC speaker at Alondra stated that
he had not taken part in the .July registration
because of moral and legalistic objections.
"Registration, he said, "in itself provides no
useful service
During this speaker's presentation, one
member of the audience interrupted numerous
times, finally arguing "We can't have a coun
try without conscription The SAC speaker
responded that "Registration will increase the
risk of major-power confrontation "
The woman's perspective on registration
was presented by SAC member Elizabeth
Johnson. She rejected the view of some
feminists that women should be required to
register by saying that "Drafting men and
women is equally wrong She also said that if
women were forced to enter the nation's mili
tary forces it would "perpetuate oppression of
women
The SAC speakers listed a number of alter
native actions to registering that were taken
by some of those required to register in July:
not registering, leaving out their social secur
ity numbers, or noting on the form that they
were conscientious objectors, or were regis
tering under protest.
Although SAC has an anti-registration orien
tation. the road show speakers underscored the
importance of registrants seriously consider
ing the issues involved and then following their
consciences, even if that means registering
One SAC speaker quoted the famous Ameri
can statesman Daniel Webster, who said in
1814 that "A free government with military
conscription is the most ridiculous and
abominable contradiction that ever entered
into the head of man
Commenting on SAC's series of road shows,
Barnard said "Hopefully we'll be doing them
all year. As the situation progresses, we'll still
need to talk to people.''
Although Barnard acknowledged recent SAC
member meetings have seen relatively limited
campus involvement, she has a feeling that "in
January we'll see some broader partici
pation."

The SAC speakers listed a number of alter
native actions to registering that were taken
by some of those required to register in July:
not registering, leaving out their social secur
ity numbers, or noting on the form that they
were conscientious objectors, or were regis
tering under protest.
Although SAC has an anti-registration orien
tation. the road show speakers underscored the
importance of registrants seriously consider
ing the issues involved and then following their
consciences, even if that means registering
One SAC speaker quoted the famous Ameri
can statesman Daniel Webster, who said in
1814 that "A free government with military
conscription is the most ridiculous and
abominable contradiction that ever entered
into the head of man
Commenting on SAC's series of road shows,
Barnard said "Hopefully we'll be doing them
all year. As the situation progresses, we'll still
need to talk to people.''
Although Barnard acknowledged recent SAC
member meetings have seen relatively limited
campus involvement, she has a feeling that "in
January we'll see some broader partici
pation."
