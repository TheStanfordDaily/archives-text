"Great literature never teaches us any
thing new. It only reminds us of things that
often we wish we didn't know," said Assoc.
English Prof. William Chace.
Promising to be "candid and con
fessional," he spoke to the Stanford Moth
ers' Club Nov. 11 on the topic, "When you
talk about a great work of literature, what
do you talk about?"
One problem in teaching literature, said
Chace, is that "literature, unlike science,
unlike economics, unlike the principles of
business, is odd in the fact that it doesn't
teach you things that you don't already
know. The irony is that you cannot read lit
erature successfully unless you already
know the final truths of the literary work."
This seeming paradox creates problems
for the teacher, said Chace. "If I say this to
students, some of them perceive my
statements with a puzzled look, and moveon
to the sciences. It's clear in the math se

quence and the chemistry sequence that
you're always learning things that you
didn't know before.
"Some students go around saying, 'don't
take English or the fine arts; those are the
fuzzy studies. Get into something real and
sharp.' "
Yet this very fuzziness. claimed Chace, is
one of literature's strengths.
"Literature takes as its exclusive domain
questions that cannot easily by answered.
The greater the literary work, the more
powerfully it grapples with those questions
that, for as long as people will live, cannot
conclusively be answered."
Chace cited works such as Hamlet, Mac
beth, and Oedipus to illustrate his point
that great works of literature "are situated
exactly on the most ambiguous and un
answerable conflicts that human beings
face."
One approach to teaching, said Chace, is
to provide ethical and moral guidance to

students, and to try and "in some indirect,
fuzzy, vague way make them better.
Or, he said, "One can abandon this hope
on the grounds that either the students are
so good that they don't need any help, or
they're so hopelessly damaged by their pa
rents that they're beyond repair."
Stanford students tend to come up with
many different analyses of a literary work,
all of which may be right in their own per
spective. said Chace.
But basically, he said, universities exist
because professors want to talk, and stu
dents want to learn bv listening.
Literature and humanities are nota "take
it or leave it proposition." according to
Chace, but are central powers of any cul
ture.
"The deepest feeling I have when I teach
literature is a simple feeling of awe and re
spect. It will be around long after I'm gone,
so while I'm here. I might as well take a
good close look at it,"he concluded.
