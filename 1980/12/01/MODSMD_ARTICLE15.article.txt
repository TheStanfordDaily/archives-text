# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Larry Sheehan Greensboro trial and racism 
### 
1 read with incredulity Don Willenburg's col
umn (Daily, Nov. 26) on the recent Greensboro
trial of four Ku Klux Klansmen and two Nazis for
the murder of five Communist Workers Party
members. Willenburg depicts the CWP as a "cold
and ruthless" organization that refused to testify
at the trial in a move guaranteed to lead to the ac
quittal of the racists. With the Klan acquitted, he
reasons, the CWP could go about methodically
cashing in on the outrage pouring forth around the
country to further their own extremist philosophy
of unyielding devotion to Mao and proletarian in
ternationalism. Further, he implies that the "cold
and ruthless" CWP can be thusly blamed for any
future bloodspilling carried out bv the Klan.
Willenburg s proposition seems to be that the
CWP's refusal to testify was strictly a publicity
move which, while focusing attention on the CWP
and its slain leadership, has ultimately given a
green light to racist violence.
I find his logic to be twisted. There is no doubt
that the CWP became strengthened and gained
notoriety' because of the slaughter of their lead
ership on Nov. 3. 1979. That only seems natural,
given that the organization is tightly-knit and
holds a Marxist line. But to state that they refused
to testify in the trial just to gather attention unto
themselves is totally false.
A few words about those extremist Marxists
need to be related. Bill Sampson, James Waller,
Cesar Cauce. Michael Nathan and Sandy Smith
. were all well-educated, caring, dedicated and
courageous people, not hating and selfish, who
had long worked as union organizers of North Car
olina's textile and hospital workers. I have
worked to organize communities in the South. I
know that in union organizing in "right to work"
states, dedication is a must.
All five CWP members were shot in the head or
heart that day in Greensboro. Media people were
there to film the incident but the police were mys
teriously absent. I've seen the video tapes of the
incident several times and the Klansmen's facial
expressions were those of good ol' boys at a turkey
shoot. They didn't appear worried in the least
about return fire from the police or demonstrat
ors. And when Willenburg says the CWP was "less
well-armed" that fateful day, he delivers a mis
nomer. The CWP had only one .38 revolver (car
ried by Bill Sampson only because his life had
been threatened several times before). Their poli
cy was that no firearms should be carried at dem
onstrations. On the other hand, the Klan had shot
guns and M-16 rifles.

Where the police were that November day has
never been satisfactorily answered. The trial jury
picked was all white and none were questioned
about their attitudes toward race before the trial
began In addition, some of the post-trial com
ments by the jurors reveal a decided slant in their
views toward the Klan's being super patriots act
ing in self-defense while members of the CWP
were subhuman communists, "unworthy of pro
tection by our laws"..
And more questions: Why were only 16 of the 40
Klansmen indicted? Why was that number subse
quently to only six? Why weren't the owners of the
Klan's guns indicted? Why were conspiracy
charges against them dropped? This made it nec
essary to prove who shot whom (difficult when the
buckshot of a shotgun is involved). Why was the
CWP's request for a special prosecutor snubbed?
Why did the prosecution fail to subpoena two gov
ernment agents (Bernard Butkovich of the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Ed
Dawson, a police department informer) for their
role in the murders?
The events in Greensboro led Anne Braden.
cochairperson of the Southern Organizing Com
mittee for Economic and Social Justice, to com
ment: "There were four crimes committed in
Greensboro. The first was the Nov. 3. 1979
murders; the second was the "blame the victims"
campaign by the state; the third was the federal
and local governments' involvement in the cov
erup of the murders; and the fourth was these out
rageous acquittals." The trial was a farce from
start to finish. Willenburg's contention that the
CWP's failure to testify led to the acquittals
doesn't hold water.
In the last paragraph of his column. Willenburg
states that the CWO must be held accountable for
further bloodshed by the Klan. This is an in
credible statement. Nothing was said about the
need to fight racism in all its forms (in this case
the pathological hating of the Klan). Nothing was
said about the racist upsurge spreading through
out the country (from Miami to Atlanta to Green
sboro to Indianapolis) aided and abetted by seem
ingly "indifferent prosecution and climate of ra
cism and anticommunism emanating from feder
al and regional government". Why Willenburg is
so vindictive toward a tiny Marxist group for not
participating in a farcical trial is incom
prehensible. I would think his energies would be
more usefully spent attacking racism rather than
some its victims.

holds a Marxist line. But to state that they refused
to testify in the trial just to gather attention unto
themselves is totally false.
A few words about those extremist Marxists
need to be related. Bill Sampson, James Waller,
Cesar Cauce. Michael Nathan and Sandy Smith
. were all well-educated, caring, dedicated and
courageous people, not hating and selfish, who
had long worked as union organizers of North Car
olina's textile and hospital workers. I have
worked to organize communities in the South. I
know that in union organizing in "right to work"
states, dedication is a must.
All five CWP members were shot in the head or
heart that day in Greensboro. Media people were
there to film the incident but the police were mys
teriously absent. I've seen the video tapes of the
incident several times and the Klansmen's facial
expressions were those of good ol' boys at a turkey
shoot. They didn't appear worried in the least
about return fire from the police or demonstrat
ors. And when Willenburg says the CWP was "less
well-armed" that fateful day, he delivers a mis
nomer. The CWP had only one .38 revolver (car
ried by Bill Sampson only because his life had
been threatened several times before). Their poli
cy was that no firearms should be carried at dem
onstrations. On the other hand, the Klan had shot
guns and M-16 rifles.

Where the police were that November day has
never been satisfactorily answered. The trial jury
picked was all white and none were questioned
about their attitudes toward race before the trial
began In addition, some of the post-trial com
ments by the jurors reveal a decided slant in their
views toward the Klan's being super patriots act
ing in self-defense while members of the CWP
were subhuman communists, "unworthy of pro
tection by our laws"..
And more questions: Why were only 16 of the 40
Klansmen indicted? Why was that number subse
quently to only six? Why weren't the owners of the
Klan's guns indicted? Why were conspiracy
charges against them dropped? This made it nec
essary to prove who shot whom (difficult when the
buckshot of a shotgun is involved). Why was the
CWP's request for a special prosecutor snubbed?
Why did the prosecution fail to subpoena two gov
ernment agents (Bernard Butkovich of the Bu
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and Ed
Dawson, a police department informer) for their
role in the murders?

Greensboro. The first was the Nov. 3. 1979
murders; the second was the "blame the victims"
campaign by the state; the third was the federal
and local governments' involvement in the cov
erup of the murders; and the fourth was these out
rageous acquittals." The trial was a farce from
start to finish. Willenburg's contention that the
CWP's failure to testify led to the acquittals
doesn't hold water.
In the last paragraph of his column. Willenburg
states that the CWO must be held accountable for
further bloodshed by the Klan. This is an in
credible statement. Nothing was said about the
need to fight racism in all its forms (in this case
the pathological hating of the Klan). Nothing was
said about the racist upsurge spreading through
out the country (from Miami to Atlanta to Green
sboro to Indianapolis) aided and abetted by seem
ingly "indifferent prosecution and climate of ra
cism and anticommunism emanating from feder
al and regional government". Why Willenburg is
so vindictive toward a tiny Marxist group for not
participating in a farcical trial is incom
prehensible. I would think his energies would be
more usefully spent attacking racism rather than
some its victims.

1 read with incredulity Don Willenburg's col
umn (Daily, Nov. 26) on the recent Greensboro
trial of four Ku Klux Klansmen and two Nazis for
the murder of five Communist Workers Party
members. Willenburg depicts the CWP as a "cold
and ruthless" organization that refused to testify
at the trial in a move guaranteed to lead to the ac
quittal of the racists. With the Klan acquitted, he
reasons, the CWP could go about methodically
cashing in on the outrage pouring forth around the
country to further their own extremist philosophy
of unyielding devotion to Mao and proletarian in
ternationalism. Further, he implies that the "cold
and ruthless" CWP can be thusly blamed for any
future bloodspilling carried out bv the Klan.
Willenburg s proposition seems to be that the
CWP's refusal to testify was strictly a publicity
move which, while focusing attention on the CWP
and its slain leadership, has ultimately given a
green light to racist violence.
I find his logic to be twisted. There is no doubt
that the CWP became strengthened and gained
notoriety' because of the slaughter of their lead
ership on Nov. 3. 1979. That only seems natural,
given that the organization is tightly-knit and
holds a Marxist line. But to state that they refused
