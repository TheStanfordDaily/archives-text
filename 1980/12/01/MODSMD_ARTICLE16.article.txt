## The
						power of a straight society 
### 
He thinks I don't know he's
gay (even though most of his ex
lovers are friends of mine). He
thinks nobody knows. He proba
bly won't admit it to himself.
Yet he prowls the Quad late at
night, searching for a covert
trick; or he hangs around cam
pus bathrooms, hoping to enlist
a partner within; or, some
times, he just follows someone
around. His behavior is irra
tional, perhaps dangerous, cer
tainly pathetic.
Another person stares at boys
often and self-consciously —
and looks rather sad doing so. In
his own mind he knows what's
up. but he. too, thinks the people
around him don't know — and
he's right. Except when he
stares at me: he knows I know.
But he seems no less gloomy for
the insight. And goes on staring.
Whether or not I have particu
lar people in mind doesn't really
matter. On this very campus ex
ists an entire category of people
whose psychologies conform to
the general contours, if not to
the specifics, of my opening de
scriptions.
This group consists of people
so repulsed by their owh sex
uality and so fearful of the (im
agined) social penalties for
freeing themselves that they
squander year£ either doing
nothing or engaging in intense,

covert, impersonal and squalid
encounters of the sort that have
perennially afflicted the Art
Building bathrooms.
Obviously there are a lot of
would-be homosexuals on cam
pus who are pretty screwed up;
obviously it takes a lot of think
ing, some courage, and maybe a
little recklessness to admit that
one is gay and to do something
about it.
But internal obstacles are
only part of the problem. There
are also massive external prob
lems posed by a heterosexual
society that is generally unin
formed, often patronizing, and
sometimes openly hostile
toward gays. In terms of the
world at large, I don't think it
much matters if heterosexuals
disapprove of homosexuals ( or
even vice-versa) because; 1).
most gays are familiar with and
inured to such admonishments;
and 2). more and more straight
people have begun to realize
that it's nobody's business who
sleeps with whom.
In a college environment,
however, filled with young peo
ple just beginning to discover
the horrible tangles and intrac
table miseries of adult life,
straight society is far more able
( and, alas, far more likely) to

inflict profound and lasting
damage on embryonic gays.
I'm thinking less of fag jokes
and the like than the more subtle
forms of intolerance; a de
terminedly blissful ignorance of
the fact that 10 percent of Amer
ican men are homosexual; an
unwillingness to acknowledge
the possibility, even the like
lihood. that one or more of ones
friends is gay; and a passive but
obstinate refusal to think about
the issue in general and to make
the undeniably difficult effort to
accept it. to say "Yeah, I guess
it doesn't bother me."
Slogging through college is
enough of a challenge even if
one likes the opposite sex; it's
vastly more difficult if one
doesn't. Virtually every social
activity here — every escape
from academic drudgery — is a
mechanism designed to bring
straight boys into contact with
straight girls.
Campus life assumes that
people are straight and makes
no allowances for variety. Since
most people are straight, there
is a certain logic to it; but on the
other hand, for a lost and lonely
closet case, Stanford social life
is either a thundering bore or an
outright depressant.
Where, then, does one turn?

Gay organizations on campus?
RAs? Friends? All are possi
bilities, but none are an auto
matic solution. The sorry fact is
that a large number of people
don't know or aren't sure what
to do and, thus wind up like one
of my examples.
I'm not petitioning for toler
ance: one tolerates high noise
levels or insurance salesmen or
mediocre food. In other words,
tolerance implies disapproval,
however mild and repressed. I
think it's less important for
straights to tolerate gays that it
is for everyone to realize the es
sential human-ness of the whole
matter.
Gays are regular people and
(in the cliche of the moment)
are everywhere. Everyone
knows one. whether he or she is
aware of it or not. It seems to
me that if straight people (espe
cially men) would consider for a
moment what it would be like to
be gay, how it would change
one's life, bearing in mind the
realization that such has been
(or will be) the experience of a
close friend, it would help clear
away much of the unfortunate
ignorance our culture has be
queathed us.
