## Progressive perspectives are necessary 
### 
Reactionary conservatism is
spewing forth from Hoover
Tower, leaving the taste of
poison lingering behind as it
crosses the country on its way to
Washington, D.C. Many stu
dents and faculty are scamper
ing for cover as the threatening
cloud hovers overhead. Now
more than ever, a progressive
alliance needs to gather togeth
er to defend hard-won programs
such as affirmative action, so
cial security, bilingual educa
tion, women's freedom of
choice, civil rights, and more.
Looking around us here at
Stanford, we may notice that we
are lacking educators who can
offer a progressive perspective
and serve as role models in our
quest for a better America and a
better world.
To be sure, we have a handful
of progressive professors — ov
erworked, stretched to their
limits. We need greater repre

sentation of minorities,
feminists, and radical thinkers
if we are to positively address
the problems and challenges
that face this nation.
"But how?" you ask. How can
we bring a Daniel Ellsberg, an
Angela Davis, a Dennis Banks,
or a Charlotte Bunch to the Stan
ford campus? The answer is the
ASSU Guest Professorship
Board, founded in an attempt to
bring Vietnamese political pris
oner Ngyuen Hu Thai, a dissi
dent journalist, out of Vietnam
to America. The hope was that if
Ngyuen Hu Thai had a solid job
offer from a university such as
Stanford he would be allowed to
leave his country. He was not.
In 1976, the Guest Pro
fessorship Board reached out to
Ernest Mandel. a Belgian Marx
ist newspaper editor. The board
hoped to introduce a greater va
riety of perspectives into the
Stanford educational ex
perience. Mandel's visa was de
nied by the United States State
Department on the basis of
"known communist beliefs."
In the past five years, the
Guest Professorship Board has
successfully brought Ellsberg.

Davis, and Banks to campus.
Along with others, feminist
Charlotte Bunch, founder of
Quest magazine is on the list of
possible professors this year.
Guest Professors lecture at
Stanford for one quarter, usual
ly teaching a three-unit lecture
course and a five-unit seminar.
Here is a chance for students to
get to know a fascinating leader
personally, to be in contact with
not only an educator but a politi
cian, journalist, or scientist who
is in the midst of his or her ca
reer. The progressive guest pro
fessor can offer insight not often
found in the classroom as to
what goes on in the "real
world."
In the past, guest professors
have brought a fresh per
spective to campus, stirring up
a little controversy and provid
ing'a teachable moment.
The fight to get ASSU Senate
approval to bring Native Ameri
can activist Banks to campus
highlighted the need for more
consideration of his and other
progressive views. As Maria
Chacon, Co-director of SCIRE,
said in a 1979 Daily opinions let
ter. "I find unpardonable the at

titudes of ASSU Senate mem
bers who presume to pass
judgment on the ability of Den
nis Banks to teach a course on
Native American political af
fairs. The very ignorance of the
presiding judges is eloquent tes
timony to the need for such
courses on this campus."
Banks was a highly successful
guest professor, as was econo
mist Joan Kobinson in 1969,
Chilean computer scientist
Fernando Flores, and feminist
Lee Novik in 1978.
In the upcoming months,
there will be many progressives
looking for a forum from which
to express their views and in
spire action. It is our job as stu
dents to identify those who are
truly progressive — and to offer
guest professorships to those in
dividuals who will be most ef
fective in leading us on the dif
ficult road toward a better
world.
