## University chemists make new discovery 
### Fred Wainwright 
A team of Stanford chemists recent
ly developed a new chemical process
that may lead to significant savings
for pharmaceutical companies and
may also have ramifications in other
scientific fields.
The co-inventors of the process,
Chemistry Prof. Barry Sharpless and
Tsutomu Katsuki, a post-dcotoral fel
low, have worked on the process for
several years, both at Stanford and at
the Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. Last January they developed a
new method to conduct their research
at Stanford.
This led to the successful comple
tion of the research, and shortly there
after Sharpless and Katsuki published
their findings in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society.
When pharmaceutical companies
use the processes that are in current
usage to make certain medicines that
react with the protein-building
molecules of the body, only half of the
final product can be used. The other
half of the product has to be discarded
because it might cause different reac

tions than those needed to treat the pa
tient.
This is due. in theory, to the "one
sided" nature of all molecules in the
body. Under current processes, when
scientists try to manufacture these
molecules outside the body, only half
of the molecules produced are exactly
the same as those in the body.
The other half are mirror images of
the original molecules, in the same
sense that the left hand is a mirror im
age of the right hand. Since these
molecules are only mirror images and
not exact replicas, they cannot be used
by the companies that manufacture
them, and must be discarded.
The process pioneered by Sharpless
and Katsuki results in molecules
which are all exact copies of the
molecules in the body. Thus, in theory,
only half as many processes will be re
quired to produce the same amount of
medicine.
According to Chemistry Prof.
Harry Mosher, the process caused a
significant stir among pharma
ceutical companies when it was first
publicized. However, he said, "the

process is a basic discovery which can
also be applied to biologically active
materials such as vitamins and
hormones, and natural products such
as fertilizer."
Mosher added. "It will take com
panies several years to fully realize
the advantages of this process." He
predicted the demand for usage of the
process will be high.
A U.S. patent for the process was
filed in early August, according to Bill
Osborne of the University's Office of
Technical Licensing. This will require
companies that use the process to pay

royalties to the University for a period
of 17 years, after which the process
will become public.
Osborne said Stanford will file for
an international patent within a year
of receiving the U.S. patent on the
process.
Mosher stressed that the research
on the process was not undertaken
with the possible financial benefits in
mind. "The teachers and students are
involved in scientific research which
may or may not become economically
feasible (for the University),"
Mosher said.
