Closed quarters
1 have often read these pages
and shaken my head at those
who must find fault with every
activity on campus. In this in
stance, however, I am com
pelled to air my views.
I feel that the Day of Fasting
was a good way to drive home
the effects of hunger on the less
prosperous citizens of this world
to our upper middle class com
munity.
At the same time, it is un
fortunate that the over-zealous
members of my residence de
cided to lock our otherwise open
kitchen, thereby depriving me
of my right not to participate.
When I stated my preference
not to fast, 1 was faced with
moralizing lamentations about
Third World hunger and student
apathy.
I am not questioning the va
lidity of Oxfam's cause or the
value of a fast. I would only like
to point out that if participation
is to be mandatory, it should be
labelled as such. If. on the other
hand, it is to be voluntary, then
the need for a locked kitchen is
obviated.
People seem to feel that such
impositions are perfectly justi
fied if they have a "cause" to
back them up. Of this, Stanford
students are guilty as charged.
Witness White Plaza most days.
In conclusion, I would like to
address myself to the people
(not necessarily in my house),
who chastise those who are
honest in saying they won't fast
— 10 minutes before they head
for Tresidder, Jack-in-the-Box.
or anywhere else where a snack
can be obtained.
My dictionary says that to
fast is "to abstain from food."
What about yours?

Accept propaganda
I suppose the cool response to
Radwan Shaban's article on Is
rael (Daily, Nov. 24) would be to
passively accept another propa
ganda blast. Emboldened by the
success of previous distortions,
secure in their riches and in
creasing power, confident of the
short memory of the world for
historical fact, the Arabs push
their efforts to win the hearts
and minds of American students

by describing the Arab-Israeli
conflict in terms of "minority
suppression" and "racism"
(that's what Zionism is, isn't
it?).
With every new freshman
class one wonders how many
students remember that when
the UN partitioned Israel and
Palestine in 1948 the combined
armies of Egypt. Syria. Jordan
and the Palestinians attacked
the Israeli territories with the
avowed purpose of driving the
Jews into the sea. The Israelis,
having no place to go and many
of them having suffered the hor
rors of Hitler's Europe, man
aged to resist the onslaught and
survive. So did the Palestinians.
There are 140 million Arabs in
surrounding countries that the
Palestinians joined — though
none of the brotherly nations
would give a Palestinian
citizenship except Jordan (and

Israel). The Israelis managed to
repulse the Arabs again in 1956,
1967 and 1973. They can't afford
to lose. To live in a garrison
state, raising your children with
an eye constantly on the sur
rounding enemies is very dif
ficult, but it is preferable to
death, concentration camps or
to the fate of the Jews who re
main imprisoned in Arab coun
tries such as Syria and Iraq.
The problem of the Palesti
nian need for self-determination
will be resolved some day. But
the Israelis refuse to commit
national and personal suicide to
bring about that event. Mean
while, the struggle goes on — in
the UN, on the West Bank, in the
councils of OPEC, and on the
opinion forming pages of the
world press.
