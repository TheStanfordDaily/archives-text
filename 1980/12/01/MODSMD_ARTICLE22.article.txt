## Bush seeks active role as vice president 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — George Bush
has a great new title, but it is up
to Ronald Reagan to decide just
how active Bush will be as vice
president of the United States.
By law, Bush will preside
over the Senate, where few vice
presidents have ever spent
much time, and he will sit on the
National Security Council. But
as Bush acknowledged during
the election campaign, his real
influence will depend on how
much confidence that Presi
dent-elect Reagan has in him.
As the two former rivals for
the Republican presidential
nomination have become better
acquainted, signs are looking up
for an active Bush vice-presi
dency. Not only has Bush's cam
paign manager and longtime
friend, James Baker, been
named Reagan's chief of staff,
but Reagan has agreed to give
Bush an office in the White
House.
"Proximity is everything,"
said Richard Moe, chief of staff
for Vice President Walter Mon
dale. Moe is helping Bush and
his new chief of staff, Adm.
Daniel Murphy, with the transi
tion.
"A vice president's role de
pends almost exclusively on
what the president wants it to
be," Moe said. "We were for
tunate because President (Jim
my) Carter was determined
from the outset to make the vice

presidency something it had
never been before."
Unprecedented role
Although Mondale has re
mained out of the limelight, the
traditional fate of every vice
president, he has had an un
precedented role. Mondale has
his office in the White House,
near the president's Oval Of
fice, along with a standing in
vitation to every meeting that
the president attended, weekly
private lunches with Carter,
and complete access to his se
curity information.
If Bush is given the same ac
cess to the president, he could
have an influential job. But
whether Carter actually took
advice that Mondale gave — and
whether Reagan will take any
from Bush — is another ques
tion.
Reagan has not yet indicated
to Bush or Murphy whether hi
will give Bush, a former CIA di
rector. entree to Reagan's se
curity briefings, meetings and
schedule.
Unexpected offer
"It is early," said Murphy in
an interview at Bush's tem
porary office, a Victorian
townhouse across from the
White House. "We would like to
contribute to the president in a
similar way (as Mondale
did) . . . to be of most help to
President Reagan, on a broad
scope of issues, it would be help
ful to have broad access to the

president himself."
But Bush and Murphy hardly
are pushing for such access.
Bush is still enormously grate
ful to have any role at all after
believing, up until Reagan
called him on the telephone to
offer him the job, that former
President Gerald Ford would be
Reagan's running mate.
Bush was among the "kitchen
cabinet" advisers who visited
the Reagans in California after
the election to discuss Cabinet
appointments, while Murphy
found in Washington that he had
been "accepted with open arms
by Reagan's people, even
though they didn't know me
from a hole in the wall."
Washington insider
Like Mondale. Bush was
selected as a Washington in
sider by a presidential con

tender who had been governor of
a state but had no Washington
experience. Bush, the well-bred
son of a Connecticut senator,
has extensive ties to the Eastern
establishment, as well as ex
perience as a member of Con
gress from Texas. CIA director,
United Nations ambassador, en
voy to Beijing, and chairman of
the Republican Party.
Bush's appointment of
Murphy, a four-star admiral
who worked with Bush at the
CIA and was most recently dep
uty undersecretary of defense in
the Carter administration, has
been viewed as particularly apt.
For one thing. Murphy, a relax
ed Irishman who knows his way
around the intelligence com
munity. is a veteran of the capi
tal's political in-fighting.
Murphy said that under Sec

retary of Defense Harold
Brown, his first job was "really
to make sure his (Brown's) au
thority and responsibilities
were not abrogated" during the
government reorganization that
Carter attempted midway
through his term

Murphy also served as deputy
to Melvin Laird and Elliot Rich
ardson when they each held the
top Pentagon post during the
Nixon Administration He com
manded the 6th fleet during the
1973 Arab-Israel war and the
Cyprus crisis of 1974
As for the future. Murphy said
"my job will be looking up to
President Reagan's staff, being
sure our contribution is one
that's desired, and looking down
to our own staff and seeing that
it's running smoothly."

what the president wants it to
be," Moe said. "We were for
tunate because President (Jim
my) Carter was determined
from the outset to make the vice

presidency something it had
never been before."
Unprecedented role
Although Mondale has re
mained out of the limelight, the
traditional fate of every vice
president, he has had an un
precedented role. Mondale has
his office in the White House,
near the president's Oval Of
fice, along with a standing in
vitation to every meeting that
the president attended, weekly
private lunches with Carter,
and complete access to his se
curity information.
If Bush is given the same ac
cess to the president, he could
have an influential job. But
whether Carter actually took
advice that Mondale gave — and
whether Reagan will take any
from Bush — is another ques
tion.
Reagan has not yet indicated
to Bush or Murphy whether hi
will give Bush, a former CIA di
rector. entree to Reagan's se
curity briefings, meetings and
schedule.
Unexpected offer
"It is early," said Murphy in
an interview at Bush's tem
porary office, a Victorian
townhouse across from the
White House. "We would like to
contribute to the president in a
similar way (as Mondale
did) . . . to be of most help to
President Reagan, on a broad
scope of issues, it would be help
ful to have broad access to the

president himself."
But Bush and Murphy hardly
are pushing for such access.
Bush is still enormously grate
ful to have any role at all after
believing, up until Reagan
called him on the telephone to
offer him the job, that former
President Gerald Ford would be
Reagan's running mate.
Bush was among the "kitchen
cabinet" advisers who visited
the Reagans in California after
the election to discuss Cabinet
appointments, while Murphy
found in Washington that he had
been "accepted with open arms
by Reagan's people, even
though they didn't know me
from a hole in the wall."
Washington insider
Like Mondale. Bush was
selected as a Washington in
sider by a presidential con

tender who had been governor of
a state but had no Washington
experience. Bush, the well-bred
son of a Connecticut senator,
has extensive ties to the Eastern
establishment, as well as ex
perience as a member of Con
gress from Texas. CIA director,
United Nations ambassador, en
voy to Beijing, and chairman of
the Republican Party.
Bush's appointment of
Murphy, a four-star admiral
who worked with Bush at the
CIA and was most recently dep
uty undersecretary of defense in
the Carter administration, has
been viewed as particularly apt.
For one thing. Murphy, a relax
ed Irishman who knows his way
around the intelligence com
munity. is a veteran of the capi
tal's political in-fighting.
Murphy said that under Sec

retary of Defense Harold
Brown, his first job was "really
to make sure his (Brown's) au
thority and responsibilities
were not abrogated" during the
government reorganization that
Carter attempted midway
through his term

George Bush, the vice president-elect, hopes that Ronald Reagan
will allow him an active role in the new administration. Vice presi
dent Walter Mondale was given wide responsibilities by President
Jimmy Carter, and Bush hopes to follow in that tradition.
Washington — George Bush
has a great new title, but it is up
to Ronald Reagan to decide just
how active Bush will be as vice
president of the United States.
By law, Bush will preside
over the Senate, where few vice
presidents have ever spent
much time, and he will sit on the
National Security Council. But
as Bush acknowledged during
the election campaign, his real
influence will depend on how
much confidence that Presi
dent-elect Reagan has in him.
As the two former rivals for
the Republican presidential
nomination have become better
acquainted, signs are looking up
for an active Bush vice-presi
dency. Not only has Bush's cam
paign manager and longtime
friend, James Baker, been
named Reagan's chief of staff,
but Reagan has agreed to give
Bush an office in the White
House.
"Proximity is everything,"
said Richard Moe, chief of staff
for Vice President Walter Mon
dale. Moe is helping Bush and
his new chief of staff, Adm.
Daniel Murphy, with the transi
tion.
"A vice president's role de
pends almost exclusively on
what the president wants it to
be," Moe said. "We were for
