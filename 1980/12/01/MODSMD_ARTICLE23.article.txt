# Conservative Demos flex political muscle
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — One day last week. House
Speaker Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.),
welcomed to his office on Capitol Hill a
large group of his fellow Democrats, many
of them relatively junior members of the
House. The visitors wanted to talk to O'Neill
about the coming 97th Congress and their
hopes for a larger role in the Democratic
leadership.
O'Neill's visitors were all conservative
Democrats, most of them from the South
and Southwest. In the wake of the Re
publican election victories, they have cor
rectly sensed that they have a new im
portance, organized themselves to exploit it
and begun to flex some newfound political
muscle. In granting them an audience,
O'Neill, an old style liberal never known for
solicitude toward his conservative Demo
cratic colleagues, was simply beginning to
accommodate himself to a new political re
ality — on Nov. 4 the Democrats not only
lost the White House and control of the Sen
ate. they also lost all but a paper majority in
the House.
What this will mean in specific programs
and pieces of legislation is impossible to
say. But this much is already clear: not only
in the GOP-controlled Senate but in the
House as well, Reagan will find working
majorities willing to back his desire to in
crease defense spending while attempting
to move toward a balanced budget by cut
ting domestic programs. Conservative
Democrats hold the key votes.
In the last Congress, the Democrats en
joyed an almost 2-to-l majority and, assum
ing Republican solidarity, it took some 60
defections from Democratic ranks to defeat
the leadership. The number of defections,
according to House officials, ranged be
tween 30 to 50 votes depending on the issue,

meaning that in most cases O'Neill and the
other Democratic leaders could deliver.
But in the new Congress it will take only
26 defections for the Democrats to lose their
majority, again assuming Republican soli
darity. And within the nominal Democratic
majority that exists on paper, there are
more than 26 Democrats like Texan Charles
Stenholm of Abilene, a conservative budget
cutter who sees eye to eye with the Re
publicans on many issues.
Stenholm. the head of the Conservative
Forum, said the group now has 34 members
and that he expects it to number more than
40 by the time House Democrats get down to
organizational meetings next month.
Seek leadership roles
Stenholm and his allies have set as their
first objective a larger role for themselves
in the House leadership itself. They have
submitted to O'Neill and Majority Leader
Jim Wright (D-Texas), their nominees for
majority whip, a job for which Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, (D-Ill.), is in line but which
he may pass up in order to assume the chair
of the Ways and Means Committee.
The conservative Democrats are also
pressing O'Neill for more representation on
the Democratic Steering and Policy Com
mittee and the Budget Committee and, to a
lesser extent, the Ways and Means and Ap
propriations committees.
But the Conservative Forum's ambitions
extend beyond organizational matters to
substantive issues on which they may well
hold the balance of power. Stenholm said he
intends to have in place for the new Con
gress his own whip system to hold the Con
servative Forum together on key issues.
"On issues that we feel strongly about, if we
can be the majority or the swing vote, that's
exactly what we want to do." he said.

Beyond a desire to strengthen the mili
tary, cut federal spending and reduce the
role of the federal government in American
life — all general objectives also espoused
by Reagan — it is difficult to pinpoint the is
sues on which the conservative Democrats
will attempt to exert their new influence.
But one clue to their thinking on the budget
may lie in the recommendations of the
Bipartisan Coalition for Fiscal Responsi
bility, a group that included Stenholm; Rep.
PhilGramm, another Texas Democrat; and
other members of the Conservative Forum.
The coalition proposed $26.3 billion in
budget cuts for the fiscal year that began
Oct. 1. The proposed cuts included $2.4
billion from general revenue sharing to the
states, $3.9 billion from CETA public ser
vice jobs, $1.1 billion from food stamps, $2
billion from unemployment benefits, $1
billion from foreign and multilateral aid
and $1.9 billion from various education, so
cial services and antipoverty programs.
On other key votes in the 96th Congress,
members of the Conservative Forum gener
ally favored higher defense spending and
the deregulation of natural gas prices, but
opposed creation of a Consumer Protection
Agency and federal funding for abortions.
Many of them are from farming districts
and are sympathetic to demands for prop
ping up agriculture prices.
What may most distinguish these con
servative Democrats from House Re
publicans, according to one House source, is
their attitude toward tax policy. While they
may go along enthusiastically with Reagan
proposals to slash domestic spending, they
are not as enthusiastic as their GOP col
leagues toward Reagan's support for the
Kemp-Roth tax cut measure, beginning
with a 10 percent tax cut next year.
