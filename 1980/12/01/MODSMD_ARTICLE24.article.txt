# Four fires still burning
## 
### 
San Bernardino (AP)— With four fires dying
and seven others defeated, firefighters filtered
out of Southern California's smoldering timber
and brush yesterday — going home after a battle
fought at what one official said was an
"astronomical" cost.
"It's hard to say just how many firefighters are
still out." said Gene Knight of the U.S. Forest Ser
vice. "But we are definitely demobilizing."
Authorities said the cost of fighting the fires
probably will not be determined until long after
they are extinguished.
But U.S. Forest Service spokesman Bill
Pidanick said, "The cost will be astronomical. My
mind boggles with the figures for crews, heli
copters, contracting of equipment, fuel, food."
More than 750.000 gallons of fire retardant were
dropped for a cost of $457,000 in retardant alone,
he said.
Homeowners wiped out by the firestorms that
charred tens of thousands of acres, destroyed hun
dreds of homes and took four lives decided wheth
er to rebuild or move to less fire-prone regions.
"Usually, people build right in the same place
again, but I just don't know this time," said
Knight.
Foresters worried about after-effects of the
blazes were busy yesterday reseeding blackened
areas in hopes of building up some ground cover to

avert flooding when the overdue winter rains be
gin.
The disastrous week of fires, which began last
Monday, when 100 mph northeasterly Sanfa Ana
winds swept out of mountain canyons and black
ened 140 square miles, destroyed about 320 homes
and cabins, and ruined dozens of cars, trailers and
outbuildings.
At the fires' height, some 7710 firefighters
called in from as far away as New York were bat
tling the blazes — the second siege of brushfires in
the region in two weeks.
Gov. Jerry Brown's office has put the damage
toll since Nov. 15 at at more than $50 million and
over 100.000 acres.
The largest fire still burning — and technically
out of control — was the Indian Fire in a section of
the Cleveland National Forest.
That blaze has blackened 29.000 acres, de
stroyed seven structures and damaged 57 others.
It was 85 percent controlled by early yesterday.
Also burning — but virtually controlled — were
the 12,000-acre Thunder Fire in the Mount Baldy
area, 40 miles northeast of Los Angeles, the 6000-
acre Lockwood Fire in the Los Padres National
Forest in Ventura County and the 2317-acre Proc
tor Fire in the Jamul Mountains of San Diego
