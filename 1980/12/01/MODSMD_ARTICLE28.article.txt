# D.B. Cooper party honors skyjacker
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Ariel, Wash. — Six streamers
i)t colorful pennants were
stretched across the main street
of Ariel, a town not much more
than a wide spot in a dead-end
road
The Ariel Store was gaily
draped with red. white and blue
crepe A band played and the
crowd was in a mood of celebra
tion and anticipation.
It was a hero's welcome, for
sure, but the hero never showed,
as best as anyone could tell
At least if he did he wasn t
telling
It was the tilth annual IJ B.
Cooper Party, and for the fifth
time, the man who parachuted
from a Northwest Airlines 727
on Nov. 24. 1971. with $200,000
ransom tailed to join revelers in
one of the nation's strangest
rites of fall
So Cooper was hailed in
absentia by the ;M)-plus revelers
as "an underdog,'' toasted as
"an original'' and envied as one
who "beat the system."
Hut the question lingered:
Was he here'.'
One likely "suspect," an en
trant in a D. B Cooper look-alike
contest, dropped cryptic claims
to the daring deeds done that
Thanksgiving Kve in 1971.
"D.B. Cooper is a big thing up
here, but when I jumped out of
the plane. 1 didn't even come
down here." said Jim Byrne, a
regular at the Ariel Store and
Tavern and probably the only
man in U.S. history to win a con
test for looking like an FBI
sketch.

He won $25. a T-shirt and. as
one reporter suggested, may
also receive a visit from the
FBI. which apparently was not
here, either
The gathering each year on
the Saturday night after
Thanksgiving is a part of the na
tional fascination with D.B. Co
oper. believed by some to be
America's only successful sky
jacker. a puzzle who tumbled
out of a jetliner on a rainy
Northwest night He has never
been heard from, nor have any
remains been found
It was unclear whether Satur
day night s larger than usual
crowd was swelled by increased
publicity in both Washington
and Oregon or by the discovery
last February of about $4000 in
soggy $20 ransom bills on the
banks of the Columbia Hiver
near Vancouver. Wash.
Only a few of those on hand
would admit, as Carl
Steinwachs. 30. did. that they
would like to think he's alive."
But deep down inside 1 think
he's dead. Steinwachs added.
•"People, they think he's
alive." said Germaine Tricola.
a former owner of the Ariel
Store and Tavern who founded
the annual party in 1976. She re
members the skyjacking that
night in the fall of 1971. a time of
year when not many strangers
walk the backroads around
nearby Lake Merwin on the
Lewis Hiver
And she remembers two
strangers who came in that
night for beer.
