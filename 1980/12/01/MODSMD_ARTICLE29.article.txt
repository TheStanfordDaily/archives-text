The 28-2-1 season was the sec
ond best won-loss mark in Card
history, behind only the 26-1-1

but Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti said of this year's
team, "I've been coaching 15
years and never had a better
group to work with."
It was the fifth time that the
Cards and Bears had confronted
each other this season Pre
viously. Stanford had won two
games. Cal had taken one and

the other was a 5-5 tie
Unlike most Stanford-Cal
matches, the final didn t have a
lot of suspense With three Long
Beach natives on the team —
Jody Campbell. Alan
Mouchawar and Maurice
Mouchawar — the Cards must
have felt right at home, and
played like it They jumped out
to a 3-1 first-quarter lead, and
increased their advantage to 6-2
by halftime.
Cal. which finished 31-4-3, cut
Stanford's lead to 6-3 26 seconds
after the third quarter began
when Bob Diepersloot skimmed
the ball off the water past Stan
ford goalie John Gansel.
But 15 seconds later, Stanford
capitalized on a 6-on-5-man ad
vantage as Chris Kelsey went
high out of the water to fire the
ball past Cal goalie Tim
Mascheroni and make the score
7-3 Cards.
Sophomore James Bergeson

scored Stanford's final goal
with 2 :38 remaining in the peri
od. taking Alan Mouchawar's
pass off a counter-attack
This gave Stanford a decisive
8-3 lead, and though Cal tallied
three goals in the final period.
Dettamanti never doubted that
the Cards would maintain their
cushion
' The only way we were going
to lose then was totally collapse,
and this is too good a team to let
anything like that happen," Det
tamanti said "It was certainly
nice to have that lead "
"The INC A As had been up
permost in everyone's mind."
Alan Mouchawar said. "We'd
been thinking about this meet
for two weeks. It was something
we all wanted in the worst
way."
(iansel, the Cards' three-time
All-America performer and a
cinch to win his fourth this year,
added. "It was a case of being

almost too up I couldn't be
happier."
Kelsev's three goals led Stan
ford. followed by Bergeson's
two. Alan Mouchawar.
Campbell and Steve Smith each
added a single tally. Kevin Rob
ertson led Cal with three goals,
and Diepersloot contributed
two.
The Cards reached the finals
by trouncing Loyola of Chicago,
22-5, in Saturday's first round
and stomping Pepperdine, 17-6,
in that night's semifinals.

Stanford's water polo team
climaxed its superb 1980 season
in the most fitting way possible:
with an NCAA championship
The Cardinals won the national
title yesterday, defeating rival
California. 8-6. at the Belmont
Plaza Pool complex in Long
Beach.'
It was the third time in five
years that Stanford had won the
crown. The Cards also finished
No I in 1976 and 1978.
The 28-2-1 season was the sec
ond best won-loss mark in Card
history, behind only the 26-1-1
ledger posted by the 1978 club,
but Stanford head coach Dante
Dettamanti said of this year's
team, "I've been coaching 15
years and never had a better
group to work with."
It was the fifth time that the
Cards and Bears had confronted
each other this season Pre
viously. Stanford had won two
games. Cal had taken one and

the other was a 5-5 tie
Unlike most Stanford-Cal
matches, the final didn t have a
lot of suspense With three Long
Beach natives on the team —
Jody Campbell. Alan
Mouchawar and Maurice
Mouchawar — the Cards must
have felt right at home, and
played like it They jumped out
to a 3-1 first-quarter lead, and
increased their advantage to 6-2
by halftime.
Cal. which finished 31-4-3, cut
Stanford's lead to 6-3 26 seconds
after the third quarter began
when Bob Diepersloot skimmed
the ball off the water past Stan
ford goalie John Gansel.
But 15 seconds later, Stanford
capitalized on a 6-on-5-man ad
vantage as Chris Kelsey went
high out of the water to fire the
ball past Cal goalie Tim
Mascheroni and make the score
7-3 Cards.
Sophomore James Bergeson

scored Stanford's final goal
with 2 :38 remaining in the peri
od. taking Alan Mouchawar's
pass off a counter-attack
This gave Stanford a decisive
8-3 lead, and though Cal tallied
three goals in the final period.
Dettamanti never doubted that
the Cards would maintain their
cushion
' The only way we were going
to lose then was totally collapse,
and this is too good a team to let
anything like that happen," Det
tamanti said "It was certainly
nice to have that lead "
"The INC A As had been up
permost in everyone's mind."
Alan Mouchawar said. "We'd
been thinking about this meet
for two weeks. It was something
we all wanted in the worst
way."
(iansel, the Cards' three-time
All-America performer and a
cinch to win his fourth this year,
added. "It was a case of being

almost too up I couldn't be
happier."
Kelsev's three goals led Stan
ford. followed by Bergeson's
two. Alan Mouchawar.
Campbell and Steve Smith each
added a single tally. Kevin Rob
ertson led Cal with three goals,
and Diepersloot contributed
two.
The Cards reached the finals
by trouncing Loyola of Chicago,
22-5, in Saturday's first round
and stomping Pepperdine, 17-6,
in that night's semifinals.
Campbell bombed in five
goals against Loyola, and Alan
Mouchawar also had five scores
against Pepperdine.
