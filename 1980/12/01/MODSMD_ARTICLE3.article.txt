# Athletic department's '80-'81 budget projected
## 
### Sherry Norman 
After sustaining a $1,075,000 deficit
for the fiscal year 1979-80. the Athletic
Department has projected a $155,000
deficit for the year 1980-81, according
to department officials.
In addition, the department has
mandated a balanced budget for the
fiscal year 1981-82.
Reserve funds, accumulated during
years when the athletic department
operated at a profit, have been used to
cover deficits in past budgets. The re
serve fund now stands at $850,000.
Stanford's intercollegiate athletic
programs are financially independent
of the University. Appropriations
from tuition fees are used entirely for
physical education purposes.
Factors in '79-80 deficit
Athletic Director Andy Geiger said
the large deficit in 1979-80 developed
due to poor attendance at football
games and the fact that Stanford only
appeared on national television once
during the year.
Ticket receipts and game-related
revenues are the department's prima
ry sources of income to be used for
programs other than physical educa
tion, accounting for 45 percent of its
operating budget funds.
Assistant Athletic Director Doug
Single also said in past years Stanford
has been trying to upgrade its in
tercollegiate programs without mak
ing budgetary adjustments to ac
comodate increased spending
Upgrading women's programs
Under Title IX, the University has
had to provide equal funding for wom
en's sports programs. Single said the
department chose to increase alloca
tions for women's programs rather
than cutting back allocations for
men's sports.
In addition, the department al
located improvement funds for the
grounds surrounding Encina Gym, the
stadium, Angell Field, the Encina ten
nis courts, the weight room and the de

partment building.
Furthermore, in what Gieger called
a highly unusual occurence, personnel
changes were made in seven coaching
staffs last year. This involved signifi
cant transition costs, as existing con
tracts had to be fulfilled and expensive
replacement searches undertaken.
Geiger said as the athletic depart
ment faces escalating costs, specifi
cally in the areas of travel and facil
ities operations, spending will have to
be curtailed. Geiger noted that re
gional travel is already becoming pre
dominant. Today's varsity athlete can
expect to make one cross-country trip
during a college career rather than
one each year.
Strict control of expenses
Single said the department is taking
a more professional approach to ex
pense management, noting the ap
pointment of a new associate director
of business and finance last March. In
Geiger's words, "There is now a more
heightened awareness of fiscal man
agement throughout the depart
ment."
By combining strict expense control
with expanding income opportunities,
Geiger said the department will bal
ance the budget in 1981-82 while main
taining high-quality programs. He em
phasized that all options of tighter fis
cal control and increased revenue
sources will be explored before any
programs will be eliminated.
Fund-raising events, such as the re
cent Big Game Jog-a-Thon, are
charted to become a major new source
of income. Coaches are also being en
couraged to take an entreprenurial ap
proach to raising extra funds for their
programs, according to Alan Cum
mings, associate director of business
and finance for the department.
In addition, said Cummings, other
options are being considered, includ
ing intensified facility usage, summer
youth camps, and increased ticket
prices.
