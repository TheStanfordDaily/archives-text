I The 20-team tournament will
; be divided into four five-team
! pools, with Stanford joining UC
j Santa Barbara, UCLA, Illinois
' and Southwest Missouri in its
pool.
The tournament directors
granted the Cards one of the
four at-large berths due to their
29-16 overall record, their sec
ond-place finish in the NorCal
Conference and solid showing in
the regionals.
In the regionals, Stanford lost
all three of its games but turned

in impressive efforts against
the stronger teams in the na
tion. "We had higher highs and
lower lows," coach Fred Sturm
said.
The Cards opened Friday
against USC, ranked No. 1 in the
nation, and lost 4-15, 10-15, 15-7
and 14-16. In that final game, the
Cards had held a 14-12 lead, and
the second game was tied 9-9 at
one point.
This represented a significant
improvement for Stanford,
which lost to the Trojans 3-15,
4-15 and 3-15 the first time the
two teams met.
In the second round, the Cards
fell to UC-Santa Barbara 10-15
and 7-15.
Sturm theorized that the
Cards suffer matchup problems
against the Gauchos, who fea
ture a quick backcourt and huge
outside blockers.
Stanford then dropped the
match for seventh place against
San Diego State. 11-15, 16-14 and
15-13. As was typical of their
play throughout the tour
nament, the Cards fell behind in

the second game before win
ning. and were tied 13-13 in the
final game before losing.
