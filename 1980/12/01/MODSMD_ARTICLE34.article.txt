# Frosh cagers excite in Stanford opener

### Chris Haft 
Call it youthful exuberance, or beginner's luck, or maybe
just plain talent. Whatever the reason was, Stanford's four
new freshman basketball players provided much of the ex
citement in the Cardinals' 58-52 opening-game victory Satur
day night at Maples Pavilion
Though none of them dominated the action at any point,
Roger Lemons. Keith Jones. Hans Wichary and John Revelli
displayed the abilities that Coach Dick Dißiaso recruited
them for. distinguishing themselves enough to give the feel
ing that they will each positively contribute to the Cards' for
tunes this season
Of the four, the most remarkable debut belonged to
Lemons. The 6-foot-5 guard replaced Terry Smith with 14:21
remaining in the first halt. Nine seconds later Lemons took a
pass from Revelli on the left baseline, moved quickly to the
basket and jammed the ball through over Air Force's Erwin
Washington, causing temporary insanity among the 3105 wit
nesses.
"The defense opened up, and I just took it to the basket,"
Lemons said, wearing a wide, almost embarrassed smile. "I
didn't think it (the dunk) was anything super, but it's a good
way to start off."'
Lemons, who scored seven points in 13 minutes, went hard
to the basket all evening. Such an assertive attitude is rare for
a freshman, but Lemons said, "I've felt comfortable in prac
tice. It's just a matter of relating that practice confidence to
the game."
Jones, also a rookie guard, played just eight minutes. How
ever, it was enough time for the 6-foot-2 flash to unveil his
considerable quickness.
Late in the first half, with Stanford leading 34-19, Jones was
dribbling the ball to the left of the top of the key. With Jones
surrounded by Falcons, his next act should have conceivably
been a pass.
Instead, Jones faked to his right, whirled and surged
toward the hoop, drawing a foul. If the hand is quicker than
the eye. then Jones is quicker than the hand.
"I have more than adequate quickness," Jones admitted.
"I feel I can beat most people in most situations anytime."
By contrast, Wichary, who was most impressive in block
ing two shots, contended that the talent he displayed is not a
regular habit. "Believe me, I'm not a shot-blocker," the 6-
toot-9 forward-center pleaded, grinning hugely.
The San Diego County Player of the Year also grabbed five
rebounds and scored four points.
Revelli, the Cards' other big freshman at 6-foot-7, started
at forward and collected five points and four rebounds. His
most involved moments occurred near the final minute. After
taking an outlet pass — one which he shouldn't have received
to begin with — he fired a pass that went off Orlando Ward's
hands and into a Falcon's grasp.
However, Revelli atoned for his error by rejecting Wash
ington's layup attempt. "Revelli's block was particularly
good because he had just made a mistake," Dißiaso said.
• After the trials of recent seasons, Stanford surely hopes
that this resiliencv can be reflected in increased success.
