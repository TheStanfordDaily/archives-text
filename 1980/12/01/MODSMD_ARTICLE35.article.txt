# Cards win, 58-52, despite second half
## 
### Chris Haft 
Nearly everything deserted
Stanford during the second half
of its men s basketball season
opener Saturday night, except
for the element that counted
most — its lead
After executing their offense
adequately and playing defense
determinedly in the first half,
the Cardinals usually ceased to
perform these tasks after in
termission, but still held on for a
58-52 triumph over Air Force at
Maples Pavilion.
The heroics of two Card
freshmen served as exciting
bookends for the victory Roger
Lemons' first college basket, an
electrifying slam-dunk over Air
Force's Frwin Washington with
14:12 left in the first half, and
John Revelli's block of Wash
ington's attempted layup with
just less than a minute remain
ing and Stanford leading only
56-50.
To complement the young
sters' efforts, juniors Doug
Marty. Brian Welch and Orlan
do Ward combined for 33 points
and refrained from committing
egregious mistakes.
Yet Stanford's performance
in the second half, when teams
often need solid execution the
most, was hardly characteristic
of a winner. Leading by 16 points
at halftime — and even by 18
shortly before intermission —
the Cards played most of the
final '20 minutes as if they were
an arm's length removed from
the action.
The Falcons capitalized by
nearly removing Stanford from
the lead, twice closing to within
four points before time ran out.
"There were a lot of occa
sions where players were spec
tators." Stanford coach Dick
Dißiaso said.
Stanford's second-half disem
bodiment showed in its lack of
an offensive pattern. At times
the Cards dribbled everyplace
and cut everywhere, but it was
jumbled, random movement,
like popcorn popping.
To a degree, the Falcons' in

tensified defense forced Stan
ford out of its offense. "We have
to work on running the offense
under pressure, said Marty,
the Cards" main ballhandler
"When you have a 16-point lead
you noed to run your kind of of
fense.'
Also, the Cards own defense
gave them difficulty. Flaying
mostly man-to-man. Stanford
grounded the Falcons in the first
half, causing them to shoot a
weak eight-for-22 from the field
But in the second half, either
the Falcons maneuvered around
Stanford players for layins or
beat the Cards to the boards for
offensive rebounds and second
shots.
"They took us out of our of
fense. but a bigger problem was
our defense," Marty stated.
"We let them enter too easily."
These transgressions man
ifested themselves glaringly
during one five-minute period.
Stanford led 48-38 with just
over nine minutes left when the
Falcons' Tim Harris, the
game's high scorer with 21
points, missed a jumper The re
bound came to Air Force's Jeff
Eberhard. who also missed his
shot. But again Stanford
couldn't get the rebound, as
Harris grabbed Eberhard's
miss, drew a foul from Jeff
Hyan and hit two free throws,
slicing the margin to 48-40.
With 6:25 left. Harris again
reached close quarters, scoring
on a layin to cut Stanford's lead
to 50-44. Marty's soft 10-footer
made it 52-44. but Marc Duncan
followed in a Harris miss and
Rick Simmons squirmed under
neath for a layin with 4:36 to go
to put Air Force within 52-48.
Fortunately for the Cards,
their early advantage fortified
them throughout Air Force's
seige and their own collapse.
The Cards converted Air
Force's 22 first-half fouls into 24
points from the free-throw line
that directly contributed to
their 40-24 halftime cushion.
Yet Dißiaso felt that Air
Force's physical overzealous

ness. though it helped the Cards
in the tirst half, hampered them
in the second by disrupting their
offensive continuity.
"Air Force was very physi
cal, as evidenced by the number
of free throws we shot in the
first half, and I don't think we
ever fully recovered from
that," Dißiaso said. "That's not
to make an excuse for our sec
ond-half offense, but they took
us out ot our offense with all the

bumping and fouling.'
Nevertheless, Air Force's
fouling lias the Cards' offense,
at least in terms of points. Hold
ing a tenuous 16-14 lead midway
in the first half. Stanford out
scored the Falcons 18-2 over a
six-minute, 49-second stretch,
12 of the points resulting from
free throws.
Two Marty charity tosses
with 9:51 left extended the
Cards' lead to 18-14 and began

their streak. The difference
grew to 21-14 on Revelli's single
free throw and Terry Smith's
pair.
Smith ended the Cards' as
sault by stealing Bob Sallis
guard-to-guard pass, cranking
in a lavup over Sallis with 3:02
left — while traveling at full
speed and being fouled — and
sinking the ensuing free throw
to give Stanford a 34-16 lead.
