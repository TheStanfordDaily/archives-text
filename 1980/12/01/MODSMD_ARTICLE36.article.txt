Quakes leave victims shelterless
Naples, Italy — Two earth tremors yesterday
jolted quake-stricken southern Italy where snow and
subfreezing temperatures added to the misery of
thousands seeking shelter at the distant homes of
friends or in government-provided hotel rooms.
The first shock, at about 3a.m.. damaged aclinic
in Potenza, forcing the evacuation of patients being
treated for injuries from last Sunday's first quake,
which killed more than 3000 people.
The second and stronger jolt came just before 9
a.m. Authorities said the aftershocks, among the
strongest of nearly a hundred that have rumbled
through the area with generally diminishing intensi
ty. caused no deaths. But 62-year-old Guiseppe
Fiorino died of a heart attack, officials said, after he
rushed from his shaking house, saving two children,
at Madonna del Arco near Naples.
The military command's latest casualty figures
showed 2915 people dead, 1547 missing and 7079 in
jured.
Snow, sleet and temperatures down to 23 degrees
prevailed through the night. The survivors endured
cold, wind and rains last week during more mod
erate temperatures that left them in ankle-deep
mud.
Ahead of most of them was the decision of wheth
er to become an earthquake refugee or remain in the
tent camps set up on soccer fields and other open
spaces in the stricken communities.
Cabinet picks possible this week
Palm Springs — Ronald Reagan has decided on
his choices for several positions in his Cabinet,
Edwin Meese 111. the president-elect's top aide, said
yesterday.
"He has made definite decisions and he's in the
process of implementing them now," Meese said on
ABC's Issues and Answers.
Meese said the first Cabinet selections will be
made public either at the end of this week or during
the following week, when Reagan is scheduled to be
in Washington.
He added that he expects the full Cabinet to be
named before Christmas, and he reiterated that
neither William Simon nor George Shultz had been
offered a Cabinet post before the two took them
selves out of the running last week. Their actions
have not affected Reagan's timing or decisions in
choosing his Cabinet, Meese said. Former am
bassador Anne Armstrong, a campaign and transi
tion adviser to Reagan, also has said she does not
want to be considered for an administration job.
Meese. who will hold Cabinet rank in Reagan's ad
ministration and will also coordinate foreign and
domestic policy within the White House as Reagan's
White House counsel, took exception to the way
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt de
scribed the brief meeting Schmidt had with Reagan
in Washington 10 days ago.
The German leader told the West German Bun
destag last week that the two men were in full agree
ment on questions of East-West relations and arms
control.
Meese said, however, that Schmidt did the talking
during their meeting while "the president-elect pri
marily listened."
Jordan discusses black problems
Washington — National Urban League president
Vernon Jordan yesterday rejected the notion that
there is a national conspiracy of violence against
blacks, but he said blacks do have a perception that
they are targets.
Appearing on CBS' Face the Nation, Jordan said
that the highly publicized killings of blacks in sever
al U.S. cities are a continuation of historical treat
ment of blacks. "We're no strangers to violence," he
said.
Jordan called such violence cyclical, taking place
when the national atmosphere "lends itself."
However, he added. "I do not believe, as some of

mv colleagues seem to think, that there is a national
conspiracy based on Atlanta and Buffalo or on my
own situation ."
Jordan was struck down by sniper fire in Fort
Wayne. Ind.. last May Other blacks have been killed
— some in brutal fashion — in Buffalo. Cincinnti and
Youngstown. Ohio. Portland. Ore., and Salt Lake
City. In Atlanta at least 11 black children have been
found murdered in the last year and a half.
Those unsolved killings and increased Ku Klux
Klan activity have led many blacks, including the
Rev Jesse Jackson, leader of Operation PUSH, to
assert that the killings are linked
Jordan said yesterday he saw no evidence for such
linkage, but acknowledged that the violence does
"create a meaningful and real perception (in) black
people that they are targets."
The Urban League leader said he hoped the coun
try's "conservative drift" would not encourage vio
lence,
As to whether that same drift, which includes the
election of Ronald Reagan and several conservative
senators, will erode blacks' civil rights gains. Jor
dan said there is a "congressional temperament to
do so," but also a "national understanding" that it
shouldn't be done.
Reagan's press secretary leaves
Palm Springs — Lyn Nofziger took leave of
Ronald Reagan yesterday after having been the
president-elect's press secretary for the better part
of 14 years.
The stage direction read: "Exit laughing — and
loyal."
The departure of Nofziger, an always dishevelled,
constantly wise-cracking, beer-bellied man who has
been most frequently photographed stepping in
front of Reagan, waving his hands to cut off further
questions, leaves the Reagan transition without a
press spokesman who has access to the president
elect.
Nofziger told Reagan before Election Day that he
did not want to go to Washington as White House
press secretary and agreed to work until yesterday
before hanging out his shingle in Los Angeles as a po
litical consultant. He said he has not been asked for
advice about how White House press operations
should be organized.
"I don't think you can do the job of press secretary
unless you have access to the president," Nofziger
told reporters in a farewell conversation here.
Was he surprised not to have been asked for ad
vice?
"I'm never surprised by anything in this organiza
tion," he replied, slouching deep in an armchair in
his hotel suite.
Iran, Iraq claim naval victory
Beirut, Lebanon — Iran said its forces took Iraq's
Mina al-Bakr oil port yesterday in the biggest sea
battle of the Persian Gulf war, but Iraq denied the
Iranian victory and said it.repulsed the attack.
Iran said its marine forces overran the giant Iraqi
oil shipping port at the northwestern edge of the gulf
and hoisted the red, white and green-striped flag of
the Islamic Republic of Iran "at the highest point"
of a derrick at the facility.
Iraq said the Iranians were repulsed with a loss of
three of their U.S.-made Phantom fighter-bombers
and three warships in the 10-week-old war's heaviest
sea clash.
Iran, also calling it the heaviest sea battle in the
war. said the Iranian navy sank four Iraqi missile
boats and seven other gunboats.
Iran said only one of its boats had heavy damage
in the two-day battle. It began Friday as Iran raided
Mina al-Bakr and the port of Fao at the mouth of the
Shatt al-Arab waterway. Tehran radio said.
Fao, Iraq's main Persian Gulf terminal, is thesite
of pumping stations that push crude oil to Iraq's ter
minals at Mina al-Bakr and Khor al-Amaya, 12 miles
south of Fao and due east of Kuwait. The two deep

water terminals, with a combined capacity of 2.8
million barrels daily, have not been in operation
since the early days of the war.
Congress to wrap up session
Washington - The 96th Congress will spend its
final week concentrating on money bills and a pro
posed "superfund" to clean up toxic wastes. Lame
duck legislators may also make last-ditch pleas for
pet projects before the new, more conservative 97th
Congress begins in January
The year-long battle over the so-called superfund
could resume as early as today in the House with de
bate on a trimmed version of the bill passed by the
Senate last week
Supporters are expected to try to gain approval
for the Senate version, rather than accept amend
ments that could sink the entire package, under a
special parliamentary rule that would bar con
gressmen from offering amendments.
The Senate bill would create a $16 billion fund
over five years to clean up active and inactive
chemical waste dumps and toxic spills. Nearly 90
percent of the money would come from new taxes on
the chemical industry.
The measure compares with the broader $4.2
billion fund originally proposed by the Senate En
vironment and Public Works Committee and a $1.95
billion package the House passed earlier this year.
Congress also will be working to complete action
on appropriations bills to provide operating funds
for various federal departments and agencies. Only
a handful of the necessary bills for fiscal 1981, which
began Oct. 1, have been passed; most of the govern
ment is operating under a stopgap funding measure
that expires Dec. 15.
Justice suit may force S.C. busing
Washington — The Justice Department is con
sidering a plan to file a lawsuit to force the busing of
students and thus end the segregation of public
schools in Charleston. S C.
Sources said the plan to sue the Charleston schools
is on the desk of Associate Attorney General John
Shenefield. who must then pass it on to Attorney
General Benjamin Civiletti for final approval.
Sources said the plan has already been approved by
the head of the civil rights division. Drew Days, who
refused to confirm or deny that the plan exists.
"We have several cases that have beeo under in
vestigation for some months and may well reach the
point before the end of this administration where
there's no alternative but to file them." Days said.
"We've never taken the position in this adminis
tration that when a case was ready to go that we
were going to hold it up."
Sources said an investigation of the public school
system in Charleston has been under way since
March 1979. when civil rights leaders pointed out to
the Justice Department that there were as few as
five white students in all but one of the public
elementary schools in Charleston. The black student
enrollment in the same schools is almost 8000.
"What we have in metropolitan Charleston is a
segregated school system." one source said. "The
white students are all in the suburban school dis
tricts. the blacks are all in the city schools."
Sources said one reason a decision has not been
made in Justice to sue Charleston is the uncertainty
over what would happen once the Reagan adminis
tration takes over.
