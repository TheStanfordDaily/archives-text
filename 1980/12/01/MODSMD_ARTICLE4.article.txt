# Poland warned of intervention

### Washington Post 
Moscow — The Soviet Union im
plicitly warned yesterday of Warsaw-
Pact intervention if Communist Po
land's independent trade union move
ment leads to a "counter-revolution"
inspired by Western "imperialists."
The barely veiled threat surfaced in
authoritative central newspapers,
which published an account of an arti
cle from the Prague Communist Party
paper Rude I*ravo comparing Po
land's present "difficult crisis situ
ation" with pre-invasion Czechoslo
vakia in 1968.
Direct Soviet statements so far on
the Polish crisis have been scarce
since the crisis erupted last August,
giving added weight to the selection of
the hard-line Czech article. According
to the Tass press agency. Rude Pravo
stressed that "internal and external
hostile forces" are seeking to turn Po
land's political and economic turmoil
into a "counterrevolution in one of the
socialist states. (They) concentrate
efforts on an insidious plan — to set in
motion and strengthen anti-socialist
aggressive trade unionism."
However, the Soviet account of the

Prague article said. Polish com
munists have marked out "a clearcut
line which cannot be overstepped - ' by
these opponents, or "socialist, patri
otic forces of Poland will do every
thing vitally necessary to protect and
strengthen the revolutionary gains"
made under the communists.
Czechoslovakia invasion
The warning closely resembled
Kremlin formulations to justify the
Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslo
vakia. when Moscow unleashed its
forces allegedly at the official request
of "patriots" in the Czech party who
accused Alexander Dubcek of trying
to take the country out of the socialist
camp.
Yesterday's Soviet version of the
Czech article asserted that "the hope
of aggressive circles of imperialism to
change the situation in the world in
their favor, to restore lost positions
through a policy of strength and black
mail. lack any foundation what
soever."
The toughly worded account ap
peared on the eve of a Polish Com
munist Party central committee
meeting today to purge allegedly anti
socialist elements, part of new leader
Stanislaw Kania's effort to take full
control of the party and impose rigor
ous discipline in the wake of Edward
Gierek's increasingly scandal-tinged
leadership.
Major strike
Kania just averted a major strike
last week in the latest party face-off
with Solidarity and the other indepe
dent trade unions over crucial matters
of political control of Poland's legal
system. It is thought here the Soviet
decision to recount the Rude Pravo
article is aimed in part at strengthen
ing Kania's hand at another crisis mo
ment. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev
has strongly endorsed the former
Polish secret police chief, and Mos
cow has backed that up with major ec
onomic and food aid.
But no one here among the foreign
analysts' community doubts Moscow
would dump Kania quickly if he

wavered in his efforts toirein in the un
ions The Rude l*ravo article also ap
peals directly to conservative ele
ments within the Polish party and
could strengthen their influence as
well.
Brezhnev, Defense Minister
Marshal Dmitri Ustinov and Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko were them
selves bluntly warned last week by
Sen. Charles Percy <R 111.), that in
tervention in Poland would be a
"catastrophe" for world relations
sure to bring a concentrated response
from the new Reagan administration
But the Rude l*ravo article indicates
the Kremlin would not hesitate to in
voke the '"Brezhnev doctrine" and in
tervene if the Polish communists lost
control to the increasingly powerful
independent unions.
International assistance
Tass said Rude Prauo emphasized
that "fraternal international as
sistance'' by the Warsaw Pact in 1968
had thwarted imperialist counter-rev
olutionaries working through "right
opportunist forces." Dubcek was
labeled a "right-opportunist" during
the Czech invasion, and publications in
East Berlin and Prague in recent days
have said the same forces are seeking
influence"now in Poland.
The Soviets' calculated use of in
direct voices to state Moscow's views
in part underlines Kremlin concern
over taking a public position in a dan
gerously volatile situation. There also
are detectable worries of inciting
fiercely anti-Russian Poles to further
party challenges.
However, Moscow has occasionally
spoken openly about its grave con
cerns. such as last week when the gov
ernment paper Izvestia in a Tass dis
patch warned that a threatened na
tional rail strike "could touch on na
tional and defense interests" and de
nounced the free unions for trying to
"maintain the tense situation in the
country." The strike was called off
when Kania and the unions reached a
compromise over the jailing of two un
ion members.
