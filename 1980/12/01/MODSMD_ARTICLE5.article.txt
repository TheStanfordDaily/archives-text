# Searchers find four bodies at Point Reyes
## 
### Associated Press 
Point Reyes Station — A "clean-cut" killer who
stalks women in remote parks and then psy
chologically tortures them before committing rit
ualistic murders is being sought for questioning in
seven unsolved murders during the past 15 months,
authorities said Sunday.
Marin County Sheriff A 1 Howenstein said officials
found a "thread of similarity" between four ap
parent homicide victims discovered in the Point
Reyes National Seashore park Saturday and the un
solved murders of three women on Mount
Tamalpais hiking trails since summer 1979.
Mount Tamalpais is about 25 miles south of Point
Reyes National Seashore and about five miles north
of San Francisco.
Howenstein said the entire area from Point Reyes
to Mount Tamalpais will be searched using infrared
aerial cameras on the possibility that there are
more bodies in the area.
"The thread of similarity has to do with what ap
pears to be the ritualistic aspect of the killings,"
Howenstein said at a news conference. 'The suspect
was motivated to put his victims through some
degree of psychological torture prior to the actual
killings."
Two of the victims discovered Saturday were
women hikers who had been reported missing by

friends about 24 hours before, investigators said.
The bodies were found nude in a wooded area, lying
next to each other.
The women had been shot to death. Their clothing
was scattered about the site.
The other two victims were so badly decomposed
that not even their sex could be determined im
mediately, officials said, estimating they had been
dead four to six months. Both were clad in shirts and
jeans. Howenstein said he is not sure whether they
too had been hikers.
One of the shooting victims was identified as
Diana O'Connell. 22, who apparently was from New
York. The second was a 25-year-old woman from
Idaho, Howenstein said.
He said the women had been hiking separately,
and there was no indication they knew each other.
Howenstein described the slayer as a white man,
of medium build with medium-length brown hair, 5-
foot-8 to 6-foot-l and "clean cut." He said the man
apparently forced his victims off park trails before
killing them and chose victims who appeared vul
nerable.
Howenstein said consultations with a psy
chologist led to the conclusion that the killer "very
carefully and deliberately plans these acts in his ef
fort to achieve some degree of psychological relief.
"The problem is that the murders will not satisfy
those needs, and they will get worse," Howenstein

said.
The ritualistic aspects of the killings include "put
ting the victims at some point in a position of plead
ing for their lives," he said, adding that the recent
slayings may have been an attempt to draw atten
tion to the previously undiscovered bodies.
"1 would not be surprised if he has killed
elsewhere," Howenstein said. "This individual
without question is cabable of striking again."
In the aftermath of the three Mount Tamalpais
killings over the last 15 months, alarmed residents
of the area had begun putting locks on their doors
and stopped walking and jogging in the woods. The
same may happen at Point Reyes.
Chris Fries. 39, who has lived near Point Reyes
for 12 years, said on learning of the discovery of the
bodies Saturday he was "terribly alarmed." He said
the area "doesn't feel like the sanctuary it has been
all these years."
Investigators have spent thousands of man-hours
in a futile search for a suspect in the Mt. Tamalpais
slayings.
On Aug. 20, 1979, Edda Kane of Mill Valley was
found shot to death near one of the most popular hik
ing trails on Mount Tamalpais. Last March,
Barbara Schwartz, also of Mill Valley, was stabbed
to death on a nearby trail. And in October. Anne
Alderson of San Rafael was shot to death in the same
area.

jeans. Howenstein said he is not sure whether they
too had been hikers.
One of the shooting victims was identified as
Diana O'Connell. 22, who apparently was from New
York. The second was a 25-year-old woman from
Idaho, Howenstein said.
He said the women had been hiking separately,
and there was no indication they knew each other.
Howenstein described the slayer as a white man,
of medium build with medium-length brown hair, 5-
foot-8 to 6-foot-l and "clean cut." He said the man
apparently forced his victims off park trails before
killing them and chose victims who appeared vul
nerable.
Howenstein said consultations with a psy
chologist led to the conclusion that the killer "very
carefully and deliberately plans these acts in his ef
fort to achieve some degree of psychological relief.
"The problem is that the murders will not satisfy
those needs, and they will get worse," Howenstein

said.
The ritualistic aspects of the killings include "put
ting the victims at some point in a position of plead
ing for their lives," he said, adding that the recent
slayings may have been an attempt to draw atten
tion to the previously undiscovered bodies.
"1 would not be surprised if he has killed
elsewhere," Howenstein said. "This individual
without question is cabable of striking again."
In the aftermath of the three Mount Tamalpais
killings over the last 15 months, alarmed residents
of the area had begun putting locks on their doors
and stopped walking and jogging in the woods. The
same may happen at Point Reyes.
Chris Fries. 39, who has lived near Point Reyes
for 12 years, said on learning of the discovery of the
bodies Saturday he was "terribly alarmed." He said
the area "doesn't feel like the sanctuary it has been
all these years."
Investigators have spent thousands of man-hours
in a futile search for a suspect in the Mt. Tamalpais
slayings.
On Aug. 20, 1979, Edda Kane of Mill Valley was
found shot to death near one of the most popular hik
ing trails on Mount Tamalpais. Last March,
Barbara Schwartz, also of Mill Valley, was stabbed
to death on a nearby trail. And in October. Anne
Alderson of San Rafael was shot to death in the same
area.
