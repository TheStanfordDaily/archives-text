# Newly created force poorly organized
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The U.S. early
warning plane cruises high over the
Persian Gulf. Below, the U.S. frig
ate patrols the gulf's azure waters.
They seem to be coordinated, but in
fact, they do not even com
municate directly with each other
The radar plane reports to the
Air Force in Europe, and the frig
ate to the Navy in Honolulu, half
way around the world in the other
direction.
Once, when F-14s rose to
challenge a U.S. presidential jet
over the Persian Gulf, its Air Force
pilot believed the fighters were Ira
nian. The planes actually were
American and had come from U.S.
carriers. But the pilot's confusion
was understandable. Neither the
Navy nor the Air Force knew the
other had planes in the area And
neither knew the radio frequencies
necessary to talk to the other.
The tangled communications
epitomize the command and con
trol nightmares facing the Rapid
Deployment Force that President
Jimmy Carter created to put steel
behind his promise to defend the
Persian Gulf and its vital re
sources.

"The force's command struc
ture is a totally screwed-up mess,''
a White House official said.
The force is a paper organization
set up under a Marine, Lt. Gen.
Paul Kelley. Under his command,
he has a planning staff of only 258
persons, drawn from all four ser
vices. If he should need men, he
must request units from the 200,000
Army, Air Force, Marine and naval
forces that make up a manpower
reservoir for the RDF.
Holy Roman Empire
Just as the Holy Roman Empire
was neither holy, nor Roman, nor
an empire, former Pentagon chief
James Schlesinger has written, the
Rapid Deployment Force cannot
live up to any of its names. But
even if it could — if sufficient air
lift and sealift capability magically
appeared and all the deficiencies in
weapon and personnel readiness
miraculously disappeared — the
force's overlapping and conflicting
lines of authority would cut sharply
into its fighting prowess and very
likely waste American lives if it
went into battle today.
Kelley reports through the
Army's Readiness Command in

peacetime, but directly to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff during war. He must
plan through both of them, as well
as the Navy's Pacific and Army's
European commands. And he must
contend with personal ambitions,
service rivalries, doctrinal dif
ferences and political pressures.
"The Army," one senior officer
said, "is not about to tell Kelley
that it'll support him while he goes
out to be a hero. The Air Force is in
bed with the Army. The Navy goes
with the Marines. Every service is
out to get all they can out of their
association with the KDF — from a
new desert uniform for the Army to
a third fleet for the Navy."
Iranian raid
"If you liked the Iranian raid
(which failed in an effort to free the
U.S. hostages)," a congressional
source said, "you'll love the RDF.
It's a prescription for disaster, and
it has the potent lal for great courts
martial later."
While politicians blame military
squabbling, military men insist
that political leaders in the White
House and the Pentagon knew they
were creating a cumbersome com
mand structure for the RDF.

But in the crisis atmosphere
created by events in Iran and Af
ghanistan priority was put on giv
ing the special force high visibility
and close proximity to the White
House to deter further Soviet ag
gression as well as impress the
U.S. electorate, several sources
said. As a result, command effi
ciency was sacrificed.
Geography
Geography complicated the
problems. The Persian Gulf is out
on the edge of all U.S. military
maps, at the seam where the Navy
run Pacific Command, which in
cludes all of the Indian Ocean,
meets the Armv-run European
Command, which includes land
surrounding the gulf.
"Is the Persian Gulf land or wa
ter?" one colonel asked "If water,
the Navy's Pacific Command
owns' it and should run the RDF.
including the surrounding land But
if it's land, which has the oil. then
the Army's European Command
owns' it and should have the RDF
and supporting bases such as Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean, now
run by the Navy."
Political leaders refused to
choose between those alternatives,
however, in part because it would
mean redrawing lines of authority
under the Unified Command struc
ture that has parceled out the world
among the U.S. military services
since World War 11. There are oth
er reasons.
Distances great
Distances are too great to supply
the RDF in the Persian Gulf from
Honolulu, for example. The Army's
European Command has the troops
vital to RDF deployment, but
White House officials feared Amer
ica's NATO allies would believe
that the United States was diluting
its commitment to the European
Alliance if it ran the RDF from Eu
rope.
"Pure eyewash," Gen. Alex
ander Haig, former U.S. Army and
NATO commander, said in an in
terview. "Any RDF deployment to
the gulf in the foreseeable future
will be supported through Europe
(using) U.S. forces there or
earmarked for NATO. The Europe
ans know it and we know it."
The RDF, being denied the two
obvious regional commands, in

itially was to be located in Wash
ington directly under the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. But it was placed
under the Armv-run Readiness
Command at Mac Dill Air Force
Base. Kla. The arrangement under
which Kellev reports to the Joint
Chiefs through Readiness Com
mand's Gen. Volenv Warner is un
precedented. Among other things,
the Joint Chiefs have never had op
erational control of troops, and
they are not structured to sustain
forces in combat. Kelley must get
his plans approved by Warner and
the Joint Chiefs, and cleared to
some extent with the Pacific and
European commands who "own"
the region in which RDF would op
erate.
'Alot of people to please'
"Kelley has a lot of people to
please," said one sympathetic gen
eral, "as well as having to nego
tiate for any troops he needs and
even the money to exercise them."
. "RDF was an affront to Read
iness Command and Warner from
the start," another general said.
The Readiness Command was
created to be prepared for Persian
Gulf-like emergencies, but as it
turns out, it serves as housekeeper
to RDF in peacetime.

"Is the Persian Gulf land or water?" This question has been asked by one
colonel because of the confusion about which arm of the United States
armed forces should run the rapid deployment force that is supposed to be
on call to protect American interests In the region. The area contains
more than naif of the world's known oil reserves, and has been embroiled
in revolution and war. The Rapid Deployment Force has been set up by
President Jimmy Carter for a quick U.S. response to trouble in the area.

Geography
Geography complicated the
problems. The Persian Gulf is out
on the edge of all U.S. military
maps, at the seam where the Navy
run Pacific Command, which in
cludes all of the Indian Ocean,
meets the Armv-run European
Command, which includes land
surrounding the gulf.
"Is the Persian Gulf land or wa
ter?" one colonel asked "If water,
the Navy's Pacific Command
owns' it and should run the RDF.
including the surrounding land But
if it's land, which has the oil. then
the Army's European Command
owns' it and should have the RDF
and supporting bases such as Diego
Garcia in the Indian Ocean, now
run by the Navy."
Political leaders refused to
choose between those alternatives,
however, in part because it would
mean redrawing lines of authority
under the Unified Command struc
ture that has parceled out the world
among the U.S. military services
since World War 11. There are oth
er reasons.
Distances great
Distances are too great to supply
the RDF in the Persian Gulf from
Honolulu, for example. The Army's
European Command has the troops
vital to RDF deployment, but
White House officials feared Amer
ica's NATO allies would believe
that the United States was diluting
its commitment to the European
Alliance if it ran the RDF from Eu
rope.
"Pure eyewash," Gen. Alex
ander Haig, former U.S. Army and
NATO commander, said in an in
terview. "Any RDF deployment to
the gulf in the foreseeable future
will be supported through Europe
(using) U.S. forces there or
earmarked for NATO. The Europe
ans know it and we know it."
The RDF, being denied the two
obvious regional commands, in

itially was to be located in Wash
ington directly under the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. But it was placed
under the Armv-run Readiness
Command at Mac Dill Air Force
Base. Kla. The arrangement under
which Kellev reports to the Joint
Chiefs through Readiness Com
mand's Gen. Volenv Warner is un
precedented. Among other things,
the Joint Chiefs have never had op
erational control of troops, and
they are not structured to sustain
forces in combat. Kelley must get
his plans approved by Warner and
the Joint Chiefs, and cleared to
some extent with the Pacific and
European commands who "own"
the region in which RDF would op
erate.
'Alot of people to please'
"Kelley has a lot of people to
please," said one sympathetic gen
eral, "as well as having to nego
tiate for any troops he needs and
even the money to exercise them."
. "RDF was an affront to Read
iness Command and Warner from
the start," another general said.
The Readiness Command was
created to be prepared for Persian
Gulf-like emergencies, but as it
turns out, it serves as housekeeper
to RDF in peacetime.

"Is the Persian Gulf land or water?" This question has been asked by one
colonel because of the confusion about which arm of the United States
armed forces should run the rapid deployment force that is supposed to be
on call to protect American interests In the region. The area contains
more than naif of the world's known oil reserves, and has been embroiled
in revolution and war. The Rapid Deployment Force has been set up by
President Jimmy Carter for a quick U.S. response to trouble in the area.
(For more details, see story on front page.)
Washington — The U.S. early
warning plane cruises high over the
Persian Gulf. Below, the U.S. frig
ate patrols the gulf's azure waters.
They seem to be coordinated, but in
fact, they do not even com
municate directly with each other
The radar plane reports to the
Air Force in Europe, and the frig
ate to the Navy in Honolulu, half
way around the world in the other
direction.
Once, when F-14s rose to
challenge a U.S. presidential jet
over the Persian Gulf, its Air Force
pilot believed the fighters were Ira
nian. The planes actually were
American and had come from U.S.
carriers. But the pilot's confusion
was understandable. Neither the
Navy nor the Air Force knew the
other had planes in the area And
neither knew the radio frequencies
necessary to talk to the other.
The tangled communications
epitomize the command and con
trol nightmares facing the Rapid
Deployment Force that President
Jimmy Carter created to put steel
behind his promise to defend the
Persian Gulf and its vital re
sources.

"The force's command struc
ture is a totally screwed-up mess,''
a White House official said.
The force is a paper organization
set up under a Marine, Lt. Gen.
Paul Kelley. Under his command,
he has a planning staff of only 258
persons, drawn from all four ser
vices. If he should need men, he
must request units from the 200,000
Army, Air Force, Marine and naval
forces that make up a manpower
reservoir for the RDF.
Holy Roman Empire
Just as the Holy Roman Empire
was neither holy, nor Roman, nor
an empire, former Pentagon chief
James Schlesinger has written, the
Rapid Deployment Force cannot
live up to any of its names. But
even if it could — if sufficient air
lift and sealift capability magically
appeared and all the deficiencies in
weapon and personnel readiness
miraculously disappeared — the
force's overlapping and conflicting
lines of authority would cut sharply
into its fighting prowess and very
likely waste American lives if it
went into battle today.
Kelley reports through the
Army's Readiness Command in

peacetime, but directly to the Joint
Chiefs of Staff during war. He must
plan through both of them, as well
as the Navy's Pacific and Army's
European commands. And he must
contend with personal ambitions,
service rivalries, doctrinal dif
ferences and political pressures.
"The Army," one senior officer
said, "is not about to tell Kelley
that it'll support him while he goes
out to be a hero. The Air Force is in
bed with the Army. The Navy goes
with the Marines. Every service is
out to get all they can out of their
association with the KDF — from a
new desert uniform for the Army to
a third fleet for the Navy."
Iranian raid
"If you liked the Iranian raid
(which failed in an effort to free the
U.S. hostages)," a congressional
source said, "you'll love the RDF.
It's a prescription for disaster, and
it has the potent lal for great courts
martial later."
While politicians blame military
squabbling, military men insist
that political leaders in the White
House and the Pentagon knew they
were creating a cumbersome com
mand structure for the RDF.

But in the crisis atmosphere

ghanistan priority was put on giv
