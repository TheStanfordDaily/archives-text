# Political polarization creates tensions
## Violence increases in San Salvador 
### Washington Post 
San Salvador â€” Two days af
ter five of its leaders were ab
ducted. strangled and shot to
death by a right-wing para
military death squad, the leftist
Revolutionary Democratic
Front presented its new ex
ecutive directors at a clan
destine news conference Satur
day in this strife-torn capital of
El Salvador.
The meeting following a night
of bombings throughout the city
and several early-morning
shootouts that underlined a
growing feeling here that the
moderates in the Christian
Democratic Party as well as the
U.S. Embassy are increasingly
helpless in slowing the process
of political polarization.
Although the Christian Demo
crats. who serve in the ruling ci
vilian-military junta, have de
nied government complicity in
the Thursday killings, party
leaders Saturday warned that
the brutal assassinations were
part of a right-wing plot "to
create a major state of terror
and demoralization that will
permit them to advance their
plans for a coup d'etat."
At the same time, U.S. Am
bassador Robert White met
with Jesuit leaders in the offices
of a Catholic secondary school
where the murdered leftists
were abducted.
After the meeting, White
called the killings an "un
speakable crime" and told the
Jesuits, many of whom are
closely tied to the left, that
"they do not stand alone." He

lamented the damage done to
the cause of peace, and cau
tioned that "such provocative
acts only strengthen the grow
ing vicious circle of violence al
ternating between the far right
and far left."
The Catholic Archdiocese of
San Salvador, which regularly
criticizes the U.S.-backed junta
for alleged human rights vio
lations, again charged that gov
ernment security forces are
supporting the terrorists.
' 'The same elements (respon
sible for the kidnappings and
killings), coordinated or sup
ported by the public security
bodies, are assassinating people
with impunity," a church
statement said.
The rapid regrouping of the
leftist leadership suggests that
the killings were less damaging
to its structure and its revolu
tionary plans than to any chance
of peace for this country that
has already lost about 9000 peo
ple to political violence this
year.
Violence escalating
"There has been an esca
lation."said Eduardo Calles, 40,
an agricultural engineer who re
placed the murdered Enrique
Alvarez Cordova as a member
of the front's directorate. "The
situation has matured and we
hope within a short time to liber
ate the people."
Saul Villalta, 32. the new rep
resentative of the Unified Popu
lar Action Front on the revolu
tionary directorate, said such

bloodshed is simply "a risk of
the revolution."
Other members of the or
ganization's new directorate
who appeared Saturday were
Carlos Gomez, 29, of the Popu
lar Liberation Movement. Juan
Jose Martelli of the Social
Christian Party, Manuel Quin
tanilla, 33, of the National Dem
ocratic Union and Marco
Portillo. 24. and Francisco Re
bollo, 23. of the Popular Revolu
tionary Bloc. Leoncio Pichinte
of the Popular Leagues of Feb.
28. the only remaining member
of the original directorate, did
not appear
Popular support
The size of the crowd Wednes
day may give some indication of
the popular strength of the left
here.
Long before armed guerrillas
were able to present any serious
threat to the government, the
so-called mass organizations,
working among exploited
peasants and laborers, had gar
nered massive support man
ifested in repeated demonstra
tions in the streets of the capi
tal. Some of the crowds ex
ceeded 100,000.
It was also these groups that
frequently occupied govern
ment buildings and foreign em
bassies.
Such actions often ended in vi
olence and many of the groups'
supporters died in the process.
For the last eight months, their
public activity has largely sub
sided.

The government claims this
is because the mass organiza
tions no longer have mass sup
port. The organizations, pulled
together since last winter in the
Revolutionary Democratic
Front, claim they simply
changed their tactics. They said
they were preparing for war,
working in concert with the
guerrillas whose disparate ele
ments have been brought to
gether as the Farabundo Marti
Liberation Front.
