## Political opposition rising in China's PLA leadership 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing — Political trouble appears to be
mounting within the Chinese army over the aban
donment of Maoist policies and the new,
pragmatic course the country is taking.
What was passive resistance last spring to po
litical and economic changes grew into open
grumbling over the summer in the 4-million-man
army, and that has turned into outright opposi
tion in some cases.
From the generals on down to the enlisted men,
the most serious doubts center on the economic
liberalization, decentralization of industry, the
emphasis on market forces rather than govern
ment planning, and particularly the return to
family-type farming in many places.
Although the army backed the current leader
ship under Deng Xiaoping, an old soldier himself
and now a Communist Party vice chairman, as it
consolidated its power, the military has since
seen its political influence diminish.
Within the top ranks of the party and govern
ment, the generals now are outvoted by econo
mists, technocrats and emerging political figures
like Premier Zhao Ziyang, and the old ties they
have with Deng and other veteran leaders do not
seem to count for much.
Forced retirement
Many of the army's longtime commanders,
soldiers whose careers go back to the Com
munists' guerrilla days in the 19305, and who are
well into their 60s and 70s, are being forced into
retirement as part of the national effort to re
juvenate the country's leadership.
The army is bracing itself at the same time for
the probable purge of its officer corps to remove
the "pernicious influence of the ultraleftists," a
major problem because virtually every battalion,
regiment, division and possibly corps com
mander was either selected or promoted on the
basis of his ideological fervor during the Cultural
Revolution of the late 1960s and the years of radi
cal dominance that followed.
There are other complaints — a cut in defense
spending, plans to reduce the size of the ground
forces, recruiting difficulties, no jobs for de
mobilized soldiers, restrictions on the army's
traditional privileges, loss by regional comman
ders of their local government posts — and most
of them seem to be attributed within the army to
the recent political changes.
The extent of this unrest has been underlined

by the failure of the party leadership to win
agreement on a new defense minister, although
the man who still nominally holds the post retired
three months ago as a vice premier.
Differing ideas
'The party leaders have their ideas, the gener
als have theirs, and so far there has been no meet
ing of minds, no compromise," said a Chinese so
ciologist and political scientists who has studied
the country's military establishment. "The post
is important because the new defense minister
will play a key role in reshaping, or not reshaping,
the military."
For the fourth time in 18 months, senior of
ficers in both the headquarters and the regional
commands of the People's Liberation Army are
going through intensive political study courses to
"emancipate their thinking." the principal
slogan of the de-Maoization campaign.
The Liberation Army Daily, the People's Daily
and other leading newspapers have stepped up
their calls for the army's support of the policies
adopted over the last two years in ways that make
clear how widespread the criticism of them is
within the armed forces.
"A necessary political condition for being a
leading cadre (in the army) is to make a still
greater effort to study and support resolutely the
correct line, principles and policies laid down by
the party," the military newspaper declared in
one of the recent commentaries on the "party's
absolute leadership over the army.
Those who cannot accept the new policies that
have been adopted in the last two years simply
"cannot be trusted by the people," the Liberation
Army Daily added. "As the army holds the gun,
we must stress this point particularly," the paper
said.
The party leadership so far has relied on politi
cal persuasion to win the military's support,
arguing the Maoist injunction that, although
"power grows from the barret of a gun," the par
ty must always "command the gun."
But the soldiers are so skeptical of current poli
cies. particularly the economic and agricultural
reforms, that orders to adhere to the party line
are not enough. Now, groups of officers and en
listed men are being sent to study the new poli
cies. both in industry and in rural areas, so that
they can judge for themselves the effectiveness
of the policy changes.
