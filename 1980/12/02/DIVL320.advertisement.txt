MBA GRADUATES
FINANCE, ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING
We'll name-drop... if you will
You're probably familiar with many of our products, including Jack Daniels,
Southern Comfort, Early Times, and Bolla and Cella wines. And, if you're an
MBA graduate in finance, administration, or marketing, we'd like to add your
name to our growing list of those people looking for high growth and
challenge.
Since 1870 when George Garvin Brown first entered the whiskey business,
we at Brown-Forman have been carrying on the family-honored tradition of
producing nothing but auality merchandise. The success of this tradition is
evident in our company's growth and development over the years.
1980, however, represented yet another year of record results for us. Our
company's net sales, for example, ahead for the twenty-second consecutive
year, rose 21% to $676 million. Our second auarter ending October 31st, 1980
advanced 36% from the like period a year ago. It was also the year Jack
Daniel's Black Label moved significantly in front as the largest selling brand in
the corporation; the year when Southern Comfort was successfully merged in
our company's operations; the year Canadian Mist become the number one
U.S.-bottled Canadian whiskey and third in sales among all Canadian
whiskies.
Brown-Forman is very optimistic about the future growth of the great majori
ty of their products, but as one of the top 6 largest companies in the alcoholic
beverages industry, we are eaually optimistic about the future growth of this
year's MBA graduates.
A representative from Brown-Forman will be on campus, December 4,1980.
