# Court will rule on registration
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Washington — The Supreme Court
agreed yesterday to judge the con
stitutionality of a male-only military
draft.
The court will decide whether the
government may require young men
to register for possible military ser
vice and require them to serve when
young women face no such require
ments.
Some 4 million men were required
to register for the draft last July. If
the justices uphold a lower court's rul
ing — and their decision probably will
not be announced until sometime next
spring or summer — the government
might have to destroy all records of
that registration.
If an all-male draft is ruled a form
of unconstitutional discrimination,
Congress will have to amend the Mili
tary Selective Service Act to include
women as potential draftees.
A three-judge federal court panel in
Philadelphia July 18 struck down the
nation's 31-year-old draft law because
it excluded women.
"The principal reason the govern
ment proffers for a male-only regis
tration is that it provides military
flexibility," the panel said. "The re
cord here, however, reveals that wom
en do serve a useful role in the mili
tary and provide important skills ...
flexibility is not enhanced but is in fact
limited by the complete exclusion of
women."
Under a landmark 1976 Supreme
Court decision, laws treating men and
women differently cannot stand un

less they serve "important gov
ernmental objectives" and are "sub
stantially related" to achieving such
objectives.
Applying that standard of judicial
scrutiny, the three-judge panel said
the draft law "unconstitutionally dis
criminates between males and
females."
While government lawyers limited
their arguments to the validity of
draft registration, the three-judge
panel's decision struck down the en
tire Military Selective Service Act,
which includes military induction as
well as registration.
Military induction has not taken
place since 1973. Even if military reg
istration and the draft were upheld,
Congress would have to pass a new law
to allow for call-ups to resume.
Ironically, the legal challenge that
led to the three-judge decision was
filed in 1971 as a protest to the Viet
nam war, and for years lay dormant.
That all changed last December
when President Jimmy Carter re
instituted draft registration in the
wake of the Soviet Union's interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan granted an emergency re
quest by the government this summer
and allowed the registration to be car
ried out.
In other action today, the high
court:
—Agreed to decide, in a case involv
ing a private university in Seattle,

whether the Department of Education
can withhold federal money from
schools that discriminate against
teachers and other school employees.
—Left intact a ruling by the New
York Court of Appeals forbidding po
lice officers to chase a person who
flees when asked a question, unless
there is "probable cause" to believe
the person has committed a crime, is
doing so or is about to.
