# From jeans to transmissions, religion sells in Southern Cal
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
A Northern California man
sees a vision of a sports shirt
with a dove on it and starts a
clothing company manufac
turing attire bearing the famil
iar Christian symbol. Four
years later, his shirts are being
sold in more than 850 stores na
tionwide.
Disneyland officials decide to
gear a special night to a Chris
tian audience. The first event is
a near sellout and proves so
trouble-free that the Southern
California amusement park
starts scheduling two Christian
oriented nights each year.
The axiom is becoming as
clear as the fish-shaped ichthus
symbols that blink from a grow
ing number of neon signs on
businesses large and small:
Jesus sells.
And with an estimated 84 mil
lion American adults presently
identifying themselves as Chris
tians, according to a recent
Gallup Organization study, the
sales are fast moving out of the
Bible book stores and into the
secular business world.
Increasingly, businesses with
Christian-oriented products are
taking their wares to secular
outlets. Entrepreneurs with
secular goods are using Chris
tian symbols and religious
words to broadcast their faith
and draw customers who share

it.
The Christian Yellow Pages,
a telephone directory designed
"to aid the Christian in locating
a Brother in the Lord if He
should desire to do business with
a Christian," is circulating in
about 60 communities na
tionwide.
Tony Hoover saw the possi
bilities five years ago while liv
ing in Northern California. He
said he had been a "born-again.
Christian" for less than a year
when he designed a sports shirt
bearing a dove, symbol of the
Holy Spirit.
Hoover has registered the
dove and the ichthus — a Chris
tian symbol that looks like a fish
— as trademarks with the Cali
fornia and federal govern
ments, he said.
And plans are underway to
manufacture an entire line of
sportswear — from jeans to
bathing suits — sporting the
trademarks and marketing
them in the secular retail world
based on the size of the Chris
tian buying public.
Hoover makes no apologies
for capitalizing on Christianity.
"We're absolutely not non
profit," he says. "Christ ex
pects us to eat, make house
payments, buy cars like every
one else. I don't think we would

be exploiting Jesus Christ."
Christian symbols, particu
larly the dove and the fish, can
be seen on the revolving signs
above tire stores and on the ser
vice trucks of plumbers.
The owners and operators of
these businesses typically de
scribe themselves as "born
again Christians" who want to
let the world know what they be
lieve and attract fellow be
lievers as customers.
They are offering the same
prices and products as their non-
Christian competitors, they say,
but they provide a better chance
that the customer will be
treated fairly.
"Christians are happy to
come to us," said Walt
Stegeman, manager of One Way
Transmission Service in Santa
Ana, Calif.
"The transmission business
does not enjoy a great reputa
tion. This is God's business. We
treat people with Christian prin
ciples."
Many of these businessmen
try to reach the Christian mar
ketplace through the Christian
Yellow Pages, Christian Busi
ness and Professional Directory
and other specialized publica
tions.
Those who produce the direc
tories see them not only as a
marketing device but as a min
istry — a communications vehi
cle for the Christian communi
ty.
