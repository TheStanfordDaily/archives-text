# Fight rape attempt, Chicago study says
## 
### Associated Press 
Chicago — Women who re
sist a rape attempt are more
likely to escape the sexual
attack and run no greater
risk of serious physical in
jury than women who sub
mit, two new studies say.
"There is a myth that re
sistance would increase a
woman's risk of being in
jured. But that does not ap
pear to be the case at all,"
said Mary Lystad, chief of
the National Center for the
Prevention and Control of
Rape, an agency of the Na
tional Institute of Mental
Health.
Two recent studies paid
for by the center indicate
that the more women resist,
the more they are likely to
escape an attacker.
Women who were passive,
cried, tried to talk their way
out, play on the attacker's
sympathy or make them
selves look less appealing
were more likely to be
raped, Lystad said.

"The thing not to do is act
utterly passive," she said.
"A woman who behaves as if
she is weak and defenseless
appears to increase her risk
of rape."
The studies were con
ducted by Pauline Bart of the
University of Illinois Medi
cal Center and Jennie Mcln
tyre of the Bureau of Social
Science Research Inc., in
Washington.
Bart's study was based on
an analysis of 43 rapes and 51
rape attempts in the Chicago
area. Mclntyre analyzed 320
rape attempts, 128 of which
failed.
Both researchers said re
sisting did not lead to in
creased risk of serious in
jury. However, they said,
fighting back could result in
the risk of more minor in
juries, such as bruises.
They also said that wheth
er or not an assailant has a
weapon is a minimal factor
in how a rape attempt turns
out.
