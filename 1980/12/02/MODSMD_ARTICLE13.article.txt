# Soviets plan slower 5-year growth
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — The Soviet Union today un
veiled modest economic goals for the next
five years, although its new development
plans envision increased oil production in
the coming decade, contradicting recent
CIA projections.
As outlined by the official Tass news
agency early this morning, the general
economy will grow at a slower rate than the
past five years, reflecting a probable over
all energy pinch and meaning a likely
further slowdown in improving living stan
dards for millions of Soviet citizens.
The 1981-85 national economic plan, to be
adopted in February at the 26th national
Communist Party Congress, dispels any
speculation that the Kremlin under Leonid
Brezhnev plans major new departures in
handling the economy despite possible pres
sures for reform generated by the Polish ec
onomic crisis.
Overall economic growth is projected
around five percent annually, far better
than almost all Western industrialized coun
tries can expect, but also beyond recent So
viet economic performance. The country is
saddled with inefficient and aging in
dustries, grossly unproductive agriculture

and a backward transporation system. The
new plan earmarks major resources in each
of these areas, but it is likely the goals will
remain unmet, as they have in each of the
five-year plans for nearly two decades.
However, it is the energy figures that will
be studied most intently in the West, where
apprehensions are high that the Soviet Un
ion — the world's biggest petroleum pro
ducer — may become a net oil importer in
the 1980s. Such a development would have
major impact on skyrocketing world prices.
The draft plan issued by the party Central
Committee calls for production of petrole
um and gas concentrate to increase to as
much as 12.9 million barrels a day by 1985.
In 1979, daily production stood at 12.1 mil
lion barrels, and the CIA last year predicted
that would drop to around 10 million barrels
a day by the mid-1980s.
The new Soviet plan sets a minimum goal
of 12.4 million barrels a day for 1985, a sharp
slowdown in the growth of oil production,
but still far better than the ClA's analysts
predict. If the Soviets can attain that min
imum goal, they will have lessened the like
lihood of Moscow becoming a net importer.
However, the Kremlin and its central
planners face major obstacles in achieving

even that modest increase, at a time when
their important East Bloc allies and Third
World clients are pressing hard for greater
shipments of energy. Soviet oil exploitation
now centers on remote western Siberian re
gions, where costs are astronomical and
shipment problems to domestic industries
and foreign markets immense. Meanwhile,
older energy deposits in western areas of
the Soviet Union are increasingly played
out.
But the Soviets have mounted a major
four-year drive to expand exploitation and
have announced drastic energy conserva
tion measures. They also are likely to shift
more industries to natural gas, the major
star of their otherwise pinched energy pic
ture. Natural gas is projected to rise by
more than 50 percent from present prod
uctions levels by 1985, an increase that may
be helped along by the $1 billion gas pipeline
deal cleared recently by the White House.
The Soviet stake in stretching its oil re
sources is great: the country last year
earned more than a third of its precious
hard currency through petroleum sales
abroad, and has used the money for sophisti
cated equipment to help modernize its in
dustries.
