# Right-to-die group up against British law
## 
### Washington Post 
London — The increasingly
militant campaign of the
world's leading voluntary
euthanasia society to give in
curably ill people assistance in
committing suicide has run into
strong legal opposition in Brit
ain.
The leader of the London
based group — Exit: The Socie
ty for the Right to Die with
Dignity — and one of its more
than 10,000 members face crim
inal charges of illegally conspir
ing to aid and abet a number of
suicides here.
The society also is fighting a
lawsuit by another of its mem
bers, a physician, who is trying
to stop it from distributing a
booklet that contains detailed
instructions on ways to commit
suicide quickly, quietly and
painlessly.
These court actions follow a
surge of international interest
in recent years in voluntary
euthanasia for the terminally ill
and in the activities of the 45-
year-old British society, which
has spawned similar groups in

15 other countries, including the
United States.
The central figure in the court
battles here is Exit's general
secretary, Nicholas Reed, 33, an
intense academic with a flair
for debate and publicity. He has
transformed the group from a
quiet, upper-class gentlemen's
philosophical society seeking
changes in suicide laws into a
broadly based, aggressive and
controversial champion of the
right of the incurably ill and dis
abled to end their suffering by
suicide.
Under Reed's leadership,
Exit has multiplied its paid
membership fivefold, gained
wide media exposure, held sem
inars and sent speakers to civic
associations, campuses and ra
dio and television programs
throughout the country.

Exit has widely distributed
much literature arguing its
cause and seeking new mem
bers. and contributions.
It also provides forms for wit
nessed declarations "to my
family and my physician" that
"if there is no reasonable pros
pect of my recovery from physi
cal illness or impairment ex
pected to cause me severe dis
tress or to render me incapable
of rational existence, I request
that I be allowed to die and not
be kept alive by artificial means
and that I receive whatever
quantity of drugs may be re
quired to keep me free from
pain or distress even if the mo
ment of death is hastened.''
Exit has unsuccessfully tried
to persuade Parliament to enact
legislation that would go further
by allowing people to make dec
larations authorizing their doc
tors to '' administer

euthanasia" by killing them or
helping them commit suicide if
they are "suffering from an in
curable and distressing disease
or disability," as judged by at
least two physicians.
In the meantime, Reed wants
Exit to distribute to its mem
bers the self-help suicide hand
book, which would eliminate the
need of outside assistance for
people still physically able to
take their own lives. Exit of
ficials said many of its new
members joined just to receive
the booklet.
But the booklet and Exit's ac
tivism have stirred strong op
position here from church lead
ers. the British medical associa
tion, the police, some of Exit's
own older members and estab
lishment voices such as The
Times newspaper.
Suicide is no longer a crime in
Britain, and no one can be prose

cuted for unsuccessfully at
tempting it. But under the 1961
law that made suicide legal
here, it is still a crime in Eng
land and Wales for anyone, in
cluding a physician, to "aid.
abet, counsel or procure" anoth
er person's suicide.
Lyons faces a charge of
murder in the death of one wom
an, five charges of aiding and
abetting suicides and four of
conspiring to aid and counsel su
icide. Police searching Lyon's
home discovered "suicide
kits." detailed diaries of his ac
tivities. and documents connec
ting him to Exit.
Referring to Lyons, the prose
cutor told the judge, "We find it
difficult to attribute any at
titude of good, but rather his
conduct seems to have been
motivated more by pleasure
which he received in assisting
the ending of life."
