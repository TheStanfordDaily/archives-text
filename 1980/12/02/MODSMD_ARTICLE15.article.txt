## An energy policy for whom? 
### 
"Conservation means we'll all either have to be
too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter. "
Ronald Reagan, November 1980
Last year, the Harvard School of Business pub
lished an analysis of energy futures for the United
States. It concluded that a vigorous conservation
program combined with the use of existing re
newable technologies and resources (chiefly so
lar ) can provide for the projected increase in the
nation's energy demand. It stipulates that such a
policy is economically feasible and stable in the
long term This policy would reduce our depen
dence on foreign energy resources as well as stim
ulate economic growth. Yet the same study recog
nizes that this recommendation is flawed in one
important respect: it lacks widespread political
support.
Clearly, an energy policy emphasizing con
servation and renewable resources is a threat to
the energy industry. This industry, which has a
strong lobby in Congress, has found a new friend
— President-elect Ronald Reagan. Reagan's
energy task force, headed by Houston oil consul
tant Michael Halboutv, recommends decontrol of
petroleum prices, enhanced development of re
sources on federal lands, reduction of environ
mental regulations and a speed-up of licensing of
nuclear plants.
Energy Future, the Harvard publication, ad
vocates decontrol and enhanced development of
resources on federal lands (on the condition that
environmental safeguards are strictly observed.)
Conservation, though, is the key element of the
Harvard recommendation.
Given that the production of oil and natural gas
in the U.S. has passed peak levels, that nuclear
power is uneconomical, and that the potential for
coal power is limited by externals and political
opposition, any increase in the use of non-re
newable resources should be avoided. Instead, a
gradual shift to renewable resources should be in
stigated in small, yet significant, increments.
Conservation is considered to be the best transi
tion resource, particularly for the '80s.
The eventual goal, according to this policy, is to
minimize our reliance on fossil fuels in order to
strengthen and stabilize our economy. Not only
would this policy reduce our need to import for
eign oil (thus improving our balance of trade > and
increase our national security, it would also pro
vide consumers with energy at a lower cost. There
are. then, a preponderance of strong arguments
that an energy policy emphasizing conservation
and renewable energy resources is in the national
interest.
But why will the new Congress and adminis

tration ignore the logic of Energy Future? Be
cause the policy it recommends conflicts with the
interests of the energy industry. Corporate giants
have much at stake. It is in the corporate interest
to maintain an energy policy which emphasizes
foSsil fuels in that the profitability of these
sources will only be enhanced by rising prices.
Further, the industry has an enormous capital in
vestment to protect in its production and distribu
tion facilities.
However, Energy Future's logic is not totally
lost on energy industry executives. They realize
that fossil fuels are on the way out — that is why
the industry is currently developing renewable re
sources and technologies. When the fossil fuels
have been exhausted, the energy industry will be
prepared to introduce the renewable technologies
that will allow them to maintain their control of
the energy market. (Some knowledgeable ob
servers have accused the oil-energy con
glomerates of buying up the smaller companies
inventing renewable technologies in order to con
trol the development and marketing of alter
native energy systems.)
Assuming that it is plausible that the energy in
dustry's long-term strategy is as described, and
given the political influence of the industry, it is
not surprising that our national energy policy will
be a conventional one. The economic and national
security benefits that might be realized by the
Energy Future recommendation will be foregone;
the rising energy prices and ever-increasing level
of imports that characterized the '70s will be ex
tended through the '80s.
This state of affairs gives us cause to consider
the proper role of government in our society.
Should government act in the national public in
terest. or should it act in the interest of corporate
institutions? Granted that these interests cannot
be entirely separated, the distinction between
them is nevertheless made quite clearly by the
energy policy issue.
If one should conclude that our government
ought to be acting in the public interest, and
further that government is, in fact, not acting in
that interest, on whom do we lay the blame? On
the voting public for not asserting its interests, or
on special interests for seeking their own best in
terests (even though they may conflict with the
national interest), or both? Upon consideration of
these questions, one may well be forced to ques
tion the ability of our system of government to
make rational, objective policies that serve the
broad public interest.

Should government act in the national public in
terest. or should it act in the interest of corporate
institutions? Granted that these interests cannot
be entirely separated, the distinction between
them is nevertheless made quite clearly by the
energy policy issue.
If one should conclude that our government
ought to be acting in the public interest, and
further that government is, in fact, not acting in
that interest, on whom do we lay the blame? On
the voting public for not asserting its interests, or
on special interests for seeking their own best in
terests (even though they may conflict with the
national interest), or both? Upon consideration of
these questions, one may well be forced to ques
tion the ability of our system of government to
make rational, objective policies that serve the
broad public interest.

"Conservation means we'll all either have to be
too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter. "
Ronald Reagan, November 1980
Last year, the Harvard School of Business pub
lished an analysis of energy futures for the United
States. It concluded that a vigorous conservation
program combined with the use of existing re
newable technologies and resources (chiefly so
lar ) can provide for the projected increase in the
nation's energy demand. It stipulates that such a
policy is economically feasible and stable in the
long term This policy would reduce our depen
dence on foreign energy resources as well as stim
ulate economic growth. Yet the same study recog
nizes that this recommendation is flawed in one
important respect: it lacks widespread political
support.
Clearly, an energy policy emphasizing con
servation and renewable resources is a threat to
the energy industry. This industry, which has a
strong lobby in Congress, has found a new friend
— President-elect Ronald Reagan. Reagan's
energy task force, headed by Houston oil consul
tant Michael Halboutv, recommends decontrol of
petroleum prices, enhanced development of re
sources on federal lands, reduction of environ
mental regulations and a speed-up of licensing of
nuclear plants.
Energy Future, the Harvard publication, ad
vocates decontrol and enhanced development of
resources on federal lands (on the condition that
environmental safeguards are strictly observed.)
Conservation, though, is the key element of the
Harvard recommendation.
Given that the production of oil and natural gas
in the U.S. has passed peak levels, that nuclear
power is uneconomical, and that the potential for
coal power is limited by externals and political
opposition, any increase in the use of non-re
newable resources should be avoided. Instead, a
gradual shift to renewable resources should be in
stigated in small, yet significant, increments.
Conservation is considered to be the best transi
tion resource, particularly for the '80s.
The eventual goal, according to this policy, is to
minimize our reliance on fossil fuels in order to
strengthen and stabilize our economy. Not only
would this policy reduce our need to import for
eign oil (thus improving our balance of trade > and
increase our national security, it would also pro
vide consumers with energy at a lower cost. There
are. then, a preponderance of strong arguments
that an energy policy emphasizing conservation
and renewable energy resources is in the national
interest.
But why will the new Congress and adminis

tration ignore the logic of Energy Future? Be
cause the policy it recommends conflicts with the
interests of the energy industry. Corporate giants
have much at stake. It is in the corporate interest
to maintain an energy policy which emphasizes
foSsil fuels in that the profitability of these
sources will only be enhanced by rising prices.
Further, the industry has an enormous capital in
vestment to protect in its production and distribu
tion facilities.
However, Energy Future's logic is not totally
lost on energy industry executives. They realize
that fossil fuels are on the way out — that is why
the industry is currently developing renewable re
sources and technologies. When the fossil fuels
have been exhausted, the energy industry will be
prepared to introduce the renewable technologies
that will allow them to maintain their control of
the energy market. (Some knowledgeable ob
servers have accused the oil-energy con
glomerates of buying up the smaller companies
inventing renewable technologies in order to con
trol the development and marketing of alter
native energy systems.)
Assuming that it is plausible that the energy in
dustry's long-term strategy is as described, and
given the political influence of the industry, it is
not surprising that our national energy policy will
be a conventional one. The economic and national
security benefits that might be realized by the
Energy Future recommendation will be foregone;
the rising energy prices and ever-increasing level
of imports that characterized the '70s will be ex
tended through the '80s.
