## 'I wish I were a humanities major' blues 
### 
Something has come to my at
tention in these weeks ap
proaching finals at Stanford
which does not demand correc
tion as much as it does recog
nition. I am referring to the"I
wish I were a Humanities ma
jor" lament, a sentiment voiced
more frequently and with
greater conviction during the
trying times of Chem 131. Phys
ics 55, and Calc 44 examina
tions.
As an English major with a
good number of science-ori
ented friends and acquain
tances. it is not uncommon for
me to listen to a tale of modern
horror: a description of chem
lab and an afternoon spent in
Swain Library, desperately
hunting for the name of an un
known chemical illustrated on
an amibguous and complex
NMR spectrum.
My attention and sympathy
toward such assignments are
sincere. I have great pity for the
Stanford science major, and
however ineffective my con
dolences may be at so frenetic a
time,my concern is, if nothing
else, quite genuine.
Moments of despair
It is, however, during these
and similar moments of despair
when sighs of "I wish I were a
huamnities major," are mut
tered (sometimes screamed) by
these victims of a pressurized
pre-med environment. Albeit
blurted in frustration and anger,
they are indicative of a common
generality made by many Stan
ford students; the "fuzzy" stud
ies major requires less time, en
durance, and intelligence than
the "solid" science/math ma
jor.
Now, we all know that this is

not a valid assumption. Social
science and humanities degrees
are earned with comparable in
tellect. comparable work loads
and comparable blood, sweat
and tears. Additionally, we all
know that particular disciplines
require specific talents, and to
logically and justly pit one
course of study against another
is clearly unreasonable.
Few will deny these truths to
be self-evident, but who actual
ly believes them? I often do not;
I am unfortunately a product of
biased societal attitudes, and
tend to regard the sciences as a
more difficult course of study.
Even disregarding "irrelevant"
considerations such as competi
tion, assignments, and time per
week devoted to the class, there
is one fact that I can not ignore
in my observation of various
academic pursuits; put into a
normal physics course, my only
contribution to the class would
undoubtedly be a lowering of
test curves due to my score on a
midterm. There are. however,
many science devotees who
could match my comprehension
of certain literary master
pieces.
In other words, I am not argu
ing that the "fuzzy" studies at
Stanford are as time-consuming
and as rigorous as the sci
ence, match curriculum. What I
am pointing out is that contrary
to popular opinion, the human
ities and social sciences do in
corporate more than a mild in
terest in the subject matter, a
tolerable amount of weekly
hours devoted to "light" text
readings, and difficult but not
noteworthy midterms and
finals.
Courses in philosophy, Eng

lish, and history may not re
quire endless hours in a library
hunting for an unknown theory,
but they do in fact utilize an abil
ity to organize and express sub
jective and intangible ideas in a
rational manner, an under
standing of how situations and
facts in uncontrolled environ
ments may influence one anoth
er such that diverse outcomes
are possible and must be equally
considered, a command of the
English language, and enough
conviction and genuine interest
in a subject which appears to
have less impact on today's job
market than do other dis
ciplines.
Further, using the study of lit
erature as a "first-hand ex
perience'' example, one can
argue that this type of major re
quires a famliaritv with a broad
scope of topics. In order to dis
cover themes, recognize al
lusions and symbolism, under
stand allegories, trace charac
ter development and the like,
the English major must be ac
quainted with subjects like his
tory, philosophy, psychology,
culture and mythology.
Through literature, the
reader invariably experiences
man and his affiliation with the
arts and sciences much like the
other humanities and social sci
ence students interrelate os
tensibly incompatible material
in their theories and dis
cussions.
Re-evaluate attitude
With these arguments serving
as a base, I am not proposing an
innocent and hypocritical
mutual admiration pact (Okay,
English is hard too — really it
is.), nor am I ready to be direc
tor of "Stand Up and Cheer,"

the first fuzzy studies aware
ness week at Stanford Univer
sity.
What I have in mind is a re
evaluation on the part of the hu
manities/social science major
in regard to his attitude toward
his own subject of study. Do you
hesitate, as I often do, to com
plain of your work load only be
cause your friends have a phys
ics problem set due the next
day? If so. try the selfish ap
proach: whimper because you,
like other students, are prone to
periods of suicidal tendencies,
and deserve the brief and use
less catharsis brought about
through grumbling.
I am also asking for a re
assessment on the part of the
science/math major. Do you
find yourself listening to the
wail of your sociology-inclined
roommate with polite and insin
cere concern? If so, try to re
member that the standards for
academic excellence affect vir
tually all courses of study at
Stanford, and most important
ly, that differences in class
work and competition in various
fields do not extend themselves
to the intellects of the students
involved.
A desire to consider a human
ities major is understandable; I
certainly am satisfied with its
range and profundity. But to ex
press an interest in this dis
cipline only because it is "eas
ier' ' shows not only a limited un
derstanding of humanities and
social sciences, but a lack of re
spect for enriching and thought
provoking studies as well.

dolences may be at so frenetic a
time,my concern is, if nothing
else, quite genuine.
Moments of despair
It is, however, during these
and similar moments of despair
when sighs of "I wish I were a
huamnities major," are mut
tered (sometimes screamed) by
these victims of a pressurized
pre-med environment. Albeit
blurted in frustration and anger,
they are indicative of a common
generality made by many Stan
ford students; the "fuzzy" stud
ies major requires less time, en
durance, and intelligence than
the "solid" science/math ma
jor.
Now, we all know that this is

not a valid assumption. Social
science and humanities degrees
are earned with comparable in
tellect. comparable work loads
and comparable blood, sweat
and tears. Additionally, we all
know that particular disciplines
require specific talents, and to
logically and justly pit one
course of study against another
is clearly unreasonable.
Few will deny these truths to
be self-evident, but who actual
ly believes them? I often do not;
I am unfortunately a product of
biased societal attitudes, and
tend to regard the sciences as a
more difficult course of study.
Even disregarding "irrelevant"
considerations such as competi
tion, assignments, and time per
week devoted to the class, there
is one fact that I can not ignore
in my observation of various
academic pursuits; put into a
normal physics course, my only
contribution to the class would
undoubtedly be a lowering of
test curves due to my score on a
midterm. There are. however,
many science devotees who
could match my comprehension
of certain literary master
pieces.
In other words, I am not argu
ing that the "fuzzy" studies at
Stanford are as time-consuming
and as rigorous as the sci
ence, match curriculum. What I
am pointing out is that contrary
to popular opinion, the human
ities and social sciences do in
corporate more than a mild in
terest in the subject matter, a
tolerable amount of weekly
hours devoted to "light" text
readings, and difficult but not
noteworthy midterms and
finals.
Courses in philosophy, Eng

lish, and history may not re
quire endless hours in a library
hunting for an unknown theory,
but they do in fact utilize an abil
ity to organize and express sub
jective and intangible ideas in a
rational manner, an under
standing of how situations and
facts in uncontrolled environ
ments may influence one anoth
er such that diverse outcomes
are possible and must be equally
considered, a command of the
English language, and enough
conviction and genuine interest
in a subject which appears to
have less impact on today's job
market than do other dis
ciplines.
Further, using the study of lit
erature as a "first-hand ex
perience'' example, one can
argue that this type of major re
quires a famliaritv with a broad
scope of topics. In order to dis
cover themes, recognize al
lusions and symbolism, under
stand allegories, trace charac
ter development and the like,
the English major must be ac
quainted with subjects like his
tory, philosophy, psychology,
culture and mythology.
Through literature, the
reader invariably experiences
man and his affiliation with the
arts and sciences much like the
other humanities and social sci
ence students interrelate os
tensibly incompatible material
in their theories and dis
cussions.
Re-evaluate attitude
With these arguments serving
as a base, I am not proposing an
innocent and hypocritical
mutual admiration pact (Okay,
English is hard too — really it
is.), nor am I ready to be direc
tor of "Stand Up and Cheer,"

the first fuzzy studies aware
ness week at Stanford Univer
sity.
What I have in mind is a re
evaluation on the part of the hu
manities/social science major
in regard to his attitude toward
his own subject of study. Do you
hesitate, as I often do, to com
plain of your work load only be
cause your friends have a phys
ics problem set due the next
day? If so. try the selfish ap
proach: whimper because you,
like other students, are prone to
periods of suicidal tendencies,
and deserve the brief and use
less catharsis brought about
through grumbling.
I am also asking for a re
assessment on the part of the
science/math major. Do you
find yourself listening to the
wail of your sociology-inclined
roommate with polite and insin
cere concern? If so, try to re
member that the standards for
academic excellence affect vir
tually all courses of study at
Stanford, and most important
ly, that differences in class
work and competition in various
fields do not extend themselves
to the intellects of the students
involved.
A desire to consider a human
ities major is understandable; I
certainly am satisfied with its
range and profundity. But to ex
press an interest in this dis
cipline only because it is "eas
ier' ' shows not only a limited un
derstanding of humanities and
social sciences, but a lack of re
spect for enriching and thought
provoking studies as well.

Something has come to my at

which does not demand correc

more frequently and with
greater conviction during the

hunting for the name of an un

an amibguous and complex
