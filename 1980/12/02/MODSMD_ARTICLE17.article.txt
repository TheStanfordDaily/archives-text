# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mary Speck Avert the spectre of another Vietnam 
### 
Ever since the Sandinist vic
tory in Nicaragua, the contain
ment of socialism in Central
America has become one of the
United States' top priorities. Af
ter the "loss" of Nicaragua, the
U.S. is determined to defeat the
guerrilla struggle in El
Salvador. But the alternative to
socialism offered by the U.S.
backed junta in El Salvador is
no different from the alter
native offered 10 years ago in
Vietnam — a slow, cautious pro
gram of reform backed by the
brutal repression of all workers,
peasants or intellectuals de
emed sympathetic to the guer
rilla struggle.
"Repression with a human
face.'' the combination of
altruistic rhetoric with naked
brutality, is working no better in
El Salvador than it did in Viet
nam. The overthrow of General
Carlos Humberto Romero in Oc
tober of 1979, like the overthrow
of Diem in Vietnam nearly 20
years before, was intended to
restore credibility to a govern
ment tainted by corruption and
violence. But the new U.S.
backed military-civilian junta
lasted barely three months. By
January all civilians on the
Salvadorean junta and in the
cabinet had resigned in protest.
Promised reforms had been
blocked while military repres
sion had increased.
The escalation of violence in
El Salvador since January has
proven once again that "demo

cratic pluralism" cannot be im
posed by a military government
which is armed to the teeth
against its own people. Presi
dent-elect Ronald Reagan has
already advocated an increase
in military aid to El Salvador
which will only prolong the
bloodshed. Rather than permit
another Nicaragua, the U.S.
may create another Vietnam.
The following chronology of
events in El Salvador covers
1980. If the new administration
decides to back an all-out civil
war against those who oppose the
military government, the casu
alties in 1981 may be in the tens
of thousands.
January
— The civilian leadership of the
Salvadorean junta and all civil
ian cabinet ministers resign in
protest over their inability to
either curb military repression
or enact promised reforms.
— The Christian Democratic
Party is resuscitated to form a
new junta and cabinet. All other
major political parties refuse to
participate in the government.
— The U.S. Congress approves
$300,000 in International Mili

Salvadorean military.
February
— Archbishop Romero of San

testing U.S. military and eco
nomic aid to El Salvador.
"Since you are a Christian
who states an interest in defend
ing human rights," he writes,
"prohibit military aid to the
Salvadorean government and
guarantee that your country
will not intervene directly or in
directly with military, econom
ic or diplomatic pressure to de
termine the destiny of the
Salvadorean people."
March
— The Salvadorean government
announces an agrarian reform
backed by state of siege and

all soldiers "in the name of
God" to stop the shooting of ci
vilians. He is assassinated the

April
— The Democratic Revolu

professional associations and
small businesses, is formed in
support of the guerrilla struggle
against the Salvadorean govern

— As the new program of
agrarian reform begins to take
effect repression in the coun
tryside increases. The army, in
cooperation with right-wing
paramilitary organizations,
steps up attacks on peasant
communities with ties to rural
unions or cooperatives. The
grotesquely mutilated bodies of
the slain are left in public places
as a warning to the populace.
The Catholic Church reports
that over 400 peasants have been
killed in March and April alone.
— The U.S. Congress approves
$5.7 million in Foreign Military
Sales (FMS) credits to El
Salvador.
May
— A Honduran diocese reports
that over 600 Salvadorean refu
gees have been killed in a
massacre at the Rio Sampul on
the Honduran border. Forced by
Honduran troops to swim back
across the river to El Salvador
where the military awaits them,
hundreds of men, women and
children are drowned, cut down
in machine gun fire, or executed
after attempted escape.
June
— Five hundred government
troops storm the campus of the
National University in San
Salvador. At least fifty people
are killed and scores of students
are arrested. The military con
tinues to occupy the campus in
violation of a constitutional pro
vision guaranteeing the univer
sity's autonomy.
July
— Members of the National
Guard and the paramilitary or
ganization ORDEN kill newly
ordained priest Jose Otsmaro
Caceres in a village near San
Salvador. Father Caceres is the
third priest to be assassinated
since January.

Rodriguez Terrazas is shot in
cold blood by a member of the
National Guard. He is the fourth
journalist to be assassinated

this year.
September
— The United States govern
ment announces that economic
and military aid to El Salvador
will be increased by $20 million,
bringing the total for 1980 to $90
million.
October
— A spokesman for the
archdiocese of San Salvador ac
cuses the military of killing
"dozens of defenceless women,
children and old people" in an
antiguerrilla sweep near the
Honduran border. Red Cross of
ficials estimate that up to 5000
refugees have gathered near the
border. The total number of ref
ugees both within El Salvador
and in neighboring countries is
estimated at about 40,000.
— Dr. Ramon Valladares Perez,
executive director of the
Church-backed Salvadorean hu
man rights commission, is as
sassinated. Three days later the
rector of the National Univer
sity, Dr. Felix Antonio Ullea, is
assassinated while driving
through downtown San
Salvador.
— The Catholic Church an
nounces that the death toll since
January has surpassed 9000, a
rate of about 50 murders per
day. An estimated 80 percent of
these deaths is attributed to mil
itary and paramilitary or
ganizations.
November
— Right wing death squads as
sassinate 54 young men and
women in San Salvador. A sign
left beside one group of bullet
ridden bodies reads, "With
Ronald Reagan, we will finish
the guerrillas and evil-doers in
El Salvador and Central Ameri
ca."
— Twenty-four members of the
Democratic Revolutionary
Front are seized during a secret
meeting in San Salvador. Wit
nesses report that National
Guardsmen participated in the
kidnapping. The tortured bodies
of five leaders of the FDR, in
cluding the front's president,
Enrique Alvarez Cordoba, are
discovered later that day.

Ever since the Sandinist vic
tory in Nicaragua, the contain
ment of socialism in Central
America has become one of the
United States' top priorities. Af
ter the "loss" of Nicaragua, the
U.S. is determined to defeat the
guerrilla struggle in El
Salvador. But the alternative to
socialism offered by the U.S.
backed junta in El Salvador is
no different from the alter
native offered 10 years ago in
Vietnam — a slow, cautious pro
gram of reform backed by the
brutal repression of all workers,
peasants or intellectuals de
emed sympathetic to the guer
rilla struggle.
"Repression with a human
face.'' the combination of
altruistic rhetoric with naked
brutality, is working no better in
El Salvador than it did in Viet
nam. The overthrow of General
Carlos Humberto Romero in Oc
tober of 1979, like the overthrow
of Diem in Vietnam nearly 20
years before, was intended to
restore credibility to a govern
ment tainted by corruption and
violence. But the new U.S.
backed military-civilian junta
lasted barely three months. By
January all civilians on the
Salvadorean junta and in the
cabinet had resigned in protest.
Promised reforms had been
blocked while military repres
sion had increased.
The escalation of violence in
El Salvador since January has
proven once again that "demo

cratic pluralism" cannot be im
posed by a military government
which is armed to the teeth
against its own people. Presi
dent-elect Ronald Reagan has
already advocated an increase
in military aid to El Salvador
which will only prolong the
bloodshed. Rather than permit
another Nicaragua, the U.S.
may create another Vietnam.
The following chronology of
events in El Salvador covers
1980. If the new administration
decides to back an all-out civil
war against those who oppose the
military government, the casu
alties in 1981 may be in the tens
of thousands.
