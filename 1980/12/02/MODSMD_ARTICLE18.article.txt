A new pronoun
In the interest of developing a
new pronoun capable of ex
pressing "she or he," "hers or
his," "s/he" and "him- or
herself," and in the interest of
developing a writing system
that is both simple and
aesthetic, and in the interest of
including in this new pronoun
system the element of age, I
would like to propose the use of o
for the following reasons:
1. The o is the basic element
in the female and male symbols.
The o has been used to designate
the being that is as yet unsexed
— the embryo.
2. O is the Spanish word for
"or." It is a tradition in English
to borrow words from other lan
guages as well as to confine
their meaning to a specific area
of understanding.
3. The concept "or" is the
basic meaning element needed
in a new pronoun system.
4. O means lack, nothing,
none. A neutral referential term
that implies nothing about the
referent is desirable particular
ly in theoretical or hypothetical
writing.
5. 0 makes a parallel term to
I. Parallels are easy to re
member and easy to use.
6. O does not replace he, she,
his, her, himself, herself where
they truly apply but replaces the
"generic" he and his which re
fer to "a person." O serves in
addition. And finally,
7. The use of the period is to
designate a declarative, em
phatic, but not overemphasized,
statement. The o for adults can
be written o and» the o for chil
dren can be left unmarked. Or
an unmarked o can be used for
anyone when people of all ages
and both sexes are meant.
I submit this for your con
sideration.

Hold elections
The University could avoid
long litigation by consenting to
an election to decide whether
clerical workers want a union to
represent them, and, particu
larly, whether they want Local
715 of the Service Employees In
ternational Union, now on cam
pus. to represent them.
This can be done under full
compliance with the National

Labor Relations Board's
(NLRB) laws and regulations.
Several years ago. Local 680
of SEIU filed cards with the
NLRB signed by Stanford Hos
pital employees authorizing the
union to represent them. In
stead of going into long liti
gation hearings before the
NLRB, the hospital adminis
tration met with the Union and
worked out a compromise in
which they agreed on the classi
fications to be included in the
bargaining units.
The NLRB was supplied with
a list of employees in these clas
sifications. It checked these
names against the authorization
cards submitted by the union
and verified that over 30 percent
of the employees in these classi
fications had signed author
ization cards. On this basis the

NLRB held elections at the hos
pital.
Authorization cards are con
fidential, by law, and the hospi
tal never saw them. For the Uni
versity to imply that the union
would ever turn over author
ization cards to them or that the
union wanted no vote by employ
ees is contrary to fact. For the
administration to imply that it
could not meet with union repre
sentatives is a misrepresenta
tion of NLRB rules.
It is still possible, I believe,
for the administration to meet
with employees' represent
atives in an attempt to hold
dmeocratic elections without
time consuming, expensive pro
ceedings before the NLRB. Why
not try?

of SEIU filed cards with the
NLRB signed by Stanford Hos
pital employees authorizing the
union to represent them. In
stead of going into long liti
gation hearings before the
NLRB, the hospital adminis
tration met with the Union and
worked out a compromise in
which they agreed on the classi
fications to be included in the
bargaining units.
The NLRB was supplied with
a list of employees in these clas
sifications. It checked these
names against the authorization
cards submitted by the union
and verified that over 30 percent
of the employees in these classi
fications had signed author
ization cards. On this basis the

NLRB held elections at the hos
pital.
Authorization cards are con
fidential, by law, and the hospi
tal never saw them. For the Uni
versity to imply that the union
would ever turn over author
ization cards to them or that the
union wanted no vote by employ
ees is contrary to fact. For the
administration to imply that it
could not meet with union repre
sentatives is a misrepresenta
tion of NLRB rules.
It is still possible, I believe,
for the administration to meet
with employees' represent
atives in an attempt to hold
dmeocratic elections without
time consuming, expensive pro
ceedings before the NLRB. Why
not try?
