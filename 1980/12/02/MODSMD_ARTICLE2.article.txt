# Galvez House to institute energy saving program
## 
### Debbie Walker 
In its continuing effort to offset in
creasing energy costs, the University
has initiated the Building Energy
Managers Program.
According to Nancy Teater, assis
tant energy manager at the University
the goal of the program is to reduce
the University's electricity usage by
10 percent. That goal translates into
$350,000 of savings annually at current
rates.
The University is emphasizing elec
tricity because individuals have more
direct control over lights and elec
trical equipment than over the use of
steam or chilled water, which is sup
plied from a central plant.
Lynda Weisberg, who manages the
energy program in the University's fa
cilities office, said department heads
have selected an individual or group of
individuals to act as energy manager
in each buiding inhabited by the de
partment.
Energy-saving tactics
Duties of the building energy man
ager will include maintaining charts
on electricity consumption, turning
off lights and shutting off equipment
at the end of the day, and finding
means of reducing energy use during
peak hours of the day when the Univer
sity is charged more for electricity.
Jackie Miller is acting as a building
energy manager in Galvez House,
which is occupied by some programs
of the Political Science department.
One of the first things I did was
take inventory of all the electricity
uses in the buillding and map them
out," Miller said. "Now we must iden
tify all points where conservation is
possible."
Miller also prepared a handout for
the occupants of the building outlin
ing the University's goals and the pos
sibilities for conserving electricity in
the workplace.
"At one time we ran three coffee

pots," Miller said. "Now we just run
one."
Though she said it is important to
eliminate unnecessary electrical
equipment, Miller said she believes
the main savings in Galvez House will
come from reduced lighting levels.
The occupants are in the process of
evaluating possibilities of "delamp
ing" in over-lighted areas of the build
ing.
"The major problem is that people
become accustomed to certain levels
of light and are reluctant to alter it, re
gardless of necessity," Miller said.
According to Weisberg, building
energy managers will not only be in a
position to influence their colleagues,
but also will be better able to identify
technical problems which result in ex
cessive energy consumption.
Professor of Applied Earth Science
George Parks has been acting as an
unofficial building manager in the
Mitchell Earth Sciences Building for
the past two years. He said he has
always been surprised that Stanford
did not appoint building managers.
Need for managers
"It seems to me that it is very im
portant to have someone in every
building who works there, who takes
problems personally and who will un
derstand how the building is supposed
to work," Parks said. "Without a per
son in charge, problems are neglected
until they are very serious. "
In addition to the building energy
managers themselves, the Energy
Program Office and the utilities office
will be responsible for compiling and
distributing monthly electricity use
reports which will inform the building
energy manager how much electricity
is being used and how the levels com
pare with last year's use.
Teater stressed that the Energy
Program Office will continue to aid
the building managers, serving as a
source of information and guidance.
