# France's funny man for president
## 
### Associated Press 
Paris â€” The presidential candidacy of
Coluche, France's most popular comedi
an, is gaining momentum. One survey in
dicated as many as 27 percent of the vot
ers might choose him in April's first
round presidential ballot.
No one expects him to make it to the
final round in May
Nonetheless, the chubby, bespec
tacled comic who dresses in funny
clothes and peppers his speech with
rough language, is causing an uproar
among politicans who claim he is an in
sult to the democratic process.
The 32-year-old Coluche, who sports
bright yellow tennis shoes, seersucker
overalls and a red, white and blue sash,
appears unmoved by the criticism.
"Before me, France was cut in two,"
he says. "With me, it will be doubled up

with laughter."
His main campaign pledge: "If
elected, 1 will not take office."
His party: "I am the abstentionistcan
didate, the candidate for those who are
consumers of politics but never make it,
of homos and taxi drivers, hairdressers
and farmers, the candidate of minor
ities."
His slogan: "Better to vote for a
fathead than for someone who treats you
like a fathead."
His experience: "All professional poli
ticians are amateur comedians Me, I'm
a professional comedian, so why not vote
for Coluche?"
One of his close aides, Rene Gorline,
was found murdered in a gravel pit out
side Paris last week.
After being questioned by police Col
uche said, "They've already tried a lot of

things to stop my campaign but they ran
do nothing to stop a grassroots cam
paign. They know perfectly well I won't
be president, but I risk upsetting some
people."
Coluche's tongue-in-cheek march
toward the presidential Elysee Palace
began in October when he whimsically
announced he would seek the 500 signa
tures from 43,000 officials around the na
tion that are needed to become a can
didate.
Giscard d'Estaing. who tiptoed to vic
tory in 1974, is expected to win another
seven-year term,
Although Giscard d'Estaing leads all
polls by a healthy margin over his closest
rival. Socialist leader Francois Mitter
rand. the polls show that 75 percent of
those surveyed feel Giscard d'Estaing is
an unreliable leader
