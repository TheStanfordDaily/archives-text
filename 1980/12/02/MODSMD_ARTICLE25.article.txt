## The 						Idolmaker Another chip off the old rock 
### Steve Vineberg 
The Idolmaker is Vinnie
Vacarri (Ray Sharkey), a
sonwriter in the late '50s who
"creates" rock 'n' roll stars of
the Fabian/Dion variety: sexy,
muscular childmen with ex
travagant coiffures that look
lacquered and a suggestion of
danger in their eyes. Though it
has a screenplay (by Edward Di
Lorenzo) that is fraught with
cliches. The Idolmaker is ac
tually an interesting picture.
The debut project of director
Taylor Hackford. it is informed
with a snide, perverse wit that
undercuts the sentimentality in
the script — it is a sort of rock
'n' roll film noir.
The movie chronicles Vin
nie's rise to success through his
manipulation of his first "prop
erty", Tommy Dee (Paul
Land), to the top of the charts,
and his decision to turn a busboy
of no special talent whom he
dubs Caesare into a myth. Di
Lorenzo's, and Hackford's, vi
sion of the young record-buying

public is outrageously cynical:
they fall for sexual energy even
when it is in the form of a vague
promise. (Vinnie sells Caesare
on the strength of beefcake
photographs that he plasters
everywhere months before the
singer's first concert.)
When Tommy first performs,
it is for a platter party for kids
who cannot be older than fif
teen. and so the way in which
they grab at the grown man,
whose style has both a sharp
edge and an unpleasant ar
rogance about it, is both amus
ing and disturbing. After the
performance, Tommy lures one
of the girls to his car with his re
cord as bait and nearly rapes
her; Vinnie interrupts the pro
ceedings, dries the kid's tears
and sends her back to her
friends with a stack of forty
fives — and she waves happily
at Tommy as she runs off.
Hackford's tongue is, ob
viously, firmly set in his cheek
when he provides this kind of
twist, and his nastiness can be

very entertaining. He jux
taposes the drooling fan letters
of panting adolescents with
shots of Tommy indulging his
vices — liquor, pills, casual sex
— in a parody of the old 1950s
moralizing about the evils of pop
music, In this movie, pop music
is unabashedly evil, and the in
nocence of the little girls who
swear eternal devotion to their
idols is a springboard for a lewd
joke.
Though it is set 20 years ago,
The Idolmaker is a punk musi
cal in style and tone. Under
neath his upswept hairdo,
Caesare (played in a minor key
by Peter Gallagher, with sud
den, unusual high notes) has
scary eyes: the sweet kid Vinnie
picked up in his brother's res
taurant is warring with the
razor-sharp sex star he has been
turned into, and we can feel the
constant threat of violence.
During the opening number of
Caesare's first public ap
pearance, he is attacked by
screaming girls who tear his
shirt and claw his face; Vinnie

has the audience restrained and
forces Caesare to start over.
What happens then in Caesare's
number is fierce and frenzied —
Bacchic — and we are in the
land of Mick Jagger and his suc
cessors, not the comparatively
tame terrain of the early rock
n' roll singers. Though it is
wildly implausible that Caesare
could have summoned up, on the
spot, such a high degree of musi
cal and choreographic control,
still this torn, bruised fireball is
something to watch.
Unfortunately, for most of the
movie Hackford has to deal not
with this kind of savage energy,
but with the script's bald treat
ment of the corrupt nature of
the music and magazine in
dustries; with Italian family
scenes that sound like outtakes
from The Godfather; with a
hopelessly flat romance be
tween Vinnie and a magazine
editor named Brenda (played
with exhausting pertness by
Tovah Feldshuh, a refugee from
the Broadway musical stage
who may be the most recent

throwback to Mitzi Gaynor);
and with Vinnie's trans
formation from an amiable, ag
gressive climber td a relentless
bastard on the top rung of suc
cess. Ray Sharkey is charming
and resilient in most of the
scenes in which an Italian Dud
dy Kravitz is called for —
though he slips into a shameless
Brando imitation in a restau
rant scene with his Mafioso
father (even the lines seem to
belong to Stanley Kowalski:
"You know what I say ? I say,
So what?' ").
But he is not the right actor
for the tyrant Vinnie turns into,
and the dialogue, especially that
of the other characters in reac
tion to his metamorphosis,
leaves him stranded. "I'm look
ing for the human being but I
can't find him." Brenda tells
him. By this time we are looking
for the movie Taylor Hackford
was trying to make, and it has
been buried in the suds and the
stale, leftover pieces of other
show biz movies.

with a snide, perverse wit that
undercuts the sentimentality in
the script — it is a sort of rock
'n' roll film noir.
The movie chronicles Vin
nie's rise to success through his
manipulation of his first "prop
erty", Tommy Dee (Paul
Land), to the top of the charts,
and his decision to turn a busboy
of no special talent whom he
dubs Caesare into a myth. Di
Lorenzo's, and Hackford's, vi
sion of the young record-buying

public is outrageously cynical:
they fall for sexual energy even
when it is in the form of a vague
promise. (Vinnie sells Caesare
on the strength of beefcake
photographs that he plasters
everywhere months before the
singer's first concert.)
When Tommy first performs,
it is for a platter party for kids
who cannot be older than fif
teen. and so the way in which
they grab at the grown man,
whose style has both a sharp
edge and an unpleasant ar
rogance about it, is both amus
ing and disturbing. After the
performance, Tommy lures one
of the girls to his car with his re
cord as bait and nearly rapes
her; Vinnie interrupts the pro
ceedings, dries the kid's tears
and sends her back to her
friends with a stack of forty
fives — and she waves happily
at Tommy as she runs off.
Hackford's tongue is, ob
viously, firmly set in his cheek
when he provides this kind of
twist, and his nastiness can be

very entertaining. He jux
taposes the drooling fan letters
of panting adolescents with
shots of Tommy indulging his
vices — liquor, pills, casual sex
— in a parody of the old 1950s
moralizing about the evils of pop
music, In this movie, pop music
is unabashedly evil, and the in
nocence of the little girls who
swear eternal devotion to their
idols is a springboard for a lewd
joke.
Though it is set 20 years ago,
The Idolmaker is a punk musi
cal in style and tone. Under
neath his upswept hairdo,
Caesare (played in a minor key
by Peter Gallagher, with sud
den, unusual high notes) has
scary eyes: the sweet kid Vinnie
picked up in his brother's res
taurant is warring with the
razor-sharp sex star he has been
turned into, and we can feel the
constant threat of violence.
During the opening number of
Caesare's first public ap
pearance, he is attacked by
screaming girls who tear his
shirt and claw his face; Vinnie

has the audience restrained and
forces Caesare to start over.
What happens then in Caesare's
number is fierce and frenzied —
Bacchic — and we are in the
land of Mick Jagger and his suc
cessors, not the comparatively
tame terrain of the early rock
n' roll singers. Though it is
wildly implausible that Caesare
could have summoned up, on the
spot, such a high degree of musi
cal and choreographic control,
still this torn, bruised fireball is
something to watch.
Unfortunately, for most of the
movie Hackford has to deal not
with this kind of savage energy,
but with the script's bald treat
ment of the corrupt nature of
the music and magazine in
dustries; with Italian family
scenes that sound like outtakes
from The Godfather; with a
hopelessly flat romance be
tween Vinnie and a magazine
editor named Brenda (played
with exhausting pertness by
Tovah Feldshuh, a refugee from
the Broadway musical stage
who may be the most recent

throwback to Mitzi Gaynor);
and with Vinnie's trans
formation from an amiable, ag
gressive climber td a relentless
bastard on the top rung of suc
cess. Ray Sharkey is charming
and resilient in most of the
scenes in which an Italian Dud
dy Kravitz is called for —
though he slips into a shameless
Brando imitation in a restau
rant scene with his Mafioso
father (even the lines seem to
belong to Stanley Kowalski:
"You know what I say ? I say,
So what?' ").
But he is not the right actor
for the tyrant Vinnie turns into,
and the dialogue, especially that
of the other characters in reac
tion to his metamorphosis,
leaves him stranded. "I'm look
ing for the human being but I
can't find him." Brenda tells
him. By this time we are looking
for the movie Taylor Hackford
was trying to make, and it has
been buried in the suds and the
stale, leftover pieces of other
show biz movies.


Peter Gallagher as the teen idol
The Idolmaker is Vinnie
Vacarri (Ray Sharkey), a
sonwriter in the late '50s who
"creates" rock 'n' roll stars of
the Fabian/Dion variety: sexy,
muscular childmen with ex
travagant coiffures that look
lacquered and a suggestion of
danger in their eyes. Though it
has a screenplay (by Edward Di
Lorenzo) that is fraught with
cliches. The Idolmaker is ac
tually an interesting picture.
