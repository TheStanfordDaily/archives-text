# Rhumba Queen stars in film
## 
### Jim Mattson 
Bye Bye Brazil is a very good, "small" movie
that seemingly appeared out of thin air — it
showed up in Bay Area theaters in the last week or
so with no advance notice at all. It would be a
shame if its anonymity continues; this one's too
nice a surprise to pass up.
This Brazilian import, directed by Carlos
Diegues. is a sweet-tempered, occasionally
raunchy comedy about trying to survive in a coun
try that's "progressing" so rapidly that it's easy
to get left behind in a mire of poverty and lost
dreams.
The movie begins when a carnival, crammed
onto a beat-up flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands. It carries, the
truck's loudspeaker blares, the "gypsy lord," a
magician and teller of fortunes; Salome, the
"queen of the rhumba;" and Swallow, a strong
man and fire breather.
They've been this way before, and business is
good. though it was better the year before. The act
is popular; the townspeople have neither tele
vision nor politics to distract them. When they
leave town the next day, an accordion player begs
to be brought along — he wants to see the ocean
and a try for better life. He and his pregnant wife
join the troupe; they're on their way, it seems, to
the obtaining the fine promises of the cities.
The sea, of course, is polluted. The audiences
are polluted, too — by the "fishbones" of roof-top
antennas. There's no room for a carnival where
television has gained a foothold.
There's the rub. Television represents the good
life; it's the ultimate consumer good. The
carnival players, despite their dreams of glory,
have no place in this world. The simple pleasures
they can offer — the gypsy lord's card tricks,
Salome's "erotic'' dance accompanied by an ac

cordion — are nothing compared to disco dancing
on TV.
Brazil's a big country, so they strike out for the
hinterlands, where television hasn't yet thrown
its blue-gray light. Here, though, they are the ones
who are too sophisticated. The villagers mistake
the gypsy lord's mind-reading act for the real
thing, and implore him to bring rain to their
parched crops.
The troupe can offer nothing to anyone: they're
neither cynical enough to compete with TV nor
sincere enough to bring miracles. The only thing
left to them, it seems, is prostitution, and that is
what they must turn to, to survive.
Director Diegues does nothing to soften this im
pression. The characters are caught in a clash be
tween their desires and abilities, and they end up
selling out to try to achieve their goals.
These goals, Diegues suggests, are neither at
tainable nor entirely desirable. Part of the gypsy
lord's act is creating "snow" (made up of
shredded coconut) inside the carnival tent. Now
Brazil has snow, he says, just like the "civilized
countries" in Europe and North America. It's a
small, pathetic dream. People in a tropical para
dise envy everything their northern neighbors
have — even harsh weather.
Bye Bye Brazil is a remarkable film, enjoyable
to watch and memorable afterward. Its technical
crudity is more than offset by its warmth and good
spirits. The beauty of Brazil (what other movie
has had much of its action set in the heart of the
Amazon?) and the strength of its people combine
to create a film that is uniquely affecting. Film
makers in the "civilized countries" could do well
to follow th\s example.
