# Wonder back from the greenhouse
## 
### Mike Oneal 
Finally he's back. Stevie Wonder's
Hotter Than July IS hot. Though he
seemed hopelessly abandoned in the
greenhouse with his last effort The Se
cret Life of Plants, Motown's brightest
commodity hasn't lost his stuff.
Stevie has always been avant-garde.
That's what makes him such a pleasure.
Talking Book in 1972 and Inneruisions in
1973 were like nothing before them in
soul music. They molded Stevie's unique
style. Those two albums solidified the
Stevie Wonder who now seems so com
mon only because we've grown up with
him. but who stands completely alone,
inherently inimitable.
But all that was abandoned in the Se
cret Life giant three record package. It
was so long, experimental, convoluted
and downright weird, it was boring. Es
sentially. it seemed "Little Stevie Won
der" had lost touch with his roots —
those which lie in downtown Detroit.
Hotter Than July recaptures the
Stevie Wonder we know and love. It has
just the right amount of funk and just the
right amount of soul to keep it on the
ground where we feel comfortable with
it, but at the same time, soars with
Stevie's unforgettable voice and inflec
tion, piano, synthesizer and harmonica
work. The album is vintage Stevie Won
der.
Perhaps part of what brought him
back down to earth was the cause of
Hotter Than July — to promote Stevie's

campaign to make Martin Luther King's
birthday, January 15, a national holiday.
Stevie has always been concerned with
civil rights, (Talking Book's "Big
Brother" and Innervisions's "Living For
the City" for example) but with Full
fillingness' First Finale and Songs in the
Key of Life. he seemed more preoc
cupied with songs about deeper rela
tionships and the trancendental qualities
of human existence. Or at least that's
what he said. The Secret Life of Plants
took all that a little too far.
Now he seems to have fallen com
fortably back into an earlier role — de
fender of love and black ascendence.
Side one, which is the better of the two,
is an assortment of love songs high
lighted by "All I Do" — reminiscent of
"Golden Lady" and "You Are the Sun
shine of My Life." It is easily the best
song on the album and maybe one of the
better Stevie has ever done. It's a little
discouraging that it was written and
saved about 10 years ago, but never
theless, that song alone merits buying
the album.
Side two has three good and two medi
ocre songs. Not surprisingly, the three
good ones are the album's "statement"
tunes.
"Master Blaster (Jammin)", the
Lp's top-40 selection, is a celebration of
Third World power linked with inner-city
rejuvination. It's deliberately reggae to
remind us of the plight of the Third World
and is essentially bright and happy with

semi-subversive lyrics:
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world, is full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
"Do Like You" is strained. It's a story
about a little boy becoming a great
dancer, and comes off as a little corny.
"Lately", the only slow ballad on the
album, is destined to find its niche only
as hold-music on the telephone.
"Cash in Your Face" is a protest song
about discrimination in housing. It's fast
but off-beat, which makes it hold your in
terest.
"Happv Birthday" makes the case for
King's birthday. It's happy and uplifting,
but unfortunately, it's not a song anyone
will hear without buying the album. Con
sequently, it's not that effective a
statement, though the song puts it right
to the point:
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
He set aside for his recognition
After a few years of wondering what
happened, it's nice to know that Stevie
Wonder hasn't tripped and fallen. Maybe
the best thing about Hotter Than July is
that it's nice to have him back. It would
also be gratifying to see his dream come
true.

took all that a little too far.
Now he seems to have fallen com
fortably back into an earlier role — de
fender of love and black ascendence.
Side one, which is the better of the two,
is an assortment of love songs high
lighted by "All I Do" — reminiscent of
"Golden Lady" and "You Are the Sun
shine of My Life." It is easily the best
song on the album and maybe one of the
better Stevie has ever done. It's a little
discouraging that it was written and
saved about 10 years ago, but never
theless, that song alone merits buying
the album.
Side two has three good and two medi
ocre songs. Not surprisingly, the three
good ones are the album's "statement"
tunes.
"Master Blaster (Jammin)", the
Lp's top-40 selection, is a celebration of
Third World power linked with inner-city
rejuvination. It's deliberately reggae to
remind us of the plight of the Third World
and is essentially bright and happy with

semi-subversive lyrics:
Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world, is full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
"Do Like You" is strained. It's a story
about a little boy becoming a great
dancer, and comes off as a little corny.
"Lately", the only slow ballad on the
album, is destined to find its niche only
as hold-music on the telephone.
"Cash in Your Face" is a protest song
about discrimination in housing. It's fast
but off-beat, which makes it hold your in
terest.
"Happv Birthday" makes the case for
King's birthday. It's happy and uplifting,
but unfortunately, it's not a song anyone
will hear without buying the album. Con
sequently, it's not that effective a
statement, though the song puts it right
to the point:
I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
He set aside for his recognition
After a few years of wondering what
happened, it's nice to know that Stevie
Wonder hasn't tripped and fallen. Maybe
the best thing about Hotter Than July is
that it's nice to have him back. It would
also be gratifying to see his dream come
true.
Finally he's back. Stevie Wonder's
Hotter Than July IS hot. Though he
seemed hopelessly abandoned in the
greenhouse with his last effort The Se
cret Life of Plants, Motown's brightest
commodity hasn't lost his stuff.
Stevie has always been avant-garde.
That's what makes him such a pleasure.
Talking Book in 1972 and Inneruisions in
1973 were like nothing before them in
soul music. They molded Stevie's unique
style. Those two albums solidified the
Stevie Wonder who now seems so com
mon only because we've grown up with
him. but who stands completely alone,
inherently inimitable.
But all that was abandoned in the Se
cret Life giant three record package. It
was so long, experimental, convoluted
and downright weird, it was boring. Es
sentially. it seemed "Little Stevie Won
der" had lost touch with his roots —
those which lie in downtown Detroit.
Hotter Than July recaptures the
Stevie Wonder we know and love. It has
just the right amount of funk and just the
right amount of soul to keep it on the
ground where we feel comfortable with
it, but at the same time, soars with
Stevie's unforgettable voice and inflec
tion, piano, synthesizer and harmonica
work. The album is vintage Stevie Won
der.
Perhaps part of what brought him
back down to earth was the cause of
Hotter Than July — to promote Stevie's

campaign to make Martin Luther King's
birthday, January 15, a national holiday.
Stevie has always been concerned with
civil rights, (Talking Book's "Big
Brother" and Innervisions's "Living For
the City" for example) but with Full
fillingness' First Finale and Songs in the
Key of Life. he seemed more preoc
cupied with songs about deeper rela
tionships and the trancendental qualities
of human existence. Or at least that's
what he said. The Secret Life of Plants
took all that a little too far.
Now he seems to have fallen com
fortably back into an earlier role — de
fender of love and black ascendence.
