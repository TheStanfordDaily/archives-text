# Shearing charms Dink

### Leo Dawber 
It is a strange thing that
George Shearing should be a
jazz musician Growing up in
England in the '30s, when jazz
could not be heard on the radio,
was not played in the clubs, and
was poorly represented on re
cords, he faced great obstacles
in becoming a competent jazz
artist. Fortunately, as a full
house at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium discovered last
Wednesday, Shearing somehow
beat those odds, and the addi
tional handicap of blindness
Perhaps the isolation from
contemporary jazz during his
formative years accounts for
Shearing s eclecticism. He
combines a sort of swing style
with touches of blues, stride,
bop and ragtime and a good dash
of classical techniques He has a
marvelous touch whether he
plays an aching ballad or a ro
mantic potboiler — there is no
question about his taste or class.
Although the song selections
consisted almost entirely of
standards, he used them mainly
as melodic guides for whatever
conception he wished to play.
Rather than using different
styles as stock gimmicks, he
was able to improvise creative
ly in all of them.
Bassist Brian Torff s general
ly melodic playing ranged from
spacey to boppish to funky, and

he demonstrated the complete
technical control one expects in
a young bass player today, as
well as some unexpected elec
tronic wizardry. Unfortunately,
his playing often sacrificed sol
id tone and musicality for light
ning speed in extremely high
registers This is a style that al
lows" the bass player as much
freedom as a horn < only recent
ly possible because of improved
electronic pick-ups), but which
loses some beautiful qualities of
the instrument There is a
trade-off between freedom and
sound, and each player must de
cide where to draw the line; to
my ears, Torff's playing suf
fered from the loss of good tone.
On the other hand, Torff
showed on a number of ballads
that he is capable of relaxed, yet
creative solos when he wishes to
play that way, and the ballads
were the musical high point of
the night. Shearing has a
penchant for moody tunes (and
moody arrangements of bright
tunes I and he graced "Have
You Met Miss Jones?" with a
touching vocal. Perhaps he was
slightly depressed that evening,
because these songs seemed
more sincere than the swinging
up-tempo selections (even in
cluding his own hit, "Lullaby in
Birdland").
Especially affecting was an
impressionistic, emotionally

stylized version of On a Clear
Day.'' (the title song of their
latest albumi. which was as
close to a classical music-like
interpretation of jazz as I have
heard (contrasting favorably
with Claude Boiling's watered
down compositions i Jazz musi
cians usually improvise upon a
pop tune like this, rendering a
new melody on the original
chord changes. Shearing, how
ever. retained the original
theme of the song and in
corporated it into a floating,
carefree style that effectively
communicated the idea of a
crisp, bright, smog-free day.
The show generally lacked
the gutsy, gutter language of
much jazz Like the musicians,
the music was dressed in tux
edos. This formality may have
been a function of the audience
— at the Concord Jazz Festival
in August, Shearing's concert
had more bite, even with much
the same material At
Dinkelspiel. there was an occa
sional touch of cuteness that dis
tracted from the overall musi
cal excellence But Shearing
must have gauged the audience
correctly, since it enjoyed the
show without reservation, to the
point of buying out the records
that were hawked in the lobby —
a sign of approbation more con
vincing than ovations and calls
for encores, no matter how loud
