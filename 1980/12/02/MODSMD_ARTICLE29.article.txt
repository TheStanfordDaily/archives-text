# Concert trio draws 'bravos' and 'huzzahs'

### Miles Rind 
The Kalichstein, Laredo,
Robinson Piano Trio presented
last Sunday at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium a threesome of ex
pressive, supremely polished
performances. The program
consisted of Mozart's Trio in B
flat Major, K. 502; Men
delssohn's Trio in C Minor, Opus
66; and Schubert's Trio in E flat
Major, Opus 100 (D.929). The
virtuosity of the individual
players was as striking as their
collective unanimity of ap
proach.
In the Mozart, where un
fortunately the cello receives a
generally subordinate role, the
trio played with classical re
straint. Laredo's violin was con

sistently pure and controlled in
tone, as it remained throughout
the concert, while Kalichstein
was the ideal chamber pianist,
keeping the dynamic response
of his instrument strictly within
Mozartean limits.
The Trio's performance of the
Mendelssohn laid a decided em
phasis upon the romantic ele
ments of this work, particularly
with respect to its dynamics.
The opening Allegro energico e
con fuoco was fiery indeed,
while the accent was on ex
pressiveness in the Andante
espressiuo that followed. The
expansive tempo taken in the
latter movement was balanced
by particularly fast tempi in the
third movement Scherzo. Al

though the finale was played
with a curious rubato in the
principal subject, the long coda
was played with an admirably
sustained intensity. Through
out, the skill of the musicians'
playing was the equal of its tem
pestuousness.
Robinson's cello, which was
perhaps not quite up to the high
standard of technical polish set
by her fellow players during the
Mendelssohn, very much came
into its own in the Schubert. She
played with surety and warmth
of tone, particularly in the solo
passages given her instrument
in the second and fourth move
ments.
Aside from Laredo's occa

sionally flubbed pizzicati and
his unwelcome toot-stamping,
the playing was again of the
highest technical caliber. One
wonders, however, whether the
romantic elements of the work
were not perhaps emphasized at
the expense of its architectonic
subtlety. The shaping of themes
in the finale, for example, was
noticeably mannered, although
they managed nonetheless to
sustain concentration through
out this long and demanding
movement.
The Trio responded to the au
dience's standing ovation with a
predictably well-done encore
performance: the Scherzo from
Mendelssohn's other piano trio,
the D minor, Opus 49.
