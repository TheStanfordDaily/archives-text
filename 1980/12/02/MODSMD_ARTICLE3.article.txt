# Popularity creates problems
## Economics Dept. overcrowded 
### Phil Fernandez 
In the wake of a growth spurt that
made economics one of the most popu
lar degrees here, the economics de
partment is struggling to maintain
course offerings and curb a worsening
student-teacher ratio, according to
members of the economics faculty.
In the past few years, the depart
ment has been forced to "reduce vari
ety and emphasize basic course offer
ings," said chairman Paul David.
Class sizes have had to be increased
and small courses and undergraduate
seminars cut out, he said.
David added he feels the depart
ment is not doing as good a job as it
could with more resources, or even as
good a job as it has done in the past.
However, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences Halsey Royden said he be
lieves the department is doing an ex
cellent job of teaching large numbers
of students."
Continuing growth
Economics has been one of the
fastest growing fields at Stanford over
f he last ten years. Between 1971 and
1975 enrollments in economics courses
increased by about 85 percent, and al
though the rate of increase has slowed
since then, the department is still
growing.
There are currently 534 under
graduates majoring in economics, up
from 379 in 1978. This makes econom
ics one of the largest departments on
campus.
David said the higher enrollments
in the economics department "reflect
the increased importance of econom
ics in our society." Economics Prof.
Michael Boskin said economics

courses are also popular because "ec
onomics is viewed as a good prepara
tion for law and business schools."
Student-teacher ratios
In the aftermath of the depart
ment's growth, it has come to have
one of the highest student-to-teacher
ratios in the University. Last year,
there were 177 economics students per
full time faculty member, up from 163
students per faculty member in
1977-78.
In individual courses, the student
teacher ratios vary from "horrendous
ones to marginally tolerable ones,"
said Boskin.
The generally-acknowledged prob
lem in reversing these trends is one of
limited resources. David pinpointed
several causes of the lack of resources
in the department.
For one, he said, the University is
somewhat limited in helping the de
partment because of the University's
Budget Equilibrium Program, which
with a few exceptions has kept the ov
erall faculty size from increasing.
"There are lots of other demands
for scarce resources," said David.
However, he said, the University "has
not yet accepted the fact that the de
partment is too small to do the
teaching job it should be doing."
Moreover he asserted the recent em
phasis on undergraduate humanities
programs has led to the channeling of
resources away from the social sci
ences.
Possible improvements
David said specific improvements
in the department should come in the
area of junior positions such as assis
tant professorships. "Additional as
sistant professors would be most re

sponsive to the desires of under
graduates," he said He also said the
department "could do well with more
teaching assistants (TA's)."
Boskin said the department is "cop
ing the best we can with current re
sources but declared that improving
the economics program here "has to
be made a very important priority in
improving undergraduate education."
Boskin said an increase amounting
to one-third the current size of the de
partment's faculty is needed over the
next few years, and acknowledged
that because the University is not add
ing faculty positions, growth in the ec
onomics faculty will have to be at the
expense of other departments.
However, Royden, who handles fun
ding for the departments in the School
of Humanities and Sciences, said he is
"not really concerned about man
power" in the economics department.
Royden also said there are current
ly several unfilled senior faculty posi
tions in the economics department,
but that the department is "looking
for just the right person."
"Not a crisis"
President Donald Kennedy also
stated the view that the economics de
partment is not an especially trouble
some area right now. "It is not what I
would call a crisis," he said, though he
added University officials will be giv
ing "serious consideration" to the
question of how to respond to growing
enrollments in the department.
Royden said the department will get
"a gradual increase in its resources"
over the next few years, but added,
"There is a great deal of inertia built
into the system" of reallocating re
sources.
