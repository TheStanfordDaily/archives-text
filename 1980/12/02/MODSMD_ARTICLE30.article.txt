Aftershocks force evacuations
Naples,ltaly — Damage from new quake after
shocks yesterday forced the closure of southern Ita
ly s famed Pompeii archeological site Thousands
living in the modern ruins of their quake-devastated
towns were evacuated, many weeping in anger and
sorrow, to hotels.
To keep warm, earthquake victims in Calabritto
set fire to piles of donated clothes which poured into
the disaster area.
The Nov. 23 quake that killed some 3000 people
dealt a serious blow to Pompeii, the bustling Roman
city buried by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in A.D.
79 It was the first natural disaster to strike the an
cient city since it was excavated in the 18th century.
Tremors yesterday prompted Prof. Fausto Zevi,
superintendent of archeology in Naples, to order the
site closed to the public indefinitely. Zevi said new
cracks appeared in hundreds of buildings and mon
uments, weakened the foundations of others and un
did earlier repairs in columns in the forum Major
damage was reported to Via dell Abbondanza. the
Stabian Baths and near the Lupanare brothel.
Although the government said nobody was being
forced to move from the worst-hit towns, many
evacuees vented their frustration and anger at the
relief officials who showed up with convoys of buses.
The freezing weather, after days of icy wind, rain
and snow, sparked complaints from residents in tent
camps. Health officials said the weather, while
helping them contain the threat of epidemic disease,
is causing pneumonia, bronchitis and other respira
tory ailments.
Fears of Jordan/Syria war rise
Damascus, Syria — Fears of a second war in the
Middle East heightened yesterday on reports that
Syria has 50,000 troops and 1200 tanks on Jordan's
border. Jordan moved up tanks and troops and said
it would not shoot first but would defend the country
against attack.
A top Soviet official was in Damascus to ratify a
Syrian-Soviet treaty and the United States con
sidered a Jordanian request for arms.
Tension between the Arab neighbors results from
conflicting positions on the Iran-Iraq war and Syrian
charges that Jordan supports Islamic fundamen
talists trying to overthrow the Syrian government.
In Washington, the Carter administration was
considering a shipment of military spare parts and
ammunition to Jordan and one U.S. official rated the
chances of a conflict at better than 50-50
Informed sources said Syria had three divisions
massed along the stretch that commands the main
highway linking Jordan and Syria. The initial
buildup of 25,000 men and 600 tanks began on Nov. 22,
the sources said.
Jordan, whose King Hussein is considered among
the most trusted Arab allies of the United States,
said it would turn Jordan into a "flaming inferno to
burn every aggressor."
Iran has 'cash for six months'
Beirut, Lebanon — A top Iranian official said yes
terday that Iran could fight Iraq for six months on
available cash reserves, without access to money
frozen in U.S. banks, gold reserves or income from
oil exports.
While Iranian and Iraqi forces reported battles
with helicopter gunships. paratroops and artillery,
Central Bank Governor Ali Nobari told the Iranian
people they "should not worry," the official Pars

news agency reported.
The agency quoted Nobari as saying Iran had cash
reserves of $6 billion, and that, "if we cannot, for po
litical reasons, free our blocked reserves, or sell a
drop of oil, and have no other exports, this reserve
could last us for six months."
" Of course, this is impossible, for we have other
expohs. plus the fact that we have gold reserves,"
he said.
Nobari's comments appeared to dim U.S. hopes
that the cost of the war might cause Iran to act
quickly to free the hostages whose capture
prompted the United States to freeze $8 billion in
Iranian assets held in U.S. banks.
The 52 American hostages, in their 394 th day of
captivity yesterday, have not yet been transferred
to the custody of the Iranian government by the mili
tants. Iran's minister of state for executive affairs
was quoted as saying.
Poland chief decries labor unions
Warsaw, Poland — Communist Party chief
Stanislaw Kania said yesterday that militant inde
pendent labor union activities are undermining
communist rule in Poland and threatening peace in
Europe.
Kania addressed the opening of a two-day plenary
session of the party's central committee and issued
a stern warning against what he described as "pres
tige or downright political strikes."
In his nationally broadcast speech, the party lead
er acknowledged the existence of the fledgling inde
pendent trade union movement and offered to coop
erate with labor leaders who show restraint.
But he added. "It is high time to sober up, to un
derstand that the basic condition and chance for a
further favorable development of the nation is an
immediate halt to activities weakening and under
mining the functioning of the (communist) people's
state."
He said such activities "threaten to eventually
destabilize the peaceful order of Europe."
Kania, named to replace Edward Gierek in Sep
tember after a wave of crippling strikes, did not
elaborate. The apparent implication was that a
direct challenge to the communist system in this
country of 35.5 million would have consequences
beyond the borders.

for the president-elect, told anxious city officials

er grants to local governments. But some city of
ficials said they were still not certain how their
towns will fare under the Republican.

know what President Reagan's programs and poli

cies will be." said Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson
"All we know is general ideology, which leaves
many people anxious, but praying."

doing so."
