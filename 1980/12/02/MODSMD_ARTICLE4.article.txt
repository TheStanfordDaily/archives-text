# Escondido residents protest higher rents

### Cici Oremland 
University officials will present a controversial
proposal for rent increases in Escondido Village to
the Board of Trustee's Committee on Finance and
Administration next Tuesday.
The proposed increase, which has provoked com
plaints from Escondido residents, would raise rents
by more than 12.5 percent over current rates, ac
cording to Ed Scoles, director of the Housing Man
agement Office.
A 3.5 percent rent increase proposal is directly at
tributable to the need to raise funds for a new 800-
resident housing structure for undergraduates
which is scheduled for completion in 1983, said
Scoles.
"We're objecting because part of the rent in
crease is going for an undergraduate facility," said
Debbie Larue, neighborhood coordinator for the
Barns highrise in Escondido. "There's a far greater
need for graduate student housing.
"About 76 percent of the undergraduates have
housing while only 28 to 30 percent of the graduates
do," Larue said.
Scoles said graduate students will benefit from
completion of the new undergraduate dormitory be
cause undergraduates will be moved out of Man
zanita trailer park and the trailers will be turned
over to graduate students.
Approximately 34U graduate students, three per

trailer, will occupy Manzanita, said Scoles. The 454
undergraduates that currently live in the trailers
will have to move out. The net undergraduate gain in
housing will therefore be 346 places, roughly equal to
that of the graduate students.
"All students share in the expansion of the sys
tem," Scoles said. He added that the new housing
project will leave the University with a $3.4 million
deficit which will force the University to operate on
a $1.5 million deficit for the three years following
completion of the structure.
Larue said the new rent increase will bring the
price of Escondido Village apartments close to the
costs of housing on the local market.
The price of a one-bedroom apartment in Escon
dido, when shared by two single students, is current
ly $132 per person per month. This price represents
an increase of nearly 14 percent over 1979-80 rents. A
rent increase of 12.5 percent would raise rents to
$148.50 per person per month. Prices for a one
bedroom apartment for married students are ap
proximately the same.
Though unable to quote specific sources, Scoles
said a one-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto runs
about $380 per month, still $80 more than the pro
posed rates.
Jerry Parks, facilities manager for Escondido

Village, pointed out that there is no longer any dis
tinction made between undergraduate and graduate
housing at Stanford, the two systems having been
merged into one.
"The distinction between undergraduates and
graduates is a common misconception, - ' Parks said.
"It's all Stanford housing."
Larue, however, said the new arrangement may
actually be harmful to graduate students. "Gradu
ate housing is supposedly totally integrated into the
undergraduate housing system, and (University of
ficials) are using this as justification for raising
housing costs," Larue declared.
She added she feels the University is advocating a
"be glad with what you have" philosophy.
Scoles acknowledged that the University still
places a greater emphasis on residential education
for undergraduates, specifically for freshman living
situations. However, he said, the Residential
Education office has tried to remedy the difference
over the last two years.
Furthermore, Scoles said, "Graduate students
need more individualized programming" than un
dergraduates.
According to Parks, University housing is still a
good deal. "We get a lot of compliments about it,"
he said.
