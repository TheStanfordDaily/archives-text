# Defense industry to boom under Reagan
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
After three "soul-wrenching" years
— years when it was forced to lay off
10.000 workers and tear down or sell
off key B-l facilities — Rockwell In
ternational's North American Air
craft Division now sees a good chance
to win a $10 billion contract to build 100
or more bombers. The contract would
mean 14,000 new jobs at the company's
plants in Southern California.
Rockwell's post-election euphoria
is being shared by defense contractors
across the country. Analysts and ex
ecutives believe that Reagan's victory
— and the election of a Republican
Senate — assure a lasting defense
spending boom that will benefit vir
tually all segments of the nation's
armament industry.
President Jimmy Carter had made
life miserable for Rockwell by can
celling production of the company's
B-l bomber. Reagan made a cam
paign issue of Carter's action and
pledged to build the B-l or another
manned bomber.
The Council on Economic
Priorities, a New York-based re
search group, which has been critical
of past defense spending proposals,
acknowledges that the political
momentum for bigger military
budgets will not end soon. "There's
just too much of a consensus building
for it," said David Gold, the council's
military research director.
But some analysts caution that the
gains may be more modest than the
current euphoric mood among the
companies would suggest, because of

the president-elect's own campaign
pledges to cut taxes and a shortage of
capacity at some defense plants.
Choices will have to be made, result
ing in big gains for some contractors,
but reverses — or at least more
modest gains — for others.
Familiar names
The list of contenders includes the
industry's familiar names — McDon
nell Douglas, General Dynamics,
Boeing, Lockheed and other giant
firms that traditionally have won
large slices of the nation's defense
dollar.
The list also includes a host of
smaller, faster-growing companies
that hold less glamourous — but equal
ly lucrative — niches in the military
marketplace.
Two typical smaller firms. Rockcor
Inc. and Criton Corp., both based in
Washington state, have enjoyed sharp
increases in revenues by developing
hardware for Chrysler Corp.'s XM-1
tank program, for example.
Defense industry analysts agree
that Reagan's first priority will be a
"quick fix" of U.S. strategic forces.
"Reagan made a campaign issue out
of the imblance of stratetic arms (fa
voring the Soviets) and I don't think he
is going to turn his back on that
ihetoric," said Wolfgang Demisch, an
analyst for the New York brokerage of
Morgan Stanley and Co.
The result, Demisch and others
said, will be acceleration of a program
launched by Carter, the MX intercon
tinental ballistic missile, and develop
