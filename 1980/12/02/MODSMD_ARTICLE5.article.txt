# Defense industry to boom under Reagan
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
After three "soul-wrenching" years
— years when it was forced to lay off
10.000 workers and tear down or sell
off key B-l facilities — Rockwell In
ternational's North American Air
craft Division now sees a good chance
to win a $10 billion contract to build 100
or more bombers. The contract would
mean 14,000 new jobs at the company's
plants in Southern California.
Rockwell's post-election euphoria
is being shared by defense contractors
across the country. Analysts and ex
ecutives believe that Reagan's victory
— and the election of a Republican
Senate — assure a lasting defense
spending boom that will benefit vir
tually all segments of the nation's
armament industry.
President Jimmy Carter had made
life miserable for Rockwell by can
celling production of the company's
B-l bomber. Reagan made a cam
paign issue of Carter's action and
pledged to build the B-l or another
manned bomber.
The Council on Economic
Priorities, a New York-based re
search group, which has been critical
of past defense spending proposals,
acknowledges that the political
momentum for bigger military
budgets will not end soon. "There's
just too much of a consensus building
for it," said David Gold, the council's
military research director.
But some analysts caution that the
gains may be more modest than the
current euphoric mood among the
companies would suggest, because of

the president-elect's own campaign
pledges to cut taxes and a shortage of
capacity at some defense plants.
Choices will have to be made, result
ing in big gains for some contractors,
but reverses — or at least more
modest gains — for others.
Familiar names
The list of contenders includes the
industry's familiar names — McDon
nell Douglas, General Dynamics,
Boeing, Lockheed and other giant
firms that traditionally have won
large slices of the nation's defense
dollar.
The list also includes a host of
smaller, faster-growing companies
that hold less glamourous — but equal
ly lucrative — niches in the military
marketplace.
Two typical smaller firms. Rockcor
Inc. and Criton Corp., both based in
Washington state, have enjoyed sharp
increases in revenues by developing
hardware for Chrysler Corp.'s XM-1
tank program, for example.
Defense industry analysts agree
that Reagan's first priority will be a
"quick fix" of U.S. strategic forces.
"Reagan made a campaign issue out
of the imblance of stratetic arms (fa
voring the Soviets) and I don't think he
is going to turn his back on that
ihetoric," said Wolfgang Demisch, an
analyst for the New York brokerage of
Morgan Stanley and Co.
The result, Demisch and others
said, will be acceleration of a program
launched by Carter, the MX intercon
tinental ballistic missile, and develop

ment of a manned bomber.
The new administration, backed by
a pro-defense Congress, will push for
rapid improvement of what Demisch
calls ' the stepchildren of the nuclear
age — the nation's conventional
forces.
Dramatic increases
Dramatic increases are expected in
production of fighter aircraft and
naval ships, two areas that analysts
say received meager funding from the
Carter administration.
Paul Nisbet, a Washington-based
analyst for the brokerage of Bache
Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., predicted a
sharp reversal of what he called
Carter's "dismantling of the tactical
fighter-attack aircraft production
capability of the United States." He
forecasts delivery of 6 700 new fighter,
attack and trainer aircraft worth
almost $130 billion during the 1980s —
a 275 percent increase over the nomi
nal value of deliveries during the last
decade.
Navy shipbuilding also will be as
signed a top priority because it has
been forced to live "on less than
peacetime rations" in recent years,
according to Demisch. With a growing
need to protect the seaborne import of
oil and other critical cargoes, analysts
expect Keagan to carry through on his
campaign promise to build up the
Navy from 500 to 600 ships.
Military electronic systems, al
ready the fastest-growing item in the
defense budget, will be purchased in
even greater numbers, analysts fore
cast. "With the Russians significantly
outgunning the United States in the
1980s, the weight of this country's de
fense has fallen, in large part, on our
superiority in the electronic warfare
and countermeasures areas," said
Michael Derchin. an analyst for Wall
Street's Oppenheimer and Co.
Delays
This emphasis on augmenting exist
ing forces could result in delays for
some new programs. "The Reagan ad
ministration will say 'Forget the
19905. We have to correct the situation
for the 19805,' " Nisbet said. "After

the picture improves for the 1980s,
they will go back to the research and
development programs for the 19905."
Most analysts agreed that one pos
sible casualty of this philosophy is the
proposed CX transport plane, center
piece of the Carter administration's
rapid-deployment force.
There will be increased op
portunities in the foreign military
market now that the Carter adminis
tration has eased its restrictive arms
export policy. "Under Reagan," said
Derchin, "that whole area will boom
again.'-'
Using this list of likely spending
priorities, analysts cite a number of
companies that seem to be best posi
tioned to benefit from the Reagan ad
ministration. They include:
—The Boeing Co., Seattle.
Boeing already is working on sever
al programs that seem to be assured of
generous funding by the new adminis
tration. and it has a good chance of
winning competitions for two huge
new projects — a manned bomber and
the CX transport plane.
—General Dynamics Corp., St.
Louis.
For the last two years. General
Dynamics has ranked as the nation's
leading defense contractor on the
strength of its diversified array of
weapons, including submarines, mis
siles and the F-16 fighter aircraft.
The company is the sole builder of
Trident nuclear submarines, a pro
gram analysts say may be accelerated
by Reagan.
—Litton Industries, Beverly Hills
Calif.
The company's Ingalls shipyard in
Pascagoula, Miss., which has de
livered nearly two-thirds of all of the
Navy's new combatant ships in the
last five years, is positioned to benefit
from Reagan's expected buildup of
naval forces.
—Lockheed Corp., Burbank, Calif.
Robert Child, Lockheed's director
of domestic marketing, said it is
"almost inevitable" that an advanced
Trident program will be funded under
the Reagan administration.

oil and other critical cargoes, analysts
expect Keagan to carry through on his
campaign promise to build up the
Navy from 500 to 600 ships.
Military electronic systems, al

defense budget, will be purchased in
even greater numbers, analysts fore

outgunning the United States in the

export policy. "Under Reagan," said
Derchin, "that whole area will boom

Using this list of likely spending
priorities, analysts cite a number of
companies that seem to be best posi
tioned to benefit from the Reagan ad
ministration. They include:
—The Boeing Co., Seattle.
Boeing already is working on sever
al programs that seem to be assured of
generous funding by the new adminis
tration. and it has a good chance of
winning competitions for two huge
new projects — a manned bomber and
the CX transport plane.
—General Dynamics Corp., St.
Louis.
For the last two years. General
Dynamics has ranked as the nation's
leading defense contractor on the
strength of its diversified array of
weapons, including submarines, mis
siles and the F-16 fighter aircraft.
The company is the sole builder of
Trident nuclear submarines, a pro
gram analysts say may be accelerated
by Reagan.
—Litton Industries, Beverly Hills
Calif.
The company's Ingalls shipyard in
Pascagoula, Miss., which has de
livered nearly two-thirds of all of the
Navy's new combatant ships in the
last five years, is positioned to benefit
from Reagan's expected buildup of
naval forces.

Robert Child, Lockheed's director
of domestic marketing, said it is
"almost inevitable" that an advanced
Trident program will be funded under
the Reagan administration.
From the Daily wire services
After three "soul-wrenching" years
— years when it was forced to lay off
10.000 workers and tear down or sell
off key B-l facilities — Rockwell In
ternational's North American Air
craft Division now sees a good chance
to win a $10 billion contract to build 100
or more bombers. The contract would
mean 14,000 new jobs at the company's
plants in Southern California.
Rockwell's post-election euphoria
is being shared by defense contractors
across the country. Analysts and ex
ecutives believe that Reagan's victory
— and the election of a Republican
Senate — assure a lasting defense
spending boom that will benefit vir
tually all segments of the nation's
armament industry.
President Jimmy Carter had made
life miserable for Rockwell by can
celling production of the company's
B-l bomber. Reagan made a cam
paign issue of Carter's action and
pledged to build the B-l or another
manned bomber.
The Council on Economic
Priorities, a New York-based re
search group, which has been critical
of past defense spending proposals,
acknowledges that the political
momentum for bigger military
budgets will not end soon. "There's
just too much of a consensus building
for it," said David Gold, the council's
military research director.
But some analysts caution that the
gains may be more modest than the
current euphoric mood among the
companies would suggest, because of

the president-elect's own campaign
pledges to cut taxes and a shortage of
capacity at some defense plants.
Choices will have to be made, result
ing in big gains for some contractors,
but reverses — or at least more
modest gains — for others.
Familiar names
The list of contenders includes the
industry's familiar names — McDon
nell Douglas, General Dynamics,
Boeing, Lockheed and other giant
firms that traditionally have won
large slices of the nation's defense
dollar.
The list also includes a host of
smaller, faster-growing companies
that hold less glamourous — but equal
ly lucrative — niches in the military
marketplace.
Two typical smaller firms. Rockcor
Inc. and Criton Corp., both based in
Washington state, have enjoyed sharp
increases in revenues by developing
hardware for Chrysler Corp.'s XM-1
tank program, for example.
Defense industry analysts agree
that Reagan's first priority will be a
"quick fix" of U.S. strategic forces.
"Reagan made a campaign issue out
of the imblance of stratetic arms (fa
voring the Soviets) and I don't think he
is going to turn his back on that
ihetoric," said Wolfgang Demisch, an
analyst for the New York brokerage of
Morgan Stanley and Co.
The result, Demisch and others
said, will be acceleration of a program
launched by Carter, the MX intercon
tinental ballistic missile, and develop

ment of a manned bomber.
The new administration, backed by
a pro-defense Congress, will push for
rapid improvement of what Demisch
calls ' the stepchildren of the nuclear
age — the nation's conventional
forces.
Dramatic increases
Dramatic increases are expected in
production of fighter aircraft and
naval ships, two areas that analysts
say received meager funding from the
Carter administration.
Paul Nisbet, a Washington-based
analyst for the brokerage of Bache
Halsey Stuart Shields Inc., predicted a
sharp reversal of what he called
Carter's "dismantling of the tactical
fighter-attack aircraft production
capability of the United States." He
forecasts delivery of 6 700 new fighter,
attack and trainer aircraft worth
almost $130 billion during the 1980s —
a 275 percent increase over the nomi
nal value of deliveries during the last
decade.
Navy shipbuilding also will be as
signed a top priority because it has
been forced to live "on less than
peacetime rations" in recent years,
according to Demisch. With a growing
need to protect the seaborne import of
oil and other critical cargoes, analysts
