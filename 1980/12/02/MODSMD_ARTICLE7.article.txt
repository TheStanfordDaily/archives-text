# Insistence on preserving lifestyle causes problems
## Afghan refugees settle in Pakistan 
### Los Angeles Times 
Khar, Pakistan — The mud walls sprout
ing up around the tents at one of the pitiful
Afghan refugee camps sprinkled along the
hillsides and riverbeds of this remote fron
tier valley do not look like much, but they
say a great deal.
The walls are a sign of permanence. Their
construction is one more signal that the esti
mated 1 million refugees who have fled
their homes and the war in Afghanistan plan
to stay.
Su will the thousands who continue to
stream through the mountain passes each
week to the safety of Pakistan.
As the Soviet attempt to crush the na
tionwide insurgency in Afghanistan settles
into a war of attrition, officials from Paki
stan's martial-law regime and international
relief officials are looking at the refugees as
at least a semi-permanent fixture.
Pakistani landlords, who initially per
mitted refugees to camp and graze their
livestock free of charge on their land, have
begun to seek government compensation.
Government plans for permanent housing
are reportedly under active consideration,
and discussions have been held about how to
absorb refugees into the economy.
"They (the Pakistani government) are
looking for job areas that don't compete
with the local population.'' one interna
tiortal aid official said.
Refugee problem
The permanence of the Afghan refugees,
scattered in makeshift camps virtually the
entire length of Pakistan s 1200-mile-long
burder with Afghanistan, further com
plicates a refugee problem already con
sidered extremely difficult by seasoned in
ternational experts.
Few of the people coming from Afghan
istan have anv formal identification, and

their inbred aversion to officialdom has
made it difficult for Pakistani authorities to
deal with them.
A further complication is that many refu
gees, such as those here in the Bajaur Val
ley around Khar, have settled only a few
miles from the border in tribal areas that
traditionally have submitted to only the
barest of Pakistani government controls.
Fearful of adding to tensions among high
ly independent, volatile Afghans as well as
their equally free-spirited local coun
terparts. Pakistani government officials
have imposed only limited restrictions on
the refugees.
Little organization
The 80 refugee camps established in Paki
stan are camps in name only, according to
officials from international agencies deal
ing with the problem.
"Usually, a refugee population is
marshaled into some kind of order so you
know where people are and how to dis
tribute supplies," a representative of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ex
plained.
Extremely touchy about security in its
tribal belt, Pakistan has also refused to per
mit international relief agencies to estab
lish their own facilities there. Neither In
ternational Red Cross doctors nor techni
cians from other international organiza
tions are permitted to work from bases in
those areas.
Pakistani government officials also are
in charge of registering refugees, and there
have been charges that camp officials have
inflated the number of refugees to collect
money, food and supplies themselves.
Corruption tempting
With every refugee allotted $5 cash per
month, plus food and shelter, temptation is
great, especially among unsupervised low

er-level camp officials who earn only $50 to
$60 per month.
It is generally believed that refugees have
also exaggerated their numbers to obtain
extra assistance. One of the conditions that
precludes accurate counting is the refugees'
adherence to strict Moslem codes that pro
hibit Pakistani officials from entering tents
to count women and children.
Preserve way of life
"We left our homes to prevent the Rus
sians from violating our way of life; we
must preserve it here,"' he explained.
'Pakistani government as well as U.N. of
ficials say they have ordered a new census.
They also say they believe that over
registration abuses are at least partly bal
anced by an undetermined number of refu
gees who. out ot pride or suspicion, have not
registered.
Despite the general lack of control, ob
servers believe that corruption is not yet ov
erwhelming.
However, in an attempt to gain better
control over its ballooning refugee popu
lation. the Pakistani government has or
dered a major reinforcement and re
organization of the flimsy machinery in
itially set up to handle the problem.
Attempts will be made to formalize
camps, restricting their population to 5000
each, and discouraging mobility by insisting
that refugees draw their assistance only
from the camp where they registered.
There is some concern, however, as to
whether the reorganization will help ac
celerate the flow of medical aid to the refu
gees — currently restricted by a Pakistani
reluctance to permit international medical
experts to work in tribal areas and by the
Moslem practice of purdah, which calls for
the strict seclusion of women from out
siders.

camps, restricting their population to 5000
each, and discouraging mobility by insisting
that refugees draw their assistance only
from the camp where they registered.
There is some concern, however, as to
whether the reorganization will help ac
celerate the flow of medical aid to the refu
gees — currently restricted by a Pakistani
reluctance to permit international medical
experts to work in tribal areas and by the
Moslem practice of purdah, which calls for
the strict seclusion of women from out
siders.
Khar, Pakistan — The mud walls sprout
ing up around the tents at one of the pitiful
Afghan refugee camps sprinkled along the
hillsides and riverbeds of this remote fron
tier valley do not look like much, but they
say a great deal.
The walls are a sign of permanence. Their
construction is one more signal that the esti
mated 1 million refugees who have fled
their homes and the war in Afghanistan plan
to stay.
Su will the thousands who continue to
stream through the mountain passes each
week to the safety of Pakistan.
As the Soviet attempt to crush the na
tionwide insurgency in Afghanistan settles
into a war of attrition, officials from Paki
stan's martial-law regime and international
relief officials are looking at the refugees as
at least a semi-permanent fixture.
Pakistani landlords, who initially per
mitted refugees to camp and graze their
livestock free of charge on their land, have
begun to seek government compensation.
Government plans for permanent housing
are reportedly under active consideration,
and discussions have been held about how to
absorb refugees into the economy.
"They (the Pakistani government) are
looking for job areas that don't compete
with the local population.'' one interna
tiortal aid official said.
Refugee problem
The permanence of the Afghan refugees,
scattered in makeshift camps virtually the
entire length of Pakistan s 1200-mile-long
burder with Afghanistan, further com
plicates a refugee problem already con
sidered extremely difficult by seasoned in
ternational experts.
Few of the people coming from Afghan
istan have anv formal identification, and

their inbred aversion to officialdom has
made it difficult for Pakistani authorities to
deal with them.
A further complication is that many refu
gees, such as those here in the Bajaur Val
ley around Khar, have settled only a few
miles from the border in tribal areas that
traditionally have submitted to only the
barest of Pakistani government controls.
Fearful of adding to tensions among high
ly independent, volatile Afghans as well as
their equally free-spirited local coun
terparts. Pakistani government officials
have imposed only limited restrictions on
the refugees.
Little organization
The 80 refugee camps established in Paki
stan are camps in name only, according to
officials from international agencies deal
ing with the problem.
"Usually, a refugee population is
marshaled into some kind of order so you
know where people are and how to dis
tribute supplies," a representative of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees ex
plained.
Extremely touchy about security in its
tribal belt, Pakistan has also refused to per
mit international relief agencies to estab
lish their own facilities there. Neither In
ternational Red Cross doctors nor techni
cians from other international organiza
tions are permitted to work from bases in
those areas.
Pakistani government officials also are
in charge of registering refugees, and there
have been charges that camp officials have
inflated the number of refugees to collect
money, food and supplies themselves.
Corruption tempting
With every refugee allotted $5 cash per
month, plus food and shelter, temptation is
great, especially among unsupervised low

er-level camp officials who earn only $50 to
$60 per month.
It is generally believed that refugees have
also exaggerated their numbers to obtain
extra assistance. One of the conditions that
precludes accurate counting is the refugees'
adherence to strict Moslem codes that pro
hibit Pakistani officials from entering tents
to count women and children.
Preserve way of life
"We left our homes to prevent the Rus
sians from violating our way of life; we
must preserve it here,"' he explained.
'Pakistani government as well as U.N. of
ficials say they have ordered a new census.
They also say they believe that over
registration abuses are at least partly bal
anced by an undetermined number of refu
gees who. out ot pride or suspicion, have not
registered.
Despite the general lack of control, ob
servers believe that corruption is not yet ov
erwhelming.
However, in an attempt to gain better
control over its ballooning refugee popu
lation. the Pakistani government has or
dered a major reinforcement and re
organization of the flimsy machinery in
itially set up to handle the problem.
