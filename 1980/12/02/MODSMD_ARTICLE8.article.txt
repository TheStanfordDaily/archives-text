# USSR troops on alert near Poland
## 
### Washington Post 
Moscow — Soviet military re
servists in the strategic
Carpathian military district
bordering Poland were ac
tivated in great haste last Au
gust and remain on duty, ac
cording to accounts reaching
here from the sensitive, closed
region
Unofficial sources say a large
but unknown number of re
servists under age 35 have been
told they will stay on active duty
at least through the end of 1980.
The Carpathian area, with a ma
jor headquarters in Lvov close
to the Polish border, was an im
portant staging area for the 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia,
which the region also borders.
A Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman flatly denied the re
port, which cannot be independ
ently verified. "There has been
no urgent mobilization of the re
serves and no expectation in this
respect," he declared
But informed foreign sources
here say the reports, rich in de
tail. are consistent with recent
irregularities believed seen in
Soviet troop-rotation patterns,
and with other signs of in
creased readiness among units
stationed in western Russia.
The State Department in
Washington said last week Sovi
et troops near the Polish border

had been put on a state of alert
higher than usual, and that regu
lar units had increased man
power to full strength. How
ever, the department spokes
man. John Trattner, said there
were no signs of plans to invade
Poland.
The reports reaching here
from unofficial Soviet sources,
who cannot be identified, tend to
support that view. They say an
air of emergency that gripped
the region in late August when
the Polish crisis over the inde
pendent trade union movement
was at its height has subsided,
and some unneeded reserves
have been released to civilian
duties.
But, these sources insist, the
original call-up three and a half
months ago occurred in a state
of extreme urgency, with police
stopping trucks and private cars
on the spot and sending them to
special collection points, where
drivers and vehicles were given
assignments by military spe
cialists.
Quick activation
Reservists are said to have
been activated in the so-called
Class 1 category (up to age 35).
Many did not have time to notify
families or employers, and
some are said to have com
plained bitterly they or their
families were sick but weren't
given time required under Sovi
et regulations to gather docu
ments to prove they should not
be activated.
Reliable foreign sources here
said similar abrupt tactics were
used to commandeer trucks
prior to the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan last December. So
viet civilian transport is con
sidered part of the country's
emergency transportation sys
tem, usable in any crisis.
Foreign sources emphasize
that a reserve call-up even in in
itial haste does not mean an in
vasion will follow. It is viewed
by these sources as no more
than the minimum prudent pre
caution if military force even
tually is to be applied to a situ
ation such as Poland, where an
invasion could mean massive
troop movements.
But the Polish crisis has
moved into a series of political
confrontations between War
saw communists loyal to Mos
cow and the increasingly pow
erful independent unions. Mos
cow is engaged in a propaganda
war of nerves with the Poles but
has given Polish party boss
Stanislaw Kania strong en
dorsement, and food and eco
nomic aid.
No press coverage
There has been no mention of
a mobilization or call-up in the
Soviet press, unlike the days
preceding the Czech invasion.
While it is said by the unofficial
Soviet sources that the reason
for the activation in Carpathia
has never been mentioned, peo
ple in that border region, who
can receive Polish and Czech
television, know the reason.
Crossing point
The Carpathian region is gen
erally closed to foreigners with
the exception of Lvov and sever
al smaller cities to the south
down to Chop, the principal
crossing point into

Czechslovakia and Hungary.
Western military attaches have
been able to arrange only a few
trips into Carpathian open cities
in the past five months.
The Soviet sources say some
reservists have been instructed
in truck convoy methods and
that in late summer lines of
dozens of vehicles could be seen
on the highways, though lately
this is said to have all but
ceased. The sources also assert
there has been weapons training
with live ammunition and sim
ulated field operations reviewed
by senior officers. Foreign
sources here consider the asser
tion of weapons training less
credible than other parts of
these unofficial accounts.
The Carpathian military dis
trict is one of 16 in the Soviet Un
ion and is thought by some
sources here to have about sev
en regular ground divisions,
apart from rocket forces and air
support. A Soviet motorized ri
fle or armored division numbers
about 13,000 men.
There have been no reports
here of similar reserve call-ups
anywhere else in the Soviet
frontier regions. Conventional
wisdom here is that the most
promising line of advance for
Soviet forces into Poland would
be from the Baltic region,
across the flat Baltic plain west
to Gdansk and south to Warsaw.
The Carpathian region, now
part of the Soviet Ukrainian Re
public, has changed hands nu
merous times in past centuries
and was formally ceded by
Czechoslovakia to the USSR in
1945.

ion and is thought by some
sources here to have about sev
en regular ground divisions,
apart from rocket forces and air
support. A Soviet motorized ri
fle or armored division numbers
about 13,000 men.
There have been no reports
here of similar reserve call-ups
anywhere else in the Soviet
frontier regions. Conventional
wisdom here is that the most
promising line of advance for
Soviet forces into Poland would
be from the Baltic region,
across the flat Baltic plain west
to Gdansk and south to Warsaw.
The Carpathian region, now
part of the Soviet Ukrainian Re
public, has changed hands nu
merous times in past centuries
and was formally ceded by
Czechoslovakia to the USSR in
1945.
Moscow — Soviet military re
servists in the strategic
Carpathian military district
bordering Poland were ac
tivated in great haste last Au
gust and remain on duty, ac
cording to accounts reaching
here from the sensitive, closed
region
Unofficial sources say a large
but unknown number of re
servists under age 35 have been
told they will stay on active duty
at least through the end of 1980.
The Carpathian area, with a ma
jor headquarters in Lvov close
to the Polish border, was an im
portant staging area for the 1968
invasion of Czechoslovakia,
which the region also borders.
A Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman flatly denied the re
port, which cannot be independ
ently verified. "There has been
no urgent mobilization of the re
serves and no expectation in this
respect," he declared
But informed foreign sources
here say the reports, rich in de
tail. are consistent with recent
irregularities believed seen in
Soviet troop-rotation patterns,
and with other signs of in
creased readiness among units
stationed in western Russia.
The State Department in
Washington said last week Sovi
et troops near the Polish border

had been put on a state of alert
higher than usual, and that regu
lar units had increased man
power to full strength. How
ever, the department spokes
man. John Trattner, said there
were no signs of plans to invade
Poland.
The reports reaching here
from unofficial Soviet sources,
who cannot be identified, tend to
support that view. They say an
air of emergency that gripped
the region in late August when
the Polish crisis over the inde
pendent trade union movement
was at its height has subsided,
and some unneeded reserves
have been released to civilian
duties.
But, these sources insist, the
original call-up three and a half
months ago occurred in a state
of extreme urgency, with police
stopping trucks and private cars
on the spot and sending them to
special collection points, where
drivers and vehicles were given
assignments by military spe
cialists.
Quick activation
Reservists are said to have
been activated in the so-called
Class 1 category (up to age 35).
Many did not have time to notify
families or employers, and
some are said to have com
plained bitterly they or their
families were sick but weren't
given time required under Sovi
et regulations to gather docu
ments to prove they should not
be activated.
Reliable foreign sources here
said similar abrupt tactics were
used to commandeer trucks
prior to the Soviet invasion of

Afghanistan last December. So
viet civilian transport is con
sidered part of the country's
emergency transportation sys
tem, usable in any crisis.
Foreign sources emphasize
that a reserve call-up even in in
itial haste does not mean an in
vasion will follow. It is viewed
by these sources as no more
than the minimum prudent pre
caution if military force even
tually is to be applied to a situ
ation such as Poland, where an
invasion could mean massive
troop movements.
But the Polish crisis has
moved into a series of political
confrontations between War
saw communists loyal to Mos
cow and the increasingly pow
erful independent unions. Mos
cow is engaged in a propaganda
war of nerves with the Poles but
has given Polish party boss
Stanislaw Kania strong en
dorsement, and food and eco
nomic aid.
No press coverage
There has been no mention of
a mobilization or call-up in the
Soviet press, unlike the days
preceding the Czech invasion.
While it is said by the unofficial
Soviet sources that the reason
for the activation in Carpathia
has never been mentioned, peo
ple in that border region, who
can receive Polish and Czech
television, know the reason.
Crossing point
The Carpathian region is gen
erally closed to foreigners with
the exception of Lvov and sever
al smaller cities to the south
down to Chop, the principal
crossing point into

Czechslovakia and Hungary.
Western military attaches have
been able to arrange only a few
trips into Carpathian open cities
in the past five months.
The Soviet sources say some
reservists have been instructed
in truck convoy methods and
that in late summer lines of
dozens of vehicles could be seen
on the highways, though lately
this is said to have all but
ceased. The sources also assert
there has been weapons training
with live ammunition and sim
ulated field operations reviewed
by senior officers. Foreign
sources here consider the asser
tion of weapons training less
credible than other parts of
these unofficial accounts.
