# Blindings by police officers may create tension in India
## 
### Washington Post 
New Delhi — Indian Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi said yesterday she "felt physicially
sick" when she learned of the deliberate blind
ing by police of at least 31 prisoners as a law
and-order measure and said she is donating
almost $'2000 to each of the men.
The government, defending itself in both
houses of Parliament, also announced the ar
rest of 14 policemen in the eastern Indian dis
trict of Bhagalpur, where the blindings took
place, and Home Minister Zail Singh promised
punishments would reach to the very top of the
state of Bihar's police establishment if they
were involved.
"Our heads hang in shame at the dastardly
act," Singh told the Lok Sabha, the lower house
of Parliament, where the issue was brought to
the floor by five opposition members who tried
to tie the police atrocities to Mrs. Gandhi's rul
ing Congress-I (for Indira) party.
The government also said it was sending a
team of top eye specialists to Bhagalpur, a dis
trict of 2 million located 180 miles northwest of
Calcutta that is known both for its high crime
rate and its extra-legal methods of law en
forcement, to see if sight could be restored
medically to any of the blinded men at govern
ment expense.
So far. though, only low-level police officers
have been charged, despite accusations that
the blindings had been encouraged from the

top. The police superintendent in Bhagalpur,
tor instance, was not arrested; he was trans
ferred to headquarters.
While contributions of close to $2000 may not
sound like much in the West, that money is
more than 10 years of wages for a majority of
residents in this country, where the annual per
capita income is $160.
While opposition members called for a par
liamentary inquiry into the blindings, the gov
ernment said that Bihar chief minister Jagan
nath Mishra has already appointed a commit
tee headed by an opposition member of the
state assembly to conduct an investigation.
But Supreme Court Chief Justice Y. V. Chan
drachud, saying that the report of the doctors
testifying at a hearing for 15 of the blinded pris
oners seeking their release from jail "will
shock the conscience of mankind," ordered
two court officials to go to the Bhagalpur pris
on this week to get first-hand information.
The blinding of the accused criminals by po
lice, first revealed by the Indian Express
newspaper 10 days ago, has now become a ma
jor cause celebre.
Unlike other atrocities that have come to
light in recent months — Hindu-Moslem kill
ings, the slaughter of Bengali immigrants by
tribals in Tripura and numerous reported
cases of police looting and rape — the blindings
have not vet become a partisan political issue.
