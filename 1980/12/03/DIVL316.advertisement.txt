1 "Cognitive Illusions 1
I Judgment and Choice" I
M Studies of judgment and decision making under uncertainty show that people follow v
m approximation procedures, or heuristics, in order to simplify the task of prediction V
M and choice. Although these heuristics are generally helpful, they also lead to severe ■
m and systematic biases in judgments of lay people and experts alike. Some heuristic ■
M principles of judgment and choice are illustrated and their consequences are de- ■
m scribed. These include: the over-estimation of the probability of detailed representa- ■
m tive scenarios; the failure to appreciate the laws of chance, and the dependence of ■
M preferences on the framing of the options. Some implications of these findings are M
■ explored. ■
