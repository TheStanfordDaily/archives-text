# U.S. warns Soviets of 'severe' response to Polish intervention
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” The White House and
the incoming Reagan administration
bluntly warned the Soviet Union yes
terday that Russian military interven
tion in Roland would have the gravest
and most widespread consequences.
Reporters called in unexpectedly to
a White House briefing by presidential
press secretary Jody Powell late yes
terday afternoon were told that "one
thing they (the Soviets) can know with
certainty is the nature of the conse
quences which would flow if there is
intervention in or invasion of Poland.
"They would be most serious and
adverse." Powell said, "both for
East-West relations in general and in
particular for relations between the
U.S. and Soviet Union."
Powell said the situation had been
discussed with advisers in the incom
ing administration of President-elect
Ronald Reagan, adding that "it would
be a serious mistake for any govern
ment. for any nation, under any cir
cumstance to assume that a period of
transition between one administration
and the next . . . that the American
government would lack either the will
or the ability to respond appropriate
ly." Powell did not say what the U.S.
response might be.
Earlier yesterday, the senior for
eign policy adviser to Reagan. Rich
ard Allen, said on the NBC-TV To
day show that "the consequences of
an invasion would be severe and long
lasting. It could border on wrecking
relations for a long time. I trust this
will not happen."
At the same time, other U.S. of
ficials said privately that Soviet ef
forts over the past three months to im
prove the combat readiness of their
forces stationed near Poland have
progressed to a point where the warn
ing time that Poland, or the West,
would have of such an attack is now
less than a week.
The view is widespread among sen
ior U.S. officials that the Soviets are

fully aware of the extraordinary costs
they would pay if they did invade Po
land, that Moscow clearly would pre
fer not to and would do so only as a last
resort if convinced that communist
control over Poland was about to be
lost. Senior officials say there is no
evidence that Moscow has made a de
cision to intervene militarily.
Nevertheless, the view is also wide
ly held among senior U.S. officials and
foreign diplomats that if the Soviets
become convinced that the continuing
confrontation between the newly inde
pendent trade unions and the com
munist government in Warsaw is get
ting completely out of hand and gov
ernment control is about to be lost,
then Moscow will move militarily if
necessary.
The Central Committee of the
Polish Communist Party, meeting
against the backdrop of this rising
speculation in the West about possible
Soviet intervention, heard strongly
worded warnings of "coun
terrevolution" and "imperialist sub
version" yesterday.
A relatively tough line appeared to
be emerging from speeches to the
plenum, with even noted reformists
such as Mieczvslaw Rakowski. the
editor of the weekly magazine
I'olityka, attacking the newly -estab
lished independent trade union feder
ation Solidarity. There was no sugges
tion of a major change of political
course bv the party's top policy-mak
ing body.
Despite the concern expressed in
the West, there is little obvious ten
sion here among either officials or or
dinary Poles about reported troop
movements on the country's borders.
The feeling among most Western
analysts in Warsaw is that, while a So
viet invasion cannot be ruled out in the
long term, at present the Kremlin is
still seeking to influence the policies
of the Polish leadership and warning
the Polish people of the dangers of
pushing too far.

A sign that the Polish Communist
Party remains committed to reform
was provided by the election of a com
mission. headed by party leader
Stanislaw Kania. to prepare for an ex
traordinary party congress to be held
around March 1981. The congress, the
party's supreme organ, will have the
task of approving an entirely new po
litical program.
The choice of date represents a
compromise, since many rank-and
file party organizations had demanded
that the congress be convened by Jan
uary. Hard-liners in the party ap
paratus, many of whom stand to lose
their jobs in the event of fresh elec
tions. had argued for as long a delay as
possible.
One of the most outspoken speeches
during the debate came from the in
tenor minister. Miroslaw Milewski.
who said Solidarity had been in

Political Science Assoc. Prof. Nannerl Keohane, shown
above in a "Daily" interview, was appointed yesterday to
filtrated by anti-socialist elements
who wanted to use the union for their
own purposes.
"There are quite a few people
hostile to socialism in Poland.'"
Milewski said. "They attach definite
calculations and hopes to the creation
of a state of tension and anarchy.
Some of them, in close cooperation
with imperialist intelligence services
and subversion centers, have at
tempted to implement a program of
overthrowing the state and taking
over power in Poland."
It is estimated here by U.S. special
ists that the Soviets wouid have to
count on resistance by the Polish pop
ulation and possibly by the Polish
army, and that Moscow would need at

least 80 divisions, more than 300.000
men. in such an invasion force, a fig
ure that dramatizes the potential
scope of a confrontation.
European diplomats here and some
senior U.S. specialists said privately
they believe there is increasing fear in
the Soviet Union and in the communist
governments of the other East Eu
ropean members of the Warsaw Pact
that the new Polish government of
Stanislaw Kania will not be able to
cope with the continuing strains of
spreading political demands being
made by the unions. It is clear from
denunciations of the union activities in
the official press of East Germany
and Czechoslovakia that the entire
pact sees "the danger of infection"
and similar unrest spreading through
those countries.
