Washington — Buying a computer is like
purchasing a car when you go looking
you're going to find a variety of makes and
models — all of which have optional ac
cessories.
According to computer writer Robert
Perry, more than a dozen companies make
home computers and more than 100 sell
computer components.
Home computers - small enough to be
practical and cheap enough to be affordable
— first came on the market in a big way in
1977. Since then, an estimated 500,000 have
been sold That figure is growing by 40.000 to
50,000 a month.
By 1995. half the homes in America are
expected to have one And that's "the most
conservative prediction." says Perrv
Many owners buy their computers, they
say. "for the tun." or "to play with" — at a
price ranging from about $500 to $2000 or
more, for a viable machine and accessories.
But to Perry, who also wrote the first Mech
anix Illustrated (iuide to Personal Com
puters, their value goes well beyond that.
"For a family," he says, "'the most im
portant thing is what it can do in terms of
education for the children — and to acquaint
adults with what computers are all about."
Since computers are fast becoming a part
of our lives, people have to approach the
purchase of one. he says, "as an investment
in their children's future.
"If they're not literate with the com
puter. they're not going to get jobs 10 or 20
years from now. There's going to be an ex
plosive growth in computers in the next 20
years. They will be missing out on fantastic
career opportunities."
Among the handiest "plug-in-and-go"
makes — comprising "more than 90 percent
of all home-computer markets"he —he lists
Radio Shack TRS-80. Commodore PET, Ap
ple II Plus. Ohio Scientific Challenger,
Compucolor 11. Exidy Sorcerer and Atari
