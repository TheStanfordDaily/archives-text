## Dale Gieringer 'Not one red cent for tribute' 
### 
The Iranian demands tor releasing the hostages
recall a famous popular slogan from American
history In 1797. an American delegation went to
Paris to negotiate a diplomatic dispute with the
French revolutionary government. The French
position was to threaten the U.S. with demands
for money. When this news was published in the
American press, the popular cry rang out. "Mil
lions for defense, but not one red cent for trib
ute!"
Tribute, or more accurately ransom, is implied
in at least two of Iran's demands: first, return of
the shah's wealth, to the extent that it is ill-gotten,
might rightfully be returned to Iran. In contrast
the American claims include many apparently le
gitimate suits by private companies whose hold
ings were seized by the Khomeini government.
In both cases, it is significant that Iran is effec
tively demanding* restitution not from the U.S.
government, whose employees it holds, but rather
from private parties under U.S. jurisdiction. For
tunately. the latter are protected by the courts, as
it is a fundamental principle of U.S.. if not Ira
nian. law. that the powers of the state are limited
by constitutional considerations of due process.
Unfortunately, as our emissary Warren Christ
opher was no doubt at pains to explain to the Ira
nians in Algiers, this poses considerable problems
in coming lo terms with Iran.
It should be noted that the rest of the Iranian de
mands are for the most part not exceptionable.
That the U.S. should not intervene in Iranian in
ternal affairs is a principle which should have
been recognized long ago. That Iranian assets
should be unfrozen is presumable a matter of due
course.
There is another demand deserving of con
sideration that was. ironically, dropped by Iran,
namely that the U.S. should apologize for support
ing the shah. It is reported that the Iranians
thought it was politically unrealistic to demand an
apology. Perhaps they were right, but there is still
no reason why we might not have said. "We are
sorry. We had hoped that in helping the shah we

would also be helping Iran Apparently, we were
wrong Such an apology would of course have
merited some reciprocation from Iran.
Nevertheless, words are cheap when it comes
to ransom. American claims are said to amount to
somewhat less than the $6 billion worth of Iranian
frozen assets. The wealth of the shah, if it can ever
be located, has been rumored to be somewhat
greater.
As for the latter, the U.S. has nothing to gain by
abandoning its traditional skepticism regarding
the rights of royalty. Due process must be main
tained. but there is no reason that the U.S. At
torney General's office should not provide as
sistance in advancing Iran's claims in court.
On the other hand, there is no grounds what
soever for the U.S. to deprecate any legitimate
private claims against the government of Iran. If
anything, there would seem to be ground for addi
tional claims on the part of the hostages for dam
ages suffered during their captivity.
It has been darkly suggested that there are le
gal precedents which would allow the U.S. gov
ernment to assume the financial burden of claims
against Iran Nothing, however, could be more un
just than for the government to adopt a policy of
ransoming its employees at taxpayers' expense,
nor could anything serve as a worse incentive
against future taking of hostages.
This does not mean that the hostages must be
abandoned There is no reason why their friends
and relatives might not organize a drive for
private contributions towards their release.
However, as official representatives of the
United States, it is essential that the hostages not
be released in a manner that would compromise
the principles of 1797. Paradoxically, if our gov
ernment is not powerful enough to rescue its rep
resentatives abroad, the interest of Americans is
best served by having a government which is not
powerful enough to ransom them.
