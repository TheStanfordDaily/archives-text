Coy about it?
In his column "Don't overem
phaize the sexual" (Daily, Nov.
25), Stuart Reges is con
temptuous of the attitude that it
is "okay to be gay as long as you
keep it in the bedroom." How
ever. he seems to have this
same attitude himself. At the
end of his article, he doesn't
want to be accused of being
overtly sexual, just overtly gay.
He also enjoys flirting with oth
er men around campus. I guess
this means that being coyly sex
ual is fine, but being overtly sex
ual is not. since it "overem
phasizes the sexual."
One way to keep sex on every
one's mind, and also to make
sex more fascinating, is to be
coy about it. Secrecy just adds
to the intrigue. Why make shar
ing an orgasm with someone
into such a mysterious event?

Blind and shallow
People who agree with
Michael Selmi that "rape is a
serious problem but by and
large it is not a problem caused
by Stanford men, and certainly
it is a problem that is isolated in
a select group of men" not only
lack any broad understanding of
the crime, but are as guilty of
perpetuating rape as are the
rapists.
Selmi's defensive rebuttal to
Leah Halper's, mistrust of all
men as potential rapists shows a
dangerous and shallow miscon
ception about the nature and
cause of rape.
Rape is not essentially a sex
ual crime. Rape is a societal

crime, perpetuated by a widely
accepted attitude toward wom
en as objects. Women in our so
ciety are not viewed as auton
omous individuals. They are re
gards! as weaker and less
capaDie beings, useful for the
support and satisfaction of the
men to whom they belong.
Some men choose to get their
women by force (i.e. rape) rath
er than through more socially
acceptable means. Such acts
are not aberrations committed
only by insane or deranged men,
but simply extensions of our so
ciety's apparent conviction that
women are entities to be used
(some call it "enjoyed" or "ap
preciated" ) by men.
This attitude is the essence of
discrimination against women,
and it is expressed daily in all
aspects of Stanford life. Selmi's
claim that "Stanford students
are not the ones who dis
criminate against women" is
blatantly ridiculous to all but
those blinded by their own de
fensiveness.
True, most men are not
rapists. However, every person,
male or female, who refuses to
deal with women as autonomous
individuals, who regards them
instead only as mothers, daugh
ters. wives, girlfriends, mis
tresses — in short, as objects,
important only through their
connection to men — is as guilty
as any rapist.
Michael Selmi. you deserve to
feel guilty, not for your male
ness but for blindness and shal
lowness. And that is not Leah
Halper's fault.

Evaluations
I am sorry to have offended
Kim Halbert in my letter (Dai
ly, Nov. 20), but I stand by my
assertion that students who are
required to take an unpopular
course rate instructors who
spoon feed them higher than
those who insist on independent
thinking. As a consequence, in
structors who fear low ratings
may be tempted to water down
their courses. This is one of the
dangers inherent in student
evaluations.
My main point, however, is
that evaluations are a poor
measure of teaching per
formance. Halbert did not ad
dress this issue. Instead she
took my statement out of con
text. and at one point in her let
ter managed to attribute to me
the belief that all students pre
fer to be spoon fed. and called
this an unfair generalization
(which it obviously is).
She also took a swipe at the
concept of a research university
in which "researchers double as
professors." I do not doubt that
there are good researchers who
are poor teachers. However,
many of Stanford's best teach
ers do research and. by virtue of
their research, are able to im
part a great deal of interest and
excitement into their courses.
Having done my pedagogical
duty in answering Halbert, I
will now get back to my re
search. I hope that others who
are moved to criticize my posi
tion will confine their remarks
to the question of whether or not
student evaluations are a re
liable measure of teaching per
formance.
