## Understanding the remnants of sexism 
### 
Michael Selmi's response to
Leah Halper's columns (Daily
Nov. 26) shows that he has fun
damentally misread her
purpose and meaning. Halper
does not "hate men", nor does
she level unwarranted accusa
tions against particular men or
against men in general.
She describes, as I read her. a
society in which men have real
privileges and advantages over
women. Some men have shaped
this sort of society. Nearly all
men. intentionally or not. bene
fit from living in such a society.
Every man ought to reflect seri
ously on the origins and justifi
ability of his own attitudes and
actions towards women. In none
of these claims is Halper
"blatantly discriminatory," as
Selmi suggests.
The fact that Halper's col
umns make Selmi "feel guilty"
and "offended" is not evidence
that they are discriminatory. It
may be evidence that they are
right. It is very difficult, but
very important, to avoid feeling
defensive Avhen criticism
strikes too close to home. And it
is essential that we give
criticism due consideration

without misinterpreting it.
Halper never says " that she
could not trust any man because
she feared that he might want to
rape her.'' What she says is that
most men. by virtue of their
greater strength, are physically
capable of rape or violent abuse
and that most women must deal
with the threat of rape or abuse,
even if they do so by trying to ig
nore the problem.
When Selmi says that rape "is
not a problem caused by Stan
ford men" but "is isolated in a
select group of men," he takes
the easy way out. How different
from violent rape are cases of
getting sexual favors through
manipulation, bribery, coer
cion. or subtle pressure and
"persuasion?" Once a man
thinks of sex as something to
"get from " a woman, he differs
from the rapist only by method.
Yes. even Stanford men should
take this accusation seriously.
What Halper says is that she
wonders if even her closest
male friends are capable of
rape. I wonder about that too; I
wonder about myself. Don't
you?
Nor does Halper say that

Thanksgiving is a holiday only
for "white, affluent, males."
What she says is that for poor
and minority families,
Thanksgiving is an occasion to
consider how much others have;
for many women. Thanksgiving
is ar> exhausting day-long labor
in the kitchen to prepare quan
tities of food that they person
ally don't want and don't need.
Selmi can hardly disagree with
these observations. Again, this
is not a "general unwarranted
criticism to the male popu
lation," as he says; it is a sad
commentary on the inequities
we often take for granted.
Selmi claims more than once
that men at Stanford don't real
ly need to worry about these is
sues anyway, because we are
better educated and more sex
ually enlightened than men in
society at large. Maybe this is
true maybe. But even if that is
true, it only puts greater respon
sibility on our shoulders to un
derstand the "remnants" of
sexism in our own lives and in
the rest of society. Part of this
responsibility entails main
taining an open-minded and
self-critical modesty, remem-

Bering how much we are like
most men and how much we do
participate in society's pat
terns. We should try to avoid
complacency and a false sense
of superiority.
No good end is served by re
jecting feminist criticisms as
"man-hating'' or "dis
discriminatory." These tired
cliches reject new ideas without
taking them seriously.
Furthermore, they represent a
disservice to feminists like
Halper who carefully maintain
a tone of fairness, conciliation,
and hope. Selmi's claim that
Halper "does not want equality
with men — she wants superior
ity"' reveals to my eyes a per
verse misunderstanding of her
columns, an over-eagerness to
see in Halper the stereotype of a
•"castrating feminist bitch",
and an exceedingly male-like
readiness to assume that any
criticism is a challenge that
must be beaten down. Selmi
should know better than that, if
he has been listening at all.

"blatantly discriminatory," as
Selmi suggests.
The fact that Halper's col
umns make Selmi "feel guilty"
and "offended" is not evidence
that they are discriminatory. It
may be evidence that they are
right. It is very difficult, but
very important, to avoid feeling
defensive Avhen criticism
strikes too close to home. And it
is essential that we give
criticism due consideration

without misinterpreting it.
Halper never says " that she
could not trust any man because
she feared that he might want to
rape her.'' What she says is that
most men. by virtue of their
greater strength, are physically
capable of rape or violent abuse
and that most women must deal
with the threat of rape or abuse,
even if they do so by trying to ig
nore the problem.
When Selmi says that rape "is
not a problem caused by Stan
ford men" but "is isolated in a
select group of men," he takes
the easy way out. How different
from violent rape are cases of
getting sexual favors through
manipulation, bribery, coer
cion. or subtle pressure and
"persuasion?" Once a man
thinks of sex as something to
"get from " a woman, he differs
from the rapist only by method.
Yes. even Stanford men should
take this accusation seriously.
What Halper says is that she
wonders if even her closest
male friends are capable of
rape. I wonder about that too; I
wonder about myself. Don't
you?
Nor does Halper say that

Thanksgiving is a holiday only
for "white, affluent, males."
What she says is that for poor
and minority families,
Thanksgiving is an occasion to
consider how much others have;
for many women. Thanksgiving
is ar> exhausting day-long labor
in the kitchen to prepare quan
tities of food that they person
ally don't want and don't need.
Selmi can hardly disagree with
these observations. Again, this
is not a "general unwarranted
criticism to the male popu
lation," as he says; it is a sad
commentary on the inequities
we often take for granted.
Selmi claims more than once
that men at Stanford don't real
ly need to worry about these is
sues anyway, because we are
better educated and more sex
ually enlightened than men in
society at large. Maybe this is
true maybe. But even if that is
true, it only puts greater respon
sibility on our shoulders to un
derstand the "remnants" of
sexism in our own lives and in
the rest of society. Part of this
responsibility entails main
taining an open-minded and
self-critical modesty, remem-

Bering how much we are like
most men and how much we do
participate in society's pat
terns. We should try to avoid
complacency and a false sense
of superiority.
No good end is served by re
jecting feminist criticisms as
"man-hating'' or "dis
discriminatory." These tired
cliches reject new ideas without
taking them seriously.
Furthermore, they represent a
disservice to feminists like
Halper who carefully maintain
a tone of fairness, conciliation,
and hope. Selmi's claim that
Halper "does not want equality
with men — she wants superior
ity"' reveals to my eyes a per
verse misunderstanding of her
columns, an over-eagerness to
see in Halper the stereotype of a
•"castrating feminist bitch",
and an exceedingly male-like
readiness to assume that any
criticism is a challenge that
must be beaten down. Selmi
should know better than that, if
he has been listening at all.

Michael Selmi's response to
Leah Halper's columns (Daily
Nov. 26) shows that he has fun
damentally misread her
purpose and meaning. Halper
does not "hate men", nor does
she level unwarranted accusa
tions against particular men or
against men in general.
She describes, as I read her. a
society in which men have real
privileges and advantages over
women. Some men have shaped
this sort of society. Nearly all
men. intentionally or not. bene
fit from living in such a society.
Every man ought to reflect seri
ously on the origins and justifi
ability of his own attitudes and
actions towards women. In none
of these claims is Halper
"blatantly discriminatory," as
Selmi suggests.
The fact that Halper's col
umns make Selmi "feel guilty"
and "offended" is not evidence
that they are discriminatory. It
may be evidence that they are
right. It is very difficult, but
