## When Stanford doors lock behind us 
### 
If you're like most Stanford
students, you don't fully ap
preciate this place until you
leave it. until you're locked out
of your dorm one June day and
no one can let you in. No HA, no
roommate, no fellow resi
dents . . . everybody's gone. Not
even Dean Fred can let you back
in.
If that's a sad and painful re
alization, then perhaps you
should treat the mini-de
partures from Stanford — the
summers, the vacations, the
Thanksgiving breaks — to strive
for a more genuine and ap
plicable assessment of what this
place means to you. Of all the
seasons, Thanksgiving can pro
vide some of the most helpful in
sights. Its traditional spirit con
trasts sharply with the general
Stanford spirit and it can offer
us some new perspectives on
how we live our lives here.
Thanksgiving is a time of ret
rospection, a time to step off the
beaten track of life and to give
thanks for your travels and for
your accrued wealth, vour ac

cumulated riches. The Stanford
spirit, on the other hand, calls
for relentless ascent afong a
fairly rigid path in the pursuit of
future wealth, of distant riches.
Many students will claim that
the spirits are fundamentally
related — one spirit seeking se
curity and richness and the oth
er celebrating it — but the two
spirits view the terms "secur
ity" and 'richness'' in two com
pletely different ways. The
Stanford spirit deals with in
comes, security of jobs, wealth
of dollars; the Thanksgiving
spirit concerns itself with the
security of families and rela
tionships, with a general
richness of life.
The Stanford spirit has great
value,, of course; the drive
towards distant laurels of suc
cess can prompt healthy
achievements, education, and
pride. But the Thanksgiving
perspective suggests that a cer
tain bit of carnage may be
strewn along the way. Just look
at our student body: the
freshmen are squirming, the
sophomores slumping, the jun
iors enduring, and the seniors
posturing. Many students are
simply marking dispassionate
existence in the throes of
academic malaises.
Thanksgiving connotes other
visions; clasped hands, em
braces, laughter, and smiles.
And though Thanksgiving may
be an idyllic spirit that can exist
only fleetinglv for several days
one might hope that its passion
will carry on throughout the
year.
I think that it is this term
"passion" that Thanksgiving
suggests that we add to our
Stanford lives. Not passion in
our social relationships, mind
you (at least not only in our so
cial relationships), but passion
in all our relationships, passion
for a cause, for an intellectual
interest, for an extra-curricular
pursuit. With the notable excep
tion of campus musicals, pas
sion is a richness of life that we
see little of here on campus.
Only in Gaieties, Jesus Christ
Superstar, or some dorm musi
cal does one see the complete
devotion, the genuine excite
ment that is characteristic of
passion.
Passion, after all, is a quality
that can lift students out of

doldrums, glorify relationships
and memories, and lift achieve
ments to their highest plateau.
Passion will rip away external
pressures and set powerful in
ternal motivations into gear.
Passion, not least of all. is con
tagious and is an affliction this
campus could use more of.
C'mon, unimpassioned Stan
ford students. What are you
seeking? Money? Prestige? Se
curity? Most of us would answer
that we are seeking some form
of future happiness through an
assortment of present sacri
fices.
But isn't that the ultimate de
lusion — that happiness down
the road can be assured through
some combination of sacrifices
and payments now? Thansgiv

ing instead suggests that life has
ups and downs as part of its
make-up, that moments of hap
piness and sadness will dis
tribute themselves randomly
about our lives. Thanksgiving
suggests that the midterms next
week — or their equivalent —
will always be there.
And so Thanksgiving reminds
us not always to be for
wardlooking in our life visions,
but to take time every now and
then to appreciate each other
and our surroundings. That
means that when Stanford doors
are locked behind us one day, we
can be certain of happiness
ahead of us for one very good
reason; because there's a his
tory of happiness behind us.
