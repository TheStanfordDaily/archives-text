## Realities of office threaten Reagan alliances 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — Ronald Re
agan and the conservative
movement have reached a
crossroads in their long al
liance.
The president-elect and the
conservative leaders who
ardently backed his candidacy
still share most of the same
goals. But in the coming months
differing priorites are likely to
drive them down divergent
paths to confront separate
challenges.
For Reagan, keeping faith
with his base of conservative
support and with the broader
coalition of voters who elected
him will severely test his skills
at conciliation and persuasion.
The conservative groups, for
their part, must find a way to
maintain their militant identity
without warring on the popular
new president who for so long
has been their champion.
For Reagan the most press
ing reality right now is the need
to recruit experienced support
ing players to back his per
formance as chief executive.
The prospect that, for the sake
of experience, Reagan will
select some former members of
the Nixon or Ford adminis
trations deemed insufficiently
committed to conservative
principles has already stirred
rumbles of discontent on the
right.
Some conservatives are dis
turbed by the choice of James
Baker, who managed George
Bush's bid for the GOP presi
dential nomination, as White
House chief of staff.-

The .potential tor discord be
tween Reagan and the con
servative movement won't stop
with the appointment process.
Once in power. Reagan's first
priority will be to deal with the
nation's economic ills, notably
skyrocketing inflation. "You
have to do that before you do
anything else," said Clifton
White.
Conservative groups by and
large subscribe to Reagan's ma
jor economic goals — a substan
tial personal income tax cut and
a balanced budget. But a
number of these groups have
agendas of their own covering a
broad range of controversial
items including social issues
such as banning abortions and
cracking down on drugs and
pornography.
Reagan is on record as sup
porting many of these aims. But
as president he may find it inex
pedient to invest as much time,
energy and prestige in support
ing such proposals, some of
which are highly divisive, as
their conservative sponsors
would like.
From the beginning, Re
agan's political career has been
associated with basic con
servative themes; his landslide
victory over President Jimmy
Carter,, combined with the
OOP's conquest of the Senate,
spearheaded by conservative
candidates, represented a stun
ning triumph foe.conservatism.
But the conservatives' jubila
tion has been mixed with ap
prehension. "It's possible that
people might say, now that Re
agan is elected we don't need

you any more, we'll send you
money when the country is
going down the tubes again,"
said John Dolan, head of the Na
tional Conservative Political
Action Committee
Moreover, conservative lead
ers are concerned that Reagan,
like his immediate Republican
predecessors. Richard Nixon
and Gerald Ford, might com
promise conservative prin
ciples for pragmatic reasons.
"We got a lot of rhetoric dur
ing the Nixon and Ford years,
but very little action.'' said Paul
Weyrich. head of the Committee
for Survival of a Free Congress,
which supports conservative
congressional candidates.
For the time being, most con
servative leaders are preaching
patience in their relations with
the incoming administration.
"I'm not ready to say we're
going to beat up on Reagan."
said Richard Viguerie, the
direct-mail specialist who helps
raise funds for a number of con
servative organizations.

And the Rev. Jerry Falwell,
leader of the Moral Majority,
which claims two million work
ers devoted to conservative
causes, said: "Obviously we
will be quiet for a number of
months to give the president and
Congress time to get en
trenched."
Nevertheless there are bound
to be limits to the patience and
faith of conservative leaders.
Falwell believes that con
servative leaders have a respon
sibility to speak out when they
disagree with Reagan's poli
cies. just as they voiced their
disagreement with Carter:
"When he's wrong as a Re
publican he's just as wrong as a
Democrat is wrong "
In any case. Reagan would be
a tough adversary for right
wing groups to tackle, because
of his strong hold on the al
legiance of rank-and-file con
servatives. A Louis Harris sur
vey showed that among the 39
percent of voters who identified
themselves as conservatives.

Reagan won by a margin of
about 2 to 1
Under these circumstances,
an attack on Reagan from the
right could backfire against the
attackers and bind Reagan loy
alists closer to the new presi
dent Moreover, some political
analysts believe that criticism
of Reagan from the right would
benefit Reagan politically by
making him appear more mod
erate to middle-of-the road vot
ers.
For these reasons, when and
if conservative leaders become
actively indignant over Re
agan s policies they are likely to
focus their criticism on his
aides and associates, rather
than Reagan himself.
"1 think that six months from
now Human Events (the con
servative publication) will be
writing stuff about 'the bastards
around Reagan.'' predicted a
Republican political consultant,
with close ties to the new admin
istration.

Dr. Jerry Falwell, speaking at a rally in Washington last month,
urged Christians to fight legal abortions and defeat the Equal
Rights Amendment. He is one of the prime forces behind the 'Moral
Majority' which helped sweep Ronald Reagan into the presidency,
but which may part company with him once he encounters the pres
sures of office.
