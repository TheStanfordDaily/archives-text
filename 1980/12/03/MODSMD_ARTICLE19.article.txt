# Republicans compete for leadership spots
## 
### 
Washington (AP) — Just a month after
their Election Day victories over the Demo
crats. some Republicans are battling each
other on Capitol Hill The prizes now are
-congressional leadership positions.
The hardest fought race is between Reps.
Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan and Bob
Michel of Illinois to succeed retiring Rep.
John Rhodes of Arizona as House minority
leader.
In the Senate, the job of Republican lead
er — which becomes majority leader with
the GOP takeover in January — already has
been all but formally decided. It goes to Sen.
Howard Baker of Tennessee.
Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), is un
challenged as GOP whip.
But a tight contest has developed for the
chairmanship of the Senate Republican
Conference between Sen. John Heinz of

Pennsylvania and Sen. James McClure of
Idaho.
Most attention has focused on the Michel-
Vander Jagt struggle.
Even though both say they've lined up
enough commitments to win. the race re
mains extremely close. Neutral GOP ob
servers in the House give a slight edge to
Michel.
Michel, who is now minority whip and is
viewed as an accomplished legislative tacti
cian. is drawing most of his support from
veteran GOP members.
The newer members seem to favor
Vander Jagt, who gave the keynote address
at last summer's Republican National Con
vention and is chairman of the Republican
Congressional Committee.
It was Vander Jagt's committee that
handed out cash and campaign advice to

GOP candidates around the country.
But Vander Jagt reflects: "It's an axiom
in politics that it's not What you did for me
yesterday?" but 'What can you do for me
tomorrow?' "
To help remind new members of those
yesterdays. Vander Jagt's picture keeps ap
pearing prominently in "Congress Today,"
a monthly GOP publication put out bv
Vander Jagt's committee.
Two of the most powerful GOP members
of Congress don't hold any leadership jobs
and aren't seeking them: Sen. Paul Laxalt
of Nevada and Hep. Thomas Evans of Dela
ware.
They're the ones President-elect Ronald
Reagan designated as his liaisons with the
Senate and House. Since they will have the
new president's ear, they don't need a for
mal leadership title to enable them to exert
considerable influence on Capitol Hill.
