# Ex-aide cites CIA's Mid-East blunders
## 
### Gail Edmondson-Schares 
America's failures in the Middle
East have resulted largely from the
use of CIA secret diplomacy which
backfired, said former CIA adviser
Wilbur Eveland, speaking yesterday
at the Bechtel International Center.
Eveland's lecture, entitled "We
Have Met the Enemy and He is Us,"
was the last Tuesday Luncheon Series
sponsored by the I-Center for fall
quarter.
"The fledgling CIA first strayed
from its original mandate in 1948."
said Eveland. According to Eveland.
the ClA's mandate was merely to
present intelligence reports to the
president of the United States that
provided the background for sound
foreign policy decisions.
"The CIA was not mandated to rig
foreign elections, organize coups and
'stabilize' strategic areas," Eveland
said. CIA political intervention in the
Mid-East almost always backfired,
spawning distrust of the United
States, he added. "If there were any
successes, they were too top secret for
me to hear about."
Identical interests
According to Eveland, America's
and Britain's interests in the Middle
East in 1948 were identical, denying
the area to the Soviet Union. "Yet as a
result of its blundering secret
diplomacy, the U.S. has provided the
Soviet Union with more opportunities
in that area than they could have gen
erated themselves," he said.
Maintaining stability was the cor
nerstone of American policy in the
Mid-East in 1948, said Eveland, yet
covert CIA actions designed to pro
mote stability have repeatedly
backfired. Eveland cited the abortive
first attempts of "Operation AJAX,"
the secret plan to restore the Shah of
Iran to his throne in 1953, and the un
rest which followed as an illustration
of greater damage done than advan
tage gained.
The secret treaty negotiated with
Egypt's president Nasser in 1954-55
also backfired. Eveland said. Egypt
was to defend the Suez canal in return
for arms supplies. "The treaty with
Nasser could have been negotiated
openly under existing agreements,"
he said. "Because it was a secret trea
ty, the British didn't know what we
were doing They thought Nasser was
another (Adolph) Hitleivwho had to be
confronted The 1956 Suez invasion
was thus a result of our own covert
diplomacy," Eveland said.
Peace efforts failed
"The most pressing task in 1948 was
to form peace treaties betwen Israel
and the Arab states," Eveland said.
Yet secret actions designed to imple
ment this goal were unsuccessful.
Eveland cited the 20-year subsidy paid
to Jordan's King Hussein by the CIA to
work out a peace with Israel as one

such secret policy which backfired.
"When the Washington Post exposed
the secret subsidy, we had to nullify
our effort and neither Hussein nor any
other Arab leader could continue to
risk taking a pro-U.S. stance.
"The result of our secret, diplomacy
in the Middle East has been to isolate
Egypt from her Arab neighbors.
Worst of all, we have saddled the
bankrupt economies of Egypt and Is
rael with munitions bills and have
done what we set out not to do: arm
peoples who should be at peace,"
Eveland said. According to Eveland,

covert diplomacy resulted in the
scrapping of the reasonable Mid-East
policy President Dwight Eisenhower
inherited from President Harry
Truman. That policy stated, "No
peace in the Middle East will result
from supplying arms to potential com
battants."
"The CIA analysts have done their
job." Eveland said, distinguishing be
tween analysts who write policy re
ports in Virginia from those CIA mem
bers involved in secret diplomacy
abroad. "Seven U.S. presidents ig
nored the advice of CIA analysts who
have reported since 1948 that the
availability of Arab oil to the West
would depend on the position of the
U.S. with respect to the Palestinian is
sue," Eveland said. "Analysts have
said that if the Palestinian issue con
tinues to fester, it may result in Soviet
domination of the Mid-East," he

added. According to Eveland, the
State Department concurred with this
analysis.
Carter tried hardest
Eveland concluded by praising
President Jimmy Carter's pledge to
maintain an open foreign policy and
his efforts to solve the Palestinian is
sue. "The lesson of the last adminis
tration can't be lost. We must be rea
sonable with respect to both sides,"
Eveland said. "Any dispute that has
gone on for 30 years has some ele
ments of wrong on both sides," he
added.

Eveland said Carter attributed his
recent defeat to voters' frustrations
over Iran, the economy and
diminished American prestige in the
world. "Considering that Carter spent
more time than any other president
trying to solve problems in the Mid-
East and considering that those prob
lems are linked to our economic trou
bles and American prestige abroad, it
is ironic that Carter is being sent back
to Georgia." Eveland said.
Eveland's book, entitled Ropes of
Sand, America's Failure in the
Middle East, was published this year
following several attempts by the CIA
to prevent its publication. The book
exposes covert activities of the CIA
and is based on Eveland's experiences
during the 1950s as adviser to the CIA
while he handled Middle East policy
for the White House policy planning
staff.

added.

Eveland said Carter attributed his
recent defeat to voters' frustrations
over Iran, the economy and
diminished American prestige in the
world. "Considering that Carter spent
more time than any other president
trying to solve problems in the Mid-
East and considering that those prob
lems are linked to our economic trou
bles and American prestige abroad, it
is ironic that Carter is being sent back
to Georgia." Eveland said.
Eveland's book, entitled Ropes of
Sand, America's Failure in the
Middle East, was published this year
following several attempts by the CIA
to prevent its publication. The book
exposes covert activities of the CIA
and is based on Eveland's experiences
during the 1950s as adviser to the CIA
while he handled Middle East policy
for the White House policy planning
staff.

America's failures in the Middle
East have resulted largely from the
use of CIA secret diplomacy which
backfired, said former CIA adviser
Wilbur Eveland, speaking yesterday
at the Bechtel International Center.
Eveland's lecture, entitled "We
Have Met the Enemy and He is Us,"
was the last Tuesday Luncheon Series
sponsored by the I-Center for fall
quarter.
"The fledgling CIA first strayed
from its original mandate in 1948."
said Eveland. According to Eveland.
the ClA's mandate was merely to
present intelligence reports to the
president of the United States that
provided the background for sound
foreign policy decisions.
"The CIA was not mandated to rig
foreign elections, organize coups and
'stabilize' strategic areas," Eveland
said. CIA political intervention in the
Mid-East almost always backfired,
spawning distrust of the United
States, he added. "If there were any
successes, they were too top secret for
me to hear about."
Identical interests
According to Eveland, America's
and Britain's interests in the Middle
East in 1948 were identical, denying
the area to the Soviet Union. "Yet as a
result of its blundering secret
diplomacy, the U.S. has provided the
Soviet Union with more opportunities
in that area than they could have gen
erated themselves," he said.
Maintaining stability was the cor
nerstone of American policy in the
Mid-East in 1948, said Eveland, yet
covert CIA actions designed to pro
mote stability have repeatedly
backfired. Eveland cited the abortive
first attempts of "Operation AJAX,"
the secret plan to restore the Shah of
Iran to his throne in 1953, and the un
rest which followed as an illustration
of greater damage done than advan
tage gained.
The secret treaty negotiated with
Egypt's president Nasser in 1954-55
also backfired. Eveland said. Egypt
was to defend the Suez canal in return
for arms supplies. "The treaty with
Nasser could have been negotiated
openly under existing agreements,"
he said. "Because it was a secret trea
ty, the British didn't know what we
were doing They thought Nasser was
another (Adolph) Hitleivwho had to be
confronted The 1956 Suez invasion
was thus a result of our own covert
diplomacy," Eveland said.
Peace efforts failed
"The most pressing task in 1948 was
to form peace treaties betwen Israel
and the Arab states," Eveland said.
Yet secret actions designed to imple
ment this goal were unsuccessful.
Eveland cited the 20-year subsidy paid
to Jordan's King Hussein by the CIA to
work out a peace with Israel as one

such secret policy which backfired.
"When the Washington Post exposed
the secret subsidy, we had to nullify
our effort and neither Hussein nor any
other Arab leader could continue to
risk taking a pro-U.S. stance.
"The result of our secret, diplomacy
in the Middle East has been to isolate
Egypt from her Arab neighbors.
Worst of all, we have saddled the
bankrupt economies of Egypt and Is
rael with munitions bills and have
done what we set out not to do: arm
peoples who should be at peace,"
Eveland said. According to Eveland,

covert diplomacy resulted in the
scrapping of the reasonable Mid-East
policy President Dwight Eisenhower
inherited from President Harry
Truman. That policy stated, "No
peace in the Middle East will result
from supplying arms to potential com
battants."
"The CIA analysts have done their
job." Eveland said, distinguishing be
tween analysts who write policy re
ports in Virginia from those CIA mem
bers involved in secret diplomacy
abroad. "Seven U.S. presidents ig
nored the advice of CIA analysts who
have reported since 1948 that the
availability of Arab oil to the West
would depend on the position of the
U.S. with respect to the Palestinian is
sue," Eveland said. "Analysts have
said that if the Palestinian issue con
tinues to fester, it may result in Soviet
domination of the Mid-East," he

added. According to Eveland, the
State Department concurred with this
analysis.
Carter tried hardest
Eveland concluded by praising
President Jimmy Carter's pledge to
maintain an open foreign policy and
his efforts to solve the Palestinian is
sue. "The lesson of the last adminis
tration can't be lost. We must be rea
sonable with respect to both sides,"
Eveland said. "Any dispute that has
gone on for 30 years has some ele
ments of wrong on both sides," he
added.

Eveland said Carter attributed his
recent defeat to voters' frustrations
over Iran, the economy and
diminished American prestige in the
world. "Considering that Carter spent
