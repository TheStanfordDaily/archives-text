# High court to decide civil rights
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washingtonâ€” In a case that will be watched
closely by the nation's schools and colleges, the
Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
the federal government may cut off funds to
educational institutions that discriminate against
female employees.
The court announced it will review a ruling by
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in
San Francisco. Last June, that court decided that
the U.S. Department of Education has no legal au
thority to deny federal aid to schools and colleges
for mistreating women on their payrolls.
The case the justices will consider arose at
Seattle University's School of Nursing, one of
many educational institutions whose employment
practices have been investigated by the federal
government. In several instances, federal courts
have held that the government has no right to in
itiate these investigations.
In Title 9 of the Education Amendments of 1972,
Congress said no person in the United States
"shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from par
ticipation in, be denied the benefits of or be sub
jected to discrimination under any educational
program or activity receiving federal financial
assistance."'
This law gave the former U.S. Department of
Health. Education and Welfare and the present
Department of Education the power to stop feder
al aid to recipients engaging in sex discrimina
tion.

Most colleges and universities now receive
large amounts of federal aid. The threat to cut off
this money gives the federal government con
siderable leverage to force changes in a univer
sity's policies or programs.
The wording of the 1972 law left unclear wheth
er Congress intended that the provision apply only
to students and grant recipients in educational
programs that receive federal funds, or whether
Congress meant to cover any form of sex dis
crimination by a federally funded educational in
stitution.
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals cited the
reasoning of these other appeals courts when it
held last June that the federal government has no
authority to investigate employment practices at
Seattle University.
However, last July, a separate federal appeals
court in New York City interpreted the 1972
Education Amendments more broadly deciding
that the federal government does have power to
deny federal funds to schools and colleges dis
criminating against female employees.
If the federal government loses the case, it
would have to rely on other laborious and ex
pensive methods, such as lawsuits under the 1964
Civil Rights Act. to prevent sex discrimination
against employees of universities and school sys
tems.
The justices will hold a hearing in the case early
next year and issue a final decision before the
term ends in Julv.
