### 
Athens, Ga. (AP) â€” Vince Dooley, football coach of the No.l
ranked Georgia Bulldogs, met with university President Fred
Davison for two hours yesterday, then said he had not decided
whether to stay or take a reported million-dollar offer to coach at
Auburn.
i have not made a decision. Maybe I'll have one by Wednesday
night or Thursday," Dooley told reporters after the meeting. "We
had a nice discussion about a lot of things."
He said he had to go home and talk the situation over with his
wife, adding, "I haven't seen her since Sunday."
Auburn has offered a multi-year, million dollar package, accord
ing to published reports.
Asked if Georgia were going to match that offer. Dooley said:
"I'm not looking for anything."
I feel bad for you fellas," he told the reporters, "because I know
you need to know something. And I know it's necessary for me to
make a decision, but I haven't made one vet."
Davision emerged from the meeting saying. "I have no com
ment."
Doolev told reporters Monday night at a fan dinner in Orlando,
Kla.. that there might be a statement on whether he'd accept the
Auburn job. which was vacated Monday when Doug Barfield re
signed. He said he met all day Monday with Auburn officials about
their offer.
Published reports said Dooley had been offered the head coach's
job and the athletic director's job at Auburn, although Athletic Di
rector Lee Havley has neither resigned nor been fired. The reports
put the pay offer at anywhere from $1 million for five years to $1.8
million for eight years, with $500,000 cash in advance.
Dooley. who has a 129-56-6 record in 17 seasons at Georgia, said in
Florida that the Bulldogs' 11-0 record and No. 1 ranking this year
made it "a great season."
But he said he would not coach the Bulldogs in their Jan. 1 Sugar
Bowl contest with Notre Dame if he takes the Auburn job.
"I don't think it would be in the best interests of either school in
volved, and I'm not sure I would have the option even if I wanted to
coach." said Dooley. who has two years left on his Georgia con
tract.
