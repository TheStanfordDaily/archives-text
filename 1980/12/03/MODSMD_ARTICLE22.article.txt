# Cards' shaky road show resumes tomorrow

Talking with the head coach
of Stanford men's basketball
team, a reporter informed Dick
Dißiaso that he would be unable
to accompany >':< :uls on
their Midwest riMU trip this
weekend.
"That's OK." Dißiaso as
sured the reporter. "Those
games have been canceled."
Dißiaso was only kidding, of
course. But his deadpanning
only served as a reminder that
the Cards have had trouble
playing well away from Maples
Pavilion — they dropped 11 of 13
games in foreign quarters a sea
son ago. Given this fact, Stan
ford ought to relish its games at
Wyoming tomorrow and Mar
quette Saturday as much as an
outing to the Bermuda Triangle.
What makes the trip even

more formidable is the quality
of the opposition. Wyoming,
18-10 in 1979-80. should challenge
for the Western Athletic Con
ference title this year The Cow
boys boast eight returning let
termen. including 6-foot-5 sen
ior guartl Charles Bradley,
whom Dißiaso regards as one of
the finest guards in the country.
One of Wyoming's defeats
last season came at Stanford's
hands. In the 54-52 Card victory
at Maples. Bradley scored 18
points but missed six of eight
tree throws, and Terry Smith
won the game on a short bank
shot with 18 seconds to go.
To repeat last year's heroics,
the Cards could use the same
kind of effort that Brian Welch
gave against the Cowboys. The
ti-foot-7 forward contributed sig
nificantly to that victory with 18

points, tour rebounds, three as
sists and three steals What
Welch won't need is a dupli
cation of Saturday, when he
scored 11 points against Air
Force but made only three of 13
shots trom the floor.
Marquette, meanwhile, is
merely one of the country's
most successful teams. The
Warriors, who decimated
('harleston 106-58 in their season
opener Monday night, have
played in post-season competi
tion tor 14 consecutive seasons,
most of those under the legend
ary Al McGuire.
Fourth-year coach Hank Ray
monds. however, has main
tained the Warriors' golden
tradition. Only UCLA 1267-35.
.8841 has amassed a higher win
ning percentage than Marquette
1244-46. 841i over the past 10

campaigns.
The Warriors' top player is 6-
toot-7 forward Oliver Lee. who
averaged 15 9 points and 5.2 re
bounds a game last year Mar
quette also reaped the fruits of
the recruiting season, luring,
among others. 6-foot-4 guard
Glenn Rivers to Milwaukee.
"He was one of the most sought
after players in the nation."
Dißiaso said
Stanford's goals for this road
trip transcend merely winning a
game or two. Most of all.
Dißiaso has to begin to find the
right combinations of players to

use during the appropriate situ
ations. No less than 11 Cards
played in the first half Saturday,
which led. Dißiaso said, to
breakdowns in offensive execu
tion With so many different
players playing alongside vari
ous teammates, performing the
correct tasks in Stanford's new
offense becomes difficult.
"All it takes is one player
making a mistake,' Dißiaso
said. "Last year, we ran a pass
ing-game offense, and more
people were making mistakes,
but they were masked because
everybody was moving •
