## Women go hunting for Wildcats, Roadrunner 
### Robert Stone 
The women's basketball team
takes its 3-1 record to the sunny
Southwest this week for four
days of action. The Cardinals tip
off against the Arizona Wildcats
this afternoon then travel to
New Mexico State for the seven
team Roadrunner Classic tour
nament.
Stanford earned its three vic
tories at the season-opening Cal
Poly Tournament with wins
over Azusa Pacific, UC-Santa
Barbara and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. UCLA inflicted the only
loss in a hard-fought, im
pressive bout at Maples.
The Cards have gotten off to a
strong start this season despite
losing last year's top two
scorers. Jeanne Ruark-Hoff led
the team in 1979-80 in scoi ing
and rebounding with 20.1 points
and 10.0 rebounds per game, the
best mark in the NorCal Con
ference. She is redshirting this
year after marrying last June
and plans to return next season
for her two years of remaining
eligibility.
Stanford is also without the
services of junior Angie Pac
cione. an intense, quick player
who averaged 9.5 points from

her guard position. Paccione
withdrew from the team to con
centrate on her schoolwork but
hopes to return.
The absence of Ruark-Hoff
and Paccione led to the adapta
tion of a more team-oriented
style. It is Stanford's strongest
point, according to head coach
Dotty McCrea.
"The total effort of all 12 peo
ple." is the team's greatest
strength. McCrea said. "I'm
getting 110 percent from every
one, and those who don't start
challenge the other people."
Starting point guard Debi
Gore remarked that the team's
adjustment has brought out the
best in several players. "We had
so much depth last year and no
one knew it," she said.
Experience is another aspect
that sets this team off from oth
er year's. McCrea's squad
breaks down to two seniors, four
juniors, four sophomores, and
two freshmen. "This is the first
time I've had this much ex
perience on the team." said the
fifth-year coach, who noted that
this will also mark the first year
that a scholarship player will
graduate.
At Arizona the Cards will go

against a team that finished
with a 9-17 slate last year but
that has improved, according to
McCrea. One of the top re
turners this season is 5-foot-6
guard Pam Roberts, who tossed
in 9.9 points a game.
In the first round of the Road
runner Classic Stanford battles
Wichita State with the winner to
face the victor of the Portland
State-lowa contest. McCrea
said that Wichita State would be
one of the stronger teams in the
tournament since they sport a 6-
foot-5 and 6-foot-6 duo in the
lineup, but she expressed con
fidence in her team's abilities.
"We're looking for us to do
very well. They're (the team)
working hard, the communica
tion is better on the
floor . . . they know what
they're doing," she said.
As for specific areas she
hopes to improve on during the
trip the coach said. "I want the
forwards to put more points on
the board. The point guards are
getting better and better,
though. Gore is a blue-chip
basketball player. She used to
be a blue-chip athlete but now
she's a blue-chip basketball
player." Gore scored 17 points

in the I('LA game.
McCrea's confidence has
spread to her team. "We're
thinking of going in as favor
ites." forward Kim Kupferer
said. "We're confident we can
beat any team that's out there. "
Center Louise Smith, averag
ing 21.5 points a game so far,
added. "I'm looking forward to

this tournament because it
should be more of a challenge
than the last one (Cal Poly).
Practice has been going well,
we're putting on a lot more pres
sure that should show up in the
games. The offense is beginning
to click more and more."
The Cards return to Maples

cisco State.

takes its 3-1 record to the sunny
Southwest this week for four
days of action. The Cardinals tip
off against the Arizona Wildcats
this afternoon then travel to
New Mexico State for the seven
team Roadrunner Classic tour
nament.
Stanford earned its three vic
tories at the season-opening Cal
Poly Tournament with wins
over Azusa Pacific, UC-Santa
Barbara and Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo. UCLA inflicted the only
loss in a hard-fought, im
pressive bout at Maples.
The Cards have gotten off to a
strong start this season despite
losing last year's top two
scorers. Jeanne Ruark-Hoff led
the team in 1979-80 in scoi ing
and rebounding with 20.1 points
and 10.0 rebounds per game, the
best mark in the NorCal Con
ference. She is redshirting this
year after marrying last June
and plans to return next season
for her two years of remaining
eligibility.
Stanford is also without the
services of junior Angie Pac
cione. an intense, quick player
who averaged 9.5 points from

her guard position. Paccione
withdrew from the team to con
centrate on her schoolwork but
hopes to return.
The absence of Ruark-Hoff
and Paccione led to the adapta
tion of a more team-oriented
style. It is Stanford's strongest
point, according to head coach
Dotty McCrea.
"The total effort of all 12 peo
ple." is the team's greatest
strength. McCrea said. "I'm
getting 110 percent from every
one, and those who don't start
challenge the other people."
Starting point guard Debi
Gore remarked that the team's
adjustment has brought out the
best in several players. "We had
so much depth last year and no
one knew it," she said.
Experience is another aspect
that sets this team off from oth
er year's. McCrea's squad
breaks down to two seniors, four
juniors, four sophomores, and
two freshmen. "This is the first
time I've had this much ex
perience on the team." said the
fifth-year coach, who noted that
this will also mark the first year
that a scholarship player will
graduate.
At Arizona the Cards will go

against a team that finished
with a 9-17 slate last year but
that has improved, according to
McCrea. One of the top re
turners this season is 5-foot-6
guard Pam Roberts, who tossed
in 9.9 points a game.
In the first round of the Road
runner Classic Stanford battles
Wichita State with the winner to
face the victor of the Portland
State-lowa contest. McCrea
said that Wichita State would be
one of the stronger teams in the
tournament since they sport a 6-
foot-5 and 6-foot-6 duo in the
lineup, but she expressed con
fidence in her team's abilities.
"We're looking for us to do
very well. They're (the team)
working hard, the communica
tion is better on the
floor . . . they know what
they're doing," she said.
As for specific areas she
hopes to improve on during the
trip the coach said. "I want the
forwards to put more points on
the board. The point guards are
getting better and better,
though. Gore is a blue-chip
basketball player. She used to
be a blue-chip athlete but now
she's a blue-chip basketball
player." Gore scored 17 points

in the I('LA game.
McCrea's confidence has
spread to her team. "We're
thinking of going in as favor
ites." forward Kim Kupferer
said. "We're confident we can
beat any team that's out there. "
Center Louise Smith, averag
ing 21.5 points a game so far,
added. "I'm looking forward to

this tournament because it
should be more of a challenge
than the last one (Cal Poly).
Practice has been going well,
we're putting on a lot more pres
sure that should show up in the
games. The offense is beginning
to click more and more."
The Cards return to Maples
December 9th against San Fran
cisco State.
