Round Eight
The start of Round Eight
is delayed as the referee
wipes vaseline off Roberto
Duran 's body. Duran
charges and works the body.
Sugar Ray Leonard covers
up well. As Duran charges,
Leonard butts him on the
forehead. No blood. Duran
flurries to the body and
misses a right to the head.
Duran hooks to the body.
Leonard catches him with a
right, left coming in. Duran
quits . . .

Commentary

A few years from now.
boxing promoter Don King
may actually take pride in
what transpired last week in
the New Orleans Superdome.
"It was a once-in-a-lifetime
happening,"' he will tell re
porters as he rewires his
short-circuited hairdo.
"Boxing has never seen any
thing like it!"
King will be right on both
counts. The rematch be
tween World Boxing Council
(WBC) welterweight cham
pion Roberto Duran and ex
champ Sugar Kay Leonard
was a once-in-a-lifetime hap
pening. Without doubt, it was
one of the great stinkers in
sports history.
For $1000 at ringside and
up to $50 at various closed
circuit locations across the
earth, boxing fans were
awarded the privilege of

watching the once-fierce
Duran quit with 16 seconds
lett in the eighth round Hav
ing found the early going
with a resurgent Leonard not
to his liking. Duran evidently
decided to cash his chips ear
ly.
And what chips they were!
For just stepping into the
same ring with Leonard.
Duran was guaranteed $7
million. Not only that, but
the money was Duran's
before he had even thrown a
punch. Duran could have had
a picnic with Leonard last
Tuesday night, and the Loui
siana State Athletic Com
mission still would not have
been able to keep him from
claiming his loot.
Unlike the big fights of
yesteryear, last week's
Duran-Leonard waltz was fi
nanced by global television
fees, not by the live gate.
While ticket sales can fluc
tuate, television bills have to
be paid. Thus, when Duran
and Leonard finally stopped
filming their 7-UP com
mercial, and finally started
trading punches, neither had
to worry about the 50.000
empty Superdome seats.
While Don King drowned in
red ink. the two fighters al
ready had their money in
safekeeping.
Though Duran's huge,
guaranteed purse can per
haps explain his lack of in
centive in this fight, it does
not provide a satisfying alibi
for his shocking demise. Af
ter all. for the last decade the

29-year-old Duran had been
anything but a quitter.
indeed, he — not Muham
mad Ali — might have been
the premier prizefighter of
the 19705. Just look at his re
cord: 73 tights, 72 victories,
56 men put into orbit.
Esteban DeJesus. the one
man to defeat Duran, wound
up on his can twice in return
matches.
A crude and broodish sort,
Duran ruled the lightweight
division < 135 pounds) for sev
en years. In 1978, he moved
up to the welterweight class
(147 pounds). After a series
of successful, but uninspired,
elimination fights, Duran
finally landed a shot at the ti
tle. And last June, in the fight
of his life. Duran won that ti
tle. as he pounded out a ver
dict over favored Leonard.
In his victory over
Leonard. Duran showed
himself to be a fighter of
great skill and unquestioned
heart. Members of the media
continually pointed back to
his troubled childhood in
Panama and to his famed
"hands of stone." Duran's
punches, it was said, could
deck a Coca-Cola machine.
In truth. Duran had lost his
fearsome punch when he
moved up in weight. A de
stroyer at 135 pounds. Duran
was not able to put away the
heavier welterweights. To
beat Leonard. Duran utilized
his quick hands, his foot
speed, his agility and his
head. Duran was in terrific
shape — physically and men

tally — for the first Leonard
fight, and it was the tough
ness of his spirit that domi
nated the fight
Last Tuesday night was
another matter. All this talk
about "hands of stone" prob
ably got to Duran's head as
much as it got to those of his
fans. The only thing made of
stone last week in New Or
leans was Duran's head.
The first time around.
Duran had been ignited by
his own pride. Sugar Ray
Leonard, the new kid on the
block, was trying to claim
the attention Duran felt was
meant for him — the same
attention that Ali had always
held. Duran-Leonard II was
strictly wallet-stuffing for
Duran.
For Sugar Hay Leonard
though, the second fight was
serious business. Leonard
trained hard and fought well.
He set a torrid pace, dancing
circles around the stalking
Panamanian. For the most
part, Leonard had the best of
the exchanges. Nevertheless
the fight was hardly decided
when it ended.
As it was. Duran was the
one who tired out. He just
didn't have it this night. Lat
er on, he and his followers
would complain of every
thing from stomach cramps
to groin muscle pulls.
This isn't the end of Duran.
though. He will get in shape
again and he will fight again.
He may even be champion
again. At 2y, what else is
Duran going to do?
