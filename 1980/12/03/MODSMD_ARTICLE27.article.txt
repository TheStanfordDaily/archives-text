Court upholds strict pollution law
Washington - The Supreme Court, acknowledging that
its decision could force some factories to close, ruled
unanimously yesterday that polluting industries must
meet federal water cleanup requirements regardless of
their costs.
It was a major victory for environmentalists. The En
vironmental Protection Agency feared that an opposite
ruling would have allowed polluting firms in every in
dustry to delay cleanup measures indefinitely through
court suits and administrative proceedings, whether or
not they could show an inability to pay costs.
Reversing a lower court ruling, the justices said yester
day that Congress, when enacting the Clean Water Act. ex
pressly avoided financial exemptions, though it "antici
pated that the 1977 regulations would cause economic
hardship and plant closings." Congress, now possibly
more pro-business on such issues, can still amend the law.
