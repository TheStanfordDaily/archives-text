The man suspected of being the Col
lege Terrace rapist will go to court on
four charges Dec. y. according to
Thomas Nolan, the defendant's at
torney.
Melvin Alfred Carter, a 35-year-old
computer engineer, has been charged
with three rapes committed in the Col
lege Terrace area.
Carter was arrested in Pleasanton
Sept. 5 after nearly 10 years of police
investigation, according to the Palo
Alto police department.
The preliminary examination was
held in a closed court-room last week.
"I'm taking the position that it's not
in my client's best interests to have
this case spread around in the news
papers." said Nolan.
According to Nolan, media cov
erage has caused people to assume

Carter is guilty before he has received
a lair trial. He added that it is im
possible to have an unbiased jury of
people who have not recently read the
newspapers.
Handy Hey. Santa Clara district at
torney. refused to comment on the
case. He merely said that most of the
evidence of the investigation has been
sealed trom the public and press.
Physical evidence, including blood
stained surgical gloves found in
Carter's office, was taken in a Sept. 12
search of his home and his office at
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Com
pany.
Hey added that Carter is charged
with il counts of rape in Berkeley and
also faces Yolo County charges in
Davis.
Past attacks occurred in the homes
of women who lived alone in the Col

lege Terrace area along Stanford Ave
nue. In all the assaults, a man would
enter in the early morning hours
through an unlocked door or window
and shut off the main electricity.
According to Sergeant Hon Louie of
the Palo Alto Police Department, the
" 'Want Ad' rapist'" was identified
last week.
The suspect is Joel Kaulk. a 33-year
old electrician, boatman and fish
erman. who lives in Santa Cruz.
Police are still trying to locate
Kaulk. who is wanted for possibly 14
rapes in the Bay Area, said Louie.
Kaulk was stopped on a phony want
ad. Police placed the ad pretending to
sell baby furniture. Louie said he can
not reveal the criteria used to identify
Kaulk as the correct suspect who re
plied to the ad.
