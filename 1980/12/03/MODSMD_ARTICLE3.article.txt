### Bill Evers 
The trustees of Welleslev College,
the Massachusetts liberal arts college
tor women, yesterday named Stanford
political science associate professor
and Kaculty Senate chair Nannerl
Keohane the college's eleventh presi
dent.
Keohane will assume the post next
tall.
Keohane was the unanimous choice
of a 17-person search committee.
Rachel Jacoff. a faculty member of
the Welleslev search committee, told
\he Daily that the committee was "ex
tremely enthusiastic" about Keohane
because of "her distinction of mind,
her vitality and energy, and her com
mitment to women's issues and schol

arship in general."
Stanford President Donald Kennedy
predicted that Keohane will be the
"greatest president of Wellesley that
you could possibly imagine." Kennedy
said. "1 would be sad if this weren't
what we are all about here at Stanford.
She has been an extraordinarily dist
inguished member of the faculty —
great for both students and col
leagues. She now has a tremendous op
portunity to put things she cares deep
ly about into practice."
Keohane's husband, political sci
ence department chair Robert
Keohane, exclaimed. "Great, ter
rific," after he learned the news.
Myra Strober. an associate pro
fessor in Stanford's school of educa
tion and director of the Center for Re
search on Women here — with which
Keohane has been deeply involved —
added that Keohane will be "sorely
missed" at Stanford and said that she
is "really not replaceable."
But Strober noted that Keohane's
new post as president of Wellesley will
be "a marvelous place for her" and a
position where, as a feminist.
Keohane will be able to make an "im
portant contribution" both to that col
lege and to the entire country.
Keohane attended Wellesley Col
lege as an undergraduate from 1957 to
1961. It opened in 1875 in the town of
Wellesley, now a suburb of Boston,
and is one of the largest, most selec
tive, and most prestigious women's
colleges in the country. Of all of the or
iginal Seven Sisters colleges, only
Wellesley has always had a female
president — although in this case a

committee of 10 trustees, four faculty
members and three students looked at
more than 200 nominees and appli
cants of both sexes.
The college's previous president
was Barbara Newell, who served from
1972 until she formally stepped down
in May 1980. She is currently the
Carter administration's ambassador
to the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO). For the past 16 months.
Carol Johns, a doctor on the faculty of
the Johns Hopkins medical school, has
been the college's acting president.
In May of 1978, Keohane told the
Daily in an interview that her educa
tion at Wellesley had contributed to
her present 112 eminist outlook. She said.
"It was very important to me to beat a
women's college. There was nobody
else around but us to do the active, ag
gressive things. 1 gained a certain kind
of confidence there that is a little
harder to get in a co-ed environment."
As a teacher Keohane has con
sistently received rave reviews from
her students since she and her husband
joined the Stanford faculty in fall 1973.
She is complimented for the "viv
idness and force of her lectures'' and
spoken of as "very responsive and
easy to talk to. "
One student said: "She has an in
credible grasp of the material, as well
as an immense interest in the students
who take the class." Another student
called her "a rare combination of en
thusiasm and brilliance. " She won the
Cores Award for Excellence in
Teaching in 1976.
Keohane's scholarship has stressed

17th-century French political thought
and feminist theory. One political sci
ence graduate student said, "In Nan's
writing, she can take a half-forgotten
thinker like (Claude de) Sevssel. and
after drawing out the subtleties in his
talk about how the government works,
she reveals him to have been a kind ot
fascinating forerunner of Montes
quieu.''
To illustrate her stress on nuances,
the graduate student pointed to a sen
tence in her book Philosophy and the
State in France as characteristic of
her style: "Montaigne's complex am
bivalence about the quality of public
life is nicely revealed in his juxtaposi
tion of 'more vigorous and less fearful
citizens' with more obedient and sup
pler people.' to describe the same set
of men."
Above ail. according (o this gradu
ate student, Keohane appreciates the
creative work done by each political
thinker she writes about or teaches
about. This love of the "richness" of
these thinkers, he maintains, makes
her coverage fair and comprehensive

in 1977. who had chosen her as one of
their favorite professors. Keohane de
scribed her own approach in crossing
the minefields of ideology in the
classroom: "My tactic has been to
present each thought-system that I
teach as sympathetically as possible
(which is sometimes confusing for
studentsi: anarchism, conservatism,
communism, liberalism."
Keohane's next book is on women
and authority. Her feminist views
