# Robinson says new dorm may alleviate campus housing shortage
## 
### Sara Tung 
The new dorm, theme houses, the
draw, and the quality of residential
education are all topics which have
been much on the minds of Stanford
students and of Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of Residential Educa
tion. who aired his own views on these
subjects on KZSU's Campus Con
ference.
When questioned about plans for a
new dorm. Robinson expressed hope
that its construction would alleviate
the shortage of housing on campus.
The dorm, to be located near Lake
Lagunita, will be completed in three
stages between the fall of 1982 and
spring of 1983 and will increase the
number of undergraduates and gradu
ates housed by 680. According to Rob
inson, the building of the new dorm
will be funded by selling bonds and by
$36 million worth of loans, the repay
ment of which will be borne by Resi
dential Education.
"We'll be able to house all or sub
stantially all of the students who want
housing, and that's probably the best
answer that can be given," said Rob
inson about the prospects of meeting
demand for housing. Me based his
projection on the assumption that the
undergraduate enrollment will not in
crease radically.
Creation of the new dorm, though
contributing to the alleviation of the
housing shortage, also raised the ques
tion of equity in the assignment of stu
dents to it and to all other on-carnpus
residences.
One change Robinson said would be
made in the University draw system
for next near is the elimination of re
turning residence priority for students
in their non-guaranteed year. This,
Robinson believes, will remove the
unfairness of guaranteeing any stu

dent housing in a popular house for an
indefinite period of time. However,
the returning residence priority sys
tem will not be completely eliminated
because Residential Education main
tains that "some sort of continuity
(among residents of a given house) is
important for the health of the house."
Robinson cited the nature of cross
cultural interaction as one area of res
idential education which he would like

to focus more attention on. He held
that the existence of theme houses
contributes to the residential and
education programs of the university.
While he acknowledged that theme
houses do contribute to a degree of
segregation, he argued. "I don't think
that that in any way diminishes the
quality of life I think it enhances it by
giving people the opportunity to do
things together with people who share
similar interests."
He further justified this by mention
ing the University's commitment to
provide choice in housing to its stu
dents.
Finally Robinson said he believes
there are enough interested students
living in theme houses, even in those
with consistently low demand, to

ensure that the themes are actively
promoted.
Residential Education intends to in
crease the communication between
groups affiliated with special houses
in order to maintain the quality of liv
ing in them and to ensure that a house
meets qualifications to retain its sta
tus.
The effort to increase ties between
special houses and Residential Educa
tion has been made in response to such
occurences as last year's conflict be
tween groups representing French
and East Asian Studies themes over
occupation of Guthrie House.
The issue was resolved with Resi
dential Education granting the French
House the right to continue its ex
istence. Res Ed has promised ten
tative space for an East Asian Studies
House in the new dorm.
Robinson also noted that Storey
House is under reconstruction and will
increase its occupancy Whether or
not it will be co-ed or an all-women's
dorm has not yet been determined, he
added.
Regarding the educational aspects
of housing, just what does "residential
education mean?" Robinson ex
plained. "It means different things to
different people."
Although he identified the diversity
in housing as a major obstacle to es
tablishing a focus. Robinson did ex
press a desire to institute more resi
dentiallv based courses In that way
"residents could share a common
academic and hopefully intellectual
experience."
In addition. Residential Education
intends to develop a system to eval
uate residences in general.

aired tomorrow evening at 7:30 p.m.
on KZSU's Campus Conference.

The new dorm, theme houses, the
draw, and the quality of residential
education are all topics which have
been much on the minds of Stanford
students and of Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of Residential Educa
tion. who aired his own views on these
subjects on KZSU's Campus Con
ference.
When questioned about plans for a
new dorm. Robinson expressed hope
that its construction would alleviate
the shortage of housing on campus.
The dorm, to be located near Lake
Lagunita, will be completed in three
stages between the fall of 1982 and
spring of 1983 and will increase the
number of undergraduates and gradu
ates housed by 680. According to Rob
inson, the building of the new dorm
will be funded by selling bonds and by
$36 million worth of loans, the repay
ment of which will be borne by Resi
dential Education.
"We'll be able to house all or sub
stantially all of the students who want
housing, and that's probably the best
answer that can be given," said Rob
inson about the prospects of meeting
demand for housing. Me based his
projection on the assumption that the
undergraduate enrollment will not in
crease radically.
Creation of the new dorm, though
contributing to the alleviation of the
housing shortage, also raised the ques
tion of equity in the assignment of stu
dents to it and to all other on-carnpus
residences.
One change Robinson said would be
made in the University draw system
for next near is the elimination of re
turning residence priority for students
in their non-guaranteed year. This,
Robinson believes, will remove the
unfairness of guaranteeing any stu

dent housing in a popular house for an
indefinite period of time. However,
the returning residence priority sys
tem will not be completely eliminated
because Residential Education main
tains that "some sort of continuity
(among residents of a given house) is
important for the health of the house."
Robinson cited the nature of cross
cultural interaction as one area of res
idential education which he would like

to focus more attention on. He held
that the existence of theme houses
contributes to the residential and
education programs of the university.
While he acknowledged that theme
houses do contribute to a degree of
segregation, he argued. "I don't think
that that in any way diminishes the
quality of life I think it enhances it by
giving people the opportunity to do
things together with people who share
similar interests."
