## Warm, dry winter seen for West 
### 
La Jolla, Calif. lAP) â€” The approaching
winter will be colder and wetter than nor
mal in eastern states but warmer and drier
out West except for the Southwest, a na
tionally respected long-range forecaster
said Monday.
I)r Jerome Namias of Scripps Institution
of Oceanography has been generally on
target in his annual predictions in recent
years.
In part. Namias bases his predictions on
ocean-water temperatures to indicate
changes expected in the climate over conti
nents. Thousands of temperature readings
are taken monthly from ships, planes and
buoys and by remote sensing via satellites.
"Indications point to colder than normal
weather over the eastern half of the nation
and also over the Southwest from New Mex
ico through Oklahoma and Texas and
warmer than normal weather over the
western third of the nation." Namias said in
an annual forecast release.
The predictions of Namias. a former
chief of long-range forecaster for the Na
tional Weather Service, are described by

Scripps as experimental and part of continu
ing research sponsored by the National Sci
ence Foundation and the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
Namias said the Dakotas. Nebraska and
parts of Colorado. New Mexico and Arizona
"will experience largely weekly fluctua
tions in temperatures."
"Precipitation totals for the winter are
expected to be subnormal in a broad area
extending from the western Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley westward to the West
Coast." he said.
An exception is that normal precipitation
is expected in coastal regions of Washington
and Oregon
Above-average precipitation will fall "in
a broad band extending from southern New
Mexico through the Gulf Coast states and
from the Appalachians eastward" with nor
mal precipation elsesyhere. Namias said
This is in contrast to last winter, which
was mild from the Great Plains eastward to
New England, dry and relatively snowless
over much of the East but abnormally wet
over the Southwest.

There will be "appreciably more snow
than last winter in areas from theCarolinas
northward." Namias said, "as well as occa
sional snow and sleet in northern portions of
the Gulf states and in adjacent states to the
north "
The wind pattern including a equatorial
bulge or trough tending from New England
southwestward to Texas and a strong ridge
or poleward bulge over the Canadian Rock
ies and along the West Coast will "en
courage the deployment of cold polar air
masses into the East but shield the West,"
said Namias. adding:
"This wind pattern also favors the
deployment of more frequent storms along
the Gulf Coast and Atlantic seaboard and
provides the mechanism for the release of
precipitation
"In the East, some of the snows, once
generated, would influence the atmosphere
in ways such as to further refrigerate the air
masses. By increasing the temperature con
trast between the continent and the Gulf
Stream, development of East Coast storms
would be enhanced. "
