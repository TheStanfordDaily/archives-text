## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Moscow — For the second
time in two weeks. Soviet au
thorities Sunday blocked Jewish
scientists and engineers from
attending a scientific seminar
in the apartment of imprisoned
Jewish activist Victor
Brailovsky.
For the last eight years, the
informal Sunday seminar has
been the intellectual lifeblood
for dozens of Jewish re
searchers who have been denied
permission to emigrate to Israel
and who also, upon applying to
emigrate, lost their jobs.
Eight plainclothes agents and
two gray-uniformed militiamen
blocked the entrance Sunday to
the stairwell leading to

Brailovsky's high-rise apart
ment One of the agents told
Western correspondents that
they could not enter because a
funeral was taking place in the
building, and also because the
Brailovskv apartment was un
der "sanitary restriction" for
fumigation. •'You're acting im
properly." he told the cor
respondents. "This is none of
your affair."
Mrs. Brailovskv, a 45-year
old mathematician, challenged
the 10 men to no avail.
it is my apartment, these
are my guests." she said of the
correspondents and a small
group of Jewish scientists wait
ing nearby. "This is not your
apartment house. Go home."

one of the plainclothes agents
ordered.
In all. some 35 to 40 scientists
and engineers were turned awav
Sunday, among them former
university professors and labo
ratory directors. Several said
that as a matter of principle
they would not change the semi
nar's location.
"We have nothing to hide,
nothing to be ashamed of." said
one. Moving the seminar to an
other apartment, he added,
would only expose another fami
ly to the possibility of arrest.
Sunday evening. Mrs.
Brailovskv said that four men
using abusive language ac
costed her and her son at the en
trance to their apartment while

tour other men looked on from a
black Volga parked nearby.
Police arrested her husband
Victor. 45. on Nov. 13 and
charged him with "detaining
the Soviet state and social sys
tem," a charge carrying a max
imum sentence of three years in
prison. Mrs. Brailovsky said
that the Moscow prosecutor's
office has refused to explain the
grounds for the charge. He is
being held incommunicado in
Butyrki Prison. Under Soviet
law. prisoners may be detained
for up to nine months for in
vestigation.
Mrs. Brailovsky said that au
thorities have also given no rea
son why the seminars have not
been allowed to continue. They
began in 1972.
Victor Brailovsky is a
cyberneticist and a former edi
tor of an unofficial journal
called 'Jews in the U.S.S R."
Publication stopped under po
lice pressure in June 1979.
