# Alumnus engineer featured at ASME job discussion series
## 
### Jennifer Seymour 
This year Stanford's
ASME Chapter (American
Society of Mechanical Engi
neers ). headed by Senior Jeff
Langston. has sponsored a
series of nine lunch dis
cussions with currently em
ployed engineers. The series
was organized, according to
Langston. to "help Stanford
ME's think about their goals
and get impressions of what
working's really like."
Meeting for the second
time last Wednesday at noon
in Terman Engineering Cen
ter. student ME's listened to
alumnus Dan Eitch. a fourth
year employee of Palo Alto's
Systems Control Inc. (SCI).
Eitch graduated from
Stanford in 1976 with a Mas
ter's Degree in thermos
ciences and a Bachelor's
degree in Mechanical Engi
neering and went to work for
SCI.
Wednesday, he spoke to a
small group of student ME's.
His topics included a descrip
tion of personal projects as
well as general thoughts re
garding full-time em
ployment in the science in
dustries.
"Take the summer off
before you go to work, be
cause you sure won't have
the three-month vacation
again." Eitch said. "The
hardest thing to get used to is
getting your motivation up to
grind out on problems for
eight hours every day. I was
much more suited to the
academic style of working a
little, breaking, working,
then taking another
break.
Eitch was hired to work on
a specific project — designs
for a stratified charge engine
— about which he had pre
vious knowledge. This sort of
hiring is common for smaller

firms such as SCI. according
to Fitch.
"It may be a little short
sighted of companies to hire
for specific skills like that,
though," commented Fitch.
" Once the project is com
plete. then you've got to find
somewhere else to put your
self."
In Fitch's case, this was no
problem. Through his work
on car systems' designs, he
gained experience working

"Take the summer off
before you ffo to work —
you 'II never have the
three-month vacation
again.'

in softwares programming.
This has subsequently be
come his main field of en
deavor.
Fitch then emphasized an
other aspect of working for a
smaller consulting firm:
■"There is a huge variety of
unspecialized projects we're
involved in. and the com
panies tend to recognize indi
vidual preferences whenever
possible. This gives you the
opportunity to work on loads
of different projects."
Fitch also addressed
himself to the issue of spe
cialization within a field:
"Graduating with just a BS
definitely does not disadvan
tage you in technical train
ing. There's really not much
difference between a BS and
a Master's in that sense. Ec
onomically. you're probably
talking the difference be
tween about $18,000 and
$24,000. starting salary. Con
sidering what an extra year
of Stanford will cost you,
that's not much difference. It
all depends on what you want
to do and learn about."
Fitch said he is just begin

ning to find. alter tour years
of working on everything
from more efficient car sys
tems to complete Turnkey
Computer Programs, he's
ready to specialize down
some.
This diversity, common to
local science industries em
ployees. seems to go hand-in
hand with their versatility.
According to Kitch. it is fair
ly common for engineers to
change jobs as their intellec
tual interests change or they
get offered a higher-salary
job.
The outcome of this
mobility often takes the form
of independent projects and
ventures, according to Fitch.
"This is where it all can get
really challenging. People
start looking for independent
ideas. Then they can gener
ate their own business con
tracts and projects. " he
said.
'SCI in fact began in that
vein, when three individuals
left positions at SHI to form
their own consulting firm in
1%8. SCI is now comprised of
400 people, and recently ex
panded to include Olsen Labs
in Anaheim. It is nonethe
less. "relatively small"
compared to similar firms in
this area.
Fitch said he appreciated
the relaxed atmosphere and
comfortable settings of his
job. Fitch also commented
on the advantages of having
nights and weekends for
yourself once out of school.
"And it's nice having the
money to do all those things
you never had the money for
in college." he said
Fitch concluded by saying.
"Just ask a lot of questions.
You won't fit in right away,
but the more questions you
ask. the more immediately
vou'll fit in."
