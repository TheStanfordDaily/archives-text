# Polish Politburo urges return to 'law and order'
## 
### 
From Daily wire services
Warsaw, Poland — Poland's Com
munist Party called yesterday for a
return to law and order after shaking
up the Politburo and elevating a hard
line, ex-police boss to the ruling body.
The Communist Party Central Com
mittee dealt with divisions in the lead
ership bv dropping four members
trom the 12-member Politburo. The
move was seen as a consolidation of
First Secretary Stanislaw Kania's
power.
Two new Politburo members were
named: Mieczyslaw Moczar, a former
interior minister who fell from power
after his police suppressed worker
riots in 1970, and Tadeusz Grabski,
purged two years ago by Edward
Gierek and named a deputy prime
minister after Gierek was ousted on
Sept. 5.
The Politburo shakeup was the
fourth major reshuffling since the
worker strikes spread in August.
Moczar a surprise
Poles were most surprised, how
ever. by Moczar's return. One of the
most controversial figures in Polish
politics. Moczar, 67, made his first bid
ior power in 1967 when he led a cam
paign against .Jews in Poland. He has a
reputation as a staunch nationalist.
In recent months, however, he
projected a new image for himself as a
strong, clean politician who stands
ready to prevent the country's drift
toward chaos. He has also balanced
calls for order with a conciliatory
stance on the new independent trade
union movement.
Political analysts now regard
Moczar as one of the three strongest
figures in the 10-man Politburo along
with Kania and Stefan Olszowski, who
is in charge of economic reforms.
The new party line emerging from
the Central Committee urges con
trolled reform. The Polish leadership
is aware of the need for the Com
munist Party to remain a cohesive and
united body if Soviet intervention is to
be avoided.
A communique marking the end of
the committee's two-day session
warned against those "trying to push
the new trade unions into the blind al
ley of political opposition." And
Kania. in a speech to miners in south
ern Poland, said some members of the
new Solidarity union were exploiting
the right to strike. He urged miners to
help in "restoring law and order in our
country as soon as possible."
West warns Soviets
As the revamped leadership re
newed efforts to deal with militant
trade unions and economic crises,
there were warnings from Western
capitals against a Soviet intervention.
Moscow, in turn, accused the West of
increasing tensions in Poland.
In Washington, President Jimmy
Carter expressed concern yesterday
about the buildup of Soviet forces
along Poland's border. Carter told the
Russians that military action against
Poland "would have the most negative
consequences."
In a terse statement issued by the

White House, the president warned
that U.S. policies "toward the Soviet
Union would be directly and very ad
versely affected by any Soviet use of
force in Poland."
The president called the Russian
military buildup "unprecedented."
"Foreign military intervention in
Poland would have most negative con
sequences for East-West relations in
general and U.S.-Soviet relations in
particular," Carter said.
No move so far
Other U.S. officials said there is no
evidence the Soviets have decided to
move troops across the Polish border
but one Carter aide told reporters
"there has been indication of growing
Soviet readiness to engage" in mili
tary intervention. The aide, who asked
for anonymity, said there were no
signs such action was imminent.
"There's no evidence that a de
cision to intervene has been made,"
Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
said during a news conference.
But Muskie said Russian military
preparations on the Polish frontier are
continuing.
"Whether or not what they are in
dulging in is in the form of exercises or
the form of pressure upon the partici
pants in the Polish political and eco
nomic struggle, one can only
speculate," he said. "The fact is that
military preparations have proceeded
and are proceeding."
Asked whether the U.S. had ruled
out a military response to a Russian
invasion of Poland, Muskie replied,
"That's a good question to which we
ought to leave the Russians in doubt."
Muskie also told reporters that
among the early casualties of any Rus
sian military action would be the 1975
Helsinki agreement onEuropean se
curity. The agreement was designed
to ease tensions between East and
West.
A Russian invasion "would be such
a direct violation of the Helsinki
agreement it could well destroy it,"
Muskie said.
Psychological war
in Moscow, the Soviet government
newspaper Izvestia accused Western
news media of trying to incite trouble
in Poland and of launching a "true psy
chological war" against Poland.
Moscow Radio quoted Kania telling
the Central Committee in Warsaw
that "groups of persons connected
with subversive centers abroad have
infiltrated into the trade union move
ment in Poland."
Yesterday evening, Soviet tele
vision warned that forces "hostile to
socialism" were trying to wrest "po
litical concessions" from the govern
ment. The Soviet commentaries and
news reports reflected continuing So
viet concern with the Polish situation.
The consensus among foreign ob
servers in Warsaw is that the Kremlin
would invade Poland as a last resort —
and has already made suitable cont
ingency plans. But in view of the
enormous political and economic
costs involved, all other means of re
storing stability would be explored
first.
