Jordan connected with the Persian Gulf
war?
A: King Hussein is a vociferous supporter
• of Iraq, offered it military support and or
ganized a supply line to Iraq through the
Jordanian port of Aqaba. Assad, a longtime
foe of the Iraqi regime, has reportedly given
aid to Iran, laying himself open to charges
of being a traitor to Arab nationalism, since

the Iraqis are Arabs and the Iranians are
not.
Q: What are the roots of the conflict?
A: Both nations want to take the lead in
resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict and each
has the backing of a rival superpower. Syr
ian newspapers have focused on reports that
Hussein was laying the groundwork for a go

negotiating table to represent Arab in
terests.
Q: Are there other causes?

because Assad has gone so tar, deploying
50.000 troops and 1200 tanks along the 186-
mile border. Facing them are about 30.000
Jordanian troops and hundreds of tanks, and
Hussein is mobilizing 30,000 reservists. The
two armies stand only six miles apart and
are concentrated near the Syrian town of
Deraa and the Jordanian town of Ramtha.
Q Have the two countries fought before?
A: Yes, in September 1970 Syria sent an
armored column into Jordan to aid Palesti
nian guerrillas who were the target of a
crackdown by King Hussein's Bedouin
army. Under pressure from the Soviet Un
ion and the United States, Assad, who was
then defense minister, did not supply air
cover for the column, and the Jordanians
drove the Syrians back across the border.
