What's fun, free and not even harmful to your
health? The ninth annual Stanford Christmas
Kaire, presented by Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) this weekend.
In addition to San Francisco's "human
jukebox," wandering minstrels, mimes, musi
cians. jesters and jugglers will appear at Tres
idder tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.
More than 80 artisans, selected from over 600
applicants, will sell hand-made products. Crafts
and goods range from ceramics, clothing, jew
elry, leather and woodworking to hotdogs,
knishes, Vietnamese food, crepes and tarts.
According to Jean Martin, STARTS program
director, "It's a warm easy, colorful event just
before finals."
STARTS receives a 20 percent promoters' fee
from all items sold. Last year STARTS grossed
$17,000 and earned $13,000 after deducting operat
ing expenses. The fair is the prime fund-raising
activity of the non-profit volunteer organization,
and funds are used to sponsor noon concerts,
films, exhibits, lectures and special events.
According to Lisa Verhovek, assistant director,
"We don't have to do any soliciting."
Photographic slides from the many applicants
are screened by the student commitee and then

112 inalists are personally interviewed.
Quality, uniqueness and prices of the hand
crafted work and the friendliness of the artisan
are important factors in selection, said Verhovek.
"It's not commercial," said Martin. "We are
not interested in imported things."
She added that the fair will have slightly more
"new blood" this year. About 80 percent of the
artisans return each year.
"A lot of people come back looking for the old
crafts people," she said. Craftsmen come from
throughout the West Coast.
The fair has mushroomed in its nine-year his
tory. When the festival began, a mere three
STARTS staffers solicited craftsmen for 40
booths. The current student board of 50 must turn
down applicants.
"It started as just a pleasant Christmas festiv
ity," said Martin, the founder of'the fair.
She said STARTS did not originally expect the
festival to make money. "But we saw the poten
tial,' she said
The fair is run by the student board. "They're
the ones that put it into motion," said Martin
Board members will wear STARTS piggy shirts
tor identification. But other people are en
couraged to come in costume.
"We want the fair to have a Renaissance feel
inn." said Martin
