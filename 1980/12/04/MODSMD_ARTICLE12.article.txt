# Weapon-makers call ads 'comforting'; with promises to 'keep the talons sharp'
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” The nation's weapon
makers have concluded that the "never
again" hangover from Vietnam has faded to
the point where they can profitably ad
vertise how they could help the American
military fight in distant lands.
Marching through armed services maga
zines. the aerospace trade press and general
audience publications, are ads that defense
contractors themselves concede would have
disturbed the public during and immediate
ly after the war in Vietnam.
"We would have considered that ad in
sensitive two or three years ago," conceded
William Perreault, Lockheed's vice presi
dent for corporate communications, refer
ring to a two-page ad that carries a head
line: "Helping to keep the eyes sharp and
the talons strong. Lockheed knows how."
But given the changed national mood
toward defense, Perreault said, Lockheed
believes the ad that might have been found
offensive during Vietnam is now "comfort
ing."
"It is comforting to the citizens to realize
there are people doing this work and making
substantial advances," he said.
In addition to advertising the breadth of
its weaponry. Lockheed is among those de
fense contractors who are zeroing in on the
Persian Gulf. "Introducing the Diego Gar
cia-lndian Ocean air shuttle." proclaims a
recent ad ballyhooing how useful

Lockheed's S-3A Viking plane would be for
delivering spare parts and other items from
the American storehouse on Diego Garcia to
aircraft carriers guarding Persian Gulf oil
routes. The Viking can land on a carrier
deck.
"Tomorrow's assault force is just over
the horizon," states Rohr Marine Inc. in ad
vertising a high-speed ship that could "open
to assault four to iive times the coastal sites
that could be used by our Marine Corps to
day." Such a message would have been a
lightning rod for trouble during Vietnam.
' We do see a greater willingness to face
the realities in protecting our interests ov
erseas." said Larry Peeples, Rohr's public
relations director, acknowledging that his
company is responding to this changed
mood.
Teledyne Ryan Electronics, in an effort
to get a piece of the new action as the Pen
tagon spends billions on Persian Gulf
forces, is advertising how its equipment
could help the Marines in hitting the beach
right on the button "
And Todd Shipyards Corp. is warning in
its ads these days that the United States is so
dependent on foreign oil and other minerals
that it had better get busy building up its
merchant fleet and Navy.
"How will we keep this island functioning
without ships 0 " asks Todd in one full-page
ad.
"That's an advocacy ad." said Robert

Daniels. Todd's public relations director,
We're trying to influence the adminis
tration and the Congress to beef up the
merchant marine and the Navy.'' Todd has
a vested interest in both, because it builds
cargo vessels and Navy warships.
Another defense company executive, who
did not wish to be quoted by name, said con
tractors, as well as trying to cash in on
higher defense budgets and the Pentagon's
newly aroused appetite for weaponry for in
tervening in distant trouble spots, also are
under pressure by the armed services to ad
vertise more.
' The customer," he said in referring to
the Army, Navy, Air Force or Marine
Corps, "often asks us to help sell the project
to the administration and Congress through
advertising."
The services are supposed to keep arm's
length from the contractors on such mat
ters. but in real life they often are allied in
trying to influence a government decision.
Pentagon executives acknowledge that
their new emphasis on gearing up for Per
sian Gulf operations is a honeypot for de
fense contractors: an extra $30 billion over
the next five years, on top of already high
military budgets.
One side effect of all the advertising could
be to condition the public and federal de
cision-makers to the idea that intervening
militarily in such distant areas would be an
acceptable use of American power.
