## David Sartoris Family problems beleaguer our nation 
### 
Ask the average American
citizen to name our nation's
greatest current problem, and
the reply is likely to focus on the
economy, unemployment, the
arms race, drug and alcohol
abuse, or inadequate decision
making in government In reali
ty. the most serious threat to
continuing success of the United
States is the decline of the
American family. This dilem
ma is one which we and our capi
talist system are guilty of creat
ing, as well as one which only we
are capable of changing.
To the American man of the
past, employment was a means
of self and family support, pro
viding pride and self-satisfac
tion from the knowledge that
work was beneficial to the lives
of others. Increasing emphasis
on productivity and job status
has created the alternative life
style of the career-oriented indi
viduals whose life is his work.
The unfortunate but natural
tendency for most has been to
attempt both: simultaneously
raising a famly and maintaining
a demanding career In far too
many instances, the end result
is the well-known child who nev
er sees Daddy, and turns instead
to drugs, alcohol, or crime for
the attention he or she deserves.
Of course, this tragic situ
ation might be obviated in the
presence of a "super woman"
whose extra effort on the home

tront makes up for her hus
band s absence. Unfortunately
for the children of America, to
increasingnumbers of women in
this country, "super woman"
does not mean "super Mom."
Instead, it means becoming
doctors, lawyers, nurses, busi
ness people, and other wage
earners. The end result of these
trends is that millions of Ameri
can children are. practically
speaking, being raised by hired
sitters, without the love, gui
dance. and attention of their pa
rents.
It is all too common to hear
adults criticize the younger gen
eration for being less con
siderate. hardworking, and sen
sible than they had been as chil
dren and adolescents. We blame
these individuals for too much
television watching, poor
academic performance and
reading ability, rampant addic
tion to drugs and alcohol, and
numerous criminal acts. What
we often fail to realize is that
many of these problems are sec
ondary to our own shortcomings
as parents.
As an undergraduate at Stan
ford. 1 was impressed by one
common feature of my
classmates: all had parents who
cared how their lives turned out.
Thus, in order to produce decent
kids, parents need to give them
the time and positive en
couragement that thev deserve.

An increasing number of
American adults with children
are guilty of being selfish In al
lowing a career to hold a higher
priority than one's own off
spring. the individual demon
strates a greater concern for his
or her own lifetime over what is
left behind
Furthermore, there is the
tragic scenario of divorce, the
incidence of which has reached
alarming proportions. Rather
than make the necessary sacri
fices to overcome marital dif
ficulties tor the sake of their
children, many couples proceed
more readily to separation
In doing so. they demonstrate
a greater care for their own
futures than those of their chil
dren " Kramer vs. Kramer."
Hollywood's recent rendition of
divorce viewed through the eyes
of a child vividly portrayed its
tragic impact on a youngster's
life.
The obvious solution to the
growing problem of child neg
lect is a greater recognition of
what might be termed "respon
sibility for reproduction " To
bring a new life into this
crowded and complicated world
means having the willingness
and means to insure its happi
ness and success. Personal
achievement and pleasure must
not come before the provision of
adequate love. time, encourage
ment. and attention to thegrow

ing child. The couple that is un
willing or unprepared to mold
their lives in these ways has no
business having children, for
neglected offspring hold great
potential for future social prob
lems as adults.
Thus, it is clear that if we as a
society desire a more problem
tree civilization, we need to
direct attention away from our
own generation and towards
that which is to follow One need
only observe any other species
on earth to recognize that this is
the way that nature wants it to
be. Our offspring are ultimate
reason for our existence as well
as the only everlasting human
creation.
