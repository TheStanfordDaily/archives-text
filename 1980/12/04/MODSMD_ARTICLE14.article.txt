## White males have advantage 
### 
If I were a white male in
America today 1 would be think
ing very hard
The past 10 years. 1 know,
cannot have been easy for
thoughtful white men. Those
who support the liberation of
people of color and women have
been particularly susceptible to
frustration, guilt, and self
doubt, emotions which are. at
worst, paralysing, and, at best,
negative motivations for action.
Today few careful theorists
or writers would sweepinglv in
dict all white men for problems
which have historical roots in
political or economic systems.
Even if those systems are main
tained by white men, it is dan
gerous to speak in generalities:
Some have been receptive to
change, some work to advance
underrepresented groups, some
have reevaluated their careers
and relationships in the wake of
feminist or Third World
criticism.
I would think hard just the
same. Privilege which has
amassed and solidified for cen
turies cannot be shucked in a
generation or two. If I were a
white man I would worry about
signs that a reaffirmation of the
great white male, for all the
wrong reasons, is aborning in
North America.
The reaffirmation is one of
fact as well as mood. President
elect Keagan is making no se
cret of his preference for white
men — mostly millionares like
himself — to stock his Cabinet

(Perhaps the handful of Presi
dential advisors are less pow
erful than the shadowy cadres of
white male corporate ex
ecutives. but corporations at
least do not pretend to fairly re
flect or represent Americans, i
If I were a white man I would
watch the orchestrations of the
next mostly male, mostly white
Congress with concern: serious
noises are being emitted about
the repeal of the Voting Rights
Act. about banning abortion and
busing by Constitutional
Amendment, reviving the
House Un-American Activities
Committee.
And I would be shuddering at
the Ku Klux Klan's growing ap
peal not only in towns and cities
but on college campuses. If I
were a white man I would be
looking for ways to counteract
that appeal. And I would ques
tion the literature of the"men's
liberation" movement, a self
congratulatory reaction to
feminist analysis which focuses
on one-upping women in the
struggle for personal liberation
Whether or not I supported
these trends. 1 could be prepar
ing myself to deal with a
backlash against white men be
cause when conflicts build,
white men as a group may be
held responsible. When push
comes to shove, those who need
voting rights protection, those
who are tired of being denied
equal access to education, those
who have few means to make
their complaints heard without

exacting persecution, will
polarize on the offensive. Some
groups are just tired of celebrat
ing white men.
In hard times, white men who
aren't obviously working for
equity might bear the brunt of
others' anger It is easy to as
sume. when the stakes are high,
that those who are not with you
are against you.
I hope the assumption proves
false, though a left-leaning male
friend recently advanced the
point He told me that leftist
groups which occupy buildings,
parade and chant, or otherwise
draw public attention, are more
exhibitionists than serious polit
ical forces.
My friend is a white man who
has never had to take to the
streets to defend his rights, let
alone his privileges. Maybe an
issue which touches him direct
ly would change his mind, may
be not. Regardless, he seems
likely to perch, with many other
white men. in an uncomfortable
spot between self-righteous in
action and guilt in the '80s. As
such, he is vulnerable both to
mindless reassurances of his
noble birthright and to accusa
tions of hypocrisy.
No one chooses to be born a
white male because of the
amenities attached, of course,
and the majority of white men
would never consciously exploit
their accidents of birth But
merely being male, merely
being white, brings advantages
which must be acknowledged
before they can be rejected.
It is common for people of col
or and women to find that they
have internalized racist or sex
ist views. Admitting that we are
racist and sexist, and that we
sometimes benefit from institu
tionalized racism and sexism, is
the first step toward change.
White men have a powerful per
sonal interest in thinking about
that.
