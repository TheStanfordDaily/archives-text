## History hints creative order 
### 
I would like to add some thoughts on the debate
over Western Culture It seems to me that most
arguments have turned on the utility of such
study, be it the usefulness of examining elite' cul
ture in an egalitarian'society. or the dangers of
refusing to renew our cultural foundations by ref
erence to our own Western tradition. While utili
ty is an interesting approach to nebulous ques
tions. in this case 1 believe that it distorts the real
issue: namely, whether the study of Western Cul
ture promotes an understanding of the lack of
causality in human affairs in general.
The advances of science and the faith in tech-

6 lt estern Culture gives us a way
of seeing ourselves, n self
knowledge anchored in past
heritage.'

nology which they have inspired create illusions
as to how people might solve, or at least approach,
the great questions before them. Instead of accep
ting that the unexpected has just as much chance
of occurring as the expected, we cling to the no
tion that a causal framework exists to explain all
behavior. This belief has been perpetuated by the
scientific revolution in part at the expense of
the Humanities.
Kven science, despite the causal approach, has
the uncertainty' principle at the core of its theo
ry; a causal approach to the lack of causality! Yet
science has provided us with many revelatory in
sights.

Nevertheless, while science sometimes be
lieves that it can almost replace traditional re
ligion. one cannot forget that the scientist must,
ultimately, take a leap of faith when trying to pro
vide answers of causality to the eternal mysteries
of the universe. %
What Western Culture gives us is a way of
seeing ourselves, a self-knowledge anchored on
past heritage. Though we are forced to solve prob
lems unique to our own time, history, by providing
us with patterns of human affairs over time, hints
at a creative, rational order. This order is a syn
thesis that has as its basis associations and cor
related relationships that do not presume to re
duce human beings, human affairs, and nature to
a precise scientific causality.
This very fact makes the study of such complex
ity paramount in our technocratic age, as a buffer
to the increasing incursions of scientific ration
alism. The same technological facility which al
lowed us to put men on the moon has produced
enormous amounts of nuclear waste without an
effective method of disposal.
Western Culture cannot deny the achievements
of science; it does not attempt to do so. Rather it
gives these successes greater illumination when
compared with the centuries when such advances
were unimaginable.
Hut more important. Western Culture provides
a humanistic perspective on Man, a creature of
both the rational and irrational, in a world without
clear causal direction. Armed with this view of
their predicament, people are better able to
pursue their destiny without alienating their na
ture and heritage in the process.
