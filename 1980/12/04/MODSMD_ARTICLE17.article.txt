Constructive?
The protests of Debbie Larue
(Daily, Dec. 2i, neighborhood
coordinator for an Kscondido
highrise. somewhat irk us. She
complains that a proposed in
crease in rent for a one bedroom
Kscondido apartment from $132
to $148.fit) per person per month
is unfair, because about one
fourth of this increase is being
used to help subsidize construc
tion of new undergraduate hous
ing.
Attention to a few points
shows her griping to be merely
silly:
11 Kven in the light of the pro
posed rent increase. Kscondido
residents are still getting a
fireat deal with respect to price
and location. We are both
paying about $200 per month to
share studio apartments; and it
takes about 20 to 25 minutes to
bike into campus Almost every
undergraduate we know living
off-campus is paying com
parable or higher rates, and is
living at least as far, or farther,
away from campus.
2) Larue feels that it is unfair
lor graduates to partially sub
sidize undergraduate housing,
but it is the undergraduates'
housing costs which indirectly
help to subsidize low-cost
Kscondido housing for over 2000
spouses and children of Stan
ford students. If non-student

Kscondido residents paid Palo
Alto-competitive rents, under
graduates and graduates alike
could share reduced costs.
ill The forced independence
ol undergraduates who must
live off-campus lor a year has to
be more unsettling to them —
just two to four years after leav
ing their parents' homes than
it is to older, presumably more
independent, graduales.
41 Graduates are allowed to
live in Kscondido as lung us sec
en years (according to a sum
mer Daily article), while under
graduates can usually remain
on campus only three years.
ij) Kscondido residents shar
ing a one bedroom apartment
last year paid approximately
the same as undergraduates
sharing one room in Stern Hall
and Stern residents are
forced in addition to pay exorbi
tant prices for notoriously bad
food.
ti i Many Kscondido residents
are married to non-students,
and these spouses are able to
bring in a full-time income to
help pay housing costs.
71 The new undergraduate
housing complex will allow un
dergraduates to move out of
Manzanita, opening up :i4H new
places on-campus for gradu
ates. Thus. Kscondido rent in
creases will actually help al
leviate the graduate housing
crunch.

As undergraduates forced to
live off-campus this year, thus
separated from a large portion
of campus activity, we cast
skeptical eyes at the worth of
Larue's complaints.

Hoover power
1 wish to call attention to
some of the opinions expressed
by members of the Hoover In
stitution in a recent article (San
Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 7). In
one instance. Peter Duignan. a
20-vear veteran of the Hoover
Institution, is reported as
saying that "the United States
should never recognize a Marx
ist regime or be fooled into
backing national liberation
112 ronts with Marxist elements."
He also asserted that "Marxist
governments that have taken
power have been far bloodier
and oppressive than anything
dreamed of by right wing re
gimes."
The latter statement is pat
ently untrue. The former
statement is typical of the gross
oversimplifications that have in
(he past caused U.S. policy
makers to insist that every for
eign country is either for "us"
or for "them."
Tragically, it is a self-fulfill
ing prophesy. Had individuals of
Duignan's persuasion been in
the White House during the re
cent popular revolution in
Nicaragua, the U.S., by a dis
play of ill will, may have driven
the new coalition government
towards the Soviets. For
tunately. cooler heads prevailed
in Washington and the U.S. pro
vided much needed supplies —
not in return for subservience

from the Nicaraguans, but in or
der that a popular independent
government might strengthen
itself.
It may take years for the U.S.
to regain a measure of respect
and good will in Nicaragua fol
lowing our 40 years of support
for the Somozas. Hopefully, it
will be a respect for our help and
expertise — medical, financial,
agricultural, managerial and
otherwise — and our good inten
tions. rather than respect for a
repressive exercise of Ameri
can muscle.
For Duignan the presence of
what he calls "Marxist ele
ments" in the present
Nicaraguan government is rea
son enough to withdraw our sup
port. Duignan is interested in a
National Security Council post.
There is no paucity of disturb
ingly reactionary statements in
this and other articles on the
Hoover Institution. Rather than
examine these statements one
by-one, I hope to draw attention
to the fact that these positions
are being given credibility by
continued wide (and uncritical)
exposure. The Chronicle even
takes the editorial liberty to
suggest that it was merely
"academic fashion" to shun the
Hoover Institution's ' uncom
promising line towards com
munism."
