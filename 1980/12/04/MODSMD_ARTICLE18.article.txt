# Free market economics abandoned
## Chinese return to planned system 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beijing â€” Faced with bigger,
more complex problems than
foreseen, China is stepping back
from its experiment with free
market economics and is reim
posing a large measure of cen
tral planning, it was disclosed
here Tuesday.
The nation had attempted to
restructure its economy by giv
ing greater play to market
forces but now intends to pro
long a period of readjustment
with tighter controls on spend
ing and renewed limits on in
dustrial managers.
The decision, disclosed by the
Communist Party newspaper
People's Daily after a debate of
more than a month within the
top Chinese leadership, will halt
many of the present reforms
broadening the powers of indi
vidual enterprises to make their
own decisions on production,
marketing and investments, an
essential element of the mixed
economy that China seemed to
envisage during tht last year.
Instead, it will re-establish
the authority of the country's
central planners with an un
disguised return from the tryout
of "regulation by the market"
to what the People's Daily
called "necessary adminis
trative interference" in the
economy.
Politically, the decision ap
pears to represent a victory for
the "but faction." ridiculed only
last month bv the Communist
Party's Theoretical Journal for
praising the country's new poli
cies but always adding an objec
ting "but" and for the massive
Chinese bureaucracy, which
had resisted the reduction of its
power that the reforms in
volved.
"It is wrong to think that
since enterprises are entrusted
with self-decision powers, there
is no need for any kind of gui
dance on their planning and
there should not be any kind of
administrative interference,"
the newspaper commentary de
clared. "And it is also wrong to
think that this (guidance and ad
ministrative interference) will
kill the already enlivened eco
nomic situation."
Although the authorities will
use some economic levers de
veloped recently as part of the
reforms, "we must use the nec
essary administrative in
terference as well," the Peo
ple's Daily said, arguing that

this is the hallmark of a "cen
tralized and unified leadership"
and thus of a planned economy.
This retreat will inevitably
raise questions about the future
of other reforms based on simi
lar philosophies that have been
undertaken in the past two years
or are being shaped now in areas
ranging from education and cul
tural policy to family planning
and minority rights.
The plans for broadened in
dustrial democracy appear to
be in particular jeopardy, for
the workers' congresses that
are being established to govern
each enterprise could now have
no real authority. Similarly, the
reassertion of central controls
over all local governments, in
cluding their budgets, could
pervert recent county-level
elections and the decentraliza
tion of power that has begun.
The problems that developed
during the economic liber
alization and the fear that they
would grow out of control are
found equally in these other
areas, and the Peoples' Daily
editorial, taking up two-thirds
of its front page Tuesday, gave
no reassurance that this would
not be an across-the-board re
treat.
The decision, as explained by
the Peoples' Daily, calls for
stronger central planning, not
the weakening envisioned up to
a month ago; for tighter con
trols on provincial and local
governments and on industrial
and commercial enterprises,
not the increased autonomy
promised at the National Peo
ple's Congress in September,
and for only the most modest re
forms of the economy, not the
thorough restructuring that top
Chinese economists have in
sisted was essential.
What has happened, the Peo
ple's Daily said, is that the first
two years of what was to be a
three-year period of read
justment and reform uncovered
far more serious economic
problems than the leadership
anticipated.
Disruption caused by the con
vulsive, decade-long Cultural
Revolution and its radical poli
cies was not rectified, the paper
said, before a massive econom
ic expansion was started follow
ing the death of Chairman Mao
Zedong in 1976. Since then.
China has found itself running
short of oil and coal, suffering
from a "disastrous" harvest

this year and from budget defi
cits that will probably run to $30
billion or moreover three years.
The problem, it appears from
the People's Daily call for a "re
alistic approach" to these dif
ficulties, is that no one is certain
how to deal with them in a new
system where market forces
and other economic levers are
used with only limited central
planning.
The solution has been to go
back to the old system, at least
until the country is through its
present difficulties. Although
criticized as outmoded, inflex
ible and unsuited to China, and
as the cause of much of what is
wrong with the economy, that
system is nonetheless familiar
to both the top leadership and
the bureaucracy.
A major consideration in the
decision, according to senior
Chinese economists, is the need

to begin the next stage ot re
torms, including the extremely
complicated revision of the
price system.
"We could not stand still,"
one official said Tuesday.
"Kither we undertook the new
reforms or went back to the old
system, hopefully just for a
time, because most of what had
been achieved could be en
dangered if not supported with
further measures."
The efforts of the Communist
countries in Kastern Europe to
move away from the increasing
ly unworkable Stalinist econom
ic policies inherited from the So
viet Union all foundered on sim
ilar problems, and they have
had only mixed success in re
solving them over the last 15
years. Two major attempts at
economic reforms in the Soviet
Union itself have been curtailed
for nearly the same reasons.
