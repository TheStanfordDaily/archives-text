New Delhi — Afghan insurgents
fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan
continue to hold important strategic
positions, inflicting casualties and
damage, despite heavy Soviet rein
forcements, Western diplomatic
sources said here yesterday.
In the first assessment of the mili
tary situation in Afghanistan in sever
al weeks, the diplomats said the Soviet
Union had recently adopted a new
strategy to deal with the Moslem in
surgency. The plan was said to involve
joint Afghan-Soviet offensives in 20 of
the 28 Afghan provinces. Listed by the
diplomats, all 20 provinces are along
the borders of Pakistan, Iran or the So
viet Union.
In addition to these military ma
neuvers, the Soviets have launched
what the Western diplomats termed
"psychological warfare" on Pakistan,
encouraging rumors in the Afghan
capital of an imminent attack on Paki
stan by Afghan troops.
New troops
The report said that the Soviet mili
tary command has brought in 1000 to
2000 new troops and estimated the
present strength of Soviet forces in Af
ghanistan at "between 85.000 and
88.000."
The rumors of an Afghan attack on
Pakistan are being spread by top Af
ghan government officials, the
sources said Discounting any possi
bility of a Soviet attack on Pakistan,
they said that Afghan troops were in
no position to take on the Pakistanis.
The sources added: "It looks like
psychological warfare and we will not
be suprised if. in the near future, pro

vocating incidents occur on the Af
ghan-Pakistani border."
Air attacks
According to Pakistani claims, Af
ghan helicopter gunships violated Pa
kistani air space and attacked refugee
camps in Pakistan three times be
tween Sept. 26 and Oct. 24. On Sept, 26,
a formation of gunships from Afghan
istan allegedly attacked a Pakistani
border post in Bajour, killing two per
sons. Two days later, five helicopters
fired 10 rockets at Nowa and the last
incident occurred on Oct. 24 when six
Afghan gunships attacked two villages
and one Afghan refugee camp in north
Waziristan injuring three persons.
Kabul Radio later denied all the re
ports.
"In Kabul everyone is asking how
long the nationalist insurgents will
keep going, and we think it will largely
depend on what happens outside," the
sources said.
Nationalists united
"The Afghan nationalists are cer
tainly divided, but they are all united
on one point — the Soviets must go.
The Afghans are learning fast; they no
longer come on horseback to fight So
viet troops," the sources said.
"After li months, the Soviets can
only claim control of cities and rural
pockets in areas where they have a
large concentration of troops or the
presence of military convoys."
The largest Soviet military base is
in Kabul, with the bases in Shindan
(Western Afghanistan). Kunduz
(north), Phul-I-Kumari on the Salang
pass road to the Soviet Union,
Jalalabad (east), Kandahar (south),
Gardezand Ghazni (in the southeast),
the sources said.

The Soviets also have smaller per
manent infantry units in Herat and
Karah (bordering on Iran » and on the
highway connecting the Afghan capi
tal with the eastern city of Jalalabad.
Air strength
The main Soviet air strength is in
Kabul. Kandahar and Badahsan, with
landing facilities in Zindan, Kunduz
and Jalalabad, the sources said. They
added that this air strength is made up
of Mig-21 and Mig-17 fighters and
MI-28 and MI-8 helicopters.
The sources estimated Afghan gov
ernment troops at 30.000 most of them
in "non-combat state."
They reported that the governent
had mobilized 5000 party volunteers,
arming them to aid the troops in coun
tering the rebels. The report esti
mated the Afghan police at 10,000
But the rebels continue to fight the
better equipped Soviet and Afghan
government troops mostly with arms
either captured, brought by Afghan
government deserters or even, occa
sionally, sold by Russian soldiers to
Afghans.
The diplomats said there was
evidence that the rebels had shot down
helicopter gunships and damaged
tanks and armoured personnnel car
riers with anti-tank weapons. In short
range. if carefully fired, an anti-tank
weapon can damage an airborne heli
copter, the sources said.
Soviet soldiers continue to sell truck
parts, army winter uniforms and
sometimes arms to Afghans, the
diplomats reported. They cited the ex
ample of a Soviet soldier who recently
sold his AK-47 rifle for hashish worth
less than $1 in Kabul
