# Americans are 'over-warned'; no labels on booze, report says
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The government should not re
quire warning labels on alcoholic beverages like
the ones on cigarettes, according to a report sub
mitted to Congress Tuesday by the Departments
of Treasury and Health and Human Services.
But the health hazards of drinking alcohol, par
ticularly during pregnancy, warrant a major
campaign bv the government and the alcoholic
beverage industry to acquaint the public with the
risks, the report concludes.
The joint report was ordered by Congress late
last year to resolve a dispute over whether a
health warning should be required by law on all al
coholic beverages. A bill requiring such a warning
was passed by the Senate in May 1979. but the
House version struck out the requirement. Con
gress then passed a compromise law requiring the
two departments to study the issue.
According to the report's conclusion, the risks
of drinking alcohol are too complex and the ef
fects vary too much from person to person to con
vey the hazard accurately in a general warning.
The departments also felt that Americans have
been "over-warned" and might be more willing to
change their habits in response to changes in ad
vertising of alcoholic beverages and information
provided through doctors.
Despite recent studies indicating that drinking
in moderation may protect against heart disease,
the ill effects of alcohol on the body listed in the
report far outweigh the benefits. They include:
— Multiple risks to the fetus. Two drinks a week
during pregnancy have been shown to increase the
chances of miscarriage. Two drinks a day can
cause babies to weigh less at birth. And the Fetal
Alcohol Syndrome, a pattern of multiple de
formities and mental retardation, can occur fol
lowing various levels of alcohol intake.
— Increased risk of cancer, particularly cancer
of the mouth, larynx, esophagus and liver.
— Adverse effects on the heart, particularly de

terioration of the heart muscle. This effect is sep
arate from the possible protection provided by
moderate drinking against coronary disease.
— I )amage to the nervous system, present in 50
to 70 percent of alcoholics who enter treatment
programs.
— Contribution to diseases of the gastroin
testinal tract, particularly the liver and pancreas.
— Involvement in traffic deaths, one-third of
which are alcohol-related.
— Association with depression and suicide. Ap
proximately one-third of suicides involve alcohol
use.
— Dangerous interactions with drugs. Alcohol
drug interactions are the second most common
cause of drug-related medical crises.
The report recommends that Congress amend
existing laws governing labeling of alcoholic
beverages to provide for a uniform statement of
alcohol content: a measure of "percent by vol
ume. It also lists measures to be taken by the De
partment of Health and Human Services to in
crease the familiarity of doctors, nurses and other
health workers with the issue.
But it places most of the burden of public educa
tion on the beverage industry, with encourage
ment from federal agencies - backed up by the
threat that the warning laoel may be resurrected
it a voluntary campaign fails.
A spokesman for Sen Donald Riegle, chair
man of the Senate subcommittee on alcoholism
and drug abuse which introduced the warning
label bill, said the senator had not yet had the op
portunity to study the report.
A White House statement praised the report as
a useful summary of the risks of excessive alcohol
consumption, but said its conclusions about warn
ing labels did not reflect the Carter adminis
tration's view. In many circumstances, such
labels are preferable to other forms of govern
ment action, which might be more intrusive or
more costlv," it said.
