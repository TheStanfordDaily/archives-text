# Abscam jury begins deliberations

### Los Angeles Times 
New York — The jury in the Abscam trial
ot two veteran congressmen. Rep. John
Murphy (D-N.Y.) and Hep. Frank Thomp
son ili-N.J.), began deliberating bribery
and conspiracy charges Tuesday.
The jurors in Brooklyn 112 ederal court were
to choose between the prosecution's conten
tion that the congressmen accepted sepa
rate $50.000 payoffs from FBI agents and
the defense argument that they were set up
by an alleged co-conspirator, a bounty
hunter interested in delivering public of
ficials to undercover agents.
Murphy, a member of the House of Repre
sentatives for 18 years, and Thompson, a
member for 26. were accused of joining the
alleged co-conspirator, Howard Criden, in
accepting the payoffs. Testimony at the
more than two-week trial told how brief
eases of money were handed over during
two meetings with the congressmen.
Murphy and Thompson, the third and
fourth congressmen to be tried in the in
fluence-peddling cases, denied the charges.
They asserted that they did not know there
was any money in the briefcases, which one
of the FBI agents gave to Criden in their

presence. Criden is a Philadelphia lawyer
who still faces trial on the Abscam charges.
The FBI undercover agents posed as rep
resentatives of two fictitious Arab sheiks
who were seeking help in immigration mat
ters. At both meetings. Murphy and Thomp
son. according to testimony and videotapes,
told Criden to take the briefcases full of
money.
During one meeting. Thompson was seen
on television picking up the briefcase with
the money in it and handing it to Criden,
while telling him. "you look at that for me,
will you?" #
Thompson, who took the stand in his own
behalf, told the court that he believed the
briefcase contained documents pertaining
to investments in his congressional district
in central New Jersey.
During the trial. Hep. John Murtha (D-
Penn), who was named in the indictment of
Thompson and Murphy, also testified. The
government does not intend to prosecute
Murtha. who told the court that Thompson
had told him that the three congressmen
would split a $50,000 payment.
During his summation. Thomas Puccio,
the prosecutor, pictured both lawmakers as

sophisticated men. hardly lacking in ex
perience.
"Doesn't it defy common sense in this
world that there are two congressmen who
get the suitcase slipped by them without
knowing what was in it?" Puccio asked the
jury of eight men and four women.
Thompson's lawyer, Stephen Kaufman,
in turn, told the jurors that his client was an
honorable man who would not have risked
his years in Congress to take a payoff. He
sought to picture Criden as a "bounty
hunter' who had lured Thompson to meet
ings by telling him that the Arabs were in
terested in economic projects that would
help New Jersey.
Lawyers for Murphy charged that the
government had not proved its case beyond
a reasonable doubt. They stressed portions
of videotape during which Murphy denied
that he would ever take money. The prose
cutor sought to picture these statements by
Murphy as an "Academy Award per
formance'" staged after Murphy became
suspicious of the fictitious sheik's repre
sentatives.
Both Murphy and Thompson were de
feated in the November election.
