# Stern stunning in San Francisco

### Jim Edmondson 
Violin soloist Isaac Stern highlighted the
seventh subscription series concert of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra with a
stunning idiomatic performance of
Tchaikovsky's Concerto for Violin. Exhibit
ing mastery of his instrument and a strong
feeling tor his role as soloist. Stern nearly
left the San Franciscans behind as he
Hashed through Tchaikovsky's murderous
passages with all the romantic bravura that
the piece demands from its soloist.
His almost Tchaikovskian approach to
Mozart's Violin Concerto in D was less suc
cessful with the chamber setting of this
work, though Stern couldn't change gears
(6r he chose not to), so the Mozart was
tainted with the larger gestures of a later
period Sandwiched between these solos
was Igor Stravinsky's Divertimento from
The Fain's Kiss:, a ballet suite openly pat
terned after many of Tchaikovsky's works.
In this work guest conductor David Shallon
made his only significant contribution to the
evening's music, directing the engaging
dances with a spotlight on its many vir
tuosic solos.
Stern was always completely secure and
always the soloist. At times he turned and
played directly towards the first violins as if
to lead them, and during his solo cadenzas
he built to great climaxes, pausing to let his
full notes reverberate in the expanse of
Davies Symphony Hall. The orchestral ac

companiment was clearly secondary —
Stern was master. He set up an instant rap
port with the audience with his outgoing
style. In the Tchaikovsky he was thus
playing a piece practically written for him.
This ultra-romantic masterpiece seems
an attempt to transcend the boundaries of
the violin. The finale includes fast scales
and a build-up to where the solo violin must
play up to the forte sound of the entire or
chestra. In addition, many moods must
come from the violin, reflecting the emo
tional Russian character of Tchaikovsky's
music. Stern met these challenges handily.
His fortissimo sound was equal to the entire
violin section of the orchestra and his im
pressive array of bowing techniques reflect
ed accurately the temperaments in the mu
sic. Conductor Shallon was sometimes un
able to keep the orchestra up with Stern
with the result that many transitions and en
trances were shaky. The orchestra played
well, but the openness of Davies Hall re
vealed clearly the shortcomings in the
strings and lower-chair woodwinds.
The opening work was Mozart's 4th Vio
lin Concerto, a work written when Mozart
was 19 years old. Firmly set in late 18th cen
tury tradition, the work is nonetheless in
spired. It is decidedly chamberlike in quali
ty and contains many delicate piano pas
sages. Though Stern's forte was strong and
full, his piano was merely a shell of this

great tone. Further, he made the most dra
matic dynamic changes, resulting in nearly
a parody of Mozart's intimate setting. Stern
used the cadenzas of Joseph Joachim who
was born 75 years after Mozart and was in
Tchaikovsky's generation. The double-stops
were broadly played but not in keeping with
Mozart's concerto. As well, the orchestra
was large and not supple enough under
Shallon to express all of Mozart's nuances.
The Stravinsky Divertimento is a less
heard work, though unjustifiably so. Al
though it is true that Stravinsky has nearly
copied Tchaikovsky in parts, the work easi
ly stands on its own. Especially well-plaved
was the beginning Sinfonia, where hornist
David Krehbiel and bassoonist Stephen
Paulson deserve special credit. All the
woodwinds were impressive throughout the
piece as were the horns and trombones.
Again, the strings were weaker, which is
sad because they occupied' a central role in
the orchestra.
Davies Hall strikes me as too big. There
is a very high ceiling over the orchestra, the
loss to which is only partially offset by
moveable sound deflectors over the stage.
From my seat 1 could hear the winds and vi
olins well, but the soloist was slightly lost
and the 'cellos and violas were barely
audible. Nonetheless, the hall is a great im
provement over the opera house both visual
lv and sonically.

was large and not supple enough under
Shallon to express all of Mozart's nuances.
The Stravinsky Divertimento is a less
heard work, though unjustifiably so. Al
though it is true that Stravinsky has nearly
copied Tchaikovsky in parts, the work easi
ly stands on its own. Especially well-plaved
was the beginning Sinfonia, where hornist
David Krehbiel and bassoonist Stephen
Paulson deserve special credit. All the
woodwinds were impressive throughout the
piece as were the horns and trombones.
Again, the strings were weaker, which is
sad because they occupied' a central role in
the orchestra.
Davies Hall strikes me as too big. There
is a very high ceiling over the orchestra, the
loss to which is only partially offset by
moveable sound deflectors over the stage.
From my seat 1 could hear the winds and vi
olins well, but the soloist was slightly lost
and the 'cellos and violas were barely
audible. Nonetheless, the hall is a great im
provement over the opera house both visual

Violin soloist Isaac Stern highlighted the
seventh subscription series concert of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra with a
stunning idiomatic performance of
Tchaikovsky's Concerto for Violin. Exhibit
ing mastery of his instrument and a strong
feeling tor his role as soloist. Stern nearly
left the San Franciscans behind as he
Hashed through Tchaikovsky's murderous
passages with all the romantic bravura that
the piece demands from its soloist.
His almost Tchaikovskian approach to
Mozart's Violin Concerto in D was less suc
cessful with the chamber setting of this
work, though Stern couldn't change gears
(6r he chose not to), so the Mozart was
tainted with the larger gestures of a later
period Sandwiched between these solos
was Igor Stravinsky's Divertimento from
The Fain's Kiss:, a ballet suite openly pat
terned after many of Tchaikovsky's works.
In this work guest conductor David Shallon
made his only significant contribution to the
evening's music, directing the engaging
dances with a spotlight on its many vir
tuosic solos.
Stern was always completely secure and
always the soloist. At times he turned and
played directly towards the first violins as if
to lead them, and during his solo cadenzas
he built to great climaxes, pausing to let his
full notes reverberate in the expanse of
Davies Symphony Hall. The orchestral ac

companiment was clearly secondary —
Stern was master. He set up an instant rap
port with the audience with his outgoing
style. In the Tchaikovsky he was thus
playing a piece practically written for him.
This ultra-romantic masterpiece seems
an attempt to transcend the boundaries of
the violin. The finale includes fast scales
and a build-up to where the solo violin must
play up to the forte sound of the entire or
chestra. In addition, many moods must
come from the violin, reflecting the emo
tional Russian character of Tchaikovsky's
music. Stern met these challenges handily.
His fortissimo sound was equal to the entire
violin section of the orchestra and his im
pressive array of bowing techniques reflect
ed accurately the temperaments in the mu
sic. Conductor Shallon was sometimes un
able to keep the orchestra up with Stern
with the result that many transitions and en
trances were shaky. The orchestra played
well, but the openness of Davies Hall re
vealed clearly the shortcomings in the
strings and lower-chair woodwinds.
The opening work was Mozart's 4th Vio
lin Concerto, a work written when Mozart
was 19 years old. Firmly set in late 18th cen
tury tradition, the work is nonetheless in
spired. It is decidedly chamberlike in quali
ty and contains many delicate piano pas
sages. Though Stern's forte was strong and
full, his piano was merely a shell of this

great tone. Further, he made the most dra
matic dynamic changes, resulting in nearly
a parody of Mozart's intimate setting. Stern
used the cadenzas of Joseph Joachim who
was born 75 years after Mozart and was in
Tchaikovsky's generation. The double-stops
were broadly played but not in keeping with
Mozart's concerto. As well, the orchestra
was large and not supple enough under
Shallon to express all of Mozart's nuances.
