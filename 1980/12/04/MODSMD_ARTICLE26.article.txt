## 'Getting Out' too bleak 
### Stephen Nash 
Prisons are brutal. Rape and
murder thrive there. Solitary
confinement is used as psy
chological torture. Even such
small freedoms as choice of
clothing are taken away. We use
them to deal with those people
who don't measure up to "pub
licly acceptable standards of be
havior." What is even more
frightening is that they are also
used to control racial minor
ities. the poor, and political rad
icals. We have heard for years
about men's prisons; we are
just beginning to find out about
the special problems of wom
en's prisons. Getting Out by
Marsha Norman is part of that
story.
Getting Out is the latest prod
uction by Theatre Julian in San
Francisco. It follows
Arlene Arlie during the first
few hours after she leaves jail
on parole. In parallel with the
preSent-day incidents involving
Arlene. scenes from her life in
prison and recollections from
her childhood are acted out.
Now that she has left prison,
Arlene wants to start a new life
and so has chosen a new name to
distance herself from her pre
vious experiences.
(letting Out is a bleak play.
Every scene is played from the
point of view of Arlene/Arlie,
and she has few pleasant memo
ries. In scene after scene we
hear about rape (by men and
women), murder, incest, abuse
by the guards in the prison, and
the attempts of a pimp to get her
to work again as a prostitute
(the crime which got her into
jail in the first place).
With few exceptions, the on
stage characters are dis
reputable. Not even Arlene's
mother has any respect for her.
Ruby i Arlene's neighbor) is the
only sympathetic and respect
able character. She used to be in
prison herself and now works as
a cook in a restaurant. She of
fers Arlene a job as a dish
washer. and also protects her
from the pimp. Ruby helps
Arlene recover from being in
prison â€” a difficult task since
Arlie's experiences have taught
her that kindness is almost
always a bribe for sex.
The overall bleakness of the
play bothered me throughout
the first act. 1 was beginning to

think that this was another
feminist play where all men are
rapists and all women the vic
tims of our "patriarchal socie
ty.'' At intermission, though, I
realized that all the characters
were being viewed from the
point of view of Arlene/Arlie. I
have certainly heard stories
similar to hers before, and her
attitudes are plausible in the
context of her situation.
In Act 11, we are shown how
Arlie begins to be transformed
into Arlene. and in addition how
Arlene begins to make friends
with Ruby. Even with these
small tranformations the play
remains very dark. In the last
minutes of the play, Arlie calls
to Arlene and they acknowledge
each other for the first time.
Arlene finally begins to accept
rather than to disown her child
hood and her prison life.
The play makes an important
political statement. The un
relenting dark mood of the play
and the constant reminders of
the hardships that Arlene has
gone through help us to under
stand Arlene's behavior and
also make us feel sorry for her.
No one should be treated in that

way. I do believe, though, that
stories like these make better
documentaries-
Marsha Norman has careful
ly supplied numerous stage
directions for her play. As a re
sult. directing the play is more
an organizational than a
creative task. Brenda Berlin
has done a good job of carrying
out Norman's instructions.
Leah Mark (as Arlie) gives an
excellent performance; she ex
presses very well the rage of
Arlie. which is sometimes
directed at those around her.
and sometimes directed at
herself. 1 was even more im
pressed by Abigail Booraem (as
Ruby). Even when she is not
speaking, her actions describe
many different emotions and at
titudes. In a play with so many
unchanging characters, her per
formance is refreshing.
Getting Out is going to make
a lot of people, especially wom
en. angry about our prison sys
tem. It shows very well how de
tention can destroy the emo
tional lives of inmates. Un
fortunately it relies on pity to
make us angry, and pity won't
sustain anger for very long.
