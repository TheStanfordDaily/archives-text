# Watts ties bow on perfect musical gift
## 
### Russell Hanford 
Pianist Andre Watts's recital
two Sundays ago in Davies Hall
proved to be a spectacular open
ing to the new chamber, dance,
and recital series presented by
San Francisco Performances,
Watts donated his performance
fee to the association. As it
turned out. however. Watts of
fered much more than his fee
Sunday night. Each member of
the audience received a wonder
ful gift of music from one who
indeed seems to fit the shoes of a
pianistic giant.
The program was unusual in
that it included not one standard
recital piece. Because of this di
versity, the program provided
the audience with a veritable
compendium of the piano liter
ature. Watts's classical offering
was a late Haydn Sonata, No. 48
in C major. His playing was
clear throughout the two move
ment work, and the phrasing,
particularly in the slow move
ment, was masterfully de
lineated For dynamic contrast.
Watts frequently employed the
echo effect, but its use never be
came predictable
After the Haydn. Watts per
formed Schubert's Sonata in A
major. Op. 120. The piece served
as a perfect transition from the
classical to the romantic por
tion of the program. No one

seems to know whether
Schubert was a classicalist or a
romanticist. From the sound of
it, however Watts places the
composer in the latter camp
This was illustrated best by
Watts's rendition of the final al
legro movement during which
we heard his feet stomping at
the climaxes and saw him near
ly conducting himself through
the waltz-like sections. None of
this occurred during the Haydn,
nor was it present to a great ex
tent during the first two move
ments of the Schubert. Never
theless. Watts played the Alle
gro moderate and the Andante
with great romantic warmth.
The Andante was particularly
beautiful, sounding at times as
if Watts had help from a string
quintet just offstage.
Continuing in the romantic
vein. Watts next performed
Brahms's Piano I'ie'ces. Op. 119.
Watts played this set of four
miniatures. Brahms's last piano
work, with great sentiment. His
total absorption in the music
was confirmed by the fact that a
loud pop resulting from one of
the spotlights burning out did
not break his concentration in
the least. The same cannot be
said for the audience, however.
The bang occurred toward the
end of the second to the last
piece of the set, the third In

termezzo. When Watts con
cluded the piece the audience
clapped despite the fact lie had
yet to play the final Rhapsody.
In all good humor. Watts raised
his hand and signaled with his
finger that there was still one
more piece to come. And indeed
there was. Watts' rendition of
the E flat major Rhapsody was
truly majestic. Again, he used
his whole body to produce the
desired effect, and while this
distracted some in the audience,
for others it contributed to mak
ing this final selection of the
first half of the program the
highpoint of the whole recital.
After intermission. Watts
moved on to works by Havel and
Debussy. He performed four
Ravel pieces, three of which are
rarely heard in recital. These in
cluded the Prelude and two
"homage" pieces — A la Man
iere de Chabrier and A la Man
iere de Horodine — from the
year 1913. The three sketches
are unpretentious in nature, and
luckily Watts did not try to
make them otherwise. The final
Ravel offering was the Toccata
from Tombeau de Couperin.
This provided a marvelous con
trast to the other Ravel pieces
for it is anything but unpreten
tious music. Watts utilized the
resources of the modern piano

to their fullest in this work per
haps at times even pushing the
piano toward its undefined lim
its Particularly, he might have
used less pedal near the end of
the work.
Watts played one late and one
early work ol Debussy. The
composer wrote La plus que
lente in 1910. eight years before
his death. This is mature De
bussy. and Watts showed equal
ly mature musicianship in
bringing the seductive nature of
the writing into close range of
the senses. Danse, from De
bussy's early period, is replete
wiln difficult cross-rhythms,
which Watts executed with his
usual alacrity. As would be ex
pected, we heard some toe-tap
ping in this one.
Watts strayed into the
modern era with Copland's
Passacaglia. His performance
ol the piece was convincing al
though the initial statement of
the ground bass seemed un
naturally slow.
After the Passacaglia. Watts
returned to the environment in
which he seems to function best.
Watts is a romantic at heart,
and it is difficult to imagine a
more effective performance of
Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody

No. 13 in A minor than the one
heard Sunday night This is per
haps the most musically valu
able of the Rhapsodies by Liszt,
but at times one cannot help but
feel that Liszt's major goal in
writing such a piece was to
create headaches for the pian
ist. However, Watts tran
scended the technical dif
ficulties of the Rhapsody and
turned his attention to the musi
cal substance of the piece. His
approach worked. The
Rhapsody as conceived by
Watts was not simply a melange
of thundering notes; it was a
congruous musical entity.
The Liszt concluded the
printed portion of the program,
but as encores Watts treated his
appreciative audience to two ex
cerpts from Debussy's Chil
dren's Corner suite: "Serenade
for the Doll" and "Golliwog's
Cakewalk." The pieces tied a
perfect bow on an evening that
added validity to the notion of
music as a universal language
capable of conveying profound
thoughts. The performance also
proved beyond a doubt that
Watts speaks the language
fluently.
