# Speaker covers election, media

Network television should "force
the issues more" and take away the
"horserace" element from its cov
erage of presidential campaigns in the
future. NBC senior executive pro
ducer Lester Crystal told an audience
in Kresge Auditorium last night.
Although Crystal maintained that
the polls which the press relied upon so
heavily in the past election were not
really wrong, he suggested that the
networks "should be more careful iii
the way we report them."
"1 would be happy if we dropped the
whole horserace business of trying to
say who was ahead and instead looked
at voter trends," Crystal said, adding
that one reason Ronald Reagan s land
slide victory was not accurately pre
dicted by the media was that they ig
nored the undecided voters.
"Foils don't predict — they only tell
you what would happen at that partic
ular point in time," the 17-year NBC
news veteran said. Crystal is con
sidered one of the nation's top news
executives.
Calling television the only "national
medium" whereby candidates "can
get all across the country in one shot,"
Crystal said the-three networks spent
in excess of $120 million to cover this
year's campiagn. The three major
candidates, meanwhile, spent more
than $40 million in TV advertising.
Changed process
"The dynamic interrelation of tech
nological advances in TV and a chang

ing country has led to a changed politi
cal process." Crystal said, pointing to
what he called the networks' dilemma
of covering "much too long a political
year."
Small states are given too much im
portance and voter attention is
stretched in the long season ot prima
ries. However, "it candidates are
there you assume they believe it's im
portant . . competitively you don't
just turn off the water and say you're
going to ignore it." said Crystal, who
has had overall responsibility for
NBC's coverage of the presidential
primaries, nominating conventions
and election day.
In response to an audience question
about the advisability of early predic
tions of the election outcome. Crystal
recommended that the country should
adopt "time zone primaries." held by
time zone over a period no longer than
three or four months. As another sug
gestion for easing a time-related prob
lem. Crystal suggested that the coun
try should adopt a uniform poll closing
time.
No policy
Crystal said he was not convinced
that network predictions had any ef
fect on the outcome or on voter turn
out on the West Coast and that the
networks had had no policy dis
cussions on the advisability of these
predictions.
"I think President Jimmy Carter's
speech (conceding the election I may
have had an effect on voter turnout."
Crystal said earlier.
He also defended NBC's use of "exit

polls" — questioning persons as they
leave the polling place — by saying
that this data along with raw vote and
other information is all compiled
before the station makes any sort of
prediction. Plus. Crystal said, "unless
a candidate is ahead by at least six
points with an error margin of three
points, we won't predict."
"I would welcome uniform poll
closing, but it's difficult to have a
broadcast and pretend for three hours
that we don't know what we know,"he
said.
Crystal also defended NBC's per
formance at this year's Republican
presidential campaign. An audience
member questioned whether "respon
sible journalism went out the win
dow" in the flurry over whether
former President (Jerald Ford would
become Ronald Reagan's running
mate.
"It didn't," Crystal quickly re
sponded. "We didn't go nearly as far
as our competition and we ended up
being right. Certainly it was an effort
to be first, but it was more com
plicated than that. The situation on the
convention floor got out of hand. It was
a mixture of people who thought they
knew, coupled with those who wanted
it to happen."
Crystal is a graduate of North
western University in Illinois with a
master's in journalism. In 1963 he
joined NBC in Chicago and later be
came Midwest producer of the Hunt
ley-Brinkley Report. He is married
and has three children, two of whom,
Brad and Alan, are students here.
