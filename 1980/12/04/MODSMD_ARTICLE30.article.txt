# 'Trojan War' left at the gate

### Steve Vineberg 
Jean Giraudoux's The Trojan
War Will Not Take Place is set
in a Troy of glittering intellec
tuals who weigh the relative val
ues of war and peace with cool
detachment The English trans
lation (by Christopher Fry) is
usually called Tiger at the
dates, which has two-fold sig
nificance: symbolically, the
tiger is Fate, making ready to
rouse an overconfident people
out of their naive delusion that
life can continue in the neatly
ordered fashion to which they
are accustomed; literally, the
tiger is the Greek army, ap
proaching Troy in order to de
clare war on the city whose
prince, Paris, has stolen Helen,
wife of the Greek king
Menelaus.

The Trojan War is the sort of
play in which maddeningly liter
ate people get off terribly adroit
epigrams about destiny and sex
and war It is very tame, civ
ilized theater — it might have
been written by a blunter-edged
Shaw with a quietly smiling
countenance — but there are
certainly approaches to it that
might resurrect the cerebral
spark Parisians saw in it in 1935,
when it was first produced. One
would be to set it in the period in
which it was written — France
on the verge of the occupation -
since an awareness of the politi
cal conditions that prompted
(iiraudoux to write it would il
luminate his intention. The cur
rent production at the A.C.T.,
under Jack O'Brien's direction,
is contemporary. The climate of

the play, O Brien writes in his
nearly incomprehensible pro
gram notes, "is not so very dif
ferent from what is going on
now, here in our own country.
We look terrific, we talk a ter
rific game, we are terrific. We
are into good lives, simple but
expensive lifestyles. . We're
having a wonderful time — and
down the road is Fidel Castro."
O'Brien does not mean, pre
sumably, that Cuba is the tiger
at our gates < who knows what
that allusion means?), but then,
who is? He refers to the needs
that America, he thinks, is ig
noring in other nations —
"Somebody else is hungry.
Somebody else needs oil . . —
but the appearance of the
(ireeks in Act Two, represented
on stage by the drunken lecher
Ajax and the brilliant diplomat
Ulysses — a character who cer
tainly matches the Trojans in
style and politesse — does not
suggest a people with so much
primal passion and such strong,
basic cause for war that the Tro
jans seem fatuous. Giraudoux
leads us to believe that the
(ireeks are more aggressive
and will win the war if it is
begun, but not because they are
starving; in the play, the con
flict is provoked by war
mongers.
This mistaken contemporary
interpretation of The Trojan
War has unfortunate conse
quences in the costuming of the
show. Robert Fletcher's de
signs attempt to locate a middle
ground between classical and
modern, and the results are so
disastrous that they nearly sab
otage the actors. Paris wears
running shorts with a codpiece;
Priam looks like a rabbi in a
prayer shawl; Cassandra is first
seen taking the sun in a two
piece bathing suit; a messenger
seems suited for a football
match. And whatever qualities
in the actors the costumes do
not render ridiculous, O'Brien's
staging makes limp and
purposeless. The play is over
flowing with characters, and
O'Brien chooses to have most of
them posed uncomfortably,
with nothing to do. The set is a
series of marble pillars and

steps that shares a certain ste
rility with Seger's work in
A.C.T.'s Much Ado About
Nothing, and O'Brien seems to
have been hypnotized by it: he
drapes his actors upon it rather
than employing it as a spring
board for any sort of meaningful
movement.
Physically, the direction con
sists of a general call to arms
every five minutes or so: pre
sumably motivated by a desire
to juice up all that talk, O'Brien
has the cast regroup in new
i equally arbitrary > positions, or
move pillows from one tier to
the next, or — in the case of
Marrian Walters, who plays
Hecuba — stroll halfway across
the stage in order to deliver
each of her one-liners. All the
big speeches, too, are de
claimed to the audience: the
play stops dutifully when
Cassandra tOeann Mears) ex
plains about the tiger at the
gates or Hector (Byron Jen
nings. who looks from some an
gles like iMichael Redgrave,
who played the role on Broad
way) describes his new re
vulsion at war. By the end of the
plav, when blood is spilled and
war commences, we are so far
away from whatever reality
(iiraudoux intended that the
carefully arranged chaos seems
like just another dumb direc
torial strategy.
The cast provides an in
telligent. restrained reading of
the text, but only a couple of per
formers — Barbara Dirickson
as Andromache and Michael
Winters as Ulysses — con
sistently command attention
through the strength of their
characterizations, and only one
— Mark Harelik as Paris — has
a really dynamic presence.
Swathed in the most camp of
Fletchers abominations,
Harelik seems to be playing
Paris as a gay stud, which con
tradicts everything the play
tells us about him, but his tim
ing is first-rate and he, at least,
seems at home on that massive
set. Harelik may not be a good
enough reason to see The Tro
jan War Will Not Take Place,
but he does provide a pleasant
distraction.
