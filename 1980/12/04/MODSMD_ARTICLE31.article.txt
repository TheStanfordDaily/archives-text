# Robert Wise explains the 'gene' for moviemaking
## 
### 
The following is an interview conducted
with producer director Robert Wise by Daily
reporter Curtis Scott.
"The highest compliment you can pay to a
director is to completely lose consciousness
while seeing his film."
This observation comes not from a sleep
therapist but from the distinguished producer
and director, Robert Wise. Over the past 36
years. Wise has made films ranging in subject
from The Curse Of The Cat People (1944) to
Helen Of Troy (1955) to West Side Story
(1%1) and The Sound Of Music (1965). He un
nerved audiences with his science fiction
thriller. The Andromeda Strain (1971), and
looked once again to the future with this
year's Star Trek.
Wise's office on the Paramount Studio's lot
is identified by block letters on a simple sign
Upon entering. 1 find it almost as warm as the
85 degrees outside. The rather modest room is
neat and uncluttered. A graceful gentleman
steps forward to shake my hand. He has a
shocjt of white hair and warm, intelligent blue
eyes.
1 begin by asking him what he means that
audiences should "lose consciousness' during
a good film. He tells an anecdote about Mrs.
Arthur Mayer "waking up" from West Side
Story: "She told me that during the film she
felt as if she had left the theater for another
world — having lost consciousness of this

world altogether I look for stories that will
transport the audience in such a way. A good
story line grips its viewers immediately and
completely absorbs them as it develops."
"The correct casting of the writer is
critical." he observes. "It is common for
more than one writer to work on a given film;
but when you see split writing credits for a
movie, it rarely means the writers worked as
a team — one writer may have written the
treatment, another the first draft, and soon I
usually hit it right, but on occasion the writer I
think perfect for a project proves unsatisfac
tory The nature of the beast, unfortunately, is
that the director must replace a writer who
doesn't meet expectations."
Another pause for reflection. The graceful
gentleman is not without complexity. His soft
and easy voice contrasts with the quick flow of
perceptions it expresses; the easy command
is offset by fingers frequently snapping for
punctuation. Beneath the exterior detach
ment. one senses an underlying wealth of feel
ing.
The conversation turns to other talents a di
rector must have Wise states, "the director
is a unique kind of storyteller. Directing is
much more difficult than. say. writing a nov
el. it involves more variables — working with
people, meeting budgets and deadlines, fitting
together the many pieces of a difficult
puzzle " He continues with a smile. "Nov

elists have it made. They can take characters
out whenever they want; they can add new
ones, change locations at will, and explain
their way out of tough situations with narra
tion The director depends much more heavily
on the talents of others. All the director can do
is explain or deomonstrate his conceptions
and then pray that the actors will give him
what he needs. There is often frustration in
this process A good director reduces it by rec
ognizing that all actors — even the best —
need encouragement, guidance, love."

"Directing is much more difficult than, say, writing a novel; it
involves . . . fitting together the many pieces of a difficult
puzzle.'

Through his interactions with actors and ac
tresses. Wise has come to believe that the best
of them are distinguished by what he calls "a
special gene. " He encourages actors to study
and work at their craft, but he believes no
amount of training can substitute for the gene.
As an example, he cites Jeff Chandler in the
movie. Two Flags West (1950);
"We were filming on a dusty set in Texas.
Jeff said to me he could watch one of the other
actors practice out by the corral for hours on
end because the latter was such a master tech

nician Yet when the movie came out, it was
Chandler and not the more practiced veteran
who captivated the audience. It's difficult to
explain this except by what I call a special
gene, (iarv Cooper is another actor who had it.
In Bogart. the gene did not express itself im
mediately but emerged through steady
work "
Is there a gene for directing?
"Outstanding directors also have some in
nate talent, but the gene' is not as crucial to

them as it is to the actor."
I ask Wise how a director can make a film
come together as a coherent story when so
many people are involved in making it.
"With a good director, the various pieces
tall into place. The director creates a sup
portive atmosphere in which people are work
ing smoothly as a team Of course disagree
ment and exchange of opinion are necessary
and useful in the early stages of making a
film. Once filming's under way, though, l'jn

not one of those directors who values conflict
and disorder; by that stage I want relative
harmony and a sense of family on the set. "
What quality stamps a Robert Wise film
with his signature?
"That s a harder question for me to answer
than for an objective observer. We're talking
about an intangible quality again. The biggest
factor is probably my attention to detail at
each stage of production — to the correctness,
authenticity, and integrity of the unfolding
story, Also, the choices 1 make with regard to
casting put my stamp on a film."
1 note that there is an energetic optimism
and humanism in his films (eg. Star Trek ends
with the words — "the human adventure is
just beginning." > How would Wise explain the
evolution of this positive outlook'.'
"1 believe this attitude is evident in my
earliest work. It has to do with my interest in
human beings and in the human condition I
have tried to express it in other areas of my
life too, as with my support of the American
Civil Liberties Union. Integrity and honesty
are important elements in my outlook — I
don't 8.5."
How did he come to have this outlook?
He looks down for a moment, scratches un
der his arm, then looks up again with those in
tense blue eyes: "Perhaps I have a gene for
it."
