yesterday declared Iran the victor in its war with Iraq and
announced a second batle phase that he said will result in
the expulsion of Iraqi forces from its territory

tional level, is such that we can affirm with certainty that
Iran has defeated Iraqi aggression.' Bani-Sadr said in a
press conference.
Bani-Sadr. who is also Iran's armed forces commander,
said the Iraqi attacks were intended to 'destroy the Islam
ic Republic and dismantle the country," and he admitted
that they took his country by surprise
"Our forces were not initially prepared for the confron
tation.' he said. "But we progressively came to halt this
aggression."

Israel attacks Palestinian positions
Damour, Lebanon — Israeli commandos, backed by
rocket-firing gunboats and helicopters that lit the way
with flares, stormed ashore here yesterday in a predawn
attack on Palestinian guerrilla positions. There were re
ports of at least six deaths.
Guerrillas said the Israelis left behind "a lot of blood"
indicating casualties among the raiders.
Israel's military command in Tel Aviv claimed an un-

specified number of guerrillas were killed in the "com
plicated and sophisticated nighttime attack on the Medi
terranean coast 12 miles south of Beirut. But it said all Is
raeli troops returned safely after ambushing two vehicles
carrying Palestinians.
A tape-recording of the battle broadcast by Israeli army
radio indicated the invaders also blew up a house with a
heavy weapon after being fired on by guerrillas.
The Palestine Liberation Organization headed by
Yasser Arafat said two guerrillas were killed in two hours
of battle that started about 2:30 a.m. The PLO said four
Lebanese civilians died when their car was raked by gun
fire.
Palestinian guerrillas said the Israelis attacked along a
tive-mile stretch of coastal highway in this banana-grow
ing region 45 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon border.
Israel's command said the raid was "preventive ac
tion" designed to curb the PLO's ability to strike at targets
in Israel.
It said the raid surprised the Palestinians, but guerrillas
here claimed their coastal artillery sentries spotted the
boats and helicopters and engaged the troops in battle as
they came ashore.
Syria, Jordan border tensions mount
Damascus, Syria — A Saudi Arabian mediator shuttled
between Amman and Damascus yesterday to try to head
off a Syrian-Jordan war Jordan's information minister
denied that King Hussein had accepted Syrian conditions
for ending the border crisis.
Prince Abdullah Bin Abdul-Aziz, a deputy premier of the
oil-rich nation that finances arms purchases by both Syria
and Jordan, arrived from Amman for talks with President
Hafez Assad after meeting Hussein in the Jordanian capi
tal.
As Abdullah met with Assad, Syrian officials warned
that war between the two Arab states would be inevitable
if Jordan failed to meet Syria's terms for ending the crisis.
Syria, charging that Jordan was backing a fundamen
talist Islamic group trying to overthrow Assad and was
changing its stance toward the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization. moved 50,000 troops and 1200 tanks to the
border with Jordan. Hussein responded by rushing 30,000
Jordanian troops to the tense frontier.
The crisis appeared to ease when Jordanian officials
said Tuesday that Jordan had agreed to Syria's demands
for a written statement that Jordan was not aiding ter
rorists of the Moslem Brotherhood and that Jordan recog
nized the PLO as the sole representative of Palestinians.
Pt. Reyes slayer still evades police
Point Reyes Station — Despite hundreds of telephone
calls from across the nation, Marin County authorities
said yesterday they are no closer to finding a man wanted
in the slayings of seven hikers.
"We have no new reports," Sheriff Al Howenstein said.
"We're just carefully working out the hundreds and hun
dreds of leads that are coming in."
Howenstein said he expects the flood of calls to continue
because of the $25,000 reward Marin supervisors are offer
ing for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
the killer.

Four people — a young couple and two, unrelated women
— were discovered about 20 miles away Friday near a trail
at Point Reyes National Seashore, a scenic bird sanctuary.

gambling casinos or expansion of existing casinos, until a
regional plan is developed.
