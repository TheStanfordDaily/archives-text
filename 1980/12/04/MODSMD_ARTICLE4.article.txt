Can murder ever be right?
Professor G.E.M. Anscombe of Cambridge University delivered her
first in the series of four Immanuel Kant lectures sponsored by the
Philosophy Department at Kresge Auditorium Tuesday. Anscombe,
known for her work on intention and causality as well as for her trans
lations of Wittgenstein, asked the question "Is murder ever justifiable?"
The answer to the question does not lie in the mere definition of the word,
she said. Anscombe will provide her answer in the next talk today in Jor
dan Hall, Room 40, 4 p.m.
