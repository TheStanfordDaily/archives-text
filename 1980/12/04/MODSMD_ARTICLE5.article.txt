# Task force on entertainment
## Senators hear report 
### Peter Finch 
The ASSU Task Force on Contem
porary Entertainment spoke before a
gathering of ASSU Senate committees
last night, outlining its plans for the
re-establishment of a Special Events
type organization here.
The Task Force has drawn up sever
al recommedations for a new ASSU
entertainment system, based on its re
search since early this fall when the
now-defunct ASSU Special Events
program was ended. After presenting
their opinions to the senators last
night, the Task Force members will
make a final draft of their official re
commendation and submit it to the
general ASSU Senate meeting next
Wednesday.
Primarily, the Task Force is propo
sing that the ASSU establish two new
contemporary entertainment
projects, one for concert promotion
and the other to provide "alternative
entertainment services." including a
consulting service to help students
produce small concerts and shows on
their own.
The Task Force has also created a
set of extensive guidelines for each
project, which the senate requested
when the Task Force began its re
search.
One of the recommendations of the
Task Force was to form an initial com
mittee that could oversee the creation
of the new projects within these
guidelines. Then, by the end of winter

quarter, the senate will be able to de
termine if the Task Force's plans are
practical.
"We firmly believe that if these
guidelines can be fulfilled to the satis
faction of the ASSU during the winter
quarter of 1981." said Council of Presi
dents and Task Force member Dick
Butterfield. "we will be able to begin
operation of the new projects as soon
as spring."
To come up with its ultimate recom
mendation, the Task Force began ex
amining the ways in which a contem
porary entertainment project could
realistically be reinstated here, ac
cording to Butterfield.
"First we did the survey," But
terfield said. " The results are that
students love to see things in front of
Tresidder, they love the Flicks, they
want to see concerts in Frost. Six hun
dred people werp surveyed, and we
teel that's a pretty good estimate of
where this campus is at."
Then the Task Force took an in
depth look at the history of the old Spe
cial Events program, according to
Task Force member Marna Broida.
And, she said, they found many
aspects that could be improved.
"They should have offered student
discounts on tickets, for one." she
said "And they should have surveyed
students' opinions more frequently."
Another big problem for Special
Events, Broida said, was a lack of con
tinuity. This was largely due to the
program's yearly change in man
agement.
Broida also cited many of Special
Events' structural problems, includ
ing the director's pay scale, the
manner in which financial decisions
were made, under-budgeting of con
certs, over-bidding for performers,
poor bookkeeping and the overall lack
of contracting expertise.
Task Force member Vinnie Freda
pointed to conflicts between Special
Events and other University organiza
tions, such as the Tresidder ticket of
fice and Public Events, as a cause of
serious difficulties.
"The failure or success of a Special
Events program will be directly re
lated to its ability to relate with the
University," he claimed.
The Task Force also emphasized
that the ASSU should not just promote
concerts, but should also consider pro
viding an educational service for stu
dents, according to Task Force mem
ber Alec Peters.

and an ASSU band-booking group, both
