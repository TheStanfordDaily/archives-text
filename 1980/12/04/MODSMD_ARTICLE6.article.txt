Thorny problems in the Middle Kast
may stay unresolved for a long time.
In a symposium held yesterday, five
Middle East experts gathered to
dicuss those problems and disagreed
on everything from what should be
called a problem to what should be
called the Middle Kast.
"Middle Kast was a concept given
by Kuropeans for Kuropeans," said
Michel Nabti. a Middle Kast scholar
at Stanford In questioning the termi
nology of his co-panelists. Nabti said
the West's perceptions of instability in
the region are no more than per
ceptions.
"The Arab world is not monolithic
but if you look qarefullv at the region
you see that people there see the same
destiny for themselves." he said.
Arabs were united in their support
for the Iranian revolution, he said, but
recently split over what some saw as
Iranian extremism.
Nabti's assertions came in response
to other panelists who emphasized re
ligious and political divisions in the
area.
Karl Raab. a columnist for the San
Francisco Jewish Bulletin, questioned
the ability of Middle Kast nations to
solve their own problems. Raab
likened the Middle Kast to a "mixture
of unstable chemicals stirred by out
side forces."
Other speakers also saw instability
as a major obstacle John Amos of the
Naval Post-Graduate School in Mon
terey. emphasized problems created
byeultural and religious divisions be
tween Shiite and Sunni Moslems. The
two major Islamic sects create a re
gional "conflict system." he said.
The revival of political Islam in the
Middle Kast threatens governments
inside and outside the region, Amos
said. Iraq feels threatened by Iranian
attempts to mobilize the sizeable
Shiite minority within Iraqi borders.
