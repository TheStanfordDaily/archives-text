Thorny problems in the Middle Kast
may stay unresolved for a long time.
In a symposium held yesterday, five
Middle East experts gathered to
dicuss those problems and disagreed
on everything from what should be
called a problem to what should be
called the Middle Kast.
"Middle Kast was a concept given
by Kuropeans for Kuropeans," said
Michel Nabti. a Middle Kast scholar
at Stanford In questioning the termi
nology of his co-panelists. Nabti said
the West's perceptions of instability in
the region are no more than per
ceptions.
"The Arab world is not monolithic
but if you look qarefullv at the region
you see that people there see the same
destiny for themselves." he said.
Arabs were united in their support
for the Iranian revolution, he said, but
recently split over what some saw as
Iranian extremism.
Nabti's assertions came in response
to other panelists who emphasized re
ligious and political divisions in the
area.
Karl Raab. a columnist for the San
Francisco Jewish Bulletin, questioned
the ability of Middle Kast nations to
solve their own problems. Raab
likened the Middle Kast to a "mixture
of unstable chemicals stirred by out
side forces."
Other speakers also saw instability
as a major obstacle John Amos of the
Naval Post-Graduate School in Mon
terey. emphasized problems created
byeultural and religious divisions be
tween Shiite and Sunni Moslems. The
two major Islamic sects create a re
gional "conflict system." he said.
The revival of political Islam in the
Middle Kast threatens governments
inside and outside the region, Amos
said. Iraq feels threatened by Iranian
attempts to mobilize the sizeable
Shiite minority within Iraqi borders.
Syria feels equally threatened by a
Sunni extremist sect — the Muslim
Brotherhood — which is supported by
.Jordan, he said
All speakers agreed on one current
trend in the Middle East: the steady
deterioration of U.S.-Arab relations.
Nicholas Thacher. former U.S. am
bassador to Saudi Arabia, explained

why the Saudis' special ties to the U.S.
are cooling.
While the U.S. seeks to establish
military bases on Saudi soil, the
Saudis do not see how this could be in
their national interest, he said. Close
association to the U.S. has not been
beneficial to Middle East govern
ments in the past. Thacher cited Iran
as an example.

Saudi Arabia's enormous oil wealth
— it controls about one third of the
world's known oil reserves — has
made the nation an important force in
the region, he said. Generally, the
Saudis have been moderate and have
increased oil production during crises.
Thacher said.
U.S.-Arab relations are an interna
t lonal irony. Steven Garret of the Mon
terey Institute of International Stud
ies said.
"The current strategy of reliance on
i President Anwar) Sadat of Egypt is
dangerous. Sadat has been isolated —
which is not in his, nor in the Ameri
can. interest.
The only reasonable strategy for
U.S. foreign policy is "damage limita
tion." he said.
A solution to the Arab-Israel ques
tion is not the only issue. Garret said,
adding that cynics often say, "If Israel
had not existed the Arab states would
have to invent her.''
The panel was moderated by Thom
as Henriksen of the Hoover Institu
tion. The symposium was part of a
continuing series called "A World in
Crisis: The United States Faces the
'80s."
