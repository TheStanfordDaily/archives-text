# Europe awaits Reagan's new trade policy
## U.S. embargo has limited impact 
### Los Angeles Times 
Brussels, Belgium — West
European governments are
waiting eagerly to see what
position the new Reagan admin
istration takes on the thorny is
sue of trade relations with the
Soviet Union.
During the long election cam
paign, President-elect Ronald
Reagan said that he opposed the
limits on grain exports to the So
viet Union that President Jim
my Carter imposed as part of
his response to Moscow's in
vasion of Afghanistan.
That partial embargo has re
ceived a lot of public attention in
Europe since Carter announced
his amended trade policy
toward Moscow after the in
vasion nearly a year ago.
Europeans professed solidar
ity with Carter on the trade
sanctions even though they gen
erally oppose using trade as a
political weapon. Their econo
mies depend much more heavily
on foreign business than does
the U.S. economy, and the ties
between Eastern and Western
Europe have grown substantial
ly in the last decade.
On the other hand, the Eu
ropeans had no effective alter
native policy to show their dis
pleasure at the Moscow
takeover in Afghanistan.
Suggested acquiesence
U.S. farm groups and com
panies that have been suc
cessful in trading with Moscow

also opposed the embargoes.
For Reagan, changing the
Carter policy will be chancy be
cause it could suggest Washing
ton's acquiesence to the Afghan
istan incursion.
Moscow spokesmen and press
organs have insisted that Wash
ington's policy has failed. In
particular, they have asserted
that there are many other
sources in the world from which
to buy items that the United
States will not sell
The partial grain embargo
would be the first target for re
moval because the Soviet Union
faces a bleak winter of food
shortages itself, and its trading
partners in Fastern Europe also
must share any of their sur
pluses with Poland, which faces
food rationing
A quick change of policy by
the new president could start in
creased shipments of grain and
other food items within a rela
tively short time.
Technology limits
On another front, the Carter
administration has attempted
to limit sales to Moscow of
equipment and technology that
could be used for military
purposes — especially to
enhance the Soviet Union's
strategic position in relation to
the United States and its allies
in the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization.
Two deals that upset Wash
ington included a $100 million

aluminum plant contract and a
$320 million steel plant. Germa
ny's Kloeckner group took over
an aluminum project planned
for Siberia, which the
Aluminum Co. of America was
working on. and Creusot-Loire
of France got a steel contract
that Armco of the United States
had been angling for.
in both cases the Europeans
said that their contracts were
changed from the original spe
cifications so that no high-grade
technology or specific Ameri
can input would be exported.
Washington apparently dis
agreed. While accepting the ex
planation for the German con
tract. the administration two
weeks ago banned further im
ports of special steel products
made by the French company.
Limited export levels
To make its action effective,
the Carter administration asked
other grain-exporting countries
to hold their sales to Moscow to
traditional levels, and not to re
place what the United States
would have sold. The grain ex
porters agreed except for Ar
gentina.
Many experts predicted that
the grain embargo would fail be
cause it would be easy for a big
customer with money to buy
grain in open trading around the
world. Sales to blacklisted cus
tomers like Moscow can be dis
guised in many ways, using bro
kers based in places like Switz

erland and transit ports like
Antwerp and Hamburg.
The grain, embargo is weak
ening. with Canada last week
formally dropping its 10-month
old sanction to make up what it
considers lost markets in China
taken by a new U.S. deal there.
Canada also charged that Aus
tralia increased its sales to the
Soviet Union at Ottawa's ex
pense.
