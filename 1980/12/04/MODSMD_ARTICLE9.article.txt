# Fraud in Japan's medical system spurs investigation
## 
### 
Tokyo (AP) — A series of medical scandals in
volving phony doctors, unneeded surgery and the
illegal sale of an experimental cancer drug has
pushed Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry into
a full-scale review of the country's much
criticized medical system.
The government says it is making a special ef
fort to root out dishonest doctors and hospitals.
The spurt of official activity was prompted
mainly by accusations that the operator of the Fu
jirrn Maternity Clinic near Tokyo was not
licensed, but had been diagnosing patients for at
least seven years. He allegedly authorized more
than 200 operations on healthy women — remov
ing ovaries and other organs simply to collect
medical insurance payments.
A doctor who owns a hospital near Osaka is ac
cused of selling interferon, a cancer drug classi
fied as experimental, for up to $35,000 per patient.
Several similar but lesser scandals, and a re
port by the national tax office that hospitals and
clinics topped the list of tax evaders last year,
have led to a series of hearings on medical prac
tice in each Japanese state.
Hired investigators
Offices and a toll-free telephone number have
been set up to handle complaints, and officials
have hired medical investigators and proposed a
national medical investigation squad — all ac
tions that some doctors say are long overdue.
"(Unnecessary operations at) Fujimi Hospital
are nothing. That's just one. There's plenty
more," said Dr. Hideo Makuda, a former World
Health Organization doctor who now runs a clinic
at Kamakura.
"Similar things happen in many Japanese hos
pitals — unqualified people doing examinations,
unnecessary operations for income," he said.
"But it's important not to blame only the doctor.
The entire Japanese medical system is wrong."
Japan has few big public hospitals and
thousands of tiny "clinics" — miniature hospitals
of two to 20 beds staffed by the owner-doctor and
perhaps a couple of nurses.
Capital outlays
"" For prestige and to get income, they buy many
big instruments — X-ray machines, etc. Then
they must get back the money by doing unneces
sary examinations and operations," Makuda said.
In addition, most medical expenses are paid
through national or company health insurance ac
cording to a complicated fee schedule set up by
the government. Many doctors say the schedule is
badly outdated and is structured to encourage
complicated tests.
"A doctor here gets almost nothing if he tells a

patient You're OK.' If he's going to make his
clinic run.he has to find something wrong," said
the doctor, who asked not to be identified.
A third majoi fault in the system, according to
many doctors, is the lack of a prescription setup.
Instead of writing prescriptions which patients
take to a pharmacy, doctors buy medicine from
pharmaceutical companies and sell it directly to
their patients. This, critics say, leads to over
prescription, as well as questionable tactics by
the companies.
Lack of regulations
"There's a lot going on between the pharma
ceutical companies and the government,'' the for
eign doctor claimed, saying he was referring to
reports of lavish wining and dining and free golf
trips for bureaucrats from the companies. "There
are no rules or regulations to stop them from
doing this."
Another problem involves specialties. There is
only one post-graduate qualification — a kind of a
I'h.D. Therefore, a doctor could study one special
ty and theoretically set himself up in another,
surgery for instance. And a doctor here may fol
low medical fads, switching his specialty to some
thing more popular or rewarding without addi
tional study.
Despite the new government campaign,
Makuda is pessimistic that any basic problems
will be solved quickly. For one thing, he noted,
doctors and medical companies are among the
largest contributors to candidates of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, making politicians re
luctant to push changes in laws and regulations.
Former Health and Welfare Minister Kunikichi
Saito was forced to resign last month when it was
discovered he had received $46,000 in political
donations from the owner of the Fujimi Maternity
Clinic.
The foreign doctor is more optimistic.
He said the standard of education is getting bet
ter — the once-rampant bribery by parents to get
their children into over-crowded private medical
schools is being thwarted by a recently toughened
final qualifying examination.
And the doctor cited generally improving
health statistics when saying that on the average
Japanese medical care is adequate.
"Hygiene is better, facilities are better than 10
years ago. The medical system is not as good as
Britain or the United States, but it's getting bet
ter." he said.
"Look at the Japanese life span (longest in the
world at 72.7 years for men and 78 for women).
Whatever the system, it's working."

Former Health and Welfare Minister Kunikichi
Saito was forced to resign last month when it was
discovered he had received $46,000 in political
donations from the owner of the Fujimi Maternity
Clinic.
The foreign doctor is more optimistic.
He said the standard of education is getting bet
ter — the once-rampant bribery by parents to get
their children into over-crowded private medical
schools is being thwarted by a recently toughened
final qualifying examination.
And the doctor cited generally improving
health statistics when saying that on the average
Japanese medical care is adequate.
"Hygiene is better, facilities are better than 10
years ago. The medical system is not as good as
Britain or the United States, but it's getting bet

"Look at the Japanese life span (longest in the
world at 72.7 years for men and 78 for women).
Whatever the system, it's working."
Tokyo (AP) — A series of medical scandals in
volving phony doctors, unneeded surgery and the
illegal sale of an experimental cancer drug has
pushed Japan's Health and Welfare Ministry into
a full-scale review of the country's much
criticized medical system.
The government says it is making a special ef
fort to root out dishonest doctors and hospitals.
The spurt of official activity was prompted
mainly by accusations that the operator of the Fu
jirrn Maternity Clinic near Tokyo was not
licensed, but had been diagnosing patients for at
least seven years. He allegedly authorized more
than 200 operations on healthy women — remov
ing ovaries and other organs simply to collect
medical insurance payments.
A doctor who owns a hospital near Osaka is ac
cused of selling interferon, a cancer drug classi
fied as experimental, for up to $35,000 per patient.
Several similar but lesser scandals, and a re
port by the national tax office that hospitals and
clinics topped the list of tax evaders last year,
have led to a series of hearings on medical prac
tice in each Japanese state.
Hired investigators
Offices and a toll-free telephone number have
been set up to handle complaints, and officials
have hired medical investigators and proposed a
national medical investigation squad — all ac
tions that some doctors say are long overdue.
"(Unnecessary operations at) Fujimi Hospital
are nothing. That's just one. There's plenty
more," said Dr. Hideo Makuda, a former World
Health Organization doctor who now runs a clinic
at Kamakura.
"Similar things happen in many Japanese hos
pitals — unqualified people doing examinations,
unnecessary operations for income," he said.
"But it's important not to blame only the doctor.
The entire Japanese medical system is wrong."
Japan has few big public hospitals and
thousands of tiny "clinics" — miniature hospitals
of two to 20 beds staffed by the owner-doctor and
perhaps a couple of nurses.
Capital outlays
"" For prestige and to get income, they buy many
big instruments — X-ray machines, etc. Then
they must get back the money by doing unneces
sary examinations and operations," Makuda said.
In addition, most medical expenses are paid
through national or company health insurance ac
cording to a complicated fee schedule set up by
the government. Many doctors say the schedule is
badly outdated and is structured to encourage
complicated tests.
"A doctor here gets almost nothing if he tells a

patient You're OK.' If he's going to make his
clinic run.he has to find something wrong," said
the doctor, who asked not to be identified.
A third majoi fault in the system, according to
many doctors, is the lack of a prescription setup.
Instead of writing prescriptions which patients
take to a pharmacy, doctors buy medicine from
pharmaceutical companies and sell it directly to
their patients. This, critics say, leads to over
prescription, as well as questionable tactics by
the companies.
Lack of regulations
"There's a lot going on between the pharma
ceutical companies and the government,'' the for
eign doctor claimed, saying he was referring to
reports of lavish wining and dining and free golf
trips for bureaucrats from the companies. "There
are no rules or regulations to stop them from
doing this."
Another problem involves specialties. There is
only one post-graduate qualification — a kind of a
I'h.D. Therefore, a doctor could study one special
ty and theoretically set himself up in another,
surgery for instance. And a doctor here may fol
low medical fads, switching his specialty to some
thing more popular or rewarding without addi
tional study.
Despite the new government campaign,
Makuda is pessimistic that any basic problems
will be solved quickly. For one thing, he noted,
doctors and medical companies are among the
largest contributors to candidates of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, making politicians re
luctant to push changes in laws and regulations.
