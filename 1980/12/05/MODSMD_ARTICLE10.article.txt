# Soviet-style communism creates problems
## Laotian government attempts collective economy 
### 
By The Washington Post
Vientiane, Laos — Troubled by eco
nomic stagnation and a seemingly end
less outflow of refugees, the five-year
old communist government of Laos has
slowed its efforts to organize the 3.4 mil
lion people into a Soviet-style collective
society.
Farmers at villages like Though Kang.
just outside Vientiane, have largely
abandoned communal tilling to work the
fields as privately held plots. In the city,
free-market trading in fresh food and
consumer goods is thriving under relax
ed government controls.
"They're stepping back to leap for
ward," a Western resident here said.
The current aproach does appear tem
porary. Portraits of Marx and Lenin in
government offices and continuing
"seminars" to introduce political theory
to ordinary Laotians leave little doubt
that long-term objectives remain the
same.
Premier Kaysone Phomvihan made
the new policy official last December
with a lengthy speech outlining the ruling
party's "Seventh Resolution." Fear that
reconstruction after a quarter century of
war was faltering appears to have
prompted the changes.
Dependent on aid
Laos remains as dependent on foreign
aid as it had been under the U.S.-sup
ported government. About $94 million in
outside capital was injected into the

economy last year, mostly in project aid
from Eastern Europe and the United Na
tions.
War damage and lack of motivation
and technicians — thousands have fled
across the Mekong River to Thailand —
were causing shortages and staggering
deficits in foreign trade. Only half of the
80 sawmills operating in 1974 were still
functioning in a country where timber
and tin are the largest exports.
Drought followed by floods damaged
crops and forced the import of 250.000
tons oMood in 1977 and 1978. Moreover,
many farmers were abandoning their
fields and crossing to Thailand in re
sponse to forced collectivization.
Conceding that some cadre had "vio
lated stale laws and abused their power
by intimidating the people," Kaysone de
clared in his radio broadcast a year ago
this week that things would change.
Creation of new collectives, already
slowed, appears now to have stopped
completely. Many residents of the 2500
collectives already formed, accounting
for about 17 percent of the rural popu
lation. have returned to traditional farm
ing methods.
Foreign agricultural specialists are
optimistic that the rice crop now being
cut will be the largest in years, although
still not sufficient to feed the country.
Water conditions have been just right.
Some diplomats also credit the en
couragement of private incentive, which

they say has brought more land under
cultivation.
The Seventh Resolution also eased
controls on trading with Thailand and
among the largely autonomous prov
inces. Managers ousted when their com
panies were nationalized after 1975 have
been invited to resume their old posi
tions.
Money needed
Police make little effort to stamp out
black-market money changing. In an ef
fort to bring illicit dollars to the surface,
a well-stocked Vientiane store formerly
reserved for foreigners has been opened
to any Laotian who presents the requisite
foreign currency.
At the same time, however, a state
owned network of retail stores and res
taurants is being put in place eventually,
it is hoped, to outsell the private mar
kets. Prices paid to suppliers have risen
in an effort to divert goods now entering
the private economy.
However, the state stores remain per
petually short of many basic consumer
goods.
Although many Vientiane citizens rely
on private enterprise for essentials, they
are required to study political theory
that holds that the institution is inherent
ly inefficient and exploitative.
In the first years, everyone from civil
servants to old women chewing betel nut
attended repeated political seminars.
Now the sessions are called less fre

quently, usually to explain new party
directives like the Seventh Resolution.
Seminars and politically oriented out
ings — collective labor, for instance —
not surprisingly compromise prod
uctivity. A scheduled tour of a handi
crafts factory was canceled when it was
discovered at the last minute that a sem
inar had halted work there.
The government does its best to make
political activities entertaining; collec
tive work teams often include singers
and guitar players to perform patriotic
songs. Still, effectiveness is placed in
question by the continuing crossings to
Thailand and people's open talk of dis
content.
The lure of Thailand may in fact have
drawn away 50.000 of the estimated
150.000 people living in Vientiane when
the Communists took control five years
ago. Many who remain talk openly of
leaving.
Since 1975, the Pathet Lao have at
tacked what are considered the more
glaring disorders of the old society.
Prostitution, drug addiction and begging
appear to have been cut back substantial
ly, although they continue.
This is not to say that the new govern
ment has won the affection of what is left
of Vientiane. Large numbers look upon
the Pathet Lao soldiers in their midst,
most of them youths from remote hill
districts, as an army of occupation that
treats them as second-class citizens.

Premier Kaysone Phomvihan made
the new policy official last December
with a lengthy speech outlining the ruling
party's "Seventh Resolution." Fear that
reconstruction after a quarter century of
war was faltering appears to have
prompted the changes.
Dependent on aid
Laos remains as dependent on foreign
aid as it had been under the U.S.-sup
ported government. About $94 million in
outside capital was injected into the

economy last year, mostly in project aid
from Eastern Europe and the United Na
tions.
War damage and lack of motivation
and technicians — thousands have fled
across the Mekong River to Thailand —
were causing shortages and staggering
deficits in foreign trade. Only half of the
80 sawmills operating in 1974 were still
functioning in a country where timber
and tin are the largest exports.
Drought followed by floods damaged
crops and forced the import of 250.000
tons oMood in 1977 and 1978. Moreover,
many farmers were abandoning their
fields and crossing to Thailand in re
sponse to forced collectivization.
Conceding that some cadre had "vio
lated stale laws and abused their power
by intimidating the people," Kaysone de
clared in his radio broadcast a year ago
this week that things would change.
Creation of new collectives, already
slowed, appears now to have stopped
completely. Many residents of the 2500
collectives already formed, accounting
for about 17 percent of the rural popu
lation. have returned to traditional farm
ing methods.
Foreign agricultural specialists are
optimistic that the rice crop now being
cut will be the largest in years, although
still not sufficient to feed the country.
Water conditions have been just right.
Some diplomats also credit the en
couragement of private incentive, which

they say has brought more land under
cultivation.
The Seventh Resolution also eased
controls on trading with Thailand and
among the largely autonomous prov
inces. Managers ousted when their com
panies were nationalized after 1975 have
been invited to resume their old posi
tions.
Money needed
Police make little effort to stamp out
black-market money changing. In an ef
fort to bring illicit dollars to the surface,
a well-stocked Vientiane store formerly
reserved for foreigners has been opened
to any Laotian who presents the requisite
foreign currency.
At the same time, however, a state
owned network of retail stores and res
taurants is being put in place eventually,
it is hoped, to outsell the private mar
kets. Prices paid to suppliers have risen
in an effort to divert goods now entering
the private economy.
However, the state stores remain per
petually short of many basic consumer
goods.
Although many Vientiane citizens rely
on private enterprise for essentials, they
are required to study political theory
that holds that the institution is inherent
ly inefficient and exploitative.
In the first years, everyone from civil
servants to old women chewing betel nut
attended repeated political seminars.
Now the sessions are called less fre

quently, usually to explain new party
directives like the Seventh Resolution.
Seminars and politically oriented out
ings — collective labor, for instance —
not surprisingly compromise prod
uctivity. A scheduled tour of a handi
crafts factory was canceled when it was
discovered at the last minute that a sem
inar had halted work there.
The government does its best to make
political activities entertaining; collec
tive work teams often include singers
and guitar players to perform patriotic
songs. Still, effectiveness is placed in
question by the continuing crossings to
Thailand and people's open talk of dis
content.
The lure of Thailand may in fact have
drawn away 50.000 of the estimated
150.000 people living in Vientiane when
the Communists took control five years
ago. Many who remain talk openly of
leaving.
Since 1975, the Pathet Lao have at
tacked what are considered the more
glaring disorders of the old society.
Prostitution, drug addiction and begging
appear to have been cut back substantial
ly, although they continue.
This is not to say that the new govern
ment has won the affection of what is left
of Vientiane. Large numbers look upon
the Pathet Lao soldiers in their midst,
most of them youths from remote hill
districts, as an army of occupation that
treats them as second-class citizens.
By The Washington Post
Vientiane, Laos — Troubled by eco
nomic stagnation and a seemingly end
less outflow of refugees, the five-year
old communist government of Laos has
slowed its efforts to organize the 3.4 mil
lion people into a Soviet-style collective
society.
Farmers at villages like Though Kang.
just outside Vientiane, have largely
abandoned communal tilling to work the
fields as privately held plots. In the city,
free-market trading in fresh food and
consumer goods is thriving under relax
ed government controls.
"They're stepping back to leap for
ward," a Western resident here said.
The current aproach does appear tem
porary. Portraits of Marx and Lenin in
government offices and continuing
"seminars" to introduce political theory
to ordinary Laotians leave little doubt
that long-term objectives remain the
same.
