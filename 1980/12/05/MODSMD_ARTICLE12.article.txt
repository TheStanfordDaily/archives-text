# Program faces delays
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” When President Jimmy
Carter signed the higher education bill on
Oct. 3, many middle-class parents looked
forward to a brand new program that would
allow them to get low-interest, government
guaranteed loans to send their children to
college.
The parent loans, up to $3000 a year per
student at nine percent interest, are an en
tirely new feature in the guaranteed col
lege-loan program, and are in addition to
the $2500 a year dependent students can
borrow on their own under the established
guaranteed student loan program. The new
parent-loan program is intended to help
middle-class parents with all the bills that
remain even after their son or daughter has
taken out a student loan.
But parents had better not start counting
the money yet.
Although the new program is supposed to
go into effect Jan 1, only one state, Massa
chusetts, now appears ready to start mak
ing the parent loans available for the re
mainder of the school year.
In a number of states, the new parent
loan program must get the okay of the state
legislature and the program, as a result,
isn't expected to start in some areas until
next summer.
One reason for the delay, according to
Eugene Cattie. executive director of the
Virginia Education Loan Authority in Rich
mond, is that the U.S. Department of
Education hasn't issued regulations spell
ing out detailed requirements governing the
program, and isn't expected to do so until
the end of this month.
As a result, Cattie said, banks that make
the actual loans and have them guaranteed
by state or special nonprofit agencies (with
the federal government providing interest
subsidies and reinsurance against defaults )
are reluctant to get into the program. "Len
ders are hesitant to get into a program
where the regulations are not defined yet.
Lenders are hesitant to jump in," said Cat
tie in a phone interview.
But even after they see and digest the reg

ulations. banks and other lending institu
tions, as well as the state guarantee agen
cies. need time to draw up and print new
contract forms and other necessary papers
for the parent loans, set up new procedures
and computerize their parent loan systems,
said Richard Hawk, president of the Higher
Education Assistance Foundation, a non
profit group that is the designated loan
guarantor in six states and the District of
Columbia.
"Assuming there were no clinkers in the
regulations," said Hawk in a telephone in
terview from Kansas, one of the states
where HEAF operates, "60 to 90 days after
the regulations would be the earliest" the
parent loan program could actually get
started in the HEAF states. Regulations
will not be available until Jan. 1.
Hawk said if the federal regulations had
been issued by Nov. 1, or about a month af
ter the bill was signed, it might have been
possible to start making loans in February
for students on a semester system. While he
said that from one point of view, three
months to write a regulation did seem like a
long time, on the other hand, he added that
"it simply takes the federal bureaucracy a
fairly long time to do these things" and in
that context three months really isn't so
long. (Others pointed out that it took the De
partment of Health, Education and Welfare
more than two years to issue final regu
lations for the 1976 student loan amend
ments. although loans were made without
them.)
David Bayer, chief of the Guaranteed Stu
dent Loan Branch of the Department of
Education, said final regulations are "in
clearance" but it takes a long time to go
through every word of the new law and set
up rules on how it should be run. Cattie,
agreeing on the difficulty, said it is a "very
complicated law" that must be studied very
carefully before the regulations come out.
Bayer said he believes bank and state pa
perwork and computerization require
ments, rather than regulation delays, will
be the primary reason most states won't get
the program started by February.
