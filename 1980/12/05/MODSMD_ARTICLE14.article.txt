# Boys' and girls' mathematic skills differ
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington - Girls and boys are not
equal in mathematical thinking, according
to a study of 10,0<)() gifted students tested
over a period of eight years. Boys as a group
show a large superiority as early as age
nine.
The work, published Friday in Science
magazine, is a major volley in the continu
ing academic battle over the extent to which
boys and girls differ naturally and the ex
tent to which they become different at the
hands of society.
This battle has focused recently on why
boys in general do better than girls on tests
of mathematical ability. Some reseachers
have contended that these apparent dif
ferences result wholly or in great part from
sex-biased training girls get at home and
school which leads them to think math is a
"boy's subject" and not very feminine.
The new research challenges that view.
Camilla Benbow and Julian Stanley,
Johns Hopkins University co-authors of the
study, concluded from their data that "sex
differences in achievement in and attitude
toward mathematics result from superior
male mathematical ability
They said that this superiority could be

caused by a number of things and is not nec
essarily genetic. It prubably results from a
combination of genetic and social factors,
though social factors may be less important
than previously believed.
However. l)r Elizabeth Fennema of the
University of Wisconsin, an education re
searcher who has also studied the subject,
said the whole question — while it may
make interesting research has no prac
tical importance
"The overlap in girls abilities and boys'
abilities is very great, so almost all females
can learn almost as well as ;ill males. And
tew of us come near our potentials anyway.
So in practical terms, genes are not the
things determining whether women will
succeed in engineering or some other sub
ject,' Fennema said.
But Sheila Tobias, author of the book
Math Anxiety, a study of girls and math
ability, countered that perceptions are im
portant because they influence the way girls
are treated in school. "It is a political issue.
This will influence the behavior of the
educational community . . . . I am in this re
search to get at the truth, but also for a polit
ical motive," Tobias said. "1 want to get the
country to accept this premise: that poten

tially girls can and boys can perform equal
ly "
The authors of the Johns Hopkins study
said they undertook the research in order to
make clear that there is a large difference
in the math performance of girls and boys
and it ought not to be ignored.
It is like the parable of the boy who
wants to play on the basketball team but
who is very short, said co-author Benbow.
The boy argues that he should make the
basketball team because he would have
been tall except for a childhood disease he
had. And being potentially as tall as anyone
else, he should make the team. This same
kind of argument has been used to ignore the
differences between girls and boys, and that
doesn't help the girls.''
At age 12. boys in the new study were
found superior to girls by an average of
about 40 points, out of an average of 475
scored. Among the top-scoring girls and
boys there were even greater differences —
;is high as 190 points. The test used was one
designed to measure reasoning ability in
mathematics •— the Scholastic Aptitude
Test in Mathematics - and not to measure
mathematics knowledge or computational
ability. Girls have proved equally good at
both those other tasks.the researchers said.
