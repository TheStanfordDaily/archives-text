## Power and societal imbalance 
### 
"Man s structural capacity to rape and wom
an's corresponding structural vulnerability are as
basic to the physiology of both our sexes as the
primal act of sex itseif." — Susan Brownmiller
The fundamental, primordial contrast in power
between men and women I forever best ex
emplified by the threat of rape) has always been
as deeply ingrained into human society as the con
trast in physiology What appalls me is when 1
read of utter imbeciles such as Michael Selmi
(Daily, Nov. 26) who whine when someone has
the conviction to remind us of this.
Leah Halper's excellent opinions this fall,
(often dealing with womens' issues) while
fascinating, honest, and relevant, were most im
pressive because of their sensitivity and re
straint. That Selmi should suggest her "articles
be discontinued because they are offensive to
men" is such a selfish, sexist statement that it
enrages me.
The problem
There can be no excuse for the present gross
sexual inequalities in economic and social power
across all realms of our lives. Not only are such
inequalities basically immoral, but they work
against the common good everywhere.
Throughout the developing world, and even
among the poorer communist nations, the self-re
inforcing linkages of illiteracy, malnutrition,
landlessness and political powerlessness all ac
crue very disproportionately to women In many
societies, such as the Turu. women are quite liter
ally chattel: i.e.. merely means of production;
traded, in fact, for cattle.
Regardless of the intentions of aid or of the
namings of decades, the international status of
women is not improving The effects of western
colonialism (which commercialized land and la
bor) have left women as neither wage earners
(while their nations industrialize) nor land
owners as male legal systems define ownerships.
Military, electoral and even simple mechanical
powers and authorities are so monopolized by
men as to ensure the perpetuation of low-author
ity status for women in the future.
Vet despite the apparent transfer of electoral
and legal liberties to women in the U.S.. we find,
relatively speaking, the same inferiority of status
as in less affluent, less literate nations. Face it:
the financial, political and militaristic powers of
this nation are exclusively male. Why? We allow
it. Ernst Callenbach argues in his novel.
Ecotopia, that women actually make more rea
sonable. competent and less violent leaders when
given real power.
Even locally, at Stanford, we find, again, noth
ing less than the same obscene relative disparity
of authority between the sexes. There can be no
excuse for the fact that Stanford accepts 80
percent more males as students here. And the
higher up we look, the fewer women we find. On

the graduate level there are 180 percent more
males than females. Females are hopelessly out
numbered on our faculty, our board of trustees,
and are excluded altogether at the top positions:
deans, provost, president.
The sadness
Melanie. who is perhaps the dearest person in
the world to me. is young, bright, articulate and
charming. She has also risen to the highest level
she can reach at her job in the Massachussetts
(ienerai Hospital. While working for her 1 was
saddened to see how she was intentionally ex
cluded from the status of her superiors who were
flagrantly, typically male.
It further distresses me as my female friends
attempt to sell themselves in the job market as
aggressive, cold male spirits packaged in sexy,
modern-liberated non-procreating bodies. More
depressing still, are the ones who give up any
aspiration to hold a job as important as that of the
men they succumb to tor life.
And so it is ironic that Halper, after writing
calmly and sincerely about the things she must
put up with (such as fear of rape), is attacked ("as
irresponsible") by such a fool as Selmi. who ap
parently can't even comprehend that her feelings
are real The irony, of course, is that Halper has
every reason to be one hundred times more angry
and insulting in her opinions.
The response
Selnu writes. "Rape .by and large it is not a
problem caused by Stanford men." Right then
Selmi misses the point entirely.
It is precisely the derogatory, even coercive at
titude of all the men in our society which tolerates
and perpetuates the occurrances of criminal rape
as well as the various more common coercions. As
Mary Wentworth recently wrote so beautifully
(Daily, Dec. 3). "Rape is a societal crime, per
petuated by a widely accepted attitude toward
women as objects ... to be used by men."
This attitude serves to reinforce the continued
monopoly of power and wealth by men. By any
moral standards it is cruel and illogical.
The response, therefore, is to refuse to ac
quiesce to the present, dominant social relations.
The proper response. Selmi. is not to be defensive
about the truth, but to undertake to eradicate the
inhumanities so lodged in our world,
"I try to understand—
he said
What will you undertake —
she said
VV7// you punish me for history—
he said.
What will you undertake —
she said."
— Adrienne Rich, poet.
