# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Bob Johnson Thoughts on the real world of agriculture 
### 
I would like to comment on
Matthew O'Connor's article
(Daily, Nov. 18) concerning the
future of agriculture.
His concern for agricultures'
"dependency" on petroleum
and petroleum products is based
on a poor perspective of the situ
ation. Consider that agriculture
as a user accounts for only 3.5
percent of the total energy con
sumption in the United States,
and through improved practices
is using less energy per unit of
output every year.
The average shopper con
sumes more energy driving to

the market and cooking a meal
than was used in production of
that food. Furthermore, for eve
ry unit of energy consumed, ag
riculture creates three units of
energy output, a good return on
our investment of resources.
O'Connor implies some sort
of correlation between soil
erosion and crop prices. He sug
gests that the land should not be
farmed continuously, but should
be left fallow periodically in or
der to "replenish itself" by
some magic process. How
nutrients that have been re
moved from the soil can find

their way back without as
sistance from a farmer. I do not
understand. It may be possible,
but could take many gener
ations. Meanwhile, those of us
occupying planet earth must eat
something now.
The only thing I have ever ob
served replenish itself during a
fallow period was water, and too
much of that can cause serious
erosion. problems. The best
erosion protection to the soil is a
strong healthy crop, whether in
rows or not. which breaks wind
and rain with its foliage, and
binds the soil together with its

roots.
The paragraph that states
farmers protect their invest
ment bv producing crops which
deplete the soil, and by not prac
ticing soil conservation meas
ure makes no sense at all. A
farmer's biggest investment is
in his soil, and he will do all in
his power to protect it.
How do I know all this? I have
been a farmer for 28 years on
land that has been farmed for
over one hundred years. During
this time it evolved from grain
and livestock production to
fresh and processed vegetable
production, which, according to
O'Connor, is a move from non
depleters to depleters. How
then, can he explain the fact
that this land has never been
more productive than now. and
is safer than ever from severe
soil erosion?
1 expect this land to be even
more productive in the future
than it is now This can only be
possible if the goverment gets
off the farmer s back, and lets
him produce for a profit, which
is all that is needed to care prop
erly for the land
It would also be helpful for the
government to adopt tax poli
cies that do not encourage
absentee ownership of farm
land. The best protector of the
soil is the farmer who lives on it.
and derives his livelihood from
it.
If O'Connor is interested in
finding out what the real world
of agriculture is all about, 1 will
be happy to give him a tour of
the Salinas Valley, where I have
farmed since leaving Stanford
in 1952.
