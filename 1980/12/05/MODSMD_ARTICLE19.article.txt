Rent increase
The proposed rent increase
for Kscondido Village i Daily,
Dec. 2) graphically demon
strates the ongoing lack of ad
ministrative concern for stu
dent housing at Stanford — both
graduate and undergraduate.
The Housing Office's justifi
cation for charging grad stu
dents for undergraduate hous
ing boils down to: "Yes. we're
screwing you over, but the un
dergraduates have been
screwed over worse for quite a
while, so it's only fair."
They are correct about one
point. Undergraduate housing is
seriously deficient at this
school Stanford officials should
be embarrassed that they are
still shoving undergrads into
leaky temporary trailers years
after those huts were supposed
to have outlived their use
fulness. Perhaps they are em
barrassed. because they're
planning to stick the less vocal
grad students in there instead (a
move, by the way. described in
Tuesday's story as a "benefit"
for graduate students.)
Stanford should also be em
barrassed that it accepts about.
30 percent more under

graduates than it can possibly
house, even including the
trailers as "housing." Obvious
ly. the $900() that Stanford col
\ects trom each of these mis
guided souls is enough to drive
away any concern that the ad
ministration might have for the
19-year-old forced to hunt
around in Halo Alto for a place
to live.
And even those who are
• guaranteed" are treated un
fairly. Rather than using an
equitable room draw by class
system, under which a student
would draw a lottery number
within his class with the future
seniors drawing first followed
by the juniors and so on. a Stan
ford undergraduate draws in
one colossal tottery in which it is
possible to draw a bad number
three straight times — or draw a
great one as a freshman and nog
a really good dorm for three
years thanks to a "squatters
rights"-type priority.
None of this, however, justi
fies making a profit off grad stu
dents (who can least afford it)
to help subsidize the completion
of an undergraduate dorm that
should have been built long ago.
Housing Director Ed Scoles' ra

tionalizations for the plan are
unbelievable. So "a one
bedroom apartment in Palo Alto
runs about $380 per month" —
that's because people who rent
apartments in Palo Alto are
doing it to make as much money
from their tenants as they can.
This is only natural; it's a busi
ness How dare Stanford's hous
ing department treat effective
ly captive grad students as
sources of profit? On-campus
graduate housing should bring
in enough to break even and
that's all It's outrageous to try
to squeeze grads for extra cash
to pay other bills, especially
when they don't have rich pa
rents paying their fees — or
child care costs either.
Facilities Manager Jerry
Parks' statement. "The distinc
tion between undergraduates
and graduates is a common mis
conception. It's all Stanford
housing," is an absolute crock.
Just try to live in 558 Mayfield as
a grad student! This sudden
merger has been engineered for
one reason only: undergraduate
housing is hurting and they want
the grads. heretofore self-suffi
cient, to start footing some of
the University's bills.
It was bad enough when they
jacked up our rent by 14 percent
in September, claiming in
creased energy costs as the
cause (even though their own
posted information shows the
increases to be much smaller.)
But now we're told that we can
pay another 12.5 percent on top
of that, and live in trailers if we
want as a reward. No thanks,
Stanford, no thanks!

Fuzzy vs. tech
I am disturbed by the at
titudes in Grace Nakashima's
opinions column "I wish I were
a humanities major blues"
(Daily, Dec. 2). It appears un
thinkable to her that different
disciplines at Stanford might
not prove egalitarian. The
simple fact is, however, that
tech majors do require more
time and endurance and possi
bly more intelligence as well.
Tech courses require on the
average two and a half times the
work of a fuzzy course. Thus a
three unit Electrical Engineer
ing course is equivalent to seven
and a half units of Philosophy.
This is due to the Engineering
department wanting to require
more units than the University
would allow them to require.
Kather than lowering the
number of classes required,
they just lowered the number of
units that they are worth.
And even if there was a one
to-one correspondence between
units, an Engineering major re
quires 123 units while a
Philosophy major only requires
54units.
Finally. 1 have not found it
difficult to achieve a 4.0 in my
fuzzy studies, while I find that
tech studies are much more
competitive. In other words, it
is quite possible that although
fuzzy majors would only lower
the curve in tech courses, tech
majors might be raising the
curve in fuzzy courses when
they have the time to take them.
It is a mistake to ask that
things be considered equal in the
world when in reality they are
not. The reply to a tech major
who complains is quite frankly,
"If you don't enjoy it, and you
are not greedy enough, then
drop it." And the consolation to
fuzzy majors is that although
tech majors can examine what
can be done, only fuzzy majors
can examine what should be
done.

Bandwagon
For those of you who haven t
been reading your Herb Caen
lately, or listening to Cal fans
and some alums, there has been
a resurgence of the everpresent
criticism of the Stanford Band,
i.e. that what we do is old and,
therefore, not funny anymore.
Of course there is some truth to
this, but it is all too easy to jump
on the anti-Bandwagon if you
don't realize the following
aspects of the situation.
First, we still get off on and
believe in what we do, what we

are and the fact that we still re
ject and satirize Bullshit in
whatever form it chooses to
take. Second, the music of the
t>os and early '70s. which is
most of our repertoire, ex
presses this anti-crap attitude
also. That's why it STILL feels
right to play the "old" songs.
Disco and sappy pop like
Fuckwood Mac just don't give
you that Incomparable feeling.
New Wave, when it's good, can
be inspiring and we're working
on arranging some; but it's hard
to chart synthesizer for 144 as
sorted horns and drums. Third,
it is also hard to come up with
new kinds of field shows that
still give each bandmember his
or her own "creative space."
i.e. shows that allow for and en
courage individual deviance.
Anyway, while the music and
art world turns itself inside-out.
looking for new forms of ex
pression. the Band also engages
in serious soul-searching. There
are new ideas, we are pushing
onward, but never at the ex
pense of the original feeling, our
artistic freedom and integrity,
it you will (and even if you
won't).
You will see and hear new
forms in the coming years, but
we hope that, in spirit, it will
always be the same old Leland

Fulfillment?
Several years ago, I had a
friend who was a Nazi and a
weightlifter. His prime motiva
tion for weight-training was to
be able to beat up any black he
met on the street. He got me in
volved in weightlifting, al
though my motivation was en
tirely different: I simply
wanted to actualize my physical
potential Today I am bigger,
stronger, faster, and more dan
gerous than most men. Yet
there are many men much big
ger. stronger, faster and more
dangerous than I. I do not spend
my days and nights reminding
myself, however, that one of
these more powerful men may
attack me.
I have another friend, a beau
tiful woman who is a doctoral
student. She is also a three-time
All-American swimmer, a long
distance runner, and a
weightlifter. She weighs 132
pounds, bench-presses 200. and
has a maximal oxygen-uptake of
66 milliliters per kilogram She
doesn't walk around afraid that
men in general — or even that
fraction of those who are bigger,

stronger, faster, and more dan
gerous than she — might attack
her.
We have both taken responsi
bility for being all that we can
be physically, and a strange
thing happens when you do that:
you lose your grudge against the
world for the physical limita
tions that you do have. While
there remains a real risk, an in
ternal. peaceful satisfaction oc
curs at having done one's own
job. at having fulfilled one's own
personal responsibility.
I suggest that were Leah
Halper to spend less time whin
ing about how dangerous other
people are and more time fulfill
ing her own personal physical
responsibilities, she would both
be at less real risk and lose her
paranoic obsession with men
still bigger, stronger, faster,
and more dangerous than her
new self.
Is she too lazy to get her butt
into the gym? Or is she still so
sexist as to believe that women
are either innately or properly
small, weak, slow and helpless?
