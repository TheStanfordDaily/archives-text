# Stanford shares first gene-splicing patent
## 
### David Frank 
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia were awarded the country's
first patent for gene-splicing techni
ques on Tuesday. University officials
announced Wednesday.
The U.S. Patent Office granted the
patents for the genetic technology de
veloped by two biochemists, Dr.
Stanley Cohen of Stanford, and Dr.
Herbert Boyer of UC-San Francisco.
The patent covers the technique
Cohen and Boyer developed seven
years ago to transfer deox
yribonucleic acid (DNA) — the hered
itary substance of living organisms —
from one species of organism to anoth
er, according to Neils Reimers, direc
tor of the University's Office of Tech
nology Licensing.
A second part of the patent applica
tion covers the products that result
from using Cohen and Boyer's techni
que. Reimers told the Daily yester
day.
the genetic recombination method
Cohen and Boyer developed allows the
introduction of various segments of
bacterial DNA molecules into the
DNA of unrelated bacterial cells.
These later recombinant cells can
then express properties from the
donor cells.
Cohen and Boyer first reported the
construction of the genetic recombi
nant cells — and the splicing technique
used to construct the recombinants —
in 1973.
Since then, genetic recombination
research has made possible the in
dustrial production of hormones such
as insulin, which is used by diabetics,
and inteferon, which is thought to fight
viral infections and possibly cancer.
Genetic engineering firms have
parlayed the new technology into
large profits. A firm co-founded by
Boyer in 1976 — Genentech of South
San Francisco — recently sold its first
stock on the open market, and the
price rose from $35 to $89 after only 90
minutes.
Reimers cautioned against specula
tion that the new patent would provide
Stanford with millions of dollars in
royalties Noting that it took six years
for the federal Food and Drug Admin
istration to process the application for
the Boyer-Cohen technique, he said
that products resulting from the new
technology likely will require a long
period of time before being approved.
The companies with licensing agree
ments for the patent will be required
to follow the safety guidelines estab

lished by the National Institute of
Health for recombinant DNA re
search. he noted.
Both Cohen and Boyer have waived
their right to personal royalties, Re
imers said. Normally, Stanford's roy
alty distribution process would direct
one-third of the money to the inventor,
one-third to the inventor's department
and one-third to the inventor's school
(medicine, engineering, etc.)
In this case. Cohen's share will go to
research and funding along with the
rest of the royalties allotted to the
University, according Reimers.
When the second part the patent ap
plication is approved, Reimers said
Stanford and the University of Califor
nia will issue non-exclusive licenses to
more than one firm, rather than one
exculsive license.
Non-exclusive licenses are nor

mally issued, he said, when the techni
que is "basic." requiring relatively
low investment by companies.
Often, he continued, when the proc
esses or techniques embodied in uni
versity patents require a relatively
heavy investment, exclusive licenses
are issued. Thus a company is en
couraged to develop the product, since
the license prevents competition from
other companies.
Cohen and Boyer's gene-splicing
technique has been carried out in a
number of laboratories, Reimers
noted. "The technique is a basic tool.
There's no fear of it being copied.
That's why we will be licensing it non
exclusivelv," he added.
Since the time Cohen and Boyer's
technique was invented, the field of
genetic recombination has been the
subject of great controversy because
of the ethical issues involved in mixing
the hereditary properties of different
biological organisms, and, in essence,
creating new life.
In 1976. the National Institute of
Health established guidelines for re

combinant DNA research. But as re
search progressed without the ac
cidental creation of the genetic
"monsters" that some people feared,
the guidelines have been eased.
In addition, a giant legal hurdle was
removed last spring when the U.S. Su
preme Court ruled 5-4 that recombi
nant biological organisms could be
patented
