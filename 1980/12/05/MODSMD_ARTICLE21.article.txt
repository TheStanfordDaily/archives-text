# Policy analysis unit proposed
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Los Angeles— A group of present and former
senior officials, criticizing the way policy
analysis is now handled at the White House,
has urged President-elect Ronald Reagan to
create a special policy analysis unit to assist
him in presidential decision-making.
The 22-member group, including 20 persons
who served in the four most recent adminis
trations, declared at a meeting in Washington:
"It was recognized that because presiden
tial decision-making is necessarily more than
the summing up of the views of agencies, each
of which has its own needs and constituencies,
the analytical input into the president's de
cision cannot be simply added up from the re
sults of agency analyses. The president needs
his own analytical filter — a better one than he
now has. ''
The group passed on to the Reagan transi
tion team a copy of its recommendations.

made in a statement that grew out of a session
held in the office of the Carnegie Endowment
in Washington before the election.
The group, drawing on its own experience in
government, also concluded that:
—Too many present government analysts
and too many new analysts entering govern
ment ff-om graduate schools fail to understand
the ways in which public decisions are made
and therefore provide analyses that are fre
quently irrelevant.
—Policy analysis too frequently slights is
sues of implementation and this can result in ;•
negative impact on the quality of policy.
—A new analysis filter for the president
should not be an organization carrying out its
own studies or its own sponsorship of outside
studies. Rather, it should analyze other work
lor validity and relevance, and summarize its
relation to the president's needs.
