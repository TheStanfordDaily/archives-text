## Murphy favored for top Labor post 
### Washington Post 
Washington - The night after Ronald Re
agan's victory, Robert Thompson, a labor
lawyer from Greenville, SC., placed a
phone call to Sen Orrin Hatch
It wasn t entirely a social call. Not only
had a Republican been elected president,
but the Senate also had been placed in Re
publican hands, and Hatch (R-Utah), had
fallen heir to the chairmanship of the Senate
Labor Committee. After an exchange of
pleasantries, Thompson asked Hatch if he
had a candidate for secretary of labor.
He did — Betty Southard Murphy, former
chairman of the National Labor Relations
Board. Thompson, who is chairman of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce labor commit
tee, said Murphy was his candidate as well
Murphy has company on the list of poten
tial secretarys of labor however: Dick
Schubert, Ronald Reagan's transition ad
viser, and Rep John Krlenborn, (R-Ill.),
who is actively seeking the post and has
called Vice President-elect George Bush
and former President Gerald Ford.
Republicans traditionally have difficulty
finding a suitable secretary of labor. In the
past. Republican presidents generally
selected candidates who would soothe, rath
er than anger, the Democrats in organized
labor.
Soothe Democrats
If selected. Murphy would be very much
in the don't-rock-the-boat tradition of peo
ple like John Dunlop and William Usery. In
ticking off her virtues, Hatch stressed that
as well as being a "consummate labor law
yer, a good manager and a feminist, she is
also acceptable to both sides — labor and
business."'
Thompson said he called Murphy Nov. 6
to sound her out for the job. According to
Thompson, Murphy "made it clear to me
that she was not seeking the post, but she did
give me the impression that she would take

it."i
Murphy, a partner-in the law firm of
Baker & Hostetler. stresses that she is
"strongly motivated to stay here," but she
leaves the door to the Labor Department
ajar when she concedes that if the presi
dent-elect "thought I could contribute
something that other people are unable to
contribute, then I d seriously consider it."
Neither Hatch nor Thompson seem dis
couraged by Murphy's reaction. Thompson
quickly lined up a formal endorsement by
the Chamber of Commerce; Hatch has
called a series of Reagan insiders on her
behalf
In a widely circulated letter to Sen. Paul
Laxalt (R-Nev.l, a top Reagan adviser.
Hatch noted that Murphy "figured in the
Teamster endorsement" of Reagan And
when Reagan visited the Teamsters' Wash
ington headquarters Nov. 18. union presi
dent Frank Fitzsimmons told the president
elect that the union wanted Murphy as sec
retary of labor.
Labor support
Meanwhile. Murphy's own friendships
with prominent labor leaders are standing
her in good stead during the transition peri
od. just as they did during the campaign. In
late August she helped arrange a meeting
between Kdwin Meese. a top Reagan aide,
and AFL-CK) president Lane Kirkland. In
October, she took the lead in introducing
Meese to prominent labor leaders at a
Washington reception
The AFL-CIO has not formally endorsed a
candidate for secretary of labor, but its
fondness for Murphy is clear. Thomas
Donahue, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer,
whose friendship with Murphy began when
she became the Labor Department's wage
and-hour administrator in 1974. calls her "a
bright and talented administrator who un
derstands the labor movement and the
aspirations of working people."

The AFL-ClO's position could be impor
tant. because other Republican presidents
have given it a de facto veto over the post of
labor secretary.
Formidable opposition
Others close to Donahue and Kirkland
take this effusive praise of Murphy with a
grain of salt. "I know what Lane and Tom
think of Betty Murphy, and it's not flat
tering. said a source close to the AP'L-CIO
leadership. "But she's so persistent they
don t know what to do with her."
Indeed. Murphy's friends can describe
her as the world's pushiest woman" and a
skilled Washington operator in the same
sentence.
Nevertheless, a person with the active 1
support of Hatch, the Chamber of Com
merce and the Teamsters, as well as the
tacit approval of the AFL-CIO, would ap
pear to be a cinch as secretary of labor in
the Reagan administration. But efforts on
behalf of Murphy have triggered something
of a counterreaction in the business com
munity.
Thompson describes the anti-Murphy
sentiments as "a little tug of war," but re
cent evidence suggests that may be some
thing of an understatement.
Ihe National Association of Manufac
turers (NAM) — the chamber's traditional
rival — endorsed five candidates for secre
tary of labor, including Krlenborn and
Schubert. Murphy's name was pointedly not
on the NAM list.
All this may have little ultimate bearing
on the identity of the next secretary of la
bor. There is just one voter in that election,
and his name is Ronald Reagan.

Murphy, a partner-in the law firm of
Baker & Hostetler. stresses that she is
"strongly motivated to stay here," but she
leaves the door to the Labor Department
ajar when she concedes that if the presi
dent-elect "thought I could contribute
something that other people are unable to
contribute, then I d seriously consider it."
Neither Hatch nor Thompson seem dis
couraged by Murphy's reaction. Thompson
quickly lined up a formal endorsement by
the Chamber of Commerce; Hatch has
called a series of Reagan insiders on her
behalf
In a widely circulated letter to Sen. Paul
Laxalt (R-Nev.l, a top Reagan adviser.
Hatch noted that Murphy "figured in the
Teamster endorsement" of Reagan And
when Reagan visited the Teamsters' Wash
ington headquarters Nov. 18. union presi
dent Frank Fitzsimmons told the president
elect that the union wanted Murphy as sec
retary of labor.
Labor support
Meanwhile. Murphy's own friendships
with prominent labor leaders are standing
her in good stead during the transition peri
od. just as they did during the campaign. In
late August she helped arrange a meeting
between Kdwin Meese. a top Reagan aide,
and AFL-CK) president Lane Kirkland. In
October, she took the lead in introducing
Meese to prominent labor leaders at a
Washington reception
The AFL-CIO has not formally endorsed a
candidate for secretary of labor, but its
fondness for Murphy is clear. Thomas
Donahue, AFL-CIO secretary-treasurer,
whose friendship with Murphy began when
she became the Labor Department's wage
and-hour administrator in 1974. calls her "a
bright and talented administrator who un
derstands the labor movement and the
aspirations of working people."

The AFL-ClO's position could be impor
tant. because other Republican presidents
have given it a de facto veto over the post of
labor secretary.
Formidable opposition
Others close to Donahue and Kirkland
take this effusive praise of Murphy with a
grain of salt. "I know what Lane and Tom
think of Betty Murphy, and it's not flat
tering. said a source close to the AP'L-CIO
leadership. "But she's so persistent they
don t know what to do with her."
Indeed. Murphy's friends can describe
her as the world's pushiest woman" and a
skilled Washington operator in the same
sentence.
Nevertheless, a person with the active 1
support of Hatch, the Chamber of Com
merce and the Teamsters, as well as the
tacit approval of the AFL-CIO, would ap
pear to be a cinch as secretary of labor in
the Reagan administration. But efforts on
behalf of Murphy have triggered something
of a counterreaction in the business com
munity.
Thompson describes the anti-Murphy
sentiments as "a little tug of war," but re
cent evidence suggests that may be some
thing of an understatement.
Ihe National Association of Manufac
turers (NAM) — the chamber's traditional
rival — endorsed five candidates for secre
tary of labor, including Krlenborn and
Schubert. Murphy's name was pointedly not
on the NAM list.
All this may have little ultimate bearing
on the identity of the next secretary of la
bor. There is just one voter in that election,
and his name is Ronald Reagan.
Washington - The night after Ronald Re
agan's victory, Robert Thompson, a labor
lawyer from Greenville, SC., placed a
phone call to Sen Orrin Hatch
It wasn t entirely a social call. Not only
had a Republican been elected president,
but the Senate also had been placed in Re
publican hands, and Hatch (R-Utah), had
fallen heir to the chairmanship of the Senate
Labor Committee. After an exchange of
pleasantries, Thompson asked Hatch if he
had a candidate for secretary of labor.
He did — Betty Southard Murphy, former
chairman of the National Labor Relations
Board. Thompson, who is chairman of the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce labor commit
tee, said Murphy was his candidate as well
Murphy has company on the list of poten
tial secretarys of labor however: Dick
Schubert, Ronald Reagan's transition ad
viser, and Rep John Krlenborn, (R-Ill.),
who is actively seeking the post and has
called Vice President-elect George Bush
and former President Gerald Ford.
Republicans traditionally have difficulty
finding a suitable secretary of labor. In the
past. Republican presidents generally
selected candidates who would soothe, rath
er than anger, the Democrats in organized
labor.
Soothe Democrats
If selected. Murphy would be very much
in the don't-rock-the-boat tradition of peo
ple like John Dunlop and William Usery. In
ticking off her virtues, Hatch stressed that
as well as being a "consummate labor law
yer, a good manager and a feminist, she is
also acceptable to both sides — labor and
business."'
Thompson said he called Murphy Nov. 6
to sound her out for the job. According to
Thompson, Murphy "made it clear to me
that she was not seeking the post, but she did
give me the impression that she would take

it."i
