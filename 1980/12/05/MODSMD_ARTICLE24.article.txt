# Scientists assess Voyager findings
## Data reveals basis for life 
### Benjamin Lloyd 
The key to the beginnings of organic corn
pounds, upon which life is based, may be found
on Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, clarifying
a problem that has intrigued physical chemists
for decades.
In a workshop held at the Ames division of
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) on Dec. 1 and2, approximately
25 scientists from NASA and various univer
sities and scientific institutions from around
the country gathered to discuss Titan's at
mosphere. The investigation focused on recent
findings and data collected by NASA's Voy
ager spacecraft on its journey through the so
lar system.
Little or nothing was previously known
about the satellite beyond its size and distance
from Saturn, and the data and photographs re
ceived from Voyager were greeted with
cautious anticipation as scientists waited to
have their theories disproved or confirmed.
According to Ames official Dr. Jeffrey Cuzzi,
this workshop came as the culmination of
speculation and investigation over the past few
years on the nature of Saturn and its rings and
moons.
Further exploration in the form of at
mospheric entry probes to Saturn and Titan, as
well as possible surface probes to Titan, have
hinged on the Voyager findings, said James
Murphy, Ames advanced program manager.
The design, construction and launching of
these probes requires information on at
mospheric density, temperature and light
quality. Before the Voyager expedition, scien
tists and engineers were forced to construct al
ternative models and designs for the possible
conditions.
Spectroscopic experiments into the size and
quantity of aerosols in the atmosphere re
vealed a heavy density of small particles vary
ing with altitude. According to Martin
Tomasko, a researcher at the University of Ar
izona, blue light was found to penetrate only
within about 200 miles of the surface, while red
light reached the surface of the satellite itself,
passing through several layers of "smog."
These studies revealed a probable ratio of
methane to nitrogen of 3 to 5 percent. This mix
ture of nitrogen and methan was almost com
pletely unexpected, Cuzzi said, and has far
reaching consequences in both organic
chemistry and physics.
The presence of nitrogen interests organic
chemists because it forms the basis for life.
The combination of nitrogen, methane and a
form of available energy can produce the or
ganic compounds that form the building blocks
for life-like forms.
However, the satellite's temperature of ap

proximately 90 degrees Kelvin, while cold
enough to permit nitrogen and methane to re
main in their liquid form, and to vaporize
through exposure to sunlight, prohibits the va
porization of water to produce oxygen. Without
oxygen, no life can begin to form.
Titan is stuck in the stage of development be
tween the formation of simple compounds
from inorganic elements and the production
of actual life-giving compounds (the next step
to DNA >.
James Pollock, Ames researcher, at
tempted to explain why Titan is "the only sat
ellite in the solar system that (we know) has a
substantial atmosphere.'' Titan has an at
mosphere whose density is only surpassed by
Venus, the second planet of the solar system. It
relates, he claimed, to the types of material
from which it was formed in the first place,
and to its position in relation to the sun.
The complete answer to this puzzle of the ex
istence of such an atmosphere on the satellite
may come in the course of proposed expedi
tions that will be launched in the early 19905,
Murphy postulated. The funding of the probes
is subject to congressional approval. He said
that if the current trend in voting continues,
the spacecraft should be funded and under
production by the late 1980s.
The planned investigation system will con
tain an orbiter, to take photographs of the
planets and to monitor transmissions from the
atmospheric entry probes, which will collect
data both during the descent through the at
mosphere and on its short stay on the surface.
The entry probe, which will carry various in
struments, such as a gas chromatograph to
measure the molecular structure of the atoms
in the atmosphere and on the surface, an in
frared spectrometer to measure the diffrac
tion of light by the particles in the atmosphere,
and a specially-designed camera, able to take
and transmit pictures through the thick air,
will only be able to function for a few hours.
The Titan study, which so far has cost $500
million (or a "six-pack of beer for each
citizen," as Cuzzi put it) will eventually ex
plain many things about observed and theo
rized physical events that were until recently
beyond the reach of physical science. The Voy
ager expedition has already answered many
questions about the formation and structure of
the solar system, aand so far, has presented
several unpredicted results.
Unlike the Soviet program, which is concen
trating on the planet Venus, the NASA explor
tions will reveal much about the farthest
reaches of the solar system, and with shared
knowledge, may give an accurate picture of its
own development, from the stages of planet
formation.

oxygen, no life can begin to form.

James Pollock, Ames researcher, at
tempted to explain why Titan is "the only sat
ellite in the solar system that (we know) has a
substantial atmosphere.'' Titan has an at
mosphere whose density is only surpassed by
Venus, the second planet of the solar system. It
relates, he claimed, to the types of material
from which it was formed in the first place,
and to its position in relation to the sun.
The complete answer to this puzzle of the ex
istence of such an atmosphere on the satellite
may come in the course of proposed expedi
tions that will be launched in the early 19905,
Murphy postulated. The funding of the probes
is subject to congressional approval. He said
that if the current trend in voting continues,
the spacecraft should be funded and under
production by the late 1980s.
The planned investigation system will con
tain an orbiter, to take photographs of the
planets and to monitor transmissions from the
atmospheric entry probes, which will collect
data both during the descent through the at
mosphere and on its short stay on the surface.
The entry probe, which will carry various in
struments, such as a gas chromatograph to
measure the molecular structure of the atoms
in the atmosphere and on the surface, an in
frared spectrometer to measure the diffrac
tion of light by the particles in the atmosphere,
and a specially-designed camera, able to take
and transmit pictures through the thick air,
will only be able to function for a few hours.
The Titan study, which so far has cost $500
million (or a "six-pack of beer for each
citizen," as Cuzzi put it) will eventually ex
plain many things about observed and theo
rized physical events that were until recently
beyond the reach of physical science. The Voy
ager expedition has already answered many
questions about the formation and structure of
the solar system, aand so far, has presented
several unpredicted results.
Unlike the Soviet program, which is concen
trating on the planet Venus, the NASA explor
tions will reveal much about the farthest
reaches of the solar system, and with shared
knowledge, may give an accurate picture of its
own development, from the stages of planet
formation.
The key to the beginnings of organic corn
pounds, upon which life is based, may be found
on Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, clarifying
a problem that has intrigued physical chemists
for decades.
In a workshop held at the Ames division of
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis
tration (NASA) on Dec. 1 and2, approximately
25 scientists from NASA and various univer
sities and scientific institutions from around
the country gathered to discuss Titan's at
mosphere. The investigation focused on recent
findings and data collected by NASA's Voy
ager spacecraft on its journey through the so
lar system.
Little or nothing was previously known
about the satellite beyond its size and distance
from Saturn, and the data and photographs re
ceived from Voyager were greeted with
cautious anticipation as scientists waited to
have their theories disproved or confirmed.
According to Ames official Dr. Jeffrey Cuzzi,
this workshop came as the culmination of
speculation and investigation over the past few
years on the nature of Saturn and its rings and
moons.
Further exploration in the form of at
mospheric entry probes to Saturn and Titan, as
well as possible surface probes to Titan, have
hinged on the Voyager findings, said James
Murphy, Ames advanced program manager.
The design, construction and launching of
these probes requires information on at
mospheric density, temperature and light
quality. Before the Voyager expedition, scien
tists and engineers were forced to construct al
ternative models and designs for the possible
conditions.
Spectroscopic experiments into the size and
quantity of aerosols in the atmosphere re
vealed a heavy density of small particles vary
ing with altitude. According to Martin
Tomasko, a researcher at the University of Ar
izona, blue light was found to penetrate only
within about 200 miles of the surface, while red
light reached the surface of the satellite itself,
passing through several layers of "smog."
These studies revealed a probable ratio of
methane to nitrogen of 3 to 5 percent. This mix
ture of nitrogen and methan was almost com
pletely unexpected, Cuzzi said, and has far
reaching consequences in both organic
chemistry and physics.
The presence of nitrogen interests organic
chemists because it forms the basis for life.
The combination of nitrogen, methane and a
form of available energy can produce the or
ganic compounds that form the building blocks
for life-like forms.
However, the satellite's temperature of ap

proximately 90 degrees Kelvin, while cold
enough to permit nitrogen and methane to re
main in their liquid form, and to vaporize
through exposure to sunlight, prohibits the va
porization of water to produce oxygen. Without
oxygen, no life can begin to form.
