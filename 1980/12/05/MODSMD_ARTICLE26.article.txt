# U.S. car sales down
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
After five months of slow but
steady recovery, U.S. auto sales
took a turn for the worse in No
vember as higher interest rates
and car prices kept customers
out of the market.
Industry officials said
Wednesday that in the final 10
days of the month, sales of U.S.-
made cars slipped back nearly
to the depressed rate recorded
during the depths of the current
slump last May.
With interest rates ap
proaching the 20 percent level of
last spring, industry analysts
fear that Detroit's long-awaited
recovery may again be delayed,
perhaps until the spring of 1981.
The decline in auto sales in
November also indicates that
the nation's economic wounds
are not healing as quickly as
some economists believed they
would a few months ago. and
provides further evidence that
high interest rates could push
the economy into another re
cession.
The worrisome new down
ward turn in auto sales may also
foreshadow another series of

temporary auto plant closings
and worker layoffs if it con
tinues into December.
At current schedules, U.S.
auto production in the fourth
quarter will total just over 1.7
million vehicles, the lowest for
the quarter in a non-strike year
since 1959 (Production was low
er in the fourth quarter of 1970
when General Motors Corp.
plants were shut down due to a
nationwide strike.)
Analysts believe the higher
prices of 1981 model cars —
which average 8.6 percent more
than their 1980 counterparts —
are at least partially respon
sible for the slack sales.
But they also believe that
high interest rates are the main
cause of the industry's current
dilemma. Car dealers finance
their purchases of cars from the
manufacturer by borrowing
from banks or finance com
panies. usually at interest rates
slighly above the prime. With
rat high, dealers are very re
luctant to order any car they do
not believe thev can sell quick
ly.
