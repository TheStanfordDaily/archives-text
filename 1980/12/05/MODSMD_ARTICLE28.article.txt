# Basket ball a 'challenge,' college 'professionalism' no problem, says A.D.
## The
						Friday Interview: Andy Geiger 
### 
Editor's note: Andy Geiger
came to the Farm only two
years ago and has already set
his feet firmly into Stanford
soil. As Director of Athletics, he
has become one of the most
popular figures on campus —
right up there with Fred
liar gad on and He rant
Katchadorian. I'erhaps it has to
do with his lift of the bottle-ban
in Stanford Stadium which
warmed the hearts and light
ened the heads of a large part of
the student body on home
game-Saturdays.
More than likely, though, it
has to do with the dynamic, yet
morally firm approach he has
taken throughout his career in
athletic administration. Com
ing from the University of
Pennsylvania and Brown,
(iciger entered the Stanford
community while regarded as
'one of the brightest minds in his
profession. He has clout and in
fluence nationally and carries
himself with the kind of humil
ity and confident friendliness
which earned him his status.
In this Friday Interview with
Mike lineal, (ieiger discussed
Stanford's basketball program,
its future and the state of col
lege professionalism nationally.
Daily: What do you feel are the
greatest assets of Stanford's
athletic program compared to
other schools'?
Geiger: That's a hard question
to answer. The advantages

Stanford has totally are the
same as those we have athlet
ically. Stanford's stature as a
university is the greatest asset
we have athletically. We're able
to be an attractive place for
prospective student-athletes
and we can compete extremely
well because of that.
Daily: Are there any problems
with that from your stand
point? Hoes the old complaint
that Stanford has to recruit stu
dent-athletes instead of just
athletes make the school in
herently less competitive?
Geiger: Everyone who comes
here is aware of that (situ
ation). If you're asking me to
complain, I have no complaints.
What you've stated is a fact of
life and in that sense, it's not a
problem. We go into the com
petition knowing what the rules
are.
Daily: If there is any one place
in which that difficulty seems
especially apparent, it's with
the basketball team. Do you
consider Stanford basketball a
problem?
Geiger: The basketball pro
gram at Stanford is a challenge,
which is different than saying
it's a problem. I think we're
starting to do some of the things
we have to do to succeed in
basketball — that is, to gradu
ally improve our recruiting tac
tics and to gradually make it
clear to people that we're seri
ous about basketball and corn

peting in Division I.
Daily: Is it particularly hard to
recruit basketball players to
Stanford?

Geiger: I'm not sure it is. I just
think we have to do a better job.
There are no excuses. If you're
looking for excuses, we have
none.
Daily: But why do you think
there is a problem?
Geiger: There must be some
reasons because we haven't
competed very well in our con
ference. But there's no magic
kind of answer — no instant
solution — to turning what has
traditionally been a weak pro
gram into a traditionally strong
one. That's the hardest thing to
do in athletics — to reverse
years and years and years of a
certain level of competition. I
think in time we'll improve.

Daily: An answer commonly
given for Stanford's recruiting
problems is that many (if not
most) of the best basketball
players come from inner-city or
lower-class neighborhoods and
simply haven't had the educa
tional opportunities which
would allow them to get into
Stanford. Is there any validity
to that?
Geiger: I don't know. I think re
cent stories in the Daily and oth
er journals on campus have
talked about Stanford's lack of
success in recruiting in the in
ner-city. Black students at Stan
ford have said we have to do a
better job. That's a Stanford
priority: we have to do a better
job across the board.
Daily: What's the difference
between Stanford football and
Stanford basketball as far as re
cruiting?
Geiger: Success breeds more
success. Failure is a difficult
thing to overcome in a tradi
tional sense. As I said before,
we have no excuses. We don't
excuse the basketball program,
and we try to use the football
program as an example of what
we can achieve.
Daily: The cover story in last
week's Sports Illustrated con
cerned the reasons why Ralph
Sampson, Mark Aguirre and
filbert King didn't choose to
participate in the NBA hard
ship draft. Five to 10 years ago,
that wouldn't have been an is
sue. Do you think that posits
anything about the state of col
lege basketball or college ath
letics in general?
Geiger: I suspect basketball
may move in the direction of
baseball where there is very lit
tle protection of the colleges by
the pros. The player may or may
not elect to go hardship, but
that's up to the individual col
lege. the challenge of the pro
gram there and how well it
meets the needs of the student.
Daily: Do you feel the NCAA or
another national body should
try to fight that?
Geiger: No. I don't think so.
Daily: Hut doesn't the pro
fessionalism of the game now
defeat the purpose of college
athletics?
Geiger: No. I don'tthink so. You
have to get into a definition of
what the purpose of college ath
letics is. College athletics
should essentially survive be
cause they're intrinsically valu
able to those who participate. If
they elect that it isn't, then that

college or institution isn't meet
ing the needs of that student and
the student decides to go
elsewhere. I don't think you
should worry about national leg
islation to protect yourself (as
an athletic department). If you
begin to do that, I think you'll
begin to see free-agency come
about in college athletics and all
kinds of things that go on in pro
fessional athletics. I think if you
restrict movement of college
athletes by national legislation,
you'll have a problem.
Daily: If a player wasn't being
offered $150,(XX) right off the
hat or if he knew that he had to
complete four years of college
even though he might have de
veloped to pro caliber after two,
wouldn't he then try to find
what was intrinsically valuable
about being a student-athlete?
Geiger: Why is the Ralph
Sampson phenomenon any dif
ferent from the John McEnroe
phenomenon (McEnroe, now
the No. 2 ranked tennis player
in the world, played tennis at
Stanford durring his freshman
year and then dropped out of
school to play professionally.)?
It's perfectly all right, it seems
to me, for John to make the de
cision he made. I frankly don't
think that he used Stanford, and
I don't think Stanford used him.
I think it was just an opportunity
that exists in the world today —
that he could go out and make
his fortune playing tennis. His
year here was good for him and
good for Stanford. I think we
make too much of the protection
of the institution and the protec
tion of the player. John made a
rational and informed decision
— he certainly had advice — and
I don't think we need protection
for the Ralph Sampsons of this
world.
If athletics can't survive that
sort of thing, then I don't think
those athletics are very sound.
In other words. I think that if
Stanford is doing an effective
job with its athletic program —
if we're getting quality people in
both academic and athletic
terms — then what happens in
that regard happens and there
ought not be rigid controls. If
there is a hardship case and a
player elects to make his for
tune in professional athletics,
how can we say that a Magic
Johnson (who left Michigan
State after his NCAA-tour
nament-winning sophomore
year to join the Los Angeles
Lakers) is wrong?
