# Fritsch kicks Oilers to victory
## 
### 
Houston (AP) — Toni Fritsch redeemed
himself with second-half field goals of 37 and 33
yards as the Houston Oilers scored a 6-0 National
Football League victory over turnover-prone Pit
tsburgh last night, and all but wrote an end to the
playoff hopes of the defending champion Steelers.
Pittsburgh, giving the ball away five costly
times — three on Terrv Bradshaw interceptions,
twice on Franco Harris fumbles — fell to 8-6 as its
hopes of a fifth Super Bowl ring ("One for the
Thumb in '81") were virtually crushed by the
Oilers' swarming defense.
Houston had lost the past two American Con
ference championship games to the Steelers and,
after knocking on the door twice, had vowed to
kick it in this year. It raised its record to 9-5, one
half game behind first-place Cleveland in the
AFC's Central Division.
It was the Browns who, last Sunday, had
knocked the Oilers out of a tie for first with a 17-14
victory, built, in part, on Fritsch's miss of a rou
tine 38-yard field goal attempt.
*This time, though, the chunky Austrian was
perfect on the only attempts he made while Matt

Bahr, the Steelers' kicker, missed on his only try
when a 42-yarder with 5:03 to play sailed wide to
the right.
They had one more chance, but with 2:00 to
play. Bradshaw faded back from his own 44-yard
line, on third-and-10. and threw his final intercep
tion. the second one picked off by free safety Mike
Reinfeldt.
i
It was Reinfeldt's first interception that killed
the Steelers' only serious touchdown chance of the
game and set in motion the drive that was cul
minated by the only points the Oilers needed.
Pittsburgh took the second-half kickoff and,
helped enormously by two penalties against cor
nerback J.C. Wilson, stormed to the Houston 1-
yard line.
From the 1, Harris tried the middle. He was
stopped — and an illegal motion penalty against
tight end Randy Grossman cost the Steelers five
yards to the 6.
Then Bradshaw tried to pass for a score. He
scrambled to his left, threw back against the
grain towards Theo Bell, but it was right into Re
infeldt's numbers for the end-zone interception.
