# Wyoming beats up Card cagers, 73-51
## 
### 
Enduring what coach Dick Dißiaso termed as the worst
physical beating the Cardinals have suffered in his six sea
sons here, Stanford, lost to Wyoming last night. 73-51, in the
Cowboys' gym at Laramie.
The bigger, stronger Cowboys outrebounded Stanford
58-41. Wyoming particularly displayed its dominance on the
offensive boards. The hosts' 23 offensive rebounds prompted
Dißiaso to comment, "I don't ever recall being physically
beaten on the boards like that since I've been at Stanford."
To worsen matters, the Cards shot abysmally: 15-for-51
(29.4 percent) from the field, only 21-of-35 from the free
throw line.
Because the Cards failed to find the range with its outside
shots and received such a pounding from Wyoming's big men.
it was imperative that they succeed with their free-throw
opportunities so they could score somehow.
But because of Stanford's inaccurate foul shooting,
Dißiaso said. Wyoming was able to run rampant on the Cards.
"It becomes a license to kill," the coach stated.
The Cards lacked a well-rounded offensive attack. Their
four guards — Doug Marty, Terry Smith. Roger Lemons and
Keith Jones — did not score a single basket in the first half.
Wyoming's dominance was so thorough that the Cards nev
er led. Stanford trailed 6-5 in the early going when the Cow
boys went on a 16-4 spurt that thrust them to a 22-9 lead with
8:58 left in the first half.
Marty led the Card scorers with 11 points, all in the second
half. Forward Brian Welch added 10 points and eight re
bounds, and freshman John Revelli contributed 10 points and
seven rebounds.
For Wyoming, forward Bill Garnett poured in 23 points on
10-for-14 shooting and ripped eight rebounds. Teammate Ken
neth Ollie added 12 points, 12 rebounds and four assists.
The Cards travel to Milwaukee to play Marquette tomor
row.
