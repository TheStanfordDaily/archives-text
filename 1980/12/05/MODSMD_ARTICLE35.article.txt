### Cindi Wheeler 
Looking for that unique
Christmas present? Check out
the Stanford Authors " Recent
Arrivals" table in the Book
store! You'll find there what
will probably be collector's
items in the future: auto
graphed copies of the newest
titles by illustrious Stanford
personalities.
The table currently carries
books such as Three Mile Is
land, an hour-by-hour account
of the incident, by Mark Ste
phens. a staff member on the
presidential committee that in
vestigated the accident and
presently a member of Stan
ford's Journalism School;
Cranston, the biography of the
Senator by his sister, Eleanor
Fowle; Palace Politics: An In
side Account of the Ford Years,
a product of the Hoover In
stitution by one of Ford's closest
personal aides, Robert
Hartman; and Orwell: the
Transformation, a biography of
the writer by Peter Stansky, as
sociate professor of History
here and William Abrahams.
According to Carolyn
McKnight. head of the General
Book section, the authors of
these books are often personal
friends "who love to auto
graph,'' Autographs give the

books " a personal touch,'' said
McKnight, and the books do sell
— "people love them "
The Bookstore tries to repre
sent as many Stanford authors
as possible, said McKnight, by
sending a newsletter asking the
faculty to inform them of new
publications. This promotes
positive lines of communication
between the Bookstore and the
faculty which "shows them
were interested," remarked
McKnight.
She emphasized that the
Bookstore works on getting the
autographed copies on their own
instead of through publishers.
For example, after Irvin
Yalom. professor of Psychiatry
at the Med School called the
Bookstore about his new book.
Fx ist en tial Psyc hot hera py,
(presently on the table), they
took several copies over to his
office to be autographed. "They
all sold," said McKnight.
Two more autographed titles
on the table are Ask Me Now, a
contemporary novel by A 1
Young, who teaches creative
writing here; and Conrad in the
19th Century, by lan Watt
(Jackson Eli Reynolds pro
fessor of Humanities), which is.
according to the book's jacket,
the fullest available account of
the author's early literarv ca

reer.
Another noteworthy title on
the table included is The Die
Song, by Donald Lunde
(clinical assistant professor of
Psychiatry and lecturer in Law,
who also worked on the Hillside
strangler case), and Jefferson
Morgan (formerly a professor
of journalism fellow, who now
freelances). The book is billed
as "a journey into the mind of a
mass murderer,'" Herber Wil
liam Mullin, who committed
thirteen savage murders in
Northern California.
Economic Democracy: The
Challenge of the 19HO's, by
Martin Carnoy, professor of
Education and Economics and
Derek Shearer explores pos
sible structural reforms of the
nation's economy; The Berlin
Succession: fyfodernism and its
Enemies in Imperial (iermany,
is a look at the pre-1914 segment
of German history in which poli
tics and art interacted, by Peter
Paret, professor of Interna
tional History; and the Pulitzer
prize winner At Odds: Women
and the Family in America from
the Revolution to the Present by
Carl Degler, which is the
first general history of women
in America.
For those interested in sci
ence, (Iregorv Rateson: Legacy

of a Scientist is the biography of
the tamed Stanford developer of
the double bind theory of
schizophrenia bv David Lipset,
who studied with the an
thropologist and social scien
tist. For literature buffs, Eng
lish Romantic Irony bv Anne
Mellor, professor of English Lit
erature may help lead to a bet
ter understanding of Romantic
writing with new interpreta
tions of the works of Byron.
Keats, Carlyle, and Coleridge
Finally, The Pugnacious
Residents by Thomas Baily,
Byrne professor emeritus and
major authority on U.S. history
offers a "no-holds barred ac
count of how presidents have
faced up to war and the threat of
it."
In closing. McKnight men
tioned that the book Stanford:
From the Foothills to the Bay
has made the bestseller lists,
and according to McKnight, is
selling better than she ever ex
pected.
So. as Christmas approaches,
remember the selection that the
Bookstore has to offer of Stan
ford authors: compared to the
cost of tuition to attend their
classes, you can't beat the
price!

Finally, The Pugnacious
Residents by Thomas Baily,
Byrne professor emeritus and
major authority on U.S. history
offers a "no-holds barred ac
count of how presidents have
faced up to war and the threat of
it."
In closing. McKnight men
tioned that the book Stanford:
From the Foothills to the Bay
has made the bestseller lists,
and according to McKnight, is
selling better than she ever ex
pected.
So. as Christmas approaches,
remember the selection that the
Bookstore has to offer of Stan
ford authors: compared to the
cost of tuition to attend their
classes, you can't beat the
price!
Looking for that unique
Christmas present? Check out
the Stanford Authors " Recent
Arrivals" table in the Book
store! You'll find there what
will probably be collector's
items in the future: auto
graphed copies of the newest
titles by illustrious Stanford
personalities.
The table currently carries
books such as Three Mile Is
land, an hour-by-hour account
of the incident, by Mark Ste
phens. a staff member on the
presidential committee that in
vestigated the accident and
presently a member of Stan
ford's Journalism School;
Cranston, the biography of the
Senator by his sister, Eleanor
Fowle; Palace Politics: An In
side Account of the Ford Years,
a product of the Hoover In
stitution by one of Ford's closest
personal aides, Robert
Hartman; and Orwell: the
Transformation, a biography of
the writer by Peter Stansky, as
sociate professor of History
here and William Abrahams.
According to Carolyn
McKnight. head of the General
Book section, the authors of
these books are often personal
friends "who love to auto
graph,'' Autographs give the

books " a personal touch,'' said
McKnight, and the books do sell
— "people love them "
The Bookstore tries to repre
sent as many Stanford authors
as possible, said McKnight, by
sending a newsletter asking the
faculty to inform them of new
publications. This promotes
positive lines of communication
between the Bookstore and the
faculty which "shows them
were interested," remarked
McKnight.
She emphasized that the
Bookstore works on getting the
autographed copies on their own
instead of through publishers.
For example, after Irvin
Yalom. professor of Psychiatry
at the Med School called the
Bookstore about his new book.
Fx ist en tial Psyc hot hera py,
(presently on the table), they
took several copies over to his
office to be autographed. "They
all sold," said McKnight.
Two more autographed titles
on the table are Ask Me Now, a
contemporary novel by A 1
Young, who teaches creative
writing here; and Conrad in the
19th Century, by lan Watt
(Jackson Eli Reynolds pro
fessor of Humanities), which is.
according to the book's jacket,
the fullest available account of
the author's early literarv ca

reer.
Another noteworthy title on
the table included is The Die
Song, by Donald Lunde
(clinical assistant professor of
Psychiatry and lecturer in Law,
who also worked on the Hillside
strangler case), and Jefferson
Morgan (formerly a professor
of journalism fellow, who now
freelances). The book is billed
as "a journey into the mind of a
mass murderer,'" Herber Wil
liam Mullin, who committed
thirteen savage murders in
Northern California.
Economic Democracy: The
Challenge of the 19HO's, by
Martin Carnoy, professor of
Education and Economics and
Derek Shearer explores pos
sible structural reforms of the
nation's economy; The Berlin

Enemies in Imperial (iermany,
