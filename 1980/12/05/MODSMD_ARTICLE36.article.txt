Where did the '60s songsters
such as Bob Dylan and Joan
Baez get their inspiration? Was
their music a product of the
times? The '60s revolution
seems in retrospect to have
been the product of many years
of social turmoil with many for
gotten influences. One of the
most important musical in
fluences of the era is a man that
we have almost forgotten — the
Oklahoma vagabond, Woody
Guthrie.
Woody's protests began in the
'30s with hit songs about the
plight of the Okies. Later, he
sang against discrimination,
World War II and then later, for
the war cause. It was Woody
who Bob Dylan chose to mimic
when he started singing in col
lege. Woody Guthrie was one of
the first to effectively use his
music for protest, resulting in
his status as a legendary hero.
Joe Klein dissects that leg
end. carefully exposing the
many myths associated with
Guthrie. This is the first bio
graphy revealing the life of the
folk hero because his first wife
Marjorie has just recently
agreed to the publication of her
personal relationship with
Woody.
In Woody (iu.thrie, Klein
shows us a childish, ir
responsible —often drunk and

dirtv—and extremely moody
man. Klein shows us all of
Woody. Instead of the roman
iticized hero of the movie
Hound for Glory, we see a
man who spends much of his
time begging forgiveness for his
various verbal and physical
rampages.

Klein tries to show us the rea
sons for Woody's behavior by
tracing a well-researched
portrayal of his childhood, his
life with his musician friends
like Pete Seeger and Cisco
Houston and his life with each of
his three wives. Woody's tem
pestous childhood was domi
nated by his mother: a mentally
disturbed woman who allegedly
caused the death of his sister by
burning, and set his father on
fire after dousing him with
kerosine. In an uncannily
grotesque set of coincidences,

Woody's first child is burned
and he severely burns his arm.
Klein's use of various his
torical facts completes the pic
ture of Guthrie and places his
biography in a musical and po
litical perspective. Specifically
featured are inclusions of early
Oklahoma, the history of the
Communist party (with which
Guthrie was closely associated
with), and an especially per
tinent section devoted to the his
tory of folk music. (Klein cur
rently writes for Rolling Stone.)
With this historical background,
Klein creates a backdrop tohelp
explain some of Woody's actions
—why his Communist affilia
tion was a natural thing for him
— and to show how revolu
tionary some of his ideas could
be.
Woody's radicalism con
tributed to his legend, but his
image as a "dusty little man
wandering around the country
with a guitar slung over his
shoulder " glorified the legend
ary character. "It wa's a pow
erful, romantic image . . . cen
tral to the mythology of the gen
erafron of radicals coming of
age," says Klein.
The legend of the singing hobo
who taught the lowly how to sing
out their emotions was one that
influenced a host of musicians.
During Woody's later years
when he lived in a New Jersey
rest home, many of these musi
cians visited their hero. The
road to fame as a folk star
seemed to demand a stop along

the way to pay homage to
Guthrie, who had already been
there. s
Klein attributes Woody's de
sire to wander to his affliction
with Huntington's disease. The
tragic, heriditary disease slow
ly deteriorates the brain cells
often resulting in behavioral
disorders. Just how much of
Woody's behavior is connected
with the disease is difficult to
determine.
Woody died in 1967 from Hunt
ington's disease. At the time of
his death, he was finally achiev
ing commercial success
through the sale of books, re
cords and songs like "This
Land." A concert com
memorating the folk hero was
staged in Carnegie Hall where
Bob Dylan sang an angry ver
sion of "I Ain't Got No Home in
this World Anymore."
Guthrie's history is practical
ly inseparable from that of folk
music, but his influence goes far
beyond it. His story is essential
to understand the protest of the
'60s and the musicians who pro
duced it. Joe Klein's biography
of Guthrie fills in a crucial gap
in the history of American mu
sic.
Ev 'rybody might be just one big
soul.
Well it looks that-a way to me
Everywhere that you look in the
day or night
That's where I'm gonna be, ma.
That's where I'm gonna be.'
"Tom Joad" by Woody Guthrie
