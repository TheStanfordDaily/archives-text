Albert Eisenstaedt
Penguin Books
348 pp. $14.95

If the old sage "a picture is
worth a thousand words,"
holds true, then Alfred Ei
senstaedt's Witness to Our
Time, is worth 442,000.
Words that is. Because at
last count, this visual diary
contained approximately 442
pictures. If you can demote
the visual murals he cap
tures to the common word
picture.
This collection of photo
graphs is the living definition
of the word photojournalism,
the art of documenting the
news through the lens of a
camera with the same ethics
that apply to print journal
ism: objective coverage of
the news. Though words like
poignant, devastating, stoic
and delightful are all adjec
tives I'd unhesitatingly
choose to describe the scenes
captured in this marvelous
volume, there is a pro
fessional distance present in
every single picture. We see
the subject, not the photogra
pher's idea of the subject.
The value of the book is its
incredible journey through
the historical events that
shaped this century. Eisen
staedt was there to frame the

first meeting between Hitler
and Mussolini; to expose the
voluptousness of Sophia
Loren; to witness the hyster
ics of Ernest Hemingway; to
dignify the farewells of sol
diers and their girls at the
WWII train stations; he
leaves virtually no aspect of
society—whether that socie
ty be European or American
or African—untouched or un
noticed.
Just skimming through the
list of chapter titles creates a
respect for the incredible
spectrum of time and people
that Eisenstaedt has tracked
down and conquered through
the simple eye of the cam
era. From the "Echoes of
World War I," to "The Rise
of the Dictators," through
"The United States: The
Great Depression," around a
host of European portfolios,
we are ushered through a
gallery of famous person
alities. famous places and fa
mous politics that headlines
and broadcasts could not
hope to display in such in
credibly human dimensions.
The editing of this 300
pages plus potpourri is su
perb. One of the most dra
matic set of pages places the
almost sculptured face of a
nun directly across from a
rabbi and his students study
ing the Torah in Jerusalem.
The simple, yet powerful
coupling of two individual

pictures becomes a
statement in and of itself. A
similar layout compares the
vivid poverty of a slum in
Naples with an opulent six
teenth century palace oc
cupied by two Italian
citizens. It is with these
simple snapshots that Eisen
staedt travels the sidewalks
of the human race.
Eisenstaedt is most re
nowned for his work on Life,
a tenure that yielded 1728 pic
ture-stories for the maga
zine. It was through this ex
perience that he was honored
with the title, "The father of
photojournalism." a title ex
ponentially appreciated with
each turn of the page in the
book.
The only criticism 1 might
offer is that Eisenstaedt
rarely gives the caption
much attention, leaving little
room for the anecdotes
which are certainly as in
teresting as the subject
itself. Many of the photo
graphs are merely identi
fied. When he does choose to
share a memory or im
pression. it serves to ac
cenuate the visual dimension
even further.
I could use 1000 words to go
on and on about how terrific
the book is. but then I too
learned a lesson about words
from all the pictures. So, I'd
suggest vou go see it your
self!!

and Mussolini; to expose the
voluptousness of Sophia
Loren; to witness the hyster
ics of Ernest Hemingway; to
dignify the farewells of sol
diers and their girls at the
WWII train stations; he
leaves virtually no aspect of
society—whether that socie
ty be European or American
or African—untouched or un
noticed.
Just skimming through the
list of chapter titles creates a
respect for the incredible
spectrum of time and people
that Eisenstaedt has tracked
down and conquered through
the simple eye of the cam
era. From the "Echoes of
World War I," to "The Rise
of the Dictators," through
"The United States: The
Great Depression," around a
host of European portfolios,
we are ushered through a
gallery of famous person
alities. famous places and fa
mous politics that headlines
and broadcasts could not
hope to display in such in
credibly human dimensions.
The editing of this 300
pages plus potpourri is su
perb. One of the most dra
matic set of pages places the
almost sculptured face of a
nun directly across from a
rabbi and his students study
ing the Torah in Jerusalem.
The simple, yet powerful
coupling of two individual

pictures becomes a
statement in and of itself. A
similar layout compares the
vivid poverty of a slum in
Naples with an opulent six
teenth century palace oc
cupied by two Italian
citizens. It is with these
simple snapshots that Eisen
staedt travels the sidewalks
of the human race.
Eisenstaedt is most re
nowned for his work on Life,
a tenure that yielded 1728 pic
ture-stories for the maga
zine. It was through this ex
perience that he was honored
with the title, "The father of
photojournalism." a title ex
ponentially appreciated with
each turn of the page in the
book.
The only criticism 1 might
offer is that Eisenstaedt
rarely gives the caption
much attention, leaving little
room for the anecdotes
which are certainly as in
teresting as the subject
itself. Many of the photo
graphs are merely identi
fied. When he does choose to
share a memory or im
pression. it serves to ac
cenuate the visual dimension
even further.
I could use 1000 words to go
on and on about how terrific
the book is. but then I too
learned a lesson about words
from all the pictures. So, I'd
suggest vou go see it your
self!!


Alfred Eisenstaedt
