Lolita ****
New Varsity, Palo Alto
It may not be Nabokov, but
Lolita has its ovfrn delights. James
Mason stars as Humbert Hum
bert, a man who's driven to dis
traction — and rrfbre — by his irra
tional infatuation with a teenager.
Sue Lyon is a little too old to prop
erly be called a "nvmphet," but
she wasn t as miscast as some
critics at the time ol the 1 ilinre
lease (a much-less permissive
1962i took her to be. Director
Stanley Kubrick managed to find a
flame beneath her pouty exterior,
and she makes a striking, min
iature predator Peter Sellers,
adopting an American accent,
plays Quilty. an alarming egotist
and hack novelist who wrecks
Humbert's well-laid schemes
when he. too. becomes obsessed
with Lolita. And even Shelley Win
ters turns in a fine performance as
Lolita s mother, in a wonderfully
grotesque caricature of small
town sophistication.
Plays Monday night with The
World of Henry Orient.
— Jim Mattson
Ordinary People **
Palo Alto Square
This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you re there to really learn some
thing. The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other.
Director Hobert Bedford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture. Timothy Button's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Button's mother But this
about a family never makes yojfi
feel that you ve really captured
the family's heart and soul -its
guts.

The Stunt Man ★★★★,' y
Old Mill. Mountain View
It's the old theme of reality vs.
illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new director,
Hit-hard Rush, rejferses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movfies. Peter O'Toole
gives an imaginative, self-de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks,
and Steve Railsback plays the
stunt man. The cast also includes
Allen Goorwitz (who used to be
called Allen Garfield) in another
good performance (as a
screenwriter) and Barbara
llershey (who used to be called-
Barbara Hershey Seagull).
— Steve Vineberg

The Gay Divorcee ****
Festival Cinema. Palo Alto
The musicals Fred Astaire and
Ginger Bogers made together are
sulfused with a special kind of
magic The pair possessed
elegance, and wit; they also had
the rare radiance of talented peo
ple'engaged in a labor they loved.
The (ray Divorcee (based on a
stage play called The Gay
Divorce; the title was changed
when the censor maintained that,
while a divorcee might con
ceivamt be gay. a divorce most
certainly could not) has a feather
weight story that is typical of the
series. The dance routines are
what matters lor once, Holly
wood's priorities were in the right
place.
Kdward Kverett Horton is tea
lured. Plays through Wednesday
with another Astaire and Bogers
movie. Shall We Dance.

Close Encounters of the Third
Kind ★★★*
New Varsity. Halo Alto
Steven Spielberg recut his 1977
science-fantasy, removing cum
bersome sections and adding new
footage. There's more to the mov
ie's ending, now, but the two most
striking additions are one scene
and a single shot. In the new scene.
Dreyfuss explains how he grew up
with Disney's Pinocchiv and we
begin to get a sense of the film's
narrative roots. The new shot,
very brief and telling, shows the
great shadow of a spacecraft wed
ding the fantastic and the com
monplace as it glides over Indiana
farmlands. A terrifjc movie.
Plays Saturday and Sunday with
The Incredible Shrinking Man.

Meet Me in St. Louit ****
Monday, Kresge
Vincente Minnelli (An Ameri
can in Paris, The Band Wagon)
directed this charming Techni
color musical set at the turn of the
century. Minnelli. at his best, was
able to make a film that was un
abashedly sentimental without
being soit at at its center. Meet
Me in St. Louis's visual prettiness
is supported by a lovely score —
•The Trolley Song:" "The Boy
Next boor;' ' Have Yourself a
Merry Little Christmas" — and
some fine performances. The
large cast includes Judy Garland,
never more attractive than here,
and child-star Margaret O'Brien,
who. in a Halloween sequence, re
minds us how truly frightening the
holiday can be.
This is a vision of a St. Louis,
•and an America, that probably
never existed; Minnelli s talent is
tor making us wish it had
-- J.M.

10 ★★★
Sunday. Mem Aud
The sexist ad campaign has
misled many people about this
movie; if you're looking for a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you. Writer
director Blake Edwards values
are. for lack of a better word,
straight, and this comedy about
male mid-life crises probably
won't please those Who enjoyed
watching females get-conquered.
As an over-40 songwriter Dudley
Moore is an ingratiating bum bier,
and Edwards' gives the rest ol the
cast more than enough depth to get
by. Except for Bo Derek, that is.
This poster-star just may have
found her niche as the vacuous
"10" the title refers to.
— R.L.

Bye Bye Bra*H ***
Aquarius. Palo Alto
This Brazilian import, directed
bv Carlos Diegues, is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a

carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
Ipitrn in the Brazilian backlands.
'•♦she troupe can offer nothing to
' Anyone: they re neither cvncial
< enough to compete with the new
entertainment, TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from
them. The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
survive. Director Diegues does a
line job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.
—J.M.
The World of Henry Orient *
New Varsity, Palo Alto
Peter Sellers has a few price
less moments as an amorous con

ductor being chased by a pair of
obnoxious adolescents (Tippi
Walker and Merri Spaeth >. but the
movie spends far too little time
with Sellers and far too much with
the girls. Growing pains have rare
ly been so boring. George Hoy Hill
directed, barely serviceably.
Plavs Monday night only.

movie is a big budgeted "Perils of
(ioldie:" Mawn plays a no-nothing
rich girl who loses her husband,
meets the reality of the army,

lie stumbles badlv when the movie

— R.L.
The Elephant Man ★ ★★★
Park. Menlo Park
Director David Lynch does a
masterful job in his first major
film, another version of the now
familiar story of John Merrick.
"The Elephant Man." Lynch
avoids exploiting Merrick's de
formities for shock value, and
John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to
convey the dignity with which
Merrick comports himself despite
his illness. Not a horror story, but
a moving tale of human love and
compassion battling our fear of the
unknown
— Tom Taylor
Urban Cou-hoy **
Menlo. Menlo Park
Urban Cowboy's main charac
ter is (iilley's, a redneck bar in
Houston, (iilley's is a harbor for
macho dreams, a haven for the
lonely and unlucky in love.
The film's human characters

aren "tjpo richly tleshed out. The
narrative is so dry and restrained
that we never get an idea ot what
drives these people, we can feel
the bar s smoky allure, but never
feels what drives John Travolta
and Debra Winger into, and out of.

the Empire Strikes Back **
Old Mill, Mountain View
The special effects are even
more spectacular than before, but
this sequel to Star Wars has lost
most of its sense of humor. Every
thing has become deadly serious
bigger, brighter, splashier, and
dull^i
All the o!H performers are back,
but the best performance is given
by a green-skinned muppet
creature that, lor an instant, man
ages to instill a sense of magic ana'
expectation. The biggest letdown
of all is the movie's ending—
jeepers, George. couldn't you
come up with something better
than that after three years of
work ?

2001: A Space Odysxey ★
Old Mill. Mountain View
An evolutionary primer, or:
Hou I Learned to Stop Worry ing
and Love Cosmic Mutation.
Stanley Kubrick s rewrite of the
Book of Revelation finds mankind
ready to make a great leap for
ward What we're leaping from is,
in Kubrick's vision, particularly
bleak His characters are engulfed
in technology that makes life com
fortable and boring. Surrounded
by the splendours of space, they
seem drained and vacant: they've
carried the work ethic out between
the planets Here, space must turn
seductress — humankind meets its
greater fate only through the kind
ness of strangers.
With Keir Dullea. Gary
Lockwood and a computer named
Hal. Late show tonight and tomor
row night

The Kids Are Alright ***
Old Mill, Mountain View
The Kids Ar»' Alright is like an
erector set married to a time ma
chine—as the years tick by we see
the hallmarks of a pop
phenomenon being bolted into
place This chronicle of the long,
successful life ot The Who is a
compilation of concert tootage and
interviews -much of it trans
ferred from videotape—made
over a 10-year span What sets this
movie apart from other concert
flicks, and what makes it interest
ing even to those who don t know
all the words from "Long Live
Hock by heart, is that it ultimate
ly becomes an examination of the
creation ot a public image. Which
came first: our generation or The
Who!
Late show this weekend.

Divine Madness *★
Guild. Menlo Park
One of the better concert films
I 've seen, but I still can't quite get
into 90 minutes of less-than-live
entertainment nans plot. Bette
Midler shakes her boobs, performs
illicit sexual acts with her micro
phone. and even sings a song or
two during the performance.
I limed live at the Pasadena Civic
Auditorium. If you re heavily into
noses, this is your film; otherwise,
try something else.
— Mike Charlson
From Russia With Love **
Saturday. Cubberley
The second Bond movie with
Sean Connery: though it had a
higher budget than the first. Dr.
Vo, its share of wit and excite
ment is decidedly smaller. In this
one. Bond" gets mixed up with a
beautitul lady Russian agent (I
know that's sexist — but this is a
Bond film i and nearly gets snuffed
by mean bitch Russian Lotfe
Lenya. We all know who will end
up where; the only question is how
soon and with what method of vio
lence.
Plays tomorrow night, not two
weeks ago, as was originally re
ported in this column.

Airplane **
Fox, Redwood City
From most of the people who
brought you Kentucky Fried Mov
ie comes this disappointing and
largely unfunny parody of disaster
films. There are about a million
and a half jokes in this one; un
fortunately. only about eight or
nine of them are funny. Peter
(iraves, Kareem Abdul-Jabaar
and a host of non-comedians are
the non-stars.
Plays tonight and tomorrow,
with Up in Smoke.
