West cautions Soviets on Polish crisis
Warsaw — A Communist Party Central Committee
member raised for the first time yesterday the possibility
of a request for Soviet assistance in the Polish crisis, and
Western nations warned the Soviet Union against military
intervention.
Josef Klasa. head of Central Committee's press depart
ment, told a news conference the Polish leadership would
ask for Soviet and Warsaw Pact help if authority "slipped
into the hands of anti-socialist elements" or if "socialism
became endangered." But he said it would be imprudent to
try to solve the country's problems "with the help of mili
tary forces," and he believed Poland would resolve the
crisis by itself.
In Moscow, there were accusations that the West was
attempting to increase tension in Poland.
,A day after President Jimmy Carter spoke of an "un
precedented buildup" of Soviet forces along the Polish
border, the Carter administration cautioned Moscow that
Americans were united in their concern over the possi
bility of a Soviet intervention.
It was the third straight day that the Carter adminis
tration had issued warnings to the Soviets that the United
States is greatly concerned that there be no outside in
tcference in Polish affairs.

But intelligence analysts and other officials, while re
luctant to dispute Carter, suggested in private that Carter
may have overstated the buildup Still, they agreed that it
is potentially very serious.
"We are significantly more concerned than four or five
days ago." said another senior official who also declined to
be identified.
But some analysts believe that only about two or three
days of final preparations, which could be detected by
Western intelligence, would precede any invasion.
Syria to pull back from Jordan border
Damascus, Syria — A Saudi Arabian mediator reported
yesterday that Syria had agreed to withdraw gradually its
troops and tanks along the border with Jordan, according
to the Saudi news agency. This was seen as defusing at
least temporarily the threat of a second war in the Middle
East.
The second deputy premier of Saudi Arabia. Prince Ab
dullah bin Abdul-Aziz, made the statement after returning
to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, at the end of a four-day medi
ation shuttle between Damascus and Amman, the Saudi
news agency said.
Syrian Information Minister Ahmed Iskandar Ahmed
made comments that observers took to mean Syria had

achieved its objectives and there would be no need to
maintain the military buildup.
Although details of the reported agreement were not re
vealed. Syrian observers said they expected President
Hafez Assad to issue orders soon to withdraw Syrian
troops gradually from the border area.
A spokesman for Hussein's government in Amman said
Jordan had not been informed officially of the reported
withdrawal pledge
Oil glut drives stock market down
New York — Oil issues led the stock market lower yes
terday as forecasts of continued high inflation, a world pe
troleum glut and tighter credit snuffed out a late attempt
to mount a rally.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up nearly 8
points at 2:30 p.m., closed off 1.79 at 970.48. Advances out
numbered declines 8-7 on the New York Stock Exchange
and Big Board volume swelled to 51.17 million shares from
43 43 million a day before.
