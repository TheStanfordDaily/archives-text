University officials last night pres
ented the draft of a revised land use
plan to Stanford's "neighbors" in an
attempt to obtain last-minute com
munity reaction before the Board of
Trustees reviews the draft and votes
to adopt the land use policy at its De
cember 9 meeting.
The presentation, handled mainly
by Vice-President for Business and Fi
nance William Massy and Director of
Planning Phil Williams, featured a re
view of the land use policy, maps il
lustrating possible land uses five and
30 years in the future and Some dis
cussion of the environmental aspects
of University properties.
The policy statement calls for plan
ning "in a manner consistent with the
characteristics of Stanford as a resi
dential teaching and research Univer
sity."
"We have an obligation to per
petually protect lands for future
academic possibilities," Massy
stressed.
The report mentioned specific
projects planned for development in
the next five years, including a new
music department building, addi

tional development at the Medical
Center, the 800-bed complex for stu
dents on the west shore of Lake
Lagunita. expansion of faculty hous
ing on Peter Coutts Hill, and extension
of Campus Drive, among others.
The 30-year land use plan outlines
possible planning changes including a
single student housing expansion to
surround Lake Lagunita, several
potential sites for faculty housing, and
development of a 46-acre site along
Willow Road which may provide up to
1600 units of additional housing for
"faculty, staff, other families em
ployed on Stanford lands and for addi
tional community needs." the draft
stated.
About 50 concerned community res
idents attended the meeting in Kresge
Auditorium, a somewhat smaller
turn-out than University officials had
expected.
However, several in attendance
voiced strong opinions as to Stanford's
land use policy.
Menlo Park resident Lorraine
Downing said she was "sensitive to
the over-development of Stanford
land." adding that "academic goals
are splendid but not at the expense of

our land." Downing said she would op
pose University attempts at develop
ing the 46 acres off Willow Road and
the Guernsey Field area, "by all avail
able methods, including a lawsuit. "
Other concerns voiced by members
of the audience included reaction to a
proviso in the land use policy which
states "open space contracts to re
duce the University's property tax
costs will be considered."
Nan Wideman of the "Committee
for Green Foothills," said she sup
ported the assertions of some other
audience members that the Univer
sity was "undervaluing the im
portance of open space to students and
faculty," and urged the University to
develop a "clear and positive policy"
toward the subject.
Massy said the provision referred
only to third-party contracts and said
the University did not. in fact, dis
count the importance of the open
lands.
Much of the audience concern
seemed to be regarding the proposed
development of the 46 acres adjacent
to Willow Road, especially the traffic
