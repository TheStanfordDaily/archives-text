# Grad students upset over housing
## 
### Seth Zuckerman 
The announcement of proposed rent
increases for all University-owned
student housing has sparked renewed
debate over the accommodations the
University provides for graduate stu
dents.
The Escondido Village Council

Wednesday called a protest meeting
for Jan 8 about the graduate housing
situation, and six graduate ASSU sen
ators and two past presidents of the
village council released a public
statement objecting to the lack of
plans for new, permanent graduate
housing.
Many graduates have expressed dis
satisfaction that the University is ask
ing them to pay for new under
graduate housing without making con
crete plans to create any additional
permanent graduate housing. Current
scenarios call for 800 undergraduates
to move into a new dorm near
Lagunita Court beginning in 1982-83
and the simultaneous conversion of
the "temporary" housing in Man
zanita Park's trailers to graduate
housing.

Ye its analysis

"Our concern would dissipate if
there were a commitment to future
permanent graduate housing," said
Bill Cocke, president of the Escondido
Village Council. Then graduate stu
dents would pay for undergraduate
housing initially, and later on, the
roles would be reversed, he said.
"There is no disagreement about
paying for undergraduate housing."
he added.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem

ber Dick Butterfield supported Cocke.
"The University lacks a plan and a
time-frame for permanent graduate
housing.'' he said, adding that partial
integration of graduates and under
graduates should be considered as a
possible solution until new permanent
graduate housing can be built.
Other concerns, according to the
protest resolution the council adopted,
are "the possibility that Escondido
rents will be based on surrounding
market rates' rather than on costs to
the University" and the 15 percent
rent increase that has been proposed
to the Board of Trustees.
But Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said the appropriate amount to
allocate to new housing will grow as
long as the University wants to build
more. The University may charge
more than it costs to operate student
housing, but less than the dwellings'
fair market value. This is meant to fi
nance future, below-market-value
housing, since the higher rents will
enable the University to provide
cheaper housing for future students.
Lyons said there is nothing in cur
rent Residential Education
philosophy to prevent graduate stu
dents from being housed in the new
dormitory with undergraduates. He
added that the University is looking at
the housing needs of undergraduates
and graduates and the housing actual
ly provided, and recognizes that the
divisions in accommodations may not
correspond to the current allocations.
