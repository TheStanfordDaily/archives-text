# Deficit of $3.2 million feared
## University fends off red-ink budget 
### Kimberly Brown 
The University's immediate budget
goal for next year is to break even with
an operating budget of nearly $140 mil
lion. acting Provost Albert Hastorf
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In a page-by-page explanation of
budget forecasts. Hastorf said the
final goal is to present a long-range
forecast based on present assump
tions.
Hastorf stressed the need to discuss
the various assumptions underlying
thr projection, which are all subject to
change, "before the cement sets too
firmly and they begin generating a
form of reality."
The forecast is based on an inflation
rate of 10.5 percent for the 1981-52
year Hastorf said, if anything, the es
timate is low rather than high, al
though he added that the Ronald Re
agan era shouldn't make much of a dif-

ference — a half-percent decrease at
best.
Projected expenses for the corning
year and future forecasts are all de
rived from the 10.5 percent inflation
figure.
Projected funding for faculty
salaries was estimated at an 11.5
percent inflation rate. The Additional
percentage point reflects the Univer
sity's concern to remain competitive
with salary levels at other institu
tions. according to University
sources.
"We must examine all possible
sources deans of the schools could use
to supplement" this figure, said
Hastorf. Salaries will vary as a func
tion of professors' merit and service,
he said.
Similarly, non-faculty staff salaries
— projected at a 12 percent inflation
rate — highlight the University's dif
ficulty competing with local in
dustries, said Hastorf.
William Massy, vice-president for
business and finance, said the Univer
sity is losing clerical workers every
day and has over 300 empty positions.
In addition to the 12 percent in
crease, increments of one to three
percent may be dealt out as well, in or
der to get the quality people needed,
he said. However, these increments
would be given very selectively, he
added.
10 increase by 35 percent, including
$710,000 to make up for extraordinary
increases since March 1980.
Hastorf reported this year's "real
growth" rate in academic programs

at 2.4 percent and last year's at 2.3
percent. He concluded the University
will not be able to tolerate the same
level of growth in the coming years.
Massy predicted dramatic changes,
especially in the consolidations and
improvements area. "We must take a
look at our services and decide which
we need and on what level we need
them." he said.
Noting the importance of new
academic programs like the Human
ities Center, he said funds must be
sliced from other areas in order to
make up for that expense.
According to Massy, the University
could face a $3.2 million deficit in
1982-83 at the present assumptions, if
corrective action is not taken. He at
tributed the possible gap to the "na
ture of the University's growth rate,"
adding that he senses a basic im
balance which is becoming more dif
ficult to deal with every year.
