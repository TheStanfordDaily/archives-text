# Tuition jump of 13.6 expected
## Student costs to break $10,000 mark 
### Seth Zuckerman 
The University yesterday recom
mended to the Board of Trustees tui
tion. room and board increases that
would put the total cost of attending
Stanford over $10,000.
The Board in the past has approved
recommended general tuition in
creases essentially unaltered.
The proposal would raise tuition to
$7140 per year or $2380 per quarter, an
increase of 13.6 percent over this
year's rate of $6285.
In discussing the increase. Assis
tant Provost Timothy Warner of the
Office of Management and Budget
said the tuition hike is necessary to
maintain the high quality of education
here, and specifically blamed the size
of the increase on the need to keep fac
ulty and staff salaries competitive
with other comparable institutions
and on a substantial rise in utility
rates.
"You're talking about an economy
where costs are driven by inflation
and an insistence on maintaining the
quality of education here," Warner

said.
We are not happy about the in
crease.' he said "It is the source of
income we sweat about the most, but
it is the only one we can push one way
or another."
Tuition for medical students who
first enrolled in 1979 or before would
increase from $6867 to $7805 per year,
and for medical students who came to
the University since then it would rise
irom $7338 to $8340 (up 13.65 percent).
Law students' tuition would go from
$6434 to $7290 per year (up 13.3
percent I and terminal graduate regis
tration (TOR) from $160 to $200 per
quarter
All rents would increase 15 percent,
to $1232 per year for self-operated
houses and $1291 for regular dorm
rooms, and a year's full board would
cost $1674. $161 (10.6 percent) more
than the $1513 currently charged.
This would bring the total rate for
tuition, room and board to $10,105.
The same increase would apply to
Escundido Village, resulting in a jump
from $261 to $300 per month for a one

bedroom family apartment
Director of Housing and Facilities
Ed Scoles said that the 15 percent
across-the-board increases in rent for
all University-owned student housing
would generate a $212,000 surplus next
year to help offset this year's
projected $315,000 deficit, a figure
that is $250,000 more than was
projected in last year's budget. Scoles
blamed this year's deficit in part on
utility costs rising half a million
dollars to $2.8 million The long-range
forecast for housing costs shows defi
cits totalling more than $1.5 million
from 1982-83 to 1984-85. which Scoles
attributed to the cost of the new dorm,
to be built near Lagunita Court.
Scoles said that deficit, much of
which will be covered from the hous
ing system's $1.5 million reserves,
made him reluctant "to dip into re
serves next year" — and hence the
small (1 percent of budget) planned
surplus.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon. asked whether he felt the
announced increases would affect the
number of applicants to Stanford or
the number of admittees who choose
to enroll, said. "I don't have anything
to support that conclusion at this
point, other than my general feeling
that it (the increase) is awfully high."
Hargadon said that two or three years
ago. in the wake of a tuition hike, his
office offered admission to more peo
ple than they had planned and was sad
dled with an unexpectedly large
freshman class because the rate of ad
mittee enrollment had not decreased.
Addressing the Faculty Senate yes
terday about the planned tuition in
crease. acting Provost Albert Hastorf

said, "it seems that if you've got quali
ty. people are willing to pay for it."
Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti said joint
Stanford-Ivy League studies have
shown that the University's tuition
level "is not a contributing factor, by
and large." to students' decisions on
colleges. He stressed the University's
policy of meeting all demonstrated fi
nancial need and the fact that 83
percent of students who turn Stanford
down go to other private institutions
as further evidence of that.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber Dick Butterfield did not contend
the need for the increases, but ex
pressed alarm at their possible conse
quences.
"The reaction of low-income people
is going to be Forget it! More than
$10,000"? I'm not even going to apply.'
Part of having a good financial aid pol
icy is making low-income applicants
aware of it."he said He added he has
evidence that people from inner cities
and lower income brackets are not
being adequately informed that Stan
ford is open to them and that if they
are qualified. Stanford will do every
thing it possibly can to enable them to
attend.
In the past. Stanford has been the
first major private college or univer
sity to announce its fees for the follow
ing year. Last year, the increases in
tuition, room and board for eight com
parison schools, mostly from the Ivy
League, were within lVfc percentage
points of Stanford's.
Tuition represents about 53 percent
of the University's operating budget, a
fraction that will decrease by less
than half a percentage point next year.

ago. in the wake of a tuition hike, his
office offered admission to more peo
ple than they had planned and was sad
dled with an unexpectedly large
freshman class because the rate of ad
mittee enrollment had not decreased.
Addressing the Faculty Senate yes

said, "it seems that if you've got quali

Vice Provost for Budget and Plan
ning Raymond Bacchetti said joint
Stanford-Ivy League studies have
shown that the University's tuition
level "is not a contributing factor, by
and large." to students' decisions on
colleges. He stressed the University's
policy of meeting all demonstrated fi
nancial need and the fact that 83
percent of students who turn Stanford
down go to other private institutions
as further evidence of that.
ASSU Council of Presidents mem
ber Dick Butterfield did not contend
the need for the increases, but ex
pressed alarm at their possible conse
quences.
"The reaction of low-income people
is going to be Forget it! More than
$10,000"? I'm not even going to apply.'
Part of having a good financial aid pol
icy is making low-income applicants
aware of it."he said He added he has
evidence that people from inner cities
and lower income brackets are not
being adequately informed that Stan
ford is open to them and that if they
are qualified. Stanford will do every
thing it possibly can to enable them to
attend.
In the past. Stanford has been the
first major private college or univer
sity to announce its fees for the follow
ing year. Last year, the increases in
tuition, room and board for eight com
parison schools, mostly from the Ivy
League, were within lVfc percentage
points of Stanford's.
Tuition represents about 53 percent
of the University's operating budget, a
fraction that will decrease by less
than half a percentage point next year.
The University yesterday recom
mended to the Board of Trustees tui
tion. room and board increases that
would put the total cost of attending
Stanford over $10,000.
The Board in the past has approved
recommended general tuition in
creases essentially unaltered.
The proposal would raise tuition to
$7140 per year or $2380 per quarter, an
increase of 13.6 percent over this
year's rate of $6285.
In discussing the increase. Assis
tant Provost Timothy Warner of the
Office of Management and Budget
said the tuition hike is necessary to
maintain the high quality of education
here, and specifically blamed the size
of the increase on the need to keep fac
ulty and staff salaries competitive
with other comparable institutions
and on a substantial rise in utility
rates.
"You're talking about an economy
where costs are driven by inflation
and an insistence on maintaining the
quality of education here," Warner

said.
We are not happy about the in
crease.' he said "It is the source of
income we sweat about the most, but
it is the only one we can push one way
or another."
Tuition for medical students who
first enrolled in 1979 or before would
increase from $6867 to $7805 per year,
and for medical students who came to
the University since then it would rise
irom $7338 to $8340 (up 13.65 percent).
Law students' tuition would go from
$6434 to $7290 per year (up 13.3
percent I and terminal graduate regis
tration (TOR) from $160 to $200 per
quarter
All rents would increase 15 percent,
to $1232 per year for self-operated
houses and $1291 for regular dorm
rooms, and a year's full board would
cost $1674. $161 (10.6 percent) more
than the $1513 currently charged.
This would bring the total rate for
tuition, room and board to $10,105.
The same increase would apply to
Escundido Village, resulting in a jump
from $261 to $300 per month for a one

bedroom family apartment
Director of Housing and Facilities
Ed Scoles said that the 15 percent
across-the-board increases in rent for
all University-owned student housing
would generate a $212,000 surplus next
year to help offset this year's
projected $315,000 deficit, a figure
that is $250,000 more than was
projected in last year's budget. Scoles
blamed this year's deficit in part on
utility costs rising half a million
dollars to $2.8 million The long-range
forecast for housing costs shows defi
cits totalling more than $1.5 million
from 1982-83 to 1984-85. which Scoles
attributed to the cost of the new dorm,
to be built near Lagunita Court.
Scoles said that deficit, much of
which will be covered from the hous
ing system's $1.5 million reserves,
made him reluctant "to dip into re
serves next year" — and hence the
small (1 percent of budget) planned
surplus.
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon. asked whether he felt the
announced increases would affect the
number of applicants to Stanford or
the number of admittees who choose
to enroll, said. "I don't have anything
to support that conclusion at this
point, other than my general feeling
that it (the increase) is awfully high."
