# John Anderson 'seriously' studying guest professorship offer by ASSU
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Former independent presidential
pndidate John Anderson is "very se
riously considering" an offer to teach
a course here Spring Quarter, an An
derson aide confirmed yesterday.
The 20-year Illinois congressman,
who plans to retire from the House of
Representatives when his term ex

pires next month, is currently com
posing a formal outline for a course to
be sponsored by the ASSU Guest Pro
fessorship Board. according to Bruce
Post, Anderson's administrative as
sistant.
Although Political Science Prof.
David Danelski agreed yesterday to
serve as Anderson's faculty sponsor to
help him through the accreditation
process, logistical factors such as
salary, housing and ASSU Senate ap
proval have not been resolved.
Teaching at Stanford, said Post, is
just one of several short term op
portunities Anderson is considering in
the transition from public official to
private citizen.
Other possible plans include prac
tising law, speaking on the lecture
circuit and writing books or news
paper articles.
'High interest'
But the opportunity to impart
knowledge to college students, who
were among his most vocal supporters
during the presidential campaign, ap
pears to present a special intrigue for
the congressman
Anderson's "high interest" in
teaching here came in response to an
invitation he received last month from
Steve Richardson, member of the
guest professorship board.
Richardson, who spoke with An
derson yesterday, said the con
gressman "seemed really excited"
about the prospect of teaching here,
especially in light of the strong man
date he received in a campus-wide
mock election one week before the
election.
"I think (Anderson's) ready to take
on the world." Richardson said, add
ing that the course would probably

focus on international relations.
The major issue facing the Guest
Professorship Board in regard to An
derson's possible professorship is fun
ding.
With a reserve of just $8000. the
board may seek underwriting grants
from other branches of the University,
such as the Political Science and
American Studies departments, or it
may try to enlist the financial support
of the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE).
According to Dick Butterfield of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the Guest
Professorship Board did not seek an
additional fee assessment this year
because the money from last year,
when no guest professors were in
vited. went unspent.
Past ASSU guest professors have
received up to $6000 for one quarter's
work, as in the case of activist Daniel
Ellsberg who taught here spring, 1979.
Resident fellow?
The board is also exploring the pos
sibility of having the congressman
serve as a resident fellow, thus solving
the question of housing while at the
same time promoting greater interac
tion between Anderson and the com
munity.
Anderson has indicated that he
would prefer to live on campus with
his wife, Keke. and possibly some of
their children, Richardson said.
Anderson is one of at least a half
dozen professionals who have been
contacted by the Guest Professorship
Board.
They include outgoing Democratic
Senators Birch Bayh and George Mc-
Govern, columnist William Buckley,
and former Ambassador to the Soviet
Union. Malcolm Toon.
Feminist Charlotte Bunch, founder
of Quest Magazine , has also been of
fered a guest professorship, and has
responded favorably, according to
Butterfield.
Besides Ellsberg, there have been
some 10 ASSU guest professorships
since 1969. including activist Angela
Davis in 1976, computer scientist
Fernando Flores in 1978, Native
American activist Dennis Banks in
1979 and Chicano Artist Malaquias
Montoya last spring.
According to a prototype copy of the
ASSU Professorship Board Handbook,
the Board's goal is to "bring to the
Stanford campus lecturers with per
spectives on society not always found
here in our sheltered environment. Be
they politicians, scientists, journal
ists, or artists, guest professors will
Ideally offer a change of pace and
hopefully stir up constructive con
troversy."
