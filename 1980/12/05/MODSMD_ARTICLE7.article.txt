# Pulitzer Prize-winning graduates discuss Synanon expose

Pulitzer prize winners David and Cathy Mitchell yes
terday explained how they uncovered the truth behind
the Synanon drug rehabilitation center — the story
which won them journalism's most coveted award.
The Mitchells, who own the Point Reyes Light. a
small weekly paper in western Marin County, spoke
before 50 persons in Redwood Hall. Through what they
described as "just keeping at it" since 1978, the pair
gradually exposed the corrupt nature of the Synanon
"cult," also located in Marin County.
And now that the two Stanford graduates have re
ceived nation-wide attention from both their Pulitzer
prize and their book. The Light On Synanon, the
Mitchells seem remarkably humble.
"If we did anything at all," said David Mitchell, "we
showed that we're a tiny paper — and we were not the
best reporters on the story, but we just kept at it."
His wife went so far as to claim that "we should not
have won the award" — that is, "if the daily media had
been doing their job."
The Mitchells bought the Light in 1975. intending only
to chronicle local activities. In fact, said Cathy
Mitchell, she and her husband had "given up all ambi
tions of being well known." and planned to lead a se
cluded but happy life in Marin County
"You're automatically handicapped with a weekly
newspaper." she said. "We usually get scooped (by the

major media), but that's okay — we expect it. Like with
the four murders that were just discovered (last Friday
at Point Reyes National Seashore), we couldn't publish
that until Wednesday."
But back in 1978, when rumors of bizarre behavior
within the Synanon organization were heard in Point
Reyes Station, the Mitchells were surprised to find that
they were virtually the only paper making any note of
it. Synanon had evolved into a kind of church under its
founder. Charles Dedrich. and thereby could evade tax
es.
"KGO radio said that Synanon had bought $60,000
dollars of ammunition." she explained "So we figured
that we'd been scooped, but we went out anyway and
put together a little story for that week's issue."
Soon thereafter, she said, the Marin County Grand
Jury issued a damaging report on Synanon. accusing
the organization of child abuse and of buying the guns
Again, the Light ran this as front-page news.
"At the same time. Phil Ritter, an ex-Synanon mem
ber, was attacked stepping out of his car in Berkeley."
she said. "That was news, so we printed the story."
Although the Light did not print the story until 10
days later, it seemed, strangely enough, to be the only
paper covering the incident.
The Light continued to cover Synanon almost ex
clusively for six months, detailing several related vi
olent incidents, until two Synanon members placed a

rattlesnake in the mailbox of a Los Angeles attorney.
At that point, as the Mitchells had long hoped, the
major news media began to pick up on the story. In fact,
it was a reporter for the Son Francisco Chronicle that
nominated the Mitchells for the Pulitzer.
The road until that point, though, was a difficult one
for the Mitchells.
"We were the last news medium on thestory," David
Mitchell said. "We were getting pretty depressed; we
almost sold the paper Here was a major crime and
nothing was being done about it."
Also frustrating, he said, was what he called "the in
ability of the law to take action."
"You don't realize how political our criminal justice
system is." he said. "There has got to be a lot of pres
sure (if you want to make anything happen). We tried
with an editorial campaign and by talking in private to
officials "
He expressed discouragement that Dedrich last sum
mer was only fined and put on probation for his convic
tion for conspiracy to commit murder
Mitchell also noted difficulties relating to the size of
his paper. He was unable to put together "blockbuster
stories" like other newspapers, he said
"We could only give out readers a small piece of the
story at a time," he explained "But I'm not sure that's
a bad way to do it. It kept thestory in our readers minds
for some time."

Naturally, there was some danger in exposing a story
of this sort. And the Mitchells were not without fear of
being hurt.
"I went out and got training which allows me to carry
tear gas." he said. "We had police patrol our house fre-

quently. ... We were very nervous."
"Interestingly enough," added his
wife, "we never got a real threat. I
think they tried to just ignore us."
Since the Mitchells began receiving
wide publicity. David Mitchell said, he
has received offers to teach at several
institutions. But he has turned them
all down.
"I'm frankly looking forward to
having things get back to normal." he
said.
