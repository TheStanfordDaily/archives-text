## Brazil faces big economic crisis 
### 
By The Los Angeles Times
Rio De Janeiro, Brazil - This
South American nation is a
giant of a country with
enormous natural resources. It
has the most diverse and
dynamic economy on the conti
nent, but it is nearing the point
where it cannot provide for its
people.
Indeed, some experts say it
has already reached the point.
Whether it has or not, there is
cause for alarm.
The population is estimated
at 123 million, more than double
what it was 20 years ago. At the
current rate of growth, the pop
ulation will double again in the
next 20 years.
More than 42 percent of Bra
zil's people are under 15, and
most of them are poor and badly
educated, if educated at all.
By conservative estimates,
there are 2 million abandoned
children in the country. Be
tween 20 million and 25 million
children are labeled carentes,
lacking even the basic needs of
life.
Education lacking
Education experts say that at
least 6 million children get no
education at all. because there
are not enough schools.
Hugh areas of Brazil are
barely settled, but about 70
percent of the people are
crammed into six cities within
100 miles of the coast, and they
are still coming. This means
crowded slums, high crime, dis
ease, social disorder and an ov
erburdened public welfare sys
tem.
One government expert said
that millions of babies, die
before their first birthday.
"Officially, the infant mor
tality rate is 10 percent." he
said. "but. really, we think it is
closer to 20 percent.
For many of those who sur
vive. life holds no promise.
"What it comes down to," an
American-educated sociologist
said, "is that every year we add
the total population of Uruguay
to ours when we can't even be
gin to take care of what we al
ready have.
High costs
The cost is obviously heavy.
Unemployment figures are not
reliable, but Brazilian govern
ment economists don't argue
with estimates that 40 percent
to 50 percent of the work force is
underemployed — that is, mak
ing less than the $80-a-month
minimum wage.
"Every year we have to
create 1.5 million new jobs
merely to stay even." one econ
omist said. "In 10 years we will
have to raise that to 3 million as
more and more people enter the
job market, and I don't see how
we can keep it up."
Two theories have been ad
vanced as possible solutions.
One of them has been applied for
16 years of military government

— it calls for economic growth
Its proponents believe that, with
a constantly growing and de
veloping economy, benefits will
trickle down and gradually im
prove the lives of the poor.
But Brazil has reached the
point where it requires 6 percent
real economic growth every
year just to keep even. And a
higher economic growth rate
means serious inflationary
pressures in a society already
burdened by a yearly rise of 104
percent in the cost of living.
Alternative plan
The other theory, which
might be combined with a slow
ing of economic growth, is popu
lation control — and the term
itself is controversial in Brazil.
"1 prefer to talk about family
planning," said an official in the
office of President Joao
Figueiredo. But even this eu
phemism is so charged that few
are willing to be quoted by name
in discussing it.
The question of family plan
ning. or birth control, is con
sidered politically sensitive
mostly because of the power of
the Roman Catholic Church;
more than 90 percent of the peo
ple are nominally Catholic.
The real question does not in
volve practicing birth control;
most of the middle and upper
classes practice some kind of
birth control. The real question
involves getting information
and materials out to the poor,
who make up most of the popu
lation.
There are about 200 abortion
clinics in the country, but 160 of
them are located in the two
richest cities, Rio and Sao
Paulo.
These clinics are illegal but
last year, according to some es
timate. I million to 3 million
abortions were performed at
them, at a cost of more than $1
billion.
President Figueiredo has said
that he wants the Brazilian poor
to have the same options for
family planning as the rich. But
little is being done, mostly be
cause of the fear of the church,
even though a recent survey in
Sao Paulo indicates that the
people are not so much in
fluenced by the church's opposi
tion.
Only 1.3 percent'of the women
of fertile age who were in
terviewed said that for religious
reasons they would not use con
traceptives. The overwhelming
reason given for not practicing
birth control was the lack of
means.
A sociologist said, "The gov
ernment has to do more than
just say these things should be
available. It has to train people
and make the information and
material available at a low cost
and in a culturally acceptable
way. If that is done, then I can
guarantee you that we could cut
the birth rate here in half."

lation control — and the term
itself is controversial in Brazil.
"1 prefer to talk about family
planning," said an official in the
office of President Joao
Figueiredo. But even this eu
phemism is so charged that few
are willing to be quoted by name
in discussing it.
The question of family plan
ning. or birth control, is con
sidered politically sensitive
mostly because of the power of
the Roman Catholic Church;
more than 90 percent of the peo
ple are nominally Catholic.
The real question does not in
volve practicing birth control;
most of the middle and upper
classes practice some kind of
birth control. The real question
involves getting information
and materials out to the poor,
who make up most of the popu
lation.
There are about 200 abortion
clinics in the country, but 160 of
them are located in the two
richest cities, Rio and Sao
Paulo.
These clinics are illegal but
last year, according to some es
timate. I million to 3 million
abortions were performed at
them, at a cost of more than $1
billion.
President Figueiredo has said
that he wants the Brazilian poor
to have the same options for
family planning as the rich. But
little is being done, mostly be
cause of the fear of the church,
even though a recent survey in
Sao Paulo indicates that the
people are not so much in
fluenced by the church's opposi
tion.
Only 1.3 percent'of the women
of fertile age who were in
terviewed said that for religious
reasons they would not use con
traceptives. The overwhelming
reason given for not practicing
birth control was the lack of
means.
A sociologist said, "The gov
ernment has to do more than
just say these things should be
available. It has to train people
and make the information and
material available at a low cost
and in a culturally acceptable
way. If that is done, then I can
guarantee you that we could cut
the birth rate here in half."

Rio De Janeiro, Brazil - This
South American nation is a
giant of a country with
enormous natural resources. It
has the most diverse and
dynamic economy on the conti
nent, but it is nearing the point
where it cannot provide for its
people.
Indeed, some experts say it
has already reached the point.
Whether it has or not, there is
cause for alarm.
The population is estimated
at 123 million, more than double
what it was 20 years ago. At the
current rate of growth, the pop
ulation will double again in the
next 20 years.
More than 42 percent of Bra
zil's people are under 15, and
most of them are poor and badly
educated, if educated at all.
By conservative estimates,
there are 2 million abandoned
children in the country. Be
tween 20 million and 25 million
children are labeled carentes,
lacking even the basic needs of
life.
Education lacking
Education experts say that at
least 6 million children get no
education at all. because there
are not enough schools.
Hugh areas of Brazil are
barely settled, but about 70
percent of the people are
crammed into six cities within
100 miles of the coast, and they
are still coming. This means
crowded slums, high crime, dis
ease, social disorder and an ov
erburdened public welfare sys
tem.
One government expert said
that millions of babies, die
before their first birthday.
"Officially, the infant mor
tality rate is 10 percent." he
said. "but. really, we think it is
closer to 20 percent.
For many of those who sur
vive. life holds no promise.
"What it comes down to," an
American-educated sociologist
said, "is that every year we add
the total population of Uruguay
to ours when we can't even be
gin to take care of what we al
ready have.
High costs
The cost is obviously heavy.
Unemployment figures are not
reliable, but Brazilian govern
ment economists don't argue
with estimates that 40 percent
to 50 percent of the work force is
underemployed — that is, mak
ing less than the $80-a-month
minimum wage.
"Every year we have to
create 1.5 million new jobs
merely to stay even." one econ
omist said. "In 10 years we will
have to raise that to 3 million as
more and more people enter the
job market, and I don't see how
we can keep it up."
Two theories have been ad
vanced as possible solutions.
One of them has been applied for
16 years of military government

— it calls for economic growth
Its proponents believe that, with
a constantly growing and de
veloping economy, benefits will
trickle down and gradually im
prove the lives of the poor.
But Brazil has reached the
point where it requires 6 percent
real economic growth every
year just to keep even. And a
higher economic growth rate
means serious inflationary
pressures in a society already
burdened by a yearly rise of 104
percent in the cost of living.
Alternative plan
The other theory, which
might be combined with a slow
ing of economic growth, is popu
lation control — and the term
itself is controversial in Brazil.
