San Salvador, El Salvador
(AP) â€” Thousands of teen
agers have given up basketball,
dances and other games for
rifles and the civil war that has
taken more than 8500 lives in El
Salvador this year.
"Dances and games are hal
lucinogens and keep us from re
alizing the exploitation and the
massacre that victimizes our
people," said one 15-year-old
identifying herself as Yesenia.
"My parents agree with me.
My father says, 'Go ahead,
daughter. The struggle should
be constant,'" said 13-year-old
Blanca.
With red and black bandanas
masking their faces, they were
two of the dozens of teen-agers
among leftists occupying the
Metropolitan Cathedral since
Friday, keeping vigil beside the
bodies of six leaders of the Dem
ocratic Revolutionary Front
who were kidnapped and
murdered by right-wing ter
rorists last week.
Joining guerrillas
Many other youths have
joined the guerrilla bands fight
ing the military-civilian govern
ment and ultra-rightist armed
groups.
Yesenia and Blanca said they
have been members of leftist
groups for more than a year.
They said they hope to become

guerrilla lighters soon.
"My mother is a worker,"
said Yesenia, who is a member
of MERS, the Salvadoran Revo
lutionary Student Movement,
made up of high-school stu
dents. "1 have seen her ex
ploited. She works and works
and our situation never im
proves. I used to feel angry, but
I forgot my anger playing
basketball, in dances and other
games.
Organization first
"Now I have learned that
dancing and music are hallu
cinogens because it makes us
forget the reality that surrounds
us. That is why my mother
agrees that I should be or
ganized. She is afraid some
times. but she knows our strug
gle is a just one."
Blanca, 5-feet-2-inches tall
and soft spoken, said she is "not
afraid. Yesterday there was a
military operation all around.
They detoured the traffic for
more than three hours and we
were waiting for an attack.
Nothing happened, but they
were three very hard hours."
The two girls were inside the
cathedral last Friday when a
bomb exploded in front of it. The
explosion injured five people
and damaged the main door to
the church.
