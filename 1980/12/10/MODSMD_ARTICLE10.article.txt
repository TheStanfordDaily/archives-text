# Poland's political turmoil hurts economy
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Warsaw, Poland — Late fall
in Warsaw is a cheerless season.
Days are cloudy and short. Bare
trees reveal the drabness of
hastily-erected new buildings.
Apartments often are under
heated. Probably not since the
immediate postwar years has
life in Poland been so trying.
There is an acute shortage of
many consumer goods. Meat is
in particularly short supply, and
as of .lan. 1 it will be rationed.
Severe fall flooding and an early
frost have made even potatoes,
the traditional Polish staple,
hard to obtain.
There is little prospect that
the economic situation will im
prove soon The new govern
ment. which took over in the
wake of industrial unrest in the
summer, designed various stop
gap measures to alleviate the
living conditions. Investments
in heavy industry were
drastically cut in favor of in
creased expenditures in the con
sumer area, and the export of

food was stopped.
Meanwhile, however, the
wage increases granted during
the strikes aggravate the infla
tionary spiral, and the country's
debt in hard currency, which by
the summer stood at $20.5
billion, climbs rapidly.
Walesa appeals
Thus, the leader of the inde
pendent trade unions. Lech
Walesa, was absolutely right
last week when he insisted that

what Poland needs now is a peri

bor. and appealed to the worker
to end the wildcat strikes.
The ball is now in the govern
ment's court. If it is allowed a
breathing spell, it must use the
interlude to formulate a com
prehensive package of reforms
to regain at least a modicum of
confidence among the people. A
commission of experts charged
with preparing long-range eco
nomic changes has already
started its work.
As last week's central com
mittee meeting indicated, the
Communist Party has not yet
recovered from the shock of the
popular upheaval and the subse
quent toppling of Edward
(iierek. The new first secretary.
Stanislaw Kania. has been only
gradually consolidating his
position. An extensive purge of
compromised party officials,
especially at the provincial
level, is under way. There is a
good chance that Kania will be
able to take hold of the party in
time for its extraordinary Con
gress in the first half of 1981.
Divided party
The party currently is divided
three ways between reformists,
pragmatists and hard-liners.
The reformist wing advocates a
comprehensive overhaul of the
country's economic and politi
cal system It is relatively weak
at the top. but it enjoys broad
support at the grass roots,
where reportedly some 2 million

out of a total of 3 million party
members have joined solidarity
ranks.
The centrist group led bv
Kania is thoroughly pragmatic.
It has no special commitment to
reforms, but for reasons of
practical politics, at least to a
degree, it is willing to go along
with them.
The reformists and the
pragmatists are being opposed
by the hard-liners, who some
times for ideological but more
often for purely opportunistic
reasons resist the changes in the
country. They are still well en
trenched in many positions in
the government, particularly at
the provincial level, and they
often use their influence to
hinder cooperation with the in
dependent trade unions. The re
peated violations of the Gdansk
accords, such as the attempt by
a local governor to quash the un
ions in Czestochowa. or the ar
rest of the Solidarity printer in
Warsaw, have been their doing
Distrust of Communists
The zig-zagging by the Com
munist authorities, in turn, ag
gravates the distrust that the
workers feel toward them. Hav
ing been deceived by former
party boss Edward Gierek in the
'70s. the workers are now very
sensitive to any threats to the
gains they have achieved. They
believe the best way to protect
themselves is by possessing an
organization of their own inde
pendent of the Communist Par
ty. Those legitimate sentiments
however, occasionally tend to
be carried to the extreme.
In an organization as new and
as untested as Solidarity it is
only natural that there have
emerged some leaders who
have been overimpressed with
their successes to date and who
think that the best way to deal
with the Communist govern
ment is to keep it constantly off
balance. They tend to resort to
the threat of a general strike not
only over major national issues,
but also over local questions.
There is. moreover, an increas

ing politicization of the unions'
demands. They recently pro
posed. for example, that they in
vestigate jointly with Par
liament the abuse by security
authorities.
So far the government has not
challenged Solidarity outright
over those issues. Yet. at last
week's Central Committee
meeting. Kania sternly warned
the independent trade unions to
confine their attention to eco
nomic matters and to stop med
dling in political affairs. He also
ominously attributed this latter
tendency to the influence of
"anti-Socialist forces" over the
unions.
Kania's warnings that the
free-trade unions should abstain
from political activity,
moreover, were coupled with
renewed assurances that the
(idansk Accords will be fully re
spected by the party and that
the process of renewal in Poland
is to continue.
The Poles hope for discreet,
but firm Western diplomatic
support, in the form of stern
warnings to the Soviet Union
about the momentous interna
tional consequences that an at
tack against Poland would in
evitably produce. They also
very much count on continued
Western economic aid

tion. Minister of Foreign Affairs
Jozef Czvrek sketched for '/Vic

policy. Me did not conceal the
fact that the internal unrest has
hurt the country's external posi

in Warsaw is a cheerless season.
Days are cloudy and short. Bare
trees reveal the drabness of
hastily-erected new buildings.
Apartments often are under
heated. Probably not since the
immediate postwar years has
life in Poland been so trying.
There is an acute shortage of
many consumer goods. Meat is
in particularly short supply, and
as of .lan. 1 it will be rationed.
Severe fall flooding and an early
frost have made even potatoes,
the traditional Polish staple,
hard to obtain.
There is little prospect that
the economic situation will im
prove soon The new govern
ment. which took over in the
wake of industrial unrest in the
summer, designed various stop
gap measures to alleviate the
living conditions. Investments
in heavy industry were
drastically cut in favor of in
creased expenditures in the con
sumer area, and the export of

food was stopped.
Meanwhile, however, the
wage increases granted during
the strikes aggravate the infla
tionary spiral, and the country's
debt in hard currency, which by
the summer stood at $20.5
billion, climbs rapidly.
Walesa appeals
Thus, the leader of the inde
pendent trade unions. Lech
Walesa, was absolutely right
last week when he insisted that

what Poland needs now is a peri

bor. and appealed to the worker
to end the wildcat strikes.
The ball is now in the govern
ment's court. If it is allowed a
breathing spell, it must use the
interlude to formulate a com
prehensive package of reforms
to regain at least a modicum of
confidence among the people. A
commission of experts charged
with preparing long-range eco
nomic changes has already
started its work.
As last week's central com
mittee meeting indicated, the
Communist Party has not yet
recovered from the shock of the
popular upheaval and the subse
quent toppling of Edward
(iierek. The new first secretary.
Stanislaw Kania. has been only
gradually consolidating his
position. An extensive purge of
compromised party officials,
especially at the provincial
level, is under way. There is a
good chance that Kania will be
able to take hold of the party in
time for its extraordinary Con
gress in the first half of 1981.
Divided party
The party currently is divided
three ways between reformists,
pragmatists and hard-liners.
The reformist wing advocates a
comprehensive overhaul of the
country's economic and politi
cal system It is relatively weak
at the top. but it enjoys broad
support at the grass roots,
where reportedly some 2 million

out of a total of 3 million party
members have joined solidarity
ranks.
The centrist group led bv
Kania is thoroughly pragmatic.
It has no special commitment to
reforms, but for reasons of
practical politics, at least to a
degree, it is willing to go along
with them.
The reformists and the
pragmatists are being opposed
by the hard-liners, who some
times for ideological but more
often for purely opportunistic
reasons resist the changes in the
country. They are still well en
trenched in many positions in
the government, particularly at
the provincial level, and they
often use their influence to
hinder cooperation with the in
dependent trade unions. The re
peated violations of the Gdansk
accords, such as the attempt by
a local governor to quash the un
ions in Czestochowa. or the ar
rest of the Solidarity printer in
Warsaw, have been their doing
Distrust of Communists
The zig-zagging by the Com
munist authorities, in turn, ag
gravates the distrust that the
workers feel toward them. Hav
ing been deceived by former
party boss Edward Gierek in the
'70s. the workers are now very
sensitive to any threats to the
gains they have achieved. They
believe the best way to protect
themselves is by possessing an
organization of their own inde
pendent of the Communist Par
ty. Those legitimate sentiments
however, occasionally tend to
be carried to the extreme.
In an organization as new and
as untested as Solidarity it is
only natural that there have
emerged some leaders who
have been overimpressed with
their successes to date and who
think that the best way to deal
with the Communist govern
ment is to keep it constantly off
balance. They tend to resort to
the threat of a general strike not
only over major national issues,
but also over local questions.
There is. moreover, an increas

ing politicization of the unions'
demands. They recently pro
posed. for example, that they in
vestigate jointly with Par
liament the abuse by security
authorities.
So far the government has not
challenged Solidarity outright
over those issues. Yet. at last
week's Central Committee
meeting. Kania sternly warned
the independent trade unions to
confine their attention to eco
nomic matters and to stop med
dling in political affairs. He also
ominously attributed this latter
tendency to the influence of
"anti-Socialist forces" over the
unions.
Kania's warnings that the
free-trade unions should abstain
from political activity,
moreover, were coupled with
renewed assurances that the
(idansk Accords will be fully re
spected by the party and that
the process of renewal in Poland
is to continue.
The Poles hope for discreet,
but firm Western diplomatic
support, in the form of stern
warnings to the Soviet Union
about the momentous interna
tional consequences that an at
tack against Poland would in
evitably produce. They also
very much count on continued
Western economic aid
In a comprehensive conversa
tion. Minister of Foreign Affairs
Jozef Czvrek sketched for '/Vic
Los Aiwrh's Times thecontours
of the new government's foreign
policy. Me did not conceal the
fact that the internal unrest has
hurt the country's external posi
tion. Yet. he strongly under
lined Poland's intention to
maintain good relations with
the Western countries and to
take new initiatives aimed at
consolidating Fast-West de
tente.
This is all to the good. For if
the Poles need Western support
to consolidate their domestic
changes, the Western powers
also need a tranquil Poland in
order to preserve international
