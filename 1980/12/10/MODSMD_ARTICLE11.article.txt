It was. appearances to the
contrary, not a journalism in
tern's dream
We arrived on Sunday after
noon at Point Reyes Station, a
little town of 350 people resting
one hour up the coast from San
Francisco.
As weekend interns for the
I'oint Reyes Light, the local
newspaper, we fully anticipated
two days of idyllic feature writ
ing — stories about high school
basketball and where to buy
Christmas gifts. Instead, we
spent a lot of our time writing
about four persons found
murdered in the Pt. Reyes na
tional seashore area the day
before. Saturday Nov. 29.
It was what one local called
"the biggest news story in half a
century."
The I'oint Reyes Light
circulates through a coast read
ership of 3000 — and they all
seem to read each issue cover to
cover.
They notice when an ad
changes from page 12 to page 10.
when a name is misspelled (that
happens rarely), or when a per
son writes one too many letters
to the editor.
Despite its ordinary ap
pearance. the Light stands out
from thousands of community
newspapers which make up the
grassroots media of this coun
try. Last year, the Light won a
Pulitzer Prize.
The prize, journalism's most
prestigious award, was given to
the paper for its investigation
and exposure of Svnanon, a na
tional corporate cult with head
quarters in Marshall, just up the
coastal highway from Point
Reyes Station.
The paper is owned, operated,
published, and edited by Dave
and Cathy Mitchell, two former

graduate students at Stanford
They also sweep the floors and
clean the bathroom
The Mitchells were on cam
pus last week for a series of
seminars and speeches. In their
place (physically, anyway).
Stanford sent up four students to
write stories, do interviews,
make phone calls, paste up the
paper and buy necessities like
typewriter ribbons and orange
juice — in short, what the
Mitchells usually do On a small
town paper details aren't as
signed to underlings — they're
too important
Enter the first two interns.
Monday morning. 8 a.m. The
news editor, the only other full
time staff writer on the paper,
hardly had enough time to in
troduce himself: "Hi — we've
had four murders here this
weekend — here's what I want
you to do. sorry. I've got to go
back to my story."
Julie covered a story on a lo
cal dam which had been van
dalized the week before — a hot
issue in the town — and I was
sent out to cover the town reac
tion to the murders.
All I was told to do was go out
side. walk up and down the main
street and get "names and
quotes." The first place on the
agenda was the Station House
Cafe, one of the local restau
rants and apparently the hang
out for the breakfast crowd. So I
stopped in. sat down at the main
table, and waited.
I didn't wait long. Locals
came in. if only for a cup of cof
fee. and not surprisingly, every
one was talking about the
murders. Reactions varied —
some were petrified and vowed
not to go near the park until the
murderer was found; some re
acted much less fearfully. One
said. "With a million people vis
iting the place every year, what
do they expect?"
He was the "town cynic."
There appeared to be a
"town" everything. There was
a town lawyer, a town doctor, a
town mechanic and a couple of

town shopkeepers. There was
even a town burglar, although
we didn't get to meet him Eve
rybody knew who he was but no
body was able to catch him
And then there were the
names Mere combinations of
letters, perhaps, but they take
on greater significance when
everyone but you knows how to
pronounce them
I spent a good deal of time,
certainly too much, asking peo
ple questions like "How do you

spell that exactly? Is that 'p-a'
or 'b-a'? Oh, it's 'd-a.' Geez, I'm
sorry." One storeowner with a
particluarlv long, ethnic-sound
ing name spelled his name out
completely. I later learned that
about half the people in town
had the same name.
Meanwhile, Julie called
around town to ask people about
the dam. She would call a source
and talk for 10 minutes or so. A
few moments later, the person
would be down at the office
wanting to know what had been
attributed to whom.
Each person seemed to be a
talking phone book: No, he

doesn't livehere You want 1469.
this is 1649 You've got the
wrong Giacomini He's Waldo,
this is Walter
The news editor worked on
through the night He was there
when we arrived, he was there
when we left He was there
when we arrived there the next
day
Later in the morning. I came
back from walking the streets
and visiting stores, the eating
spots and the post office to write

up my reaction story. Even
more important in this town
than knowing what I was writ
ing about was looking like I
knew who I was writing about,
and I tried to make it sound like
I did.
There were more stories —
short writeups of a local citizen
arrested on charges of smuggl
ing cocaine, another nabbed for
assault. Even in this setting,
where there is a lot of personal
contact among town members,
there was a disturbing sense
that town events were becoming
stories to be written up for their
own sake and not necessarily be

cause thev were about real peo
ple
And there was also a sense
that maybe too much of what we
were writing about was the bad
side of things Perhaps that is
inherent in the profession Gay
Talese opened his famous bio
graphy of the \en York Times
with the observation
"Most journalists are rest
less voyeurs who see the warts
on the world, the imperfections
in people and places The sane

scene that is much of life, the
great portion of the planet un
marked by madness, does not
lure them like riots and raids,
crumbling countries and sinking
ships, bankers banished to Rio
and burning Buddhist nuns —

gloom is their game, the specta
cle their passion, normality
their nemesis."
While the Light's pages in
cluded a greater dose of such
'•normality" than the typical
front page of the Times, the ob
servation was certainly rele
vant to much of what we wrote
— particularly in a week where
the lead story was about a de
ranged murderer
Still, there were many sub
jects which did fit the Norman
Rockwell print
I spent a part of the afternoon
talking to the coaches, boys and
girls of the high school's basket
ball squads — thev all won their
opening games.
Meanwhile. Julie interviewed
the owners of a French restau
rant who told her about Christ
mas customs in Europe.
There were notices about
holiday fairs, church meetings,
town gatherings. Although re
legated to less prominent pages
of the Light, such "normality"
was not buried.
Tuesday was press day — a
hectic pace persisted. Phones
never stopped ringing, people
never stopped coming in. type
writers never stopped clacking.
We did more stories and typed
up more notices. In a given two
minute span, we might shift at
tention from the murders to a
bake sale, from a pageone head
line to finding more scraps to
throw in the wood-burning
stove.
The building is cold and
cramped — but still charming.
It is filled with chaos, bustle and
voung voices, topped with a ra
dio that alternates between rock
and jazz, trying desperately to
win a noise contest with the

rickety typewriters The office
uniform consists of blue jeans
and a tattered shirt The desks
are covered — buried is a better
word — with paper The l.ifjht is
the epitome of an understaffed,
underpaid and overworked or
ganization. but it is clearly a
happv place to work The com
mitment to purpose is there,
however frenzied the scene may
be
Layout - reams and reams of
glossy paper pasted on
cardboard dummy sheets —
comes with the darkness and fog
of a late afternoon It has been
raining all day.
There is one experience we
didn't have on the Lifjht: the
feeling of completeness, for
lack of a better word It must
have hit the while we were
hurtling back over the Golden
Gate Bridge to Stanford. Back
to a frenzied world of our own.
The Liaht staff gets that feel
ing once a week At Stanford, it
happens about once each quar
ter the final relief of putting in
that last footnote to a term pa
per; filling out that last blue
book
It is nighttime in Point Reyes
Station Here, the last headline
has been set. the last correction
typed and the last photograph
cropped to size. The paper has
been "put to bed." in journal
ists' slang. In the morning it
goes to the printer, in the after
noon it comes back to the town.
But in the office on this night, all
is calm. There is a lull in the
chatter of telephones and type
writers.

Enter the first two interns.
Monday morning. 8 a.m. The
news editor, the only other full
time staff writer on the paper,
hardly had enough time to in
troduce himself: "Hi — we've
had four murders here this
weekend — here's what I want
you to do. sorry. I've got to go
back to my story."
Julie covered a story on a lo
cal dam which had been van
dalized the week before — a hot
issue in the town — and I was
sent out to cover the town reac
tion to the murders.
All I was told to do was go out
side. walk up and down the main
street and get "names and
quotes." The first place on the
agenda was the Station House
Cafe, one of the local restau
rants and apparently the hang
out for the breakfast crowd. So I
stopped in. sat down at the main
table, and waited.
I didn't wait long. Locals
came in. if only for a cup of cof
fee. and not surprisingly, every
one was talking about the
murders. Reactions varied —
some were petrified and vowed
not to go near the park until the
murderer was found; some re
acted much less fearfully. One
said. "With a million people vis
iting the place every year, what
do they expect?"
He was the "town cynic."
There appeared to be a
"town" everything. There was
a town lawyer, a town doctor, a
town mechanic and a couple of

town shopkeepers. There was
even a town burglar, although
we didn't get to meet him Eve
rybody knew who he was but no
body was able to catch him
And then there were the
names Mere combinations of
letters, perhaps, but they take
on greater significance when
everyone but you knows how to
pronounce them
I spent a good deal of time,
certainly too much, asking peo
ple questions like "How do you

spell that exactly? Is that 'p-a'
or 'b-a'? Oh, it's 'd-a.' Geez, I'm
sorry." One storeowner with a
particluarlv long, ethnic-sound
ing name spelled his name out
completely. I later learned that
about half the people in town
had the same name.
Meanwhile, Julie called
around town to ask people about
the dam. She would call a source
and talk for 10 minutes or so. A
few moments later, the person
would be down at the office
wanting to know what had been
attributed to whom.
Each person seemed to be a
talking phone book: No, he

doesn't livehere You want 1469.
this is 1649 You've got the
wrong Giacomini He's Waldo,
this is Walter
The news editor worked on
through the night He was there
when we arrived, he was there
when we left He was there
when we arrived there the next
day
Later in the morning. I came
back from walking the streets
and visiting stores, the eating
spots and the post office to write

up my reaction story. Even
more important in this town
than knowing what I was writ
ing about was looking like I
knew who I was writing about,
and I tried to make it sound like
I did.
There were more stories —
short writeups of a local citizen
arrested on charges of smuggl
ing cocaine, another nabbed for
assault. Even in this setting,
where there is a lot of personal
contact among town members,
there was a disturbing sense
that town events were becoming
stories to be written up for their
own sake and not necessarily be

cause thev were about real peo
ple
And there was also a sense
that maybe too much of what we
were writing about was the bad
side of things Perhaps that is
inherent in the profession Gay
Talese opened his famous bio
graphy of the \en York Times
with the observation
"Most journalists are rest
less voyeurs who see the warts
on the world, the imperfections
in people and places The sane

scene that is much of life, the
great portion of the planet un
marked by madness, does not
lure them like riots and raids,
crumbling countries and sinking
ships, bankers banished to Rio
and burning Buddhist nuns —

gloom is their game, the specta
cle their passion, normality
their nemesis."
While the Light's pages in
cluded a greater dose of such
'•normality" than the typical
front page of the Times, the ob
servation was certainly rele
vant to much of what we wrote
— particularly in a week where
the lead story was about a de
ranged murderer
Still, there were many sub
jects which did fit the Norman
Rockwell print
I spent a part of the afternoon
talking to the coaches, boys and
girls of the high school's basket
ball squads — thev all won their
opening games.
Meanwhile. Julie interviewed
the owners of a French restau
rant who told her about Christ
mas customs in Europe.
There were notices about
holiday fairs, church meetings,
town gatherings. Although re
legated to less prominent pages
of the Light, such "normality"
was not buried.
Tuesday was press day — a
hectic pace persisted. Phones
never stopped ringing, people
never stopped coming in. type
writers never stopped clacking.
We did more stories and typed
up more notices. In a given two
minute span, we might shift at
tention from the murders to a
bake sale, from a pageone head
line to finding more scraps to
throw in the wood-burning
stove.
The building is cold and
cramped — but still charming.

It was. appearances to the
contrary, not a journalism in
tern's dream
We arrived on Sunday after
noon at Point Reyes Station, a
little town of 350 people resting
one hour up the coast from San
Francisco.
As weekend interns for the
I'oint Reyes Light, the local
newspaper, we fully anticipated
two days of idyllic feature writ
ing — stories about high school
basketball and where to buy
Christmas gifts. Instead, we
spent a lot of our time writing
about four persons found
murdered in the Pt. Reyes na
tional seashore area the day
before. Saturday Nov. 29.
It was what one local called
"the biggest news story in half a
century."
The I'oint Reyes Light
circulates through a coast read
ership of 3000 — and they all
seem to read each issue cover to
cover.
They notice when an ad
changes from page 12 to page 10.
when a name is misspelled (that
happens rarely), or when a per
son writes one too many letters
to the editor.
Despite its ordinary ap
pearance. the Light stands out
from thousands of community
newspapers which make up the
grassroots media of this coun
try. Last year, the Light won a
Pulitzer Prize.
The prize, journalism's most
prestigious award, was given to
the paper for its investigation
and exposure of Svnanon, a na
tional corporate cult with head
quarters in Marshall, just up the
coastal highway from Point
Reyes Station.
The paper is owned, operated,
published, and edited by Dave
and Cathy Mitchell, two former

graduate students at Stanford
They also sweep the floors and
clean the bathroom

we didn't get to meet him Eve
rybody knew who he was but no
body was able to catch him
And then there were the
names Mere combinations of
letters, perhaps, but they take
on greater significance when
everyone but you knows how to
pronounce them
I spent a good deal of time,
certainly too much, asking peo
ple questions like "How do you

spell that exactly? Is that 'p-a'
or 'b-a'? Oh, it's 'd-a.' Geez, I'm
sorry." One storeowner with a
particluarlv long, ethnic-sound
ing name spelled his name out
completely. I later learned that
about half the people in town
had the same name.
Meanwhile, Julie called
around town to ask people about
the dam. She would call a source
and talk for 10 minutes or so. A
few moments later, the person
would be down at the office
wanting to know what had been
attributed to whom.
Each person seemed to be a
talking phone book: No, he

Later in the morning. I came
back from walking the streets
and visiting stores, the eating
spots and the post office to write

up my reaction story. Even
more important in this town
than knowing what I was writ
ing about was looking like I
knew who I was writing about,
and I tried to make it sound like
I did.
There were more stories —
short writeups of a local citizen
arrested on charges of smuggl
ing cocaine, another nabbed for
assault. Even in this setting,
where there is a lot of personal
contact among town members,
there was a disturbing sense
that town events were becoming
stories to be written up for their
own sake and not necessarily be

cause thev were about real peo
ple

that maybe too much of what we
were writing about was the bad
side of things Perhaps that is

"Most journalists are rest

great portion of the planet un

the owners of a French restau

There were notices about

was not buried.
Tuesday was press day — a
hectic pace persisted. Phones
never stopped ringing, people
never stopped coming in. type

We did more stories and typed

It was. appearances to the
contrary, not a journalism in
tern's dream
We arrived on Sunday after
noon at Point Reyes Station, a
little town of 350 people resting
one hour up the coast from San
Francisco.
As weekend interns for the
I'oint Reyes Light, the local
newspaper, we fully anticipated
two days of idyllic feature writ
ing — stories about high school
basketball and where to buy
Christmas gifts. Instead, we
spent a lot of our time writing
about four persons found
murdered in the Pt. Reyes na
tional seashore area the day
before. Saturday Nov. 29.
It was what one local called
"the biggest news story in half a
century."
The I'oint Reyes Light
circulates through a coast read
ership of 3000 — and they all
seem to read each issue cover to
cover.
They notice when an ad
changes from page 12 to page 10.
when a name is misspelled (that
happens rarely), or when a per
son writes one too many letters
to the editor.
Despite its ordinary ap
pearance. the Light stands out
from thousands of community
newspapers which make up the
grassroots media of this coun
try. Last year, the Light won a
Pulitzer Prize.
The prize, journalism's most
prestigious award, was given to
the paper for its investigation
and exposure of Svnanon, a na
tional corporate cult with head
quarters in Marshall, just up the
coastal highway from Point
Reyes Station.
The paper is owned, operated,
published, and edited by Dave
and Cathy Mitchell, two former

graduate students at Stanford
They also sweep the floors and
clean the bathroom
The Mitchells were on cam
pus last week for a series of
seminars and speeches. In their
place (physically, anyway).
Stanford sent up four students to
write stories, do interviews,
make phone calls, paste up the
paper and buy necessities like
typewriter ribbons and orange
juice — in short, what the
Mitchells usually do On a small
town paper details aren't as
signed to underlings — they're
too important
Enter the first two interns.
Monday morning. 8 a.m. The
news editor, the only other full
time staff writer on the paper,
hardly had enough time to in
troduce himself: "Hi — we've
had four murders here this
weekend — here's what I want
you to do. sorry. I've got to go
back to my story."
Julie covered a story on a lo
cal dam which had been van
dalized the week before — a hot
issue in the town — and I was
sent out to cover the town reac
tion to the murders.
All I was told to do was go out
side. walk up and down the main
street and get "names and
quotes." The first place on the
agenda was the Station House
Cafe, one of the local restau
rants and apparently the hang
out for the breakfast crowd. So I
stopped in. sat down at the main
table, and waited.
I didn't wait long. Locals
came in. if only for a cup of cof
fee. and not surprisingly, every
one was talking about the
murders. Reactions varied —
some were petrified and vowed
not to go near the park until the
murderer was found; some re
acted much less fearfully. One
said. "With a million people vis
iting the place every year, what
do they expect?"
He was the "town cynic."
There appeared to be a
"town" everything. There was
a town lawyer, a town doctor, a
town mechanic and a couple of

town shopkeepers. There was
even a town burglar, although
we didn't get to meet him Eve
rybody knew who he was but no
body was able to catch him
And then there were the
names Mere combinations of
letters, perhaps, but they take
