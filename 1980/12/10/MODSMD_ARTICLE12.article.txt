## A
						bittersweet farewell 
### 
Stanford will lose an irreplaceable voice
when Assoc Political Science Prof. Nan
nerl Keohane assumes the presidency of
Welleslev College next fall. Although
Keohane's appointment was certainly a
happy occasion, one could not help feeling
some degree of sadness.
Since joining the University in the fall of
1973. Keohane has proven to be one of the
most popular teachers here. Her ac
cessibility to students is a model for other
professors. As member and (since this

fall) chair of the Faculty Senate, she has
helped to shape University academic poli
cy.
Keohane's lucid presentations on
feminism have sparked much-needed de
bate and provided a rallying point for
many campus groups. Always responsive
to criticism. Keohane's openness is a re
freshing reminder that students can mat
ter Keohane's intelligence, and. more im
portantly. her courage and conviction will
be sorelv missed.
