# Examine impact of spraying
## 
### 
In the wake of the infestation of Santa
Clara County with Mediterranean fruit
flies, federal officials have been consider
ing an aerial pesticide spraying program
to exterminate them.
The authorities claim that all alter
native ways to eradicate the insects —
such as scattering sterile male flies —
have been exhausted. and that the severity
of the situation makes the spraying un
avoidable because they say it imperils
California's entire $12 billion-per-vear ag
riculture industry. It has recently been
suggested, however, that the cold weather
typical to the Bay Area would kill them off
as winter progresses.
Officials have said that they will spray
between 9 and 11 a.m. and 1 and 3 p.m. to
avoid exposing children to the insecticide,
called malathion; that bees and other in
sects are likely to be killed by it: that the
spray may damage the paint on some au
tomobiles: and that fish in fishponds are
likely to be killed if the ponds are not cov
ered.
According to officials of the state De
partment of Health Services, the depart
ment was not consulted about the
sprayings, which are to take place six
times over the next two months through
out the county, except in Gilrov. outside
the infestation area.
The spraying, however, has ramifica
tions far beyond ridding the county of a
pest that is a menace to agriculture.
Whenever humans intervene on a large
scale in the environment, there is a risk
that the consequences will outstrip the in
tent. The ecological balance may easily be
upset bv the extinction of small predatory
insects in this area. For instance, if the
spider population is sharply reduced, the
check they represent on flies, gnats and
lice would be reduced as well, possibly
enabling those insects to make substantial
population gains.
Other problems involved with the

spraying include health hazards to hu
mans — a chemical that is likely to strip
baked enamel paint from cars may have
serious consequences when it falls on hu
man skin. And it is possible that the au
thorities' concern for children's exposure
to malathion conceals a more serious
threat to adults than they have yet been
willing to acknowledge.
Another concern is the universality of
exposure. The entire county will be
sprayed from the air, leaving no part un
touched. and robbing individuals of the
chance to make their own choice whether
they want their fruit trees, backyards and
so on. sprayed. It is not as though farmers
are choosing to spray their fields. Rather,
the insecticide is being imposed on the en
tire county.
One very important aspect of this situ
ation. and one of the few causes for op
timism, is that community input is being
solicited on the issue. Fourteen city coun
cils in Santa Clara County, including Palo
Alto and Mountain View are being asked to
provide input on the spraying before it
takes place. Monday night, the Palo Alto
City Council voted to go on record as op
posing the spraying.
Students sometimes act as if local cur
rent events do not concern them or as if
they can have no impact on the outcome of
a situation. Both these assumptions are
patently untrue in this case; all of us
would be subject to the possible harmful
effects of the spray, and none of us can
rightly say we can remain aloof and un
concerned.
We urge people to become more in
formed on this topic by calling the county
health department at 321-2141; to express
their opinions to the Board of Supervisors
at 299-2323. the district supervisor at
321-2141. or to the city councils in the area
— Palo Alto at 329-2477 or Mountain View
at 966-6305.
