## Construct grad housing; share meanwhile 
### 
"If you're married and living
off campus, trying to support a
family on a graduate stipend of
$3000 is virtually im
possible. Undegraduates who
claim that graduate housing
isn't really needed are saying
thou shall not come to Stanford'
to married graduate students."
(â– Jonathan Siegel, former Chair
of the (iovernance Advisory
Committee of the Eseondido
Village Council.)
There is an on-campus hous
ing shortage. In 1979. the Uni
versity housed approximately
70 percent of all under
graduates. approximately 50
percent of married couples, and
less than 20 percent of single
graduate students. 800 units of
undergraduate housing are
scheduled to be built near Lake
Lagunita. Graduate students in
Eseondido Village are being
forced by the University to pay a
portion of the cost, and are per
turbed.
The issue is far more complex
than the superficial "it's the
principle of the thing" argu
ment. An in-depth examination
of the graduate/undergraduate
housing conflict encompasses
more than ideology; it encom
passes economic survival and
the existence of quality gradu
ate programs in the future of

Stanford.
Graduate students need on
campus housing. Stipends and
TA-RA positions simply do not
provide economic security. In
the past decade, the real value
of the University stipend has de
creased by more than 20
percent. Inflation has risen to 12
percent and the graduate stu
dent has been smothered in the
cross-fire.
Jon Siegel explained. "Three
years ago. I received a stipend
of $2500 and paid $98 a month
rent I managed to save a few
dollars Today, with a stipend, a
TA salary, and $140 a month
rent, I'm not saving a dime. It
really gets bad when you con
sider that buying something as
simple as typing paper required
the fielding of the entire week's
budget. The cost of off-campus
housing would make life next to
impossible. Graduates simply
want the opportunity to make
the choice between on-campus
housing and off-campus hous
ing. rather than being forced
into an unbearable situation."
Admittedly, undergraduate
housing must be built. Since the
'50s the Board of Trustees has
continually recognized these un
dergraduate needs. The fun
damental graduate objection to
supporting the construction of

undergraduate housing through
rent increases in Eseondido Vil
lage is that no commitment is
being made to insure further
construction of graduate hous
ing.
"The housing shortage in the
Silicon Valley will last. There is
a definite need for both gradu
ate and undergraduate housing.
We. as graduates, have not
claimed a right to housing, but
now the University is imposing
an obligation on us and is reluc
tant to give us any commitment.
We want to insure the future of
undergraduates with available
graduate housing. If we're going
to be asked for money, we'd like
the assurance that our sacrifice
will bring security to future
graduate students." stated Jon
Siegel.
Once the additional under
graduate units are completed.
Manzanita Court will provide
housing for 300 single gradu
ates. Yet. by the time the under
graduate housing is completed,
the trailers will have a
projected lifespan of only 5 to 7
years.
Siegel commented, "Even if
Manzanita had saunas, it would
still only be temporary. We need
permanent housing that we can
rely on 70 to 100 years from now
and not just 5 to 7."

Presumably, the 5200 gradu
ates and 6600 undergraduates at
Stanford should have equal op
portunities for on-campus hous
ing. The argument that "under
graduates have just left home
and aren't ready for their share
of off-campus housing" may be
true for some freshman, but
certainly not for seniors who
will be next year's graduate stu
dents. The ideal solution would
equitably divide housing respon
sibilities and benefits, but a
mutual understanding of the ob
jective facts is first required:
1. Graduate students do not
have a disdain for under
graduates.
2. The first step toward pro
viding adequate graduate hous
ing can be accomplished by al
lowing graduate access to the
Row and by sharing Manzanita
between graduates and un
dergraduates.
3. A mixing of under
graduates and graduates in a
single environment would bene
fit both groups with experience.
4. Before any solution can be
reached, graduates need a
framework of some type of Uni
versity commitment to work
within.
5. Communication is the key.
Graduate students have no
formal Daily-type publication

and hence are often left voice
less without media attention.
By expanding the communica
tion among graduates, under
graduates. the Dean of Student
Affairs, and the Director of Res
idential Education, the con
troversy can be diminished.
Siegel. concluded. "A coali
tion working toward the com
mon goal of housing would be
ideal. We favor distribution of
benefits as well as obligations.
It's not just housing that's in
question, but the future of grad
uate educaiton and the caliber
of undergraduate and graduate
students attracted to the Uni
versity environment. It's time
that the Stanford community
recognizes the deeper problem
and puts aside the superficial."
