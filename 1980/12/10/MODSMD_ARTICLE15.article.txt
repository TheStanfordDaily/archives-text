Racist view?
Maurice Fox's letter to the
editor tDaily, Dec. 1) not only
distorts the facts, but also con
tains incorrect allegations and
obscures the realities of the
Palestinian situation.
Let me first take up the incor
rect statements reported in his
short letter.
Many Palestinians have ac
quired citizenship in various
Arab countries other than Jor
dan Kuwait and Saudi Arabia
are some examples. The impor
tant point here, however, is that
the Palestinians do not want
other country's citizenship.
Second, it was Israel who
started and attacked Arab terri
tories in 1956 (with France and
Britain >, in 1967, and 1948 (when
Israel occupied areas far
beyond the 1947 UN partition
plan.)
Kurther, any discussion of
Arab-Israeli conflicts outside
the Palestinian question is in
complete. The closest analogy

to the Palestinian dilemma
would be for some oppressed
group in the world to move to
Washington with organized
Irgun-like units and take over,
subjugating all American
citizens. Would the Americans
not fight back? The fact that
Jews were oppressed in Europe
does not legitimize inflicting
worse conditions on other peo
ple. The question of the Palesti
nian problem is very clear.
There are 4 million Palestinians
living both in Palestine (now Is
rael) and in Diaspora.
The last point I will address is
the racist aspect of Zionism. I
will just refer you to the text of
CBS news on Nov. 7, when
Walter Cronkite reported that
Moshe Dayan. the Israeli ex-for
eign minister, attributed the
low IQ of the American Army to
the high ratio of enlisted blacks!
I think this is a racist view
point, characteristic of most Zi
onist leaders. ....

Exemplary job
Of all the stories in the press
about the new Wellesley presi
dent. the one in the Daily (Dec.
3) was by far the best. Of
course, the news is "news" here
at Stanford in a way it could not
be elsewhere, except at Welles
ley. Whatever impact I make on
the New York Times will have
to be done on the job.
But the Daily article was en
thusiastic. accurate, supportive
and thoughtful — a model job.
marred only by the fact that cel
ebrations and time-zone dif
ferences made it impossible for
the most zealous efforts to
reach me for comment at the
time. Let me thank the writers
of the article for their vigilance
and hard work, and for putting
their talents to such impressive
use This is an article I will
treasure for a long time.
I should also like to thank the
many, many people at Stanford
who have written, phoned.

stopped by the office, or called
out a hearty congratulations as
we passed on the bike path. It is
wonderful to have such good
friends, even among former
strangers. The response has uni
versally been: "How wonderful
for Wellesley and for you; but
we will miss you."
I hope to thank everybody
personally in the long run, but I
wanted to give a general thank
you to the community for this
response And to say that I share
the ambivalence.
This is a wonderful place, in
many ways; it will be hard to
leave. Stanford has given me the
experience and confidence, the
vision and support, to take on
this enormous and wonderful
nt«P loak That is, after all. as
(University President) Don
Kennedy said, what this place is
all about.
