# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Nicodemus et al. Registration resisters, you are not alone 
### 
We are a group of students at
Stanford University, born in
1960 and 1961. who refused to
register for the draft when
called upon to do so last sum
mer.
We address the entire nation,
but in particular we speak to
American males born in or after
1962 who. starting in the first
week of 1981. will themselves
face the decision of whether or
not to register. We would like to
present alternatives to the act
of registration and some of our
reasons for refusing to comply.
First and foremost, we are
only 15 of perhaps a million non
registrants nationwide. A de
tailed Huston (J lobe survey and
many organizations monitoring
the registration results re
ported 25 percent non
compliance (approximately one
million nonregistrants). Selec
tive Service said that seven

percent didn't sign up. Even
seven percent is three and one
half timeswhat they predicted
in early July. In any case, those
who haven't and those who
won't register can be certain
that they are not alone in their
resistance.
Our reasons for opposing reg
istration differ. For some of us.
registration represents an infr
ingement on our constitutional
ly protected freedom from coer
cion (some call it slavery) and
from lack of due process. Some
see registration as an il
legitimate move on the part of
an unpopular president seeking
only personal political advance
ment. irrespective of national
interest. So many other prob
lems demand attention —
energy production, population
management, world food dis
tribution. unemployment — that
registration and militarism

may be viewed as little more
than a cop-out on the part of this
nation's leaders. Some see any
form of complaince with the
military system as tacit ap
proval of the institutions of war
and of power through domi
nation. For some, nonregistra
tion may simply be motivated
by the fear of dying.
Many of us think registration

All of us are united in our belief that
noncompliance is a definitive, personal way
to reject and overcome registration, the
draft, and the general inclination toward
military responses to current world unrest.

will inevitably lead to an actual
draft and to war. The same kind
of process that got us mired in a
bloody and useless war in Viet
nam can be seen unfolding now
in Central America, the Persian
Gulf, and any other region of the
Third World where U.S.-sup
ported regimes suppress popu
lar movements that are fighting
for self-determination and free
dom. The government needs a
draft to force people to fight in
unjust, unpopular wars, in
which they would never volun
tarily participate.
Furthermore, any war
enhances the potential for a nu
clear confrontation between su
per-powers. the consequences
of which are terrifying to im
agine.
All of us are united in our be
lief that noncompliance is a de
finitive. personal way to reject
and overcome registration, the
draft, and the general inclina
tion toward military responses
to current world unrest. We feel
that sufficiently widespread
noncooperation can and will re
sult in a more positive, con
structive world view.
We differ also in the extent to
which we are willing to pursue
our noncompliance in the faceof

prosecution and a potential pris
on sentence. Some of us. recall
ing the vast numbers of non
registrants during the Vietnam
period who kept quiet and were
never caught, intend to keep a
low profile and try to avoid de
tection bv ihe government. If
discovered, some of us would
register to avoid prison, but oth
ers would serve time in con-

tinual protest against regis
tration and its injustices.
Still others would at that point
leave the country — perhaps
never return — or go under
ground rather than either reg
ister or face imprisonment for
breaking a law whose legit
imacy they deny. Some among
us. those whose names appear
at the end of this letter, have
publicly announced their de
cision not to register: they are
determined never to do so de
spite the consequences they
may soon face: All of us are con
vinced that with a million non
registrants and a federal prison
system already overcrowded
with its 25.000 inmates-less than
1/11 of the number admitted to
by the government-there is no
way the system can sustain our
massive resistance and con
tinue to function. We plan to and
can shut down the registration
program through our collective
resistance.
Each of us has had to resolve
some fundamental questions in
arriving at his decision.
Is, for example, the threat
from the Soviet Union not wor
thy of a strong and resolute re
sponse in kind on the part of this
country? Some of us believe that
conflict between super-powers
can only lead to complete and
mutual destruction and that,
therefore, any antagonistic step
on the part of this country is un
warranted regardless of the
threat.
Others feel that the Soviet Un
ion must and will be confronted
in its aggression, but that U.S.
involvement in such an effort in
most foreseeable situations is
unjustified. Should the threat to
this country be real enough,
they assume that massive (in
cluding their own) voluntary
participation in responding to
the threat will be such that reg
istration is not a necessary pre
paratory measure.
Is it not unpatriotic to resist a
national registration? If patri
otism is defined as love of coun
try. then our consciences dic
tate that, for the love of our
country, we resist registration
and the return to a more milita
rist posture on the part of this
nation.
We urge that all concerned by
this registration similarly fol
low their consciences. And if
you do decide to refuse to reg
ister, you can count on our sup
port. Remember, you won't be
alone.
