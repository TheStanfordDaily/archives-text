## The 						real danger in Polish crisis 
### 
Last year when Stanford students were home
tor the Christmas holidays, the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan On the pretext that their presence
had been requested to quell civil disturbances and
settle intra-Party disputes, the Soviets deposed
Afghani Prime Minister Amin, replaced him with
Babrak Karmal. and began the parade of troops
and equipment through Kabul and countryside.
This year, as Stanford students prepare to cele
brate the holidays with family and friends. Soviet
troops are massing in the Carpathians near the
Polish border The summer's unrest has already
brought about a change of regime in Poland The
new government appears willing to honor those
concessions already made, but has hinted darkly
that it will seek outside help if necessary to curb
"anti-socialist forces" agitating for further
change
The most telling aspect of the recent escalation
of the Polish crisis is that most of the news of the
last few weeks has come not from inside Poland
itself but from the capitals of E!urope. Asia, and
North America. Accusations, warnings, threats
and denials issue forth from Potsdam, Prague.
Reijing. Washington and Moscow, but there are
surprisingly few statements from Warsaw or
Gdansk.
While Lech Walesa and the Polish worker's
movement has become more and more re
strained. the voices of the Eastern European com
munist establishments have become more stri
dent and uncompromising. By the time nations as
diverse as China. Chad and Canada feel compelled
to denounce the continued Soviet troop buildup, it
is clear that the stakes in this game are far higher
than the future of non-governmental political
forces in distressed East European economies.
It has been suggested that one consideration in
the timing of a possible Soviet assault is whether
the Soviets prefer to challenge the lame duck
Carter presidency or test the mettle of a Reagan
staff still wet behind the ears in dealing with for
eign crises. This overlooks the main dangers and
most serious implications of an attempted resto
ration of socialist orthodoxy in Poland under color
of Soviet might.
It is improbable that either Carter or Reagan
would choose to meet a Soviet invasion by provid
ing military support to the Polish resistance. An
invasion would certainly spark an outpouring of
angry denunciations and an attempt to isolate the
Soviet Union diplomatically for its transgression.
This beating of breasts would continue even well
after the Soviet armored columns crushed the stu
dents, workers, and renegade Polish Army units
who. like their Afghani counterparts, turn their
guns on the invaders. If it comes to a fight, the
Poles have no one to turn to for aid but each other.
This is not to sav there would not be a concrete

American response The impossibility of an effec
tive military response in Poland without risking
nuclear war might serve to preclude a direct re
sponse to Soviet tanks in Lodz or Lublin but it
might also offer a handy excuse for the Reagan
administration to similarly intervene in nations
where it detects the spectre of international com
munism After all. the rationale used bv the Sovi
ets for their actions toward Poland and Afghan
istan is not that different from the one used by the
United States' pursuit in Vietnam of what can
didate Keagan called "the noble cause "
The frustration engendered by watching help
lessly as Polish liberty is gunned down in the
streets could all too easily be translated into the
irrational support of oppressive right-wing re
gimes around the world under the guise of "not
letting American interests be pushed around any
more."
One possible target of this American frustra
tion could well be BJI Salvador, where two Ameri
can nuns were murdered by rightists last week
Despite the efforts of a reformist junta, the land
owners who have run the country like so many
private fiefdoms have organized paramilitary as
sassin squads and suborned the National Guard.
One Reagan transition team member asserted
American opposition to the patently just cause of
the peasants because of its leftist origins and sup
port Reagan's transition leader slapped the of
ficial's wrist but refused to deny the truth of the
statement.
There are grave domestic consequences of a re
turn to worldwide confrontation and intervention.
The effect of wartime on civil liberties has been
feared by every democratic thinker since Toc
queville and is among the most haunting lessons of
the Vietnam war. Already the Heritage Founda
tion. a conservative think tank, has called for a re
institution of the House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities, which helped justify McCarthyism
and propelled Richard Nixon to power. Despite
the almost total public inactivity of radical op
position in America, the Foundation report calls
on President Reagan to label internal dissent
America's major challenge in the 1980s.
It is ironic that in both Poland and El Salvador
the Catholic Church, long a symbol of oppression,
is at the forefront of social change while the great
temporal dynasties seek to quell and suppress
rather than nurture or comfort. If the Polish situ
ation does in fact result in the carving of the globe
into spheres of interest of the major powers, it
will show the weaker nations of the world that
neither Western democracy nor Western com
munism are very different from traditional
Western patterns of domination.

after the Soviet armored columns crushed the stu
dents, workers, and renegade Polish Army units
who. like their Afghani counterparts, turn their
guns on the invaders. If it comes to a fight, the
Poles have no one to turn to for aid but each other.
This is not to sav there would not be a concrete

American response The impossibility of an effec
tive military response in Poland without risking
nuclear war might serve to preclude a direct re
sponse to Soviet tanks in Lodz or Lublin but it
might also offer a handy excuse for the Reagan
administration to similarly intervene in nations
where it detects the spectre of international com
munism After all. the rationale used bv the Sovi
ets for their actions toward Poland and Afghan
istan is not that different from the one used by the
United States' pursuit in Vietnam of what can
didate Keagan called "the noble cause "
The frustration engendered by watching help
lessly as Polish liberty is gunned down in the
streets could all too easily be translated into the
irrational support of oppressive right-wing re
gimes around the world under the guise of "not
letting American interests be pushed around any
more."
One possible target of this American frustra
tion could well be BJI Salvador, where two Ameri

Despite the efforts of a reformist junta, the land
owners who have run the country like so many
private fiefdoms have organized paramilitary as
sassin squads and suborned the National Guard.
One Reagan transition team member asserted
American opposition to the patently just cause of

There are grave domestic consequences of a re
turn to worldwide confrontation and intervention.
The effect of wartime on civil liberties has been
feared by every democratic thinker since Toc
queville and is among the most haunting lessons of
the Vietnam war. Already the Heritage Founda

institution of the House Committee on Un-Ameri
can Activities, which helped justify McCarthyism
and propelled Richard Nixon to power. Despite
the almost total public inactivity of radical op
position in America, the Foundation report calls
on President Reagan to label internal dissent
America's major challenge in the 1980s.
It is ironic that in both Poland and El Salvador
the Catholic Church, long a symbol of oppression,
is at the forefront of social change while the great
temporal dynasties seek to quell and suppress
rather than nurture or comfort. If the Polish situ

into spheres of interest of the major powers, it
will show the weaker nations of the world that
neither Western democracy nor Western com
munism are very different from traditional
Western patterns of domination.

Last year when Stanford students were home
tor the Christmas holidays, the Soviets invaded
Afghanistan On the pretext that their presence
had been requested to quell civil disturbances and
settle intra-Party disputes, the Soviets deposed
Afghani Prime Minister Amin, replaced him with
Babrak Karmal. and began the parade of troops
and equipment through Kabul and countryside.
This year, as Stanford students prepare to cele
brate the holidays with family and friends. Soviet
troops are massing in the Carpathians near the
Polish border The summer's unrest has already
brought about a change of regime in Poland The
new government appears willing to honor those
concessions already made, but has hinted darkly
that it will seek outside help if necessary to curb
"anti-socialist forces" agitating for further
change
The most telling aspect of the recent escalation
of the Polish crisis is that most of the news of the
last few weeks has come not from inside Poland
itself but from the capitals of E!urope. Asia, and
North America. Accusations, warnings, threats
and denials issue forth from Potsdam, Prague.
Reijing. Washington and Moscow, but there are
surprisingly few statements from Warsaw or
Gdansk.
While Lech Walesa and the Polish worker's
movement has become more and more re
strained. the voices of the Eastern European com
munist establishments have become more stri
dent and uncompromising. By the time nations as
diverse as China. Chad and Canada feel compelled
to denounce the continued Soviet troop buildup, it
is clear that the stakes in this game are far higher
than the future of non-governmental political
forces in distressed East European economies.
It has been suggested that one consideration in
the timing of a possible Soviet assault is whether
the Soviets prefer to challenge the lame duck
Carter presidency or test the mettle of a Reagan
staff still wet behind the ears in dealing with for
eign crises. This overlooks the main dangers and
most serious implications of an attempted resto
ration of socialist orthodoxy in Poland under color
of Soviet might.
It is improbable that either Carter or Reagan
would choose to meet a Soviet invasion by provid
ing military support to the Polish resistance. An
invasion would certainly spark an outpouring of
angry denunciations and an attempt to isolate the
Soviet Union diplomatically for its transgression.
