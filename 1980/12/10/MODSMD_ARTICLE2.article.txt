# Tuition increase approved by trustees
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
The Board of Trustees yesterday
stamped its approval on the 13.6
percent tuition increase which will put
Stanford students' total yearly costs
over $10,000.
"Nobody likes it but nobody can see
a way out of it," commented Bob
Hamrdla, assistant to the president
for trustee affairs. Hamrdla said al
though the board raised questions
about the increase, there was "univer
sal aquiescence." A report to the
board termed it a necessary and vital
factor in maintaining "Stanford's
quality, its ability to respond to the
best of new ideas and its capacity to
deal effectively with the operational
requirements" of the institution.
The report called maintaining the
quality of the University's program
and providing open access to students
of the highest quality "uneasy part
ners."
But that partnership continues to
work, the report concluded, because
"financial aid keeps that quality ac
cessible to those able to benefit from
it, whatever their economic circum
stances."
The board also adopted the latest re
vision of a land-use policy which was
presented to the community last week
in a pre-board meeting review Wil
liam Massy, vice president for busi
ness and finance, said the board ex
pressed concern that Stanford should
keep its land for academic support
use.
However, last week's policy and
land-use plan review did prompt

Massy to recommend an addition to
the policy which the board subse
quently approved yesterday.
The addition. Massy said, states
that it is "desirable to have housing
for people at a variety of income levels
as long as it is economically feasible.'
"It was a question which was raised
Irom the floor at the public meeting,"
Massy said. "It was simply something
we had overlooked."
Another resolution passed by the
board designated a "managerial
group" to have "authority and respon
sibility for the negotiation, execution
and administration of classified
agreements between the Government
and the University."
University President Donald Ken
nedy. Vice Provost and Dean of Grad
uate Studies Gerald Lieberman and
Director of Sponsored Projects
Cilley were named to this group by the
board.
The report to the board stated that
the designation was necessary to
enable the University to have a "Top
Secret facility clearance."
According to the Faculty Hand
hook's "policy guidelines on secrecy
in research." the principle of
openness in research is of overriding
importance and. to the fullest extent
possible, "no program of research
that requires secrecy (should ) be con
ducted at Stanford University."
Lieberman said last night that des
ignation of a "managerial group"
does not oppose this policy.
"Stanford acts as a repository for
documents that the faculty may need

in pursuing unclassified research," he
said, adding that the University allows
classified materials to be housed here
in two instances.
"Classifed research is not per
mitted The output of any research
done here must be open, but to do a
good job on a research project a facul
ty member must sometimes have ac
cess to classified materials.
"Also some of the faculty act as con
sultants to the federal government
and must review classified docu
ments.' Lieberman explained. He
said the faculty have a right to act as
consultants 13 days each quarter and
that tho University's clearance allows
it to store documents for their use.
"They can't keep (classified docu
ments* in their home or office," he
said.
Cilley said of the three with
clearance, he has the "hands on" role
with the documents and is responsible
for making sure they are safe. He said
many of the classifed documents were
connected with the Hoover Institution
and are awaiting declassification In
the meantime "they are kept in boxes
in a room with a very secure door," he
said
The board also approved nine major
academic appointments of which two
were women, a fact which Cecilia
Burciaga, assistant provost for facul
ty affairs, said she thought were
prompted in part by the work of task
forces set up by then-provost Donald
Kennedy last year to review senior
(tenured) appointments of women
Burciaga. who served as a staff

member on two of those task forces,
said the appointment of Virginia
Walbot as associate professor of
biological sciences and Anne Yeager
an associate professor of pediatrics
consituted "the most significant
number of senior faculty women ap
pointed at one time in the past four
years."
The board also reviewed a written
report of the University's Office of
Technology Licensing, although an
oral report was postponed.
Rovaltv income for fiscal vear
1979-80 totaled $654,849 and the office's
cumulative income from licensing ac
tivites since its inception in 1970 is now
$2,711,031, the report stated.
"Potential for significant income

ample. license agreements covering a
genetically-engineered DNA to pro
duce an anti-viral substance, a sound
synthesis technique for musical in
struments" and other inventions, ac
cording to the report.
