## Discrimination a two-edged sword 
### 
Okav. I can certainly tolerate
one response to my column.
(l)aily, Nov. 26) and two, well
that wasn't so bad: but when I
am called an imbecile in a third
rebuttal, I can no longer remain
silent. It is onceagain my turn. I
was not attempting to put forth
my personal philosophy in five
hundred words or less, I was
only providing a contradictory
view to Leah Halper's Daily
column. Each of the responses
was centered on the issue of
rape, which clearly was not the
main tenor of my article. My
point was discrimination and
not one of the articles responded
to the injustice of unequal and
harsh treatment of men. No one
tried to argue that discrimina
tion in any form was wrong. Tt is
the rubuttalists who are guilty
of a "blind and shallow" read
ing of my letter.
The cutting responses to my
letter seem to harp on the
statement that "rape is not a
problem caused bv Stanford
men. . . The respondents
clearly suffer from a "gross
misinterpretation" of my let
ter. Here. I was referring to for
cible rape, and was in no way al
luding to coercive rape (and I do
believe there is a strong dif
ference, but I will not argue it

here). I was merely stating a
statistical fact that the forced
rapes that have oecured on cam
pus are generally caused by out
siders — not students. Thus. I
still feel offended when I am
called a potential rapist. Keep
in mind that my article did not
justify rape, it was not even
about rape. It was about dis
crimination. But none of the re
buttals dealt with the central
theme of my letter that dis
crimination is never right and
that includes unequal treatment
of men. Making men the "bad
guvs" of society will only alien
ate the male population. It will
not solve anything. More im
portantly. if you want to talk
about sexism (as the rebut
talists do) I would suggest that
the responses are considerably
more sexist than my original
letter. I never criticized wom
en. nor did I ever accuse women
of being evil, nor once use the
statement "all women." On the
other hand, each of the rebuttals
is clearly critical of men. and
each uses the phrase "all men"
and the rebuttals are directed at
the male population.
Furthermore, they all make a
distinction between men and
women, white and black, typical
of a sexist approach. Sexism is

not solely a male phenomenon.
The article by Nick Burbules
< Daily, Dee. is the least hys
terical of the three and has sev
eral important claims. But he,
too. misses the main thrust of
my argument and fails to deal
with the issue of unjust and ov
erly critical treatment of Stan
ford men. Furthermore, he says
that "Halper does not say that
Thanksgiving is a holiday for
white, affluent males." Yes.
she does. I quoted directly from
her article. That's what she
said. As a reflection on her com
ment. does her statement mean
that men who are neither white
nor affluent cook on Thanksgiv
ing?
Barbules' main contention
was that I misinterpreted
Halper's columns. No. I in
terpreted them differently, not
necessarily incorrectly. Unless
it is either a foreign language or
you are the original author,
there can be no correct in
terpretation Perhaps the dif
fering views on what Halper
meant indicate a central am
biguity in her writing. I don't
think it implies that I am blind.
Finally. I think it important to
realize that my letter was not
dealing with our inherent socie
tal sexism. It dealt with dis

crimination. I do not condone
unequal treatment of women,
and I realize it is a major prob
lem. More importantly. I fear
unequal treatment of anyone —
men or women. This is what I
was trying to say. and this is
what all of the rebuttalists over
look. Why can't we exist, at
least at Stanford, as people
rather than "us and them?" It is
difficult to react sympa
thetically to the plight of the dis
advantaged when they continue

to thrash out at my character. I
am wilting to work toward
equality in society, but I resent
being blamed for problems
caused by past generations. In
reference to the comments that
I am "an imbecile," "a fool,"
and "blind" I think mv critics
should have directed their com
ments at my arguments and not
engaged in name-calling.
