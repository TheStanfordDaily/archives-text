## Media hostility toward elderly 
### 
Last week I was watching TV
with my grandparents who were
visiting from the East. A slew of
commercials came on during a
break in a Harney Miller re
run. and as usual I spent the
time trying my best to ignore
the onslaught of soppy sweet
jingles. Yet my attention soon
was riveted on the set with the
appearance of a white-haired
elderly woman who was rocking
to the beat in a stained brown
bentwood. Popping sugar candy
balls into her mouth she dropped
her knitting, threw her hands
into the air and exclaimed
"How neatly sweet."
The media's portrayal of sen
ior citizens is a degrading and
rudely stereotyped image. In
commercials, particularly, the
older person is either depicted
as an absurd ninny who dances a
jig whenever the product ad
vertised is in sight, or as a
mean, selfish witch who won't
let .Junior have the tov/candv
that he'll absolutely die without.
It is a portrayal which has no
basis in reality, but is ironically
one of the most powerful in
fluences upon society's view of
the elderly.
On the whole, the senior

citizen is not treated as a worth
while. contributing member of
society, and it is not difficult to
see how the media reinforces
such an unfavorable image of
the elderly. One of the most sig
nificant dangers of the media
stereotype of the elderly is the
effect which such a stereotype
has on children, who are now
consuming an average of nearly
six hours of television a day.
They are presented with mul
titudinous images of the "gid
dy" or the "scolding" old per
son Impressions are formed
which can only be partially cor
rected through a child's actual
experience with the elderly.
Sadly, this experience has be
come more and more limited
with the disintegration of the ex
tended family. Furthermore,
childhood experience with the
elderly is likely to become even
more scarce as couples favor
waiting a longer period after
marriage before having chil
dren. thereby spacing out the
generations even further.
Evidence of hostility to the
elderly is not only seen in tele
vision. For example, there was
the issue of Reagan's age which
was inevitably manipulated in

the campaign Ironically, the in
coming administration is as
sociated with a movement to cut
social programs, many of which
benefit the elderly. Senior
citizens have had to fight for a
right to work. Even the ability
of the senior to enjoy a fulfilling
sex life has been questioned.
This is the time of the year
when many of us associate with
large family gatherings. It's
good to remember that Grand
ma and Grandpa and older
aunts, uncles and cousins are
part of a larger senior popu
lation. Attitudes and legislation
concerning the elderly are not
exclusive of the older people
who are close to us.
More than anything, this
should be an impetus for us to
seek out and attempt change,
whether in the media's
portrayal of the elderly, or our
own conceptions of the senior
citizen. Perhaps not every older
person is a Santa Claus but most
are worth knowing beyond a
stereotype.
