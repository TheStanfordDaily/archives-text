## The 						advantage in being a woman 
### 
In trying to dissect the con
voluted logic of Leah Halper's
latest column (Daily, Dec 4) I
was astounded by the hypocrit
ical indictments which Halper
makes against "white males "
She begins by proudly pro
claiming that.". . It is danger
ous to speak in generalities."
but she then very neatly pro
ceeds to say that when conflicts
build white men as a group may
be held responsible. Not only is
this statement prejudiced and
incorrect, but it shows that
Halper evidently chose to be
"dangerous" and speak in gen
eralities.
Halper speaks of the reaf
firmation of the great white
male who is "aborning in North
America." One of her rather
feeble attempts to illustrate this

reaffirmation of the so-called
great white male is that Presi
dent-elect Reagan prefers to fill
his cabinet with white men. One
must recognize that our country
is in a most critical period and
Reagan, in preparing to lead
this country, is prudently sur
rounding himself with some of
the most competent minds in
the nation. It is myopic on
Halper's part to assume that
these men are being chosen
solely for their color. Does
Halper seriously believe that
Reagan sits down and says.
"Hmm, what white male can I
put in my cabinet?" Mr. Re
agan. contrary to what Halper
may think, is going to choose the
man who is best qualified for the
job and not the man with the
darkest tan. Halper. for some

unknown reason, is surprised
that the men being considered
for cabinet positions are now
powerful corporate executives.
Why is she surprised? I suggest
that Halper take some Political
Science courses.
Halper reaches the zenith of
hypocrisy when she attacks
"white-male" institutions, on
the basis that "white males"
maintain them, and then pro
ceed to patronize them. Con
sider that she is getting an
education. I think, at an institu
tion established bv the very type
of person she condemns: a white
male millionaire.
Furthermore, one can only
assume when Halper says.
"Privilege which has amassed
and solidified for centuries can
not be shucked in a generation
or two." that she does not in
clude herself as "one of those
privileged people." Well dear,
you'd better wake-up to the fact
that being at Stanford makes
YOU one of the most privileged
people in the entire world. (I
Kuess this is mute testimony to
how the white male society has
oppressed you. i.e., by providing
vou with such an opportunity.)
It is somewhat interesting to
note the perpetual mention of
what Halper would do if she
were a man. For instance, she
say. "If I were a white man I. . .
would be shuddering at the Ku
Klux Klan's growing ap
peal. ..." Does this mean that
since Halper is a woman she

does not deplore the "growing
appeal" of the KKKÂ°
Halper then proceeds to
threaten men. She says that
those who aren t "obviously
working for equity might." in
hard times, bear the brunt of
others' anger
Halper contends that being a
white male brings advantages,
but not once does she enumerate
these advantages nrft- does she
elaborate on whether these ad
vantages are exclusive to
"white males." I doubt that
they are.
In Halper's obsession with
male superiority I resent the
fact that Halper generalizes
about the feelings of women.
According to Halper's articles,
as a non-white woman I should
feel quite oppressed and inferior
because I live in a white male
society. Well I have news for
Halper. Some women don't have
a neurotic need to attack men.
Some women don't feel op
pressed. In fact, some women
find that being a woman is quite
an advantage. Unfortunately it
is antagonistic, misguided
women who make men afraid of
the women's movement.
If Halper weren't so serious I
would find her columns quite
amusing. However, racism,
prejudice, and hypocrisy cannot
be taken lightly. One can only
hope that Halper's type of ig
norance is limited to Halper.
