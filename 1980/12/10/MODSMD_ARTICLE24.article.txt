## What happened to equal justice? 
### 
The clock above the
"Restrooms" sign said 2:15
when I sat underneath it at the
end of the bar. I often come to
this cafe for a late-night helping
of pancakes and contemplation
Lisa wasn't around so I bor
rowed the first page of the sec
ond section of last Saturday's
San -Jose Mercury from the guy
next to me.
Before I ordered. I noticed a
stocky 30-vear-old gentleman
enter the restaurant and slide
behind me to the telephone. He
stood with his back to me while
dialing, but either his straight
red beard or his rumpled rugby
shirt caught my eye.
He asked for the number ot
Santa Clara County Transit then
looked at me. forcing me to spin
around and notice the headline.
"Drug Charges Unlikely for
Pastorini." the Oakland
Raiders' injured first-string
quarterback.
When he began, "Hello, I've
been having a problem with bus
drivers not picking me up for
sleeping on the bus." he struck a

familiar chord. I grabbed a
napkin and tried to scribble
down his end of the conversa
tion Fearing that he would
sense mv purpose and feel self
conscious. I pretended to refer
to the Pastorini story. The
phone conversation and the arti
cle created a collage which re
minded me of Simon and Gar
funkel's "Silent Night."
"I've been getting trouble for
a whole year now. I go down eve
ry month to buy a day pass. But I
got those drivers on the 22 route
whodon'tpick meup ." (Pause.)
"Well. veah. I mean. I go to
sleep. I sometimes don't finish
the job I'm doing until midnight
and it sometimes takes me two
hours to get home."
I'astorini's Porsche . . . was
pulled over for speeding about
!):25 p.m. Thanksf>ivinn Day in
Cupertino. He teas traveling
south on Foothill Houlevard
near St evens Creek Houlevard at
till to 65 mph in a .it) mph zone,
according to Lt. Steve Kriss.
"Nine times out of 10 I'm
awake when they come up to me
but thev don't even ask meif I'm

awake. They just grab me and
say. 'You sleeping again?'
That's not really fair, is it? To
grab a guv and not even give him
a chance if he's awake?"
Another deputy tooh
I'astorini to sheriff's head
quarters to pay an outstanding
SX:j traffic warrant for a pre
vious speeding incident.
.•1 deputy found a black vial
later determined to contain
cocaine residue on the quar
terback during a pat-down
search.
"I've even had a policeman
arrest me on the bus at one of
the stations. And now the
drivers don't even pick me up at
night."
I'astorini paid the $Ki for the
earlier speeding ticket at sher
iff's headquarters and teas set
free.
"They tell me I ride the bus
all night because I don't have a
home but I don't ride the bus all
night And people who buy a day
pass could ride all day and all
night if they wanted as long as
they acted okay. I've got a right
to public safety! Not to be left in

the cold for an hour by those bus
drivers."
. . . authorities talked Friday
as if the case is likely to he
dropped because they believe
the cocaine probably teas seized
improperly.
"If I wanna lodge a complaint
about it, I can lodge a com
plaint. (pause) What I'm sup
posed to do about it. see my law
yer?"
Haiders head coach Tom
/•'lores leas upset about public
ity over the incident. 'I'm con
cerned, ' he said Friday. The
matter will be handled in a
private manner. '
"Well I'm going to do that
thing where you pay a dime and
get a 10-minute consultation
with a lawyer. The point is. I'm
supposed to be able to ride the
bus."
'Our security department
icill cheek leith local authorities
and take it from there, said
Fete Abitante, NFL public re
lations officer.
