I must say I was moved by
Leah Halper's searing article
"White Males Have Advan
tage" (Daily, Dec. 4.) It
thoughtfully probed the para
mount dilemma facing all white
males in the future. We would do
well to heed Halper 's advice and
acknowledge all of the unwar
ranted advantages showered
upon us since birth and act to
erase them.
I. for one. have recognized the
issue for months and have done
something about it. Every
morning I look in the mirror and
sneer. "You undeserving
caucasian." whereupon I pull
out a bullwhip and flog myself
for. oh. 20 minutes or so. After
that I leaf through my subscrip
tion of M.s., and contemplate the

perpetution of inequality by Big
Business. Such thought usually
provokes an outburst of dart
throwing at my poster of the Ex
xon building.
On the social front, any time
someone makes a sexist com
ment at a party (i.e. "Wanna
beer?") I am quick to point out
the ugly implications of their
ways: "I am a white male. You
offered me a beer for my con
sumption pleasure. Beer is bot
tled in breweries. Women are
stereotyped as brewery work
ers. (I make a deft allusion to
I,arcrnc and Shirley.) There
fore you imply that women
should sweat just to please me
. . . you pig!"
Furthermore. I have resolved
to reject any lucrative job offers
which mav come mv way for

they may be based not on meri
tocracy. but by virtue of my
gender. Instead. I will become a
stenographer. In doing so, I
hope to contribute in my own lit
tle way to sexual equality.

I was reading my chemistry
the other day when I discovered
how interesting my pen was. It's
one of those four colored pens
that people love to click in large
lecture classes. No, I wouldn't
buy one of the Godawful things
— I found it.
So here I am with this pen and
when I unscrew the cap there
are four colored tubes inside.
But what's even more fascinat

ing is that some of the tubes
aren't as full as the others. I
mean, who uses green, right 9
I can even click the green but
ton and push the green tube out
into the open as far as it can go
— and I still can't see where the
ink ends and the air in the tube
begins God only knows. It's an
awful thought really: all that in
finity of green and who's going
to use it?
The red tube is far less full
than the blue, and nearly as
empty as the black, all of which
is puzzling to me. having defi
nite blue-black leanings
I mean, I'd put red right up
there with green This pen must
have belonged to a professor or
teaching assistant before me.
