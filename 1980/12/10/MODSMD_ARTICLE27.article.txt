# Schultz reconsidered for secretary of state

Washington (AP) â€” Gen. Alexander
Haig's chances to be secretary of state
seem to be fading as Ronald Reagan looks
at the prospect of starting his presidency
with a rehash of Watergate, the scandal
that cost Richard Nixon his job. sources
said Monday.
"The question is whether or not they are
willing to start out their administration by
bringing all the old stuff from Watergate
back into it." said one source close to the
Reagan transition effort who asked not to
be identified.
Haig. who as White House chief of staff
played a central role in the final days of Nix
on's presidency, was cited last week by
sources as Reagan's leading choice to be
secretary of state.
However, strong political opposition then
built against Haig. Criticism of the former
NATO commander came from liberals who
criticized his roles in the Watergate scandal
and the Vietnam War. and from con
servatives who distrust his links 'to former

Secretary of State Henrv Kissinger.
One transition source said Monday that
"it was virtually all over for Haig" and that
a decision was likely soon eliminating him
from contention for the job.
Concern in the Reagan camp about Haig
has revived interest in Nixon's Treasury
secretary. George Shultz. who was seen as a
leading candidate to head the State Depart
ment until late last month when he
withdrew from consideration.
Sources also said Nixon's budget direc
tor. Caspar Weinberger, who appears in
line to become defense secretary, could be
shifted to State if Reagan does not offer the
job to Haig or Shultz.
Putting Weinberger at State would make
Donald Rumsfeld, a defense secretary in
the Ford administration, a leading con
tender for the same position, one source
said.
Other Cabinet changes appear possible as
Reagan works to put together his adminis

tration's top leadership for the possible an
nouncement of at least some positions later
this week.
One source said Walter Wriston. chair
man of Citicorp, the nation's second-largest
bank, had been dropped from consideration
to be secretary of the Treasury, a post that
he seemed to have the inside track on last
week.
Conflict-of-interest questions that arose
from Wriston's $2.25 million in stock hold
ings at Citicorp became an insurmountable
obstacle to his heading the Treasury De
partment. the source said.
Citicorp has interests in federal loan
guarantees and the freeze on Iranian assets,
issues that Treasury is involved with.
Wriston's reported departure as a pros
pect for Treasury left Donald Regan, chair
man of the nation's biggest investment
firm. Merrill. Lynch & Co.. and Charles
Walker, former deputy treasury secretary
under Nixon, as the leading candidates for
the job.
