## Capitol hosts European Socialists 
### Washington Post 
Washington— The big guns of
the Socialist International came
to Ronald Reagan's neo
conservative Washington this
weekend to give moral support
to this country's struggling so
cialists. and the irony was in
escapable
In a city where even tepid lib
eralism feels out of favor in the
transition maneuvering, social
ists from both sides of the Atlan
tic gathered to discuss the
future of democratic socialism
in the Western world
Although welfare has
emerged as one of main
bugbears of the new American
right. Sweden's former prime
minister Olaf Palme talked of
rescuing the welfare state. With
Americans clamoring for lower
taxes and less public spending,
former Dutch prime minister
Joop den Uyl underscored the
need to maintain higher rates of
taxation and government expen
ditures While many in this
country wonder whether the un
ions are getting too powerful.
Britain's Tony Benn preached
about strengthening the labor
movement.
Still, the irony of the situation
failed to keep anyone from at
tending what is likely to go down
in the annals as one of the larg
est socialist gatherings in this
country in decades.
Nearly 2500 people jammed
the opening session Friday night
— and returned Saturday and
Sunday — and had to wait for the
conference supervisor, author
and activist Michael Har
rington. to make about 200
standees leave the room to com
ply with fire regulations.
"Of all the problems to
have." Harrington beamed.

"To have, in a United States
which just elected Ronald Re
agan. too many people at a so
cialists' meeting."
Few American leaders
One of the questions most
asked of the European socialist
leaders was why so many of
them bothered to come to such
an assembly in a country where
socialism is still considered
well out of the political main
stream: in addition to Benn.
Palme and Den Uyl. there were
such luminaries as West Ger
many's Willy Brandt. Francois
Mitterrand and Michel Rocard
of France and Felipe Gonzalez
of Spain
One often-expressed concern
among some of the Europeans
was that there were no Ameri
cans of similar stature — for in
stance. liberal Democrats such
as Sen Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) — at the conference.
Kennedy, who declined an in
vitation to attend, reportedly
did see several of the socialist
leaders at a private dinner Sat
urday night.
Minneapolis Mayor Donald
Eraser took part in a workshop
and Rep Ronald Dellums (D-
Calif). was a keynote speaker.
Otherwise, the conference was
largely attended by academics,
trade unionists and students.

As for the liberal politicians
who did not show up. Interna
tional Association of Machinists
President William Winpisinger
said. "We can only advise our
missing friends, either lead or
follow, but get the hell out of the
way."
Monetarist failure anticipated
The conference was or
ganized bv Harrington's In
stitute for Democratic Social
ism. part of a small democratic
socialist movement in the Unit
ed States that is divided over
foreign policy and electoral
strategy — whether to work out
side of the Democratic Party or
to organize a union-based party
such as Britain's Labor Party.
Benn. a leader of the re
surgent left wing of that Labor
Party, spoke at a press briefing
of presenting a "useful rein
forcement" to the American so
cialists — "a sort of European
cavalry arriving at just the
right moment."
"We have a vested interest in
seeing what the policies of the
new U.S. administration will
be." Benn said, adding that he
thought a Reagan adminis
tration likely to follow in the
monetarist footsteps of British
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher would encounter seri
ous problems, and that the fail

ure of the new conservatism
would lead to fertile ground for
the socialist alternative.
Besides stressing solidarity
with their socialist brothers and
sisters and making socialism a
respectable word in political
conversations in a country that
never fully recovered from the
McCarthy era. it Cvas clear that
the European Socialists were
concerned with continuing their
recent commitment to broaden
their influence from Europe to
the Americas and the Third
World.
A recently formed Socialist
International committee
headed bv Gonzalez and includ
ing Brandt. Palme and Har
rington met in private Saturday
to discuss support of leftist
parties in Nicaragua. El
Salvador and elsewhere in Cen
tral America.
The European Socialists have
disagreed with the Carter ad
ministration about which
groups to support in Central
America, and some of them will
be meeting Monday with State
Department officials to discuss
their differences. Bernt
Carlsson. the International's
general secretary, said Sunday.
"We are convinced the U.S. poli
cy is wrong."

socialist movement in the Unit

foreign policy and electoral
strategy — whether to work out
side of the Democratic Party or
to organize a union-based party
such as Britain's Labor Party.
Benn. a leader of the re
surgent left wing of that Labor
Party, spoke at a press briefing
of presenting a "useful rein
forcement" to the American so
cialists — "a sort of European
cavalry arriving at just the
right moment."
"We have a vested interest in
seeing what the policies of the
new U.S. administration will
be." Benn said, adding that he
thought a Reagan adminis
tration likely to follow in the
monetarist footsteps of British
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher would encounter seri
ous problems, and that the fail

ure of the new conservatism
would lead to fertile ground for
the socialist alternative.
Besides stressing solidarity
with their socialist brothers and
sisters and making socialism a
respectable word in political
conversations in a country that
never fully recovered from the
McCarthy era. it Cvas clear that
the European Socialists were
concerned with continuing their
recent commitment to broaden
their influence from Europe to
the Americas and the Third
World.

emerged as one of main
bugbears of the new American

rescuing the welfare state. With

about strengthening the labor

Nearly 2500 people jammed
the opening session Friday night
— and returned Saturday and
Sunday — and had to wait for the
conference supervisor, author
and activist Michael Har

"Of all the problems to
have." Harrington beamed.

"To have, in a United States
which just elected Ronald Re
agan. too many people at a so
cialists' meeting."
Few American leaders
One of the questions most
asked of the European socialist
leaders was why so many of
them bothered to come to such
an assembly in a country where
socialism is still considered
well out of the political main
stream: in addition to Benn.
Palme and Den Uyl. there were
such luminaries as West Ger
many's Willy Brandt. Francois
Mitterrand and Michel Rocard
of France and Felipe Gonzalez
of Spain
One often-expressed concern
among some of the Europeans
was that there were no Ameri
cans of similar stature — for in
stance. liberal Democrats such
as Sen Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) — at the conference.
Kennedy, who declined an in
vitation to attend, reportedly
did see several of the socialist
leaders at a private dinner Sat
urday night.
Minneapolis Mayor Donald
Eraser took part in a workshop
and Rep Ronald Dellums (D-
Calif). was a keynote speaker.
Otherwise, the conference was
largely attended by academics,
trade unionists and students.

As for the liberal politicians
who did not show up. Interna
tional Association of Machinists
President William Winpisinger
said. "We can only advise our
missing friends, either lead or
follow, but get the hell out of the
way."
