# Demos call for new party head
## 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — More than 100 Democratic
House and Senate members joined Sunday in call
ing for the election of a new party chairman who
will concentrate on organizing and fund raising
while remaining neutral in the contest for the 1984
presidential nomination.
The 29 senators and 112 representatives, mak
ing up a rough geographic and ideological sample
of their party, made their views known in a letter
to John White, outgoing chair of the Democratic
National Committee. Their statement reflected a
surge of interest in the Democratic Party struc
ture among Capitol Hill Democrats in the wake of
the sweeping Republican victories at the polls last
month.
"The fact that over 125 congressional Demo
crats have joined in this effort is a very positive
signal." said Ohio Rep. Don Pease, who together
with Montana Sen Max Baucus. acted as spokes
persons for the group.
In recent years most Democratic members of
Congress took little direct interest in the ac
tivities of the national committee probably pre
ferring to deal with their own political goals and
problems.
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Commit
tee has lagged far behind the Republican National
Committee in providing financial and political
support for its candidates. And this has caused ap
prehension among Democrats who will seek re
election in 1982.
Re-election worries
"No one has more at stake than we do." the let
ter said "We believe that Senate and House mem
bers will bear the brunt of the GOP attack in 1982.

We urge that the Democratic congressional dele
gation be given the strongest possible voice in the
selection of a new Democratic chairman."
The party's new chair should have no binding
ties to 1984 presidential aspirants nor any im
mediate political ambitions of his own, according
to the standards outlined in the letter.
The letter also urged that the new chair should
be committed to a long-term direct mail fund
raising program and to cooperating closely with
congressional campaign committees in state
Democratic parties.
State leaders
The letter was released amid a flurry of activi
ty bv other Democratic groups. About 15 of the na
tion's 27 Democratic governors met Monday in
Annapolis. Md.. to discuss the party's chair
manship and their relationship with the incoming
Reagan administration.
On Tuesday, the chairmen of the Democratic
state parties met in Washington to consider their
role in the party's future. Also meeting here on
Tuesday was the Democratic Party executive
committee, to make formal plans for the election
of a new chair by the full Democratic National
Committee, which is expected to take place in
February.
White, who was President Jimmy Carter's
choice for the chairmanship, announced last
month that he would not seek re-election to the
post he has held since January 1978. White's sup
port of Carter in his battle for renomination
against Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
embittered many Kennedy supporters.
