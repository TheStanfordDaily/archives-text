# Kennedy wants DNA summit

Warning that recombinant DNA re
search at Stanford and other univer
sities could lead to serious conflicts of
interest. President Donald Kennedy
Sunday urged scientists to arrange a
summit conference to discuss the im
plications of commercialization of
gene-splicing discoveries.
In a speech delivered at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, Kennedy said
scientists should consider calling a
special meeting to deal with the with
the "rush to proprietary control" of
recombinant DNA research
Kennedy referred to the proposed
conference as "Asilomar II."
In 1975. at the first Asilomar con
ference scientists drew up a set of re
search guidelines to ensure that gene
splicing experiments would not en
danger the public.
Although most of the original safety
concerns have been resolved, Ken
nedy spoke of new issues that will have
to be confronted as scientists establish
ties with corporations utilizing gene
splicing technology for commercial

gain
According to Kennedy "the like
lihood of commercial-scale success
now seems very high."
For example, when Genentech of
South San Francisco issued stock two
months ago the price per share shot up
from $35 to $89 in less than 90 minutes.
"A variety of ethical strains are ap
pearing in the fabric of genetic re
search." Kennedy said. "The task of
developing a new set of principles gov
erning how individual scientists
should act in the face of these new
commercialization incentives is . . .
up to the scientists themselves."
Among the problems already ap
parent. Kennedy noted these:
— Scientists are more reluctant to
share and exchange prepublication in
formation freely.
— While commercialization incen
tives may increase the total amount of
recombinant research being done,
they have also led to limitations on full
disclosure, thereby hindering young
investigators and graduate students.
— More importantly, "the fragile
network of informal communication
that characterizes every especially
active field (of research) is liable to
rupture" by proprietary interests.
— Further pressure toward in
dustrial consulting can be expected
"Basic scientists who have previously
consulted little or not at all are sud
denly seeing potential applications
being worked on bv firms using their
systems."
Kennedy also warned of potential
conflicts of interest that will have to
be dealt with as the University begins
to reap profits from scientific dis
coveries that are patented
He emphasized that potential con
flicts of interest "command one to
proceed with great caution to any
level of involvement at which the Uni
versity has a directive role or an equi
ty position, or both, in a corporation
profiting from the result of faculty re

search.
If the university were to havestrong
equity commitments to one faculty re
search program and not to others, for
example, it would create the ap
pearance of giving special preference
in faculty appointments and promo
tions or in the allocation of University
facilities
But as long as these potential con
flicts can be successfully dealt with.
Kennedy suggested that universities
have a right to reap financial gain.
"The arguments in favor of this
position are strong," Kennedy said.
"The financial return is there, and
someone is going to get it ... . The
universities have, after all. sponsored
the research and nurtured the climate
in which it took place, so a share
should go to them in order to replenish
their capacity to do more."
