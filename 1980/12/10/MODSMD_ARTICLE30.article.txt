They dug latrines, weeded oil palm fields with
machetes and endured low-protein diets.
But they also made fast friendships and gained
a sense of the life and culture of a developing
African country
The country was Ghana and the volunteer work
ers were juniors Trish Skillman and Logan
Brenzel They were among five Stanford students
who journeyed to Africa last summer with Opera
tion Crossroads Africa, a private, non-profit com
munity development agency.
The others included Peter Moulton. who served
in Mali and stayed in Africa this quarter to travel,
and recent graduates Cathy Englehart and Lorrie
Gavin who went to The Gambia, but were un
available for interview.
Both Skillman and Brenzel are studying human
biology, and both said the summer reaffirmed
their plans to pursue academic and career in
terests in health care in developing nations.
"It was the best thing I've ever done," said
Brenzel. who was in a group of 13 Americans
which provided health care to several villages in
Ghana's interior The team set-up a small clinic in
the small jungle village of Akobima. examined
some 900 villagers in the Volta region and assisted
at the Akasombo hospital on Lake Volta.
i was mostly doing first aid. dispensing drugs
and giving physical examinations — it was really
exciting." said Brenzel
In Akobima. (where her group dug the latrine)
the group's classes on hygiene, first aid and con
traception at the local "chief's palace" became a
major social event, she said. Despite the vil
lagers' positive response to the classes, she re
alized. after instructing them to boil their water
to eliminate parasites, that "most of them can't
afford another pot."
To illustrate the extent of parasitic diseases.
Brenzel told of a village where the team found
nearly the whole population to be infected by
schistosomiasis of the bladder. She also described
the Akasombo hospital as "the best in the coun
try." where four doctors and a dozen nurses saw
300 patients per day.
Skillman. who worked in a group of 35 Ghana
ians and eight Americans on construction and
community development projects, was also
struck by the economic hardships and lack of
health care in the West African nation.
Yet she was equally struck by the generosity,
warmth and community spirit of Ghana's people.
"Times are hard, but they wouldn't get upset

about things." she said "For example, whenever
our transportation broke down and we were
stranded, people always invited us in (for a meal)
even though they had little to eat."
Ixjcal people always helped out with the group's
projects, which included building an addition to a
sch(*)l in Kumasi and weeding the palm fields in
the village of Sewfie Amafie. she said
Skillman said she encountered no racial preju
dice or anti-American sentiments among Ghana
ians. And. although her work group was "harmo
nious." she said that when racial tension occa
sionally emerged, it was usually among the Amer
icans.
Since work usually ended bv early afternoon,
the volunteers had plenty of time to get to know
the local culture Skillman told of frequent per
formances of music, dance and drumming She
also said she once consulted a "priestess" who
served as "a kind of village psychologist."
Brenzel. who lived with a family which spoke no
Knglish. said communication was always dif
ficult. "but a smile breaks all barriers." Although
she initially sensed resistance among older, more
traditional people toward the volunteers and their
medical techniques, she said the villagers even
tually came to trust the team
"They were really loving and not afraid to
share." she said. She told how she was once awak
ened at 4 a m by the four-part harmony of the vil
lage drama-choir. "I thought I was in heaven."
she said.
Fle-adapting to American society turned out to
be harder than adapting to Ghanaian society for
both students — for example, upon return.
Brenzel was struck by "the sex and violence in ad
vertising." Skillman said not having to wear a
watch all summer was "a nice difference from
Stanford."
Through their African experiences, both stu
dents seem to have gained some new perspectives
on the world.
"I know how*powerless a whole group of people
can be to political and economic superpowers,"
said Brenzel. She said the summer has led her to
reevaluate her values, friendships and "material
istic" drugs.
Skillman commented, "I don't see the Third
World as a geographical place, but as a level of ec
onomic standing and health that a lot of people in
this country have "

made close friendships during her eight-week stay.
They dug latrines, weeded oil palm fields with
machetes and endured low-protein diets.
But they also made fast friendships and gained
a sense of the life and culture of a developing
African country
The country was Ghana and the volunteer work
ers were juniors Trish Skillman and Logan
Brenzel They were among five Stanford students
who journeyed to Africa last summer with Opera
tion Crossroads Africa, a private, non-profit com
munity development agency.
The others included Peter Moulton. who served
in Mali and stayed in Africa this quarter to travel,
and recent graduates Cathy Englehart and Lorrie
Gavin who went to The Gambia, but were un
available for interview.
Both Skillman and Brenzel are studying human
biology, and both said the summer reaffirmed
their plans to pursue academic and career in
terests in health care in developing nations.
"It was the best thing I've ever done," said
Brenzel. who was in a group of 13 Americans
which provided health care to several villages in
Ghana's interior The team set-up a small clinic in
the small jungle village of Akobima. examined
some 900 villagers in the Volta region and assisted
at the Akasombo hospital on Lake Volta.
i was mostly doing first aid. dispensing drugs
and giving physical examinations — it was really
exciting." said Brenzel
In Akobima. (where her group dug the latrine)
the group's classes on hygiene, first aid and con
traception at the local "chief's palace" became a
major social event, she said. Despite the vil
lagers' positive response to the classes, she re
alized. after instructing them to boil their water
to eliminate parasites, that "most of them can't
afford another pot."
To illustrate the extent of parasitic diseases.
Brenzel told of a village where the team found
nearly the whole population to be infected by
schistosomiasis of the bladder. She also described
the Akasombo hospital as "the best in the coun
try." where four doctors and a dozen nurses saw
300 patients per day.
Skillman. who worked in a group of 35 Ghana
ians and eight Americans on construction and
community development projects, was also
struck by the economic hardships and lack of
health care in the West African nation.
Yet she was equally struck by the generosity,
warmth and community spirit of Ghana's people.
"Times are hard, but they wouldn't get upset

about things." she said "For example, whenever
our transportation broke down and we were
stranded, people always invited us in (for a meal)
even though they had little to eat."
Ixjcal people always helped out with the group's
projects, which included building an addition to a
sch(*)l in Kumasi and weeding the palm fields in
the village of Sewfie Amafie. she said
