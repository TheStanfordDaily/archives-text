## NASA tests future Jupiter probe 
### Jennifer Seymour 
To many people, looking to
Jupiter instead of a local TV sta
tion for the weather seems pret
ty far-fetched
However, weather is ul
timately what researchers at
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's (NASA >
Ames Research Center hope to
learn about from their Galileo
Probe Carrier and Probe, which
is to be launched to Jupiter in
March 1984
This exploratory vessel con
sists of a carrier and at
mospheric probe The carrier is
to transport the probe to Jupiter
where the probe itself will be
dropped into the as-vet unseen
layers of Jupiter's thick at
mosphere
Traveling at a speed of 100,000
mph, the shuttle is expected to
reach Jupiter in July 1987. 1200
days after departure.
The venture is a costly and
time-consuming one: NASA is
presently negotiating a $40 mil
lion contract with the Space and
Communications Group of
Hughes Aircraft Co.. which in
volves work on the Carrier
alone.
Despite this expense, the U.S.
government is still willing to
fund the Galileo Project. It is
one of NASA's only aeronautical
research programs still receiv
ing government support.
Clearly, then, the govern
ment views information to be
gleaned from the depths of
Jupiter's red eye as sufficiently
valuable . . . Why?
For one thing. Jupiter seems
to be true stardust: scientists
believe it is composed of the ori
ginal material from which the

stars formed.
Jupiter also contains two
thirds of all the solar system's
planetary matter, much of
which we know little about
Hut most important is the tur
bulent atmosphere which cloaks
Jupiter Thought to be layers of
ammonia. ammonia
hvdrosulfide and water clouds,
this envelope reaches pressures
up to 15 times greater than the
earth's atmosphere.
From the probe scientists
hope to gain a vertical profile of
Jupiter's atmosphere, showing
its composition and circulatory
patterns from this probing Such
information should allow scien
tists not only better under
standing of how Jupiter's mys
terious weather works, but also
a guess at what atmospheric
and planetary forces paint this
massive body such brilliant col
ors.
"We have no vertical meas
urements at all of Jupiter; we
have some photos of cloud types
and cloud cover, but nothing
that's 3-D," says NASA's Peter
Waller. "There are some really
complex fluid mechanics going
on. driving that red spot. If we
could understand other planet's
weather circulation — like
Jupiter's — we could get some
real insights into, our own
earth's weather."
Considering these violent at
mospheric conditions, it's no
surprise that the Galileo probe
is receiving extensive testing.
Tomorrow NASA will conduct
the third and last of the para
chute system flight tests at the
Naval Weapons Center Test
Range in China Lake, Califor
nia.

The parachute is actually a
two-fold mechanism, consisting
of a 3.7-foot diameter pilot chute
and a 12.5-foot diameter main
chute This unit is responsible
for slowing the probe from its
traveling speed of 100.000 mph
to its atmospheric data-gather
ing velocity of a few hundred
mph In deceleration forces,
that's a pull 400 times greater
than the force of gravity.
Tests will involve dropping
the parachute with a 633-pound
cylindrical dacron body from
48.400 feet up The plane drop
ping this tester will be traveling
693 mph. just faster than the
speed of sound
The resistance demanded to
slow this weight is actually 50
percent greater than the puli the
parachute will enocunter in
Jupiter's cloud layers, but extra
precautions are being taken.
Tests are to assure proper chute
opening and sufficient strength
and accurate construction of the
parachute structure.
If the parachute meets all

performance standards, the
chute-testing will then be com
pleted. save for the whole-sys
tem "dress rehearsal" sched
uled for 1982
Passing this, the spin-stabi
lized nuclear-powered Galileo
Probe and Probe Carrier will
then be ready to blast off in
March 1984. destination Jupiter
Once at Jupiter, the probe
mechanism will descend into
the atmosphere, utilizing six
different instruments to take
direct samples A parabolic dish
antenna will read the findings.
This same dish will also relay
the data to earth, with another,
despun antenna Data will be
transmitted "live" as well as
recorded for playback
Scientists do not know exactly
what they will learn from this,
especially in light of the startl
ing finds from Saturn. Whatever
is discovered, however, will at
least reduce the vast sea of un
knowns currently surrounding
the solar system's biggest
planet. Jupiter.
