# TB strain defies treatment

### Washington Post 
Washington — New strains of
tuberculosis that defy treat
ment by the usual drugs have
begun to invade urban com
munities in the United States,
according to doctors at the
Presbyterian Hospital of New
York and Columbia University.
Tuberculosis, an infectious
pulmonary disease, has been
successfully treated with anti
biotics for decades and has been
held down to a small number of
cases in this country. But while
the incidence of tuberculosis na
tionwide is still declining, said
Dr Harold Neu of Columbia
University, it is increasing in
immigrant communities around
the country
Though there is little danger
to the country at large, patients
in immigrant communities are
dying of the disease once again
for the first time in decades.
Neu said that incidence of the
disease also seems to be in
creasing in other areas of the
country, such as the large immi
grant communities in Califor
nia.
Neu said the situation is a mi
nor threat to those outside the
immigrant communities be
cause the tubercle bacillus, the
cause of the disease, is very
slow-growing: is not a hardy
bug. and dies quickly in the air.

The drug-resistant strains ap
parently are even less hardy So
tuberculosis is usually passed
'through coughing) only in the
most crowded, enclosed condi
tions
Even when the disease is con
tracted. it is normally not dif
ficult to treat, though the pa
tient must take anti-tubercular
drugs steadily for a year or two
to assure that all the bacilli are
killed
"But recently we have had
one woman who died here." Neu
said, "and another man who had
to have part of his lung removed
to get rid of the bacteria there —
a procedure we haven't done
since the 19505."
In both cases, the patients ap
parently had been diagnosed as

having tuberculosis some years
before but stopped taking their
medicine before all the bacilli
were killed.
' What happens is that the
bacilli left over are the
strongest, most resistant ones."
Thus the most resistant of the
tubercular bacilli grow inside
bodies, and can then be passed
to others in a community.
To combat the growing prob
lem. the doctors recommend
not only giving the two most
powerful (although more ex
pensive) anti-tubercular drugs
immediately in many cases of
immigrant tuberculosis, but
also conducting tests no longer
common to determine if the pa*
tient has a resistant tuber
culosis.
