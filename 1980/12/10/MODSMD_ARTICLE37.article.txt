# Lennon, Beatles led cultural revolution
## 
### Washington Post 
The first thing everyone saw
was hair.
The first thing everyone
heard was screaming:
On that Sunday night in Feb
ruary. 1964. Ed Sullivan un
locked the gates of inhibition
and unleashed The Beatles on an
American television audience
for the first time, and the pop
culture was never the same
The moment they went into
the "Oh yeah, I . . . " lyric of "I
Wanna Hold Your Hand"
marked the first shot of a social
and cultural revolution that was
to brand the '60s as a decade of
rapid, chaotic change. And it
was led by these four young men
from Liverpool called The
Beatles who, in turn, were led
by the wittiest, savviest. most
daring among them, John Len
non.
Lennon was the key to the cul
tural phenomenon that was The
Beatles, and the key to Lennon
was his rebellious desire always
to go beyond the norm, always
to push the limits outward, to
create a new style, a new ethic.
It went far beyond the hair, into
the psychedelic era of hallu
cinogenic drugs, into the con
templative era of transcen
dental meditation, into the pas
sive and ultimately active re
sistance of the anti-war move
ment during the Vietnam era.
And always at the point there
was Lennon. Lennon with the
smoked glasses. Lennon with
the sage's beard.
The Beatles style took the
postwar baby boom and molded
it, shaped it and defined it to the
beat of their records. With eve
ry new album, they moved it
along. From Meet the Beatles
to Rubber Soul, to Sgt. Pepper.
to Revolver to Abbey Road.
Such was their hold on the youth
of the '60s that virtually every
thing they said or did im
mediately became gospel.
There was one key phrase,
from "A Day in the Life" which

was their message and their fon
dest wish "I'd love to turn you
on."
— Hair. Gimme it down to
there, shoulder length and long
er Beatle wigs. The Beatle cut.
E very body stopped going to
barbers.
The Stoned Generation tuned
in. turned on and dropped out of
normal 9-to-5 life to sit in front
of stereo sets and groove on The
Beatles. They studied the lyrics
for subliminal drug messages.
Head shops, catering to the drug
paraphernalia business,
flourished.
— Meditation. It may have
been George Harrison who
found it first among The
Beatles, but Lennon and Paul
McCartney gave it the certifica
tion it required to seep down
into the followers. Sitar sounds
found their way into the albums.
The Beatles went to India to
study with Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, and they came back wear
ing strange clothing and
articulating strange thoughts.
Within weeks, every kid on the
block seemed to be sitting
crosslegged on the floor and lost
in space.
— -Fashion. More than just
hair, it was the whole look. It
was jeans, an explosion of jeans.
When The Beatles finally shed
those silly suits that their man
ager. Brian Epstein, wanted
them to wear to make them ap
pear more sanitized and less
threatening to mass audiences,
they got into jeans and tie-dyed
T-shirts, and an era of casu
alness began.
— Politics. It started slowly.
At first, there was only the mu
sic. But when it hit, it hit hard.
And again Lennon was on the
point. He led The Beatles into
their anti-war phase, returning
his own Order of the Empire
medal, awarded The Beatles by
Queen Elizabeth. With what
was happening in Vietnam and
Biafra. he said he felt ashamed
to be British.

to Revolver to Abbey Road.
Such was their hold on the youth
of the '60s that virtually every
thing they said or did im
mediately became gospel.
There was one key phrase,
from "A Day in the Life" which

was their message and their fon
dest wish "I'd love to turn you
on."
— Hair. Gimme it down to
there, shoulder length and long
er Beatle wigs. The Beatle cut.
E very body stopped going to
barbers.
The Stoned Generation tuned
in. turned on and dropped out of
normal 9-to-5 life to sit in front
of stereo sets and groove on The
Beatles. They studied the lyrics
for subliminal drug messages.
Head shops, catering to the drug
paraphernalia business,
flourished.
— Meditation. It may have
been George Harrison who
found it first among The
Beatles, but Lennon and Paul
McCartney gave it the certifica
tion it required to seep down
into the followers. Sitar sounds
found their way into the albums.
The Beatles went to India to
study with Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi, and they came back wear
ing strange clothing and
articulating strange thoughts.
Within weeks, every kid on the
block seemed to be sitting
crosslegged on the floor and lost
in space.
— -Fashion. More than just
hair, it was the whole look. It
was jeans, an explosion of jeans.
When The Beatles finally shed
those silly suits that their man
ager. Brian Epstein, wanted
them to wear to make them ap
pear more sanitized and less
threatening to mass audiences,
they got into jeans and tie-dyed
T-shirts, and an era of casu
alness began.
— Politics. It started slowly.
At first, there was only the mu
sic. But when it hit, it hit hard.
And again Lennon was on the
point. He led The Beatles into
their anti-war phase, returning
his own Order of the Empire
medal, awarded The Beatles by
Queen Elizabeth. With what
was happening in Vietnam and
Biafra. he said he felt ashamed
to be British.
