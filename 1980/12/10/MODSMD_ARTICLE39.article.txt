# BUG ME

### 
Dear Hun Me,
Why are those new Marguerite buses
so bin, loud and smellv?
- S.Z.
According to John Pipkin of the Traf
fic Department, and John Syka, the stu
dent head of a committee which is eval
uating the shuttle service, the new buses
are the best available compromise
among aesthetics, economy, reliability,
and adherence to federal standards.
The government apparently required
that the replacements for the old.
smaller, open buses have wheelchair
lifts. The contractor who supplies the
buses wanted to protect his investment
in the lifts by installing them in a new,
durable, versatile, and economical vehi
cle. Syka said that the General Motors
buses were the only ones that the con
tractor was willing to purchase, and even
then requested that the University sign a
long-term leasing agreement. And
Pipkin said that they actually are on the

small side — 35 feet long, as opposed to 40
feet for the typical city bus.
The advantages of the new buses over
the old include their running on diesel
fuel instead of gasoline, greatly reduced
maintenance troubles, and safety. Fuel
and repair costs have been reduced, and
the service is more reliable. In addition,
the drivers don't have to worry that peo
ple might injure themselves by jumping
on or off the bus while it is moving, since
the single door at the front of the bus af
fords more control of passenger move
ment.
It is simply a shame that they can't be
more pleasing to the eye, nose and ear
Dear liux Me,
I Hue in Durand House on the Row.
Someone told me that the house teas
huilt in 1X92 and that it is the oldest
house on campus. Could you please ffiue
the history of the house?
- li.A .C.
After bugging the University

archivists on two rainy afternoons, and
receiving help for which I am most
grateful. I discovered that there is a good
explanation for this rumor, despite the
fact that it is probably wrong
Durand house was originally the home
of the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority, and
was renamed in 1944 after sororities
were banned. The house takes its name
from William Frederick Durand. who
was head of the mechanical engineering
department, a leading faculty member,
and a renowned aeronautics expert.
Durand had helped the first AO members
obtain their charter, and served as presi
dent of the corporation. When the house
became a university residence for wom
en. the chapter members were per
mitted to select its new name and hon
ored then-emeritus Professor Durand
Alpha Omicron Pi first occupied the
house in or about 1912. and it also appears
for the first time on maps of the Univer
sity in 1913. Thus it is likely that the
house was built at that time. Additional
evidence for this point is that the con
struction of University residences radi
ated westward down Lasuen St. (now
Mayfield) from the southwest corner of
the Quad, and didn't reach Dolores St.
(the location of Durand) until the early
1900s
What I'm not sure of is whether

Lathrop is the house that Chi Omega
moved into in 1915. The house looks much
different from early photographs of the
Chi Omega house, yet in 1944 Chi Omega
became Lathrop. and a picture from that
year shows a house which looks exactly
like the one we know today. So — was the
original house renovated or replaced?

One of the best parts of this job is the

got onto the subject of quirky phrases we

Dear liux Me,
I Hue in Durand House on the Row.
Someone told me that the house teas
huilt in 1X92 and that it is the oldest
house on campus. Could you please ffiue
the history of the house?

archivists on two rainy afternoons, and

Durand house was originally the home
of the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority, and
was renamed in 1944 after sororities
were banned. The house takes its name
from William Frederick Durand. who
was head of the mechanical engineering
department, a leading faculty member,
and a renowned aeronautics expert.
Durand had helped the first AO members
obtain their charter, and served as presi
dent of the corporation. When the house
became a university residence for wom
en. the chapter members were per
mitted to select its new name and hon
ored then-emeritus Professor Durand
Alpha Omicron Pi first occupied the
house in or about 1912. and it also appears
for the first time on maps of the Univer
sity in 1913. Thus it is likely that the
house was built at that time. Additional
evidence for this point is that the con
struction of University residences radi
ated westward down Lasuen St. (now
Mayfield) from the southwest corner of
the Quad, and didn't reach Dolores St.
(the location of Durand) until the early
1900s
What I'm not sure of is whether

Lathrop is the house that Chi Omega
moved into in 1915. The house looks much
different from early photographs of the
Chi Omega house, yet in 1944 Chi Omega
became Lathrop. and a picture from that
year shows a house which looks exactly
like the one we know today. So — was the
original house renovated or replaced?
