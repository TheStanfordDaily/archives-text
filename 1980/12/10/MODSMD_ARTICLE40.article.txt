High Court rules on jail terms
Washington — Prosecutors may seek stiffer sen
tences for convicted criminals they believe got off
too lightly, the Supreme Court Riled by a 5-4 vote
yesterday.
The justices split 6-3 in a separate ruling that po

N V arson-for-hire ring
When prosecutors first sought to appeal what
amounted to a one-vear sentence for the conviction,
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that al
lowing such an appeal would violate DiFrancesco's
constitutional protection against "double
jeopardy "
The appeals court struck down a federal law that
allowed prosecutors to appeal sentences in cases of
"dangerous special offenders."
But yesterday's decision reinstated the law and
discounted any constitutional problem "The double
jeopardv considerations that bar re-prosecution af
ter an acquittal do not prohibit review of a sen
tence." Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the
court's majority
The court's decision allows federal prosecutors to
make such appeals when sortie law specifically al
lows them to do so

gion.

friendship and praise for Brezhnev as a world states
man. Gandhi's message about non-interference was
regarded as a strong reference to the Soviet military

viet relations, prompted Soviet and Indian author
ities to shift the meeting to an indoor hall where it
was attended by about 1 000 invited guests The ori
ginally-announced outdoor location was the historic
Red Fort
The presence of militant Afghan exiles in the capi
tal forced the shift indoors on Soviet advice. Indian
officials said.

groups staged two anti-Soviet demonstrations Mon
dav, the dav of Brezhnev's arrival, and his motor

cade was diverted to avoid one of them
