# Professional vs. academic schools
## Minority graduate enrollments show imbalance 
### Doug Jehl 
The stream of minority graduate
students which supplies potential
Stanford professors is drying up. ac
cording to President Donald Kennedy.
In an informal discussion on "The
Black Presence at Stanford - ' recently
Kennedy suggested that the attrac
tiveness of the professions has kept
minority students out of academic
programs leading to masters and
Ph D. programs. As a result, he said,
there are fewer qualified minority
professorial candidates than there
once were.
The University "must find ways to
break the cycle" which has left "rela
tively empty pipelines leading to
academic positions." said Kennedy.
"Our first priority now is to in
crease graduate minority enrollment,
especially in Ph.D. programs, and to
do a more active, effective job of mi
nority faculty improvement." he said
"Unless we improve in those areas,
we are mortgaging our own future

supply (of minority faculty)," he said.
Minority enrollment in academic
graduate programs dropped more
than 50 percent this autumn from 78 to
37. while minorities starting pro
fessional programs in business, law.
and medicine rose from 72 to 77. The
lota\ is 25 percent below last year's
level, but the same as 1978 The total
minority graduate enrollment at the
University has declined steadilv since
1972.
Associate Dean of Graduate Studies
and Research Ed Eskelbar. who acts
as a graduate field recruiter for the
University, noted that before this year
the amount of interest in purely
academic versus professional schools
remained basically constant, with
slightly more interest in the pro
fessions He said the sudden change
this year may reflect a national trend
away from academic fields toward
those that provide job security. A law
yer will make much more money than
an academic and will enjoy a greater
degree of job security as well, he said
Bob Beyers, director of University
News and Publications, also said fi
nancial considerations are important
in the graduate students' choices.
"When a student finishes Stanford
or a comparable institution, he al
ready has some pretty good job of
fers.-' said Beyers. "If he follows the
typical pattern, he works for three
years, then goes to business school for
the next two When he finishes, he has
100 percent certain employment at a
starting salary of $30,000
"But if he goes toward academe, a
Ph.l), means five to seven years of
school, then an assistant pro
fessorship for six years at a salary in
the mid-$20.000 range if he's luckv."

Beyers said."After all that time, if he
is at an institution like Stanford, he
has onlv about a 50 percent chance of
being granted tenure."
Beyers said professorships them
selves are not very attractive, be
cause even the most esteemed pro
fessors earn relatively low salaries.
Previously, private industry offered
about 50 percent higher salaries than
universities, he said, but now. the
salaries are nearly 100 percent higher.
Kskelbar said when he meets poten
tial graduate applicants, job security
is their greatest concern "There is
frustration for someone who. say. re
ally enjoys philosophy, but is deeply
worried about ending up as a Ph D.
who can't earn a living."
Jean Fetter. Eskelbar's coun
terpart in the Office of Graduate Stud
ies md Research, expressed different
ideas about the reason behind the dc?
elining number of academically
oriented minority graduate students.
She said in an age of increasing ac
tivism. minorities will be interested in
entering a field in which they could
help minority communities. "One
could argue that,a doctor, lawyer, or
businessman could help thecommuni
tv more than a professor in an 'ivorv
tower" could." she said
Kskelbar. however, said as a
Chicano he disagrees with this
philosophy. He added that he rarely
hears that concern expressed in the
field, and that most prospective grad
uate students agree that academe is
neither an ivory tower' nor a
'monastery'.
There are many academic fields
through which one can contribute
directly to minority communities.
Kskelbar said. He cited sociology, his

tory. and political science as fields
which can have an impact on society
by affecting policy.
Cecilia Conrad, a graduate student
in economics and a member of the
Black Graduate Students Association,
cited financial reasons to explain the
attraction of minorities to pro
fessional schools. She said money is
especially important to minority stu
dents because they often have a very
small financial base to start with and
are often expected to support other
family members when they finish
school. Conrad also said the number of
fellowships aimed at assisting minor
ity students, such as those provided by
the Ford and Danforthe Foundation,
has declined greatly in recent years.
"If I hadn't gotten a fellowship."
Conrad commented, "there is no way
that I could have afforded grad school
at Stanford."
Another factor in her decision, she
said, was the number and quality of
minority faculty members in her de
partment.
Kskelbar said many minority stu
dents concerned with the stu
dent faculty relationship choose uni
versities because of the minority pro
fessors in their field.
Stanford hired no minority pro
fessors last year, but has made the
search for them a high priority this
year, according to Acting Provost Al
bert Hastorf. He said the University is
organizing an affirmative action com
mittee whose primary focus will be on
faculty recruitment The make-up of
this committee is as yet undecided.
Hastorf said, but once it\ is estab
lished. it will help monitor all the de
partments and schools in the Univer
sity.
