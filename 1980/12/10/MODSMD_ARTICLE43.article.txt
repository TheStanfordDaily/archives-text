and will condemn us in the eyes of his
tory."

civil rights cases and has never ac

sterdam's emphasis here. Meyers last
February said. "Today Stanford Law

the use of the simulation method of
clinical instruction, and Professor

authority in the field " Meyers also

practice skills, including trial and ap

Barbara Babcock, an associate pro
fessor in the Law School, said she is
certain Amsterdam's resignation "is
not anything that has to do with his ca
reer here." but that "she (Lois) would
have more opportunities somewhere
else."
