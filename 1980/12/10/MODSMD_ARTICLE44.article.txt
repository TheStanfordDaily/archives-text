### Robert Stone 
Christmas came early for the
San Francisco State Gators last
night as they got a present they
wanted very badly—a 66-64 win
over Stanford in women's
basketball at Maples Pavilion

Stanford, acknowledeged by
both head coaches as the physi
cally stronger team, suffered
from cold shooting i3B percent
from the floor i and defensive
lapses to hand the Division 111
Gators their second win in five

outings The Cardinals drop to
6-H
SFS head coach Emily Man
waring regarded the victory as
more than Stanford's give
away. however "We did it all
At half we even led in re
bounds. she said referring to
her pre game statement that re
bounding would be the key to the
game
I thought that they (Stan
ford > thought this was a
pushover game It's a very fine
team and Dotty (Stanford head
coach McCrea i is a good coach,
but you can't always leave it up
to the coach to get ready for
game." she added.
McCrea disagreed with the
assessment that her team was
overconfident "We were not
ready to play and it showed. It
was an extremely disappointing
loss I thought we conquered the
idea of not being prepared for
every game They (Stanford)
weren't mentally ready to play
and San Francisco State came
to play and came to win—and we
made their season." the coach
said
Stanford had an opportunity
to pull out the victory in the
waning minutes but wasn't able
to break out of its slump.
With a little more than five

minutes left in the game. Stan
turd tied the score at 58 when
guard Debi Gore drove down
court on a fast break lost her
defender with a move to her
right and sank an underhand
lavup.
The Cards inched closer to
victory but the (i itors hung on
Stanford hit one shot while SFS
scored two quick baskets After
the (latorstook a four point lead
on free throws (iore again
pulled the Cards within two The
guard drove up the middle of the
lane, and drew a foul, making
both free throws
Down by four again, center
Louise Smith connected on a
turnaround shot from the
middle of the lane with seven
seconds left, but it was all Stan
ford would score, as Smith's last
shot fell short with one second
left The referee blew his whis
tle as the rebound was tied up by
both teams but the game was
over
Throughout the game Stan
ford played well in spurts while
the Gators kept on swinging
The Cards opened up a quick 8-4
lead at the beginning of the
game and sealed off the inside
on defense, forcing the Gators
to resort to outside shots They

(Ik) so and soon took the lead
with six straight points
The rest of the first half saw
the lead change hands five
times, with the (iators opening
up a 22-17 margin at one point
The transition was awful,
they had too many layups."
McCrea said "We were jogging
hack on defense The fact is we
lost to a team that is not better
than we are " And. Stanford
gave the (lators an early, merry
Christmas
