## 
### Paula Ann McNerney 
After two months of gruel
ing practices, the Stanford's
women's crew club gave a
tremendous show at the
Christmas Regatta in Long
Beach Dec. 6. capturing two
firsts, a second, two thirds
and a sixth And they won de
spite having only 14
oarswomen make the trip.
Both first place efforts
came from the varsity side of
the team in the Women's
Eight and the Women's Four
with Coxswain events. In the
former, the Cardinals sped
down the 850-meter course in
three minutes flat, only 1 29
seconds ahead of the Long
Beach Rowing Association
boat. In the Women's Eight,
however, Stanford breezed
to a 12-second victory.
For their efforts in the
Women's Eight race, the
Cardinal team received the
first annual Koln Cup, an
award donated bv the West
German Olympic Crew
Team to the Regatta.
Stanford's varsity also
took third place in the Wom
en's Four with Coxswain
and. assisted by four Stan
ford male rowers, placed

second and third in the Mixed
Four event (a mixed four
boat contains two male and
two female rowers).
The Christmas Regatta
also afforded the Novice
oarswomen their first taste
of rowing competition. Un
fortunately. this portion of
the team was hit hard by a
transportation snafu. Only
half of the novices reached
Long Beach, while eight oth
ers and coach Tom Brown
had to return to the Univer
sity
The eight who did make it
to the Marine Stadium re
grouped and rowed them
selves through an elimina
tion heat and into the finals
They managed a sixth-place
finish, but were elated none
theless in consideration of
their circumstances and ex
perience.
In addition, the four men
who rowed from Stanford
also raced in the Men's Four
with Coxswain event. Un
fortunately the men received
a very questionable start and
were unable to recover, los
ing by one length and missing
out on qualifying for the
finals.
