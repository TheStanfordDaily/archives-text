While describing a recent San
Francisco 49ers' loss to the De
troit Lions, KSFO radio an
nouncer Lon Simmons poked fun
at the 49ers' offensive inep
titude. which was marked by in
terceptions. fumbles and penal
ties. "Now the 49ers are in trou
ble." Simmons remarked after
San Francisco gained
possession of the football.
"They have the ball ."
Simmons could well have
been describing the early-sea
son efforts of Stanford's men's
basketball team While playing
encouragingly well on defense,
the Cardinals have had difficul
ty executing their offense, as
their pair of losses in the
Midwest — 73-51 to Wyoming
and H9-58 to Marquette —
showed.
Stanford has amassed of
fensive statistics that more
befit a high school team than a
major college one In their first
three games, the Cards have
failed to score more than HO
points and shoot above 40
percent from the floor.
Unable to feel comfortable

with their own offense, the
Cards have hampered them
selves with bad judgment and
mechanical errors
"We just haven t been able to
generate a flow.' Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso said "A
flow' means that each time
downcourt. you're running of
fenses and getting good shots.
We've had poor shot selection
and an inordinate amount of
turnovers."
Dißiaso said that the Cards
did begin to display signs of
competence toward the end of
the Marquette contest, particu
larly when they closed the War
riors' lead to 44-38 with 9:58 re
maining
it was the first time we were
naturally flowing with the
game," Dißiaso related. "We
played consistent defense the
whole time, and we managed to
bit a string there where we hit
some good shots."
Dißiaso stated that a part of
Stanford's difficulty stems from
overeagerness. The sixth-vear
coach said that when a team hits
a cold spell and fails to score on
four or five consecutive

possessions, a player often de
rides to take matters into his
own hands by unleashing an ill
advised shot or hurling a dan
gerous pass "You mean well,
but you actually don't ac
complish much.'' Dißiaso said.
One plaver who accomplished
a great deal was Orlando Ward.
The 6-foot-8 forward played per
haps his finest collegiate game
against Marquette, collecting 14
points and 13 rebounds while
limiting Warrior All-America
candidate Oliver Lee to three
rebounds and five points on two
for-10 field-goal shooting.
if Orlando gives a consistent
effort, he's capable of 14-15
points and nine. 10 or 11 re
bounds a game." Dißiaso com
mented
The Cards will attempt to
right themselves with games
tomorrow against UC-Davis and
Saturday against UC-Irvine.
Both affairs will begin at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Davis, which owns an im
pressive 5-1 record, will proba
bly challenge the Cards with a
man-to-man defense. Dißiaso

said
Irvine, meanwhile, doesn't
think too much about defense,
preferring to concentrate on its
offense. The 1-1 Anteaters aver
aged 110 points a game while
beating Virginia Military In
stitute 125-96 and losing to Ne
vada-Las Vegas 124-95
DiBiaso said that this week's
practices may cause him to al
ter his starting lineup, though

Ward, forward Brian Welch (14
points, six-for-10 shooting
against Marquette) and guard
Doug Marty (the only starter
shooting higher than 40 percent)
remain good bets to start.
It Dißiaso makes any
changes at all. they will likely
be either Roger Lemons for
Terry Smith at guard or Dave
Nussbaum for John Revelli at
center.

The Cards will attempt to
right themselves with games
tomorrow against UC-Davis and
Saturday against UC-Irvine.
Both affairs will begin at 7:30
p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
Davis, which owns an im
pressive 5-1 record, will proba

man-to-man defense. Dißiaso

said
Irvine, meanwhile, doesn't
think too much about defense,
preferring to concentrate on its
offense. The 1-1 Anteaters aver
aged 110 points a game while
beating Virginia Military In
stitute 125-96 and losing to Ne
vada-Las Vegas 124-95
DiBiaso said that this week's
practices may cause him to al
ter his starting lineup, though

Ward, forward Brian Welch (14
points, six-for-10 shooting
against Marquette) and guard
Doug Marty (the only starter
shooting higher than 40 percent)
remain good bets to start.
It Dißiaso makes any
changes at all. they will likely
be either Roger Lemons for

While describing a recent San
Francisco 49ers' loss to the De
troit Lions, KSFO radio an
nouncer Lon Simmons poked fun
at the 49ers' offensive inep
titude. which was marked by in
terceptions. fumbles and penal
ties. "Now the 49ers are in trou
ble." Simmons remarked after
San Francisco gained
possession of the football.
"They have the ball ."
Simmons could well have
been describing the early-sea
son efforts of Stanford's men's
basketball team While playing
encouragingly well on defense,
the Cardinals have had difficul
ty executing their offense, as
their pair of losses in the
Midwest — 73-51 to Wyoming
and H9-58 to Marquette —
showed.
Stanford has amassed of
fensive statistics that more
befit a high school team than a
major college one In their first
three games, the Cards have
failed to score more than HO
points and shoot above 40
percent from the floor.
Unable to feel comfortable

with their own offense, the
Cards have hampered them
selves with bad judgment and
mechanical errors
"We just haven t been able to
generate a flow.' Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso said "A
flow' means that each time
downcourt. you're running of
fenses and getting good shots.
We've had poor shot selection
and an inordinate amount of
turnovers."
Dißiaso said that the Cards
did begin to display signs of
competence toward the end of
the Marquette contest, particu
larly when they closed the War
riors' lead to 44-38 with 9:58 re
maining
it was the first time we were
naturally flowing with the
game," Dißiaso related. "We
played consistent defense the
whole time, and we managed to
bit a string there where we hit
some good shots."
Dißiaso stated that a part of
Stanford's difficulty stems from
overeagerness. The sixth-vear
coach said that when a team hits
a cold spell and fails to score on
four or five consecutive

possessions, a player often de
rides to take matters into his
own hands by unleashing an ill
advised shot or hurling a dan
gerous pass "You mean well,
but you actually don't ac
complish much.'' Dißiaso said.
One plaver who accomplished
a great deal was Orlando Ward.
The 6-foot-8 forward played per
haps his finest collegiate game
against Marquette, collecting 14
points and 13 rebounds while
limiting Warrior All-America
candidate Oliver Lee to three
rebounds and five points on two
for-10 field-goal shooting.
if Orlando gives a consistent
effort, he's capable of 14-15
points and nine. 10 or 11 re
bounds a game." Dißiaso com
mented
