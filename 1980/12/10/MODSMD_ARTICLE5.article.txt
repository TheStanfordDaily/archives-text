# P.A. council against spraying
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Palo Alto Mayor Alan Henderson
says he has never received more calls
in a week's time about a single issue
than he did last week.
And more than a hundred people
turned out in the city council cham
bers Monday night to listen to coun
cil members debate the proposed
spraying of an insecticide over most of
Santa Clara county to eradicate prob
lems caused by the Mediterranean
fruit fly. About 30 local citizens spoke
I 'fore the council, all of them oppos
ing the spraying.
When some three hours of dis
cussion about the issue were through,
the council voted unanimously to go on
record as opposing the planned
chemical spraying of malathion. and
to use city resources to encourage any
viable alternatives to the insecticide
to get rid of the fly.
The same night, the citv council in
Mountain View passed a similar
measure by a 6-1 vote.
At this point, it is unclear who
among local, state and federal of
ficials will have final jurisdiction over
the spraying decision, although Moun
tain View Mayor Matthew Allen told

the Daily yesterday that because of
vigorous public reaction against the
malathion plan and the city councils'
statements, he would "seriously
doubt" that any attempts by the feder
al government to impose it could be
successful
The infestation of the fly. which na
tional and state agriculture officials
say seriously threatens the entire
state s $12 billion-a-year agriculture
industry, has spread from an initial
small area discovered last June in the
southern part of the county to an area
estimated at some 133 square miles,
ranging from San Jose up to Palo Alto.
The fly can ruin fruits and some
vegetables. Many homeowners in the
area have their own gardens and fruit
trees, and the county is fairly near the
highly agricultural San Joaquin val
ley. California Dept. of Agriculture
officials, in announcing the spraying
plan one week ago. said that if the fly
is not controlled in some manner, they
"may have no choice" but to quaran
tine the whole state.
However, the spraying plan, which
would be implemented in late Decem
ber and would consist of six aerial
sprayings several days apart, has
drawn practically nothing but harsh
criticism from residents and health
officials alike.
Some charge that the spraying is un
healthy and that malathion ma\ cause
cancer and other diseases, a risk
which could become particularly
great if a low-flying plane accidental
ly released greatcr-than-planned
amounts of the insecticide.
Aerial spraying to control the flies
could have disastrous effects on Stan
ford research and cause "an
ecological catastrophe," a University
biologist said yesterday.
Richard Holm said in a letter to
county Supervisor Ron Diridon that
the spraying would jeopardize re
search
"Those of us familiar with the dis
mal track record of insect extermina
tion attempts know that it is unlikely
to do any good, but must necessarily
entail many serious and possible ir
reversible side effects," he wrote.
Holms claimed that aerial spraying
of the broad-spectrum insecticide
could wipe out insect colonies being
studied bv Stanford biologists, both in
the university's biological preserve
and inside laboratories.
Malathion is a general insecticide.

which means that the sprayings would
kill a number of beneficial insects, in
cluding bees Health officials say that
all beekeepers would be given ade
quate notice to store hives in safe
places during the sprayings.
At the same time, others charge
that the spraying would simply be in
effective. however great the threat
the "Medflies" pose They say at this
time of the year, most of the Medflies
are in a larval or pupal stage, inside
fruits or under the ground where they
will not be reached by the spray.
And still others charge that recent
cold temperatures will cause the flies
to die naturally, citing a study which
contends that most eggs, pupae and
larvae of the fly will die — even in the
ground — at temperatures below 40
degrees lasting for a few hours, condi
tions which have been met by recent
chilly days in the area.
A number of environmental groups,
including the local chapter of the
Sierra Club and the Peninsula Con
servation Center are conducting a
vigorous program not only to oppose
the spraying but to propose alter
natives to malathion. They are propo
sing that all fruit in the infestation
area be picked soon, and that a one
time willingness of citizens of the
county to remove all their fruit crop
will be the most effective and
biologically safe means to deal with
the insect.
In other business, the council
elected Betsy Bechtel, an aide to
County Supervisor Geraldine Stein
berg. to fill a vacancy created bv the
resignation of Byron Sher. who was
elected to the state assembly in No
vember. Bechtel was chosen on the
fifth ballot.
Councilmembers also elected Ellen
Fletcher vice mayor of Palo Alto, a
position which Sher had held.
Before debating the malathion is
sue. the council passed 6-3 an or
dinance which will require landlords
to offer year-Vong \eases to tenants in
the area.
The ordinance, designed to promote
tenant security, may actually prove a
bother to some Stanford students, who
could have to sublet an off-campus
house if they choose to leave school
during the year
