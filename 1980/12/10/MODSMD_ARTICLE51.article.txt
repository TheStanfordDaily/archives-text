# Sailors clean up on way to success

### Terry Vance 
The next time you are in
Maples Pavilion watching a
basketball game, take a mo
ment to think about the sailing
team
The sailing team 0
Sure. Most people don't know
it. but the members of the Stan
ford sailing team clean the gym
after every home basketball
game. !\'ice. huh?
Well, winter is not a very
pleasant time for the sailing
team In addition to the cleaning
work, they must also drive to
Redwood Shores four times a
week for sailing practice.
The reward for all the hard la
bor comes in the fall and spring
when the team lets the sailing
world know about the increasing
strength of Stanford's program.
At the end of this fall's cam
paign. the team was ranked 13th
nationally and new head coach
.Joe I'etrucci believes that Stan
ford should crack the top 10 not
long after the season opens on
February 8 It is with this goal in
mind that he has had the team
practicing more during the off
season then it has in the past.
The work at Maples is net
part of the conditioning pro
gram Sailing teams need mon

ey because their sport requires
a lot of traveling, more than a
club sports budget allows.
In addition to the money re
ceived for cleaning Maples, the
sailing team is also supported
by donors who have given cash,
used boats, and Qven a van.
The gifts are tax-deductible,
but even without the boost from
the Internal Revenue Service, it
is likely that most of the team-'s
supporters are more than satis
fied with the return on their in
vestment
Stanford has placed well
wherever it has appeared in its
extensive travels Last year in
Annapolis, the Cards surprised
many of their competitors by
finishing ninth in the Trux-Um
stead Regatta, an event regu
larly attended bv the nation's
top 20 teams. This fall. Stanford
just missed qualifying a sloop
(three-man boat) for the na
tional championship.
Sailing is unlike most col
legiate sports in that there are
national championships held
twice a year The single handed
(1-mant championship was de
termined concurrently this fall
with the sloop championship.
Late in the spring, boats will
compete for the women's cham
pionship. the men's dinghies
i two-man» and the team cham
pionship.
The dinghy competition is
considered the most prestigious
of all the events, and Stanford
has strong crews in that catego
ry
Team captain Paul Yost and
Lisa Haywood comprise the No.
1 boat, with Bill Buckingham
and Karen Plunkett in the No. 2
boat The composition of the two

boats makes one wonder why
there is a separate women's
championship. Carolyn Brown
and Betty Kdmonds compete
successfully for Stanford as a
men's' team, and Brown is one
ot the best sailors of either sex
in Northern California.
The skills sailing requires do
not depend on any specific phys
ical attribute Yost claims that
good sailors need three things
"a good feel for boats, water
and wind."
Natural ability appears to be
able to triumph over a relative
lack of experience. Yost points
to his predecessor as captain
who came out of Stanford's rec
reational sailing program to dis
place a team member who had
twice been to the national cham

pionships
This year's Stanford team ob
viously believes that more than
natural ability is required, how
ever Last year, the team helped
pick new coach Petrucci He
was All-America at Tufts last
year and one of the members of
the national champion dinghy
team. Yost and others on the
Stanford team had sailed
against him in competition and
had been impressed bv his tech
nical skills. Luckily, the Athlet
ic Department was impressed
by his organizational and
teaching abilities and hired him
as Director of Sailing.
Yost believes Petrucci's
tutoring is already paying off.
"We're ahead of where we were
in mid-season last vear," he

claimed, leading one to believe
that more surprises are in store
for teams at the big Eastern re
gattas
Stanford will also get a
chance to sail closer to home
this year, since the spring
championships will be held in
Northern California.
A strong Stanford showing
might prompt other coaches to
ask about the Cards' winter
training program. They will un
derstand the part about the
work on the water, but what
about that work in the gvm 9
"Something to do with basket
ball I '' one will say. Unless a full
explanation is offered. Eastern
sailing teams might have some
very odd practice sessions next
winter.

Natural ability appears to be
able to triumph over a relative
lack of experience. Yost points
to his predecessor as captain
who came out of Stanford's rec
reational sailing program to dis
place a team member who had
twice been to the national cham

pionships
This year's Stanford team ob
viously believes that more than
natural ability is required, how
ever Last year, the team helped
pick new coach Petrucci He
was All-America at Tufts last
year and one of the members of
the national champion dinghy
team. Yost and others on the
Stanford team had sailed
against him in competition and
had been impressed bv his tech
nical skills. Luckily, the Athlet
ic Department was impressed
by his organizational and
teaching abilities and hired him
as Director of Sailing.
Yost believes Petrucci's
tutoring is already paying off.
"We're ahead of where we were
in mid-season last vear," he

claimed, leading one to believe
that more surprises are in store
for teams at the big Eastern re
gattas
Stanford will also get a
chance to sail closer to home
this year, since the spring
championships will be held in
Northern California.
A strong Stanford showing
might prompt other coaches to
ask about the Cards' winter
training program. They will un
derstand the part about the
work on the water, but what
about that work in the gvm 9
"Something to do with basket
ball I '' one will say. Unless a full
explanation is offered. Eastern
sailing teams might have some
very odd practice sessions next
winter.

Sure. Most people don't know
it. but the members of the Stan
ford sailing team clean the gym
after every home basketball
game. !\'ice. huh?
Well, winter is not a very
pleasant time for the sailing
team In addition to the cleaning
work, they must also drive to
Redwood Shores four times a
week for sailing practice.
The reward for all the hard la
bor comes in the fall and spring
when the team lets the sailing
world know about the increasing
strength of Stanford's program.
At the end of this fall's cam
paign. the team was ranked 13th
nationally and new head coach
.Joe I'etrucci believes that Stan
ford should crack the top 10 not
long after the season opens on
February 8 It is with this goal in
mind that he has had the team
practicing more during the off
season then it has in the past.
The work at Maples is net
part of the conditioning pro
gram Sailing teams need mon

ey because their sport requires
a lot of traveling, more than a
club sports budget allows.
In addition to the money re
ceived for cleaning Maples, the
sailing team is also supported
by donors who have given cash,
used boats, and Qven a van.
The gifts are tax-deductible,
but even without the boost from
the Internal Revenue Service, it
is likely that most of the team-'s
supporters are more than satis
fied with the return on their in
vestment
Stanford has placed well
wherever it has appeared in its
extensive travels Last year in
Annapolis, the Cards surprised
many of their competitors by
finishing ninth in the Trux-Um
stead Regatta, an event regu
larly attended bv the nation's
top 20 teams. This fall. Stanford
just missed qualifying a sloop
(three-man boat) for the na
tional championship.
Sailing is unlike most col
legiate sports in that there are
national championships held
twice a year The single handed
(1-mant championship was de
termined concurrently this fall
with the sloop championship.
Late in the spring, boats will
compete for the women's cham
pionship. the men's dinghies
i two-man» and the team cham
pionship.
The dinghy competition is
considered the most prestigious
of all the events, and Stanford
has strong crews in that catego
ry
Team captain Paul Yost and
Lisa Haywood comprise the No.
1 boat, with Bill Buckingham
and Karen Plunkett in the No. 2
boat The composition of the two

boats makes one wonder why
there is a separate women's
championship. Carolyn Brown
and Betty Kdmonds compete
successfully for Stanford as a
men's' team, and Brown is one
ot the best sailors of either sex
in Northern California.
The skills sailing requires do
not depend on any specific phys
ical attribute Yost claims that
good sailors need three things
"a good feel for boats, water
and wind."
