## 1980: Have-nots prevail 
### 
Business as usual in college football this sea
son? Not on your life
For the first time in centuries. Alabama.
USC. Texas and Ohio State were not the center
of all autumnal attention In their place, un
defeated Georgia is now the country's top
team, and Florida State (a winless joke not too
many years ago) has become so good so quick
ly that its No 2 ranking may actually be a
slight Even Baylor has designs on the
mythical national championship

Corn mentary

What the hell happened to college football
this fall 0 Many things. The NCAA's "anti
stockpiling"' scholarship limitations — a
school may have only 95 players on the freebie
list — finally did take effect, enforcing parity
in ihe sport The game itself changed — with
the forward pass mercifully ousting those tired
three-vards-a-crack rushing attacks.
Finally, as always, the preseason prognos
ticators were all mixed up They paid attention
to the wrong teams. Stanford. Houston. Arkan
sas and Texas were all highly-touted medi
ocrities. The teams that couldn't buy media at
tention in September — Georgia. Florida
State. Baylor. UCLA, even Notre Dame —
proved to be the ones worth watching in No
vember. All. except UCLA, will be in action on
New Year's Day
Before taking a look at this year's big Bowl
matchups, it's time to hand out presents to
those who made this season a special one. The
awards:
BEST OFFENSIVE PLAYER: Herschel
Walker. (leornia. Walker's 1616 yards as a
freshman running back may be but a presage
of things to come. Without Walker. Georgia is
nothing special — with him. they should win
the national championship. Enough said.
BEST QUARTERBACK: John Elway,
Stanford. Regional bias? So be it. Elway is the
best in the nation now. and he still has two
years to go. Who else could throw 27 touchdown
passes against a schedule that included USC.
UCLA. Washington and Oklahoma?
BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYER: TIE -
Hutfh (ireen, Pittsburgh and Ronnie Lott,
USC. Green is the quickest, strongest and
most terrifying lineman in the country. Lott is
his equivalent in the secondary. Despite the ob
vious reluctance of opponents to throw any
where near him, Lott still led the nation in in
terceptions with eight.
BEST COACH: Bobby Howden, Florida
State. The Seminoles ambushed Nebraska and
Pittsburgh back-to-back in October, and have
won 38 of their last 44 under Bowden. A coach
can't do much more, except win a major bowl
game. New Year's night, Bowden should de

liver that as well
WORST COACH h'.arh■ Urine. Ohio State.
Last voar. Bruce was daring and aggressive;
this season he's Woody Haves C.ive credit
where it's due though Bruce is the only coach
in America who's found a way to contain Buck
eve quarterback Art Schlichter
BUST GAME YOU NEVER SAW: Notre
Dame 2ft. Michigan 27. While ABC-TV was
sticking the Ohio State-Minnesota snoozer to
most of the nation Sept 20. wise fans
" watched" this one on radio And what a game
they saw! Harry Oliver's 51-yard field goal at
the gun decided it
What to look forward to on New Year's Dav?
SUGAR BOWL (ABC-TV. 11 am. PST):
GEORGIA 17. NOTRE DAME 13 If Georgia
gives the ball to Herschel Walker enough they
will certainly score some points. Anemic
Notre Dame is another story Irish freshman
quarterback Blair Kiel still hasn't thrown a
touchdown pass, and ND's run-oriented of
fense just won't cut it against the aggressive
Bulldogs.
Georgia quarterback Buck Belue has done
the job all season, and he has plenty of targets.
Dan Devine's swan song may be one he'll
choose to forget.
COTTON BOWL (CBS-TV. 11:30 a.m..
PST): ALABAMA t4. BAYLOR 11. Alabama's
offense never got going this season, but the
Tide defense is sterling. Bear — uh. Hay lor
Bear — quarterback Jay Jeffries may weil be
swarmed under all afternoon — especially if
star rusher Walter Abercrombie is held down.
Alabama freshman signal-caller Walter
Lewis is a terrific runner If he shows any pass
ing touch. Baylor can forget it.
ROSE BOWL (NBC-TV. 1:45 p.m., PST):
MICHIGAN 21. WASHINGTON 17 It's about
time for the midwestern half to win in
Pasadena. Besides. Washington is so dull it
might as well be in the Big 10 Both teams are
big and strong, but Michigan's running backs
(led by Butch Woolfolk) are noticeably better.
No longer are the Wolverines passing
patsies, either. Michigan quarterback John
Wangler throws well and the Big 10 champs
play rugged defense against any type of attack.
ORANGE BOWL (NBC-TV. 5 p.m., PST):
FLORIDA STATE 23. OKLAHOMA 14. Pay
back time for last year's Sooner romp. The
Seminoles are versatile and deep on both sides
of the line, and they may punish the erratic
Sooners. Oklahoma has a slick runner in
Buster Rhymes, but it's going to need some
sharp passing from J.C. Watts (an unusual oc
curence) to prevail.
With Rick Stockstill throwing the ball and
workhorse Sam Piatt rushing it.the Seminoles
will get their points. Danny Capece, the fine
FSU placekicker. may be the difference.
