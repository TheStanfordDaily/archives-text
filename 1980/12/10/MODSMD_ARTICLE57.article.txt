Step into Charles Bardelli's restaurant
and you will feel that time has unwound a
half century, placing you in an older San
Francisco The establishment began
business in 1918. when it was known as
"Charles' Fashion Restaurant." And
back then, just as today, the concierges
at the grand hotels of downtown San
Francisco would often direct hungry
guests to this fine dining room
One splendid and comfortable, long,
high-ceilinged hall, with closely placed
white clothed tables, constitutes the en
tire dining area Chandeliers diffuse a
gentle yellow light over the diners.
How can 1 tell you: Bardelli's is not for
the tender whispers and flickering eye
lids of a tenuous first date. The patrons
are old familiar fellows who come with
good friends and recognize others — by
whose tables they aren't reluctant to
pause for salutations and a cheerful ex
change
Greeting us with grace and warmth,
the maitred' seated my date and I quick
ly The atmosphere around us was vigor
ous and uninhibiting. Waiters and
busboys bustled at their chores, while
diners conversed in full voices and
gestured widely.
Bardelli's attracts a largeearlv dinner

crowd These guests are interested in the
theater shows which begin at 8 p.m.. and
they can select "Pre-Theater Special
Petit Dinners" from the menu The
waiter makes sure that the meal pro
ceeds quickly so that show overtures and
opening curtains are not missed.
My evening's schedule permitted a lit
tle more freedom with time, but I did in
tend to rendezvous with a certain red
clad band for a parade that drizzly Fri
day night Service was prompt.
Soon our meal started with salads
placed before us. The fine ingredients,
three tender pink strips of smoked
salmon, were set upon a thick bed of ro
maine lettuce, with slices of beets and
tomatoes decorating the edges. Mean
while. a small antipasto featuring a pate
of liver had temporarily replaced our
centerpiece on the table.
Tortellini alia Napoletana followed
the salad This delicious pasta is stuffed
with ground chicken and veal. It can be
served in a cream sauce (alia Crema).
but is zestier when covered by the
aromatic tomato sauce.
Our wine was just settling into our
senses as the main course arrived It is
the entrees that make the Bardelli's din
ner. I am told that a Half Moon Bay diver
delivers fresh mollusks for the Abalone
Meuniere. Soaked in a rich lemon butter
sauce, the abalone released a powerful
savor across the palate. Abalone. which
dies with its muscle tensed, is trickv to

keep from being tough In creating
Abalone Meuniere. the chef dipped the
well-pounded shellfish in a light egg bat
ter and fried it quickly The preparation
of the tender abalone was perfect.
A veal cutlet was breaded topped with
melted Parmesan cheese and covered
with spicy tomato sauce in the usual
manner of preparing Veal Parmigiana
The dish was somehow unusually en
joyable. however The juicy meat aimost
severed under a fork Hut the Swiss
chard and rice served with the entrees
were no more than average
Ah dessert Fresh strawberries were
laced with brandy and Madeira before
being piled over a scoop of vanilla ice
cream for Strawberries Bardelli. After
polishing off that dish eagerly, we were
on our way. two blocks to Union Square
for the Incomparables.
Bardelli's serves a lunch which is very
popular with local merchants. The noon
meal is sometimes taken there bv Otto
Dressier, an old gent who created, in
1925. the beautiful stained glass
"peacock window'' which marks the
elaborate entry.
Dinner for two. with wine and the tip.
should run about $50. Dinner service is
until 10 p.m., and there is a $5 per person
minimum charge. Two meals are served
weekdays; just dinner is available on
Saturday. Reservations are required.
