The Florentine
1 IS Castro St.
Mountain View
961-6543
A four course dinner for around $7° If you've
thought this was a deal offered only by your
friendly University food service, take a drive to
Mountain View and visit the Florentine
You could easily miss the unassuming building
The interior is as unpretentious as the exterior
The small establishment is two rooms with red
checkered tablecloths, brick and paneling. Italian
prints and travel posters
A huge copper espresso machine and a large
aquarium help divide the rooms, while candles
and carnations on every table add a nice homey
touch The kitchen is in partial view in one wall
It looks like a friendly neighborhood restaurant
of the Italian district of some large city. And the
food lives up to that impression, it's authentic,
hearty, large-portioned and good
Vittorio Mungigueria, a native-born Italian,
manages the Florentine. He learned to cook in Ita
ly and uses the same un-Americanized recipes
here in California
We began our meal with a shared order of fried
ealamari (squid) at $4.75: Squid is much more
popular in Italy than it is in the U.S but the Flor
entine's version is likely to win converts It is
lightly battered, sweet, slightly chewy without
being rubbery, and tender enough to cut with a
fork. Red cocktail sauce and tarter sauce, both
homemade, accompanied this dish.
Appetizers ranged from an Italian Salami plate
($3.75) to Fettuccine Alfredo ($4.75). Soup and
salad are also available a la carte
From a menu offering about two dozen pasta
entrees (all a la carte). and as many dinners (in
cluding soup or salad, vegetable, pasta and cof
fee). we chose linguine with red clam sauce
($5 50) and Mike's veal scallopini ($7.75).
The linguine was an enormous portion of
noodles in a mildly spicy sauce. In addition to
plenty of clams, many of which had fallen to the
bottom, two fresh-steamed clams in shells
adorned the top of the dish
The noodles were cooked slightly past al driitr
but were still good and certainlv not mushv The

portion size made a doggie hag mandatory
The veal was served in a slightly more manage
able but still large portion The unusual sauce,
composed of sherry, fresh mushrooms and lemon,
was piquant and delicious It was an excellent
complement to the gently sauteed veal
The Florentine does not use those chopped and
formed excuses for veal patties in any of its dish
es
The fresh sauteed carrots and zucchini, as well
as pasta, that accompanied the veal were also
good
Other offerings ranged from spaghetti ($3 95)
to a Steak Florentine dinner «$8 501 Seven styles
of veal are offered ' $7.25 to $7.75 i as well as seven
seafood dinners ($6 95 to $8 25), including
calamari or trout saute
The Florentine offers several vegetarian
choices, including Fettuccini A 1 Pesto is 4 50i and
two eggplant dinners ($6.75). /g

And tor those who can save or make room for
dessert, the Florentine features cannoli. spumoni
ire cream, and Uncle Otto's cheesecake (SI to
$1.50). as well as European coffees
