The Customs House

According to the.s'nn Francis
[.(n Chronicle, the Customs
/House is the San Francisco
49ers favorite restaurant in the
','Bav Area Regardless of what
vvou think of the 49ers (or of the
♦Chronicle), the Customs House
lis an amazing restaurant
It is situated in the corner of a
small shopping center, right on
the water. Three sides have win
dows with a view of the Bay The
inside, however, is
•<also worthy of attention
Crates, bamboo, wood and
'drums are scattered every
where Some are even roped to
• the ceiling Waiters and
'.waitresses are dressed in island
'gear It looks something like a
'.colonial outpost.
■ Colonial outposts.though, nev
'er had booths with dimmer
; switches. The Customs House is
•almost too much, but it works.
The placement of the crates
I also gives the illusion of many
Ismail restaurants. Though the
• restaurant is large, from wher
'••ever you sit it is impossible to
..see more than a few other
• An eight page menu on a clip
aboard is your first indication
'that the whimsy extends to the
'•food and drinks as well. If your
waitress appears immediately
to take your drink order, stail
"her until you've read the menu
'first. Gin and tonics and

martinis do tend to pale before
the prospects of Havana
Bananas. Warf Wrats and
Margaritas with an extra shot of
tequila on the side ($2 50 to
$2.95)
And Kd's Flat on Your Back
Special ($5 95) is the ultimate
drink It contains full measures
of vodka, tequila, rum. brandy
and blue caracao. with fruit
juices. (Only one per guest.)
The menu itself features both
light meals and full dinners.
Fanciful salads, sandwiches,
egg dishes and burgers provide
good choices for brunch, lunch
or a light supper Most of these
offerings are under $5
None of the dinners exceed
$10 95. and they include soup or
salad, baked potato or corn on
the cob and two kinds of bread —
a slightly sweet Hawaiian style
and a "Native Brown - ' version
Both breads are quite good and
pleasant changes from the ever
present sourdough
A dozen different beers are
offered to complement your
meal, but the wine list is limited
to six varietals from Taylor Cal
ifornia Cellars by the glass or
carafe. These wines are a step
above most jug wines: the
Chardonnav in particular has
been noted in several wine col
umns Still, we would have liked
a slightly larger selection.
Appetizers are extra but
worth trying, especially the
pago pago potato skins ($2.75).
These delicious, scooped-out.
crispy skins were served with a

tangv sour cream and chive dip
More traditional openers in
clude fried zucchini and hot or
cold artichokes (both $2.95)
We also sampled the cheesy
onion soup i $2.251. The baked-on
cheese and well-flavored stock
made this dish well worth its
charge
The house salads, though,
were the only real disappoint
ment of the evening They were
small and unexciting Perhaps
we should have tried the soup of
the day.
Fntrees arrived very quickly
We ordered the Mediterranean
seafood feast ($8 95) and the
Sicilian scampi and steak
• $10 951. Two skewers carry
ing salmon, scallops, shrimp
and mahi-mahi arrived as our
feast. The broiled seafood was
well-cooked and not heavily sea
soned. allowing the natural
flavors to come through nicely
Similarly the scampi, while a
bit charred in parts, were also
subtly seasoned. The steak, a
better-than-average piece of
meat, was cooked exactly to or
der Not a fancy gourmet dish,
but a very good one
The remainder of the dinner
menu defies ethnic description,
with everything from
Educardo's enchilada grandeor
Island Mahi Mahi (both $6.95) to
Ribs Rangsapour or Somali
Swordfish (both $8.95).
Fortunately, portion sizes are
moderate, because you will
almost certainly want to try one
of the desserts or ice cream

drinks
The black forest forgery
is 2 951 is a sweet-lover's dream
;ind a calorie counter's night
mare Chocolate cake soaked in
Amaretto is combined with
cherries, chocolate, ice cream
and whipped cream It's dec
adent but delicious
For grown-up sweet tooths,
knight kaps. French licks, and
dreamsickles ($2 75). provide
ice cream with a kick of any
thing from Galliano to Coin
treau
Our selection, the Menage a
Trois ($3 95 including a truly
••titillating" glass to keep),
combined strawberry, choco
late and coconut with vodka and
rum You might try the drink
and use the glass as a Christmas
present
Simpler — though still
whimsical — coffee drinks are
also available for around $2.25
Indeed there is a touch of
whimsy in everything the Cus
toms House does. Owner Ed
Fngoron has created a good
times restaurant
Foster City is a 20-minute
drive from campus, but the next
time you're looking for some
thing different, you might want
to join the crowds at the Cus
toms House.
Or if you're heading out to the
airport for a Christmas flight,
take the Hillsdale exit and try
the Customs House for a drink
