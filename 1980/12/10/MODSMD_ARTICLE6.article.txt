### J. Raymond Mills 
The National Direct Student Loan Program, a major
source of financial aid for Stanford students who meet cer
tain demonstrated need criteria, has been significantly al
tered under a bill signed into law by President Jimmy
Carter on October 3.
The Education Amendments Act of 1980 extends the
NDSL program through 1985. but the following regulation
amendments are effective as of October 1
— The interest rate is increased from 3 percent to 4
percent per annum.
— The grace period before repayment must begin is de
creased from 9 months to 6 months.
— A new 6-month grace period is provided after statu
tory deferment periods.
— Deferments can now be granted, not to exceed three
years, for:
a. Volunteer service in a private, non-profit VISTA or
Peace Corps type organization.
b. Service as an officer in the U.S. Public Health Ser
vice.
c. Temporary total disability.
d. Service, not to exceed two years, in an internship pre
ceedinga professional practice.
— The repayment period may be extended bv the lend
ing institution for an additional 10 years for low-income in
dividuals. (The term 'low income' will be defined in later
regulations.)
— The definition of handicapped children for the
purposes of teaching cancellation has been amended to in
clude orthopedicallv impaired or children with specific
learning disabilities
In addition, the following provisions will apply only to
loans made on or after October 1.
— The aggregate loan limits are increased from $2500 to
$3000 for a student who has not completed two academic
years of study towards a bachelor's degree , from $5000 to

$6000 for a student who has completed two academic years
of study towards a bachelor's degree: from $10,000 to
$12,000 for a graduate student.
— The special independent student status for veterans
has been deleted: therefore, veterans must comply with
the same requirements that other students must meet to
be considered independent.
A problem arises from this legislation since many in
stitutions. including Stanford, were in various stages of
processing loans under the previous NDSL terms and con
ditions when they received a copy of the new federal
guidelines on November 11
University Bursar Joseph Jedd said that as soon as
notification was received, all loans not vet signed for were
corrected to include the new regulations. Financial aid of
ficials here, however, are as yet undecided on how to im
plement the changes for students who signed promissary
notes for loans between the October 1 effective date and
the November 11 date that official notification of the
changes were received.
An information letter being sent to all NDSL recipients
from the Stanford Bursar's office indicates that all stu
dents who signed loans from October 1 to November 11 will
be required to re-sign for their Autumn Quarter loans on
corrected notes as well as for their Winter Quarter loans,
but a meeting of the California Association of Financial
Aids Administrators which concluded yesterday may alter
that plan
Representatives from the U.S. Department of Educa
tion. major lending institutions, and university financial
aids administrations met to review possible alternatives
to the proposed implementation plans.
University Financial Aids Director Robert Huff, a past
president of the National Association of Student Financial
Aid Administrators, and Assistant Director of Loans Ro
berta .Johnson were attending the meeting in San Diego
and were unavailable for comment.
