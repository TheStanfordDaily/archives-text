Almost every printed refer
ence to "Daure's" Carnelian
Room (named for the color of
the building's granite exterior)
dwells obsessively on the won
derful panoramic view On the
clear, cool evening of my visit,
the peninsula displayed its true
self, from the white pin-dots of
light twinkling in the Presidio,

tenderloin district To the east.
Oakland was perceptible, and
the San Leandro Hills shown
beyond. Coit Tower, the two
bridges, and the wharf were
also visible.
P'verv working day this plush
restaurant serves as a

clubhouse for San Francisco's
richest and most powerful ex

select Banker's Club Here the
pin-striped bosses can read
their New York papers or relax
at the green felt domino tables,
as well as arrange business

tings are changed, candles are
lighted and the dining room is
primped for dinner guests.
French antiques from the
eras of Louis XV and Louis XVI
have been lavished upon every
hallway, room and lounge in the
Carnelian Room. Many of these
were brought from Europe by
club members who were given
blank checks to shop with on

their travels.
