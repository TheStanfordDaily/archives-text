# Admire beautiful Foothills Park — through the fence

Fast ears and trucks shoot up theon
ramp of Interstate 280 in Palo Alto,
and with them go the bustle and noise
of 50 mph Page Mill Road. Only a few
drivers continue farther down Page
Mill, venturing west into the foothills
of the Santa Cruz Mountains
The route leads to beautiful Foot
hills Park, a popular city park hidden
among the green hills of the Penin
sula Still relatively wild, the 1400-
acre site serves as a wildlife refuge
and plant preserve in an area increas
ingly threatened by development
Palo Alto residents are proud of the
highly praised park, the result of a
once-controversial investment in
long-range planning and land preser
vation Hut they defend their ex
clusive right to enjov the park's trails,
picnic areas, views and forests in the
face of persistent efforts to open the
park \s gates For now. other Bay Area
residents stripped at the park entrance
will have to settle for a peek at the
land beyond
On its way to Foothills Park. Page
Mill Road narrows to two lanes enter
ing Los Altos Mills. Horse riders and
joggers travel along the shoulder in
rain or sun. and the fresh country air
and scenery attract bicycle riders and
motorcyclists as well
New housing developments can be
seen from Page Mill: elegant homes
on large lots, most priced at nearly $1
million Strict zoning laws in the foot
hills have helped to preserve much of
the land, but a shortage of housing on
the Peninsula is increasing pressure
on local governments to allow more
construction.
The road begins to rise, twisting and
turning to new heights above the green
valley, while cars strain in second
gear and bicyclists begin to sweat. Af

ter a long winding climb Page Mill
Road makes a final turn before the
straight-of-wav leading to Foothills
Park
Now three miles from Interstate
280. the Foothills Park entrance sta

into sight on the right as Page Mill
Road veers left in its climb toward
Skyline Boulevard All park visitors
are required to stop at the small one
room checkpoint, manned during park
hours -Ja m to 5:30 p m in winter
Foothills Park is owned and main
tained bv the city of Palo Alto, which
enforces entrance requirements No
one is allowed to enter without a li
brary card, driver's license or utility
bill proving Palo Alto residency City
employees are exempt from this rule,
but Palo Alto property owners living
outside the city are not
Park rangers state that bicyclists
and joggers often slip past the gate
without identification, and visitors
who can't find a Palo Alto resident to
accompany them have climbed over
fences For many, resorting to stealth
is the only way to enter the park
Fences around Foothills Park —
chain-link along some sections of
Page Mill Road and split-rail
elsewhere — are reportedly meant to
keep out four-wheel drive vehicles and
motorcycles. Before their installa
tion. vandals tore down young trees,
regularly left piles of beer cans from
their parties and set fire to the en
trance station twice. Fences have
helped to cut vandalism, but they don't
keep out everyone. According to Foot

the park bad enough he can It would
be impossible to patrol our borders."
Those allowed in can drive on a
boulder-lined park road through

grasslands, to the viewpoint on Vista
Hill The sight from here is thrilling
Below stretches the Peninsula, from
the flat. muddy waters of San Francis
co Bay to the dirigible hangar at Mof

terstate 280 is small and remote, and
the tip of Hoover Tower peaks over a
hill
Wooden posts set about the area
hold eyepieces aimed at such sites as
Mt Diablo. Oakland and San Francis

From here, a 360-degree view of the
park can be seen Green, gently rolling
hills stretch down toward Palo Alto,
crisscrossed with fallen fences and
trees lining creeks in the valley folds
Three 'panorama'' trails wind
through the grass below and disappear
in a patch of forest.
To the right, a discreetly painted
water tank, one of two in the park that
supply water to Palo Alto, is partially
hidden in the hills behind a ring of
trees To the rear, green woods rise on
the Fast and West Ridges, broken here
and there by grassy knolls and sliced
along the rim by the Trapper's Trail

In the sky. seagulls or a rare golden
eagle may be spotted climbing and
soaring in a stiff breeze, and during
the summer months, buzzing planes
and paper kites fly over the giant park
The 1400 acres of park land were
sold to the city by Dr. Russel Lee. a
former professor at the Medical
School and official doctor for five
Stanford presidents Lee still owns 600
acres of neighboring land, and at 85-
vears-old says he is considering sell
ing half of it to the Midpeninsula Re
gional Open Space District and saving
the rest for his grandchildren.
Lee calls Foothills Park "the best
municipal park in the United States."

and savs that except for adding one
horse trail Palo Alto should quit
making more trails damming
streams and cutting down trees " Lee
admits his reason for selling the land
Wits money, but claims thecitv got
a good deal the land was recently
assessed at $26 million. 14 times its
selling price
Palo Mto purchased the park from
U'e in two sections The first purchase
ot 1200 acres for $13 million was au
thorized by the Palo Alto City Council
in I)ecember of 1958 and was approved
b\ a city-wide referendum in Mav of
1959 \n additional 200 acres were
bought in 1965 for $500,000
During the summer of 1964. 45 high
school and college students were hired
to help build trails and bridges and to
develop picnic sites, roads were con
structed and electricity and water
lines were installed During the park 's
tirst year in 1965. attendance was
light but it has steadily risen to
170.000 yearly visits and now is at the
point where cars are sometimes
turned away on spring weekends when
parking spaces fill
One of Foothills Park's major at
tractions is 12-acre Boronda Lake,
carved out of the flat central valley by
earth moving equipment. Winter
rains keep it brim-full, while in drier
months water is released from the
nearby water tank Looking into the
lake's sparkling waters, rippled by a
light breeze, it's hard to remember
that its depth throughout is only 4 feet
The cool waters are inviting when
temperatures rise into the 80s. Rules
forbid swimming or wading, since the
park has no lifeguard, but children
splash their feet and often go wading

the rules are not always enforced, but.

daredevil trying to walk across the
lake we have to stop him
People-powered boats may be used
for fishing The lake is stocked with
catfish, black bass, bluegill and sun
fish and fishermen can cast from a
pier

tangle of cattails and reeds lining the
shore
On the far side of Boronda Lake, a
bridge arches over a muddy moat to
Sunfish Island A trail winds along'the
island's shore, past benches, under
trees and bv stepping-stone boulders
that extend into the lake After early
spring, the island lies hidden behind a
screen of voung cattails and reeds,
and dragonflies dart among the
growth Children can scramble up the

wooded hill that rises in the center and
climb a tree that serves as a look-out
over the waters of the lake
Those who venture to the lake's
west end will find a curious two-foot
hole set in the water a few feet from
the earthen Boronda Lake Dam. Down
this concrete pipe winter overflow wa
ter plunges beneath the ground. The
pipe leads several hundred feet west
to a small canyon where heavy rains
form a seasonal creek
Nearby, natural springs below the
dam feed a thriving marsh. Earthen
dikes built by a summer youth crew
are now covered with watercress and
grasses. thriving cattails, willows and
rushes provide a home for diving
beetles, water striders and micro
scopic protozoans. Mosquito fish were
introduced to control mosquito larvae.
Attracted bv flying insects, a black
phoebe has made its home near the
marsh and Kingfishers and a great
blue heron have been frequent vis
itors. Two-legged tourists can hunt
tree frogs, western toads and Califor
nia newts here and chase garter
snakes
The muddy tracks of raccoons on
their nightly forays can be seen at the
water's edge. Coyotes and an occa
sional mountain lion also come down
from the hills to drink, and a bobcat
that frequents the marsh has recently
been hunting gophers on the park's
turf.
The creek flows past the marsh and
one of seven park picnic areas to the
Las Trampas Valley. This half-mile

long grassv field is popular with
Frisbee throwers and sunbathers on
hot summer days Teenagers and
large groups find room here for sports

The best views of natural vegetation
at Foothills Park are seen from its
nine excellent trails. Half of the 14-
mile system is included in giant Los

There are three distinct plant and
animal communities at the park, and
all three can be seen from the trails.
