Fast ears and trucks shoot up theon
ramp of Interstate 280 in Palo Alto,
and with them go the bustle and noise
of 50 mph Page Mill Road. Only a few
drivers continue farther down Page
Mill, venturing west into the foothills
of the Santa Cruz Mountains
The route leads to beautiful Foot
hills Park, a popular city park hidden
among the green hills of the Penin
sula Still relatively wild, the 1400-
acre site serves as a wildlife refuge
and plant preserve in an area increas
ingly threatened by development
Palo Alto residents are proud of the
highly praised park, the result of a
once-controversial investment in

On its way to Foothills Park. Page
Mill Road narrows to two lanes enter
ing Los Altos Mills. Horse riders and
joggers travel along the shoulder in
rain or sun. and the fresh country air
and scenery attract bicycle riders and
motorcyclists as well
New housing developments can be
seen from Page Mill: elegant homes
on large lots, most priced at nearly $1
million Strict zoning laws in the foot
hills have helped to preserve much of
the land, but a shortage of housing on
the Peninsula is increasing pressure
on local governments to allow more
construction.
The road begins to rise, twisting and
turning to new heights above the green
valley, while cars strain in second
gear and bicyclists begin to sweat. Af

straight-of-wav leading to Foothills
Park

into sight on the right as Page Mill
Road veers left in its climb toward
Skyline Boulevard All park visitors
are required to stop at the small one
room checkpoint, manned during park
hours -Ja m to 5:30 p m in winter
Foothills Park is owned and main
tained bv the city of Palo Alto, which
enforces entrance requirements No
one is allowed to enter without a li
brary card, driver's license or utility
bill proving Palo Alto residency City
employees are exempt from this rule,
but Palo Alto property owners living
outside the city are not
Park rangers state that bicyclists
and joggers often slip past the gate
without identification, and visitors
who can't find a Palo Alto resident to
accompany them have climbed over
fences For many, resorting to stealth
is the only way to enter the park
Fences around Foothills Park —
chain-link along some sections of
Page Mill Road and split-rail
elsewhere — are reportedly meant to
keep out four-wheel drive vehicles and
motorcycles. Before their installa
tion. vandals tore down young trees,
regularly left piles of beer cans from
their parties and set fire to the en
trance station twice. Fences have
helped to cut vandalism, but they don't
keep out everyone. According to Foot

The 1400 acres of park land were
sold to the city by Dr. Russel Lee. a
former professor at the Medical
School and official doctor for five
Stanford presidents Lee still owns 600
acres of neighboring land, and at 85-
vears-old says he is considering sell

the rest for his grandchildren.
Lee calls Foothills Park "the best

Palo Mto purchased the park from
U'e in two sections The first purchase
ot 1200 acres for $13 million was au
thorized by the Palo Alto City Council
in I)ecember of 1958 and was approved
b\ a city-wide referendum in Mav of
1959 \n additional 200 acres were
bought in 1965 for $500,000
During the summer of 1964. 45 high
school and college students were hired
to help build trails and bridges and to
develop picnic sites, roads were con
structed and electricity and water
lines were installed During the park 's

One of Foothills Park's major at
tractions is 12-acre Boronda Lake,
carved out of the flat central valley by
earth moving equipment. Winter
rains keep it brim-full, while in drier
months water is released from the
nearby water tank Looking into the
lake's sparkling waters, rippled by a
light breeze, it's hard to remember
that its depth throughout is only 4 feet
The cool waters are inviting when
temperatures rise into the 80s. Rules

wooded hill that rises in the center and
climb a tree that serves as a look-out

Those who venture to the lake's
west end will find a curious two-foot
hole set in the water a few feet from
the earthen Boronda Lake Dam. Down
this concrete pipe winter overflow wa

to a small canyon where heavy rains
form a seasonal creek
Nearby, natural springs below the
dam feed a thriving marsh. Earthen
dikes built by a summer youth crew
are now covered with watercress and
grasses. thriving cattails, willows and
rushes provide a home for diving
beetles, water striders and micro
scopic protozoans. Mosquito fish were
introduced to control mosquito larvae.

The muddy tracks of raccoons on
their nightly forays can be seen at the

from the hills to drink, and a bobcat

been hunting gophers on the park's

The best views of natural vegetation

But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

gional park in the fcx>thi 1 Is. too."
wrote a reader
But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial
i Nov 3. 19H9i was critical, calling the
policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela
tions practiced by a Bay Area city."
The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op
erate the park
In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.
The I'alo Alto City Council rejected
the offer
\ representative of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threat
ened to sue Palo Alto at a city council
meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees
;it all Palo Alto firms. The ACLU nev
er went to court
But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus
tify the exclusive policy. A report pre
pared by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment says crime would increase be
cause "opening the park to thegeneral
public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio
units and more park personnel are
also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October
For now. the wilderness of Foothills
Park remains closed to non-residents
and there is little chance that those
turned away at the gate will be al
lowed to enter in the future A letter

for the inconvenience and explains

harmed. and they grow readily in a
hot. dry climate California quail and
bewick wrens nest here, and chip
munks and gray foxes roam the area
But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

gional park in the fcx>thi 1 Is. too."

But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial
i Nov 3. 19H9i was critical, calling the
policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela
tions practiced by a Bay Area city."
The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op
erate the park
In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.
The I'alo Alto City Council rejected
the offer
\ representative of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threat
ened to sue Palo Alto at a city council
meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees
;it all Palo Alto firms. The ACLU nev
er went to court
But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus
tify the exclusive policy. A report pre
pared by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment says crime would increase be
cause "opening the park to thegeneral
public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio
units and more park personnel are
also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October

One of Foothills Park's major at

carved out of the flat central valley by
earth moving equipment. Winter
rains keep it brim-full, while in drier
months water is released from the

lake's sparkling waters, rippled by a
light breeze, it's hard to remember
that its depth throughout is only 4 feet

But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial

policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela

The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op

In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.

meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees

But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus

public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio

also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October

But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

gional park in the fcx>thi 1 Is. too."
wrote a reader
But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial
i Nov 3. 19H9i was critical, calling the
policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela
tions practiced by a Bay Area city."
The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op
erate the park
In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.
The I'alo Alto City Council rejected
the offer
\ representative of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threat
ened to sue Palo Alto at a city council
meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees
;it all Palo Alto firms. The ACLU nev
er went to court
But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus
tify the exclusive policy. A report pre
pared by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment says crime would increase be
cause "opening the park to thegeneral
public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio
units and more park personnel are
also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October
For now. the wilderness of Foothills
Park remains closed to non-residents
and there is little chance that those
turned away at the gate will be al
lowed to enter in the future A letter
distributed by park rangers apologizes
for the inconvenience and explains
that the park lias reached its "human

But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

gional park in the fcx>thi 1 Is. too."

But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial

policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela
tions practiced by a Bay Area city."
The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op
erate the park
In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.
The I'alo Alto City Council rejected
the offer

Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threat
ened to sue Palo Alto at a city council
meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees
;it all Palo Alto firms. The ACLU nev
er went to court
But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus
tify the exclusive policy. A report pre
pared by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment says crime would increase be
cause "opening the park to thegeneral
public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio
units and more park personnel are
also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October

One of Foothills Park's major at
tractions is 12-acre Boronda Lake,
carved out of the flat central valley by
earth moving equipment. Winter
rains keep it brim-full, while in drier
months water is released from the
nearby water tank Looking into the
lake's sparkling waters, rippled by a
light breeze, it's hard to remember
that its depth throughout is only 4 feet
The cool waters are inviting when
temperatures rise into the 80s. Rules

the earthen Boronda Lake Dam. Down

form a seasonal creek
Nearby, natural springs below the
dam feed a thriving marsh. Earthen
dikes built by a summer youth crew
are now covered with watercress and
grasses. thriving cattails, willows and
rushes provide a home for diving
beetles, water striders and micro
scopic protozoans. Mosquito fish were
introduced to control mosquito larvae.

The muddy tracks of raccoons on
their nightly forays can be seen at the

from the hills to drink, and a bobcat

But concern for the beauty of Foot
hills Park has contributed to the ongo
ing debate over whether only city resi
dents should be allowed to use it.
The fragile nature of the plant com
munities is one of the reasons for lim
iting visitors, according to Palo Alto
Director of Open Space Management
Larry White. "If the park wereopened
to a larger population base it wouldn't
be long before the park was de
stroyed."
Jerry Lawrence, supervisor of
Foothills Park, lists two other reasons
for excluding non-Palo Altans. First,
when it was initially proposed, some
residents believed the city had no busi
ness creating a "regional" park, and a
group called Citizens for Good Gov
ernment formed to oppose the plan
Led by attorney John Sinclair, the
group filed a taxpayers' suit in Santa
Clara County Superior Court, alleging
that the Palo Alto City Council had vio
lated the city charter by approving the
land purchase without waiting 30 days
for public examination of the expen
diture. The lawsuit was finally re
jected by the California Supreme
Court after a referendum on the park
purchase was approved by Palo Alto
voters.
In what former Palo Alto City Man
ager Jerome Keithlv termed "an at
tempt to salvage the project." and to
appease the regional park fears of
Citizens for Good Government, the
city council announced in January of
1959 that the park would only be open
to Palo Alto residents and their
guests.
Lawrence says a second reason for
keeping the park closed is that inci
dents of crime are up to 100 times
greater in county parks, and he pre
dicts that within five years of opening
the gates. Foothills' rangers would
have to be armed.
Another reason for excluding non
residents. expressed in a letter to the
editor of the I'alo Alto Times l July 13.
1972). is that Palo Altans "wisely"
recognized the value of the park "If
other cities wish for a park like ours,
let them vote for and pay for a re

gional park in the fcx>thi 1 Is. too."
wrote a reader
But a I'ill" Alto Time* editorial
i Nov 3. 19H9i was critical, calling the
policy "beneath Palo Alto's dignity
It said, "shutting neighbors and
strangers alike out of a public park is
one of the worst pieces of human rela
tions practiced by a Bay Area city."
The paper suggested a fee for non-resi
dents or letting Santa Clara County op
erate the park
In fact, in 19f>4 the chairman of the
Santa Clara County Board of Super
visors had called the idea of a private
park "silly" and had offered to con
tribute $5(H).000 if the park were
opened to all north-countv residents.
The I'alo Alto City Council rejected
the offer
\ representative of the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) threat
ened to sue Palo Alto at a city council
meeting in August of 1973. The group's
attorney claimed that banning non
residents violates the equal protection
clause of the 14th Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution Later, the ACLU
said the basis of a suit would be that al
lowing city employees but not private
employees within the city to use the
park is "objectionably dis
criminatory." The city argued in re
ply that administratively it would be
impossible to keep track of employees
;it all Palo Alto firms. The ACLU nev
er went to court
But because of the threatened law
suit . documents were prepared to jus
tify the exclusive policy. A report pre
pared by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment says crime would increase be
cause "opening the park to thegeneral
public would certainly draw a per
centage of undesirables from the Bay
Area." Extra costs for more parking
spaces, sophisticated police radio
units and more park personnel are
also cited in the report.
The most recent request to change
the entrance requirement was made
by Stanford in September, after the
I Tniversity reduced its proposed Peter
Coutts Hill housing development to
preserve open-space land enjoyed by
nearby Palo Alto residents. As a
trade-off. the University asked Palo
Alto to open Foothills Park to 710 fac
ulty and staff households living on
nearby University property. A mem
ber of the Palo Alto Planning Depart
ment thought the arrangement might
"foster a spirit of cooperation be
tween the University and Palo Alto."
and recommended further inquiry.
But Palo Alto Parks and Open Space
Director Larry White opposed the
idea. "The concept of allowing Stan
ford personnel to use the park is as old
as the park itself." White says. "My
concern is. if we make an exception
for Stanford, what do we tell other
groups, like all the business and in
dustry who own property in Palo Alto

and pav taxes'' " The city subsequently
denied Stanford's request in October
For now. the wilderness of Foothills
Park remains closed to non-residents
and there is little chance that those
turned away at the gate will be al
lowed to enter in the future A letter
distributed by park rangers apologizes
for the inconvenience and explains
that the park lias reached its "human
