# Alum tells of post-revolution life in Iran; he came here when his university closed
## 
### Dan Fiduccia 
Though Iran is in the news virtually every day.the
hostage crisis and the Iran-Iraq war have caused
news coverage to center on the hostages, a few high
government officials and Avatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini. Periodical expulsions of foreign journalists
have made it even more difficult to cover the com
plex problems of a new society in a country which is
quite alien to Americans.
Because of this situation, Americans have heard
little of life in Iran today and what Iranians think of
America. Since Americans can't travel to Iran, and
Iranians are preoccupied with a new system of gov
ernment and a war. they know little about our feel
ings. One person who has been able to live in both
countries is Saeed Kadivar.
Kadivar. a Stanford alumnus, returned to the Bay
Area two weeks ago after spending a year and a half
in Iran Kadivar. who completed his Ph D here in
civil engineering, had been teaching since his 1979
graduation at the Isfahan University of Technology.
However, the Iranian government decided to
close all universities last spring, so Kadivar and all
other professors were unable to teach this fall.
"The government feels it's necessary to have a
cultural revolution following the political revolu
tion, so they started with schools," explained
Kadivar "First they opened schools to everyone,
and put in new principals and new textbooks." While
grammar high schools remain open, college "stu
dents and professors are pressuring the government
to reopen the universities in the spring, but I don't
think it will happen."
Before his 1979 return to Iran, Kadivar had last
been in Iran during 1975 and 1976, while the shah was
still in power.
Voices heard
Discussing the change in government, Kadivar
said "it's good that the shah was overthrown, be
cause the people then gained some voice in govern
ment However, Kadivar pointed out that "a lot of
the progressive political forces who were respon
sible for overthrowing the shah are not being heard
now."
Kadivar discussed three areas where the present
government is having problems.
The much-publicized transformation of Iran into
an Islamic republic has brought its problems. "I be
lieve politics and religion can't be combined in run
ning a country," said Kadivar. The present regime
"brings total Islamic values — wtych are poorly de

fined by the regime — in a hurry into the govern
ment. Why, for example, is it necessary for all wom
en and girls to wear hejob (traditional Islamic
dress) in schools and at work?"
Bad policy
Besides lacking a well-established foreign policy,
Kadivar said there was no well-defined economic
policy.
"(President Albohassan) Bani-Sadr says Iran has
a particular order for its economic affairs. The gov
ernment writes books joining socialism and capital
ism. into something which they say is neither social
ism or capitalism but something they call Islamic
economy." Kadivar feels that it will be some time
before a future government can solve Iran's eco
nomic problems.
However, he cautioned that it was too early to
compare the current economic situation with that of
the shah's regime.' 'The shah was in power for three
decades, and so there was something to judge. Now
thee is not enough information to judge the present
with the old economy."
Reforms Vary
Economic reforms under the new government
have included attempts at land-reform and prose
cuting and expelling the uppermost social class
which had profited under the shah
Remarking on the many people who have been ex
ecuted in Iran since the shah was deposed, Kadivar
said "the people wanted them to be executed. The
regime was even forced to take a more serious posi
tion on executions because of the feeling of the peo
ple."
The Iranian-Iraqi war "is the most unfortunate
thing that could have happened. The Iranian govern
ment was not prepared to solve internal problems
and now it has a war on its back," explained
Kadivar. He added that Iranians agree with the gov
ernment that the Iraqis must withdraw from Iran
before there can be peace. "Iranians want to defend
their land, and so political groups and civilians are
fighting with the (Iranian) military."
Shah's mistakes
Avatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has had such power
in Iran because "there is a large number of ignorant
masses, and it will require a large effort to educate
them," said Kadivar. Educated persons and some
parts of the working class have kept track of Kho
meini's successes and failures. "He's just a person
who can make mistakes. He's so involved with his
Islamic values that he may have problems in finding

solution for the masses," said Kadivar, adding that
he didn't think Khomeini's following is as large now
as it was when he returned to Iran.
Kadivar discussed why the 52 American hostages
were seized, and what Iranians think of the hostage
situation. "The Bazargan government didn't estab
lish a policy to be against the U.S., but this was the
will of the people. Iranians wanted a stronger stand
against the U.S. because of its firm support of the
shah until the very end." (The government of Mehti
Bazargan was the first post-shah regime in Iran.)
The anti-U.S. feeling in Iran led to the seizure of the
U.S. Embassy and the eventual resignation of the
Bazargan government.
Kadivar said the government at first couldn't an
swer the question of what to do with the hostages,
but then decided it wanted to negotiate for their re
lease. Even though many people initially wanted the
hostages put on trial, Kadivar said he doubted that
they still have the same position After the aborted
rescue attempt last spring, "the people got quite an
gry." said Kadivar. "They felt the U.S. government
was now their main enemy The worst thing the
Carter Administration ever did was to use force to
free the hostages."
Conditions Stated
Kadivar said Iranians want "a decent exchange"
for the hostages, and noted that some people felt the
four conditions for their release are not enough
Those conditions are a U.S. pledge of non-in
terference in Iranian affairs, releasing Iran's frozen
assets, returning the shah's wealth, and dismissing
all claims against Iran.
The last two demands seem to be blocking the re
lease of the hostages. Kadivar asked "why aren't
you people willing to demonstrate at the Chase
Manhattan Bank over the surpluses they created
from the shah's wealth, and ask them to give it
back 9 Why aren't the families of the hostages pres
suring the individuals who have the shah's money in
their hands 9 "
Kadivar looks forward to better relations between
Americans and Iranians, saying that a friendship or
ganization would be welcomed in Iran so that each
country would understand the other. "There is not
enough information on Iranian values here," he
said. "Iran can not be isolated," concluded Kadivar,
saying that U.S. restrictions on travel of Americans
to Iran should be lifted.
Kadivar plans to return with his family to Iran,
and until then he will teach here

regime was even forced to take a more serious posi
tion on executions because of the feeling of the peo
ple."
The Iranian-Iraqi war "is the most unfortunate
thing that could have happened. The Iranian govern
ment was not prepared to solve internal problems
and now it has a war on its back," explained
Kadivar. He added that Iranians agree with the gov
ernment that the Iraqis must withdraw from Iran
before there can be peace. "Iranians want to defend
their land, and so political groups and civilians are
fighting with the (Iranian) military."
Shah's mistakes
Avatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has had such power
in Iran because "there is a large number of ignorant
masses, and it will require a large effort to educate
them," said Kadivar. Educated persons and some
parts of the working class have kept track of Kho
meini's successes and failures. "He's just a person
who can make mistakes. He's so involved with his
Islamic values that he may have problems in finding

solution for the masses," said Kadivar, adding that
he didn't think Khomeini's following is as large now
as it was when he returned to Iran.
Kadivar discussed why the 52 American hostages
were seized, and what Iranians think of the hostage
situation. "The Bazargan government didn't estab
lish a policy to be against the U.S., but this was the
will of the people. Iranians wanted a stronger stand
against the U.S. because of its firm support of the
shah until the very end." (The government of Mehti
Bazargan was the first post-shah regime in Iran.)
The anti-U.S. feeling in Iran led to the seizure of the
U.S. Embassy and the eventual resignation of the
Bazargan government.
Kadivar said the government at first couldn't an
swer the question of what to do with the hostages,
but then decided it wanted to negotiate for their re
lease. Even though many people initially wanted the
hostages put on trial, Kadivar said he doubted that
they still have the same position After the aborted
rescue attempt last spring, "the people got quite an
gry." said Kadivar. "They felt the U.S. government
was now their main enemy The worst thing the
Carter Administration ever did was to use force to
free the hostages."
Conditions Stated
Kadivar said Iranians want "a decent exchange"
for the hostages, and noted that some people felt the
four conditions for their release are not enough
Those conditions are a U.S. pledge of non-in
terference in Iranian affairs, releasing Iran's frozen
assets, returning the shah's wealth, and dismissing
all claims against Iran.
The last two demands seem to be blocking the re
lease of the hostages. Kadivar asked "why aren't
you people willing to demonstrate at the Chase
Manhattan Bank over the surpluses they created
from the shah's wealth, and ask them to give it
back 9 Why aren't the families of the hostages pres
suring the individuals who have the shah's money in
their hands 9 "
Kadivar looks forward to better relations between
Americans and Iranians, saying that a friendship or
ganization would be welcomed in Iran so that each
country would understand the other. "There is not
enough information on Iranian values here," he
said. "Iran can not be isolated," concluded Kadivar,
saying that U.S. restrictions on travel of Americans
to Iran should be lifted.
Kadivar plans to return with his family to Iran,
and until then he will teach here
Though Iran is in the news virtually every day.the
hostage crisis and the Iran-Iraq war have caused
news coverage to center on the hostages, a few high
government officials and Avatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini. Periodical expulsions of foreign journalists
have made it even more difficult to cover the com
plex problems of a new society in a country which is
quite alien to Americans.
Because of this situation, Americans have heard
little of life in Iran today and what Iranians think of
America. Since Americans can't travel to Iran, and
Iranians are preoccupied with a new system of gov
ernment and a war. they know little about our feel
ings. One person who has been able to live in both
countries is Saeed Kadivar.
Kadivar. a Stanford alumnus, returned to the Bay
Area two weeks ago after spending a year and a half
in Iran Kadivar. who completed his Ph D here in
civil engineering, had been teaching since his 1979
graduation at the Isfahan University of Technology.
However, the Iranian government decided to
close all universities last spring, so Kadivar and all
other professors were unable to teach this fall.
"The government feels it's necessary to have a
cultural revolution following the political revolu
tion, so they started with schools," explained
Kadivar "First they opened schools to everyone,
and put in new principals and new textbooks." While
grammar high schools remain open, college "stu
dents and professors are pressuring the government
to reopen the universities in the spring, but I don't
think it will happen."
Before his 1979 return to Iran, Kadivar had last
been in Iran during 1975 and 1976, while the shah was
still in power.
Voices heard
Discussing the change in government, Kadivar
said "it's good that the shah was overthrown, be
cause the people then gained some voice in govern
ment However, Kadivar pointed out that "a lot of
the progressive political forces who were respon
sible for overthrowing the shah are not being heard
now."
Kadivar discussed three areas where the present
government is having problems.
The much-publicized transformation of Iran into
an Islamic republic has brought its problems. "I be
lieve politics and religion can't be combined in run
ning a country," said Kadivar. The present regime
"brings total Islamic values — wtych are poorly de

fined by the regime — in a hurry into the govern
ment. Why, for example, is it necessary for all wom
en and girls to wear hejob (traditional Islamic
dress) in schools and at work?"
Bad policy
Besides lacking a well-established foreign policy,
Kadivar said there was no well-defined economic
policy.
"(President Albohassan) Bani-Sadr says Iran has
a particular order for its economic affairs. The gov
ernment writes books joining socialism and capital
ism. into something which they say is neither social
ism or capitalism but something they call Islamic
economy." Kadivar feels that it will be some time
before a future government can solve Iran's eco
nomic problems.
However, he cautioned that it was too early to
compare the current economic situation with that of
the shah's regime.' 'The shah was in power for three
decades, and so there was something to judge. Now
thee is not enough information to judge the present
with the old economy."
Reforms Vary
Economic reforms under the new government
have included attempts at land-reform and prose
cuting and expelling the uppermost social class
which had profited under the shah
Remarking on the many people who have been ex
ecuted in Iran since the shah was deposed, Kadivar
said "the people wanted them to be executed. The
regime was even forced to take a more serious posi
tion on executions because of the feeling of the peo
ple."
The Iranian-Iraqi war "is the most unfortunate
