# Cyclists cross country to fund conservation
## 
### Eric Cornell 
Two thousand five hundred miles of
mountains, deserts, and endless corn
fields — that's what two Stanford stu
dents cycled across this summer to
raise money for student energy
projects.
Sophomores Rich Hefter and Mike
Siegel obtained hundreds of pennv-a
mile pledges totaling more than
$10,000 for their month-long, pedal
pushing pilgrimage to their home in
Wilmette, Illinois.
According to Hefter, the two de
cided to make the trip last fall. "Mike
is really interested in biking. He was
taking Italian and saw Breaking
A n ay. When he brought up the idea
last fall. I said. 'OK. lets go.' " says
Hefter
The two approached Paul Edwards
of the Office of Development with
questions about fundraising pro
cedures.
"I ended up teaching them —
through SCIRE — a course in fun
draising techniques." says Edwards.
"They learned how to write grant ap
plications and how to appeal to or
ganizations to back them."
The two left campus at the end of
exam week, and headed almost im
mediately into the toughest cycling of
their trip. "Going over the Sierras was
physically the hardest part ot the trip
But it was near the beginning and our
excitement level was high. It was a
real challenge." says Hefter.
The least enjoyable stretch for the
two cyclists was through the state of
Nebraska According to Hefter. "it
was hot and humid and seemed to go
on forever " But Hefter notes that
"the people there and all along our trip
were great.
"We would go into a Dairy Bar
along the way and people at the coun
ter were not strangers People would

realize we weren't just your average
motorists." says Hefter.
Nor was the hospitality they en
countered on their journey limited to
just friendliness. "When we told them
what we were doing, motel managers
and people we met all along the way
would put us up a night for free." says
Hefter.
About $6000 of the pledged money
has already been collected "Money is
still coming in We are hoping that
people who have pledged won't
forget." says Hefter
The money will go into a student
project fund that Hefter envisions pro
viding cash to student-conceived con
servation projects. "The money will
go to dorms, to SWOPSI classes,
groups of students, anyone with plans
but no money." he adds.
The money will be available for use
next quarter. Students may apply
through John Eaton at the Housing
Energy Conservation Center (HECC)
in Crothers Memorial for grants. The
HECC was created 3 1 2 years ago to re
duce energy use in on-campus hous
ing By installing attic insulation and
low-flow shower heads in under
graduate residences, and by other
energy conserving innovations, the
HECC has reduced residence energy
use by 15 to 20 percent
Eaton points out that possible
projects include, but are not limited
to, active solar installations like hot
water heaters He suggests conserva
tion measures such as insulating win
dow shades; passive heating such as
painting an exterior southern ex
posure with black, heat-absorbing
paint; and publicity campaigns to in
crease conservation awareness
through art flyers and Daily ads. "For
things like this and other practical
ideas students may coine up with, fun
ding could be available." savs Eaton
