It's the old theme of reality vs
illusion, but in an astonishingly
witty new setting The director.
Richard Rush, reverses every au
dience expectation in this
audacious, kinetic comedy about
making movies. Peter O'Toole
gives an imaginative, self-de
lighted performance as Eli Cross,
a filmmaker who revels in risks,
and Steve Railsback plays the
stunt man The cast also includes
Allen Goorwitz (who used to be
called Allen Garfield) in another
good performance (as a
screenwriter) and Barbara
Hershey (who used to be called
Barbara Hershey Seagull).

Admittedly, there's something
innately satisfying about seeing a
shopping center destroyed, store
by store Rut when director John
I«indis \nuntil Huu>i i attempts
to extend this aesthetic of destruc
tion over two hours the whole ex
ercise becomes innately boring.
John Belushi and Dan Avkrovd are
the ostensible stars, but they're
hidden behind dark glasses and im
pend table gags, and we never get
any feeling for who they're sup
posed to be What we know about
their characters is what we find
out second-hand from the calamity
that's taking place all around
them Human beings are negative
spaces in this movie they're
something to explode buildings
around, and crash cars on top of.
It's hard not to be a little sickened
at the thought of the film's $32 mil
lion budget it's a figure high
enough to make even slapstick
seem tragic
Plays Saturday and Sunday

Director David l.ynch does a
masterful job in his first major

John Hurt is absolutely believable
in this difficult role, managing to

convey the dignitv with which
Merrick comports hansel) despite

This Brazilian import, directed
by Carlos Diegues. is a funny, oc
casionally raunchy comedy about
trying to survive in a country
that's "progressing'' so rapidly
that it's easy to get left behind in a
mire of poverty and lost dreams.
The movie begins when a
carnival, crammed onto a beat-up
flatbed truck, rolls into a small
town in the Brazilian backlands.
The troupe can offer nothing to
anyone: they're neither cvncial
enough to compete with the new
entertainment. TV. nor sincere
enough to bring the miracles that
the TV-less peasants expect from
them The only thing left to the
troupe, it seems, is prostitution,
and that is what they must turn to
survive Director Diegues does a
fine job of highlighting this clash
between dreams and economics.

This movie puts its tasteful, icy
cold grip on you right away—after
the first few minutes, you know
you're there to really learn some
thing The characters spend their
time learning fundamental truths
about each other
Director Robert Redford's
style is more suited to Master
piece Theater than to the movies;
his airtight, squeaky clean shot
making and his precision with the
actors squeeze the life right out of
this picture Timothy Hutton's
searing portrayal of the troubled
youth is fine, and Mary Tyler
Moore sometimes overwhelms as
Hutton's mother But this movie
about a family never makes you
feel that you've really captured
the family's heart and soul-its
guts.
