(Josh, aren't bodily functions
funny' Chaparral thinks so. In
their fall quarter issue, the staff
has gone for punchlines that in
volve spitting, sweating, drool
ing. going to the bathroom (my
phraseology — Chappie prefers
"poopie"). vomiting and that
bodily function that is holier
than holy to half the human race
(the other half generally works
for the magazine*: I mean, of
course, ejaculation ihee-hee
heei.
Why the Chaparral staffers
think that bodies and what they
do in social situations is so funny
is a mystery to me My guess is
that either they have no b<x1ily
functions, or else they have
them all — incessantly!'
On the other hand, is that so
terrible? Anyone who has ever
picked up a copy of Chaparral
already knows that it special
izes in parodies built upon
locker-room and or bathroom
humor We understand, and we
forgive Because after all. the
point is not the poopie. it 's what
it's being thrown at. and how
well \nd I'm proud to report
that in this issue. Chaparral
takes aim like an expert, and
rarely misses the mark
The general target is Ameri
cana As it turns out. however,
the theme is really only a loose
conceptual net thrown over a lot
of stories that have very little to
do with one another The more
Americana-oriented material
includes "The Grapes of
Moth." in which Portnoy is dis
located in Oklahoma, where cir
cumcision is a noveltv the hero

can exploit to his own peculiar
ends: "Liberty House." a comic
hook version of the founding
fathers as a college fraternity
and a thinly veiled excuse to in
dulge in some rotten (funny 0 )
one-liners (eg "Give me
libido, or give me death'"):
"Success Stories." a great pre
cis of people of identi
cal age growing up in America.
Africa. India and China, and
"American Folk Art." in which
Br'er Rabbit, about to be
