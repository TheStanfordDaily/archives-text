The American Poetry Series has published a wide range of
poets in the past poets as diverse as John Crowe Ransom and
James Tate, as different as Louise Bogan and John Asbery It
has selected a few poets more than once Louise Gluck is one
of those few
In her new bcxik. Descending Figure, Cluck seems for the
most part to gather the strengths of her two earlier ones, the
second chosen by the APS. and to sift off the weaknesses. It is
in this light especially that Descending Figure shines.
One can perhaps best see Gluck's development in contrast
to both Sexton and Adrienne Rich Brevity requires general
ity here, and no injustice is intended to either of these poets.
But reading all of Sexton, one cannot help feeling that the
clout of her first two or three books loses out in the end to a
self-conscious imitation of her original spirit With Rich, on
the other hand, political and social clout come into their own,
but a rhetorical mishmash has driven art away.
In different ways. Gluck's initial book. Firstborn, re
sembles the early work of both Sexton and Rich There are the
powerful psychological poems, in Sexton fashion, centering
around the individual's relationships to others — particularly
husbands, children and parents — as well as the relationship
to herself And vet the poems are written in rhyme and vary
ing types of meter, as was Rich's first book The fascinating
thing, though, is that Rich later stated that formal poetry
could not handle such psychologically "hot" poems.
M;inv of the formal poems in First burn seem to belie this.
"The Egg." in which internal rhyme and off-rhyme pre
dominate. is an example: "The thing Is hatching. Look. The
bones Are bending to give wav./It's dark It's dark /He's
brought a bowl to catch The pieces of the baby."
In her second book. The House on Marshland, Gluck gives
over much of the formalism of Firstborn. And. indeed, what
she has lost in form she gains in expansion, a freeing of the
mind to turn events this way and that, to mull them over. Yet
the best of these looser considerations retain the strength or
clout of the earlier poems, as in "Poem." "Love Poem."
"Hrennende I Ache, "and "Here Are My Black Clothes."
Often, however, the free verse of The House on Marshland
gets away from Gluck and dwindles into vagueness. In De
scending Figure, this does not happen. The formal poems of
Firstborn and the free verse of The House on Marshland find
a mean in the new book.
She gives herself room to consider things more fully than
she did in her formal poetry. But the poems are clearer,
tighter and more controlled than in her previous free verse.
In Descending Figure, Louise Gluck combines qualities
which have made Sexton and Rich important poets: psy
chological insight, power and political awareness. In addi
tion. she has avoided Sexton's later lapse into self-imitation
as well as Rich's political rhetoric. Many of the poems in De
scending Figure bear witness to this, as do the final stanzas
of "Aphrodite:" "In time, the young wife/naturally hardens.
Drifting/from her side, in imagination,/the man returns not
toa drudge/but to the goddess he projects./On a hill, thearm
less figure/welcomes the delinquent boat,/her thighs
cemented shut, barring/the fault in the rock
