Printers, Inc.

Walking into Printers, Inc.
located at 310 California
Ave., is like walking into an
enormous living room. At
16,000 square feet.

• It's difficult to imagine a
supermarket-sized store
feeling like a cozy living
room, but that's all the more
ifeason why the bicycle trip
to Printers is worth the ride.
The store is stocked with all
Sorts of books ranging from
good fiction to technical
books, and from social sci
ences to a children's section.
It also carries a number of
foreign newspapers and has

Browsing can be very dan

of wooden bookshelves. Indi
an tapestries, photos of old
Palo Alto lining the walls and
the espresso-bar/cafe in the
corner create the sort of at
mosphere that's easy to es
cape into and exceedingly
difficult to leave.

Jeffrey Shurtleff. one of
the five owner-originators of
Printers Inc describes the
store as a community place
where people can come and
just relax Yet he said the
difference between this and
other coffee house-book
stores is that Printers is pri
marily a major bookstore
and the espresso bar is just
part of the Printers Inc. en
vironment
Besides espresso, the bar
offers capuccino. an
aromatic selection of teas,
plus a number of edible-look
ing pastries and cakes. The
orange-oatmeal cookies
were too much for this re
porter to pass up. providing a
good excuse to have a seat
and observe the Printers Inc.
crowd.
A gathering place for Stan
ford students living off cam
pus and Palo Alto locals, the
cafe is a sort of a community
melting pot. Since Printers
Inc. stays open until 11 every
night, it's an ideal change of
scenery from Green and
Meyer libraries.
At the same time, be pre
pared to sacrifice a few
chapters of reading, since
the temptation to do a little
book-browsing and people
watching is hard to pass by.

Shirley Cobb \s

The Shirley Cobb book
store is a few doors down
from Megabooks. right
beside the New Varsity thea
ter. Shirley Cobb's has been a
Palo Alto establishment for
40 years, and yes. there real
ly is a Shirley Cobb Shirley
Cobb's carries about 98
percent hard-cover books.
This seems rare today, but
the store began that way in
1940 when paperbacks were
almost non-existent. One
employee said that Shirley
Cobb has always had a pref
erence for quality, and there
fore deals almost exclusively
with hard-bound books even
today
The store carries a large
selection of fiction and non
fiction. art books,
cookbooks, and childrens
books. They also backstock a
number of items, which
means if something was pub
lished in the past and is hard
to find. Shirley Cobbs might
still have it. they'll also do
special ordering if a cus
tomer needs something they
don't have on the shelves.

Stacey \s

Stacy's bookstore, just
across the street and one
block down from the
Plowshare, new on Univer
sity. having just recently
moved from California Ave.
However Stacev's isn't new
to Palo Alto, as they've been
on the Peninsula since 1934
Dealing mainly in techni
cal books. Stacev's carries a
complete line on medicine,
electronics, computing, and
engineering
Joan Whitluck. manager
at Stacev's for the past two
years, said that when they're
settled with the new location,
she plan on expanding into a
line of trade books as well.
She is also beginning to supp
ly extras like cards and sta
tionary.

Megabooks

Megabooks. located at 444
University Ave., was opened
seven years ago by Jerry and
Lee Marsullo. who worked
their way through college
clerking in bookstores.
Megabooks is somewhat
unique from the other stores
reviewed, in the words of
Jerry Marsullo. they deal
with "101 percent used
books." He says their whole
aim is to supply "good clean
books at low prices."
Most of the books are
marked down 50 percent and
all appear to be in excellent
condition. The store isn't too
large, yet has many of the
classics and some good fic
tion. A number of books
looked as if they came from
Literature classes here, and
Megabooks would be worth
looking into for finding read
ing list items at good prices.
The Marsullos will price
and accept books in good con
dition, so Megabooks is also a
place to remember the day
the dorm bookshelves begin

overflowing.
Megabooks appeals to a
wide range of the communi
ty: from senior citizen to
Stanford students, and the
Marsullos themselves ob
viously enjoy their business.
Jerry Marsullo concluded
that "Opening a bookstore
because you love to read is
like opening a restaurant be
cause you love to eat."

Plowshare and
Seed Center

The Plowshare and Seed
Center bookstore, at 162 Uni
versity Avenue, was started
up by five former Stanford
students and it too offers a
community-oriented en
vironment.

Specializing in women's,
spiritual, philosophical,
health books and quality fic
tion. the Plowshare opened
eleven years ago and has
been increasing its involve
ment in local activities ever
since. Besides participating
in book faires and con
ferences they provide poetry
readings regularly. In addi
tion to books Plowshare is
filled with interesting cards
and posters. An unusual
selection of small label and
import records, including a
large collection of dulcimer
albums, is also worth a look.

Megabooks

Megabooks. located at 444
University Ave., was opened
seven years ago by Jerry and
Lee Marsullo. who worked
their way through college
clerking in bookstores.
Megabooks is somewhat
unique from the other stores
reviewed, in the words of
Jerry Marsullo. they deal
with "101 percent used
books." He says their whole
aim is to supply "good clean
books at low prices."
Most of the books are
marked down 50 percent and
all appear to be in excellent
condition. The store isn't too
large, yet has many of the
classics and some good fic
tion. A number of books
looked as if they came from
Literature classes here, and
Megabooks would be worth
looking into for finding read
ing list items at good prices.
The Marsullos will price
and accept books in good con
dition, so Megabooks is also a
place to remember the day
the dorm bookshelves begin

overflowing.
Megabooks appeals to a
wide range of the communi
ty: from senior citizen to
Stanford students, and the
Marsullos themselves ob
viously enjoy their business.
Jerry Marsullo concluded
that "Opening a bookstore
because you love to read is
like opening a restaurant be
cause you love to eat."

Plowshare and
Seed Center

The Plowshare and Seed
Center bookstore, at 162 Uni

up by five former Stanford
students and it too offers a
community-oriented en
vironment.

Specializing in women's,
spiritual, philosophical,
health books and quality fic
tion. the Plowshare opened
eleven years ago and has
been increasing its involve
ment in local activities ever
since. Besides participating
in book faires and con
ferences they provide poetry
readings regularly. In addi
tion to books Plowshare is
filled with interesting cards
and posters. An unusual
selection of small label and
import records, including a
large collection of dulcimer
albums, is also worth a look.
