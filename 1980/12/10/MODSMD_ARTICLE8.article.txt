## Tide of Gulf war turning, Iran may gain advantage 
### Los Angeles Times 
Beirut, Lebanon — The tide in the war between
Iran and Iraq may be on the point of turning. Arab
and Western analysts believe
Iran's motley and sometimes ill-coordinated
force of mullahs. Revolutionary Guards and regu
lar army troops has not moved fully to the of
fensive. and it is probably incapable of mounting
broad counterthrusts into the invading Iraqi lines,
diplomats and other analysts say.
Nevertheless. Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr may have been correct last week when
he said the war had entered its "second phase."
The Iraqis' forward progress, slow and ponderous
during the first 10 weeks of the war. seems to have
shuddered to a dead halt For the first time. Iran's
unconfirmed claims of minor victories in the field
sound credible
"The Iranians are showing more organization
and more flexibility than anvone gave them credit

\eirs analysis

for. ' a diplomat from one of the small Arab coun
tries of the Persian Gulf said "All of a sudden, we
are hedging our bets."
"The Iraqi aggression has been defeated."
Bani-Sadr proclaimed, somewhat prematurely.
"The second phase, when our forces will expel the
enemy from the borders, has begun ."
The Iranians have not even begun to push Iraqi
units back to the frontier But in unusually de
tailed battlefield communiques last week, they
described a series of helicopter strikes against
Iraqi positions in the hills of Ilam Province, east
of Baghdad, and said the Iraqis had fled at least
four forward posts.
The Iranian claim was not independently con
firmed ; it would not in any case add up to a major
victory. But along with other reports, it did in
dicate that some of the more than 700 U.S.-made
helicopters in Iran are now operational Also. Iraq
did not deny the claim with a battlefield report of
its own. as it usually has in the past.
Iraq still holds about 8000 square miles of Iran's
desert wasteland, an area roughly the size of New
Jersey. It "encircled" a half dozen Iranian towns
— on three sides, as Iraqi officials say — but it has
taken none of them.
Even Khorramshahr. the Iranian port on the
Shatt al-Arab River, which was the first major
Iraqi objective, still harbors pockets of resisting
Revolutionary Guards
Baghdad's propaganda communiques have

slowly and quietly downgraded its army's objec
tives. from Abadan to Ahvaz to Dezful and now
Susangerd. a small city of relatively little
strategic value. Like the others. Susangerd has
managed to hold on.
Part of the Iranians' unexpected success in de
fending its desert cities appears to be due to a
basic agreement on organization and strategy
within the Supreme Defense Council. Iran's "war
cabinet." The council includes members of the
same contending moderate and radical Islamic
factions that have struggled over the issue of the
52 American hostages for more than a year On
the conduct of the war they have had little dis
cernible conflict. The radical Revolutionary
(iuards. imbued with the ideal of religious mar
tyrdom. appear to have agreed to take charge of
the defense of cities like Khorramshahr. Abadan
and Susangerd. leaving the army to engage in
more conventional warfare.
Both Iran and Iraq now say they are braced for
a long period of inconclusive fighting — a "war of
attrition" in which the real battle will be for sup
plies: the winner may be the last nation to run out
of fuel and ammunition.
Iraq still appears to hold a material advantage
there — a factor that may encourage Iran to try to
mount a counteroffensive. which, in Bani-Sadr's
calculations, could so weaken Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's prestige as to turn the war
around
It is virtually impossible to determine which
side has taken the greater losses in men and mate
rials. The communiques released by the two dic
tatorial regimes are often vague, and apparently
full of wishful thinking; typically, the Iranians
will claim 40 Iraqi dead against only five Iranians
lost on a day the Iraqis will claim almost precisely
opposite numbers.
Nor are there any precise estimates of the fi
nancial cost of the war. although it has been esti
mated th.it lr r, q loses $3.5 million in oil revenue
for every hour that its gulf loading terminals are
out of action.
Both countries have begun exporting oil again
— Iraq via a pipeline west across Turkey and Iran
from ports along its Gulf coast — but at a level far
lower than that before the war.
Winter may break the stalemate. Each side is
waiting for the other to break; that point may
come when Iranian citizens in snowy Tehran run
out of heating fuel, or when their Iraqi coun
terparts in Baghdad decide that too many of their
sons are dying for too little reward.
