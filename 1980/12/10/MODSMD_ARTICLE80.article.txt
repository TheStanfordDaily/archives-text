s
first stanza from"( Just
Starting Over," the lead
cpt on Double Fantasy, John
Leftnon's and Yoko Ono's latest
atbum. exemplifies much of the
problem with the record. Love
ha§ made Lennon and Ono,
wjwse previous albums are at
lesjst interesting, painstakingly
duH. John and Yoko would prob
ably give each other Grammys
fof their work here. Un
fortunately. nobodv else would.
•John and Yoko subtitle their
album, "A Heart Play," and it
i?supposed to function. I think,
dialogue between two lov
efa who also happen to be
creative geniuses. Lennon
opsns side one with the cut
qlroted above, something
hatched fresh out of a Captain
aiip Tennille henhouse. Lennon

clearly suffers more from
love's general peachiness. His
solo music of the past has been
toughened by simple lyrics
based on themes of social in
justice and alienation. John had
Yoko then, which overrules the
love-squelches-genius (a la Mc-
Cartney ) theory. Something has
happened, though, between
those past efforts and this one,
and Lennon's music and lyrics
on Double Fantasy wander aim
lessly through a junkyard of
top-40 cliches.
Lennon briefly reveals some
inspiration in the last song on
the first side. "Beautiful Boy,"
where the honesty of feeling ac
tually overcomes soppy sen
timentality in an oceanside love
song to his son.
Before you cross the street
take my hand.
Life is what happens to you
while you're busy making
other plans.
This moment on the album
would resound even more if its
sentiments were unique to the
God-we're-happy tone which
smothers the album.
Yoko's songs are infinitely
more original than John's, not to

mention more palatable. Her
voice is clear and vibrant, espe
cially on the more new-wave
cuts on the album, such as "Kiss
Kiss Kiss" and "Give Me Some
thing." But the slower ballads
sometimes lapse into the trite
and overstated, as in "Hard
Times Are Over," which seems
to be constructed from a closet
full of hand-me-down chords.
"I'm Your Angel" is a funny,
cute, song, and would be pleas
ing in its 1940s flavor were it not
surrounded by songs less aptly
reminiscent of the same.
In "I'm Moving On." sung in
response to Lennon's "I'm Los
ing You." Yoko uses a (boring)
Lennonesque lyric and chord
progression, as if resorting to
John's trite ways in order to

communicate with him. This is
sadly emblematic — both ar
tists seem to have to wallow in
reciprocal cliche in order to me
diate between their two gen
iuses.
What can be learned from
Double Fantasy? Not much, for
its audience. But if you're a pop
star:
a) stay unhappy. If you
aren't, get there.
b) be extremely bitter, if pos
sible, and
c) don't expect nice reviews
from cynical college students.
Editor's note: the above re
view was written before the
tragic shooting death of ■John
Lennon Monday night.
