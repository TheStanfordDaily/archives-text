# Young too lazy on new album
## 
### Charles Buckley 
Neil Young's newest release. Hawks and
I kibes, makes clear the fact that the sudden
burst of energy which led to the creation of
Young's late-'7os masterpiece. Rust Never
Steeps, has worn away, and has been re
placed by a kind of apathy which one would
expect from a rock star who has ac
complished everything twice over. Hawks
and Doves is Young's least ambitious, most
ignoble album to date, and it stands out as
thgfirst album in the long career of rock and
rdH's foremost genius that hardly is worth
lisfcening to.
Two songs on the album, "The Old Home
stead" and "Little Wing." are exceptions,
bu£ what has to be remembered here is the
faet that Young wrote and recorded both of
the songs five years ago ("Little Wing" in
1975 and"The Old Homestead" in 1974).
"The Old Homestead," with its haunting,
surrealistic story line, is reminiscent of
"Last Trip to Tulsa," the classic from
Yo'ung's first album. "Little Wing," with its
dark simplicity, would have fit better on
1975's bleak but brilliant Tonight's the
Night, the album for which the song was
probably originally intended.
Both songs offer the Neil Young whom so
m&ny have come to love — the epileptic Cal
ifornia millions ire whining away in a
manner which elicits a kind of roman
ticism often forgotten in this age of A
bombs and bottle-babies.
Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on
Hawks and Doves do not offer this same
Neil Young. Rather, what one is given is a
series of pieces which were seemingly put
together just because the record company
said that it was time for them to be. Though
the lyrics to all the songs are painted on the
inside jacket cover, they could just as well
not have been, for they lack that certain
quality which has made so many of Young's
past lyrics so memorable; little of what is
said is in any way profound, and even less is

in any way poetic.
One might hope that this lyrical dearth
might be compensated for musically, but
such is far from the case: Young's guitar
work suffices, but anyone looking for am
phetamous riffs like those on past songs
such as "Like A Hurricane" or "Southern
Man" would be better off buying an old
Young bootleg, for such riffs are certainly
lacking on Hawks and Doves

Ihere's nothing wrong with
. . . fooling around with a
new kind of sound just for
kicks, hut the results . . .
would best be left on a tape
for Young's own use.

The songs on the second side of the album,
all recorded during a brief session in Holly
wood this past year, feature the "Hawks
and Doves Band" which Young first in
troduced at the Bread and Roses Festival in
Berkeley back in October; Greg Thomas on
drums. Dennis Belfield on bass, Ben Keith
on steel guitar. Rufus Thibodeaux on fiddle,
and Ann Hilary O'Brien singing background
vocals. None of the members of Young's
usual accompanying band. Crazy Horse, are
featured, and save for Ben Keith, who
played on Harvest, the members of this new
group are unknown to past Young albums.
All of the songs on this side have a South
ern aura to them. Featuring an upbeat, dix
ieland sound accompanied by cheerful lyr
ics that are directed toward Young's new
"angel and queen," the songs "Stayin'
Power" and "Coastline" allow the listener
to know that Neil's latest marriage is going
quite well, but do little beyond that. The oth
er three songs — "Union Man," "Comin'

Apart at Every Nail," and "Hawks and
Doves" — stray away from Young's person
al experiences and instead conjure up the
image of a hillbilly working man struggling
along with his country to make ends meet.
The overall sound is characteristic of that
which one would hear at the local barn
dance in a small Tennessee town: the com
bination of Thibodeaux's fiddling and
Young's extremely nasal vocals creates a
certain "hickness" which makes the songs
rather fun to listen to the first few times, but
allows them to wear out quickly.
Aside from "Little Wing" and"The Old
Homestead," there are also two other
acoustic songs on the album. "Lost In
Space" sounds as though Neil was just that
when he wrote it, as it features such sub
jects as "marine munchkins" and "infinity
boards" (perhaps household items in years
to come?).
The core problem with Hawks and Dove*
is the overall laziness which Neil Young
must have been feeling while making the
album. There's nothing wrong with getting
a few friends together and fooling around
with a new kind of sound just for kicks, but
the results of such a project would best be
left on a tape for Young's own use. After all,
it's said that he is supposed to have at least
19 albums worth of unreleased material,
and there surely would have been no harm
done in taking that total up to 19'/ 2 . To take
20 minutes of music (which is about the total
of all the new material on the album), and
try to convert it into a whole album is to say
that one has neither the time nor the energy
to put out a full album's worth of material.
It's no hidden fact that Young spent a
good part of the summer sailing around the
tropics, and so perhaps the lesson here is
that those who plan to become rich and fa
mous rock and roll stars would do best not to
take time off from writing and recording,
and then to make an album using the materi
al produced during that time.

er three songs — "Union Man," "Comin'

Apart at Every Nail," and "Hawks and
Doves" — stray away from Young's person
al experiences and instead conjure up the
image of a hillbilly working man struggling
along with his country to make ends meet.
The overall sound is characteristic of that
which one would hear at the local barn
dance in a small Tennessee town: the com
bination of Thibodeaux's fiddling and
Young's extremely nasal vocals creates a
certain "hickness" which makes the songs
rather fun to listen to the first few times, but
allows them to wear out quickly.
Aside from "Little Wing" and"The Old
Homestead," there are also two other
acoustic songs on the album. "Lost In
Space" sounds as though Neil was just that
when he wrote it, as it features such sub
jects as "marine munchkins" and "infinity
boards" (perhaps household items in years
to come?).
The core problem with Hawks and Dove*
is the overall laziness which Neil Young
must have been feeling while making the
album. There's nothing wrong with getting
a few friends together and fooling around
with a new kind of sound just for kicks, but
the results of such a project would best be
left on a tape for Young's own use. After all,
it's said that he is supposed to have at least
19 albums worth of unreleased material,
and there surely would have been no harm
done in taking that total up to 19'/ 2 . To take
20 minutes of music (which is about the total
of all the new material on the album), and
try to convert it into a whole album is to say
that one has neither the time nor the energy
to put out a full album's worth of material.
It's no hidden fact that Young spent a
good part of the summer sailing around the
tropics, and so perhaps the lesson here is
that those who plan to become rich and fa
mous rock and roll stars would do best not to
take time off from writing and recording,
and then to make an album using the materi
al produced during that time.
Neil Young's newest release. Hawks and
I kibes, makes clear the fact that the sudden
burst of energy which led to the creation of
Young's late-'7os masterpiece. Rust Never
Steeps, has worn away, and has been re
placed by a kind of apathy which one would
expect from a rock star who has ac
complished everything twice over. Hawks
and Doves is Young's least ambitious, most
ignoble album to date, and it stands out as
thgfirst album in the long career of rock and
rdH's foremost genius that hardly is worth
lisfcening to.
Two songs on the album, "The Old Home
stead" and "Little Wing." are exceptions,
bu£ what has to be remembered here is the
faet that Young wrote and recorded both of
the songs five years ago ("Little Wing" in
1975 and"The Old Homestead" in 1974).
"The Old Homestead," with its haunting,
surrealistic story line, is reminiscent of
"Last Trip to Tulsa," the classic from
Yo'ung's first album. "Little Wing," with its
dark simplicity, would have fit better on
1975's bleak but brilliant Tonight's the
Night, the album for which the song was
probably originally intended.
Both songs offer the Neil Young whom so
m&ny have come to love — the epileptic Cal
ifornia millions ire whining away in a
manner which elicits a kind of roman
ticism often forgotten in this age of A
bombs and bottle-babies.
Unfortunately, the rest of the songs on
Hawks and Doves do not offer this same
Neil Young. Rather, what one is given is a
series of pieces which were seemingly put
together just because the record company
said that it was time for them to be. Though
the lyrics to all the songs are painted on the
inside jacket cover, they could just as well
not have been, for they lack that certain
quality which has made so many of Young's
past lyrics so memorable; little of what is
said is in any way profound, and even less is

in any way poetic.
One might hope that this lyrical dearth
might be compensated for musically, but
such is far from the case: Young's guitar
work suffices, but anyone looking for am
phetamous riffs like those on past songs
such as "Like A Hurricane" or "Southern
Man" would be better off buying an old
Young bootleg, for such riffs are certainly
lacking on Hawks and Doves

Ihere's nothing wrong with
. . . fooling around with a
new kind of sound just for
kicks, hut the results . . .
would best be left on a tape
for Young's own use.

The songs on the second side of the album,
all recorded during a brief session in Holly
wood this past year, feature the "Hawks
and Doves Band" which Young first in
troduced at the Bread and Roses Festival in
Berkeley back in October; Greg Thomas on
drums. Dennis Belfield on bass, Ben Keith
on steel guitar. Rufus Thibodeaux on fiddle,
and Ann Hilary O'Brien singing background
vocals. None of the members of Young's
usual accompanying band. Crazy Horse, are
featured, and save for Ben Keith, who
played on Harvest, the members of this new
group are unknown to past Young albums.
All of the songs on this side have a South
ern aura to them. Featuring an upbeat, dix
ieland sound accompanied by cheerful lyr
ics that are directed toward Young's new
"angel and queen," the songs "Stayin'
Power" and "Coastline" allow the listener
to know that Neil's latest marriage is going
quite well, but do little beyond that. The oth
er three songs — "Union Man," "Comin'

Apart at Every Nail," and "Hawks and
