# Roach's drums supreme

"The World's No. 1 Jazz Drummer!!!"
trumpet the ads. And for once they were right.
Max Roach brought a quartet to the Keystone
Korner last week to perform a fiery brand of free
improvisation that can alienate those who expect
to hear a melody played over set chord changes,
but which demonstrated beyond any doubt
Roach's supremacy on multiple percussion.
Roach first attained prominence in the earliest
days of be-bop. as the preferred drummer of
Gillespie. Parker. Powell, and the other great in
novators of the late '40s. Even then he had a
unique combination of perfect touch, good taste,
and unbelievable speed. But unlike most sur
vivors of these times. Roach did not remain satis
fied with the freedoms afforded by the bop form.
He began to write his own looser compositions
(often drawing from controversial social issues
for inspiration â€” e.g.. the 1960 Freedom Now
Suite) and to record some of the finer examples of
the "new music" (as this sort of simultaneous im
provisation based on the breakthroughs of Ornette
Coleman and John Coltrane was called). His
name is one of the first mentioned when discuss
ing creative jazz artists neglected by record com
panies. since most of his output is only available
on foreign labels.
Roach's groups have always included musi
cians at the cutting edge of new sounds and con
ceptions. and the group at the Keystone was no ex
ception. With Odean Pope on tenor, Cecil
Bridgewater on trumpet, and Calvin Hill on bass,
he had a strong band of young musicians who
seem determined to make new marks on music.
All were clearly talented, but their styles con
trasted strongly during the performance.
Roach began the show by "focusing the solo
spotlight on the drummer in one of his classic un
accompanied jazz solos." The piece super
imposed a variety of rhythmic lines and tonal var
iations over a steady 4/5 beat played on the bass
drum and high hat. He milked the drums (a stan
dard trap set without special percussion or elec
tronic gadgets) for a vast range of sounds and tex
tures. The sonorous melodies and deep harmonies
that he told the audience to listen for were, in fact,
highly evident. Roach's ability to use percussion
as a melody-making instrument as well as a

rhythm instrument entices listeners to attend to
the often-ignored drummer as a creative musi
cian rather than as a time keeper.
The first song with the quartet showed it to be a
completely responsive group with each player re
acting to the simultaneous improvisations of the
others. Roach and Hill kept it swinging in spite of
the absence of most conventional structure. Un
fortunately. the horn solos were only intermit
tently interesting here, but they soon improved.
Pope played with a thorough historical per
spective. incorporating fragments of saxophone
playing from Coleman Hawkins to John Coltrane
in a modern, expressionistic melange. He often
used "outside" notes, and his solos, solidly rooted
in the blues, formed passionate, dramatically
constructed statements. Bridgewater's solos also
had a dramatic flair to them, but his playing was
predominantly cool. He used long silences, dif
ferently textured notes, and slight volume
changes as his musical material. When he cut
loose into lightning-fast, high volume runs, the
contrast was highly effective. He is a particularly
thoughtful musician.
Calvin Hill's solos were by far the weirdest of
the performance, partly because of the ugly
grimace he has when concentrating. At times
showing good tone and speed, his solos consisted
of repeated phrases that were reversed, com
bined. and distorted into new constructions.
Sometimes he seemed to end a phrase too soon or
play slightly off key. presumably to defy the lis
tener's expectations. Although interesting, the
solos were not as compelling as those of the horns.
The high point of the night was Bridgewater's
fascinating composition, Scot Free, which made
up the entire second set. It alternated unaccom
panied solos with furious ensemble playing led by
Roach's polvrhvthmic pulse. The last solo was by
Roach himself, using the high-hat alone. It was
the single most incredible percussion solo I have
ever heard, because he combined technical mas
tery with a powerful imagination to overcome the
most stringent limits on tonal variety that he
could set himself. The skeptical reader will not
believe that Roach got more music out of one
high-hat than most drummers get out of oversized
percussion sets; such claims are stock hyperbole
in music reviews. But this claim, like the one in
the ad. is true.
