# 'Stir Crazy' drags Pryor and Wilder down to its level
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
In Silver Streak, two magnif
icent comic actors. Richard
Pryor and Gene Wilder, were
matched up They werecertain
lv the weirdest Mutt and Jeff in
recent comedies — tall, saucer
eyed Pryor and curlv-haired
Wilder, with his crazy, private
smile — and one couldn't im
agine how their vastly different
styles of comedy would mesh,
but they did. Si her Streak was a
bad movie, but these two nearly
saved it.and one of their scenes
together was very special:
Prvor's attempt to show Wilder
how to walk like a black man

script is blamed on Bruce Jay
Freidman — though I had dif

about an actor (Pryor) and a
playwright (Wilder), both flops
and refugees from interim jobs
they despise, who leave New
York and drive west to seek new
lives. They end up in a small
town somen here — most of the
supporting actors have no dis

as a pair of bank robbers and
