# Jim Carroll: Catholic boy on drugs
## 
### Michelle Carter Jay Martel 
Last Friday night, two capacity au
diences packed the Old Waldorf to see
Jim Carroll And they did. indeed, see
him They saw him and went home to
play his album and remember what the
guv sounded like
The late show opened with Chrome
Dinette, a punchy three-man band in
high-top tennis shoes that represented
something of a cross between the Police
and the Gang of Four In slick grassroots
reggae, they sang of the working man
("Gotta Get My Rent Check in on
Time" ). his need for rebellion ("I Wanna
Be Weird") and a search for fulfillment
that so often leads into the past, as in the
love ballad "Lolita":
When I teas young and went to school
Every body looked like you.
\oiv I work at the phone company
Everybody looks like me.
Dinette's lyrics were highlighted with
a great performance by the bass player,
a stingy, statuesque blonde with neck
veins that bulged at all the right mo
ments Overall, the group was lively.

polished, and occasionally even lyrical
W'hat set up the biggest contrast be
tween this band and the headliners was
that Chrome Dinette was assuredly
awake
A group called The Verbs were to be up
next, but in a modern lingual biopsy of
frighteninglv anti-literate dimensions,
all Verbs were removed from the next
set. The Jim Carroll Band onto the stage
and the audience applauding.
The reason for The Verbs's transi
tiveness became quickly clear: it was
far past Jim Carroll's bedtime. The
group opened with "Nothing is True.
Everything is Permitted," which clearly
became the theme of the evening.
Part of the problem was Carroll's in
ability to stand up for very long. This
might not have been such a problem had
Carroll's album, Catholic Hoy, not been
such a festival of exuberence . leading
those of us who had never seen him in
person to expect a real performer in the
hop-all-around, slide-across-the-stage
on-vour-knees genre.
At first. Carroll's difficulty breathing

and remaining vertical seemed to be
part of the act. He is. after all. a bonafide
member of the David Byrne/Bowie
school of rock 'n' roll malnutrition, and
his raspy voice brings to mind Lou Reed,
bums with bronchitis, and other less than
healthy concepts. But no. the Catholic
Bov was genuinely not well.
Yet Jim wasn't the only near-co
matose performer onstage. Guitarist
Brian Linslev teetered precariously on
his Beatle-boots. and brother Steve on
bass used the breaks between numbers to
snort a wet sweater.
All this is not to say that the band
didn't perform. If they had lasted longer
than seven songs we might have left the
place quite happy. During their version
of "City Drops Into the Night."sans sax
ophone. Jim managed to plug into what
ever brain cells were still operative and
deliver a performance of chilling intensi
ty-
"Catholic Boy" was as grindingly
whimsical as always, and "Three Sis
ters" was even hard-driving, despite
Linslev's inability to tune his guitar. The

group also played "Barricade." a new
song that warned. ". . . ain't gonna be no
dancing, won't be no getting laid/Gonna
send your ass to the holy land, dropped
behind a barricade." Despite this. Car
roll managed to pull it off with power.
It was downhill from there, however;
the Champ was beginning to weave and it
was getting harder for him to get up off
his knees after guitar leads.
"People Who Died" marked a predic
table close to the Jim Carroll half-hour,
with high-school groupies boogying wild
ly in the front row. The band barked out
an unmemorable encore of "Sweet
Jane." pleaded fatigue, and fled the
stage.
Stumbling toward the exits, people
must have been reminding themselves
that what they had just seen was a poet,
after all. and a good one — not a per
former. but a Catholic boy who took too
many drugs and will soon fly home to his
New York City streets and those nice
smiling parents on the front of his album
cover.

Last Friday night, two capacity au
diences packed the Old Waldorf to see
Jim Carroll And they did. indeed, see
him They saw him and went home to
play his album and remember what the
guv sounded like
The late show opened with Chrome
Dinette, a punchy three-man band in
high-top tennis shoes that represented
something of a cross between the Police
and the Gang of Four In slick grassroots
reggae, they sang of the working man
("Gotta Get My Rent Check in on
Time" ). his need for rebellion ("I Wanna
Be Weird") and a search for fulfillment
that so often leads into the past, as in the
love ballad "Lolita":
When I teas young and went to school
Every body looked like you.
\oiv I work at the phone company
Everybody looks like me.
Dinette's lyrics were highlighted with
a great performance by the bass player,
a stingy, statuesque blonde with neck
veins that bulged at all the right mo
ments Overall, the group was lively.

polished, and occasionally even lyrical
W'hat set up the biggest contrast be
tween this band and the headliners was
that Chrome Dinette was assuredly
awake
A group called The Verbs were to be up
next, but in a modern lingual biopsy of
frighteninglv anti-literate dimensions,
all Verbs were removed from the next
set. The Jim Carroll Band onto the stage
and the audience applauding.
The reason for The Verbs's transi
tiveness became quickly clear: it was
far past Jim Carroll's bedtime. The
group opened with "Nothing is True.
Everything is Permitted," which clearly
became the theme of the evening.
Part of the problem was Carroll's in
ability to stand up for very long. This
might not have been such a problem had
Carroll's album, Catholic Hoy, not been
such a festival of exuberence . leading
those of us who had never seen him in
person to expect a real performer in the
hop-all-around, slide-across-the-stage
on-vour-knees genre.
At first. Carroll's difficulty breathing

and remaining vertical seemed to be
part of the act. He is. after all. a bonafide
member of the David Byrne/Bowie
school of rock 'n' roll malnutrition, and
his raspy voice brings to mind Lou Reed,
bums with bronchitis, and other less than
healthy concepts. But no. the Catholic
Bov was genuinely not well.
Yet Jim wasn't the only near-co
matose performer onstage. Guitarist
Brian Linslev teetered precariously on
his Beatle-boots. and brother Steve on
bass used the breaks between numbers to
snort a wet sweater.
