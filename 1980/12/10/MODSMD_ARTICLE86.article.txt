SENIOR SURVEY
CLASS OF 1979-80

Office of the Vice-Provost and

Dean of Undergraduate Studies
The Senior Survey is an annual at
tempt by the Office of the Vice-Provost
and Dean of Undergraduate Studies to
ascertain the retrospective views of
seniors concerning the various aspects
of their undergraduate experience The
survey has four parts
The first pertains to assessments by
seniors of the undergraduate program,
their competence in broad areas, and
their general experiences with the
faculty and administration The results
of this portion of the survey constitute
the subject matter of the present report
The second part of the survey,
prepared and compiled at the Academic
Information Center, reviews students'
academic graduate school plans This is
intended to provide undergraduates and
their advisors with information about the
success of Stanford students in gaining
admission to particular programs The
results are available for reference at the
Academic Information Center
The third part of the survey elicits
students' views concerning particularly
outstanding or poor departmental and
faculty performances These results are
not made public but are confidentially
conveyed to department chairmen and
senior academic officers of the
University Department chairmen are
encouraged to share this information
with their faculty at their own discretion
but not to incorporate it in departmental
faculty folders or otherwise keep it on
file
The fourth part of the survey consists
of the views of the respondents on what
constitutes an educated person and
how they assess themselves in this
regard.
The 1980 survey questionnaire was
answered by 709 graduating students,
some 43 percent of the graduating
class While by no means a truly random
sample, the set of responding students
was representative of the class as a
whole in many dimensions (percentage
female, 43 percent in the sample and 41
percent overall; transfers, 15 percent
for both sample and population: majors;
and so on), and the survey results
therefore may be presumed to provide a
meaningful picture of the views of the
entire class
As shown in the two data summary
tables, the ratings are subsumed under
three broad categories
Table 1, Part A deals with general
aspects of the undergraduate program,
Part B with student interaction with
faculty and staff Table 2 presents self
ratings by students of their abilities in a
wide variety of areas that cover the
entire scope of our general education
program Items 3 through 11 in this list
query the specific areas which now
encompass the new distribution
requirements, including the Western
culture requirement
Actually, earlier versions of these
area designations in previous senior
surveys provided the basis of what
became the current distribution area
categories The inclusion of these
formally identified areas in this and
future surveys will enable us to monitor
the effect of these requirements over
time
The assessments of the un
dergraduate program and personnel
were made from three perspectives
absolute evaluations of items,
evaluations relative to students' ex
pectations concerning the items, and
evaluations of the importance of the
items to each student
Hence, for example, each student
indicated an absolute evaluation of the
faculty as teachers, an evaluation of the
faculty as teachers relative to the
students' expectations for the faculty as
teachers, and an evaluation of the
importance of faculty teaching quality

The assessments of student abilities
likewise included three perspectives
absolute evaluations, evaluations of the
"degree of improvement" since the
student entered Stanford, and the
importance of the ability to the student
The summary results given here
present, first, some highlight of student
evaluations of the undergraduate
program and its faculty and staff,
second, the more important results with
respect to students' assessments of
their abilities third, some analyses of
differences between'men and women
and among students and different
schools in the University fourth,
longitudinal results covering responses
from all of the senior surveys taken
since 1977 and fifth, a brief section on
students plans for the year immediately
following graduation For space con
siderations the data tables for the latter
three sections are not reproduced here,
but they are available for those who are
interested in this information
Evaluations of the Undergraduate
Program (Table 1)
The overall quality of undergraduate
education was rated as good' or ex
cellent' by 92 percent of the respon
dents The corresponding figure for the
adequacy of Stanford's "general or
liberal education' was 65 percent, an
indication that a sizeable proportion of
students felt that the quality of their
liberal education was a good deal lower
than the quality of the undergraduate
program in general
The adequacy of training for
graduate or professional schools was
rated highly (that is, as good' or 'ex
cellent') by 67 percent of the respon
dents. These items taken together
suggest that students were quite
positive about the academic aspects of
the undergraduate program (see Table
1, Part A)
In addition, students' living en
vironments were seen as contributing
positively to their academic develop
ment, both at the home campus and,
even more, at the overseas campuses:
56 percent said that their campus living
arrangement contributed highly to their
intellectual life, and fully 88 percent of
the students who attended an overseas
campus felt that their academic ex
periences there were good or excellent
It is noteworthy that 72 percent of these
students felt that the overseas ex
perience was better or much better than
they had expected The overall picture
is, thus, highly positive
This image i% somewhat clouded,
however, when we turn to assessments
of the faculty and staff (Table 1, Part B)
Faculty were clearly viewed as high
quality scholars and researchers, with
95 percent of the respondents at the
high end of the scale for this item
But faculty teaching was rated much
lower (56 percent of the responses were
'good' or 'excellent' while 11 percent
were 'poor' or 'very poor'), and this was
especially true with respect to students'
expectations 44 percent of students felt
the faculty as teachers were worse' or
'much worse' than expected
Teaching assistants were also
evaluated much less highly than the
undergraduate program as a whole We
are left with a rather interesting
situation students seem to rate the
undergraduate program as of con
siderably higher quality than the in
structors who conduct it.
Assessments of the faculty were
ambivalent in other dimensions as well
The opportunities for individual work
with faculty were considered very great,
and much better than expected, by most
students But, as advisors, the faculty
was disappointing to the students,
especially for freshmen and
sophomores who had not yet declared a
maior: 46 percent of respondents said
that their first advisors were poor' or
'very poor,' and 58 percent said that
these advisors were worse' or much
worse' than they had expected
Opinions were considerably more
positive for the major advisors, the
difference here must be understood in

the context of the different tasks ex
pected of these two sets of advisors.
Turning briefly to the importance of
these aspects of students' academic
experiences, we see generally that
items were considered of at least
moderate importance by nearly all
students, ano most students considered
most items of great' or very great'
importance
The items concerning the un
dergraduate program considered of
greatest importance were the overall
quality of undergraduate education, the
general quality of courses in the major,
and the overseas campus ex
periences—all items that were rated
highly by the students on the absolute
scale.
With respect to the faculty and staff,
the most important item (95 percent
responding that it was of I, great' or very
great' importance) was the quality of the
faculty as teachers, while the quality of
the faculty as researchers was of far
less importance It is worth pointing out
that the quality of teaching assistants
was of only average importance, so that
the lack of student enthusiasm for
teaching assistant capabilities was of
less importlance than student disap
pointment with faculty teaching abilities.
Finally, all of the items concerning
the faculty and staff, with the exception
of faculty teaching quality, were con
sidered of much less importance than
the items concerning the undergraduate
program as a whole
Thus, to round out the picture
portrayed above, one can say that the
undergraduate program as a whole was
perceived more positively, and as
having greater significance, than were
the quality of the instructors and the
importance to the students of the in
structor quality It is as if the students
were saying, "I got a very good
education at Stanford, and it means a lot
to me Not all of the professors were
outstanding teachers or even good
advisors, but these shortcomings did not
affect my educational experience that
much."
Assessments of Abilities (Table 2)
Graduating seniors had moderate to
high opinions of their skills and abilities
over the whole range of areas named on
the questionnaire. Only a handful of
items received responses of 'poor' or
very poor' from more than 20 percent of
the respondents, similarly, for most
items, only 10 percent to 15 percent of
respondents were sufficiently bold to
characterize their skills as excellent'
The most striking assessment
concerned the ability to "write clear
English prose," where a total of 81
percent said that they had good' or
excellent' skills. Somewhat over half of
the students gave high ratings for their
understanding of the natural sciences
and for their ability to make judgments
about international problems facing the
country," and 61 percent said that they
had high ability to "understand social
processes and institutions "
Similarly high responses were
received with respect to the final three
items in this section concerning the
ability to understand the significance of
gender, ethnicity, and social class in
U S society (69 percent, 59 percent,
and 68 percent, respectively,
responding with the top two categories
for these items). Interestingly enough, it
was precisely those areas in which
students assessed their abilities most
positively that were also considered of
greatest importance, with the ability to
write well in English again topping the
list.
The converse finding was also true
those areas deemed of least importance
were also those for which the
respondents assessed their abilities as
weakest Thus, only 38 percent of the
students felt that they had good' or
excellent' ability to use computers, and
only 40 percent felt this item to be of
great importance The corresponding
figures for the ability to use a foreign
language effectively were 43 percent for
both aspects

Other areas for which the ability was
considered of less importance included
understanding mathematical sciences,
understanding a non-Western culture,
and understanding the development of
Western culture (43 percent, 36 per
cent, and 43 percent, respectively, at
the high end of the scale for these
items).
With the exception of the
mathematical sciences item, students
also perceived their abilities as relatively
'poor' in these items. The items relating
to Western and non-Western cultures as
general subjects of study reflected the
lower ratings mentioned earlier for the
adequacy of the liberal education
program at Stanford —in particular,
students felt less competent with
respect to areas of study that focus on
the world outside the U.S., and they
thought that these areas were of less
importance than other areas.
Most of the responses concerning
the degree of improvement of student
abilities at Stanford centered around the
moderate' and great' responses, with a
rather normal distribution across the
other response categories There was a
fairly close correspondence between
the absolute evaluations of abilities, the
importance of the items, and the degree
of improvement at Stanford
Thus, for example, three of the ability
items receiving the most positive ab
solute ratings —understanding the
natural sciences, understanding social
processes and institutions, and making
judgments about international
problems—also stood high in the
assessments of degree of improvement

One exception here was the ability to
make use of computers. While only 38
percent of respondents said they had
good or excellent' computer skills, 49
percent felt that they had improved
greatly' or very greatly' at Stanford At
the same time. 19 percent of respon
dents said that they had improved in this
ability only 'very slightly,' which is
among the highest responses for this
category Another exception was the
ability to write English well, for which
relatively few students indicated much
improvement at Stanford
Items for which the degree of im
provement was least included the ability
to use a foreign language (44 percent
'slight' or very slight' improvement); the
abilities to understand mathematical
sciences (40 percent) and technology
and applied sciences (40 percent); and
the abilities to understand a non-
Western culture (36 percent) and the
development of Western culture (36
percent)
These findings provide further
evidence of the necessity of the recent
revisions of the distribution
requirements and the institution of the
Western Culture requirement Except
for foreign language ability, all of the
areas listed here are specifically ad
dressed by the new requirements The
results for these items in future senior
surveys will constitute a baseline for
assessing the progress made by
students covered by the revised
requirements.
Differences By Area of Study and Sex
Among the analyses of the
responses from various subsets of the

respondent population, two dimensions
of special interest are those of the area
of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex.
In the first case, the response allows us
to assess the various schools as they
were perceived by those majoring in
departments within them; in the second
case we learn more about the students
themselves through comparisons of the
responses made by women with those
made by men
A. Differences among schools
We have grouped the majors into five
schools' engineering, humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences, and
interdepartmental programs. A sixth
school, earth sciences, was also in
cluded in the analyses, but the number
of students in this school was so small
that they represent a rather special
case
Students majoring in humanities
departments gave the highest overall
evaluations for various aspects of their
coursework and experience in their
major departments, nearly all of them
(85 percent) rating the courses in their
major as good' or excellent' and most
(69 percent) rating the faculty highly as
teachers
They also rated their major advisors
highly (50 percent of the responses at
the top two points).
Natural science majors gave the
lowest overall ratings, with their major
courses receiving high ratings from 59
percent of these students while the
faculty as teachers were rated highly by
43 percent and major advisors by 38
percent.
