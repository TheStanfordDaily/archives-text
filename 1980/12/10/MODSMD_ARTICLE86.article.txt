SENIOR SURVEY
CLASS OF 1979-80

Office of the Vice-Provost and

Dean of Undergraduate Studies
The Senior Survey is an annual at
tempt by the Office of the Vice-Provost
and Dean of Undergraduate Studies to
ascertain the retrospective views of
seniors concerning the various aspects
of their undergraduate experience The
survey has four parts
The first pertains to assessments by
seniors of the undergraduate program,
their competence in broad areas, and
their general experiences with the
faculty and administration The results
of this portion of the survey constitute
the subject matter of the present report
The second part of the survey,
prepared and compiled at the Academic
Information Center, reviews students'
academic graduate school plans This is
intended to provide undergraduates and
their advisors with information about the
success of Stanford students in gaining
admission to particular programs The
results are available for reference at the
Academic Information Center
The third part of the survey elicits
students' views concerning particularly
outstanding or poor departmental and
faculty performances These results are
not made public but are confidentially
conveyed to department chairmen and
senior academic officers of the
University Department chairmen are
encouraged to share this information
with their faculty at their own discretion
but not to incorporate it in departmental
faculty folders or otherwise keep it on
file
The fourth part of the survey consists
of the views of the respondents on what
constitutes an educated person and
how they assess themselves in this
regard.
The 1980 survey questionnaire was
answered by 709 graduating students,
some 43 percent of the graduating
class While by no means a truly random
sample, the set of responding students
was representative of the class as a
whole in many dimensions (percentage
female, 43 percent in the sample and 41
percent overall; transfers, 15 percent
for both sample and population: majors;
and so on), and the survey results
therefore may be presumed to provide a
meaningful picture of the views of the
entire class
As shown in the two data summary
tables, the ratings are subsumed under
three broad categories
Table 1, Part A deals with general
aspects of the undergraduate program,
Part B with student interaction with
faculty and staff Table 2 presents self
ratings by students of their abilities in a
wide variety of areas that cover the
entire scope of our general education
program Items 3 through 11 in this list
query the specific areas which now
encompass the new distribution
requirements, including the Western
culture requirement
Actually, earlier versions of these
area designations in previous senior
surveys provided the basis of what
became the current distribution area
categories The inclusion of these
formally identified areas in this and
future surveys will enable us to monitor
the effect of these requirements over
time
The assessments of the un
dergraduate program and personnel
were made from three perspectives
absolute evaluations of items,
evaluations relative to students' ex
pectations concerning the items, and
evaluations of the importance of the
items to each student
Hence, for example, each student
indicated an absolute evaluation of the
faculty as teachers, an evaluation of the
faculty as teachers relative to the
students' expectations for the faculty as
teachers, and an evaluation of the
importance of faculty teaching quality

The assessments of student abilities
likewise included three perspectives
absolute evaluations, evaluations of the
"degree of improvement" since the
student entered Stanford, and the
importance of the ability to the student
The summary results given here
present, first, some highlight of student
evaluations of the undergraduate
program and its faculty and staff,
second, the more important results with
respect to students' assessments of
their abilities third, some analyses of
differences between'men and women
and among students and different
schools in the University fourth,
longitudinal results covering responses
from all of the senior surveys taken
since 1977 and fifth, a brief section on
students plans for the year immediately
following graduation For space con
siderations the data tables for the latter
three sections are not reproduced here,
but they are available for those who are
interested in this information
Evaluations of the Undergraduate
Program (Table 1)
The overall quality of undergraduate
education was rated as good' or ex
cellent' by 92 percent of the respon
dents The corresponding figure for the
adequacy of Stanford's "general or
liberal education' was 65 percent, an
indication that a sizeable proportion of
students felt that the quality of their
liberal education was a good deal lower
than the quality of the undergraduate
program in general
The adequacy of training for
graduate or professional schools was
rated highly (that is, as good' or 'ex
cellent') by 67 percent of the respon
dents. These items taken together
suggest that students were quite
positive about the academic aspects of
the undergraduate program (see Table
1, Part A)
In addition, students' living en
vironments were seen as contributing
positively to their academic develop
ment, both at the home campus and,
even more, at the overseas campuses:
56 percent said that their campus living
arrangement contributed highly to their
intellectual life, and fully 88 percent of
the students who attended an overseas
campus felt that their academic ex
periences there were good or excellent
It is noteworthy that 72 percent of these
students felt that the overseas ex
perience was better or much better than
they had expected The overall picture
is, thus, highly positive
This image i% somewhat clouded,
however, when we turn to assessments
of the faculty and staff (Table 1, Part B)
Faculty were clearly viewed as high
quality scholars and researchers, with
95 percent of the respondents at the
high end of the scale for this item
But faculty teaching was rated much
lower (56 percent of the responses were
'good' or 'excellent' while 11 percent
were 'poor' or 'very poor'), and this was
especially true with respect to students'
expectations 44 percent of students felt
the faculty as teachers were worse' or
'much worse' than expected
Teaching assistants were also
evaluated much less highly than the
undergraduate program as a whole We
are left with a rather interesting
situation students seem to rate the
undergraduate program as of con
siderably higher quality than the in
structors who conduct it.
Assessments of the faculty were
ambivalent in other dimensions as well
The opportunities for individual work
with faculty were considered very great,
and much better than expected, by most
students But, as advisors, the faculty
was disappointing to the students,
especially for freshmen and
sophomores who had not yet declared a
maior: 46 percent of respondents said
that their first advisors were poor' or
'very poor,' and 58 percent said that
these advisors were worse' or much
worse' than they had expected
Opinions were considerably more
positive for the major advisors, the
difference here must be understood in

the context of the different tasks ex
pected of these two sets of advisors.
Turning briefly to the importance of
these aspects of students' academic
experiences, we see generally that
items were considered of at least
moderate importance by nearly all
students, ano most students considered
most items of great' or very great'
importance
The items concerning the un
dergraduate program considered of
greatest importance were the overall
quality of undergraduate education, the
general quality of courses in the major,
and the overseas campus ex
periencesâ€”all items that were rated
highly by the students on the absolute
scale.
With respect to the faculty and staff,
the most important item (95 percent
responding that it was of I, great' or very
great' importance) was the quality of the
faculty as teachers, while the quality of
the faculty as researchers was of far
less importance It is worth pointing out
that the quality of teaching assistants
was of only average importance, so that
the lack of student enthusiasm for
teaching assistant capabilities was of
less importlance than student disap
pointment with faculty teaching abilities.
Finally, all of the items concerning
the faculty and staff, with the exception
of faculty teaching quality, were con
sidered of much less importance than
the items concerning the undergraduate
program as a whole
Thus, to round out the picture
portrayed above, one can say that the
undergraduate program as a whole was
perceived more positively, and as
having greater significance, than were
the quality of the instructors and the
importance to the students of the in
structor quality It is as if the students
were saying, "I got a very good
education at Stanford, and it means a lot
to me Not all of the professors were
outstanding teachers or even good
advisors, but these shortcomings did not
affect my educational experience that
much."
Assessments of Abilities (Table 2)
Graduating seniors had moderate to
high opinions of their skills and abilities
over the whole range of areas named on
the questionnaire. Only a handful of
items received responses of 'poor' or
very poor' from more than 20 percent of
the respondents, similarly, for most
items, only 10 percent to 15 percent of
respondents were sufficiently bold to
characterize their skills as excellent'
The most striking assessment
concerned the ability to "write clear
English prose," where a total of 81
percent said that they had good' or
excellent' skills. Somewhat over half of
the students gave high ratings for their
understanding of the natural sciences
and for their ability to make judgments
about international problems facing the
country," and 61 percent said that they
had high ability to "understand social
processes and institutions "
Similarly high responses were
received with respect to the final three
items in this section concerning the
ability to understand the significance of
gender, ethnicity, and social class in
U S society (69 percent, 59 percent,
and 68 percent, respectively,
responding with the top two categories
for these items). Interestingly enough, it
was precisely those areas in which
students assessed their abilities most
positively that were also considered of
greatest importance, with the ability to
write well in English again topping the
list.
The converse finding was also true
those areas deemed of least importance
were also those for which the
respondents assessed their abilities as
weakest Thus, only 38 percent of the
students felt that they had good' or
excellent' ability to use computers, and
only 40 percent felt this item to be of
great importance The corresponding
figures for the ability to use a foreign
language effectively were 43 percent for
both aspects

Other areas for which the ability was
considered of less importance included
understanding mathematical sciences,
understanding a non-Western culture,
and understanding the development of
Western culture (43 percent, 36 per
cent, and 43 percent, respectively, at
the high end of the scale for these
items).
With the exception of the
mathematical sciences item, students
also perceived their abilities as relatively
'poor' in these items. The items relating
to Western and non-Western cultures as
general subjects of study reflected the
lower ratings mentioned earlier for the
adequacy of the liberal education
program at Stanford â€”in particular,
students felt less competent with
respect to areas of study that focus on
the world outside the U.S., and they
thought that these areas were of less
importance than other areas.
Most of the responses concerning
the degree of improvement of student
abilities at Stanford centered around the
moderate' and great' responses, with a
rather normal distribution across the
other response categories There was a
fairly close correspondence between
the absolute evaluations of abilities, the
importance of the items, and the degree
of improvement at Stanford
Thus, for example, three of the ability
items receiving the most positive ab
solute ratings â€”understanding the
natural sciences, understanding social
processes and institutions, and making
judgments about international
problemsâ€”also stood high in the
assessments of degree of improvement

One exception here was the ability to
make use of computers. While only 38
percent of respondents said they had
good or excellent' computer skills, 49
percent felt that they had improved
greatly' or very greatly' at Stanford At
the same time. 19 percent of respon
dents said that they had improved in this
ability only 'very slightly,' which is
among the highest responses for this
category Another exception was the
ability to write English well, for which
relatively few students indicated much
improvement at Stanford
Items for which the degree of im
provement was least included the ability
to use a foreign language (44 percent
'slight' or very slight' improvement); the
abilities to understand mathematical
sciences (40 percent) and technology
and applied sciences (40 percent); and
the abilities to understand a non-
Western culture (36 percent) and the
development of Western culture (36
percent)
These findings provide further
evidence of the necessity of the recent
revisions of the distribution
requirements and the institution of the
Western Culture requirement Except
for foreign language ability, all of the
areas listed here are specifically ad
dressed by the new requirements The
results for these items in future senior
surveys will constitute a baseline for
assessing the progress made by
students covered by the revised
requirements.
Differences By Area of Study and Sex
Among the analyses of the
responses from various subsets of the

respondent population, two dimensions
of special interest are those of the area
of study (grouped by 'schools') and sex.
In the first case, the response allows us
to assess the various schools as they
were perceived by those majoring in
departments within them; in the second
case we learn more about the students
themselves through comparisons of the
responses made by women with those
made by men
A. Differences among schools
We have grouped the majors into five
schools' engineering, humanities,
social sciences, natural sciences, and
interdepartmental programs. A sixth
school, earth sciences, was also in
cluded in the analyses, but the number
of students in this school was so small
that they represent a rather special
case
Students majoring in humanities
departments gave the highest overall
evaluations for various aspects of their
coursework and experience in their
major departments, nearly all of them
(85 percent) rating the courses in their
major as good' or excellent' and most
(69 percent) rating the faculty highly as
teachers
They also rated their major advisors
highly (50 percent of the responses at
the top two points).
Natural science majors gave the
lowest overall ratings, with their major
courses receiving high ratings from 59
percent of these students while the
faculty as teachers were rated highly by
43 percent and major advisors by 38
percent.

Engineering majors rated their
department courses and advisors
relatively highly but gave the lowest
ratings to the faculty as teachers (39
percent for the top two categories on
the scale).
Social science and in
terdepartmental majors gave more
mixed evaluations, rating their major
courses and faculty teaching quality
relatively highly but giving very low
evaluations of their major advisors.
The most positive evaluations of
teaching assitants came from
enigneering majors (53 percent,'-good'
or 'excellent' responses), while the
humanities and social science majors
gave the lowest responses (34 percent
and 32 percent, respectively).
By contrast, humanities majors gave
relatively less positive ratings for the
adequacy of their training for graduate
or professional school (59 percent for
the top two categories), while natural
science and engineering majors gave'
the highest responses (79 percent and
80 percent). Social science and in
terdepartmental majors also gave
relatively low responses on this
dimension.
The full import of this contrast is
revealed by the finding that the
humanities and social science majors
felt that they received the most
adequate liberal education (71 percent
and 79 percent, respectively, in the top
categories), while the engineering and
natural science majors felt much less
satisfied in this area (40 percent and 53
percent).
In sum, humanities majors rated
their departments highly and felt that

their liberal education was very good,
but that their training for further
education was not totally adequate,
while the engineering and natural
science majors felt that their programs
were quite good and trained them well,
but did not provide an adequate liberal
education. The social science and in
terdepartmental majors tended to fall in
between these two extremes.
With respect to perceptions of
abilities, the results provide few sur
prises. Engineering and natural science
majors gave themselves much higher
ratings than other majors for such
abilities as understanding mathematical
sciences, making use of computers,
understanding technology and applied
sciences, and the like, while humanities
majors rated themselves higher for such
abilities as understanding literature and
fine arts, understanding a non-Western
culture, and so on.
Social science majors rated their
ability to understand social processes
and institutions, understand the
workings of government, and make
judgments about international problems
more highly than did other majors. All of
these findings are in line with our ex
pectations about the various schools.
B. Sex differences
There were few significant dif
ferences between men and women with
respect to their ratings of the un
dergraduate program and the faculty
and staff. Men rated the adequacy of
their training, their academic ex
periences overseas, and the overall
quality of the undergraduate program
slightly higher than did women, as many
as 10 percent more men giving these
items a rating of excellent.
Women, on the other hand, gave
more positive evaluations for the faculty

as teachers, the quality of teaching
assistants, and the opportunities for
individual work, but for these items the
differences were even smaller.
There were virtually no sex-related
differences with regard to students'
assessments of the quality of the un
dergraduate program and faculty
relative to their expectations. However,
women rated nearly all of these items as
being of greater importance to them
than did men; 10 to 20 percent more
women gave responses of 'great' or
'very great' importance for these items,
with the biggest differences found for
the importance of the quality of the
liberal education, and the opportunities
for individual work.
Hence, women cared more about the
various aspects of their undergraduate
education, even though they rated their
education similarly to the way men did
and they felt roughly the same degree of
satisfaction relative to their ex
pectations as men did.
When we turn to abilities developed
in the undergraduate career, the sex
differences generally seem to follow
traditional stereotypes: men rated their
own abilities more highly than women
rated their own abilities in the areas of
mathematical sciences; natural
sciences; "technology and applied
sciences; using computers; un
derstanding government; and making
judgments about international problems.
The percentage of men rating thejm
selves as 'good' or 'excellent' on these
items was 12 to 25 points greater than
the corresponding figure for women.
Likewise, women rated themselves
more highly (by about 10 points) for their
abilities to use a foreign language;
understand literature and fine arts, and
understand the significance of gender in

the U.S. On other items there were no
sex-based differences.
These sex-based differences are to
some extent a reflection of the uneven
distribution of men and women among
the various majors. For instance, as
stated earlier, natural science and
engineering majors generally rated their
ability to understand mathematics
higher than did humanities majors
Since men were overrepresented in the
natural sciences and engineering, we
should expect the overall ratings to
conform to the traditional stereotypes
(men having higher math ability than
women).

The overall quality of
undergraduate education
was rated as good or
excellent by 92% of the
respondents.

However, when we control for the
area of study, sex differences usually
persist. Thus, continuing our example,
while female engineering and natural
science majors rated themselves much
more highly than did women in the
humanities for such stereotypical male
skills as understanding math, using
computers, and understanding the
sciences, they nevertheless rated
themselves less highly in these
dimensions than did males in these
majors. This pattern held up for most of
the items for which there were sex
related differences.
For both sexes, ratings of the degree
of improvement of these abilities
generally corresponded to the ratings of
abilities: where men rated their abilities
higher, they also rated their degree of
improvement higher; and likewise for
women.
The notable exception to this pattern
appeared for the last two ability items,
understanding the significance of
ethnicity and social class in the U.S.
While there were no significant dif
ferences in ability ratings between men
and women here, women felt that they
had improved much more in these areas
than men did. The main difference was
in the category of 'great' improvement
with the rating of women in this category
exceeding that of men by ten to twelve
percent.
Finally, the importance of the
abilities also generally corresponded to
the differences in assessments of the
abilities: men attached more importance
to the abilities in which they excelled.
However, all of the differences in this
regard were quite small.
The only set of items for which there
were large differences were those
dealing with the significance of gender,
ethnicity, and social class in the U.S.:
women clearly showed more concern
abut these items, with up to 32 percent
more women than men saying that
understanding these factors was of
great' or 'very great' importance to
them.
Changes Over Time
Since the Senior Survey has been in
progress for some years, it would be of
interest to know of significant changes
over time in the perceptions of suc
cessive graduating cohorts Un
fortunately, our ability to make such
comparisons is limited by changes
made in the phrasing of questions and iij
the rating scales in our efforts to im
prove the questionnaire Hereafter we
plan no further alterations of the items
used in the survey (although we may
drop some or add others)/^so that
comparisons can more readily be made
in subsequent surveys
A detailed description of
discrepancies in the successive
questionnaires would be of little interest
here. One problem we should mention in
the present questionnaire is the addition
of the 'very poor' category to the
response scale (a change that was
intended to make the scale more
symmetrical than it was when the lowest
category was poor )

This change appears to be largely
responsible for the systematically more
positive responses obtained in 1980
compared to previous years. When we
make allowances for this problem with
the rating scales, it appears that there
were almost no significant long-term
trends in the survey results: graduating
seniors evaluated their Stanford un
dergraduate experience pretty much the
same from one year to the next, with
aspects of the program getting either
much better or much worse over the
past four years.
There were only two minor ex
ceptions to this general finding which
may be worth noting.
First, there was a slight decrease
this year in students' assessments of
their ability to use a foreign language,
with a decline of several percentage
points from excellent' to 'very good.'
Second, there was a more significant
drop in students' assessments of their
ability to make use of computers. This
item, which was asked only in 1979 and
1980, showed the percentage of 'ex
cellent' responses decreasing from 15
percent to 11 percent, with a con
commitant increase at the lower end of
the scale.
Since these declines were against
the general trend of more positive
responses for the 1980 questionnaire,
the actual decline may be assumed to
be greater than the figures indicate.
However, because the question on
computer skills has been asked for only
two years, it may be too early to say
whether there is a general trend here or
a peculiar one-time decrease.
Plans after graduation
A little over half (52 percent) of the
respondents said they planned to work
full-time immediately after graduation
Somewhat fewer (39 percent) planned to
study full-time, with the remainder
planning to travel, work, and study, or
pursue other activities.
More detailed analyses showed that
women were more likely to work full
time after graduation than were men (57
percent to 47 percent), with a
correspondingly larger proportion of
men planning to study full-time.
Further, there were considerable
differences among students in the
various schools The proportion plan
ning full-time work ranged rom a high of
72 percent for engineering majors to a
low of 19 percent for natural science
majors, with the social science and
humanities majors in between (60
percent and 46 percent respectively).
A full three-quarters of the natural
science majors planned to study full
time, almost twice as large a figure as
for the next highest school (in
terdepartmental majors, 38 percent).
This finding reflects the fact that many
of the natural science majors planned to
attend medical school and were not
delaying their entry, as students do for
many other fields of graduate study
Longitudinal results concerning
students' plans show a striking trend
toward working full-time as opposed to
full-time study The percentage of
students planning to work full-time
immediately after graduation stood at 28
percent in 1975 and increased steadily
thereafter to a high of 55 percent in
1979, dropping off slightly this year to 52
percent.
It is important to note, however, that
students have not lowered their long
term educational aspirations: fully 85
percent of all 1980 graduating seniors
said that they eventually planned to
attend graduate or professional school
(or were already in a coterminal
master's program), a figure quite
comparable to those of previous years.
We plan to do more detailed research
regarding these matters in the 1981
survey
Summary
The overall assessment of Stanford
undergraduate education given by
graduating seniors in 1980 was quite
positive Students rated both the un
dergraduate program and the faculty
and staff highly, and they felt that both
their campus living situation and, even
more, their overseas study contributed
significantly to their academic ex
perience

There was less satisfaction with the
faculty as teachers and genuine
dissatisfaction with general advisors.
Teaching assistants also were given
relatively low ratings, but for almost all
other items the ratings clustered on the
positive end of the scale
These relatively positive evaluations
were generally better than or equal to
students' expectations, and students
attached considerable importance to all
of the aspects of their undergraduate
training that were covered by the
survey.
Students also rated their abilities
quite highly, with half or more of all
students saying that they had good or
excellent ability for nearly all of the
items mentioned The major
weaknesses here had to do with
students' understanding of Western
culture In general and erf non-Western
culture and foreign languages Students
also saw their abilities as having im
proved a great deal in all areas queried
and they viewed these areas as being of
moderate or great importance to them,
with the greatest "importance f)6Tng~
attached to those areas in which they
perceived their abilities most positively.
There were important differences
among schools, with humanities
students expressing the most
satisfaction with their major programs
and departments and natural science
majors expressing the least Humanities
majors also felt they got the best liberal
education, while engineers were least
satisfied in this regard On the other
hand, natural science majors felt very
well trained for further study, as did
engineering maiors, while humanities
and social science majors felt much less
adequately trained.
Assessments of abilities tended to
follow the expected lines based on
mijor area of study, with the
engineering and natural science majors
strong in quantitative and "hard
science" areas; the social science
majors strong in dimensions directly
related to their disciplines and
humanities majors strongest in
humanistic dimensions.

Somewhat fewer than
half planned to study
full-time, with the
remainder planning to
travel, work and study.

There were few sex-based dif
ferences, especially with respect to
evaluations of the undergraduate
program and of the faculty and staff.
The main differences here concerned
the importance attached to items, with
women considering most items of
greater importance Differences in
abilities conformed generally to
traditional sex-related images in
American culture. Evaluations of im
provement in ability and of the im
portance of the various abilities
generally corresponded to the
evaluations of ability, men claimed to
have improved most in areas where they
did well, and they considered these
areas to be of greater importance The
same applied for women
Finally, while there were few ob
servable trends in the senior survey
results compiled since 1977, one
significant change is the large increase
in the proportion of students planning to
work full-time immediately after
graduation. However, this change does
not imply that fewer students plan
eventually to obtain further education
The 1980 Senior Survey yielded a
great deal of information of con
siderable value to the university With
the active participation of graduating
seniors and broader institutional
discussion of the results, we hope to
make the survey an increasingly useful
tool for university self assessment and a
means of furthering the excellence of
undergraduate education at Stanford
