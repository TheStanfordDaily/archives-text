# Student-produced' Talking Stories' skillful and innovative
## 
### Leo Liu 
A delightful and moving eve
ning of dramatic poetry was
presented by the Asian Ameri
can Theatre Project last Thurs
day and Friday in Tovon lounge
Entitled Talking Stories, the
program was a remarkably in
novative and effective blend of
poetry, dance, and music
created entirely bv Stanford
jstudents. Eight men and women

performed poems and fairy
tales by Valerie Matsumoto. a
graduate student in history, and
Camille Hamilton, a senior in
English and Political Science,
who also directed the program.
A dance prelude stunningly
choreographed by Lori Kayo
Hatta evoked images of leaves
billowed by fierce night winds.
The dancers began in conven
tional modern style a la Martha

Graham to original music com
posed by Richard McAllister
and Francis Wong. Gradually,
however, pacing and body
movements inspired by
Japaneseodari (festival) dance
and other Asian dance forms su
perceded. accented by Wong's
sensitive flute and shakohachi
motifs.
A group rendition of "Jour
ney." a poem about Asian immi

gration. opened and closed the
show Other poems recited by
the whole cast included
"Pilipino Ako" (I Am Pilipino).
which suffered from lack of fa
miliarity and feeling, and "Chi
natown Images.'' highlighted by
simultaneously-projected
slides. Six other poems and tales
each featured one or two solo
readers, backed by the dramat
ic movements of the other cast

members
Matsumoto's wonderful
"Obaachan's Tears" is an hom
age to her grandmother, a pic
ture bride from Japan who
toiled in factories and fields to
make it in America
Endless days that drained
riculets of sweat
from her tough body, hut
K rung no tears from her eyes.
Only non in her wizened old

age ore her tears,
damned behind the wall
of pride
and necessity, at last spilling
out
then I feel your tears
stream dou n my face.
and I am blessed.
Mitch Mottoka's rendition of
the poem was. to me. the most
impressive part of the program.
His rich, resonant voice and un
erring diction and timing were
evident despite an excessively
brisk pace. A slower tempo
would have heightened the dra
matic impact of this and other
pieces Hope Nakamura also
gave an extremely believable
performance, infused with feel
ing and understanding, in the
similarlv-themed "Poem from
a Sansei Daughter."
Matsumoto's original
Japanese-American fairy tales
provided warm comic high
lights. The first tale, narrated
by Natolie Miyakawa. told of a
little caterpillar who magically
grows until "its eyes were big
ger than rice bowls." then de
vours the evildoers of the town
and gives 33 children rides on its
back before the spell is ex
hausted. "The History of the
First Sushi Bar" told the saga of
Masako (played by Jennie Tan),
whose fantastically successful
sushi diner "with special rates
for weddings and bar
mitzvahs" spawns "franchises,
a subsidiary T-shirt line, and of
fers for movie rights." The Sev
enth God of Good Fortune,
hilariously evoked by David

Kaku with pitter-pattering feet
and flapping fingers, implores
her to stop an impending devas
tating battle At the last minute
Masako and the villagers pre
pare 6000 obento box lunches
which seduce the armies from
the battlefield to the dinner
table.
Throughout Talking Stories,
the choreography and music
added depth and counterpoint to
the dramatic readings, while
also linking the individual
poems together. Plain costum
ing and a simple but tasteful
stage backdrop allowed the
sheer drama of voice and move
ment to come to the fore. The
rationale of Asian American
talk-stories, as the authors put
it. is that "we must have a past
before we can have a future. The
new talk-stories provide a
means to reclaim our past, so
long omitted from American
history. Through the medium of
the talk-story we can express
dreams, create folklore, and ex
amine and redefine our reali
ty"
The production of Talking
Stories represents another
Asian American Theatre
Project, like last year's Song
for a Nisei Fisherman. in en
couraging "home-grown" tal
ents. relying as it did on the
writing and composition talents
of students. If the skilled stag
ing and innovative dramatic
quality of Talking Stories is any
indication, we can look forward
to nothing but success from the
AATP.
