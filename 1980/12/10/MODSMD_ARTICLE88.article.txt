# 'Getting of Wisdom' is dreary Victoriana
## 
### Steve Vineberg 
"Flowering inside a perfectly or
dinary girl is a totally extraordinary
woman." read the ads for The (letting of
yVisdom, but there is no indication of ex
traordinariness in Laura (Susannah
Fowle). the film's teenage heroine. She
is the daughter of a postmistress
dressmaker who is sent off to be
educated at a boarding school for rich
girls, and since she quickly learns to be
as snooty and obnoxious as they are and
never overcomes her arrogance or tan
trum-throwing. presumably the title is
ironic. What is this movie about? It may
be a detailing of the social agonies of
adolescents in turn-of-the-century Aus
tralian boarding schools, but surely
some unusual vision is needed to make us
interested in such archaic material. Or it
may be polemic against the cultivation
of the aristocracy, but since almost no
one in it is believable for a second, it is
notably deficient in both power and sub
tlety.
At the beginning of movie we hear
Laura telling her younger sister that she
is going to be famous, and we make the

connection between her and Sybylla, the
girl in My Brilliant Career. Both films
were adapted by Eleanor Whitcombe
from novels (My Brilliant Career by
Miles Franklin, the (letting of Wisdom
by Henry Handel Richardson), and they
are similar in many ways. Both heroines
are outspoken and therefore shocking to
the standing members of the high society
they invade — although Laura's out
bursts are so appallingly impolitic — like
telling the principal of the school (Barry
Humphries) that the library facilities
are pathetic and the music program bor
ing (though the latter appears more than
adequate) — that we tend to side with the
repellent, scar-mouthed headmistress
(Sheila Helpman) when she pronounces
Laura rude. Sybylla, like Laura, turns
out to be unexceptional; when she speaks
of writing a book, we can't imagine what
she has to write about, and when she pro
fesses a concern for the underprivileged
among her countrymen, it is so un
grounded that we suspect that the page of
a different script was slipped in by mis
take. But at least My Brilliant Career
had Judy Davis, a vivacious auburn
haired comedienne who kept the picture

afloat. Susannah Fowle has no such gift
She speaks in a voice that sounds as
though it had been dragged through
hours of banal elocution school training,
and she indicates like mad. working the
muscles in her cheeks, and rolling her
eyes to show us that she is dissembling
Both these movies have been ac
claimed in some quarters as triumphant
portrayals of independent women, but
Eleanor Whitcombe's feminism is lack
ing in conviction: her characters take
stands for no apparent reason, and they
come off looking rather childish. The ex
cuses Sybylla gives Harry, her wealthy
paramour, for refusing to marry him
don't make sense, and Laura's obstinacy
shouldn't be confused with real inde
pendence. Whitcombe seems to reside in
the world of Victorian girls' books, in
which a woman's willfulness made her
attractive and silly at the same time , her
protagonists behave so fancifully that we
could perceive these films as a tacit put
down of Sybylla and Laura. And the situ
ations are so familiar that we aren't like
ly to respond to them in fresh ways: My
Brilliant Career is out of Little Women

and The Sound of Music, and The (let
ting of Wisdom has elements of •Jane
Eyre and David Copperfield.
The (letting of Wisdom is elegantly
costumed, but it is as dreary as the snob
bish pupils (with one exception: a
gorgeous girl with long blonde ringlets
who is like a vicious Alice in Wonder
land) and discontented teachers in
Laura's school. Donald McAlpine's pho
tography and the production design by
John Stoddart have a cautious picture
postcard prettiness that is finally stulti
fying. and Bruce Beresford's direction is
mostly a series of carefully composed
close-ups. Watching this movie is about
as interesting as attending that school
must have been. Eh/en if Australia was
truly like this 80 years ago. there is no
reason for Australians to make movies
about it — particularly movies that look
like they were directed by Mrs. Gurley,
the headmistress. Unless you'd seen
Fred Schepisi's The Chant of Jimmie
Blacksmith, you might think that the
movies Whitcombe has worked on are
the chief proponents of the much-talked
about new Australian cinema.
