# Close to campus, The Lily delivers

### Mike Wilkins 
A common complaint among
Stanford students is. "This
place is fine for studying and
shit. b..t where do I go to let my
hair down 0 San Francisco is too
far away to go. except for spe
cial occasions, and. besides,
who can afford concert tickets
these days 0 San Jose is a little
closer, sure, but my car gets all
spray painted. I get beat up and
robbed, my date is molested,
and anyway pro wrestling is
only there every other week 1
want to find somewhere that I
can go to any day Somewhere
that's close, comfortable, and
cheap "
Look no further. 0 dis
gruntled dorm dweller, for the
answer lies only minutes north,
on El Camino in Redwood City
Allow me to be the first to of
ficially invite the Stanford com
munity to The Lily, where $12
still buys an evening of enter
tainment for two. Good enter
tainment it's not just another
strip joint
There are two things that one
notices immediately that dist
inguish The Lilv from the run
of-the-mill bump and grindery
First of all. you can get in if
you're over 18. because liquor is
not served This means that
most of Stanford can go. without
fear of being carded. Knowing
that you have every legal right
to watch the show keeps the club
from having that "cheap, just
snuck in." atmosphere that
ruins so many dates.
Secondly, if you get there ear
ly (even though shows run every
other hour from noon until two
a.m.). you don't have to worry
about being bored. In the front
of the theater is a book store to
rival Palo Alto's "H & R Adult
Books." or even Redwood City's
famed "Bachelor Books."
(Jo with someone you love. On
the night this reviewer went, we
arrived 15 minutes early. We
were ushered to our seats by our
hostess, who would later turn
out to be one of the dancers, and
were treated to a film about a
woman whose boyfriend ties her
up and urinates on her. until she
bands together with some other
women who then go out and rape
men.
The crowd seemed to ap
preciate the film, but one could
detect a restlessness, a sense of
anticipation for the live show.
They did not have to wait long.
The movie was stopped
before we found out if the girl

ever makes up with her
boyfriend, and there was sud
denly a spotlight on the 6x9
stage (complete with shag
carpet > and its runway A loud,
happv. voice came out of no
where. saying "Ho you gen
tlemen like sardines 0 " The
crowd nodded its approval
"Then welcome to the Lily Club,
where we bring you the finest in
live female dancing "
I don t disagree The first
dancer, whose name escapes
me. came out and undulated to a
well-planned medley of Big
Band favorites, ending with
"Cherokee " Her act was ac
centuated by a goodly amount of
audience participation, espe
cially one young bachelor with a
rolled-up $5 in his mouth
Given scarcely enough time
to catch our breath, we were in
troduced to Tiffany, "a real
gem. gents, watch her sine."
Taller and sleeker than the first
dancer. Tiffanv sported an Eng
lish accent and little else
After Tiffany had graced the
stage, the mood abruptly
shifted Green, brooding filters
were placed over the spots, and
we were suddenly transported
back to ". . Ancient Greece.
This is our interpretation of how
women loved each other in old
Athens This is an art piece, so
please, fellas, no touching the
girls " Two women dressed in
sheets came out and made love
to each other, like in ancient
times The more things change,
the more they stay the same.
The Grecian women hushed
the audience Their per
formance was somber, and in
trospective. My date went to the
parking lot to wait for me. If
only she had stayed, for the best
was yet to come We were
treated to none other than
". . . Roxanne Roxanne from
Dal-ass Tex-ass " She was defi
nitely the star of the show She
danced for a while, then took a
volunteer from the audience,
took off his clothes and blew
him He spent himself, and the
show was over.
After the show, a lot of the
crowd went to The Copper
Shield, an all-night diner further
down El Camino. to compare
notes and to wait for the re
views. Coffee at "The Shield" is
hot and a dollar will buy two bot
tomless cups. Coffee, gas and
the show came to less than $18
for the two of us. The Lily de
livers.

There are two things that one

of-the-mill bump and grindery
First of all. you can get in if
you're over 18. because liquor is
not served This means that
most of Stanford can go. without

that you have every legal right
to watch the show keeps the club
from having that "cheap, just
snuck in." atmosphere that
ruins so many dates.

ly (even though shows run every
other hour from noon until two
a.m.). you don't have to worry
about being bored. In the front
of the theater is a book store to

(Jo with someone you love. On
the night this reviewer went, we
arrived 15 minutes early. We
were ushered to our seats by our
hostess, who would later turn
out to be one of the dancers, and
were treated to a film about a
woman whose boyfriend ties her
up and urinates on her. until she
bands together with some other
women who then go out and rape
men.
The crowd seemed to ap
preciate the film, but one could
detect a restlessness, a sense of
anticipation for the live show.
They did not have to wait long.

ever makes up with her
boyfriend, and there was sud
