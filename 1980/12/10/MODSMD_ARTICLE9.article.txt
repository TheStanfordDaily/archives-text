# Gang of Four trial tests China's legal code

### 
Tokyo WY*) — China's most important
trial since A 949 reaches the outside world in
bafflingly fitful glimpses. After two weeks,
the feeling persists that the whole story isn't
being told.
The 10 defendants, led by Jiang Qing. 67.
widow of Chairman Mao Zedong, began
their days in court Nov. 20 to answer 48
charges ranging from plotting the over
throw of the government and the Com
munist Party to plotting the assassination of
Mao himself.
The 10 were leaders from 1966 to 1969 in
Mao's Cultural Revolution, four of them
dominating politics and culture until his
death in 1976
Guilty or not. what they have to say about
these turbulent years could be historically
significant. Whether they are able to speak
freely is an open question because of the
way the trial is reported.
The proceedings in two tribunals of the
Supreme People's Court filter through the
official Xinhua news agency. Beijing radio
and diplomatic sources. The defendants are

seen briefly, like shadowy figures from a
nearly forgotten past, on evening television
Criminal law was revised with great fan
fare last year, providing for public trials,
representation of the accused by lawyers or
friends and the right to call defense wit
nesses and to present evidence.
The presence of 800 hand-picked spec
tators is said officially to fulfill the open
trial requirement. They have not divulged
what goes on Foreign reporters are barred.
The transcript is not made public
Although most of the accused are repre
sented by lawyers, what the attorneys are
doing to defend their clients has not been
disclosed. There are no reports of cross-ex
amination of prosecution witnesses, or of
witnesses or evidence presented by the de
fense.
Despite China's new laws, it may be too
much to expect such things in a trial so
charged with political dynamite. Essential
ly. the courtroom drama being revealed so
sketchily is largely political — intrigues and
struggles for power which spilled over into

violence.
They pitted Mao. his Shanghai-actress
wife arid the party's ultra-leftists against
the moderates, led by party vice chairman
Deng Xiaoping
They hesitated for several years before
bringing the Maoists to trial: no one in the
Chinese Communist Party had ever been
tried in criminal court no matter how seri
ous his political transgressions.
There was the danger, too. that Mao's
name would be dragged in the mud. Much of
the work of his last years was repudiated,
but the moderates relv on his image as
father of the People's Republic and author
of some of the bold economic initiatives un
dertaken
The solution was to try the Maoists for
criminal offenses, such as causing the death
of thousands and plotting to seize power vio
lently.
That all the defendants are likely to be
found guilty seems evident. The only ques
tion then appears to be the sentences they
receive.
