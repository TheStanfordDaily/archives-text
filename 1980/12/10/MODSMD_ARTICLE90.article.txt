# 'Everyman' worthwhile

Who would have thought that that awful, bor
ing. tedious. Every man — the 15th-century moral
it v plav we all had to read at sometime in our lives
— could be worthwhile when put on stage 0 Could

Surprise of the week The Company, which has
given us Midsummer Xifiht's Dream. Hair, and
■Jest is Christ Superstar in the last two years, did it
again The show in Memorial Church Saturday
and Sunday nights was worth every one of its 78
minutes Director Tom Engelman gave us a
strong psychological protrait of a human being
facing death Scott Leland. who convincingly (if
not a little athletically* played Everyman, might
just as well have been dying in a hospital bed as
playing out an allegory in a church chancel
It wasn't just the acting that helped pull it off
The lighting and music made the show Lighting
director Doug Scheutz (who produced Gaieties
this year) is to be complimented He kept the
players in spotlights, so instead of their being lost
in that cavern of a church, they owned the place.
And the end was nothing short of brilliant, if you'll
pardon the pun With Ping Ho as the Angel,
swathed in blue, singing. Everyman and Good
Deeds (the beautiful Elizabeth Cannon) walked
side bv side into a burst of light It could have been
hokey The shadow of the cross was high on the

wall behind the altar. But it worked.
No music was found with the original script of
lurry/nan. but the text showed there was music
there So Professor of Music William Mahrt took
the /\"\ rir elcisun and used it to add to the pressure
on Evervman Every time someone deserted him.

when Fred Bender (whose portrayal of Death was
probably the best of the evening) stood at Every
man's grave, tapping his drum every few seconds,
the pressure seemed unbearable
Special mention also must be given to some of
the minor characters, some of whom had only a
few lines but who almost stole the show. Troy
Schmidt as Fellowship was hilarious , so was Noel
Rosales as Cousin and Jackie Kanner as Worldly
Goods When she ended her refusal to join Every
man at the grave with. "And have a good day."
the audience roared. In fact, it seemed so modern.
1 thought it had been added It hadn't. I checked.
Another surprise this weekend: Memorial
Church was filled both nights, which was good
news for The Company but bad news for the au
dience. If there was any complaint about the show
it was about not being able to hear from about the
20th row back Memorial Church may be an ap
propriate place to stage a morality play, but
acoustics are not its long suit
