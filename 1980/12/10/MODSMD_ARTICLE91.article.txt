# 'Home Movies' has considerable charm

### Steve Vineberg 
When Brian De Palma's Home Movies
opened in New York early this year, it re
ceived disastrous reviews: critics were
not merely displeased at, but repelled
by. which branded "offensive" mate
rial However, the audience with whom I
watched Home Modes, packed into the
tinv Cento Cedar in San Francisco, didn't
seem to be offended: they laughed loudly
through it and applauded at the end. Au
diences are almost always on De
Palma's side: in Dressed to Kill. which
has since stirred up the vitriol in people
who have misread it as misogvnistic. no
one breathed during the long, intricate
suspense sequences — including the cat
and mouse ballet in the museum — and
everyone laughed in appreciation at the
jokes De Palma was playing on us, just
as everyone had laughed in Carrie.
It is difficult to assess exactly what in
Home Movies so upset the New York re
viewers. Was it perhaps the fact that De
Palma. now a famous, commercially
successful Hollywood director, had
chosen to return to his roots — the milieu
of the film school (Home Movies was
made in association with film students at
Sarah Lawrence College, six of whom —
Robert Harders. Gloria Novis, Kim
Ambler. Dana Edelman, Stephen Lemay
and Charles Loventhal — wrote the
script) — and to the freewheeling,
sophomoric humor of his early "under
ground" comedies, (ireetings and Hi,
Mom! < Home Movies is uneven, occa
sionally amateurish, but it has con
siderable charm that derives partly, I
think, from the level of the jokes (this
was also the case of 1941. another much

maligned movie) and partly from the
fact that it was made by a team of young
people whose sustenance is film: their
familiarity with and love of movies in
forms this picture in a very special way.
The thesis of Home Movies could only
have been thought up by film students.
Denis Bvrd (Keith Gordon) is "an extra
in his own life." ignored by everyone in
his family, and so he seeks "star thera
py" from The Maestro (Kirk Douglas),
in the form of a filmmaking course that
will teach him how to "keep himself in
focus." As a theme, the idea of life as a
movie teeters on the edge of pretentious
ness (like the metaphysical concerns in
The Stunt Man which the director.
Richard Rush, danced around with such
adroitness), but it turns out to function
mostly as a framing device for a farce
cooked up out of snatches from other pic
tures. The real theme of the movie is love
of movies. There are cameras every
where: Denis has one. The Maestro has
one. cameras spy on Kristina, Denis's
sister-in-law-to-be (Nancy Allen), even
his grandmother sits with a camera at
the bottom of the stairway, ready to
shoot Kristina as she descends on her
wedding day.
Anyone can enjoy the farce elements
of Home Movies, and the lively per
formances. but our enjoyment increases
with our recognition of the cinematic al
lusions in it. Some of the bits are take
offs on Hollywood cliches that have al
ready been roasted to perfection by
Carol Burnett — the sentimental use of
slow motion and mood music (Dino
Ponaggio wrote the slight, witty score),
the sudden appearance of a storm in the

middle of a crisis. Others are in-jokes for
an audience familiar with De Palma's
other pictures. The presence of per
formers he has used before fuels the self
parody: Kirk Douglas played the father
in The Fury: Nancy Allen, De Palma's
wife in reai life, was the bitch in Carrie;
Gerrit Graham, who plays Denis's
brother James, was the rock star Beef in
I'hantom of the I'aradise. (When James,
a vegetarian, castigates Kristina for her
eating and sexual habits, he cries "I see!
First beef and then me!") There are
joking references to The Fury and De
Palma's little-known comedy (let to
Know Your Rabbit. as well as to Citizen
Kane. Sunset Boulevard, Dead of Night,
and in honor of Douglas, Champion,
Spartacus and The Bad and the Beau
tiful. Furthermore, it is interesting to
note how Home Movies prefigures
Dressed to Kill. which followed on its
heels. In both movies. Nancy Allen plays
a prostitute. Keith Gordon a teenager
doing amateur detective work (though
by Dressed to Kill he has become much
more proficient at it), and they relate to
each other in similar ways.
Allen and Gordon are great as a comic
team in both films. She has a luscious
lewdness, and when she plays innocent,
she surpasses Jane Fonda's sex kitten
act in Bar bare lla. Gordon, on the other
hand, is truly ingenuous, and we can see
why his awkward schoolboy's charm and
his earnestness turn her on. For Gordon,
Allen is the embodiment of his most sat
isfying sex dream, but she's a kind of big
sister, too, and his resulting confusion is
terribly funny. When he kisses her. the
kiss is chaste, perfunctory, although the

intention is certainly not. and he
gestures apologetically at the same
time.
Kirk Douglas is looser than one might
have expected him to be with this sort of
material (he looked dreadfully ill at ease
as a guest host on Saturday Nitfht Lite)
'and even Vincent Gardenia, whom I usu
ally regard as the Neil Simon of actors —
loud and obnoxious — rises to the occa
sion as lecherous Dr. Byrd (a stock char
acter if there ever was one). Best of all is
Gerrit Graham, a comedian of such
amazing range that his relative inactivi
ty in movies is bewildering. As Beef in
De Palma's baroque rock horror parody,
Phantom of the Paradise, he stole a very
impressive show; in Home Movies, he is
splendid in a very different role. James
— whose golden, nearly pre-Raphaelite
curls match up with Nancy Allen's — is
teaching a course at Now College in
"Spontanetics": he imparts, with Ma
sonic secrecy, a neo-Nazi, macho purist
gospel to a quintet of freshmen in ridicu
lous uniforms who answer to the names
of Christ's disciples. Graham plays eve
ry layer of this delectable send-up — the
fascist, the repressed homosexual, the
holy teacher, the intolerable hipster who
spouts the current jargon — for all it's
worth He has crackerjack timing and an
intense, fiery-eyed reaction to every sign
of weakness he perceives in Kristina, his
fiancee. In one scene, when she returns
from an illicit trip to a hamburger joint,
he turns into a crazed bloodhound, snif
fing for telltale signs of junk food. It is
the funniest performance I have seen in
anv movie this year.
