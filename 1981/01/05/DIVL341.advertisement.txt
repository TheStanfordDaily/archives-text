School of Education I IRrt"
Stanford University Lg
"No lecture on 'What it is like to be a teacher' can begin to compare with actually getting out and
teaching. Alumni with whom I talk cannot believe that I am getting the opportunity to teach and find out
before (rather than after) graduate school whether it is right for me. I just wish that there were
comparable 'experience' programs in other fields. Then college would truly be the place where one is
prepared for the real world.'
The "experience" program this student is describing is U.P.S.E., the UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAM IN
THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION.
The School of Education at Stanford University is a graduate school. As a professional school it has
consistently been ranked by outside judges as foremost in this nation in its research and graduate training.
Now it is possible for undergraduates who are interested in questions of educational policy and practice to test
their ideas and talents in a variety of educational opportunities within neighboring institutions and local schools
while earning Stanford University credit for supervised teaching, tutoring, projects and internships.
Through U.P.S.E. students:
• taught a brain-damaged 13-year-old how to add, subtract, multiply and divide
• helped terminal patients with art therapy at Stanford Children's Hospital
• taught a 10-year-old Spanish-speaking boy to read (he had never attended a school)
• worked as teacher aides in a junior high school in a low-income neighborhood
In addition, undergraduates did sponsored research on a number of educational subjects.
