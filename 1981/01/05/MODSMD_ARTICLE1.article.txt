From the Daily wire services
Washington â€” The 97th Congress
convenes today with President-elect
Ronald Reagan's first fight on Capitol
Hill about to get under way before he
even takes office.
The action on the floor of the two
houses is expected to be largely cere
monial as Republicans formally take
control of the Senate for the first time
in 25 years.
But a battle is anticipated when the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
begins hearings Friday on Reagan's
nomination of Alexander Haig to be
secretary of state.
Haig, a former NATO commander
and four-star Army general, faces
questioning about his role as former
President Richard Nixon's chief of
staff during the Watergate crisis.
Reagan and GOP leaders in the Sen
ate have expressed confidence Haig
will be confirmed, but the panel is pre
pared for lengthy hearings.
A president's Cabinet nomination
was last rejected in 1959, when a Dem
ocrat-controlled Senate refused to
confirm Dwight Eisenhower's selec
tion of Lewis Strauss to be secretary
of commerce.
Hearings
The Senate Energy Committee also
plans to begin confirmation hearings
during the opening week on James
Watt, Reagan's choice for secretary
of the interior.
Environmentalists say they will op
pose Watt's confirmation because of
his leadership of a legal foundation

that has sought to open public lands in
the West to mineral and oil explora
tion.
Confirmation hearings for other
Cabinet nominees are scheduled dur
ing the week but are expected to be
relatively perfunctory.
Both houses convene at noon today
to swear in newly elected and re
elected members, adopt rules and for
mally elect the officers who have been
chosen in party caucuses.
Floor fight
House Republicans say they may
stage a floor fight to boost their repre
sentation on key committees to reflect
their increased strength in the House
as a whole. They are outnumbered 276
to 159, however, and it is unlikely they
would get enough Democratic votes to
win since such issues are almost
always decided along strict party
lines.
Congress will hold a joint session
tomorrow to count the votes cast by
presidential electors, formally com
pleting the election of Reagan.
Both houses then plan to recess until
Jan. 19. On Jan. 20, Reagan will take
the oath of office on a platform looking
out toward the Washington Monument
from the West Front of the Capitol.
President Jimmy Carter will send
Congress a written State of the Union
message this week, instead of coming
to the Capitol to deliver it. He will also
submit his final budget, reportedly
aiming to hold the projected deficit for
fiscal year 1982 to around $32 billion.
