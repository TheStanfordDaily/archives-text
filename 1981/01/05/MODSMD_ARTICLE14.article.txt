## Draft registration alternatives 
### 
The post office is going to be
very busy this week Besides its
regular function of moving the
mail, it has taken on a new task:
registering young men for the
draft. People who are con
cerned about the fact that this
is happening will be standing by
the front doors, leaflets in hand
and questions on minds.
Registration for the draft is a
major personal decision, and
carries with it far-reaching po
litical and social effects. It is es
sential for all of us, especially
those eligible to register, to be
as well-informed as possible
about registration and alter
natives to it.
Contrary to the statements
heard from the government and
in the press, you do not have to
simply walk in on your desig
nated day and sign up. You don't
decide in one day which college
to attend or what kind of career
you want. This is a similarly
ponderous decision. Take your
time and think it through. You
can wait until the last day to
register and still be in complete
compliance with the law.
When filling out your card,
you can utilize some empty
space to write, "I am a cons
cientious objector", "I am reg
istering under protest", or any
other message of your choice.
While statements of protest or
obscenities will not be re
corded, they will convey your
displeasure to the individuals
handling your form. Cards with
statements of intended cons
cientious objection will be saved
in the event that classification
of registrants begins. If you
think that you might wish to re
ceive conscientious objector
(CO) status at that time, it is a
good idea to indicate this on
your form and photocopy it
before you turn it in. You may
take forms out of the post office.
A CO must have a "deeply
held moral, ethical or religious"
objection to war, killing or mili
tary action. Though you may be
unsure your beliefs right
now. the statement on your reg
istration form will help show
that you were thinking about
this at an early stage, before
either induction or classi
fication had taken place. You
can then talk to a draft counsel
or. do some serious thinking,
and continue to document your
beliefs.
Obtaining CO status is a com
plex process, and you'll need

help with it. Contact a draft
counselor or member of your
clergy, and start early! A draft
counseling center will be oper
ating this week at the Old
Clubhouse in Old Union, and the
Draft Information Service has a
24-hour-hotline at 493-4857.
Leafletters at the Post Office
will have more information.
Due to a recent court decision
in a national class action suit,
you are no longer required to
submit your Social Security
number to the Selective Service
and may request that your So
cial Security number be ex
punged from all their records.
You may choose not to reg
ister. Independent surveys esti
mate that one million young
men. 25 percent of those eligible
to register, took that option this
summer. Selective Service
made a hasty estimate of seven
percent non-registration, or
280,000 individuals. In any case,
you'll have lots of company.
If you do not register for the
draft, you may wish to keep it
very quiet, in which case you
would tell almost no one about
it. Or you may want to make a
public stand of some sort.
Some non-registrants plan to
keep it quiet up to the time they
receive notice from the Selec
tive Service that it is known
they did not register. Then some
will begin to make public
statements and attract atten
tion to the issue; others will go
underground. You can start a
discussion group in your house
or dorm in which non-regis
trants can get together to dis
cuss their feelings and plans and
provide support for one another.
You may want to speak to
small groups or in anonymous
interviews. Or you may wish to
publicly declare your non-regis
trant status through press con
ferences, letters, speak-outs at
rallies, and so on.
Obviously, each of these op
tions carries possible conse
quences. Non-registration is a
felony punishable by five years
in prison or $10,000. But with the
25.000-space Federal prison sys
tem bulging at the seams right
now, and an estimated 280,000 to
one million non-registrants al
ready in existence, any one indi
vidual's chances of ending up in
jail look significantly less
ominous. It is, however, an im
portant factor to consider in a
reaching a decision. So far, non
registrants are being allowed to

register late with no punitive
measures taken
Registration carries its con
sequences as well If a draft is
reinstated, there will be few ex
emptions. and no deferments
for college students. Once
drafted into the military, you
will live under military law,
limiting your rights of free
speech and travel, among oth
ers. for two or more years. Once
you've registered, it will be
much more difficult to evade
the draft if you wish to do so. In
addition, registration is seen by
many as a sort of public opinion
poll, gaging the amount of
potential resistance to reinstitu
tion of the draft. Thus, if regis
trants turn out in large num
bers. the possibility of a draft
becomes greater.
Conversely, if numbers are
low. the possibility that the in
coming president will cancel
the directive ordering commen
cement of registration in
creases.
Another far-reaching and
frighteningly serious conse
quence is the possibility of war.
In the history of the U.S., we've
never had registration without a
draft, and we've never had a
draft without a war. In any ap
parent national emergency,
there have always been more
than enough volunteers to satis
fy military needs. Without a
draft, the protracted and pain
ful conflict in Vietnam could not
have continued as it did. Let's
not forget that war, its mean
inglessness and divisiveness,
too soon.
Whether to register or not for
the draft is a decision to be
made by an individual. Yet it
threatens all of us with the pos
sibility of war once again. Many
aspects of a draft and its effects,
resistance, and details about
conscientious objection and the
like which have not been
touched on here should be ex
plored by eligible registrants
and all Americans who would be
affected by U.S. involvement in
renewed warfare. And who
wouldn't be? So when you see
those people out in front of the
post office, stop by for a chat.
With enough discussion, maybe
someday we'll start asking the
right questions.

or dorm in which non-regis
trants can get together to dis
cuss their feelings and plans and
provide support for one another.
You may want to speak to
small groups or in anonymous
interviews. Or you may wish to
publicly declare your non-regis
trant status through press con
ferences, letters, speak-outs at
rallies, and so on.
Obviously, each of these op
tions carries possible conse
quences. Non-registration is a
felony punishable by five years
in prison or $10,000. But with the
25.000-space Federal prison sys
tem bulging at the seams right
now, and an estimated 280,000 to
one million non-registrants al
ready in existence, any one indi
vidual's chances of ending up in
jail look significantly less
ominous. It is, however, an im
portant factor to consider in a
reaching a decision. So far, non
registrants are being allowed to

register late with no punitive
measures taken
Registration carries its con
sequences as well If a draft is
reinstated, there will be few ex
emptions. and no deferments
for college students. Once
drafted into the military, you
will live under military law,
limiting your rights of free
speech and travel, among oth
ers. for two or more years. Once
you've registered, it will be
much more difficult to evade
the draft if you wish to do so. In
addition, registration is seen by
many as a sort of public opinion
poll, gaging the amount of
potential resistance to reinstitu
tion of the draft. Thus, if regis
trants turn out in large num
bers. the possibility of a draft
becomes greater.
Conversely, if numbers are
low. the possibility that the in
coming president will cancel
the directive ordering commen
cement of registration in
creases.
Another far-reaching and
frighteningly serious conse
quence is the possibility of war.
In the history of the U.S., we've
never had registration without a
draft, and we've never had a
draft without a war. In any ap
parent national emergency,
there have always been more
than enough volunteers to satis
fy military needs. Without a
draft, the protracted and pain
ful conflict in Vietnam could not
have continued as it did. Let's
not forget that war, its mean
inglessness and divisiveness,
too soon.
Whether to register or not for
the draft is a decision to be
made by an individual. Yet it
threatens all of us with the pos
sibility of war once again. Many
aspects of a draft and its effects,
resistance, and details about
conscientious objection and the
like which have not been
touched on here should be ex
plored by eligible registrants
and all Americans who would be
affected by U.S. involvement in
renewed warfare. And who
wouldn't be? So when you see
those people out in front of the
post office, stop by for a chat.
With enough discussion, maybe
someday we'll start asking the
right questions.

The post office is going to be
very busy this week Besides its
regular function of moving the
mail, it has taken on a new task:
registering young men for the
draft. People who are con
cerned about the fact that this
is happening will be standing by
the front doors, leaflets in hand
and questions on minds.
Registration for the draft is a
major personal decision, and
carries with it far-reaching po
litical and social effects. It is es
sential for all of us, especially
those eligible to register, to be
as well-informed as possible
about registration and alter
natives to it.
Contrary to the statements
heard from the government and
in the press, you do not have to
simply walk in on your desig
nated day and sign up. You don't
decide in one day which college
to attend or what kind of career
you want. This is a similarly
ponderous decision. Take your
time and think it through. You
can wait until the last day to
register and still be in complete
compliance with the law.
When filling out your card,
you can utilize some empty
space to write, "I am a cons
cientious objector", "I am reg
istering under protest", or any
other message of your choice.
While statements of protest or
obscenities will not be re
corded, they will convey your
displeasure to the individuals
handling your form. Cards with
statements of intended cons
cientious objection will be saved
in the event that classification
of registrants begins. If you
think that you might wish to re
ceive conscientious objector
(CO) status at that time, it is a
good idea to indicate this on
your form and photocopy it
before you turn it in. You may
take forms out of the post office.
A CO must have a "deeply
held moral, ethical or religious"
objection to war, killing or mili
tary action. Though you may be
unsure your beliefs right
now. the statement on your reg
istration form will help show
that you were thinking about
this at an early stage, before
either induction or classi
fication had taken place. You
can then talk to a draft counsel
or. do some serious thinking,
and continue to document your
beliefs.
Obtaining CO status is a com
plex process, and you'll need

help with it. Contact a draft
counselor or member of your
clergy, and start early! A draft
counseling center will be oper
ating this week at the Old
Clubhouse in Old Union, and the
Draft Information Service has a
24-hour-hotline at 493-4857.
Leafletters at the Post Office
will have more information.
Due to a recent court decision
in a national class action suit,
you are no longer required to
submit your Social Security
number to the Selective Service
and may request that your So
cial Security number be ex
punged from all their records.
You may choose not to reg
ister. Independent surveys esti
mate that one million young
men. 25 percent of those eligible
to register, took that option this
summer. Selective Service
made a hasty estimate of seven
percent non-registration, or
280,000 individuals. In any case,
you'll have lots of company.
If you do not register for the
draft, you may wish to keep it
very quiet, in which case you
would tell almost no one about
it. Or you may want to make a
public stand of some sort.
Some non-registrants plan to
keep it quiet up to the time they
receive notice from the Selec
tive Service that it is known
they did not register. Then some
will begin to make public
statements and attract atten
tion to the issue; others will go
underground. You can start a
