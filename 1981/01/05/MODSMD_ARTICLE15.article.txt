## Reforms needed to fight violence 
### 
Consider for a moment the
following typical week in the na
tional news of the U.S. John
Lennon is maliciously gunned
down on his doorstep in New
York. On the opposite coast, po
lice continue to search for the
Mount Tamalpais murderer,
who has recently bagged his
seventh victim. Meanwhile, two
University of California at
Davis college students disap
pear and are found mangled in a
field several days later. A five
year old in Oakland is kidnapped
on his way to school, to be dis
covered in a shallow grave sev
eral months later.
Having throughly digested
this media scenario of criminal
violence, I find myself at work,
reading the X-rays of a recently
hospitalized elderly Menlo Park
couple. Their humble home was
broken into, they were tied and
severly beaten, and nothing of

value was taken.
The preceding paragraphs
outline a persistent and growing
problem in American society:
the tragedy of criminal vio
lence. Every day in our country,
innocent men, women, and chil
dren are victimized by sense
less and unjustifiable acts.
Those who commit such crimes
are generally caught in time by
appropriate authorities, but this
is where our current system of
justice begins to fail.
As a civilized society, we
have come to adopt a policy
which views the convicted crim
inal as an individual with the
potential for reform. As a re
sult, many of these people serve
curtailed prison sentences and
ae back on the street several
years after their crimes. Sever
al studies have shown that a
high percentage of these indi
viduals return to a life of crime

following their release.
In recent years, there has
been increasing emphasis on the
importance of prison reform by
a number of concerned citizen
groups. One Justice Depart
ment official recently warned
that unless drastic steps toward
improvement in the conditions
of American prisons are taken
soon, increasing numbers of
prison riots and breaks can be
expected in the future.
Our justice system also has
an inherent stumbling block:
the insanity plea. In essence, the
present legal system equates in
sanity with innocence. What we
fail to realize is that every hu
man being who commits an act
of criminal violence such as
those described above is not in
full possession of his faculties.
We have no second thoughts
about locking up a "guilty"
criminal, but are more merciful
with the "insane" individual. In
reality, the two are usually one
and the same, and neither has
any right to freedom and the
potential for an encore.
The answer to the rising in
cidence of criminal violence in
America lies not in such meas
ures as gun control, but rather
via a drastic change in our cur
rent policy toward the criminal.
Long and expensive trials are
not necessary in situations
where the guilty party is clearly
identified by the circumstances.
Additionally we need to view the
violent criminal as a person
with no potential for reform. It
should be ingrained in our na
tional mentality that a citizen
gets only one chance to play by
the rules.

Convicted violent criminals
should be subject to just pun
ishment. This should not be
taken as a plea for reinstitution
of the death penalty, for our un
derstanding of death is vague
and uncertain. However, as hu
man beings we have a clear con
ception of pain and suffering in
life, and these entities should
not be denied to our worst
citizens. Prisons should be un
pleasant places to spend time,
not resorts with barred windows
where insane killers play cards
and eat square meals courtesy
of the American taxpayer,
whose parents, children, or
spouse may have been their in
nocent victims.
It should be made known that
if and when our nation ever finds
itself involved in another
ground war. those with de
omonstrated violent tendencies
should be the first to go. War is
the closest thing to hell that we
have on earth, and violent crim
inals are deserving of every hor
rible aspect thereof.
These opinions are obviously
subject to harsh criticism by
proponents of social reform and
those who believe in the in
herent goodness of mankind. I
too am a believer in Christianity
and mercy and kindness toward
fellow men. but find it im
possible to sympathize with
those who inflict tragedy upon
the lives of innocent citizens.
Such individuals are indeed
sick, but until we have the
means to control human behav
ior. we are obligated to protect
ourselves and our loved ones.

Consider for a moment the
following typical week in the na
tional news of the U.S. John
Lennon is maliciously gunned
down on his doorstep in New
York. On the opposite coast, po
lice continue to search for the
Mount Tamalpais murderer,
who has recently bagged his
seventh victim. Meanwhile, two
University of California at
Davis college students disap
pear and are found mangled in a
field several days later. A five
year old in Oakland is kidnapped
on his way to school, to be dis
covered in a shallow grave sev
eral months later.
Having throughly digested
this media scenario of criminal
violence, I find myself at work,
reading the X-rays of a recently
hospitalized elderly Menlo Park
couple. Their humble home was
broken into, they were tied and
severly beaten, and nothing of

value was taken.
The preceding paragraphs
outline a persistent and growing
problem in American society:
the tragedy of criminal vio
lence. Every day in our country,
innocent men, women, and chil
dren are victimized by sense
less and unjustifiable acts.
Those who commit such crimes
are generally caught in time by
appropriate authorities, but this
is where our current system of
justice begins to fail.
As a civilized society, we
have come to adopt a policy
which views the convicted crim
inal as an individual with the
potential for reform. As a re
sult, many of these people serve
curtailed prison sentences and
ae back on the street several
years after their crimes. Sever
al studies have shown that a
high percentage of these indi
viduals return to a life of crime

following their release.
In recent years, there has
been increasing emphasis on the
importance of prison reform by
a number of concerned citizen
groups. One Justice Depart
ment official recently warned
that unless drastic steps toward
improvement in the conditions
of American prisons are taken
soon, increasing numbers of
prison riots and breaks can be
expected in the future.
Our justice system also has
an inherent stumbling block:
the insanity plea. In essence, the
present legal system equates in
sanity with innocence. What we
fail to realize is that every hu
man being who commits an act
of criminal violence such as
those described above is not in
full possession of his faculties.
We have no second thoughts
about locking up a "guilty"
criminal, but are more merciful
with the "insane" individual. In
reality, the two are usually one
and the same, and neither has
any right to freedom and the
potential for an encore.
The answer to the rising in
cidence of criminal violence in
America lies not in such meas
ures as gun control, but rather
via a drastic change in our cur
rent policy toward the criminal.
Long and expensive trials are
not necessary in situations
where the guilty party is clearly
identified by the circumstances.
Additionally we need to view the
violent criminal as a person
with no potential for reform. It
should be ingrained in our na
tional mentality that a citizen
gets only one chance to play by
the rules.

Convicted violent criminals
should be subject to just pun
ishment. This should not be
taken as a plea for reinstitution
of the death penalty, for our un
derstanding of death is vague
and uncertain. However, as hu
man beings we have a clear con
ception of pain and suffering in
life, and these entities should
not be denied to our worst
citizens. Prisons should be un
pleasant places to spend time,
not resorts with barred windows
where insane killers play cards
and eat square meals courtesy
of the American taxpayer,
whose parents, children, or
spouse may have been their in
nocent victims.
It should be made known that
if and when our nation ever finds
itself involved in another
ground war. those with de
omonstrated violent tendencies
should be the first to go. War is
the closest thing to hell that we
have on earth, and violent crim
inals are deserving of every hor
rible aspect thereof.
These opinions are obviously
subject to harsh criticism by
proponents of social reform and
those who believe in the in
herent goodness of mankind. I
too am a believer in Christianity
and mercy and kindness toward
fellow men. but find it im
possible to sympathize with
those who inflict tragedy upon
the lives of innocent citizens.
Such individuals are indeed
sick, but until we have the
means to control human behav
ior. we are obligated to protect
ourselves and our loved ones.
