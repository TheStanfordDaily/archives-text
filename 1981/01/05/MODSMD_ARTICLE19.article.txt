No polemics
Yousuf Albader (Daily, Dec.
10) suggests quite rightly that
some Palestinians living in
Arab countries may not desire
to be there. Like countless Jews
whom we know in America and
Israel, we hope Palestinians can
fulfill their national aspirations
and determine their own future.
We also hope for a Palestinian
leadership that will find a way
of doing that instead of calling
for the elimination of Israel.
In this context, it bears re
membering that millions of
Jews now in Israel would doubt
less have wanted to remain in
the Arab countries of the Middle
East and North Africa where
they and their ancestors were
born. But they could not.
To allege that the wars of
1948, 1956. and 1967 (why not in
clude 1973?) were begun by Is

rael is to fly squarely in the face
of historically documented fact.
The same holds for the
astonishingly misguided
statement that Israelis are "in
flicting worse conditions" on
Palestinians than Jews suffered
in Nazi-dominated Europe.
Finally, to say that "most Zi
onist leaders" are "racist" is no
better than calling most Arab
leaders fascists because some
of them supported Hitler.
Let us try for reasonable and
seriously critical — not
polemical — approaches to the
real problems in the Middle
East.

Grad housing
I would like to respond to Pe
ter Brett's and Theresa Lacey's
claim (Daily, December 2) that
my protest over increased
Escondido Village rents is
"merely silly." Brett and Lacey
(undergraduates "forced to live
off campus this year, thus sepa
rated from a large portion of
campus activity") are absolute
ly right that it is expensive and
inconvenient. But they are ob
viously unaware that 70 percent
of grads live off campus (often
for many years) while only 12
percent of undergrads do (for
at most one year). When
the new undergrad dorm is com
pleted, all undergrads who want
to can live on campus. But only
1/3 of grads will have spaces,
and a grad dorm won't be built
for at least ten years.
EV residents are protesting
the extra 3 and one half percent
rent hike because it is paying for
an undergrad dorm while the
need is far greater for more
graduate housing.
Escondido Village was built
as subsidy housing for grad stu
dents before it was part of the
housing system. Subsidy hous
ing was built because more
graduate students are self-sup
porting. Most undergraduates
are supported by their parents.
If rents continue to rise, many
grad students will simply not be
able to afford to go here.

Stipends (in the schools that
even provide them) do not in
crease as fast as inflation, much
less as fast as EV rents (14
percent last year, 15 percent
proposed this year.)
Many departments limit the
number of hours a grad can
work, and study loads are heavy
in grad school, so students find
it hard to supplement that
stipend.
True, Brett and Lacey, some
EV residents may have a work
ing spouse if they are married, if
they don't have small children
(and their visas permit)but they
also must pay for food, clothing,
tuition, transportation and
housing on a small income.
Again, most undergraduates get
help from their parents.
As for the "forced independ
ence of undergraduates" and
the unsettling experience of
leaving home, I can only won
der...did the authors come to
Stanford for an education or a
babysitter?
I am all for undergrads and
grads supporting housing equal
ly, but undergrads are getting
the new dorm, wide variety of
housing choices, and four years
guaranteed on campus. Grad
students get a few trailers, six
months on the wait list, less
than one third of them can live
on campus, and stipends that
are barely enough to live on. Is
that a "good deal?"
If EV residents are getting
nowhere near the same benefits
as undergrads, especially in
terms of housing available, is it
"merely silly" we protest an
other rent increase?

Double Murder
Monday Night Football. New
England: 13, Miami: 13. The
Dolphins had just tied the game
when the news broke out from
the ABC commentator that John
was shot in the back.
Humors claim that if one
plays the Beatles' "Revolution

No. 9 in reverse, one would hear
John say, "Paul's dead, Paul's
dead." The same rumor is sub
stantiated by the fact that Paul
is the only Beatle seen from be
hind on the back cover of "Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
Band" album. Further evidence
has Paul as the only Beatle
crossing the street barefooted
on Abbey Road's front cover. As
the news spreads about John's
death, I can hardly refrain from
remembering how awfully mor
tal we all are.

Sex Survey
Recently a disturbing situ
ation has come to my attention.
I have been informecj that many
female students have received
telephone calls by a group iden
tifying themselves as members
of the pledge class of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity. Explaining
that as pledges they are re
quired to make a survey, the
callers have asked the women
about specifics of their sleeping
habits.
As pledge class president of
the Delts, I would like to use the
opportunity provided by the
Daily to publicly deny any par
ticipation by any of the mem
bers of Delta Tau Delta in this
"survey." The Delts neither
support nor find amusing this
disrespect for others.
Why the persons responsible
have chosen to join in the cam
paign to discredit Delta Tau
Delta and/or the fraternity sys
tem at Stanford is unknown. But
it is clear that the callers are re
inforcing the mistaken notion
that fraternities mold their
members into sexists.
I would like to ask those who
have received these calls to ac
cept my apology in place of that
of those responsible. I would
also ask that they disassociate
the disgust they feel for the
callers from the members of
Delta Tau Delta. Thank you.
