# Iranian government claims control over hostages

### 
From the Daily wire services
Beirut, Lebanon â€” The Iranian gov
ernment said yesterday it was study
ing the latest U.S. proposals for solv
ing the hostage crisis and announced it
had full control over all 52 Americans
after three hostages were moved from
the Foreign Ministry to an undisclosed
location.
Prime Minister Mohammad Ali Ra
jai's spokesman Ahmad Azizi said the
American response to Iran's demands
was being studied and Iran's reaction
would be "announced later."
Azizi, a member of Iran's hostage
negotiation team, refused to say if all
52 Americans seized Nov. 4, 1979, had
been moved to a single location for the
first time. After a failed U.S. rescue
attempt last April, the hostages' cap
tors said the Americans had been scat
tered around the country.
Iranian officials have refused to dis
close where the Americans are being
held. Government spokesman and
head of the hostage negotiating team
Behzad Nabavi said on Dec. 21 the
hostages had been transferred recent
ly to "very beautiful hotels provided
with complete services."
Relinquished control
Azizi said, "The other 49 hostages
are now in the hands of the govern
ment," indicating for the first time
that the militants who seized the
American Embassy had relinquished
control over the captives as they
promised last November to do after

Iran's Parliament set four conditions
for their release.
U.S. Charge d'Affaires Bruce La
ingen, political officer Victor
Tomseth and security man Michael
Howland were at the Foreign Ministry
when the embassy was taken over by
the militants. They had been kept
there for the past 14 months.
Azizi was quoted by the official Ira
nian news agency Pars as saying the
three hostages were shifted to "a
more appropriate place of residence."
Azizi told the Associated Press the
move was made for reasons of "conve
nience" but responded, "I can't say"
when asked where the three were now
being held.
State Department spokesman John
Trattner commented yesterday on the
reported move.
"We have received only press re
ports," he said. "Until we know more
about the circumstances and purposes
of this move, we cannot evaluate it."
Speculated release
Some observers suggested the three
were moved because a week-long for
eign policy seminar was under way in
the ministry with top Iranian officials
attending. Others speculated the gov
ernment was gathering the hostages
in preparation either to release them
or to try them as spies, something Ira
nian officials have threatened to do if
the United States failed to meet Iran's
demands.
Iran has demanded that Washington

deposit some $24 billion in cash and
gold in Algeria as "guarantees"
against the return of Iranian assets
frozen in the United States and return
of money allegedly taken out of the
country by the late shah of Iran and his
family.
Tehran has also demanded a U.S.
pledge of non-interference in Iranian
affairs and the dropping of legal
claims against the Islamic Republic.
Washington has told Iran that Jan.
16 is the last practical day for reaching
a settlement with the Carter adminis
tration. President-elect Ronald Re
agan is to be sworn in Jan. 20. On Sat
urday, Tehran Radio said it was "to
tally improbable the hostages would
be freed before Reagan takes office."
Tehran Radio usually reflects the
views of the Islamic fundamentalists
who form a majority in the Iranian
Parliament. The fundamentalists, in
cluding Rajai, have clashed on a
number of issues with Iran's secular
moderates, headed by President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr.
Deposit
Sources said the latest U.S. reply
contains an offer to deposit some $12
billion in Algerian banks.
Algerian diplomats, who have been
acting as intermediaries in the nego
tiations, carried the U.S. message to
Tehran on Friday. Azizi said yester
day the "U.S. response is being stud
ied."
Conflicting signals from Tehran in

recent days have made it impossible
to predict Iran's response to the
American proposals. A series of
Tehran Radio commentaries, how
ever, has indicated growing Iranian
concern over how Reagan might act to
end the crisis.
Tehran Radio, broadcasting in
Urdu, the dominant language of Paki
stan, predicted yesterday that Reagan
would "most likely... use force and vi
olence."
It warned that "threats" would fail
to "browbeat the Moslems of Iran"
and could lead to a war in the Middle
East that would threaten Western
economies by engandering oil supplies
from the Persian Gulf.
