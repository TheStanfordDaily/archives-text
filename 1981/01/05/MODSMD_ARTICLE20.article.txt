## Thoughts on resolving sexism 
### 
"IT'S ALL RIGHT TO SMILE
AT ME! I WON'T RAPE YOU,"
the brightly colored button on
my shirt would announce to all
women as they pass me on the
sidewalk. But would they even
raise their eyes from the ground
to see it? Taking the subway to
work in Boston last year. ... I
get on the train and look for a
seat. Ah, there's one next to
that woman in the plaid shirt.
Hut wait. There are four empty
seats just ten feet past her and
she can see them. Should I sit
down next to her or walk further
and sit in the empty cluster?
Will she he uncomfortable if I
sit beside her? Will she think
that I passed up a chance to sit
alone so that I could sit near her
and eye her? Will she be afraid?
Hell, all I want to do is read
mv book! I'm a person and she's
a person. Why should I have to
even think about where I'm
going to sit and read?
I don't want to make her un
comfortable, though.
But I know I'm not going to

molest her!
She doesn't know, however. I
walk past her and sit in the
empty cluster, feeling angry
and frustrated.
I love people. I love watching
them, meeting them, talking
with them interacting. Rape
and sexual molestation have
stifled or destroyed the poten
tial for much of this human in
teraction. They have forced
women to build a protective
wall of fear and distrust be
tween themselves and men. It
gives me such pleasure to ex
change a simple smile and hello
with someone I've never met,
but it gets hard to smile at wom
en when they so often give me
looks that make me feel guilty
for having glanced in their
direction. I certainly can't
blame women that don't know
me for treating me as a poten
tial attacker. They've read too
many newspaper stories about
the "nice-looking man" who
committed vicious rapes on un
suspecting victims.

Half of adult America is
afraid of the other half. How can
the people of our society ever
hope to join together in closer
harmony and cooperation with
such a deep gorge separating
the sexes?
All the women's self-defense
classes and rape awareness
courses in the world won't stop
rape and sexism. Clearly it's
men in our society who will have
to change if this problem is ever
to be resolved. But what can I
say to my fellow males to raise
their consciousness that hasn't
already been said a million
times before? I feel helpless
against sexist attitudes that are
so deeply embedded in our cul
ture. One thing that does come
to mind is the advice that
Janice, a housemate and friend
of mine, offers to men. "Try to
see and deal with women as peo
ple," she says.
