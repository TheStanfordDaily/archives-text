## Reagan advisers study Iran policy 
### Washington Post 
Washington — The foreign
policy team of President-elect
Ronald Reagan has begun com
piling an inventory of options as
part of "a zero-based approach"
to the problem of the American
hostages in Iran, which Reagan
appears likely to inherit on In
auguration Day.
Sources in the Reagan camp,
while saying that no decisions
have been made, suggested that
the current consensus of senior
advisers favors a lower-tem
perature policy designed to im
prove the bargaining position of
the United States in the long run
rather than a high confrontation
effort designed to bring an im
mediate day of reckoning.
The captivity of the 52 Ameri
cans ended its 14th month yes
terday with Iranian authorities
considering the Carter adminis
tration's third, and probably
final, full-scale response to
Iran's announced conditions for
the hostages' release.
Hopes dashed
In view of the Iranian par
liament's action on Nov. 2 adop
ting mostly financial conditions
for the hostages' release and the
ensuing indirect negotiations
through Algerian emissaries,
both the Carter and Reagan
teams had been encouraged to
hope that the long ordeal of the
Americans would be ended
before the change of govern
ment here. A settlement of the
hostage problem would have
freed the incoming Reagan ad
ministration from a powerful
constraint on American free
dom of action in the Persian
Gulf and elsewhere, and could
have eliminated an issue that
has often preoccupied both the
public and the top rank of gov
ernment in this country.

As a solution before Jan. 20
became less likely, the Carter
administration adopted a policy
of making certain that its nego
tiating position with Iran did not
impinge on the freedom of ac
tion of the incoming Reagan ad
ministration.
This U.S. position was made
both more explicit and more
pertinent last week, when the
message carried to Tehran by
the Algerian emissaries speci
fied Jan. 16 as the final date on
which Iran could accept the
American proposals. The date
was selected, according to a
senior Carter strategist, be
cause it will take time to imple
ment the complex adminis
trative and legal arrangements
currently offered by the United
States in return for the
hostages' release.
Firm deadline
The crucial matter, accord
ing to this source, is that the
hostages must actually be re
leased by noon on Jan. 20 if the
Carter commitments are to ap
ply. The outgoing adminis
tration. by drawing a clear limit
in this fashion, is seeking to
avoid a situation in which the
details and interpretation of
U.S. commitments are still un
der negotiation when the of
ficials responsible for them are
out of office.
Sources in both camps said
the Carter administration's
clear statements of the time
limits on its proposal were un
dertaken without any prompt
ing from the Reagan camp.
Reagan himself has received
daily briefings from his foreign
policy aide, Richard Allen, or
other sources, but he has yet to
sit down to a full-dress review of
the Iranian problem, according
to those close to him.

In preparation for such a re
view and the beginnings of poli
cy-making. Allen in the past few
days ordered the compilation of
an inventory of potential options
for dealing with the problem af
ter Jan. 20. The inventory is re
ported to include policy papers
and suggestions from a number
of Reagan foreign-policy ad
visers as well as a more ex
tensive effort to gather per
tinent facts and assessments
from officials of the Carter ad
ministration.
If the hostages are not re

leased by then, an immediate is
sue facing Reagan on Jan. 20
will be whether to endorse the
proposals made to Iran by the
Carter administration, to take
them off the bargaining table
temporarily for a period of
study or to repudiate them. Dis
cussions with several Reagan
advisers suggests that, at a min
imum, the incoming adminis
tration is likely to suspend the
negotiations for a period of
study unless Iranian acceptance
of the Carter terms is seen as
imminent on Jan. 20.

Guerrilla army
Dozens of guerrillas armed with automatic rifles and submachine guns are shown in an un
disclosed location in El Salvador late last November. The Farabundo Marti Front of National
Liberation said its army is ready for "decisive combat" after the killings of six leftist leaders
by right-wing guerrillas.
