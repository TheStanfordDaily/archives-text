# Hu Yaobang expected to continue Deng's policies
## China's new leader takes charge 
### 
From the Dailv wire services
Beijing — In a country where
revolutionary military exploits
count for everything, he never
wore a general's stars. He's so
short of stature he disappears in
a committee. Most foreign
statesmen, including the U.S.
ambassador to Beijing — have
never met him.
When his name is mentioned,
it calls for puns as often as rec
ognition: "Who's Hu?"
But China's survival as a
modern state could well turn on
the untested leadership of Hu
Yaobang, the man chosen to in
herit the late Mao Zedong's
mantle after a four-year power
struggle.
Hu is known to possess a
brilliant mind. He wore the col
ors of Deng Xiaoping's mod
erates in the long battle for suc
cession, and on age alone — 65 —
he qualifies as the last of the
Chinese revolutionaries with
time to lead an enduring attack
on the country's mounting dif

ficulties.
Yet despite an impressive ca
reer as leader of China's youth
movement, Hu has never gov
erned a province nor run a gov
ernment ministry, and now he
must try to rule the world's
most populous nation at a time
of severe economic, social and
political upheaval.
Actually Hu won't officially
become chairman until a full
party congress, which is now ex
pected in April or May. But
since he was named head of the
party secretariat last February,
he's been in day-to-day com
mand, leaving only ceremonial
duties to an increasingly
isolated Chairman Hua
Guofeng, the standard bearer of
the Maoists.
The party's Central Commit
tee, which elects the chairman,
decided informally during
Christmas week to proceed with
removing Hua. A formal
plenary session of the 325-mem
ber committee is currently
scheduled for next month to rat
ify Hua's resignation and estab
lish the timetable for Hu's of
ficial installation.
People are already predicting
what sort of leader Hu will be:
pragmatic, like his mentor,
Vice-Chairman Deng; deeply
rooted to China's historic re
alities like Chairman Mao
(from whose home province Hu
comes); a master of adminis
tration, like the revered late
premier Zhou Enlai. But, they
say, he brings yet another quali
ty from his quarter-century as
head of the Communist Youth
Movement; he Nstens easily and
responds quickly to people's
changing needs.
So they say, plus one other
thing: he thinks thorough-going

Marxism. first and last.
How much'of this is fact and
how much mere hope shouldn't
take long to establish. Despite
the stretched-out transition in
herent in cumbersome party
rule£. Hu is already putting his
stamp on the Communist Party
apparatus
That became clear New
Year's Day when Hu presided
over the annual reception given
by the Central Committee in the
Great Hall of the People.
Although the Foreign Min
istry continued to maintain that
Hua remains in the chair
manship until formally re
moved. his name was not men
tioned in the New Year's Day
coverage, and the chairman's
customary toast was given by
Hu: "We wish our friends who
have fought alongside our party
for many years good health and
happiness."
For Hu. that particular toast
was far from a platitude. It
surely was intended as a re
minder that almost alone of his
"younger" generation of lead
ers, he was among Mao's ori
ginal revolutionaries. Hu is sup
posed to have joined up with
Hunan Province's "Autumn
Harvest" uprising in 1927, a de
bacle ordered by Mao Zedong's
party superior and the begin
ning of the late chairman's de
termination to take charge of
the party himself. If Hu was
born in 1915, as officially stated,
then he was a revolutionary at
the age of 12.
At 14, he is known to have left
his home county to join the sur
viving forces of the Autumn
Harvest uprising in a moun
tainous area commanded by
Mao. From then on he was near
the center of China's revolution

— on the famous Long March, in
the Communists' Northwest Re
doubt at Yenan and during the
anti-Japanese War in the late
19305.
The years at Yenan. where
Mao organized a complete gov
ernment-in-exile out of reach of
Nationalist forces concentrated
~in populous eastern China, were
particularly significant for Hu.
Being born to a poor family in a
small provincial village meant
there had been no formal school
ing for him; during the decade
in Yenan he studied constantly
and emerged as one of the more
knowledgeable Marxist schol
ars in the revolutionary estab
lishment.
The word is that Hu's first
move in the chairmanship will
be a far-reaching purge to
eliminate the incapable or in
tractable from party member
ship. a '"rectification" that ul
timately might strip credentials
from several million members
or more. It is said that the
cleansing will be a relatively
kindly one.
After the house-cleaning
comes an even tougher job. Hu
will have to convince the popu
lace that there really is a func
tion for the party in a society
supposedly built on pragmatism
rather than ideology. And if the
pragmatism fails, he must re
vive and refurbish an ideology
badly stained in Mao's last
years.
Pessimists may wonder why
Hu. already 65 and not a robust
man (a chain smoker, he was
felled by altitude sickness dur
ing a visit to Tibet last year)
would undertake a job with so
manv uncertainties.
