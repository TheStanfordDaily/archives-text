# Kissinger calls for tougher African policy
## 
### Washington Post 
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Former Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger gave
Saturday what may be the first concrete
signals that the incoming Reagan admin
istration intends to change U.S. policy
toward Africa by viewing it more as an
area of confrontation with the Soviet Un
ion.
"It is not tolerable that the Soviet Un
ion and its proxy forces engage in ex
pansion all over Africa and in the Middle
East without opposition," Kissinger told
reporters after returning to Cairo from
Somalia, where he made an unscheduled
one-day break in a Middle East trip.
Although he has described the tour as
private, Kissinger has spoken extensive
ly about U.S. foreign policy — past, pres
ent and future — and the trip has had the
impact in the region of an official mis
sion for the incoming Reagan adminis
tration.
"I think the Reagan administration
believes in a balance of power and be
lieves that expansionism must be
checked," Kissinger said.
He added that Somalia was "threat
ened"' by neighboring Ethiopia, which is
supported by about 13,000 Cuban troops

and approximately $1.5 billion worth of
Soviet arms.
For the most part, the Carter adminis
tration has sought to deal with the conti
nent outside the sphere of East-West con
frontation and more in terms of African
concerns, particularly over white rule in
southern Africa. Led by Andrew Young,
former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, the policy reaped better rela
tions with many African nations that dis
cerned a shift from Kissinger's policy of
"benign neglect."
Kissinger's remarks in support of
Somalia, reported by news agencies in
Cairo, were far stronger than any made
by the Carter administration, which has
tried unsuccessfully to leave open the
door for friendship with Ethiopia, a U.S.
ally until the 1974 overthrow of Emperor
Haile Selassie by a Marxist military re
gime.
Kissinger met Friday in Mogadishu
with Somali President Mohammed Siad
Barre. In an interview with NBC tele
vision after the talks Barre criticized
Carter and expressed hope that Reagan
would be more forceful.
Complaining about the lack of U.S.
military aid, the Somali leader said,

"Had Carter's steps been more prompt,
a stable atmosphere would have been at
tained in the region."
Any escalation of American military
assistance to Mogadishu could embroil
the United States in a long-simmering
feud between Ethiopia and Somalia over
the Ogaden territory in southeastern
Ethiopia.
Twice in the last two decades there has
been full-scale warfare, and last sum
mer Ethiopian forces inflicted heavy
losses on Somali troops and guerrillas of
the Western Somali Liberation Front
fighting to control the area. Ethiopia has
now regained control of most of the terri
tory.
The Carter administration vacillated
for three years over whether to ally itself
with Somalia after the Soviet Union
dropped Somalia in 1977 and gave
massive military aid to Ethiopia.
Congress, however, has prevented the
delivery of any arms to Somalia yet,
since it stipulated that no weapons
should be delivered until the government
can provide "verified assurance" that
there are no Somal i troops in the Ogaden.
The arms barrier could be lifted, how

ever, by the new Republican-dominated
congress, particularly since one of the
key opponents of arming Somalia, Rep.
Stephen Solarz (D-N. Y.), is giving up his
influential post as chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
Africa.
Kissinger implicitly criticized the con
gressional action when he was asked in
Cairo about chances of expanding U.S.-
Somali military cooperation.
"Let us first implement what already
has been signed, and then one can see
about expansion. This is a matter I would
like to report to the leading personalities
of the Reagan administration who will
have to make the decision."
He described Somalia as "a country
that is threatened by a heavily armed
neighbor (Ethiopia) in which there is
much Soviet equipment, Soviet proxy
forces of Cubans, other communist-sup
ported forces from East Germany and
South Yemen. And it is a country that is
located strategically at the mouth of the
Indian Ocean and of the Red Sea.
"This is a matter that, in my personal
judgment, cannot be of indifference to
the United States," he said, adding, "Our
friends will become dubious."

tried unsuccessfully to leave open the
door for friendship with Ethiopia, a U.S.
ally until the 1974 overthrow of Emperor
Haile Selassie by a Marxist military re
gime.
Kissinger met Friday in Mogadishu
with Somali President Mohammed Siad
Barre. In an interview with NBC tele
vision after the talks Barre criticized
Carter and expressed hope that Reagan
would be more forceful.
Complaining about the lack of U.S.
military aid, the Somali leader said,

"Had Carter's steps been more prompt,
a stable atmosphere would have been at
tained in the region."
Any escalation of American military
assistance to Mogadishu could embroil
the United States in a long-simmering
feud between Ethiopia and Somalia over
the Ogaden territory in southeastern
Ethiopia.
Twice in the last two decades there has
been full-scale warfare, and last sum
mer Ethiopian forces inflicted heavy
losses on Somali troops and guerrillas of
the Western Somali Liberation Front
fighting to control the area. Ethiopia has
now regained control of most of the terri
tory.
The Carter administration vacillated
for three years over whether to ally itself
with Somalia after the Soviet Union
dropped Somalia in 1977 and gave
massive military aid to Ethiopia.
Congress, however, has prevented the
delivery of any arms to Somalia yet,
since it stipulated that no weapons
should be delivered until the government
can provide "verified assurance" that
there are no Somal i troops in the Ogaden.
The arms barrier could be lifted, how

ever, by the new Republican-dominated
congress, particularly since one of the
key opponents of arming Somalia, Rep.
Stephen Solarz (D-N. Y.), is giving up his
influential post as chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
Africa.
Kissinger implicitly criticized the con
gressional action when he was asked in
Cairo about chances of expanding U.S.-
Somali military cooperation.
"Let us first implement what already
has been signed, and then one can see
about expansion. This is a matter I would
like to report to the leading personalities
of the Reagan administration who will
have to make the decision."
He described Somalia as "a country
that is threatened by a heavily armed
neighbor (Ethiopia) in which there is
much Soviet equipment, Soviet proxy
forces of Cubans, other communist-sup
ported forces from East Germany and
South Yemen. And it is a country that is
located strategically at the mouth of the
Indian Ocean and of the Red Sea.
"This is a matter that, in my personal
judgment, cannot be of indifference to
the United States," he said, adding, "Our
friends will become dubious."
Salisbury, Zimbabwe — Former Sec
retary of State Henry Kissinger gave
Saturday what may be the first concrete
signals that the incoming Reagan admin
istration intends to change U.S. policy
toward Africa by viewing it more as an
area of confrontation with the Soviet Un
ion.
"It is not tolerable that the Soviet Un
ion and its proxy forces engage in ex
pansion all over Africa and in the Middle
East without opposition," Kissinger told
reporters after returning to Cairo from
Somalia, where he made an unscheduled
one-day break in a Middle East trip.
Although he has described the tour as
private, Kissinger has spoken extensive
ly about U.S. foreign policy — past, pres
ent and future — and the trip has had the
impact in the region of an official mis
sion for the incoming Reagan adminis
tration.
"I think the Reagan administration
believes in a balance of power and be
lieves that expansionism must be
checked," Kissinger said.
He added that Somalia was "threat
ened"' by neighboring Ethiopia, which is
supported by about 13,000 Cuban troops

and approximately $1.5 billion worth of
Soviet arms.
For the most part, the Carter adminis
tration has sought to deal with the conti
nent outside the sphere of East-West con
frontation and more in terms of African
concerns, particularly over white rule in
southern Africa. Led by Andrew Young,
former U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, the policy reaped better rela
tions with many African nations that dis
cerned a shift from Kissinger's policy of
"benign neglect."
Kissinger's remarks in support of
Somalia, reported by news agencies in
Cairo, were far stronger than any made
by the Carter administration, which has
tried unsuccessfully to leave open the
door for friendship with Ethiopia, a U.S.
ally until the 1974 overthrow of Emperor
Haile Selassie by a Marxist military re
gime.
