# Drops Pac-10 opener to Cal 58-56
## Stanford can't overcome late lapse 
### Chris Haft 
Berkeley — For the most
part, the Stanford Cardinals did
everything they could to win
their Pacific-10 Conference
men's basketball opener against
California Saturday night
There were a few minutes,
though, where the Cards
stopped doing anything. That
period influenced, if not directly
caused, their 58-56 loss to the
Golden Bears in Harmon Gym.
The crucial inactivity began
with 7:50 left to play and Cal
holding a 52-50 lead. Stanford
emerged from a time-out huddle
and went into a spread-court of
fense: guard Keith Jones at the
left wing, guard Doug Marty
near the center-court circle and
forward Brian Welch at the
right wing.
For nearly four minutes the
trio played catch, occasionally
Hipping the ball to John Revelii
or Jeff Ryan at the high post
(free-throw line area) to break
the monotony.
No Cardinal tried to score un
til 3:50 remained, when Revelii
took a pass at the left side of the
free-throw line and drove to the
basket. Cal's Butch Hays stole
the ball, accelerated downcourt
and drew a foul from Marty
while attempting a lavup.
Hays sank both free throws,
giving Cal a 54-50 lead. Though
the Cards tied the score twice
thereafter and nearly forced ov
ertime. the fact remained that
they did nothing positive during
their four-minute hiatus —
which had an overall negative
result.

Holding the ball to protect a
lead is a common practice in
college basketball, but stalling
when behind in the score vio
lates not only strategy but also
common sense. After all, you
can't catch up unless you try to
score.
However, Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso denied that
the Cards, now 4-6, immobilized
themselves offensively by stall
ing "1 said to the players, Any
time you think you can take a
lavup, take it.' " he said.
Dißiaso's intention was to
keep the score close enough so
that the game would be decided
in the final five minutes, and the
stall guaranteed that. He also
pointed out that players such as
Revelii and Welch, who both
performed the entire 40 minutes
because Orlando Ward missed
the game with academic dif
ficulties (see storv on same
page*, needed some form of
rest.
"I didn't think it (the stall)
was a big thing.'' Dißiaso
summed up.
But Cal center Mark
McNamara disagreed, believ
ing that the Cards' delay dis
rupted their progress and repre
sented a lack of aggression.
"It said to us, Thev don't
want to play against us.' It hurt
them because they were having
a good game, and after that. I
felt we always had the momen
tum," McNamara said.
McNamara added that the
Cards weren't the only ones giv
en rest during the stall.
"I started getting tired with
around nine minutes to go." he
said. "That stall saved me."
Cards' last shot
Despite the stall's stagnating
effect, the Cards fought back
gamely. Marty hit a daring 10-
foot running jumper, and after
McNamara missed the first free
throw of a one-and-one situ
ation. Revelii drew a foul from
Michael Pitts and coolly
meshed two free throws to forge
a 54-54 tie. The tie stood after
Cal's Mike Chavez and Welch
traded long jumpers.
With 17 seconds left. Kevin
Singleton, who had been shoot
ing poorly (five-for-13), canned
a short baseline jumper to give
the Bears a 58-56 lead and the
eventual winning margin.
After a time out. the Cards
worked the ball to Welch, their
best outside shooter. Yet on this
night, the 6-foot-7 junior was the

team's unluckiest player, shoot
ing a woeful three-for-17 from
the floor His and Stanford's
final shot at success curled
around the rim and off.
"It kind of hung up there —
when I released it.it felt good."
said Welch of his last shot.
Kxplaining his game-long in
accuracy. Welch said. "1 got off
to a poor start That threw my
timing off. I started pressing
and 1 went downhill.''
Season's best
However, the Cards' overall
effort was not so disastrous.
Stanford overcame 6-foot-ll
twins McNamara and Pitts.
Ward's absence and a vocif
erous sellout crowd of 6760 to
play its best game of the season.
Welch, for example, partially
atoned for his awry shooting
with determined work inside,
grabbing a game-high 11 re
bounds.

"Our guvs were just super."
Dißiaso said "I can't re
member the last time a team
executed a game plan as well as
we did tonight."
None of the Cards executed as
well as Revelii. The 6-foot-7
freshman scored a game-high 20
points in his Pac-10 indoctri
nation. combining the ferocity
of his powerful drives and 10 re
bounds with the finesse of his
eight-for-nine free-throw shoot
ing
"I was just psyched up. and
whenever I had the shot inside, I
went hard to the basket," Rev
elii said When asked how he
was able to get his inside shots.
Revelii answered, "Passes."
Shots, however, gave the
Cards an early advantage. Jeff
Ryan, Ward's replacement,
fired in two jumpers and Welch
added another to give Stanford a
6-0 lead with barely more than a

minute elapsed.
The Cards twice held nine
point leads, at 18-9 and 20-11, but
over the last nine minutes of the
first half MeNamara poured in
eight points and Hays con
tributed seven, helping Cal as
sume a 32-31 halftime edge.
NOTES: The Cards also
played six non-conference
games since the Daily last pub
lished. winning three and losing
three. Showing a penchant for
victimizing schools with hy
phenated names, Stanford de
feated UC-Davis 68-62. UC-,
Irvine 98-84 and Wisconsin-Su
perior 77-69. However, the
Cards also endured a three
game losing streak, falling to St.
Mary's 73-66. Portland 82-69 and
UC-San Diego 79-70. This week
end the Cards travel north to
face Oregon State and Oregon in
Pac-10 action.

Dißiaso said "I can't re

None of the Cards executed as

"I was just psyched up. and

Revelii answered, "Passes."
Shots, however, gave the
Cards an early advantage. Jeff
Ryan, Ward's replacement,
fired in two jumpers and Welch
added another to give Stanford a
6-0 lead with barely more than a

minute elapsed.
The Cards twice held nine
point leads, at 18-9 and 20-11, but
over the last nine minutes of the
first half MeNamara poured in
eight points and Hays con
tributed seven, helping Cal as

Irvine 98-84 and Wisconsin-Su

Berkeley — For the most
part, the Stanford Cardinals did
everything they could to win
their Pacific-10 Conference
men's basketball opener against
California Saturday night
There were a few minutes,
though, where the Cards
stopped doing anything. That
period influenced, if not directly
caused, their 58-56 loss to the
Golden Bears in Harmon Gym.
The crucial inactivity began
with 7:50 left to play and Cal
holding a 52-50 lead. Stanford
emerged from a time-out huddle
and went into a spread-court of
fense: guard Keith Jones at the
left wing, guard Doug Marty
near the center-court circle and
forward Brian Welch at the
right wing.
For nearly four minutes the
trio played catch, occasionally
Hipping the ball to John Revelii
or Jeff Ryan at the high post
(free-throw line area) to break
the monotony.
No Cardinal tried to score un
til 3:50 remained, when Revelii
took a pass at the left side of the
free-throw line and drove to the
basket. Cal's Butch Hays stole
the ball, accelerated downcourt
and drew a foul from Marty
while attempting a lavup.
Hays sank both free throws,
giving Cal a 54-50 lead. Though
the Cards tied the score twice
thereafter and nearly forced ov
ertime. the fact remained that
they did nothing positive during
their four-minute hiatus —
which had an overall negative
result.

Holding the ball to protect a
lead is a common practice in
college basketball, but stalling
when behind in the score vio
lates not only strategy but also
common sense. After all, you
can't catch up unless you try to
score.
However, Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso denied that
the Cards, now 4-6, immobilized
themselves offensively by stall
ing "1 said to the players, Any
time you think you can take a
lavup, take it.' " he said.
Dißiaso's intention was to
keep the score close enough so
that the game would be decided
in the final five minutes, and the
stall guaranteed that. He also
pointed out that players such as
Revelii and Welch, who both
performed the entire 40 minutes
because Orlando Ward missed
the game with academic dif
ficulties (see storv on same
page*, needed some form of
rest.
"I didn't think it (the stall)
was a big thing.'' Dißiaso
summed up.
But Cal center Mark
McNamara disagreed, believ
ing that the Cards' delay dis
rupted their progress and repre
sented a lack of aggression.
"It said to us, Thev don't
want to play against us.' It hurt
them because they were having
a good game, and after that. I
felt we always had the momen
tum," McNamara said.
McNamara added that the
Cards weren't the only ones giv
en rest during the stall.
"I started getting tired with
around nine minutes to go." he
said. "That stall saved me."
Cards' last shot
Despite the stall's stagnating
effect, the Cards fought back
gamely. Marty hit a daring 10-
foot running jumper, and after
McNamara missed the first free
throw of a one-and-one situ
ation. Revelii drew a foul from
Michael Pitts and coolly
meshed two free throws to forge
a 54-54 tie. The tie stood after
Cal's Mike Chavez and Welch
traded long jumpers.
With 17 seconds left. Kevin
Singleton, who had been shoot
ing poorly (five-for-13), canned
a short baseline jumper to give
the Bears a 58-56 lead and the
eventual winning margin.
After a time out. the Cards
worked the ball to Welch, their
best outside shooter. Yet on this
night, the 6-foot-7 junior was the

team's unluckiest player, shoot
ing a woeful three-for-17 from
the floor His and Stanford's
final shot at success curled
around the rim and off.
"It kind of hung up there —
when I released it.it felt good."
said Welch of his last shot.
