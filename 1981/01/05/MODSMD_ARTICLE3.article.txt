# Iran-Iraq war
## Border war affects oil prices 
### Dan Fiduccia 
The Iran-Iraq war will cause higher
gasoline prices this summer, strain
the world oil situation for the next cou
ple of years, and cause reestablish
ment of Iranian-U.S. relations, ac
cording to a Hoover Institution econo
mist.
Karim Pakravan, a Hoover visiting
fellow in petroleum economics, says
that oil prices will rise in six months
amd the world oil market will be "on
the razor's edge" for the next two to
three years.
Pakravan's prediction is seconded
by a recent Congressional report
which asserts that prices at the gas
pumps will be 40 to 45 cents higher by
this summer because of the Persian
Gulf conflict. Saudi Arabia's mid-De
cember increase in oil prices caused a
5 cent gasoline price increase.
No Output
Iran has virtually no oil output now
because of the war, and is exporting
only minute amounts of crude oil, said
Pakrayan. This oil is coming from
fields in eastern Iran away from the
fighting in the oil province on the Iran-
Iraq border.
"Production will return to one mil
lion barrels a day in six months, pro
vided the (Iranian) government re
stores order immediately after the
war," Pakravan said. He estimated it
will take up to three years for Iran to
rebuild the refineries which have been
destroyed in the fighting. Besides new
parts, Iran Will also need foreign tech
nicians because many native techni
cians were purged during the Iranian

revolution, added Pakravan.
Pakravan, an Iranian who has stud
ied in the U.S. and taught in Iran, said
Iran wil need U.S. assistance to re
build its oil facilities.
$25 billion damage
"There is $25 billion war damage in
Iran and $15 billion at Abadan (oil re
finery complex) alone," said
Pakravan.
Iran will need to produce 2Vz to 3V2
million barrels a day just to repair its
war damage, Pakravan said. Pre-war
production was 1 to 1 l /z million barrels
a day.
The post-revolution chaos in Iran
and the war will make Iran seek the
help of the West and Russia, predicted
Pakravan. "Foreigners will have to
come back to Iran, and the govern
ment will have to be reasonable to its
people."
Besides damaging Iranian oil prod
uction, the war has pushed Iran's
economy further downhill, said
Pakravan. "You could find goods in
Iran until the war."
Iran's post-war need for U.S. oil
technology may have some bearing on
the resolution of the hostage crisis, ac
cording to Pakravan. He also pointed
out that Iran could recover money
equal to the shah's reported wealth
within six months if Iranian oil prod
uction can be brought to three million
barrels a day.
Small refineries
Pakravan said Iran needs many
small refineries instead of the large
Abadan complex which is near the
Iraq border, where the most bitter

fighting of the war has occurred.
"Iran is producing 150,000 barrels a
day from its refineries, and is surviv
ing the war through rationing and liv
ing off its oil stocks," said Pakravan.
Pakravan said he believes it will
take close to two years for Iran to ex
port one million barrels a day of crude
oil, and five years to export refined
oil. J
The loss of the three million barrels
a day which Iran and Iraq exported
prior to the war is not being felt be
cause Saudi Arabia has increased its
production and there is also a world oil
glut, he said.
At capacity
However, the Saudis can not con
tinue pumping oil at the current level.
"They're at their capacity, and they'll
damage their oil fields if they con
tinue," explained Pakravan.
Saudi Arabia and other oil-produc
ing countries will cut back their prod
uction as Iran and Iraq begin to in
crease their post-war production.
However, if Iraq is able to quickly re
sume oil production, an oil glut may
occur within two years, since other oil
producers may not reduce their prod
uction as quickly as Iraq increases its
abilities, added Pakravan.
The gas lines of two summers ago
shouldn't return because oil users can
distribute oil stockpiles fairly as long
as governments don't intervene, said
Pakravan He added that if emission
laws are lessened and conservation is
increased under the Reagan adminis
tration. the oil situation will be further
helped.

The Iran-Iraq war will cause higher
gasoline prices this summer, strain
the world oil situation for the next cou
ple of years, and cause reestablish
ment of Iranian-U.S. relations, ac
cording to a Hoover Institution econo
mist.
Karim Pakravan, a Hoover visiting
fellow in petroleum economics, says
that oil prices will rise in six months
amd the world oil market will be "on
the razor's edge" for the next two to
three years.
Pakravan's prediction is seconded
by a recent Congressional report
which asserts that prices at the gas
pumps will be 40 to 45 cents higher by
this summer because of the Persian
Gulf conflict. Saudi Arabia's mid-De
cember increase in oil prices caused a
5 cent gasoline price increase.
No Output
Iran has virtually no oil output now
because of the war, and is exporting
only minute amounts of crude oil, said
Pakrayan. This oil is coming from
fields in eastern Iran away from the
fighting in the oil province on the Iran-
Iraq border.
"Production will return to one mil
lion barrels a day in six months, pro
vided the (Iranian) government re
stores order immediately after the
war," Pakravan said. He estimated it
will take up to three years for Iran to
rebuild the refineries which have been
destroyed in the fighting. Besides new
parts, Iran Will also need foreign tech
nicians because many native techni
cians were purged during the Iranian

revolution, added Pakravan.
Pakravan, an Iranian who has stud
ied in the U.S. and taught in Iran, said
Iran wil need U.S. assistance to re
build its oil facilities.
$25 billion damage
"There is $25 billion war damage in
Iran and $15 billion at Abadan (oil re
finery complex) alone," said
Pakravan.
Iran will need to produce 2Vz to 3V2
million barrels a day just to repair its
war damage, Pakravan said. Pre-war
production was 1 to 1 l /z million barrels
a day.
The post-revolution chaos in Iran
and the war will make Iran seek the
help of the West and Russia, predicted
Pakravan. "Foreigners will have to
come back to Iran, and the govern
ment will have to be reasonable to its
people."
Besides damaging Iranian oil prod
uction, the war has pushed Iran's
economy further downhill, said
Pakravan. "You could find goods in
Iran until the war."
Iran's post-war need for U.S. oil
technology may have some bearing on
the resolution of the hostage crisis, ac
cording to Pakravan. He also pointed
out that Iran could recover money
equal to the shah's reported wealth
within six months if Iranian oil prod
uction can be brought to three million
barrels a day.
Small refineries
Pakravan said Iran needs many
small refineries instead of the large
Abadan complex which is near the
Iraq border, where the most bitter

fighting of the war has occurred.
"Iran is producing 150,000 barrels a
day from its refineries, and is surviv
ing the war through rationing and liv
ing off its oil stocks," said Pakravan.
Pakravan said he believes it will
take close to two years for Iran to ex
port one million barrels a day of crude
oil, and five years to export refined
oil. J
The loss of the three million barrels
a day which Iran and Iraq exported
prior to the war is not being felt be
cause Saudi Arabia has increased its
production and there is also a world oil
glut, he said.
At capacity
However, the Saudis can not con
tinue pumping oil at the current level.
"They're at their capacity, and they'll
damage their oil fields if they con
tinue," explained Pakravan.
Saudi Arabia and other oil-produc
ing countries will cut back their prod
uction as Iran and Iraq begin to in
crease their post-war production.
However, if Iraq is able to quickly re
sume oil production, an oil glut may
occur within two years, since other oil
producers may not reduce their prod
uction as quickly as Iraq increases its
abilities, added Pakravan.
The gas lines of two summers ago
shouldn't return because oil users can
distribute oil stockpiles fairly as long
as governments don't intervene, said
Pakravan He added that if emission
laws are lessened and conservation is
increased under the Reagan adminis
tration. the oil situation will be further
helped.
