Cleveland (AP) â€” Mark van
Eeghen can get back to thinking
about warm and sunny San Die
go again He and the rest of the
Oakland Raiders will be playing
there Sunday, shooting for a trip
to the Super Bowl.
Van Eeghen climaxed Oak
land's only two lengthy drives
across the frozen tundra in
cavernous Municipal Stadium
yesterday with a pair of 1-yard
touchdown plunges which
enabled the Raiders to edge the
Cleveland Browns 14-12.
The two TDs propelled Oak
land into the American Football
Conference championship game
Sunday against the Chargers,
20-14 playoff winners Saturday
over Buffalo.
The Raiders' victory wasn't
secured until strong safety Mike
Davis intercepted a Brian Sipe
pass in the end zone with 41 sec
onds to play.
Davis' game-saving intercep
tion came on a pass intended for
Ozzie Newsome with the
Browns on the Oakland 13-yard

line Before they broke the
huddle." Davis said, "we fig
ured they d run the ball. But
they came out in a passing for
mation so we knew as defensive
backs they were going to throw.
1 just wanted to make sure I
caught it and was just fortunate
that it happened. I caught it and
then rolled over to secure it.
"1 saw Ozzie look up so I
looked up 1 saw Sipe let go of
the ball and then positioned my
self for it."
Van Eeghen put the Raiders
on the scoreboard first with only
18 seconds remaining in the first
half, culminating a 14-play, 64-
vard march. His TD wiped out
the Browns' 6-0 lead And after
Cleveland went ahead 12-7 on
Don Cockcroft's third-period
field goals of 30 and 29 yards, the
Raiders swept 80 yards in 12
plays, with van Eeghen bursting
the final inches with 9:22 to
play.
The Raiders had a chance to
put the game on ice when, with
4:38 to play. Sipe fumbled while

scrambling and cornerback
Dwavne O'Steen recovered for
Oakland at the Browns' 24-yard
line.
They pushed to the Browns'
15. but on fourth-and-one, van
Eeghen was stopped for no gain
and Cleveland got the ball back
with 2:22 left.

29 yards to Newsome, who was

their 49 with 1:19 to play. On the

Raiders' 28.
On second-and-10, Mike

peared inevitable. Instead, Sipe
