# Northwestern hires Single, Green and hopes
## 
### 
Stanford is the academic
leader of the Pacific-10 Con
ference and competitive in ath
letics. Northwestern is the
academic leader of the Big Ten
Conference and well . . .
When the Wildcats decided to
try and improve their flailing
athletic program, they looked to
Stanford. As a result, Doug Sin
gle and Denny Green are mov
ing to Illinois.

The 29-year-old Single, was
named athletic director at
Northwestern the second week
in December. An associate ath :
letic director here and generally
considered to be number two be
hind Athletic Director Andy
Geiger, Single wasted little
time in his new surroundings.
One week later, in his first ma
jor move, he hired Green away
from his offensive coordinator

position at Stanford to become
head coach of the Wildcats.
Green, 31, becomes the first
black head coach in Big Ten his
tory. He has no easy task ahead.
Northwestern was 1-31-1 in its
last three seasons under Rick
Venturi, who was fired after the
close of the 1980 season.
ISetters beaten
Both Stanford tennis teams
took a beating at this weekend's
National Collegiate Classic in
Palm Springs in the opener of
the 1981 season. Dick Gould's
men's team finish tied for
fourth in an eight-team field,
while the women, coached by
Frank Brennan, finished in a
fifth-place tie out of eight
teams.
Four players — not the usual
six or seven of dual matches —
represented each school. The
Cards have always used this

tournament as a testing ground
for the upcoming season, and it
was no different this year. "We
consider this a warm-up, while
the other teams consider it a lit
tle more than that," Brennan
said.
Stanford All-America Alycia
Moulton, seeded second, bowed
out in the quarterfinals, while
Donna Rubin survived a first
round loss to win the consolation
division.
Top-seeded Scott Davis led
the Cardinal men, losing to
eventual champion Mike Bauer
of Cal in the semifinals 4-6, 6-3,
6-4.
UCLA edged Cal to win the
men's title, and USC dominated
in winning the women's cham
pionship.
Cagers struggle
The Stanford women's
basketball team could not put it

together during finals week and
the ensuing vacation, losing
three of four games to drop its
record for the year to 8-6.
The Washington Huskies
snuck away with an 84-78 over
time win Dec. 13 at Maples
Pavilion. The Cards led 72-68
with 16 seconds remaining in
regulation, but could not hold
the lead and succumbed to dead
ly Washington shooting from the
free throw line in overtime.
Another second-half collapse
caused a loss one week later,
when Montana drubbed Stan
ford 66-49 at Maples. Once
again, the home team was icy
cold, shooting only 37.5 from the
field. Montana held Stanford
ace Kim Kupferer to only two
points.
Kupferer and her teammates
took out their frustration on
New Year's Eve, beating
Montclair State 84-80. Stanford

set a school record with 83
percent shooting from the field
in the second half. Kupferer
scored 26 points and Louise
Smith added 17, and the Cards
outrebounded the visitors 56-37.
Saturday night the Cards lost
to USC in Los Angeles on the
first leg of a two-game road trip
which continues tonight at Cal
Poly-Pomona. Coach Dotty
McCrea's Cards return home
Thursday night to host national
power Louisiana State at 8 p.m.
Gymnasts fourth
At the Aloha Gymfest in Hon
olulu, Stanford finished fourth
in a field of six teams despite
competing without its top two
performers. Marilyn Chapman
and Karen Hall were out with a
sprained knee and ankle, re
spectively. Cal State-Fullerton
won the tournament hosted by
Hawaii-Hilo with 104.25 points,

Oregon State finished second
and Nebraska was third.
