Israeli cabinet remains near collapse
Jerusalem— The Israeli Cabinet, ignoring calls for its
resignation, staved off collapse yesterday by agreeing to
compromise on teachers' pay raises but remained in seri
ous trouble.
The government rallied to the side of Interior Minister
Yosef Burg who faces allegations he put a stop to police
investigation of his ministry.
The Cabinet set up a committee of ministers to study the
pay issue, resolving what had appeared Saturday to be an
irreconcilable dispute over pay raises for Israel's 58,000
teachers.
The move gives the government of Prime Minister Men
achem Begin a temporary reprieve from what is seen as
the strongest political challenge of his three years in of
fice. Begin s term expires next November.
But the teacher crisis, coupled with a storm of public in
dignation over the firing of Israel's police chief in the
midst of a probe into allegations of high-level corruption,
appeared to push Begin s government closer than ever to
collapse.
Two Americans killed in El Salvador
San Salvador, El Salvador — Unidentified gunmen as
sassinated two American lawyers and a high-ranking
Salvadoran government official, a month after the murder
of four American missionaries brought an official protest
from the U.S. government.
The president of the ruling civilian-military junta, Jose
Napoleon Duarte. said "an exhaustive investigation will
be made" into the slayings late Saturday of Mark David
Pearlman, 42, Michael Peter Hammer, 44, and the
Salvadoran president of the Agrarian Transformation In
stitute, Jose Rodolfo Viera, 40.

Police spokesmen in this Central American nation said
special units have been assigned to the case but that there
were no leads to the identity of two gunmen who walked
into the Sheraton Hotel restaurant here shortly before
midnight Saturday and shot the men to death at a table
where they were having coffee.
No one claimed responsibility for the killings.
Carter seeks reduced pay hikes
Washington - The federal government's 1 million
clerks, scientists, lawyers and other white-collar civil ser
vants would get a 5.5 percent raise next October — their
smallest pay hike in years — under a sharply revised
budget President Jimmy Carter will send Congress later
this month.
Carter's final budget also will propose a raise in excess
of 9 percent for military personnel, who normally get the
same raises as U.S. civilian workers.
Federal workers, whose pay raises each October are
based on recommendations of the president, got a 9.1
percent increase last year. Carter budget aides had ori
ginally settled on a recommendation of 8.7 percent for gov
ernment workers next October, and a 9.25 percent adjust
ment for the military.
The decision to trim that raise for white-collar workers
was a last-minute attempt to cut some red ink from
Carter's final budget recommendation. Each 1 percent in
crease in federal pay costs around $500 million, so the
change would trim more than $1.5 billion from budget esti
mates for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
'Yorkshire Ripper' to be arraigned
Leeds, England — Authorities said a man arrested for
questioning in the "Yorkshire Ripper" reign of murder in

northern Kngland would be arraigned today "on a serious
charge" and that they were delighted with developments
in their five-year manhunt.
• We are absolutely delighted, totally delighted, with the
developments at this stage," said Chief Constable Ronald
liregorv of the West Yorkshire police.
Gregory said the man in custody is in his 30s, is married
and came from Bradford, where three of the 13 women be
lieved to be victims of the brutal Ripper were murdered.
He would not give the man's name nor say what the charge
is.
Gregory said the man was arrested on Friday by Shef
field police in the neighboring South Yorkshire police dis
trict for questioning in the theft of auto license plates.
The authorities' announcement of the developments
was a major turn in the hunt for the "Yorkshire Ripper,"
which has seen police question 200,000 people, search
30.000 houses and check 180,000 vehicles. Their search
yielded details on the killer — down to his occupation and
blood type — but never his identity.
Reagan to meet with Mexican leader
Los Angeles — President-elect Ronald Reagan, on his
first post-election diplomatic venture beyond U.S.
borders, is meeting today with Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo.
There is no specific agenda, Reagan aides say, but there
are a number of pressing issues, including unrest in Cen
tral America and U.S.-Mexican fishing rights, that are
likely to be raised during the highly unusual and brief pre
inaugural trip.
The president-elect spent the weekend at his hillside
home in Pacific Palisades reviewing briefing materials,
his aides reported.

He will fly today morning to El Paso, Texas, aboard a
U.S. Air Force DC-9 jet and will be greeted by Lopez
Portillo at the Cordova International Bridge, spanning the
Rio Grande, at noon Mountain Standard Time.
Cut in transit subsidies urged
Washington — Advisers to President-elect Ronald Re
agan are recommending that federal transportation sub
sidies be slashed, but any such cuts are sure to unleash
loud complaints from politically powerful interest groups.
Transportation Secretary-designate Drew Lewis was a
member of the citizen task force that recommended the
cuts. He likely will be asked about them when he faces Sen
ate confirmation hearings on Wednesday.
Since portions of the task force's confidential recom
mendations have been made public, interest groups have
scurried to sound out Lewis to see how many of the recom
mendations his Transportation Department will pursue.
A group of mayors raised serious concern recently in a
meeting with Lewis over proposed cuts in federal money
for mass transit and to a lesser degree about a recommen
dation that new interstate highways in urban areas not be
completed.
The task force, headed by former Transportation Secre
tary Claude Brinegar, now a senior vice president at Union
Oil Corp., concluded there has been too much government
spending on mass transit. "The overall level of the pro
gram can be reduced significantly."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair and mild through tomorrow with patchy fog
nights and mornings. Cool nights with lows in the 40s and
30s in some outlying sections. Highs in the 60s. Light
winds.

San Salvador, El Salvador — Unidentified gunmen as
sassinated two American lawyers and a high-ranking
Salvadoran government official, a month after the murder
of four American missionaries brought an official protest
from the U.S. government.
The president of the ruling civilian-military junta, Jose
Napoleon Duarte. said "an exhaustive investigation will
be made" into the slayings late Saturday of Mark David
Pearlman, 42, Michael Peter Hammer, 44, and the
Salvadoran president of the Agrarian Transformation In
stitute, Jose Rodolfo Viera, 40.

Police spokesmen in this Central American nation said
special units have been assigned to the case but that there
were no leads to the identity of two gunmen who walked
into the Sheraton Hotel restaurant here shortly before
midnight Saturday and shot the men to death at a table
where they were having coffee.
No one claimed responsibility for the killings.
Carter seeks reduced pay hikes
Washington - The federal government's 1 million
clerks, scientists, lawyers and other white-collar civil ser
vants would get a 5.5 percent raise next October — their
smallest pay hike in years — under a sharply revised
budget President Jimmy Carter will send Congress later
this month.
Carter's final budget also will propose a raise in excess
of 9 percent for military personnel, who normally get the
same raises as U.S. civilian workers.
Federal workers, whose pay raises each October are
based on recommendations of the president, got a 9.1
percent increase last year. Carter budget aides had ori
ginally settled on a recommendation of 8.7 percent for gov
ernment workers next October, and a 9.25 percent adjust
ment for the military.
The decision to trim that raise for white-collar workers
was a last-minute attempt to cut some red ink from
Carter's final budget recommendation. Each 1 percent in
crease in federal pay costs around $500 million, so the
change would trim more than $1.5 billion from budget esti
mates for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
'Yorkshire Ripper' to be arraigned
Leeds, England — Authorities said a man arrested for
questioning in the "Yorkshire Ripper" reign of murder in

northern Kngland would be arraigned today "on a serious
charge" and that they were delighted with developments
in their five-year manhunt.
• We are absolutely delighted, totally delighted, with the
developments at this stage," said Chief Constable Ronald
liregorv of the West Yorkshire police.
Gregory said the man in custody is in his 30s, is married
and came from Bradford, where three of the 13 women be
lieved to be victims of the brutal Ripper were murdered.
He would not give the man's name nor say what the charge
is.
Gregory said the man was arrested on Friday by Shef
field police in the neighboring South Yorkshire police dis
trict for questioning in the theft of auto license plates.
The authorities' announcement of the developments
was a major turn in the hunt for the "Yorkshire Ripper,"
which has seen police question 200,000 people, search
30.000 houses and check 180,000 vehicles. Their search
yielded details on the killer — down to his occupation and
blood type — but never his identity.
Reagan to meet with Mexican leader
Los Angeles — President-elect Ronald Reagan, on his
first post-election diplomatic venture beyond U.S.
borders, is meeting today with Mexican President Jose
Lopez Portillo.
There is no specific agenda, Reagan aides say, but there
are a number of pressing issues, including unrest in Cen
tral America and U.S.-Mexican fishing rights, that are
likely to be raised during the highly unusual and brief pre
inaugural trip.
The president-elect spent the weekend at his hillside
home in Pacific Palisades reviewing briefing materials,
his aides reported.

He will fly today morning to El Paso, Texas, aboard a
U.S. Air Force DC-9 jet and will be greeted by Lopez
Portillo at the Cordova International Bridge, spanning the
Rio Grande, at noon Mountain Standard Time.
Cut in transit subsidies urged
Washington — Advisers to President-elect Ronald Re
agan are recommending that federal transportation sub
sidies be slashed, but any such cuts are sure to unleash
loud complaints from politically powerful interest groups.
Transportation Secretary-designate Drew Lewis was a
member of the citizen task force that recommended the
cuts. He likely will be asked about them when he faces Sen
ate confirmation hearings on Wednesday.
Since portions of the task force's confidential recom
mendations have been made public, interest groups have
scurried to sound out Lewis to see how many of the recom
mendations his Transportation Department will pursue.
A group of mayors raised serious concern recently in a
meeting with Lewis over proposed cuts in federal money
for mass transit and to a lesser degree about a recommen
dation that new interstate highways in urban areas not be
completed.
The task force, headed by former Transportation Secre
tary Claude Brinegar, now a senior vice president at Union
Oil Corp., concluded there has been too much government
spending on mass transit. "The overall level of the pro
gram can be reduced significantly."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair and mild through tomorrow with patchy fog
nights and mornings. Cool nights with lows in the 40s and
30s in some outlying sections. Highs in the 60s. Light
winds.

Israeli cabinet remains near collapse
Jerusalem— The Israeli Cabinet, ignoring calls for its
resignation, staved off collapse yesterday by agreeing to
compromise on teachers' pay raises but remained in seri
ous trouble.
The government rallied to the side of Interior Minister
Yosef Burg who faces allegations he put a stop to police
investigation of his ministry.
The Cabinet set up a committee of ministers to study the
pay issue, resolving what had appeared Saturday to be an
irreconcilable dispute over pay raises for Israel's 58,000
teachers.
The move gives the government of Prime Minister Men
achem Begin a temporary reprieve from what is seen as
the strongest political challenge of his three years in of
fice. Begin s term expires next November.
But the teacher crisis, coupled with a storm of public in
dignation over the firing of Israel's police chief in the
midst of a probe into allegations of high-level corruption,
appeared to push Begin s government closer than ever to
collapse.
