# Mammals cloned by Swiss researchers

From the Daily wire service!
Toronto — Scientists working at a
Swiss laboratory have developed tech
niques that could be used to clone a
mammal, a feat previously achieved
only in work with plants and lower
animals and in the dreams of fiction
writers.
The advance shows that techniques
for limited cloning of lower animals —
like amphibians — can be applied to a
simple mammal, the mouse, and pos
sibly also to man.
But any immediate benefits of the
work are likely to be limited to im
provements in scientific research, sci
entists said.
Cloning is the process of producing
an individual or individuals which are
genetic carbon copies of some original
individual.
Cloning is used whenever plants are

made to reproduce asexually, as with
a cutting. A decade ago. Dr. John
Gurdon of England showed it was pos
sible to produce clones of a certain
species of frog, an amphibian, by us
ing cells from developing frog em
bryos.
Used with mice
The latest work, to be published in
the January issue of the journal Cell,
shows that methods worked out by
Gurdon and others can be used with
embryos from mice.
Dr. Karl Illmensee at the Univer
sity of Geneva in Switzerland and Dr.
Peter Hoppe of Jackson Laboratory in
Bar Harbor, Maine, began by taking
cell nuclei from the cells of 4-dav-old
embryos from various mice. The cell
nucleus contains the chromosomes
that carry the genetic information for
a living being.

The nuclei was then injected into
newlv fertilized mouse eggs and the
resident nuclei removed.
The result, after hundreds of trans
plants, was three living mice, two
females and a male, which were ap
parently genetically identical to the
original embryos from which the
donor nuclei were removed.
One scientist who worked on the
project but who asked not to be identi
fied said that the work could not be
considered true cloning since the
three mice were not genetically iden
tical to each other. He said the project
should properly be considered a cell
nucleus transplant because the ori
ginal embryo is destroyed in the proc
ess and multiple copies are not repro
duced.
But other scientists said that Il
lmensee and Hoppe, in later but as yet
unpublished experiments, have been

able to achieve multiple copies of
mice from the same embryo, a feat
that would be closer to the popular no
tion of cloning.
The work is of limited commercial
benefit since only cells from the very
early stages of embryonic develop
ment can be used.
"In cloning, you would want to pro
duce copies of some individual which
is known to be very good," said Dr.
Davor Solter, a developmental
biologist working on related questions
at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia.
He was interviewed by telephone yes
terday.
"For example, if you had a very
good ( milk-producing) cow, you might
want to clone it. But if you could only
use cells from an embryo, you would
never know whether the cow would be
any good," he said.

Selective Service
Registration
Starting today and continuing
throughout this week, men born in 1962
are expected to register with the
Selective Service. Registration forms
are obtainable at U.S. post offices.
Also, men born in 1963 are expected to
register within 30 days of their 18th
birthdays. Further information may
be obtained from the Selective Service
at (202 ) 724-0790 or the draft informa
tion hotline at (415) 493-4857.
New Staffer Orientation
Orientation meetings will be held
for all people interested in working at
the Daily. The meetings will be tomor
row at 1 p.m. and Wed. at 2:30 p.m. No
prior experience is necessary.
Night Editing Workshop
A night editing workshop will be
held this Wed. at 4:30 p.m. at theDaily
Fundamentals of layout, headline
writing and Daily style will be dis

cussed. All interested in night editing
should attend. Night staffers particu
larly are encouraged.
Staff Lunch
There will be a noon lunch meeting
for all members of the Daily staff this
Thursday.
Appointments
Marion Lewenstein, adjunct pro
fessor of communication at Stanford,
has been named the outstanding jour
nalism teacher in the state at the four
year University level by the California
