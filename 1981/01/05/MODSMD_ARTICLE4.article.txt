# Hoover fellow named as Reagan's policy assistant
## 
### Samuel Howe 
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution here, has been
named as President-elect Ronald Re
agan's assistant for policy develop
ment.
His appointment to the key post did
not come as a surprise, as he served as
domestic issues adviser in both the
1976 and 1980 Reagan campaigns and
has gained a reputation as one of Re
agan's most trusted advisers on na
tional affairs.
Anderson, who is on leave from the
Hoover, has been a strong supporter of
the all-volunteer military program,
opposing the draft registration law
which he says will "increase the
chances that our reserve forces will be
left in limbo, at a time when we need
to strengthen them most ... it would
in time lead to a new military draft."
Anderson has also said that Ameri
ca has almost won the so-called "war
on poverty" but in so doing has
created "a new caste of Americans —
people free from basic wants but
almost totally dependent on the state,
with little hope or prospects of break
ing free."
He has thus advocated a welfare re
form program which would emphasize
"need-only" approaches and work re
quirements and also remove "fraud,
administrative error, or unnecessary
and overbilled services."
He has also said, as has the presi
dent-elect, that responsibility for wel
fare should be shifted, where possible,
from the national government to state
and local governments and private
groups.
"A comprehensive welfare-reform
program that hewed to these basic
principles could go far toward restor
ing equity and efficiency to our wel
fare system," claims Anderson, who
in all probability would be the chief
architect of such a program.
Anderson, who served as director of
research and as a special assistant to
President Richard Nixon, has said
that the "dismal failure" of the na
tional welfare system is a "myth.
There are many things wrong but in
terms of essentials, in terms of the key
goals it was set up to accomplish, it
has been a smashing, total success."
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, who is chair of the department,
said yesterday that he "strongly dis
agreed " with Anderson's assertion.

"1 have always reacted to that kind
of argument that someone ought to
rush that news to East Palo Alto or the
South Bronx, to the places where the
working poor are facing severe eco
nomic distress."
Anderson, who could not be reached
for comment in Washington yesteday,
has argued that the proliferation of
welfare programs has led to "the
almost complete destruction of work
incentives for the poor on welfare.
Why should someone work 40 hours a
week for say. $8000 when it would be
possible to not work at all, say, for
$6000''
' People on welfare may be poor,
but they are not fools," he said recent
ly
On armed forces issues, Anderson
has advocated the strengthening of the
reserves rather than relying on the
draft.
"Anderson deserves credit more
than any other single person for adop
tion of the volunteer military pro
gram." said Hoover Institution direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell.
Anderson says that the country
should "take steps to encourage more
people to join the reserves and, for
those already serving, to reenlist.
These steps should include improved
recruiting efforts, competitive levels
of pay, reenlistment bonuses, and im
proved management of our current re
serve forces."
A graduate of Dartmouth College,
Anderson, who is 45, did masters work
at Dartmouth in engineer ing and busi
ness, and received a Ph.D. in in
dustrial management from MIT An
expansion of his dissertation led to the
publication, in 1964, of his widely read
book The Federal Bulldozer: A
Critical Analysis of Urban Renewal,
1949-61.
He has also taught at the Columbia
Business School and done work at the
Joint Center for Urban Studies in
Cambridge.
Another scholar with ties to the
Hoover Institution, Richard Allen,
was named as Reagan's assisstant for
national security affairs Dec. 23. He
edited the Institution's Yearbook on
International Communism from 1966

that the "dismal failure" of the na
tional welfare system is a "myth.
There are many things wrong but in
terms of essentials, in terms of the key
goals it was set up to accomplish, it
has been a smashing, total success."
Political Science Prof. John Man
ley, who is chair of the department,
said yesterday that he "strongly dis
agreed " with Anderson's assertion.

"1 have always reacted to that kind
of argument that someone ought to
rush that news to East Palo Alto or the
South Bronx, to the places where the
working poor are facing severe eco
nomic distress."
Anderson, who could not be reached
for comment in Washington yesteday,
has argued that the proliferation of
welfare programs has led to "the
almost complete destruction of work
incentives for the poor on welfare.
Why should someone work 40 hours a
week for say. $8000 when it would be
possible to not work at all, say, for
$6000''
' People on welfare may be poor,
but they are not fools," he said recent

On armed forces issues, Anderson
has advocated the strengthening of the
reserves rather than relying on the
draft.
"Anderson deserves credit more
than any other single person for adop
tion of the volunteer military pro
gram." said Hoover Institution direc
tor W. Glenn Campbell.
Anderson says that the country
should "take steps to encourage more
people to join the reserves and, for
those already serving, to reenlist.
These steps should include improved
recruiting efforts, competitive levels
of pay, reenlistment bonuses, and im
proved management of our current re
serve forces."
A graduate of Dartmouth College,
Anderson, who is 45, did masters work
at Dartmouth in engineer ing and busi
ness, and received a Ph.D. in in
dustrial management from MIT An
expansion of his dissertation led to the
publication, in 1964, of his widely read
book The Federal Bulldozer: A
Critical Analysis of Urban Renewal,
1949-61.
He has also taught at the Columbia
Business School and done work at the
Joint Center for Urban Studies in
Cambridge.
Another scholar with ties to the
Hoover Institution, Richard Allen,
was named as Reagan's assisstant for
national security affairs Dec. 23. He
edited the Institution's Yearbook on
International Communism from 1966
to 1968.
Hoover director Campbell said he
was "very pleased and proud" about
both appointments.
Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution here, has been
named as President-elect Ronald Re
agan's assistant for policy develop
ment.
His appointment to the key post did
not come as a surprise, as he served as
domestic issues adviser in both the
1976 and 1980 Reagan campaigns and
has gained a reputation as one of Re
agan's most trusted advisers on na
tional affairs.
Anderson, who is on leave from the
Hoover, has been a strong supporter of
the all-volunteer military program,
opposing the draft registration law
which he says will "increase the
chances that our reserve forces will be
left in limbo, at a time when we need
to strengthen them most ... it would
in time lead to a new military draft."
Anderson has also said that Ameri
ca has almost won the so-called "war
on poverty" but in so doing has
created "a new caste of Americans —
people free from basic wants but
almost totally dependent on the state,
with little hope or prospects of break
ing free."
He has thus advocated a welfare re
form program which would emphasize
"need-only" approaches and work re
quirements and also remove "fraud,
administrative error, or unnecessary
and overbilled services."
He has also said, as has the presi
dent-elect, that responsibility for wel
fare should be shifted, where possible,
from the national government to state
and local governments and private
groups.
"A comprehensive welfare-reform
program that hewed to these basic
principles could go far toward restor
ing equity and efficiency to our wel
fare system," claims Anderson, who
in all probability would be the chief
architect of such a program.
Anderson, who served as director of
research and as a special assistant to
President Richard Nixon, has said
that the "dismal failure" of the na
tional welfare system is a "myth.
There are many things wrong but in
terms of essentials, in terms of the key
goals it was set up to accomplish, it
has been a smashing, total success."
