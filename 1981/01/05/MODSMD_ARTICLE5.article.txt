# 1980 grad wins Rhodes award
## 
### Brad Crystal 
After an undergraduate academic
performance that included winning a
Harry S. Truman Scholarship, Phi
Beta Kappa honors and the J. E.
Wallace Sterling Award, 1980 Stanford
graduate Peter Stamos last month
took an encore, earning his most pres
tigious honor to date: a Rhodes schol
arship for two years of graduate study
at Oxford University in England.
Stamos, who majored in political
science and economics, is Stanford's
46th Rhodes scholar. He is now a first
year student at Harvard Law School.
He was one of 32 American college
students selected from a field of more
than 1000 applicants. The award car
ries a $16,800 stipend over two years.
One of Stamos' most outstanding
accomplishments here was becoming
the first undergraduate to serve as a
teaching assistant (T.A.) in the politi
cal science department.
At Oxford, Stamos said he will take
a broad interdisciplinary program
emphasizing philosophy, political sci
ence and economics.
Upon his return, Stamos plans to
finish up his law degree and to obtain a
master's in public policy at the John
F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard.
His career aspirations include prac
ticing law, teaching and possibly run
ning for political office.
Reached by telephone at his family
home in Westlake, Calif., Stamos said
he was "overjoyed'' and "humbly sur
prised" by his selection which he
called a "an awe-inspiring opportuni
ty."
The award is "just a tremendous
blessing and a privilege," which car
ries "a large sense of responsibility I
hope I can fulfill," he said.
Praising the applicants with whom
he competed, Stamos said he was im
pressed "not only by their academic
credentials but also by their tremen
dous sense of idealism."
It was exactly this idealism, this
"sense of public purpose" that Stamos
tried to convey in the rigorous in
terview process.
For example when Stamos, an ad
vocate of gun control, was asked what
he would do if he were running for
elected office in a state whose consti
tuents opposed gun control he replied
he would "face the threat of losing"
rather than sacrifice a personal con

viction.
Other questions were not as easily
tackled, according to Stamos. "A lot
of the questions were unanswerable.
They just wanted to see your reac
tion," he said.
As an example of one of the more
"outrageous" questions, Stamos cited
an interviewer who asked him "What
was the second most popular spec
tator sport in 1896?"
Stamos was not entirely unfamiliar
with the interview process â€” it was
the second year he applied.
For the 1980 competition Stamos
said he took a fresh approach, treating
the scholarship as "an opportunity to
help me fulfill my duties to society as
opposed to my personal ambitions."
Although Stamos said he can fore
see a time in the future when he would
like to run for Congress he does not
"see myself becoming a politican
right away."
The reason? "Ambition and politics
can be a dangerous combination. Peo
ple forget the idealism that brought
them into the fray."
Stamos' exposure to politics has not
been confined to an academic setting.
In the spring of 1979, Stamos worked
in the Washington office of Con
gressman Paul "Pete" McCloskey.
He organized an early student support
group for Sen Edward Kennedy's (D-

Mass.) campaign, later working for
President Jimmy Carter's reelection.
A graduate of Newbury Park High
School, Stamos was a competitive
swimmer. He was a T. A. in water polo
for two quarters here and last year he
was a housing associate (R.A.) in
Toyon.
In the fall of 1978 when he was chair
of the ASSU Senate, Stamos worked
with McCloskey to organize a campus
campaign against the execution of Ali
Bhutto a former Pakistani premier.
While this effort failed, Stamos
"learned a lot from his defeat," ac
cording to political science Prof.
Hubert Marshall.
Marshall, whom Stamos describes
as his academic "mentor," said he
was "delighted" to hear that Stamos
was selected.
"It seems to me he deserves it real
ly several times over," Marshall said.
When Stamos was a T.A. for Poli.
Sci. 1, Marshall said he received the
most favorable student evaluations of
any T.A. in the past 15 years.
The Rhodes Scholarships were es
tablished in 1902 by the will of Cecil
Rhodes, the British philanthropist and
colonial entrepreneur in southern
Africa, for whom Rhodesia (now Zim
babwe) was named. Rhodes hoped the
scholarships would contribute to
world peace.
