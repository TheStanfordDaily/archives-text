## Watt stirs controversy in Senate 
### Los Angeles Times 
Washington — The Senate
hearings on the confirmation of
James Watt as secretary of in
terior are certain to provide a
shootout between environmen
. tal groups and Western cham
pions of state and individual
rights who are fed up with what
they call overregulation of
Western resources by bureau
crats in Washington.
The hearings before the Sen
ate Energy and Natural Re
sources Committee, opening
Wednesday, will test the resolve
of the Sagebrush Rebellion
against the increasingly sophis
ticated political clout of or
ganizations such as the Sierra
Club and the Wilderness Socie
ty.
The confirmation hearings
are certain to abound with buzz
words from both sides, with
Watt and his friends denouncing
"no-growthers" and "obstruc
tionists" while the environmen
talists insist the secretary of in
terior must be the steward of
the nation's parks and wild
lands and must stand at the
gates to ward off the "plunder
ing developers."
The environmentalists have
already fired the opening shot
by providing reporters with
documents that they contend
show that Watt's Mountain
States Legal Foundation vio

lated Internal Revenue Service
guidelines for its tax-exempt
status.
Conservative contributions
• The Sierra Club contends that
the conservative public-interest
law firm founded by Watt in
Denver three ye&rs ago has re
ceived contributions from or
ganizations that benefited from
the legal action the foundation
took, ostensibly on behalf of the
public at large.
The organizations identified
by the Sierra Club include the
Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas As
sociation, Associated General
Contractors of Wyoming and the
Montana Power Co.
So far, there has been little
focus on Watt himself or his
credentials for the job, which is
being relinquished by former
Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who
has been considered, along with
President Jimmy Carter, as an
ally of the environmental
groups.
Watt, 42, is described by a
friend as "a real Westerner," a
product of the high plains of
eastern Wyoming who received
his law degree from the Univer
sity of Wyoming in 1962. But he
also is no stranger to Washing
ton. working here in the 1960s as
an aide to then-Sen. Milward
Simpson, (R-Wyo.), father of
the current senator, Alan Sim
pson. (R-Wyo). From 1969
through 1975 he was an Interior
Department official, and from
1975 to 1977 he served as a mem
ber of the old Federal Power
Commission.
What rankles many of Watt's
critics, his friends say, is that he
successfully used the tools de
veloped by the liberal public-in
terest law firms, which often
have supported environmen
talists, to battle for con
servative causes involving the
management of the West's land
and water resources.
To pick such a person to be

secretary of interior, the en
vironmentalists have said, is
akin to letting the fox guard the
hen house.
But a defender. Michael Hor
owitz. said, "He has made a
very substantial contribution in
founding an alternate form of
public-interest law firms that
show that there are two sides to
many of these public-interest
cases."
Few specifics
Since his nomination by
Ronald Reagan on Dec. 22, Watt
has said little that would in
dicate what sort of specific de
cisions he would make as a
member of the Cabinet. He did
firmly align himself with the so
called Sagebrush Rebellion,
which stands for returning to
the states, or to private own
ership, millions of acres of fed
eral land in the West. Watt also
says he believes that the goals of
the rebellion can be achieved
without a massive turnover of
land ownership, but by the fed
eral land managers "learning to
become good neighbors" with
Western ranchers, miners,
energy producers and the like.
There is no question of Watt's
credentials as a political con
servative. He and Reagan seem
to be in close concert on a
number of issues such as ac
celerated leasing of Western
lands for coal mining and of off
shore waters for oil and gas de
velopment.
Further, Watt is much more
likely to pursue those con
servative goals than did many of
his predecessors as secretary in
Republican administrations,
who often compromised and ac
commodated their views to
those of conservationists in en
vironmental organizations.
Watt stressed to reporters
that his six years in the Depart
ment of Interior was split be
tween three years in an arm of
the department that is viewed

as pro-development and three in
another arm that is viewed as
preservationist, the Bureau of
Outdoor Recreation, which
Watt directed.
Arbiter has major impact
In fact, the secretary is the
arbiter of a number of Interior
agencies with conflicting in
terests and competing consti
tuencies. Although future de
cisions of the secretary will
carry major impact on the pub
lic domain in the West, there is
no expectation, for instance,
that there will be an unmaking
of existing parks or wilderness
areas. The main difference is
expected to be a new emphasis
on the multiple-use concept of
public land, which is mandated
by Congress for much of the
area managed by the Depart
ment of Interior.
This may emerge as a new ad
vantage for the cattleman leas
ing federal grazing land, the oil
developer who wants to drill on
land being studied for possible
wilderness classification and
the energy companies seeeking
less stringent strip-mining re
quirements.
Some of the major California
issues that Watt faces deal with
expanded leasing of coastal wa
ters for oil and gas develop
ment: protection programs for
Lake Tahoe, the Big Sur coast
and parts of the Orange County
coast; whether to build Auburn
Dam, and the future of water de
velopment, including construc
tion of the controversial Per
ipheral Canal around the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta and
enforcement of the 160-acre lim
it on federal water projects.
How effective Watt is may be
determined by how well he can
articulate his, and Reagan's,
programs in Washington circles
— "in terms, for example,
which the media will not
caricature," Horowitz said.

Washington — The Senate
hearings on the confirmation of
James Watt as secretary of in
terior are certain to provide a
shootout between environmen
. tal groups and Western cham
pions of state and individual
rights who are fed up with what
they call overregulation of
Western resources by bureau
crats in Washington.
The hearings before the Sen
ate Energy and Natural Re
sources Committee, opening
Wednesday, will test the resolve
of the Sagebrush Rebellion
against the increasingly sophis
ticated political clout of or
ganizations such as the Sierra
Club and the Wilderness Socie
ty.
The confirmation hearings
are certain to abound with buzz
words from both sides, with
Watt and his friends denouncing
"no-growthers" and "obstruc
tionists" while the environmen
talists insist the secretary of in
terior must be the steward of
the nation's parks and wild
lands and must stand at the
gates to ward off the "plunder
ing developers."
The environmentalists have
already fired the opening shot
by providing reporters with
documents that they contend
show that Watt's Mountain
States Legal Foundation vio

lated Internal Revenue Service
guidelines for its tax-exempt
status.
Conservative contributions
• The Sierra Club contends that
the conservative public-interest
law firm founded by Watt in
Denver three ye&rs ago has re
ceived contributions from or
ganizations that benefited from
the legal action the foundation
took, ostensibly on behalf of the
public at large.
The organizations identified
by the Sierra Club include the
Rocky Mountain Oil and Gas As
sociation, Associated General
Contractors of Wyoming and the
Montana Power Co.
So far, there has been little
focus on Watt himself or his
credentials for the job, which is
being relinquished by former
Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus, who
has been considered, along with
President Jimmy Carter, as an
ally of the environmental
groups.
Watt, 42, is described by a
friend as "a real Westerner," a
product of the high plains of
eastern Wyoming who received
his law degree from the Univer
sity of Wyoming in 1962. But he
also is no stranger to Washing
ton. working here in the 1960s as
an aide to then-Sen. Milward
Simpson, (R-Wyo.), father of
the current senator, Alan Sim
pson. (R-Wyo). From 1969
through 1975 he was an Interior
Department official, and from
1975 to 1977 he served as a mem
ber of the old Federal Power
Commission.
What rankles many of Watt's
critics, his friends say, is that he
successfully used the tools de
veloped by the liberal public-in
terest law firms, which often
have supported environmen
talists, to battle for con
servative causes involving the
management of the West's land
and water resources.
To pick such a person to be

secretary of interior, the en
vironmentalists have said, is
akin to letting the fox guard the
hen house.
But a defender. Michael Hor
owitz. said, "He has made a
very substantial contribution in
founding an alternate form of
public-interest law firms that
show that there are two sides to
many of these public-interest
cases."
Few specifics
Since his nomination by
Ronald Reagan on Dec. 22, Watt
has said little that would in
dicate what sort of specific de
cisions he would make as a
member of the Cabinet. He did
firmly align himself with the so
called Sagebrush Rebellion,
which stands for returning to
the states, or to private own
ership, millions of acres of fed
eral land in the West. Watt also
says he believes that the goals of
the rebellion can be achieved
without a massive turnover of
land ownership, but by the fed
eral land managers "learning to
become good neighbors" with
Western ranchers, miners,
energy producers and the like.
There is no question of Watt's
credentials as a political con
servative. He and Reagan seem
to be in close concert on a
number of issues such as ac
celerated leasing of Western
lands for coal mining and of off
shore waters for oil and gas de
velopment.
Further, Watt is much more
likely to pursue those con
servative goals than did many of
his predecessors as secretary in
Republican administrations,
who often compromised and ac
commodated their views to
those of conservationists in en
vironmental organizations.
Watt stressed to reporters
that his six years in the Depart
ment of Interior was split be
tween three years in an arm of
the department that is viewed

as pro-development and three in
another arm that is viewed as
preservationist, the Bureau of
Outdoor Recreation, which
Watt directed.
Arbiter has major impact
In fact, the secretary is the
arbiter of a number of Interior
agencies with conflicting in
terests and competing consti
tuencies. Although future de
cisions of the secretary will
carry major impact on the pub
lic domain in the West, there is
no expectation, for instance,
that there will be an unmaking
of existing parks or wilderness
areas. The main difference is
expected to be a new emphasis
on the multiple-use concept of
public land, which is mandated
by Congress for much of the
area managed by the Depart
ment of Interior.
This may emerge as a new ad
vantage for the cattleman leas
ing federal grazing land, the oil
developer who wants to drill on
land being studied for possible
wilderness classification and
the energy companies seeeking
less stringent strip-mining re
quirements.
Some of the major California
issues that Watt faces deal with
expanded leasing of coastal wa
ters for oil and gas develop
ment: protection programs for
Lake Tahoe, the Big Sur coast
and parts of the Orange County
coast; whether to build Auburn
Dam, and the future of water de
velopment, including construc
tion of the controversial Per
ipheral Canal around the Sacra
mento-San Joaquin Delta and
enforcement of the 160-acre lim
it on federal water projects.
