### Los Angeles Times 
North Pole, Alaska — Con Miller opened the
mailbags and dumped several hundred letters
on the table, all addressed: "Santa Claus,
North Pole."
"We will be getting letters for another week
or two from kids all over America and through
out the world," Miller said with a sigh.
"Half the letters are from boys and girls
thanking Santa for Christmas gifts. The other
half are from kids complaining they didn't get
what they wanted."
Miller. 67, received more than 300,000 letters
from October through Christmas. The letters
were filled with gift requests from all 50 states
and from as many foreign countries.
"Post offices all over America and all over
the world know there is a North Pole, Alaska.
The post offices ship the Santa. North Pole,
mail up here," said Miller, North Pole's of
ficial Santa Claus.
Information operators check with the Alas
ka information number and learn, yes, there is
a North Pole and, yes, there is a listing for San
ta Claus at North Pole.
"That's how we get the Santa Claus phone
calls."
"You can imagine the hell parents of a kid
will raise when they get the phone bill for a
long-distance call to North Pole."
North Pole is a town of 800 persons about 130
miles south of the Arctic Circle.
Besides an official Santa Claus, it has a
North Pole mayor. North Pole police chief,
North Pole fire chief. North Pole high school
with a North Pole swimming pool and a North
Pole elementary school.

City Hall is at 200 Snowman Lane. Even
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer has a street
named in his honor.
' North Pole was incorporated in 1953 and
Miller served as its mayor for the first 17
years He and his wife ran the post office until
recently.
"From the time we first got up here. Nell
and I would answer Santa Claus letters that re
ally tugged at your heartstrings," Miller re
called.
"Every year several letters to Santa come
from boys and girls who write, if only their
mommy, daddy or babv brother or sister could
be brought back to life.
"Or letters like. Will you make my daddy
come home 0 He's staying with some other lady
this Christmas.' Or letters saying that 'Mom
my told me Santa won't be coming to our house
this year because we're too poor.'
"It's awfully hard to answer some of those
letters."
Miller says he and his wife sent replies to the
most deserving letters they received before
Christmas. This year they responded to 10,000
of the more than 300,000 children who wrote.
"It has become such a big job just taking
care of the mail (that) we send out 15 different
Xeroxed replies." Miller said.
Bon Davis was North Pole's first settler in
1946 when he took out a homestead.
"Bon called the placed North Pole, hoping
the name would attract toy manufacturers,"
explained Carleta (Toosie) Lewis, 46. North
Pole's mayor for the last five years.
"We're still waiting for the toy factories,"
she said with a laugh.
