### Washington Post 
Washington — President Jimmy Carter is
leaving President-elect Ronald Reagan
with a record-high peacetime military
budget of $196.4 billion for the coming fiscal
year, administration officials said Satur
day.
That total is the amount the president in
tends to request from Congress, not spend,
and constitutes a $25 billion increase over
this year's $171.4 billion. The $171.4 billion
for fiscal 1981 includes Carter's imminent
request for $6.2 billion in supplemental
funds and $5.1 billion for military construc
tion.
Without allowing for inflation, the new to
tal for fiscal 1982 — the budget year starting
Oct. 1,1981 — represents a 14.6 percent hike
over fiscal 1981. But inflation will melt this
increase down to around 4.6 percent, the so
called "real"increase.
If the new president were to accept the
recommendations of some conservatives
and increase defense budgets by 7 percent a
year, after allowing for inflation, and if in
flation stayed at 10 percent annually, a fis
cal 1982 budget of $200 billion would be
pushed up to $376 billion by fiscal 1986. The
five-year total would come to $1.4 trillion.
Cut domestic programs
Reagan will be pressured by con
servatives in Congress and elsewhere to

outdo the latest Carter defense budget,
further jeopardizing the president-elect's
stated intent to trim the federal budget and
improve the national economy.
To keep his economic game plan from
being shredded, Reagan would have to off
set, at least in part, any big increases in de
fense spending with cuts in domestic pro
grams, including ones popular with con
servatives.
Although increasing the defense budget a
percentage point to placate conservatives
may not sound like much, a 1 percent in
crease in a $200 billion defense budget would
cost $2 billion, or more than enough to run
the District of Columbia for an entire year.
(District Mayor Marion Barry is seeking a
total of $1.5 billion for fiscal 1982).
Yet that same $2 billion would not buy
much in the way of super-weapons. One
Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier, without its
planes, costs more than $2 billion, and a sin
gle Trident submarine armed with missiles
is running just about $2 billion.
Carter's final defense budget provides
money for the new MX land missile, cruise
missiles to be launched from bombers,
more Navy warships. Army XMI tanks,
Marine equipment pre-positioned in the In
dian Ocean theater and research on laser
"zap guns" for space warfare. But more
than half the nearly $200 billion budget is
earmarked for the care and feeding of sol

diers and other personnel costs. Another big
slice is devoted to making the military bet
ter prepared to fight by buying the spare
parts needed to keep planes flying and ships
steaming.
More new weapons
Reagan, by his own pledges and those in
the Republican platform he endorsed, is
obliged to do more than all that. His party's
platform called for a new bomber, an air de
fense system, a permanent fleet of warships
in the Indian Ocean, faster production of
aircraft and a 600-ship Navy, among other
things. -
Campaign rhetoric
Pentagon executives, in a series of exit in
terviews, said they hoped Reagan would not
feel bound by campaign rhetoric. Other
wise. they contended, the new adminis
tration would be spending more and getting
less in terms of real national security.
"They should set aside the campaign
rhetoric, ours and theirs," advised Defense
Secretary Harold Brown. "They should look
at our program. They should look at alter
native programs and make their own de
cisions."
He cautioned the new team at the Pen
tagon against getting hamstrung the same
way by campaign rhetoric. "I hope they'll
say things look a lot better from the inside,
and huge increases are not required."

leaving President-elect Ronald Reagan
with a record-high peacetime military
budget of $196.4 billion for the coming fiscal
year, administration officials said Satur
day.
That total is the amount the president in
tends to request from Congress, not spend,
and constitutes a $25 billion increase over
this year's $171.4 billion. The $171.4 billion
for fiscal 1981 includes Carter's imminent
request for $6.2 billion in supplemental
funds and $5.1 billion for military construc
tion.
Without allowing for inflation, the new to
tal for fiscal 1982 — the budget year starting
Oct. 1,1981 — represents a 14.6 percent hike
over fiscal 1981. But inflation will melt this
increase down to around 4.6 percent, the so
called "real"increase.
If the new president were to accept the
recommendations of some conservatives
and increase defense budgets by 7 percent a
year, after allowing for inflation, and if in
flation stayed at 10 percent annually, a fis
cal 1982 budget of $200 billion would be
pushed up to $376 billion by fiscal 1986. The
five-year total would come to $1.4 trillion.
Cut domestic programs
Reagan will be pressured by con
servatives in Congress and elsewhere to

outdo the latest Carter defense budget,
further jeopardizing the president-elect's
stated intent to trim the federal budget and
improve the national economy.
To keep his economic game plan from
being shredded, Reagan would have to off
set, at least in part, any big increases in de
fense spending with cuts in domestic pro
grams, including ones popular with con
servatives.
Although increasing the defense budget a
percentage point to placate conservatives
may not sound like much, a 1 percent in
crease in a $200 billion defense budget would
cost $2 billion, or more than enough to run
the District of Columbia for an entire year.
(District Mayor Marion Barry is seeking a
total of $1.5 billion for fiscal 1982).
Yet that same $2 billion would not buy
much in the way of super-weapons. One
Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier, without its
planes, costs more than $2 billion, and a sin
gle Trident submarine armed with missiles
is running just about $2 billion.
Carter's final defense budget provides
money for the new MX land missile, cruise
missiles to be launched from bombers,
more Navy warships. Army XMI tanks,
Marine equipment pre-positioned in the In
dian Ocean theater and research on laser
"zap guns" for space warfare. But more
than half the nearly $200 billion budget is
earmarked for the care and feeding of sol

diers and other personnel costs. Another big
slice is devoted to making the military bet
ter prepared to fight by buying the spare
parts needed to keep planes flying and ships
steaming.
More new weapons
Reagan, by his own pledges and those in
the Republican platform he endorsed, is
obliged to do more than all that. His party's
platform called for a new bomber, an air de
fense system, a permanent fleet of warships
in the Indian Ocean, faster production of
aircraft and a 600-ship Navy, among other
things. -
Campaign rhetoric
Pentagon executives, in a series of exit in
terviews, said they hoped Reagan would not
feel bound by campaign rhetoric. Other
wise. they contended, the new adminis
tration would be spending more and getting
less in terms of real national security.
"They should set aside the campaign
rhetoric, ours and theirs," advised Defense
Secretary Harold Brown. "They should look
at our program. They should look at alter
native programs and make their own de
cisions."
He cautioned the new team at the Pen
tagon against getting hamstrung the same
way by campaign rhetoric. "I hope they'll
say things look a lot better from the inside,
and huge increases are not required."
