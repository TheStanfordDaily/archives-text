Technical entrepreneurs are brillant, creative, and expect to become
financially independent. Since 1968, scientists and engineers from
diverse disciplines, with or without prior business experience, have
created—and now own—four of our affiliated firms. Eight more are
planned for operation by 1984. Scientists and engineers interested in
developing and owning high technology firms are invited to call Dr.
Stephen S. Leavitt at (415) 548-4100.
