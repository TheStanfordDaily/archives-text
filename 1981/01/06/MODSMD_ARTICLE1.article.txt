# Protests occur across the country

Washington — In the face of pro
tests across the country, a Supreme
Court challenge and the opposition of
President-elect Ronald Reagan, the
Selective Service yesterday began
registering teen-agers born in 1962 for
a possible future military draft.
Sixteen demonstrators were ar
rested for conducting a sit-in and
blocking entry to the draft regis
tration office in the federal building in
Boston, while another 40 protesters
clogging the lobby chanted, "One.
two, three, four, we don't want your
macho war!"
Anti-draft protesters vandalized
three Los Angeles area post offices by
jamming toothpicks and pieces of
wood into door locks before the ap
pearance of draft registrants. Sign
carrying pickets gathered in bitter
cold outside post offices or federal
buildings in Louisville, Ky., Milwau
kee, Toledo, Ohio, and many other
cities.
Plans for rallies, picketing, news
conferences and distribution of anti
draft leaflets outside post office regis
tration sites were reported in other
cities, from Phoenix. Ariz., to New
York.
One registered
A half-dozen pickets carried signs
reading "No Blood For Oil" and
"Don't Sign Your Life Away" outside
the main post office in San Francisco.

Inside, only one teen-ager had regis
tered in the first two hours. In New
York, about 200 persons — most of
them teen-agers — picketed the block
long General Post Office shouting.
"Hell No. We Won't Go," and then
headed for a Times Square rally.
In several cities, young men were
urged by draft opponents to register as
conscientious objectors, or under pro
test.
"I didn't register and I won't go if
I'm drafted," said Pablo Huffsteter,
19. one of about 500 persons who at
tended a protest rally Sunday in Los
Angeles' Mac Arthur Park, scene of
anti-war demonstrations a decade
ago.
Under a draft registration plan in
itiated by President Jimmy Carter in
December 1979, after the Soviet in
tervention in Afghanistan, and ap
proved by Congress, young men who
were born in 1962 and who will turn 19
this year are required to register
through Saturday.
Previous registrants
In the first such registration, held
last July, 3.7 million of the 3.9 million
eligible young men born in 1960 and
1961 have signed up. If there is a simi
lar turnout this week, nearly all of the
1.9 million men born in 1962 will reg
ister.
After this week, males will be re
quired to register within 30 days of

their 18th birthdays

Even though the military draft ex
pired in 1973, after U.S. disengage
ment from Vietnam. Carter proposed
registration as a means of increasing
military readiness. The Selective Ser
vice savs registration would reduce by
four weeks the time required to draft
100,000 men in an emergency.
But during his election campaign.
Reagan opposed peacetime draft reg
istration as a "meaningless gesture"
that would save little time and would
limit registrants' personal freedom.
