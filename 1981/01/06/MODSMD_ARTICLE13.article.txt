## Scorsese creates a brilliantly unlikeable film 
### Steve Vineberg 
Kanirin Hull opens and closes with a slow
motion ballet: the famous middle-weight
.lake La Motta (Rober De Niro). clad in a
hooded leopard-skin robe, springs about the
ring with such inhuman grace that what we
are watching seems like the bizarre ritual of
some huge, powerful animal Later, director
Martin Scorsese shows us theother side of this
bull: trapped in a jail cell (where he has been
thrown on a charge of corrupting minors in his
nightclub*. Jake butts his head repeatedly
against a wall
Scorsese and De Niro have done something
very strange in this movie: they have created
a hero who does not respond on any level to our
attempts to locate him on the human scale
.lake is impenetrable.
In a new. fleshy nose. Robert De Niro seems
transformed; his eyes are deeper and
sharper, and in his headgear, working out at
the gym. he is a monster. The film is a
flashback, so we get to see what Jake will turn
into from the very beginning — a huge, puffy
faced. straight-angled hulk whose inner parts
have all been pushed out like damaged tin —
but in Jake's youth, he has slick wavy hair and
pointed sideburns and he looks dangerous in
an exotic Mexican way In the ring he has a
square-jawed immovability that is terrifying:
outside it he is obsessive, silently lethal. When
he sees Vickie (Cathy Moriartv). a full,
luscious blonde, in a crowded club he follows
her outside, stalking her; his sexual drive
seems as inexorable as that of a great, beau

tiful beast. When they are married, his
jealousy of her parallels his earlier sexual
monomania, and he stalks her again
Jake is related to the other characters De
Niro has played in Scorsese movies — Johnny
Boy. the Mafia runner in Mean Street* : Trav

Doyle in New York. Neu York: they are ail
disturbing and finally, we think, probably psy
chotic. But he plays each one differently
Jake's deadly passion seems to be lodged in
the corner of his right eye. and he has a new
kind of physical power for a De Niro charac
ter he may dance like an enchanted beast but
he attacks with the geometrically balanced
strength of a Mack truck
The major difference, however, is in De
Niro's refusal to draw us in. to make Jake ap

leads him to smash that face, to destroy it for

What De Niro and Scorsese — and Paul
Schrader and Mardik Martin, who wrote the
screenplay — do not tell us is why Jake re
sponds in this particular physical way to what
angers and obsesses him. or indeed what

what is the cause in nature that has
made these hard hearts '
If De Niro opened Jake up to us a little
more, this would be a great American per

movie this year; these two have a
camaraderie that recalls Harvey Keitel and
De Niro in Mean Streets. We can sense what
they must have been like as kids together:
Jake aloof and in charge. Joey jabbing and
daring, trying to belie his much smaller size.
They avoid any physical show of affection so
clearly and so unyieldingly that much later in
the film, when Jake tries to effect a reconcil
iation with Joey after years of separation and
thrusts his arms around him. the moment is
intensely painful When Scorsese is at work
with actors, he achieves a naturalism that is

so complete that they seem to be possessed
and the performances actually move beyond
naturalism (He also draws a fine small per
formance out of Nicholas Celasante. who
plays a Mafia boss.)
But what he does with Cathy Moriartv —
and to a lesser extent with Frank Vincent, who
plays Salvy. a friend of Joey's who flirts with
Vickie — is most unusual: we see them only

through Jake's eyes. It's as though
Shakespeare had portrayed Desdemona and
Cassio only as Othello came to see them after
lago had planted the poison in his brain Wide
eyed. with her beautiful hair held back in a
Fave Rnierson snood. Cathy Moriarty has a
poutv lasciviousness that promises danger,
and her voice is deep and airless. Her sexuali
ty is indistinguishable from Jake's perception
of it. But since Scorsese never allows us to
come close to Vickie, we can't figure out why
she stays with Jake, who is such an un
mitigated sonofabitch. for as long as she does:

since .lake sees her a duplicitous and promis
cuous. so do we. and we can't believe that she
really loves him
Hatfinu Hull is a great piece of filmmaking,
and it is a powerhouse. But on every level
Scorsese throws obstacles in our path that
keep us from becoming involved with these
characters. Michael Chapman has shot the
film in hallucinatory black and white, and
Scorsese uses close-ups so large that they dis
tort the faces. In the fight scenes, the lights,
the signs announcing each round, the ropes,
the microphone seem to be floating, and the
cigar smoke that hangs over the room and the
flash of cameras exist as characters in the
scene equal to the boxers. The clicking of
those cameras sounds like shattering glass
and when, in the climactic fight. Sugar Ray
Robinson's fist connects with La Motta's face,
what we see and hear suggests electrocution
No one has ever stylized violence in this
way before, and one wants to applaud
Scorsese — but at the same time his brilliant
manipulation of the visual and aural elements
of filmmaking is distancing. The period recre
ation — which, like that of New York. New
York, is filtered through a consciousness fed
on the movies of the 1940s — is seamless,
perfect — and almost pristine in consequence.
Raging Hull is all about passion, vet in some
ultimate and important way the passion never
reaches us. even when Jake's blood splatters
the spectators at his last fight. As much as I
admire this movie, I have to confess that I
don't like it verv much
