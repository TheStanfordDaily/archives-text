# Henry directs an unlikeable bomb

### Steve Vineberg 
Perhaps it is unwise to pre
dict how one will respond to a
new comedy — especially in a
year that has been full of pleas
ant surprises like I Ised Cars and
Flash (iordon and Hopscotch —
but I really looked forward to
First Family. It has half of the
funniest people in America in its
cast: Bob Newhart as bumbling
President Link, elected by a
slim majority even after the ac
cidental deaths of his oppo
nents; Madeline Kahn as his tip
pling wife; Gilda Radner as his
daughter Gloria, a virgin by her
parents' command whose sex
ual frustration is turning her
into a mental nymphomaniac;
Bob Dishy as ineffectual Vice
President Slackley; Rip Torn as
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, whose given name, prom
isingly, is Randy; Harvey
Korman as the Ambassador to
the U.N.; Austin Pendleton as
Alexander Gray, the Presiden
tial Translator; Fred Willard as
Febbleman, the Presidential
Assistant. The surprise in this
picture is that so many talented
comics appear to so little
purpose.
Buck Henry, who wrote the
script and directed (and plays
two brief roles), probably con
ceived the movie in terms of
character, but it hasn't been
worked out in that way. The
first fifteen minutes are tan
talizing: even though the roles
are far from original (Shackley,
for instance, is merely a new in
carnation of Vice President
Throttlebottom from Of Thee /

Sinn), they are juicily sug
gestive, and a few of the per
formers make good entrances.
Bob Dishv smiles like a grat
ified infant when he is handed a
souvenir presidential pen:
Radner does her big-kid-with
glands routine; Korman
couches the Ambassador's ra
cism in plumply civil tones;
and. best of all, Kahn is at the
top of her form. Her lips pursed,
her hair puncutated by a tidy
pillbox hat. she is a parody of
every phony church lady and re
ceptionist and schoolteacher
we've ever met — a loony Nurse
Hatched. She seems terribly
proud of her station, but her
wandering eyes give her away:
she seems to be searching for
the next remark she will have to
make, the next reaction she will
have to show. She sweats to
keep up with every conversa
tion, yet she seems supremely
unaware of how fatuous she is;
indispensable to no one (and a
particular pain to her husband),
she thrusts herself into the
midst of social and political
rough spots as if she were ac
tually capable of smoothing
them out.
The problem with First Fami
ly is not that Madeline Kahn and
the other actors cease to be fun
ny, but that their roles are not
developed. The movie turns out
to be a series of gags predicated
on non-character situations,
most of them involving a trip
that the President and his fami
ly take to a newly independent
African country called Upper
Gorm. (It mav be a rule of

thumb for home-grown Ameri
can comedy that it falls apart
when it is forced to travel to ex
otic shores: The In-Lairs was
nearly done in by the scenes that
took place in a banana republic.
Woody Allen's Bananas could
be the exception that proves the
rule.)
There are other problems,
too. Some of the conceits of the
film sound funnier when one de
scribes them afterwards than
they actually are — like the de
sire of the dictator of Upper
Gorm (John Hancock) to import
a community of middle class
white Americans so that the
natives will have a minority to
oppress. One can guess that eve
ryone on the set must have
laughed himself sick over that
idea, but it seems sour in the ex
ecution, and Henry must have
sensed, because he dropped the
gag before the end. Other bits —
like the "entertainment" at the
Upper Gormese feast, which
turns out to be a hip black stand
up comic telling antique jokes in
a dialect we don't understand —
should work but are poorly filled
out.
Many of Henry's best gags
are visual, and he isn't the di
rector to do them justice. He
doesn't always put the camera
in the best spot, and he doesn't
know when to hold things back
and when to let us in on them.
For example, he builds up to a
shot of the gargantuan vegeta
bles grown in imported Upper
Gormese fertilizer, but the sus
pense is meaningless, because
we've alreadv seen a similar

image in the African section of
the movie.
Henry does know how to make
a movie look professional, but in
a comedy that cries out for out
rageous, sloppy life, visual care
is not a virtue.
There is one priceless mo
ment, however, that is all Buck
Henry's. When Pendleton, as
the newly appointed translator,
is introduced to Newhart's
staff, they are all dressed for
the holiday costume banquet
from which they have been
pulled for this special con
ference. It is almost worth the
trouble to see Bob Dishy
dressed as the Easter Bunny
and Rip Torn as a pumpkin It is
a pity that this early scene has
to go such a long way.

pense is meaningless, because
we've alreadv seen a similar

image in the African section of
the movie.
Henry does know how to make
a movie look professional, but in
a comedy that cries out for out
rageous, sloppy life, visual care
is not a virtue.
There is one priceless mo
ment, however, that is all Buck
Henry's. When Pendleton, as
the newly appointed translator,
is introduced to Newhart's
staff, they are all dressed for
the holiday costume banquet
from which they have been
pulled for this special con
ference. It is almost worth the
trouble to see Bob Dishy
dressed as the Easter Bunny
and Rip Torn as a pumpkin It is
a pity that this early scene has
to go such a long way.


Buck Henry (left) and BobNewhart: who's to blame when movies get out of bounds?

Perhaps it is unwise to pre
dict how one will respond to a
new comedy — especially in a
year that has been full of pleas
ant surprises like I Ised Cars and
Flash (iordon and Hopscotch —
but I really looked forward to
First Family. It has half of the
funniest people in America in its
cast: Bob Newhart as bumbling
President Link, elected by a
slim majority even after the ac
cidental deaths of his oppo
nents; Madeline Kahn as his tip
pling wife; Gilda Radner as his
daughter Gloria, a virgin by her
parents' command whose sex
ual frustration is turning her
into a mental nymphomaniac;
Bob Dishy as ineffectual Vice
President Slackley; Rip Torn as
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, whose given name, prom
isingly, is Randy; Harvey
Korman as the Ambassador to
the U.N.; Austin Pendleton as
Alexander Gray, the Presiden
tial Translator; Fred Willard as
Febbleman, the Presidential
Assistant. The surprise in this
picture is that so many talented
comics appear to so little
purpose.
Buck Henry, who wrote the
script and directed (and plays
two brief roles), probably con
ceived the movie in terms of
character, but it hasn't been
worked out in that way. The
first fifteen minutes are tan
talizing: even though the roles
are far from original (Shackley,
for instance, is merely a new in
carnation of Vice President
Throttlebottom from Of Thee /

Sinn), they are juicily sug
gestive, and a few of the per
formers make good entrances.
Bob Dishv smiles like a grat
ified infant when he is handed a
souvenir presidential pen:
Radner does her big-kid-with
glands routine; Korman
couches the Ambassador's ra
cism in plumply civil tones;
and. best of all, Kahn is at the
top of her form. Her lips pursed,
her hair puncutated by a tidy
pillbox hat. she is a parody of
every phony church lady and re
ceptionist and schoolteacher
we've ever met — a loony Nurse
Hatched. She seems terribly
proud of her station, but her
wandering eyes give her away:
she seems to be searching for
the next remark she will have to
make, the next reaction she will
have to show. She sweats to
keep up with every conversa
tion, yet she seems supremely
unaware of how fatuous she is;
indispensable to no one (and a
particular pain to her husband),
she thrusts herself into the
midst of social and political
rough spots as if she were ac
tually capable of smoothing
them out.
The problem with First Fami
ly is not that Madeline Kahn and
the other actors cease to be fun
ny, but that their roles are not
developed. The movie turns out
to be a series of gags predicated
on non-character situations,
most of them involving a trip
that the President and his fami
ly take to a newly independent
African country called Upper
Gorm. (It mav be a rule of

thumb for home-grown Ameri
can comedy that it falls apart
when it is forced to travel to ex
otic shores: The In-Lairs was
nearly done in by the scenes that
took place in a banana republic.
Woody Allen's Bananas could
be the exception that proves the
rule.)
There are other problems,
too. Some of the conceits of the
film sound funnier when one de
scribes them afterwards than
they actually are — like the de
sire of the dictator of Upper
Gorm (John Hancock) to import
a community of middle class
white Americans so that the
natives will have a minority to
oppress. One can guess that eve
ryone on the set must have
laughed himself sick over that
idea, but it seems sour in the ex
ecution, and Henry must have
sensed, because he dropped the
gag before the end. Other bits —
like the "entertainment" at the
Upper Gormese feast, which
turns out to be a hip black stand
up comic telling antique jokes in
a dialect we don't understand —
should work but are poorly filled
out.
Many of Henry's best gags
are visual, and he isn't the di
rector to do them justice. He
doesn't always put the camera
in the best spot, and he doesn't
know when to hold things back
and when to let us in on them.
For example, he builds up to a
shot of the gargantuan vegeta
bles grown in imported Upper
Gormese fertilizer, but the sus
pense is meaningless, because
we've alreadv seen a similar

image in the African section of
the movie.
