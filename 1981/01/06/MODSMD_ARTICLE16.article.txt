# Plasmatics blow things up and play loud instruments
## 
### Charles Buckley 
Anyone leaving last Friday night's Plasmatics
show at the Keystone Palo Alto had to be wonder
ing whatever happened to the days when it was
considered demonic for Elvis to shake his hips.
Wendi Williams, the group's lead singer, had done
a great deal more than just shaking, rattling, and
rolling; in fact, after Friday night's performance,
it can be said that the small suburban nightclub
where Williams let it go for over an hour will prob
ably never be the same.
Williams, who formerly made her living ap
pearing in live sex shows in New York, had
claimed in a radio interview earlier in the day that
the Plasmatics were an alternative for those
"gagging on apple pie," and her performance Fri
day night was indeed enough to send any bright
eyed American youth with dreams of two cars and
a home in the suburbs into a reevaluation of ide
als. Williams and Plasmatics do not attack con
formity, but rather destroy everything which is
representative of it. . . .
The Plasmatics show began with a film of acon
cert that the group did outdoors back in New York
last year, in which Williams drove a car into a
mass collision on a pier, jumping out just in time
to avoid the totally destructive explosion which
ensued. After the film, the stage was seemingly
set for the appearance of yet another Kiss-like
gimmick band catering to teenage carnal and ag
gressive desires.
What followed, however, was a flood of rock,
sex. and aggression which was far from a gim
mick; the group was simply too thoroughly en
gaged in their vices for one to call what they were
doing gimmicky. Williams began the blitzkrieg by
taking an axe to two electric radios, and then the
music began. Though the group claims that their
music defies classification, the array of two- to
three-minute songs which followed certainly
could be described as punk; there was enough
pushing, shoving, and pogoing in the first few
rows to make many Dead Kennedys' shows look
like child's play.
Throughout the performance, sight told a lot
more than sound. Williams, clad for the first half
of the show in some skimpy gym shorts and a tight
tank top. sported a black mohiawk on the top of her

head to complement her shaved blond head She
must have gotten quite warm during the first half
of the show, because following a very fine in
strumental break near the middle of the five
member band's performance, Williams reap
peared clad in only a pair of briefs with shaving
cream covering the remaining vital parts of her
body. Williams was not, however, just putting on
some kind of cheap peep show: rather, she
seemed to use her sexuality much in the way that
Jim Morrison once used his, bringing out into the
open something which most rock stars have gen
erally chosen just to hint at, or to present in a sub
liminal fashion Her gestures, though indeed not
suitable for television, did not move one away
from the music, but rather along with it.
The show was what one would call a Freudian's
delight, as each dosage of sexual energy was
equally accompanied by a dosage of destructive
energy. After stroking on a rife for a whole song,
Williams eventually would up shooting it and tak
ing care of a row of speakers in doing so. The axe
which she had used to do the radios in also came in
handy for some surgery on a bass drum, while an
electric chainsaw was used to finish off one of the
group's electric guitars. Finally, a television was
brought out on stage, and Williams, who mustn't
like late movies, needed only one swing of the axe
to set off one of the evening's finest explosions and
break the set into pieces. Before Friday night's
show. I was of the opinion that I had spent so much
time next to speakers in clubs and auditoriums
that my ears had become numb to decibels, but
the next day, for the first time in years. I could
still feel my ears ringing.
To get over a Plasmatics show does, in fact,
take a great deal more than just a drive home. It
would be easy to write the group off as some kind
of promotional idea of money-hungry record peo
ple. but when seeing the band live, there simply
exists too much energy to regard them as just an
act. If one wishes to forget aesthetic satisfaction,
lyrical interpretations, and acoustic clearness for
an evening, and instead just to go crazy for a while
with some old rebellious, youthful euphoria, a
Plasmatics show serves as the right place to be;
after all. apple pie can make all of us gag every
now and then.

als. Williams and Plasmatics do not attack con
formity, but rather destroy everything which is
representative of it. . . .
The Plasmatics show began with a film of acon
cert that the group did outdoors back in New York
last year, in which Williams drove a car into a
mass collision on a pier, jumping out just in time
to avoid the totally destructive explosion which
ensued. After the film, the stage was seemingly
set for the appearance of yet another Kiss-like
gimmick band catering to teenage carnal and ag
gressive desires.
What followed, however, was a flood of rock,
sex. and aggression which was far from a gim
mick; the group was simply too thoroughly en
gaged in their vices for one to call what they were
doing gimmicky. Williams began the blitzkrieg by
taking an axe to two electric radios, and then the
music began. Though the group claims that their
music defies classification, the array of two- to
three-minute songs which followed certainly
could be described as punk; there was enough
pushing, shoving, and pogoing in the first few
rows to make many Dead Kennedys' shows look
like child's play.
Throughout the performance, sight told a lot
more than sound. Williams, clad for the first half
of the show in some skimpy gym shorts and a tight
tank top. sported a black mohiawk on the top of her

head to complement her shaved blond head She
must have gotten quite warm during the first half
of the show, because following a very fine in
strumental break near the middle of the five
member band's performance, Williams reap
peared clad in only a pair of briefs with shaving
cream covering the remaining vital parts of her
body. Williams was not, however, just putting on
some kind of cheap peep show: rather, she
seemed to use her sexuality much in the way that
Jim Morrison once used his, bringing out into the
open something which most rock stars have gen
erally chosen just to hint at, or to present in a sub
liminal fashion Her gestures, though indeed not
suitable for television, did not move one away
from the music, but rather along with it.
The show was what one would call a Freudian's
delight, as each dosage of sexual energy was
equally accompanied by a dosage of destructive
energy. After stroking on a rife for a whole song,
Williams eventually would up shooting it and tak
ing care of a row of speakers in doing so. The axe
which she had used to do the radios in also came in
handy for some surgery on a bass drum, while an
electric chainsaw was used to finish off one of the
group's electric guitars. Finally, a television was
brought out on stage, and Williams, who mustn't
like late movies, needed only one swing of the axe
to set off one of the evening's finest explosions and
break the set into pieces. Before Friday night's
show. I was of the opinion that I had spent so much
time next to speakers in clubs and auditoriums
that my ears had become numb to decibels, but
the next day, for the first time in years. I could
still feel my ears ringing.
To get over a Plasmatics show does, in fact,
take a great deal more than just a drive home. It
would be easy to write the group off as some kind
of promotional idea of money-hungry record peo
ple. but when seeing the band live, there simply
exists too much energy to regard them as just an
act. If one wishes to forget aesthetic satisfaction,
lyrical interpretations, and acoustic clearness for
an evening, and instead just to go crazy for a while
with some old rebellious, youthful euphoria, a
Plasmatics show serves as the right place to be;
after all. apple pie can make all of us gag every
now and then.
Anyone leaving last Friday night's Plasmatics
show at the Keystone Palo Alto had to be wonder
ing whatever happened to the days when it was
considered demonic for Elvis to shake his hips.
Wendi Williams, the group's lead singer, had done
a great deal more than just shaking, rattling, and
rolling; in fact, after Friday night's performance,
it can be said that the small suburban nightclub
where Williams let it go for over an hour will prob
ably never be the same.
Williams, who formerly made her living ap
pearing in live sex shows in New York, had
claimed in a radio interview earlier in the day that
the Plasmatics were an alternative for those
"gagging on apple pie," and her performance Fri
day night was indeed enough to send any bright
eyed American youth with dreams of two cars and
a home in the suburbs into a reevaluation of ide
als. Williams and Plasmatics do not attack con
