Thatcher reorganizes Cabinet
London — British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, faced with what may be the make or
break year for her monetarist economic policies and
political future, reshuffled her Cabinet yesterday
night in an apparent attempt to increase its loyalty
to her and improve her government's image-mak
ing
She replaced both her leader of the House of Com
mons and her information chief, who had primary
responsibilities for winning support for the govern
ment's policies in Parliament and the country.
Their posts were combined and given to Francis
Pvm. who had been defense secretary and tangled
with Thatcher's treasury ministers over cuts in the
defense budget.
Pvm was replaced at the Defense Ministry by one
of Thatcher's staunchest Cabinet supporters, John
Nott, who was trade secretary and will now have a
more senior Cabinet position. His job as trade min
ister goes to another strong supporter of Thatcher's
economic policies, John Biffen. who moves up from
number two in the treasury. Still another Thatcher
loyalist. Leon Brittain. now in the Home Office, is
being promoted to Biffen's old job. A number of jun-

ior ministers also were moved.
State Court justice dies
San Francisco — Wiley Manuel, the son of a din
ing-car waiter and a domestic worker who became
the first black on the California Supreme Court, died
of cancer yesterday at the age of 53.
Manuel died at 8 a m at Providence Hospital in
Oakland following a lengthy illness, according to his
sister. Earline Ford
A judicial moderate who had worked for the state
attorney general's office for 23 years, he was ap
pointed to the high court by Gov. Jerry Brown on
Feb. 12.1977. along with Chief Justice Rose Bird, the
first woman to serve on the court,
His death leaves the court's remaining six mem
bers split evenly on the constitutionality of the
state's death penalty law Manuel voted to uphold
that law in a recent 4-3 decision affirming it.
Hostage negotiations continue
Washington — The unexpected transfer of three
American diplomats from the Iranian Foreign Min
istry. where they had been held hostage for 15
months, represents a show of strength by the mili
tants in Tehran and their allies in the Iranian gov-

ernment, U.S. officials said yesterday.
Despite public claims in Tehran that the transfer
of the three signified that Iranian authorities have
taken over control of all 52 hostages. U S officials
who have followed the crisis since November 1979
said that thev have no confidence that this has ac
tually happened or that negotiations to free the
hostages are in any way affected.
Algerian intermediaries in those negotiations
said yesterday in Tehran that they expected a reply
in a few davs to the U.S. counter-proposals delivered
to Iranian authorities last Friday — the day before
the three diplomats were transferred from the for
eign ministry to a secret location, possibly in com
pany with ali the other hostages.
