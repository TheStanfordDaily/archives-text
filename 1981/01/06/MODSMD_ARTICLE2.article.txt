# Rally scheduled tomorrow
## Draft registration begins 
### Samuel Howe 
Aside from the usual complaints
about long lines and full class lists,
there appeared to be no protests dur
ing yesterday's registration for winter
classes here.
But a different registration process
that of national registration for the
military draft — is not receiving such
a sedate response.
With males born in 1962 required to
file their names with the Selective
Service System this week, a number of
local individuals and organizations
have announced meetings and draft
counseling sessions to explore options
for prospective registrants. An anti
registration rally will be held here
tomorrow at noon.
Registration was originally part of
the all-volunteer military program
that was instituted after the draft was
abolished in 1972. Then, in 1975. regis
tration was also abolished.
Registration was approved again by
Congress last May after President
Jimmy Carter requested reinstitution
of the process in the wake of the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in December
1979.
There has been considerable
domestic controversy over the issue,
some arguing for registration as a sign
of a strong American response to
events abroad, others decrying the
process as an unwarranted intrusion
on personal liberties or a step toward
militarism.
A case against registration is cur
rently before the Supreme Court, but a
decision is not expected from that
body before summer. The suit claims
the program is unconstitutional be
cause it discriminates against men.
At the same time, there has been
much debate over the extent of re
sistance to registration among men
born in 1960 and 1961, who were re
quired to register this summer. The
Selective Service has estimated that 7
percent of those required to register
refused to do so, while the Boston

(ilobe reported in August an estimate
of 25 percent, and other estimates
have come in between these two.
Greg Ching. a junior here and an or
ganizer of tomorrow's White Plaza
rally, said. "Non-registration is not
draft evasion It is a way of facing
the draft issue head-on."
The rally, which is sponsored by
Students Against Conscription (SAC),
will feature Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit
priest and national anti-war activist
who was imprisoned for burning draft
records during the Vietnam war. Also

speaking will be Dolores Huerta, first
vice-president of the United Farm
Workers. San Francisco City Super

About 500 Stanford freshmen and a
few other students face registration
this week The failure to do so carries
a maximum penalty of a $10,000 fine
