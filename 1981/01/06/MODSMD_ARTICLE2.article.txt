# Rally scheduled tomorrow
## Draft registration begins 
### Samuel Howe 
Aside from the usual complaints
about long lines and full class lists,
there appeared to be no protests dur
ing yesterday's registration for winter
classes here.
But a different registration process
that of national registration for the
military draft — is not receiving such
a sedate response.
With males born in 1962 required to
file their names with the Selective
Service System this week, a number of
local individuals and organizations
have announced meetings and draft
counseling sessions to explore options
for prospective registrants. An anti
registration rally will be held here
tomorrow at noon.
Registration was originally part of
the all-volunteer military program
that was instituted after the draft was
abolished in 1972. Then, in 1975. regis
tration was also abolished.
Registration was approved again by
Congress last May after President
Jimmy Carter requested reinstitution
of the process in the wake of the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in December
1979.
There has been considerable
domestic controversy over the issue,
some arguing for registration as a sign
of a strong American response to
events abroad, others decrying the
process as an unwarranted intrusion
on personal liberties or a step toward
militarism.
A case against registration is cur
rently before the Supreme Court, but a
decision is not expected from that
body before summer. The suit claims
the program is unconstitutional be
cause it discriminates against men.
At the same time, there has been
much debate over the extent of re
sistance to registration among men
born in 1960 and 1961, who were re
quired to register this summer. The
Selective Service has estimated that 7
percent of those required to register
refused to do so, while the Boston

(ilobe reported in August an estimate
of 25 percent, and other estimates
have come in between these two.
Greg Ching. a junior here and an or
ganizer of tomorrow's White Plaza
rally, said. "Non-registration is not
draft evasion It is a way of facing
the draft issue head-on."
The rally, which is sponsored by
Students Against Conscription (SAC),
will feature Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit
priest and national anti-war activist
who was imprisoned for burning draft
records during the Vietnam war. Also

speaking will be Dolores Huerta, first
vice-president of the United Farm
Workers. San Francisco City Super

About 500 Stanford freshmen and a

ess. One may wait to register until the
last day of the week as a form of pro
test or write that he objects to regis
tration on the form.
A recent U.S. district court ruling
would have allowed men to register
but withhold their social security
number, but the court decision was re
cently stayed for reconsideration,
which means that for the time being it
is illegal to take that action, according
to Michael Miller of the American Civ
il Liberties Union office in San Fran
cisco.
And although non-compliance is il
legal. there is skepticism about the
ability of the government to press
charges on a wide scale. Those who
have been discovered as non-regis
trants will most likely be asked to reg
ister but not prosecuted.
Although SAC has opposed regis
tration. the organization has not ac
tively encouraged people to refuse to
register — it has encouraged "in
formation and personal decisions,"
according to Ching.
Another local organization of "pa
rents. concerned individuals and high
school students" has been formed to
inform men of their options and to
hand out leaflets at post offices in the
area, according to People Against the
Draft member Louise Wilson.
Like SAC, the organization takes no
specific stand on compliance, but does
want to let the potential registrant
know that "he doesn't have to be some
kind of a zombie marching up,'" said
Wilson.
The organization is sponsoring
counseling and discussion each night
this week at a few churches in the
area, and has also sponsored work
shops on various registration-related
activities. Patricia Brandt, student
activities adviser here, will discuss le

gal and personal questions related to
resistance tonight at 6 30 in the Old
Clubhouse
And according to Jim Burklo, mem
ber of a draft counseling network
within Santa Clara County, his or
ganization received "lots of calls"
yesterday from men asking for in
formation Several, he said, claimed
that they would resist the process.
In both the Palo Alto postal district
and at the Stanford post office, em
ployees contacted yesterday said that
figures for the number of registrants
would not be available at any time due
to a postal service order
Last summer, apparently, some
post offices in the country made public
the information but others refused to
do so, prompting the decision to ban
any release of the figures.
President-elect Ronald Reagan
adopted an anti-registration position
during his campaign, saying last May
that "advance registration will do lit
tle to advance our military prepared
ness . . . The Soviets can tell the dif
ference between computer lists of in
experienced young men and new
weapons sytems. a million-man re
serve and an experienced army.
"But perhaps the most fundamental
objection to war is moral. Only in the
most severe national emergency does
the government have a claim to the
mandatory service of its young peo
ple." said Reagan.
Reagan has said that he would
"think very seriously" about
abolishing draft registration but re
cent reports indicate that there is dis
agreement among his advisers, some
arguing that he should keep the regis
tration mechanism in place.
Estimates of the actual amount of
time which advance registration
would save in the case of a national
emergency have varied.

invasion of Afghanistan in December
1979.
There has been considerable
domestic controversy over the issue,
some arguing for registration as a sign
of a strong American response to
events abroad, others decrying the
process as an unwarranted intrusion
on personal liberties or a step toward
militarism.
A case against registration is cur
rently before the Supreme Court, but a
decision is not expected from that
body before summer. The suit claims
the program is unconstitutional be
cause it discriminates against men.
At the same time, there has been
much debate over the extent of re
sistance to registration among men
born in 1960 and 1961, who were re
quired to register this summer. The
Selective Service has estimated that 7
percent of those required to register
refused to do so, while the Boston

(ilobe reported in August an estimate
of 25 percent, and other estimates
have come in between these two.
Greg Ching. a junior here and an or

draft evasion It is a way of facing

The rally, which is sponsored by

last day of the week as a form of pro
test or write that he objects to regis
tration on the form.
A recent U.S. district court ruling
would have allowed men to register
but withhold their social security
number, but the court decision was re
cently stayed for reconsideration,
which means that for the time being it
is illegal to take that action, according
to Michael Miller of the American Civ
il Liberties Union office in San Fran
cisco.
And although non-compliance is il
legal. there is skepticism about the
ability of the government to press
charges on a wide scale. Those who
have been discovered as non-regis
trants will most likely be asked to reg
ister but not prosecuted.
Although SAC has opposed regis
tration. the organization has not ac
tively encouraged people to refuse to
register — it has encouraged "in
formation and personal decisions,"
according to Ching.
Another local organization of "pa
rents. concerned individuals and high
school students" has been formed to
inform men of their options and to
hand out leaflets at post offices in the
area, according to People Against the
Draft member Louise Wilson.
Like SAC, the organization takes no
specific stand on compliance, but does
want to let the potential registrant
know that "he doesn't have to be some
kind of a zombie marching up,'" said
Wilson.
The organization is sponsoring
counseling and discussion each night
this week at a few churches in the
area, and has also sponsored work
shops on various registration-related
activities. Patricia Brandt, student
activities adviser here, will discuss le

gal and personal questions related to
resistance tonight at 6 30 in the Old
Clubhouse
And according to Jim Burklo, mem
ber of a draft counseling network
within Santa Clara County, his or
ganization received "lots of calls"
yesterday from men asking for in
formation Several, he said, claimed
that they would resist the process.
In both the Palo Alto postal district
and at the Stanford post office, em
ployees contacted yesterday said that
figures for the number of registrants
would not be available at any time due
to a postal service order
Last summer, apparently, some
post offices in the country made public
the information but others refused to
do so, prompting the decision to ban
any release of the figures.
President-elect Ronald Reagan
adopted an anti-registration position
during his campaign, saying last May
that "advance registration will do lit

ness . . . The Soviets can tell the dif
ference between computer lists of in
experienced young men and new

serve and an experienced army.
"But perhaps the most fundamental
objection to war is moral. Only in the
most severe national emergency does
the government have a claim to the
mandatory service of its young peo
ple." said Reagan.
Reagan has said that he would
"think very seriously" about
abolishing draft registration but re
cent reports indicate that there is dis
agreement among his advisers, some
arguing that he should keep the regis
tration mechanism in place.
Estimates of the actual amount of
time which advance registration
would save in the case of a national
emergency have varied.
Aside from the usual complaints
about long lines and full class lists,
there appeared to be no protests dur
ing yesterday's registration for winter
classes here.
But a different registration process
that of national registration for the
military draft — is not receiving such
a sedate response.
With males born in 1962 required to
file their names with the Selective
Service System this week, a number of
local individuals and organizations
have announced meetings and draft
counseling sessions to explore options
for prospective registrants. An anti
registration rally will be held here
tomorrow at noon.
Registration was originally part of
the all-volunteer military program
that was instituted after the draft was
abolished in 1972. Then, in 1975. regis
tration was also abolished.
Registration was approved again by
Congress last May after President
Jimmy Carter requested reinstitution
