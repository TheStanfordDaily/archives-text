# Workers tour Bay Area to check for fruit flies
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
San Jose — Agriculture and forestry
workers yesterday began surveying
neighborhoods with heavy infestations
of Mediterranean fruit flies, prepar
ing for a door-to-door battle against
the insect that threatens a $12 billion
agriculture industry.
The workers toured one of several
"hot spots," noting the location of host
fruit trees and alerting residents to
the stripping and spraying operations.
About 500 teenage California Con
servation Corps workers from across
the state will have a day-long training
session today during which they will
be taught to identify and strip fruit af
fected by the pest.
Tomorrow, the workers will leave
their encampment at the Santa Clara
County Fairgrounds to begin the col
lection of host fruit and vegetables.
Officials hope the door-to-door
sweep of trouble spots in a quarantine
area extending across much of Santa
Clara and Alameda counties south of
San Francisco Bay will eliminate the
need for a controversial aerial
spraying with the pesticide Malathion.

The fruit fly, nicknamed the Medf
lv. has been called "the most serious
pest, with regard to fruits and vegeta
bles, in the world" by Shannon Wilson,
an official with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture.
The conservation corps, consisting
of men and women 18 to 23 years old,
will work two six-dav weeks, officials
said, stripping and seizing fruit in San
ta Clara County.
The corps is a 4-year-old organiza
tion that recruits youths for a one-year
hitch to help plant trees, improve pub
lic recreation facilities and help state
officials with emergencies such as
floods and forest fires.
The preliminary survey by agricul
ture officials Monday was partially in
tended to calm residents, officials
said, before corps workers begin strip
ping fruit.
"We're not going to be the
Gestapo," said Don Henry of the state
Department of Food and Agriculture.
"We're not going to march into some
one's yard, saying we're doing this in
the name of the state."
State lawyers said although the law
provides for the seizure of fruit that
can threaten the state's crops, they
are unsure whether the state has the
right to go on private property.
The door-to-door effort will include
spraying the foliage of some trees
with Malathion and spraying the
ground underneath the trees with Fen
thion. an even more potent pesticide
which they hope will destroy any fruit
fly larvae that have fallen to the
ground.
The Medflv is found in Hawaii, and
outbreaks have been reported in areas
with moderate climates, such as Flor
ida and Texas.
A half-dozen experts from areas
that have successfully fought Medfly
infestations will evaluate the success
of the Santa Clara County door-to-door
campaign this month and again in
February before deciding whether to
recommend aerial spraying.
