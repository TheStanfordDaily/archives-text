# Stanford 1980: Kennedy inaugurated, Hoover 'elected'
## 
### 
Editor's note: 1980 was a year filled
with both domestic and interna
tional unrest and change. The year
was one of transition for the na
tion 's political structure, of conflic
ting and unsteady economic fore
casts, and of fruitless waiting for
the 52 American hostages in Iran.
Against this backdrop, the events
of the campus unfolded, some in
fluenced by, and some actually in
fluencing the national and interna
tional scene. We have selected the
local stories that we feel have had
the most impact on Stanford stu
dents and the Stanford communi
ty. For Stanford, too, the year was
one of transition, change, and im
portant developments, as high
lighted below.
Kennedy succeeds Lyman
For the University President's of
fice. the year was one of transition
as Richard Lyman resigned and

provost Donald Kennedy was
selected to be the eighth president
in the Stanford's history.
In January, Lyman was chosen to
be the head of the Rockefeller Foun
dation, and he announced that his
decade-long term as president
would end in mid-summer. He said
the challenges of the foundation and
his belief that Stanford could use
new blood in the president's office
contributed to his decision to leave.
Kennedy was chosen by the Board
of Trustees in the early summer,
and was inaugurated with much
pomp and circumstance at the be
ginning of the Fall term. In his in
augural address before 6000 people
assembled in Frost Amphitheatre,
Kennedy called for a rejuvenation
of the humanities at Stanford, and
for the reestablishment of close ties
between students and their pro
fessors that were damaged in the
strife- torn era of anti-war protests.

Election and the Hoover
The 1980 presidential election
thrust Stanford's Hoover Institu
tion, a conservative enclave in the
midst of the general liberalism of
the University, into national promi
nence as the Republican nominee
for president, Ronald Reagan, re
lied on its scholars to help him for
mulate his campaign policies and
positions.
Reagan's electoral landslide and
subsequent establishment of transi
tion committees drew more Hoover
and Stanford scholars into the poli
cy making process. Martin An
derson. W Glenn Cambell, Milton
Friedman, Thomas Sowell, and
Michael Boskin were among those
involved in the campaign or the
transition.
Recently. Anderson, a senior fel
low at Hoover, was named as Re
agan's assistant for policy develop
ment.
Stanford gets DNA patent
Stanford and the University of
California were awarded the na
tion's first patent for gene-splicing
techniques in early December. The
U.S. patent office made the award
for the genetic technology de
veloped by Stanford's Dr. Stanley
Cohen and Dr. Herbert Boyer of UC-
San Francisco.
The process they developed seven
years ago allows for the transfer of
DNA — the hereditary substance of
living organisms — from one spec
ies of organism to another.
Since the discovery of the techni
ques, genetic recombination re
search has made possible the in
dustrial production of hormones
such as insulin, and interferon, the
new wonder drug' of the medical
science.
A second part of the patent, still
pending before the patent office,
would cover the products that result
from their process. This second pat
ent would be financially lucrative
for the University because of the

value of the process in the prod
uction of rare drugs and chemicals.
Fire chars Storey House
In March, a spectacular three
alarm electrical blaze engulfed
Storey House, an all-female
dormitory on the Row, causing
about $1 million in damage and dis
placing the 39 occupants of the
house
A throng of over 1000 spectators
ringed the building to watch fire
fighters as they battled the blaze for
over two hours. None of the resi
dents were injured by the blaze,
which was blamed on faulty wiring
in the walls of the 80-vear-old struc
ture.
The University community pro
vided an outpouring of support for
the women of Storey House, many

of whom lost most of their personal
possessions due to fire, smoke or
water damage.
Univers ; ty officials have an
nounced that they will rebuild
Storey House on its original loca
tion.
New requirements OKed
For the first time since 1969, in
coming freshmen will be required to
take a course in Western culture,
and they also will face a stiffer set
of distribution requirements The
Faculty Senate voted in January to
implement both requirements, re
placing the system that former
president Richard Lyman called a
"leaky sieve."
Students will be required to take
one course from each of seven cur

ricular areas in addition to a year
long Western Culture series.
I'rof. Ilerg wins Nobel Prize
Medical Prof. Paul Berg became
the tenth member of the current
faculty here to win the Nobel Prize
when he and two others were
granted the award for their work in
the field of recombinant DNA
The Royal Swedish Academy of
Science gave the $212,000 prize to
Berg, Dr Walter Gilbert of
Harvard and Dr, Frederick Sange
of Cambridge Berg received half of
the award.
Berg's research has enabled sci
entists to introduce an isolated gene

Several thousand persons saw the inauguration of Donald Kennedy (shown

k Lyman, moved on to head the Rockefeller Foundation.

Last March, firefighters fought a blaze at Storey House. The fire caused some $1 million in damage, leaving the
house's 39 residents uninjured but homeless.
