## Transitional professorships 
### 
We are all aware of the seri
ous problem of unemployment
that exists among the scholarly.
For every doctor of philosophy
teaching at a college or univer
sity. there are five or six who
have not held and who will never
hold an academic post. Al
though at first glance this prob
lem appears virtually insoluble
given the diminishing demand
for college teachers and the rate
at which new doctorates are
awarded, there is, we must
hope, a way out of the dilemma
that might afford a more
equable distribution of
academic positions.
But what direction should we
take in resolving this problem?
A number of short-sighted indi
viduals have proposed that the
universities cut back their grad
uate programs and enroll fewer
students. In some institutions,
of which Stanford University is
a notable example, graduate
students are even now being
warned on acceptance that
mere attainment of a doctorate
is not a guarantee of em
ployment. A reduction in
academic forces might, of
course, be justified under ex
traordinary circumstances.
Bearing in mind the fundamen
tal social principle that the in
stitution is always more impor
tant than the individual, how
ever. it is evident that we should
take no course that would bring
harm to the university itself.
Rather, what we require is a
system that would permit grad
uate departments to function to
their fullest, a system embody
ing new concepts of the
purposes of seeking a graduate
degree and of what constitutes a
proper academic career. Be
cause of an antiquated
philosophy of education, even
enlightened university adminis
trators are discouraging gradu
ate enrollment. For some il
logical reason, they have acted
upon a notion that should have
been laid to rest long ago — that
the degree of doctor of
philosophy is to be sought so that
one may engage in a scholarly
career of teaching and re
search Having taken this posi
tion. they naturally can see no
alternative to cutting back on
enrollment.
As any perceptive analyst of
our university system soon per
ceives. the key to the shortage
of positions for new graduates
lies in the conservative charac
ter of the tenure system, which
freezes most academic slots for
unconscionably long periods of
time. To make matters worse,
the tenure system is abetted in
its deleterious effect by the long

six-year terms that most assis
tant professors serve before
being denied tenure.
We must seek solutions to our
problem with some mod
ification of the terms of
academic employment that will
allow a more equable distribu
tion of teaching positions. Some
of our more progressive institu
tions have already taken a vital
step in this direction by estab
lishing policies of limited em
ployment of junior faculty: in
structors and assistant pro
fessors are hired on a continual
ly rotating basis with non
renewable contracts not to ex
ceed three years. In the mind of
Thomas Reynolds, president of
Bates College which has
adopted such a policy, this pro
cedure is beneficial both to the
students and the faculty mem
bers concerned.
"As has always been the case
in the teaching profession, a
certain amount of movement is
healthy, both for the individual
and the institution. The in
structor and assistant pro-
provide the constant in
put from the graduate schools
and other colleges that a faculty
simply must have to retain its
vigor. Hut by moving around,
they are also serving their own
interests as well. It is usually to
the advantage of the younger
faculty member to move one or
tico times before he settles
down in tenure."
But this is merely a promis
ing beginning. What institutions
must do is take the next logical
step and eliminate tenure alto
gether. and. once that hurdle
has been crossed, to take the
even more decisive step of hir
ing all faculty on two or three
year contracts without posibili
ty for renewal. Furthermore,
once a person has served as an
assistant professor for two or
three years, he would then be re
quired to surrender all rights
and privileges of the degree of
doctor of philosophy and would
not be permitted to seek another
teaching or research position
In this way. the fundamental
problem of unemployment
among new graduates would be
instantaneously resolved. One
further step is necessary. The
concept of what constitutes an
academic career must be al
tered to fit the new set ot cir
cumstances The attainment of
the degree of doctor of
philosophy and employment in
teaching must come to be
viewed as a transitional phase
in a person's career. After ob
taining the doctorate each
scholar would work as a college
or university teacher for a peri

od not to exceed three years, af
ter which he or she would then
move on to those occupations
coming more and more to be as
sociated with the doctorate;
taxi driving and tending bar, for
example. In recognition of this
altered character of the
academic career, each gradu
ate student would be required to
complete a practicum in a trade
of his or her choice, of which
carpentry, plumbing and hair
dressing might be assumed to be
the most viable alternative, in
order to qualify for the degree.
Those inclined to quibble may
argue that hiring all faculty for
limited three year terms will
destroy the continuity of the uni
versity. However, this is not a
view that need by taken serious
ly. Any disadvantage that might
arise from so rapid a turnover in
faculty will be more than made
up for by the youth and vigor of
those left in teaching. And cer
tainly one major talking point of
such a system is that it will
draw faculty and students
closer together, since both will
be faced with the challenge of
finding employment.
The beauty of the system, of
course, lies in the fact that the
students and faculty will not be
competing with each other for
jobs, since most of the faculty
will be going to work as carpen
ters and journeymen of various
sorts, while the students will be
going into business firms at the
managerial level.
The only individuals who may
suffer serious problems of dis
locaton are the existing tenured
faculty, who have in the large
not been trained for any useful
occupations and who may there
fore be forced into penury after
dismissal. I am confident, how
ever. that they are educable and
can be taught certain minimal
skills. At worst, they might be
organized into a conservation
corps of some kind.
Adoption of the program I
have outlined will permit gradu
ate departments to expand rath
er than curtail their programs.
It will provide every graduate
with a fair chance at teaching in
a college or university before
returning to regular life, a de
cided improvement over the
present deplorable system in
which the graduate must go
directly from graduate school to
tending bar or selling insurance
without experiencing the joy
and fulfillment of serving as a
member of a junior faculty.

must do is take the next logical
step and eliminate tenure alto
gether. and. once that hurdle
has been crossed, to take the
even more decisive step of hir
ing all faculty on two or three
year contracts without posibili
ty for renewal. Furthermore,
once a person has served as an
assistant professor for two or
three years, he would then be re
quired to surrender all rights
and privileges of the degree of
doctor of philosophy and would
not be permitted to seek another
teaching or research position
In this way. the fundamental
problem of unemployment
among new graduates would be
instantaneously resolved. One
further step is necessary. The
concept of what constitutes an
academic career must be al
tered to fit the new set ot cir
cumstances The attainment of
the degree of doctor of
philosophy and employment in
teaching must come to be
viewed as a transitional phase
in a person's career. After ob
taining the doctorate each
scholar would work as a college
or university teacher for a peri

od not to exceed three years, af
ter which he or she would then
move on to those occupations
coming more and more to be as
sociated with the doctorate;
taxi driving and tending bar, for
example. In recognition of this
altered character of the
academic career, each gradu
ate student would be required to
complete a practicum in a trade
of his or her choice, of which
carpentry, plumbing and hair
dressing might be assumed to be
the most viable alternative, in
order to qualify for the degree.
Those inclined to quibble may
argue that hiring all faculty for
limited three year terms will
destroy the continuity of the uni
versity. However, this is not a
view that need by taken serious
ly. Any disadvantage that might
arise from so rapid a turnover in
faculty will be more than made
up for by the youth and vigor of
those left in teaching. And cer
tainly one major talking point of
such a system is that it will
draw faculty and students
closer together, since both will
be faced with the challenge of
finding employment.
The beauty of the system, of
course, lies in the fact that the
students and faculty will not be
competing with each other for
jobs, since most of the faculty
will be going to work as carpen
ters and journeymen of various
sorts, while the students will be
going into business firms at the
managerial level.
The only individuals who may
suffer serious problems of dis
locaton are the existing tenured
faculty, who have in the large
not been trained for any useful
occupations and who may there
fore be forced into penury after
dismissal. I am confident, how
ever. that they are educable and
can be taught certain minimal
skills. At worst, they might be
organized into a conservation
corps of some kind.
Adoption of the program I
have outlined will permit gradu
ate departments to expand rath
er than curtail their programs.
It will provide every graduate
with a fair chance at teaching in
a college or university before
returning to regular life, a de
cided improvement over the
present deplorable system in
which the graduate must go
directly from graduate school to
tending bar or selling insurance
without experiencing the joy
and fulfillment of serving as a
member of a junior faculty.

We are all aware of the seri
ous problem of unemployment
that exists among the scholarly.
For every doctor of philosophy
teaching at a college or univer
sity. there are five or six who
have not held and who will never
hold an academic post. Al
though at first glance this prob
lem appears virtually insoluble
given the diminishing demand
for college teachers and the rate
at which new doctorates are
awarded, there is, we must
hope, a way out of the dilemma
that might afford a more
equable distribution of
academic positions.
But what direction should we
take in resolving this problem?
A number of short-sighted indi
viduals have proposed that the
universities cut back their grad
uate programs and enroll fewer
students. In some institutions,
of which Stanford University is
a notable example, graduate
students are even now being
warned on acceptance that
mere attainment of a doctorate
is not a guarantee of em
ployment. A reduction in
academic forces might, of
course, be justified under ex
traordinary circumstances.
Bearing in mind the fundamen
tal social principle that the in
stitution is always more impor
tant than the individual, how
ever. it is evident that we should
take no course that would bring
harm to the university itself.
Rather, what we require is a
system that would permit grad
uate departments to function to
their fullest, a system embody
ing new concepts of the
purposes of seeking a graduate
degree and of what constitutes a
proper academic career. Be
cause of an antiquated
philosophy of education, even
enlightened university adminis
trators are discouraging gradu
ate enrollment. For some il
logical reason, they have acted
upon a notion that should have
been laid to rest long ago — that
the degree of doctor of
philosophy is to be sought so that
one may engage in a scholarly
career of teaching and re
search Having taken this posi
tion. they naturally can see no
alternative to cutting back on
enrollment.
As any perceptive analyst of
our university system soon per
ceives. the key to the shortage
of positions for new graduates
lies in the conservative charac
ter of the tenure system, which
freezes most academic slots for
unconscionably long periods of
time. To make matters worse,
the tenure system is abetted in
its deleterious effect by the long

six-year terms that most assis
tant professors serve before
being denied tenure.
We must seek solutions to our
problem with some mod
ification of the terms of
academic employment that will
allow a more equable distribu
tion of teaching positions. Some
of our more progressive institu
tions have already taken a vital
step in this direction by estab
lishing policies of limited em
ployment of junior faculty: in
structors and assistant pro
fessors are hired on a continual
ly rotating basis with non
renewable contracts not to ex
ceed three years. In the mind of
Thomas Reynolds, president of
Bates College which has
adopted such a policy, this pro
cedure is beneficial both to the
students and the faculty mem
bers concerned.
"As has always been the case
in the teaching profession, a
certain amount of movement is
healthy, both for the individual
and the institution. The in
structor and assistant pro-
provide the constant in
put from the graduate schools
and other colleges that a faculty
simply must have to retain its
vigor. Hut by moving around,
they are also serving their own
interests as well. It is usually to
the advantage of the younger
faculty member to move one or
tico times before he settles
down in tenure."
