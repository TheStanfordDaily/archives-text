Die for NRA?
The senseless and untimely
death of John Lennon proves
once again the overwhelming
need for adequate gun control.
How many assassinations must
we endure before the apocalyp
tic screams of the National Ri
fle Association are stilled forev
er 9 A society that allows psy
chopaths to own and operate
Saturday Night Specials leaves
a great deal to be desired.
The notion that handguns are
the price we pay for freedom is
disgusting, euphemistic distor
tion of the facts. 1 maintain that
the apocalypse will occur only if
we don't do anything about gun
control. If you weep at John
Lennon's cruel end. 1 would sug
gest you put on a Beatles album
and write your congressman.
Urge your representative, in
the memory of John Lennon and
the thousands of other handgun
victims, to support at the very
minimum limited gun control'
The life you save may be a

friend's, a relative's or your
very own We shall never hear
whatever else Lennon had to of
fer us. A crazed maniac who
never should have owned a
handgun has ended that possi
bility.

Imagine
"What happens is som
ebody comes along with a good
piece of truth. Instead of the
truth's being looked at. the per
son who brought it is look at.
The messenger is worshipped,
instead of the message. "-John
Lennon. Playboy Interview,
1/81
On December 8. 1980, outside
an apartment building in New
York. John Lennon was killed.
Lennon was a pacifist, who em
bodied his philosophy in his
songs. He spoke to several gen
erations through his song
writing, and touched the lives of
many. Now the world mourns
the tragic, senseless, and un

timely death of an inspirational
man.
But tl\e melodies and
messages that John Lennon
brought to the world cannot be
silenced by an assassin's bullet.
Ironically, his vision for the
world is reaching and affecting
more people now, in the wake of
his death. And yet, Lennon
would see this as incongruous:
he did not want to be revered for
himself , rather, he wanted the
messages in his songs to stand
alone for what they contained. If
you found a good piece of truth
in his lyrics, take that truth and
incorporate it within yourself.
The tragedy of the murder in
front of the Dakota on that De
cember night is that the life of a
fellow human being was wrong
fully taken, and that never again
will John Lennon be able to give
the world that advantage of his
perspective, of his perception.
If the death of John Lennon
causes the world to stop, to
ponder, to reflect on its goals,
its path, its ideals, its values;

t hen John Lennon will be speak
ing to us even in his death. In
that spirit, let's remember him
for what he taught us and try to
make the world better for it.
"You may say I'm a dreamer...
But I 'm not the only one. I hope
someday you'll join us, And the
world will live as one. "

Students and now the mem
bers of the Emeritus Faculty of
Stanford enjoy reduced prices
at cultural events such as of
fered by Living Arts, and right
fully so. Stanford alumni and
alumnae who are now over 65
years old would also like to see
these performances at a reason
able price. Is there any good
reason why they should be de
nied this privilege?
