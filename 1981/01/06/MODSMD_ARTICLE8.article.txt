## Perry Beider Really working to eradicate sexism 
### 
At the risk of carrying a good
thing too far, I'd like to add my
two cents to the valuable dis
cussion concerning women,
men, and rape begun by Leah
Halper and Michael Selmi.
Lyn Bowman (Daily, Dec. 5)
suggests that Halper should
spend "more time fulfilling her
own personal physical responsi
bilities" as a means to both de
creasing her risk from assault
and improving her outlook on
the possibility of assault. I
agree with him that fear of rape
is a problem in its own right.
Judging by some of the earlier
columns and letters this quar
ter. it may exact a higher toll
from women in terms of mental
distress and lost opportunities
than the crime itself.
However, each of us has
potentials in many areas, and
few, if any, of us will ever fully
develop them all. Thus Bowman
is arguing that women must al
low their priorities for personal
fulfillment to be dictated by
fear of rape. The whole point of

the women's (and men's) liber
ation movement is not that peo
ple should be forced from the
traditional stereotyped roles
into new pigeonholes, but that
they should be free to choose for
themselves. Bowman is there
fore no more justified in imply
ing that Halper is "lazy" for not
facing up to her physical "re
sponsibilities" than anyone
would be in castigating
Bowman for not practicing
sculpture.
Besides a reduction in the
number of rapes, another thing
that might help reduce the anx
iety of women who do not elect
to master self-defense would be
the adoption by society of a
healthier and more open at
titude toward all aspects of sex.
Though 1 recognize that I'm not
in a position to fully empathize
with rape victims, I wonder if a
saner society couldn't mentally
devalue rape so that it was not
much more traumatic than oth
er assaults or armed robbery
On another point, I think there
was an element of truth in
Michael Selmi's column (Daily,
Nov. 26) that may have been lost
in the generally valid criticisms
made by subsequent con
tributors. It is true that it's im
portant to avoid complacency
and to work to change dis
criminatory institutions to re
flect changed attitudes, but at
the same time I think it's unfair
to ignore, as, for rhetorical
purposes, feminist writers oc
casionally do. the progress that
has taken place.
Mary Wentworth hit it on the
head when she identified "every
person, male or female, who re
fuses to deal with women as au
tonomous individuals" as those
contributing to the problem of
rape. My Stanford experience
leads me to believe that this ap
plies to a fairly small per
centage, and that most people
here expect women to be as in
dependent and three
dimensional as men. And I cer
tainly object to Steve Hansch's
statement (Daily, Dec. 5) that
"It is precisely the derogatory,
even coercive attitude of all the
men in our society which toler

ates...rape." If this were true,
how could he have written the
column?
Finally, I think Leah Halper
made a weak argument in her
most recent columnf Dai/v,
Dec 4) which said. "If I were a
white man...l would be shudder
ing at the Ku Klux Klan's grow
ing appeal...because when con
flicts build, white men as a
group may be held respon
sible." Only lynch mobs or peo
ple blinded by the desire for re
venge could find the KKK repre
sentative of all white men (they
sure don't represent any white

male Jews! hand such emotions
are hardly grounds for moral
action. White men should fight
discrimination not out of fear or
guilt but because it is wrong.
Their responsibility may be
greater because they are closer
to the centers of power and thus
can be more effective in bring
ing change about, but not be
cause of any genetic similar
ities to those on the other side of
the struggle.
