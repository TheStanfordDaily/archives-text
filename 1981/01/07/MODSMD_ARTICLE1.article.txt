# Chrysler may get loan before Carter leaves
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Treasury Secretary
G. William Miller said yesterday it is
possible that the Chrysler loan board
could give conditional approval to new
guaranteed loans for the auto com
pany before the Carter administration
leaves office, but that would require a
rapid agreement on major financial
concessions by Chrysler's employees,
suppliers and creditors.
In private meetings with officials of
Chrysler, the United Auto Workers
and Chrysler's bank creditors. Miller
also said the company must intensify
its efforts to merge with other auto
companies to assure its long-term
future.
A conditional approval would not
permit Chrysler to draw on any of the
$400 million in guaranteed loans it is
seeking to remain solvent, but it would
increase the chances of a favorable
ruling after the Reagan adminis
tration takes office on Jan. 20.
Miller is the only one of the three
voting members of the loan board who
will leave the board Jan. 20. The oth
ers, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker and Comptroller Gen
eral Elmer Staats. will remain and be
joined by Donald Regan, assuming
he is confirmed as Treasury secre
tary.
In the absence of a conditional ap
proval by the current board, the Re
agan administration might feel
obliged to make a complete review of
Chrysler's prospects, delaying the de
livery of the new guaranteed loans,
Chrysler officials say.
At his Senate confirmation hearing
yesterday, Regan sounded a little
more encouraging on the Chrysler is
sue, although he still would not say
whether the Reagan administration
supports more aid for the company.
He called the auto industry "one of the
underpinnings of the economy" and
said its troubles "must be dealt with
on a priority basis."
The Reagan administration opposes
a general policy of bailing out failing
companies, Regan indicated, but he
said Chrysler "is a special situation,"
since Congress already has agreed to
help it.
Miller agreed that Chrysler is in a
desperate financial position but said
his staff's analysis indicates it can
survive for a month or six weeks more
in the absence of the guaranteed loan
funds, disagreeing with estimates by
Chrysler that the end could come this
month unless the loan guarantee is ap
proved.
"It's a matter of judgment," he
said, adding. "I think their cash will
be tight in the next 30 to 45 days." Ap
proval of the loan guarantee is a "day
to-day question."
UAW President Douglas Fraser
said he doesn't believe Chrysler's
problems are "insurmountable." But
the company faces a cash crisis, he
said. "I don't think it's in the far-dis
tant future."
Help from the union?
Fraser, whose union has been asked
by Chrysler to accept a 21-month wage
freeze to save Chrysler some $600 mil
lion in payroll and benefit expenses,
said he agrees the company needs help
from the UAW. "Certainly it's neces

sary. We've crossed the Rubicon on
that one." But just how far the UAW
will go, and what it will demand from
Chrysler in return, will be left to nego
tiations between the company and the
union which begin Wednesday, he
said.
"If we share in the sacrifices re
peatedly, then there has to be a shar
ing in the good times. There has to be a
sharing in the prosperity and the prof
its" if Chrysler recovers, he said.
Fraser and the UAW had been un
willing to negotiate with Chrysler un
til they heard first-hand from Miller
and the loan board that wage con
cessions were essential, and Miller
didn't disappoint them. Reviewing the
Treasury staff's latest assessment of
Chrysler's economic condition. Miller
told the union that the company faces
a financial gap "that must be closed
by concessions." one participant said.
Fraser proposed that the board ap
prove the entire $700 million in unused
loan authority approved by Congress.
Chrysler already has received $800
million.
