# Chrysler may get loan before Carter leaves
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington â€” Treasury Secretary
G. William Miller said yesterday it is
possible that the Chrysler loan board
could give conditional approval to new
guaranteed loans for the auto com
pany before the Carter administration
leaves office, but that would require a
rapid agreement on major financial
concessions by Chrysler's employees,
suppliers and creditors.
In private meetings with officials of
Chrysler, the United Auto Workers
and Chrysler's bank creditors. Miller
also said the company must intensify
its efforts to merge with other auto
companies to assure its long-term
future.
A conditional approval would not
permit Chrysler to draw on any of the
$400 million in guaranteed loans it is
seeking to remain solvent, but it would
increase the chances of a favorable
ruling after the Reagan adminis
tration takes office on Jan. 20.
Miller is the only one of the three
voting members of the loan board who
will leave the board Jan. 20. The oth
ers, Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker and Comptroller Gen
eral Elmer Staats. will remain and be
joined by Donald Regan, assuming
he is confirmed as Treasury secre
tary.
In the absence of a conditional ap
proval by the current board, the Re
agan administration might feel
obliged to make a complete review of
Chrysler's prospects, delaying the de
livery of the new guaranteed loans,
Chrysler officials say.
At his Senate confirmation hearing
yesterday, Regan sounded a little
more encouraging on the Chrysler is
sue, although he still would not say
whether the Reagan administration
supports more aid for the company.
He called the auto industry "one of the
underpinnings of the economy" and
said its troubles "must be dealt with
on a priority basis."
The Reagan administration opposes
a general policy of bailing out failing
companies, Regan indicated, but he
said Chrysler "is a special situation,"
since Congress already has agreed to
help it.
