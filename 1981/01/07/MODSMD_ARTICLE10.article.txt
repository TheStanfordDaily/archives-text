# College admission gets easier
## 
### Washington Post 
Washington— The idea that it's difficult to get
into college is just a myth except for students hop
ing for admission to a small group of well-known
schools, according to a new study by the College
Board.
In the study — which challenges the widely held
belief that gaining college admission is a highly
competitive struggle among students — the board
said that 83 percent of college applications were
accepted across the country in 1978. Almost every
student applying to college, the study suggested,
found one to attend.
The report said that the admissions process
now is becoming a competitive struggle among
the colleges — rather than the students — as re
cruitment drives are stepped up in a static pool of
high school graduates.
The new study is the first nationwide survey
and analysis of college admissions practices ever
conducted, College Board officials said.
During the 19705, the study reported, colleges
said they generally became less selective, admit
ting students whom they earlier would have
turned away. Campus buildings and staffs con
tinued to expand during the decade, while the
number of high school graduates stabilized and a
college education became less attractive because
of soaring tuition costs, particularly at private in
stitutions.
Survey reveals trends
The study was based on information from 1463
of the nation's approximately 2600 accredited col
leges and universities. The survey was conducted
by the College Board and the American Associa
tion of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Of
ficers. The information on trends comes from
questions in the survey form asking colleges to
compare what they were doing in 1978 with what
they did in 1970.
Throughout the country only 8 percent of col
leges reported that they admit a limited number
of their applicants. More than a third take all high

school graduates while the remaining 56 percent
admit well over a majority of applicants, usually
60 to 90 percent, College Board officials said.
Overall, the colleges involved in the study had
2.25 million applications in 1978 and made 1.9 mil
lion offers of admission, producing an 83 percent
acceptance rate. But because many students ap
plied to more than one institution, only 1.3 million
enrolled.
The College Board promised that none of the
colleges involved in the study would be identified
and the report did not name those that are highly
selective. But according to the National College
Databank, published by Peterson's Guides, only
70 colleges across the United States draw more
than half their freshmen from the top 10 percent of
their high school class. Only 26 colleges report
that more than three-quarters of their freshmen
scored over 600 on either the verbal or
mathematics section of the Scholastic Aptitude
Test.
Nationally, according to the report. 34 percent
of colleges said they admitted students with lower
standardized test scores in 1978 than in 1970, while
only 13 percent said test scores had improved.
Some 29 percent said they required fewer courses
in high school, while only 11 percent said their
course requirements had stiffened.
Overall. 23 percent of colleges said they were
less selective now than in 1970, compared with 18
percent that said they were more selective.
Among liberal arts colleges, 32 percent said they
had become less selective, while only 20 percent
said they were more so.
About two-thirds of all colleges said they ac
tively recruit academically talented students, but
58 percent said they recruited athletes and 55
percent said they recruited blacks and other mi
norities. Some 37 percent said they admitted mi
norities even though their grades, test scores and
class ranks were lower than other applicants.
Some 24 percent said they made similar excep
tions for athletes and alumni relatives.

60 to 90 percent, College Board officials said.
Overall, the colleges involved in the study had
2.25 million applications in 1978 and made 1.9 mil
lion offers of admission, producing an 83 percent
acceptance rate. But because many students ap
plied to more than one institution, only 1.3 million
enrolled.
The College Board promised that none of the
colleges involved in the study would be identified
and the report did not name those that are highly
selective. But according to the National College
Databank, published by Peterson's Guides, only
70 colleges across the United States draw more
than half their freshmen from the top 10 percent of
their high school class. Only 26 colleges report
that more than three-quarters of their freshmen
scored over 600 on either the verbal or
mathematics section of the Scholastic Aptitude
Test.
Nationally, according to the report. 34 percent
of colleges said they admitted students with lower
standardized test scores in 1978 than in 1970, while
only 13 percent said test scores had improved.
Some 29 percent said they required fewer courses
in high school, while only 11 percent said their
course requirements had stiffened.
Overall. 23 percent of colleges said they were
less selective now than in 1970, compared with 18
percent that said they were more selective.
Among liberal arts colleges, 32 percent said they
had become less selective, while only 20 percent
said they were more so.
About two-thirds of all colleges said they ac
tively recruit academically talented students, but
58 percent said they recruited athletes and 55
percent said they recruited blacks and other mi
norities. Some 37 percent said they admitted mi
norities even though their grades, test scores and
class ranks were lower than other applicants.
Some 24 percent said they made similar excep
tions for athletes and alumni relatives.
