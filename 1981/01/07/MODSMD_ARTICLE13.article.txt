# First output of Chinese characters by computer
## Computer scientist wins praise for design 
### Phil Fernandez 
A new technique for gener
ating Chinese characters by
computer has been developed by
a visiting scientist from the
Peoples Republic of China
working at the Computer Sci
ence Department here.
The work was done by Tung
Yun-Mei, who based his studies
on work done by Prof. Donald
Knuth of the Computer Science
Department. Tung's program is
the first to allow a computer to
output high quality Chinese

characters.
Earlier this year, Knuth an
nounced his "Metafont" pro
gram, a new method of typeface
and page layout design that has
been described as a printing in
novation equal to that of Guten
berg's movable type. Knuth and
Tung use similar principles of
character design.
Two difficult problems were
solved by Tung. The Chinese use
brushes rather than pens for
writing, making different types
of lines. Also, there are 50.000 to
60.000 Chinese characters, with
6000 to 8000 in daily use. English
uses only 26.
Tung wanted his characters
to be more than just readable.
Chinese writing is an art form,
and Tung wanted his work to be
visually pleasing. Chinese char
acters have a two-dimensional
structure and can be divided
into many subcharacters.
"Whether or not a character
looks nice depends not only on
the niceness of basic strokes;
the structure skeleton is much
more important," Tung said.
The program's goal was to cap
ture the traditional beauty of
Chinese calligraphy.
Indications are that Tung has
succeeded. Although he says he
isn't a "qualified person, the
sample (produced by the com
puter) does appear to look bet
ter than any of (my) hand
writing, so there is good reason
to expect that a more qualified
person will be able to achieve
truly excellent results."
Knuth described Tung as a
modest and "mild mannered"
gentleman, and said he is im
pressed by the computer scien
tist's work. Knuth said it is "re
markable that so much could be
accomplished by one person."
According to Knuth, the most
important aspect of Tung's pro

gram is its adaptability By
varying commands to the com
puter, different styles of the
same character can be created.
Knuth said the new system is
"like a musical score instead of
a recording of a performance."
New and different variations
can be applied to the basic
"score."
Tung. 44. is an associate sci
entist at the Institute for Com
puting Technology of the Chi
nese Academy of Sciences. He
came to Stanford two years ago
as a member of an initial group
of six Chinese scholars to work
at the Computer Science De
partment.
Tung left Stanford to return to
China in November and hopes to
continue work on his program
there He had not seen his wife
and two children — who did not
accompany him — since coming
to Stanford.
It is "not clear how fast (the
Chinese) will use the system,"
Knuth said. China does not have
and use computers "for all but a
small part of what we use them
for," he said
The first application of
Tung's system will probably be
the development of a library of
characters for printing news
papers and books, according to
Knuth. The system will also
progress further at Stanford be
cause a man from Shanghai will
soon be visiting the Computer
Science Department to work
with the hardware — the actual
machinery which prints the
characters.
Knuth has called Tung's work
"a big success for the project
and the (Chinese) culture."

varying commands to the com
puter, different styles of the
same character can be created.
Knuth said the new system is
"like a musical score instead of
a recording of a performance."
New and different variations
can be applied to the basic
"score."
Tung. 44. is an associate sci
entist at the Institute for Com
puting Technology of the Chi
nese Academy of Sciences. He
came to Stanford two years ago
as a member of an initial group
of six Chinese scholars to work
at the Computer Science De
partment.
Tung left Stanford to return to
China in November and hopes to
continue work on his program
there He had not seen his wife
and two children — who did not
accompany him — since coming
to Stanford.
It is "not clear how fast (the
Chinese) will use the system,"
Knuth said. China does not have
and use computers "for all but a
small part of what we use them
for," he said
The first application of
Tung's system will probably be
the development of a library of
characters for printing news
papers and books, according to
Knuth. The system will also
progress further at Stanford be
cause a man from Shanghai will
soon be visiting the Computer
Science Department to work
with the hardware — the actual
machinery which prints the
characters.
Knuth has called Tung's work
"a big success for the project
and the (Chinese) culture."
