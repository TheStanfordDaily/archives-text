## It's never as bad as you think 
### 
Stanford got you down'' Truth is. Stanford gets
everyone down now and then
There is the story about Jane Stanford's final
days on The Farm Being a widower was a very
depressing thing in those days, and without the
Stanford Shopping Center to go to. there were
very few ways in which a respectable single wom
an could spend her time. She could not go to
dances. She could not go to dinners. She could not.
in short, "swing." Mrs. Stanford's despondency
grew for many weeks, and then she had an idea.
The grief stricken woman decided to build a
dance hall in the middle of the Quad
Mrs. Stanford worked tirelessly with the
architects to build the best dance hall in the West.
A great dance hall would allow her to be seen so
cially again, and would possibly put an end to her
depression.
She put in large, colorful windows and watched
with jov as the workmen moved through the front
door.
"This will be the best dance hall in the world."
she thought. "It will cheer me up."
Mrs. Stanford commissioned an artist to con
struct a surpise mosaic on the front facade.
On dedication day. a large sheet covered the
front face of the dance hall. People gathered from
miles around to watch the radiant Mrs. Stanford,
clad in a beautiful dancing dress, unveil her mas
terpiece. She pulled a rope and down came the
sheet. The crowd gasped at what it saw Mrs.
Stanford open-mouthed.
"Oh no." she cried, "I've built a damn
church!"
Actually, it all turned out for the best, since it
was a very nice church, and it did get Mrs. Stan
ford out of the house. But that's not the point of
this storv.

The point of this story is that if you're nbt
careful, depression can build up and make you do
funny things There are many things you can do to
beat depression on The Farm. Here are but a few
of them.
1 Fail your last set of finals? At least you failed
them here You are probably smarter than anyone
at 80 percent of the other colleges in America.
Before you let this depression thing get to be a
habit, take a drive in that big car you were given
for Christmas over to De Anza College People
mess up there, too. But even the ones who get a 4 0
aren't as high up on the social totem pole as you
So smile.
2 Get pass-out drunk If it didn't work for so
many people, it wouldn't be so popular.
3. Go bv LOTS at any time of any evening this
week, unless you have a computer project due.
Whew, what a line!
4 You know that good-looking, athletic, in
telligent and warm person down the hall who
makes you feel so depressed and inferior Herpes.
N'uff said
5. Take any of your roommate's albums and
play them on his stereo at 78. The singers will
sound like mice and you'll laugh and laugh.
6 Put your roommate to sleep with some ether,
skin him. and wait till he wakes up.
7. Call your parents and tell them to send some
money.
8. Join the Daily and write a column.
You know, comes this time of year, it's easy to
let little things build up. It's important to keep
your head, feel good, and spread a little sunshine
wherever you go.
