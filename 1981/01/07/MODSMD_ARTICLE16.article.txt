# The 						Stanford Daily OPINIONS
## Todd Harris A 						Lennon retrospective 
### 
I've heard people complain
that Stanford is too far removed
from the real world, that Stan
ford allows us to live in a fan
tasy land. And on my way home
for vacation, getting ready to
face some reality while starting
to look for a job. I thought to my
self, "Why complain? I mean, if
you want the real world, there's
no reason to be here paying ten
grand a year If you want some
reality, just get off your ass,
quit school, and go downtown
and get yourself a job" — if re
ality is what you want.
That was on my way home. A
few revelations during vacation
affected that attitude some
what : not completely, but some
what.
John Lennon died on Monday,
December 8. We were preparing
for exams and worrying about
papers.
"Did you hear about John
Lennon?"
"Yeah, bummer. Hey, what's
your exam schedule like?"
That seems to be the approx
imate impact that John Len
non's death had on our campus.
Now, perhaps most of us are a
few years too young to really ap
preciate Lennon's significance.
There are probably aren't too
many hard core Beatle fans left
around here. But somehow, this
assassination, which was un
questionably on a par with Rob
ert F. Kennedy's and Martin Lu*
ther King's, managed to pass
nearly unnoticed here at school.
The rest of the country went
into a week's mourning and eve
ry publication that could find a
reason had Lennon's photo
graph on the cover. Over the
next few days the cities of
America and England, as well
as other major cities throughout

the world, held massive, sponta
neous vigils in his honor. And we
here at school took our exams
I don't know what I expected
us to do in retrospect. Just
something, some show of
mourning, grief, respect Al
though the following words
aren't mine — mostly because I
am not mature enought to
articulate such thoughts — they
do hit the feeling we missed.
Writing for Rolling Stone, Scott
Spencer says it all:
His death is everywhere. Like
his life and art. is a unifying
force. The astonishing and . . .
unduplicated characteristic of
his art is that it brought togeth
er people who may have had no
other single thing in common. A
genius like John Lennon can
create a community of hearts
and minds from 10 million sep
arate appetites. Part of the grief
we feel about this murder is our
longing to once more belong to
something larger than
ourselves, to feel our heart beat
in absolute synchrony with
hearts everywhere ... we are
better people because of John
Lennon. And now, when we
need to be better still, and
braver, with a deeper, more en
compassing vision, losing him is
terrifying. It just cuts so deeply.
It's hard to believe our luck has
gotten this bad.
How did this go so unnoticed
here? Second to being dis
traught about the murder
itself. I'm upset with myself
for reacting so passively. May
be what we need is a little more
reality around here. Perhaps we
don't need the day to day hard
ships of most other lives (we
pay plenty not to have to bother
with those for a while). Maybe

we just need to be a little more
in touch with the human com
munity and life in the big city. I
don't want to live it, just touch
it. so we know what jt feels like
later.
