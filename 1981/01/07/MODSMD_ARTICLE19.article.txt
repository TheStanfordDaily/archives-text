## Morality, mechanism, sexual equality 
### 
Steven Hansch's column
(Daily, Dec. 5) gave me cause
for consideration but also left
me in confusion. His use of emo
tional terms such as imbecile,
whine, and fool overshadow the
real point he is trying to make.
The constant use of rape as a
framework by which to discuss
feminist issues is the most strik
ing example of the emo
tionalism in his column.
When the emotionalism is
stripped away, I see no real
point to Hansch's argument. His
statement of the "basic im
morality" of the inequalities
which exist today is a source of
confusion. I am unsure of what
anyone discussing morality
means in the context of our
modern society, which believes
in an impersonal, mvichanistic
universe. Is it not commonly ac
cepted that the universe, the
world, ourselves, and every
thing we do are simply there-

sults of random movements and
collisions of matter, with no gui
dance or purpose?
Based on this, it seems that
the only morality to which one
can appeal is that whatever hap
pens, simply happens. Hansch
demonstrated quite aptly that
bv this standard inequality of
sexes is moral in both under
developed and developed coun
tries today and has been
throughout history.
Even if his assessment of the
situation is deemed to be cor
rect. neither the ends nor the
means of his suggested response
is to be accepted without com
ment. His contention that wom
en make "more reasonable,
competent, and less violent
leaders when given real power"
does not sound particularly en
couraging in light of historical
figures such as Cleopatra of
Egypt and Bloody Mary of Eng
land. or of the contemporary

Jiang Qing of China.
Leaving aside the question of
whether fulfilling Hansch's re
quirements for the equality of
men and women would be good,
I was left with one further ques
tion. It seems that to change our
world from its present state to
this ideal might require adopt
ing some of the very methods
and attitudes which keep our
present state from being the ide
al. Many people have looked at
the world, seen what they con
sidered to be injustice, and have
had the courage to try to change
it. Unfortunately, the zeal for
change often becomes a source
of contempt for those who do not
share in it.
Vladimir Lenin saw op
pression in the government of
Russia, and wished to change it
(as nearly as possible) accord
ing to the ideals of a system
which he saw as offering a bet
ter world. The result was that an

oppressive government which
characteristically dealt with
fears of subversion by destroy
ing its opponents was replaced
by a new government which
characteristically dealt with
fears of subversion by destroy
ing its opponents. This new gov
ernment called itself better be
cause it claimed to be the instru
ment of oppressed people.
With this in mind, I read with
some concern the examples of
fear and hatred in feminist writ
ings and the labeling of the
"cruel and aggresive" com
pared with the "sensitive and
beautiful." Indeed, I wonder
how many times we will look on
the battlefields where human
kind has battled injustice and
oppression and will find that
"We have met the enemy and he
is us."
