# Patients want to see their files

### David Frank 
Fred Student comes to a health,
clinic in his new neighborhood to get a
physical examination. The doctor de
termines that Fred has an irregular
heartbeat.
Fortunately, Fred's previous health
clinic provided him with his medical
records, including the results of past
electrocardiographs. On examination
of the records, the doctor determines
that Fred doesn't need hospi
talization.

News analysis

At Stanford Hospital, and at many
other private California hospitals, pa
tients do not have direct access to
their medical records.
Critics say that preventing direct
access to medical records is
detrimental to health care because re
cords are an invaluable source of in
formation to patients. The argument
is that patients have a right to know
more about their health and that medi
cal records serve no purpose if they
get buried in a physician's files.
Others, however, claim that allow
ing greater access to medical records
is too costly and time-constiming.
Health facilities become compelled to
provide copies of original records to
almost all patients who want them and
doctors must take time to explain re
cords and are more liable to be sued
over misunderstandings.
Some California statutes support
hospital and clinic ownership of medi
cal records. The California Adminis
trative Code for health facilities and
referral agencies states: "The medi
cal record, including X-ray films, is
the property of the hospital and is
maintained for the benefit of the pa
tient, the medical staff and the hospi
tal."
But the California Evidence Code
entitles a person to inspect or copy
medical records prior to a legal pro
ceeding. In such instances, an at
torney is entitled to inspect and copy
specified records on behalf of a pa
tient within five days after presenting
the patient's written authorization.
The 1977 California Information
Practices Act complicates the picture
by requiring — at least for public
health care institutions — protection
of a patient's records from un
authorized release to third parties.
However, a doctor from both
private and public health institutions
can release copies of a medical record
to a patient, if the physician so
chooses, according to Joseph Cowen, a
legal adviser to the UC-San Francisco

Medical Center. Therefore, depending
on the situation, the type of health fa
cility, and the doctor's preference,
there are different laws regarding
one's medical records.
Stanford Hospital relies on the Cali
fornia Administrative Code and can
thus claim medical records as hospital
property and limit automatic patient
access, according to Carole Price, as
sistant hospital director. A doctor at
the Hospital chooses to release copies
of records to a patient, she adds, "but
that is strictly the doctor's decision."
Besides emergencies where medi
cal records must be released if, for in
stance. a patient's life is at stake,
Price says the Hospital is open to ex
ceptions to its indirect access policy.
The staff reviews requests for records
on a case-by-case basis, Price notes.
Stanford Hospital abides by its poli
cy at least in part to protect its posi
tion in insurance matters, according
to Carl Peterson, liability adjustor for
the Farmers Insurance Exchange,
which handles the Hospital's insur
ance.
A trend toward increasing the ac
cess to medical records, Peterson
says, would "distress" many doctors,
who, he says, might view increased
access as increasing the chances for
malpractice suits. With patients re
ceiving more direct access to their
doctors' work, he notes, "you can't be
sure of anything. You never can tell
when and what patients will sue you
over."
Unlike Stanford Hospital, UC-San
Francisco Hospital releases copies of
medical records to patients upon writ
ten request, according to Cowen.
This policy is based on the state In
formation Practices Act, he explains.
In addition to protecting a patient
from unauthorized release of his or
her medical records, Cowen claims
the Act provides that the information
in the record is the property of the pa
tient.
"The idea is that information in the
records maintained by public institu
tions may be obtained by individual
patients," Cowen says.
Dr. Hugh Schade, a Los Altos family
practicioner, is a firm believer in pro
viding direct access to medical re
cords. So direct, in fact, that for the
past six years Schade says he's been
giving his patients their original re
cords, "not just copies."
Schade feels that providing medical
records — and good explanations of
their contents — is practicing preven
tive medicine.
"They (patients) have a much

greater familiarity and knowledge of
what's going on with their health," he
says. Without possessing such in
formation, he adds, "a doctor can
keep the patient coming back for
diagnoses Vvhich are often unneces
sary." And that, he implies, con
tributes to excess medical expenses.
Attempts to put all public and
private health care facilities under
one state law have been unsuccessful.
For the past three years, As
semblyman Howard Berman (D-Los
Angeles), has attempted to introduce
a law that would guarantee persons
the right to inspect their medical re
cords and compell health facilities to
provide copies.
A Berman aide said yesterday that
the assemblyman will definitely rein
troduce a bill similar to the one he in
troduced last year. That bill, As
sembly Bill 157, was killed by the Sen
ate Judiciary Committee.
California wouldn't be the first
state to establish more liberal access
to medical records, the aide said, not
ing that "about 12 to 15" states provide
"ranges" of direct access.
