No commercials
Stanford has a beautiful
basketball pavilion. Why is it
necessary, however, to allow an
oil, soft drink, and pizza com
pany to advertise on its
scoreboards? It's a small point
— perhaps — yet quite telling
regarding the fundamental
problem of commercialization
in every aspect of our daily
lives. To me, it adds a hick-town
flavor and slightly raw edge to
an otherwise great academic
University campus. Now it is
even being proposed that post
age stamps become prime ad
vertising space. I must object.

Grad study space
It is a shame that the spank
ing new Cecil B. Green Library
at a university as well-endowed
as Stanford serves the needs of
its graduate students in the hu
manities so poorly. I refer in
particular to the dissertation
rooms. The new library con
tains fewer than 100 such rooms
for Ph D candidates writing
their dissertations. According
to the Special Privileges per
sonnel, over 250 graduate stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences applied for these
spaces this fall. Even more stu
dents have inquired about them.
Thesis writers find them

selves lining up to apply for the
dissertation rooms long before
8.00 on the first morning of reg
istration each quarter, as
though they were waiting for
soup or admission into graduate
school. Most receive a letter of
rejection a week later.
In the English Department, of
which I am a member, graduate
students do not have access to
office space unless they are cur
rently teaching. The teaching
offices are crowded and used
primarily for tutorials and con
ferences. People in history and
other departments find them
selves, like us. without space to
work on campus. Given the
rents in Palo Alto, many gradu
ate students live in crowded cir
cumstances. No one I know can
afford to rent an office in town.

Coffee House
As a pretty regular customer
of the Coffee House, I have had
ample opportunity to marvel at
the arrogance — or is it ig
norance — of some of the pa
trons. I'll give them that much
of the benefit of doubt. Why do
customers leave, not just cups
and glasses, but litter, greasy
napkins and half-eaten food
(often remains of bag-lunches)
on the tables? I've noticed four
or five strategically placed

wastecans in the area, of which
perhaps one customer in 20
bothers to make use.
The bussers seem pretty
hard-worked and obviously have
duties in other parts of the Cof
fee House and kitchen as well.
Would it really wound the digni
ty of even a Stanford MBA to
practice a little common
courtesy toward both Coffee
House personel and their fellow
customers who are weary of
cleaning up other people's in or
der to eat in comfort?

An inequity?
Only a few scant years ago
President Jimmy Carter
magnanimously "pardoned"
thousands of men whom he
himself in national headlines
termed "the draft evaders."
They were men who had hidden,
changed their identities, or fled
to Canada during Vietnam "con
flict" — a war, undeclared and
illegal. 10 years long, in which
more than 50,000 Americans
DIED.
How dare he now, and in time
of peace, threaten with fine and
imprisonment one single person
who might fail merely to reg
ister his name on a piece of pa
per, after excusing thousands
who evaded or deserted an ac
tual battle — a battle to which
other thousands conscientiously
objected through many long
years of great emotional stress
and anguish (suffering FBI in
vestigations including many
hours' questioning former
neighbors, teachers, and
friends, false tax charges, even
unannounced seizure by the IRS
of personal bank savings ac
counts) and/or in which they
were forced to fight, were com
pelled to kill, were injured,
were maimed, and were killed
themselves?
Mr. Carter is contemptible
and treats Americans as fools.

Ignorant Sexism
Michael Selmi's comment
that "Rape ... by and large is
not a problem caused by Stand
ford men" was shown to be ut
terly ridiculous by Lyn
Bowman's recent letter (Daily,
Dec. 5). It is ignorance such as
Bowman's that is directly re
sponsible not only for rape but
for other more subtle forms of
aggression against women.
Bowman's ignorance is neat
ly summarized in his statement
thai "I do not spend my days and
nights reminding myself . . .
that one of these more powerful
men may attack me." He does
not seem to realize that rape is
not a result of strength abusing
weakness, but is, once again

quoting Mary Wentworth, ". . .
a societal crime towards wom
en as objects ... to be used by
men."' As a man. Bowman does
not have to deal with this ag
gressive attitude towards
himself, and his insensitivity to
this attitude towards women is
deplorable.
It is this ignorance and in
sensitivity which gives meaning
to the idea of sexism. And wom
en today are constantly faced
with this sexism: as workers
who get paid 60 percent less than
their male counterparts, as
working wives who are pres
sured into forsaking their own
careers for the sake of their hus
band's. and as students who are
raped atdusk in the Inner Quad.

Furthermore, Bowman owes
Leah Halper an apology for his
rude personal attacks. She is not
"too lazy to get her butt into the
gym." but is in fact in superb
physical condition, able to de
fend herself admirably.
Just as we all should take "re
sponsibility for being all that we
can be physically," we also are
responsible for fulfilling our ca
pacities to be intelligent and
compassionate. Halper. in her
relentless efforts to educate the
Stanford community, has super
powers compared to Bowman
on that front.
